        "text": "To connect to a MySQL® server through MySQL Workbench®, you can use the\n\nfollowing methods: standard TCP/IP connection, local socket or pipe, and\n\nstandard TCP/IP over SecureShell (SSH).\n\nStart a new connection in MySQL Workbench\n\nTo start the connection through MySQL Workbench, perform the following steps:\n\nGo to Database > Connect to Database...\n\nEnter the Connection Name.\n\nSelect the desired connection method from the dropdown list. See the following\n\nsections to learn more about these methods.\n\nStandard TCP/IP connection method\n\nNote: The skip_networking system variable affects this method. When\n\nthis variable is off, use named pipes or shaped memory for Windows® or Unix®\n\nsocket files in Unix.\n\nThis method has the following tabs: Parameter, SSL, and Advanced.\n\nParameter\n\nThe Parameter tab has the following options:\n\nHostname: The MySQL server's hostname or IP address.\n\nPort: The default TCP/IP port is 3306, but the MySQL server listen on another\n\nport for this protocol.\n\nUsername: The user for the connection.\n\nPassword: If not specified, you need to enter the user's password when\n\nMySQL Workbench tries to connect. You can also use a vault to store passwords.\n\nDefault Schema: The default schema used when connecting.\n\nSSL\n\nThe SSL tab has the following options:\n\nUse SSL: To disable SSL ecnryption, select No. To use the\n\nencryption only option (if the client library supports it), select If available.\n\nTo make it mandatory to use SSL encryption for the connection, select Require.\n\nSSL Key File: Specify the path on your local computer to the SSL key file.\n\nSSL CERT File: Specify the path on your local computer to the SSL certificate file.\n\nSSL CA File: Specify the path on your local computer to the SSL\n\nCertification Authority (CA) file.\n\nSSL Cipher: Select which cipher you want to use for the SSL encryption if\n\nyou want a specific one. This tab has the following buttons:\n\nSSL Wizard: This tool needs access to OpenSSL binary files in the system's PATH to\n\ngenerate SSL certificates for the MySQL server and client.\n\nFiles: Shows the location of the SSL files that the SSL Wizard generated.\n\nAdvanced\n\nThe Advanced tab has the following options:\n\nUse compression protocol: Check this option to compress the communication\n\nbetween MySQL Workbench and the MySQL server. This option increases the\n\ntransfer rates.\n\nUse ANSI quotes to quote identifiers: Use double quotes (\") to quote\n\nidentifiers instead of literal strings. This overrides the server setting.\n\nEnable Cleartext Authentication Plugin: Use this if your authentication method\n\nrequires the user's password in clear text instead of encrypted\n\nUse the old authentication protocol: Selcet this to disable the Connector/C++\n\nsecure_auth option. This helps users that use the old mysql_old_password\n\nauthentication plugin to connect to the server.\n\nTimeout: Specify the time to attempt the connection.\n\nSQL_MODE: Specify an SQL_MODE to override the server's default.\n\nLocal socket or pipe connection method\n\nThis connection method has the same tabs as the Standard TCP/IP one:\n\nParameters\n\nThe Parameter tab has the following options:\n\nSocket/Pipe Path: Specify the path on your local computer to the local\n\nsocket or pipe file. If this is empty, it uses the default location.\n\nThe username, password and default schema options are as in the Standard\n\nTCP/IP connection method.\n\nSSL\n\nThe SSL tab has the following options:\n\nAll the options in this tab are the same as in the Standard TCP/IP connection method.\n\nAdvanced\n\nThe Advanced tab has the following options:\n\nMost of the options in this tab are the same as in the Standard TCP/IP\n\nconnection method.\n\nThe Use compression protocol and Timeout options do not apply for this\n\nmethod.\n\nStandard TCP/IP over SSH connection method\n\nThis connection method has the same tabs as the Standard TCP/IP one:\n\nParameters\n\nThe Parameters tab has the following options:\n\nThis tab includes some common parameters with the Standard TCP/IP connection\n\nmethod and includes some other features.\n\nSSH Hostname: Specifies the hostname for the SSH server, where you can\n\nprovide an optional port number after a semicolon.\n\nSSH Username: Specifies the user used to make the SSH connection.\n\nSSH Password: Specifies the password for the SSH connection. You can\n\nalso use a vault.\n\nSSH Key File: Specifies the path to the SSH key file on your local computer.\n\nIf there is an error due to different host fingerprints, you can\n\nfind the SSH host fingerprints in ~/.ssh/known_hosts for Linux® and macOS®\n\nsystems and on C:\\Users\\username.ssh\\known_hosts for Windows®.\n\nSSL\n\nThe SSL tab has the following options:\n\nAll the tab options are the same as in the Standard TCP/IP\n\nconnection method.\n\nAdvanced\n\nThe Advanced tab has the following options:\n\nMost of the tab options are the same as in the Standard TCP/IP\n\nconnection method.\n\nThe Timeout option does not apply to this method.\n\nConclusion\n\nChoose the method that suits your requirements better to a connection between the\n\nMySQL Workbench app and your MySQL server.\n\nUse the Feedback tab to make any comments or ask questions. You can also start a conversation with us."
