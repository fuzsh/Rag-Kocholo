        "text": "THE United States Army wants soldiers to know it cares. It has a new slogan, ''An Army of One,'' meant to counteract the impression that the service is intolerant of individuality. It has new policies to combat ''turbulent lifestyle changes,'' such as moving soldiers with school-age children only during the summer. And starting on June 14, the Army's birthday, every officer and soldier will be issued a new hat -- a black beret.\n\n''Soldiering is an affair of the heart,'' Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, said in his speech announcing the beret edict.\n\nThe beret was once a distinction of special units -- Rangers, airborne troops, counterinsurgency forces. Now it has become a signal that all forces are special.\n\nAlas for General Shinseki, members of the elite infantry group that already wears black berets, the Rangers, oppose the move to universalize it. Three former Rangers completed a protest march from Fort Benning, Ga., to Washington on Friday, and they have drawn support from Senator Strom Thurmond and other lawmakers. President Bush has asked the Defense Department to look into the matter.\n\nClearly, the beret is a potent symbol -- not just within the Army, but over a long history as a fashion accessory. Whatever General Shinseki and the Ranger protest patrol have in mind, the beret brings with it many overtones and subliminal links with many wearers: Che Guevara, Huey P. Newton and Saddam Hussein, for instance. Monica Lewinsky, and Groucho Marx as an old man. The Civil Air Patrol wears berets, and so do members of the International Airstream Trailer Association.\n\n''The beauty of a beret is that it can look quite different on different people,'' said John Helmer of John Helmer Haberdashers in Portland, Ore., who has seen his beret sales rise steadily over the last few years. ''You can give it a little crease and create your own look. It's the only part of a uniform you can do that with.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
