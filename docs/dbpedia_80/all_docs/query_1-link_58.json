        "text": "A Hampton resident who served as Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki's commanding officer in Vietnam says he's \"exasperated\" that Shinseki was forced to resign over controversy surrounding the VA because he claims Shinseki had \"nothing to do\" with the problem and he feels Shinseki's ousting will cause more veterans to \"suffer.\"\n\nShinseki, a four-star general, resigned Friday after meeting with President Barack Obama to discuss findings that Phoenix VA employees had been falsifying health care appointment records to artificially reduce data about wait times. In all, 10 different VA facilities in eight states and Washington, D.C., have experienced significant delays in patient care, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFred Rice, a Hampton resident and Republican state representative, commanded Shinseki as part of an Army artillery battery of 150 men for six months in 1966 in Pleiku, Vietnam. Shinseki, then a second lieutenant, scouted out mortar shell targets for the unit and was wounded in combat for the first time while serving in the unit.\n\nRice said it's a \"crying shame\" that the \"very, very honorable\" Shinseki was forced to resign, as he said Shinseki has \"done more for the VA than anyone else in modern history.\" Rice also said he feared the individuals involved in the \"political pig pile\" that caused Shinseki's resignation did so while overlooking the fact it will take longer for a new VA leader to correct the problems than it would to leave it up to a knowledgeable guy with a history of \"getting stuff done.\"\n\n\"I think the problems are going to get worse before they get better,\" Rice said. \"What happened here, as (President Barack) Obama mentioned, is that (VA officials and employees) were hiding the truth from Shinseki. It's kind of hard to correct something when it's hidden from you. They hid the fact that they were cooking the books, and that didn't make it his fault. To me, it's just a real shame that an individual with an impeccable record didn't do anything to correct the issues because he couldn't possibly have known about them.\"\n\nShinseki and Rice, a retired Army major and Bronze Star recipient who served as a Green Beret, have stayed in touch since Shinseki became chief of staff of the Army. Rice said Shinseki is a \"brilliant planner and a very solid commander,\" and he said Shinseki's military career paints the picture of a \"very low-key\" and \"duty-bound\" person who went out of his way to help his fellow soldiers — not someone who would cover up issues that may have caused up to 40 patients to die while awaiting care.\n\n\"What happened in this whole thing is what I like to call the 'Christmas tree approach,'\" Rice said. \"You can have a Christmas tree with a lot of decorations and lights and stuff that's really glittery and nice on the outside, but underneath all the limbs are decaying. You've got this nice angel at the top, and what these people have done is they've cut the angel off the top because they think it'll solve the problem and change the tree.\"\n\nThe VA health care system provides medical care to about 6.5 million veterans annually, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA recently released report by the Veterans Affairs Inspector General's office found about 1,700 veterans in need of care were \"at risk of being lost or forgotten\" after being kept off an official waiting list. The AP has said the report confirmed earlier allegations of excessive waiting times for care in Phoenix, finding individuals on the waiting list had an average wait of 115 days for a first appointment — nearly five times as long as the 24-day average the hospital had reported. A more detailed review is ongoing to determine whether any deaths occurred as a result of these delays, according to the AP.\n\nObama told the AP on Friday that Shinseki shouldn't be labeled a failure or accused of wrongdoing by veterans. He reportedly credited Shinseki with reducing veteran homelessness, improving care for women and making progress on veterans' education and mental health treatment.\n\n\"I want to reiterate, he is a very good man,\" Obama told the AP. \"He's a good person who's done exemplary work on our behalf.\""
