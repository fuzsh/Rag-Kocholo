        "text": "FORT MYER, VA. - “And so I say one last time, my name is Shinseki and I am a soldier – proud of it.”\n\nWith that trademark expression from an Army chief of staff who defined himself as a simple soldier, Gen. Eric Shinseki on Wednesday bade farewell to a career that spanned five decades, from the jungles of Vietnam, where combat cost him part of a foot, to the halls of the Pentagon, where he fought bureaucratic wars until his final hours as chief of staff.\n\nThe White House has not nominated a Shinseki successor, but officials let it be known the day before his retirement ceremony that it would be Peter Schoomaker, who retired from the Army in 2000. Never before has an Army chief of staff been chosen from the ranks of the retired.\n\nIn his parting remarks at Fort Myer’s Summerall Field, Gen. Shinseki made no mention of his boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, with whom he had a sometimes tense relationship. Mr. Rumsfeld, who was in Europe, did not send a high-level representative from his office.\n\nGen. Shinseki alluded to the tensions, which some have attributed to a belief by Mr. Rumsfeld that Army leaders resisted a basic principle of democracy: that they must answer to civilian authority.\n\n“We understand that leadership is not an exclusive function of the uniformed services,” Gen. Shinseki said to an audience that included members of Congress and military officers from countries across the globe. “So when some suggest that we in the Army don’t understand the importance of civilian control of the military, well, that’s just not helpful – and it isn’t true.\n\n“The Army has always understood the primacy of civilian control,” he added. “In fact we are the ones who reinforce that principle with those other armies with whom we train all around the world. So to muddy the waters when important issues are at stake – issues of life and death – is a disservice to all those in and out of uniform who serve and lead so well.”\n\nGen. Shinseki, a native of Hawaii, is the only officer of Japanese descent to rise to the top post in the Army. His career almost came to a tragic early end. On his second tour of duty in Vietnam, as a cavalry troop commander in 1970, he was wounded in action and lost part of a foot.\n\nHe was so severely hurt that doctors tried to get him to leave the service, according to Les Brownlee, the acting Army secretary who officiated at Gen. Shinseki’s retirement ceremony.\n\n“His love of soldiers – soldiers who had carried him out of combat on their backs, twice – and his love of our Army was so deep that he persevered,” Mr. Brownlee said, with Gen. Shinseki at his side."
