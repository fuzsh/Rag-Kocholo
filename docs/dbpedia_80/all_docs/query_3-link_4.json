        "text": "The Seventh Army was re-activated at Stuttgart in late November 1950, the V and VII Corps headquarters were organized, and four divisions were moved back to Europe from the U.S. The first to arrive was the 4th Infantry Division in May 1951, followed by the 2nd Armored Division and the 43rd and 28th Infantry Divisions during summer and fall of 1951. A new joint U.S. European Command was established Aug. 1, 1952.\n\nOn that day, the Army headquarters at Heidelberg, became Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. In 1953, the Korean War Armistice was signed, and tensions began to ease in Europe. About 13,500 Soldiers manned each of the U.S. Army Europe divisions. New equipment fielded at the time included the M-48 tank, the M-59 armored personnel carrier, and tactical nuclear weapons. On July 15, 1958, U.S. Army Europe forces were ordered to assist the Lebanese government. Task Force 201, the Army component of Operation Blue Bat, rapidly deployed more than 8,000 Soldiers from Europe to Beirut by air and sea.\n\nAs the situation quickly stabilized, all U.S. forces redeployed from the country within four months. Although the open East-West conflict had ended, political tensions remained high in Europe. Particularly troublesome was the impasse over the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, the former British, French, and U.S. zones of occupation) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, the former Soviet zone of occupation).\n\nBerlin posed an additional problem; it was surrounded by East Germany, but Great Britain, France, the U.S., and the Soviet Union all occupied sectors in the city. At that time, travel between the sectors was unrestricted. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced in June 1961 that the Soviet Union was planning to conclude a peace treaty with the East German government, 3,000 East German refugees flowed daily into Berlin.\n\nSuddenly on the night of August 12, 1961, the Soviets closed the border crossing points and began to construct the Berlin Wall, isolating the three western sectors of the city both from East Germany and the Soviet sector, or East Berlin. In response, the U.S. deployed an additional armored cavalry regiment to Europe, along with additional support units. U.S. Army Europe's strength reached an all-time high of 277,342 in June 1962 as the crisis deepened. The command dispatched a reinforced infantry battle group to Berlin to strengthen the existing garrison.\n\nThe crisis cooled in Berlin from 1962 to 1963, and augmenting forces returned to the U.S. Equipment modernization programs during this period included the M-113 armored personnel carrier, the M-14 rifle, the M-60 machine gun, the OV-1 fixed wing observation aircraft, the UH-1B Huey helicopter, the M-151 jeep, and the M-60 tank. On December 1, 1966, the separate headquarters of Seventh Army was eliminated. At the same time, France withdrew from the military structure of NATO, and U.S. forces were withdrawn from France.\n\nThe communications zone headquarters moved from Orleans, France, to Worms, Germany (and later to Kaiserslautern where, as 21st Theater Sustainment Command, it remains today). USEUCOM moved to Stuttgart. The first Redeployment of Forces from Germany (commonly known as REFORGER) took place in 1968, with the removal of about 28,000 military personnel from Germany. The units and personnel withdrawn remained committed to NATO and during exercise REFORGER I, conducted in January 1969, more than 12,000 Soldiers returned to Germany for an exercise using pre-positioned equipment.\n\nIn the 1970s, U.S. Army Europe continued to improve its firepower when it received the new M-16A1 rifle, the TOW anti-tank weapon, the OH-58 observation helicopter, and the AH-1G Cobra helicopter. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the needs of the war in Vietnam reduced U.S. Army Europe's assigned strength, sometimes drastically. As the war began to wane, forces began to return to Europe, and U.S. Army Europe adopted a new system based upon the community commander concept.\n\nIn 1974, efforts to streamline the headquarters resulted in the termination of the U.S. Theater Army Support Command, and its replacement by a smaller organization, the 21st Theater Army Area Command, now known as 21st Theater Sustainment Command. During the 1970s, force protection concerns grew as various groups conducted terror operations targeting U.S. facilities and personnel with bombings, kidnapping and assassinations.\n\nIn May 1972, bombs exploded at V Corps headquarters Frankfurt, killing an Army lieutenant colonel; and in Heidelberg at Campbell Barracks, killing three Soldiers. U.S. installations were attacked sporadically throughout the remainder of the decade, including a failed 1977 attack on a U.S. Army base in Giessen. On September 15, 1981, an assassination attempt was made on U.S. Army Europe's commander Gen. Frederick J. Kroesen and his wife as they were driving through Heidelberg -- the automobile trunk lid was hit by a RPG-7 anti-tank projectile.\n\nIn 1985, a Soldier was lured out of a Wiesbaden nightclub and killed for his ID card which was then used to enter Rhein-Main Air Base the next day to plant a bomb that killed two. In 1986, a bombing at a Berlin disco frequented by service members killed two Soldiers. Despite these threats, the Warsaw Pact remained the primary focus for U.S. leaders and Soldiers.\n\nPlanning and exercises strengthening U.S. Army Europe’s ability to deter a Communist attack led to increased numbers of combat and support units, concurrently with a wide-ranging modernization in the decade of the 1980s. More than 400 new systems were introduced, including individual weapons, field rations, the M1Al Abrams tank, the M2 and M3 Bradley series of cavalry and infantry fighting vehicles, the multiple launch rocket system, the Patriot air defense system, the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, and the AH-64A Apache helicopter."
