        "text": "Gen. Eric Shinseki was picked as the Obama White House’s secretary of Veterans Affairs. Here’s a quick look at his life and career.\n\nCareer: Retired Army chief of staff, he served from 1999-2003. Has joined the boards of Honeywell International and Ducommun, and Hawaiian companies Grove Farm Corp. and First Hawaiian Bank.\n\nHistory: Is best known for testifying in Congress in 2003, shortly before the U.S. invaded Iraq, that several hundred thousand soldiers would be needed to stabilize Iraq. He also anticipated ethnic tensions that would require a large force on the ground. The estimate was publicly rejected by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, and called “off the mark.”\n\nHas 38 years of military experience, reaching the rank of general. His military awards include two purple hearts. He served two combat tours in Vietnam and commanded a NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nBorn: Nov. 28, 1942 (age 66)\n\nBirth city: Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii\n\nEducation: B.S., United States Military Academy, ’65; M.A., Duke University, ’76\n\nFamily: Married to Patricia \"Patty\" Yoshinobu, two children.\n\nQuote of Note: “You must love those you lead before you can be an effective leader. You can certainly command without that sense of commitment, but you cannot lead without it. And without leadership, command is a hollow experience, a vacuum often filled with mistrust and arrogance.” – as he retired as Army chief of staff in 2003.\n\nFun facts:\n\n- Was the highest-ranking Asian-American in the military.\n\n- Did not call on Rumsfeld to resign, although other retired officers did so publicly.\n\n- Taught English at the United States Military Academy in the late 1970s.\n\n- Lost part of one of his feet when he was injured in Vietnam.\n\nSources: www.nytimes.com, www.history.army.mil, www.newsweek.com, www.washingtonpost.com"
