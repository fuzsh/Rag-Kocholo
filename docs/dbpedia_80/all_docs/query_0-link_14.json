Luong came to the United States as part of Operation Frequent Wind, a mission to help rescue Vietnamese citizens from the country during the final days of the Vietnam War. Luong's nearly 27-year military career stemmed from his experience on the deck of the USS Hancock when he was a little boy leaving Vietnam.\n\nAlmost 40 years after his rescue, family and friends watched as Luong became the first Vietnamese-born general officer in the U.S. military during a promotion ceremony on Cooper Field at Fort Hood, Texas, where he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, Aug. 8, 2014.\n\nLuong retired in 2021 after 34 years of dedicated and faithful service in the U.S. Army.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nVietnamese-born 'First Team' officer makes history\n\nFirst US general of Vietnamese descent recalls harrowing escape from war\n\nBrigadier General\n\nJohn M.

Gabbard was the first female Distinguished Honor Graduate at Fort McClellan's Officer Candidate School, and was the first woman to ever receive an award of appreciation from the Kuwaiti military on her second overseas tour.\n\nGabbard was born in Leloaloa, American Samoa, in 1981. The fourth of five children, at the age of two, Gabbard and her family settled in Hawaii. As a teenager, she co-founded the Healthy Hawai'i Coalition, a non-profit, educational organization, made up of concerned citizens from across the state, whose two-fold purpose is to protect the environment and to improve individual and community health. An advocate for environmental policy, Gabbard ran for the Hawaii State Legislature in 2002 and became the youngest person ever elected. A year later, Gabbard joined the Hawaii National Guard to serve Hawaii's citizens and our country.\n\nIn 2004, Gabbard voluntarily deployed to Iraq with her fellow Soldiers of the 29th Brigade, eventually serving two tours of combat duty in the Middle East. Gabbard continues to serve the Hawaii National Guard's 29th Brigade Combat Team. In between her two tours, Gabbard worked in the U.S. Senate as a legislative aide to Sen. Daniel Akaka, where she advised the senator on energy independence, homeland security, the environment, and veterans' affairs.\n\nIn 2010, Gabbard ran for the Honolulu City Council and served as Chair of the Safety, Economic Development and Government Affairs committee and Vice Chair of the Budget committee. Gabbard represented Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTulsi Gabbard shares her experience for Army Women’s Mentorship Program\n\nSenator\n\nTammy Duckworth\n\n2006: The first Thai American elected to Congress\n\nTammy Duckworth is one of the first two female combat veterans, the first disabled woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress and the first member of Congress born in Thailand.\n\nIn 2004, then-Maj. Duckworth was deployed to Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot for the Illinois Army National Guard. She was one of the first Army women to fly combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom until her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, Nov. 12, 2004. Duckworth lost her legs and partial use of her right arm in the explosion and was awarded a Purple Heart for her combat injuries. She was the first female double amputee from the war. Duckworth spent the next year recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. As one of the highest-ranking patients, she quickly became an advocate for her fellow Soldiers and testified before Congress about caring for our veterans and wounded warriors.\n\nFollowing her recovery, Duckworth ran for Congress in 2006 and after a narrow loss, she became director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. In Illinois, she worked to create a tax credit for employers who hired Veterans, established a first-in-the-nation, 24/7 crisis hotline for Veterans and developed innovative programs to improve veterans' access to housing and health care.\n\nIn 2009, President Obama appointed Duckworth to be assistant secretary of veterans affairs. There, Duckworth led an initiative to end homelessness among veterans. She created the Office of Online Communications to improve the VA's accessibility, especially among young Veterans and also worked to address the unique challenges that American Indians and female Veterans face.\n\nDuckworth ran to represent Illinois 8th congressional district in 2012 to advocate for the practical solutions and cooperation needed to rebuild our economy and ensure that every American has a chance to achieve the American Dream. Duckworth was then elected to the U.S. Senate, representing Illinois, in 2016.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmputee shares story, encourages community\n\nDuckworth, Vaught inducted into Army Women's Foundation hall of fame\n\nVA official visits fellow Wounded Warriors with Georgia Senator\n\nSenator Duckworth shares personal story during AAPI event\n\nVideo: Women's History Month - Lt.

Pietsch became the first woman to be promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps in 2001. In her military career, Judge Pietsch participated in numerous exercises and deployments throughout the Asia Pacific Region. Pietsch retired from Army service in 2007.\n\nAs part of the 2007 \"surge\" in Iraq, Pietsch volunteered as a Department of Defense civilian to deploy to Iraq for a year where she was seconded to the U.S. Department of State to serve as the deputy rule of law coordinator for the Baghdad Provincial Reconstruction Team. During her deployment to Iraq, Pietsch assisted with numerous civil society projects involving a variety of Rule of Law partners, including the Iraqi Jurist Union, Iraqi Bar Association, law schools, and international rights, women's rights and human rights organizations. She evaluated and sought funding for numerous projects aimed at building capacity within the Iraqi legal community to include the establishment, in close collaboration with the Iraqi Bar Association, of a Legal Aid Clinic at one of the Iraq's largest detention facilities. During her time in Iraq, she also established meaningful relationships with numerous Government of Iraq ministries, nongovernmental organizations, and Coalition partners to help reinvigorate the rule of law in Iraq.\n\nPietsch was nominated by President Barack Obama and subsequently appointed a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in June 2012.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWaterloo to Washington: The Long Journey of Coral Wong Pietsch\n\nGeneral, Chief of Staff of the Army\n\nEric K.

He was sent to Korea and, following repeated requests, to Vietnam, where he commanded an infantry company before serving as an advisor to Army of the Republic of Vietnam units in the northern part of South Vietnam.\n\nShortly after his tour in Vietnam, Mukoyama left active duty and joined the reserves, serving with training divisions in Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. In 1986, Mukoyama was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the youngest general in the Army at that time. In just three more years, he was promoted to major general, where he commanded the 70th Training Division.\n\nAfter retiring from 32 years of military service in 1995, Mukoyama continued his deep involvement in the military through Veterans' advocacy programs, helping create the Military Outreach of Greater Chicago, serving as vice chair of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans, and chairing a committee with the National Veterans' Network to select the design for the Congressional Gold Medal award authorized by the Congressional Gold Medal for Japanese American Veterans.\n\nMajor General\n\nJohn Liu Fugh\n\n1984: The first Chinese American general officer in the U.S. Army\n\nMajor General John Liu Fugh was a Beijing native who left China with his family after the Communist takeover in 1949.\n\nIn 1984, Fugh was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, and became the assistant judge advocate general for civil law. In this position, he created the Army's first environmental law division and the procurement fraud division.\n\nUpon his retirement in June 1993, Fugh became a partner in the law firm of McGuire, Woods, Battle and Boothe, Washington, D.C. From 1995 to 2000, he served as president for several U.S. companies in Beijing, including McDonnell Douglas that later merged with Boeing Company. As chief executive for these companies, he was responsible for strategic direction of business development and projects in China. His stature as a retired U.S. general officer, coupled with his ethnic background and fluency in Mandarin, facilitated in developing relationships with key Chinese government and industry decision-makers. Throughout his tour in Beijing, he served on the Board of the American Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFugh is currently Chairman of the Committee of 100, a national, non-partisan group of prominent Chinese Americans that brings bicultural perspectives to U.S. relations with China and addresses the concerns of Americans of Chinese/Asian descent.

He also serves on the Advisory Council of Asia Society, Washington Center, and a director of the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation.\n\nFugh graduated from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and the George Washington University Law School. He attended the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the U.S. Army War College, and the U.S. Army Command & General Staff College. He is a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia.\n\nLieutenant Colonel, Judge\n\nHerbert Choy\n\n1971: The first Asian American federal judge\n\nJudge Herbert Choy was previously a first lieutenant in the Army and became the first Asian American federal judge in 1971 and the first person of Korean ancestry to be admitted to the bar in the United States. Fresh out of Harvard, Choy's life forever changed on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor. The next day, he enlisted in the Army. As a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, he entered the Army as a lieutenant and left as a captain, after serving in both Japan and Korea, part of the time as a member of the Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps. Choy was a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves JAG Corps. He emerged from the Army tri-lingual, mastering Korean, Japanese and English.\n\nSenator\n\nDaniel K. Inouye\n\n1959: The first Japanese American elected to Congress\n\nInouye was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Sept. 7, 1924. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Hawaii, and his law degree from George Washington University.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1941, the fateful day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 17-year-old Dan Inouye was one of the first Americans to handle civilian casualties in the Pacific war. He had taken medical aid training and was pressed into service as head of a first-aid litter team. He saw a \"lot of blood\" and did not go home for a week. During World War II, Inouye served in the U.S. Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Composed of Soldiers of Japanese ancestry, the 442nd became one of the most decorated military units in U.S. history. For his combat heroism, which cost him his right arm, Inouye was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart with Cluster. He practiced law in Hawaii before entering territorial politics in 1954.\n\nWhen Hawaii became the 50th state, Inouye became one of its first representatives in the U.S. Congress, then won election to the U.S. Senate in 1962. Sen. Inouye gained national distinction in the 1970s as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee and, in 1987, as chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee. He was a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which he chaired from 2009 to 2012, and also served as the Senate's president pro tempore from 2010 until his death in 2012. In 2013, Inouye was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, becoming the first senator to receive both the Medal of Freedom and the Medal of Honor.\n\nColonel\n\nYoung-Oak Kim\n\n1951: The first Asian American to lead a combat battalion in a war\n\nCol. Young-Oak Kim is also the only Korean American to be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at the Battle of Anzio during World War II. Kim, having reenlisted and promoted to major, became the first ethnic minority to command a regular combat battalion, the first of the 31st Infantry. When then-2nd Lt. Young Oak Kim reported for duty at Camp Shelby, Miss., in Feb. 1943, the commander of the 100th Battalion (Separate), Lt. Col. Farrant Turner, offered him an immediate transfer because \"Koreans and Japanese don't always get along.\" Kim refused on the spot,\"You're wrong. They're Americans, I'm American, and we're going to fight for America.\" The young Korean American lieutenant was being both patriotic and pragmatic. Born in 1919 in downtown Los Angeles; amid Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, and Jewish immigrants, Kim knew his opportunities for advancement would be limited in a \"white man's army. \"If I wasn't with the 100th,\" Kim recalled many years later, \"I would be a PR [Public Relations] officer or have some insignificant duty someplace else, because nobody was going to let me, as an Asian, command regular troops.\"\n\nCaptain\n\nFred Ohr\n\n1941: Capt. Fred Ohr is the first and only American fighter ace of Korean descent\n\nDr. Fred Ohr was born in Portland, Ore., in 1919, and became an aviation cadet in 1941. He was later assigned to the 2nd Fighter Squadron, 52nd Fighter Group in North Africa and Sicily as a fighter pilot flying Spitfires. He scored his first aerial combat victory flying a Spitfire in 1943. The rest of his victories came after the group transitioned to P-51s in 1944. Ohr ended his tour of duty as the squadron's commanding officer.\n\nThen-Maj. Fred F. Ohr served with: 2nd Fighter Squadron, 52nd Fighter Group; 116th Cavalry Regiment, Idaho National Guard; 183rd Field Artillery; 115th Cavalry; 12th Air Force; 15th Air Force; and 68th Material Service Squadron. After the war, he returned to college in California. He studied at the University of California, Berkley, and Northwestern Dental School in Chicago. He established a career as a dental surgeon in Chicago.\n\nCorporal\n\nJoseph L. Pierce\n\n1862: Fought at the battle of Gettysburg\n\nJoseph L. Pierce was age 21 when he enlisted in the 14th Connecticut Infantry in August 1862. It's unclear how Pierce ended up in the United States. One story has it that his father sold him to Connecticut ship Captain Amos Peck. Another story was that his brother sold him. Still another was that Peck picked Pierce up while he was adrift in the South China Sea. Peck, a lifelong bachelor, turned the 10-year-old he called \"Joe\" over to his mother in Connecticut. In his youth, Joe went to school with the Peck's children and formally became Joseph Pierce in 1853. He picked up his last name from President Franklin Pierce. Pierce worked as a farmer in New Britain, Connecticut, at the time of his military enlistment. He listed his birthplace as Canton in Kwangtung Province, China.\n\nPierce's regiment participated in the Battle of Antietam, Md., Sept. 17, 1862. He suffered some sickness during his time around Washington and was in the hospital for a time. He was assigned to the Quartermaster Department for a bit and rejoined the 14th in time for the Battle of Chancellorsville, Va. in May 1863. The 14th had a distinguished role in the Gettysburg campaign. It fought on the north part of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, and was one of the units that helped repel Pickett's Charge. The 14th was primarily responsible for turning back Brig. Gen. James Pettigrew's North Carolina division. The 14th's regimental history says that during Pickett's charge, Pierce appeared \"pig-tail and all, the only Chinese in the Army of the Potomac,\" but as history reflects, he wasn't in fact the only Soldier of Chinese descent. Today, you can see the 14th Memorial to the north of the grove of trees marking the high-water mark of the Confederacy.\n\nPrivate\n\nEdward Day Cohota\n\n1864: Fought in Civil War, Career Soldier\n\nIn 1845, Sargent S. Day, captain of the square-rigged merchant ship Cohota, left Shanghai, China, bound for Massachusetts. Two days from port, he discovered two little half-starved Chinese boys on board. The older boy died, but Day \"adopted\" the younger boy and named him Edward Day Cohota. Edward sailed the world with Captain and Mrs. Day until the captain retired to Gloucester, Mass., in 1857. He attended school and the other Day children treated him as a brother.\n\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War, Cohota joined the 23rd Massachusetts Infantry. He fought in the Battle of Drury's Bluff near Richmond, Va., on May 16, 1864, and at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Va., June 3, 1864. He stayed with the Army of the Potomac through the end of the war. After the war, Cohota rejoined the Army and was stationed at Fort Randall, Dakota Territory. He married and had six children. He served in the Army for 30 years. He believed that his military service qualified him for U.S. citizenship. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion act, a legal measure enacted to cease the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United States. Because Cohota hadn't submitted his second set of naturalization papers prior to the passing of this Act, he ultimately was unable to gain American citizenship. Cohota died at the Battle Mountain Sanitarium for Veterans in Hot Springs, S.D., in 1935.\n\nSpecialist Five\n\nDennis Fujii\n\n1971: Vietnam War\n\nSpc. 5 Dennis Fujii enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1968 and soon after deployed to Vietnam. He spent his first months assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division as an assistant machine gunner. In February 1971, the 21-year-old Soldier was on his second Vietnam combat tour as a “dust off” medevac UH-1 helicopter crew chief with the 237th Medical Detachment, 61st Medical Battalion, 67th Medical Group, where he evacuated the wounded out of Laos. Fujii returned to Hawaii on Feb. 28, 1971, and was given a hero's welcome by Gov. John A. Burns. He later transferred to the Hawaii Army National Guard and the Pacific Army Reserve. He went on to work as a utilities and logistics technician for Global Associates at the Johnston Atoll Wildlife Refuge Island in the North Pacific. During a White House ceremony on July 5, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden awarded Fujii the Medal of Honor.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. Army — Medal of Honor: Specialist Five Dennis M. Fujii\n\nStaff Sergeant\n\nEdward Kaneshiro\n\n1967: Vietnam War\n\nStaff Sgt. Edward Kaneshiro enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1959 and upon completion of advanced individual training as an infantryman, he was assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. He served in non-combat overseas tours in Okinawa, Japan and South Korea, and was then assigned Troop C, 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. He deployed to Vietnam as a squad leader within his platoon.During a mission in Kim Son Valley, Vietnam, in December 1966, his unit came under fire from North Vietnamese troops. Kaneshiro crawled forward to attack, using six grenades and an M16 rifle. This brave and selfless act not only saved the lives of U.S. Soldiers, but also resulted in success for the next mission of the Army forces. Kaneshiro was later killed in action on March 6, 1967, as a result of a hostile gunshot wound. Kaneshiro left behind his wife Mitsuko and their five children. During a White House ceremony on July 5, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden posthumously awarded Kaneshiro the Medal of Honor, which was received by his son, John Kaneshiro.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. Army — Medal of Honor: Staff Sergeant Edward Kaneshiro\n\nCorporal\n\nTerry \"Teruo\" Kawamura\n\n1969: Vietnam War\n\nCpl.

Corporal Kawamura distinguished himself by heroic action while serving as a member of the 173d Engineer Company. An enemy demolition team infiltrated the unit quarters area and opened fire with automatic weapons. Disregarding the intense fire, Corporal Kawamura ran for his weapon. At that moment, a violent explosion tore a hole in the roof and stunned the occupants of the room. Corporal Kawamura jumped to his feet, secured his weapon and, as he ran toward the door to return the enemy fire, he observed that another explosive charge had been thrown through the hole in the roof to the floor. He immediately realized that 2 stunned fellow soldiers were in great peril and shouted a warning. Although in a position to escape, Corporal Kawamura unhesitatingly wheeled around and threw himself on the charge. In complete disregarding his safety, Corporal Kawamura prevented serious injury or death to several members of his unit. The extraordinary courage and selflessness displayed by Corporal Kawamura are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society\n\nBrigadier General\n\nRodney J.T.

He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions near Bien Hao, Republic of Vietnam, Jan. 1, 1969. Citation: Sfc. Yano distinguished himself while serving with the Air Cavalry Troop. Sfc. Yano was performing the duties of crew chief aboard the troop's command-and-control helicopter during action against enemy forces entrenched in dense jungle. From an exposed position in the face of intense small arms and antiaircraft fire he delivered suppressive fire upon the enemy forces and marked their positions with smoke and white phosphorous grenades, thus enabling his troop commander to direct accurate and effective artillery fire against the hostile emplacements. A grenade, exploding prematurely, covered him with burning phosphorous, and left him severely wounded. Flaming fragments within the helicopter caused supplies and ammunition to detonate. Dense white smoke filled the aircraft, obscuring the pilot's vision and causing him to lose control. Although having the use of only one arm and being partially blinded by the initial explosion, Sfc. Yano completely disregarded his welfare and began hurling blazing ammunition from the helicopter. In so doing he inflicted additional wounds upon himself, yet he persisted until the danger was past. Sfc. Yano's indomitable courage and profound concern for his comrades averted loss of life and additional injury to the rest of the crew. By his conspicuous gallantry at the cost of his life, in the highest traditions of the military service, Sfc. Yano has reflected great credit on himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society .\n\nRodney J. T.

Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. During a reconnaissance patrol, his platoon was suddenly engaged by intense machine-gun fire hemming in the platoon on three sides. A defensive perimeter was hastily established, but the enemy added mortar and rocket fire to the deadly fusillade and assaulted the position from several directions. With complete disregard for his safety, P/Sgt. Smith moved through the deadly fire along the defensive line, positioning soldiers, distributing ammunition and encouraging his men to repeal the enemy attack. Struck to the ground by enemy fire which caused a severe shoulder wound, he regained his feet, killed the enemy soldier and continued to move about the perimeter. He was again wounded in the shoulder and stomach but continued moving on his knees to assist in the defense. Noting the enemy massing at a weakened point on the perimeter, he crawled into the open and poured deadly fire into the enemy ranks. As he crawled on, he was struck by a rocket. Moments later, he regained consciousness, and drawing on his fast dwindling strength, continued to crawl from man to man. When he could move no farther, he chose to remain in the open where he could alert the perimeter to the approaching enemy. P/Sgt. Smith perished, never relenting in his determined effort against the enemy. The valorous acts and heroic leadership of this outstanding soldier inspired those remaining members of his platoon to beat back the enemy assaults. P/Sgt. Smith's gallant actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and they reflect great credit upon him and the Armed Forces of his country.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society .\n\nPrivate First Class\n\nAnthony T.

On that date, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano was in charge of a machine-gun squad supporting the defensive positioning of Company F when a numerically superior enemy force launched a fierce attack. Because of the enemy's overwhelming numbers, friendly troops were forced to execute a limited withdrawal. As the men fell back, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano ordered his squad to take up more defensible positions and provide covering fire for the withdrawing friendly force. Although having been wounded in the shoulder during the initial enemy assault, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano gathered a supply of grenades and ammunition and returned to his original position to face the enemy alone. As the hostile troops concentrated their strength against his emplacement in an effort to overrun it, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano fought fiercely and courageously, delivering deadly accurate fire into the ranks of the onrushing enemy. When his ammunition was depleted, he engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat until he was killed. Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano's heroic stand so inspired his comrades that they launched a counterattack that completely repulsed the enemy.

Miyamura, a machinegun squad leader, aware of the imminent danger to his men unhesitatingly jumped from his shelter wielding his bayonet in close hand-to-hand combat killing approximately 10 of the enemy. Returning to his position, he administered first aid to the wounded and directed their evacuation. As another savage assault hit the line, he manned his machine-gun and delivered withering fire until his ammunition was expended. He ordered the squad to withdraw while he stayed behind to render the gun inoperative. He then bayoneted his way through infiltrated enemy soldiers to a second gun emplacement and assisted in its operation. When the intensity of the attack necessitated the withdrawal of the company Cpl. Miyamura ordered his men to fall back while he remained to cover their movement.

Davila distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action, on 28 May 1944, near Artena, Italy. During the offensive which broke through the German mountain strongholds surrounding the Anzio beachhead, Staff Sergeant Davila risked death to provide heavy weapons support for a beleaguered rifle company. Caught on an exposed hillside by heavy, grazing fire from a well-entrenched German force, his machine gunners were reluctant to risk putting their guns into action. Crawling fifty yards to the nearest machine gun, Staff Sergeant Davila set it up alone and opened fire on the enemy. In order to observe the effect of his fire, Sergeant Davila fired from the kneeling position, ignoring the enemy fire that struck the tripod and passed between his legs. Ordering a gunner to take over, he crawled forward to a vantage point and directed the firefight with hand and arm signals until both hostile machine guns were silenced. Bringing his three remaining machine guns into action, he drove the enemy to a reserve position two hundred yards to the rear. When he received a painful wound in the leg, he dashed to a burned tank and, despite the crash of bullets on the hull, engaged a second enemy force from the tank's turret. Dismounting, he advanced 130 yards in short rushes, crawled 20 yards and charged into an enemy-held house to eliminate the defending force of five with a hand grenade and rifle fire. Climbing to the attic, he straddled a large shell hole in the wall and opened fire on the enemy. Although the walls of the house were crumbling, he continued to fire until he had destroyed two more machine guns. His intrepid actions brought desperately needed heavy weapons support to a hard-pressed rifle company and silenced four machine gunners, which forced the enemy to abandon their prepared positions. Staff Sergeant Davila's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society\n\nPrivate\n\nBarney F.

An enemy 88mm self-propelled gun opened direct fire on the company, causing the men to disperse and seek cover. Private First Class Muranaga's mortar squad was ordered to action, but the terrain made it impossible to set up their weapons. The squad leader, realizing the vulnerability of the mortar position, moved his men away from the gun to positions of relative safety. Because of the heavy casualties being inflicted on his company, Private First Class Muranaga, who served as a gunner, attempted to neutralize the 88mm weapon alone. Voluntarily remaining at his gun position, Private First Class Muranaga manned the mortar himself and opened fire on the enemy gun at a range of approximately 400 yards. With his third round, he was able to correct his fire so that the shell landed directly in front of the enemy gun. Meanwhile, the enemy crew, immediately aware of the source of mortar fire, turned their 88mm weapon directly on Private First Class Muranaga's position. Before Private First Class Muranaga could fire a fourth round, an 88mm shell scored a direct hit on his position, killing him instantly. Because of the accuracy of Private First Class Muranaga's previous fire, the enemy soldiers decided not to risk further exposure and immediately abandoned their position.

He posted one of his men, an automatic rifleman, on the extreme left, 15 yards from his own position. Taking his position, Sergeant Ohata delivered effective fire against the advancing enemy. The man to his left called for assistance when his automatic rifle was shot and damaged. With utter disregard for his personal safety, Sergeant Ohata left his position and advanced 15 yards through heavy machine gun fire. Reaching his comrade's position, he immediately fired upon the enemy, killing 10 enemy soldiers and successfully covering his comrade's withdrawal to replace his damaged weapon. Sergeant Ohata and the automatic rifleman held their position and killed 37 enemy soldiers. Both men then charged the three remaining soldiers and captured them. Later, Sergeant Ohata and the automatic rifleman stopped another attacking force of 14, killing four and wounding three while the others fled. The following day he and the automatic rifleman held their flank with grim determination and staved off all attacks. Staff Sergeant Ohata's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society\n\nSergeant\n\nJose Calugas\n\n1942: World War II\n\nSgt. Jose Calugas served in Battery B, 88th Field Artillery, Philippine Scouts, Jan. 16, 1942. Citation: The action for which the award was made took place near Culis, Bataan Province, Philippine Islands, on 16 January 1942. A battery gun position was bombed and shelled by the enemy until 1 gun was put out of commission and all the cannoneers were killed or wounded. Sgt. Calugas, a mess sergeant of another battery, voluntarily and without orders ran 1,000 yards across the shell-swept area to the gun position. There he organized a volunteer squad which placed the gun back in commission and fired effectively against the enemy, although the position remained under constant and heavy Japanese artillery fire.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society\n\nPrivate\n\nJose B.

Nisperos became the first person of Asian descent to be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on Sept. 24, 1911, while engaged in combat at Lapurap, Basilan, Philippine Islands. He served in the 34th Company, Philippine Scouts. In 1913, having been badly wounded — his left arm was broken and lacerated and with several spear wounds in the body so that he could not stand — Nisperos continued to fire his rifle with one hand until the enemy was repulsed, thereby aiding materially in preventing the annihilation of his party.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society ."
