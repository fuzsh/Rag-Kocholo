        "text": "The possibility of a terrorist attack, while a constant concern for military leaders, was not at the forefront of American minds before the 9/11 attacks.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, there was the looming question in everyone's mind: Would Fort Bragg's elite fighting forces be deployed?\n\nNot only were Fort Bragg Special Forces soldiers among the first into Afghanistan as early as 2001, but Fort Bragg soldiers were also among the last to leave.\n\nAnd 2003, they would also deploy to Iraq.\n\n'We're under attack': Pope airmen recall where they were on 9/11 and the years that followed\n\nAt the wars' peak, tens of thousands of Fort Bragg troops were sent into the war zones. .\n\nHere’s a look at how Fort Bragg looked in the months before 9/11, the days and weeks after and the roles of the service members who served here and responded to the attacks.\n\nPost access before 9/11\n\nRestricting public access to military installations was discussed before 9/11, according to a 2001, Associated Press article.\n\nIn June 2001, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki announced that a system for registering cars belonging to soldiers and civilian workers would be in place by August.\n\nAt the time, “major” installations already had gate guards or some form of program for checking in visitors, then-Army spokesman Maj. Tom Collins said.\n\nThe directive, Collins said, was aimed at protecting against everything from burglaries to terrorist attacks, Collins said.\n\nThe Pentagon released an unclassified version of the USS Cole Commission Report, which called for preventing terrorist incidents, after an Oct. 12, 2000, bombing of the ship in Yemen, killing 17 sailors and injuring 39.\n\nSept. 11: On 9/11, this Fayettevillian saw both sides of the fight working as a soldier and firefighter\n\nTim Flynn, an FBI supervisory special agent in Wilmington, said at the time that Fort Bragg, was a “high-profile target,” because it was home to the 82nd Airborne Division, Special Forces and other well-known units.\n\nThe garrison commander at the time, Col. Tad Davis, said officials worked to identify vulnerabilities on post.\n\n''We believe that we are doing a good job in identifying threats, but have not eliminated the possibility of a no-notice terrorist attack,'' Davis said.\n\nFort Bragg was North Carolina’s last open military installationto allow open access.\n\nHow Fort Bragg looked after 9/11\n\nAccording to a Sept. 12, 2001, article, security across Fort Bragg was tightened immediately after the attacks.\n\nMilitary police at Fort Bragg manned gates and checked the identification of all those coming onto post.\n\nAccess to the post was restricted, training was curtailed and some facilities were closed.\n\nChallenging stereotypes: Muslim leaders in Fayetteville continue to challenge stereotypes 20 years after 9/11\n\nSoldiers stood guard over side roads and parking lots, making sure only essential military personnel entered.\n\nSteel gates at the entrance of the 82nd Airborne Division's headquarters were locked.\n\nFort Bragg’s schools also took precautions, with soldiers carrying M-4 assault rifles on guard.\n\nJudy Norris, an instructional systems specialist for Fort Bragg Schools, said at the time that the schools had crisis-response teams on hand to comfort and help students.\n\n''This is a trauma for everyone,'' Norris said. ''There are some images getting burned into little ones' minds.''\n\nReaction to the terrorist attacks was varied among soldiers, airmen and their family members.\n\nSome soldiers said the military response to the attacks should be swift and aimed at terrorist groups controlled by Osama bin Laden, founder of the militant Islamic group al-Qaeda which took responsibility for the attacks.\n\n''Somebody's messing with us, you got to show them who they are messing with,'' said Spc. Brian Leggett, a soldier in the 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment. '\n\nSgt. 1st Class Shelia Kirkley, a soldier part of the 189th Infantry Brigade, spoke about the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and said that she was upset thatbin Laden was still on the loose.\n\nTraffic onto Fort Bragg was backed up for hours in the days that followed, as security checks were enforced.\n\nBy October 2003, military police officers at Fort Bragg’s gates were replaced by security guards. Officials announced that construction of a 25-mile-long, 9-foot-high chain-link fence would be installed around the perimeter of the post.\n\n20th anniversary: Cumberland County teachers had to keep teaching despite horrors unfolding on 9/11\n\nCol. Gregory Bean, then the director of the Public Works Business Center at Fort Bragg, said at the time officials had once discussed installing a fence.\n\n''It just kind of sat idle until 9/11,'' he said.\n\nThe construction also included access control points, which remain at Fort Bragg today.\n\nFort Bragg reactions after 9/11\n\nWithin 24-hours of the attacks, military Humvees were patrolling post housing neighborhoods as soldiers checked for bombs and weapons.\n\n''You can just feel the tension,'' one spouse of a soldier said. ''You can see it in everybody's eyes.''\n\nJeremy Blevins, then a first lieutenant and platoon leader in the 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment\n\nsaid he didn’t see apprehension from the soldiers in his unit.\n\n''We have a real-world mission, a real threat,\" Blevins said. “They are enthused about work.”\n\nLt. Col. Valerie Ratliff, the first Black woman to command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division — the 782nd Main Support Battalion — lost a close friend on the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon.\n\n''It not only touched me to see our country go through this, but it hit me personally as well,'' Ratliff was quoted as saying.\n\nFort Bragg deployments\n\nBy Sept. 14, 2001, Fort Bragg sent five CH-47 Chinook helicopters and 32 crew members from the 159th Aviation Regiment, 18th Aviation Brigade to assist with relief efforts around the Pentagon.\n\nThe Army Special Operations Command announced by Sept. 23, 2001, that it would deploy troops in support of “Operation Infinite Justice.”\n\nAccording to an article in December 2014, Mark Schwartz was a Green Beret major when he became one of the first American soldiers to enter Afghanistan after 9/11.\n\n\"You can imagine, you've never been to combat before and you're going to get off an aircraft with yourself and about 10 of your closest friends and you're walking into an uncertain environment,\" he said.\n\nSchwartz said he and his team flew into northern Afghanistan from Central Asia to organize and assist the anti-Taliban forces.\n\nThe element's reports were sent to the secretary of defense nightly and provided the \"ground truth\" for leaders eagerly watching Afghanistan.\n\nOpinion: What 9/11 and Jan 6 have in common: Ignoring first responders\n\nOne key in the days after 9/11, Schwartz said then, was getting A-teams into Afghanistan before a potentially brutal winter set in.\n\n\"We really didn't know anything. We knew we were going to fly into a certain location and link up with an interagency team and they were going to introduce us to our Afghan counterparts, and then we just basically figured out the rest as we went,\" Schwartz said. \"And it went very well.\"\n\nUnder the leadership of the Special Forces teams, anti-Taliban militias swept across the country, liberating Kabul and moving east to Tora Bora.\n\nAs the first A-teams coordinated air support and began killing Taliban fighters, militia leaders realized how the U.S. teams could help them.\n\nIn the early days of the campaign, the Green Berets did not wear uniforms.\n\n\"We tried to blend in as best we could. And they welcomed us into their homes ... The Afghans took great care of us,\" he said.\n\nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visited Fort Bragg and then-Pope Air Force Base on Nov. 21, 2001, to thank the special operations forces, who helped coordinate ground conflict and pick targets for bombers.\n\nLt. Gen. Dan McNeill, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps, repeatedly said in 2001 he expected 18th Airborne Corps’ troops to have a role in the war.\n\n''Before this thing is all said and done, all of us will have a part of it, and we'll just get out there and get after it,'' McNeill said.\n\nThe Corps announced in May 2002 that its headquarters would deploy to Afghanistan.\n\nThe 82nd Airborne Division’s role was documented by a Fayetteville Observer correspondent in October 2002.\n\nAccording to the report, the paratroopers with the 3rd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment moved from village to village, hunting for al-Qaida terrorists or Taliban soldiers.\n\n\"This is how we fight wars now,\" Staff Sgt. Carmen Damiani was quoted as saying. “This is the way the enemy is. They are going to run. They are going to hide.”\n\nSome of the soldiers said the real enemy was across the border in Pakistan, where military leaders believed al-Qaida and Taliban fighters were hiding.\n\nBy February 2004, paratroopers started deployments to Iraq and Pope airmen deployed in April.\n\nSpecial Forces leaders decided to create Afghan army commandos, an elite group similar to Special Forces, in late 2006.\n\nStaff writer Rachael Riley can be reached at rriley@fayobserver.com or 910-486-3528.\n\nTimeline:\n\n• Sept. 12, 2001:\n\nSecurity checks create gridlock for soldiers and civilian workers trying to get onto Fort Bragg.
