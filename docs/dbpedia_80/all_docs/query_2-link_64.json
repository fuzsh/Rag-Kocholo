        "text": "Leaving On A Jet Plane\n\nBY DOUG DOBRANSKY\n\nMy flight to Vietnam was full of fierce anticipation and raw, killer-trained, anxious energy. Non-stop talking, agitation, and inner mental stirrings of what was coming. We sat backward in that C-141 Military Transport, without so much as a window, eyes bulging and not knowing anything about what was in store or where the hell we were headed.??But if I could relive one week of my life, it would be one year later, the first week of January 1968. I would want to walk the base camp with only two or three days left, being very careful not to do something stupidlike get killed at the last moment. I spent long nights lying awake, hearing explosions off in the distance while imagining my plane lifting off the ground out of Tan Son Nhut.\n\nAfter I said my goodbyes and gathered home addresses, I jumped into the truck that took me down Highway One to Saigon and the airbase. When we arrived at Tan Son Nhut, we grabbed our gear and moved quickly toward the departure area. We smoked and stood there, amazed at what was about to happen. There was little supervision: The NCOs seemed to realize we were golden. We were going home, and no one messed with anyone golden. Those were our last hours in the war zone, and we were righteous.??As the minutes went by, then an hour or so, a buzz rose from the crowd. A large jet was landing far up the long runway. It hit the runway steeply and ran along the tarmac, easing its way toward us. For some reason we all knew this plane was ours.\n\nIt came to a stop, and some long minutes passed. Then the door opened and out stepped a herd of young, shorn FNGs onto Vietnamese blacktop for the first time. I realized that some of those young faces would not return home. I felt sorry for them: for their fear and their uncertainty, for their hesitation and their ignorance. They had just stepped onto war-zone soil and were helpless. As they passed by, pathetic in their new fatigues and shiny boots, they stared at us and wanted desperately to know what to do to stay alive one more day. They knew we had survived and were going home.??As we walked toward the plane and that beautiful set of metal stairs, I looked back at that busy, crazy airstrip. Just another day for most of them on the ground, seeing off yet another group of lucky young men. I remember thinking how strange it all was that I came to this place a year earlier from a very small town in Ohio, and did what I did, and now I was perhaps going to get out of there in one pieceat least physically.\n\nThe beautiful stewardess at the top of the stairs snapped me out of my daze and brought me back to a very thrilling reality. Damn, she was good looking. I think her round eyes made her even more dazzling. But whatever it was, she fixed what was wrong with my head.\n\nAs we got seated and the door closed, we remained anxious that something was going to go wrong. They might say it was a mistake and we needed to deplane. There would be some mortar attack on the runway and we would have to hit the floor. Or we would be shot down taking off, since the greatest morale killer of all would be for the enemy to shoot down a planeload of young men on their last day in country.\n\nBut then the engines revved up and we started to move. The stewardesses made their announcements and prepared to take off. We felt the thud of liftoff and heard the grinding motors of the wheels being pulled into the belly of the plane. The steep angle was nearly vertical, much steeper than any of us had ever experienced. We found out later that planes took off and landed that way to minimize the chances of being shot down. The jet took us east above the coastline of South Vietnam and over the South China Sea. Then the pilot announced: “Gentlemen, we have left South Vietnam airspace.”\n\nThe plane erupted into vein-popping yells and screams, cheering, and noises. Everyone went nuts, and for the first time we all tried to believe it was true: We were no longer in Vietnam. We were really on our way back to our home. What a moment. The noise continued for a while, and everyone pushed to a window to see the dark blue-green ocean from 33,000 feet. But soon, one by one, we began to settle. I didn’t notice right away, but one man at a time, the plane began to quiet. An hour, then two, then six hours into the flight the darkness came and the reality of the day set in.\n\nThe plane was still. No one talked. Some slept, I guess, but when I looked around, I saw young men sitting or reading letters, a few writing something, but mostly I had the feeling of men getting hit with truth, the truth of knowing the next big thing was happening.\n\nWe were leaving that long year and those men we had gotten close to. We were going back home. Just hours out of the war zone, that plane with two hundred men was silent. It was very strange, that quiet. The thinking going on. I could feel it.\n\nSome large veil settled over us. We were thinking and trying to imagine how true or delusional it all was. Reviewing. Yes, that’s it: Reviewing all that had happened and just how the hell we got so lucky, and recalling the faces and names of those who were not.\n\n“Reviewing”: That’s the word that finally comes to me forty-six years later. That was the reason for all that quiet, all eighteen hours of it. Each of us in his own way was reviewing the surreal past year. That kind of reviewing takes some quiet. It was a strange plane to be on, with two hundred young men not making a sound.\n\nAt least not until many hours later when the pilot again flipped on his PA system to say the greatest words we had heard in a very long time: “Gentlemen, if you look out the left side of the plane, you will see the west coast of the United States of America.”\n\nOnce again life and youthful thrill filled the cabin. We teared up and began to scream and cheer. We were really home."
