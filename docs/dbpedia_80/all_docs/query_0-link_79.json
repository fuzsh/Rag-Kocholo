        "text": "FORT IRWIN, Calif.---The Army's chief of staff praised National Guard soldiers for persevering in the harsh desert and quickly learning the tough lessons of modern war when he visited a brigade of the Army's new active-reserve-integrated 24th Infantry Division at the National Training Center July 22.\n\n\"You're to be congratulated for the improvements this brigade has made during this rotation,\" Gen. Eric Shinseki told Brig. Gen. Earl Brown, a civilian pharmacist and commander of nearly 5,000 citizen-soldiers in the 218th Brigade Combat Team, South Carolina National Guard. The 218th is one of three Army Guard enhanced maneuver brigades that make up the active Army's recently reactivated 24th Infantry Division based at Fort Riley, Kan. The two other Guard brigades are located in North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nThe 24th Infantry Division at Riley and 7th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colo., both reactivated last year, are the first Army organizations that combine both active-duty and reserve-component soldiers in one military headquarters. The divisions each consist of three Army National Guard enhanced brigades with an active Army headquarters.\n\nFor the 218th Brigade Combat Team, the last three weeks in July have been crucial. The soldiers have spent two years preparing for their unit's first full-scale training rotation in southern California. \"Recognizing the situation and making the transition is the art of the business,\" Shinseki said, encouraging the brigade's bone-weary staff during the afternoon after the Guard troops had taken on the tough opposing home force, the Army's 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, for the third morning in six days.\n\n\"Tomorrow will be a better day,\" Shinseki told the citizen-soldiers who had one more battle, on July 25, to get in their licks before ending 10 days and nights of tactical training in the shadeless thousand square miles of Mojave Desert, beside Death Valley, where mid-day temperatures hit 120 degrees.\n\nShinseki has taken every opportunity to tell the Army National Guard and Army Reserve they are full partners in America's Army since becoming chief of staff 13 months ago. He delivered that message to members of the Texas Army Guard's 49th Armored Division last November at Fort Polk, La., as they were preparing for this year's command and control mission in Bosnia.\n\nHis trip to the National Training Center in California reinforced his support for giving the Guard tough, realistic training. \"There is no better way to replicate the fog of war than here at the National Training Center,\" acknowledged Lt. Col. Greg Batts, commander of South Carolina's 1st Battalion, 118th Infantry, one of the brigade's major units. Batts is a special operations police lieutenant in Charleston. \"To quote the post commander, Army units don't get trained up here,\" Batts added. \"Units leave here ready to train.\"\n\nThe brigade, supported by nearly 2,000 more citizen-soldiers in the Palmetto State Task Force, has already trained in many ways to pull off what is said to be the largest peacetime deployment of National Guard forces in history. More than $21 million has been budgeted for the entire exercise, South Carolina Guard officials reported.\n\nAlthough South Carolina has fielded the bulk of the force, citizen-soldiers and airmen from 26 other states are engaged in the cross-country mission that will end on July 30. More than 1,800 tanks, armored fighting vehicles and other pieces of equipment were hauled from South Carolina to California on railroad cars and trucks. Seven Apache attack helicopters were flown down from Idaho to beef up the brigade's 373-soldier aviation task force. Still other helicopters were flown from the East Coast on C-5 cargo planes. The vast array of ground vehicles were unloaded in Yermo, Calif., and convoyed across the desert to Fort Irwin for two weeks.\n\nIt is, however, the citizen-soldiers who are improving the brigade's combat capabilities every day while living the Spartan life of the infantry. They are sleeping under the Milky Way on cots beside their trucks and tanks. They are eating combat rations and drinking all of the water and Gatorade they can carry. Heated meals in the evening and the tons of ice shipped to the field every day to fill their coolers are among their few luxuries.\n\n\"This gives you the chance to escape from the complexities of life and get out here and live very basically. Most people never get the chance to do that,\" said South Carolina Army Guard Sgt. Steve Legette, 25, a high school physical education teacher and football coach from Charleston.\n\n\"If you get ice and a hot meal, your day is made,\" added Legette who spent his 10 days of tactical training in the Mojave driving an armored personnel carrier. \"It makes you appreciate what you have when you go home.\"\n\nA handshake and a few words of encouragement from the Army's top soldier on July's final Saturday made it clear to many of the Army Guard soldiers that their long days and nights in the desert are paying off.\n\n(by Master Sgt. Bob Haskell and Sgt. 1st Class Dan Brazell, Army News Service)\n\n-ends-"
