        "text": "In the end, the soldiers of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard came home from Bosnia without using the ammunition they took there.\n\nIn nearly eight months overseeing American peacekeepers in Bosnia, they never fired a shot, either intentionally against enemies of peace in that tense land or accidentally when clearing their weapons as a safety measure when entering buildings on their base near Tuzla.\n\nThat they never engaged in combat is a measure of the stability taking root in Bosnia. That they never slipped up on firearms safety is in some ways just as important a measure of the military discipline that some have long felt is lacking in the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard.\n\n''Not everybody in the National Guard is as screwed up as they thought we were,'' Specialist Frank T. Hinnant 3d of Bellville, Tex., said in an interview in Bosnia just before returning home.\n\nOn Thursday, in a traditional rite that included a Russian military band playing ''The Yellow Rose of Texas,'' the division relinquished its command of the American NATO sector in Bosnia, rolling up its battle flag and turning over the operation to the regular Army's 3d Infantry Division.\n\nToday, the last of some 650 men and women of the 49th returned to the division's headquarters at Camp Mabry in Austin, tearfully reuniting with their families eight months to the day after President Clinton called them away to active duty.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
