        "text": "When General Eric K. Shinseki became the Army’s thirty-fourth Chief of Staff, in June of 1999, he declared that he would transform the ponderous Cold War force that stared down the Soviets for half a century into something more useful in the disordered new millennium. He said that he wanted an Army that was nimble, light, and lethal, a force supple enough to perform peacekeeping missions or to fight an all-out war against a country like North Korea or Iraq. He said he would wean the Army from the tanks and armored fighting vehicles it loves, and replace them with systems so advanced that they couldn’t be detected by the enemy, using technology not yet invented. And he wanted these changes accomplished before the end of this decade—by Army standards, nearly instantaneously.\n\nAn earlier reformist Chief, General Creighton W. Abrams, once said of the Army’s native intransigence, “If I can move the Army one degree, I will have considered my tenure a success.” Shinseki promised the most drastic change undertaken by an Army Chief since the late nineteen-thirties, when George C. Marshall transformed a small peacetime force into the mighty Army that won the Second World War. Shinseki expected the institution to resist his program, and it did, fiercely. Sometimes the resistance was open, and sometimes the work of opposition was left to the quiet grind of the bureaucratic wheel; there are many stories of mandates from on high getting “lost” in some resistant colonel’s filing cabinet. Shinseki worried that the institution would simply wait him out—he is entering the final year of a four-year term—and then let transformation die. Still, he persisted. He believed that it had fallen to him to save the Army from irrelevance, by saving the Army from itself.\n\nShinseki represented a rare form of the organizational man—the consummate careerist, wholly a product of his institution, yet able to perceive the organization’s flaws with an outsider’s clarity. On becoming the Army’s top bureaucrat, Shinseki realized that even in the epoch of American military dominance the institution was in danger of finding its place in the world severely diminished. Operationally, the Army was too big and too slow to get to a fight quickly. Politically, the low-tech, high-cost Army stood to suffer in the competition for money and favor with its more glamorous sister services operating from the sea and, especially, from the air and space.\n\nShinseki warned his reluctant subordinates more than once, “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance a lot less.” He worried that if the Army didn’t move decisively toward change, change would be imposed by the political structure—and not on the Army’s terms. With the election of George W. Bush, he was proved right.\n\nAt first, the new Bush defense team and Shinseki seemed perfectly suited. As a candidate, Bush had placed military transformation at the center of his defense platform, declaring that the Army “must be agile, lethal, readily deployable, and require a minimum of logistical support.” He has repeatedly sounded those themes as President, employing almost precisely the same language that Shinseki used when he announced his transformation plans, in the fall of 1999. But the transformation advocated by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his circle is viewed by many in the Army, including Shinseki, with deep suspicion, in part because it envisions conflicts in the Information Age being fought and won mostly from the air and from space, with satellites, sensors, and precision weapons. Implicit in this thinking (though rarely expressed) is a diminished role in future wars for ground forces.\n\nThe antagonism between the Army and Rumsfeld’s office has become so pronounced that some Army officers have come to refer to Rumsfeld and his team as “the enemy.” The cover of the current Armed Forces Journal International features a photograph of Rumsfeld and asks, “Does he really hate the Army?”\n\nIn effect, the advent of the Bush team opened a second front with which Shinseki has had to contend. Not only does he have to persuade the Army to transform, he also has to argue for the Army’s utility in war. At the heart of this argument is the belief that no technological wizardry can eliminate the risks of close combat, and that even the new, unconventional conflicts that loom will ultimately hinge on the skill, commitment, and courage of the American soldier.\n\nThe Army is organized into ten active-duty divisions—six heavy divisions and four light divisions. Broadly put, the brigades, battalions, and companies within a heavy division are organized around the conveyances—tanks or Bradley fighting vehicles—that take that unit to the fight. The brigades in a light division, such as the 82nd Airborne, are organized around the infantrymen who parachute, march, or helicopter to the fight.\n\nThe need for reform has been apparent since February 28, 1991, the day that the first President Bush declared victory in the Gulf War. The desert war revealed two potentially disastrous flaws: the Army’s light forces weren’t lethal enough to stop Saddam Hussein by themselves, and the armored units were so heavy that it took them months to reach the battlefield.\n\nAlmost immediately after the Iraqi Army took Kuwait, on August 2, 1990, the 82nd Airborne was alerted for action. Within a week, three battalions of the 82nd’s infantrymen, about four thousand soldiers, had arrived in Saudi Arabia and begun to dig in around Dhahran, establishing a line of defense in case the Iraqi offensive continued across the Saudi border. It was a tenuous line. The 82nd is a contingency force, designed to parachute into a theatre of war, seize an objective, and then hold it for up to three days. The battalions in Saudi Arabia were supported by some Apache attack helicopters, a few aluminum-sided Sheridan tanks (so thin they can be pierced by machine-gun fire), and howitzers and mortars, but their principal source of firepower was the M16 rifles carried by the infantrymen. The airborne force can be inserted into a war zone quickly, but, once there, it is essentially immobile; without personnel carriers, the unit’s mode of transportation is by foot. Powerful American armored units eventually arrived, but until the end of August the 82nd faced Saddam’s vast array of armored forces virtually on its own.\n\n“We held our breath,” Shinseki later said. “It was not the fight that we would have scripted.” Had Iraqi tanks pushed across the Saudi line and engaged the 82nd, the result would have been “a slaughter,” in the words of the Army’s chief of military history, Brigadier General John S. Brown. So inadequate was the American force that some in the unit later referred to themselves as “speed bumps.” But, for reasons that are still not fully understood, Saddam held back, giving the United States and its allies time to amass a force of overwhelming advantage. In the second month, heavy divisions had begun to arrive: about a hundred and twenty-eight thousand infantrymen, with nearly six hundred Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks. On the eve of the war, in January, 1991, the Army had two hundred thousand soldiers in the theatre, including most of the VII Corps, which had been moved to the desert from Germany. The five-month buildup was a monumental achievement, but that very fact should have sounded alarms in the American military.\n\nThe Gulf War gave the Army a rare opportunity to gaze upon itself in full portrait. It was a magnificent Cold War force, perfectly suited for the war it was designed to fight: a mammoth counterstrike against an invading Soviet Army on the plains of Central Europe. The Army’s institutional identity reflected that principal mission. Its jewels were its heavy pieces, and its most prized commands were those organized around the armored vehicles, especially the near-invincible Abrams tank (not one of which was destroyed by the enemy in the Gulf War).\n\nThe Abrams, which was first completed in 1980, is a peerless war machine not only because it can kill enemy tanks at “standoff” range—beyond the reach of enemy fire—but because it can survive almost any strike. The reason for this is its armor—a layer of metal protection so thick that the tank weighs seventy tons. But the Abrams is too big to be transported efficiently to the battlefield by air, and has to be transported by ship, a process that can take weeks. Then, once it is in the theatre and moving on its own, it guzzles fuel: an Abrams gets about half a mile to the gallon. A huge fuel supply has to follow the tanks and other armored vehicles to war, adding to a division’s enormous “logistics tail.” More than eighty per cent of the heavy Army’s lift requirement—the effort of getting itself to war—is devoted to support units, such as those handling fuel, spare parts, maintenance, and so on. The matérial that has to be loaded, transported, unloaded, and set up just to support the fighting is aptly called the “iron mountain.”\n\nIn a way, Desert Storm was the war for which the Army had prepared itself for half a century but had never fought. In winning so decisively, the force validated its combat structures and doctrines, but it also hastened its own obsolescence. Iraq had vividly demonstrated the unprofitability of a head-on fight against seven American Army divisions. No other adversary would likely try it soon, and the Soviet Union was gone. The force was unlikely ever again to fight the sort of fight for which it was designed.\n\nThe moment of victory was the perfect chance for the Army’s leaders to fix the “speed bump” problem of its contingency units, and to redesign the force for a new array of adversaries. But the Army’s leaders, luxuriating in the triumph, and trying to weather a drastic downsizing, which reduced the force by nearly forty per cent in the nineteen-nineties, did neither.\n\n“It was the euphoria of our victory,” Shinseki says. “When you’re decisively victorious, you have a tendency to look at what went well. We got in there, we kicked Saddam’s butt. And if you as a professional don’t go back and ask the hard questions you can miss some warts. We did. I mean, it was a double win: we won the Cold War, we won the last battle of the Cold War. Aren’t we brave? We downsized the force, and we got back to living the life of the great American society. We, the Army, just didn’t pay attention to all the lessons that came out of Desert Storm. There were a few.”\n\nIf Shinseki somehow prevails in his transformation campaign, it will not be a victory won by force of personality. He is a man of slight bearing, with a polite and intractable reserve—a West Point engineer who also has a degree in English literature from Duke. Although he has a facility with language, he tends to speak in the bureaucratic monotone of the military, which gives his conversations a boilerplate quality. In promoting Army transformation, he has demonstrated a near-phobic reluctance to engage the press. His official Web site has pages devoted to “Speeches,” “Testimony,” and “Professional Reading List,” but, three years into his tenure, the page marked “Interviews” remains blank.\n\nShinseki’s emergence as a reformist chief surprised nearly everyone. He was the Vice-Chief of Staff when the top job opened in 1999, and he seems to have been selected more or less because he was the convenient choice; it certainly wasn’t because he had a reputation as an Army dissident. At the time, President Clinton had just survived an impeachment trial, and his Vice-President was starting his own campaign; wrothing up the military was the last thing Clinton wanted to do. Shinseki seemed uncontroversial—a careerist who happened to be next in line.\n\nShinseki began his life officially categorized as an enemy of the United States. He was born in Lihue, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, in November, 1942, eleven months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. His grandfather was a plantation laborer who immigrated to Hawaii from Hiroshima, and his parents were nisei, American-born children of Japanese immigrants, who, despite being citizens, were classified as enemy aliens. “On December 7th, it was obvious that those who bombed Pearl Harbor looked like us,” Senator Daniel Inouye, of Hawaii, who was a senior in high school at the time, and is a friend of Shinseki’s, said recently. “For all we know, they might have been cousins. And the nation reacted in a way that was, or should have been, anticipated. They were angry, like all of us. Some of that anger was turned upon us—American citizens.”\n\nThe nisei were classic assimilationists, eager to prove their loyalty, but for a time they were prohibited from serving in the United States military. When President Roosevelt lifted the restriction, nisei men flooded the enlistment offices; about eighteen thousand joined. Many of them served in the 100th Infantry Battalion or the 442nd Regiment, which became legendary fighting forces. (The 442nd was the war’s most decorated combat unit, and suffered one of the highest casualty rates.)\n\nThe returning Japanese Americans were accorded a reverence that changed Hawaii’s sociopolitical landscape. When some of them, like Inouye, whose right arm was shattered while attacking a German machine-gun nest, stood for election, Japanese Americans voted them into office, wresting control of the territorial government from the planter class and the Republican Party. After statehood came, in 1959, the former soldiers were sent to Washington as Hawaii’s congressmen and senators.\n\nThree of Shinseki’s uncles served with Inouye, and they held young Eric captive with their dinner-table war stories. “They really believed in the United States, and they tried to explain to him why they felt they were obligated to the United States,” Paul Shinseki, Eric’s older brother, recalls.\n\nShinseki embodied the nineteen-fifties ideal of the straight-arrow, all-American boy. As a Boy Scout, he was awarded the God and Country emblem; at the state Hi-Y model legislature, he was elected governor; at Kauai High School, he was student-body president. His sweetheart, Patty Yoshinobu, who is now his wife, was homecoming queen at Waimea High. When it came time for college, Shinseki had his pick; he chose West Point, and Inouye nominated him.\n\nSix months after graduating, Second Lieutenant Shinseki was rushed to Vietnam as a forward observer in an artillery unit. Because he had not yet taken the Army’s basic artillery course, he had to make do with a crash course from a buck sergeant named Ernie Kingcade, who tutored him aboard the troopship General Walker. Kingcade was impressed. “A lot of those West Point graduates don’t really like to listen to noncoms, because they have an education and most of your noncoms, like me, really just had a high-school education,” Kingcade recalls. “But he was willing to listen.’’\n\nShinseki’s job as a forward observer was to “hump the field” with his platoon until they encountered the enemy, and then to radio back the location coördinates to the artillery battery, which would deliver cannon fire from its howitzers. It was meat-grinder duty, and Shinseki had been in Vietnam less than three months when the infantry company he was attached to was hit by a predawn mortar assault near the Cambodian border. Shinseki and a sergeant named Leslie Cotten were bedded down under a tree. “They dropped eighty-five mortar rounds on top of us,” Cotten recalls. “Ric was wounded, I was wounded. I had shrapnel in my back, between my spine and my shoulder blade. But Ric put me on a medevac chopper that night.” Cotten recovered in Japan, and when he returned to combat duty he learned that Shinseki had been seriously wounded in a helicopter crash. Cotten visited Shinseki in the hospital, and he wasn’t optimistic. “The injuries he’d had were pretty bad,” Cotten recalls. “Head and chest. It was like the helicopter threw him out and rolled over on him. And the shape he was in, I didn’t feel he would make it, and, if he did, he would be in bad shape the rest of his life.”\n\nShinseki spent the next seven months recovering from his injuries at Tripler Army Medical Center, in Honolulu. Once he was well, he attended advanced armor school, was promoted to captain, and received his first command—an armored cavalry unit in Vietnam. He took charge of the unit in February, 1970; seven weeks later, he stepped on a mine, losing his right foot and part of the lower leg. He was again evacuated to Tripler hospital, and stayed there for a year.\n\nShinseki’s family assumed that his military career was over. “We felt that physically he couldn’t continue,” Paul Shinseki recalls. There was much to recommend an exit to civilian life. The uniform Ric Shinseki had grown up admiring had become an object of scorn, and the war in Vietnam was drawing toward its gloomy conclusion. During those months of recovery, Ric and Patty all but decided that he would leave the Army and study law. He applied to the University of Michigan Law School, and then changed his mind. Even now, he has some difficulty saying why.\n\nHe stayed in the Army “for reasons that are mighty difficult to explain,” he says, and leaves it there. Pressed, he hesitates for a moment, perhaps sensing that his answer will sound like a Boy Scout God and Country essay. “I discovered that the Army was losing a lot of quality officers,” he says. “People were leaving in droves. I thought that maybe some of us who had been through the experience in Vietnam had to hang around and make sure that whatever learning came out of that would somehow be captured, retained, and passed along. And so I chose to stay.”\n\nActually, because of his injuries and the time he had lost—he had fallen nearly two years behind his West Point class in career advancement—he had to fight to stay. He prevailed only after a major in Army personnel pleaded Shinseki’s case to the Secretary of the Army. “That’s what he wanted,” Paul Shinseki says. “He felt honored, and because of his uncles, and all of the family, he felt that that was the thing to do.”\n\n“I think he felt that he owed America something,” Inouye says. “After all, it gave him his education at West Point. The least he can do is to repay this great land, and do so with honor.”\n\nShinseki told the Army that he would accept any assignment, and that he would make himself responsible for reaching and maintaining the necessary physical requirements. “He was strong enough, and although he has an artificial foot, he worked hard,” Paul says. “He is so determined, you know.”\n\nAs a colonel stationed in Germany in the nineteen-eighties, Shinseki commanded part of the Cold War American force that was bulked up and “leaning east” against the prospect of a Soviet invasion. He was commander of a heavy brigade at the moment the Soviet Union collapsed; less than a decade later, he was commanding a peacekeeping force in the chaos of Bosnia. It was plain to Shinseki that, like it or not, the world’s messy regional conflicts were in the Army’s future, and that the Army wasn’t ready.\n\nIn 1998, Shinseki became Vice-Chief of Staff, serving under General Dennis Reimer, who had transformation notions of his own. At that time, a drastic reorganization of the Army’s echelon structure, in order to make it leaner and more efficient, was outlined in a book entitled “Breaking the Phalanx: A New Design for Landpower in the 21st Century,” by Colonel Douglas A. Macgregor. Reimer liked the idea, and he ordered copies of the book distributed to every general in the Army. The senior officers resisted. Reimer didn’t press the issue, and the moment passed.\n\nDuring the nineteen-nineties, the Army found itself consigned to missions that it did not welcome and was ill-equipped to perform. The old, heavy Army, poised for its marquee confrontation with the Soviets, had known exactly who the enemy was, how it would fight, and where. But its two big vehicles, the Abrams tank and the Bradley, didn’t share a common chassis, so each required its own iron mountain. The Army dealt with this logistics problem by positioning fuel, spare parts, and support matérial in the theatre in advance, and it dealt with the vehicles’ weight problem—a Bradley weighs thirty tons—by reinforcing the various German bridges the vehicles would likely have to cross to engage the Soviet armor. In 1995, however, when a mechanized infantry brigade tried to make its way in Bosnia, it got bogged down on the inferior roads and bridges of the Balkans. In Haiti, in 1994, Bradley fighting vehicles rolled off transport ships at Cap Haitien but couldn’t move two blocks beyond the port because of their bulk. The bitterest lesson came last, in the Kosovo war.\n\nPresident Clinton committed America to that conflict only after declaring that the use of ground forces was “off the table” as an option, a decision that quickly proved to be a mistake. After more than a month of bombing, in April of 1999, General Wesley K. Clark, who was in command, publicly suggested that air strikes alone were not stopping the Serbs. Clark furiously lobbied Washington for permission to at least prepare for a ground presence, as did Britain’s Prime Minister Tony Blair. Clark finally got approval to deploy (but not employ) the Army’s Apache attack helicopters, and a five-thousand-man unit, dispatched to Tirana, Albania, to support them. The mission was called Task Force Hawk. In Washington, Shinseki had argued against the use of helicopters in the mission, because the Apaches were designed to support troops fighting on the ground— not the other way around. Task Force Hawk was a fiasco: the Serb Army maneuvered at will in Kosovo, as armored American units, mired in mud, watched helplessly from the other side of bridges they couldn’t get across. The Apaches never got into the war, but two Army pilots died while training in Albania—the only Americans killed in the conflict. After Russia withdrew its support for Serbia, the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, agreed to negotiate a peace. The strange war ended on June 10, 1999, an indecisive victory for NATO and air power, and a profound embarrassment for the United States Army. Those were the circumstances under which, eleven days later, Clinton appointed Shinseki Chief of Staff.\n\nThe failure of Task Force Hawk made it clear that the 82nd’s “speed bump” status in the Gulf War and the crippling of armored units in the Balkans by their own heft were two sides of the same problem. A new Chief of Staff would have a mandate to address what was now an obvious operational gap between the Army’s light units, which were too vulnerable, and its heavy units, which were too slow. Devising some sort of medium-weight combat unit would be an achievement, and also a way of continuing to avoid the larger question that the top brass had been avoiding for a decade: whether the United States Army needed to reinvent itself for the post-Cold War world. Shinseki decided to address the larger question of transformation as well.\n\nShinseki’s idea of a relevant future Army—what he calls the Objective Force—appeals to the civilian command authority that will pay for it and decide its role in war. Such an Army, Shinseki posits, can engage in conflicts ranging from peacekeeping to urban combat to conventional war against a regional power such as North Korea or Iraq. It won’t know where the next fight will be, so it can’t pre-position supplies. Its vehicles will share a common chassis, and they’ll be small enough to fit into a C-130, the military’s most readily available transport plane, which is able to land on almost any straight stretch of road. The Objective Force, Shinseki promises, will be able to move a brigade anywhere in the world in ninety-six hours, a Gulf War-size force in a month.\n\nShinseki spent his first year as Chief of Staff “walking transformation around in small groups,” as he puts it. He appeared before the Army’s annual armor conference, he gave a speech to the infantry conference, he spoke to each of the branches’ schools about the urgent need to transform. “Didn’t get much traction, though,” he says.\n\nPart of the problem was the Army’s deeply fragmented culture. Shinseki’s plan to blend elements of the light and heavy sides of the Army creates a more generalized orientation, and the Army cherishes its specialization. A cadet at West Point chooses his branch during his senior year at the Academy, and it’s a bit like belonging to a fraternity, with a set of rituals, traditions, and even greetings. (“Rangers lead the way!”) “What people thought about transformation, the need for it, had a lot to do with where they came from,” Shinseki says. “And none of them saw transformation as something necessarily that they needed to think about.”\n\nShinseki’s plan seemed elegantly simple. For the near term, the Army would create a new type of brigade, a medium-weight unit known as a Stryker Brigade, that could get to a fight almost as quickly as the 82nd but could maneuver once it got there, and even destroy tanks if it had to. The new unit would be composed of existing elements, and would be placed within the Army’s traditional divisional structure. In that sense, the new brigade is Shinseki’s Trojan horse—slipping the Army of the future within the walls of the old Army in the form of a medium-weight unit that everyone agrees is necessary right now.\n\nThe new Stryker Brigade is organized around lightly armored vehicles, each weighing less than twenty tons—meaning that they can fit into a C-130. It combines elements of both the light and the heavy armies, packaged into one unit. Its vehicles will provide armor protection and battlefield mobility that a light brigade doesn’t have; its artillery battalion’s howitzers will give it more power. A tank brigade that is being transformed into a Stryker Brigade will lose armor and punch, but it will gain agility, and therefore (the theory goes) operational relevance.\n\nPart of the purpose of the Stryker Brigade is to propel transformation forward, creating new war doctrines and procedures that will suit the coming Objective Force. When Shinseki’s order to create the new brigades came down, in October, 1999, Lieutenant Colonel Mick Nicholson was commanding a battalion of mechanized infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington, in the first heavy brigade to be transformed. After Nicholson exchanged his Bradleys for leased Canadian light-armor vehicles, he reconfigured his battalion with its new components and tried to determine how it would fight. Old doctrine featured a straightforward operation called “movement to contact,” in which, he says, “you set up a formation, you move until you make contact with the enemy, and then you maneuver on him to defeat him. The whole notion is, I don’t know where he is, I need to go find him and destroy him.”\n\nBut what worked for an infantry battalion riding in thirty-ton Bradleys is hardly suitable for light-armor vehicles, which can be destroyed by the Soviet-made rocket-propelled grenades that are common in every back-alley hot spot in the world. The Stryker Brigades will depend heavily upon information technology, and enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, to compensate for their lack of armored protection. Nicholson and his fellow-officers had to write a new doctrine, based on stealth. “While we might in the future accidentally make contact with the enemy, that type of operation is going to fall down to the bottom of your list,” Nicholson says. “Rather, you’re going to go find him with your intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capability, then you’re going to maneuver out of contact, and make contact with him in a time and place of your choosing, not by accidentally stumbling into him. That fundamentally changes how you think about how you fight.”\n\nSubstituting information for armor is a discomfiting notion to a tank soldier, but Major General Jim Dubik, who commanded the Bradleys that failed to perform in Haiti in 1994, and subsequently oversaw the early development of the Stryker Brigades, says that the soldiers will learn that battlefield awareness can be as comforting as armor. “You gain protection from situational understanding,” Dubik says. “If you know something bad’s going to happen, you don’t go there. You’ve just protected yourself.” This strikes some as a wishful view, and one that rests on the assumption that the military’s communications architecture will not be knocked out in war by, say, the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion.\n\nOne of the problems the Army hasn’t solved yet is what will take the place of the Abrams tank when the Objective Force is fielded—or whether whatever it is will even be a “tank,” as such. The Abrams became a behemoth—”a Maginot Line on rollers,” as the military theorist William Lind puts it—because it was designed to take a hit and keep fighting. Shinseki put before the Army a radically different proposition: “I would like to know whether we can design systems that can’t be hit.”\n\nThe Abrams’ replacement is being called the Future Combat System, and the Army hasn’t yet come close to figuring out how to make it weigh less than twenty tons, much less how to make it invisible in battle. Military researchers have been experimenting with new lightweight materials and with the technologies used in the Air Force’s stealth bombers, but the Army’s first estimated delivery date for any new system was 2018. Shinseki insisted upon a delivery date of 2010, and then moved that up to 2008. “We are collapsing the traditional time lines,” Shinseki says, in what his acquisitions people would consider to be a gross understatement. It is a consummate act of faith, because the Army ordered its last Abrams tanks this year.\n\nThe Army and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, are spending a billion dollars on developing technologies for the future weapons system. One of DARPA’s proposals is to create a “distributed tank”—a tank whose principal components, such as guns and sensors, are mounted on separate vehicles that would be controlled remotely by a soldier in yet another command vehicle. It would be able to see enemy tanks from afar through the eyes of “aerial loiterers”—drone aircraft that hover over the battlefield. Its weapons might include lasers and electromagnetic guns, and its logistics tail could be reduced by a fuel system that makes water as a by-product.\n\nToward the end of Shinseki’s first year on the job, the Washington Times, quoting anonymous sources, reported, “The Army is losing support for its far-reaching transformation plan from the people it needs most—the generals. . . . One aide who recently talked with a group of generals said he was stunned at the unanimity of opposition. ‘No one likes it,’ said this source, who declined to reveal the generals’ names.” One of the unnamed generals complained of “a huge lack of clarity on what the transformation is supposed to do,” and, saying that there was no way a twenty-ton tank could replace an Abrams, suggested that as far as reform is concerned the Army should “declare victory and get out of this game.”\n\nShinseki’s plans have distressed constituencies inside the Army and out, including people on active duty, in the influential retired-officer corps, in the defense industry, and in Congress, where even such pro-reform legislators as Senator Joseph Lieberman, of Connecticut, urged him to slow down. “He was very lonely,” Robert E. Quinn, a University of Michigan Business School management expert recruited by Shinseki to help sell change to the Army’s senior leaders, says. “People were saying, ‘This guy’s not very bright, he’s doing stupid things, he’s going to get chewed up—why would he do this?’ “ Senator Inouye told Shinseki, “You would not make a very good politician.”\n\nOne of Shinseki’s first acts was to issue a reading list, ranging from “The Killer Angels,” Michael Shaara’s Gettysburg saga, for junior enlistees, to the works of Thucydides and Clausewitz, for his generals. Such reading lists are not unusual. But perhaps the most studied volume in Shinseki’s Army was Dr. Spencer Johnson’s self-help book “Who Moved My Cheese?” Under Shinseki’s direction, the Army ordered the book in bulk; his staff handed out copies with a note bearing personal greetings from the Chief. “Who Moved My Cheese?” became a central element of the Army Senior Leadership Conference, a series of six-day courses for one- and two-star generals which Shinseki instituted last year. In hotel conference rooms, groups of two dozen or so generals would be told to imagine themselves as Sniff and Scurry (a pair of mice) and Hem and Haw (two “littlepeople”), the central characters in Johnson’s tale. After learning that their traditional supply of cheese is no longer available, the mice and Haw make their way out into a maze in search of new cheese. Along the way, Haw experiences enlightenment through a series of revelations, such as “The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese.” Hem, however, refuses to adjust to his new circumstances and is left behind. After screening a video version of the tale, a civilian Army consultant instructed each of the participants to talk about what he had seen in the story. Later, these generals were divided into teams and told to identify “three elements of old cheese” in the Army before reporting back to the civilian instructor.\n\nShinseki’s most controversial move, however, occurred at the beginning of his second year as Chief. “You sort of come to the point where you need to reach inside the chest cavity of the institution and give it a good squeeze,” he said recently. In October, 2000, Shinseki ordered that every soldier in the Army be issued a black beret; previously, black berets had been worn only by the élite Rangers. Shinseki’s advisers liken the gesture to Gideon’s smashing the altar of Baal, or Lee Iacocca’s burning of the last of the Chrysler gas guzzlers as it came off the assembly line, as a gesture of a new era. But the response was more like that which greeted the introduction of the New Coke.\n\nShinseki had meant the berets to unify the Army behind transformation, “to drive down the walls within the institution.” The Rangers, Shinseki now concedes, in a characteristic understatement, “were very vocal” in their opposition. “There was some concern.”\n\nThe Ranger Web site exploded with invective, and the Ranger battle cry over the berets, “Earned, Not Issued,” can still be heard, eighteen months later. The Rangers were not alone in their outrage. The beret decision touched a deeper chord in the military, where, after eight years of the Clinton Administration, many felt estranged from the civilian command authority. Shinseki was a Clinton appointee, and the beret decision seemed another insult to the military culture by the “pencil-pushing, boot-licking, sycophantic desk jockeys in the Pentagon who have genuflected in the direction of the Draft Dodger these long eight years,” as one Web posting phrased it. Another posting called it a “snap decision based on pseudo-psychology that giving somebody something of value makes one valuable.” Shinseki eventually agreed to let the Rangers switch to tan berets, but the episode damaged him and weakened support within the Officer Corps for his less trivial reform notions. And he needed the Army’s support, for if he was moving too fast for the traditionalists he was moving not fast enough for the new Bush Administration.\n\nThe idea of military transformation, simmering for years, has been aptly likened to religious faith, so varied are its doctrines, and so dearly are they held by their adherents. All believe that the fall of the Soviet Union disordered the world, that the rise of the microchip made new modes of combat possible, and that the Army must change if it is to successfully fight the nation’s wars. Most agree that the Army is too cumbersome, and that the main battle tanks are dinosaurs. After that, the doctrines diverge. Colonel Macgregor, something of a cult figure among Army reformers, argues in “Breaking the Phalanx” that the Army should do away with its divisional structure (which dates back to Napoleon) and reorganize into smaller combat units that can move quickly and fight alongside elements of the other services. Shinseki says that he sees virtue in Macgregor’s ideas, but decided that doing away with divisions, each a repository of sacred lore, insignia, and tradition, would cause such tumult that the rest of his transformation would stall.\n\nAnother officer in the Army’s reform underground, Major Donald Vandergriff, argues that the Army’s personnel-management system stifles innovation, rewards careerism, and punishes creativity in the officer ranks. Like many reformers, Vandergriff has been influenced by the ideas of William Lind, the military theorist, who is one of the creators of a theory called Fourth Generation Warfare. The theory holds that the first three generations of warfare are passé, and that the Fourth Generation—asymmetric warfare, such as terrorism—is now upon us. Lind worries that Shinseki’s new Stryker Brigades may be coöpted by the institutional Army. “The Army is like the Soviet-refrigerator industry in funny green suits,” Lind says, because “it isn’t about producing a product, it’s about acquiring and justifying resources.”\n\nThat description may have characterized the view of the Army held by George Bush’s new defense team as it settled into office last year. Bush is said to have chosen Donald Rumsfeld for Secretary of Defense because of his reputation as a deft political infighter, and one thing that the new Secretary meant to be ruthless about was military transformation. Bush had promised the nation a comprehensive review of the military, and he gave Rumsfeld “a broad mandate to challenge the status quo.” Even in its downsized state, the Army presented a fat target, as the biggest of the services. (The Army has 480,000 active members, as against 375,000 in the Navy, 359,000 in the Air Force, and 175,000 in the Marines; and it has a personnel budget of $27.1 billion for the active Army in 2003, while the Navy and Air Force will spend $22 billion each, and the Marines $8.6 billion.)\n\nRumsfeld is an adherent of what is known in think tanks and policy seminars as Revolution in Military Affairs, or R.M.A. The theory attaches paramount importance to micro-technology and its effect on military affairs—which is to say, it puts its faith in the effectiveness of the long-distance precision strike. R.M.A. beholds the battlefield of tomorrow, and sees a lesser place for yesterday’s soldiers, who fight in formations that Napoleon would have recognized. Rumsfeld personally has a vested belief in weaponized space and the National Missile Defense system, having headed the commission that in 1999 helped to persuade the Clinton Administration to push ahead with missile defense. His staff’s long-range projections envision threats not from Europe, where the Army is heavily positioned, but from Asia—possible conflicts in which Navy missiles and Air Force precision bombs would be the preferred assets.\n\nThe United States Army’s anguish over its relevance in a time of war stems only partly from the institution’s own lassitude. The Army is too big and too slow, but its relevance has also been diminished by a confluence of politics and technology. The lopsided ground war in Iraq, for instance, was preceded by the most destructive and effective bombing campaign in military history, a spectacular, televised air show of “smart” bombs, Patriot missiles, and ship-launched Tomahawks whistling through downtown Baghdad. Shinseki says, “What happened in Desert Storm is you got to see a lot of laser-guided bombs, and everyone became fascinated by them. And we walked away from there with this idea that, if you could hit everything with an accurate bomb, you could get into bloodless warfare.”\n\nThe promise of a high-tech, long-distance precision-strike capability—”bloodless warfare”—perfectly suited the national moment. In 1991, America was still near enough to its Vietnam experience to be wholly captive to its lessons. The doctrine set forth by Ronald Reagan’s Defense Secretary, Caspar Weinberger, and later amended by Colin Powell, held that the United States should not commit its forces to a fight unless there was a vital national interest at stake, solid public support, the aim of decisive victory, and an exit strategy. In practical terms, these considerations constituted a national policy of risk aversion—scenes of body bags arriving at Dover Air Force Base were to be avoided at all cost. The greatest risk of casualties occurred in ground war, and ground war was the principal business of the Army. Precision air power, in contrast, came to be viewed as relatively pristine.\n\nThe election of Bill Clinton, in 1992, locked in the ideal of risk aversion—and added a twist. After some early timidity over the use of American force, the Clinton Administration adopted a muscular posture internationally, redefining “vital national interest” to include humanitarian crises in world hot spots that posed no security threat to the United States. This led to intervention, on moral grounds, in places like Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo, and East Timor. But when eighteen American soldiers were killed in Mogadishu, in 1993, during a United Nations mission in Somalia, Clinton pulled out, and, the following year, he chose not to intervene in the Rwandan genocide, in which hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered.\n\nWith ground forces effectively precluded, air power became an alluring alternative. In 1995, several days of American-led bombing forced Serbia’s Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table, resulting in the Dayton accords, and relative peace. Only after the peace was negotiated did the United States Army come into play—as a peacekeeping force—and then only after Clinton promised Congress that the troops would remain in Bosnia just for a year (a vow he later amended; the troops are still there).\n\nAdvances in technology—the ability to guide a computerized bomb by satellite to its exact target on the ground—favored the use of precision weapons. In the Gulf War, notwithstanding the impressive spectacle of the smart bombs, precision weapons accounted for less than a tenth of the munitions used. By 1999, in Kosovo that percentage had risen to nearly a third.\n\nThe apparent success of the new long-distance precision warfare, however, obscured its limitations. Milosevic, having been advised by his chief adversary that there would be no ground war, was able to disperse his forces, making them almost impossible to hit, even with smart bombs. An air war that some expected to last just days, as in the 1995 air strike that brought Milosevic to Dayton, dragged on for more than two and a half months. Thirty-eight thousand sorties were flown, dropping so many bombs that supplies ran low, and yet many Serb tanks escaped unscathed. On the other hand, several hundred civilians were killed by the American-led bombing when refugee convoys, hospitals, and the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade were mistakenly targeted. Milosevic, counting on Clinton’s vow that no American ground forces would be employed, was able to move his forces into Kosovo and to purge the province of ethnic Albanians with impunity. “The problem is he’s accelerated greatly, and we don’t have a way to stop it,” Peter Galbraith, a former Ambassador to Croatia, said at the time, speaking of Milosevic. “This will not be a triumph if we’ve destroyed their equipment but Kosovo is empty.” The United States and its allies eventually won, but not until after Kosovo had been emptied.\n\nThe bias toward air power reduced the Army to the role it relishes least, Military Operations Other Than War—peacekeeping missions that are dangerous but have no clear military objective, and seem to have no end.\n\n“The new Administration’s security team came into power biased in favor of aerospace power, because aerospace power is genuinely revolutionary, even a century after its inception,” says Loren Thompson, a defense expert at the Lexington Institute, in Arlington, Virginia. “Land power, sea power are so constrained in their potential that they can’t possibly match the transformational implications of space and of really advanced aircraft. They’re simply too limited in their physical potential. Because one can’t find a truly transformational version of the Army, it is losing adherents and resources over time.”\n\nThe new high-tech warfare is costly, and one way to pay for it is to reduce low-tech inventory—the Army soldier, and the structures and big war machines that support him. Early last year, Rumsfeld and his senior staff conducted reviews of the armed forces, occasionally meeting with top military officials. The reviews targeted two of the Army’s ten divisions, and a big artillery system that the Army was developing, called the Crusader.\n\nThe Army, which had been quarrelling over hats, was jolted. The Rumsfeld reviews shook all of the services, whose chiefs, including Shinseki, opposed what amounted to the blueprint for the President’s transformation plan. With the most to lose, the Army was fiercest in its resistance. Shinseki the transformer became Shinseki the bureaucratic warrior, a role to which he was perhaps more naturally suited. He had plenty of friends on Capitol Hill, and Rumsfeld received a letter of protest signed by more than eighty congressmen. Army Secretary Thomas E. White, himself a retired Army brigadier general, told Congress that he was “very nervous” about the prospect of reducing the size of a force that was already stretched thin by its deployments around the world. Newspapers began to report growing antipathy between Rumsfeld and the services, anonymously quoting Army officers who said that Rumsfeld, infatuated with technology, didn’t understand the true nature of war. Rumsfeld was vulnerable on other fronts last spring. The rivalry between the Departments of State and Defense had spilled into the press, and was cast as a dispute between the popular Colin Powell and the irascible Rumsfeld, who, nearing seventy, had served as Defense Secretary for Gerald Ford a quarter-century before. The subtext was that Rumsfeld was off his game. By late summer, there was open speculation in Washington that Defense might need a new Secretary.\n\nIn October, when Rumsfeld’s plan for transformation was finally released, in a report called the Quadrennial Defense Review, he appeared to have backed down; the report mentioned nothing specific about cuts in force structure or weapons. But by then, of course, the chemistry in Washington had changed, and Rumsfeld soon became celebrated for his role in the new war on terror. The common wisdom in the Army is that Rumsfeld had a direct hand in fashioning the war plan for Afghanistan, which may partly explain why conventional American ground forces—Army soldiers—did not play a principal role in the early, main war that drove the Taliban from power. That early war was fought from the air by American warplanes, and on the ground by the surrogate forces of the Afghan Northern Alliance and special-operations troops. Precision war reached a new apogee in Afghanistan, where nearly two-thirds of the weapons used were of this type.\n\nIt could be said that the quick success in routing the Taliban validated R.M.A. In fact, it was said, in so many words, by the President in a speech at the Citadel last December. “This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle,” Bush said. “Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach.” Indeed, Rumsfeld’s military transformation was only beginning, and this time Rumsfeld’s own skills as a bureaucratic warrior would be on full display.\n\nOn the morning of April 11th, General Shinseki was at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was about to address a group of officers at the Army’s command college, when he received an urgent call from one of his aides in Washington. “Sir, you’ve got to know about this,” the aide said, and then he outlined for the Chief an article that appeared in that morning’s Washington Post. The night before, Pentagon officials had revealed to the Post’s Thomas Ricks that Rumsfeld had decided upon—and the President had approved—a slate of military appointments placing in top command positions men “who are likely to be more supportive of the administration’s goal of radically changing the armed forces.” Among the proposed appointments was the next Chief of Staff of the Army. Shinseki hadn’t yet completed the third year of a four-year term, and Rumsfeld had chosen his replacement, without a word to Shinseki. The unusual move, the Post reported, was prompted by the impression within Rumsfeld’s circle that there was “a lack of fresh thinking in the Army.”\n\nIt was a humiliation for Shinseki, but even his most loyal circle had to admire Rumsfeld’s cunning. Firing Shinseki, or forcing his resignation, would have caused a spectacle. Rumsfeld had quietly made a lame duck of Shinseki for the last year of his term. Rumsfeld is apparently pleased with the main features of Shinseki’s plan—the Stryker Brigades, the Objective Force, the phasing out of the large battle tanks, and the development of the Future Combat System—which Shinseki devised when Rumsfeld’s boss was still the Governor of Texas. Indeed, Rumsfeld wants phases of Army transformation accelerated. What he doesn’t want is the Army’s effective opposition on such issues as those which Shinseki helped to beat back last year.\n\nRumsfeld’s cleverest move, perhaps, was his choice for Shinseki’s successor—General John M. Keane, Shinseki’s Vice-Chief of Staff. Keane arrived with Shinseki in 1999, and served as a distinct complement and counterpoint to his boss. Shinseki had been an armor officer; Keane was from the light army, a former paratrooper who had commanded the 101st Airborne Division. Keane, a bluff New Yorker, enjoys chatting with the press, and he has been the Army leadership’s conduit to the force’s reform underground. Shinseki tended to shut out some of the Army’s noisier critics; Keane talks regularly with Colonel Macgregor and is interested in the personnel-restructuring ideas of Major Vandergriff. These distinctions have made it possible to cast Shinseki as an obstructionist and Keane as a transformer-in-waiting, even though Keane helped Shinseki devise his transformation plan. The practical result—and many in the Army believe it was Rumsfeld’s intended result—is that the Army is left with a diminished leadership for the next year. Keane is Rumsfeld’s man inside the Army, but he is not in charge; Shinseki is in charge, but he bears the onus of the Defense Secretary’s no-confidence gesture.\n\nThe move seemed to be of a piece with what came next—a showdown between the Army and Rumsfeld over the Army’s development of the Crusader artillery system. The Crusader typifies Shinseki’s dilemma in trying to transform the Army and represent its interests at the same time. The big field-artillery system, meant to provide support for soldiers in close combat, was conceived in 1994 to address an artillery shortcoming discovered in the Gulf War. The Army’s big cannon, a decades-old gun called the Paladin, was too slow to keep up with the Bradley vehicles and the Abrams tanks during attack. The Crusader, which requires a smaller crew, would be self-propelled, quick-firing, and faster. But it was a creation of the old, heavy Army—weighing forty tons and requiring a companion vehicle almost as big to carry supplies and fuel.\n\nThe Crusader program, estimated to cost eleven billion dollars, was a convenient symbol for transformers, and George Bush referred to it in his Presidential campaign as an example of the sort of Army bloat that needed reform. General Keane was inclined to give up the Crusader, but both he and Shinseki knew that the Army needed an improvement upon the Paladin, if only for force protection. In one of Shinseki’s first acts as Chief, he had ordered the Crusader reconfigured, and its weight had been nearly halved. It was still huge, but at least the gun and its companion vehicle could be squeezed into a C-17 transport plane, meeting the transformation goal of quick deployability in a contingency. It wasn’t transformed enough for the Administration, however, and when Rumsfeld began his reviews the Crusader was a potential target. The weapon was spared when Rumsfeld capitulated to a pressure campaign, and half a billion dollars for the gun was included in the President’s budget in February.\n\nStill, Bush continued to mention the Crusader whenever the subject of military transformation arose. The day after a meeting between Rumsfeld and the President in early February, Rumsfeld wrote a memorandum saying that when he’d been asked about the Crusader by Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, he replied, “I am tired of hearing about the Crusader. If you folks want to get briefed, and then tell me to cancel it, we’ll cancel it.” In fact, a briefing for the President had already been prepared, by Edward Aldridge, Rumsfeld’s Under-Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. Aldridge’s briefing memorandum compared the reconfigured Crusader with the Paladin and concluded that the Administration should “proceed with the development of Crusader II. [It] is a success story well worth sustaining.”\n\nThe President never received Aldridge’s briefing. Instead, on April 30th, Aldridge and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told Army Secretary White that Rumsfeld was again considering termination of the Crusader. White was given a month to present a study of the alternatives.\n\nThe Army, surprised, but believing that it could win on Capitol Hill, prepared again for political battle. A list of “talking points” was drawn up, arguing the merits of the Crusader, and noting the Paladin’s obsolescence. But the memo’s subtext was a brief of the Army’s grievances against the Rumsfeld team. “A decision to kill Crusader puts soldiers at risk,” the memo declared. It hinted at the Army’s deepest suspicion of Rumsfeld and his R.M.A. associates—their “call[ing] into question the relevance of land power.” The memo suggested that Rumsfeld’s transformation was a return to the “hollow Army” days of the Carter Administration, and culminated with an almost personal gibe: The Office of the Secretary of Defense “is looking for a quick kill to demonstrate their political prowess.” (Rumsfeld later told Congress, “You have to ask the question, If not now, when? Is there nothing, is there nothing, that we’re doing that we can ever stop?”)\n\nThe talking-points memo made its way to Capitol Hill, presenting Rumsfeld with a tactical opportunity that he immediately seized. The Defense Department portrayed the Army memo as rank insubordination, a defiance of civilian authority over the military, and White ordered an investigation by the Army’s Inspector General.\n\nOn the afternoon of May 16th, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Crusader, the main witnesses were Rumsfeld and Shinseki. The event was a brilliant display of political stagecraft by Rumsfeld. That morning, opinion pieces advocating his position were carried by several newspapers. At lunch that day, he appeared on Rush Limbaugh’s national radio show, hoping to convince Limbaugh’s conservative audience that the Administration was still avidly pro-military. Rumsfeld arrived at the Dirksen Senate Office Building a few minutes early, paused for photographers and to sign autographs, and proceeded to dominate most of the rest of the afternoon. Sitting at the witness table flanked by his deputies Wolfowitz and Aldridge, he frequently referred to a complicated color chart meant to illustrate that continuing with the Crusader would cause a disastrous “bow wave” funding problem in the near future—that is, hinder the financing of newer systems. Rumsfeld and his team took up so much time that Senator John Warner, the ranking Republican on the committee, noted that if Shinseki wasn’t heard soon reporters covering the hearing wouldn’t get his side of the story.\n\nIt was nearly seven when Shinseki’s testimony finally began, and just a handful of senators remained in the room. Rumsfeld’s session had been a charged exchange; Shinseki’s appearance, conducted in the gloaming, had an almost elegiac quality. Senator Warner said to him, “You’re a soldier’s soldier, and this has not been an easy chapter, but you’re up to it.” Shinseki dispensed with his prepared remarks, and instead read a short statement that amounted to capitulation. The Army needed some sort of improved artillery system, he said, but if the Crusader wasn’t to be the solution, “We will find one.”\n\nA telling feature of the friction between Rumsfeld’s office and the Army is the degree to which Rumsfeld has endorsed the Army’s transformation vision even while engineering the undoing of its creator. During the Crusader dispute, Rumsfeld took pains to declare his “confidence that the Army has set a course over the longer term that we believe is a good course and, indeed, needs to be accelerated.” That statement captured the essence of Shinseki’s dilemma. He tried to harness the military revolution and to apply it in measures that his reluctant organization might accept; it was too much for the old order, not enough for the revolutionaries. The defense analyst Loren Thompson compares Shinseki’s role to that of Aleksandr Kerensky, the Russian Revolutionary who was undone by the Bolsheviks. “Shinseki represented a change over what came before, but the world wanted more change than he was able to deliver in the time frame that he had,” Thompson says. “He was prepared to make changes that, within the context of Army tradition, were significant. But, by the standards of the outside world, not party to those institutional rhythms, it seems very incremental and conservative.”\n\nShinseki is expected to remain as Chief until his term expires, next June, but increasingly the signals that will be heeded inside and outside the Army are those that will be coming from Shinseki’s No. 2 and successor, General Keane. Keane, too, will have to balance his zeal for transformation with his obligation, as the force’s top bureaucrat, to fight the Army’s political battles. And Rumsfeld, having won for the moment on Crusader, may again consider a reduction in Army forces, by a division or more.\n\nSince the Crusader fight and the relegation of Shinseki to a lame-duck position, Rumsfeld and his deputies at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (O.S.D.) have attempted to minimize their differences with the Army. Paul Wolfowitz, speaking for Rumsfeld in an interview last week, acknowledged that some people in the Rumsfeld circle believe that “air power is now so accurate that you don’t need armies, or you don’t need armies with artillery, or you don’t need this or that.” When asked if the O.S.D. believes that the Army is, by its very nature, not transformative, he said, “I will not deny that I think there are pockets around O.S.D. and the Air Force that are afflicted with that way of thinking.” But, he said, Rumsfeld and he are not of that view, which he characterized as “one-dimensional thinking.” He went on, “He and I believe emphatically that we’ve got to have effective ground forces. You don’t win wars just from the air. I have to say I was astonished that we accomplished as much as we did in Kosovo without ground forces. And I think that was a fluke.”\n\nRumsfeld himself now says that the war in Afghanistan, with its formula of American air power, special forces, and the proxy army of the Northern Alliance, should not be seen as a model for future wars. Perhaps he and Wolfowitz are looking ahead to a new war with Iraq, in which the ground forces of the Army would certainly play a critical role. “Long-range precision strike is most effective when it’s a combination of air power and ground power, not air by itself,” Wolfowitz said. “And we just had a dramatic demonstration in Afghanistan of the truth of that—the Air Force wasn’t accomplishing anything until we got some guys on the ground. And then they were able to reinforce other guys on the ground, who ultimately are what brought about the victory. We could have dropped bombs until kingdom come and it would have had no effect.”\n\nWolfowitz went on, “I think you need people on the ground. I just think it would be nice if you could do it with less of them, and if you could deploy them faster, so that the next time there’s a Desert Storm it doesn’t take six months to get ready for it.”\n\nDoes Rumsfeld really hate the Army, as the Armed Services Journal International suggested?\n\n“Definitely not,” Wolfowitz said. “That’s a simple question to answer. By the way, let’s remember, he’s a very demanding guy and he’s tough on everybody, including himself. And no one should misinterpret that for hostility.”\n\nWolfowitz praised Shinseki’s Stryker Brigades, and called them an important step toward transformation. (If Rumsfeld does eliminate an Army division in Europe, it would probably be replaced by a Stryker Brigade.) Wolfowitz pointed out that the money the government will save by cancelling the Crusader would be used in accelerating the artillery portions of Shinseki’s Future Combat System. “I do believe that where we are putting the money is a reflection of some of the priorities that General Shinseki has set, with a good deal of courage, actually,” Wolfowitz said. “I mean, he is the one who has been pushing the Army to be lighter, more deployable, more lethal. The Objective Force is his doing. In fact, one of his quotes, which I love, though I don’t mean to use his words against him—I feel a little guilty—but he said to the Army a few months ago, ‘If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance a lot less.’ It’s quite a good speech.” ♦"
