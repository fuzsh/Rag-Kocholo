        "text": "In June 2003 I wrote about how General Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, was shunted aside by the arrogant civilians running Defense–Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Feith. ( I post the blog below.)\n\nReading between the lines of his 2003 Farewell Address, Shinseki blasted these men—men who not only exaggerated the threat Iraq posed, but gravely underestimated the problems of postwar occupation.\n\nOn December 7th, the 67th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President-Elect Obama will nominate the retired General– the highest ranking Asian-American in US military history (he is Japanese-American)– to head the Department of Veteran Affairs. The Department, second largest after Defense (with 240,000 employees) administers health and other benefits for active military and veterans. It is underfunded, antiquated and stretched to the breaking point by a war this country should never have waged.\n\nAs Joshua Kors has reported in his award-winning Nation series, we’ve seen a stunning pattern of benefit denials to veterans by the Department of Veteran Affairs. Misdiagnosing PTSD as preexisting “personality disorder”–in an effort to save funds on the backs of worthy vets– is a travesty that the Department and new administration must address with sustained commitment and bring to a full stop.\n\nFortunately, Kors’ reporting in The Nation has led to congressional hearings, an amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Act and, crucially, payment of back benefits for the men and women who’ve served their nation. Let’s work with Shinseki to repair the damage done to veterans’ lives, health and well-being– and ensure that those who understand the brutality of war don’t escalate another futile one in Afghanistan.\n\nhttp://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=759=====================================06/16/2003 @ 5:06pm\n\nA General’s Farewellby Katrina vanden Heuvel\n\nRemember General Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, who warned that occupying Iraq might require hundreds of thousands of soldiers for an extended period? He was immediately reprimanded by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz for being “wildly off the mark.”\n\nIt’s now two months since Baghdad fell, no WMD’s have been found and US forces are bogged down in Iraq. American generals, happy to boast about the rapid defeat of Saddam’s regime, now admit the war is far from over. The other night, General Barry McCaffrey predicted that US troops would be in Iraq for five years and warned that three divisions of the National Guard might be needed to reinforce Army divisions already deployed. And Lieutenant General David McKiernan, commander of US ground forces in Iraq, recently said his troops would be needed for a long time to come, that Baghdad and a large swathe of northern and western Iraq is only a “semi-permissive” environment, and that “subversive forces” are still active.\n\nSince Bush strutted onto the USS Lincoln to declare “Mission Accomplished,” more than forty Americans have been killed with many more wounded, (sixty-six have been killed since the fall of Baghdad on April 9.) No wonder General Shinseki–the highest-ranking Asian- American in US military history–retired the other day with a blast at the arrogance of the Pentagon’s civilian leaders:\n\n“You must love those you lead before you can be an effective leader,” he said. “You can certainly command without that sense of commitment, but you cannot lead without it. And without leadership, command is a hollow experience, a vacuum often filled with mistrust and arrogance.”\n\nRead between the lines. The Army chief of staff is telling us that men like Donald Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz are arrogant commanders, who not only exaggerated the threat Iraq posed but gravely underestimated the problems of postwar occupation. Americans would do well to heed General Shinseki’s final warning."
