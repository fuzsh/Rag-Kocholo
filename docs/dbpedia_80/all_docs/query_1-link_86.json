        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nMajor veterans groups also supported the resignation, and called for a closer look at the overall VA system.\n\nOne of the largest, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a statement: \"We support Shinseki's decision to resign because the outside calls for his resignation were overshadowing the crisis in health care issues veterans face.\"\n\nThe president today said he will leave it to the Justice Department whether the scandal warrants a criminal investigation, as many in Congress are demanding.\n\nIn the meantime, he's appointed Sloan Gibson, the VA's number two, as acting secretary.\n\nAnd we explore the problem, the resignation and what's next with Paul Rieckhoff, an Iraq war veteran and founder and executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Joseph Violante is a Vietnam War veteran. He's now national legislative director of Disabled American Veterans. And Dr. Stephen Xenakis a retired Army brigadier general who had a 28-year career as an Army psychiatrist. He's the founder of the Center for Translational Medicine, a nonprofit organization providing mental health care services to veterans.\n\nWelcome to all of you.\n\nPaul Rieckhoff, let me start with you. Your reaction to the resignation of Eric Shinseki? Was it the right thing to do? Is it best for the VA?\n\nPAUL RIECKHOFF, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America: It was, and it needed to happen.\n\nOur members across the country had lost confidence in Secretary Shinseki. The country had lost confidence in Secretary Shinseki, and many of the VA employees had as well. So, this was a dam that burst. And I think it's important to note it wasn't just building over the last few weeks. This has been building for years.\n\nI.G. reports have been coming back, coming out going back to 2007 noting the wait times. There have been congressional testimonies. Groups like ours have maybe trying to raise these issues for year after year. And there continued to be delays, stonewalling. And I think that's really part of what got to the bottom of this. Veterans had had it, enough was enough.\n\nAnd we do note that there are much bigger institutional, bureaucratic changes that must take place. This is not going to solve everything, but a change in tone and a change at the top is definitely necessary.\n\nBRIG. GEN. STEPHEN XENAKIS:\n\nWell, started years ago. The VA didn't prepare for what was going to be now 2.5 million men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, the fact that the population of soldiers and the veterans from the Vietnam War were aging and were going to be hitting a point in time that they were going to need a lot more medical care.\n\nAnd they didn't map out what was going to be the load, the burden, demand for services that were going to be required. They also were an organization that didn't welcome change and didn't allow themselves, didn't have flexibility in figuring out what they needed to do to meet the mission.\n\nJOSEPH VIOLANTE:\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I would just like to say one thing about this problem, because it started well before these wars. Back in 2001, President Bush established a task force to look at the delivery of health care for veterans. This was prior to the attack on our nation. Two years later, in May of 2003, the war in Afghanistan was still young. We were just going into Iraq.\n\nThis task force found that, at that time, there were 236,000 veterans on a wait list waiting six months or more for care. They also found it was a mismatch between funding and demand and, if that mismatch wasn't addressed, the situation would impact access.\n\nHere we are 11 years later, and that's the problem. So, we have not addressed those problems then. When that report came out, Congress and the administration shelved it, even though the veterans organizations wanted those recommendations to be looked at.\n\nPAUL RIECKHOFF:\n\nRight. Right. It's a total system failure.\n\nAnd it started with the revelations in Phoenix over four weeks ago. And the secretary was slow to respond and the president was slow to respond. Now the I.G. is investigating over 40 different facilities. So it's a system-wide failure. People are cooking the books. And we want to see criminal investigations.\n\nI mean, if veterans died waiting for care, then people need to go to jail. It's really got to be boiled down into human terms here. We have got Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, most in their late 20s, who have served overseas multiple tours, are coming home and seeking help. They're bravely stepping forward and going to get help, and the VA is failing them.\n\nSo, this is a bureaucrat problem. But it's also been kicked down the road after president after president and year after year. It's time for the president to step up and make this a presidential authority. He has also got to integrate the other government agencies around the VA and communicate to the American people that the VA can't do it alone.\n\nCommunity-based nonprofits, health care groups, veterans groups are also overwhelmed trying to fill the gap, because right now only about 55 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are even using the system. So if we all come forward, the system is going to be stretched that much more. And that's what we expect to happen in the years to come.\n\nBRIG. GEN. STEPHEN XENAKIS:\n\nI don't think it's primarily.\n\nI think it's an issue of the culture. You talked about integrity. And I think it's people understanding, from the front-line doctors and nurses, to the management, of what their responsibility is to the veterans and what they need to do in terms of accomplishing their objectives.\n\nI think it's organizational. I think it's how they're set up, who has what authority to run, execute programs and develop programs, and I think there's problems with the support systems. The information systems are old and clumsy and clunky, and so I think it's those problems. I would first look at fixing those, bring in the right leadership, and then, because there has been pretty good funding up to now, then think about what the funding needs are going to be."
