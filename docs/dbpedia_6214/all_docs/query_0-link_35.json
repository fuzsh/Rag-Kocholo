MARKEY, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MASSA- CHUSETTS Mr. Markey. Good morning, ladies and gentleman, and before I start I just want to note for the members that last night Congress- man Pickering and I introduced legislation to preserve Internet freedom for consumers and innovators. It is a bill which enshrines the broad principles of openness and safeguarding the Internet’s vital role in our economy. It tasks the FCC with conducting an as- sessment of broadband practices and consumer rights including public hearings and a report back to Congress. We would welcome members who wish to co-sponsor to join us in this bipartisan initia- tive. Today we are 370 days away from a significant milestone in the history of television. This morning’s hearing will give us an impor- tant status check on our progress towards a successful consumer friendly transition. The government’s coupon program has begun and already this year some 2.5 million consumers have requested coupons toward the purchase of converter boxes valued at roughly $190 million. Retailers are stocking such converter boxes on shelves for coupon redemption imminently. The broadcasting cable industries have stepped up to air public service announcements and engage in consumer outreach as well. The details of the na- tional plan to effectuate this transition were embodied in a budget act in the last Congress and were not endorsed by many members on the Democratic side of the aisle, including myself and Chairman Dingell. ( 1 ) 2 Nevertheless, we are committed to trying to make this plan work. Toward that goal, this subcommittee intends to continue vig- orous oversight of the DTV transition and to work closely with our Republican colleagues to insure success. Today there are several issues at the moment that merit our attention. First, we are eager to be reassured that the converter box program and redemption process is working smoothly. Second, because the signal character- istics of digital transmission and the anticipated geographic cov- erage area for individual broadcasters are different than for analog television many consumers may not receive the digital version of channels they currently receive after the switch. It is important to know how many such households will be af- fected by this and the extent to which households may need to ad- just or acquire antennas to receive digital signals. Third, there are hundreds of low power television stations and thousands of trans- lators that will not be converting to digital in February of next year. It is still unclear how many communities and how many tele- vision households will be affected by this. In addition, only a small percentage of the approved converter boxes permit the so-called pass through of the analog signals so that consumers can easily see both digital and analog television in markets where some broad- casters will convert and others won’t. It is vital to insure that steps are taken by the FCC and the NTIA to coordinate on these matters with the affected industries so that the consumer education and outreach efforts effectively guards against widespread consumer confusion in these communities. And finally I want to commend several major retailers for taking action to limit consumer confusion. It has been my concern that analog only televisions remains on the shelves of major retailers and could result in consumers unwittingly purchasing a TV set due to need additional equipment in little over one year. Best Buy has already voluntarily removed its analog inventory from the shelves, and RadioShack is poised to do so by March 1. In addition, I have this announcement to read from Wal-Mart today. “Although retail- ers are not prohibited from selling TVs with an analog tuner, Wal- Mart believes it is important consistent with congressional concern and counsel from Chairman Markey to remove the very small num- ber of TVs with an analog tuner from our inventory. This is con- sistent with Wal-Mart’s early commitment to the NTIA converter box program and to otherwise facilitating transition to all digital television broadcasting. We are currently working with return cen- ters and the Wal-Mart Foundation to determine the best way to handle the remaining inventory, which was extremely small, ap- proximately 1/lOth of 1 percent of existing television inventory.” This statement is effective as of yesterday, so I want to commend Wal-Mart, Best Buy, RadioShack, and other retailers who are tak- ing this welcome step. And I urge all retailers to take the same step and to take it im- mediately so the consumers are not misled that the television set, the analog television set, that they may be buying will work next year without additional help. Again, we have many issues to dis- cuss and examine, and I want to thank all of our witnesses for their willingness to attend this hearing, and I look forward to their testimony. And now I will turn and recognize the ranking member 3 of the Telecommunications and the Internet Subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida, my good friend, Mr. Stearns. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CLIFF STEARNS, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Stearns. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am pleased to be here as the ranking member and I always look forward to working with you. I hope with this net neutrality bill that you adopted will have many hearings to vet the language so we can all understand how it is enshrined. So we will look forward to that. I think by set- ting the date of February 17, 2009, as the date for full power broadcasters to transmit exclusively the digital format, the DTV legislation gave industry I think the needed incentives to prepare for the transition. And I think the results, as you briefly men- tioned, are working well. With over a year to go manufacturers have already designed 37 coupon-eligible converter boxes. The NTIA has certified 250 retailers with a total of 15,000 stores ready to accept these coupons. Consumers have requested almost 5 million coupons suggesting awareness is not necessarily a big problem. The National Tele- communication and Information Administration will start sending coupons to consumers next week, and RadioShack, Best Buy, Cir- cuit City, and Wal-Mart have already announced they are ready to accept them. A Consumer Electronics Association survey of 2,000 U.S. adults indicates consumer awareness of the transition has grown 80 percent since the year 2006. According to the CEA sur- vey, the joint educational efforts of government and the private sec- tor are working, and the digital television transition will be a suc- cess. CEA’s research revealed that the top sources consumers are using to learn about the transition includes television, about 72 percent, family and friends, about 40 percent, and the Internet about 25 percent. This shows that the educational campaigns by the industry and the government are working indeed. The National Association of Broadcasters has spent more than $1 billion on a comprehensive consumer education drive. Included in their campaign are public service announcement in both English and Spanish, DTV messages running across programming on local stations, and a media blitz to promote the DTV transition. Cable operators have launched a $200 million public education campaign and committed to carrying both the analog and digital signals of both a full power commercial must carry broadcasters for 3 years to help smooth the DTV transition. My colleagues, these examples demonstrate that a market based approach works. All these groups and many others should be commended for their efforts. The bene- fits of the DTV transition extends far beyond that of clearer pic- tures and more choices about what program to watch. The real benefits will come from what is done with the radio spectrum once the TV broadcasters are cleared including providing public safety with the resources they need to insure reliable, inter- operable communications now and into the future. Although the number of people using over the air signal is decreasing there still needs to be in place a system to help consumers who may wish to use analog television with over the air antennas after the transi- tion. The DTV legislation gives the NTIA up to $1.5 billion for a 4 digital to analog converter box program. The statute directs DTIA to use $990 million to enable U.S. households to request up to 2 $40 coupons for use towards purchase of converter boxes. If the NTIA certifies to Congress as the program progresses that it needs more money there is available another $510 million. So it is important that we don’t make any rash changes today. Doing so will only recreate the uncertainty that was delaying the transition in the first place and preventing us from clearing spec- trum for public safety in advance wireless service, the third genera- tion. For example, low power broadcasters are now demanding that NTIA require all converter boxes to include an analog pass through and that the FCC give them must carry rights. Neither is nec- essary. There are already 4 coupon-eligible converter box with low power pass through features and there is more on the way. The market is taking care of this. Changing the box requirements now by contrast could lead retailers and manufacturers to withdraw from the program altogether, and expanding must carry could force programming off of cable system right as we are going through this very delicate transition. We are much better off keeping the current course and assessing as we move along. Wholesale changes could put the transition in jeopardy, and I don’t think any one of us want that. These are im- portant issues, Mr. Chairman. We thank you for this hearing, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Mr. Markey. I thank the gentleman. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Harman. Ms. Harman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see a former colleague of ours, Ron Klink, in the audience, and I thought I would acknowl- edge him. And I thank you for holding this hearing on what I be- lieve is a critical subject. I would like to address a few comments to Chairman Martin. Good morning. Mr. Martin. Good morning. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JANE HARMAN, A REPRESENT- ATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Ms. Harman. Chairman Martin, your appearances before this subcommittee give many of us the chance on a regular basis to tell you what you are doing wrong but today I thought we might ac- knowledge or I would like to acknowledge what you are doing right. This 700 megahertz auction began on time. It has largely suc- ceeded. And the open access conditions that many of us argued for have stuck. Congratulations. Though the D block, which the com- mission set aside for a nationwide public safety network has not yet sold and likely will not, something that troubles me greatly, I still think we should applaud you for your boldness in pursuing a multi-faceted plan and that applause obviously extends to the other members of the commission. But as the ranking member just said, and as you know I agree, the point of the DTV transition is not converter boxes. The point of it is to satisfy a 6-year quest for a nationwide public safety broadband network that gives us true interoperable communications for emergency responders. That need has been apparent since 9/11, maybe even before 9/11, and we are not much closer to meeting that need now than we were six years ago. As I often say, we have a regional operability 5 but we do not have national interoperability, and we won’t have it until this spectrum becomes available. I think a public-private partnership using 700 megahertz spectrum is still our best hope. I think that the failure of the D block auction if it has failed or if it does fail does not signal the failure of the public-private part- nership concept. If the auction ends without a D block winner, I hope that you and we will not only meet informally but then we will have a series of hearings which the chairman has said he will hold to review next steps and to come up quickly with a new plan D. Do I have that right? Not a plan B, a plan D. Mr. Markey. D for do over. Ms. Harman. That is the chairman’s humor. D for do over. OK. Whatever we come up with, a new plan to reach true interoper- ability by the appropriate deadline. The goal should be a new op- tion with a new set of rules that addresses the faults of the current auction but protects public safety’s needs. I think we should, as I said, get on with this quickly once we determine for certain what the future, if any, is of the D block part of the auction. The DTV transition must yield a solution to first responders emergency com- munications needs, not just the budget converter boxes. A nation- wide solution is long overdue. We still have time to get it right, and I urge us to get it right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Markey. The gentlelady’s time has expired. The chair recog- nizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez. Waive opening. Mr. Markey. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Boucher. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Stupak. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BART STUPAK, A REPRESENT- ATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and thank you for attending the O&I hearing yesterday afternoon. You added to it. Thank you. 370 days from now America will offi- cially stop all of its analog broadcasts for full power television sta- tions but approximately 2,100 low power television stations and 4,700 translator stations will still be broadcast in analog. Many parts of America will be receiving their over the air signals in both analog and digital. This information has not been clearly provided to the American public. Many don’t even know that there will be stations that still broadcast in analog, let alone that they need to purchase a specific converter box with an analog pass through or they will lose channels. Out of the 35 converter boxes available on the market only 3 carry this essential component so this makes effective consumer education even more important. Until the morning of this hearing if you want to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s DTV coupon web site and clicked on the link enti- tled questions about low power translator stations you viewed a 1- page with 1 sentence stating that “information about the impact of the digital transition on low power stations coming soon.” Conven- iently thought I checked and now it has some low power TV infor- mation and several options for consumers. This is unacceptable. 1.6 million Americans have already signed up for coupons on this web 6 site, and a valuable opportunity to provide them with key informa- tion was missed. Ms. Baker, as head of the NTIA I want to know what you will do in order to improve consumer education. Many of those who will be affected will come from rural districts like mine but many will also come from urban districts. I look forward to learning how you plan to inform my constituents that many of them will need an analog pass through converter box, not just a converter box but a pass through converter box. Chairman Martin, you recently cir- culated some proposals to be addressed by the FCC later this month regarding satellite providers, and I wanted to focus on one of them. Liberty Media’s acquisition of News Corp’s stake in DirecTV. In 2004 News Corp acquired DirecTV and pledged to provide local into local carriage in all 210 designated market areas by 2008. Commissioner Adelstein at the time called News Corp pledge to provide universal local to local a sham. Sadly enough, the News Corp efforts to sell their share of DirecTV we are seeing his pre- diction come true. Satellite subscribers in rural America are tired of being ignored. I urge the FCC to work towards insuring rural television markets are created equally to their urban counterparts. It is time for Congress and the FCC to look at a hard date for man- datory local to local carriage in all 210 designated market areas. I am quite tired of hearing pledges that go unfulfilled. Mr. Chair- man, thank you again for holding this hearing. I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses as there are some very important issues we must discuss. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Markey. The gentleman’s time has expired. The chair recog- nizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Capps. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LOIS CAPPS, A REPRESENTA- TIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Ms. Capps. I will be brief, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this hearing, and thank you also for your vigilant over- sight of the DTV transition which has resulted in a greater focus on consumer concerns and a greater understanding of the chal- lenges we face as we move ahead. Today’s hearing promises to be a bit more technical in nature. We will talk about class C television stations, analog pass through, and the technical specs of converter boxes. And I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and our conversation with them. During this discussion it is my hope we keep sight of the reason we are transitioning to digital television and the reason we are all here today in the interest of the Amer- ican people. Even as we move toward a single digital signal over our public air waves, we are sending mixed signals to consumers about how they can continue to receive the same local and cultural content. I am particularly concerned about my Spanish-speaking constitu- ents, many of whom enjoy Spanish language channels brought to them via translator or low power stations. These folks may be com- pletely shut out during this transition so I look forward to this tes- timony, as I said, and the proposals that Chairman Martin and Acting Assistant Secretary Baker will bring us to further discus- sion about how we can avoid this kind of break down, how will we 7 streamline this transition for low power television stations. I want to also hear more about how and where converter boxes will be made available, some of which had already come from our chair- man, what labeling procedures make the best sense for all kinds of consumers. So thank you. Chairman Markey, and to our wit- nesses today. I yield back. Mr. Markey. The gentlelady’s time has expired. The chair recog- nizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Solis. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HILDA SOLIS, A REPRESENTA- TIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Ms. Solis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning. Thank you also for being here. Commissioner Martin, and Ms. Baker. I want to thank the witnesses for being here that will also be testi- fying. With just more than a year left before our full power broad- cast television stations transition to digital we are learning about the new challenges and must work very hard to address all of these issues. I am particularly concerned, as you know, about the DTV transition along the U.S. -Mexican border. With ample analog Span- ish language programming originating in Mexico it is still avail- able. After the transition along the border low cable and satellite penetration and language barriers could leave thousands and thou- sands of households behind in DTV transition. That is why I am introducing the DTV Border Fix Act to provide full power broadcasters within 50 miles of the U.S. -Mexican border the opportunity to continue analog broadcasts for 5 years after the DTV transition. The bill insures that border area viewers will con- tinue to receive emergency information and use over the U.S. tele- vision broadcast system. The bill is limited in scope and would work in cooperation with the FCC so that such broadcasts do not interfere with the public interest or spectrum auctions. I also have concerns about the challenges facing low power TV and how the need for analog pass through boxes can be met for both low power TV and the border region. We need to work to- gether, both the government and the private sector, to make sure that the right boxes are stocked in appropriate areas. In addition, I am concerned about potential problems existing over the air an- tennas receiving digital television signals. If consumers are to re- ceive fewer channels in digital and even if the picture quality is su- perior as compared to analog services because of inadequate anten- nas consumers may be less inclined to transition to DTV and feel they need to subscribe to cable or satellite service. We must make sure that all consumers regardless of their in- come level continue to receive expected services, so I look forward to hearing your testimony, and again want to hear comments re- garding the transition that will occur along the U.S. -Mexican bor- der because I really do believe that we are going to disenfranchise a very large population. And with that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Markey. The gentlelady’s time has expired. The chair recog- nizes the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Dingell. 8 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. DINGELL, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHI- GAN Mr. Dingell. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your kindness. I commend you for holding this meeting, which is an important one, on a very important subject, and I commend you for the vigor with which you are going into this matter. I want to begin by welcoming Meredith Baker, who is the new acting head of NTIA. I want to say that I appreciate her willingness to work with the Congress and her leadership and her effort to help achieve a successful transition on digital TV service. This is very important, and quite frankly it represents something of a welcome change in some of the policies we have seen from this Administration, so congratulations and wel- come. Mr. Chairman, today we address an issue that is soon going to affect millions of American households, and I commend you for your leadership and vigorousness in this matter. I refer to the dig- ital TV, or DTV, transition. We are just a little over a year away from the end of the transition, at which time a lot of television sets around the country are going to go dark, and much remains to be done. Consumers must be properly educated, and they are not. Both the Federal Communications Commission and a number of in- dustries stand to benefit handsomely from this matter and they all have responsibilities of the most serious sort with regard to these matters. As February 17, 2009 nears, we must learn of new steps that must be taken, and I note that time is running short and the American consuming public has little appreciation of what lies be- fore them. The FCC has recently requested $20 million for DTV consumer education in fiscal year 2009. I still find this amount, however, woefully short and inadequate for an educational campaign that is to reach some 300 million Americans. Chairman Martin has also circulated an order regarding consumer education in response to a letter sent by you, Mr. Chairman, and by me. I commend you for moving forward on this important matter, and I look forward to the cooperation and assistance of Chairman Martin and to hearing from and seeing vigorous agency action on this question. This week, Mr. Chairman, you and I, joined by 19 of our colleagues, sent a letter to NTIA concerning reissuing converter box coupons to con- sumers whose original coupons have expired. This 90-day coupon expiration date is cause for concern because consumers might not be able to find stores with boxes in stock be- fore the coupons expire. I understand, Ms. Baker, NTIA, along with their vendor, IBM, are working to resolve this problem, and I thank them for their efforts. We must be mindful of the situation confronting low power broadcasters. Only full power broadcasters are required to transi- tion to digital next year. Low power and translator stations may take more time. This means that in some markets some stations will be broadcasting only in digital after February 17, 2009, while other stations will continue to broadcast in analog. This could lead to some very serious complications and complexities. The potential for confusion here appears high for those con- sumers that acquire a digital converter box and then are not able 9 to receive analog channels. This has the potential for more mischief and confusion. I want to applaud those manufacturers who have in- cluded an analog pass through feature in their converter boxes to address this problem, as well as those who are in the process of adding this feature. I urge NTIA to quickly approve these boxes. I also expect low power and translator stations to do their part to educate their viewers about the need to purchase a converter box with analog pass through capabilities, and of course we need those kinds of boxes at an early time. Finally, some of the biggest bene- ficiaries of the DTV transition are the nation’s retailers. The con- verter box coupon campaign and program will plow more than $1 billion into the stores of eligible retailers. Some consumers will choose to buy new televisions instead of converter boxes and many will purchase other items, such as CDs or video games, while they are in the store using coupons. For re- tailers, the DTV transition will certainly be profitable. I therefore urge the industry to be vigorous in its efforts to properly educate consumers. I am told as of yesterday that Wal-Mart no longer has analog only televisions on its shelves, and last year Best Buy pulled all analog stock from its stores. RadioShack has agreed to ship converter boxes to consumers free of charge and remove all analog sets from its stores by March 1. I applaud these decisions. They are pro-consumer. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your lead- ership in this matter, and I look forward to the testimony today. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Dingell follows:] Statement of Hon. John D. Dingell Today we again address an issue that will soon affect millions of American house- holds — the digital TV (DTV) transition. We are just over a year away from the end of the transition, and much remains to be done. Consumers must be properly edu- cated. Both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the several indus- tries that stand to benefit handsomely have responsibilities in this regard. As Feb- ruary 17, 2009, nears, we learn of new steps that must be taken, and time is run- ning short. The FCC has recently requested $20 million for DTV consumer education in fiscal year 2009. I still find this amount, however, woefully inadequate for an educational campaign that must reach more than 300 million Americans. Chairman Martin has also circulated an Order regarding consumer education in response to a letter sent by Chairman Markey and me. I commend the Chairman for moving forward on this important matter and look forward to agency action on this question. This week. Chairman Markey and I, joined by 19 of our colleagues, sent a letter to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) con- cerning reissuing converter box coupons to consumers whose original coupons have expired. The 90-day coupon expiration date is a cause for concern because con- sumers might be unable to find stores with boxes in stock before their coupons ex- pire. I understand that Ms. Baker and the NTIA, along with their vendor IBM, are working to solve this problem, and I thank them for their efforts. We must be mindful of the situation confronting low power broadcasters. Only full power broadcasters are required to transition to digital next year - low power and translator stations may take more time. This means that in some markets, some stations will be broadcasting only in digital after February 17, 2009, while other sta- tions will continue to broadcast in analog. The potential for confusion appears high for those consumers that acquire a digital converter box and then are not able to receive analog channels. I applaud those manufacturers who have included an analog pass-through feature in their converter boxes to address this problem, as well as those who are in the process of adding this feature. I urge NTIA to quickly approve these boxes. I also 10 expect low power and translator stations to do their part to educate their viewers about the need to purchase a converter box with analog pass-through capabilities. Finally, some of the biggest beneficiaries of the DTV transition are the Nation’s retailers. The converter box coupon program will plow more than one billion dollars into the stores of eligible retailers. Some consumers will choose to buy new tele- visions instead of converter boxes, and many will purchase other items, such as CDs or video games, while they are in a store using their coupons. For retailers, the DTV transition will certainly be profitable. I therefore urge the industry to be vigorous in its efforts to properly educate consumers. I am told that as of yesterday, Wal- Mart no longer has analog-only televisions on its shelves, and last year Best Buy pulled all analog stock from its stores. Radio Shack has agreed to ship converter boxes to consumers free of charge and will remove all analog sets from its stores by March 1. I applaud these pro-consumer decisions. Thank you again Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to the testimony. Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Eshoo. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ANNA G. ESHOO, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALI- FORNIA Ms. Eshoo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for creating another ex- cellent opportunity for our subcommittee to assess the progress on the digital transition. There are many issues. Of course members have raised them, and we know that there are still some that are left unresolved as we approach the 2009 deadline. It is nice to see you, Mr. Klink. I wish you were still up here. Today many mem- bers are going to be visited by their constituent public television stations, and the stations are going to express their concern that access to local public television stations digital programming is de- nied to almost half of all direct broadcast satellite households. Now that represents nearly 12 million households because one major DBS provider has failed to negotiate a long-term deal with public television. Last November I introduced a bill, H.R. 4121, to require DBS carriage of public television digital signals, and I am pleased that a little more than a month ago DirecTV, the Association for Public Television stations, and PBS announced that they had reached an agreement whereby DirecTV would carry public television stations digital signals. As we move closer to February 17, 2009, I think it is unacceptable for any household in the country to be denied ac- cess to public television’s digital programming. The American peo- ple love PBS, and we have done a lot of battles here over the years to help protect it so I don’t think this is a small item on the agen- da. I am anxious to hear from Mr. Jackson, who is going to testify why EchoStar carries HD programming for all the major commer- cial networks but doesn’t provide HD programming produced by public television stations. And I will have more questions to ask in this particular area as well as other questions, so we are moving along. I think that there is some progress. I am disturbed most frankly, Mr. Chairman, not Chairman Markey but Chairman Martin, about the treatment of cable by you. I don’t know what cable has done to so enrage you but I think we need to have a conversation about that because we have important providers throughout the country and I think the relationships are really very important and I want to hear more 11 about what is so troubling you about them. So thank you, Chair- man Markey, and I look forward to the testimony today. [The prepared statement of Ms. Eshoo follows:] Statement of Hon. Anna G. Eshoo Mr. Chairman today is another excellent opportunity for this Subcommittee to as- sess our progress on the digital transition. There are several issues that are still left unresolved as we approach the 2009 deadline. Today many Members will be visited by their constituent public television sta- tions. The stations will express their concern that access to local public television stations’ digital programming is denied to almost half of all Direct Broadcast Sat- ellite (DBS) households - that’s nearly 12 million households because one major DBS provider has failed to negotiate a long term deal with public television. Last November, I introduced H.R. 4121 to require DBS carriage of public tele- vision stations’ digital signals. I’m very pleased that, a little more than a month later, DIRECTV, Association for Public Television Stations (APTS) and PBS an- nounced they reached an agreement whereby DIRECTV would carry public tele- vision stations’ digital signals. As we move closer to February 17, 2009, it is unac- ceptable for any household to be denied access to public television’s digital program- ming. I’m anxious to hear from Mr. Jackson why EchoStar carries HD programming for all the major commercial networks but does not provide HD programming produced by public television stations. I’d also like to know the status of the negotiations be- tween EchoStar and public television stations on signing a long term agreement for the carriage of public television’s HD programming. I’m also interested to hear from Mr. Rehr of NAB about what commercial 11 broadcasters are planning for their multicast stations. Right now in my District not one commercial broadcaster produces additional content on these extra channels, ex- cept some who ai the weather radar 24 hours a day, but public television stations across the country are using their additional channels. In my District KQED has five new channels they are broadcasting today. KQED has a channel dedicated to children’s programming, and another 24 hour Spanish language channel. I’d like Mr. Rehr to explain why commercial broadcasters are not producing con- tent for these extra channels. Why is public television able to produce and air this content while commercial broadcasters are leaving these channels fallow? Mr. Markey. I thank the gentlelady. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington State, Mr. Inslee. Mr. Inslee. I will waive, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Mr. Markey. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for having this hearing, and I hope over the next year we will continue to have these hearings and hopefully bring attention to the transition. In fact, maybe the folks who are responsible whether it be the news media or anyone else maybe we ought to treat the transition to DTV like we are see- ing the presidential primaries. So much coverage on them, a lot more interest than in the past, and so for the next year I would hope we would do that because none of us want our constituents or your customers not to be able to watch TV. We are just over a year away from the transition date and there are still many ques- tions and preparations and outreach efforts made by various gov- ernment entities involved in the transition. Last week Wired News and Technology web site magazine ran an article to point out many of the same concerns that the sub- committee has been raising over the last year, lack of coordinated 12 consumer education program, having consumers apply for coupons before converter boxes were on the shelves. The 90-day expiration date of the coupons are major problems the article said, as well as members of the subcommittee have raised. Yesterday I joined Chairman Dingell and Chairman Markey and several members of our committee in sending a letter to Assistant Secretary Baker ask- ing her to address one of these issues. Currently without boxes widely available it is unclear how read- ily consumers will be able to find an affordable coupon-eligible box. The 90-day expiration date could be a major complication for con- sumers if there is a disruption in production, shipping or stocking these boxes. Additionally, the article stated the Best Buy spokes- man said their stores are only planning to carry one model con- verter box that sells for $59.99. Up selling has been a serious con- cern. I am afraid consumers will not be as prepared as they need to be or as many as the government thinks they will when they walk into the store looking for a converter box. The letter sent yes- terday clarifies and under the statute creating these coupon pro- grams NTIA can allow households to apply to have expired coupons reissued if there are sufficient funds. This would allow consumers more flexibility in finding converter boxes and address many sup- ply problems that are out of their hands. I am concerned, however, that many consumers do not know about the program and how to apply for these coupons. Most esti- mates indicate 14 million to 20 million households allowing over the air broadcasts, yet according to NTIA stats earlier this week only 2.8 million households have applied for the coupons. Some households may go ahead and purchase a new set with the digital tuner whether than applying for converter box coupons but the number of the applications still seem low given that the program has been up and running for a month and a half, and I think more needs to be done to raise the awareness of the program. After the hearing last November Congressman Gonzalez and I sent a letter to the House Administration Committee, and we re- ceived certification that as members we can include coupon applica- tions in our newsletters to our constituents, which I plan to do in one this spring. As far as I am concerned, public education is the most critical and least coordinated component of the transition, and we are relying too heavily on the private sector to address that component along with the 800 help lines need to be staffed so oper- ators can help consumers when they call in. I understand there were problems with the Spanish language help line at the FCC ear- lier this year and I hope to hear Chairman Martin explain to us what you have done to correct that problem, and I will have some questions later on that issue. I thank you and yield back my time. Mr. Markey. The gentleman’s time has expired. The chair recog- nizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus. Mr. Shimkus. Mr. Chairman, I think I feel like Groundhog Day, our fourth or fifth DTV hearing, so I think I will just yield back and wait for the testimony. I was just being a little jovial, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Markey. No, it is Groundhog Day, and we are going to have Groundhog Day over and over again on this transition because the consequences of not getting it right are catastrophic. So all time for 13 opening statements from members has expired. So we turn to our panel, and we welcome them to the subcommittee. We welcome you back, Chairman Martin. You have been a frequent guest before us over the last year. We thank you for that. And we congratulate you, Ms. Baker, for your promotion, and congratulations to you and thank you for joining this team to insure that this transition occurs on time and without a glitch, so we thank you both. Chairman Martin, the last time you were here I said that you were the Tom Brady of the transition. I would like to now say I would like you to be the Eh Manning of the transition, and my hope is that we can put a plan in place that will work. Whenever you are com- fortable, please begin. STATEMENT OF KEVIN J. MARTIN, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, WASHINGTON, D.C. Mr. Martin. Thank you. Good morning. Chairman Markey, and Ranking Member Stearns, and all the members of the committee. Thank you for once again inviting me to be here today to update you on the status of the digital transition. A little over one year from today all television stations will stop broadcasting in analog and only broadcast in digital. This transition will be a historic mo- ment in the evolution of television. Television viewers will be able to enjoy movie quality picture and sound and potentially a wealth of new programming choices. It will also allow us to significantly improve public safety communications and will usher in a new era of advanced wireless services such as widespread deployment of wireless broadband. As I have testified previously successful digital transition will de- pend upon minimizing the burdens placed on consumers and maxi- mizing their ability to benefit from it. Today’s hearing is a welcome opportunity to discuss the commission’s work both in terms of con- sumer outreach and education and the necessary regulatory steps, which we are taking so that all Americans can enjoy the benefits of this historic digital transition. The commission is working to put in place the rules and policies to enable broadcasters to technically complete the conversion from analog to digital. Last August we adopted the final DTV table of allotments based on the channel elections made by all the full power broadcast stations. This order provides virtually all, over 99 percent of television stations across the country with their final digital channel assignments. At the end of last year we also concluded our third DTV periodic review. In that order the commission established the procedures and rules that will guide the broadcasters through the end of the transition. We adopted procedures that will allow broadcasters to adjust their build out according to their needs and the needs of their viewers. Currently more than 95 percent of full power tele- vision stations are broadcasting a digital signal. Nearly two-thirds of the full power stations will remain on the same channel they are currently using for the digital services and most of these stations have already completed the construction and already providing full service to their viewers. We recognize it is important for the commission to continually monitor the broadcaster’s progress towards the transition, and ac- cordingly we required each station to file periodic updates on the 14 status of the construction of the post-transition facility and in fact the first of such updates is due next week. The commission has be- fore it an item that would enable satellite subscribers to receive digital broadcast signals. The pending item clarifies that when broadcasters make the transition it is the digital signal that their satellite operator must carry. Last fall the commission adopted an order that guarantees that all cable customers will be able to watch all broadcast stations after the digital transition. Specifically, the commission took action to insure that cable operators continue to make signals of all broadcast stations viewable after the transition as the statute requires. These items should help reduce the burden on consumers and thereby fostering a smooth transition. The commission’s DTV re- lated enforcement efforts have focused on protecting consumers from unknowingly buying televisions that won’t receive broadcast stations following the transition. With respect to the commission’s labeling requirements, the commission has as of February 11, today, 2008, inspected 1,829 retail stores and web sites and issued 316 citations notifying those retailers of violations for failing to comply with our requirements. We also have 14 NALs with $4 mil- lion total aggregate pending before the commission. In addition to our labeling investigations, we are continuing to insure that no manufacturers are importing and shipping analog only television receivers. We are also insuring that the digital tun- ers comply with the V-Chip regulations. Thanks to information re- ferred to us by you, Mr. Chairman, we began investigating allega- tions that some manufacturers were not complying with these V- Chip rules. As a result of these investigations, we released an NAL against Funai Corporation for $7.7 million and NALs against 9 other manufacturers for over $6.5 million are also on circulation. The swift enforcement of all these DTV-relates rules is critical to protecting consumers and reducing potential confusion. Our activi- ties in this area will continue to be a priority during the next 12 months. According to data from the Consumer Electronics Associa- tion and the National Association of Broadcasters there has been some success in making consumers aware of the transition. Recent surveys published by the NAB and Consumers Union found that 79 percent and 64 percent of consumers were aware of the transition, respectively. While this increased awareness is a step in the right direction too many Americans remain confused about what they need to do to prepare for it. For instance, the Consumers Union reported that 74 percent of consumers have major misconceptions about the im- pact that this conversion will have on them. Now that many con- sumers are aware of the transition, we need to focus our efforts and our outreach on sending them a clear and consistent message about how to get prepared. At the suggestion of Chairman Dingell and Chairman Markey the commission is considering a proposal to require the industry to use public service announcements, bill in- serts, and other techniques to educate consumers about the transi- tion. Just last Friday we received a proposal from the National As- sociation of Broadcasters setting forth alternative actions as a safe harbor that broadcasters could take to educate consumers about the transition. 15 We are currently in the process of evaluating this new proposal and hope to finalize this item quickly. In addition to our DTV con- sumer education item, the commission is actively and directly pro- moting consumer awareness of the upcoming transition. Nearly every bureau and office of the commission has been involved in this effort including our field offices around the country. At the sugges- tion of several other commissioners, I have asked the Media Bu- reau Chief Monica Desai and Consumer and Government Affairs Bureau Chief Cathy Seidel to jointly lead an intra-agency task force of staff from the various bureaus and offices who are pri- marily working to facilitate the DTV transition over the next year. We are also utilizing commission staff located around the coun- try. FCC field offices and FCC field agents are continuing to dis- tribute information at senior centers, libraries, and other local venues. They have already distributed information to over 3,100 senior and community seniors, made 385 presentations, and have 106 scheduled in just the days ahead. We have also been forging new partnerships and participated in media events, attending con- ferences, and continuing to do whatever we can to get the word out. For example, DTV education posters will be displayed in all 34,000 post offices around the country. The United States Postal Service estimates that an average of 9 million people pass through their re- tail lobbies each day. We have also secured commitments from 24 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to display DTV materials in 1,100 Department of Motor Vehicle locations. The FCC’s consumer efforts and outreach continue to place emphasis on consumers that receive their television signals over the air on those who are hard to reach including senior citizens, non-English speaking and minority com- munities, people with disabilities, and low income individuals and people living in rural areas. We have been taking several specific steps to reach each of these groups. For example, the AARP has agreed to disseminate digital transition information through its tax aid program that makes volunteers available to assist AARP mem- bers in preparing their taxes. We also know that the Hispanic com- munity disproportionately relies on over the air television. Of the 15 million broadcast only homes one-third is occupied by primarily Spanish-speaking homes. The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and Univision have agreed to join the commission in conducting DTV awareness sessions at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and member chambers in the 10 biggest cities nationwide which are home to 80 percent of the Hispanic population. The first of these sessions will be held later this month in Chicago. The commission is also taking steps to in- form low income consumers about the transition to all digital broadcasting. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services has made a commitment to assist the FCC in dissemi- nating DTV materials through at least 6 of their agencies to target populations including low income consumers. For example, through their administration for children and families they will distribute information through their approximately 1,500 Head Start grantees covering more than 6,000 locations throughout the country. And their Health Resources and Services Administration will dis- tribute flyers and information through their 4,000 community 16 health centers. This morning I am also pleased to announce that today the commission’s contract and purchasing center were award- ed a contract at Ketchum. Under this contract Ketchum is going to he responsible for assisting the FCC’s efforts to promote consumer awareness of the DTV transition. Specifically in the area of media services Ketchum provides full service production of multiple versions of TV and radio PSAs, weh videos, educational videos, podcasts, and satellite media tours. The material developed will he produced in multiple languages and formats. In addition, Ketchum is planning to support advertising on tran- sit systems in 18 cities in over 300 locations. Having awarded this contract, we are working with Ketchum to jump start our efforts by arranging a satellite media tour next week to highlight the switch to digital one year before the deadline. We are also asking Ketchum to develop specific plans for using grocery stores and other retail outlets frequented by our target audiences. Although I believe that a lot of progress has been made to facilitate a smooth transition there is obviously still more work to be done. For exam- ple, one of the areas that the commission has recently been spend- ing a lot of time on is how to best insure that consumers will con- tinue to be able to view low power television stations which are not required in transition to digital next year. I have proposed a goal of 2012 for all low power stations to tran- sition to digital. In the mean time I have asked that the leaders of several industry organizations to take voluntary steps to help consumers continue to watch all broadcast television programming after the transition. Mr. Markey. Mr. Chairman, right now you are 4 minutes over so if you could reach that summary. Mr. Martin. Sure. Certainly the next 12 months will be chal- lenging. Nevertheless, it is my hope that through all the combined efforts of the government, industry, and consumer groups we will reap the rewards of the digital transition and the benefits it has to offer, and I look forward to continuing to work with this com- mittee and all the members of Congress to answer their questions and work to make this a successful transition next year. [The prepared statement of Mr. Martin follows:] 17 Written Statement Of The Honorable Kevin J. Martin Chairman Federal Communications Commission Before the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet U.S. House of Representatives February 13, 2008 18 Good morning Chairman Dingell, Chairman Markey, Ranking Member Barton, Ranking Member Upton, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me here today to update you on the status of the digital transition. A little over one year from today, on February 17, 2009, all full power television stations in this country will stop broadcasting in analog, and broadcast exclusively in digital, as mandated by Congress in the Digital Television and Public Safety Act of 2005. A successful digital transition will depend upon minimizing the burdens placed on consumers and maximizing their ability to benefit from it. The DTV transition will be a historic moment in the evolution of TV. Television viewers will be able to enjoy movie quality picture and sound and potentially a wealth of new programming choices. It also will allow us to significantly improve public safety communications and will usher in a new era of advanced wireless services such as the widespread deployment of wireless broadband. According to data from the Consumer Electronics Association and the National Association of Broadcasters, consumer awareness of the transition has grown in recent years. It is up 80% since 2006, according to CEA, and has more than doubled since 2007, reports NAB. And recent surveys published by NAB and Consumers Union found 79% and 64% of consumers were aware of the transition respectively. That more and more viewers are aware of the transition is a step in the right direction. However, the Consumers Union also found that 74% of consumers have “major misconceptions” about 19 the impact of the transition on them, fn other words, too many Americans remain confused about what they need to do to prepare for it. Taken together, these surveys are valuable research tools to better guide our education and outreach efforts over the next twelve months. This recently released data also demonstrates that facilitating a successful DTV transition is an enormous undertaking. And it is one which no single entity, public or private, can achieve alone. Rather it requires the commitment and cooperation of government, industry and consumer groups. We have made that commitment and are actively working with these important stakeholders. Last week I participated in an event marking one year before the transition at a local Best Buy store which sells digital televisions and will be selling digital to analog converter boxes. Commerce Secretary Gutierrez, Meredith Baker and I were joined there by top representatives of the nation’s broadcasters, cable operators, and the consumer electronics industry. We are working together, along with others inside and outside of government, in an unprecedented public-private partnership to educate consumers throughout the country about what they need to do to be able to watch TV following the transition as they did before. Today’s hearing is a welcome opportunity to discuss our work with all of our DTV partners both in terms of outreach and education and necessary regulatory steps to ensure all Americans can share the benefits of this historic digital transition. 20 UPDATE ON POWER BROADCASTERS TRANSITION TO DIGITAL Currently, more than 95 percent of full power television stations are broadcasting a digital signal. Nearly two-thirds of full power stations (1180) will remain on the same channel they are currently using for digital service. The majority of these stations, over 850, have completed construction and are providing full service to their viewers. The remainder, roughly 300, are working on completing construction of their full service facilities. One-third of full power stations, (roughly 600, are changing channels for their operation after the transition), and are currently filing construction permit applications with the Commission, ordering equipment, and scheduling tower crews. The Commission has adopted the final DTV table of allotments based on the channel elections made by the full power broadcast stations. This order provided virtually all (over 99%) of these telex ision stations across the country with their final channel assignments for broadcasting in digital following the DTV transition. By finalizing broadcasters’ channel allotments, the Commission helped ensure that the analog spectrum the broadcasters are vacating will be available as planned by 2009. We also concluded the Third DTV Periodic Review, which adopted the procedures and rules to guide broadcasters through the end of the transition. Among other important decisions, this order adopted the interference standard for post-transition applications and forecast the date, later this year, when the Commission will consider requests from broadcasters to expand their station facilities. 21 In the Third DTV Periodic Review, the Commission recognized that stations will need flexibility to complete the transition. Consequently we adopted procedures that will allow broadcasters to adjust their buildout according to their needs and the needs of their viewers. We will consider requests from broadcasters that find it necessary to reduce analog service before the transition date, but they will be required to inform their viewers well in advance of any reductions. In addition to getting the proper rules in place, it is important that progress be carefully monitored. Accordingly, to enable the Commission to closely track broadcasters’ progress toward completing their transition, we required each station to file and update with the Commission by next week the status of the construction of its post transition facility. The Commission will make this information available to Congress, to the broadcast industry, and to the public. In addition to earlier updates, broadcasters must report their status again by October 20, 2008. CARRIAGE OF DIGITAL SIGNALS Last fall, the Commission adopted an order that guarantees that all cable customers will be able to watch all broadcast stations after the digital transition. Specifically, the Commission took action to ensure cable operators continue to make signals of all broadcast stations viewable after the transition, as the statute requires. As a result, we significantly reduced the number of Americans potentially needing a converter box to watch broadcast stations post-transition. Making sure the almost 35 million households that subscribe to analog cable will be able to continue to watch broadcast television after 22 the transition as they did before allows us to focus our energies on assisting the nearly 1 5 million households that rely exclusively on over-the-air signals. The Commission now has before it an item that would enable satellite subscribers to receive digital broadcast signals, as well. Currently, the law requires that when a satellite operator chooses to carry any local broadcast signals, it must carry all full power local broadcast signals in that market. The pending item clarifies that, in such a “local-into- local” market, where a full power television station is broadcasting only in digital, it is the digital signal that the satellite operator carries. This clarification is critical to ensuring that satellite customers, like cable customers, will continue to receive the same broadcast stations they saw the day before the transition on the day after the transition. Finally, I also recently circulated an item that would clarify the process for when and how broadcasters will elect carriage of their digital signals. Specifically, consistent with existing rules, broadcasters must decide by October 1, 2008 whether they want to assert their must carry rights or negotiate for carriage of their broadcast signal for the years 2009-201 1. We propose to clarify in the pending item that whichever decision they make, it will apply to their analog signal before the transition date and their digital signal after that date. These items should help reduce the burden on consumers thereby fostering a smooth transition. 23 ENFORCEMENT The Commission’s DTV-re!ated enforcement efforts have focused on protecting consumers from unknowingly buying televisions that won’t receive broadcast stations following the transition. Specifically, we are enforcing three rules: 1) the requirement to label any remaining televisions with analog-only tuners; 2) the prohibition on the importation and shipment of television receivers without integrated digital tuners; and 3) the requirement that the V-Chip functions with the digital technology. With respect to the Commission’s labeling requirement, the Commission has, as of February 11, 2008, inspected 1829 retail stores and websites and issued 316 citations notifying retailers of violations for failing to comply with our requirements. Because retailers are not licensees, we must give them a citation prior to issuing a Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL). We currently have NALs pending against 14 retailers. These fines in the aggregate total almost S4 million. In addition, the Enforcement Bureau has issued another seven NALs. It is my hope that through our vigorous enforcement actions, retailers will take concrete actions to avoid consumer confusion as the digital transition draws near. In addition to our labeling investigations, we are continuing to ensure that no manufacturers are importing and shipping analog-only television receivers and equipment. We have issued NALs against two companies - Syntax Brillian Corp. (approx. $2.9 million) and Regent USA, Inc. ($63,650) - for apparent violation of our rules in this area. One of these companies has already paid the fine and a forfeiture order 24 with respect to the other company is on circulation. In addition, we are in the process of investigating potential violations against several other companies. I hope to quickly bring these matters to resolution. Finally, we are ensuring that the digital tuners comply with the V-Chip regulations. As you know, the Commission’s rules require digital television manufacturers to include the V-Chip in their equipment and to ensure that their devices can adjust to changes in the content advisory system. Thanks to the information referred to us by Chairman Markey, we began investigating allegations that some manufacturers were not complying with our rules. As a result of these investigations we released an NAL against Funai Corporation for $7.7 million. NALs against nine other manufacturers, totaling over $6.5 million are also on circulation. Swift enforcement of all our DTV-related rules is critical to protecting consumers and reducing potential confusion. Our activities in this area will continue to be a priority during the next 1 2 months. CONSUMER EDUCATION AND OUTREACH In order to educate consumers properly, all parties involved in the transition - - the FCC, NTIA, the broadcasters, the cable industry, satellite, manufacturers, retailers, consumer groups - - need to put forth correct, clear and eonsistent messages about how to get prepared. 25 I commend the industry for the consumer education campaigns that they have initiated. Specifically, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) launched a $697 million campaign that includes, among other things, television spots, 30 minute education programs about DTV and a 100-day countdown to the February 17, 2009 deadline. In addition, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA) launched a $200 million campaign that includes, among other things, sending customer communication “tool kits” to all their cable systems nationwide, and distributing brochures about the transition at community and public events. At the suggestion of Chairmen Dingell and Markey, the Commission initiated a DTV Education Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). This NPRM sought comment on whether to require the industry to use bill inserts, public service announcements, and other techniques to educate consumers about the transition. As you suggested, I have circulated a proposal to my colleagues that requires broadcasters to use PSAs and screen crawls throughout the day, including during the prime time hours, to inform viewers about the transition and to publicly report on these education efforts on a quarterly basis. The item also requires MVPDs to provide monthly inserts about the DTV transition in their customer billing statements. The item also requires manufacturers of television receivers and related devices to provide notice to consumers of the transition’s impact on that equipment. In addition, we require the partners listed on the Commission’s www.dtv.gov website to provide the Commission with quarterly updates on their consumer education efforts. Finally, the item states that 26 we will work with the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) to ensure that the retailers participating in the converter box program are appropriately training their employees and informing consumers. Just last Friday we received a proposal from NAB setting forth alternative actions as a safe harbor that broadcasters could take to educate consumers about the transition. We are currently in the process of evaluating this new proposal and hope to finalize this item quickly. In addition to our DTV Consumer Education item, the Commission is actively and directly promoting consumer awareness of the upcoming transition through its own education and outreach efforts. The FCC's consumer outreach effort places an emphasis on consumers who receive their television signals \"over-the-air\" and on those who are hard to reach and may be unaware of the upcoming transition, including .senior citizens; non-English speaking and minority communities; people with disabilities; low-income individuals; and people living in mral and tribal areas. We have been forging partnerships, participating in media events, attending conferences, and doing whatever we can to get the word out. For example, DTV education posters will be displayed in all 34,000 post offices across the nation. The United States Postal 27 Service estimates that an average of 9 million people pass through their retail lobbies each day. We have also secured commitments from 24 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to display DTV materials in 1100 Department of Motor Vehicle locations. Specifically, we have secured commitments with Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. You will also be seeing billboards about the transition on buses and in subway stations in large metropolitan areas such as here in the DC Metro transit system. The FCC also distributed DTV transition awareness information that will be provided to all federal government employees. We estimate that this message will reach over 2.5 million people around the country. We also know that some consumers will be disproportionately impacted by the transition or are harder to reach than the population at large. Therefore we have been taking specific steps to reach these groups. Specifically, we have been focusing our resources on three primary activities: attending conferences and hosting workshops, disseminating information via the news media, and partnering with industry, consumer, and other 28 groups. I would like to take a few minutes to describe our efforts targeted at each of these five communities. Senior Citizens: Senior citizens are more likely to have older television sets relying exclusively on over the air broadcasting. We have partnered with organizations that specifically serve this harder to reach population such as the AARP. For example, we are working with AARP to disseminate digital transition information through their Tax Aid Program that makes volunteers available to assist AARP members in preparing their taxes. As part of this program, FCC-prepared DTV information sheets, in English and Spanish, are being made available to 32,000 volunteers across the country for distribution as they visit low and moderate income taxpayers, with special attention to those individuals 60 and older. And, last September, we presented two DTV education sessions at the national AARP convention in Boston and we have plans to make similar presentations at this year’s convention in Washington, DC. In addition, late last fall, I was interviewed about the transition on AARP radio which is broadcast on 170 outlets nationwide reaching more than 1 ,000,000 people. In addition to working with AARP, we have also been working with other senior organizations as well. For example, I taped a PSA to be aired on Retirement Living TV which reaches nearly 30 million homes nationwide and participated in a story about the transition for a newsletter read by the 6.4 million residents of Erikson retirement 29 communities. We are also pleased to be partnering with The National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (N4A) to cosponsor DTV awareness sessions during the coming year in conjunction with their 655 area offices throughout the nation. This is a useful opportunity to educate caregivers, social workers and others who care for the elderly. In addition to working with these organizations, we have also set up partnerships with the State Aging Offices in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Michigan, Louisiana, Arizona, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Tennessee. These states are including information about the DTV transition in outreach materials, and at conferences. We are optimistic that in the coming weeks we wdl have similar commitments from additional state offices. We are also putting to work on this issue Commission staff located around the country. FCC field agents are continuing to distribute information materials to senior centers, libraries and other local venues frequented by older Americans. Through the work of our field agents, we are able to reach these consumers in a total of 36 states - ranging from Alaska to Florida. We have already distributed information to over 3133 senior centers, senior organizations, and community groups and given nearly 385 presentations with 106 more scheduled in the days ahead. The FCC also held a DTV Workshop focusing on seniors at FCC Headquarters on November 8, 2007. It consisted of two panels discussing the transition’s effect on seniors plus exhibits by industry. Based on the discussions at that Workshop, we reached out to 30 faith-based organizations, provided them with consumer education materials on the transition, and continue to follow up with them to answer questions on the transition. Non-English Speakers and Minorities: The Hispanic community disproportionately relies on over-the-air television. Of the 1 5 million broadcast only homes, one-third are occupied by primarily Spanish speakers. Indeed, almost half (43%) of homes where Spanish is the primary language rely exclusively on over-the-air broadcasting for their television. The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce has agreed to join the Commission in conducting DTV awareness sessions at member chambers in the 10 biggest cities nationwide which are home to 80% of the Hispanic population. The first of these sessions will be held later this month in Chicago. Similarly, we have also partnered with Univision to hold DTV awareness sessions at Town Hall meetings designed to educate members of its Spanish speaking audience. Additionally, we have taped several on-air interviews regarding the digital transition for Univision’s news and public affairs programs airing both in local markets and nationally. These interviews were done by Keyla Hemandez-Ulloa the Commission staffer hired to spearhead outreach to the Hispanic community. We have been discussing the switch to digital on other Hispanic media outlets as well. For example, I did an interview with the Hispanic Communications Network, which produces material for radio, television, print and Internet, that will be distributed to its 230 member radio network in the United States and Puerto Rico. 31 We want to work with other foreign language media outlets as well. To that end we have partnered with KTSF, a major Asian TV station in San Francisco, to put 5,000 English and Chinese DTV one page flyers at their booth during the Chinese New Year celebration events in late February. Last year approximately 100,000 people attended this festival. The FCC held a DTV Workshop focusing on non-English speakers and minorities on December 4, 2007. As a result of that Workshop, we will be conducting a nationally available Internet seminar or “webinar” about the DTV transition on April 8th for librarians in the Webjunction Spanish Outreach Program. These librarians provide library services to Spanish speakers. We will also be providing them with a Spanish version of the presentation on DVD for distribution to libraries. Finally, following the workshop, we translated our DTV one page flyer into Hmong and Arabic (in addition to English, Spanish, Viemarnese, Chinese, Tagalog, French and Russian). In addition, we plan to participate in a number of national conventions representing non- English speaking and minority consumers in 2008. They include the 78\"' Annual Conference for League of United Latin American Citizens, the Annual National Hispanic Leadership Conference and the National Council of La Raza Conference, the NAACP Convention, the National Urban League Conference and the Organization of Chinese Americans National Conference. 32 People with Disabilities: The Commission is also taking specific steps to inform people with disabilities about tbe transition to all digital broadcasting. On February 28, 2008, tbe FCC is sponsoring a DTV Consumer Education Workshop designed to build upon these efforts. Also, later this month the Commission’s DTV website, DTV.gov, will feature a video in American Sign Language for the deaf and hard of hearing community. Our most commonly utilized publications are available in Braille and audio format and all our fact sheets and advisories are available in large print. In addition, we have two specific publications addressing DTV and closed captioning, “Closed Captioning for Digital Television,” and Closed Captioning and Digital-to-Analog Converter Boxes for Viewing Free Over-the- Air Programming on Analog Televisions.” The Commission also has a dedicated email box for closed captioning questions at c loscdcantioninglrt fee sro v. Commission staff continues to attend conferences to distribute DTV educational materials to people with disabilities. For example, the FCC has attended and provided DTV materials at the National Black Deaf Advocates Conference, the Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities Conference and the Emergency Planning and Response for Special Needs and Disabilities Conference. In all, we have collaborated with disability advocacy groups and outreach organizations. For instance, the Hearing Loss Association of America (“HLAA”) is already linking to our DTV informational materials on its website, which receives approximately one million hits per month. In addition, HLAA has committed to publish an article on DTV 33 and closed captioning in Hearing Loss Magazine, which is estimated to reach a readership of 200,000 people. Furthermore, HLAA has 200 local and regional chapters around the country, and we plan to conduct DTV Awareness Sessions at their monthly meetings throughout the course of the year. We also plan to utilize our Enforcement Bureau's Field Office staff and CGB staff to distribute DTV informational and educational materials at HLAA's \"Walk4Hearing\" events across the country taking place this spring through the fall. Low Income Consumers: The Commission is also taking specific steps to inform low-income consumers about the transition to all digital broadcasting. For example, the Department of Flealth and Human Services has made a commitment to assist the FCC in disseminating DTV material to target populations, including low-income consumers. In addition, on April 1, 2008, the FCC will sponsor a DTV Consumer Education Workshop that will focus on reaching low-income consumers. Rural and Tribal Consumers: The Commission is also taking specific steps to inform people living in rural and tribal lands about the transition to all digital broadcasting. For example, the Commission recently established a partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture’s 4-H office. We will be providing DTV information at approximately 150 state and county fairs and will be conducting “Train the Trainer” workshops at 4-H leadership 34 conferences. After attending these training sessions 4-H members can help spread the word to their families and communities about getting ready for February 17, 2009. We also have forged a partnership with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This collaboration has resulted in the distribution of DTV materials throughout Indian Country, utilizing all 50 of their nationwide area offices. Commission staff has attended and provided DTV materials at the National Conference of American Indians, and the Rural TeleCon Conference, with many additional events planned for this year such as participation in the National Association of Development Organizations in Alaska Conference and the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians Annual Conference. Finally, on January 3 1 , 2008, we held a workshop at Commission headquarters focused on reaching rural consumers and consumers on tribal lands. We received many useful suggestions at this workshop on how to better reach these communities and intend to implement them as soon as possible. Since the last time I testified. Congress has allocated the Commission money to spend on our consumer education efforts. We intend to put these resources to good use. Additional funds will allow the Commission to expand upon its current consumer outreach and education plan. Last month, we initiated a procurement seeking support for a broad range of consumer education services, including media services, publications, and distribution networks, that will assist and complement the FCC's ongoing work on 35 educating all American consumers about the digital tele\\'iMon transition. The procurement closed last week and FCC staff is currently reviewing these proposals. CONCLUSION The Commission is devoting significant resources to facilitate a smooth transition. Nearly every Bureau and Office at the Commission has been involved in this effort including our field offices across the country. We intend to take whatever actions are necessaiy to minimize the potential burden the digital transition could impose on consumers and maximize their ability to benefit from it. The next 1 2 months will undoubtedly be challenging. Nevertheless, it is my hope that through the combined efforts of government, industry and advocacy groups American consumers will reap the rewards tlrat the digital transition has to offer. Tices, huu uo-i /y (rei. 37 Mr. Markey. Thank you so much. I remember when I was a kid, Dick Tracey was my favorite comic strip and he hired this guy, Sam Ketchum, to be his assistant and we hope that your hiring of Ketchum will help you as well to solve this problem. So our next witness in her first appearance before the committee, the Honor- able Meredith Baker, Acting Assistant Secretary for Communica- tions and Information from the Department of Commerce. We wel- come you, and whenever you feel comfortable please begin. STATEMENT OF MEREDITH BAKER, ACTING ASSISTANT SEC- RETARY FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION, DE- PARTMENT OF COMMERCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. Ms. Baker. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to be here before you today and to discuss NTIA’s successful launch of the TV converter box coupon program and our strong commitment to continued pub- lic education and outreach efforts so that this historic and impor- tant transition can take place and no American television viewer is unprepared on February 18, 2009. On January 1 consumers across the nation successfully and efficiently began to order cou- pons by phone, mail, fax, and on line. Consumers from every state in the nation applied on the first day. By the end of the first week NTIA had received over 1.1 million requests for 2.1 million cou- pons. While this initial volume was high all systems continued to handle requests. To date, NTIA has accepted more than 2.4 million household re- quests for more than 4.8 million coupons. Approximately 47 percent of these households have identified themselves as reliant on over the air television. On the average, 64.5 percent are applying on the web, 34.9 percent by phone, only 0.5 percent by mail, and .1 per- cent by fax. The overwhelming majority have been able to complete the application process in minutes with ease. We have made some adjustments and improvements as we learn about consumer experi- ences. For example, we have added more Spanish language opera- tors and a Spanish language IBR. Those Spanish and English lan- guages now have a wait time of less than 20 seconds for a live op- erator. Interest in the TV converter box program and demand for coupons indicate that consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the DTV transition and the program. Thanks go to NAB, CTA, CEA, and other members of the DTV coalition. By our estimate our consumer education efforts have at- tracted upwards of 350 million print and broadcast media impres- sions related to the program since September of last year. While we at NTIA have done over 60 interviews since the beginning of this year Secretary Gutierrez himself has done 25, actually over 25, because he did Good Morning America this morning, interviews on the transition in both Spanish and in English since January 1. NTIA’s consumer education campaign focuses on the role of the coupon program during the transition and leverages opportunities for partnership. We, with Ketchum, which is a good choice by the FCC, have developed a comprehensive took kit which is informa- tion to make participation of partners easy such as flyers, enclo- sures, and sample PSAs. 38 NTIA’s consumer education partners currently include over 130 social service and community organizations which serve our vulner- able communities, the low income, the seniors, the rural residents, the minorities, and the disabled Americans. More than 15 Federal agencies have committed to use their existing channels to get the word out about the coupon program. Chairman Martin outlined some of these. Some other examples are the VA. The VA is leveraging their incredible network that touches 24 million vet- erans. The Department of Agriculture will distribute information with their food stamps program and their school lunch program, and HHS will be activating the Administration on Aging. NTIA has been greatly encouraged by the robust participation of manufacturers and retailers in the coupon program. As of yester- day we had certified 37 converter boxes that meet our specifica- tions. These boxes are priced between $40 and $70. We are con- tinuing to review and certify boxes as manufacturers come into this program, and we have offered expedited recertification for the version 2.0 boxes that are submitted with added analog pass through feature. We received notices of intent from more than half a dozen manufacturers with approved converters that claim to produce a converter box with an analog pass through. NTIA will begin mailing coupons to consumers next week. They look like this. NTIA and IBM have been working closely with participating con- sumer electronics to calibrate the release of the coupon with the supply of the converter boxes. The agency has certified more than 615 retailers at this point to participate in the program which rep- resents 16,000 outlets nationwide. To assist these retailers in or- dering their inventory NTIA has made available on the web as well as to the retailers a number of coupons requested by each state within their 3 digit zip code. We have also made employee training materials available and tested the process in a limited 2 market pilot program. When the coupons are mailed next week, we will have 9,000 retailer locations that will be participating in the pro- gram throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is- lands. I would like to thank Wal-Mart, Best Buy, RadioShack, and Cir- cuit City for their leadership and participation. These stores have completed the certification program. Their employees are trained. The converter boxes are in their stores and their systems are ready to redeem coupons. More retailers will be activated and more boxes will be available in the coming weeks. We will carefully monitor and assess the process as it rolls out and will take any further nec- essary actions to insure the consumer experience remains favorable with the coupon program. I received your letter. Chairman Markey, and others of the committee on the issue of the 90-day expiration of coupons, and I will be happy to work with you and your staff to address this issue. NTIA is aware of concerns that have been raised about the impact of the DTV transition of low power and translator stations and on residents of nursing homes, and we are taking steps to address these matters. I would like to than NTIA’s staff for their hard work in getting this program off to such a successful start. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today. I have enjoyed working with your staffs and the DTV caucus, and I look forward to more 39 collaboration as we work together to make this transition success- ful. I will be happy to answer your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Baker follows:] Statement of Meredith A. Baker Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the progress made by the National Tele- communications and Information Administration (NTIA), Department of Commerce, in assisting Americans to prepare for the digital television (DTV) transition. In par- ticular, I am pleased to report to you on NTIA’s successful launch six weeks ago of the Television Converter Box Coupon Program (Coupon Program). Although the Program is off to a good start, this is only the beginning. In this statement, I will share with you the additional steps NTIA is taking to implement the Coupon Pro- gram and the agency’s ongoing efforts to expand public education and outreach on the DTV transition and the Coupon Program. As I indicated, NTIA successfully launched the Coupon Program on January 1, 2008. Across the Nation, consumers have begun ordering their coupons through one of four convenient channels: via a toll-free number (1-888-DTV-2009), online at www.DTV2009.gov, by mail or by fax (1-888-DTV-4ME2). The phone line is avail- able to consumers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with live agents available at all times and an Interactive Voice Response system available for English and Spanish-speaking callers. The phone line can accommodate requests in more than 150 different languages. There is also a special assistance line for the hearing im- paired in English and Spanish. Braille application forms are also available. To date, approximately 65 percent of the requests have been received through our Web site, 34 percent through our telephone channel, and less than 1 percent of the requests by mail and fax. Approximately 89 percent of the household requests are for the maximum number of two coupons. On January 1, NTIA with its partner IBM took requests from over 249,000 appli- cants requesting 475,000 coupons. Consumers from every state in the nation applied on that first day. By the end of the first week, NTIA had received over one million requests for two million coupons. To date, NTIA has accepted more than 2.4 million household requests for more than 4.7 million coupons, representing 20 percent of the program’s base funding. Approximately 47 percent of these households identified themselves as fully reliant on over-the-air television. During this first six weeks, the Coupon Program obtained more than 83 million print and broadcast media impres- sions. NTIA’s daily efforts working with the media has helped generate awareness of the DTV transition and Coupon Program. This initial surge of interest in the Pro- gram and the correspondingly high application rate indicate that consumers are be- coming increasingly aware of the DTV transition and are ready to take action. One of the keys to the success of this program is its voluntary nature, which has fostered strong public-private partnerships. As I have discussed this issue with other federal officials, non-profit leaders, and private sector partners, I have wit- nessed their willingness to work together to make the transition a success. The in- dustries most directly affected by the transition have initiated significant edu- cational efforts with real financial commitments to ensure that no household is caught unprepared on February 18, 2009. The DTV Coalition is also making great strides in educating the American public about their options for making the transi- tion. As a complement to these efforts, NTIA has instituted a proactive consumer edu- cation campaign about the role of the Coupon Program in the DTV transition, leveraging opportunities to partner with consumer groups, community organiza- tions, federal agencies, and industry to inform consumers of their options. To date, NTIA’s consumer education partners include over 130 social service and community organizations with ties to the senior citizens, rural,, minority, and disabled commu- nities as well as a variety of federal agencies with direct communications with other constituent groups. NTIA is reaching out to trusted institutions, such as the NAACP, AARP, and the Native American Journalists Association to reach popu- lations most likely to be affected by the transition. In addition, information about the Coupon Program is being made available in nu- merous foreign languages - - Spanish, French, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Fili- pino, and Tagalog. On December 1, 2007, Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutier- rez was featured in the first of a series of public service programs entitled, \"TV Dig- ital.. .Que Tal?\" aired throughout the United States and Puerto Rico by the Spanish- language Univision Television Network. The program discussed the benefits of dig- ital television broadcasting and provided detailed information about the need for 40 viewers that rely on over-the-air broadcasting to obtain digital-to-analog converter boxes to continue to use their analog television sets, and how to access the Coupon Program to obtain coupons for the purchase of boxes. In addition, NTIA hosted a meeting on January 24, 2008 with more than 15 other federal agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, the Depart- ments of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, the Administration on Aging, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to further coordinate federal efforts to educate the nation about the Feb- ruary 17, 2009 deadline to transition to digital television. During the meeting, NTIA outlined its current and upcoming consumer education efforts and the agencies dis- cussed their strategies and existing communications efforts to raise consumer awareness of the DTV transition and the Coupon Program. In collaboration with IBM and Ketchum, NTIA has developed a comprehensive toolkit of information to provide guidance to its partners that are playing a critical role in educating their members, constituents and customers about the Coupon Pro- gram. Available for use by partners since January 1, 2008 and continuing through early July 2009, the Toolkit attempts to offer simple tips and recommendations to help each organization reach its members with information about the Coupon Pro- gram in a way that will resonate best with them. The Toolkit includes a set of mate- rials, including fact sheets, a poster, a mailer, sample presentations and other mate- rials that can be co-branded for use by partners. The Toolkit also contains specific tools and strategies that can be used to reach the media to effectively deliver the Coupon Program message, and ideas and resources for informing consumers through community and in-store events or other activities. The Toolkit includes four sections, each of which can be used on its own, or in conjunction with other parts of the Toolkit: • Program Background. This section includes background information on the DTV transition and the TV Converter Box Coupon Program. Partners are strongly en- couraged to familiarize themselves with the Coupon Program and with what con- sumers told us they want to know. • Development and Dissemination of Messages and Materials. This section in- cludes a series of tailored messages about the Coupon Program that partners can incorporate into their own materials to explain how to apply for and redeem cou- pons. The messages have been tested in consumer focus groups to ensure that they are easily understood and have been reviewed by NTIA for accuracy and consist- ency. This section also outlines the ready-made materials available for downloading, co-branding"
