        "text": "\"My Network TV\" Landing in Youngstown\n\nUPDATE: The Business Journal reports the WYTV news conference has been cancelled, and will be rescheduled...\n\nThe \"new network situation\" is becoming clearer in the Youngstown market, where UPN/WB replacement The CW is already set. It looks like My Network TV will find a Mahoning Valley home as well.\n\nThe Youngstown-Warren Business Journal reports that Chelsey Broadcasting ABC affiliate WYTV/33 will announce a \"second local channel\" at a ribbon-cutting event tomorrow. (Thanks to an alert OMW tipster for passing this on!)\n\nThough WYTV's news release does not officially detail the second outlet's programming, the Business Journal says it's expected to become the Youngstown market's affiliate for My Network TV, the FOX-owned mini-network developed after FOX's UPN O&O's got stiffed in the move to The CW. CW will air in Youngstown on current WB affiliate \"WBCB\", a digital/cable/satellite channel run by NBC affiliate WFMJ/21.\n\nThe Wednesday event is a launch for the construction of new downtown Youngstown studios for WYTV, which is going to move to a new facility to be built on East Federal Street. Historically, only WFMJ (owned by the Youngstown Vindicator) has broadcast from downtown Youngstown, with both WYTV and Piedmont CBS affiliate WKBN/27 - and now FOX affiliate WYFX/62 - staked out far from downtown. WYTV's longtime home is on Shady Run Road, south of downtown off I-680 and Midlothian Blvd.\n\nWYTV is also expanding its early evening local news block, which will run a full 90 minutes from 5 PM to 6:30 PM starting on June 12th.\n\nThe move to add a second channel and My Network TV accomplishes two things - it means all three outlets of the original \"Big Three\" networks will have secondary channels with other networks...with WFMJ/21 hosting WB affiliate \"WBCB\" on its digital channel, and on cable and satellite, and WKBN/27 running \"FOX 17/62\" on a pair of LPTVers, on cable and soon-to-be satellite, and now on its own digital subchannel. It also means Youngstown will now get all the over-air networks locally.\n\nThe Business Journal article does not say how WYTV intends to deliver the second channel, but we'll assume it'll mirror WBCB (and now WYFX) with a digital subchannel and at least cable carriage.\n\nEven if WYTV had not picked up My Network TV for a second channel, most Youngstown market cable viewers would have had no problem watching it anyway. Youngstown never had a UPN affiliate, even as a digital subchannel...and Cleveland's future My Network TV affiliate - WUAB/43 - has long filled that role on cable in the market.\n\nWhat we'll have to see is if WYTV forces its hand with local cable outlets in the Youngstown market, and uses its new My Network TV channel to take over WUAB's channel slot...\n\nTwo (Hot) Weekend Items\n\nThat's hot, as in the temperature...as it's currently 82 degrees at the OMW World Headquarters in northwest Akron. The items are actually rather mild...\n\nHOT WEEKEND ITEM 1: Air America syndicated midday host Jerry Springer returned to the Northeast Ohio airwaves early this evening - apparently by accident. While running some errands around town, we heard the former WTAM/1100 Cleveland mid-morning time slot occupant on Akron liberal talker WARF/1350 \"Radio Free Ohio\".\n\nWe say \"by accident\" because \"Springer on the Radio\" has never been scheduled - or as far as we know, even heard - on WARF, even in weekend replays.\n\nThe station's weekend schedule currently lists repeats of WYD/Jones weekday host Stephanie Miller in the 5-8 PM Sunday time slot. It also appears that schedule is flexible, because \"Radio Free Ohio\" started airing an infomercial after the ABC newscast at 7 PM - and after about 7 minutes of dead air preceding ABC.\n\nSpringer's program repeats for an hour on the Air America national schedule in the Sunday 6-7 PM ET time slot where he was heard on WARF tonight...so the 1350 automation computer apparently got confused and dumped into the live Air America satellite feed, complete with non-matching spot breaks and different cue tones.\n\nThe airing tonight is still a far cry from Springer's former weekday morning time slot on WTAM, which he lost earlier this year to local talker Bob Frantz...\n\nHOT WEEKEND ITEM 2: A discussion with some online friends earlier in the week got us in the mood to make the drive over to Warren...to devour three chili-cheese hot dogs at the city's iconic Hot Dog Shoppe. (Your Primary Editorial Voice was a regular visitor to that establishment in the early 1990's.)\n\nWhile we were in the Mahoning Valley, we did a cursory check of some stations with a questionable status. So far, the bankruptcy-induced ownership/management changes at the Stop 26 Riverbend stations have not made it to the air.\n\nWRBP/101.9 Hubbard was running what sounded to us like ABC's \"The Touch\" urban AC 24/7 format...we don't know if that's any different than what they've done in the past on weekends, but the station is still calling itself \"102 Jams\".\n\nThe Stop 26 AM stations were running their usual formats - WGFT/1330 Campbell with gospel, and WASN/1500 Youngstown with Spanish-language music. We did not hear an English legal ID on the latter, but did hear a liner out of nowhere in English, saying 1500 was \"the station playing your kind of music\".\n\nThe stations must not be looking at impending loss of transmitter site lease, which prompted the bankruptcy receiver's appointed management to shutter Stop 26's WVKO/1580 Columbus a while back. The manager is operating the stations as ownership transitions from the bankrupt Stop 26 to Bernard Radio, the radio operating company of investment firm D.B. Zwirn - the largest creditor on Stop 26's list...\n\nCincinnati Radio/TV Station Combo Reunites - In A Way\n\nLong before Hearst Argyle owned Cincinnati NBC affiliate WLWT/5, and before Clear Channel ended up with talk WLW/700, both stations were co-owned in the Crosley era.\n\nThe ownership situation is not changing, but the stations are now teaming up for a news and weather sharing partnership...which isn't really even the most interesting part of this story.\n\nAs Cincinnati Post radio/TV columnist Rick Bird notes, the new WLW/WLWT partnership - which puts the TV station's weather forecasters on WLW - means WLW is dumping CBS affiliate WKRC/12 in that role.\n\nYou know...the only TV station in the market owned by WLW owner Clear Channel.\n\nWe're scratching our head here...trying to remember when a corporate behemoth allowed such a move. In fact, we've even heard WLW midday mainstay Mike McConnell grumble on the air that corporate policy - presumably out of San Antonio - restricted him to mentioning only Channel 12 when it came to even talking about local TV news!\n\nNot anymore...the hook is now with WLWT/5...as the agreement, according to Bird, covers not only weather...but news sharing, \"personalities and marketing\". We're wondering if McConnell will get now clipped for talking about Channel 12...\n\nWKRC/12 will still, according to Cincinnati Enquirer radio/TV columnist John Kiesewetter, provide weather forecasts for all the other Clear Channel radio outlets in the market. The deal only covers WLW.\n\nFor \"The Big One\"'s part, program director Darryl Parks correctly notes that the company's local clusters do have autonomy to make such decisions. And we've seen first-hand evidence of such in other Clear Channel markets. But you have to wonder...would many other Clear Channel news/talk stations be able to dump local TV sharing agreements with company-owned stations?\n\nIn CC's home market, San Antonio, the company recently changed the name of its TV station to WOAI-TV...to match WOAI/1200, the \"flagship\" CC news/talker which started the entire chain back in the day, and even gave Clear Channel its name.\n\nUp in our friend Scott Fybush's home market of Rochester NY, the company did the same with its TV outlet (then WOKR), changing the name to WHAM-TV to match news/talk WHAM/1180. And a similar move was made just down the New York State Thruway in Syracuse, where Clear Channel's former WIXT-TV was rechristened WSYR-TV, to match news/talk WSYR/570.\n\nIn all three markets, the moves coincided with heavy cross-promotion.\n\nSo we say - \"only in Cincinnati\". That Mr. Parks and company were able to do this is not a huge surprise. The Cincinnati Clear Channel cluster has always enjoyed such autonomy, dating back to the days when Randy Michaels was running the CC national radio office out of nearby Covington.\n\nAnd WLW itself has almost always been handled with a \"hands off\" policy out of San Antonio. Parks, as the Cincinnati cluster's AM operations manager, has been able to exert a strong hand, even when the station has been embroiled in controversy. In effect, he's been able to handle things locally.\n\nThe fact that this policy continues, long after Randy Michaels left Clear Channel, is attributed to one thing and one thing only in our minds - money.\n\nWe've noted here before that WLW is the ratings and revenue monster in the Cincinnati market. It is by far the most profitable radio station in Cincinnati, lapping even sister FM rocker WEBN/102.7 by some margin. Basically, when you're the cash cow and one of the most profitable radio stations in the entire chain, Clear Channel doesn't mess with you out of San Antonio...let alone upper management in Cincinnati.\n\nClear Channel is not without its \"corporate mandates\", certainly. They do exist, and have been well documented in other situations. But if a local cluster or station shows a long track record of success, they CAN talk the company out of such mandates if it makes sense locally...as this proves...\n\nRandy Part Deux\n\nSo, it's good to know we're not alone in our speculation.\n\nWhen OMW first published the list of markets where CBS Radio is aiming to exit, Cincinnati stuck out like that proverbial sore thumb to us. Oh, Columbus as well, but especially Cincinnati.\n\nWe had a thought: Wouldn't THAT be an interesting return to major market radio for one Randy Michaels?\n\nMr. Michaels, of course, is the long-time former head of Clear Channel's radio division, going back to the \"make some noise\" days at Jacor. He's usually credited with building Clear Channel's current Cincinnati cluster into a monster, and in particular the \"monster\" known as the original \"Big One\", talk WLW/700. Though started by someone else, and funded by a wealthy investor (one Sam Zell), Jacor as a whole was largely Randy's creation.\n\nThough a native of the Buffalo area, he ran Clear Channel's radio division out of suburban Cincinnati (Covington KY), and the Queen City is considered his hometown.\n\nAfter leaving Clear Channel, Michaels has slowly been building suburban Cincinnati-based RadioActive LLC, by bidding on various FM auction licenses in cities much smaller than Cincinnati. Is RadioActive about to get a lot more \"Active\" in the major markets, by buying one or more clusters from CBS? Maybe as many as all 10 markets CBS is putting up for sale?\n\nRandy getting \"back in the game\" is being hinted by at least a couple of trade publications. We don't have any \"inside\" information to back up that speculation, but if Randy's looking to get back into it, this would be a decent opportunity.\n\nHe's also been getting into the programming game, with his \"Product 1st (P1)\" owning the rights to Jones Radio-syndicated liberal talker Ed Schultz. And he'd been rumored to be involved in a possible takeover of the LMA of New York City liberal talker WLIB/1190, Air America's flagship station.\n\nRandy's diverse, though...and buying the Cincinnati CBS cluster, in specific, would more likely provide him with the opportunity to use the company's big FM stations to compete head on with similar Clear Channel stations. Mr. Michaels was a significant player at now-CBS Radio's WKRQ \"Q102\", before he scooted across to Jacor, with the company's former Cincinnati cluster now owned by Clear Channel. Needless to say, he knows both groups pretty well...first hand.\n\nRandy Michaels often gets a bad rap in this business, particularly for his implementation of Clear Channel directives like widespread voicetracking while he ran the radio division there.\n\nBut from what we know and have heard of him, he's actually a firm believer in the content and programming side of radio. With his own money, and without San Antonio handing down its philosophy, this might be a whole new ballgame...\n\nOur 58 Update\n\nThat's 58, as in what you get when you add \"3\" to \"55\" for this update:\n\nWKYC HD: We've noticed, in watching Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC/3's new HDTV newscasts, that not everything is \"there\" yet for the debut week. This morning, meteorologist Hollie Strano apologized for not having her usual morning quiz graphics, saying \"not everything's been converted yet\" to HD. While she said that, we couldn't help but notice a flat screen monitor just above her head...which appeared to still be wrapped in plastic. The things you notice...\n\nWe also noticed that so far, none of the station's stories originating from the Akron/Canton Bureau have either widescreen or HD video. We'll assume the WKYC outpost at Main and Market has yet to be retrofitted with such equipment. The twice-nightly newscast produced there for Time Warner Cable is obviously not in HD, unless there are plans afoot that we don't know about.\n\nWe'll assume, though, in the general scheme of things, that WKYC will also add HD equipment in Akron...and even if the live HD transmission paths are probably still a ways off, they could still send live video to Cleveland in 16x9 SD...\n\nWBNX SCHEDULE CHANGES: It's been tipped by contributors to our item below about WB affiliate-to-become-CW affiliate WBNX/55, but we've now found the confirmation.\n\nAccording to this graphic found on the WBNX website, the station plans to air syndicated reruns of the hit show \"Friends\" in the weeknight 10 PM slot starting on June 11th. (We've edited the graphic down for space, to the top and bottom parts.)\n\nThat time slot is very significant...currently, it's occupied by \"The Ninety and Nine Club\", a religious talk show hosted by none other than WBNX owner Rev. Ernest Angley. We don't have any word on where Rev. Angley's show will move in the schedule.\n\nUPDATE: We're told that Angley told viewers of his show that it would still air in its morning time slot - 9 AM - when we're told he sometimes does the show live. WBNX also apparently plans, if what we're being told is correct, to add an additional subchannel to the upcoming WBNX-DT, alongside digital/HD programming for the main channel. No matter what WBNX does as far as programming this subchannel, it'd probably provide an opportunity for Angley to get an evening time slot for his show on the new second outlet.\n\nHe's moved \"Ninety and Nine Club\" on his own station once before. The show's name refers to its old time slot of 9 PM weeknights, a placement Angley abandoned when he agreed to affiliate WBNX with the then-new WB network...\n\nThe Week's Starting Menu\n\nONE FROM COLUMN A: A followup to our item about Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC/3 and its impending change to HDTV local news.\n\nThe station is now doing its newscasts from a temporary newsroom-based set, which looks to us like it's roughly \"just behind\" where the station's regular set would be. Here's a screen shot from Sunday night's \"Channel 3 News at 11\":\n\nIf we remember the placement of the regular WKYC set, it'd be to the left of where Lydia Esparra, Scott Newell and Betsy Kling are sitting, and further back from the newsroom back wall. We don't know if this means they just had to install HDTV cameras, or if they're working on a brand new set.\n\nUPDATE: We hear the change could come as soon as tonight's 6 PM edition of \"Channel 3 News\"...\n\nONE FROM COLUMN B: An item from our long-time friend Scott Fybush and this week's edition of NorthEast Radio Watch. Scott tells us that Cumulus Youngstown market rocker WWIZ/103.9 \"Rock 104\" is abandoning a move to change its community of license from Mercer PA to Hermitage PA, closer to the heart of the Youngstown market.\n\nWhy? Scott believes that it may have to do with something called \"Rule 4\" in FCC parlance. That basically means that Cumulus/Youngstown is already grandfathered to be allowed to own eight stations in the Youngstown market, and moving WWIZ would result in that arrangement having to be abandoned.\n\nIn addition to WWIZ, Cumulus owns top 40 WHOT/101.1, classic rock WYFM/102.9, AC WLLF/96.7, sports WBBW/1240, and news/talk WPIC/790 - all attributed on the company's website to its Youngstown \"Radio Center\" on Simon Road. (We're pretty sure WPIC, as a Mercer County-targeted station, still broadcasts from studios on Pine Hollow Road in Sharon.)\n\nThen, of course, there's country monster WQXK/105.1 and sister standards WSOM/600 listed in its \"Canton Salem\" office along with rock WRQK/106.9 in the Canton market. But, everyone on the list except for WRQK has main studios at the Youngstown complex. \"K-105\" holds down a sales desk or two in Canton.\n\nAll but WRQK can be tabbed to Cumulus/Youngstown, which makes the list more than would be allowed without the grandfathering clause.\n\nAn oddity when you go into the Youngstown market page for Cumulus (go here, then select Youngstown) - they also list \"WBJT-FM 101.9\". Are we missing something, or did Cumulus ever have even LMA control of the station now coming out of that Stop 26 Riverbend bankruptcy proceeding? The current calls - WRBP - date back to Stop 26's initial purchase of the station. And the above listed calls would presumably be a typo for the WBTJ calls 101.9 sported in its \"Beat\" Rhythmic Top 40 days...a format which eventually landed at Clear Channel's \"Kiss FM\" (WAKZ/95.9 Sharpsville PA).\n\nONE FROM COLUMN C: A brief visit with Cleveland Plain Dealer columnist Roger Brown's Monday sports media column.\n\nHe enlists anonymous local media executives to speculate on former WKNR host Bruce Drennan's chances of returning to the airwaves, after he'll spend five months in prison for a tax evasion charge stemming from his illegal gambling. With answers from \"I won't bet on it\" to \"interesting thought, but he does carry baggage\", Brown gets a mixed reception.\n\nBut one media executive is already on board. In fact, according to Brown's column, that area news director will have Drennan write a weekly website column from prison! It should be no surprise to any local media observer which outlet would do so...yep, you guessed it, WOIO/19-WUAB/43's \"19 Action News\".\n\nThe station has a history with \"rehabilitative hires\"...remember the trouble Chuck Galeti got into before he was brought aboard first to do fill-in reporting, then as main sports anchor? In that case, it worked out very well, as near as we can tell. And Drennan would certainly be a good fit at \"Action News\", style-wise, if he eventually landed on the air after the prison term.\n\nWe have never been big fans, or even small fans, of Mr. \"I LOVVVVVVE YA, CLEVELAND!\". Our last straw wasn't the gambling thing, but Drennan singing show tunes on his old WKNR morning drive show. We always thought he was more schtick than substance.\n\nBut we have no problem with a \"second chance\" for him. Not at all. We heard him talk after his tax evasion case plea, via soundbites on one of his former employers, Cleveland Clear Channel talker WTAM/1100. And he said all the right things...he accepted guilt for what he did, and he didn't try to sugarcoat it.\n\nWe do NOT expect him to return to the airwaves of Salem's WKNR/850, for any number of reasons...both philosophical and programming wise, as they've basically moved on. But we wouldn't be surprised for him to show up elsewhere, even in addition to \"19 Action News\".\n\nAnd in a \"sign of the media times\" item, Brown notes that WKNR sportscaster Neil Bender is not paid extra for his work on the FSN Ohio/WKNR simulcast \"Cleveland Rants\" Indians post-game show.\n\nWell, that's not a surprise to us...we're also assuming that FSN Ohio's Les Levine isn't getting paid by WKNR for appearing on their airwaves as well... it's the \"you pay your guy, we'll pay ours\" dynamic that probably makes \"Rants\" even possible, considering the two employers involved. In the meantime, though Bender isn't getting any TV coin, he is getting the ability to compile TV demo tapes...\n\n\"19 Action News\" Hits New Low\n\nRegular readers know that here at your Mighty Blog of Fun(tm), we aren't usually at a loss for words when the subject is \"19 Action News\", the dual-headed monstrosity that occupies airtime at Raycom's local CBS affiliate, WOIO/19, and sister UPN-to-become-MyNetworkTV affiliate, WUAB/43.\n\nWe've hit that inability to say much more with this story, which we found in Saturday's \"Tipoff\" column by the Cleveland Plain Dealer's Michael K. McIntyre.\n\nWe find it hard to improve on the original, so we'll put up a few choice quotes about how WOIO handled a story of an \"after hours strip joint\" which led to the arrest of a local coffee shop owner...\n\nReporter Matt Stevens referred to \"a woman who just arrived with a date\" paying $20 each to get in and then engaging with a nude dancer in \"an hourlong relationship that could easily be used as a definition of obscenity.\" The man and woman, their anonymity protected, were then interviewed about what \"our undercover camera\" caught.\n\n--------\n\nWhat the reporter failed to tell viewers was that the woman, who works at a local legitimate strip joint, and a man were recruited and paid several hundred dollars by the station to get lewd undercover video. And they didn't sit there passively in the one-hour obscenity session.\n\nWow.\n\nFor his defense, 19 Action News news director Dan Salamone tells McIntyre that he needed to hire the ringers because he was having trouble getting usable video with his regular news production staffers. Oh, boy. The cost of getting video of a situation Salamone says he really wanted to \"expose\" (ahem)?\n\n\"$300, including cocktails\", says Salamone to the PD. Nice work if you can get it, no?\n\nIt reminds of us of the Los Angeles market, where video cameras roll every day taping this kind of stuff. Only the footage is not paid for by TV news operations - as far as we know. It gets transfered to tape and DVD and gets sold behind the curtain at the local low-rent video store, and is sold all over the Internet.\n\nSay, Mr. Salamone! If you have trouble getting naughty stuff on video in the future, for a story on naked people...remember, in your own Reserve Square newsroom, you have an attractive female anchor who's willingly shed her clothes for your own cameras before. In public, even! For a news story! The money you put aside in this story for paying \"interviewees\" could have just been added to her bonus check.\n\nOf note - McIntyre says the \"pay for sex sources\" story has hit a sour note even with some WITHIN that very newsroom.\n\nWhen Mr. Salamone was hired as news director at WOIO/WUAB, he had been a manager at a Portland OR station with a far less, umm, unseemly reputation. We wondered how he'd fit in at Cleveland's 19 Tabloid News. We guess it didn't take long for him to do so.\n\nOK, so we DID have a little more to say...\n\nA Three Tier HDTV Update\n\nOur apologies for being gone for a day or two here at OMW. Not only are we busy enjoying weekend activities with some out-of-town friends who are in Northeast Ohio through tomorrow, but the palatial OMW World Headquarters was without power for the better part of Friday night into Saturday morning! And only the OMW World Headquarters, and about 34 other unlucky neighboring souls. All's back to normal, now.\n\nUPDATE LEVEL 1: A clarification to our earlier item, suggesting that Cleveland market WB-to-become-CW affiliate WBNX/55 may not have its digital signal over the air until Spring 2007. Don't blame us...blame whoever answers the WBNX feedback E-Mail for this directly quoted answer, received by our OMW tipster as a reply to a message asking them about their digital situation in the wake of the approval of the WBNX-DT construction permit:\n\nThank you for your feedback. An antenna has to still be designed and built at our transmitter site. Spring of 2007 is a likely date. Thank you for watching wbnx-tv!\n\nThe information did NOT come from WUAB/43 or another competitor, and we thought we made that clear in the initial item. It came directly from the keyboard of whoever answers the \"vwrfdbk\" E-Mail address at \"wbnx.com\"...it's the link you see on their web page under \"Viewer Feedback\". We did not pull this out of the air, folks. We did not make this up. It was not planted by a competing station.\n\nIf indeed WBNX is actively constructing its over-air digital facility and aiming to get The CW on the air in HDTV by this fall (or for that matter, whatever The WB runs in the summer in HDTV), someone better tell whoever answers their E-Mail to provide the correct answers to viewers. We understand WBNX is advertising their upcoming digital capability on air, but we have yet to see that in occasional watching of the station the past few days...and their \"trends\" web page has yet to be updated.\n\nQuite frankly, the E-Mail we've been forwarded above didn't make a lot of sense to us, but it was (presumably) from a station employee charged with answering viewer E-Mail. (It would not be the first time that such an event has occurred, depending on what kind of attention a station pays to its incoming viewer E-Mail.)\n\nWe will attempt to get a straight answer from WBNX, and will post it here when we do receive that answer.\n\nUPDATE LEVEL 2: WNEO/WEAO \"PBS 45 & 49\" programming and operations director Don Freeman weighs in on the digital TV situation at the Kent-based PBS affiliate. Freeman tells a home theater/HDTV hobbyist website about the station's travails with aging digital encoding equipment and automation interfacing, which have prompted some unwanted changes on the WNEO-DT/WEAO-DT signals:\n\nOur first generation digital encoding equipment is showing its age. The unit has limitations and those, combined with our incompatible automation system interface, limit what the station can deliver. That's why the Information & Education Channel (CPB/Annenberg) has temporarily been discontinued. That is also why, after 6 months of effort, we are TEMPORARILY de-listing our HD service. That is also why we've made considerable changes to our 2am-5 am primary channel service.\n\nWe have been expecting funds from a federal grant to upgrade our automation system since September. We are now spending considerable time reviewing replacement mux and encoding equipment. But we are not abandoning HD as one of the significant broadcast streams in our future.\n\nWhen we get all the pieces-parts together HD will be on the air again. I, for one, can hardly wait.\n\nDon Freeman\n\nDirector of Programming and Operations\n\nUPDATE LEVEL 3: Over in the Youngstown market, CBS affiliate WKBN/27's digital/HDTV signal is now available via Armstrong Cable channel 104. And sister WYFX-LP/62-WFXI-CA/17, better known as \"FOX 17/62\", is also available in digital format AND with FOX HD programming on Armstrong Cable channel 105.\n\nSince FOX 17/62 can't literally do any better digitally over-the-air than an SD subchannel of WKBN-DT 41, the FOX HDTV feed is being sent via fiber optic from WKBN to Armstrong (as is the CBS HDTV feed).\n\nThere's no word on if Time Warner Cable, the other major Youngstown/Warren market operator, will add these feeds...\n\nThursday Fun Stack\n\nJust a few odds and ends from various parts of the state and beyond:\n\nSTACK ITEM #1: You normally don't look to TV \"up front\" presentations for radio news, but that's what happened Wednesday. CBS head honcho Les Moonves tipped at the network's presentation to advertisers that the company's looking to sell off 35 \"small market\" radio stations.\n\nIt's not the first time the company's said that. It's not even the second time. And we don't have any indication, at least in the above-linked article from TheStreet.com, of what markets CBS plans to exit.\n\nWe're assuming that Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati aren't on the list, for now. But a friend of ours who works for the company in the North Carolina \"Triad\" area (Greensboro et al.) may be working for new bosses if CBS ever gets around to selling stations in smaller markets...\n\nSTACK ITEM #2: AllAccess reports that Cox country powerhouse WHKO/99.1 \"K99.1\" Dayton morning man Jim Day is headed for a plum gig...mornings at Cumulus country WSM-FM/Nashville \"99.5 The Wolf\". (Jim's pictured here with \"K99.1\" morning partner Nancy Wilson.)\n\nIt's hard to think of many better gigs for a country morning guy than working in Music City, though the competition is quite intense in country radio there. Among other things, Day and partner Amy Nash will be up against country radio legend Gerry House and his \"House Foundation\" (on Clear Channel country WSIX/97.9 \"The Big 98\").\n\nSTACK ITEM #3: It doesn't have anything to do directly with Ohio radio, but it reminds us of something that happened here about a year ago.\n\nStill reeling from reaction to a morning show parody called \"Wetback Steakhouse\", Cox rocker WBAB in Long Island is now dealing with more fallout from something it says it did NOT do - broadcast a racially-charged country song with numerous not-so-nice references to African-Americans, both offensive and violent.\n\nLong Island Newsday reports that the station says someone apparently hijacked the WBAB signal, by interjecting their signal between the station's studio and transmitter site - disrupting the existing STL. WBAB programmer John Olsen says he's \"not happy about it\" and wants to find out who did it...saying the same song was interjected over sister CHR WBLI's signal a couple of years ago.\n\nIt reminded us of the stunting that Clear Channel's Akron/Canton cluster did shortly before the flip of then-sports \"Fox Sports 1350\" into today's liberal talk WARF \"Radio Free Ohio\". The local stunting involved a supposed pirate taking over the signal to \"bring the truth to the people\"...when of course, it was actually the station itself simulating such interruptions.\n\nWe're not engineers here at your MBoF(tm), so we don't know how likely it is for someone to overpower the Long Island station's STL feed and broadcast intensely racist hate songs. But we tend to think the station itself couldn't possibly do that. Well, unless they're the dumbest radio station in America - broadcasting such garbage just days after apologizing for a skit they DID produce.\n\nThey say \"no publicity is bad publicity\", but this would pretty much be it. The \"Wetback Steakhouse\" bit they can earnestly \"apologize for\", and not lose a lot of face. But this isn't the kind of \"stunting\" a legitimate radio station does...or anything anyone wants to be associated with. Just our thoughts...\n\nThe OMW FM Talk Watch - Detroit?\n\nIn our continuing series highlighting moves to put talk, news/talk and sports formats on FM across the country...is Detroit next?\n\nAllAccess reports that Clear Channel Detroit classic rock/hits station WDTW/106.7 \"The Drive\" has pulled the plug on its eclectic format, and is stunting with \"everything from Garth Brooks to Barry Manilow\".\n\nDetroit TV news legend Bill Bonds is reported to be voicing the stunting, directing listeners to make requests at \"www.1067needshelp.com\", and is inviting them to \"build your own radio station\".\n\nOne of the rumored permanent format candidates for the Detroit FM signal, according to AllAccess, is news/talk.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense. Detroit is used to talk on FM, with CBS Radio's long-running, successful hot talker WKRK/97.1. Meanwhile, Clear Channel has never mounted a serious news/talk challenge to ABC's WJR/760. The company's largest AM station is popular sports WDFN/1130 \"The Fan\", which is not changing format. The company started a second-tier talk station on 1310 AM, but that signal is not nearly good enough to go up against WJR with. (It's now liberal talk WDTW[AM], which oddly enough sports the same calls as the stunting 106.7.)\n\nIt reminds us a lot of Pittsburgh, where Clear Channel's AM signal (sports WBGG/970) is not good enough to go up against full-market blowtorch CBS Radio news/talk KDKA/1020...so the company launched \"FM News/Talk 104.7\" on now-WPGB/104.7, and was more successful than anyone had anticipated. And the use of a market TV news legend to voice the stunting would seem to point to a news/talk format in the future, no?\n\nWe keep bringing this trend up - news/talk radio on FM - because of by now almost comical ongoing rumors that either Clear Channel or Infinity would do the same in Cleveland. But unlike Detroit, Clear Channel's AM in Cleveland IS the market blowtorch, WTAM/1100.\n\nIf the company ever does mount an FM spoken word format here, it could well be a WTAM simulcast. (Just a guess on our part, don't go to press with it!) But we'd expect that to happen only if there is competitive concern, much like Entercom did in New Orleans with news/talk giant WWL/870's new FM simulcast...moving to dull the impact of a rumored/now-announced new Clear Channel FM talker there...\n\nMidday Items\n\nITEM 1: That was indeed Ron \"The Ghoul\" Sweed we heard plucking Froggy's magic twanger this morning on CBS Radio Cleveland classic rocker WNCX/98.5, as the station continues its search for a new morning show.\n\nThe Plain Dealer's Julie Washington updates that search, noting the laundry list of mostly veteran local radio personalities filling in the time slot once occupied by Howard Stern, and most recently, the David Lee Flop show. Er...Roth, sorry.\n\nWhen CBS Radio Cleveland decided not to pit young-skewing shock talkers Opie & Anthony against the company's homegrown \"Rover's Morning Glory\", that opened up the floodgates. But not everyone's hoping to take the full-time gig...some are just doing it for fun, much like the week of \"Five Cleveland Mornings\", where the 6-10 AM slot became a reunion for almost anyone who's opened up a microphone on WNCX, WMMS/100.7 and other stations like the old \"M105\" (the former rocker WWWM, now Clear Channel oldies WMJI/105.7).\n\nLike \"Five Cleveland Mornings\", the WNCX fill-in rotation has a definite \"old WMMS\" feel to it. Notable is an appearance by \"Jeff and Flash\", the long-time WMMS morning team of Jeff Kinzbach and Ed \"Flash\" Ferenc. Former WMMS voices \"Slats\" - who later hopped over to WNCX CBS sister alt-rock WXRK/92.3 - and David Spero have also been aboard.\n\nThough WNCX is reportedly also listening to out of town applicants, CBS Radio Cleveland VP Christopher Maduri's job description for the new host/hosts would almost seem to ensure they'll have WMMS experience. He tells Washington that WNCX \"is looking for a host or morning crew that can create a show that relates to Cleveland, pulls in listeners 40 and up and fits in with the station's classic rock feel\".\n\nWith \"The Buzzard\" rock radio's golden child in Cleveland, especially for those in that 40-plus demo, we'd be shocked if a WMMS veteran or veterans were not in the WNCX morning chair. (And though we don't know if they're seriously trying for it, it'd be hard to beat the name recognition \"Jeff and Flash\" would have, especially in that demographic.)\n\nITEM 2: Second in our Julie Washington trifecta, as she notes the departure of Carole Sullivan, Gannett NBC affiliate WKYC/3's morning news co-anchor. Sullivan, known as Carole Chandler before marrying former Browns assistant coach Mike Sullivan, is following her husband to Kalamazoo MI...where he's an offensive line coach for Western Michigan University. She broke the news on Channel 3's morning show on Monday...\n\nITEM 3: And Washington finally catches up with our item about the hiring of new news director Mike McCormick at WKYC. The Jacksonville FL TV veteran (\"First Coast News\"/WTLV/WJXX) starts at Channel 3 in June. Exiting VP/news Dick Moore, headed for a role as associate professor at the University of South Carolina's school of journalism, heads south in July.\n\nFor the record, OMW gave readers a heads up on this item nearly one month ago...\n\nWOAC/67 Needs New Programming\n\nShop at Home Network owner E.W. Scripps has announced it is shutting down the TV home shopping network, which airs locally on WOAC/67 Canton. In a company release, Scripps says it's shutting down the Shop at Home TV side, and the network's associated Internet site, on June 22nd.\n\nThe company has been doing some shopping of its own - shopping around the SAH stations to other buyers. Scripps says that effort continues, and they'll seek alternative programming for the stations while they seek a new owner or owners. The Scripps release says the company's lost $84 million on the effort since first buying into SAH in 2002.\n\nThere's no word, even in this report by Reuters, what kind of programming would be sought for the on-the-block SAH stations.\n\nIn Northeast Ohio, WOAC is actually technically a sister station of long-time Scripps ABC affiliate WEWS/5 Cleveland, though we don't believe there's been any connection between the two local stations other than common ownership. And with Scripps still looking to sell off the stations, presumably as a block, there may not be even the outside chance the company will do anything with WOAC and WEWS here...even temporarily.\n\nChannel 67 began life as an attempt to bring Canton a new independent, secular TV station, after WJAN/17 turned into religious WDLI, and eventually landed in the hands of the Trinity Broadcasting Network.\n\nThe station actually mounted a small local programming effort, with local news updates by Scott Davis and public service talk shows with Sherry Lee (our swiss cheese memory isn't all that clear if that's her correct name). It was also the first station to air local \"Ghoul\"/\"Ghoulardi\" knockoff \"Son of Ghoul\", who now airs on \"The Cat\" low-power combo (WAOH-LP 29/Akron - W35AX/Cleveland).\n\nAnd the land of low-power TV is where Canton-serving local TV ended up.\n\nAfter being bought by Paxson Communications (WVPX/23 owners), WOAC/67 upgraded to the maximum 5,000,000 watts of UHF power to serve the entire Cleveland TV market...and was then sold to Shop at Home. Image Video's WIVM-LP/52 Canton then became the latest entrant in the Canton Local TV Sweepstakes, and still operates today with sister LPTVer WIVN-LP/29 Newcomerstown aiming at nearby New Philadelphia and Coshocton...\n\nMy Network TV Slowly Expands in Ohio\n\nWith The WB and UPN going away in September, new merged network The CW - and new competitor My Network TV - are slowly building their nationwide affiliate lists.\n\nBut unlike The CW, the network owned by UPN parent CBS and WB parent Time Warner, FOX's My Network TV is ramping up rather slowly in Ohio. There's now officially a CW affiliate in every Ohio market short of Zanesville, a puny mini-market which will likely see its WB100 cable channel flip to CW+ without much fanfare.\n\nMy Network TV has only managed to sign up affiliates in Cleveland (WUAB/43 UPN) and Cincinnati (WSTR/64 WB), until today. The MNTV folks have announced a clearance in Lima, where Greg Phipps' WOHL-CA 25 \"FOX 25\" is now listed as the network's new affiliate.\n\nWe'll assume that's a mistake, and that the MNTV affiliation is instead headed for Phipps' WLQP-LP 18 \"UPN 18\"...which would seem much more likely to us than a delayed clearance on FOX 25. MNTV probably listed WOHL's call letters due to parent FOX's main network airing there. (The CW will air in Lima on a newly-minted subchannel of NBC affiliate WLIO/35.)\n\nMy Network TV still has to announce affiliates in Columbus, Dayton and Toledo.\n\nIt'll likely be stuck with a delayed clearance or a new DT subchannel in Columbus, with LIN TV's WWHO/53 \"UPN 53\" landing as a CW primary affiliate recently.\n\nWWHO has carried WB programming out of pattern, so it'd only make sense that they could do the same with MNTV if the network has no other choice in the market. And LIN TV has an existing relationship with the My folks...affiliating some of its stations with MNTV before going with the CW in markets like Columbus.\n\nDayton may be a little easier, as we're surprised My Network TV hasn't inked a deal with WHIO-TV's sister station, cable/digital-only \"UPN 17\". (CW goes to WB's WBDT/26.)\n\nToledo is a little more interesting. With the current cable/digital/satellite-only WB affiliate (\"WT05 - Toledo's WB\") going to CW, the My folks may be without a broadcast option with the questionable status of UPN affiliate WNGT-LP 48 - in bankruptcy receivership and likely to be picked up by the Cornerstone Church.\n\nAnd we wouldn't be surprised at all if there is no new My Network TV option in Youngstown. The market never had a UPN affiliate, with Cleveland powerhouse WUAB/43 filling that role with extensive cable coverage...and WUAB will likely act as Youngstown's imported My Network TV affiliate as well.\n\nMy Network TV doesn't have a generic cable feed like WB/CW, so it'd be status quo unless perhaps WKBN/27's sister FOX affiliate WYFX/62 \"FOX 17/62\" carries the network out of pattern at 11 PM. Or, if ABC affiliate WYTV/33 somehow mounts a new digital subchannel to run MNTV. We don't consider that very likely...\n\nOdds and Ends and Sides\n\nODDS: Exiting \"Kiss FM\" Cleveland PD Dan Mason weighs in with AllAccess on his appointment as PD of sister Miami top 40 outlet \"Y100\": \"It's an honor and privilege to be part of one of the most legendary Top 40 stations in America. This is my dream job and I look forward to working alongside DAVE DENVER and (RVP/GM) MIKE CRUSHAM to make an already great station even greater.\"\n\nRadio and Records Online has their version of the story here. It reminds us of how Mason, by far WAKS' first programming employee, guided the station's move from class A rimshot 104.9/Lorain (now upgraded and used by Seaway classical WCLV) to the much stronger 96.5 signal once occupied by Akron's WKDD (now on Canton-licensed 98.1 out of an upgraded stick in Hartville).\n\nAs far as the opening caused by Mason's departure south, Clear Channel regional programming VP Kevin Metheny is heading up the search at WAKS. He's soliciting resumes and audio via E-Mail at his CC E-Mail address. For those who don't know the mailing address of the Clear Channel World Domination HQ by now, it's 6200 Oak Tree Boulevard, 4th Floor, Cleveland, OH 44131-2510.\n\nWe're far from experts in the realm of Top 40 radio, but we'd have to say that Kasper has a good shot at shedding the \"acting\" from his new \"Kiss FM\" title. For one, he's been alongside Mason as APD/MD for some time at WAKS, except for a brief stint doing afternoons at Clear Channel Philadelphia top 40 outlet WIOQ \"Q102\"...\n\nENDS: The Toledo Blade finally picks up on the exit of long-time WSPD/1370 news director Tom Watkins from the Toledo Clear Channel building, which OMW first reported last week.\n\nThe Blade's Russ Lemmon characterizes the move as \"getting the boot\", though Watkins (and WSPD program director Brian Wilson) will not comment on the specifics to the newspaper as the parties work out a separation agreement. Watkins will NOT call the move a \"retirement\", and says he's \"on the market\" for a new gig. Clear Channel Toledo's news department is now overseen by Wilson's wife, veteran radio news anchor Cassie Wilson.\n\nMeanwhile, WSPD's newest employee - former WNWO \"NBC 24\" reporter Kevin Milliken - has been filling in news-wise. And Milliken also continues hosting the talk show \"Eye on Toledo\" (weeknights 6-7 PM). Despite burning the radio candle at both ends of the day, Milliken continues to update his new blog. Hmm. Either he's a reader of OMW, or he just happened to pick the same Blogspot template...\n\nSIDES: AllAccess reports that there's a new local show in evenings at Clear Channel sports talker WONE/980 Dayton (\"980 Homer\"). \"The Sports Mafia\" features Steve Huggins, a station weekender and former host at a Sarasota station, and producer/host Dave Alexander.\n\n\"The Sports Animal\" is primarily a repeater for its sister Cincinnati station, WSAI/1360 (\"1360 Homer\"), and mirrors the Cincinnati-based station's programming from 6 AM to 6 PM, including affiliations for both stations with Premiere's Jim Rome. But the 6-8 PM slot has been local for some time...we're just losing memory of the show/hosts who held down evenings before on the Dayton station. WSAI airs Premiere's Phil Hendrie in the 6-9 PM slot, when it isn't pre-empted by sports play-by-play.\n\nAnd a side note to our side note - NBC TV has declined to pick up Hendrie's sitcom, \"Teachers\", for the 2006-2007 TV season. But Phil was well aware of that prospect even before announcing he was leaving his radio show to concentrate on acting...\n\nThe OMW \"News/Talk On FM\" Watch\n\nWe promised to bring word of companies converting FM stations to talk or news/talk (or sports) formats across the nation, and there's now officially another one on the way. (Thanks to Perry Michael Simon at AllAccess for the tip!)\n\nIn New Orleans, Clear Channel is about to wipe out classic rock mainstay WRNO/99.5 for a new FM news/talk station. New Orleans Times-Picayune media columnist Dave Walker reports that the \"working date\" for the new station is June 1st. From the description, it sounds like it'll be a lot like the company's successful FM news/talker in Pittsburgh, WPGB/104.7. Clear Channel actually has had the rights to ABC Radio's Sean Hannity for a few months - a competing AM talker stopped airing Hannity in February - and we wouldn't be surprised to see them to land Rush Limbaugh as well.\n\nBut the flip has been all over the radio rumor mill in the Big Easy for at least a month or two. In fact, Entercom, which owns news/talk powerhouse WWL/870 in New Orleans, recently added a permanent FM simulcast to the AM broadcast. Many NOLA radio observers believe Entercom returned FM 105.3 to the WWL simulcast as a pre-emptive strike to Clear Channel's then-rumored FM talk effort.\n\nThere are indeed some parts of this story that are unique to New Orleans. In the weeks and months after Hurricane Katrina, Clear Channel and Entercom actually cooperated to form \"United Radio Broadcasters\"...delivering vital news and information over a number of both AM and FM frequencies owned by both companies (and others). Clear Channel has apparently come to the belief that they need a news/talker in New Orleans due to the continuing appetite for news and information in that market.\n\nFor now, this makes New Orleans one of the few markets with two major FM news/talk stations. Others include Salt Lake City, where Bonneville AM blowtorch KSL/1160's FM simulcast on 102.7 gets competition from upstart Simmons FM talk KFMS/97.5.\n\nThe WRNO name may be familiar to radio hobbyists even far afield from New Orleans. \"The Rock of New Orleans\" once had a shortwave radio sister station, which simulcast large chunks of the FM rocker's programming some time ago. The shortwave outlet known as WRNO still exists as far as we know, though it is no longer co-owned with the FM station now owned by Clear Channel. It now runs mostly paid religious programming, and hasn't simulcast WRNO-FM in many years..."
