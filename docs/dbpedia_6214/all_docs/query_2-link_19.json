Emily M. Phillips Applicant C. T. 2/ 3/ 16 20539527 . Legals Andrew Welsh- Huggins The Associated Press WESTERVILLE - Study your surroundings. Find exits. Identify makeshift weapons. Americans are gleaning those tips and others as they pack classes on how to react to and survive a shooting. Such training is already common at schools, colleges and businesses, but sessions for the general public are the next step in confronting fears of mass violence that have been around for years and, for many, came to a head after the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. Police have offered the \" awareness training\" in Livonia, Mich., and Douglasville, Ga., while more than 600 people have attended classes taught by the Potter County Sheriff's Office in Amarillo, Texas, beginning about three years ago. Public demand increased dramatically after the shooting in December that killed 14 in San Bernardino, Calif., said Lt. Scott Giles, a class instructor in Amarillo. \" This is really just something that was born out of necessity,\" Giles said. \" Active shooter events just continue to happen.\" Potter County is one of several sheriff's departments that provide training based on the CRASE curriculum: Civilian Response to Active Shooter Events. CRASE teaches an approach dubbed ADD: \" Avoid\" the situation by getting out, \" Deny\" by barricading inside a room, and as a last resort, \" Defend\" by fighting back. A class offered by Columbus- suburb Westerville filled up so quickly that a second had to be scheduled for later this month. The city of about 38,000, with a per capita income well above the rest of Ohio, regularly tops lists of the country's best suburbs. \" We just feel the world has changed. There's evil out there,\" said retiree TomMadine, 67, who attended the first Westerville class last month with his wife, Sue Madine, along with dozens of others. People today understand that such threats are real and could happen in their own communities, said Police Chief Joe Morbitzer. Officers teach a \" Run, Hide, Fight\" curriculum similar to ADD. \" Part of the issue is that people don't know how to avoid becoming victims,\" Morbitzer said. \" In today's society that's bad, that you've got to practice victim avoidance, but you have to.\" At the Jan. 28 Westerville class, officers Dan Pignatelli and John Jeffries emphasized \" situational awareness.\" They mixed practical tips - for instance, the best exit in an emergency is not always the way you came in, and if you're hiding, always turn the lights off- with case studies from the 1999 Columbine shooting, the 2007 Virginia Tech killings and others. As a last resort, a weapon could be as near as the closest chair, pair of scissors or blunt object, they said. \" You've got to have a game plan,\" Jeffries, a 31- year police veteran, told the audience. His comment was part of a bigger point both instructors drove home throughout the two- hour class: that people must overcome inaction when something bad happens. Instructors in Ohio and elsewhere don't take a position on whether people legally allowed to carry a gun should intervene to stop an attacker. But they worry about what happens once police arrive. \" When a civilian, let alone a trained officer, opens up firing in an active shooter situation, there is a good chance that civilian may be mistaken for the shooter,\" said Philip Schaenman, a security expert who has studied some of the country's worst shootings, including Virginia Tech. Americans pack shooting survival classes Terrence Petty and Steven Dubois The Associated Press PORTLAND, Ore. - The jailed leader of an armed group that took over an Oregon wildlife preserve struck a defiant tone Tuesday while again urging four holdouts to leave, saying local residents should control the federally owned property and U. S. officials do not belong there. Ammon Bundy said the FBI and Oregon State Police surrounding Malheur National Wildlife Refuge are leading an \" armed occupation,\" words typically reserved for the ranchers and others that launched the standoff on Jan. 2. He said the refuge \" belongs to the people,\" according to a statement read by his attorney. \" I am requesting that the remaining protesters go home now so their lives are not taken,\" Bundy's statement said. He is among 11 people arrested in connection with the standoff, whose adherents have called federal land restrictions burdensome and demanded the government turn over public lands to local control. Many were taken into custody during a traffic stop last week that left one occupier dead. All face a felony conspiracy charge of using intimidation to prevent federal employees from their work. Bundy will stay behind bars while his attorneys build their case that the standoff was intended as a \" peaceful protest and civil disobedience.\" A federal judge has allowed a couple of others to go free pending trial. Meanwhile, the handful of remaining occupiers offered no signs they are ready to leave. They gave an interview Monday on an online talk show on a YouTube channel called Revolution Radio. \" We're still here,\" said David Fry, adding that the four hope sympathizers will come out to back them up. \" We need the American people to get the courage to stand up.\" Bundy pleaded for them to go home and aligned with his father, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, on demanding federal and state authorities clear out of the area. The elder Bundy, who was involved in a high- profile 2014 standoff with the government over grazing rights, sent a certified letter to the local sheriff Monday, saying the refuge should be placed under local control. Unlike his son, Cliven Bundy has not called for the last occupiers to leave. Federal prosecutors are building a case against Ammon Bundy and his followers to show that the occupation was a threat to residents and federal employees. Prosecutors say the group, once numbering a couple dozen, was ready to use violence to hold on to the refuge. The standoff also has created divisions among residents that will take time to heal. Many locals want the occupation to end and are eager to get on with their lives. But others sympathize with Bundy's complaints, which are part of a long- running dispute over federal management of public lands in the West. Some have rallied in support and opposition to the standoff, the latter often citing the death of an Arizona rancher by police. Robert \" LaVoy\" Finicum was killed Jan. 26 during a confrontation with FBI agents and Oregon State Police on a remote road. Federal authorities have released aerial video and said Finicum was going for a gun in his jacket pocket. Bundy's relatives say the shooting was not justified. Standoff leader strikes defiant tone from behind bars Bundy AP Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer welcomes community members to a first- ever class about reacting to and surviving an active shooter last month.\n\nSearch the The Chronicle Telegram Today with a Free Trial\n\nWe want people to find what they are looking for at NewspaperArchive.
