        "text": "Returning home recently from a long day of television productions, meetings and a husbandly duty of shopping for dinner, I saw a crowd of kids standing in our neighbors' lawn. Curiosity piqued, I strolled over to see what was going on.\n\nOur neighbors' son, 10-year-old Carter Sterling, had set up a stand and was selling cups of lemonade to kids and adults in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen I asked him why, he didn’t hesitate — nor lose a sale — as he answered: \"I was just hoping to be able to help some people.\" He planned to give his earnings to the American Cancer Society, because a family member had cancer.\n\nI thought, \"How cool.\" In this age of \"us vs. them\" and a \"they are not like us\" mentality, it seems fewer Americans are getting along with and helping fewer Americans.\n\nThe son of educators Joe and Kelli Sterling, Carter and his younger brother, Jack, obviously are being raised the right way. That is so reassuring.\n\nToday, there is an atmosphere rife with accusations of \"alternative facts,\" claims of \"fake news,\" lies and insults and the demeaning of others. And here is a 10-year-old child who was taking it upon himself to do what he thought was the right thing to do to help other people.\n\nThankfully, Carter is not alone in his thinking; there are many of you reading this column who feel the same way.\n\nFeeling of malaise\n\nIn today’s America, too many people feel there is a deep malaise that has set upon our nation like a cloud of toxic smog that covers everything, everybody, everywhere. Sticky, gooey, smelly, stifling malaise.\n\nWe watch or read the news, and many of us get caught up in all its negativity. It is breeding sadness, depression and hostility. It is affecting almost everything we do, as we become grumpy to family and coworkers and constantly complain while feeling unable to do anything about it.\n\nThe reporting of the news is not the cause of our angst, and, of course, the news is not \"the enemy of the people.\" It is in some ways our salvation as a society.\n\nBut just what is the cause? Why are we feeling this way?\n\nIt is because of the childish actions and statements of many national elected officials? I don’t have to name names; we know who they are. Some of us complain, though others of us cover for them, or encourage them and make excuses for it.\n\nBut if that is the cause, what is the solution?\n\nHow do we reverse the anger, the hatefulness, the depression and the feeling of helpfulness America is facing? How do we restore our hope in our country and our democracy?\n\nHope is answer\n\nRonald Reagan had his Shining City on the Hill; Lyndon Johnson, his Great Society; Barack Obama, his \"change we can believe in;\" George H.W. Bush, his \"Kinder, Gentler Nation\" and Thousand Points of Light; and even Franklin Roosevelt had his New Deal. As presidents, they recognized we Americans need hope, that we can accomplish anything together as Americans if we maintain our hope.\n\nHope is a main ingredient to our overcoming malaise, so I asked members of our community what they hoped for. Here are their responses:\n\nSam Purses, former mayor of Canton, evoked Thomas Merton: \"He who hopes in God, trusts God, whom he never sees, to bring him to the possession of things that are beyond imagination.\"\n\nThe Rev. Walter Moss, project director of the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV): \"I'm hopeful that we will not give up on hope. Hope is a powerful word that we need in our heart each and every day. Hope gives us promise for tomorrow.\"\n\nAndrea Perry, Canton safety director, quoted Nelson Mandela: \"May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears. I hope that my choices in life have always shown that I have no fear, but hope for a better day.\"\n\nDennis Branch, an information technology expert, said he hopes \"we get more personal servitude from our elected officials … and get an understanding from them that they work for us, not a political party.\"\n\nBriaunna Z. Ponder, my learned daughter, whose age of 30 years belies her wisdom, said: \"I hope that people would take the time to learn about their personal biases and understand how those biases influence their daily life — especially in regard to their prejudices against people of color.\"\n\nAll of these folks are like many of you. They all have hope, like Carter Sterling, that we can make a difference in folks' lives.\n\nCarter was hopeful that his contribution would make a difference. He had no idea that, in my mind, his act of hope far outweighed his monetary contribution (though he did raise $50!).\n\nJoining together\n\nAnd that attitude is growing. More and more Republicans, Democrats, independents and members of other political parties and different religions are joining together. They see our country needing them to converge and set aside individual issues, without betraying their values, to compromise and move us forward.\n\nThey see themselves as the civilized counter to the uncivilized actions that are being perpetrated by uncivilized actors.\n\nDean Marini, general manager of local television station WIVM and vice president of Image Video Teleproductions said this:\n\n\"There is more that unites us than divides us. More things bring us together than break us apart. My hope is we fix our minds and actions on those things, and the others won't matter so much\".\n\nI see this trend taking root and growing among Americans. I see us, as good Americans and good citizens, with good values and good mores, who have dreams and aspirations of making it in our successful capitalistic and democratic society. I see that we still have that hope, in spite of what some of our national leaders say and do.\n\nIn fact, I see a lot of you selling lemonade, in your own way, like Carter Sterling.\n\nRon Ponder is a periodic contributor to The Canton Repository.
