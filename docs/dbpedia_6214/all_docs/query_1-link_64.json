        "text": "History\n\nFrom 1989 to 2008, W23BZ was owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and served as a satellite repeater for the network.\n\nOn March 30, 2006, the station was granted a construction permit to begin converting operations to digital television.\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced that the Guardian Enterprise Group would sell its original, full-powered station, WSFJ-TV, to TBN for $16 million.[3] In exchange, Guardian acquired W23BZ from TBN in an affiliation swap of their respective channels, and transferred WSFJ's programming to that channel on October 1, 2008. However, Guardian found themselves at a disadvantage, as, having moved to a low-power signal, they lost their must-carry status; as a result, Guardian urged viewers to contact their cable systems to pick up GTN after the move to channel 23. [4] As of December 2009, Guardian reached an agreement for W23BZ to be carried on Insight Communications channel 283, and WOW channel 192, leaving Time Warner Cable as the sole cable system to yet carry W23BZ on either analog or digital services.\n\nIn late February 2011, W23BZ was off-the-air as it flash cut to digital broadcast. The station returned to the air as W23BZ-D on March 2, 2011.\n\nOn September 26, 2011, W23BZ-D picked up Bounce TV upon its launch; the station carried its programming on channel 23.1, mixed in with local programming and syndicated fare acquired from other sources."
