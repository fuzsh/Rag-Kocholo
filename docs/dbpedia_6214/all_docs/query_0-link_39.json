        "text": "Columbus TV Outlet Sold\n\nJune 30, 2008 by ohiomediawatch\n\nGuardian Television independent/religious/former ION affiliate WSFJ/51 Newark/Columbus is being sold.\n\nThe trade site TV Newsday (or is it tvnewsday, or TVNEWSDAY?) reported last week that Guardian is flipping WSFJ to Trinity Broadcasting, giving the Santa Ana CA-based religious TV giant its third full-power O&O station serving a major Ohio market.\n\n(The others are WDLI/17 Canton in the Cleveland market, and WKOI/43 Richmond IN, a rimshot into the Cincinnati and Dayton markets.)\n\nThe move beans the end of the mostly secular “family friendly” format at what’s been known as “GTN51”, as TBN will presumably install its own 24/7 satellite-fed religious format.\n\nBut the spirit of “GTN51” lives on, in Guardian’s soon-to-be-launched “.2 Network”, a family-friendly entertainment satellite feed being offered nationwide to stations looking to add value to their digital subchannels.\n\nIn the TV Newsday article, Harry A. Jessell writes:\n\nReached by phone, Guardian CEO Richard Schilg declined to comment on the price tag, but said the proceeds will capitalize the .2 Network.\n\n“It allows us to be debt free at the launch and gives us a war chest for future needs,” he said. “It is positive all the way around. The fact that the buyer is TBN preserves the religious legacy of the station for the Columbus community.”\n\nAnd as such, we assume that explains an earlier comment by Guardian at “.2″‘s launch…that the digi-network wouldn’t necessarily land on WSFJ-DT 51.2.\n\nAt the time, station/network officials hinted at the prospect of a future group deal putting “.2” on another group’s Columbus outlet.\n\nBut TBN already feeds four of its own religious 480i subchannels on its DT stations – including WDLI-DT here – in addition to the 480i simulcast/main signal…and we’ll assume they won’t change that MO in Columbus.\n\nThe Newark-licensed station already has something in common with its soon-to-be sister full-power stations serving Ohio. (TBN, of course, has low-power translators basically at every wide spot on the road in Ohio and beyond.)\n\nThe station nudged itself closer to Columbus a couple of years back, and improved its coverage. Though the linked article refers to a new analog antenna installed in 2006, the new site between Newark and Columbus also carries WSFJ-DT.\n\nUp here in Northeast Ohio, WDLI-DT did much the same, putting its full-power DT facility in Akron, where it sits just up the road from whatever remains of Rolling Acres Mall – basically across the street from facilities for WVPX/23 and WONE/97.5. Channel 17 analog has long-been based off Route 62 in Stark County’s Louisville, east of Canton.\n\nAnd though Richmond IN-licensed WKOI hasn’t actually moved its transmitter recently – at least that we can see – its maximized DT facility will apparently give it much wider coverage of both Cincinnati and Dayton from its perch just east of Oxford…\n\nStopping By For A Visit\n\nJune 28, 2008 by ohiomediawatch\n\nOur infrequent update schedule had one formerly regular reader assuming that we’re gone for good!\n\nNo, we’re not.\n\nYour Primary Editorial Voice(tm) has been out of town and busy, for one, and we’re about to leave Northeast Ohio for a while again.\n\nIn the past, that’s triggered something in the space-time-media continuum, but we’re not sure our exit from the region still results in major changes. One of our vacations a couple of years ago ended up with even Cleveland Browns GM Phil Savage scrambling for his job!\n\nHeh. (Tongue in cheek, folks, we don’t really BELIEVE we have that kind of effect…it’s kind of a running joke.)\n\nOne of the biggest reasons we haven’t been here is simple…there’s just not that much going on during the lazy days of early summer. If we’ve missed anything, particularly in our core focus area of Northeast Ohio, let us know.\n\nUntil then, some random items that ARE going on…\n\nWESTERN RESERVE BOUND: As first hinted in an article by Akron Beacon Journal pop culture writer Rich Heldenfels, Kent-based public TV outlet WNEO/45-WEAO/49 will launch a new brand.\n\nThe stations will indeed adopt the overall name Western Reserve Public Media, with the TV stations taking the on-air name Western Reserve PBS.\n\nA release sent to OMW by what’s now known as “PBS 45 & 49” says the new names kick in this fall, after the local pubcaster joins public radio outlet WKSU/89.7 in divying up new space in the United Building in downtown Akron – which happens July 1st.\n\nThe space, of course, is that no longer needed by current primary tenant WKYC/3 after the end of its “Akron/Canton News” broadcast on Time Warner Cable. WKYC will continue to maintain its Akron/Canton bureau there, but with space only needed for two – bureau chief and long-time “ACN” anchor Eric Mansfield, and what’s sounding like just one photographer.\n\nAnd with the new name Western Reserve Public Media, WNEO/WEAO will call their new United Building space the “Western Reserve Broadcast Hub”.\n\nThe name change is actually rather interesting on other levels.\n\nIt’s one broadcast outlet’s answer to a question just about all TV stations face in the new age. Back in the day, a TV station’s channel number was be-all-and-end-all in branding.\n\nEven stations with strong call letter or other identification have long prominently featured their channel number, both overall and in newscast identification. “Channel 3 News”. “NewsChannel 5”. “FOX 8 News”. “19 Action News”.\n\nStarting on February 17, 2009, nearly all of these channel numbers become “virtual”, with only a few stations actually broadcasting on their former analog channels (WJW/8 among them) after the digital transition.\n\nThough the PSIP program information stream still assures that WKYC will be “Channel 3” even if it broadcasts on digital channel 17 “under the hood”, this – and perhaps more importantly, the growing move of media organizations to the Internet – will likely nudge broadcast operations to reconsider some branding.\n\nBack to PBS 45 & 49…er…Western Reserve PBS…er…Western Reserve Public Media.\n\nQuoting the station press release:\n\nTrina Cutter, president and CEO of PBS 45 & 49, said the new identity prepares the organization for advancements in broadcast technology. “The advent of digital television opens a new realm of possibilities for multiple broadcast channels,” Cutter said. “Western Reserve Public Media better reflects the breadth of public television services that we have already begun to provide to northeast Ohioans.”\n\nSimply put, the numbers “45” and “49” mean less and less with digital TV, multiple subchannels therein, and the rapid growth of the Internet and other less traditional services.\n\nAnd let’s not forget that Channels 45 and 49 have never, as far as we know, actually ever been on cable anywhere under those cable positions. To get to “PBS 45 & 49” on Time Warner Cable’s Cleveland system, a viewer has to find cable channel 9.\n\nIt’s similar to the “ideaStream” corporate name/branding for Cleveland’s WVIZ/25 and WCPN/90.3, though there’s no indication – for now – that WNEO/WEAO and WKSU will do anything more than share space and occasional programming collaboration (“Folk Alley”) at the United Building…\n\nNO MORE ANALOG: While we’re talking about the digital TV transition, OMW hears that one Northern Ohio TV station has already turned off its analog signal.\n\nHuh?\n\nYep, it’s the station most our readers can’t get anyway, Mid-State Television independent WMFD/68 Mansfield, on the edge of the Cleveland television market.\n\nThe station’s website notes that the analog channel 68 signal was turned off earlier this month, on June 16th. Only WMFD-DT/12, still dutifully PSIP-responding as “68.1”, remains.\n\nThe reason for the early termination? Mid-State successfully convinced the FCC that it needed the summer months to remove the analog 68 antenna, and replace it with the new DT 12 antenna. The digital side is currently served by an antenna that’s currently side-mounted on the tower.\n\nQuoting from the station’s application for extension of time to complete its upgraded digital signal:\n\nWMFD-DT CURRENTLY IS LICENSED TO OPERATE WITH A SIDE-MOUNTED DTV ANTENNA, AND THE WMFD-TV ANALOG ANTENNA IS TOP-MOUNTED ON THE TOWER.\n\nA STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE TOWER HAS SHOWN THAT THE TOWER CANNOT SUPPORT THE ADDITION OF THE AUTHORIZED FINAL DTV ANTENNA TO THE STRUCTURE AS IT NOW STANDS, AND THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE AUTHORIZED FACILITIES WILL REQUIRE BOTH REMOVAL OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND ADDITIONAL WORK ON THE TOWER ITSELF.\n\nAFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE ENGINEERING STRESS STUDY, MID STATE HAS DEVELOPED A PLAN WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR ITS FINAL DTV FACILITIES TO BE CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO THE DTV TRANSITION DATE.\n\nSpeaking of the aforementioned WNEO/45 Alliance, OMW already reported that the station expects to shut off analog 45 later this year, for similar reasons…with the final WNEO-DT also landing on 45 by the transition.\n\nAnd like other local TV stations, WMFD cites Northern Ohio’s often fierce winter weather as a concern in construction timelines. (When the FCC came up with the digital transition date, did they not consult the National Weather Service?)\n\nWMFD-now-only-DT is a part of the Gunther Meisse Mid-Ohio Broadcast Empire, along with ESPN Radio outlet WRGM/1440 Ontario, AC mainstay WVNO/106.1 “Mix 106.1” Mansfield, and sister LPTVer WOHZ-CA/50, which at last check ran weather information and assorted other programming…\n\nZAP!: OMW hears that the Clear Channel Columbus studio complex on West 5th Street got quite a jolt this week…a lighting jolt that took the stations off the air at shortly after midnight Wednesday night/Thursday morning.\n\nThe resulting damage? A laundry list of some of the nuts and bolts needed to run a modern radio operation, from audio board outlets, satellite receivers and cards, to STL equipment.\n\nOMW hears that the company’s entire Columbus engineering staff spent all night Wednesday into early Thursday morning making fixes and swapping in spare or emergency equipment, bringing all the cluster’s stations back to the air by 2 AM, then fixing up the rest of the problems the rest of the late night/early morning hours.\n\nIt reminds us of the lightning jolt the company’s sister Akron/Canton cluster got some time ago, which forced one of those stations to run off of a small Mackie mixer board until the main board could be put back into service…\n\nDENNIS’ MOVE: OMW hears directly from WCLV/104.9’s Robert Conrad on a new weekend program starting next month.\n\nWell, it’s not “new”, per se.\n\n“The Dennis Lewin Radio Program” has been heard most recently on Salem talk WHK/1420, and before that, on Radio One talk/brokered outlet WERE/then-1300.\n\nIt’s moving to classical WCLV starting on July 6th, though we don’t know if Mr. Lewin will (apparently) continue to pay for his airtime.\n\nMr. Conrad tells OMW about his new Sunday programming addition, and explains how it fits well with the station:\n\nDennis has had a colorful career as a contemporary and classical musician and teacher, but foremost among his passions is his successful radio program, “The Dennis Lewin Radio Program”.\n\nDuring the show Dennis gives an in-depth view of the lives and times of the greatest composers, conductors and musicians of all time; including Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Copland, Stravinsky, Gershwin and more.\n\nA hallmark of the program is Dennis’ interaction with the listeners. Be prepared for trivia quizzes, musicial and non-musical, and, perhaps, even being “on-the-air,” a new wrinkle for WCLV.\n\nListener calls on WCLV? Wow.\n\nLewin will be heard Sundays from 1 to 3 PM on WCLV. And his website notes that his radio show also airs on another station outside Northeast Ohio, New Hampshire low-power “World Music” outlet WXGR-LP/101.5 Dover NH…\n\nSHE’S BACK, IN CLEVELAND AT LEAST: And speaking of Lewin’s former outlet, it’s about to get one of its key weekday hosts back.\n\nTalk Radio Network mid-morning host Laura Ingraham is apparently set to return to the network on Monday. Ingraham airs in Cleveland on WHK/1420.\n\nWe say “apparently” because word of her return came from her own website:\n\n***BREAKING NEWS***\n\nIt’s official! Laura will return to the radio airwaves on Monday, June 30. Buckle your seatbelts!\n\nThe June 30th return date has been given by TRN in recent weeks, but this is the first indication from Ms. Ingraham’s side that she’d return on that date – after a nearly month-long apparent contract dispute.\n\nWe’re assuming the website is under her control. She’s used it in the past few weeks to notify her listeners that she wasn’t off the air by her own choice, and has even used it to implore listeners to contact TRN executives directly.\n\nThough we’ll assume WHK will be along for the ride for her return Monday, the lengthy absence has cost Laura one of her other large market Ohio affiliates.\n\nClear Channel talk WKRC/550 Cincinnati has dumped Ingraham just three days before her return, and will replace her with the former occupant of that time slot, Premiere’s Glenn Beck.\n\nCincinnati Enquirer TV/radio guru John Kiesewetter on the move:\n\n(WKRC-AM PD Tony) Bender says he got tired of getting the run-around from her people, while fill-in Monica Crowley was on the air, so he’s putting on Beck. Ironically, Ingraham’s website says she’ll return to her radio show on Monday. Too late.\n\nBeck was bounced from the 9-noon slot on WKRC so the station could pick up area native Tony Snow’s FOX Radio program. Ingraham ended up in the mid-morning slot on WKRC after Snow left FOX for the White House press secretary job.\n\nWhile WKRC went elsewhere in the time slot, Beck landed in Cincinnati on Cumulus then-talk WFTK/96.5 “SuperTalk FM”, which has since gone rocking as “96 Rock”.\n\nBoth hosts have TV presences. Since his first go-round on WKRC, Beck launched a successful evening show on CNN Headline News. And Ingraham’s “Just In” started last week on FOX News Channel, though for now, it’s apparently an audition.\n\nOur apologies if that URL doesn’t work for Kiesewetter’s blog post. The Cincinnati Enquirer’s recent revamp produces URLs that look like extreme messes for its blog posts, under the header “PluckPersona” (whatever the heck that is), with lots of random characters. If you can’t find it, go to cincinnati.com and click manually on “Blogs”.\n\nWe just love it when changes are made for the good of the new service provider, and not for the ease of the public. Add to that the fact that the Blogger editor sometimes chokes on URLs with ampersands in them (like the FCC application linked for WMFD above), and…well, it’s frustrating for us…\n\nRandom Weekend Cleanup\n\nJune 21, 2008 by ohiomediawatch\n\nCome to think of it, we have some early summer cleaning to do at the Palatial OMW World Headquarters as well…\n\nJUNE 20TH: We did not note it here beforehand, but Friday was a busy day at the Clear Channel World Domination HQ compound on Oak Tree.\n\nCleveland talker WTAM/1100 morning host Bill Wills celebrated his 10th anniversary at the Northern Ohio version of “The Big One”. He joined ‘TAM on June 20, 1998 – from the original “Big One”, co-owned WLW/700 Cincinnati.\n\n“Wills and Snyder” is a pretty typical large-market morning news/information/traffic/sports/weather/feature program. Wills is not controversial, for the most part (that’s left to hosts later in the schedule), but has stuck around. His stint at WLW lasted 13 years, so he’s no stranger to radio longevity.\n\nThe “Snyder” in the show’s current title is station mainstay Mike Snyder, WTAM’s long-time sports director who slid comfortably into the role after the unfortunate passing of one Casey Coleman…lost to listeners and the world way too early with his death from pancreatic cancer…\n\nAND THAT SAME DAY: Clear Channel pulled out all the stops for one of its newest arrivals, as rock WMMS/100.7 Cleveland morning driver Shane “Rover” French hosted the live “Roverfest” event.\n\nWe’re not – as explained numerous times – in “Rover’s Morning Glory’s” target demo. And since he’s been back on the radio in Cleveland since April, that flood of RoverFans which followed links to us from blog postings on his own website has probably long left.\n\nSo, we didn’t stop by West 6th Street on Friday afternoon. But we’re sure the target audience enjoyed their day of “All Things Rover”…\n\nCLEVELAND GETS PLUGGED IN: Plain Dealer media columnist Julie Washington weighs in Saturday on the addition of “People Meters” by TV ratings service Nielsen in the Cleveland/Akron (Canton) TV market later this year.\n\nSome 600 lucky households will get these boxes starting in August, with the goal of accurately tracking daily viewership – which will get broken out into monthly reports, basically.\n\nQuoting Ms. Washington’s article:\n\nOften, stronger stations are hurt and weaker stations are helped when meters come to town, says local ratings guru Gary Stark, director of programming and research for Scripps-Howard Television Station Group and WEWS Channel 5.\n\nIf you were to open up the TV dictionary for Cleveland, the “weaker stations” entry would have two large logos…those of Raycom Media’s WOIO/19 “CBS 19” and WUAB/43 “My43”.\n\nTo that effect, local Raycom boss “The Controversial” Bill Applegate tells Washington that he expects his stations to be helped by what he calls “more accurate” data.\n\nThe move to continuously measure TV ratings is expected to eventually lessen the dependence of “sweeps periods”, the four times a year local stations pull out all the gimmicks and stops to help goose more ratings.\n\nBut Applegate notes that the networks will still offer “sweeps months” resources and promotions, presumably because there are still a lot of markets not on the People Meters… and he believes local stations will still attach their promotional efforts to those months as a result.\n\nFor now, Ms. Washington reports that stations will start getting monthly reports in addition to the “sweeps” reports they already get.\n\nThere appears to be no interest or talk about “live” or even daily ratings data being offered…which is probably a good thing, not to walk into that Max Headroom world of instant ratings feedback.\n\nAnd thanks to our colleague and friend Blaine Thompson over at Indiana RadioWatch, for the easy-to-paste link from Cleveland.com. We didn’t feel like digging around to see wherever they stuck Ms. Washington’s article this time, or if they even posted it…\n\nMS. INGRAHAM “BACK”?: Fellow media blogger Brian Maloney at his “Radio Equalizer” has been keeping tabs on missing Talk Radio Network midday host Laura Ingraham.\n\nActually, Ingraham has been missing only from her syndicated radio show, which is on the schedule of Salem Cleveland talker WHK/1420.\n\nShe’s doing a TV tryout on the FOX News Channel, and has told just about anyone within earshot that no, she isn’t sick, no, she isn’t leaving radio, and that her absence from the TRN show is, well, their idea.\n\nWhile TRN continues to insist that Ms. Ingraham will be back behind the microphone “on or before” June 30th, Mr. Maloney uncovered a pretty telling and interesting E-Mail memo sent by the Oregon-based syndicator to her affiliates.\n\nWhile the reported memo continues to state that Laura Ingraham will be back soon, it trumpets the sudden popularity of her current fill-in, TRN weekend host Monica Crowley.\n\n(Locally, affiliate WHK dumped the Laura Ingraham Show Without Laura Ingraham for about a week for Salem’s own Mike Gallagher, but we are told they’ve returned to the Ingraham show with Crowley aboard.)\n\nThe purported TRN memo gushes excitedly about the “unsolicited” feedback from listeners and program directors about Ms. Crowley. Reading it, you think she was about to explode as the Next Big Radio Star, and the company is asking around about what weekday time slot would be best for Crowley to expand beyond weekends. Crowley’s own show is only carried in the region by Cumulus talk WPIC/790 out of Sharon PA, which is heard in much of the Youngstown market.\n\nIn reality, it’s probably a very public negotiating ploy to tell Laura Ingraham “see, you can be replaced if you don’t agree to our terms” – and to hasten her return to the program.\n\nThe memo seems to indicate that Crowley will continue to occupy the slot while Ingraham is gone, sending fill-ins like fellow TRN weekender Tammy Bruce to the sidelines…\n\nAND OTHER STUFF: Since we aren’t making a daily commitment to this thing, we’ve missed a lot of smaller items…like various on-air moves in markets outside our usual focus, like Columbus and Cincinnati.\n\nAnd a reader noted that we missed a lot about the on-air turmoil that’s apparently been going on at Toledo NBC affiliate WNWO/24, with various exits and contracts not being renewed.\n\nWe’re just reminding readers that…well, we’ll get to what we get to.\n\nAs a free service of your Primary Editorial Voice(tm), who has A Life and then some, it’s difficult to keep up with everything.\n\nThe easiest way for us to follow the markets outside Northeast Ohio is to have detailed, already written information (from various newspapers, trade sites, etc.), but even then, we may not have time to get to stuff and repost it here. Since we’re not really “breaking” a lot of items from outside our home area, we’re in no hurry if the news is already up elsewhere.\n\nSo, we appreciate the “heads up”. And please, keep sending us tips.\n\nBut we have no obligation to put up any specific item – and sometimes, may not even have the time if we have the inclination.\n\nThank you for your cooperation, as always…\n\nRandom Stuff, In No Particular Order\n\nJune 16, 2008 by ohiomediawatch\n\nAnd mostly just clearing out the “inbox” here at your Mighty Blog of Fun(tm)…\n\nTOLEDO OLDIES: Cumulus Toledo market oldies outlet WRQN/93.5 has made a change in evenings.\n\nVeteran Toledo – and elsewhere – radio personality Jim Brady has exited the oldies station’s 6 PM-11 PM slot, and is being replaced by another Toledo and station vet, Buddy Carr.\n\nCarr has been holding down a 10 AM-3 PM Saturday shift, which the station says he’ll keep after taking over nights full-time starting tonight.\n\nNo word about the future of Mr. Brady, though, who’s only tersely described as being “no longer an employee of Cumulus Toledo” as of Friday afternoon.\n\nWhile looking for more information about this story, we stumbled upon some audio of Jim Brady at one of his more famous stops, Toronto’s CFTR/680 – which at the time was mounting a contemporary music format, but is now Rogers Communications’ all-news outlet in Canada’s largest city as “680 News”.\n\nDip in with us by visiting this CFTR tribute site. Jim opens up the station aircheck taken back in 1980…\n\n“CSN” STOPS PRODUCTION: It’s a bit late, but an OMW reader Columbus-way passes along a recent article about the “Columbus Sports Network”, the Central Ohio regional sports outlet housed at LPTVer WCSN-LP/32 and seen on various cable channels in the Columbus area.\n\nColumbus Dispatch media writer Tim Feran reports that “CSN” ceased all in-house local production on June 7th, bumping a taped Columbus Destroyers arena football game for a live MLS Columbus Crew soccer contest for its final originally produced new event.\n\nQuoting the article and a CSN press release:\n\nA news release yesterday said the network “is suspending production operations while it explores potential changes in its business model. WCSN will continue to air pre-recorded programming while these business decisions are being considered.”\n\nIn March, early into its 10-year plan, Nungester said the network was “in good shape,” although he would not comment on whether CSN was profitable.\n\n“Any time you enter a capital-intensive business, there’s going to be a ramp-up,” Nungester said.\n\nWell, you can add the flagging economy, a concern for everyone in media these days. And when you’re working in what is very much a niche part of the TV market – Columbus-based minor league, second tier and leftover OSU sports – it’s tough to keep a new venture, which seems to have spent a lot of money, afloat…\n\nLOW WATTAGE SPORTS DAYTIMERS: What is it about low-wattage, mostly unattended AM daytime sports sister stations in Northeast Ohio, anyway?\n\nWe’ve chuckled here from time to time about the occasional disappearance of Media-Com’s WJMP/1520 in Kent, the 1,000 watt highly directional daytime FOX Sports Radio affiliate that has trouble reaching an intended audience in Akron. ‘JMP, of course, is the lightbulb-power sister/brother station of much-more-successful talk WNIR/100.1.\n\nThis time, same network, same power, similar frequency, different station.\n\nA heat wave and air conditioning failure at the Galleria brought down the mighty WWGK “Cleveland’s AM 1540, KNR2”, the little brother station to Good Karma’s WKNR/850 “ESPN 850”, for a few hours last week.\n\nLike most things at the Galleria Radio Empire, we learned about this on the air.\n\nWe learned about it because it was on the mind of WKNR assistant program director Aaron Goldhammer while he was basically unable to do anything about it. “Hammer” was at a golf course on a remote in his role as producer/sidekick to ‘KNR’s midday “The Really Big Show” with Tony Rizzo.\n\nThe heat which led Good Karma to bring in a portable air conditioner for the main WKNR studios apparently didn’t lead them to do the same for the unattended WWGK studios in the same building.\n\nUnlike WJMP’s usual technical difficulties, the WWGK signal and programming did return later that day…we heard the station back up shortly before its evening sign off.\n\nSince we mentioned America’s worst daytime rimshot AM signal out of the Broadcast Trailer Park between Kent and Ravenna, we’ll note that we flipped over to 1520 that same early pre-sunset evening…and WJMP is no longer stretching in its legal ID to claim listenership in Cleveland.\n\nIt’s just “Kent/Akron” for now, though with 1520’s anemic signal into much of Summit County, that’s a stretch as well. If they’re staying with “Kent/Akron”, we’ll resist the temptation to add “Mars/Jupiter” like we usually do…\n\nCleaning Up After Ourselves\n\nJune 12, 2008 by ohiomediawatch\n\nA few things just fell out, so we have to clean up after ourselves…\n\nFOX 8 FOLO: Well, at least we know that someone at the Cleveland Plain Dealer still reads OMW.\n\nAfter our item on the FCC’s approval of the sale of WJW/8 “FOX 8” and other FOX O&Os to Local TV, LLC, PD media columnist Julie Washington wrote an article for the following day’s paper – based on the same source we found, the “tvnewsday” trade news website.\n\nShortly after Ms. Washington’s story hit Cleveland.com Tuesday morning, the Business Courier of Cincinnati picked it up, citing both the PD story and the tvnewsday site.\n\nLook at what we started! (Well, technically, what “tvnewsday” started with our slight help moving it along.)\n\nThere is one other independent confirmation of the original story: Broadcasting & Cable magazine ran a story on its website Monday afternoon, noting the sale was expected to close in the 3rd quarter of this year.\n\nWe have one note about Ms. Washington’s article, though, particularly this part:\n\nIt is not clear whether Channel 8 will change network affiliations. The stations owned by Local TV have a variety of affiliations, according to the Local TV web site.\n\nOMW reported in one of our earlier items that we’ve been told that the Local TV buy includes a multi-year affiliation contract, keeping WJW as a FOX affiliate. We hear the deal lasts 10 years.\n\nEven if we’d not uncovered that small detail, we’d be surprised if there was an affiliation change.\n\nWe realize not everyone has this information, though, so we’re just noting it for our own readership…\n\nHOST MOVES – OR NOT: Two syndicated radio hosts have been the topic of much “behind the scenes” discussion as of late.\n\nOne is ABC Radio’s Sean Hannity, who reportedly has a clause in his contract triggered by the sale of ABC Radio’s operations to Citadel a ways back, with a “trigger date” reported by a number of sources to be – June 12th.\n\nA lot of the backchatter has been covered by “Radio Equalizer” blogger Brian Maloney, who reports that there’s a new “three way deal”…where Citadel, Clear Channel and Hannity will share in a partnership for his show.\n\nThe deal presumably would keep Hannity on Citadel’s big market talkers including flagship WABC/770 in New York City, and about 70 Clear Channel talk stations (including Akron’s WHLO/640, where Hannity’s show now airs 3-5 PM weekdays).\n\nSimilar reporting has crossed the transom from Radio-Info.com’s Tom Taylor.\n\nMeanwhile, another syndicated talker has been missing from the airwaves for a while now – and interesting explanations have come out as to why she hasn’t been on the air.\n\nTalk Radio Networks’ midday host Laura Ingraham’s show has been without, well, Ms. Ingraham. At some point, she felt the need to let listeners know why via her website, which most recently has borne this message:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW LISTENERS\n\nReports are circulating in the press that I “took a leave of absence” or walked out on my radio show. As I wrote in this space earlier this week, that is false. The decision to remove the Laura Ingraham Show from the airwaves was made unilaterally by Talk Radio Network as a tactic in contract negotiations, against my will and over my protest. Additionally, any notion that I am leaving radio is also completely false. After all my years on the air, you know that I would never voluntarily abandon you during such a critical time for our country. Power to the People.\n\nIngraham is busy, even if she’s not behind a radio microphone right now.\n\nShe starts a FOX News Channel 5 PM weekday show next Monday…which the New York Times’ Brian Stelter suggests is a tryout for a regular gig she’s likely to get. The move would certainly not prohibit her radio career from flourishing, as the dual radio/TV thing is done by a large number of FNC’s personalities – including Sean Hannity.\n\nIngraham has been heard weekdays on many Salem talk stations, including Cleveland’s WHK/1420. We haven’t heard the Ingraham show lately, but we do hear that WHK ran Salem’s own Mike Gallagher on Wednesday from 9 AM until noon, instead of whoever’s filling in for Laura…\n\nNATIONAL RADIO: Shortly after it started, XM Satellite Radio once featured the, uh, tones of Cleveland’s favorite on-air eating talk show host, Clear Channel talk WTAM/1100 afternoon sound machine and food maven Mike Trivisonno.\n\nTwo hours of Triv’s show aired on a same-day delay on one of XM’s talk channels, which was being programmed by Clear Channel. Other Clear Channel local hosts ended up on the channel, including WLW/700 Cincinnati mainstay Bill Cunningham, now syndicated traditionally on Sunday nights in the old Matt Drudge time slot.\n\nOak Tree is giving back a bit of Cleveland back to the satellite radio world – again.\n\nA slew of Clear Channel air personalities are doing (presumably voicetracked) shows for XM channel 21 (“Kiss 21”), the top 40/hit music channel Clear Channel still provides on the XM lineup.\n\nAnd two of those personalities are from Cleveland top 40 outlet WAKS/96.5 “Kiss FM” – afternoon driver/assistant program director/occasional OMW reader Kasper, and night slammer “Java Joel” Murphy.\n\nKasper’s XM shift will be from 10 AM-noon, and Java Joel hits the channel from 10 PM-\n\nmidnight. We’ll assume this is not all that difficult for them, as they both voicetrack other stations and presumably have “Kiss”-labeled bits stored up daily.\n\nJava Joel still, as far as we know, voicetracks Montreal-market rimshot WYUL/94.7 “Hits FM” in rural upstate New York. But he won’t be heard by XM Canada subscribers, since that division of the satellite company doesn’t carry the Clear Channel-programmed offerings. U.S. XM subscribers – including those in the Malone NY area near the Canadian border – will still hear his “Kiss 21” XM offerings in either country.\n\nXM and Clear Channel’s relationship is strained at this point. XM has even launched non-commercial clones of the Clear Channel offerings, after a legal struggle which ended up keeping Clear Channel’s XM offerings alive…"
