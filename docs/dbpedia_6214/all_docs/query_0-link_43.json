        "text": "W27EA-D, virtual channel 35 (UHF digital channel 27), is a low-powered, Class A Retro TV-affiliated television station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The station is owned by Media-Com, as part of a duopoly with radio station WNIR (FM) (which shares its broadcast facilities with W27EA-D in Franklin Township, which is located south of Kent).\n\nWAOH-CD (virtual and UHF digital channel 29) in Akron, was a translator of W27EA-D. On October 25, 2017, WAOH-CD signed off the air due to selling off their frequency in the FCC spectrum auction."
