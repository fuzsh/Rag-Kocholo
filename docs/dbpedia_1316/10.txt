Casper and the Angels is an American animated space police comedy television series produced by Hanna-Barbera for NBC's Saturday morning children's programming, and based on Harvey Comics' Casper the Friendly Ghost. It ran in 1979, airing 13 episodes that spanned one season.

A little ghost boy named Casper, with help from his older ghost friend, Hairy Scary, acts as a "guardian ghost" to Mini and Max, two female police officers living in the futuristic 22nd century.

Around the same time the series aired, Casper and Hairy Scary also starred in the unrelated present-day specials, Casper's Halloween Special and Casper's First Christmas, which also aired on NBC.
