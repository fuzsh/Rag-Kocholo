Beaty successfully demonstrates that there is much worthy of discussion in Archie comics and, perhaps more importantly, much work left to be done. This is not a comprehensive study of Archie, nor does it profess to be. It will leave a curious reader thinking about Archie and his pals in new and useful ways, and will hopefully spur more discussion, engagement, and scholarship. Bart Beaty has, I hope, challenged readers to reject the existing assumptions about popular comics in favour of a more nuanced, and therefore more fruitful, approach.” —­Brenna Clarke Gray, The Comics Grid, Journal of Comics Scholarship “For readers interested in the history and form of comics as art, Beaty offers analyses of visual humour, borderless panels and the central authors and illustrators of this era. Twelve-­Cent Archie will satisfy cultural critics, Archie fans and comics fans more broadly . . . This book is as fun and satisfying as reading an Archie digest.” —­Alberta Views “In its analytical vignettes on such a wide variety of topics, Twelve-­ Cent Archie attempts—­and succeeds—­not in ending our questions about Archie, but in showing us how many more questions we ought to be asking.” —­Children’s Literature Association Quarterly “Whether you’re interested in the differences between Harry Lucey’s Archie and Bob Montana’s, or simply haunted by the signifying structure that is Betty Cooper’s ponytail, there’s something here for everyone who’s ever read an Archie comic.” —Scott Bukatman, author of The Poetics of Slumberland: Animated Spirits and the Animated Spirit\n\n“An academic text as unconventional as its subject matter . . . Twelve-­Cent Archie proves both fascinating and remarkably easy to read.” —­The Mary Sue “Twelve-­Cent Archie is engaging and readable, funny and thoughtful, and worthwhile for fan and scholar alike.” —­The Comics Grid “An entertaining, diverse read.”\n\n—­Comics Worth Reading\n\n“Highly entertaining . . . what makes Twelve-­Cent Archie such a congenial read is that Beaty is a free thinker about comic books, going wherever, and with whatever improvised opinion, through his 100 brisk, chatty chapters.” —­The Arts Fuse “Beaty has crafted his larger critique into bite-­sized, self contained mini-­essays that help to keep you glued. Any given essay stands on its own and, honestly, you don’t even really have to read them in the order they appear in the book —­just like the best Archie comics, really. And Beaty’s attention to the minutiae of Archie comics is beyond astounding . . . By the time you get through Beaty’s astonishing triumph of scholarship, you will wish that all books about comics could be like this.” —­Vermicious\n\nT W E LV E- ­C E N T A RCHIE\n\nComics Culture Edited by Corey K. Creekmur, Craig Fischer, Charles Hatfield, Jeet Heer, and Ana Merino\n\nVolumes in the Comics Culture series explore the artistic, historical, social, and cultural significance of newspaper comic strips, comic books, and graphic novels, with individual titles devoted to focused studies of key titles, characters, writers, and artists throughout the history of comics; additional books in the series address major themes or topics in comics studies, including prominent genres, national traditions, and significant historical and theoretical issues. The series recognizes comics of all varieties, from mainstream comic books to graphic non-­fiction, produced between the late 19th-­ century and the present. The books in the series are intended to contribute significantly to the rapidly expanding field of comics studies, but are also designed to appeal to comics fans and casual readers who seek smart critical engagement with the best examples of the form.

To begin with, working-­class art is essentially a “showing” (rather than an “exploration”), a presentation of what is known already. It starts from the assumption that human life is fascinating in itself. It has to deal with recognisable human life, and has to begin with the photographic, however fantastic it may become; it has to be underpinned by a few simple but firm moral rules. —­Richard Hoggart, The Uses of Literacy Eep!

Economically, very little. Relatively speaking, Archie comics are not particularly sought after or in demand in comparison to other comics from the period in which they were most popular. Culturally, probably less. For people of a certain generation, Archie is like the air—­he is everywhere, but he is very little remarked upon. That Archie continues to hold some social relevance is evidenced by the fact that every time Archie Comics makes a major change—­introducing a gay character, proposing to have Archie marry Betty or Veronica—­it induces headlines around the world but still generates relatively little in the way of sales to the public. In the second decade of the twenty-­ first century, Archie’s circulation is barely existent in comparison to its postwar peak; its cultural cachet is even lower. Despite ongoing attempts to make Archie relevant for new generations of readers, the titles are widely regarded as old-­fashioned, outdated, a relic of the way that the American comic-­book industry used to work. Beyond the confines of the comics world, for the gatekeepers of legitimate culture, Archie may as well not exist at all. One of the most lowbrow examples of a particularly lowbrow art form, Archie is virtually untouchable. Take, for example, the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption. When Tim Robbins’s Andy starts his prison library, he risks a spell in “the can” when he plays Mozart’s “Sull’aria,” from The Marriage of Figaro, for the prisoners over the loudspeaker. As he does so, the guard who is supposed to be watching him is shown locked in the bathroom reading a copy of Jughead 9 (December 1951). The\n\nH 3\n\n4 T WE LVE - C ENT ARCH IE\n\ncontrast between the soaring Mozart duet and the lowly secondhand copy of Jughead (literally, toilet reading) could be neither starker nor more indicative of the low esteem with which Archie comics are held. Nostalgic (Andy received his money for the library, in story terms, only in 1955, so the issue of Jughead was already old), lowbrow, and completely out of fashion, what can there be to say about a topic as self-­evident as Archie? Academics have found extremely little to say on the subject to date. Ron Glasberg, a colleague of mine at the University of Calgary, published a 1991 article in the Journal of Popular Culture, “The Archie Code,” in which he suggested that the Archie-­Betty-­Veronica love triangle is the central narrative of the comic-­book universe and, further, that Betty’s blondness represents “goodness and pure love” and that Veronica “with her dark hair, suggests wealth—­with its attendant and potentially corrupting temptations.” Glasberg argues that Archie presents a theme of choosing between material success and interpersonal intimacy and, further, that this theme is “of potentially universal significance” insofar as the good girl / bad girl differentiated by hair color can be located in pairings as diverse as the Munro sisters in James Fennimore Cooper’s The Last of the Mohicans and Ginger and Mary-­Ann on Gilligan’s Island. I will dispute this reading later in this book with reference to the presentation of Betty (who, it seems to me, represents neither goodness nor pure love), but at this moment it is sufficient to observe that the broadly thematic analysis offered by Glasberg is remarkable as the only critical cultural analysis of Archie previously published. Alexis Tan and Kermit Joseph Scruggs’s 1980 Journalism Quarterly article “Does Exposure to Comic Book Violence Lead to Aggression in Children?” does not even offer a reading of the comics. Instead, the authors exposed two groups of children to comic books—­half read a single issue of Marvel’s Daredevil, while the other half read an issue of Betty and Veronica (selected for its lack of violent depictions)—­and they were then asked to take a survey that would measure their proclivity toward resolving fictitious problems through the use of physical violence. The results of this primitive media-­effects study are insignificant, other than to note that by 1980 Archie comics were generally synonymous with inoffensive comics. It is striking that so little scholarly work of any kind has been done on Archie. Having been published uninterrupted now for more than\n\nTh e Tw elve- ­C ent A rchie 5\n\nseventy years, the character himself is a household name. Until approximately 1974, his adventures were selling millions of copies per month, and he has been the subject of plays, films, television shows, and, of course, a series of hit pop songs. Archie is as American as apple pie, and the vast quantity of material produced about him might suggest that he would be the subject of endless inquiry. Yet scholarly study of comics, as it has developed in universities over the past quarter century, has tended to focus on those comics that best fit the literary scholarly traditions. Works with a single author, or to which a central authorship might be attributed in the case of collaborative works, have been strongly, indeed overwhelmingly, preferred. It should be no surprise, given the emphasis on literariness as the dominant criterion of value, that autobiographical works have been favored with attention that well exceeds the proportional place that they occupy in the field of production. Scholarly work focusing on the “popular,” on the other hand, has tended to concentrate attention on superhero characters, much of it increasingly driven by the same auteurist interests as exist in the study of so-­called alternative comics. Thus, auteurism has been the key to the cultural legitimacy of comic books, and it is no surprise that scholars trained in a literary tradition that is so strongly structured around an auteurist canon would transpose that tradition onto comics. In this way, the field of comics has simply sought to duplicate the canon-­erecting tendencies of the literary hierarchy in miniature within the comics field, transplanting everything that is wrong with that structure (its elitism, its narrow-­mindedness, its ideological blind spots) onto this new research area. A great deal of comics studies (and I will include my own work in these comments) has been an attempt to demonstrate that the marginalization of the form is misguided. Scholars have focused nearly exclusively on those works that can be most easily reconciled within the traditions of literary greatness (Art Spiegelman, Marjane Satrapi, Alison Bechdel) or those of contemporary cultural politics (studies of Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman). This cultural cherry-­picking has left enormous gaps in both the history and cultural analysis of comics. To my mind, the exclusion of the genuinely popular has obscured the actual history of the field. Arguments about the centrality of Marvel Comics in the 1960s fail to note that in 1967, at the height of the Stan Lee–­Jack Kirby collaboration on that title, sales of Fantastic Four\n\n6 T WE LVE - C ENT ARCH IE\n\nwere only a fraction of sales of Archie and trailed even Betty and Veronica. Arguments about the “mainstream” of American comic-­book publishing are all too often willfully blind, excluding children’s comics and humor comics in order to make an artificial argument about the cultural importance of superheroes and their centrality to the economics of the industry in a post–­Comics Code publishing period. Comics studies has rarely focused attention on the truly popular, opting instead for work that can be presented as groundbreaking—­ work that is formally innovative and inventive, that explores new expressive ground, and that tackles taboo themes or subjects. I would like to suggest, however, that in its blindness, comics studies has a long history of misunderstanding and misrepresenting the contributions of the past, particularly when those contributions can be found in genres that are out of favor—­such as the children’s humor comic. Archie comics in the 1960s were replete with the kinds of self-­referential formal play that is celebrated as avant-­garde when it was done by Art Spiegelman in the 1970s. Wordless comics, metareferential comics, and avant-­garde and abstract visual tendencies can all be found in Archie (and elsewhere) in the muck of the unserious comics industry of the 1960s, and our collective failure to account for these basic facts has been a detriment to scholarship. In this volume, I have attempted to right some of the scholarly wrongs done to Archie by addressing the works as both typical and exceptional. Rather than trying to deal with more than seventy years of comics publishing, and tens of thousands of comic-­book stories, I have deliberately opted to limit my study. As John Goldwater, Archie Comics editor and copublisher, was so instrumental in the implementation of the 1954 Comics Code, I had thought to begin there and to conclude with the creation of ABC’s hit television show Happy Days, which in many ways is a televisualization of the same material and whose debut coincided almost exactly with the collapse of Archie comics’ sales. As I began to research, however, it appeared to me that this selection was too broad. The most interesting period in Archie Comics publishing seemed to me to coincide with the long run of Harry Lucey as the lead artist on Archie, the arrival of Dan DeCarlo at the company and his work on Betty and Veronica, and Samm Schwartz’s art contributions to Jughead. To my mind, the team of Lucey, DeCarlo, and Schwartz was the comic-­book equivalent of Tinkers,\n\nTh e Tw elve- ­C ent A rchie 7\n\nEvers, and Chance, the renowned double-­play team for the Chicago Cubs of the nineteen-­teens—­they were the best at what they did, and their names are now the stuff of legend. While this trio overlapped for only a short period of time (Schwartz left Archie Comics in 1965 for Tower Comics), that time coincided nicely, but not exactly, with the period when Archie comics cost twelve cents. Archie Comics raised the per-­issue price from a dime in the comics cover-­dated December 1961 and held it there until raising it to fifteen cents in July 1969. This seven-­and-­a-­half-­year period corresponds with the peak years of the comics’ production. While strong work was done both before and after the twelve-­cent era, I have focused my attention on these books. This study is a reflection of my reading of every single Archie Comics comic published in those ninety months across all seventeen titles. Though I have been critical of auteurist tendencies in comics studies as needlessly obscurantist, I will note that in this volume I myself regularly fall into the trap that I have decried. Auteurism is a powerful and persuasive organizing system. As Michel Foucault argued in his 1977 essay “What Is an Author?,” the very creation of the concept of the “author” is the privileged moment in the history of literature, philosophy, and science; it is no less so in comics. In this volume, I have paid particular attention to the work of Harry Lucey, Dan DeCarlo, and Samm Schwartz. My attributions of their work have relied on a combination of factors, since none of their stories were formally credited at the time of publication. IDW has recently released eight volumes of The Best of . . . this trio of artists (four volumes of DeCarlo, two each for Schwartz and Lucey), and the indexes at The Great Comics Database have been helpful, if sadly incomplete. While I have only cited artists and writers in cases where I believe I have a high probability of having correctly identified their work, the likelihood of misattribution still exists, and I have very rarely attempted to identify the role played by inkers and letterers (and never colorists). Finally, as a glance at the table of contents is sufficient to demonstrate, this is not a typical scholarly monograph, just as Archie Comics was not a typical comics-­publishing enterprise. I have authored this book in such a way that I believe a reader could dip into any of its one hundred chapters in any order. Indeed, this volume was not written in the order that the chapters are arranged here. It is my hope that each chapter, like every Archie story, could exist independent of the rest, although the chapters are\n\n8 T WE LVE - C ENT ARCH IE\n\narranged deliberately, if not exactly chronologically. The most interesting thing about Archie comics, it seems to me, is their lack of continuity, their brevity, and their independent functioning within a larger narrative system. I have sought, in a small way, to take this as a model for my scholarship on the subject, allowing the work itself not only to dictate my readings but to suggest the very form of this book. I approached this volume with no predetermined theoretical or methodological orthodoxies. I had not read Archie comics in more than thirty years when I began this project, and I had little idea what I would find in their pages. At one point, I had hoped that the one hundred chapters of this volume would allow me to approach this corpus from every conceivable angle and using every appropriate model. In the novel Changing Places, David Lodge paints the image of Morris Zapp, a literary scholar who aspires to “a series of commentaries on Jane Austen which would work through the whole canon, one novel at a time, saying absolutely everything that could possibly be said about them. The idea was to be utterly exhaustive, to examine the novels from every conceivable angle, historical, biographical, rhetorical, mythical, Freudian, Jungian, existentialist, Marxist, structuralist, Christian-­allegorical, ethical, exponential, linguistic, phenomenological, archetypal, you name it; so that when each commentary was written there would be simply nothing further to say about the novel in question.” Like Zapp, I have failed in this goal. The truth is that I discovered in the Archie comics of the 1960s a level of complexity and interest that was entirely unexpected. With their complexities and contradictions, these comics may well be inexhaustible—­like all the best works of culture. Ultimately, I have relied on a combination of close readings contained within short, loosely connected chapters. My more modest goal has been to offer a scholarly version of the Archie textual digest, in which I hope to demonstrate the efficacy and cogency of the interrelated short-­story comics form as a significant alternative to graphic novels self-­ consciously modeled on literary parameters.\n\nHOW TO WRITE (ARCHIE) COMICS There can be absolutely no question that the Archie comics published in the twelve-­cent era were the product of a semi-­industrialized system.

Having, at the time, twenty years of previous publishing history\n\nHo w to W rite (A rch ie) Co mi cs 9\n\nto rely on for the development of characters and settings, and having a strict level of editorial oversight, Archie Comics was a well-­established entity. The comic books were highly conventionalized in terms of look, layout, and design. While individual artists occasionally stretched the limits of what was permissible and treated material with their own distinctive rendering styles, the goal of Archie Comics was not to produce a widely disparate set of stories but to provide readers with essentially the same material month after month, with only as much variation as would be required to keep them coming back for more. While it might be possible to imagine a somewhat distant future when Archie would graduate from Riverdale High, go to college, begin a career, marry Veronica (much to Betty’s consternation), live a full and meaningful life, even die, these were only imaginings. They were not plots to be developed (although some of them were by later generations of Archie Comics artists in the first decade of the twenty-­first century). Constancy was the key, and constancy required repetition, which required formulae. Moreover, formulae necessitated a system of production that endures beyond the terms of individual creators. It is, of course, one of the tasks of the literary or cultural critic to determine the underlying formulae that undergird an ongoing creative enterprise such as Archie Comics. It is necessary to plot certain vectors—­story length, character interaction, the rise and fall of dramatic tension—­in order to determine the core elements of the Archie narrative. It is the required labor of the critic to sort and to catalogue, to graph and to chart, and to report on the ideal form of the Archie story. Or it would be, had Frank Doyle and Harry Lucey not done that work already. In one of the most atypically typical of Archie stories, “How to Write Comics,” the lead story in Archie’s Pals ’n Gals 34 (Fall 1965), writer Frank Doyle and artist Harry Lucey present a five-­page story with no dialogue. All of the text is contained in the captions at the top of (almost) every panel. These captions demonstrate for the reader the entire operating system of the Archie machine. “Anytime,” Doyle tells us in the first panel, “you start your story with a combination of action and pretty girl you’re halfway home.” Under this caption, Lucey depicts Betty, falling off a skateboard and into the waiting arms of Archie. With this one panel, Doyle and Lucey\n\nFrank Doyle and Harry Lucey literalize the process of writing an Archie Comics story.

This combination of sex plus action (“kiss kiss bang bang” to use the title of Pauline Kael’s collection of criticism) also describes many of the world’s most popular entertainments. “Halfway through the tale,” we are told on the third page, “get everybody angry with everybody!” Here Lucey depicts Veronica angry at Archie for flirting with Betty, Archie angry at Veronica for flirting with a passing boy, and Betty angry at Archie because he is angry at Veronica, which, of course, only makes Veronica angry with Betty, once again. “And, of course, we need a villain!” Doyle says, adding Reggie to this already volatile mix. And while the villain is able to elude the heroes who pursue him, disaster strikes as Archie and the flirting stranger run headlong into each other in a typically Luceyan depiction of physical mayhem. With the heroes knocked out in a heap, Doyle concludes with this piece of advice: “Never forget that the villain must get his just desserts!” as Reggie unwittingly steps on Betty’s skateboard and knocks himself silly. With the boys all sprawled on the sidewalk seeing stars, Veronica raises her hands in mock surrender: “Don’t overdo the happy ending bit! Remember, variety is the spice of life!” Interestingly, in the Archie comics of the twelve-­cent era, variety was most assuredly not the spice of life. In story terms, the degree of repetition can be startling when one consumes large quantities of these comics all at once, and a genuinely innovative piece of writing—­ such as this—­is all too rare. Nonetheless, Doyle’s ability to enumerate the precise conventions of the successful Archie comic, from the introduction of a device (the skateboard) that promises impending doom to the deferral of the payoff on page 2, and from the gradual introduction of tension among the cast on page 3 to its amplification by the arrival of Reggie on page 4, demonstrates the knowing metafiction of the Archie structure, even while it ironizes it. It is an extremely clever story, and by crafting it so beautifully, Doyle and Lucey have saved me the task of writing it for them.\n\nSTORY LENGTH During the twelve-­cent period, stories about Archie appeared in almost every conceivable shape and size.

Typical issues contained twenty-­two\n\n12 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nor twenty-­three pages of comics material, two or three pages of text, and five or six advertisements, while Archie Annuals, Archie Giant Series, and Archie’s Pals ’n Gals typically ran to eighty pages in total. Normally, the comics material was broken down into four stories, with a lead story that was only six pages long. Longer stories, particularly in Life with Archie, were generally separated into two or four chapters, although a stand-­alone twelve-­page story can be found on very rare occasions (Betty and Veronica 153, September 1968, for example). Very occasionally a comic would be composed of a single story of more than twenty pages, although these tended to be more serious and adventure oriented than the shorter gag pieces that are the hallmark of the series. Two-­page stories were relatively common, and single and half-­page gags were more frequent still. Splash-­page-­sized gags and pinups were a particular specialization of artist Dan DeCarlo. Archie, it seemed, was a story-­ generating system that could be shaped to virtually any length necessary to fill the page of the magazines. While the six-­page story is the norm in Archie comics against which pieces of other lengths are contrasted, seemingly the only absolute editorial prohibition during the 1960s was against stories that continued in another issue entirely. All Archie stories in the twelve-­cent era were entirely self-­contained in the magazine in which they appeared.\n\nTHE ARCHIE HIERARCHY Unlike many other successful comic-­book franchises of the postwar period, the twelve-­cent Archie era was not defined merely by the success of a single title. In the period from the end of 1961 to the middle of 1969, Archie Comics produced seventeen ongoing monthly, bimonthly, and quarterly titles devoted to the gang at Riverdale High, as well as a number of short-­lived titles featuring the same characters. Archie made his debut in Pep Comics 22 (December 1941), a sixty-­ four-­page anthology comic featuring the adventures of the patriotic superhero The Shield as the lead feature. Pep contained backups that included The Hangman, Danny in Wonderland, Sergeant Boyle, Jolly Roger and His Sky Pirates, Kayo Ward, and Bentley of Scotland Yard.

Pep contained backups that included The Hangman, Danny in Wonderland, Sergeant Boyle, Jolly Roger and His Sky Pirates, Kayo Ward, and Bentley of Scotland Yard. When Archie was introduced as “America’s newest boyfriend,” it was as a back-­pages feature about a teenager who hates the name Archie\n\nTh e A rch ie Hie rarch y 13\n\n(“call him ‘Chick’”) and whose debut misadventures revolved around his attempts to impress his new neighbor, Betty Cooper. In the dozen issues that followed his introduction, Archie remained a backup story in the anthology title, only appearing on the cover (jointly with The Shield) for the first time on the thirty-­sixth issue. He began sharing the cover with The Shield from issue 41, gradually displacing him altogether. Nonetheless, Pep remained an anthology comic until the mid-­ 1960s, and the superhero adventures of The Fly helped fill its pages even during the twelve-­cent period. Archie, the comic-­book title, was spun off from Pep in 1942, less than a year after the character made his first appearance. Archie remained the flagship title in the series throughout the 1960s, and it was always the best selling of numerous Riverdale books, averaging more than 450,000 copies sold per month during the 1960s and peaking in 1968 at more than 566,000. The tandem of writer Frank Doyle and artist Harry Lucey dominated the title throughout this period. Lucey was known for the amazing pliability of his characters and the variability of his poses. He was a dynamic cartoonist who stressed the sexiness of Betty and Veronica, while playing the expressive antics of Archie, Reggie, and, particularly, Mr. Lodge to their fullest. Doyle produced many of the most memorable Archie stories during this period and kept his stories more grounded in the reality of day-­to-­day life in Riverdale than did many of his peers. While Archie began appearing in a second anthology title, Laugh, in 1946 alongside features such as Katie Keene, the first genuine spin-­ off among the Archie titles was Archie’s Pal Jughead in 1949. Jughead had been introduced in the first Archie story in Pep Comics 22 and quickly emerged as the most popular supporting character. Over the course of the 1960s, he was given several additional titles, including the unfortunately short-­lived Jughead’s Fantasy (which featured full-­ length fantasy adventures for only three issues in 1960) and Jughead’s Jokes (1967). The flagship Jughead title (which shortened its name in November 1965) was drawn by Samm Schwartz until issue 126 (November 1965), when the artist left Archie Comics to produce the knockoff Tippy Teen for Tower Comics. Schwartz was the defining Jughead artist during this period, and the title floundered creatively under his replacement, Bill Vigoda, until Schwartz returned in 1969. Archie’s Girls Betty and Veronica was launched in 1950, a year after\n\n14 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nJughead received his own title. While Archie comics were always popular with a young female audience, this title heightened that appeal with its emphasis on the female costars, and it quickly emerged as the second-­most-­popular title behind Archie, averaging well over three hundred thousand copies sold per month. Dan DeCarlo was the predominant artist on the title during the twelve-­cent period (often working on stories written by Frank Doyle), and he emerged as the dominant in-­house Archie Comics stylist as the decade progressed. Late in the 1960s, DeCarlo produced the majority of Archie covers, even on titles that were drawn by Lucey or Schwartz. Eventually DeCarlo became the best known of the Archie artists, and he came to define the house style to such a degree that other artists were encouraged to draw like him. Having established the five core Archie titles in the 1940s—­Archie, Pep, Laugh, Jughead, and Betty and Veronica—­Archie Comics continued to add new titles at the rate of almost one per year in the decade that followed. The bonus-­sized Archie’s Pals ’n Gals was launched in 1952, and Archie’s Joke Book (which frequently recycled material from Bob Montana’s syndicated newspaper strip) followed a year later. A second oversized title, Archie Giant Series, was launched in 1954 as a series of rotating one-­shots not unlike Dell’s Four Color series. In 1956, Bob Bolling’s Little Archie debuted, presenting the young childhood adventures of the cast (this was joined by the extremely short-­lived Little Archie Mystery for two issues in 1963). Life with Archie, which featured longer stories, was released in 1958. The success of Mad Magazine led to the creation of Archie’s Madhouse in 1959, although the main Archie cast only appeared in gags found in the earliest issues before the title evolved into a place for non-­Riverdale absurd humor. Archie Comics took a break from developing new titles until the mid-­1960s. The year 1964 saw the creation of Archie and Me, which focused, perhaps unexpectedly, on Mr. Weatherbee as the “me” of the title. The following year, Betty received her own title (Betty and Me), and the year after that, Reggie received his third title. Reggie was a consistent failure in the marketplace. Archie’s Rival Reggie had debuted in 1949, around the same time that Jughead was given his own title, but Reggie’s series lasted only fourteen issues. In 1963, Archie Comics tried again with Reggie, but this time only four issues were produced; and then in 1966, Reggie and Me became a success, running until 1980. In 1968, the similarly long-­running Reggie’s (Wise Guy) Jokes debuted,\n\nTh e A rch ie Hie rarch y 15\n\nas part of the expansion of the gag-­book formula that also included Jughead’s Jokes and Archie’s Joke Book. Additionally, three superhero titles featuring the Archie gang were developed in 1966 and 1967—­Archie as Pureheart the Powerful, Archie as Captain Pureheart, and Jughead as Captain Hero—­but they only lasted sixteen issues collectively. In May 1969, the oversized Everything’s Archie debuted as a tie-­in to the newly developed television program and The Archies records. In addition to the almost two-­dozen Riverdale titles that composed the twelve-­cent period, Archie Comics produced the adventures of Josie (and, later, the Pussycats). Josie had debuted in Archie’s Pals ’n Gals and regularly appeared in both Laugh and Pep. Her adventures occasionally crossed over into the Archie universe. Archie Comics also released its own semiknockoffs, Wilbur Comics and That Wilkin Boy, both of which had only tangential connections to the Riverdale stories during this time frame. It is significant that while Veronica shared a title with Betty throughout the twelve-­cent era, no title was ever specifically developed for her (she only received her own magazine in 1989). For a company that developed a title expressly to showcase the exploits of a high school principal to have ignored the character who is, arguably, the second-­ most-­important player in the Archie cast seems indicative of the way that the Archie-­Betty-­Veronica love triangle was understood by readers. While the Archie titles of the 1960s are at pains to establish the lopsided nature of this triangle by repeatedly suggesting that Archie and Veronica are a semidevoted couple that Betty is at pains to break up, the girl next door is, nonetheless, the one for whom a title was developed. Veronica, the child of privilege, too regularly plays the role of a bully to be an effective heroine, and much as Reggie’s titles struggled to find ways to make him both funny and sympathetic (eventually giving up: Reggie’s (Wise Guy) Jokes might as well have been called Jokes Too Mean-­Spirited for the Regular Archie Titles). The constantly put-­upon Betty, the sympathetic heroine, is the one who can carry her own title, and this realization helps push the love triangle onto more equal footing as the years pass. The sales success of Betty and Me is indicative of her popularity and, thus, the necessity of balancing her relationship with Archie and with Veronica, a process that begins slowly in the late 1960s before accelerating in the 1970s and emerging as a dominant aspect of the Archie story lines from the 1980s onward.\n\n16 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nThe hierarchy of the Archie titles (with Archie, Betty and Veronica, and Jughead—­until Schwartz’s departure—­at the top) reflects the hierarchy of the cast in the less central titles such as Laugh, Pep, and Archie’s Pals ’n Gals. Archie, of course, is almost always the dominant character in stories that include all or most of the cast. Only in Jughead are there consistently stories in which he does not appear (although these are uncommon). Betty and Veronica are the key supporting characters, ahead of Jughead (except in his own title) and well ahead of Reggie. Reggie is, at best, a minor major character, who cannot be counted on to appear in every story or even in most of them. He is, by far, the character that is most frequently not included among the core cast. Of the supporting characters, only Mr. Weatherbee ever warranted his own title (and, even then, not under his own name), although Mr. Lodge is by far the most frequently appearing character outside of the core five. He is the major minor character, particularly in the pages of Archie and Betty and Veronica, where he can be found in at least one story in every issue and usually more. Moose, Midge, Dilton, Big Ethel, and the rest of the cast are little more than occasional bit players who were apparently never considered for their own titles and, in the 1960s, were rarely even the lead characters of individual stories. Despite the obvious hierarchy that existed among the titles, it is difficult to assess any of them as absolutely central. Archie was the most venerable and, by a wide margin, the best selling, while Betty and Veronica and then Jughead trailed behind. Pals ’n Gals, Giant, Pep, Life with Archie, and Laugh consistently sold about 250,000 copies per month, with only Little Archie regularly falling below the 200,000 mark. As there was no continuity in the Archie titles of this period, it was in no way necessary for readers of one title to read any of the others, so while there was a hierarchy of importance and also one of sales, the actual effects of this structure had little or no impact on readers, who were free to move among the titles at will.\n\nARCHIE ANDREWS Archie Andrews is an atypical comic-­book protagonist.

He is a young man to whom things happen; he is not someone who makes things happen. Only rarely is he the central actor in any of the plots in which\n\nA rch ie An dr ew s 17\n\nhe is involved. Only on occasion is he the character who takes the first action. In character terms, he is actually little more than a cipher—­a blank space on which stories are written. A high school junior, Archie is the quintessential everyman—­the typical American teen. Early in the twelve-­ cent era, he is distinguished by his orange checked pants, green bow tie, and black sweater vest emblazoned with the Riverdale R, which he wears Archie Andrews, wearing his traditional everywhere unless the story specifiRiverdale High sweater vest. From Archie 142 (1963). cally calls for different clothing—­at a formal dance, for instance, or at the beach. Once he gives up his trademark getup in the mid-­1960s, his most distinctive trait becomes his orange hair, a “warm crimson thatch turning to a roseate peony on the sides,” as it is described by a casting agent in Laugh 205 (April 1968). The Andrewses live on Elm Street in the anyplace town of Riverdale, the product of a typical middle-­class professional family. Archie might have been notable in his era as an only child in a nuclear family, were it not for the fact that everyone in Riverdale is an only child—­it is a town curiously devoid of siblings. Interest in Archie derives from his few defining characteristics. He is in love with Veronica but will date other girls, including Betty, when the opportunity arises. He is a good student or a bad student, a strong athlete or a poor one, nimble and agile or clumsy and maladroit, all depending on the particular needs of any given story. The trappings that surround him—­his parents, his friends, his car—­are all more thoroughly consistent than he is, and all are more commonly used as story prompts. The most common depiction of Archie is as a teenager who is always in need of additional funds. Archie has no regular after-­school or summer job, although his decision to find employment is a common story line. Dating the spectacularly wealthy Veronica is consistently damaging to his wallet, and consecutive stories find him struggling for money. For instance, over the course of a three-­issue stretch of the flagship title in 1968, Archie’s cash problems become\n\n18 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\na running theme. In “Money Makes the Scene” (Archie 181, April 1968), Archie lacks the three dollars that will buy him entry into the local discotheque, so he takes a job setting up the lights, which earns him free admission (and a scolding from Veronica when he inevitably fouls up the job). In “All Work and No Pay” (Archie 182, June 1968), Archie finds free passes to the very same discotheque (“Why! That saves three dollars a person admission!” says Betty) but is under pressure to generate the additional cash required to treat Veronica to the first-­class date that she expects. Again he takes a job in the disco during the day, this time lugging refreshments, only to discover that he cannot cash in his free passes because they are not valid for employees. In “Work It Off ” (Archie 183, July 1968), Archie refuses to take a loan from Veronica (“I’ve got pride!” says Archie. “But you don’t got money!” replies Veronica) so that they can attend the dance, but he takes an advance from Pop at the Choklit Shoppe so that he can attend (of course, Pop requires him to work at the same time as the dance). Three issues later, in “Root of All Evil” (Archie 186, November 1968), Veronica works to cure Archie’s money problems once and for all. Recognizing that he is too proud to accept her charity, she strategically hides cash all over Riverdale in places that he would be likely to discover it, in the hope that she can pay for her own date. Of course, even this plan backfires, as Archie becomes obsessed with the money that he has found, hiding alone in his room in the dark rummaging through his new piles of cash. Archie’s need for money is not so much a character trait as it is a prompt for a series of ongoing stories. Unhappy when he is without money because he cannot date Veronica, he is unhappy when he has money because his working life leaves him unable to date Veronica. His is the central paradox of the privileged middle class. Stories do not begin from a flaw in Archie’s character but are situational. He needs money only when the story needs him to need money—­it is not intrinsic to his characterization, and at times when the writers have other plans for him, he is always flush. Archie himself is not a particularly generative character, but he is a fundamentally useful one: he is the lovable, affable, cheerful doofus to whom things happen, a vessel for all kinds of misadventures. Fundamentally, Archie Comics’ creators are spared the challenge of developing him any more fully than he already is.\n\nHo w We ll Does A rch ie Spe ak F r en ch ? 19\n\nHOW WELL DOES ARCHIE SPEAK FRENCH? One of the central attributes of the Archie stories is that they are entirely free of narrative continuity, allowing elements that might seem counterfactual in one story to take center stage in another. For instance, Archie’s scholastic abilities shift according to the needs of any particular story. In Betty and Veronica 135 (March 1967), both Betty and Archie win scholastic prizes (she for math, he for history), and Veronica calls him a “brain”; but in Jughead 86 (July 1962), he scores a zero on an English exam that both Betty and Veronica ace. Most typically, in Archie 138 (July 1963), he is identified as a C student in contrast to Betty, the A student. What then is to be made of the story “Tongue Twister” in Archie Annual (1967)? The piece opens with Veronica and Reggie berating Archie for receiving a score of one hundred on a French test. “It’s not,” Veronica sniffs, “a required subject! I plan my social calendar during French class!” Later, at the Choklit Shoppe, Veronica and Reggie are incapable of helping a crying young girl when they realize that she is speaking French (“After ‘Toujours l’amour’ and ‘Chevrolet Coupe’ I’m speechless!” says Reggie). When Archie arrives on the scene, he comforts the girl, returns her to her father—­the French ambassador who is in Riverdale for some completely undetermined reason—­and earns a trip to Paris, where he will be wined and dined. As Archie poses for the media, and Reggie and Veronica turn to their French-­ English dictionary (“. . . Sot! . . . Fou! . . .

How might we explain this unusual fact? Was there a particular explosion of public interest in\n\n20 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nbowling in 1962? Was bowling the topic of hit films or television series? The answer to both of these questions would be no. The simplest explanation might be the most appropriate—­stories about Archie bowling just seemed to write themselves. If we begin from a presumption that the Archie writers were required to produce a large quantity of stories about the Riverdale gang in a very short period of time, it would seem logical that certain story prompts might appear to be more productive of the creation of punch lines than others. Given a very limited set of character types, writers needed to develop situations in which certain predictable results would be generated. Archie Comics of the 1960s was, in effect, a machine for the creation of humorous stories that were grounded in the possibilities of everyday life in middle America, taken to certain logical or narrative extremes. Postulate an unusual object or setting, insert the characters into it, and, because they were so well established and relatively fixed in their uses, a plot instantly suggests itself. That Doyle should string a series of bowling stories together in relatively close proximity likely tells us something about his working methods. Imagine a notebook with story prompts and the word “Bowling” written at the top of a page. If one ruminates for only a few moments on the possibilities raised by the popular leisure activity, several stories might immediately spring to mind. The combination of the clumsily unlucky Archie and a bowling ball at Riverdale High leads almost automatically to several promising sight gags—­ Mr. Weatherbee hit by the ball, the ball rolling into the chemistry lab and causing an explosion, the ball falling from a top shelf in Archie’s locker. Similarly, the suggestion of Archie teaching Betty and Veronica how to bowl leads to a different (but related) series of sight gags, including the ball being dropped on Archie’s foot, a stray ball causing damage at the lanes, and a ball crushing Archie’s hand. To paraphrase Anton Chekhov, if a bowling ball is shown on the first page, it must be dropped on someone’s foot on the final page, because in the world of Archie, any newly introduced element necessarily suggests its own outcome—­if it is breakable, it will be broken; if it is round, it will be tripped over. Bowling is such a natural story prompt because it contains the essential element required of all Archie stories—­the promise of controlled chaos. If the Archie comics are a story-­generating machine, one important\n\nH arr y Lu cey ’s R h yt hm 21\n\nelement to note is that it is a machine that can be endlessly reset. Since the comics lack any real sense of continuity, any given character may be a great bowler one day and a complete novice the next. In Archie 122 (September 1961), Archie and Reggie teach the girls how to bowl, and they are completely incapable—­dropping a ball on Reggie’s foot and smashing Archie’s hand in the ball return, just as any reader may have imagined, while in Betty and Veronica 139 (July 1967), Betty is an expert bowler and in Archie’s Pals ’n Gals 28 (Spring 1964), she is significantly better at the game than is Archie. As all Archie stories exist independently of all other Archie stories (at least in terms of continuity), this is not a case of Betty having improved her skills over time—­it is a reflection of the fact that different stories have different needs, and if it is narratively useful to have Betty excel at a sport, it is just as easy as having her fail at it. Archie’s creators in the 1960s were not interested in expressing the truth of their characters or in the inconsistencies that varying stories would produce. Rather, they were concerned with spinning out an endless stream of content that remained true to the spirit of the Archie universe. Story logics are circumstantial, and they stem from the collision of characters that retain a roughly fixed form with an endlessly generative series of new story prompts that can be infinitely recycled until they have been exhausted of comic potential.\n\nHARRY LUCEY’S RHYTHM As far as I am concerned, Harry Lucey was the greatest Archie artist of the twelve-­cent period or of any other period. As the lead artist on the flagship Archie title for the entire 1960s and into the 1970s, not only did he create, with writer Frank Doyle, the most memorable Archie stories, but he crafted the definitive look and style for many of the characters. While the best Jughead will always be that of Samm Schwartz, the best everyone else is almost always Harry Lucey. His Betty and Veronica were the most alluring and his Archie the most elastic. His characterizations were rooted in a comic-­book aesthetic that owed a great deal to the physics of animation. His characters did not take simple pratfalls but were propelled through the air with tremendous violence. One of the great masters of comic-­book storytelling through body language, Lucey was seemingly incapable of drawing a meaning-\n\nH arr y Lu cey ’s R h yt hm 21\n\nelement to note is that it is a machine that can be endlessly reset.

One of the great masters of comic-­book storytelling through body language, Lucey was seemingly incapable of drawing a meaning-\n\n22 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nless pose. The least effective Archie artists allowed a rote neutrality to enter into the body language of the cast, as if each character was constantly at rest, relying on the dialogue—­often the weakest part of any Archie story—­to carry the humor. Not Lucey. No opportunity to tell a story through body language was ever lost to him. His characters were dynamic and fluid—­when they rested, he drew them actively at rest. Lucey could have made a career simply out of drawing Veronica’s father. The silver-­haired Mr. Lodge, constantly set upon by Archie, is a tremendous comic foil, and Lucey played him for all he was worth. A simple five-­page story, “The Patient” (Archie’s Pals ’n Gals 42, October 1967), demonstrates the skills that Lucey was able to bring to even the slightest Archie story. “The Patient” is ostensibly the story of Archie repeatedly injuring himself at the Lodges’—­he skins his knee after tripping on a garden hose, and Veronica overreacts, dressing herself in a nurse’s uniform and Smithers as a surgeon. The heart of the piece is the reactions of Mr. Lodge. The genius of the piece lies in Lucey’s ability to carry that character through a rising and falling series of rage incidents. Across the five pages of the story, Mr. Lodge is depicted in twenty-­ one of the story’s twenty-­four panels. He is absent from the half-­ splash that opens the story (Archie trips on the hose, Veronica calls for Smithers to help) and is almost hidden in the only other first-­page panel, standing in the doorway as Archie is ushered into the house on a stretcher by Veronica and Smithers. Here we are given Mr. Lodge at rest, a surprised look on his face and a bend to his knees that makes the drawing lively and that echoes Archie’s pose on the stretcher, creating a slight equivalence between the two that suggests where the story is headed. The second page is a classic six-­panel grid (three tiers of two panels), the most common Archie page layout throughout the 1960s. Mr. Lodge appears in every panel. The first two panels are rests, though the first is more animated than the second. Mr. Lodge displays annoyance at the disruptive intrusion and complains about Veronica’s nursing fixation (“Since you got this nursing bug, this place looks like a hospital!”). The third panel is the payoff for the controlled annoyance of the first two—­as Veronica emerges in her nurse’s outfit, her exasperated father smacks his head in frustration. The rightward lean of his body carries the reader in the fourth panel, in which he storms\n\nThe rhythmic patterning of Mr. Lodge losing his mind. From Archie’s Pals ’n Gals 42 (1967).\n\n24 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nthrough the house in a Y-­shaped rage, his arms flung out to his sides, his head pointed toward the heavens. Here Lucey beautifully echoes Doyle’s dialogue, as the overreacting Mr. Lodge screams, “Extremes! Extremes! She never does anything in moderation!” The next panel, with Mr. Lodge in a full rage, pounding on his desk, sets up the final punch line on the page, the forward-­thrusting expression of shocked disbelief when Smithers enters the office in a full surgical gown and mask. Paying attention only to Mr. Lodge, the second page begins from a place of emotional calm and moves through three panels of escalating anger, only to be deflated by an expression of incredulity. Like the second page, page 3 is a six-­panel grid. Fuming now, Mr. Lodge storms out of his office in one of Lucey’s trademark depictions: shoulders hunched, arms straight downward, fists balled, a knee high to the chest, anger radiating in waves. This stomping is followed by a fist-­shaking exit (a pose commonly used by Dan DeCarlo for Mr. Lodge) and then a dramatic trip over Veronica’s oxygen tanks, which propels his body into a full diagonal fall. It is the fall that releases the dramatic tension established in the first two panels and on the previous page. The fourth panel depicts Mr. Lodge prostrate on the ground, incredulous—­a half rest. The fifth panel is the flip side of the second, Mr. Lodge passing through a door with his fists shaking above his head—­in musical terms, it is the same note struck a second time. The final image is another rest, as Mr. Lodge turns wide-­eyed to face the reader, caught off guard by Archie’s emotional outburst. It is the knowing, self-­referential look that is so common to acting. The third page, therefore, with its alternation of rages and rests is the deescalation of Mr. Lodge’s anger that builds to the look that he shares with the readers. The fourth page necessarily has to wind Mr. Lodge back up. It opens with a pensive pose, Mr. Lodge reflecting on the moment that he has shared with Archie, stroking his chin. His sudden realization that Archie is wearing his robe sets him in motion—­a dramatic pointing gesture that threatens to knock the boy backward and out of the panel. In the third panel, we return to the straight-­armed, shoulder-­ hunched, fist-­balled fuming of the previous page. With Mr. Lodge back at his desk, all is calm in the fourth panel, but the fifth, and final, panel echoes the final panel of page 2—­the shocked forward momentum of Mr. Lodge rising from his seat in disbelief, this time as Archie\n\nH arr y Lu cey ’s R h yt hm 25\n\narrives in his office on a golf cart. This page allows the drama to abate so that it might be paid off at the end. The fifth and final page is an explosion of bodies. Mr. Lodge spikes his pen in a contortion of rage in the first panel and chases Archie from his house in a dramatic diagonal motion in the second. He is absent from the second tier, which depicts Archie once again tripping over the garden hose, and in the final page-­width panel at the bottom of the page, he fumes as Archie beats a hasty retreat—­his knees, as in the first image of him from page 1, slightly bent, but this time with his fists balled at his side. Focusing exclusively on Mr. Lodge, “The Patient” depicts a rise, fall, and rise of anger that concludes with a dynamic explosion of rage. In Lucey’s twenty-­one drawings of Mr. Lodge, he repeats Mr. Lodge’s pose only once—­and even that one instance is for dramatic effect, and he reverses the framing (the first depiction is of Mr. Lodge storming out of a room; the second shows him storming into another). Other poses slyly echo prior iterations of the character to provide uniformity across the length of the short story. No drawing of Mr. Lodge is wasted, and no opportunity to bring vitality and humor to his poses is passed up. Not every drawing of Mr. Lodge is inherently funny, but each page (except the first) provides at least one drawing in which Mr. Lodge’s body language is the punch line of a gag, and the third page contains two. Indeed, page 3, which opens with foot-­stomping rage and concludes with the knowing glance at the reader, is a marvel of layout and composition. Punch-­line drawings of Mr. Lodge appear in the first and sixth panels, Lucey provides echoing reverses in the second and fifth panels, and the third and fourth panels, which compose the middle tier, place him in a pair of horizontal poses that effectively bifurcate the page top and bottom. The entire page is a series of mirrors: the second panel and the fifth panel in particular are direct inversions of each other, as are the third and fourth panels. The humor of the first and sixth panels, which share a much more subtle mirroring, is amplified by the overall mise-­en-­page. In particular, the dramatic diagonal trajectory of Mr. Lodge’s leg in the first panel and his flailing arm in the third visually point to the stunned quietude of his facial expression in the sixth and final image on this page. Everything on the page works to pay off that particular sight gag. Of course, Mr. Lodge is not the sole character in the story. Attention\n\n26 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\ncan be paid to the variety of Veronica’s poses—­the arms akimbo running after Archie, the single raised finger that dismisses her father’s concerns, her careful concern for Archie’s well-­being, and the tremendous final drawing of her calling for Smithers a second time. Similarly, Archie’s pratfalls and dynamic running carry a great deal of humor as well. In the hands of a cartooning master such as Harry Lucey, we are reminded that comics have much more in common with the visual arts than they do with literature. As a story, “The Patient” is unbelievably minor. As a support for Lucey’s compositions, it is a marvel to behold.\n\nVERONICA LODGE Like most of the other characters in Riverdale, Veronica Lodge is a mixture of character traits that are consistent and intrinsic to her portrayal (her wealth, most notably) and those that come and go depending on the needs of any given story. In Archie 165 (July 1966), for example, it is made clear that Veronica is a terrible cook, unable even to boil water. The same characterization can be found in a wide range of stories in the pages of Archie comics, but when she is called on to cook fudge in Betty and Veronica 105 (September 1964), she does so completely without incident (“Oh there’s nothing like a batch of fudge, to give a boy that final nudge,” she sings to herself as she prepares it). As the ability to cook is not central to her characterization at any given time, her proficiency comes and goes according to the whims of the creators. Other attributes are much more constant. Central to the portrayal of Veronica is her romantic relationship with Archie. In Betty and Veronica 76 (April 1962), Veronica realizes that she has the actual power to control Archie with the movement of her finger (“It must be that we’ve been close for so long! We’ve established some sort of mental telepathy between us!”)—­when she bends it, he bends; when she drums it on the tabletop, he bashes his head against the table. This power is never referred to again, of course, but it is a central metaphor in the depiction of their relationship as fundamentally one-­sided. In Archie 172 (April 1967), Archie is unable to stand up to Veronica when he is angry with her, because, as Jughead points out, “she has you too tightly wrapped around her finger,” and in the\n\n26 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\ncan be paid to the variety of Veronica’s poses—­the arms akimbo running after Archie, the single raised finger that dismisses her father’s concerns, her careful concern for Archie’s well-­being, and the tremendous final drawing of her calling for Smithers a second time.

Veronica is described by Archie as very possessive (“she’s even jealous of Jughead!” he tells Betty), and Betty tells Veronica in Betty and Veronica 88 (April 1963), “you treat him like a piece of cake Veronica Lodge, reluctant good girl. that you’re saving for a late snack!” The From Archie 187 (1968). asymmetrical nature of Veronica’s relationship to Archie—­he must always pursue her; she never has but to wave her finger in order to compel his presence at her side—­is crucial to the ongoing depiction of Veronica as coldly aloof and slightly cruel. This aspect of Veronica’s character is considerably heightened by her relationship to her best—­and often only—­friend, Betty Cooper. The essence of Veronica’s relationship to Betty is her disdain for her. Consider, for example, a scene in Life with Archie 84 (April 1969) in which Veronica complains that her father’s actions—­once again throwing Archie out of his house—­have cost her a date with Archie: Veronica: Oh Daddy, how could you? Now you’ve driven him right into the arms of that washed out blonde! Mr. Lodge: What washed out blonde? Veronica: My best friend, Betty, of course! How many washed out blondes do I know? Veronica’s central problem is that she hates the only friend that she has. Though she is immeasurably rich and Betty has comparatively little, Veronica conspires to destroy Betty’s new dresses whenever she buys or, more commonly, makes one. In Betty and Veronica 125 (May 1966), Veronica “accidentally” spills lemonade on Betty’s dress before her big date with Archie, and in the very next issue, she spills hot chocolate on Betty for the very same reason. The dress despoiling is such a recurrent theme involving Veronica that it was parodied in Betty and Veronica 126’s “Double Oh Lodge” (June 1966), in which Veronica\n\n28 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nis portrayed as having an elaborate computerized spy network whose sole purpose seems to be to destroy Betty’s clothing. Sending out commands to her henchmen by radio, her efforts to thwart Betty’s happiness are undermined by a mole in her operation—­her own father, who has provided Betty and Archie with the tools required to combat his daughter (“It’s not good for the balance of power if one side gets too strong!”). That Mr. Lodge is compelled to undermine his own daughter is indicative of the fact that in many of the Archie stories, Veronica is presented exclusively as a spoiled heiress. Her negative attitude is perfectly captured by the title “Devil Woman” (Betty and Veronica 105, September 1964), in which we learn that her only goal for a school day is to ruin everyone else’s day: she wears a new cashmere sweater only to make Betty feel self-­conscious for wearing simulated cashmere (“It’s nice of Betty to help me decide what to wear every morning,” she thinks to herself); when she spies Archie (“My own dear lover boy!” she thinks), she immediately asks Reggie to walk her to class so as to enrage him; she ruins Jughead’s lunch, and she sics Moose onto Reggie, all to please her own vanity and her own ego. Veronica’s character flaws stem from her outrageous wealth. As she herself explains to Betty in “Battle Lines” (Betty and Veronica 144, December 1967), “I’m rich! You’re poor! That makes me better than you!” The sheer scope of her wealth is depicted in Betty and Veronica 150 (June 1968), as she walks distractedly through her house, filled with its cinema, world-­class gymnasium, and indoor swimming pool, all of which leave her feeling unhappy and unfulfilled. The same story is essentially told again only two issues later, when Betty is given a tour of Lodge Manor when she comes to sleep over for the night (“You know, I think your room is the same distance from the stairs as my room is to Philadelphia,” Betty complains). It is the money that is the root of all of Veronica’s pathologies. In “The Men behind the Woman” (Laugh 200, November 1967), we learn that Veronica has an army of coaches and other professionals on constant hire to train her to be better than all of her friends at anything and everything. All of the traits essential to the characterization of Veronica—­the hypercontrolling attitude, the intolerance of others, and her desire to win at all costs—­are shorthand for the spoiled heiress that she is. Her atypicality is both a function of class privilege in a fictional\n\nRi v erdal e, US A 29\n\nworld in which class otherwise does not exist and an indictment of that privilege at a time when middle-­class privilege was beginning to be naturalized for the first time. Veronica is the residual product of a backward time in American culture before the golden age of bucolic suburbanism. That Betty is more popular with readers than Veronica is a reflection of the shift from the unattainable-­goddess version of American womanhood that was common to the popular culture of the Depression era to the all-­American girl next door that supplanted it in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nRIVERDALE, USA Where is Riverdale? When a television show produces a program depicting life “inside teen-­age America” in Life with Archie 23 (October 1963), newscaster Hink Brinkley tells his viewers, “We travelled from north to south . . . from east to west . . . To find a typical community . . . and in that community, a typical teen-­ager! And finally we found it . . . Riverdale, U.S.A.!” while in “Dullsville” (Archie 153, March 1965), Archie bemoans the fact that “nothing ever happens in Riverdale!” an observation that is belied by the events of the story (which occur unnoticed by our titular lead) as well as by the cumulative events that structure the Archie series as a whole. Like Springfield in The Simpsons, Riverdale is the product of no particular state in the Union. When the gang takes a field trip to the United Nations building in New York (Archie Giant Series 29, December 1964), it is only a three-­hour drive, while at other times, New York is a destination to which they have to fly (for example, Archie and Me 14, April 1967). Founded by General Mossbunker (Betty and Veronica 126, June 1966), Riverdale is a medium-­sized city or perhaps a suburb of a larger city. Like most things in Archie comics, the facts about it cannot be easily reconciled. It is clear that Riverdale is located in a region that has four distinct seasons ranging from the very warm in the summer to extremely snowy in the winter. Indeed, it must be in a snow belt given the enormous piles of snow accumulation that are regularly featured in winter-­set stories. It is on or extremely proximate to the ocean, because the gang frequently drives to La Goona Beach to go swimming and surfing. It is also on a lake, as the Lodges have a lake\n\nRi v erdal e, US A 29\n\nworld in which class otherwise does not exist and an indictment of that privilege at a time when middle-­class privilege was beginning to be naturalized for the first time.

It is also on a lake, as the Lodges have a lake\n\n30 T W E LVE- C ENT ARCH IE\n\nhouse where they store their various boats. That lake is possibly connected to the river that gives the town its name. Surprisingly, given the name Riverdale, the river is not an important landmark, and, indeed, it is only very occasionally mentioned and even more rarely depicted. It cannot be a very important river, as it is never named and, as we learn in Betty and Veronica 159 (March 1969), it is not dammed. The town is alternately surrounded by vast forests, by farmland, by rolling hills, and by mountains. Indeed, a ski hill is located close to the town, perhaps no further than the beach. The town does have an airport or is at least close to one in a neighboring city, as the gang frequently flies away for exotic adventures. Riverdale, apparently, has no churches, or at least none of them are ever depicted in the stories featured in the twelve-­cent era. The key to the narrative functioning of Riverdale is not the idea that it might be an actual place but rather that it could be any place. The few attempts to depict maps of the town are completely contradictory, and the distance between any two points—­say, Archie’s house and Veronica’s house—­is constantly shifting. Does Archie need to pass by Veronica’s on his way to Riverdale High? It depends on the needs of the story. Neither the architecture nor the urban plan is fixed in any way. In his 1887 book Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies defined Gemeinschaft as a society in which social ties are bound by personal relationships and simple social structures, where direct loyalty outweighs the indirect social control of governmental institutions. This is precisely the case in Riverdale. In Gemeinschaft, the town is an extension of the family, a space in which everyone is known to everyone else, and behavior is regulated in that way. Thus, when Hink Brinkley looks for the typical American teen in the typical American town, even strangers on the street are able to recommend Archie Andrews to him, because everyone is familiar with the boy and his antics. Socially, Riverdale is exceptionally homogeneous. There are virtually no people of color in the entire town and very few who are not at least middle class. While stratification does exist in class terms—­a point is repeatedly made that the Andrewses do not belong to the same country club as do the Lodges and the Mantles—­ there are only upper-­and middle-­class individuals in Riverdale. While laborers are shown to exist in Riverdale, it is not clear that they actually live there. In most ways, Riverdale is the bucolic suburban utopia\n\nTh e D a i ly St rip 31\n\nof the 1960s, in which social divisions—­particularly those brought about by racial difference—­do not exist. Riverdale in the 1960s was a wish-­dream of white privilege and normative sexualities, where all difference could be banished and where opportunities were eternally endless.\n\nTHE DAILY STRIP Archie was introduced to comic-­book readers in the December 1941 issue of Pep Comics. That first story was created by Bob Montana, an artist only a few years older than the characters whose adventures he was chronicling. Born in 1920, Montana was one of hundreds of young and hungry freelancers who populated the art schools of New York in the early 1940s and sought work in the fledgling comic-­book industry. After producing work for True Comics and Fox Comics, among the least reputable and lowest paying of the publishers in the industry, Montana was asked to create a high school story and created Archie and his gang when he was only twenty-­one years old. When the story was a success, he was subsequently assigned the first issue of Archie (November 1942), and his career was on a roll. Interrupted by the Second World War, during which time Montana worked in New Jersey for the Army Signal Corps, he returned to Archie Comics and was chosen to take on the creative duties for the Archie daily and Sunday comic strips that were launched by syndicator King Features in 1947. Eventually appearing in more than 750 newspapers around the world, Montana’s version of the characters was in many ways the version with which American readers were most familiar.

That first story was created by Bob Montana, an artist only a few years older than the characters whose adventures he was chronicling. Born in 1920, Montana was one of hundreds of young and hungry freelancers who populated the art schools of New York in the early 1940s and sought work in the fledgling comic-­book industry. After producing work for True Comics and Fox Comics, among the least reputable and lowest paying of the publishers in the industry, Montana was asked to create a high school story and created Archie and his gang when he was only twenty-­one years old. When the story was a success, he was subsequently assigned the first issue of Archie (November 1942), and his career was on a roll. Interrupted by the Second World War, during which time Montana worked in New Jersey for the Army Signal Corps, he returned to Archie Comics and was chosen to take on the creative duties for the Archie daily and Sunday comic strips that were launched by syndicator King Features in 1947. Eventually appearing in more than 750 newspapers around the world, Montana’s version of the characters was in many ways the version with which American readers were most familiar. Despite the fact that Archie Comics sold millions of copies every month, many more millions of readers consumed the daily four-­panel gag strip, allowing Montana to define the characters that he had initially created.

While he is justifiably celebrated in the history of comics for his varied layouts and his superb characterization through body language, it was the pacing of his gags that set him apart from many of his peers on the newspaper page. His most important contribution to the history of the American comic strip was his ability to exploit a potentially unwieldy cast and his willingness to let his characters bump up against one another. Unlike the vast majority of newspaper strips, which were seemingly obligated to feature the lead characters on a daily basis, Montana had no qualms about turning the spotlight on secondary or even tertiary characters. Those who remember Archie as little more than a love triangle involving the titular lead with the vixenish Veronica and the bubbly Betty would be surprised to see how little of a role that romance actually played in the dailies. Restricted to a series of four-­panel daily gags, Montana was still able to extract considerable value from the format. The relatively large Archie cast was particularly well suited to the gag-­a-­day format. The strip is not so much about Archie as it is about the interaction of all those characters that exist in his orbit. Montana bounces from pairings such as Jughead and Miss Grundy to Betty and Pop Tate without batting an eye. Unusual pairings are provocative—­none more so than the regularly recurring duo of Mr. Weatherbee and Miss Beazley, a character that Montana frequently relied on even while she was virtually absent from the comic-­book series. Like the setup, the gags themselves are highly classical and traditional. Montana largely eschewed topical references in his work (even Christmas is allowed to pass without notice) as a way to home in on character-­driven humor. He boiled the Archie style to its core elements.\n\nA typical gag by Bob Montana from the Archie daily newspaper strip. From Archie (1963).\n\nFootnote 33\n\nDespite the incredible accomplishments of Montana’s many Archie heirs on the monthly comic books, it was the daily strip that remained the most distilled essence of the characters. For thirty years, Montana crafted a quintessential image of the bucolic life of the American teenager. Day after day, gag after gag, he refined the Archie style to its essence, providing a counterpoint to the Archie comic books that featured longer, more visually oriented storytelling. Montana’s work occasionally landed itself in the comic books—­most frequently when his gags were colored and rerun in Archie’s Joke Book or as filler in the other titles—­where it sat unevenly with the comic-­book version of the character. The differences between newspaper comics and comic books were so stark during the twelve-­cent era—­newspaper strips being so much more financially lucrative and, therefore, aesthetically cautious—­that the strip and the comic books are as dissimilar as they are the same.\n\nFOOTNOTE Forced to observe Betty and Veronica waiting on Archie hand and foot all day after they lose a bet to him about the population of Peru1 in Laugh 162 (September 1964), Mr. Lodge attempts to drive Archie away from his backyard pool by spiking his hamburger with hot sauce.
