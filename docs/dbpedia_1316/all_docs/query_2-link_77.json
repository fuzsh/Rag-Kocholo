        "text": "Finished another Lady of Horror this week. Fatso is a character in the Casper movie released in 1995 that includes Christina Ricci as one of the main characters. Fatso is in drag as Amelia, her deceased mother, to fool her father. Very very funny scene! I watch the movie every Halloween. Brad Garrett does the voice of Fatso perfectly! Interesting fact, Casper was “the first feature film to have a fully computer-generated visual effects character in a leading role.”\n\nThe Ladies of Horror series is a mix of feminine horror actors done in a Patrick Nagel style, although I kept the integrity of the character because Fatso wouldn’t look good without depth. I started these to better learn the Pen tool in Adobe Illustrator, and they’ve become an obsession. Now, with this one, I’ve mastered gradients…well kinda. If there’s a lady in a horror movie or TV show you’d like to see, leave her in a comment.\n\nWhile this is my first try at a major use of gradients in Adobe Illustrator, I’m quite pleased with how it turned out. Can’t wait to start a new project with gradients! Not at all sure what I want to do, but I feel it should be something original. Maybe I’ll try the Grim Reaper, who is a character I’ve mentioned in a book I wrote awhile back but never published. I want to revisit the book as a graphic novel.\n\nNo news on Angels Dark and Dumb. The cover artist is still working on the updates, but she’s getting close. Until next week…\n\nTook the entire weekend off last week for the first time in months to enjoy Mother’s Day and play with real paints and digital drawings. Here’s a digital drawing start of Fatso, one of the obnoxious ghosts from the Casper movie. Remember it? I watch it every Halloween month, mostly because I’m a huge Christina Ricci fan. Such a fun movie. This is from a hilarious scene where he becomes the deceased mother of Christina Ricci to kiss her father.\n\nFatso’s part of my Ladies of Horror series where I take a well known female horror character and turn her into a Patrick Nagel painting. I’m getting kinda bored with the tracings, so this has been extra fun to do. Taking me a bit of time to work on because I’m not the greatest with gradients yet. The character just works so much better with depth. Took me forever to get the hair the way I like it, and as a critical artist, I could five you a list of things I still hate about it. Hoping to get it done before next week’s status.\n\nBig news on Angels Dark and Dumb. I’ve changed the name of the third book based on some critique advice I got from a writer friend. Originally the title was Cause for Redemption. The title goes well with Call for Obstruction and Warrant for Damnation, it following a similar pattern of words. But, again, it kinda has a lack of comedy feel. So, I’m changing the title to something I came up with a while back. Are you ready for it? Big reveal…\n\nOn the Corner of Hell and Second Chances\n\nWhat do you think? It actually goes well with the titles for the three next books in the series. Yes, I’ve gotten as far in naming and detailing the ideas for them. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take another 10 years to see them published."
