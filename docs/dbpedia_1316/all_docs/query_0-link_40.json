Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1961.\n\nDjalioh is a hybrid human-ape ( l'homme-singe ) used, according to Gerard Klein, to demonstrate the rapport between different species, cultures, and civilizations, a rapport supported in Flaubert's day by Darwinism, anthropology, and eugenics (Klein sees the scifi great Lovecraft influenced by the theme:  les rapports entre races et civilizations differentes, le darwinisme, l'anthropologie, l'eugenisme. Ainsi fait-il par exemple s propos du theme de l'homme-singe: le lecteur, meme cultive, y decouvrira avec surprise l'anayse d'une oeuvre de jeunesse de Gustave Flaubert, Quidquid volueris (Klein).\n\n1841 Edgar Allen Poe. The Murders in the Rue Morgue. First published in \"the April 1841 issue of the Philadelphia publication Graham's Magazine , the story has been widely anthologized since (Ball 1).\n\n\"Detective fiction, a distinct literary form originated by Poe,\" is \"a dramatization of a reasoning process concerned with assembling and interpreting data to arrive at the truth that underlies the events of a crime\" (Stein 32). \"Poe's C. Auguste Dupin appeared in only three short stories, beginning with 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue' (1841), followed by 'The Mystery of Marie Roget' (1842), and concluding with 'The Purloined Letter' (1844) collected in Poe's Tales (1845)\" (Penzler 105). Dupin, along with Sherlock Holmes, \"set the tone for their [detective] successors . Both uncovered and, in true psychoanalytic manner, exposed and left harmless the bizarre, the grotesque, the brutal, the ferocious\" (Harper). Although the homicidal orangutan of this story is not the only literary nonhuman to be demonized as bizarre, grotesque, brutal, and ferocious in these early detective puzzles, the murderer of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter Camille in the locked room of their residence in the Rue Morgue provides the genesis of much demonizing of the great apes in the literature and film produced by those influenced by Poe and Doyle.\n\nPoe's view of the ape as a mindless imitator of human behavior has a long history in Western culture. An ape or a monkey traditionally served as a symbol of imitation in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century emblem books, for example. The concept lends its meaning to the English verb 'to ape' as well as to a long series of ambivalent images of monkey artists 'aping nature'[see 1740 Chardin and 1776 Anon. ]. Like Poe's orangutan, artists were credited with mindless mechanical skills instead of conscious achievements (Lippincott and Bluhm 134).\n\n1856 Leon Gozlan.

French. Gorilla Carrying Off a Woman. Bronze. 17 1/2 inches high. Private collection.\n\nFremiet's sculpture depicts another [besides Poe's orangutan] criminal ape, this time a gorilla. Information about gorillas reached Europe in the 1850s, and they were soon competing with orangtutans for the title of 'scariest living arthropoid' in the human imagination. Fremier made his first sculpture of a gorilla dragging off the body of a woman in 1859. In this later version, the gorilla has captured a live female, and the mystery is not 'whodunit' but 'why?' The sculptor provides some ambiguous clues. The wounded gorilla carries a rock, so it may be fleeing a conflict. The woman is young, naked, and struggles ineffectively . A snake slithers out of a crack in the rock of the bas. It might suggest a jungle environment, or a fall from innocence.\n\nContemporary critics interpreted the scene as a rape. This readingthe King Kong versiongained strength from ideas about race and gender that we find abhorrent today, but which were widely accepted as 'scientific' in the late nineteenth century and beyond .Thus the notion of a gorilla consumed with passion for an African woman (just one step away on the hideous evolutionary ladder) seemed feasible.\n\nFremier himself countered the rape story by stating that his gorilla is a female. If so, her motive is hunger, and murder and cannibalism would be her crimes. Ironically either interpretation would represent an advance inhuman understandings of primate psychology, by acknowledging that such animals were capable of feeling and independent action, and (think of the gorilla's rock) were intelligent enough to use tools or weapons deliberately (Lippincott and Bluhm 134; illustration 135).\n\n1888 Harry Prentice.

McGrug, 1922.\n\n\"The Sagoths constitute Pellucidar's race of gorilla-men. Though the Sagoth's body is in proportion to that of a human being, he is covered with a coat of shaggy brown hair. The head is basically humanoid but with a gorilla-like face. The strength of the Sagoth is like that of the greatest of the anthropods\" (Glut 52).\n\n1914 Edgar Rice Burroughs. Tarzan of the Apes . New York: Ballantine, 1963.\n\nActually Tarzan first appeared in a short story in 1912 in a magazine called All Story ; once the novel appeared, 24 Tarzan novels followed. David Arthur Jones, in a comprehensive essay on the ape in Burroughs' Tarzan series, asserts that the ape is the central character in the Tarzan Series .It is a basic relationship with apes, or with ape-like creatures, that must be considered absolutely fundamental to a complete understanding of Tarzan and, perhaps in some ways, an understanding of the entire Burroughsian world (1).\n\nCertainly no earlier literary treatment allowed the gorilla to be seen as such a complex and sympathetic character, and the popularity of the series undoubtedly influenced the popular view of them. Particularly important is the range of personality types found among Burroughs' gorilla characters. Kala, who, having lost her own infant, eagerly adopts, nurses, protects and teaches the orphaned white ape, John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, is undoubtedly meant to invoke comparisons with the wolf mother of Romulus and Remus. However, she evokes reader empathy as her more famous predecessor does not (although allusions to Kipling's Jungle Books and presenting Tarzan as Kala's \"best beloved\" suggests Kipling's more sympathetically presented wolf parents were consciously on Burroughs' mind). In contrast are old Kerchack who killed Kala's original infant and her mate Terzok who hates the adopted white ape and remains his arch enemy through much of the novel, coming closest to revenge when he carries away Tarzan's mate-to-be, Jane Porter, to \"a fate a thousand time worse than death.\" These primates are, in other words, as fully developed as characters as are Burroughs' human creations, interacting in Tarzan's life as fully, if not more fully, than do most humans he encounters in the novel. Some, like Kala and Terzok even have whole chapters devoted to presenting their points of view and perspectives, not only on Tarzan's life, but on their own ape dramas. This actually calls into question theories like Berglund's which claims that [t]he immediate vision of the book figures these ideogogical correlatives --emperialism, idealism, mimeticism, monoculturaliztionthat sustain a tradition of Commonwealth history (55).\n\nTo be fair, Burroughs does differentiate these apes from ordinary gorillas: they are \"of a species closely allied to the gorilla, yet with more intelligence, which with the strength of their cousins, made [them] the most fearsome of those awe-inspiring progenitors of man.\" Actually, the gorillas who attacked and killed Tarzan's human parents are \"the deadly enemies of his [adoptive] tribe.\" Kala herself, but nine or ten when she adopts Tarzan, \" was large and powerful--a splendid, clean-limbed animal with a round, high forehead, which denoted more intelligence than most of her kind possessed. So, also, she had a greater capacity for mother love and mother sorrow.\" (One almost suspects Burroughs had at least imaginatively happened upon the prototype of the close relative of the chimpanzee, the bonobo!)\n\nThe reader learns that Tarzan means \"white skin\" in the language of these super-apes, a language they use to communicate daily but also use to tell stories which pass both new information and rituals from generation to generation. This is often overlooked by critics commenting on Tarzan teaching himself to read and write from the books in his parents' hut. Berglund assumes that Tarzan intuits writing is a product of humans yet refrain[s] from using it with the native humans because he is, at heart racist and senses an inherent connection between the written word, the self-created English book and whiteness (60). Actually, he probably is aware the natives, whose oral culture is familiar to him, simply do not read, making it as useless to share the books with them as with the apes he respects.\n\nWhen Kala is killed by a poisoned arrow, Burroughs shows Tarzan grieving as any man would for a beloved mother, but he also reveals that Tarzan's aesthetic sense has been affected both by nature (attraction to Jane) and nurture: \"What though Kala was a fierce and hideous ape! To Tarzan she had been kind; she had been beautiful.\" Without question, Burroughs' fiction remains essentially focused on the human, ascribing most of Tarzan's finer senses and impulses to his being human (and aristocratic!). But readers nourished on his empathetically presented apes and his frequent editorializing on the false boundaries erected between humans and other animals, would be especially open to the work of Goodall, Fossey and Galdikas that has fueled the current drive for equality under the law for all the greater primates (see Peterson and Wise).\n\n1915 Edgar Rice Burroughs. Jungle Tales of Tarzan. New York: Ballantine, 1963.\n\nAlthough Burroughs wrote many other stories about the fantastic and unearthly, his main claim to fame is the Tarzan series. First appearing in Tarzan of the Apes (1914), this 20th-century folk hero is depicted as the son of an English nobleman, abandoned in Africa in his infancy. He is brought up by apes, learns to speak their language (and that of other animals as well), and goes through a series of breathtaking adventures. Eventually Tarzan marries, has a son, and finally a grandson. Millions of copies of the Tarzan books have been sold, and they have been translated into fifty-six languages. Many films have been made of his adventures, and he has long been a comic-strip favorite (Benet's 3rd ed. 960).\n\n1915 Edgar Rice Burroughs. The Son of Tarzan . New York: Ballantine, 1963.\n\nThis fifth novel in the Tarzan series is of particular interest because in it Akut, a gorilla from Tarzan's adoptive band, serves as the mentor of young Jack Clayton, Tarzan's and Jane's only child, after the boy rescues the captive ape from life as a circus performer in London. The two embark for Africa where Jack intends to return Akut to his people. When circumstances lead Jack to return with Akut, the boy is quick to answer the call of the wild. In fact, this novel is really Burroughs' Call of the Wild , just as the original Tarzan is his White Fang .\n\nShowing himself the true son of Tarzan, he becomes Korak which, in the language of the apes (a tongue for which the boy has a natural aptitude), means Killer. Here, as is not so evidently the case in earlier novels, the ape is a speaking character: \"The language of the great apes is a combination of monosyllabic gutturals, amplified by gestures and signs. It may not be translated into human speech.\" Burroughs uses the adventure of the two to force his readers to recognize the remarkable similarities between the two primate species as well as the crucial differences. The maturing Korak is more and more attracted to the girl he rescues, fortuitously revealed to be the kidnapped daughter of a French nobleman and a suitable mate for a Lord of England. But Akut's sexual interest is also aroused by one of his own kind. He finds the human Meriam too \"smooth and hairless,\" \"snakelike,\" and \"unattractive,\" while the \"true feminine beauty\" of his own species lies in the \"great, generous mouth; lovely, yellow fangs, and softest side whiskers.\" No interspecies sex despite clear similarities!\n\n1917 Franz Kafka. A Report to the Academy. The Complete Stories . Ed. Nahum N. Glatzer. New York: Schocken Books, 1971. 213-225.\n\nThe story and its narrator, Red Peter, play a crucial role in a lecture being delivered to an academy by the main character in J. M. Coetzee's 1999 The Lives of Animals . Her point is that Kafka intended his character to be understood, not as a \"defective human being\" but as \"a branded, marked, wounded animal presenting himself as speaking testimony to a gathering of scholars.\" It is toward that end that Coetzee's readers are asked to understand the \"arduous descent from the silence of the beasts to the gabble of reason\" that the experimental ape took upon himself. Kafka, whom Coetzee sees as playing a similar scapegoat role in the Europe of his time, was not unaware of the parallels between the ape and his fellow Jews, but Coetzee's text speaks of the nonhuman--not of members of human minorities--as the real scapegoat in human history.\n\nOther critics have suggested that 'A Report to the Academy' seems to be a communication seeking to establish a contrast between two life forms in an objective fashion. After all, it is crafted as the presentation of a learned paper before a scientific society, a paper in which the deliverer is engaged in describing his former life-style as an ape. The chronological distance between the life reported upon and the actual life of the reporter may be shortjust five yearsbut it is in fact a chasm, for, as its author points out, 'an infinitely long time [in which] to gallop at full speed' had indeed transpired. And this is a gap equivalent to the ape's humanization. The instrumentality required to bring this qualitative change was precisely the ape's refusal to be 'stubbornly set on clinging to my origins, to the remembrances of my youth.' But is this not the same as having broken the lived continuity of the ape's life? Is this not precisely the reason for autobiography having in this case been transmogrified into a scientific report? In other words, the ape has become a man by having stepped outside his former life and thereby gained the capacitysince the sufficient distance of objectivity had thus been brought into beingto speak of an ape's life in a detached, scientific manner. The ape's purpose, namely, 'imparting knowledge,' was accordingly accomplished to perfection.\n\nYet there are indicationsthe possible product of Kafka's ironic self-distancing from the ape's own self-distancewhich suggest that the humanization of the ape is not and cannot possibly be achieved completely since, in a way, the ape-man mirrors his present companion, 'a half-trained little chimpanzee' that he cannot bear to see, for 'she has the insane look of the bewildered half-broken animal in her eye.' (My italics.) In his present condition, he seems to connect with his companion as his manager relates to him, for the manager 'sits in the anteroom; when I ring, he comes and listens to what I have to say. Nearly every evening I give a performance, and I have a success which could hardly be increased.' (Garcia-Gomez 125-126)\n\nDown the street he pointed out a war poster on a billboard. It was a picture of a gorilla making off with a white woman. It said in big black letters: \"Save your sweetheart from the Huns! (description of WW I setting in Zane Grey's 30,000 on the Hoof [1940]. NY: Harper Paperbacks, 1990: 223.)\n\n1918 Tarzan of the Apes\n\nThe screen legacy of Edgar Rice Burroughs' jungle hero began with this faithful silent version, with Elmo Lincoln as the son of Lord and Lady Greystoke who, after his parents are killed in Africa, is raised by apes and learns to live by the laws of the jungle. Co-stars Enid Markey.  In response to a reader's querry about the number of Tarzan films that have been made, Walter Scott's Personality Parade (Parade 10 January 1999:2) notes: The Internet Movie Database (http:// IMDB.com ) lists 81 theatrical releases featuring Tarzan, including foreign-language versions. The original , a silent film, starred Elmo Lincoln. The most recent big-screen version was Tarzan and the Lost City , a 1998 dud starring Casper Van Dien. At least two Tarzan films are scheduled for this year [1999]. The most famous Tarzan, of course, was the late Johnny Weissmuller, who swung through the jungle in 12 films.\n\n1922 A Blind Bargain\n\n...the film was inspired by the then-current interest in the Voronoff theories of prolonging life and youth by the transplanting of animal glands (mostly from monkeys) into human beings. These experiments, well-covered by the press of both continents, had inspired a best-selling novel Black Oxen (later released in movie form early in 1924), as well as the dusting off of an old Marie Corelli novel, Young Diana , which served as a Marion Davies vehicle in 1922.... A Blind Bargain was more outrageously fantastic than either of these:\n\nRobert, a young man down-and-out (Raymond McKee) agrees to submit to an experiment to be performed on him by the eminent scientist Dr. Lamb (Lon Chaney) in return for which Lamb agrees to treat Robert's sick mother. The young man soon realizes that the experiment may cost him his life after he discovers that the hunchbacked assistant (Lon Chaney) of the doctor is really an ape-man, the result of a previous experiment. The ape-man reveals to Robert the doctor's secret operating room and the hideous creatures kept in cages in varied stages of human completion. Dr. Lamb overpowers Robert and straps him to the operating table, after which the ape-man releases a gorilla-like monster who crushes the life out of the mad scientist.\n\nBased on the novel The Octave of Claudius by Barry Plain, the film is basically a free adaptation of Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau with its semi-human horrors, sympathetic man-beast, and grisly climax. It was to become the archetype of the mad scientist movies and it further enhanced the reputation of Lon Chaney... (Clarens 46).\n\n1923 Carl Akeley The Chrysalis (bronze sculpture) .\n\nTwo years before his final, fatal trip [to Africa], Akeley [father of the modern diorama and talented creator of the Great Hall of African Mammals at the NYC Museum of natural History] had created a bronze sculpture depicting a handsome 'modern' man (resembling the youthful Akeley himself) ewerging from a cracked-open gorilla skin. He called the statue The Chrysalis , implying that humans had emerged from apes. When the piece was rejected for exhibition by the national Academy of Design, the Reverand Charles Francis Potter of New York City's West Side Unitarian Church expressed admiration for the sculpture and asked Akeley whether he could display it in the church (Milner 44). See Haraway, Primate Visions, 31, 41, 53-54).\n\n1927 The Gorilla Based on a play by Ralph Spence.\n\n1927 The Wizard.\n\nBased on a play, Balaoo, by Gaston Laroux, the film combined a mysterious manor with a mad scientist and his gorilla-man (Clarens 57). Frank adds: A mad surgeon grafts the head of a man onto an ape's body and employs the creature as a tool to\n\nexact revenge on his enemies. The story is daft, although it turned up again in 1942 as Dr. Renault's Secret, but it is well act-ed, particularly by Gustav von Seyffertitz as the surgeon, and the cinematography raises a few frissons (143).\n\n1929 Eden Phillpots. The Apes .\n\n\"an evolutionary allegory\" (Stableford 271)\n\n1930 Wyndham Lewis. Apes of God . Santa Barbara, CA: Black Sparrow Press, 1981.\n\n1930 Ferdinand A. Ossendowski. The Life Story of a Little Monkey: The Diary of the Chimpanzee Ket . Trans. from the Polish by Francis Bauer Czarnomski. New York: E. P. Dutton.\n\nA variation on the animal autobiography, the animal diary, undoubtedly because it takes the added step of assuming a nonhuman can write, is a rarer genre. Nonetheless, earlier examples exist (perhaps even in Polish although I am unaware of any). The first I am aware of is Thomas Smith's The Life of a Fox written by Himself (1843), not specified as a diary, but very like Ossendowski's in its chronological recording of a nonhuman life; Jean Oliver Davidson's Blacky's Diary (1899), a sequel to her The Story of Blacky and the first of many cat and dog diaries; Edith Dunham's The Diary of a Mouse (1907); and Stanley Reeves' Rhubarb: The Diary of a Gentleman's Hunter (1908). Ossendowski's novel seems to be the first nonhuman primate diary or autobiography before the great apes became frequent subjects in language experiments. Since, a number of authors have seen the advantage of making the ape's point of view the narrative perspective, but as far as I know, the only other diary is found in Gary Kern's The Snow Leopard (1996).\n\nWhat is most significant here is that Ossendowski anticipates and refines Ishmael's theme of captivity. In Part I Ket elaborates on the leaver life of the young chimp in the wild, making the killing of her mother and the capture of Ket herself more affecting than is Quinn's version of Ishmael's capture. Ket (whose name in captivity becomes Katey) is cared for by loving and knowledgeable humans, pretty obviously the author and his wife, but through them encounters an old chimpanzee chained to a perch in his owners' garden who tells Ket, \"'Men are good to me . The only thing they do not understand is that I cannot live without liberty, and I do not want to.'\" In Part II, after she has been lost and trained to perform, Ket learns about the legendary Moritz, also a performing ape, who grew gloomy as he matured, \"sticking for hours in a corner and rocking.\" Though they sensed he \"was longing for something\" and that it might be \"his motherland,\" his keepers don't really understand his despair. Foreshadowing Ket's own future, Moritz escapes while performing in a seaside town and is last seen swimming \"away and away\" (One wonders if the scene, and the parallel scene in the novel's afterword, influenced the conclusion to Richard Adams The Plague Dogs except like Quinn Ossenkowski offers no other possible fate for Ket. As Ishmael's student never understands, a human master would be just a kinder version of captivity).\n\nAlthough the novel contains some inaccuracies about chimpanzee behavior, it is clearly based on close observation both in the wild and in captivity. Ket's intelligence and emotions and sentience are clear in her responses and actions as well as in her words.\n\n1931. John Collier. His Monkey Wife: Or, Married to a Chimp . Intro. by Paul Thoreau. Oxford UP, 1983.\n\nWritten in the sardonic and fantastic vein that characterized his later work ( Benet's Reader's Encyclopaedia . 3rd ed. 201), this tale leads to serious thought about the intelligence and rights of the chimpanzee who seems superior in every way to the women she successfully schemes to replace in the male protagonist's life.\n\nKatherine A. Powers, in \"Summer Reading\" ( Boston Sunday Globe 4 June 2000:H6) recommends Collier's novel:\n\nEvery other summer or so I reread \"His Monkey Wife\" and urge others to do so too. The stumbling block has been that the book has been out of print for years . So I am happy to report that Collier's work has just returned to print thanks to Paul Dry Books ($14.95).\n\nThe novel is one of the great idiosyncratic comedies in English--a designation, incidentally, that is a literary category in my mind . Suffice it to say that what distinguishes the books in this category is not only that each is so idiosyncratic as to be sui generis, but also that the fulcrum of their comedy is cultural piety and the Western literary tradition .\n\n\"His Monkey Wife\" is written in high-flown, often urgent prose. It is a love story and concerns Mr. Fatigay, a schoolmaster, and his \"petit, dark and vivacious\" disciple, Emily: the toast of the British Museum Reading Room and a chimpanzee. As in most love stories there are moments of passionate jealousy, longing, and fierce romantic intrigue, all conveyed with such a fine and delicate sensibility that one should, perhaps, be ashamed of oneself for laughing. But then, as P. G. Wodehouse observed, comedy is \"the kindly contemplation of the incongruous.\"\n\n1931 The Gorilla\n\n1931 S. Fowler Wright.

Lugosi was cast as Dr. Mickle, a sideshow mountebank who comes to Paris...with an intelligent ape named Erik on a chain. The sideshow masks his true activity--the attempt to mix the blood of a woman with the blood of an ape, and thus prove an evolutionary link. (The film is in many ways a crazy artifact of the Scopes trial era.) Erik enters the bedroom of Camille L'Espanaye like a simian version of Conrad Veidt's Cesare, and carries her across the expressionistically distorted rooftops of Paris before killing his master and meeting his doom (Skal 165). Clarens, too, sees the film as \"closer to Caligari that to Edgar Allen Poe in its bizarre, Expressionistic set and camera work. The story had a very Hoffmannesque Dr. Mirakle (Bela Lugosi) going about his way in the Paris of Daumier and Murger, trying to prove a theory of evolution that would have staggered Darwin and that involved the kidnapping of women for unholy experiments conducted with a gorilla that Mirakle exhibits in the Boulevard du Crime. At the time of its release, the film was criticized for its unrestrained ferocity .[In] the most gruesome scene (the only one retained from the original tale) the hero (Leon Ames) discovers the body of the heroine's mother (Betty Ross Clarke), dead and stuffed feet first up a chimney\" (72-73).\n\nHow long will it take before others here in Germany may only be seen behind bars? (front page, Der Staumer, 10 March 1932 [from: Boria Sax, Animals in the Third Reich (2000), 55]).\n\n1932 Tarzan, the Ape Man\n\nVenturing into the dark depth of the African wilds, a scientific expedition searching for the Elephants' Graveyard instead encounters the untamed Lord of the Apes who literally sweeps Jane off her feet and into his treetop lair. Johnny Weissmuller, Maureen O'Sullivan co-star.\n\n1933 King Kong\n\nThe original beauty and the beast film classic tells the story of Kong, a giant ape captured in Africa and brought to New York as a sideshow attraction. Kong falls for Wray, escapes from his captors and rampages through the city, ending up on top of the newly built Empire State Building. Moody Steiner score adds color, and Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation still holds up well. Remade numerous times with various theme derivations. Available in a colorized version (what a monstrosity).\n\nThe laserdisc, produced from a superior negative, features extensive liner notes and running commentary by the film historian Ronald Haver ( VideoHound's 161).\n\nClarens credits Merian C. Cooper, one of America's foremost documentary film makers: While Cooper and Schoedsack were on location in Africa shooting some animal footage for Paramount's version of the Four Feathers (1929), Cooper became interested in the habits of the gorilla. He conceived an idea about an outsized ape of superior intelligence running amok in the city streets of the civilized world. He embellished this concept with a few more specific scenes: the gorilla would fight one of the giant lizards of Komodo (then of widespread topicality because two of the reptiles had been brought alive to New York's Bronx Zoo where, with dispatch, they died); for a climax the gorilla would make one last stand on top the recently finished Empire State Building... (91-92).\n\nThere can be no doubt that its Beauty-and-the-Beast leitmotiv formed itself in the core of the original conception. The film opens with an 'old Arabian proverb': 'And the Beast looked into the face of Beauty and lo! his hand was stayed from killing and from that day forward he was as one dead.' It closes with the mournful Dedham, standing to the side of the fallen giant, informing a callous cop that 'Twas Beauty killed the Beast'--and this theme is reiterated and enhanced throughout the film by the secular liturgy of the myth: the golden-haired virgin offered to the barbarous demigod (variously a dragon, unicorn, minotaur or, here, an arthropoid) who is unable to spill this ritual victim's blood, the sacrificial maiden then becoming the prize in a combat between beast and hero (Clarens 93-94).\n\nKing Kong (1933) encapsulates these underlying misconceptions [of the 19th c belief that the missing link among Other people in Other places]: this classic film, still one of the most popular ever made, begins as an ethnographic expedition, to find the 'Eighth Wonder of the World.' Kong is once described as an ape in the film, but he is far more deeply anthropomorphized, as a king who is worshipped as a god by the dancing and drumming savages outside his sanctuary. The moment that he desires Fay Wray, King Kong defined for generations of viewers, his tragic, transgressive, beast-like male desire. King Kong is a dark, looming, cannibal giant who snatches tiny victims; like the bogeymen of myths, he changes scale phantasmagorically in the course of the film, all the better to penetrate the innermost corners of the mind. Like ogres and giants in fairy tales, he symbolizes a prior time of greater barbarism that threatens to wreck the civilization of the heroes, exercises an irresistible fascination, but cannot in the end prevail against it. In the course of the film, he changes, however, into a symbol of tragic male bondage and is felled by his own overweening desires. The final icon of the filmKing Kong on the pinnacle of the Empire State Building snatching at aeroplanes like a cat swatting at fliescrystallizes the lure and fascination of the imagined unruly and primitive rampant, the very thrill of the bogey inside us. (Warner 336)\n\nThe misestimation of our genetic neighbors in the cinema has never abated since King Kong set the high-water mark for countless scary gorilla movies. Degrading stage acts with live chimps and orangutans dressed in human clothes began in vaudeville and continue today. From the indignities of the organ grinder to Bedtime for Bonzo , primates have never had a chance to be them-selves in our eyes. (Pyle 310). Especially suggestive are Kinnard's observations that \"O'Brien's strangely beautiful landscape on the lost [Skull] island\" are \"based on the eerie black and white drawings of Gustav Dore\" (16); that much of the film \"is intentionally styled larger than life in order to impart a mythic, timeless structure\" (27); and that, in fact, \"Everything about KING KONG--the writing, the direction, the acting, and special effects--is larger than life, aiming for a fairy tale, story book quality\" (33). See also Mitman, 55-58.\n\n1933 Son of Kong\n\nthe purported offspring, a great white gorilla, is little more than an emasculated version of the great Kong--funny and endearing as a big teddy bear (Clarens 95). Kinnard disagrees, calling the film \"very entertaining , and despite some opinions to the contrary, a worthy sequel to KING KONG\" (36). In it Kong's friendly young offspring protects the main characters from Skull Island's prehistoric monsters, leads them to the fabled treasure that drew their expedition back, and, at the end, sacrifices himself to save them from the earthquake-induced flood that destroys the island (Kinnard 37-38).

In the shattering final scene, the immortal people [also] turn out to be apes. Meant simply to comment with evolutionary wisdom on why human primates cannot be immortal (as well as on what Huxley saw as his time's obsession with youth and immortality), today the ending suggests that the infamous monkey serum used to suppress the aging process has the same danger we imagine is possessed by transgenic transplants and gene manipulation (Janes 147).\n\n1939 The Gorilla\n\nDisappointing comedy-whodunit with the Ritz Brothers as fumbling detectives prowling around old-dark house in search of a murderer....Filmed before in 1930.

Ape and Essence . New York: Harper & Row.\n\nWorks of science fiction written around the premise of genetic accident exhibit striking similarities, even when the fictional sources of the accident may contrast sharply. Genetic alteration caused by man himself is perhaps the most common subject in biological fiction. Aldous Huxley's Ape and Essence (1948) early raises very disturbing questions about the possibility; and, as more people began to recognize the potential destructiveness of atomic war and radioactive fallout, the 'alteration by warfare' motif became increasingly popular in science fiction. Huxley's novel, like his After Many a Summer Dies the Swan (1939) and Wells's The Time Machine (1895), builds on the idea of man's degeneration as a species. Ape and Essence , however, is an even more forceful, more sardonic condemnation of human weakness and stupidity than the two earlier works. Within a 'screenplay' framework, Huxley unfolds his portrait of the human species, whose genetic structure has been mutated by radioactive fallout, rapidly degenerating into bestial, fear-ridden behavior and slavishly devoted to the 'worship of Belial.' In a series of often bitterly satiric scenarios, Huxley delivers a powerful warning of how men, disregarding even their own self-interest, have set themselves in a direction which will lead to their own destruction. Either men, reproducing without limit and plundering their own planet, will eventually starve to death or, more likely, they will turn their own technology loose and ravage the world in a great holocaust.\n\nThe pessimism and distrust of technology and science voiced in this novel finds similar, though usually less skillfully crafted expression in many fictional [and filmic] speculations about accidental genetic alteration (Parker 36). Cf. also Stableford 314-315.\n\n1949 Mighty Joe Young\n\nClarens comments that although the film won...an academy award for...special effects, the film is most charitably described as King Kong for children. Like Kong, Joe Young is a gorilla, albeit only ten feet tall. But unlike King, Joe is the household pet of an orphan girl (Terry Moore) raised in an African ranch, and as docile and housebroken as a Great Dane. Both the girl and her ape are discovered by a showman (Robert Armstrong, of course) and his cowboy safari and brought to a temple-sized Hollywood nightclub where Mighty Joe holds his mistress and a grand piano aloft on a platform while she plays 'Beautiful Dreamer.' The incongruous look of Texan cowpokes scouring the African veldt points to the source of Mighty Joe Young 's most spectacular trick effects (95).\n\nLike King Kong, Mighty Joe Young was produced by Cooper, directed by Schoedsack and features the \"stop-motion animation by O'Brien [who \"received a well-deserved Oscar for the film\"] and Ray Harryhausen\" (Kinnard 33).\n\n1949 Zamba . A gorilla.\n\n1950 Forbidden Jungle . With Tamba, the chimpanzee.\n\n1951 My Friend Irma Goes West . With Pierre, the chimpanzee.\n\n1951 Bedtime for Bonzo\n\nPeterson points out that this Universal International film, like so many cinematic comedies that feature performing apes, is less concerned with realism than with entertainment. As a result \"the apes are humanized to such an exaggerated and surprising degree that they become central characters in what would otherwise be purely human drama.\" Here, Ronald Reagan plays Peter Boyd, a \"psychology professor,\" who is engaged to the Dean's daughter. When his paternity is revealed, Dean Tillinghurst breaks the engagement, leading \"to a nature versus nurture debate between the dean and the psychology professor.\" Bonzo becomes the professor's project to prove his nurture hypothesis.\n\nIn the end, as we might have guessed, instead of Professor Boyd teaching Bonzo to be more human, Bonzo teaches Boyd to be more human--to descend slightly from his professorial remoteness and to recognize that he really loves the beautiful woman he hired to help him play 'father' to Bonzo, rather than the spoiled and manipulative Valerie Tillinghurst. [Peterson's main point here is that] the exaggerated anthropomorphism leads us into deeper and deeper levels of illusion [that provoke the viewer to ask: If Bonzo is] someone profoundly humanlike and ultimately fragile why is he being treated so much like an animal?\" (140-143).\n\n1952 Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla.

Once more Aslan and the children triumph, but at a price that may have the listener/reader asking questions. The ape, Shift, gets a lion skin that he drapes over the donkey, Puzzle, and passes him off as Aslan. The killing of the Talking Trees and selling of the Talking Beasts into slavery with the Calormines begins. King Tirian and Jewel, the unicorn, arrive, the King quickly giving himself up to Shift so that he can find out about Aslan. Two children, Jill and Eustace, come to his aid as the sides of good and evil are drawn once more (Apseloff 433). What is significant is that the ape Shift is a negative character who is largely responsible for the fall of Narnia. He and the Cat are, as Blount points out, the only delinquent Talking Beasts:\n\nShift, who is lazy, artful, ambitious, and greedy, starts by exploiting the gentle donkey Puzzle and goes on to exploit all the other Talking Beasts by working on their simple, loyal credulity. In a way, he is a Beast descending into Humanity, for this is what humans do. Shift even ends by dressing like a human. The Ape's aim is to sell Narnia to Calorman. Only the Cat sees through the Ape's trickery and connives at it, and is punished in the inevitable way by losing the faculty of speech, becoming witless and wild.

This 1960 novel also employs the device of the gorilla as the protagonist. J. G. is a member of a fictional high-elevation subspecies called the silver gorillas. His search for his abducted mate, Lotus, in America becomes a vehicle for sharp, witty satire of contemporary culture. 'For the first time in his life, J. G. was unhappy.

Although Ping envisions Green Knowe as a refuge for the natural forces [he believes are] embodied in the gorilla, it soon becomes obvious that the modern world contains no such refuge.

New York: Gramercy Books, 2000.\n\nspeculative fiction adventure with Swiftian social satire (Greene 2). Source of idea for the film series, but quite different from the films. In the novel a manuscript containing the story of three astronauts and a chimpanzee named Hector who reach an earth-like planet in a far off galaxy is found drifting in a bottle in space. The identity of the two travelers who find the tale is kept secret until the final pages of the novel. They are not human as the reader assumes, but chimpanzees, part of the society of higher primates (chimps, gorillas, and orangutans) that rose on Earth after the fall of humans--exactly as the astronauts in the story had found to be the case on the planet they \"discover\" and are stranded upon.\n\nIt is a shock to the two surviving astronauts to find humans, fine physical specimens with no cultural, linguistic, or intellectual attainments, used as experimental animals by the higher, rational apes who have speech. One of the astronauts devolves under the force of the shock. The other, the narrator of the tale, succeeds in convincing his ape masters that he is not like the humans of their planet by revealing his skill with language and technology while a subject in their human language experiments. Although this brings him equal treatment initially, he is soon perceived, as was Gulliver by his Houhyhmn masters, as a danger. With the help of two sympathetic chimpanzee scientists, he escapes with his primitive human wife and their son, managing to get back to the spaceship and return to Earth. In the intervening centuries, Earth has become a mirror image of the planet he has escaped, ruled by chimp intellectuals, orangutan administrators, and a gorilla military.\n\nThese make the same arguments in reverse that are current in our own culture now (\"Ape is of course the only rational creature, the only one possessing a mind [and a \"spiritual essence\"] as well as a body;\" \"The scientists were divided into two groups: those who refused to acknowledge that an animal had a soul of any sort, and those who saw only a difference of degree between the mentality of beasts and that of apes\").\n\n1963 King Kong vs. Godzilla\n\n\"In his last years [Willis] O'Brien toyed with the idea of reissuing KING KONG in a film pitting the giant ape against an animated version of the Frankenstein monster. Attempting to secure permission for the use of the Kong character from RKO, the project was taken out of his hands and licensed to the Japanese Toho Studios, which used O'Brien's concept as the basis for the juvenile film King Kong Vs. Godzilla\" (Kinnard 34). Fortunately O'Brien died in 1962, a year before the resulting film was released in the United States.\n\nThe planet issues a collective shudder as the two mightiest monsters slug it out. In the Arctic Ocean, Godzilla frees himself from the iceberg prison he found himself in at the end of Godzilla Raids Again, destroys a nuclear sub for a snack, and heads for Japan to raise hell. Meanwhile, on tropical Farou Island, rare medicinal berries cause an ape to grow far beyond Kong size. The president of Japanese drug company (Ichiro Arishima) has the beast captured, with plans to star him on the TV show he sponsors, but the monster escapes en route and swims ashore to raise hell. Kong is subdued by the berry juice and transported to meet Godzilla, in the hope that the two menaces will finish each other off in a grand duel on Mt. Fugi. A co-production between Toho and various American parties, this was the first Godzilla (or King film for that matter) to be shot in color and scope. The f/x are not as good as in sequels to follow, but acceptable-though the Kong costume is horrible. A persistent false rumorthat a different ending was seen in Japan with Kong defeatedmakes no sense, as Godzilla is the villain in both versions. However, Universal drastically changed the original for U.S. release, adding senseless scenes while omitting vital footage, even going so far as to replace the score with stock library music.

A U.S.-Korean co-production, this is a cheap rip-off of the Kong re-make which also throws in a rubber shark at the beginning.

As didactic as [Adams'] The Plague Dogs [which also takes aim at senseless experimentation of nonhuman animals], it also touts the superiority of apes over humans. Sasha, the commentator, says of humans:\n\nThey are taught at the youngest age to see progress in change. It is why they get their education, and subsequently set their minds to improving the world. I dearly love their innocence, it is so sweet and shortsighted. And their great intelligence, it makes them the most stupid of all animals. This is another sad truth that all apes know.\n\n....the group of apes does become a 'family.' In the end they are defeated by hunters and the weather; and the two remaining apes have to return to the experimental station. Donovan's message is clear and simple ( Thursday's Child , 114-115; Worlds Within 260).

The creature escapes and wreaks havoc until it is killed on top of the World Trade Center. Glossy, overbudgeted remake of the classic King Kong which abandons all the mystery and fantasy of the 1933 original in favor of a facetious and camped up version that never thrills. The special effects are dismal in comparison with its predecessor and, instead of Willis O'Brien's superb animation, most of Kong's appearances here are reduced to Rick Baker running around in an obvious monkey suit (Frank 86).\n\nKinnard refers to the film, not as \"a remake at all, but a spoofy send-up, so corrupt and so diffused by its negative, low-brow 'camp' approach that it completely dissipated the mythic potential of the original material\" (32).\n\n1976 Wilson Rawls. Summer of the Monkeys . New York: Bantam Doubleday Yearling, 1999.\n\nA fourteen-year-old Ozark farmboy learns an invaluable lesson, not only about monkeys and chimpanzees, but about human values and self-involvement.

Late one night Beddoe and Clyde sit together under the stars; the barfighter unburdens himself to the ape: 'I suppose you think I'm crazy, traipsin' across the country after a girl I hardly know. Hell, I'm not like Orville [his best human buddy] . I'm not afraid of any man, but when it comes to a woman, my stomach just turns to Royal gelatin.' Beddoe even takes Clyde to bars for a drink , and in a moment of enormous inspiration decides that Clyde needs a positive sexual experience ('to get laid'), just like any other normal guy, so they break into a zoo and find a female orang for Clyde. Discreetly, we are shown Clyde entering a cage occupied by the female of his choice and then the door slowly closing. Clyde has found his own stuff of dreams\" (Peterson 142).\n\nAs with the 1951 Bedtime for Bonzo, the film's \"exaggerated anthropomorphism\" succeeds in leading the audience to ask questions about the ethics of our treatment of \"so human an animal.\" Ironically, Peterson discovered that the ape who played Clyde, Popi, was a featured performer in Bobby Berosini's Las Vegas Chimp Act, the subject of a well-know PETA exposé (Peterson 158ff).\n\n1978-81 BJ and the Bear --a TV series in which the Bear is a chimp\n\n1979 A.

New York: Bantam.\n\nAlthough humans, genetically enhanced dolphins, and other galactic species are featured in this first Uplift novel, one genetically altered Chimpanzee, Dr. Jeffrey appears early in the novel. He is \"the first of his species to become a full member of a space research team\": \"two centuries of genetic engineering had wrought changes in the skull and pelvic arch, changes modeled on the human form . He looked like a very fuzzy, short, brown man with long arms and huge buckteeth\" (77). His thumb had been altered but he is still able to communicate only with the help of a computer keyboard. Still he is skilled enough to pilot a Sunship, a solar probe, and has a well-developed sense of self. There is real grief among his various colleagues when \"Scientist-Chimpanzee Jeffrey's Sunship [is] destroyed in the chromosphere of [Earth's] Sun!\" (110).\n\nAs it turn out, the tragedy is the work of the Pila Bubbacub, a member of one of the old Galactic races, \"a representative\" of the prestigious Galactic Uplift Institution, to whom \"Jeffrey represented a abomination , a species that had been uplifted a mere hundred years before and yet dared to talk back\" even to Bubbacub! (224). He\n\nHated what chimpanzees represent . Along with dolphins, they meant instant status for the crude, vulgar human race. The Pila had to fight for half a million years to get where they are .

Congo.\n\nUnlike the real Congo, Crichton's Congo is bursting with gorillas. First, there is Amy, a fast maturing female mountain gorilla who is really the novel's leading lady. Amy has, under the guidance of primatologist Peter Elliot and the staff of Project Amy, acquired a signing vocabulary of 620 words. Her dream-inspired finger-paintings, mysteriously reminiscent of a 1642 Portugese print of the Lost City of Zinj, lead to Elliot and Amy joining forces with a field expedition from the Huston-based Earth Resources Technology Services on the trail of rare blue diamonds valuable as superconductors. The expedition encounters both the mountain gorillas with whom Elliot hopes Amy might serve as ambassador and what appears to be a new species of gray gorilla, warrior apes, developed and bred by the people of the Lost City to guard their diamond mines. Apparently after a rebellion against their masters, these gray gorillas continue to protect the Lost City from all who venture too close. Like Amy, these apes sign but use their gestures only to supplement a spoken language that Elliot guesses may be the result of their former masters' primitive experiments in interspecies breeding. Just as Amy represents the good gorilla of contemporary literature, the gray apes represent the fearsome and brutal ape of legend and folk tale--with a typical Crichton twist or two. First, except when their boundaries are threatened, the gray apes are typical peace-loving and family-oriented gorillas. And, second, what will be the effect on the culture of the mountain gorilla when Amy's offspring, fathered by wild gorillas and taught by their mother to sign, interbreed with other wild gorillas and signing becomes part of their culture? Or, indeed, what will happen 'when circumstances may force some human beings to communicate with [nonhuman] primate society on its own terms. Only then human beings will become aware of their complacent egotism with regard to other animals'\n\n(253). 1980 The Hairy Ape --based on Eugene O'Neill's play of the same name, the film isn't literally about an ape but about a man with ape-like physical characteristics.

New York: Farrar, Strauss & Giroux.\n\nA paleontologist, Calvin Cohn, emerges from undersea research to find himselfdue to what he sees as a minuscule error of God, the only human survivor of a thermo-nuclear war. He shares his ship, the Rebekah Q, only with a chimpanzee trained to speak through a device in his throat by a German scientist who named him Gottlob. Cohn renames him Buz. When the ship drifts an island, Buz becomes a cynical Friday to Cohn's Robinson Crusoe. Unlike the original pair, Cohn and Buz find the island inhabited by apes who somehow have survived the nuclear blast. They start learning speech from Buz and Cohn and, of course, are given names as they begin to play roles in this interspecies survival allegory. Especially significant are the albino ape, a large white, nameless chimp who seems evocative (as is the name of the boat) of Melville's white whale; the mysterious and funny George, a gorilla who fails to speak but learns to listen and is drawn to the recorded prayer chants of Cohn's rabbi father; and Mary Madelyn, the only surviving female, a young chimp who falls in love with Cohn and becomes his mate.

Startide Rising: An Uplift Novel . New York: Bantam.\n\nAlthough, as in Sundiver (1980), only one chimpanzee character appears, Charles Dart, a paleontologist, holds his own among Brin's neodolphins, humans, and other less familiar galactic citizens. He is a more central and complex character than Dr. Jeffrey, although their shared characteristics mark each as markedly chimpanzee despite their genetic enhancing. Dart, unlike Jeffrey, can speak (\"At his best, Charles Dart sounded like a man speaking with gravel in his throat. Sometimes, when he had something complicated to say, he unconsciously moved his hands in the sign language of his youth\"--73). Not a particularly sympathetic character as are most of Brin's chims and neo-chimpanzees, he is obsessed with his work and his self-importance.\n\nWhile the crew of the Streaker struggles to avoid detection by other galactics in the seas of Kithrup, Dart wants only to explore the subduction zone he has discovered on the planet. In order to reach the depths of the subduction, he plans to split it open with a small A-Bomb, thus endangering the indiginous life on the planet as well as his own crewmates. His determination to have his work recognized as being \"on a par with any human!\" comes from a sense of ultimate rejection as a scholar. Once he had reached what he had thought of as success--memberships in \"all the right professional societies,\" enthusiastic responses to the papers he presented on earthquake activity in Chile, California, and Italy; and good job offers, it came to him that much of what he'd assumed was acceptance was \"tokenism.\" And that, plus plain old fashioned speciesism, explained why no graduate students sought to study with him when his human colleagues were overwhelmed with eager candidates (397). This may be Brin's way of suggesting some of the problems to be faced should chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas be acknowledged as the equals of humans in our own time.\n\n1983 Mr. Smith TV series featuring a talking orangutan. (Balaban)\n\n1984 Angela Carter. Nights at the Circus .\n\nFeatures Lamark's Educated Apes, a dozen chimpanzees, dressed and seated at desks, while another, dressed as the professor, teaches the class. Unaware that they are being observed, the apes are in fact in charge of their own behavior and are engaged in discussing a diagram the professor has placed on the blackboard. When the clown Walser, the human observer, is himself observed by the apes, the professor quickly erases the diagram and the group indulge in the antics humans expect of monkeys. The professor quickly puts dunce caps on all, including Walser. As he does so, [t]heir eyes met.\n\nWalser never forgot this first, intimate exchange with one of these beings whose life ran parallel to his, this inhabitant of the magic circle of difference, unreachable but not unknowable; this exchange with the speaking eyes of the dumb. It was like the clearing of a haze. Then the Professor, as if acknowledging their meeting across the gulf of strangeness, pressed his tough forefinger down on Walser's painted smile, bidding him be silent (quoted in Adcock and Simms 220).\n\n1984 Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes .\n\nThe 1984 film ... alters Burroughs' narrative extensively and yet recaptures some of its original potential to consider radical change. The most remarkable part of the movie is its opening--long sequences without language that show Tarzan being raised by apes and entering into intimate, loving relations with them. This Tarzan, on screen for long periods of time, acts completely within ape norms. He believes apes worthy of respect, love, fear, and consideration (as we all believe 'our kind' worthy). And his early patterns reassert themselves even after he has learned English speech and customs and assumed his role as heir to the Greystoke fortune.\n\nThe movie's turning point (borrowed, perhaps, from a similar scene in The Son of Tarzan ) comes when Tarzan finds his stepfather among the apes brutalized in scientific experiments and helps him to escape. When the ape is killed by policemen, Tarzan's commitment to English culture vanishes; knowing this, Jane releases him back to Africa, and we last see him reentering the forest to rejoin the apes among whom he was reared. This Tarzan has learned the only serious lesson Burroughs was ever willing to draw from his Tarzan series: the lesson that man alone among living creatures kills wantonly and that comparisons between men and beasts often insult the latter.\n\nThe film's animal sequences stress what has always been an essential component of the Tarzan stories--ultimate harmony between humans and animals, human and nature, without troubling relations of hierarchy and Otherness. In these sequences (as at moments in the Tarzan series) Tarzan talks to the animals and has friends among them. Like the animals, he lives by clear-cut rules. Wanton killing is unknown, except when male apes go berserk, as they occasionally do. Males and females known their places and the duties appropriate to their gender; species keep their distance. But the sequences need to amplify on what is actually found in the texts of the Tarzan novels....oneness with animals and with nature is only brief and intermittent in the Tarzan stories and does not drive their plots as his relations with Europeans, Africans, women, and various Others do. In the novels, Tarzan does return to the apes or go off into nature alone several times, but always to realize that he can't go home again.... The film is useful in pointing out alternative possibilities in the Tarzan story, possibilities that the novels themselves were unable or unwilling to fully explore. The harmony the film's animal sequences invoke is a vision of seamless unities very much a part of postmodernism's melange of views and desires concerning the primitive--a seamless unity we sometimes project onto primitive life but have difficulty either finding, or documenting, or preserving within our own culture. If the film is true to its utopian impulses, this film (unlike earlier Tarzan films) will have no sequel, for Tarzan will have passed through and beyond the social systems humans have made. (Torgovnick 71-72)\n\nPeterson calls Greystoke a \"reasonably realistic film about apes\" which emphasizes psychological continuity and raises the image of interspecies communication.\" Partly filmed in Camaroon, the adult gorilla characters \"were actually humans in multimillion dollar sculpted outfits that included mechanized and sometimes remote-controlled parts (eyes, for example).\" The baby gorillas were chimpanzees with added fur!

New York: Harper Collins,\n\n1984 A Summer to Remember (based on 1976 Rawls' novel).\n\nThe friendship between a deaf boy (Justin Gerlis) and an orangutan is established through sign language. Good supporting cast: James Farantino, Tess Harper, Louise Fletcher.\n\n1985 Carol Hill. The Eleven Million Mile High Dancer. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston.\n\nAlthough the novel's main characters are a human, Amanda Jaworski, \"a sexy subparticle physicist and 'America's leading lady astronaut'\" and her beloved cat, Schrodinger (who is, indeed, alive and dead at exactly the same time!)--and who is, according to Washington Post reviewer Grace Lichtenstein, \"perhaps the best-realized animal in recent popular fiction,\" the brainy chimp 342 is also a fully and realistically realized character who plays a crucial role in the novel's theme and plot. He recalls the chimps used in NASA space experiments as he and Amanda--\"'sponsored by the entire military establishment of the United States and utilizing all of technology'\"--chase to the moon after Schroedinger. They are finally successful, not because of military might and technology, but because they are protected by \"a young boy and a magic ring..and by the cat\" himself (Lichtenstein 6).\n\n1985 Lillian Hoban. Arthur'a Loose Tooth . New York: Harper Collins.\n\n1986 Timothy Findley (Canadian). Not Wanted on the Voyage . New York: Delacourt.\n\nFindley's novel tells the story of Noah's Ark from the point of view of those creatures Noah did not include among the clean animals. Narrated by his wife's blind cat, who is one of the unwanted, events lead inexorably to the reader's discovery that, far from saving the world, the voyage destroyed what was valuable in the world--enchantment, the unicorn, fairies, and man's sense of unity with the rest of creation. The apes here are the children of Noah and his wife and sons and daughters-in-law who are throwbacks to the evolutionary past they have come to deny. Rather than being bestial, these children are peaceful and loving. And are born under a death sentence, for Noah has decreed that each one shall be destroyed at birth, an order Mrs. Noah has ignored now and then, putting her into the camp of the unwanted along with the cat her husband, the master scientist and rationalist, blinded in an experiment.\n\n1986 King Kong Lives\n\n1986 Link (British)\n\n\"Good chimp/bad chimp. Primatologist [Terence Stamp] experiments on chimps [like Voodoo and Imp as well as on the orangutan, Link] , and activities get out of hand. A horror film that misses being horrifying, suspenseful, or entertaining\" (Maltin).\n\n1986 Max, Mon Amour . Director Nagisa Oshima.\n\nA very refined British diplomat in Paris discovers his bored wife (Charlotte Rampling) has become involved with Max, who happens to be a chimpanzee. Instead of being upset, the husband decides Max should live with them. Very strange ménage a trios manages to avoid the obvious vulgarities. In French with English subtitles (VideoHound's Golden 559).\n\n1987 David Brin. The Uplift War . Bantam.\n\nGenetically enhanced Chimps and Gorillas appear as major characters in this novel dedicated to Jane Goodall, Sarah Hrdy, and Dian Fossey. The chims here are fully the equals of their human patrons and have themselves been instrumental in uplifting gorillas on the planet Garth. Unlike the chims, the gorillas (like Quinn's Ishmael) choose not to remain a client species, preferring to take charge of their own evolution and remain much as they have been in their native habitats on planet Earth. This forces the human protagonist to acknowledge that gorillas \"were not just big chims but a completely different race, another path taken. A separate route to sentience\" (329). Even the chims question (as do the neodolphins in other Uplift novels) whether Uplift \"had really been such a good idea , making engineers, poets and part-time ecologists, starfighters, galactic sociologists out of chimps who might prefer to stay in the forest free to scratch an itch whenever he damned well pleased\" (37). Although this is an important theme throughout Brin's work, there is another that is even more central. At the end of the novel, chim Gailet Jones offers an insight that is repeated in the author's Postscript (637):\n\nOur own petty lives, our species, even our clan, feel terribly important , but what are they next to this [the flourishing of, in this case, the previously fallow planet Garth]? This nursery of creation? This was worth fighting for.\" (634-5)\n\n1987 R. A. Lafferty. Serpent's Egg . Morrigan Press; Wildside Press, 2003.\n\nIn 2035 the world is populated by computers, smart apes, humans, and talking animals of all species. From this mix, 3, then 12 genius children, only a few human, emerge. Does one of them contain the serpent's egg that will save or destroy the world?\n\n1987 Terry Pratchett. The Light Fantastic . London: Collin Smythe.\n\nDr. Horace Worblehat, a member of a small elite group of senior Librarians of Disk World's Unseen University. He (thereafter called the Librarian) is transformed by a magic spell into a large male orangutan and, discovering that being an orangutan has certain advantages to a librarian, he refused to be transformed back into a human, and has remained an orangutan ever since ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Librarian_(Discworld) ). [H]e has shown considerable interest in the arts, both as a patron and performer and often participates directly, indirectly, or tangentially in the many strange adventure that occur in Terry Practhett's novels (Gwyn 2). He is able to travel through L-space and is an on-going player. He plays major roles in Sourcery , Guards! Guards! , Moving Pictures , Small Gods , Lords and Ladies , Men at Arms , Soul Music , Interesting Times , Maskerade , Hogfather , The Last Continent , The Last Hero , Night Watch , Thud! , and the Diskworld computer game.
