        "text": "Magnus Rawstron\n\n2014\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nThere are many prophecies that predict aspects of the Age of Aquarius. One of such has undergone interpreted definition of many forms, the one that predicts a new conscious awareness arising. Not one interpretation I read was correct in its definition, but Ive been saying since the late 70s that humanity will become telepathic sentient beings before stepping into a golden era.\n\nIts always best not trying to interpret prophecies; comparison to past events is the best way to define them. My scientifically, independently and communally proven telepathic abilities are one set of circumstances that can be compared to the prophecy of a new conscious awareness, and then seen to be almost identical.\n\nThen there are the prophecies of God, the Gods, Angels, etc. and a historical worker of God returning to earth, to help and guide humanity where need be, and yet again these prophecies can be compared to my life and then seen to be almost identical.\n\nMost of the prophecies are truthful accounts of the future, they not being esoteric, then with some in the least there can be found an element of truth, thats too big a claim for any person to make, unless like I they were speaking from experience. Humanity has become obsessed with interpreting prophecy, obsessed to the point that there are now that many definitions the precise original messages have been lost, and the original ones that do still exist many have been mistaken as defining something other than what they do.\n\nI didnt read the prophecies then try and live my life accordingly; it was the other way around, I first read prophecies after I had already fulfilled most of them, with the exception of one.\n\nThe Piscean Age of individual freewill is coming to an end, and all of humanity will become telepathic.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTesting Of My Telepathic And Psychic Abilities\n\nThe above advertisement appeared in 1998, within a supernaturally concerned magazine, it being Marshall Cavendishs X-Factor, well to be precise its supplementary document given for free in every other edition of that magazine. Sorry on the poor quality of the copy above, I wanted to use the original advertisement and my limited computer program has messed things up a bit.\n\nThat was a previous address; I dont live there now, and I sometimes use my first given surname, hence my surname in this site as being my legal one of Rawstron, then in the advertisement above were using my original surname.\n\nI received one reply, maybe I didnt word the advertisement correctly, Im uneducated through no fault of my own and back then I wasnt able to write as I can now.\n\nNow in 2011 I looking for people to prove these abilities too has gone on for more than a decade, Ive been tested only once and I was successful in proving my telepathic abilities. Only one time was a group prepared to test me, despite in separate circumstances contacting sceptical, atheist, news, media and scientific groups.\n\nI received only one reply, from an investigator of the paranormal and I did prove telepathy to her within a few tests. I scored 11 out of 11 correct answers, then I ended the test due to her searching around the room for a cheating gadget, such as a mirror, and she was thinking along the lines that I must have been cheating.\n\nShe had hand cut pieces of paper with one symbol drawn onto each, 6 different symbols and 5 cards of each. I scored with my first attempts 11 out of 11 correct answers. For the first 5 she held the cards and I read her mind, for the remaining 6 I held the cards and let her read my mind. The odds of me scoring 11 out of 11 by chance are millions to one.\n\nAfter she had reported to other members of their paranormal investigating group I was asked if Id liked to join, which I did but they made me sign a contract that stated Im under no circumstances allowed to talk or tell other people about anything we get up too, so Im sorry that I cannot name their group for you here. Ive checked the Internet for their group and it doesnt still exist, but the contract I signed may so I wont go against that. My telling you about the contract, their group and their testing of me doesnt go against that contract, but it does if I name who they were.\n\nMy telepathic abilities are very easily experienced by all people who know of them, you only have to get close to my home and you will experience such, I live on Gillibrand Street in Darwen, Lancashire.\n\nI was for a time trying to gain inclusion into a fair test within the James Randi one million dollar psychic challenge, but was given replies of either total disbelief or plain and simple replies not to let me enter their challenge.\n\nJames Randi was an on-stage illusionist before renaming himself a paranormal investigator, his profession was failing because we all now know magicians are just tricksters, so he renamed himself a paranormal investigator and created the illusion he cannot find evidence of the psychic and supernatural, his way of creating a unique selling point to keep with earning from his failing profession. He wanted to be a great trickster but he couldnt do it with normal illusions, so had to take a different path, but his tricking of humanity with his fake one million dollar psychic challenge is a lowly dirty trick.\n\nJames isnt a paranormal investigator; hes a paranormal debunker and not a very good one.\n\nIve also been in contact with the association of sceptical enquiry (ASKE) because they also had a prized challenge concerning psychic abilities. The first email I received from them stated I was mentally deluded in some way, and in the second email they told me more than 80% correct answers from a collection of 125 questions would be necessary for a pass in full. Replying I said thats extreme and only 80% from a collection of 25 questions is scientifically acceptable as a pass, which they only commented back in vague, un-professional and childish ways. Again like the James Randi foundation they like to protect their cash prize by only allowing people to enter whom they believe will fail, or people whom they make sure will fail. Just like James Randi, making a public name for themselves with unproven, unscientific biased theories and opinions.\n\nTo enter the James Randi challenge people have to pay him to come to them, that isnt scientific, money isnt an obstacle for scientific discovery but for James it is.\n\nIn 2009 I contacted 4 science magazines, many science groups and many media and news outlets. I asked the science magazines if they would at the cost of myself (if I fail testing) test me, or if they knew who would test me, or if they know where I should advertise this major leap forward in human conscious awareness. Only one replied, they said they dont have the facilities or time to undergo scientific research.\n\nASKE stated they will test me but never got back in touch, so are like James Randi in being intentionally un-scientific and biased in protecting their fake cash challenges and the publicity that generates.\n\nEven the Australian sceptics wouldnt allow me to enter their own prized psychic challenge and all based upon them not believing my claims. If these were true prized psychic challenges why are they afraid to test me? It doesnt make any sense, unless we consider that they dont want to be proven wrong and do want to protect their prize.\n\nAll scientists of great achievements believed in unknowns, but these paranormal debunkers dont consider that, they believe in their own belief structure and which is not scientific proven or based in any way. They believe the psychic and supernatural doesnt exist but have cash prizes for any person who can prove such! Why do they have prized psychic challenges when they dont even believe its possible? It doesnt make any sense, what is their goal? Do they have a goal? Offering a prize for what they dont believe is possible surely is enough evidence for most people to realise they are not what they are portraying themselves as.\n\nSurely if they want to prove the existence of the psychic then they should also run online psychic testing.\n\nIve given successful results in many tests of my psychic abilities. My brother tested me with a scientific test for telepathy, I found the details of such within X-Factor magazine, and I scored 16 or 17 out of 20.\n\nPeople have even discussed my telepathic abilities within national television broadcasts, speaking of some of their own experiences with my telepathic abilities. When I mentioned this in an online chat room, one with many sceptical atheists shouting their blind faith about the supernatural not existing, they replied with statements to the effect that I must have either hallucinated or lied about it. That is because sceptical atheists consider everything, except that their scepticism could be wrong.\n\nWhat with James Randi and the others naming themselves paranormal investigators youd have thought theyd have given enough time and effort to check me out for telepathy, because many parts of the entertainment industry checked me out for that and quickly realised I am telepathic. I reckon they should give their prizes to charity, because it is obvious to all people who check me out that I am telepathic.\n\nWhen I took an online psychic test with the Edgar Cayce foundation, within the test what will the picture be my first answer was, a public building, a museum, with scrollwork, and the Eiffel Tower was the picture. My next test I said a wooden home surrounded by trees by the side of a lake, being dark, and it was a forest, lake and wooden fence in night time. Next I said a television with a view on the screen; it was a square window viewing out into a garden. Next I said food and some guy canoeing was the next picture, so that was my first incorrect answer. My score started falling, getting the next image incorrect too, so I switched tests to guess where the X will appear on the screen, I was always within an inch and with more than 5 tests, which got my score up to approximately 87% correct answers from more than 10 questions. I was only third on their scoreboard, with first place 97% from one question, and second place something like 93% from two questions. I should have been at the top of the scoreboard, because the odds of someone getting 87% from more than 10 questions are far higher than the odds of those in first and second place.\n\nBefore leaving their website I left this next message, if you have friends and family working or living in New York get them out soon, because that river of fire Edgar Cayce predicted for New York is soon to occur.Do sceptics really believe I would lie about that? And it would have been a good thing for many people to get out of New York then; due to the microscopic asbestos particles hanging in the air for weeks after the twin towers were demolished, and that day occurred within 12 months of my prediction.\n\nIf my test and message claims were untrue the Edgar Cayce Foundation would publicise them as being untrue.\n\nPlease dont think these were the only people I predicted 9/11 too, I also predicted it to UK Police, in fine detail, giving them more than enough information to help them prevent it, but is of a set of circumstances I cant explain in this book.\n\n*****\n\nWhile trying to find some employment, during a meeting I had with 3 management persons of a construction firm I approached on spec. on a construction site, I told the 3 men present that brick and stone restoration/pointing was my main trade, which then prompted one man to say,  Are you psychic or what? I replied I was and then wondered why he said this, before realising the 3 of them had just been pricing and costing a pointing job a customer of theirs wanted them to undertake. This I realised had just been occurring to the back and outside of the wall situated behind me, that I knew because I saw pictures in my mind of the 3 men doing precisely that, weighing the job up for costing. And in areas of the building site my eyes couldnt see and I had never seen that area before. I verbally told them I knew theyd just been checking, pricing and surveying a possible pointing job on the back wall and also said I was telepathic, which is how I knew what theyd just been doing. One then said that if Im telepathic Id be able to guess correctly their names, so I gave it a try. I pointed at the man on the left and said youre Paul, then pointing at the next and naming him as Carl, the last I pointed at I called him Kieran. He then asked to try again with him, so I did and spoke the name of Kevin, which all 3 of them just stood silent and never spoke or moved for a few seconds more. He then added by saying, Im Kelvin, so then there was another brief quiet moment in the conversation.\n\nIt wasnt coincidental I turned up on site a few minutes after theyd been pricing a pointing job, Id seen the site weeks and months earlier but decided the time wasnt right to go and ask for work.\n\nWith me telepathy is more than what other people have claimed of their own similar abilities or experiences, with me its permanently turned on and permanently two way, and works with everything from me to others and them to me, I.E. as pictures of the mind, thoughts of language and on rare occasions people seeing pictures in their mind of what I see with normal eye vision. It also works with senses and emotions.\n\nWith me telepathy is more than what other people have claimed of their own similar abilities or experiences, with me its permanently turned on and permanently two way, and works with everything from me to others and them to me, I.E. as pictures of the mind, thoughts of language and on rare occasions people seeing pictures in their mind of what I see with normal eye vision. It also works with senses and emotions.\n\nI really can hold conversations with people in these ways; next is part of a conversation I had back in the early 90s.\n\nIm telepathic, thats why such occurred.\n\nIf youre telepathic what am I thinking now then?\n\nDo you mind me swearing?\n\nNo.\n\nYou just thought then; youre full of chit.\n\nThat was a lucky guess.\n\nIve just read your mind and you know it.\n\nOK what am I thinking now then?\n\nYou just thought the same thing.\n\nNo I didnt, I added a word.\n\nI know you added a word, you added the word really, you just thought then, youre really full of chit.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nIm telepathic, (long pause in the conversation) has it not sunk in yet? My last remark was influenced into being because she had thought it hasnt sunk in yet, at the time I thought were my thoughts, telepathy can be quite confusing at times, even now when Im 42 I still sometimes find it hard to know which are my thoughts and which are other peoples.\n\nI next verbally told her, Im Agnus Dei, not far from Magnus is it? (When I didnt know what Agnus Dei defined precisely, all I knew was that it was a reference of my name, Magnus.)\n\nShe replied with, Youre crazy.\n\nLook me in the eye, then I put these thoughts into her own a couple of seconds before verbally speaking the same, the way Ive just read your mind, then next doing the same with, do you doubt I can change the world?\n\nI dont doubt for one minute you can change the world and just with telepathy alone, and you know why Ive just said that dont you?\n\nCourse I do, what I verbally spoke back then you heard in your thoughts seconds before I verbally spoke it.\n\nHow are you able to do this?\n\nMy soul is a part of yours, like it is a part of every ones. She should have known about these my abilities and claims when we were 12, but people in her family intercepted the letter, then twisted her to evil soon after. The first civilian I tried to turn to my ways, although back then I didnt know she had royal links and royal guards, back in 84 and she later became my worst enemy, this moment when she learning of my claims and abilities the early 90s.\n\nI was never expecting my telepathic abilities to become as much as they did, where conversations can be held in such ways, and its hard to believe if only reading about it, but it really does occur to these levels with I. And it does have its problems, such as being on all the time so near enough anything or anyone can get in at certain times.\n\nThis was long before any person in my life learnt of my supernatural associations and claims; I didnt want to make them claims so never did, although I had to a few government linked persons and one teacher. I didnt want to make claims that people may not believe, so no one back then learnt of them, although the supernatural making sure that some Authorities persons knew of me from an earlier age.\n\nNow when looking back at how easily I convinced her of my telepathic abilities I could have made my claims in public long before I did in 2002, as the only thing that seemed to be off-putting me were/would be the sceptics that would appear. Although after considering everything I come to the conclusion that my supernatural origin friends have had me living out their plan.\n\nEven from within live television broadcasts my telepathic abilities can be experienced by the people watching, and the other way around it also works, where when Im watching a live broadcast its crew or people in the frame also experience my telepathic abilities. When it occurred in about the year 2001 I had shrugged it off as not being what had occurred.\n\nI was watching a cup final in football, where an ex-Bury player was in one of the teams. He knew of my telepathic presence and was reacting to it, the only person at the final who did notice my presence, the same player whom I saw checking me out for telepathy years earlier when working at Bury F.C. When not many people in football knew of me and none in film and television.\n\nThis moment was what I initially believed to be the first instance of such, and then when writing the other book recalled the moment when a primary school kid and doing it to an English government person seen within a live television broadcast. The supernatural pretending their thoughts to be my own, encouraging me to telepathically speak my mind to him, so I tried and to my astonishment he reacted to it. Giving a live interview he suddenly went quiet with an expressionless look on his face, staring at me in shock through the camera, then moving out of shot to behind the scenes. It scared me so I never tried it again after that, and preferred to believe that it didnt occur, I didnt even want to think about it.\n\nAnd then it occurred again when I was about 17 years old, and again it scared me so tried not to believe or think of it. Again it was my supernatural contacts who telepathically instructed me to try, this time to telepathically control a newsreader to do something out of character, certain body movements which she then did.\n\n4 or 5 times around those times in my teens I also connected telepathically with Uri Geller, every time I saw him in a live television broadcast giving displays of his own telepathic abilities. It didnt shock or scare me when it occurred with him, possibly because I was putting it off as his own telepathic abilities that my own were connecting with.\n\nParanormal investigators offering cash prizes are not what they appear as, they are paranormal debunkers looking for public recognition, they are not investigators. If they investigated me, like how many thousands of people have they would notice Im telepathic.\n\nMay be people who have experienced my telepathic abilities should send them an email or 2, to explain how they have experienced my telepathic abilities. They call themselves paranormal investigators and many investigators do rely upon witness information, so it would be rightful they receive information of my abilities by independent witnesses.\n\nFrench scientists took James up on his challenge and they said he was acting clown-like and creating an absurd atmosphere, that's because he was disguising his trickery in tampering with test results. Hes an illusionist and has the expertise to tamper with test results while no person notices his trickery.\n\nIve read a journalists newspaper report that said James Randis test confines are too hard for any person to pass, and when people claiming to be telepathic took his prelim tests he wouldnt let them sit in the same room as the person whose thoughts they were to read. When did James become an expert on telepathy to be able to say for a pass to be proven scientifically target people and telepathic people have to sit in different rooms? Im an expert with telepathy, for the test to be successful the person would have to be sitting in the same room as the target person, if otherwise they cant concentrate correctly on the person they are to read.\n\nOffering myself for testing began in 1998 and I have a 100% success rate in proving myself this way, my telepathic abilities have been getting mentions in national television programs, so if I end up getting into some myself, some live broadcasts, the people watching will experience my telepathic abilities, itll be for the people watching the same as people who have experienced it when close to me. It being so prominent that it is much harder to disbelieve than believe.\n\nA UFO group tested me, days before the testing I told them all people have to be drug free totally, and when I got there they were all drinking alcohol except for one person, and she was the only person who experienced the telepathic in me.\n\nTelepathy is a scientific fact nowadays, even a team of UC Irvine scientists has been awarded a $4 million grant from the U.S. Army Research Office, to study the neuroscientific and signal-processing foundations of synthetic telepathy, another shameful set of principles the corrupted beyond all others US government stand by. They know telepathy exists and their first action is to try and manipulate it to better their soldiers, thats going be another of their failures, because telepathy isnt a function of the brain, its of the soul. It would actually backfire on them if they did manage to make their soldiers telepathic, but I wont tell them how. So theres another $4 million of taxation that the US government has wasted.\n\nAnd Rupert Sheldrake, a professor of biology and author, has studied telepathy within the animal world and has successfully experimented with people and telepathy; he sees it as being a normal capability of the animal world, not a paranormal one. You can check the net for Ruperts scientific finds, and you can also check up on them UC Irvine scientists too.\n\nIts been scientifically proven many times, I recall watching an English television program about triplets, 3 brothers they put in different rooms and with technology proved some sort of electrical connection between the three atheists. Even Dr Alejandro Riera and Dr Michel Berg scientifically proved thoughts can be transmitted telepathically. News reports about them 2 Drs also said the possibilities of telepathy are endless, maybe thats why I find it so hard to finish this book, because I can always think of some other experience to add.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNoticed By Dolphins\n\nPeople noticing my telepathic abilities before I informed them of the same usually only ever occurred when spending long amounts of time with people, such as neighbours and some girlfriends, people in family didnt notice because they were always busy and already on a similar wavelength as myself. As a child no one but who I told noticed, except for 2 groups of people. One being a group dolphins, they actually noticed my telepathic abilities before myself. I did beforehand know to be in telepathic connections with unknown origin life forms, but had no idea it also worked with all other life due to being one of my own abilities.\n\nI was close to 6 years old when noticing these dolphins connect with me via telepathy. There was my brother, sister, mum and dad present, we were attending a show of the dolphins at the sea life centre, Morecambe, Lancashire. We took our seating in the middle rows, then waited for the show to begin whilst chatting among ourselves. Before it began there were 3 or 4 instructors and 3 dolphins in the pool, preparing for the show to begin.\n\nDuring a minute or two of waiting I sensed something overcome me, something that was attracting my attention but which I couldnt pinpoint what it was exactly. I looked all around myself but could pinpoint nothing and no person to be responsible, or anything concentrating on I that could be attributed to the generation of these strange thoughts and emotions. Next strange pictures flashed in my mind, of myself sat in the middle of the spectators, precisely as I was doing then. I again looked all around myself, trying to find where the strange thoughts and feelings were appearing from but still couldnt find an explanation. I looked at the dolphins once and considered it was they but then disregarded that possibility.\n\nA few minutes later and the show had begun, then the pictures in my mind of me in the middle of the spectators returned, only this time were followed by a sentence of thoughts that said, thats the view the dolphins have of you! who would have been one of my supernatural contacts explaining things for me. I immediately looked to check the dolphins then noticing the closest to me and which seemed to be looking me in the eye. It was situated directly in front of myself, as soon as I realised it was in fact connecting with me in telepathic ways, pictures in my mind appeared a few times of each of us being precisely where we were, then a second or two later it generated excited and very happy emotions, so I was now happy too, whereas before I felt a bit baffled due to not knowing what or who was connecting with me. I felt its emotions immediately build up to an excited and elated state as soon as I realised it was the dolphin Im connecting with, then next it swam off as fast as possible and deep to the bottom of the pool, when previous to this moment it was just wading water with its head above the waterline. I could feel its excited emotions while it was swimming fast around the pool bottom, it also felt like it wanted me to know he or she was excited due to connecting and being close to me, and thats why it was swimming around the pool bottom as fast as was possible. All the time both of us looking each other in the eye.\n\nIts keepers; those running the show were now looking very worried at each other, because it was ignoring their calls for it to return to the side of the pool near to where they were stood. They were looking very worried and across to each other because none of them could get it to do as it was told. It was swimming clockwise round the bottom of the pool and the entire time still looking me in the eye. When positioned directly in front of myself it swam straight up and performed a loop in the air, then swimming back down to the bottom of the pool to get ready for another. All the time it was still looking me in the eye, then when it performed its second loop in the air we were still looking each other in the eye, whilst it was in the air and when in the water. While all this was going on the trainers were still calling for it to return to themselves but it just ignored them and continued looking me in the eye.\n\nI noticed the trainers looking more and more worried because its actions were not part of the show, and still I could feel its excited and happy emotions.\n\nNext I thought about the angry looking keepers, then reluctantly and slowly it swam back to them, but still was looking me in the eye all the time. It definitely knew I had noticed the keepers getting more angry and annoyed because when I thought about what kind of punishment theyd hand out it immediately swam back, and after I saw in my mind a solitary confinement punishment with less food than usual. Whilst swimming to them the emotions I could feel were a bit wary of what punishment to expect, whilst also not being bothered by whatever they would hand out. So when the trainers then signalled it to return to the rear side pool and away from the show, audience and other dolphins it felt only a bit dismayed. As it swam towards the adjoining side pool entrance we continued to stare at each other, and by now the other 2 dolphins were looking me in the eye too. I was by now beginning to believe they were all concentrating towards me in telepathic ways.\n\nAt the time I thought it was their own telepathic abilities, took me a while to realise they were connecting with mine. For sure it seemed out of the ordinary for them to meet with a telepathic person, but they were not shocked or confused about experiencing telepathy, so beforehand they must have experienced it from some other source, possibly their own abilities.\n\nMany times its been suggested in literature about when there was an early era on earth when humans were able to hold conversations of language with dolphins, which seems to me to be very possible if considered in telepathic ways. Ive communicated via telepathy with people, spirits and many different species of animals, wild and domesticated, even insects and flies, although the last two mentioned was only ever with pictures of the mind or emotions. Many animals are surprised by telepathy in me, many others amazed, but some are shocked and then there are others that just see it as normal but not from a human.\n\nThe 2 remaining dolphins seemed like they were intermittently watching the misbehaving one, whilst also briefly looking at me, so they must also have known why it was ignoring the keepers signals and commands. And there werent many people in the crowd who noticed its actions were not a part of the show.\n\nClose to the end of the show this thought went through my mind, Watch this fellow, youll like this big fellow, then about 10 seconds later a killer whale, unannounced by the keepers or show guide swam into the main pool area then splashed every person sat in front of us, we only got a very light splashing, them sat in front of us got soaked. Im unsure if it was unannounced by the show guide but the only knowledge I had of its appearance beforehand was generated in my thoughts, no person told me it would be appearing and I never saw or read anything from the advertisements that said a killer whale would be in the show.\n\nIm sure the whale also knew of my telepathic abilities, when it swam into the main pool I was generating amazed emotions due to the thoughts that predicted the big fellows arrival, despite these amazed emotions I could feel the happy emotions of the whale totally overpower mine very easily. I could feel a massive happy feeling. I say massive because it felt like a larger than life emotion of happiness, a massive emotion in a massive energy sense. Surely a large bodied animal would generate emotions that have more power, volume, energy or whatever you wish to call it.\n\nWhen we left the show I wanted to tell family about connecting with the first dolphin in telepathic ways but prevented myself just before beginning too. Nobody would believe me, so my supernatural friends were influencing me in telepathic ways to avoid telling family about it, or any other supernatural aspects in my life, or telepathic ones. This was the normal for me during childhood, keeping quiet about my supernatural, psychic, telepathic and spiritual abilities and experiences. I told a few people within the UK authorities a couple of years later but was only a plan from my supernatural friends to make them wake up and realise there is something they cannot understand, control or duplicate.\n\n*****\n\nThe picture is of the Newquay, England, professional surf competition of 2005.\n\nIn the first 2 months of 2005 I tried to relay images in my mind to the minds of wild dolphins and whales. With myself knowing and experiencing telepathy not to be obstructed by distance, I knew many in the seas around Britain would see and hear my thoughts. I connected with one group of dolphins, via live remote viewing pictures, it being a kind of telepathy. And just like the dolphin at Morecambe, as soon as I saw these wild dolphins they became excited by my telepathic presence.\n\nI wasnt expecting anything else to occur, then a number of months later this occurred at Newquay, England, a place I have a few other stories to tell of my supernatural experiences. They gate crashed the professional surf competition and so Newquay, England isnt anymore seen by surf competitors as the tame leg of the world championship. It has occurred in a few other places but never did I hear of it occurring in Newquay beforehand. When something occurs with near enough everything I try through psychic, spiritual or telepathic ways its harder to disbelieve than to believe.\n\nFor them dolphins in captivity at the Morecambe sea life show to be the first animals to interact with me in those ways, then surely wild dolphins would know how best to reply to my attempts to communicate with their selves. They are far more intelligent and knowledgeable than we know or could ever know. The Newquay surf competition was probably the best place and time for any local wild dolphins to be given public coverage. So now Im trying to work out how they knew to be there then, which I reckon would be by knowing the surf competition would be there and then. How they knew that would be by being in telepathic connection with earth, Gaia, Holy Spirit or whatever else you want to call it. It knows everything of all life upon earth.\n\nThe supernatural life forms I am in close telepathic and physical contact with have many times made me realise I should always expect the unexpected with the supernatural, and this was another episode of how that is usually the case.\n\nAnd that wasnt the only unusual sea life activity of that year; a whale got stuck in Londons river, the Thames, only the second time in recorded history one has been seen there.\n\nI know at first glance it may appear as being unconnected, that is the whale in London and the dolphins in Newquay, but strange associations are always occurring with myself, although I dont see them as being strange, for it is easy for me to work out how it occurred.\n\nWith me being telepathic it cannot be coincidence, telepathic connections are always occurring, its massively recurring, so is not a coincidence. Wild and domesticated animals can connect with me in telepathic ways as easy as people can.\n\nThe dolphins at the sea life show definitely knew of my telepathic abilities, they were not surprised by them and they must have known of my rare and close associations with a kind of supernatural hierarchy, nothing else explains as good their actions and my experiences.\n\nIve watched wild life documentaries within television programs and have been convinced by animals actions and reactions that some are in fact telepathic with each other. Watching Gazelle grazing within one program one of their lookouts noticed a big cat stealthily approaching in long grass, and before it had been given time to make an alarm call for the rest of the herd to know of its presence they were all startled and also looking at it. And Ive seen many other wild and domesticated animals react to my telepathic abilities and to not be surprised or startled by them at all. They seem surprised Im telepathic but are not surprised by the telepathic itself.\n\nBack in the late 70s or early 80s farm sheep in either Australia or New Zealand had worked out to tuck their legs close to their bodies so to be able to roll over cattle grids, in the same year they were also doing it in Wales, England, the other side of the world. For sure I know from experience some animals are telepathically in-tune, some more so than that, which is probably how animals on opposite sides of the world can learn from each other.\n\nSome things that exist cannot be proven in scientific ways, as science only deals with the physical and then experience cannot be duplicated. But I can prove in scientific, communal and personal ways that Im telepathic, and with me being capable in those ways then Im not going to be the only life form on this planet that is such. Parts of the animal kingdom have been telepathic for as long as humanity have been here, and why they were telepathic long before humanity becomes such is easy to understand if you look at humanity on the whole. Telepathy was turned on in animals so to help them, it was turned off in humanity so to give us what we wanted, but it will be turned back on in humanity so to give us what the supernatural hierarchy wants of humanity, which is a new era based around the telepathic, psychic, supernatural and spiritual.\n\n*****\n\nThere was even a group of adults noticed my telepathic abilities, again when I was a very young kid, at a time when I hadnt noticed them abilities myself. I think it may have been before the moment with the dolphins at the sea life show, or possibly shortly after.\n\nI was less than 6 years old, there was myself, my brother, sister, mum and dad, we had gone for a day out to a few places, I cannot recall where we had been earlier in the day but at about 4pm we arrived at a country show, venued at Colderstones, near Preston. The kind of show with small fairground rides for kids, demonstrations, performances, traders, stalls and competitions, etc.\n\nAs soon as we entered the field I saw a group of 4 or 5 adults, one was pointing at me, they were on the other side of the field and it looked like they were waiting for something or someone. They ventured closer to us and kept looking at me, I thought it was a bit strange before concentrating on other matters. A few minutes later I saw them again, only this time there were more of them and much closer than before. The way they were looking at me scared me a bit, and with them being adults with Downs Syndrome I was also a bit confused, I was less than 6 years old. One woman stood where me and my family would have to pass her and she was staring me in the eye and smiling at me, I was scared though because I was very young and didnt know what was going on, then these thoughts ran through my mind, Weve been waiting for you all day, we thought you werent coming and now youre here. I had no idea I was telepathic back then so her thoughts just got thrown into my memory and I didnt react to her or her friends. Except for a few minutes later when we had to pass 3 of them staring at me, I was getting quite scared so held onto dads hand and tried not to look at them. They could sense they were scaring me a bit so split up into different groups of 2s and walked to different directions, and every now and then a group of 2 approaching and staying close to me.\n\nThey must have been informed by the spiritual that I would be there, they must also have been told of the historical significance of my life and my telepathic abilities, and also other aspects of myself, such as my ginger hair, I think that is what caught their attention first.\n\nBack then I think it was a few months later when first realising I would be publicly accepted sometime in the future, as being supernaturally able and psychic. I was 5 or 6 years old when first realising this lot, the same time when agreeing with the supernatural to let them do with me whatever they need of me to help humanity.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Wild Noticing Telepathy In Me\n\nOne night in 2002 I spent a night and morning in a wooded area of Yorkshire; as soon as the birds began to sing in the early hours of the morning whilst concentrating on them they concentrated back to me due to me whistling with them. While they were all singing pictures would enter my mind of many differing birds, one in particular kept repeating which was of a male Blackbird. As we concentrated on each other a closeness of emotions developed as well as with the other birds interest in me. I was picturing myself in my mind and pictures of them kept appearing there too, which was being transferred to each others thoughts via either my and or their own telepathic abilities. Then when beginning to feel slight disbelief towards the connections being real, and could or may be my imagination, a thought by my supernatural friends went through my mind that said this, Theyre sending that Blackbird to take a closer look at you! I didnt believe this thought premonition so began feeling slightly humoured by it, then replied with thoughts similar to the effect of,  yeah OK whatever, then a few seconds later a male Blackbird landed on the ground directly in front of me and less than 10 metres away. It stood looking at me for about 10 seconds then flew away, and I could hear him singing all the time till I left the area a few hours later.\n\nFor my unknown origin friends to make a statement in me of knowing the birds were sending him to check me out, then birds must communicate with other birds not of their own species, may be also in telepathic ways. Surely it would be more plausible they sent him to check me out via telepathic connections in picture forms instructing him too, it couldnt have been the thoughts in me that influenced him to do such, he was landing near me within 3 seconds of me knowing hed be there, therefore he must already have been on his way when thoughts told me of such. My supernatural friends would not lie to me on this level.\n\nOne humorous moment was when a Pheasant sent out a call from a nearby field, all the birds in the woods around me felt as though he was an outsider so went totally silent for close to 10 seconds. I felt a bit sorry for him; he seemed to want in on the birds singing and possibly with me via telepathic connections. I saw a picture in my mind of what he was doing and where he was, at the edge of another grouping of trees, on the edge of a field looking for food on the ground.\n\nAt one point I decided to act bird like for them. I stood up and stretched out my arms down behind my back, bird wing like, kind of twisted to and fro and bit, whistled back the same tune I had been whistling to them all morning, The Power Of Love, by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, whilst imaging in thoughts blue energies leaving my body and flowing towards them. As soon as I did that they went wild, their singing went louder, faster and more current, and there were more birds singing then than any other part of the visit. May be they were reacting to my bird stance by acting human like in being more noisy. There isnt anything unpredictable about normal everyday wild bird behaviour, they have their plans and routine and stick to them always, but they do see humans as being wild like, unpredictable and with out of control loud noise.\n\nI stood like a bird for about 15 seconds, the only time they went wild with their whistle volume and all of them joining in, then next sat back down close to the burnt out fire, made a drink then stayed listening to them for a while longer.\n\nThere were other strange things occurred during this visit. I arrived just before sunset, collected some fire wood, made a small camp fire, something to eat and drink then settled into my surroundings. Much later there was one moment when hearing tree branches bending towards me and another moment of similar with tree roots, I was also pretty sure I felt a tree root in the ground under my body move, but it wasnt just movement that was occurring, I could hear the creaking of its movement too.\n\nIn the middle of my sleep I awoke to feel something else moving under my body on the ground, I sat upright and found a mouse running away from the nest it had built under my body in the dead tree leaves. I didnt mistake the mouse for tree roots; I knew it was some kind of small rodent as soon as I felt it move.\n\nThis wasnt the first time I had witnessed tree branches moving in strange ways because of me. On another occasion my supernatural contacts telepathically telling me I could control the movement of the tree branches in a storm, back in I think 1991. My supernatural contacts got in touch with me via telepathy about it, I was led down on my bed late one night, Id just woke up and immediately thoughts told me this, Magnus, look outside at the storm. I couldnt hear it because music was playing, so I got out of bed, pulled back the curtains and saw there was a pretty strong rainstorm occurring.\n\nMy supernatural contacts then instructed me to try and make the tree branches bend towards myself via only the movement of my hands combined with will power, so I tried and to my astonishment it worked. I moved my hand towards my body in a slow, beckoning over here movement, and when I did all the tree branches bent towards me and which was out of synch with the strong wind that was occurring. The wind blew to its strongest but the tree branches didnt move, only when I moved my hand towards my body did they bend towards me, and at the same time the wind had died down to a minimum. For more than a minute I tried more of this and was successful with every attempt. And every time the branches began to bend towards me the wind died down to a minimum from being very strong. The trees on the edge of Clarence Park, Bury, at the side of Royal Avenue.\n\nImmediately afterwards I led down on my bed and being totally amazed and astonished but also not knowing how such was possible. Thats when my supernatural origin friends came back to my thoughts and told me this, Youre always telepathically open and with all life, and that includes the environment, trees and other plants, because they too are an intelligent being. They also began reminding me about being the man mentioned within prophecies, but I was having major problems accepting it then, I was only 19 years old, I believed in it but didnt want to accept it, so in thoughts told my supernatural contacts to stop talking about it, they wouldnt immediately but when seeing me getting stressed out left me be to go back to sleep.\n\nSome years earlier, close to 5, I walked up to a strange looking toadstool because Id never seen one before, touched it and it moved. Its head was flat before being touched, horizontal and out-stretched, as soon as I touched it softly, with one finger tip, it closed its head tight up to its stem in one very fast movement, less than half a second it took to close. For sure I surprised it and for sure it was trying to protect itself from being broken by making its head surface area much smaller. I jumped back in fright then saw images in my mind of it being broken, via a telepathic connection we had.\n\nThis could not have been anything other than what I claim it to have been. Some people reckon it could have been a time lapse, where I lost a short amount of time therefore incorrectly analysed the situation. If it had been a time lapse Id have been late getting back to school, but that never occurred, I was back at school on time. Close to Ruskins View, Kirkby Lonsdale.\n\nFor some reason it never knew I was there until I touched it, where as usually it would know of all close by animals. Plants see with live remote viewing, like how spirits see that way too. In separate moments Ive seen wild animals not noticing my presence and when stood only a few feet from me. Ive also had quite a few moments of sensing mushrooms, fungus and toadstools knowing whats going on around and to themselves, may be plants can do the same, Ive seen it of trees so why not other plants? But please dont imagine I talk to plants because I dont and I dont need too, they see, feel and hear what my soul does, like how people experience of me too.\n\nPlants and trees bend and turn towards receiving light and warmth and so will also know to move away from cold, but only slowly with their branches, stems, flowers and heads are they known to do this. I saw and felt that toadstool change stance in a very fast way due to being touched, Ive felt, heard and seen tree branches or roots moving in strange ways so it must be a case of they only do it in rare moments.\n\nIve had a few other strange moments with plants, one being where one just seemed to have moved on its own, one that it is said in legends can move to areas it prefers.\n\nOne evening I watched a science program where a man wired two trees up to an electrical pulse reading device, as soon as he got an axe out of his bag they both went wild with electrical pulses, even more so when hitting one of them.\n\nWhen driving through the Scottish Highlands, on a motorway in medium traffic, immediately when seeing a Golden Eagle stood on the grass embankment, it turned to look at me and stared at me all the time it could see me. I hardly turned my head to look at it, and there were many cars before and after myself. It was clawing and pecking at something near its feet in the long grass, as soon as I saw it looked up and at me.\n\nIve seen similar occur with myself many other times too, where Id be walking somewhere and something would make me turn my head to look behind myself and then Id see someone significant in my life staring at myself.\n\nOne afternoon when in my garden I found a Bee that was on the ground, walking, due to being unable to fly. I picked it up, took indoors and placed near to a lamp so it could warm itself from the bulb. I was feeding it on Blackcurrant and Liquorice syrup, it nearly drowned itself in it, I woke up one morning and it was upside down with its head stuck in it. For the few days it managed to stay alive, when trying to connect with it in telepathic ways I could see in my mind what it saw with its vision, it was seeing everything in the blue light spectrum, all of its vision being different shades of blue or nearly black, and it also saw in its mind what I saw with my vision.\n\nWithin 12 hours of writing about the Bee seeing in the blue light spectrum I checked the internet for blue light spectrum, found a page in Wikipedia, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) it detailed saying Bees can see ultraviolet light, which is one established term for blue light spectrum. It occurs constantly this, that I experience something of the supernatural, then later when looking deeper into that circumstance, or information of, I find only reassurance that I was correct. The Wikipedia page said that they are able to see ultraviolet light, whereas I disagree and say they see only ultraviolet light.\n\nI wouldnt advise anyone to take Bees into their home, for this one spread its lice into my carpets, 7 years later and living in a different home I still see them every now and then.\n\nI can jokingly blame Lenny Williams on that one; I was 7 when he was showing me how Bees and Wasps are not to be feared. Joannes dad, her mums victim, my new spirit guide, along with 2 more of their victims. He wanted his name on my new book, a partnership in writing, will just mention it here instead.\n\nWhilst working on a new build church extension of St Laurences Church, Chorley, back in the late 90s, I definitely connected with the emotions of two baby white Doves, so now I expect to be able to do the same with any thought and emotion generating life form, although I dont try too much as its just normal every day for me.\n\nA colleague had just shook to the extreme a small tree that had 2 baby white Doves squealing from, within a nest, intentionally shaking it because Id just commented about the chicks. The mother flew off immediately, the chicks were no more than 5 days old; they almost had no feathers at all, and were a little more than 3 inches from tail end to beak end. The tree was situated on our building site grounds of the church; the chicks fell to the ground so he then quickly walked away, but only after being threatened by myself due to him saying he was going to stamp on them.\n\nWhen he had walked away I walked over to them, then while reaching to pick them up off the ground could feel their scared and confused emotions, then after they had been placed back in the nest their emotions changed to ones of happiness and safety. They did though now have emotions of interest growing towards myself and were crawling to the side of the nest I was stood by, so quickly I walked away.\n\nThey ended up just disappearing so I reckon he must have taken them out of the nest and destroyed them at some other time.\n\nA week or 2 later a few religious people came on site chatting with me, and he was giving them more grief than he himself deserved, so I was all of a sudden defending this his other low life way. Lives in the middle of Moss Side, and was also perversely racist to the site security Black guy.\n\nNo one said anything, not even the security guard, or management of the firm, I bet one said somet though.\n\nA racing pigeon I released into the wild, every time I noticed it near my home it took off and flew around me, as soon as I looked at it that is. It had rare black and white markings; quite similar to a Magpie so I knew it was the same one I released. It always took off and flew around me as soon as I spotted it, because it connected with me in telepathic ways, knowing precisely what I am looking at due to connecting with my vision. Ive seen it occur with cattle and sheep too, I tried to make them move in a particular way as a flock or herd and they did precisely that.\n\nIt happens a lot, telepathic connections with animals, Ive seen flies, fish and ants react to the same, and Ive even had 2 Owls following me at night time for miles of my walk home. I could hear them calling to each other for more than 3 miles of my walk home, one either side of me, till I got close to home then they went quiet. Owls are quite well known for being spiritually attuned so this was a rare moment that didnt surprise me at all. They were actually a little bit wary of me; for they knew that I knew they had been catching wild Mice from my garden. Feeding wild birds in my garden for close to 10 years made sure Mice moved into the garden area too, to get whatever scraps of food the birds had left behind.\n\nThe Flies connecting with me occurred when sat at the side of the river, in Moses Gate Country Park, Farnworth. I saw the swarm of Flies a few feet in front of myself, I tried to move them away by picturing in my mind the swarm moving to my left, and they immediately did that, I tried it again and they did it again.\n\nNext I heard these thoughts in my mind, Look there at the river (while a friend of supernatural origin placed an imaginary marker in my thoughts at a particular place of the river) when I say now, in a few seconds a fish will jump up out of the water from that point, now, and sure enough as soon as now went through my mind last, a fish jumped up from that precise point in the river. It must have jumped out of the water to catch a Fly, so surely a person of supernatural origin made the Fly move to that part of the river, the part of the river he or she knew that a fish was looking for food nearby.\n\nIts occurred a few times with me and insects, telepathy that is, or themselves displaying a liking for me while getting close to me. One evening when opening my kitchen window to clear the room of steam a wet and motionless Butterfly dropped onto my window sill, appearing as though it was dead, with its wings closed and not moving. I picked it up then saw a very small amount of movement in its legs, so put it on top of my computer monitor so to warm and dry it out, within a few minutes it had flew off into an area of the room I couldnt find it within, then the next day found it stood on my window sill. So I opened the window and let it out, then later the same day when in my garden it came and flew near to me, then landed on the window from where it first fell into my kitchen. It was for sure the same one, the first of its kind id seen that year. Next pictures started appearing in my mind of me earlier in the day when shutting that window trapping it so it couldnt escape, trapping parts of its legs in the closed opening of the window, then as it began to rain got drenched and was close to death. It stood on the window for 5 to 10 seconds then flew away happy. Im fairly sure it was showing me that I had trapped it unknowingly, it had to have been, I first started thinking that immediately upon seeing it in the garden.\n\nIve seen Ants reacting to me strangely too but this occurred when I didnt know I was telepathic, when close to 6 years old, so I couldnt work out why it was occurring, I suspected they were communicating with each other via some kind of invisible sense.\n\nIve seen some strange behaviour from wild animals close to me too, such as Ants farming smaller insects on the newly grown tips of plants in my garden. I watched them moving small green insects around, picking them up and placing them on new tips of the plants, so they could feed on the plant sap, or carrying them away to the Ant nest.\n\nIve seen a Spider parachuting in my garden from its own woven parachute, the Spider with its legs spread was close to 15mm in diameter, its parachute was a similar size, perfectly circular, beneath that were 4 to 6 lengths of silk that joined together close to an inch beneath the parachute, and the Spider holding onto that linking. Its well-known Spiders abseil by spinning lengths of silk that are attached to plants, they then hold onto the end and let the breeze blow them to other plants, whilst they increase the length of the line. I watched a lot of wildlife programs and have never heard of parachuting Spiders or Ants farming insects.\n\nI always left the house Spiders alone, so theyd get the flies. In 2014 I hand reared a Common Swift, found as a flightless chick hiding under a parked car on the road outside my home. All they eat are insects so the house Spiders I came across I caught, killed and fed to it, along with shop bought Crickets, Maggots, Freshwater Shrimp and the few Flies I caught in my home. Before I always suspected the Spiders knew I was leaving them alone to do their thing, then when rearing the Swift felt as though they now knew they were prey. After the Swift had flown away on its flight it took 2 weeks of leaving the Spiders alone then I came across the biggest house Spider Ive ever seen. Opened an upstairs window and put it on the window sill outside, then 3 hours later found another a similar size, ground floor this time, the other was first floor. It may have been the same one but Im not sure, it just seemed a bit strange to me. Ive only ever seen one a similar size once before, about 20 years earlier, when in bed and it fell onto my back from the attic opening. That was a similar size to the palm of my hand too and Ive got big hands. I didnt even know what was on my back, brushed it off with my hand then saw this massive Spider sprinting across the floor as fast as a running Mouse.\n\nTheres lots of strange behaviour in animals occur with me, sometimes they react as though they are for brief moments hearing what I hear, Ive seen people do that too, and on a couple of other occasions I know for sure Ive heard what someone else was hearing.\n\nOne time I was listening to a music track on headphones, it had songbirds singing in it too. I walked into the garden at about 4 in the afternoon, and as soon as I did this Blackbird came into view and began singing at the top of his voice, from a rooftop. I felt as though he was reacting to hearing song birds from my hearing, so took out my headphones and the instant I did he stopped singing, looked around, looked at me, then flew back to his nest. No other birds were singing, but he seemed like he was trying to be the loudest in the area and then flew off when everything went silent in my hearing.\n\nIve only seen it occur close to 5 times so it may not be common in me.\n\nAs a kid I gave my science teacher a very large Moth chrysalis, and when it hatched out some kind of unknown to science insect emerged. The science teacher spent months trying to identify it but couldnt find anything, the closest resemblance he found was a European mainland kind of Stick Insect, but it wasnt the same, it wasnt even similar, it was just the closest resembling insect.\n\nIt had 4 legs, a body, neck and large head, black coloured, no feet and each of the legs, body and neck were all one diameter, very thin and round. Its eyes, head and mouth were larger than the diameter of its body, legs and neck. From head to the end of its back legs was close to 2 inches, the diameter of its legs, body and neck were close to 2 millimetres, and the size of its head was close to a 5-millimetre diameter. It was a horrible looking insect; proper gave me the frights when looking at it staring back at me, while it was trying to work out a way to escape. It looked very clever; it was definitely weighing up the situation and trying to work out a way to escape, it didnt need too though, as we later released it. Im not going to explain where I found that chrysalis, Id rather they stay unknown to science; the area that I found it within has now been built upon anyways.\n\nIn 2012 I moved home from Greater Manchester and back into Lancashire, some of the wild Starlings I was feeding from my previous home have moved with me, I think theyre just being their usual clever selves though, following me because they know Im good for an all year round food supply.\n\nFor an amount of time I tried not to let them get to the bird food I put out in my garden, due to them being so common and taking food from other bird species, till I realised if I feed them all the other birds in the area do better as they are not competing with Starlings for what other food is around for them elsewhere. Theyre probably the most successful birds in the British Isles at the present times; when they get a good food supply all the other species do better. Considered a kind of vermin by many, but then humanity considers all successful animal species that are not beneficial to humanity as being vermin. Theyre probably the most intelligent birds Ive come across in the wild, watching them competing with a male Blackbird for food in my garden was funny to watch, theyd all be taking the food from a ground feeder then in comes the Blackbird collecting for his missus and chicks back in the nest. He would land in the middle of the Starlings, theyd all scatter away a bit, he then filling his mouth with food to take back to the nest, but whilst he was doing such one Starling would sneak up behind him and peck his tail feathers, so he then turned and chased it away, but whilst he was chasing another would sneak up behind him and peck his tail feathers, so he turned and chased it on foot and the same was occurring with many of the Starlings, all this occurring whilst they were all running around on the ground. I was watching it and laughing, thinking hes gonna get one of them. But then a couple of weeks later saw him with no tail feathers left; he was proper struggling to fly but could just about. It took them about 2 weeks to totally destroy his tail feathers, they grow back so didnt matter much. And the Starlings were now nowhere to be seen whenever he was nearby; I think they had vexed him that much that he had become more aggressive so they avoided him totally.\n\nMany another time wild birds have made it obvious to me that they are concentrating on I, it feels as though theyre already telepathic and cant understand why Im the only human who is, and many times they make sure I know that most local birds connect with me live when Im concentrating on them. They also react with movements when making realisations of their connections with me or their knowledge of I, their kind of communicative aerial display.\n\nConnection With A Fox\n\nWhen approximately 20 years old Id began to grow more interested in the supernatural and spiritual around and in me, previous it was just a slight interest I had.\n\nDuring childhood my friends of unknown origins had kept quiet in my thoughts for most of the time, and when they were there were pretending to be my own thoughts, thus making sure I didnt start to believe they were in fact there for most of the time. That was just in most of my childhood years though, there were rare occasions when we spoke in telepathic ways when they claimed they were in fact other peoples thoughts, my friends of supernatural origins, but usually this only ever occurred during very early childhood, up till being 6 or 7 years old.\n\nAfter leaving school they became more obvious in myself, this their plan to keep quiet in my thoughts during childhood because I wasnt responsible for myself, I.E. parents and the education authority having their holds on me. If Id have mentioned that I have supernatural origin friends, in my thoughts, they would have looked and reacted to me differently, and probably trying to force their harmful brain activity limiting drugs onto me.\n\nAfter leaving school my unknown origin friends were more obvious in thoughts, this was accumulating in number and obviousness until fully accepting they were in my thoughts whenever they needed to be there.\n\nAged 18 till 20 years old they had been visiting me many times when I was alone, making it obvious it was they and I was getting a bit angered by it, I didnt really want them there and told them to leave me be but they wouldnt. How they made me accept them was by reminding me, how, as a child I had realised Im the man as mentioned within many prophecies of the future, but now in my early twenties and just before I didnt want to accept or believe it, so it was a fairly long time before they made me accept that part of my life.\n\nDuring one moment when communicating telepathically I asked for them to provide proof of a kind of what was occurring around and to me and what else was possible. They instructed me to go for a walk into the nearby Clarence Park, Bury, and once there would then show me proof of what was occurring to me and what else is possible.\n\nI quickly got myself ready, put on my shoes and jacket then locked up my home and walked to the park. It was early in the morning, probably being about 1 or 2 so the nearby roads were very quiet. While walking towards a bench I started deliberating in thoughts as to what was about to occur but no images or thoughts from supernatural sources hinted in any way, and there were no thoughts to suggest I was still telepathically speaking to a person of any origin. Theyd become totally quiet in thoughts; so then I started guessing at what may occur. All sorts started to run through my mind, such as seeing another UFO, a spirit, ghost or something not known of the supernatural by me.\n\nWhen arriving at the bench I sat and waited for something to occur. There was a street lamp situated about 80 yards directly in front of myself, and the Bowling Green was situated between the street lamp and I, so the area was lit up well for the night-time. After close to 5 minutes of nothing occurring I started to believe Id somehow been tricked by telepathic connections with human people in my mind, they falsely claiming to be my supernatural origin friends, this was an understandable circumstance to consider, as government and other authority linked persons had been pretending to be my supernatural friends in my thoughts many times, before and after, and also pretending to be my own thoughts. I was about to stand up and walk home when my supernatural friends quickly returned in thoughts, they were now almost begging me not to move and to spend just 5 more minutes sat down on the bench. I reluctantly agreed then sat back down and tried to relax.\n\nAfter a few more minutes of nothing occurring I began to sense/feel a life form of sorts, approaching myself from somewhere. It felt like an emotion I was in connection with, outstretching from another being, it felt like myself being hunted by it. I was a little scared and the hunting emotion began to grow stronger, so my fear was also building up in strength. I started scanning every area around myself, looking for some sign of movement but nothing, and the emotion was still getting stronger. Again I looked all around and had by now disassociated this moment from what the supernatural origin people said I would experience as proof to what is occurring with and around myself. I knew and could sense a life form of some sort getting close, so for brief moments I thought could be some sort of animal, may be a supernatural origin life form, or may be just a person. I was by now beginning to feel quite scared so was scouting the surrounding areas in a very fast manner with my vision. Then all my fright and nervousness totally disappeared when seeing a young Fox walk around the corner of the nearby building, it had a Pigeon sized bird in its mouth and walking straight towards me. Starting to feel nice emotions and waiting for it to see me and run off in the opposite direction but that it didnt do, it just continued walking straight towards me. Many urban Foxs are quite tame but this one in Clarence Park wasnt. The park is very close to wild areas and a Fox that hunts wild birds in the night wont be of the tame kind. It just carried on walking straight towards me despite the area being lit up well with the nearby street lamp. I was watching and waiting for it to run off in the opposite direction but still it continued walking. I was almost laughing in appreciation now as it was only a few metres distance in front of my left side, then when it walked in front of me, only 2 feet distance from my legs I made a tutting noise to attract its attention. It immediately stopped walking, when it was positioned (as a maximum to go off) only 2 feet distance from me, while positioned directly in front of me. It was standing still with its head pointing to my right; it then turned its head over its left shoulder to check that area of land for where the tutting noise came from. Its line of vision and head slowly turned clockwise towards me, then when it looked straight at me it for some reason didnt see me, so continued scanning the area with its clockwise turning head and vision. It looked over its right shoulder then turned its head back to the front of itself. I was completely baffled now because it had looked straight at me on two occasions, and I was sat within a hand reaching distance from it. Even the Fox was totally baffled because it couldnt sense where the noise came from. I could even smell it due to being that close and it stunk. I then decided to talk to it, so verbally said, Come here, whilst reaching forward with my hand to stroke it. It didnt even try to see where the noise had come from on this occasion, it just running away as fast as possible. I watched it crawl through a hole under a nearby hedge and that was the last I saw of it.\n\nThe Fox wasnt the only strange occurrence I had with wildlife in that area, a few other things occurred too.\n\nWhen on my driving licence test examination the examiner told me, When I hit the dashboard with my folder I want you to perform an emergency stop. He said this approximately half a mile down the road from my home, we were driving towards my home on the same road as, and when on approach to it I noticed a black dog, sat on the pavement about 10 metres away from my home. It was an old Labrador cross like, had greying parts of fur around its mouth and elsewhere on its face, it was short haired. As soon as I looked it in the face it looked back at me and I immediately knew it was going to walk out in front of the car, which it then began to do. As soon as its front feet were touching the road I was doing an emergency stop and I did a perfect one. The dog slowly walked across into the park area, walking towards where I had the moment with the Fox.\n\nI know this may all seem like a coincidence but approximately 2 minutes later the test examiner hit the dashboard with his folder, I performed an emergency stop but messed it up, I took my foot off the brake pedal before the car came to a standstill, so the car was slowing, it nearly came to a standstill, then taking my foot off the brake it next rolled forward before then coming to a stop. After the test had finished and I was given a pass I enquired about my failed second emergency stop, he told me,  But you're first one was perfect, its very rare any driver would have to perform 2 emergency stops in a 5 minute time period, so I passed you on the basis of the first one.\n\nAnd only weeks earlier I had been reading of the mythological wild Black Dogs of English legends, it seems to me it was one of them for sure. My telepathic abilities are noticed by wild animals a lot, and for sure my supernatural origin friends interfered with that Fox so to make it walk near to me, interfered with via telepathic controls of it, and via something else to make sure it didnt see me when stood next to me. So I now believe the Black Dog had been influenced by the supernatural to sit there waiting for me, as soon as I saw it looked like it was waiting for something, then immediately after looking at myself walked out in front of the car and then left the area. It was being made to wait for me and probably didnt know it.\n\nAnd I have one more story to write about wildlife in that park.\n\nIt was one afternoon, I was sat in my front room when noticing many girls playing Rounders on the park across the road, one of which I knew personally. Yeah OK I admit to it, I was checking out the girls across the road from my home, I was 22 and they were similar ages.\n\nI noticed something very strange fly over them. The girl I knew was approximately 5 foot 8 inches tall, but when this bird flew over her its wingspan from tip to tip was more than 3 lengths of her height, equating to more than a 4.5 metre wingspan.\n\nIve done quite a bit of bird spotting in my life, have lived in countryside and rural areas for most of my life and spent a lot of time in the countryside. Ive kept birds, rescued and released them, my dad had Racing Pigeons and other livestock so I know how to identify birds and I know which big birds are present in the British Isles. It was massive, bigger than anything I knew of, its wings were rounded at the tips with grey feathers, its legs were long, thin and back stretched, its long neck was curled back and it had a long, orange, sturdy beak with a feather crest on its head. Its feather colours were grey on its top and white underneath. It would have easily stood nearly as tall as me it was that big. It was more than twice the size of the biggest bird in the British Isles, and looked nothing like one of them Grey Herons. Its wing beats were less than one per second, it flying above the fields by about 50 to 70 metres. It looked like it was looking for somewhere to roost for the night, the time being close to 4 pm, or may be 5 pm at the latest. None of the girls recognised it as being something other than what should have normally been there, but this was a Greater Manchester town, industrialised and not really a place were much bird spotting occurs. Ive lived in many towns throughout my life, in cities, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and in the countryside near to the Lake District, so I would have had much more bird spotting experience than any of them girls had, hence me noticing it was not a normal bird and them girls not noticing the same.\n\nThen a few weeks later when in a meditation session at an S.N.U. spiritualist church I found myself flying alongside another of these birds, flying around with it by my side, whilst we were in a darkened, empty place. We were interacting with each other, it feeling my happy emotions via telepathy and I feeling its own. A couple of times we touched each other, I stroking its head, it then touching me with its wingtip and both of ourselves flying close too and around each other, while flying in one direction. All the time I could feel my body sat on the chair in the church, I could feel my breathing, I could feel everything about my body and could hear everything from within the church, even the traffic outside, but was also watching this dream like existence occur all around myself. I knew it was some sort of spiritual realm, like how some dreams are the same, and I thought the bird was some sort of extinct species of Heron, by typing into search engines, 5 metre wingspan I found pictures of the believed to be extinct Dasornis, they were very similar, or in the very least the one I saw a sub-species of, it being a breed of Goose. It could have been something else but for sure it was not what is known by science to exist today.\n\nThe beak it had was a bit smaller than the beaks Ive seen of Dasornis, its wings were more rounded at the tips and wider, and the crest on its head was much bigger, but everything else Ive seen of these Dasornis and the bird I saw are the same. Its wingspan was easily more than 2 times longer than a Grey Heron, I know what I saw and it wasnt normal.\n\nUnknown to science species of animals are being discovered every month, and the way we are destroying some natural environments theyre also being destroyed and extinct before being discovered by science, and the Coelacanth is testament to science getting things wrong sometimes, it being a prehistoric species of fish science thought was extinct, but is still being caught in the waters off the coast of South Africa. The Coelacanth hasnt evolved for more than 300 million years; it is now how it always was.\n\nIve also seen Eagle Owls reacting to me supernaturally, from the same area where I saw that giant Goose, 2 of them actually spoke to me, they didnt mimic, they actually spoke English words, it was a statement alongside proving a supernatural connection to myself.\n\nTelepathy really does well in attracting the attention of wildlife. Not long before 2010 I was reading into the subject of the mythological big cats of England, Scotland and Wales. I decided to try and make one put in a public appearance, by concentrating on the countryside and picturing in my mind big cats there, and trying to persuade with pictures and emotions one to come close to human built up areas. I was expecting something close to where I live to be seen, within the month I heard radio news reports of a big cat being seen near to Altrincham, which was less than 10 miles away from my home of that time, 10 miles in a straight line. These big cats of the English countryside are not natural in this environment, back in the late 70s or early 80s the English Government clamped down on big cat owners by putting up lots of restrictions, new laws and legislation, many of the owners couldnt then afford to keep their dangerous animals, so instead of giving them to the authorities many set them free.\n\nIm pretty sure one got close to my campsite one night but I could have been mistaken. A few days earlier I had found a dismembered Sheep carcass in long grass, then one night when sitting next to my campfire heard something walking through the wooded area. I could hear its heavy footsteps and it brushing past and moving vegetation as it walked. My campfire made a crackle, it stopped walking, stood still for a few seconds then ran off towards the direction it had come from. When running away it was almost totally silent, not brushing any vegetation, making almost no sound at all, except for its footsteps but they too were much quieter than they had been when it was walking. It was definitely a four legged large animal, it could have been a Deer but the way it ran off silently makes me suspect it was a big cat. The sound its footsteps made while it walked sounded like soft pads on the underside of its feet, when it ran off its footsteps sounded even quieter, Deer cant do that due to having hooves, cats can because of their paw pads.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nReading About Myself\n\nThis next encounter, up till then was one of the biggest moments of my own learning curve with the supernatural, it occurring when I was about 22 years old and fairly new to many areas of the spiritual. When it occurred it was a massive turning point for me due to the physical properties it held.\n\nI remember it occurring when my niece was only 3 or 4 months old, which would have been 1995. She was born on New Years day so the month must have been March or April. I was at my sisters home with herself, Sally her friend, my niece and her baby sister. They were all talking girlie stuff so I went to the lounge while they chatted in the kitchen. Trying to find a television programme to watch but the content of programmes wasnt to my liking, so decided to read the magazine on the floor to my side. The content of that didnt really interest me much either as it was a womans magazine; I was turning over to the next page quite quickly and on nearly every page. Until coming to the astrology section that is, I quickly read through the Aquarian section but it didnt really match up for me, which did come as a surprise as they are usually precise (if I only read them on a couple of occasions each year). Ive since learnt because it was a womans magazine the astrology readings would only have been appropriate for Aquarian women, and I dont usually read womens magazines, honest, I was just bored at my sisters while they talked girlie stuff.\n\nI then saw on the same page as the astrology section a paragraph of writing that had the heading of The New Spiritual Leader. I immediately remembered the times when my supernatural contacts had telepathically said I was a new spiritual leader like person, the man from prophecies, etc, so started wondering and guessing at what the writing would say. It was written by a clairvoyant lady from London, the name of the magazine I cant remember but it was a mainstream one, the paragraph said something very similar too; There will be a baby who will talk for the first time ever, in a somewhat miraculous way. This will act as proof to the new spiritual leader of who he truly is, but we will all have to wait a number of years yet before we find out who he is.\n\nAfter reading this I immediately turned to the front cover to check the magazine release date and was immediately downhearted when noticing it was 5 or 6 months old, so then throwing it to the floor in a bit of a dismayed emotion. I had started to wrongfully suspect this miraculous event must have already occurred in front of who must truly be the new age supernatural figure, due to it being a 5 or 6-month-old magazine. Beginning to watch daytime television but the writing from the magazine kept repeating through my mind over and over again. It was my supernatural friends again, only they werent letting onto me then that it was they in my thoughts. I tried to ignore these repeating thoughts but they continued, then after a minute or two of the same I started to fear some kind of mental illness was surfacing into my mind, then suddenly the strange thoughts disappeared and was then able to concentrate only on the television programme. A minute or two later moving video like pictures started entering my thoughts, they were of 3 girls with a baby in a pram and a lad was stood in the foreground. The baby then spoke which amazed everyone in the picture, except for the girl pushing the pram; she then said she must have said it by accident. The word family also appeared in the images and they continued repeating in thoughts for a few minutes at the most. To me this seemed strange and out of place, at the time I didnt know it was my supernatural friends putting the images there, so I continued watching the television program while trying to ignore the repeating images.\n\nI partially started believing the images in my mind could have been psychic portrayals of the events surrounding the magazines prediction, and that they must have already occurred in front of some other man who was the real new spiritual leader like person, all occurring some months earlier due to the magazine being 5 or 6 months old. Next thoughts entered my own which said this,\n\nMagnus, how would you feel and react to your spirit friends now that you know they may have lied about you being the new spiritual leader person? I didnt know these thoughts were my supernatural friends, then pondered over that possibility before thinking; Id be slightly angry but wouldnt hold it against them. I now believe in God and life after death, this I wouldnt have become to believe in without their years of telepathic, physical and supernatural contact with me.\n\nTheir thoughts then said, They probably heard them thoughts then!\n\nI started to slightly laugh in myself due to realising my supernatural friends were actually in my thoughts and had been listening to my thoughts, so then I thought in a slightly humorous manner, Yeah, they probably heard them thoughts then. \n\nThey then went quiet again, and whilst I thought about and suspected not being that historical supernatural person. I was a bit gutted so tried to avert my attention by watching the television program.\n\nIt was about 10 minutes later I heard my 3 or 4-month-old niece speak from within the kitchen these words, mama, mama.\n\nQuickly walking into the kitchen only to see and hear sis say it was an accident and that she didnt mean to say that because she is too young to speak. I asked if she had just said mama, mama, my eldest niece agreed she had. Sally and I both agreed that she had so then I was by now looking at her blankly whilst recalling the writing in the magazine. I wanted to tell and show them what Id just read in the magazine but was then influenced by the supernatural to walk back into the lounge.\n\nI had 3 witnesses to this and the magazines staff will remember what they published. I cant remember the name of the magazine though, as I was too excited at the circumstances occurring to take note of it, but I did read the article again and even checked to see if it was real by scratching bits of it off the paper.\n\nWhen again thinking about telling the girls what Id just read my supernatural friends influenced me not too by saying no person would believe me in full. I asked them what I should do about things, in thoughts that is, whenever I refer to speaking with people of the supernatural it is always in reference to telepathic contact. They replied by telling me to get a job, which I had been trying to do but not as much as they had wanted of me.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAn Amazing Insight\n\nRound about the same time, either weeks or months earlier or later, the same supernatural in origin people returned in thoughts, so we were thinking to each other when yet again they started to tell of historical circumstances surrounding me, which I didnt want to accept or believe. I was in my early 20s and again having major problems accepting these aspects as a part of me to live by, or as a guideline for my life. My supernatural friends began secretly instructing me in telepathic ways again, by pretending to be my own thoughts, to go and borrow my aunties tarot cards for the evening, to give myself the first tarot reading I received. Back then I thought were my own thoughts, then later learnt were the thoughts of my supernatural friends.\n\nWhen picking up the cards I quickly left, mainly because of being excited at the prospect of receiving my first reading. I got home, took off my jacket and immediately set about to give myself a reading. When looking at the cards I was totally baffled, they were Russell Grants own version of the cartoon type. I hadnt got a clue as to what they meant, what I was supposed to do or where to start. I also had no instructions on how to use the cards, so the supernatural had to formulate a way for me. I stared at the cards in a confused manner for some seconds before being instructed in thoughts; they told me to shuffle them all up by placing them on the floor whilst mixing them around randomly. Then I should gather them all up and place them on the coffee table, face down in many rows. So that I did, starting by putting all the cards face down on the floor, spent about one minute shuffling and moving them around, to mix them up as much as possible. Next thoughts said that whoever was in telepathic contact with me, from a supernatural origin, they are of the physical and not the spiritual, and that they would very easily be able to pick out the cards designated for me, which I agreed that they would be able to do. Next I was told of a woman who was with me in the room, a woman of the physical but unknown origin, being invisible and it would be her who chooses the cards for me. Picking up the shuffled cards I placed them into a neat pile, then started to place them all on my coffee table face down. After filling all of the old world map glass tabletop I was left with about 10 to 20 cards, thoughts instructed me to put them to one side so I then did that. I still didnt know what to do though, so thoughts told me to pick out three cards by pointing a finger at each card individually. Along the first row was instructed to pick out one card so I put it to one-side. Then in the third and fifth rows was instructed to pick out one particular card from each row. The first of the three cards I turned over was the Rabbit but I didnt know what it meant. Then the next card was the Oxen which I also didnt know the meaning of. Then while holding the last card thoughts said it would be the most significant for me and would be the one that describes me in more detail than the other 2. Upon turning the card was completely amazed when seeing a young looking; slim, tall, red haired man, sat on a spaceship and pointing to the stars. I was totally amazed; I was also a young, slim, tall, red haired man (my hair has now faded in colour) and had many experiences of seeing UFOs. I was amazed then even more so when I saw the heading, it was Aquarius. Im also an Aquarian and had in those times of the 90s been receiving psychic information in my mind concerning the future of humanity and part of the Golden Era of the Age of Aquarius being somehow connected with me. So this Aquarian title on the card just fell into place with all the other supernatural links in my life that were occurring close too or within them times. This was again totally amazing to experience but I was still a bit baffled as to what the collection of 3 cards meant. I was told Id find that out in the future so had to just remember which cards came out.\n\nNow when I think of that card it reminds me of when I was sat on a nuclear missile in Huncoat, 1985, it looked very similar.\n\nIve asked in thoughts many a time what the 3 cards meant together. I was told, because I hadnt used a known process for reading and picking the cards, it would also be a unique reading I received, which is as follows; I will multiply, with the strength of the Oxen, throughout the stars. A very big statement even by my standards, but one that correlates with my predictions that humanity will become like me, telepathic sentient beings, then later venturing out into other galaxies to reside on other planets.\n\nBefore humanity masters the universe they have to master themselves and earth, so its going to be a long time before humanity step off this planet onto a similar one, not hundreds of years, itll be thousands. We are stuck on this planet till we perfect ourselves; no way will our all-knowing, secretive, studying and watching Alien friends allow humanity to step off this planet onto a similar one before then.\n\nI dont bother with readings much, for most people theres only a very small percentage of the past or future able to be learned of, plus knowing future events of your own life, either good or bad outcomes and influences doesnt help matters much. Readings are an over-rated area of the psychic, spiritual and supernatural, but its what people become interested in due to not having anything else to go off, and its what charlatans offer as services due to wanting to earn money from people, although there are a great many people who do give good readings there are also a lot who do not. Anyways, people can give themselves readings by learning tarot, astrology, numerology, runes, palm reading, or asking the spiritual to give answers in dreams (cannot be on any kind of mind altering substances for this to be possible) For spiritual readings that is something else.\n\nStick to less than one reading a year if that is what you want, but we warned youll be gutted and dismayed if you only pay people who are no good at these readings, and there is no way of knowing beforehand if they are good or not, unless you go off recommendations by people you know. Plus knowing the future isnt too nice, knowing of future nice things in your life makes you expect them soon, and if they dont occur soon you get confused and frustrated. And knowing of bad futures is even worse.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n3 Tonne Balanced On My Back\n\nIn my early twenties I had began to grow more interested in the psychic, supernatural and spiritual, I was also wanting to find spiritual people so to share my experiences with and to learn more, so when myself and some work mates drove past a small Spiritualist Church, in Whitefield, Crystal Clear, I felt as though it would be a good place for me to go.\n\nI phoned Helen, the most advanced psychic of their group and main committee member, then telling her that lots of psychic and supernatural occurrences were occurring in my life. We arranged for me to attend her open circle evening meeting the following week, although I didnt have any idea what one of them was.\n\nOn the day I was to attend I wrote up a list of all the categories of supernatural events and abilities Id been experiencing, and placed telepathy at the top of the list. It seemed like the place it deserved a mention most, only I wasnt expecting every person within a spiritualist church to be surprised and amazed by telepathy in me in the ways that they were. When noticing people becoming very surprised and quietly amazed I was sort of just as surprised as they were.\n\nAfter visiting the church for a few months was asked if Id like to be a member of the closed circle, then soon after a committee member which I agreed to both. Then soon after was asked if Id like to participate in a psychic quest to search for a lost mythological artefact, so it was one very good staging point of investigating my own supernatural abilities and others. I dont think theyll like me explaining our days and time together but for this book some is needed to be explained, so for this next description of events Ill not explain what we were looking for, although people may find that from my thoughts.\n\nWe never had any luck finding the object but we had other agendas to participate within on those days out, so something supernatural was always occurring. On one such day out we had visited a place just outside of Beddgelert, Wales. There were quite a few of us and had arrived in 3 cars. We were searching an area of riverbank situated across the valley from the old copper mine museum. This area we had been drawn too due to myths and legends of the close by Myriddian Hill. We were looking for a particular artefact, which is said in a similar named book was buried in a wax seal to be hidden for a long time. I cant remember by how many years ago, possibly close in time to when the Gunpowder Plotters were active. We had to walk up the steep mountain and as we got close to the third or fourth waterfall I sensed we were close to where we should be. I picked a place in the river banking and was walking across the rocks and checking the waterfall by hand, while the others were checking and digging out from a group of rocks to one side of the river. I wanted the others to come and help with my chosen area, and Helen, the medium in charge of the church and search did say the night before Id know where we should go, but on the day no one was listening when I was trying to get help with my search. After a short time I was drawn to the small waterfall, I was actually checking it, the vertical wall of by standing in the shallow water at its lowest point, I found a small clumping of grass growing out of that waterfall, after trying to dislodge it from what it was growing out of, that lump of something fell into the river and floated away. It was actually the size and shape of what the artefact could have been within, but whether or not it was the object I cannot say. If it was the artefact Im glad I lost it, it was supposed to have caused major problems for every previous owner. After watching the unknown object float down the river I lost interest in my search, then walked over to my friends and helped them with theirs. I decided to help with their dig, so then took over, climbed into the hole they had began making then started digging out the rubble with a small trowel and my bare hands. The pile of very large rocks above and round the newly dug out hole looked like the capping stones of an old cave of a sort, which itself had been filled in with small half inch sized pieces of stone, it was probably an attempt by the miners to find a new seam of copper ore and it being filled in due to nothing being found. It was on the edge of a natural rock outcrop, but the large stones and small pieced rubble looked un-natural in their placing. There was one stone that looked naturally placed and that was the largest one.\n\nI was a bit reluctant in helping with my friends search, mainly because I sensed something not right about the area, but then other peoples emotions and thoughts in my own got the better of me, so I then started digging without hesitation. After about 20 minutes Id moved enough of the rubble to be able to climb totally inside the hole so was beginning to start the dig down, into what appeared to be the filled in cave, cavern, mine or similar. Nothing about the area seemed to feel like the right place but I was digging in a fast manner so to get the others to loose interest in the area quicker. Helen had walked back to the car about 15 minutes earlier as she wasnt happy with the area either. After climbing completely into the hole and digging out for a further 15 minutes or similar, a very loud statement echoed through my thoughts, which said, Magnus, just stop what you are doing, immediately, and just take a look around. These thoughts didnt sound like my own, or a persons via my telepathic abilities; as they were generated in a louder manner than usual, or of a differing speed or tone to what usual thoughts sound and appear like in my own. I immediately realised that a supernatural in origin life form were making warnings to me of immediate danger. My suspicions were correct, I turned over and led on my back to check the hole and boulders and which was quite hard to do as the hole was still quite small. It was roughly about 8 foot long, extending horizontally into the very steep slope of the hill, was just over 2 foot tall and about 4 foot wide, close in shape and siz"
