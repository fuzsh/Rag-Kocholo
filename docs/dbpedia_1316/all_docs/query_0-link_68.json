        "text": "Season four comes to a close with this bizarre episode, which almost comes across as an unintentional follow-up to \"Animaniacs Stew\" (episode 35). Here, Brain finds himself at the mercy of the Hip Hippos, Rita makes an appearance in the final Mindy and Buttons cartoon, and two well-loved characters finally tie the knot. Or do they...?\n\nVariable Verse: High Octane-y!\n\nFriz Freleng's goofy stork character (depicted as being really stupid as opposed to really drunk) drops off a baby at what he assumes to be the house of the Rockefellers, but instead has delivered it to the penthouse of the Hip Hippos. The \"baby\" is actually Brain, who has no idea that the hippos aren't the Rockefellers (whose money he wants in order to take over the world), while Flavio and Marita are clueless to the fact that the little mouse isn't a baby hippo. They name their new baby \"Alfredo\" and take him to the doctor, where Brain is crushed when his blood pressure is taken, slammed with a mallet when his reflexes are checked, and is pumped full of a disgusting amount of hippopotamus vaccine. Back at home, Brain is shocked to learn of his mistake, as the TV news reports that a baby hippo has been delivered to the real Rockefellers. After being force fed his dinner and following an escape attempt, Brain's luck turns around when the stork returns. Realizing his error, the stork hands Flavio and Marita their real baby and takes Brain to the Rockefeller home. Unfortunately, the Rockefellers leave for a vacation, putting Brain in the care of their aggressive servants. It's then that Brain wakes up from his nightmare, only for Pinky to inform him that they've gotten a delivery - the Rockefeller baby!\n\nAs ridiculous is this cartoon is, I find it to be incredibly enjoyable. The last cartoon to star Flavio and Marita, and the first time we've seen Brain in quite a while, \"The Pitter Patter of Little Feet\" mixes characters we'd normally never see together to give us something so stupid that it actually works. Although a lot of the gags consist of Brain getting slammed, crushed, scalded and engorged, his hilarious expressions combined with Maurice LaMarche's terrific voice-over work makes a lot of the physical stuff funny instead of unpleasant. Brain's baby disguise shouldn't fool anyone (\"Goo. Take me to my money.\") but Flavio and Marita are so caught up in their own little world that they don't even realize he's not a hippo. They're not really fit to be parents in the first place, as seen in the careless way they bathe little \"Alfredo\". \"The babies, they love the bath\", says Marita blissfully as she plops the mouse into the water and scrubs him vigorously, while Flavio doesn't even notice the rinse water he's about to use is so hot it turns the faucet bright red. Later, when Brain stays up all night screaming, the hippos wake up, simultaneously say, \"It's the baby. You take care of him\" and go right back to sleep. When they finally rush into the bedroom to check on \"Alfredo\", Flavio falls right on top of him. Part of the fun of most Pinky and the Brain cartoons was always seeing Brain's pretension and superiority complex deflated by the indignities heaped upon him in his pursuit for global domination. Up against the Hip Hippos, he really doesn't stand a chance. Additionally, for an Animaniacs cartoon airing this late, Wang's animation is incredibly strong, nailing every humiliated expression on Brain and doing some great work on the hippos as well. Out of the six cartoons these characters star in, this is easily the best one, and the only one I really find myself going back to with any regularity.\n\nI don't think Flavio and Marita are awful characters, and they certainly don't deserve the hatred they seem to get from most Animaniacs fans. But they definitely weren't all that interesting on their own, and wound up starring in some of the very worst cartoons in the series. It was clear that the Hip Hippos was an idea that someone thought had potential, only for the characters to be abandoned completely in the first season when they weren't working out. \"La Behemoth\", \"A Moving Experience\" and \"Can't Buy a Thrill\" are easily some of my least favorite cartoons from season one, and are shorts I only watched again because I had to talk about them for this blog. It's amazing that they decided to take a chance on the hippos again in the fourth season, and I really have to admit that \"Amazing Gladiators\" and \"The Pitter Patter of Little Feet\" aren't bad at all, and I get quite a bit of enjoyment out of both of them. These two shorts redeem the characters somewhat in my eyes, and make me wish they were used a little better in the earlier days of the show. The hippos won't disappear completely, but will remain background characters from this point on and (excepting Flavio's out-of-character appearance as \"Flabby the Butt\" in \"Star Warners\") they'll never speak another word of dialogue ever again.\n\nThis stork doesn't have a very good track record. This is the same guy who lost a baby gorilla, knocked out Bugs Bunny and delivered him to a bunch of apes. He's performed by Rob Paulsen here, using the same voice he used for Concord Condor on Tiny Toon Adventures.\n\nAs the hippos would say, I made a faux pas back when I said we'd never see those little oxpeckers again. They don't say a single word, but they sit on the hippo's shoulders throughout the entire cartoon. No sign of Gina Embryo though, thank God.\n\nThere's some great drawings of Brain during this shot, especially the weary look in the first shot right after he pops out of the water. This whole sequence, which includes Marita violently scrubbing him with a brush, is very well animated.\n\nBrain isn't expecting a pitcher of scalding hot water to suddenly be dumped on his head. LaMarche's scream is absolutely perfect, not to mention that great \"clang\" sound effect heard when Brain leaps up and slams into an overhead light.\n\nHere's a fat joke that I like. Flavio and Marita are just so casual about smashing through the wall as they enter the doctors office. The other patients don't even react to it. Check out the kid with an entire skateboard in his mouth.\n\nRecognize this guy? It's \"the little man from the draft board\" from the classic 1945 Bob Clampett cartoon Draftee Daffy. \"Drafty, isn't it?\" he says as he enters, referencing a 1957 Chuck Jones short starring Ralph Phillips.\n\n\"My, that's a lot of zeros!\" That's a bit of an understatement.\n\n\"As soon as I lay my hands on my trust I'm out of here to take over the world!\" I love the expression Brain settles on when he finishes this sentence.\n\nAs Brain watches TV and realizes the mistake he's made, the camera cuts closer to his face as he eyes suddenly quiver and grow smaller. Another well done shot, emphasizing his horrific realization.\n\nI love the dainty way Flavio gently plops Brain into the stork's hand, thrilled to finally be rid of him.\n\nHey, look who it is. It's Scratchy's date from \"Drive Insane\" and \"The Party\". I guess this is her day job. She's named Frau Hassenfeffer here. Could that be her real name?\n\nI like the design of the Rockefeller baby in this shot, as well as the great animation as Brain passes out. But who I am I kidding, I just wanted an excuse to get a shot of Pinky in here. We're a few episodes away from one last Pinky and the Brain cartoon.\n\nButtons and Mindy intro\n\nMindy's mom heads off to the \"Mother of the Year\" grand finals, putting Buttons in charge of Mindy and telling him to stay out of her rose bushes. As soon as she leaves, the White Rabbit shows up in the yard, claiming to be \"tardy to a party\". The rabbit, Mindy and Buttons enter an opening in the trunk of a tree and end up in Wonderland, right in the middle of the Mad Hatter's tea party. Deciding he'd rather have espresso than tea, the Hatter tosses all the plates and cutlery into a huge espresso machine, followed by Mindy. Buttons saves her just in time but falls into the machine himself. Entering a house, the White Rabbit and Mindy eat some cookies and shrink to only a few inches high, while Buttons drinks a glass of milk that causes him to grow so big he destroys the house.\n\nNext, Mindy encounters Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber (caricatures of Jeff Bridges and Jim Carrey, because references to that movie will never be painfully dated) followed by the Cheshire Cat, played by a bizarrely off model Rita. The cat enjoys it when Mindy pets her, but decides to maul Buttons when he rushes in and steps on her tail. Finally, Mindy comes across the playing cards, who are painting the Queen's roses red. When the Queen of Hearts arrives, she becomes furious when Mindy calls her \"lady\" and snubs her, and demands the toddler's head. Buttons meanwhile, is sliced apart by some ax-wielding cards and is slammed around by people playing croquette. After a short trial scene that goes nowhere, a chase breaks out, and Buttons and Mindy soon find themselves back at home, where Buttons makes a mess out of the rose bushes. After mom scolds Buttons (though she calms down when he hands her a rose), Mindy gives him a hug, saying, \"Fuzzy bunny good. Fuzzy Buttons better!\"\n\nOut of the three Buttons and Mindy shorts to be produced during the Kids WB years, \"Mindy is Wonderland\" is unquestionably the weakest. Granted, there are many season one entries that are far worse, but this cartoon really seems below average compared to \"Buttons in Ows\" or \"Night of the Living Buttons\", two shorts that used good writing and really strong Wang animation to their advantage. Unfortunately, this cartoon - the final Mindy and Buttons segment ever made - finds the characters back with Akom. However, bland animation isn't really the biggest problem this cartoon has. Some of the rhyming dialogue is exceptionally lame, and the Dumb and Dumber sequence is probably the most embarrassing movie reference I've ever had to sit through on this show. While it's nice to see Rita again (and indeed, that is Bernadette Peters doing the voice) she looks so off that one gets the impression that Akom forgot how to handle her. This short is so obviously using the 1951 Disney classic as its inspiration, but the Mad Hatter is a little too uncomfortably close to the Ed Wynn version for me, as if they couldn't think of any other way of interpreting that character. In general, this whole short seems primarily occupied with Mindy meeting the various Lewis Carroll characters, so there's not much for poor Buttons to do but stumble around and get injured again and again. True, that happened in the previous two cartoons as well, but the Wang animation was able to make that stuff funny. There are a couple of isolated moments that work (I like Jim Cummings as one of the cards, and Buttons giving Mindy's mom a rose is cute) but overall, this is probably the most forgettable Buttons and Mindy cartoon since \"Mermaid Mindy\" in episode 63, at least for me.\n\nAnd as previously mentioned, this is the very last Buttons and Mindy segment. Although they weren't headlining characters, the pair was still relatively popular, despite the oftentimes mediocre nature of their cartoons. As I've said many times before, the premise practically demanded strong animation in order to work, yet the majority of these cartoons were tossed to second string studios such as Akom and Freelance. On top of that, many of the writers for these cartoons were never able to move past the \"dumb dog gets pulverized\" shtick to really elevate them to a higher level. The shorts that really try to shoot for something above merely adequate (such as \"Les Boutons et le Ballon\", \"Whistle Stop Mindy\", \"Buttons in Ows\" and \"Night of the Living Buttons\") show that there was a hell of a lot of potential in this series that was very rarely tapped. More often than not, we ended up with forgettable duds like \"Up the Crazy River\", \"Mesozoic Mindy\", \"What a Dump\", \"Super Buttons\" and \"Mermaid Mindy\", which regurgitate the same tired gags again and again with nothing interesting visually to make up for it. For the most part, when I was younger the Buttons and Mindy intro was usually pretty good incentive to change the channel. With the exception of one quick cameo a couple of episodes from now, these characters don't appear at all in season five. In fact, they're going to more or less remain MIA until Wakko's Wish where, paired up with some TMS animation, they come off a lot better than many of the other characters in the movie.\n\nAs Mindy travels down the rabbit hole, she encounter several items she's chased after earlier in the series, including the lollipop from \"Operation Lollipop\", the clown car from \"The Mindy 500\" and the train from \"Whistle Stop Mindy\". Nice group of callbacks, although it's interesting that two of them came from the \"season two\" leftover episodes.\n\nVisually, the Mad Hatter doesn't recall the Disney version all that much, but the voice is clearly modeled after Ed Wynn. Jim Cummings performs the voice, although he's uncredited for this episode.\n\nHonestly, this scene just hurts to watch. The movie was all right. but I'm not sure why they needed to reference it here. It definitely doesn't hold up all that well. And Buttons getting nailed by two logs? That hadda sting!\n\nThe voice and the basic design clearly mark this as Rita, but at the same time, the whole character just feels off. If this is supposed to be Rita, why isn't there a notch taken out of one of her ears. Additionally, her suddenly burst of anger is really out of character. Even more interesting, Peters is credited as \"The Cheshire Cat\" in the credits, when she's always credited as Rita separately from the rest of the cast. So is this Rita or not?\n\nMindy has a \"why\" conversation with the cards, allowing us to hear Cummings use something close to his Negaduck voice as one card as the usual back and forth with her.\n\nThis exact same gag happened in \"Buttons in Ows\", only it was much funnier there. And just as an aside, \"Buttons in Ows\" is a really damn funny title. I laugh whenever I recall it.\n\nCharacter Cameo: the Warners run past during the climactic chase, pursued as always by Ralph. I don't believe there are many more of these run-thoughs left, if there are any at all.\n\nRalph's Wedding\n\nThe big day has arrived! Ralph is finally getting married, and the entire Animaniacs cast (well, most of them) is attending the wedding. But to everyone's surprise, Ralph's bride turns out to be none other than Chicken Boo! Just then, Ralph wakes up for his dream and discovers his wife sitting up in bed eating a bucket of chicken, complete with an image of Chicken Boo as Colonel Sanders. Holding up the bucket, Ralph and his wife announce, \"Daaahh, we loves chicken!\" and the segment ends. Yes, this cartoon really is as stupid as it sounds, and is another one of those weird Ralph appearances that seem to be all over this season. Wang's animation is good (especially some great drawings of Ralph at the very end) and it gives us another chance to see a whole bunch of characters together. Strangely, while Dot is one of the bridesmaids, Yakko and Wakko are nowhere to be seen, making episode 90 the second show in a row not to include the oldest Warner sibling. \"The Pitter Patter of Little Feet\" may be the strongest cartoon in this episode, but \"Ralph's Wedding\" is probably the most memorable, mainly because of how ridiculous it is.\n\nWe learn a few interesting things from this invite. Ralph's parents are still alive and his dad's name is Rudolph, while Ralph's middle name is Theodore. And his last name really is Guard. \"Ralph T. Guard\", get it? He's actually credited by that name in Wakko's Wish.\n\nWhat's up with Vena Whaleen making another cameo alongside Miss Flamiel? This is the second time they've done this.\n\nApart from the Warner cameo in \"Mindy and the Wonderland\" and the variable verse, Dot is the only Warner to appear in this episode, much like Wakko was the only Warner to appear in the previous one. This is actually going to be the last episode to not include a Warners short, with the exception of episode 98. If anything, the Warners are going to dominate much of the rest of the series.\n\nDespite how much they appeared in season three, this season is very light on Slappy and Skippy. They haven't even gotten any dialogue since episode 85. A two-act Slappytoon animated by Startoons is right around the corner...\n\nSo the hippos got an invite, but Yakko and Wakko didn't show up? What gives?\n\nFor whatever reason, Pinky extends his hand to Brain, as if expecting a ring. Brain ends that nonsense by bopping Pinky on the head. What exactly did Pinky think he was doing?\n\nMindy, Buttons, Plotz and Scratchy comprise the rest of the wedding guests. Scratchansniff is also the one to provide the usual \"He's a chicken, I tell you!\" line, the last time he's going to get dialogue for a long time.\n\nI love these drawings of Ralph, some of the very last really great work from Wang that we're going to get on the show. While their work on Pinky and the Brain got even better going into that show's third season, their work on Animaniacs would never quite be the same from this point on.\n\nJoke Credit: On The WB, Big Kids Go First: In Reality, Big Kids Sleep In"
