Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name.[3] It was created by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who also served as executive producers, and who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan.[4] Episodes first aired on HBO starting on September 9, 2001. Critically acclaimed, the series won the Emmy and Golden Globe awards for best miniseries.\n\nThe series dramatizes the history of \"Easy\" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. It begins during Easy Company's paratrooper training and follows its participation in the Western Front of World War II. The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took some literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure.[5][6] The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Each episode begins with excerpts from interviews with some of the survivors, who are identified by name only at the end of the finale.\n\nThe title of the book and series comes from the St. Crispin’s Day speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is recited by Carwood Lipton in the series finale.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nOver the course of ten episodes, Band of Brothers depicts a dramatized account of Easy Company's exploits during World War II.[4]\n\nEpisodes include their training at Camp Toccoa, the American airborne landings in Normandy, Operation Market Garden, the Siege of Bastogne, the invasion of Germany, the liberation of the Kaufering concentration camp, the taking of the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest) in Berchtesgaden, the occupation of Germany, and finally the war's end.[4]\n\nRichard Winters is the central character, shown working to accomplish the company's missions and keep his men together and safe. While the series features a large ensemble cast, each episode generally focuses on a single character, following his action.[4]\n\nAs the series is based on historical events, the fates of the characters reflect those of the persons on which they are based. Many either die or sustain serious wounds which lead to their being sent home. Other soldiers recover after treatment in field hospitals and rejoin their units on the front line. Their experiences, and the moral, mental, and physical hurdles they must overcome, are central to the story's narrative.\n\nIt follows the story from their initial training starting in 1942 to the end of World War II. They parachuted behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day in support of the landings at Utah beach, participated in the liberation of Carentan and again parachuted into action during Operation Market Garden. They also liberated a concentration camp and were the first to enter Hitler's mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleDirected byWritten byMain characterOriginal air dateUS viewers\n\n(millions)1\"Currahee\"Phil Alden RobinsonTeleplay by : Erik Jendresen and Tom HanksRichard Winters and Herbert SobelSeptember 9, 2001 ( )9.90[7]\n\nIn 1942, Easy Company jump trains at Camp Toccoa under First Lieutenant Herbert Sobel, a strict disciplinarian who goes out of his way to find fault with his men. The company is shipped to England in September 1943, and as training progresses, Sobel's inadequacy as a leader in the field becomes evident. Now-Captain Sobel initiates a dispute with Lieutenant Richard \"Dick\" Winters, who requests a trial by court martial. These factors lead Easy's non-commissioned officers to resign en masse. Colonel Robert Sink, the regiment's commander, reassigns Sobel to command a parachuting school for non-infantry personnel. With new leadership, Easy Company prepares for Operation Overlord.\n\n2\"Day of Days\"Richard LoncraineJohn OrloffRichard WintersSeptember 9, 2001 ( )9.90[7]\n\nOn June 6, 1944, Easy Company parachutes into Normandy, but is scattered and many land miles away from their designated drop zones. Most of Easy reconnects, but its company commander, Lieutenant Thomas Meehan, is missing. Winters assumes command and successfully leads a group in destroying German artillery emplacements firing on Utah Beach from Brécourt Manor. Winters also discovers a map of all German artillery emplacements in Normandy. A number of Easy's men earn combat decorations for their part in the attack, including Winters, who is awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\n3\"Carentan\"Mikael SalomonE. Max FryeAlbert BlitheSeptember 16, 2001 ( )7.27[9]\n\nEasy fights in the Battle of Carentan and loses several men. Rumors begin to circulate that Lieutenant Ronald Speirs killed a group of German prisoners. Private Albert Blithe, who has been struggling with shell shock, is finally spurred into action by Winters during the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Several days later, Blithe is shot through the neck by a sniper while on patrol.\n\nNote: The episode ends with the inaccurate statement that Blithe never recovered from his wounds and died in 1948. In reality, he recovered and continued to serve in the Army until his death in Germany as an active-duty serviceman in 1967.[8]\n\n4\"Replacements\"David NutterGraham Yost and Bruce C. McKennaDenver \"Bull\" RandlemanSeptember 23, 2001 ( )6.29[10]\n\nReplacements join Easy Company and struggle to be accepted by the veterans who fought at Normandy. Winters is promoted to captain. Sobel is the regiment's new supply officer. The company parachutes into the Netherlands as part of Operation Market Garden and liberates Eindhoven. During combat in Nuenen, the replacements integrate themselves with the company, but Easy is forced to retreat. Denver \"Bull\" Randleman is left behind. Wounded, he hides in a barn and engages in close quarters combat with a German soldier. He is reunited with the rest of the company the following day.\n\n5\"Crossroads\"Tom HanksErik JendresenRichard WintersSeptember 30, 2001 ( )6.13[11]\n\nWinters writes an after-action report on Easy's actions during a German counter offensive on the Nijmegen salient; he is troubled by the fact that he shot an unarmed, teenage Waffen-SS soldier during the battle. Winters is promoted to battalion executive officer, and command of Easy is given to \"Moose\" Heyliger.\n\nEasy Company assists Lieutenant Colonel David Dobie of the British 1st Airborne Division in Operation Pegasus to rescue 140 of his comrades. The operation succeeds, and the rescued British troops celebrate with Easy. Heyliger is injured in a friendly fire incident, and command of the company passes to Lieutenant Norman Dike before Easy is rushed to Bastogne to fight in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\n6\"Bastogne\"David LelandBruce C. McKennaEugene RoeOctober 7, 2001 ( )6.42[12]\n\nEasy faces harsh winter conditions in the Ardennes, running dangerously low on supplies. Combat medic Eugene \"Doc\" Roe helps his fellow soldiers where he can, while also scrounging for supplies. He befriends a Belgian nurse named Renée; she is later killed in a German bombing raid. Easy and other American units are surrounded, but General McAuliffe, their commander, rejects a German demand to surrender.\n\n7\"The Breaking Point\"David FrankelGraham YostCarwood LiptonOctober 14, 2001 ( )6.43[13]\n\nEasy holds the line near Foy, Belgium, losing numerous soldiers including Hoobler, who dies after accidentally shooting himself with a Luger pistol. Winters and the men worry about Norman Dike, who is frequently absent without explanation. First Sergeant Carwood Lipton attempts to keep Easy's morale up. Lieutenant Lynn \"Buck\" Compton watches in horror as his close friends William Guarnere and Joe Toye each lose a leg to shelling, and he too is pulled from the line. During the assault on Foy, Dike freezes up during an attack, so Winters orders Speirs to relieve him. Victorious but having taken heavy casualties, Easy takes shelter in a church, where Lipton is told he has been given a field commission as a second lieutenant and Captain Speirs is officially assigned command of Easy.\n\n8\"The Last Patrol\"Tony ToErik Bork and Bruce C. McKennaDavid WebsterOctober 21, 2001 ( )5.95[14]\n\nIn Haguenau, Easy adjusts to leaving the combat zone and gives a cold welcome to Private David Webster, who did not break out of the hospital to rejoin the company like others; and new replacement Second Lieutenant Henry Jones, fresh from West Point. Jones and Webster participate in a night raid across the river to get prisoners for interrogation, which gains them some respect. Winters is promoted to major, Lipton's commission becomes official, and Jones is promoted to first lieutenant and transferred to the regimental staff.\n\n9\"Why We Fight\"David FrankelJohn OrloffLewis NixonOctober 28, 2001 ( )6.08[15]\n\nAs Captain Lewis Nixon scrounges for his favored whisky, Vat 69, Easy Company enters Nazi Germany. Nixon is distraught after learning that his wife is divorcing him; he is demoted to operations officer for the battalion. A small patrol of Easy Company men stumble upon a concentration camp near Landsberg and free the surviving prisoners.\n\nEasy secures food for the survivors, but the regiment's surgeon warns of refeeding syndrome; the survivors have to remain in the camp so they can be monitored. The German locals deny knowing about the camp. The 101st Airborne's commander, General Taylor, imposes martial law and orders all able-bodied civilians from ages 14 to 80 to clean up the camp, including removing the bodies. Nixon informs Easy that Adolf Hitler has committed suicide.\n\n10\"Points\"Mikael SalomonErik Jendresen and Erik BorkRichard WintersNovember 4, 2001 ( )5.05[16]\n\nEasy captures the Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden without resistance, and the end of the war in Europe is announced. Finding a collection of alcoholic beverages in a cellar at Hermann Göring's house, Winters allows the company to celebrate before they travel to Austria to become an occupying force. It is then announced that the division will be redeployed to the Pacific Theater, but those with enough points will get to go home. General Taylor authorizes a drawing for each company to rotate one soldier home, and Staff Sergeant Shifty Powers wins Easy's drawing but is severely injured in an automobile accident on his way to the airfield. Private Liebgott leads a trio that tracks down and summarily executes a concentration camp commandant at a farm.\n\nDesiring to redeploy sooner, Winters applies for a transfer to the 13th Airborne, but is denied. Despite the war's end, Easy Company men continue to be injured or die. Easy oversees the surrender of 25,000 German troops in Zell am See. Over a company baseball game, Winters narrates the fates of some of the men. He interrupts the game to announce the surrender of the Empire of Japan, which ends the war, and then narrates Nixon's fate and finally his own. The episode concludes with interviews with actual surviving Easy Company members.\n\n11 (Bonus)\"We Stand Alone Together\"Mark CowenWilliam RichterEasy Company real-life membersNovember 10, 2001 ( )Unknown\n\nSubtitled The Men of Easy Company, an official companion documentary included on home video for the miniseries and available on streaming services. Consists of interviews with the surviving real-life members of Easy Company including Winters, Lipton, Guarnere, Heffron and Powers and also photos and video from and related to their service and their annual reunions.

On June 7, 2001, 47 Easy Company veterans were flown to Paris and then traveled by chartered train to the site, where the series premiered.[22][23] Chrysler was a sponsor, as its Jeeps were used in the series.[24] Chrysler spent $5 million to $15 million on its advertising campaign, using footage from Band of Brothers.[24] Each of the spots was reviewed and approved by the co-executive producers Hanks and Spielberg.[24]\n\nThe BBC paid £7 million ($10.1 million) as co-production partner, the most it had ever paid for a bought-in program, and screened it on BBC Two. Originally, it was to have aired on BBC One but was moved to allow an \"uninterrupted ten-week run\", with the BBC denying that this was because the series was not sufficiently mainstream.[25][26] Negotiations were monitored by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who spoke personally to Spielberg.[27]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series was shot over eight to ten months on Ellenbrooke Fields, at Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England. This location had been used to shoot the film Saving Private Ryan.[18][21] Various sets were built, including replicas on the large open field of 12 European towns, among them Bastogne, Belgium; Eindhoven, Netherlands; and Carentan, France.[28][23] North Weald Airfield in Essex was used for shots depicting the take-offs for the D-Day Normandy landings.\n\nThe village of Hambleden, in Buckinghamshire, England, was used extensively in the early episodes to depict the company's training in England, as well as in later scenes. The scenes set in Germany and Austria were shot in Switzerland, in and near the village of Brienz in the Bernese Oberland, and at the nearby Hotel Giessbach.\n\nHistorical accuracy\n\n[edit]\n\nTo preserve historical accuracy, the writers conducted additional research. One source was the memoir of Easy Company soldier David Kenyon Webster, Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich (1994).[citation needed] This was published by LSU Press, following renewed interest in World War II and more than 30 years after his death in a boating accident. In Band of Brothers Ambrose quoted liberally from Webster's unpublished diary entries, with permission from his estate.[3][note 2]\n\nThe production team consulted Dale Dye, a retired United States Marine Corps captain and consultant on Saving Private Ryan, as well as with most of the surviving Easy Company veterans, including Richard Winters, Bill Guarnere, Frank Perconte, Ed Heffron, and Amos Taylor.[18][29] Dye (who portrays Colonel Robert Sink) instructed the actors in a 10-day boot camp at the Longmoor Military Camp in Hampshire, culminating with parachute training at RAF Brize Norton.[29][30][31]\n\nThe production aimed for accuracy in the detail of weapons and costumes. Simon Atherton, the weapons master, corresponded with veterans to match weapons to scenes, and assistant costume designer Joe Hobbs used photos and veteran accounts.[18]\n\nMost actors had contact with the individuals they were to portray before filming, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site.[18] Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: \"We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down a vast number of characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this.\"[23] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.[32]\n\nShortly after the premiere of the series, Tom Hanks asked Major Winters what he thought of Band of Brothers. The major responded, \"I wish that it would have been more authentic. I was hoping for an 80 percent solution.\" Hanks responded, \"Look, Major, this is Hollywood. At the end of the day we will be hailed as geniuses if we get this 12 percent right. We are going to shoot for 17 percent.\"\n\nThe liberation of one of the Kaufering subcamps of Dachau was depicted in episode 9 (\"Why We Fight\"); however, the 101st Airborne Division arrived at Kaufering Lager IV subcamp on the day after[34] it was discovered by the 134th Ordnance Maintenance Battalion of the 12th Armored Division, on April 27, 1945.[35][36] German historian and Holocaust researcher Anton Posset worked with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks as a consultant, providing photographs of the liberators and documentation of the survivor's reports he had collected over the years. The camp was reconstructed in England for the miniseries.[37]\n\nIt is uncertain which Allied unit was first to reach the Kehlsteinhaus. Several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division.[38][39][note 3] Reputedly members of the 7th went as far as the elevator to the Kehlsteinhaus,[38] with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top.[42] However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus.[43][failed verification] Elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command,[44][45] and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.\n\nMajor Dick Winters, who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 506th PIR in May 1945, stated that they entered Berchtesgaden shortly after noon on May 5. He challenged competing claims stating, \"If the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Division was first in Berchtesgaden, just where did they go? Berchtesgaden is a relatively small community. I walked into the Berchtesgaden Hof with Lieutenant Welsh and saw nobody other than some servants. Goering's Officers' Club and wine cellar certainly would have caught the attention of a French soldier from LeClerc's 2nd Armored Division, or a rifleman from the U.S. 3rd Division. I find it hard to imagine, if the 3rd Division was there first, why they left those beautiful Mercedes staff cars untouched for our men.\"\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nBand of Brothers has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.1/10 and based on 34 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Band of Brothers offers a visceral, intense look at the horrors of war – and the sacrifices of the millions of ordinary people who served.\"[47] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gives the miniseries a score of 87 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[48]\n\nCNN's Paul Clinton said that the miniseries \"is a remarkable testament to that generation of citizen soldiers, who responded when called upon to save the world for democracy and then quietly returned to build the nation that we now all enjoy, and all too often take for granted\".[49] Caryn James of The New York Times called it \"an extraordinary 10-part series that masters its greatest challenge: it balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war.\" James also remarked on the generation gap between most viewers and characters, suggesting this was a significant hurdle.[50] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that the series was \"significantly flawed and yet absolutely extraordinary—just like the men it portrays,\" rating the series four out of four stars. He noted however that it was hard to identify with individual characters during crowded battle scenes.[51]\n\nPhilip French of The Guardian commented that he had \"seen nothing in the cinema this past year that impressed me as much as BBC2's 10-part Band of Brothers, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and Ken Loach's The Navigators on Channel 4\", and that it was \"one of the best films ever made about men in war and superior in most ways to Saving Private Ryan.\"[52] Matt Seaton, also in The Guardian, wrote that the film's production was \"on such a scale that in an ad hoc, inadvertent way it gives one a powerful sense of what really was accomplished during the D-Day invasion - the extraordinary logistical effort of moving men and matériel in vast quantities.\"[53]\n\nTom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that though the series is \"at times visually astonishing,\" it suffers from \"disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy.\" Shales observed that the characters are hard to identify: \"Few of the characters stand out strikingly against the backdrop of the war. In fact, this show is all backdrop and no frontdrop. When you watch two hours and still aren't quite sure who the main characters are, something is wrong.\"[54]\n\nBand of Brothers has become a benchmark for World War II series. The German series Generation War, for example, was characterized by critics as Band of Brüder (the German word for \"Brothers\").[55]\n\nRatings\n\n[edit]\n\nBand of Brothers' September 9, 2001 premiere drew almost 10 million viewers.[56] Two days later, the September 11 attacks occurred, and HBO immediately ceased its marketing campaign.[56] The third episode drew 7.2 million viewers[56] and the last episode received almost 5.1 million viewers, the smallest audience.[57]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series was nominated for 20 Primetime Emmy Awards and won seven, including Outstanding Miniseries and Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special.[58] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television,[59] American Film Institute Award for TV Movie or Miniseries of the Year,[60] Producers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Producer of Long-Form Television,[61] and the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Movies, Miniseries, and Specials.[62]\n\nThe show was selected for a Peabody Award for \"relying on both history and memory to create a new tribute to those who fought to preserve liberty.\"[63] In September 2019, The Guardian ranked the show 68th on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, stating that it \"expanded the horizons – and budgets – of prestige TV\".[64]\n\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\n\n[edit]\n\nCategory Nominee(s) Episode Result Outstanding Miniseries Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman, Tony To, Stephen E.
