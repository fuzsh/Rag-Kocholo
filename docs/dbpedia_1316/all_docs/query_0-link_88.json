        "text": "This research is a contrastive study of euphemism strategies in both Arab and British media discourse with the purpose of discovering the similarities and differences between Arab and British sporting commentators when using euphemistic expressions in their commentaries on football matches. The study is an attempt to investigate the motives that force both Arab and British sporting commentators to use such euphemistic strategies. This study also tries to investigate the most frequent strategies of euphemism used by both Arab and British commentators. It also tries to discover the most frequent topics in which the Arab and British commentators use euphemism strategies in order to soften the meaning. Moreover, this study attempts to investigate to what extent the social context governs the usage of certain strategies. As for the data, the researcher collected 20 matches with Arabic commentary from different channels and 20 matches with English commentary from different channels. These matches are obtained and downloaded from www.youtube.com. Although the data of each sample are analyzed separately, the procedures followed were identical. Data analysis is based on the 26 euphemistic strategies. The two different samples are analyzed to find which of the 26 euphemistic strategies are used; and which of these are more frequent than others. A comparison is conducted between the two sets of data to find out the aspects of similarities and differences between them. Finally, a qualitative analysis is conducted to explain and investigate these differences and similarities from a cultural perspective. The findings of the study revealed that both Arabic and British Commentators are euphemism oriented, each in his own way. Though they have some things in common, they differ in their use of some certain euphemistic strategies. They also use euphemism a lot in such topic as death and hard times. As for the differences between Arabic and British commentators, Arabic commentators tend to use euphemism more often than British ones. Moreover, the results show that Arab commentators tend to use “Overstatement”, “Particularization”, “Metaphor”, and “Implication”. In contrast, British commentators tend to use “Synonyms”, “Jargon”, and “Understatement” respectively. Key words: Figurative Language, Euphemism, Media Discourse, Euphemistic Strategies, Death.\n\nIs it acceptable to virtually ignore taboo language in the teaching of ESL/EFL, as has been traditionally the case, given its prevalence in everyday modern life? This dissertation examines whether or not taboo language should indeed be taught to ESL/EFL learners, and, if so, how. The methodology for doing so first ascertains what taboo language is by examining its origins and its changing nature while also reflecting on its psychological and sociolinguistic functions. This investigation produces enough evidence for concluding that taboo language is an endemic part of our overall grammar and that it is linguistically of equal importance to any other kind of language. Nevertheless is this a strong enough reason to include it in ESL/EFL pedagogy? To answer this question some complementary empirical research is undertaken in the form of two questionnaires assessing both teacher and learner attitudes and opinions on the matter. The results show some interesting trends, not least that a significant minority of participants believe taboo language should be taught in the classroom. It does not however result in any significant SPSS findings. Therefore some theoretical arguments for and against its inclusion in any ESL/EFL curriculum are debated. Following the debate, it is ultimately determined that taboo language needs to be embraced in most ESL/EFL classrooms in some shape or form, as it is a fact of life that ESL/EFL learners need to be aware of. However the arguments against its teaching highlight several issues that need to be taken very seriously if such a project is to be undertaken, including the danger of causing offense and the need for intensive preparation in advance in order to teach it positively, effectively and properly contextualized. A methodology is then proposed on how to overcome the fear factor that impedes its teaching. General issues to do with learners, teachers, class format and content matter are examined in the effort to overcome any potential constraints. Subsequently several sociolinguistic and metalinguistic approaches to teaching about taboo language are proffered that can be used as a framework and/or a catalyst for teaching taboo terms themselves, if learners are so willing. Indeed these approaches are of pedagogical interest in themselves. Furthermore, given the validity of these approaches, it is the opinion of this researcher that it would be totally remiss to not to include taboo language in the teaching of ESL/EFL in many cases.\n\nLinguistic taboo has been relegated for a long time to a peripheral position within Linguistics, due to its social stigmatization and inherent linguistic complexity. Recently, though, there has been a renewed interest in revisiting the phenomenon, especially from cognitive frameworks. This volume is the first collection of papers dealing with linguistic taboo from that perspective. The volume gathers 15 chapters, which provide novel insights into a broad range of taboo phenomena (euphemism, dysphemism, swearing, political correctness, coprolalia, etc.) from the fields of sexuality, diseases, death, war, ageing or religion. With a special focus on lexical semantics, the authors in the volume work within Cognitive Linguistics frameworks such as conceptual metaphor and metonymy, cultural conceptualization or cognitive sociolinguistics, but also at the interface of pragmatics, discourse analysis, applied linguistics, cognitive science or psychiatry. This volume provides theoretical reflections and case studies based on new methods and data from varied languages (English, Spanish, Polish, Dutch, Persian, Gikũyũ and Egyptian Arabic). As such, it moves towards a new generation of linguistic taboo studies."
