        "text": "Welcome to The Acronym’s Senior Wills of 2024! After much hard work this year, our senior class has (finally) decided to relax and write some heartfelt messages to their underclassmen. That said, we hope you appreciate these messages left behind by the Class of 2024 as they journey on into college. All of the wills from Ishan Buyyanapragada to Zuyu Liu are in this page, and all of the wills from Aashima Sisodia to Iris Amit can be found here.\n\nIshan Buyyanapragada\n\nJaden Willis\n\nJJ Park\n\nJoey Paras\n\nJoshua Lee\n\nKate DeGreve\n\nKohl Vonder Haar\n\nKomal Chivukula\n\nLaasya Nagumalli\n\nLaura Cervantes\n\nLuke Mauk\n\nMaitreyi Pandey\n\nManasa Balasubramanian\n\nManya Davis\n\nMarcus Kubon\n\nMars Wylie\n\nMelinda Yuan\n\nMichael Zyskowski\n\nMuna Onwuameze\n\nMyra Mensah\n\nNate Landig\n\nNathaniel Huang\n\nNishna Aerabati\n\nNitya Jakka\n\nNoah Walker\n\nNour Husseini\n\nRaghav Sinha\n\nRohan Patkar\n\nRyan Li\n\nSabriya Attia\n\nSahil Veeravalli\n\nShawn Crimmins\n\nShivani Chirumamilla\n\nSindhu Chalasani\n\nSrihari Gurugubelli\n\nSukanya Ghosh\n\nStephen Walsh\n\nTate Schneider\n\nVictoria Nalepka\n\nVidyoot Senthilvenkatesh\n\nVignesh Tiruvannamalai\n\nWill Hellrung\n\nWinston Mattson\n\nZuyu Liu\n\nIshan Buyyanapragada\n\nTo Kumara Venkata Sadkrith Malladi, I will you an illustrious Carnatic music career. Listening to your frequent recordings on Messenger fills me with unimaginable joy, and I’m happy to see another person share a passion with me. Never hesitate to reach out if you want some good concert recordings—I’ve been waiting to share these with others.\n\nTo Vincent You, I will You a successful Vice President campaign and temporary push-up-reset coupon. Last I checked, your push-up debt is well into the thousands, so I think a reset might be necessary. Hopefully you have learned from your mistakes. I also will you another soft stuffed animal since I feel you can add another one to the three you already have on your bed. As thanks for these gifts, I expect you to give me Ferrero Rochers and popcorn packets for the rest of my time at IMSA.\n\nTo Shashikiran Salavath, I will you unlimited extensions on AdPro assignments. Those pesky—and sometimes downright impossible—quizzes are the bane of my existence. I also will you a few popcorn packets and other snacks, because being from Bloomington and coming to IMSA can be challenging at times. You’re very smart—I hope you have an amazing senior year and I’m excited to see what you’ll be up to in the future.\n\nTo Andrew Wong, I will you some of my unparalleled skills on the basketball court. Beating you relentlessly for the past two years was really fun and I hope you continue to hoop in your senior year and beyond. A few tips: When you’re shooting, keep your elbows a little more tucked in, keep your hand up after the shot, and land with feet square with your shoulders. If you have any other doubts, reach out to me anytime.\n\nTo the incredibly talented CCE underclassmen, I will you a new year of amazing events and club collaborations. To the new co-liaisons, Shanya and Sydney, I will y’all a week of rest. Looking at your colorful Google calendars gives me a heart attack sometimes, so I hope you take the time to rest in your senior year. To the rest of the exec board—Dael, Evette, Lucy, Sammie, Marina, Alvena, José, Harper, and Andrew—I will you all the opportunity to use all the skills you’ve learnt at CCE so far to bring much-needed change to the IMSA campus. I had so much fun and made so many memories during my three years in CCE, and I hope you all will do the same.\n\nTo Ibrahim Bah, I will you the Movie Head title for CLASH next year. The totally-not-against-the-rules Chicago trip with you was incredibly fun and I hope that you’ll uphold the 1505 movie legacy in your senior year. Thanks for letting us use your camera, and I hope you’ll be able to hone in your ISP skills and win first next year (unless 1505 gets robbed again like they did this year).\n\nTo the TAS Underclassmen—Netra, Anjali, Navya, Dhivija, Mahima, and Vivienne—I will you another stellar year (see what I did there). I know senioritis might’ve gotten the better of me late into the year, but it’s been a pleasure to see the interest in space at IMSA. I hope you’ll continue to foster this passion in the upcoming years and beyond. For an actual gift, however, you all should ask Brandon for his space-themed spotify playlist because it is incredible.\n\nJaden Willis\n\nTo Tristen, I will you peace. I call you twin because when we met you were just like me. Now we aren’t those same people anymore. You’ve genuinely come so far as a person and I could not be more proud of you. Watching you blossom into the person you are now has been so amazing. You are genuinely an inspiration to me. Thank you for all the nights staying up late talking about nothing and everything. Thank you for showing me that it does get better and that I can do anything if I put my mind to it. I could only do that because I saw you do it. You deserve the absolute world and more. Thank you for everything Twin. You know I love you.\n\nTo the SCRJ board, I will you more engagement. Bruvva. This year was hard, genuinely. I know personally, there was more I could have done and I think I’ll always have that in the back of my mind. With people barely engaging, it was hard for me to want to do it myself. Y’all gotta do better after me. I’m sorry I didn’t do more. But, I leave it all in your hands. Thank you for everything we did together. I genuinely appreciate every single one of you so much. Good luck!\n\nTo BSU board, I will y’all an enjoyable and active sophomore class. Aye y’all, try your hardest to get people involved next year. Genuinely. BSU is something that I had been interested in my whole time here, but I didn’t act on that until the end of Junior year. Help some sophomores explore those interests that they may have and get the engagement up. I wish I had started sooner because then I would’ve had a better idea as to what I was doing. I hope the future culture shows go well. I hope the meetings end up going way more smoothly than they did this year because there was so much dysfunction in that room oh my gosh. But y’all got it next year tho for sure. Good luck!\n\nTo 1504 C Wing, I will all of you, the best of luck. Make your next years here as enjoyable as you possibly can. Enjoy these next few years and have an amazing time. Keep up the community that Deondre has worked so hard to build. You have hopefully enjoyed it so far so keep doing it. You will have to put in a lot of effort to keep that up though. Just saying.\n\nTo Xander K., I will you some common sense. Bruv your slow moments are worse than Michael’s. He just IS the moment. But man I’m telling you, it’s bad. Imma be honest though, you were my favorite sophomore. That’s the truth. Thank you for sitting next to me on the bus rides for basketball. I really appreciate it. And the random conversations we had about nothing all the time. I really do appreciate everything. All love.\n\nTo Ikaika, I will you a new name. It was really funny when you started texting me the summer before you started here. You were the first junior I had talked to. It was really interesting to get to know you throughout these last couple of years. It’s been great man. All love.\n\nTo Laksh, I will you more oversized tees. Aye bro you were one of my favorite juniors. We def talked a lot more last year and I wish we did more this year. It was a lil more difficult to just run into you but the times where we did talk, I genuinely did enjoy it. Looking at you in the basketball uniform was always hilarious because you were so short and didn’t fill it out. I know you’ve been in the gym tho, I be seeing you. That’s why I said oversized tees earlier. You’re def real close to filling out regular ones, but you just don’t ever wear them. It’s hilarious. Nothing but love bro, you know that. .\n\nTo Angel Castillo, I will you true happiness. I always loved the late nights staying up late talking to you. You’re genuinely an amazing person and deserve so so so much love. I’m happy for you with everything you’ve told me and I hope and pray that everything else works out. I have absolutely nothing but love for you, even though you annoy me like no tomorrow. Bro you get on my last nerve sometimes ngl. Still tho, I love you.\n\nTo Devarsh, I will you some peace of mind. It was really nice to meet you at the end of the year. I don’t know much about you and I wish I met you sooner. I’m still really sorry for everything that happened this year and I hope everything goes well for you in love. You seem like a genuinely good person and I hope I get to know more about you in the last couple months of the year.\n\nTo Jake, I will you a good volleyball season. Aye bro I have absolutely nothing but love for you and you know that. Biochem is genuinely one of the funniest classes I’ve ever had because of you. I’ve loved going to volleyball practices to take pictures for the yearbook. You’re lowkey kinda cracked. You got it fr. You’re an amazing person and I love you bro. Never forget that.\n\nTo Ethan, I will you some rationality. Bro you’re so weird lol. I have nothing but love for you but bro you’re weird and I love it. Your sense of humor is hilarious even though I would never usually admit that. The replies you have to my stories make me laugh but feel so disappointed. It’s like you’re three years behind and it’s amazing. Thank you for inviting me to the ICA meetings even though I could never go. Nothing but love bro.\n\nJJ Park\n\nTo Jeffrey Yao, I will you NAV BAR NAV BAR NAV BAR and acorns. Join me, Revanth, and Nihar in the central Illinois mud!\n\nTo Andrew Wong, I will you more acorns to share with Jeffrey. See you in Blono!\n\nTo Kannan Ilamparithi, I will you antibiotics. This way, maybe you won’t forget the antibiotics during the ANTIBIOTICS LAB. Take charge of your future – not gpt 4’s, and you will not believe how far you can reach (the limit is Springfield OSF!!). Also, I also will you acorns to give Jeffrey.\n\nTo Will Guo, Kennedy Su, and Kaylee Hwang, I will you Dr. Kotlarczyk. He’ll be lonely when nobody’s sitting shotgun with him. Now that I won’t be here to sub for you every time you “hAvE 7th mOd,” I recommend you guys to play every game possible – you’ll truly miss these times when the season’s over. Also, being golf captain is secretly the #1 hack for success (for 4 generations), so don’t worry about your college apps and play golf!\n\nTo Michael Granger, I will you consistency. Congrats! You’ve already made it. From our 2 years together, I can say with 100% confidence that you are on the right track. Now, you just need to stay consistent and maintain it. Just be yourself, and do the right thing with the same conviction that makes you immune to my viral MVC laziness. I hope you academically and socially have a great year, and maybe you can even say “hi” to Dr. Richmond for me!!!\n\nJoey Paras\n\nTo Tommy Blough, I will you many more volleyballs and Comfys. Oof, where to even start. I’ve made a sort of realization recently that when I really get to know somebody, I seem to forget anything about meeting them or the beginnings of our relationship. As weird as it sounds, Tommy, I remember absolutely nothing about when we first met. Literally nothing. As far as my memory serves me, you appeared one day, happened, and just kept happening, perpetually. I have to say, I’d have it no other way. Your presence in my life has become such a source of joy for me that it’s hard to believe that I’d be the same me if not for you. For that, I thank you. I hope I’ve been able to teach you as much as you’ve taught me. Keep in touch :)\n\nTo Kaella Moraga, I will you many more concert tickets to artists that I’m jealous of . Kaella. To say that you’re an inspiration to me would be a disservice to the word understatement. Besides the fact that you’re an absolute academic weapon (your adchem grind has single handedly kept me doing pchem work more than once), you are one of the most exceptional people I’ve been fortunate enough to not only meet, but be able to call one of my closest friends. The light you bring into every situation is infectious, and I’m so excited to watch you as you continue towards whatever you set your mind to. I’ve never been more sure than I am that, whatever you choose to do, you will absolutely devour. Thank you for the memories, and keep in touch :)\n\nTo Dani Pasillas, I will you many more pieces of Elvis memorabilia and nights of listening through TS’s discography. Oooh boy Dani. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone more able to match my energy. Sometimes I get a little concerned about how similar we are, I’ll be so real. I’m so glad I got to meet and get to know you, though we only had a year at IMSA together. Thank you, and keep in touch :)\n\nTo all the current and future underclassmen residents of 1503, I will you a new decrustification movement. 1503 has been the best home I could ask for since my sophomore year. Even from that very beginning, the community has become, as cheesy as it is, my family, and I’ve found some of the relationships that I cherish the most in 03’s walls. We’ve had highs (our drills DEVOURED) and our lows (cookies and conversations were… interesting) and it’s been a crazy ride, but I wouldn’t change a thing. Embrace the insanity and keep the hall spirit alive. After all, T-H-R-E-E, WE ARE 03!!!! Love y’all <3\n\nTo the hall-commons dwellers that have joined me in founding 1503’s flopnation, I will you several more too-late nights in the RC office. Whether it was listening to a new album (stream TS and Hozier), being a little too loud at 1 am, or earning laps and fees to the jar, y’all made 03 my home. Keep the culture alive <3 I’ll miss y’all.\n\nTo C-wing, I will you a brand new C-wing circuit. C-WING BEST WING FR. 03 C 4 LYFE.\n\nTo Molly Federici, Reagan Kelley, and Brooke Hobbs, I will you the power to go absolutely insane for the next two years. You are some of the absolute funniest and most iconic sophomore trinity I have ever had the fortune of meeting. I’m gonna miss your energy, and I can’t wait to see you guys in the future, no matter what your paths end up being. Good luck! :)\n\nTo the LEAD team, I will you a change in meeting time so we can all get a little more sleep. LEAD has taught me how to step out of my comfort zone, so embrace the lessons, trials, and tribulations that it may challenge you with, and then use them to grow. It’s been an honor to get to know all of you over the past two years, and I hope you continue the famiLEAD tradition in the coming years.\n\nTo the IMPACT team, I will you the sense of community that I had as part of the team. Bro – I love you all so much. I could not have asked for a better team to not only pilot a brand new curriculum with, but to grow, laugh, and bond with over the past year. From hiding in the backrooms of IN2 to (semi) proudly yelling cringe chants (SIMPACT and BOOM will live forever in the depths of my mind), IMPACT has been one of my favorite groups of people at IMSA. Thank you for making it so special <3\n\nTo Jongwoo Kim and Nikhil Kodali specifically, I will you the patience to deal with all the problems that LEAD and IMPACT might pose, as well as the ability to celebrate all the successes they result in as well. Rewriting IMPACT has been one of the most challenging and infuriating experiences I have ever gone through, but it has also been one of the most rewarding. I have no doubt that you two are more than capable of fitting IMPACT to your vision, and I am SO excited to hear about how IMPACT changes going forward. Keep your head up, no matter what certain people might say or do, and don’t be afraid to lean on your team.\n\nTo the underclassman ISP team, I will you many more editing grind sessions and smoothly run culture shows. Those of you who I’ve interacted with and those I have not been lucky enough to meet, I’m so glad that ISP is in such capable hands, as you are all truly the backbone of IMSA. Keep on going and don’t give up! Especially the photography people – keep being creative and lmk if you have any cool projects you’re working on :)\n\nTo Sydney Hunter and Tommy Blough, I will you the patience to deal with all that will inevitably come your way. You both are two of the absolutely most capable people I know, and I am 100% confident that you are going to eat this up. Good luck, and don’t be a stranger!\n\nTo THE Joaquin (Jake) Belonio, I will you a growth spurt (jk I, of all people, know that the Filipino genes are merciless). Whether in LEAD, dance, or volleyball, you devour in everything you do, and I know you won’t stop. Keep working hard and serving even harder! (ps I can’t wait to see your B-Friend at Lunar next year ;) )\n\nTo Ketzaly Nunez Luna and Yicole Ng, I will you an end to the reactions. I actually don’t know what I would’ve done without you two in Orgo . You are both two of the funniest and smartest people I’ve met, and I am so thankful we were at the same table. I can’t wait to see what you both do in the future, and keep in touch!!\n\nTo Shatakshi Chatterjee, I will you a working table organization instead of the mess we had in our classroom. Teaching you throughout both CORE and IMPACT in LEAD last year and then getting to be your co facilitator this year has been one of my favorite things at IMSA. I’ve loved seeing you grow, playing our Taylor x Weeknd playlists, and teaching together. You are absolutely amazing, and I have no doubt you are destined for things as impressive as you.\n\nTo Jongwoo Kim, I will you more bleach for your hair. JONGWOOOOO. Bro. I’m so glad we got to know each other. You are legit one of the coolest and most chill people I’ve ever met. Between LEAD and living in the same wing for two years, it’s been one of my greatest pleasures to be your upperclassmen. Keep in touch :)\n\nTo Nikhil (pronunciation tbd depending on how the announcements are feeling) Kodali, I will you the ability to become the Blue Lock anime man of your dreams. Kodali. Nikhil. Nikhole. Three names that will always live in infamy in my mind. You are one of the funniest people I’ve ever met, and you just do it so effortlessly. Nobody can make me laugh like you, and for that I am so thankful for you.\n\nTo Max Schwartz, I will you a working carbon fiber saxophone. Bro. You are literally so cool. Every time I talk to you, I feel like I figure out something new about you. From your interest in tea to your honestly incredibly impressive composition skills, you’ve constantly blown me away any time I’ve been lucky enough to interact with you. Keep going, and stay in touch :)\n\nTo Haoran Shi, I will you someone to rizz. The rizzler himself. Between B-Friend, the iconic red hat, and drone flying, you are an ICON. With your ability to make me laugh no matter what and talent for videography, you are one of the most exceptional people I’ve ever met. I cannot wait to see what you choose to do in the future, because I know you will eat. it. up.\n\nTo Josie Kim, I will you a new middle name. Never did I ever think that I would ever go by “Poseidon” for any amount of time from anyone but here we are, all thanks to you. Since meeting you in 03, you’ve remained one of the most hilarious, intelligent, and kind people that I’ve met. Anytime I saw you at school, my mood boosted immediately, whether we bonded over chem depression or GLU. Keep going and keep your head up. You are exceptional, and I can’t wait to see you be famous one day and say “I knew her when she was Josie Juxtaposition Kim.” :)\n\nTo Jordan Henry, I will you a functioning ClearTouch to replace the one we barely got by with during CORE. JORDANN!!!!! I could not have asked for a better CORE co. Ever since we did that little exercise together during SLD week, I knew we were gonna EAT IT UP together. And we did, no crumbs. CORE was so fun with you, and with how simply fantastic you are, I just know that you are going to go on to do even more amazing things. Never forget just how spectacular you truly are, and, of course, JJ forever :)\n\nTo Sydney Hunter, I will you plentiful photo shoots. When we first met through ISP and LEAD, I knew you were going to one of the most iconic people I’d have the pleasure of meeting. Getting to know you throughout the past two years through ISP/LEAD as well as things like Clash and living in 03, however, has proven that I was underestimating just how amazing you would be. Between the playlists, propics, and generally being a boss (OK ISP PRES AND CCE I SEE YOU), you are possibly the funniest person at IMSA, as well as one of the most talented people I’ve ever met. Please never forget who you are, because who you are is pretty incredible.\n\nTo THE Skumar, more commonly known as Sarah Kumar, I will you plenty more kpop stores to visit and kpop to love. My funny Filipina queen, you are so absolutely amazing. Getting to know you over the past year has been so fun, and I cannot wait to see you go on and continue devouring (ps can’t wait to see g-friend next year )\n\nTo Joshua Mu, I will you an unsolvable chem problem so you can experience the life of a non-genius. Josh, with full honesty, you are legit one of the most impressive yet humble people I’ve ever met. You are so smart and everytime I talk to you I’m honestly starstruck. You are destined for amazing things, I’m sure of it. Keep in touch :)\n\nTo Kaylee Hwang, I will you many more “free” drinks. Kaylee, I could not have asked for a better Panera partner. Our lunches quickly became highlights of my weeks, and not just because you used your free drinks for me. I loved getting to know you even more than I did before and talking to you about literally anything. You are so hilarious and I can’t wait to see what you do in the future.\n\nTo Rushina Patel, I will you a permanent bang curler because I swear I’ve never seen you without yours in. jkjkkkk but being so for real, DANGGGGGGGGG YOU ARE SO AMAZING. Rushina, I can not overstate just how much you inspire and impress me. Between your academic weapon-ess and your work in equity, I am just stunned by how amazing you are and have become over the past two years. Keep in touch :)\n\nTo Elaine Rao, I will you many more satisfying naps in English :). Getting to know you over the past two years has been so amazing, even though you left 03. You’re legitimately so cool – you and your dances devour – and please make sure you never forget that. You turned Graphic Novels from just another class to one of my favs this year, and I know you are going to accomplish so much (so don’t forget me when you’re famous).\n\nTo the 2024 F-Trad team, I will the same joy that I had while choreoing and working with all of you, despite the panic that we always seemed to go through :). Choreoing and dancing F-Trad this year was one of my all-time favorite things I did at IMSA, and I’m so glad that I got to do it with all of you. Thank you for letting me be your temporary kuya, and good luck next year!!\n\nTo Kaella (and Tommy, my fav Pinoy Boy, if you want), I will F-Trad – I couldn’t have done F-Trad without you both, and I know you’ll do amazing <3.\n\nJoshua Lee\n\nTo Shashi, I will you an unlimited Bing Ling pass, the best oppa, and a moment where you can relax. As much as I love to goof around with you, I don’t think I can overestimate how much every moment we spent together impacted me. Whether it be Diff Eq grind sessions or rants about IMSA admins, there’s nothing I would trade to lose every moment I had with you. You’re definitely one of the most talented juniors and people in general I’ve ever met. But I think it’s important to just take a moment in your life to appreciate what you have and appreciate what you’ve become. There’s still a lot of life ahead of you, so don’t get caught up on what the future holds for you and enjoy what the present has to offer. Life naturally comes with ups and downs, what matters is how you deal with the downs. Keep on pressing through, and I know the future can only hold good things for you. Also, keep being friends with Sadi. I think it’s a valuable relationship that’ll help out both of you. Speaking of relationships…\n\nTo Andrew, I will you the position of spiritual CAB director. Good try man. Next time, don’t jump too hard so your pee doesn’t leak through the floor and into our room through our room light.\n\nTo Aadi Shah, I will you a chill pill. Stop worrying so much about where you’ll end up and just focus on enjoying the moment. Easy to say and hard to do, but I’m sure you’ll find that the most rewarding moments of your life aren’t the grand experiences you spend years planning but the seemingly insignificant moments that come naturally.\n\nTo Deen Ka, I will you to GET OUT OF MY SIGHT. In all seriousness, I loved seeing how much you got into CLASH towards the end. Put more energy into your dance moves though.\n\nTo 1505, I will a Vigilante to Hei5t another clash victory. Diego, I know you’ll do great as next year’s riddle head. Hopefully we can go for the first place sweep this time. Asad, dancing in clash was a lot of fun, even if I skipped half the practices (mb). I really hope you continue to be a drill head next year. Ibrahim, get steadier hands :/. In reality, it was a lot of fun being in Chicago with you. Run it back next year and let’s place first in movie this time.\n\nTo Josefh, I will you another clash victory. I also will you page 49 of the 2023-2024 IMSA student Handbook.\n\nTo B Wing, I will you a better RC and more pizza nights. Ethan and Nathan (or Nathan and Ethan?), I loved hanging out with you guys after 10 check. Thanks for the noodles and sausages, and try getting off the phone and socializing with others around you, you’ll be surprised. Raj, I thought you were pretty headstrong all things considered. Keep trying and you might end up getting that StudCo position. Laksh, I regret not being able to talk to you more, you seem like a genuinely great person to be around. We’ll run spikeball again one day. Kavin, I loved popping into the wing commons and also seeing a new movie on. Get more people in on it, I think it’ll be pretty fun. Will, you’re my senior at large goat.\n\nTo Shrikar, I will you an unlimited supply of Fogel notes. Being my 3-math-classes-in-a-semseter buddy, without you my number theory grade would be in shambles. I’m sure good things are in store for you, keep working hard and you’ll get there eventually.\n\nTo Grace and Helen, I will you a peaceful sleep on the downstate bus. Sorry I could never talk to you guys, but I’m sure you’ll continue the Champaign IMSA legacy. Don’t be afraid to talk to the incoming Champaign sophs and say hi to my brother while you’re at it.\n\nVincent You, I will you the ability to spend less time rummaging through number theory notes. Oh boy, where do I even start… my favorite class this semester was number theory, no less thanks to you. I’ll still remember the nights before number theory homework is due, with you huddled over on Ashwin’s bed crying about how you should’ve started earlier. Late nights spent singing Bruno Mars, debating with Rithik, or just general tomfoolery to avoid doing homework won’t be forgotten.I also will you a one time redeemable coupon to avoid expulsion from StudCo. Congrats, you made it onto StudCo! The hard part is now. You’ll need to learn the ropes while juggling robotics and college apps at the same time. If anyone can do it, it’s you. A valuable opportunity to make a lasting change has fallen upon you. Don’t be afraid to make friends with your new board members, and make sure you set all the clubs right.I also (x2) will you a mildly functioning FRC robot. I’ve seen all the hard work that you put into robotics. I still remember leaving my dorm in the morning just to see you in the wing commons, pulling an all nighter because you thought it was worth it. Regardless of whether you become captain or not, there’s a sort of passion that most people lack that I see in you. Very few people are as dedicated, hardworking, and headstrong for a passion they truly find enjoyment as you. I hope you continue to explore robotics even after high school, I think there’s a spark that doesn’t deserve to fizzle out.I also (x3) will you to be 1505’s 09 representative. My second favorite CLASH moment may have to be our last minute improvisation of us falling from your glorious sax solo during a talent show (My favorite being winning clash obviously. I still remember hugging you after we won). I know you’re going to 04 next year, but I know you’ll bring the spirit of clash with you. Winning might be fun, but I also encourage you to collaborate with others, not only in your hall but the entirety of campus. I too once remember wanting to win clash as a hyper aggressive junior like you, but now I relish in moments where I found myself with other halls, working together to achieve a sense of victory even greater than what a normal win could ever offer. I also (x4) will you increased saxophone prowess. I know it’s like your biggest personality trait, and now that the incompetent senior who’s taking all ur opportunities (Zuyu) is leaving, you will finally become the sole leader of IMSA’s saxophone section. Now with all that sax skills you should actually rizz instead of just playing careless whispers all day. I also (last one I swear) will you a new leaf. Even with a reputation that precedes you, I think you’ll be surprised to find that people will tend to like you if you simply just started being who you are. Deep down, I know you’re capable of being a great person, you just need to find it for yourself. Keep trying, even when it seems hard. It’s easy to relish in the status quo, but there’s nothing more rewarding than being able to look back at your past fondly, knowing how much you’ve grown.\n\nKate DeGreve\n\nTo Shatakshi Chatterjee, I will you a senior year where YOU are getting noise complaints in 1502 D-wing. In all seriousness, I hope that your senior year is balanced with your crazy commitments, college apps that I’m sure will get you to your dream, and lots of post-ten-check fun (and studying). You deserve so much and you honestly impress me every day. Make sure to take care of yourself, give yourself breaks, and reach out to me and your big sib with whatever you need. Thank you for being the sweetest underclassman, RSL, a great wingmate last year, and now the person who always lets me in after check. I am so glad I met you and PLEASE remember how amazing you are!!!\n\nKohl Vonder Haar\n\nTo Haoran “Jack” Shi, I will you an infinite supply of Baja and some “well-deserved” new Hopkins merch. Jack, I understood how caring and hardworking you truly are from the moment I first began to get to know you better this year. A particular instance (involving a cardboard cutout) solidified just how good of friends I knew we were bound to become. Your witty wordplay and admittedly similarly deranged sense of humor never fails to make me laugh, and your late-night visits to my pseudo-quad, whether to “lock in” or simply to get up to some shenanigans, have never failed to brighten my day (even if it means that you end up stealing some of my Baja Blasts). Stay true to yourself, my JOAT. I had better see you with me in Baltimore next year, or I’ll be stealing that hat.\n\nTo Mr. Nikhil Kodali, I will you a half-full bottle of baby oil. Nikhil, despite the many times I have caught you “grinding” in Chad’s, David’s, or even your room, you are one of the hardest-working people I know (BEYOND Fortnite, to be clear). I always find you entangled in the same shenanigans I’m involved in, but you always approach them with wit and a sense of rationality (one our friends typically lack). If there’s anyone I know who can maintain peace and control over his emotionally unstable quad (I mean, look at what happens to Jack whenever he drinks a Baja), it’s you. Always remain the bedrock of your friend group, Nikhil, and I know you’re bound to do amazing things in the future. Stay in touch.\n\nTo Chad Park, I will you a supply of ramen as abundant as your ability to procrastinate. Chad, your personability, even in the most dire of situations, always amazes me. Whether discussing Steph Curry’s game-winning three-point shots or bearing witness to many nights of Super Mega Baseball and Fortnite, you never fail to make me smile. Despite all that you go through, you always manage to keep your head high, and I admire that about you, alongside your ability to always remain calm, no matter the circumstances. I better see you writing for Hadron as of next year, and if you keep your nose to the grindstone, I know you will end up in outstanding places. Make sure to reach out, Chad.\n\nTo Aditya Kumar, I will you the ability to make your own cosmetic choices, despite your parents’ contradictory wishes. Adi, although I had no idea (or interest) in who you were whenever I was assigned to live in 07B, getting to know you has been one of the most enriching experiences I’ve had while living here. Your consistently positive demeanor and happy resolve inspire everyone around you, and your laughter is contagious. Despite all of the times that I’ve mocked you in the presence of sophomores, you never seem to allow me to get to your head, and I find that truly admirable. Adi, you are one of the most genuine and down-to-earth people I know on this campus; don’t allow anyone to tell you otherwise. Make sure to keep in touch!\n\nTo David Weng, I will you the mental fortitude needed to wean off of your Fortnite addiction (and to go all of the way). David, despite the jokes I’ve made at your expense, you are genuinely one of the funniest people I know, with a sense of humility I can only aspire to. Whether ranging from MVC to French to waking you up to come to play ultimate frisbee with me, you always seem to know exactly how to adapt to the situation at hand with humor while still having fun along the way. I can’t wait to run some Spikeball with you in these coming weeks but keep in touch with me in these coming years.\n\nTo Andrew Katson, I will you the ability to stay vigilant in the gym during the college application season and the time management skills to keep Hadron afloat. Andrew, your willingness to learn and adapt to the sometimes volatile conditions that Hadron found itself in this previous year was admirable. Though I could have aided you by being a more insightful (and involved) Senior Editor-in-Chief, I know you will improve Hadron even more this upcoming year. I will truly miss your constant jokes about the frivolities of chemistry and witnessing your progress in the gym, but I can’t wait to see where you take Hadron. Best of luck, Andrew.\n\nTo all of my 01D Wing sophomores from last year, thank you for always keeping things light-hearted during some of the most difficult times of my IMSA career. Even though I persistently found myself doing work into the late hours of the night during my Junior year, you all managed to find a way to insert some humor into even my darkest moments, and for that, I couldn’t be more appreciative. I wish you all the best in your senior year, and I know you all are bound for greatness if you just follow in my steps, obviously.\n\nTo Joshua Mu, I will you an endless supply of Professor Jianping Huang’s USNCO practice problems. Juice, from the first time I met you during study sessions for the National Chemistry Olympiad, I knew you were destined for greatness. Your boundless chemical knowledge always amazes me, and your persistent dedication to expanding your knowledge is truly admirable. The fact that you can do this while still balancing a social (I’ll never forget the endless hours of Stumble Guys and outrageous jokes) and family life (his family is lovely, for the record) is admirable. Maintain your work ethic through application season and onward, Juice, and I know you’ll do great things. Stay in touch!\n\nTo anyone else I might have forgotten, my sincerest apologies (this is what I get for filling these out at the very last moment), but I’m certain that you all will do amazing things, and never hesitate to reach out!\n\nKomal Chivukula\n\nTo Aahana Das, I will you a slayful senior year! Aahana, you are such a good friend of mine, and I truly think that my experience at IMSA would have been so different if I never became friends with you. From our late night study sessions to our meaningful conversations, our friendship grew throughout these past years. You are so smart and resilient (I remember the OOP and French 3 grinds) and I know you will get through any challenge that you’ll get! And don’t stress, I know you’re gonna be great next year! You’re genuinely going to eat it up next year, and I can’t wait to see and hear about you slaying your senior year! I’ll always be cheering you on, bestie!\n\nTo Aarushi Das, I will you all the CS knowledge in the world! Aarushi, you were one of the first underclassmen I met here, and you are truly one of my closest friends now. You always cheered me up when I was in a flop-full mood, and I truly appreciate your support and friendship here. You are also so, so cool! I know we joke around a lot, but you’re genuinely such a smart person, and I am in literal awe at the stuff you do! Don’t worry trust, the trauma of French 3 is going to pass, and you’re going to eat up all of your classes next year! I know you’re gonna do so amazing next year and in the years to come! You got this bestie, and you’re gonna slay so much!\n\nTo Maya Kannan, I will you some additional brain cells to get through another lovely year of French 4. Maya, you’re genuinely one of the most interesting and goofiest people I know and I’m so so glad I took the time to get to know you. Not only are you goofy, but you’re smart, awesome, and an amazing friend. Even though you act and seem to be in a crisis, you’re always so resilient and always get through all the obstacles and flops that come your way! You’re almost at the finish line, and trust I know you’ll carry Dr. Dong’s SIR next year (my awesome particle physics bestie!!!)!\n\nTo Shriya Koduri, I will you a whole amazing arsenal of memes. Unfortunately I’m kind of broke and I can’t give you all my money, but I will give you access to a priceless collection of memes (mainly to annoy Maya next year)! But being for real, Shriya, you’re genuinely so talented! You’re an actual French legend, and I don’t think that I would be getting through that class without you at my table this semester! Also, you still have so much time to do great things here, and I can’t wait to hear about all the cool things you will do at IMSA! Don’t let the pressures or stress of IMSA get to you, and I know you’ll do great here!\n\nTo Samira Koduri, I will you all A’s in all the remaining French classes you take. Samira, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for helping me with French 3 first semester. I would not have survived that class without your knowledge. You are also so nice, and I really hope that French and IMSA treats you well moving forward!\n\nTo Shatakshi Chatterjee, I will you all A’s in all the hardest classes at IMSA. Shatakshi, you’re genuinely so cool, sweet, and smart, and our interactions always brighten my day. I know you’ll do awesome next year, so don’t stress about it!\n\nTo Rachel Qi and Katherine Ge, I will you the coolest room or quad ever! Rachel, you’re so silly, goofy and fun to be around! It was so much fun getting to know you this year! I hope you continue to have fun at IMSA (as well as finish the Skibidi Toilet Saga)! Katherine, you always brighten my mood with our interactions and you’re so silly! In the end, you two were the best unexpected quadmates that I could have ever asked for, and I hope that your room or quad next year is amazing!\n\nTo Aashini Sanapala, I will you another amazing cohort of GIS mentees. Aashini, you were such a goated and fun mentor, and I know that my GIS experiences would not be as awesome as it was. We were able to get our mentees to create such amazing projects, and I truly hope you get to have amazing and cool mentees next year if you choose to do GIS again. Nevertheless, you are such a fun and sweet person, and I am so glad I got to know you this year!\n\nTo the 02 B-Wing underclassmen, I will you another year of being a part of an amazing wing. My time in B wing was so amazing, and it was entirely because of you guys. I truly hope that your IMSA experience stays as positive as it can get, but I know that you guys can get through any obstacle that comes your way. If you guys continue to stay in B wing next year, I hope it’s still as silly and funny as it was this year!\n\nLaasya Nagumalli\n\nTo Psych Club, I will you all a What Would You Do episode of your own. I hope for John Quiñones himself to bless the production that Psych Club would create, and I have no doubt your drive and passion for psychology will foster an amazing year of events on campus.\n\nTo Poets’ Society, I will you a complete collection of all the works of Rupi Kaur. Take that as you will!\n\nTo GEA, I will you red fruit punch and red velvet cupcakes and red skittles and cherries and tomatoes and red bell peppers and blood oranges and apples and flaming hot cheetos and kool aid and ketchup and\n\nTo Spectrum, I will you many more pride moths! You guys should put pride moths in Pride Rock. <3\n\nTo Jasper, I will you more green stuffed bunnies! And probably a new spinal cord. I don’t know why, you just give the vibes of someone looking for a new spinal cord. Not like someone else’s spinal cord, but maybe an artificial one? It’d be fun.\n\nTo Hamsika, I will you pi. Because, contrary to your initial impression, I know what pi is! In any case, it was a gnarly time working with you on our many mutual club boards, and I feel confident that I’m leaving them in amazing hands. I’m gonna miss you constantly misnaming Nickel as “Nickels.”\n\nTo Indy, I will you the ability to merge into a collective consciousness with all your friends! While we never got a chance to spend a lot of time together this year, I enjoyed our sporadic encounters– bullying Gar together, you getting me Oberweis, me accidentally giving you twenty dollars in said Oberweis encounter because I don’t know how to do math. It was always a highlight of my day to see you on the other end of Axis (Access? lol) Road on a late-night walk and wave excitedly to you. But I don’t miss the memory of the time you scared the daylights out of me from the flower beds. I swear, it felt like my esophagus was climbing halfway up my throat. In any case, I’m gonna miss you next year! While we’re never going to merge into a collective consciousness, I want to stay in touch with you in all the years to come :)\n\nTo Josie, I will you more sleep on nights before math tests. Girl, when I tell you I would’ve failed MVC if not for you, I am being so serious. At the very least, you saved me from severe suffering. From our late nights in A-wing to the lovely 8am battles we would fight together, I’m grateful for having had the challenge of MVC and for the shared struggle having brought us closer together.\n\nTo Shrikar, I will you the money to buy a house. More specifically, the money to buy *me* a house. …Kidding! I am still waiting on answers on those Would You Rather questions, though. From the moment I first, as you put so eloquently to Ellen, “interrogated” you, I’ve enjoyed the way that your mind works! Despite the questionable stances you hold on alternative universal animal ethics, I hope to keep picking your mind after I graduate through the occasional messenger rabbit hole of math talk and sporadic life updates. Stay gnarly~~\n\nTo Karthik, I will you better taunts to use on shmen. While the “so pwecious” and “so adowable” have their token Karthik touch, I must insist that you develop new insults. Though I relish how severely I torment you when you threaten to cook bunnies during Number Theory (I’ll always be proud of how you fail to stop me from stealing your glasses while cackling maniacally time and time again), I cherish how our friendship began. You were sitting in old caf and I was struggling with my Number Theory proofs, and you sat with me for like an hour and a half to walk me through how proof by induction works. Though I’ll never stop calling you “so pwecious” and “so adowable” to taunt you the way you taunt schmen, it was sweet of you to help me with all things math and insist so thoroughly that I know what I’m doing, I just need to be more confident in myself. Don’t be a stranger next year, Karthik! Tell me all about how DeRham (DeRabbit) Theory and your QFT research with Dr. Trimm goes. I’ll enjoy listening to everything you say go way over my head.\n\nTo Alvena, I will you a decoy Laasya for your next math class. Ah, MI4! There’s no way that it wasn’t like, three centuries ago! I think it’s adorable, the way that our friendship had grown and blossomed into a pure and sweet constant. Since you came to IMSA, you’ve never had a math class where we didn’t sit at the same table. You’re a saint for tolerating my many, many, many (many many), many rants about how adorable bunnies are while in class. I’m still sorry for making you prove the Error Bound for Simpson’s Rule with me. That was my bad. But in my defense, it was still fun! Is a math class really worth it if it doesn’t introduce such rigor that it makes you cry? …Perhaps. But regardless, I’m gonna miss the first math class I take in college that doesn’t have you passed out cold next to me (but still resulting in you outperforming me in tests all the time cause you’re just that smart). I’m grateful for the conversations we’ve had and the memories we’ve shared. From nights pouring over our AEPs to our first Number Theory test that we blew out of the water to the infamous comment that I made in BC fast that only you, me, Wyatt, and Neev will ever get to know, I’m astounded for how we grew and changed alongside each other over the past two years. While I won’t be sitting at the same math table as you next year, I’ll be looking forward to constant life updates from you :)\n\nTo Neev, I will for you to go a year without your glasses being stolen from you. I think my graduation, and therefore, alleviation from your agony, will be gift enough for you (/j). In all seriousness, though, I’m glad we got to know each other over the past two years. Sad as it is, I think my infamous BC Fast quote I made was the initial step in our friendship, but I’m happy to look back upon how it has flourished. You’re a fun person to be around, and despite your constant insistence on pretending you’re tormented by me, I know you perceive me similarly. I know you have great things ahead of you, and I hope you see that too. Let’s stay BFFs forever! I know how much you love that phrase <3\n\nTo Charlotte, I will you an endless supply of microwave popcorn. Pimantles and bunnies and popcorn and Apples to Apples and late night friendly gossip sessions– who could ask for anything more? I’m glad to have met you, Charlotte. When I began junior year, I wasn’t able to move in until months after school had started, and it made it so hard for me to connect with underclassmen. When I moved in senior year, I was determined to make up for it. I tried my absolute best to connect with as many underclassmen as possible, compensating for my lack of doing so in the previous year, and seeking to be the upperclassman that I had wished I had had when I had been a sophomore. I still recall, clear as day, the night you told me and Jojo that our efforts weren’t going unnoticed and that you had felt so supported by us, and that we were doing a good job of reaching out to the A-wing sophomores. While I don’t think I let on the sheer magnitude of the importance to me in the moment, that comment meant more to me than you know. You’re so bright and kind, your intelligence catalyzing your immaculate imagination and interpersonal skills. I admire the tenacity with which you approach your goals, and I’m so excited to see where it takes you. Thank you for a year of an amazing friendship, and I’m looking forward to many more to come :)\n\nTo Ellen, I will you The Morning Club. I can never stop thinking about the butterfly effect when I think about you. It’s so baffling to me– a chance encounter on a stairwell in the middle of the school week led to one of the closest friendships I’ve ever had in my life. I’m not one to believe in fate, but it does seem to have worked out perfectly: the random housing placement, the passing on the stairs, the Ellen^3 fiasco, the chance of sitting next to each other that day during S&E, Mr. Brummet mishearing your words, all to fall perfectly in place to give way for the foundations of our friendship. You have a way of making people feel secure in who they are. The way you latched onto my personality in its purest and most natural form, appreciating me for the core of my personhood, touched me in a way that’s difficult to describe. It’s easy to brush past the constant joys in life– sunlight and cold water and ad-skip tickets in Cats and Soup. But being friends with you was like the ethereal feeling of being overly aware of how amazing they all feel to have. You, in all your Ellen-ness, your bad humor and your corny laugh and your linear algebra puns and your insanely amazing art skills and your kind-hearted nature, are impossible to distinguish from the feeling of sunlight on your back as warmth first breaks through the months of a Chicago winter, or cold water after a field day from a fifth grade graduation party, or knowing you can get more than five free fishing bait in Cats and Soup because you have more ad-skip tickets (I’m so addicted to Cats and Soup, please send help). All this is to say that I’m a better person for having known you. You’re an easy person to admire, with your lovable nature and overwhelming curiosity about the world. It’s adorable how you joined The Morning Club in part because you liked absorbing the LinAlg even though you weren’t in the class. You inspired an amount of growth in my mindset and outlook on the world that’s difficult for me to quantify, but I’m so happy that Ava and I get to leave The Morning Club to you. Hey, maybe you’ll finally have time to ask more than 1.258623 questions! Remember me next time there’s no competition for you to take the good seat in Mr. Brummet’s office in the morning, will you? And thank you, Ellen, for encouraging me to always admire the little things– like the carpeted landings of the 02 A-wing stairwells.\n\nLaura Cervantes\n\nTo the robotics juniors, Keegan, Georgi, Neel, Indy, Vincent, Kyler, Michael, and Jaxon, I will you a season that runs smoothly and brings you NO stress. You all are such valuable members of the team and I know you’ll want to jump right into the season after the game reveal but PLEASE take it easy. I’ve seen you all give up your time and devote yourselves to robotics, and apparently, being called a nerd for it is not enough to stop you. Whenever you feel stressed, take a step back and calm down. A lot of team members have explosive personalities (including some of you) and you will have to step up and be the bigger person. Mentor the sophs with all you’ve learned, encourage the juniors to work hard, and be nice to each other!! I know you will be an amazing team together so LOCK IN and go to worlds!!!\n\nTo the girls in robotics and those who have sadly left the team (pls come back), as Jai, a senior from last year willed me, I will you the courage to speak up and advocate for yourself and others as well. Trying to give it your all and more to the team is a challenge in itself. I want you to never be discouraged from asking questions and speaking your mind. The lab can be a harsh place sometimes and it is easy to feel discouraged but I hope you don’t end your journey in robotics so soon. Stay and push yourselves, it sucks that we have to prepare ourselves to one day encounter worse people later in our careers but it’s the truth. However, you can make a change, I know you can, I observed you while working in the lab (not in a creepy way I swear) and every single one of you is capable of making a change in the team and your peers. If there’s one thing I wish I did is to not get used to it but rather teach others to change. Be the leaders I know you can be. Have the best time, and recruit more girls!! MUAH you guys got this!!! P.S. PLS buy some sparkly tape for your safety glasses, everyone is gonna be so jealousSSSSSSS.\n\nTo Vincent, I will you enough time and muscles to finish your hundreds of pushups, more sleep, an easy auto game, a future relations head happy to take your picture (:))), and a big house to fill with kids. Vincent, I mean it when I say I am so proud of the growth you’ve made in the last two years and I cannot wait to see all that you accomplish your senior year. I’ve seen you dedicate an incredible amount of time to the team and that robot both in the lab and outside. Thank you for being a friend and posing for the camera! Please have some fun! Let yourself go out of your comfort zone to try new things, it’s okay to mess up but do not beat yourself up. I hope you spend more time doing things that aren’t robotics like maybe sleeping, trying a cool push-up trick, making a jazz album (send that over If you do), finding a new pose for Instagram, or becoming a movie enthusiast like your favorite upperclassmen (me!). Okay, have fun!!! Let your hair grow out.\n\nTo Kyler Ponx, I will you a fun time outside of robotics. Have some fun and spend time away from robotics exploring some hobbies that will help you grow as a person. I think you’d really enjoy soccer and 21 savage! I’ve enjoyed making you laugh (you’re welcome!!) and having you as someone I can bother in the lab :) Enjoy your senior year, have some fun, expand your hobbies, time outside, and average sleeping hours! Pose for the camera next year!\n\nLuke Mauk\n\nTo Brooke Hobbs, I will you the energy to keep this place going. I know that this place has its rough spots but I’m trusting you to make sure this place survives. You are the most outgoing, passionate, bubbly, and crazy person (but like in a good way) I have ever met. Don’t do anything stupid and ayo make the most of your time here because it goes fast. Good luck! You’re going to do great things! RAWRRRRRR\n\nTo Sydney Hunter, I will you the ACLU club. I know things didn’t exactly go as planned this year. Next year is going to be so great with you as president and hopefully a little smoother. Good luck next year and keep me updated!\n\nTo Blake Hennings and Lucy Philip, I will you guys the best couple and the longest lasting couple. Blake bro you’re so chill like I wish I could have gotten to know you better this year :( Lucy idk u frl but if you’re with Blake then you must be pretty cool. You guys are so cute together! Out of all the couples on campus you guys are my fav. You guys better keep the legacy going I am counting on you!\n\nMaryam Zaidi, I will you the power to keep your passion for becoming a doctor. I also will you all my advice and if you need anything hit me up! I have never met anyone who is as passionate as you about becoming a doctor. Good luck! I hope to see you in a couple of years at WASHU :)\n\nNoel Skariah, I will you the ramen that I took from you that one time. Frl Noel you are super cool like one of the most down to earth people I know. I enjoy gossiping with you :) and the late night shenanigans hehe. You’re the best Bwing liaison I could’ve asked for. Good luck next year and remember to have fun. Seriously have a little fun, or else….\n\nKetzaly Nuñez Luna I will you all my silly goofy energy. Welp now you gotta be the crazy one. It’s all up to you. I always enjoy hanging out with you because you make me laugh. I will never forget the Mexico trip and the 01 hall commons shenanigans hehe. Don’t forget to enjoy yourself for senior year. Live it uppppp cause it goes fast. RAWRRRRRR hehe :)\n\nMaitreyi Pandey\n\nTo Aarushi Das, I will you a senior year full of positivity and happiness. You are the very definition of an ebullient person and all of our interactions give me so much joy. I’m grateful for the sibling algorithm for pairing us, and if you ever need anything, I will be there to help you. I hope you have a splendid, stress-free, fun-filled, well-rested time next year!\n\nTo Lennon Kimbrel, I will you a junior CORE co-facilitator as cool and smart as you. I thoroughly enjoyed teaching our class with you on Wednesday nights! Your aesthetic presentations, fun kahoots, and adorable drawings on the whiteboard made me excited to teach every class. You’re an excellent leader and I’m sure you’ll enact positive change on your CORE class next year!\n\nTo EmmaLi Isham, I will you a productive year surrounded by competent people. I’m sure next year is going to be a little different than what you expected, but I know you’ll be a wonderful president! You are such a hard-working, passionate, organized, and cheerful person and I have no doubts that you will overcome all of the obstacles in your way and accomplish your goals. Don’t be afraid to argue, make demands, and stand up against the detrimental changes that IMSA tries to make. Also, remember that you do not need to say yes to everything. Other people are more than capable of taking on responsibility and delegating tasks to underclassmen is your prerogative as a senior (to an extent)! Anyway, I hope you enjoy senior year and I cannot wait to see the great things you achieve.\n\nTo José Lazcano, I will you an endless amount of patience, ambition, passion, and energy. Or I would will that to you if you didn’t already have it. At a school filled to the brim with impressive people, you are the most impressive and it’s not even a close competition. From literally the very beginning of your sophomore year, you have been trying to make our campus more inclusive and equitable. I cannot tell you enough how much I admire and appreciate you and your work. Pride Rock, the Hub, equity programming events, the read-ins, Casa, Spectrum events, the list of things you have done in your short time here feels endless. You never shy away from difficult tasks and you are exactly what this school needs. I am so, so, so proud of you and I am honored to be your friend. You have made an indelible impact on my life and my outlook of the world. Because of all of the extraordinary extracurricular activities you do, I want to will you a break. An actual one, where you can let other people take charge of things for a while and you can relax and bask in the knowledge that you have improved the lives of current and future IMSA students. I already know that you are going to go ridiculously far in life, so I hope you know that I will always be here and I will always be rooting for you!\n\nTo Olivia Aguilar, I will you a tight-knit 07 community. As elusive of an idea as this may sound, I believe in you and your HCL abilities and I’m sure you’ll find a way to turn this figment of my imagination into reality. Ever since meeting you during sophomore move-in, I have appreciated your perpetual kindness and sticker donations (our fridge is covered in them thanks to your contributions). You have come so far since sophomore year and watching you grow into a confident and capable leader has been a rewarding experience. I enjoyed teaching our specialization class together this semester and I hope you continue to lead and create positive change around campus (specifically in 07 (please make it better)). Prioritize your sleep schedule and do not stress too much next year! Also please reach out whenever you feel like it because I will happily answer any questions you have about anything and everything <3\n\nTo Lucy Philip, I will you a sophomore that makes delicious grilled cheeses. Working with you on CCE and having you in the wing has been an unexpectedly unforgettable experience. You are by far my favorite sophomore and you are so bubbly, funny, and dedicated to the work that you do and it is refreshing to meet someone who does what they are truly passionate about instead of what they think other people expect of them. I am so proud of you and everything you have accomplished this year! From you being a fabulous SOCC president to a delightful addition to 07 A-wing, I have loved getting to know you this year. IMSA may not be what you expected based on your brother’s experiences, but I’m sure you can restore it to its former glory (at least partially)! Also I am holding you to your promise of showing me cool places in Chicago on your SIR days.\n\nTo Alvena Bhutiani, I will you ample amounts of sleep. You are a pleasure to be around and teaching some of our IMPACT classes and having you on CCE has been amazingly cool. You have genius ideas (befitting for the genius that you are), and I hope you continue to work hard on CCE events and projects. Please learn how to make better decisions and stop procrastinating because it is so inconvenient to be sleep deprived, especially during college app season. I am wishing you success and happy decision days because you have definitely earned it! I would ask you to stay in touch, but I learned this year that our moms are acquaintances/friends(?) so I’m sure they will do that for us, as Indian moms tend to do. Also, if you stay in 07, participate in CLASH! No excuses!!\n\nTo Andrew Wong, I will you better posture. Watching you bend your spine at an unnatural angle while sitting on the floor during our CCE meetings genuinely made my neck hurt. Please sit up straight. Bad posture aside, you are cool and I appreciate the work that you do on CCE. I hope you are a positive role model for your underclassmen and have a successful and activity-filled senior year!\n\nTo Sydney Hunter and Shanya Yang, I will you a year of CCE that lives up to everything you can possibly imagine for it. I have full faith that you two will be able to navigate all of the ups and downs that come with running a club like CCE at a school like IMSA. Sydney, you are a ridiculously busy person but also unbelievably efficient. It is actually mind-blowing how much you get done. Stay organized and keep being the nerdy and passionate leader that you are. Shanya, your honesty is going to be so useful to you. Sometimes people just need to hear things that they don’t want to and I know you’ll be adept at handling those difficult situations. We chose you two because we knew you would work well together and help the IMSA community, and I hope you’re able to achieve every goal you set for yourself next year! I am always here to help if you need it, and I am excited to hear about where you lead CCE, so keep me updated!\n\nTo CCE Board, I will you a year of impactful change-making. IMSA has a long way to go before it truly lives up to its DEI goals, and my hope for you all is that you continue to advocate for people and educate our community so everyone can feel safe here. Don’t get too discouraged when things don’t go our way and don’t give up!! This year was an eventful one and I know it must have been confusing, especially for our sophomores. You have all grown into amazing leaders and I am honored to have sat in Golabia every Tuesday with all of you! I hope you all get to work on all the projects, initiatives, and ideas that you can envision, and I know you’ll do lovely things next year!\n\nTo IYNA Board, I will you a year full of brainy opportunities! You are all so smart and ridiculously experienced and passionate about neuroscience. You have worked so hard this year and managed to organize multiple events in very short amounts of time, which is beyond impressive. EmmaLi and Ayesha, I trust that you will keep this club running and fuel the IMSA community’s passion for neuroscience. Yoona, I’ve appreciated your ability to get things done at a rapid pace! I know senior year is busy but I hope you find time to build and support IYNA’s general membership system. Manu and Blake, you are both so talented and full of ideas, and I hope you get to bring them to life next year. As you move forward into the third year of IYNA’s existence at IMSA (hopefully), I hope you keep in mind the concept of neuroplasticity. You are doubtlessly going to face challenges next year, but club culture is changing and we must change with it! Be like neurons! Modify your responses and make new connections based on these new inputs and stimuli!\n\nManasa Balasubramanian\n\nTo girly pop Aahana Das, I will you the best WIDI partner in existence (besides me of course). I remember meeting you for the first time in French 2 with Madame and being in shock of your compétences en français. I would spend much time attempting to differentiate between you and Aarushi, but in the end, I realized I don’t really need to think about that, as your incredible personality makes you, well, you! Between all the time spent in SciOly studying and having in-depth conversations about k-dramas, I really wish I had more time to get to know you better. You’ll be amazing as next year’s SciOly Captain. As you traverse the final year of high school at IMSA, please remember that if you need anything, anything at all, I’m only a phone call away.\n\nTo the amazing Aarushi Das, I will you the best biology textbook in existence, full of every answer you ever need. Our first interaction was meeting you through your sister, and then furthermore through crashing SciOly study sessions, and then girls dance for Diwali x Harambee last year. Every interaction I’ve had with you has been really meaningful and shows how much fun you are to talk to. I wish you all the best for SciOly and HOSA next year, you will definitely make it to state! I sincerely apologize for only participating in Ao Naa during the Diwali Group Dance this year, but you and Aahana were some of the best and most understanding choreos I have ever worked with! All in all, I wish you the best of luck for your senior year next year, and I will always be here for you in case you need anything.\n\nTo Maya Kannan, the best Tamil kid in the class of 2025, I will you many more sophomores for you to speak Tamil with. Ever since I first met you in French 2, I’ve been blown away by your amazing personality. Thank you for keeping me on my toes about speaking the Tamil language. You’ve been such an amazing friend, and I additionally will you the best math textbook to answer all your questions. I still have the Dhanush “Po Po Po” Meme saved on my phone as a memory of you. I really wish we could have spent more time together this year. I wish you all the best during your senior year at IMSA, and please stay in contact with me.\n\nP.S. Please tell me I’m much better at speaking Tamil than Vignesh.\n\nTo Jasper Hlavac, one of my favorite sophomores, I will you every soft plushie in existence. I first met you while I was at Summer@IMSA, and you at EXCEL. Through our funny conversations and many hugs to both you and your plushies, I was able to get to know you better not just as a sophomore, but as a true friend. Every interaction I’ve had with you has been incredibly meaningful, and I wish I had more time to spend with you. Please stay in contact, but most of all, please take Blahaj Jr. to SciOly competitions next year, keeping the tradition alive.\n\nTo Megan Onorato, one of my other favorite sophomores, I will you the car of your dreams (within budget of course). I might not remember where we first met, but your charm and personality have made my day multiple times. Your dance skills leave me in awe, and I will you the best audience to see you shine. It makes me sad that I only had one year with you, I wish I could have had more time to get to know you better. You deserve nothing less than happiness and the best life has to offer. I wish you all the best in your junior and senior years, if I come visit, I’ll definitely come to see you.\n\nTo Nathan Handjojo (Jo Nat Han Hand Jo Jo), I will you height. Or at least not having people calling you short every day (though Annabelle is going to graduate so maybe it will lower?). Every interaction I have had with you causes me to at some point burst into laughter, for which I am supremely thankful. You have an incredible understanding of build technology and jargon that I could not hope to rival, and I wish you the best of luck as next year’s build captain. The memory of you that sticks the most closely to me is you and Wyatt sawing off the top of Air Trajectory so as to not get tiered, and the unbelievability that all that work didn’t matter possibly because they thought you were a Division B student. Even though others may make fun of you for being young or short (even though 5’3” is not that short), your intellect and funny nature make you a fun person to be around. I wish you all the best in your next 2 years at IMSA, and I’m looking forward to reading about you winning more medals and recruiting more sophomores.\n\nTo Jade Go, the child, youngin, *insert any other way to write the word younger than me by a lot*, I will you shortcuts to every possible Wikipedia page on anyone remotely related to fine arts. I first met you as Samuel Go’s younger sister, but you’ve become so much more of a friend than you’ll ever know. Even though I might call you a child, I see you as a promising Quiz Bowl, Science Bowl, and possible future Science Olympiad member (who knows?), who can even exceed the great Nathaniel Huang and Stephen Walsh. I really wish we could have spent more time together, chatting about flute pieces, eating Oreos and Panera Bread, and definitely reading Wikipedia together. You are such a fun and bright individual to be around. I wish you all the best in your future and IMSA and beyond. I will miss meeting you in the hallway with you rolling your little backpack.\n\nTo Katherine Jiang, my little cursed friend, I will you a future position as Science Olympiad Captain (not sure if I can do that but I will anyway). You are amongst both the funnest and funniest people I have ever met, thank you for making my senior year a whole lot brighter. The experiences I’ve had with you are amazing, from talking about music recommendations to talking about boba and other food. Even though you still might be a little bit cursed, you still give energy to the people around you through thoughtful and sometimes random conversations. Thank you for being you! I wish you the best of luck on your journey through IMSA, please don’t lose yourself along the way.\n\nTo Eric Lee, future master cello player, I will you the best time in French 4 & 5 during the next 2 years with Madame! When I first met you I thought you were a mini Annabelle Zhang: playing the cello, tested into French 3 with Monsieur, and being passionate about Science Olympiad. But I realized after I got to know you that wasn’t the case, as you have the potential to be so much more than her. I really wish that we could have been WIDI partners more during practice, and even at competitions. It was really fun to compete in Microbe Mission with you at the Harlem Invitational, even though you had absolutely no experience, and just used the note sheet. Please be Aahana’s WIDI partner next year, I know you’ll go far with your determination and practice! I wish you all the best in your future endeavors, and please stay in touch and keep me updated on the interesting things that Katherine ends up doing!\n\nTo Science Olympiad, (one of) the best co-curriculars on campus, I will you victory at State next year, and an appearance at Nats as well. Even though I’ve only been officially on the team for this year, I’ve seen the stresses this co-curricular can put on the brightest minds (cough–cough– Annabelle–cough). Even so, this year was full of such wonderful memories because of everyone on the team this year. From last-minute studying before test events to watching Wyatt and Nathan use a multitool to literally see the top of Air Trajectory off, I’m eternally grateful for the wonderful experiences you all have given me. Next year will be even better than this year, and I additionally will you some wonderful cracked sophomores to keep the legacy going.\n\nTo Quiz Bowl, (one of) the other best co-curricular on campus, I will you the best advisor and practice sets for next year. It has been the greatest pleasure of my day to walk directly across the hall from 8th mod BC 2 and have all my worries melt away from all your funny comments. From every toss-up gotten right, every neg resulting in screaming, every stolen buzz from your teammates, and everything in between, you all are why I’ve dedicated myself to attempting to spend more time on Wikipedia than YouTube. Even though I might not be the most cracked person on the team, I value every time someone congratulates me on getting a question right. Thank you for all the fun memories. To quote Jason Qin: “I hope you all continue on your path to knowledge, world domination, and annihilation of Auburn.”\n\nTo Science Bowl, the best club on campus (join if you haven’t already!), I will you all eventual co-curricular status. Even though the path has been rocky (even that might be a bit of an understatement), I trust you will expand the knowledge of Science Bowl to new horizons. Spending the hour and a half before lead running through some sometimes dubious science bowl questions from the NSBE website often makes my Wednesday. I additionally will you the best IMSA student for the role of Energy Captain next year. Hopefully, they know a lot of information about what National Labs are currently working on (bonus points if their parents work at a National Lab or they are doing a SIR or Internship at one). All in all, I wish you all the best of luck for next year. Please demolish all the Naperville North teams at Regionals and make it to Nationals in Washington D.C. for us seniors.\n\nTo all the Culture Show Ninjas I have worked with as Ninja Head, I will you all less difficulties working backstage during future culture shows. It was so much fun to get to work with all of you, from running on stage to collect feathers, closing an outlet box, or passing microphones from script actor to script actor or MC to MC. Being a Ninja is such a fun way to get involved in culture shows, without all the stress of performing. The Service Hours are a bonus though! I wish you all the best during the future culture shows, and I will watch them, whether it be in-person or remotely through the live stream!\n\nTo all who live in 1506, I will you all the best room placement to fit your needs and friend groups. As someone who has lived in 06 for three years (it truly doesn’t feel that long though), I’ve gotten to know so many amazing people, from the alumni 2 years my senior to the current sophomores just about to finish their first year at the academy. 06 has such a great community of people, and I know that all of you will move on to do great things in the future. I’m not sure what else to write, but a few key all-hall reminders I’ve come up with (not addressing anyone in particular): 1. Don’t leave your laundry in the washer or dryer for an extended period of time. It’s annoying. 2. Please don’t scream your lungs out after 10 pm. It makes me very concerned and scared for your wellbeing. 3. Don’t clog the sink or burn food in the microwave. I don’t think I need to explain this. 4. Don’t set up camp on a bench outside of a B-wing or C-wing window and make out with another individual, it is very awkward for the people who have their window blinds up. And finally, the most important reminder, 5. Make sure to treat all 06 individuals with respect, and treat people the way you want to be treated. I sincerely wish you all the best of luck in your future lives and IMSA and beyond, and please make 06 into an even better hall than it currently is!\n\nAnd to everyone at IMSA, I will you all the best in your future endeavors, and an amazing experience at IMSA. You do make lifelong friends here, students who care and help you in the best and funniest ways, teachers who encourage you to follow your passions, and staff members who provide the best opportunities for you to grow. Remember that your journey here at IMSA is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and experience, meaning you need to make the most of it. This could be by participating in clubs and co-curricular activities, dancing or acting in culture and drama shows, and so many more that I can’t possibly list them all.\n\nIn short, your time here at IMSA is special, something that not everyone gets to experience. But it’s only 3 years maximum, and it goes by fast. So enjoy your time here at IMSA, and have a lot of fun along the way. P.S. Please remember “to ignite and nurture creative, ethical, scientific minds that advance the human condition” (sorry I had to sneak it in somewhere).\n\nManya Davis\n\nTo Anjali Samal, I will you Jalsa modern choreo. You’ve done it once and you can do it again. You were the best co-choreo one could ever ask for. I don’t think I need to go into specifics about why because if you take a look at what we created together, you just know. Not only did we manage to pull off a spectacular dance, but we brought together a community of dancers who loved and supported each other, and I have full trust that you can do that again. Seeing you grow not only as a dancer but as a choreographer too has been one of the greatest gifts I’ve received during my time here. Never in my life did I think I’d get the chance to meet someone like you who is in almost every way exactly like me but not like me at all. We’ve said it a million times, but I still can’t fathom how we are living the same lives but as two separate people. When I’m off at college next year you’d better keep me updated on the day-to-day craziness that’s happening in your life as will I. And as for the culture shows, I will be expecting a full schedule of show dates and a list of the dances you’re in so that I can scream your name from the audience when I come visit. There’s too much on my mind for me to put into this will because I love you too much, so I’ll say this—good luck next year, get some actual sleep, and I’ll miss you so much.\n\nTo Tommy Blough, I will you stronger knees and ankles…and wrists for the countless times you will be running back and forth between volleyball and dances next year. I’m not going to lie, but I really couldn’t figure out what else to will you. I wish I could will everyone else the chance to meet you because I think that everyone needs someone like you in their life. I can’t count the times when you’ve just absolutely had my back, and I also can’t thank you nearly enough for that. Tommy, you are one of the most genuine and sweet people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I’ve said it before, but I wish I had gotten the chance to meet you earlier than my senior year here because you are one of the reasons why my last year here was the best. I still think it’s kind of funny how the first time I got to know you was at your audition and not through anyone from 03, but I guess that’s just how things go. Dancing with you in Jalsa modern and then again in Asante modern were some of the best times I’ve had at IMSA. Even though it wasn’t always easy, you managed to make it a lot less stressful. You’ve got an absolutely radiant energy that can brighten a room once you walk in and I hope you never lose that. I’m so excited to visit next year to see you in all of the culture shows, so please don’t die in the process.\n\nTo Tianqing Lei, I will you many more chances to see you absolutely kill it on stage the next two years. You are genuinely one of the best dancers I have ever seen, and I’m just absolutely in awe of how you managed to pull off being in this many dances in your first year at IMSA. Anyone can see the passion and dedication you have towards dancing, and it’s such a pleasure to dance with you. Come to think of it, I can’t think of a time when I got to watch you dance purely because I’m pretty sure I was in some way up on stage with you (I could be remembering this wrong). Regardless, I can’t wait to visit next year and see you up on stage (potentially even as the choreo yourself?). You are such a sweet person, and I’m so glad I got to know you this year. Every time I see you you always bring a smile to my face, except for when you jumpscare me. That’s not always appreciated, but only because you gave me a heart attack each time. I love you so much, and I hope you reach out next year if you ever need anything or even just to say hi because I will miss you so so much.\n\nTo Laksh Mehta, I will you a stress-free senior year so you can keep being the annoyance that you are to all of your future choreos. When I tell you that you somehow managed to get on my nerves every single day in practice… In all seriousness, though, you’re probably one of my favorite people to have in practice. Aside from the fact that it seemingly takes you forever to implement a correction so simple as turning the right way, you’re also the joy and life of every practice. You’ve got a contagious smile and make dancing fun. For that I can’t thank you enough. Also, though I may not have seen it at first, you’re incredibly hardworking, and I appreciate all of the effort you put into both Jalsa and Asante modern. It was a pleasure to have you in two of the dances I choreographed at IMSA. I’ll miss being your choreographer next year, and I can’t wait to visit and see you up on stage at the culture shows next year.\n\nTo Mahima Krishnan, I will you many more chances to showcase your beautiful smile on stage. When I first got to share the stage with you during Jalsa modern, I was in awe with how you captivated the audience. However, what always made me happy is the way you never let your smile drop on stage or during practice and even after dancing for hours. You have a radiant energy, and I hope more people get the chance to see that.\n\nTo Elaine Rao, I will you a much less stressful senior year. You push yourself so hard and I admire you so much for the determination you have. I honestly don’t know how you managed to be in so many dances this year all while battling the fight that was junior year. I can’t put into words how much of a pleasure it was to dance with you this year. Being in Orgo with you was also so much fun, and thank you for always being the one who knew what was going on because I certainly did not. You’re such a sweet person to be around and I wish you nothing but happiness next year.\n\nTo Jake Belonio, I will you a less stressful senior year. You are much stronger than me because I can’t fathom how you not only managed but thrived during your junior year here. Even though it was probably hell on Earth being in a million dances AND volleyball AND in extracurriculars, I hope you continue to do all of the things that you love to do. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, you have an amazing energy that makes everyone happy once you walk in a room and it’s because of all the passion and hard work you put into the things that you love. I know you’re going to do great things your senior year and beyond, and I can’t wait to see that.\n\nTo Kayleen Yoo, I will you a stress-free junior year (I know that is impossible, but I can hope for the best) so that you can be in more dances. The stage needs your presence Kayleen. You were such a pleasure to have in practices for Jalsa modern, and I hope to see you on stage when I visit for the culture shows next year.\n\nTo Nidhi Sagaram, I will you something generic and cute because I couldn’t figure out what to will you, but I needed to tell you that I think you are an amazing person. You are probably the funniest sophomore I know. Your laugh is contagious and your sense of humor is a 10/10. I’m sad I didn’t get the chance to talk to you more, but being in clash together was so much fun. I hope you and the rest of 1506 has a successful clash season next year. With your talent nobody else stands a chance.\n\nTo Aashi Dharia, I will you many more baddie center parts for 06 drill next year. Though I didn’t get to know you very well, every time I got to talk to you, you were such a sweetheart and always had a smile on your face. I loved saying hi to you in the halls or when I passed by the U-bench. You’re also a great dancer, and it was so fun having you in drill this year. I wish you an exciting and stress-free senior year!\n\nTo EmmaLi Isham, I will you the several $1 milkshakes I will be taking you out for when you visit UChicago on Wednesdays. Though I only really started talking to you in my last semester here, you’re a really cool person who I wish I had gotten to meet sooner. I hope you have an amazing senior year. You’re going to do great things.\n\nTo Kaella Moraga, I will you an easier time being an F-Trad choreo than when I was in it. Dancing with you is so much fun, and I wish I got to hang out with you more because it’s always fun to talk to you. I hope you have a great senior year!\n\nTo Navya Dixit, I will you a “calc-based-less” senior year and the best SSS one could ask for. Navya, you are incredible. You are so hardworking and driven, yet you manage to do it all with a smile on your face. I’m always happy to see you because regardless of whatever is going on, your silly jokes and sweet personality manage to brighten my mood. I still think it’s crazy how we both went to STEM and ended up here. I won’t forget that day in the lunch line when we put those pieces together. Keep killing it next year, and reach out if you ever need anything (or just because).\n\nTo Hailey Messina, I will you the future of 06 drill stunts. I can’t thank you enough for all of the effort you put into drill this year. Having you at practices was so fun, and I’m sorry that it couldn’t all work out in the end. Even then, I’m grateful to have gotten to know you a little better, and I’m hoping that you bring that same passion to clash next year that you did this year.\n\nTo Amada Garcia I will you a successful clash season and a talent show act that doesn’t almost get pulled three times (you are actually incredible for pulling that off in the end).\n\nTo Carter and Kelsie, I will you more choreographers who will do their own lights. You both make amazing booth heads and are going to kill it next year. I can’t wait to visit for the culture shows. You guys are going to do great!\n\nTo all future modern choreographers, I will you lights. Do them yourself. If there’s one thing I learned about culture show lighting is that it’s always easier to do them when you’re the one choreographing. Not to mention, you can make them really cool (granted it might make you want to pull your hair out). And of course you can always reach out to me if you need help!\n\nMarcus Kubon\n\nTo Anthony Marquez, I will you infinite rizz. You were the first underclassman I ever talked to, and for that I am very grateful, because if it was anyone else I probably would have never talked to another underclassman again. Your dry humor and insightful conversation was a blessing through the rough time that was my junior year (plus living in A wing in general). I hope you make it through senior year successfully. If you need anything don’t hesitate to reach out. I believe in you so much!\n\nTo Jose Lazcano, I will you a much deserved break. You are genuinely the most hardworking person I’ve ever met, and I am always so shocked and inspired by how much you are able to get done on campus for so many people despite the many roadblocks. Your story at IMSA has always really resonated with me. Despite how busy you are, you stay super funny and classy, which I love! You helped make directing Casa one of the best experiences I’ve ever had, so thank you! I know Alma and FOCUS are in great hands.\n\nTo Dael Garzon Torres, I will you a blossoming friendship with our beloved DEI office. I appreciated your hardworking presence on Alma and FOCUS, and I am always impressed by how capable you are at every initiative that you involve yourself in. Every time I talked to you was a breath of fresh air, because you always know exactly what’s going on, and tell the chisme in a funny way. I can’t wait to see what you do for this campus and our communities next year!\n\nTo Nelly Pinon, I will you more sleep. You are genuinely the sweetest person I’ve ever met, and your positive energy is infectious. I love our conversations because you are always so chaotic and humorous while staying put together and on top of it. Good luck with everything next year, cuz I know you will overload yourself (and stay killing it)!\n\nTo Tommy Blough, I will you the ability to not be a flop. Ok but genuinely, I do like you. Despite how annoyed I always act with you, I have enjoyed our conversations over the last two years, and you are pretty insightful sometimes. You’re officially the king of flop nation. Congrats!\n\nTo Dani Pasillas, I will you the legacy of Hauser Jr High and Ames Elementary. From our first conversations, I could tell you are such a capable, kind, funny, and energetic person, and genuinely so insightful. One of my favorite memories this year was talking about all the memories from growing up in Riverside (let’s please do this again). I still think it’s crazy you know my brother.\n\nTo Amada Garcia, I will you to become an alpha at IMSA. I believe you are genuinely the future of this institution, and have the drive, energy, and attitude to make it better. You are also so witty and intelligent and I love how you always play along with my stupidity.\n\nTo Cindy Gonzalez, I will you infinite robux. I love the dry sense of humor and chisme you brought to Alma. You were always on top of everything that you took on for the club, and I know you will take it in a good direction!\n\nTo Izabella Kutyla, I will you many more dance parties! You are the best dancer I’ve ever met (please teach me some more moves please), and your positive energy and humor is so contagious! I loved getting to know you on Alma, and I know you will make Casa great next year!\n\nTo next year’s Alma board, I will you so much success and energy! Alma Latina was genuinely the only club I really cared about this year. Alma became like a family to me through my time at IMSA, and I am so grateful for all the laughs and chisme sessions. Maybe I’ll come back to see Casa next year, idk…\n\nTo Lexington Mystery Meat, I will you musical talent. (jk I love you guys.) But genuinely you are the future of band culture on this campus. I know Ten Check is leaving a big legacy, so you guys better not flop at filling it! You guys always had the vibe of like a teenage dirtbag indie movie rock band, which I admittedly love.\n\nTo Jazz Ensemble board, I will you more success than we had this year. Good luck yall, it was genuinely way harder to run this club than I thought.\n\nTo 03 Flop Nation, I will you CLASH next year! Despite how much I make fun of yall, I genuinely have loved being a part of the 1503 community the past two years, and flop nation helped make it feel like my home. The flop commons is the spirit of 03, and I hope the energy stays strong next year.\n\nTo FOCUS (if it even continues next year) I will you a fighting spirit. It takes a lot of determination, resilience, and patience to do this work, but I believe in this organization’s power to make this campus better, because it was founded on the right principles. Good luck, y’all, you’ll probably need it.\n\nMars Wylie\n\nTo Lex, I will you what you’re probably expecting, the makeup department, at least for the next year or so. I’ve seen you for the last (nearly) two years, and you’ve demonstrated yourself to be not only a highly competent person but an incredible friend as well. Your leadership skills are there whether you recognize it or not, and I have every faith you’ll do as amazing as you already are this week. Not to mention how you’re the absolute best at hair (I can’t really leave that to you as it’s already yours). Know I’m one text away, and I’m so excited to see what you do next.\n\nTo Megan: I leave the responsibility of color matching for the next few years /hj. You’ve done so well, and I have loved seeing you thrive over this past year. Yesterday I watched you figure out a way to make a blood bag out of a balloon filled with cake mix and laundry detergent actually get filled and secured, then did it two more times. You’re impressive, and I hope you know it.\n\nTo whoever comes after in IMSA drama, tech, and especially the makeup department: You’re gonna be fine, no matter how the next show goes, even if you drop a flat, color match someone wrong, or forget a line. My name’s on some random flats and lumber in the back!! :))\n\nTo Nathan, I will you a legacy of IMSA chaos that I know you’ll take on effectively and with great glee. I have faith in your abilities, and that you will do me proud (alongside your large band of adventurers).\n\nTo Jasper, I will you the statement: you will be okay. I have no doubt in my mind that your life will be a happy one, and that you will succeed. You have the skills necessary to do well, no matter what that looks like in your life.\n\nTo anyone else I met during my time at IMSA: thank you for the time we’ve shared, I care about so many more people than I have the motivation and time to write a will for.\n\nMelinda Yuan\n\nTo Luci Stocco, I will you unlimited wingstop boneless meal deals and Louisiana voodoo fries. I hope these savory indulgences bring you comfort amidst balancing CAB Director, NHS ;-), Irish dancing, school, and the rest of your extracurriculars. I’m always impressed by how well you balance everything you are involved in and how committed you are to each thing. Regardless, don’t forget to take time for yourself, and maintain the things that make you unmistakably you. Keep on going on your weekend adventures, nurturing your caffeine addiction and telling funny-ish dad jokes. Spending time with you is always a good time. It has been a privilege and a joy to get to know you these past two years, and I know you will continue to bring happiness to everyone in your proximity.\n\nTo Gabi Boscarino, I will you a scientist themed dance paired with an enthusiastic Sid the Science Kid song and black jazz shoes. Becoming close with you has made my senior year so much better and I always look forward to seeing you & being greeted with a hug. Your funniest trait has to be your inability to control your facial expressions. Those reactions always made practice more entertaining. However, my favorite thing about you is your compassion and authenticity. These qualities are going to bring you so far and I know you are going to do so well next year. I’ll miss you so much Gabikins, come visit me next year <3\n\nTo IMSA Dance Team (Michayla, Elaine, Gabi, Alyssa), I will you San Frandisco by Dom Dolla. This season has been my favorite out of all three years I’ve been on IMSA dance team. From “dressing up” as yoga moms from the 80s for jazz to stealing all of coach’s snacks, thank you for the best senior season. I miss listening to Aleks updates and maybe even Michayla’s story about her brother crashing their cars (though I’ve already heard this one like 100x). Never bring up cars and driving in front of Michayla!! Nevertheless, I hope you guys have the best season next year and don’t annoy coach too much. (or do)\n\nMichael Zyskowski\n\nTo 05D Downquad and the rest of the Ultimate Frisbee underclassmen, I will you a full year filled with crazy catches and huge pulls. I wanted to thank each and every one of you for letting me play with y’all this year. Can’t wait to play many more fun games in the future!!\n\nTo Vincent You and Arjun Brahmandam, I will you the IMSA Jazz Ensemble. I hope you can grow the club beyond what I managed to do. Keep auditioning for culture shows and bring that groovy jazz we all know and love to IMSA’s campus. Thanks for sticking by me and being two people I could always count on.\n\nTo Josefh Hernandez, I will you a basic land of your choosing. I’m going to be honest, when I first applied to be your little sib I didn’t know what I was getting into. I met the timid sophomore year Josefh who still hadn’t broken out of his shell. I can say with confidence that this is no longer the case. I’m glad I got to see you blossom into the awesome and fun personality that you have. Good luck next year with HCL!\n\nTo Maneth Perera, I will you a case of Frescas. Thank you for all the Frescas you gave me through the school year. You always keep them at the perfect temperature in your minifridge.\n\nTo Diego Nava, I will you next year’s COTH decs head. Thanks for helping out with decs this year. I couldn’t have done without you and every other person who pitched in to help. Carry 05’s decs legacy next year!! I have faith in you Diego!\n\nTo Ketzaly Nunez, I will you one large bag of Big Mix. I honestly didn’t know you at all before the Mexico trip and I’m glad I can now call you a friend. Thanks for helping me out when I tried to order food and whatnot and giving me those food recs.\n\nMuna Onwuameze\n\nTo Freddy, I will you to be the best hooper next year even though you might not play on the team and to become a grown man next year.\n\nTo Benny, I will you to still have the Ivory Coast pride next year and to find your main fifa team. And to also still be the best dancer out of the family.\n\nTo Oumar, I will you to go crazy next basketball season and to take over the team. Make sure you get to 1000 points.\n\nTo Michael, I will you to take care of the younger siblings and go crazy next year. Make sure you do yo thang next year.\n\nTo Mofe,I will you to go crazy next basketball season. Take over the team and try to become the captain eventually.\n\nTo Inioluwa, I will you stay as the best FIFAplayer on campus and to make sure to cook for everyone who plays you. Don’t let me get better than you.\n\nMyra Mensah\n\nTo all my C-wing underclassmen, Rishima, Aparna, Greenley Indy, Fedora Maryam, Trina, Nelly, Yaalini, Amy, Aini, Jade, Jediel, Alvena, Amelia, Ruby, Lucy, Anika, Anwita, and Taliyah, I will you fun in the rest of your IMSA year(s). I have loved being one of your few seniors. It has been so fun talking to you all about the hottest tea, getting to know and be closer to you all, and even scolding you for staying up super late studying when you have to wake up at 6:30 the next morning. Please keep being fun people, be quirky, be studious, be relaxed. Spend time with each other and make memories you’ll always remember. IMSA doesn’t last forever, so make the best of it. I wish you all luck in the coming years and I will miss you<3\n\nTo my Woodmans crew, Chris, Noel, and Ezra, i will you millions more memorable trips. I had so so so much fun that day messing around and parading through the store with you guys. It’s hard to remember that IMSA can be fun with all of the other things that us students worry about, but don’t forget to enjoy the little fun moments being here gives you:) Good luck with senior year!\n\nTo all my Outdoor Indoor underclassmen, Bih-Sana, Anna, Gabs, Aria, Katelyn, Chris, and everyone else, I will you MC energy. You guys were so fun to have class with, you really made me feel like a main character every single day. I have never had that much fun with a whole class before. Yes, maybe my game did suck, but you guys all made that game so much more fun. Good luck with senior year, you’ll all do amazing:))\n\nTo my summer@imsa besties, Jongwoo, Aashi, and Tommy, I will you more summer memories. I absolutely loved group leading with you guys. Every day was honestly such an adventure, and I have had so much fun getting to know you all. Keep being level-headed in the less ideal situations, and enjoy the small things. Have fun in senior year:))\n\nTo the most iconic trio, Aubri, Fedora, and Adeola, I will you powerpuff girl powers. You guys are so adorable. You all compliment each other so well. You’re supportive and silly and stronger together, lean on each other through these IMSA years. Fedora, you’re such a buttercup. You’"
