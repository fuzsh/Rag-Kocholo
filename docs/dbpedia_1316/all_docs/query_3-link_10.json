Fill in any blanks in the sequence with your thoughts and write your conclusion response in the space provided.\n\nThe United States began its 25-year involvement in Vietnam at the end of World War II. France had ruled the colony of \"French Indochina,\" including modern Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, for decades. After France fell to the Axis powers in World War II, Japan occupied the territory. As WWII came to a close and a Japanese surrender seemed likely, the Viet Minh — a communist-led organization dedicated to Vietnamese independence led by Ho Chi Minh — launched an uprising and declared Vietnam to be an independent state.\n\nHowever, after WWII, France moved to regain control of the area, leading to war between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). From 1946–1950, the United States remained neutral. Then in 1950, President Truman authorized direct financial and military assistance to the French since the U.S. Government wanted France’s cooperation to stop the spread of communism in Europe.\n\nPhotograph of President Truman and French President Charles de Gaulle During Welcoming Ceremonies on the White House Lawn, with Officers Saluting in the Background\n\nEnter your response\n\nThe 1954 Geneva Accords settled the war between France and North Vietnam, called the First Indochina War. The agreement separated Vietnam at the 17th Parallel, creating a communist state in the North and a French-backed non-communist state in the south. It also called for an election in 1956 to reunify the two.\n\nThen-President Eisenhower didn't want reunification to result in a Communist Vietnam. He believed \"losing\" South Vietnam to communism would be a strategic, economic, and humanitarian disaster. So he pledged support to an emerging leader—Ngo Dinh Diem—a devout Catholic and fervent anti-French, anti-communist nationalist. Diem faced multiple threats: some members of his inherited government and military were associated with the hated French; mobsters controlled much of Saigon; and French-supported armed religious sects and military officers challenged his leadership. Against all odds, Diem consolidated power.\n\nEisenhower’s decision to support Diem with supplies and military advisers was the beginning of U.S. involvement with the South Vietnamese government.\n\nCommunism Means Terrorism\n\nEnter your response\n\nWhen Kennedy became President, he told a reporter: \"Vietnam is the place\" for a win. His administration had experienced the Bay of Pigs defeat in Cuba and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. He was convinced the United States could restore its Cold War credibility by saving Vietnam from communism.\n\nThe Diem government faced attacks from within South Vietnam from Communist insurgents (the People’s Liberation Armed Forces) in rural areas. Kennedy supplied thousands of additional military advisers and equipment to South Vietnam to fight the Communist insurgents. He resisted sending ground troops, however, against his advisers’ persistent urging.\n\nAdditionally, protests grew within South Vietnam against the increasingly unpopular Diem regime; but Diem ignored U.S. calls for reform. The United States offered support when a group of generals plotted a coup d’état. Diem was overthrown and assassinated. Kennedy was ambivalent about abandoning Diem, and knew it would anger members of Congress, but said they would \"be madder if Vietnam goes down the drain.\"\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Memoir Dictation\n\nEnter your response\n\nSouth Vietnam was in political chaos after the coup. North Vietnam escalated the war in hopes of bringing Communists to power before America fully intervened. Despite doubts about its significance and winnability, President Johnson said he was \"not going to lose Vietnam.\"\n\nIn August 1964, President Johnson announced on TV that American ships had been attacked twice in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin near North Vietnam. Congress quickly passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, giving Johnson unprecedented power to \"take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.\"\n\nWhen contrary information about the Gulf of Tonkin incidents surfaced — the ship USS Maddox had been conducting electronic eavesdropping on North Vietnam to assist South Vietnamese Army raids on North Vietnamese targets — many believed Congress had been conned.\n\nJoint Resolution of August 10, 1964, Public Law 88-408, 78 STAT 384, to Promote the Maintenance of International Peace and Security in Southeast Asia\n\nEnter your response\n\nPresident Johnson planned a course of gradual involvement in Vietnam that he hoped would avoid public scrutiny. Though his advisers predicted \"disastrous defeat,\" he was intent on proving his and America’s \"credibility.\"\n\nEarly in 1965, Communist forces attacked a U.S. Army airfield in South Vietnam. This gave the Johnson administration a reason to launch Operation Rolling Thunder, a sustained bombing campaign against North Vietnam. The planned air strikes created a need for an air base with protection. So, the first American ground troops arrived soon after the bombing began. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. combat troops followed. America was at war.\n\nWithin a year, 175,000 American troops were in Vietnam. U.S. bombers dropped 643,000 tons of bombs between 1965 and 1968 during Operation Rolling, killing approximately 52,000 Vietnamese civilians.\n\nMemo from McGeorge Bundy to President Lyndon B Johnson\n\nEnter your response\n\nBack in the United States, antiwar protests intensified. Public support for the war fell below 50 percent for the first time. In October 1967, nearly 100,000 people joined the March on the Pentagon to protest the war. The White House tried to fight dissent with news of progress. Military officers were pressured to overestimate enemy casualties and underestimate enemy strength. The Johnson administration even called General Westmoreland, commander of the U.S. military in Vietnam, home from the battlefield to present a glowing report to the American people.\n\nIn Vietnam, the American strategy was to suppress the Communist insurgency through the ground war while winning the hearts and minds of the South Vietnamese people through humanitarian efforts. But it was difficult to gain support when combat forces were using search-and-destroy tactics to look for insurgents, upending the villages and lives of the South Vietnamese. And the U.S. State Department concluded that, while North Vietnam was supporting the Communists in South Vietnam, most of the Communist insurgents were coming from the South Vietnamese population itself.\n\nAmerica seemed to be fighting on three fronts: 1) militarily against North Vietnam, 2) convincing people in South Vietnam to support U.S. efforts, and 3) dealing with new levels of antiwar activism at home.\n\nPublic Reactions: The March on the Pentagon\n\nEnter your response\n\nOn January 31, 1968, the South Vietnamese were looking forward to Tet, a celebration of the lunar new year. They were caught off guard when 70,000 Communist troops attacked more than 100 towns and cities with sudden brutality and violence – the beginning of what became known as the Tet Offensive. Most of the fighting was over in a few days, but a second wave came in late April and a third in August.\n\nAlthough the Communists suffered devastating casualties and their attempt to spark a general uprising completely failed, many Americans concluded the United States and its allies had suffered a massive defeat. When a Defense Department report regarding the need for 205,000 more American troops was leaked to the New York Times, Americans concluded the war was at a standstill and the Johnson administration had lied to them.\n\nThe administration began to question its strategy in Vietnam. President Johnson gave a speech on March 31, 1968, calling for a halt to bombing, greater reliance on the South Vietnamese, and a modest troop increase. In April, North Vietnam agreed to open peace talks.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson Speech Regarding Bombing Halt and Decision Not to Run for Re-election\n\nEnter your response\n\nRichard Nixon’s Presidential campaign advocated bringing the war to an honorable end. However, President Johnson had received a tip that the Nixon campaign was attempting to interfere with the peace negotiations. He ordered surveillance on the South Vietnam Embassy and on Anna Chennault, a fundraiser for Nixon’s campaign. Controversy remains, but documents from the time lend weight to the argument that candidate Nixon played a direct role in obstructing a peace agreement.\n\nOnce elected, President Nixon announced his plan for \"Vietnamization\" – increasingly turning the war over to the South Vietnamese. After millions demonstrated in the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam in late 1969, he asked \"the great silent majority\" of Americans for their support. He escalated the bombing and expanded the war in Cambodia and Laos. The war continued for four years, during which 21,041 Americans and over 2 million Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians were killed.\n\nH. R. Haldeman’s Notes\n\nEnter your response\n\nIn a coup strongly encouraged by the United States, a U.S.-friendly government came to power in Cambodia. The Vietnamese Communists used neutral Cambodia as a place to regroup and store weapons. President Nixon planned to send ground troops to Cambodia to attack Communist sanctuaries and central headquarters. There is speculation that Nixon hoped to destabilize the enemy in order to provide a \"decent interval\" in which South Vietnam could fend for itself while American troops pulled out.\n\nNixon televised his decision to initiate the Cambodian campaign. This apparent expansion of the war increased antiwar activity that escalated to a national crisis when four students were shot at a protest in Ohio at Kent State University. The public was unaware that Nixon had been secretly bombing Cambodia since mid-March 1969—an increased continuation of a covert bombing campaign started by Johnson in 1965.\n\nCampus Scene, Kent State University (OH)\n\nEnter your response\n\nIn February 1970, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger began negotiations with North Vietnam. Hoping to gain an edge in these deliberations, North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam in March. Nixon was enraged by the \"Spring Offensive.\" It threatened his reelection and his budding relationship with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, countries he hoped might abandon North Vietnam for the promise of improved American relations. In a recorded conversation, he told Kissinger he would retaliate by bombing \"the bastards like [they'd] never been bombed before.\"\n\nIn October, a defeated North Vietnam made concessions and Kissinger announced \"peace is at hand.\" But South Vietnamese President Thieu balked at the agreement and demanded changes. When Kissinger attempted to renegotiate, the talks collapsed. Nixon blamed North Vietnam and ordered a massive \"Christmas Bombing\" to bring both sides back to the table.\n\nText of Letter from President Nixon to President Thieu\n\nEnter your response\n\nNorth Vietnam returned to the negotiating table. On January 27, 1973, the Paris Peace Accords officially ended the war in Vietnam. The final agreement was only superficially different from the draft reached in October 1972 before the \"Christmas Bombing.\" South Vietnamese President Thieu reluctantly signed after Nixon secretly promised \"swift and severe retaliatory action\" if North Vietnam violated it. Nixon and Kissinger declared they had achieved \"peace with honor\" and hoped it would last long enough to give South Vietnam a fighting chance.\n\nIn fact the war was far from over. Fighting between North and South continued and even increased in places. North Vietnam began preparations to overtake the South. President Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal, could not provide the backup he had promised.\n\nMultilateral Agreement between the United States, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Republic of Vietnam, and Provisional Revolutionary Government of Vietnam (English)\n\nEnter your response\n\nThe Communists continued to infiltrate South Vietnam. The 1973 Case-Church Amendment prohibited U.S. military activity in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia without Congressional approval; though the United States continued to supply its ally with some military equipment and arms.\n\nNorth Vietnamese Army forces attacked major cities in March 1975 and the South Vietnamese Army crumbled. President Ford requested additional aid from Congress, which was not approved. His persistence had a symbolic purpose. It strengthened U.S. credibility and allowed his administration to blame Congress for South Vietnam’s fall.\n\nOn April 28, 1975, Ford ordered a last-minute evacuation of the last American civilians and South Vietnamese citizens who were at risk of retaliation by the Communists. The evacuation ended just hours before a North Vietnamese Army tank crashed the Imperial Palace gates in Saigon on April 30th – the Fall of Saigon and the end to the war. North Vietnam took over. In the years that followed, a total of 1.6 million Vietnamese refugees fled the Communist regime.\n\nTelegram from Ambassador Graham Martin Concerning the Evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam\n\nEnter your response\n\nAlmost a decade after the war ended, Americans who served were honored with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. \"The Wall that Heals\" was dedicated in 1982. After years of fundraising, Congressional legislation, and arguments over its design, Vietnam veteran Jan C. Scruggs realized his dream of a monument, not to the war, but to those who fought it. The names of more than 58,000 Americans who gave their lives are inscribed upon it.\n\nIn 1995, President Clinton announced the normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam. Today, the United States and Vietnam recognize that there is no conflict, and that there are issues upon which the two countries can work together.\n\nVisitors search for names on the face of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial after its official dedication\n\nEnter your response\n\n1\n\nActivity Element\n\nPhotograph of President Truman and French President Charles de Gaulle During Welcoming Ceremonies on the White House Lawn, with Officers Saluting in the Background\n\nPage 1\n\n2\n\nActivity Element\n\nCommunism Means Terrorism\n\nPage 1\n\n3\n\nActivity Element\n\nJohn F.

If so, after what episode and why didn't it?\n\nIf you were the U.S. President, would you have done things differently?\n\nYour Response\n\nDocument\n\nPhotograph of President Truman and French President Charles de Gaulle During Welcoming Ceremonies on the White House Lawn, with Officers Saluting in the Background\n\n8/22/1945\n\nThis photograph shows President Harry S. Truman and French President Charles de Gaulle during welcoming ceremonies on the White House lawn, with officers saluting in the background.\n\nIn this official visit to Washington in 1945, French President Charles de Gaulle thanked the United States for its help liberating France from German occupation during World War II.\n\nDuring the visit, Truman told de Gaulle that the U.S. would not oppose a return of French authority in Indochina. And when France went to war to recolonize Vietnam in 1945, the U.S. government needed its ally’s cooperation to contain the spread of communism in Europe.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1950, the United States adopted a neutral policy toward the conflict.

Earlier in 1954, the Geneva Accords had called for a temporary partition of Vietnam at the 17th Parallel—creating a communist state in the North and a French-backed non-communist state in the South.\n\nA series of events intensified the \"Red Scare\" that gripped Americans in the 1940s and 50s. In 1949 the Soviet Union successfully tested an atomic bomb. Chinese Communists formed the People’s Republic of China that same year. North Korea invaded South Korea the next. Many interpreted these events as evidence of a global Communist plot.\n\nUSIA posters were designed to promote U.S. values; to expose alleged Communist falsehoods, threats, and crimes; and to strengthen understanding of and support for U.S. objectives in the Cold War.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of the U.S. Information Agency.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 6948996\n\nFull Citation: Poster 306-PPB-124; Communism Means Terrorism; 9/15/1954; Propaganda Posters Distributed in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, ca. 1950 - ca. 1965; Records of the U.S. Information Agency, ; National Archives at College Park, College Park, MD.

Johnson. This is a \"ceremonial copy\" of the Public Law from the Lyndon B. Johnson Museum Collection.\n\nCongress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution with the understanding that U.S. ships had been attacked twice in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin near North Vietnam. They gave Johnson unprecedented power to “take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.”\n\nThere was little debate as legislators considered two incidents that had happened in the preceding days. On August 2 – the first Tonkin Gulf incident – North Vietnamese torpedo boats were spotted and attacked the destroyer USS Maddox. The Maddox was conducting electronic eavesdropping on North Vietnam to assist South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) commando raids on North Vietnamese targets, but that wasn't publicly known at the time. Historians now suspect the North Vietnamese boats had set out to attack an ARVN raid in progress when it encountered the Maddox.\n\nOn August 4, the USS Maddox captain reported a second incident, that he was “under continuous torpedo attack.” He later cabled “freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports,” but Defense Secretary Robert McNamara did not report the captain’s doubts to President Johnson. (A 2002 National Security Agency report made available in 2007 confirmed the August 2 attack, but concluded the August 4 attack never happened.)\n\nJohnson portrayed confrontations between U.S. and North Vietnamese ships off the coast of North Vietnam as unprovoked aggression. When contrary information surfaced, many believed Congress had been conned. It was too late.\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin act became more controversial as opposition to the war mounted. A Senate investigation revealed that the Maddox had been on an intelligence mission in Tonkin Gulf, contradicting Johnson’s denial of U.S. Navy support of such missions. The Resolution was repealed in 1971 in an attempt to curtail President Nixon’s power to continue the war.\n\nTranscript\n\nEighty-eighth Congress of the United States of America\n\nAT THE SECOND SESSION\n\nBegun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the seventh day of January, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-four\n\nJoint Resolution\n\nTo promote the maintenance of international peace and security in southeast Asia.\n\nWhereas naval units of the Communist regime in Vietnam, in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law, have deliberately and repeatedly attacked United States naval vessels lawfully present in international waters, and have thereby created a serious threat to international peace; and\n\nWhereas these attackers are part of deliberate and systematic campaign of aggression that the Communist regime in North Vietnam has been waging against its neighbors and the nations joined with them in the collective defense of their freedom; and\n\nWhereas the United States is assisting the peoples of southeast Asia to protest their freedom and has no territorial, military or political ambitions in that area, but desires only that these people should be left in peace to work out their destinies in their own way: Now, therefore be it\n\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress approves and supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.\n\nSection 2. The United States regards as vital to its national interest and to world peace the maintenance of international peace and security in southeast Asia. Consonant with the Constitution of the United States and the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance with its obligations under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the United States is, therefore, prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.\n\nSection 3. This resolution shall expire when the President shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international conditions created by action of the United Nations or otherwise, except that it may be terminated earlier by concurrent resolution of the Congress.\n\n[endorsements]\n\nThis primary source comes from the General Records of the United States Government.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 2803448\n\nFull Citation: Joint Resolution of August 10, 1964, Public Law 88-408, 78 STAT 384, to Promote the Maintenance of International Peace and Security in Southeast Asia; 8/10/1964; Enrolled Acts and Resolutions of Congress, 1789 - 2011; General Records of the United States Government, ; National Archives Building, Washington, DC.

Johnson Speech Regarding Bombing Halt and Decision Not to Run for Re-election\n\nPage 1\n\nDocument\n\nH. R. Haldeman’s Notes\n\n10/22/1968\n\nDuring a telephone call on the night of October 22, 1968, Presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon told his closest aide (and future chief of staff) H. R. Haldeman to \"monkey wrench\" President Johnson’s efforts to begin peace talks over the Vietnam War (see the second page of the notes). Nixon was campaigning on ending the Vietnam war and he thought a peace agreement might threaten his election.\n\nNixon long denied giving such an order, but Haldeman’s notes, which were quietly made public in 2007 and discovered by historian Jack Farrell in 2017, provide evidence of Nixon’s direct involvement.\n\nThe first page includes a notation to \"keep Anna Chennault working on SVN\" (South Vietnam). Nixon had sent Chennault as an emissary to tell President of South Vietnam Thieu, \"Hold on, we are gonna win.\" The implication was clear: Thieu should not sign the peace agreement President Johnson was currently negotiating. When Nixon became President, he would negotiate a peace deal that left Thieu in a more powerful position.\n\nTranscript\n\n[top left corner] RN [Richard Nixon]\n\n[crossed out in top right corner] R/W 2\n\nfile\n\n10/22\n\nlate\n\nZ [Possibly Ron Ziegler who became Nixon’s press secretary] - indicate tomorrow\n\nPreparing & recording 2 radio speeches\n\nHarlow [Bryce Harlow, a Republican strategist and Nixon aide] – Harlow monitoring V.Nam [Vietnam]\n\nFl – Andrews -if take a poll – inform us immy.\n\nG’ [in red: done] Rhodes [John Rhodes, House Minority Leader] says we’ve dropped on older people – use radio for Soc Sec spot & a nspr [newspaper] ad – nail the lie\n\nR+W – sit down w/ RW + Moore etc. – in terms of their thot [thought] on tempo & content\n\nhow do you want him to hit HH [Hubert Humphrey] – how hard?\n\nF? maybe have to bite V.N.\n\n!

This apparent expansion of the Vietnam War detonated an explosion of antiwar activity that escalated to a national crisis when four students were shot at a protest at Kent State University in Ohio.\n\nStudents had been protesting for days when the town mayor declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to help reestablish order. There were over 1,300 armed troops, armored personnel carriers, mortar launchers, and helicopters on the Kent State University campus on May 4, 1970.\n\nOhio National Guard troops opened fire on unarmed students. In a period of 13 seconds, 67 shots were fired, wounding nine—one paralyzed for life—and killing four students. Two of the slain victims were not protesters; they were walking to class. One was a member of the ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Corps) who was planning to go into the military.\n\nNews of the shootings rocked the nation. Many were outraged, but according to a Gallup Poll, 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for the violence at Kent State. Dean Kahler, who was shot and paralyzed during the attack, opened a letter when he came out of an induced coma. It began, “Dear communist hippie radical, I hope by the time you read this, you are dead.”\n\nIn response to the shootings President Nixon said, “When dissent turns to violence, it invites tragedy.” Others were horrified and erupted in protest. An estimated four million striking students shut down 800 campuses nationwide.\n\nPresident Nixon created the President’s Commission on Campus Unrest to investigate protest at schools across the country. It concluded that “the indiscriminate firing of rifles into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were unnecessary, unwarranted and inexcusable.” A federal grand jury indicted eight guardsmen, but found they were not subject to criminal prosecution because they acted in self defense.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of U.S. Attorneys.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 18542766\n\nFull Citation: Campus Scene, Kent State University (OH); 5/4/1970; The United States of America v.

Hoping to gain an edge in these deliberations, North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam in March 1972. President Nixon was enraged by this \"Spring Offensive\" and retaliated by bombing.\n\nIn October 1972, a defeated North Vietnam made concessions and Kissinger announced \"peace is at hand.\" But South Vietnamese President Thieu balked at the agreement and demanded changes. When Kissinger attempted to renegotiate, the talks collapsed.\n\nNixon blamed North Vietnam and ordered a massive \"Christmas Bombing\" to bring both sides back to the table. In this letter to Thieu, President Richard Nixon describes two motives for his December \"Christmas Bombing,\" which would take place the next day, December 18, 1972. He wants to quickly end the conflict, and to demonstrate how he would respond if the peace agreement were violated. Nixon was trying to convince a reluctant Thieu to sign the agreement by showing his commitment to South Vietnam.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Collection RN-SMOF: White House Staff Member and Office Files (Nixon Administration).\n\nFull Citation: Text of Letter from President Nixon to President Thieu; 12/17/1972; President's Personal Files, 1/20/1969 - 8/9/1974; Collection RN-SMOF: White House Staff Member and Office Files (Nixon Administration), ; Richard Nixon Library, Yorba Linda, CA.

He states that he is \"well aware of the danger here tomorrow and I want to get out tonight.\" He asks that the President send an order to finish the job quickly, evacuating the rest of the Americans and their children.\n\nThe American Ambassador to Vietnam resisted limiting the evacuation to Americans. In this cable he asks with evident desperation, “Perhaps you can tell me how to make some of these Americans abandon their half Vietnamese children?” Before sunrise on April 30, the Ambassador was forced to leave while a few hundred Vietnamese still awaited rescue.\n\nThis primary source comes from the Collection GRF-0330: Backchannel Messages (Ford Administration).\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 7367441\n\nFull Citation: Telegram from Ambassador Graham Martin Concerning the Evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam; 4/29/1975; Martin Channel, April 1975 - Incoming (3); Backchannel Cable Files, 1974 - 1977; Collection GRF-0330: Backchannel Messages (Ford Administration), ; Gerald R.
