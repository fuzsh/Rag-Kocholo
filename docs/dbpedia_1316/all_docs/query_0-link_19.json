        "text": "21 Cartoons That Were Based on Television Sitcoms\n\n1. The Brady Kids (1972)\n\nTalk about unintended consequences. When the grassroots group Action for Children’s Television (ACT) formed in 1968, it set out to improve children’s television programming in the United States by eliminating harmful content and deceptive advertising aimed at children. After concerned parents targeted cartoon violence in shows like Space Ghost and The Herculoids, the networks moved swiftly to replace them with Scooby-Doo clones, H.R. Pufnstuf, and other shows heavy on the light fantasy-comedy elements… which gave some TV producers an idea. Sensing an opportunity to expand into Saturday morning, TV producer Sherwood Schwartz approached Filmation about a cartoon based on The Brady Bunch; the resulting show, The Brady Kids, ran for 22 episodes between September 1972 and October 1973. As the cartoon’s title implied, the parents and Alice the housekeeper weren’t involved; instead, the kids (voiced by the six child stars from the live-action show) were joined by Marlon the talking mynah bird (who was also magic), Mop Top the dog, and twin pandas Ping and Pong. (Why pandas? Following Nixon’s visit to China in 1972, the Washington zoo received a pair of pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, as a gift from the Chinese premier, kicking off a wave of panda-mania in the U.S.) For no reason whatsoever, one adventure had the kids travel to ancient Greece with Wonder Woman — making the episode “It’s All Greek to Me” the first time the superhero appeared on television in any form.\n\n2. My Favorite Martians (1973)\n\nWith The Brady Kids, you can see how the idea makes sense; the live-action show was in the middle of its 1968-74 run and earned steady ratings throughout its five-year run. By contrast, My Favorite Martian was off the air seven years when the animated My Favorite Martians debuted on CBS in 1973. But the sitcom’s premise, a Martian with alien powers living in secret among us humans, must have seemed perfect for the new attitude in animation. To appeal to a younger audience, “Uncle Martin” (played by Ray Walston in the sitcom and voiced by Lost in Space’s Jonathan Harris in the cartoon) is joined by his Martian nephew “Andy,” who only has one antenna and thus lesser powers than Uncle Martin (a younger version of Andy appeared in just one episode of the live-action show). The pair have a Martian pet named Okey, a sort of bouncing sheepdog with antennae, and the cartoon gave Tim O’Hara (the Earthling who’s the “My” in My Favorite Martian) a young niece of his own, Katy. Over the course of 16 episodes, the O’Haras protected the aliens’ identities by pretending they were Katy’s Uncle Martin and his nephew Andy. Much like the original series, the arrival of these “distant” relatives living with Tim and Katy lead to neighboring Detective Bill Brennan (along with his son, Brad, who was added to the cartoon) routinely trying to uncover the truth about their mysterious new neighbors. Of course, this being a Filmation production in 1973 the Martians also strum electric guitars a la The Archies during their opening theme song. When in Rome (or on Earth)…\n\n3. Jeannie (1973)\n\nThough based on the 1960s sitcom I Dream of Jeannie starring Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman, there’s actually very little connecting the Hanna-Barbera cartoon to its sitcom inspiration. For starters, in the animated version Jeannie isn’t found by an astronaut; instead, she’s released from her bottle by high school student and surfer dude Corey Anders (voiced by Mark Hamill in his first-ever voice acting job). As well, the cartoon Jeannie (voiced by Julie McWhirter) is a teenager with red hair (as opposed to Eden’s blonde locks) who activates her magic by shaking her ponytail instead of Eden’s eye blinks, and the cartoon upped the hilarity (in theory, anyway) by pairing Jeannie with Babu (voiced by comedian and former Three Stooges member Joe Besser), a bumbling genie-in-training whose magic is more likely to backfire than not. Other members of the cast included Corey’s friend, Henry, the only other person aware of Jeannie’s identity as a genie; and S. Melvin Farthingale, a snobbish snoop who sneaks around the Anders’ home because of his suspicions about Jeannie and Babu. Aside from the 16 episodes that ran as part of CBS’s Saturday morning line-up until 1975, Jeannie and Babu also teamed up with the Mystery Inc. gang in one episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, and Babu appeared as a member of Team Scooby in Hanna-Barbera’s Laff-a-Lympics after ownership issues prevented Jeannie from joining him. Not even a genie messes with the lawyers.\n\n4. Partridge Family 2200 AD (1974)\n\nIf the futuristic-looking buildings in this image remind you of a certain other Hanna-Barbera cartoon set in the future, there’s a good reason for that. The studio’s animators pitched an updated version of The Jetsons that would depict the Jetson kids as older than they were in the original series, but CBS nixed that idea to make an animated version of The Partridge Family instead. Absolutely no explanation was given for why the musical family from the 1970-74 ABC sitcom was now living 225 years in the future with a dog named Orbit and alien friends who traveled with them to their intergalactic concert gigs. Danny Bonaduce, Brian Forster, and Suzanne Crough returned to voice Danny, Chris, and Tracy Partridge, just as they had for eight episodes of ABC’s Goober and the Ghost Chasers; Susan Dey recorded lines for two episodes before leaving to pursue a film role, and Shirley Jones and David Cassidy declined to reprise their roles as the family’s mother and oldest son. No surprise, music played a big part in the cartoon just as it did in the original series; in every episode, the family used Space Age versions of their instruments to play upbeat songs like “Gypsy Girl” and “Take Good Care of Her.” Sadly, the good vibes didn’t help the show; a ratings disappointment, it was cancelled mid-season — a rarity for a Saturday morning show — and only returned for a year of reruns as part of the 1977 anthology series Fred Flintstone and Friends before disappearing into the cosmos.\n\n5. The Oddball Couple (1975)\n\nThe sitcom’s opening credits set up the premise: “On November 13, Felix Unger was asked to remove himself from his place of residence. That request came from his wife. Deep down, he knew she was right. But he also knew that, someday, he would return to her. With nowhere else to go, he appeared at the home of his childhood friend, Oscar Madison. Sometime earlier, Madison’s wife had thrown him out, requesting that he never return. Can two divorced men share an apartment without driving each other crazy?” Now what if those two divorced men were a dog and a cat? Debuting the same year that its live-action inspiration left the airwaves after five seasons, The Oddball Couple depicted Spiffy the cat as “fussy, very proper, and clean” and Fleabag the dog as the messy, inconsiderate one. Their disparate personalities are even reflected in their house (which is half mansion and half dilapidated shack) and car (half pristine and half junker). For no apparent reason, the cartoon switched up the characters’ occupations; where Tony Randall played a photographer and Jack Klugman played a sports writer, Spiffy is the writer and Fleabag the photographer in their show. That’s about the most interesting thing there is to say about the cartoon, which saw 16 episodes rerun over two seasons before calling it quits.\n\n6-7. The New Adventures of Gilligan (1974)/Gilligan’s Planet (1982)\n\n“Just sit right back and you’ll hear a tale/A tale of a fateful trip/That started from this tropic port/\n\nAboard this tiny ship…” That sound you just heard was millions of Baby Boomers and Gen Xers raised on reruns singing “a three-hour tour, a three-hour tour…” in perfect harmony. It doesn’t take much effort to imagine the original Gilligan’s Island as a cartoon, which is probably why that’s exactly what happened with The New Adventures of Gilligan, which debuted seven years after the live-action show left the air. ABC’s New Adventures continued where the original series left off, putting the wacky castaways through their comedic paces as they tried (and failed) to get off their “uncharted desert isle”; as a way of inserting a little education into the proceedings, the show’s writers had Skipper and Gilligan end each episode talking about the lessons learned that day. A few years later, CBS upped the ante with Gilligan’s Planet, a cartoon that saw the castaways finally get off that island thanks to the professor’s homemade rocket ship — only to get lost in space and end up marooned on an alien planet. And because no Filmation property is complete without a cute sidekick for comedy relief, New Adventures had Stubby the monkey while Gilligan’s Planet offered up Bumper the unintelligible alien. All the original cast except Tina Louise (Ginger) came back to voice their characters, presumably to distance herself from the role; if so, that might be why the animated Ginger’s hair is platinum blonde instead of the red tresses that Louise sported on the live-action show.\n\n8. The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang (1980)\n\nFew sitcoms rise to the level of American institution; Happy Days was one of them. A moderate success when it debuted on ABC in 1974, falling ratings in its second season led to a few tweaks in the format, the biggest being the promotion of former bit player Arthur “the Fonz” Fonzarelli to center stage. While the show about middle-class life in 1950s Milwaukee veered more towards fantasy and broad comedy as the years went on (Google “jump the shark” to see what I mean), it’s not like Fonzie and the gang ever did something completely ridiculous, like hop in a time machine and hang out with Blackbeard the pirate. No, they saved that for The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, which saw Fonzie, Richie, and Ralph join a girl from the future named Cupcake on time-spanning adventures in a malfunctioning time machine shaped like a flying saucer. (The less said about “Mr. Cool,” the better.) A total of 24 episodes were produced, with the gang traveling everywhere from the Stone Age to the Old West to 2057, exactly 100 years after the start of the show was set. To the cartoon’s credit, it didn’t just hit the usual hot spots in history, exposing young viewers to a few lesser-visited times and places like 12th-century Timbuktu and China’s Ming Dynasty — serving up a little education alongside the usual Scooby Doo-esque antics that were a hallmark of Hanna-Barbera shows at the time.\n\n9. Laverne & Shirley in the Army (1981)\n\nWhile The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang was based on a far-fetched premise, one thing that lent an air of realism to the project was Henry Winkler, Ron Howard, and Don Most reprising their roles from the original show. Along that same vein, Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams voiced their own animated incarnations in Laverne & Shirley in the Army, a spinoff of their own top-rated sitcom that was very loosely based on the 1979 episode “We’re in the Army Now.” I’ve never seen that episode from the fifth season of Laverne & Shirley, but I’m going to assume the live-action roommates and brewery co-workers never once encountered aliens, werewolves, or Bigfoot during their time in basic training. (Also a safe assumption? That at no point in the live-action series are the ladies bossed around by a talking pig in a sergeant’s uniform who’s voiced by Ron Palillo aka Horshack from Welcome Back, Kotter. “Surreal” doesn’t even begin.) After the first season of 13 episodes wrapped up, the show returned as Laverne & Shirley with The Fonz after Fonzie and Mr. Cool were brought over from their own show to work in the army camp’s motor pool as mechanics — just in time to help the girls tangle with swamp monsters and renegade robots. You know, like our real soldiers do all the time.\n\n10. Mork & Mindy (1982)\n\nOn September 25, 1982, ABC added a third sitcom adaptation to its Saturday morning line-up with the Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour. While Laverne & Shirley with The Fonz took up the second half of the hour, the first was anchored by an animated version of Mork & Mindy, the wildly popular alien-out-of-water sitcom that introduced Robin Williams’ brand of madcap humor to the TV-watching masses. Williams and co-star Pam Dawber voiced the title characters in the animated show, which stood out next to the ones based on Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley by hewing pretty close to its source material. Mork is still an alien on Earth who gets into crazy adventures that often arise from his misunderstanding of Earth culture; the only significant changes the animators made were de-aging Mork so he could go to high school, Mindy’s new job as a newspaper reporter, and giving Mork an alien pet, a pink, six-legged dog-like creature named Doing. Another way in which the animated Mork & Mindy was different from the other two cartoons it shared a time slot with is timing; both Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley were still on the air in 1982 (Laverne & Shirley would sign off in 1983 and Happy Days the following year), while the live-action Mork & Mindy said “nanu nanu” to viewers five months before its animated counterpart debuted. Whether that had an impact on the cartoon’s viewership is hard to say; either way, it ran for 26 episodes before packing it in and heading back to Ork in the spring of 1983.\n\n11. The Dukes (1983)\n\nSome fans of the show might bristle at calling The Dukes of Hazzard a sitcom, but let’s be honest — those Duke boys weren’t starring in “very special episodes” examining the complex issues affecting America’s rural counties. Running from 1979 to 1985, the show about a pair of “good ole boys” finding adventure and fighting local corruption in Georgia’s fictional Hazzard County was a consistent ratings winner for most of its run, appealing to young and old alike with its car chases, broad comedy, and a certain pair of cut-off jean shorts that are literally in the Smithsonian next to Fonzie’s jacket and Archie Bunker’s chair. No doubt it was the younger fans buying Dukes of Hazzard lunchboxes that Hanna-Barbera had in mind when it produced The Dukes for CBS’s Saturday morning line-up. The series features the Duke boys (Coy and Vance in the first season, Bo and Luke in the second; it’s a long story) and Daisy in a round-the-world car race against Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, with Coltrane’s pet Flash along for the ride as the requisite dog sidekick. Every week, the Dukes would travel to India, Scotland, the Arctic, or wherever the script took them to find adventure along the way, while Boss Hogg hatched all kinds of schemes to sabotage his racing rivals. Honestly, considering how out-there some of those episodes of The Dukes of Hazzard got, having the boys and Daisy wrangle with pirates and leprechauns was par for the course. Number of episodes before the animated General Lee jumped its last open drawbridge: 20. “Yeee-haw!”\n\n12. It’s Punky Brewster (1985)\n\nIn the fall of 1984, NBC tried competing against CBS’s top-rated 60 Minutes news show with some counter-programming designed to capture young viewers who might not be fans of investigative journalism or Andy Rooney’s musings on life. Joining the younger-skewing sitcom Silver Spoons on Sunday nights was Punky Brewster, a heart-tugging show about a young girl who’s taken in by an elderly man after she’s abandoned by her parents. Never a ratings hit, it did well enough among younger viewers to last four seasons (two with NBC, two in syndication) and inspire Ruby-Spears’ It’s Punky Brewster, an animated spin-off that debuted as part of NBC’s Saturday morning line-up in 1985. Soleil Moon-Frye and the rest of the cast reprised their roles on the animated series, which had a similar set-up to the live-action show with the notable exception of Glomer (voiced by Frank Welker), a magical rodent-like creature whose spells got Punky and her friends into all kinds of wacky adventures; typical plots ranged from Punky opening a detective agency to Glomer pulling a Big on Punky when she wishes she were a full-grown adult. Twenty-six episodes were produced and put in rotation until 1989, a year after the real-life Punky and friends called it quits; it can be safely assumed that many heartwarming lessons were learned along the way.\n\n13-14. ALF (1987)/ALF Tales (1988)\n\nSomeday in the future, a historian specializing in 20th-century American pop culture is going to write the definitive thesis that answers the burning question: How? How did an anodyne sitcom about a short, sarcastic, cat-eating alien living with a middle-class family in suburban California not only get a pilot but air on NBC for four seasons and launch a mini-empire of ALF merchandise including plushies, puzzles, comic books, and the official ALF record with his hit single “Stuck on Earth”? While we file that one under “mystery for the ages,” let’s talk about the show’s two animated spinoffs, ALF (often called ALF: The Animated Series to differentiate from the original sitcom) and ALF Tales. The first, which aired for 26 episodes, followed ALF’s adventures on his native planet Melmac, back he was just plain Gordon Shumway; ALF Tales poked fun at traditional fairy tales, with ALF and his fellow Melmackians putting their own slapstick spin on Sleeping Beauty, The Three Little Pigs, and other well-known stories. (Fun fact: though his name was established as “Gordon Shumway” in the sitcom, he was called “ALF” by the family he lived with because it was short for “alien life form.” Why would someone as assertive and abrasive as him accept that moniker instead of insisting they use his actual Melmackian name? Something else to file under “mystery for the ages.”)\n\n14. Little Rosey (1990)\n\nThough not specifically based on 1988’s Roseanne starring Roseanne Barr and John Goodman as working-class parents, Little Rosey never would have existed without the sitcom that made Barr a comedy superstar of the 1990s. Eager to capitalize on their top-rated show’s massive popularity, ABC gave the green light to Little Rosey, a cartoon loosely based on Barr’s childhood. The Nelvana-produced series had Barr and then-husband Tom Arnold as executive producers, and Barr even introduced the show in a preview special that introduced ABC’s cartoon lineup that fall (though the voice of Little Rosey belonged to Canadian voice actor Kathleen Laskey). “She has a great imagination,” Barr said about Little Rosey during that special. “She doesn’t need toys with 50 or 60 parts to them because it’s all in her head. Whatever she wants to do, she can do. Whatever she wants to be, she can be.” Sadly, the one thing Little Rosey could not be was a star; ABC cancelled her show after 13 episodes. The network blamed poor ratings, but that might not have been the whole story; two years later, Barr and Arnold financed their own animated special, The Rosey and Buddy Show, that saw Rosey and her best pal travel to Cartoonland and fight a group of weasels in business suits who were trying to keep the two from the making the fun kind of show they wanted. Not exactly subtle satire, but then, “not subtle” was typically how Roseanne rolled.\n\n15. Mr. Bean (2002)\n\nIf there were ever a live-action comedy show destined to become a cartoon, it’s Mr. Bean, the British series starring Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling man-child who deals with everyday activities in his own pratfall-filled way. That emphasis on physical comedy, plus the fact that Mr. Bean rarely speaks in intelligible English, made Mr. Bean a global hit, with the show’s 15 episodes aired in a jaw-dropping 245 territories around the world. Along with two feature-length films (Bean and Mr. Bean’s Holiday), the show’s success also inspired an animated version of Mr. Bean with Atkinson reprising his role as the title character and providing physical references for all of his animated counterpart’s actions. While the animated series retains much of the comedy of the live-action show, it also introduced new characters alongside regulars from the original series (like Teddy and Irma Gobb), such as Mr. Bean’s unpleasant landlady Mrs. Wicket and her evil one-eyed cat, Scrapper. Running from 2002 to 2004, the first three series featured 52 episodes in total, each consisting of two 11-minute segments; the show was revived again in 2015 to run for four more years and 88 more episodes, with Atkinson and the other cast members reprising their roles in new episodes that featured more dialogue. (Why “Mr. Bean”? It wasn’t until shortly before Mr. Bean hit the airwaves that the character got his name. He was originally going to be called Mr. White, but then the show’s creators began throwing around vegetable names and considered Mr. Cauliflower before deciding on Mr. Bean. I like to think it’s the perfect fit in that every human “bean” can relate to his reactions to life’s little frustrations.)\n\n16. Corner Gas Animated (2018)\n\nBecause Canada’s TV industry is mostly geared to produce drama and action shows for outside markets (and because so many of our funny people tend to head south to Hollywood), the nation’s supply of homegrown sitcoms isn’t as large as you might expect. Happy exceptions are shows like King of Kensington, Schitt’s Creek, Kim’s Convenience… and Corner Gas, the 2004-2009 sitcom about life in the fictional town of Dog River, Saskatchewan. Series creator and star Brent Butt considered a career as a cartoonist before going into stand-up comedy, so there’s a good chance he leapt at the chance to turn himself and his castmates into animated characters for the show’s four-season revival as a cartoon in 2018. With the exception of Janet Wright, who played Butt’s TV mom in the original series and died in 2016, all the original Corner Gas actors came back to voice their animated selves in episodes that captured the original show’s tone and style (though they took advantage of the animated format to do scenes that would have been impractial for live action, like cutaway gags featuring Mad Max spoofs). When the show aired its final episode — with special guest star Ryan Reynolds(!) — in 2021, Butt was asked if it was the end of the line for Brent, Hank, Lacey, and the rest of the gang, or if maybe they would come back again in some other form. “I honestly can’t see it right now,” he said, “but I’ve learned long ago to never say never with this bunch of characters.”"
