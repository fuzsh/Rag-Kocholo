»Dearest, dearest Christa, how nice that you remain here on this daft planet!«, Sarah Kirsch writes in the autumn of 1988 to her friend who has just recovered from a life-threatening illness. One decade earlier, following a meeting in West Berlin just after Kirsch had left the GDR, Christa Wolf stated: »I am glad that I was with you and can now think of you calmly.«

The exchange of two authors of international stature over the course of almost three decades, from 1962 to 1990: about writing, about the literary scene in both East and West Germany, about the men, the children, working in the garden and the political systems in which they live. It’s probably the latter that brings the friendship to a close after many years of faithful companionship.

Strict and playful, cheerful and desperate, flippant and honest – looking over the shoulders of Sarah Kirsch and Christa Wolf as they write is truly a gift.

»I wish you all the best and a slight sardonic smile from now on and forever.« (Sarah Kirsch, 12.03.1990)

»Now we’re soon going to live in the same country again, isn’t that strange? I could easily leave now, but where to?« (Christa Wolf, 07.04.1990)

»A moving document of German poetry and German division.« Andreas Platthaus, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung

»Never before did we get this close to Christa Wolf’s poetics and aesthetics.« Helmut Böttiger, SZ Literary Supplement

»This commendably edited and commented correspondence between two great female writers showcases a memorable dynamics: The political, which dominates so greatly towards the beginning and that takes a back seat at times behind the familial, intimate, descriptive, eventually becomes the predetermined breaking point.« Richard Kämmerlings, Die Literarische Welt

»A literary event of the most extraordinary sadness.« Anja Maier, taz. die tageszeitung

»This correspondence is an impressive testament and seems to be pointing to something more general. Both are right in their own way, but their intense, moving friendship had to break.« Helmut Böttiger, Deutschlandfunk Kultur

» [...] Thus, in December 1990, ends the correspondence, which has been annotated exceptionally well and that not only talks about a growing and then failing friendship, but also about the history of literature in the GDR.« Ulrich Rüdenauer, MDR

»But the correspondence spanning the years between 1962 and 1992, now available in a meticulously edited and expertly commented edition, is more than the complex record of a personal exchange over the course of three decades. The letters are contemporary documents seen from a distance.« Carola Wiemers, Deutschlandfunk

»[The] unusual and prominent perspective that this correspondence offers should reignite one’s delight in examining East-West German history.« Roland Gutsch, Nordkurier

»The acute strength of these letters is not least founded in the fact that the tragedy of the German division is focused as though through a lens here.« Volker Strebel, literaturkritik.de
