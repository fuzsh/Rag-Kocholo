        "text": "''Heinrich Heine once said that the Jews had made a portable fatherland out of the Bible,'' remarked Marcel Reich-Ranicki, his elbows hovering just over his knees as he leaned forward on the edge of the couch to make a point. ''I have made a portable fatherland out of German literature.''\n\nThe man widely regarded as the most influential critic of contemporary German poetry and fiction chortled infectiously, as he sometimes does when talking about utterly serious matters, and made a poignant joke: ''I would not like to have to carry it any further - this portable fatherland of mine. I hope that we will be able to continue to live in peace and quiet in this country.''\n\nOn the post-Hitler literary landscape, Mr. Reich-Ranicki is a singular feature, a talisman and a sturdy signpost, a reminder that German poets, novelists and critics once had constituencies running from Warsaw through Budapest and Prague to Berlin, Vienna and Zurich.\n\nBorn in Poland, the 63-year-old editor of the much-feared literary section of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is today, aptly, a defender of the idea of the unity of Germany letters - whether written in East Germany, West Germany, Switzerland or Austria. The empire of German literature has shrunk in the east, but, he says, it has not been shattered by ideology. Resistance Organizer in Warsaw\n\nIn conversation, Mr. Reich-Ranicki likes to dispose of his biography rapidly, as if it were incidental to the matter at hand. Born in Wloclawek in 1921 to Jewish parents, a Polish- speaking father and German-speaking mother; educated in Berlin until 1938, when the Nazis deported him to Poland; resistance organizer in the Warsaw ghetto, which he fled in 1943 with Teofila Langnas, now his wife.\n\nThen quickly: Lived underground for the rest of the war. Joined the Polish Communist Party in 1946, served as the Polish consulate in London and, in 1949, was thrown out of the party because of ''ideological estrangement.'' ''They were right,'' he remarked dryly, adding: ''Please don't write a hero story about me.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
