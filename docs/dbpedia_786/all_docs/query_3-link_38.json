        "text": "THE POTSDAMER PLATZ IS as much a suggestion as an actual place. A convergence of streets in the center of Berlin, it has played a symbolic role in the life of the city from the time it served as the official gate of entry for Prussian royalty returning from the residence at Sans Souci to the time of its conspicuous disappearance under the Berlin wall. It occupies a few blocks by American standards, something I could walk across, if I chose not to stop, in about 15 minutes, but its emptiness is deceiving. The Potsdamer Platz has become the traffic hub of the reunified city, of what one wants to call Helmut Kohl's Berlin, as it was the hub of Kaiser Wilhelm's Berlin and of Adolf Hitler's Berlin (though Albert Speer, in his plans to remake the city, would have diminished it); it is the planned site of a huge urban development project -- of hundreds of offices and apartments, of shopping centers and theaters and hotels. It is a far-off memory and a blueprint for the future, a traffic jam and a code word, Berlin-as-boomtown and Berlin-as-ghost town, a place as vague and complicated and unavoidable as Germany itself.\n\nWithout the wall, the Potsdamer Platz is once again countryside, a stretch of Brandenburg landscape. It is flat and sandy, only dramatic during a rainstorm; deep, deep green in summer, and as gray as the overcast skies in winter, spring and fall. Its soil is undoubtedly poor, like the rest of the famously poor soil of Brandenburg, where a tradition of impoverishment, of real hunger, didn't end until Frederick the Great introduced the potato. The area could in fact be a spot of land along the Havel River, outside one of those towns named by the Slavs who lived there before the Germans came -- except for the price of its real estate, which is expected to climb as high as that of any place on earth.\n\nThe Potsdamer Platz was Europe's busiest intersection before World War II reduced it to rubble, the \"Times Square of Europe,\" the hero of Walter Ruttman's 1927 montage extravaganza \"Berlin: The Symphony of a Great City.\" In fact, the words \"Potsdamer Platz\" mean, as much as they mean anything, the Berlin of the 1920's, the Berlin of crowded restaurants, of businessmen wearing hats and carrying valises, of theatergoers rushing to a premiere of a new Max Reinhardt production or chatting about Moholy-Nagy's sets for \"The Tales of Hoffman\" at the Kroll Opera House, of Jewish theater critics writing for all the important newspapers, of orchestras in the afternoon filling up hotel lobbies with hits from \"The Threepenny Opera.\" In those days its leading tourist attraction was the cupola-topped complex of restaurants known as Kempinski's Haus Vaterland (Aryanized to Haus Vaterland after the Nazis came to power) and its culinary incarnations of Germany's various regions, like its Hamburg sailors' pub or its Rhineland restaurant overlooking an artificial Rhine. Later, while the wall was up, tourists came to the Potsdamer Platz, or rather to its western edge, to climb to the top of a platform and stare past the walls -- there were two -- and the guards and the barbed wire into \"The Republic of Farmers and Workers\" on the other side.\n\nThese days, the Potsdamer Platz is almost always taken to include the Leipziger Platz, the octagonal-shaped end of the Leipziger Strasse, which leads east to what was once the center of the old city. When I myself say \"Potsdamer Platz,\" I probably mean the part of town served by the Potsdamer Platz station -- any place from Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse (its name, which honors the first prime minister of the German Democratic Republic, is currently under review) to the Potsdamer Bridge. I mean the East German \"town houses\" on the Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse, vaguely stuccoed apartment blocks built in the middle 1980's for those who had permission to live near the wall -- people an East German tour guide once described to me as \"athletes, artists, the party elite and ordinary people,\" people whom an East Berlin friend of mine would describe as Stasi, those who had worked for the secret police. I mean what was once Goering's Air Ministry building on the Leipziger Strasse, which was called the House of Ministries under the G.D.R. and now houses the mysterious Treuhandanstalt, the Government agency that is busy privatizing East Germany's economy. I mean the Potsdamer Platz station itself. In its newly opened rawness, with its stripped walls and the restored bits of tile and lettering from when it was last remodeled in 1939, it forms a center for the Potsdamer Platz, or rather for the empty corporate fiefdoms into which it has been divided (the city calls the corporations \"investors\"; Berliners say \"Daimler-Benz and Sony\"). Just beyond the station is the cluster of museums and concert halls and libraries that the city of West Berlin decided to pile up in the shadow of the wall, and eventually began to call a Kulturforum -- among them Mies van der Rohe's glass-house National Gallery as well as Hans Scharoun's Philharmonic Hall, with its broken-wing roof line, and his State Library with its angled skylights. (Scharoun's buildings are interesting because, in spite of their complexity -- even people who like them will describe them as alienating -- they are popular places, well used; audiences revere the acoustically perfect Philharmonic, at least from the inside, while the State Library is part library, part tourist attraction and, on winter afternoons, a place to hang out.) And finally I mean the Potsdamer Bridge, which lives on in Berlin folklore as the place where the bodies of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were fished out of the Landwehr Canal in 1919 after the failed Spartakist uprising.\n\nBerliners have become generous with the name Potsdamer Platz, and any business between, say, the Brandenburg Gate and the ruin of the Anhalter train station can advertise itself as being near the Potsdamer Platz, and no one minds. The teen-agers from Hamburg who rolled down their car windows one evening to ask where the Potsdamer Platz was (\"Right here,\" I said, \"where I'm standing\") were looking for Berlin's new night life, part of which is to be found -- and most of which is said to be found -- in the neighborhood. They were probably looking for Tresor, a discotheque that had been getting a lot of press. Tresor is installed in the few remnants of the old Wertheim department store on the Leipziger Strasse; its dance floor is in the underground vaults where they used to keep the reichsmarks. Tresor plays \"techno\" music, one of Berlin's contributions to the German scene. Another discotheque near the Potsdamer Platz is in a renovated prewar public lavatory and plays reggae music. People sometimes say that the lavatory was a bunker, and that the bunker was connected to Hitler's bunker, the remains of which are just across the street; people also sometimes say that Tresor is in the old vault of the Reichsbank, which was farther to the east behind Friedrichstrasse. (Rumors are important in Berlin, which is a post-information-age city, a place where it is often easier to buy a satellite dish or book a flight to the Maldives than to get a telephone installed.)\n\nIn the daytime the Potsdamer Platz is the place in Berlin to go bungee jumping (for about $70, off a crane used in rebuilding the train station). On weekends, when the traffic has died down, it is a place to have a picnic, or ride a bicycle and avoid the rabbit droppings. (Even while the wall was up, the Potsdamer Platz was famously infested with rabbits; Sarah Kirsch, an East German poet who was thrown out of East Germany, wrote a poem in which she calls the rabbits \"weltstadtisch,\" metropolitan.) The weekend flea market is set in a sandlot in the shadow of the State Library, where wooden tables are covered with small mountains of used clothes and men wearing two or three used neckties for identification stand in the midst of their merchandise to take in the cash. In a city famous for flea markets, this is the cheapest, so cheap that the Vietnamese peddlers, former East German guest workers who sell contraband cigarettes at most of the public places in Berlin, leave the cigarette trade here to the Angolans. At the more expensive flea markets in the city, like the one near the Tiergarten, women in tinted mink coats buy Art Deco cigarette lighters and Jugendstil light fixtures, and students shop for discounted CD's and used books and tourists -- like the tourists at the Brandenburg Gate -- buy East German transit police uniforms and Warsaw Pact compasses and wristwatches and pocket knives and Russian families try to sell \"medieval\" icons for 1,500 German marks (about $1,000) and Turks sell authenticated pieces of the Berlin wall or pieces of the wall made into earrings or paperweights.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
