        "text": "I INTRODUCTION\n\nGerman Literature, literature written in the German language from the 8th century to the present, and including the works of German, Austrian, and Swiss authors. It may be divided into periods corresponding generally to successive phases in the development of the German language and to the growth and unification of Germany as a nation. See also Austrian Literature; Switzerland: Literature.\n\nII OLD HIGH GERMAN PERIOD (800-1100)\n\nThe oldest known literary work in German is the epic Hildebrandslied (Lay of Hildebrand), which survives in a fragment dating from about ad 800. This work describes, in mixed Low and High German alliterative verse, the confrontation and the beginning of a battle between the legendary hero Hildebrand and his son. Other legends deal with such heroic personalities as Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; Attila, king of the Huns; and Siegfried, identified by some authorities as the German chief Arminius, who defeated the Romans in the Teutoburger Wald, a forest in Lower Saxony in ad 9. This pagan tradition was disowned by the Roman Catholic Church, which remained the dominant force in German literature from the 4th to the 12th century.\n\nAs early as 381 Ulfilas, bishop of the Goths, translated the Bible into the vernacular, and an anonymous priest wrote Muspilli (900; trans. 1885), an alliterative poem in Bavarian dialect depicting the destruction of the world by fire on Judgement Day. Another important work, written in the old Low German dialect, is the epic Heliand (9th century; trans. 1830), in which Christ is represented as a German prince with feudal retainers as his disciples. Under the Frankish ruler Charles Martel and his successors, many abbeys were founded, among them the famous St Gallen (now in Switzerland) and Fulda in Germany.\n\nIn these abbeys the monks preserved ancient literature as well as the history of their own time. During this period, however, the major literary works were written in Latin, with German being used primarily in translations from the older language. An example of an epic written in Latin is the Walthariuslied (c. 930; Lay of Walter, 1858) by Ekkehard I the Elder of St Gallen, which tells of the escape of the hero Walter and his bride from the court of Attila. In addition to such epics, written for the royal courts, a popular oral literature developed during the 9th and 10th centuries. It consisted largely of tales and ballads, which were not written down until about the 14th century.\n\nIII MIDDLE HIGH GERMAN PERIOD (1100-1370)\n\nAlthough prose writing and drama were found primarily in the form of didactic religious works throughout the Middle High German period, poetry developed as a mode of secular expression, and epic, lyric, and satiric forms appeared, giving voice to the virtues of chivalry and courtly love. The Spielleute, or wandering minstrels, entertained their listeners with stories of adventure sometimes based on the experiences of warriors returning from the Crusades. Among the epic poems of the period, König Rother (King Rother, c. 1150) had the greatest success. Another important style was the court epic, which reached its highest form in the works of Hartmann von Aue (c. 1170-c. 1235), Gottfried von Strassburg, Wolfram von Eschenbach, and Heinrich von Veldeke. Although the works of such French writers as Chrétien de Troyes and others served as models for the German epics, the German writers expressed their own ideals, found their own form and style, and very often added depth to the stories.\n\nA variation of the court epic was the epic in which an animal was the central figure. Reineke Fuchs (c. 1180; Reynard the Fox, 1840) by Heinrich der Glîchezaere is the best example. The greatest of the German epics are Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival, Tristan und Isold by Gottfried von Strassburg, and the Nibelungenlied, set down in the early 13th century by an unknown author. Lyric poetry during the Middle High German period developed in the form of the Minnesang, or courtly lyric, composed by the lyric poets known as minnesingers. The great master of this type of poetry is Walther von der Vogelweide. His works, which include love songs, religious lyrics, and epigrams, express personal and political idealism and assert his independence of papal authority. In the second half of the 13th century the nature of the epic began to change as characters from the middle class and the peasantry were introduced. The peasantry, once an object of derision, became increasingly important in literature, figuring prominently in such works as Meier Helmbrecht, a 13th-century tale of peasant life.\n\nIV THE REFORMATION (1500-1700)\n\nThe rise of the middle class in the 14th and 15th centuries and the struggles of the peasants against the nobility culminated in the great 16th-century religious revolution known as the Reformation. This movement was reflected in literature, especially by Martin Luther, whose translation of the Bible established New High German as the literary language of Germany. In secular literature the aristocratic Minnesang was discarded in favour of the Meistergesang (“master song”), written by guilds of artisans known as Meistersinger.\n\nAlso popular were the simple lyric poems later collectively titled Volkslied (“folk songs”; see Folk Music). The Schwank, a farcical form of comic anecdote, gave popular expression to the stories of such sly rogues as Till Eulenspiegel. In the famous Das Narrenschiff (1494; The Ship of Fools, 1509) the humanist poet Sebastian Brant satirized more than 100 contemporary forms of foolishness and immorality. Another successful author was Johann Fischart, a satiric poet and polemical writer for the Protestant cause, who based his material on the adventures of Gargantua and Pantagruel, characters created by the French satirist François Rabelais.\n\nThis period marked the first appearance in literature of the legendary scholar Johann Faust in the anonymous prose fiction Historia von Dr. Johann Fausten, published in 1587. Late in the 15th century German drama, hitherto restricted to passion plays and other religious spectacles, began to take on secular form in the Fastnachtsspiele (“Shrovetide plays”), allegorical comic dramas performed during the carnival season. Worldly elements gradually penetrated even the religious Christmas and Easter plays. Among the important dramatists of the Reformation period were Burkard Waldis, who also wrote satiric fables, Nikodemus Frischlin, and Hans Sachs, a poet and dramatist who was noted for his Fastnachtsspiele. An attempt to bring French influences into German literature was made during the early 17th century by the critic Martin Opitz.\n\nIn his principal work, Das Buch von der Deutschen Poeterey (Book of German Poetry, 1624), Opitz demanded that German writers imitate contemporary French models in style, metre, and pattern. Although some of the literary academies carried his rules to extremes of complicated formality, several poets, influenced by Opitz, achieved an increased individuality of expression. Among them were Simon Dach; Paul Fleming; Johann Scheffler, commonly called Angelus Silesius; and Friedrich von Logau. Protestant poetry of the 17th century reached its height in the hymns of Paul Gerhardt. The development of German literature was halted for more than a generation by the Thirty Years’ War. The effects of the conflict can be seen in the work of the novelist Hans Jakob Christoph von Grimmelshausen. His tale of a disillusioned farmer’s son, Der Abenteuerliche Simplicissimus (1669; The Adventurous Simplicissimus, 1912), is the first great novel in the German language. Such comedies as Herr Peter Squentz (1663) by the playwright and poet Andreas Gryphius also convey the disillusionment, and the overwhelming sense of the transience of human life and experience, that inevitably followed the war.\n\nV 18TH CENTURY\n\nBy the beginning of the 18th century German cultural life had become increasingly receptive to new literary models and ideas. Such novels as Robinson Crusoe by the English novelist Daniel Defoe were widely read in Germany, leading to the decline of the heroic narrative and to greater realism in German fiction. A notable critic of the period was Johann Christoph Gottsched, whose Versuch einer Critischen Dichtkunst vor die Deutschen (Essay on a Critical Theory of Poetry for the Germans, 1730) established standards derived from the logic and precision of French literature. Gottsched also attempted to reform the drama, both as a literary arbiter and as a translator of French, Greek, and Latin plays. His literary influence, however, was challenged by a group of young writers who wished to liberate German literature from the restrictive influence of foreign models. Stimulated by the nationalism of Frederick the Great, but influenced also by his extensive cultural interests, these writers led one of the greatest periods in German literature. Among the successive phases of this era were the pre-classical period (1748-1788), the Sturm und Drang (“storm and stress”) movement (beginning c. 1770), and the classical (1787-c. 1805) and Romantic (1798-1832) periods.\n\nA Pre-Classical\n\nPeriod Christian Fürchtegott Gellert, an early writer of the pre-classical period, enjoyed great popularity with his didactic fables, poems, novels, and comedies. Of greater importance, however, was the poet and dramatist Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. In his religious epic Messias (4 vols., 1751-1773; The Messiah, 1810) and in his collection of odes he introduced strong personal emotion into German poetry. Even more important, Klopstock’s conception of the holy mission of the poet profoundly influenced subsequent writers. Christoph Martin Wieland, author of the epic Oberon (1780; trans. 1798), also affected the course of German literature by translating Shakespeare’s plays into German. Wieland’s Agathon (1766-1777; The History of Agathon, 1773) is considered the earliest psychological novel in German literature. The dramas of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, notable for their characters and passion, formed the foundation of modern German drama. He gave the German stage its first tragedy of everyday life (bürgerliches Trauerspiel) in Miss Sara Sampson (1755; trans. 1789), and in his dramatic poem Nathan der Weise (1779; Nathan the Wise, 1781) he made an ardent appeal for religious tolerance.\n\nMinna von Barnhelm (1767; The Disbanded Officer, 1786) is a skilful comedy. In his influential critical treatise Laokoon (1766; trans. 1930), Lessing brought the spirit of the Enlightenment to Germany (see Enlightenment, Age of). Above all he was an enthusiastic advocate of Shakespeare, urging in a series of critical essays that German writers should turn from slavish imitation of French classicism, as Gottsched had prescribed, towards the freedom and diversity of the English model. In this way he helped prepare the ground for the unrestrained outpouring of creativity known as Sturm und Drang.\n\nB Sturm und Drang\n\nThe philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder was the dominant figure of this new movement, which took its name from the play Sturm und Drang (1776) by Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger, one of a group of young writers who were delighted by Herder’s rejection of traditional authorities. The members of this group abandoned rationalism and the concern with form and structure that had characterized classical and French drama. Influenced by Herder’s study of primitive peoples and folk culture, they emphasized the use of national or folk elements, and sought inspiration in the Volkslied and other aspects of German culture.\n\nTheir longing for emancipation was symbolized in poems and dramas centring on heroic individualists possessed by uncontrolled emotions and engaged in immense conflicts. J. M. R. Lenz, in his play Die Soldaten (1776; The Soldiers, 1972), combined the energy of Sturm und Drang with an acute eye for social realism, but the movement received its most powerful expression in the early dramas of two of Germany’s greatest authors, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller. Goethe’s early play Götz von Berlichingen (1773; trans. 1799), greatly influenced by Shakespeare’s dramas, concerns a 16th-century knight, opposed to the aristocracy and the Church, who leads a revolt of the peasants. Introspective melancholy, another feature of Sturm und Drang, is clearly shown in Goethe’s novel Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers (1774; The Sorrows of Young Werther, 1779). The sentimental hero, disappointed in love, kills himself; hundreds of young male readers are said to have followed Werther’s example. Goethe’s most important work of this period is the so-called Urfaust, the oldest preserved version of his long poetic drama Faust (2 vols., 1808-1832; trans. 1834), completed in the last years of the poet’s life. Schiller, in his Die Räuber (1781; The Robbers, 1800) and Kabale und Liebe (1783; Intrigue and Love, 1849), emphasized the political aspects of Sturm und Drang, attacking political tyranny and social corruption.\n\nC Classical Period\n\nThe development of Goethe and Schiller, after the period of their early dramas, represents one of the major achievements of the classical period in German literature—an era notable for its emotional restraint, temperance of thought, and lucidity of expression. Both writers were influenced by the extensive philosophical activity of the period, which culminated in the idealism of the philosopher Immanuel Kant and his disciple Johann Gottlieb Fichte. During the classical period, moreover, Goethe and Schiller became close friends, despite differences in their philosophical attitudes. Schiller believed in absolute ethical ideals, which provide the motive force of his greatest dramatic works: the Wallenstein trilogy (1798-1799; trans. 1839), Maria Stuart (1800; trans. 1833), Die Jungfrau von Orleans (1801; The Maid of Orleans, 1835), and Wilhelm Tell (1804; William Tell, 1825).\n\nGoethe derived his philosophy from his experiences as lyric poet, balladeer, dramatist, novelist, essayist, scientist, and political figure. He lived according to the ideal expressed in Faust: never to be satisfied with what one is, but to strive incessantly to learn, to improve, to accomplish. His writings clearly show his development from youthful rebellion to the search for emotional restraint, objectivity, beauty, and the ideal human personality. The two parts of Faust, moreover, have often been considered representative of the prevailing tendencies of German literature; the first part contains many elements of the literary movement known as Romanticism, and the second represents the classicism most admired by Goethe. These elements may also be found in the work of the poet Friedrich Hölderlin, whose admiration for the harmony of the Classical world was vitiated, as Goethe and his contemporaries saw it, by his visionary religious attitude. Hölderlin himself explored the conflict between absolute ideals and the problems of existence in his epistolary novel Hyperion (2 vols, 1797-1799; trans. 1927) and in his poetry. Another highly individualistic writer of the late classical period, the dramatist and short-story writer Heinrich von Kleist, portrayed heroic characters in conflict with their destiny. His comedies Der Zerbrochene Krug (1806, pub. about 1811; The Broken Pitcher, 1961) and Amphitryon (1807; trans. 1962) depict human conflict in an almost tragic manner. The tales of the humorist Johann Friedrich Richter (usually known by the pseudonym Jean Paul), with their fantasy and their sense of the grotesque, bring him close to the Romantic movement, which dominated German literature at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nD Romantic Period\n\nThe increasing Romantic tendency of German literature, as expressed, for example, in some of the later writings of Goethe, became dominant in 1798, with the first issue of the journal Das Athenäum, edited by three friends, the writer Ludwig Tieck and the critics August Wilhelm von Schlegel and Friedrich von Schlegel. Romanticism in the literature of Germany, as in that of other countries, resulted from a fusion of political, philosophical, and artistic elements. The Napoleonic Wars awakened a new sense of national identity in German writers, while increasing their admiration for such heroic individuals as Napoleon and Ludwig van Beethoven. The nationalistic elements of Romanticism were furthered in Germany by the philosopher and theologian Friedrich Ernst Daniel Schleiermacher, who stressed the virtues of national independence and influenced such poets as Ernst Moritz Arndt and Karl Theodor Körner.\n\nThe work of the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling gave the movement a philosophical base for its mysticism and belief in the ultimate oneness of the natural and spiritual world. Folk tales and mythology, another concern of German Romanticism, received attention in the collections made by two scholars, the Grimm brothers, Jacob Ludwig Karl and Wilhelm Karl. A notable collection of German folk songs was formed by the poet and dramatist Clemens Maria Brentano and his brother-in-law Achim von Arnim, Des Knaben Wunderhorn (3 vols., 1805-1808; The Boy’s Magic Horn, 1841). And not the least of Romanticism’s contributions to German literature were the translations by Schlegel of 17 of Shakespeare’s plays, in superb renderings that have become part of Germany’s own literary heritage. Romantic themes characterize the work of the poet Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg, known as Novalis, author of the mysterious and deeply religious Hymnen an die Nacht (1800; Hymns to the Night, 1889) and of the novel Heinrich von Ofterdingen (1802; trans. 1842). Ludwig Tieck, poet, dramatist, and novelist, lacked the depth and religious feeling of Novalis, but was extremely eloquent, gifted in the expression of poetic, fantastic, and satirical elements.\n\nJoseph von Eichendorff praised the beauty of nature in his poems and the virtues of idleness in his prose work Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts (1826; The Love Frolics of a Young Scamp, 1864). The genuine tenderness of folk songs can be found in the poems of Adelbert von Chamisso, but many have tragic elements, as does his prose work, Peter Schlemihls Wundersame Geschichte (1814; Peter Schlemihl’s Remarkable Story, 1927). The great balladeer of this generation was Ludwig Uhland. One of the masters of poetry and prose was Eduard Friedrich Mörike; the calm composure in his writing contrasted with the melancholy in the poetry of Nikolaus Lenau. Most of the Romantic poets were also gifted storytellers, but the most original prose writer of this period was E. T. A. Hoffmann, the master of tales dealing with the supernatural.\n\nVI REVOLUTION AND REACTION (1832-1871)\n\nDuring the 1830s a new generation of writers turned from the fantasy of Romanticism towards participation in political events. Forming a movement known as Junges Deutschland (Young Germany), they supported the attempts of liberal elements in various parts of Germany to modify the absolute rule of the surviving feudal princes. The major philosopher of this period was G. W. F. Hegel, whose rationalistic idealism and dialectical method were later to have such a profound effect upon Karl Marx. Also influenced by him was the lyrical poet and critic Heinrich Heine. A dominant figure among the new writers, Heine began his career with ironic poems on Romantic themes and became famous with the publication of his Buch der Lieder (1827; Book of Songs, 1846). After the failure of the revolution of 1830, he fled to Paris, where he wrote his most important poetry and produced many critical articles on contemporary art and politics.\n\nA perceptive observer, Heine anticipated many of the techniques of modern journalism. Another political exile, Ludwig Börne, attempted to invigorate German political activity in his Briefe aus Paris (Letters from Paris, 1830-1833). A 19th-Century Drama Political ideas dominated the German drama of the 19th century. In addition to Kleist, Christian Dietrich Grabbe and other writers produced significant plays. Most important, however, was the revolutionary dramatist Georg Büchner, a pioneer in psychological realism whose works continue to be widely performed. His Dantons Tod (1835; Danton’s Death, 1927) explores the sense of futility and apathy that affected the French revolutionary leader Georges Jacques Danton at the close of his life. In Woyzeck (1836; trans. 1927)—well known in the modern operatic version by the Austrian composer Alban Berg—Büchner depicts the tragic disintegration of a poor soldier victimized by an unjust and cruel society. The topic, style, and deep psychological insight of this play mark it as the beginning of modern German drama. Psychological realism and political perception also characterize the historical tragedies of Friedrich Hebbel and the poetic dramas of the Austrian playwright Franz Grillparzer. Ferdinand Raimund wrote comedies that took place in a world of fairy tales and magic happenings but which nevertheless reflected his deep melancholy. Entertaining satires were composed by Johann Nestroy; and Ludwig Anzengruber wrote plays of peasant life, anticipating, in his concern with social problems, the literary movement known as Naturalism.\n\nThe German theatre of the 19th century was profoundly influenced by the composer Richard Wagner. A participant in the unsuccessful revolution of 1848, Wagner produced numerous prose writings describing the importance of the drama in the development of civilization and calling for a union of the arts in a form he called the Gesamtkunstwerk (total art form). As a poet, he wrote the texts of his music dramas, celebrating the great traditions of German literature in such works as Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1867) and Parsifal (1882). Wagner in turn was influenced by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, whose darkly pessimistic thought may be considered typical of the defeatist temper that followed the political repression of 1848. Schopenhauer, in his principal work Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (1819; The World as Will and Idea, 1883), conceived of a fundamental active principle, the will, that operates as a driving force in all forms of existence and that, in human beings, causes inevitable dissatisfaction and suffering unless balanced by a sense of saintly resignation. This conception of a primal governing force in human behaviour was to have a significant influence on subsequent German literature and philosophy. B 19th-Century Prose The popular storytellers of the mid-19th century included the poet Baroness Annette Elisabeth von Droste-Hülshoff, known for her novella Die Judenbuche (1842; The Jew’s Beech, 1958).\n\nDetailed descriptions of nature characterize the writings of the Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter, whose best-known works are the novel Der Nachsommer (Indian Summer, 1857) and the collection of short stories, Bunte Steine (Multi-Coloured Stones, 1853). Another master of the novella form was the Swiss author Gottfried Keller, whose collection Die Leute von Seldwyla (1856 and 1874; The People of Seldwyla, 1929) wittily captured the foibles of the inhabitants of a fictional Swiss town. Keller’s autobiographical novel Der Grüne Heinrich (4 vols., 1854-1855; Green Henry, 1960), continued the tradition of the Bildungsroman that began with Goethe’s Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (4 vols., 1795-1796; Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship, 1824). Rural life was portrayed by the Swiss writer Jeremias Gotthelf, best known for his novella Die Schwarze Spinne (1842; The Black Spider, 1958), while the novelist Wilhelm Raabe depicted the problems of the individual in an expanding society. Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, a poet and novelist, chose characters from the Middle Ages for many of his ballads and stories. The unity of human beings and nature forms a recurrent theme in the poetry and novellas of Theodor Storm. Immensee (1852; trans. 1863), one of his best-known stories, is a lyrical, nostalgic tale of childhood.\n\nHis later, darker style is shown in Der Schimmelreiter (1888; Rider of the White Horse, 1915), which shows the effect of the sea on the lives of shore dwellers. The most important novelist of the time was undoubtedly Theodor Fontane, whose novel of adultery, Effi Briest (1895; trans. 1967), vividly captured contemporary social mores through its realistic detail and strong characterization. The prevailing idealism of German philosophy was rejected in favour of materialism by Paul Johann Anselm von Feuerbach, whose work influenced the German revolutionaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Among the many scholars who furthered the development of the science of history during this period were Leopold von Ranke, considered a founder of the objective writing of history, Theodor Mommsen, an expert in Roman studies, and Jakob Burckhardt, noted for Kultur der Renaissance in Italien (1860; The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1878). The development of Germany as a nation was studied by Wilhelm Häring, who used the pseudonym Willibald Alexis, and by the ardent nationalist Heinrich von Treitschke.\n\nVII GERMAN NATIONALISM (1871-1945)\n\nAfter the unification of the German states in 1871, the revolutionary tendencies of German literature began increasingly to conflict with the militarism and economic materialism of the German middle class. Representing, in the main, the latter, the Prussian statesman and first chancellor of the German Empire, Prince Otto von Bismarck, expressed the prevailing view of contemporary society in his memoirs entitled Gedanken und Erinnerungen (1898; Bismarck: His Reflections and Reminiscences, 1898). A profoundly pessimistic cultural analysis, however, was advanced by the poet and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. In works such as Jenseits von Gut und Böse (1886; Beyond Good and Evil, 1907) and Wille zur Macht (1901; The Will to Power, 1967) he challenged the traditional religious values of bourgeois morality and the prevailing idealism of German philosophy.\n\nHis celebrated pronouncement that “God is dead” encapsulated the belief that any notion of higher meaning is a delusion created by those unable to bear the reality of human existence, life consisting instead of nothing more than the “will to power”, that energy which produces all human endeavour. In his later writings, notably in the prose poem Also Sprach Zarathustra (1883; Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1896), Nietzsche set forth the vision of a new type of creative individual who would himself embody the “will to power”, the Übermensch (superman), able to withstand the loss of transcendence and representing the heroic ideal to which humans should aspire. That this image was later taken up by the Nazis to justify their own racial doctrines may represent a crude misreading of Nietzsche, but it is testament also to the ambiguity of some of his conceptions. Nietzsche’s concern with the inner forces of the human personality profoundly influenced the course of early 20th-century thought. In psychology, Sigmund Freud and the Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung were greatly indebted to him for their theories of the human psyche. From Nietzsche’s idea of the cyclical recurrence of events, the philosopher of history Oswald Spengler formulated his principles of historical determinism. These developments in psychology and historical studies, when combined with Nietzsche’s conception of the artist as a radical critic of society, influenced the major literary movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Naturalism, Expressionism, and the epic theatre.\n\nA Naturalism\n\nThe naturalistic movement in literature occurred after the rise of Realism. Realism calls for an art reflecting both the good and the evil forces that affect human life. Naturalism, on the other hand, is a form of artistic determinism and depicts a bleak world in which people are trapped and doomed to defeat and disaster by uncontrollable forces. Symbols often used by Naturalist writers include sickness; insanity; senility; hypocrisy in religion, family relationships, and government; and the entrapping forces of economics, heredity, race, class, and environment. The artistic principles of the Naturalist movement were described by the critic and writer Arno Holz in his treatise Die Kunst (Art, 1891). Holz was also the co-author, with Johannes Schlaf, of three dramatic naturalistic stories under the collective title Papa Hamlet (1889). Certain elements of Naturalism, especially those dealing with the erotic aspects of life, appear in the dramas of the Austrian doctor and playwright Arthur Schnitzler.\n\nThe principal representative of Naturalism, however, was the dramatist Gerhart Hauptmann. In his play Vor Sonnenaufgang (1899; Before Dawn, 1909), he depicted human beings as victims of heredity and environment, doomed to hopeless struggles against forces beyond their control. This theme, and the manner of its presentation, anticipated many similar treatments in modern literature. A later Hauptmann play, Die Weber (1892; The Weavers, 1899), introduced the social group as hero of the drama. Hauptmann’s later writings represent a transition from Naturalism to the literary movement known as Impressionism, in which precise realism is replaced by a depiction of the impressions that objects make on the individual vision of the artist. Among other principal movements in the German literature of the early 20th century were Neo-Classicism (see Classical Style), Neo-Romanticism, Symbolism (see Symbolist Movement; Surrealism; Dada), and, most important, Expressionism, in which the emphasis on psychological problems became especially pronounced.\n\nB Expressionism\n\nOriginating in painting, Expressionism began to influence German literature in about 1910. A reaction to Naturalism and Impressionism, which were concerned primarily with the realistic representation of existence, the new movement had as its object the expression, or portrayal, of the inner feelings, experiences, and reactions of the artist or writer. The Expressionist writer embodied Nietzsche’s concept of the artist as a critic of traditional values. Like the painter, moreover, the poet or novelist was expected to portray the powerful forces within the human personality. Exaggerated emotional language and the depiction of abstract types rather than realistic characters became means to this end. The German playwright Frank Wedekind, a forerunner of Expressionism, employed a sense of grotesque humour to challenge social convention and contemporary sexual attitudes. Such forces as adolescent rebellion and amoral sexuality are portrayed in his plays Frühlings Erwachen (1891; Spring Awakening, 1909) and Die Büchse der Pandora (1904; Pandora’s Box, 1918).\n\nThe latter was the basis both for a film (1928) and for Lulu, an opera by the Austrian composer Alban Berg. The conflict of generations became for several Expressionist writers a symbol of the criticism of traditional values, as in Der Sohn (The Son, 1914) by Walter Hasenclever. Anti-war attitudes found expression after World War I in plays by Ernst Toller, Fritz von Unruh, and others. Georg Kaiser, in his immense dramatic production, was a specialist in epigrammatic dialogue, which suited the abstract, symbolic nature of his characters. However, Carl Zuckmayer, perhaps the most popular dramatist of his generation, shows very few traces of the Expressionist style, opting instead for conventional settings and vivid characterizations. Among his best-known works are the drama Der Hauptmann von Köpenick (1931; The Captain of Koepenick, 1932) and the script for Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel, 1930), a film for Josef von Sternberg. The Expressionist movement produced several poets of remarkable originality. Their central topic was the crisis of individual and collective values, as in the poems of Georg Trakl, filled with longing and loneliness; or of Georg Heym, who expressed despair over the misery and solitude of urban life. Franz Werfel, an Austrian writer, the greatest poet of Expressionism, wrote of his longing for harmony between people and nature.\n\nC Epic Theatre\n\nThe most original and stimulating dramatist of the modern period was Bertolt Brecht. He began as an Expressionist but soon developed his own style—epic theatre—using ballads, documentary techniques, and other innovations as commentary on the dramatic action. He unashamedly used the stage as a forum for political messages, his early didactic pieces advocating communist solutions to the problems of human society. His later, and better, plays, however, among them Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder (1941; Mother Courage and Her Children, 1962), Der Kaukasische Kreidekreis (1944-1945; The Caucasian Chalk Circle, 1948), and Der Gute Mensch von Sezuan (1943; The Good Woman of Setzuan, 1948) are more ambiguous, seeking to educate the audience about social injustice but less ready to offer glib remedies. Brecht’s influence spread worldwide, and many younger writers adopted the dramatic techniques he developed. Among them were Peter Weiss, best known for his radical and violent play Marat/Sade (1964; trans. 1965), and Rolf Hochhuth, whose controversial documentary drama Der Stellvertreter (1963; The Representative, 1963) sought to indict Pope Pius XII for his failure to speak out on behalf of the Jews during World War II. The plays of the Swiss dramatist Friedrich Dürrenmatt, most notably Der Besuch der Alten Dame (1956; The Visit, 1958), presented a macabre mix of the comic and the tragic, while his fellow countryman, Max Frisch, powerfully addressed the issue of individual moral responsibility in his best-known play Andorra (1961; trans. 1962).\n\nD The 20th-Century Novel\n\nThe strong narrative trend that can be felt in some of Hauptmann’s plays became prominent in his novel Der Narr in Christo Emanuel Quint (1910; The Fool in Christ, Emanuel Quint, 1911), the story of a religiously enraptured young carpenter whose martyrdom is frustrated by the profane world. Schnitzler’s prose forfeited action in favour of interior monologue. In Leutnant Gustl (1901; None but the Brave, 1926) and Fräulein Else (1924; trans. 1925) he created a new technique of dealing with the subconscious. Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (3 vols., 1930-1942; The Man Without Qualities, 1953-1960) by the Austrian writer Robert Musil is an intellectual and psychological mirror of a dying cultural epoch in Europe.\n\nHermann Broch, in his trilogy Die Schlafwandler (1931-1932; The Sleepwalkers, 1932), also described the disintegration and decay of the old bourgeois society. Monumental pictures of historical events and personalities can be found in the writings of Ricarda Huch. In prose Franz Werfel’s best-known works are the novels Die Vierzig Tage des Musa Dagh (1933; The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, 1934) and Das Lied von Bernadette (1941; The Song of Bernadette, 1942). Alfred Döblin in his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929; trans. 1931) found an original montage-like style for presenting the lives of those living on the social margins in the Berlin of the 1920s. The most eminent modern German novelists from the early part of the century are Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, and Franz Kafka. Mann, in his first novel, Buddenbrooks (1901; trans. 1904), stated a recurrent theme of his work: the conflict between the smug, prosperous representatives of healthy bourgeois life and the perceptive, often sickly artist.\n\nThe conflicts and difficulties of the creative personality are the topic of many of Mann’s masterly novels and short stories. In Der Zauberberg (1924; The Magic Mountain, 1927) he offered what is in effect an allegory of Western intellectual life on the eve of World War I. A bitter opponent of National Socialism, Mann left Germany in 1933, and several of the four volumes of Joseph und Seine Brüder (1933-1944; Joseph and His Brothers, 1933-1944) were finished in exile. His despair over the fate of Germany and his concern with the creative artist are eloquently portrayed in Doctor Faustus (1947; trans. 1948), a study of German cultural life during the rise of National Socialism. Heinrich Mann, the brother of the great novelist, was also an opponent of fascism and is known for such political satires as Der Untertan (1918; The Patrioteer, 1921).\n\nThe writings of Hesse express a sense of spiritual loneliness, often tempered by the wisdom and the mysticism of Oriental philosophy. Hesse described the alienation and duality of nature of modern people in his Demian (1919; trans. 1923) and Steppenwolf (1927; trans. 1929). Perhaps his greatest work, Das Glasperlenspiel (1943; trans. as Magister Ludi, 1949; trans. as The Glass Bead Game, 1969), advocates a new ethical and intellectual aristocracy. Hesse, once little read except in Germany, enjoyed a considerable revival during the 1960s, especially among US students. No modern writer in German has exercised a more extraordinary influence on contemporary fiction than the Austrian writer Kafka. His novels Der Prozess (1925; The Trial, 1937), Das Schloss (1926; The Castle, 1930), and Amerika (1927; trans. 1938) and his many short stories evoke in a deeply unsettling way a disjointed world haunted by loss of faith and meaning. His apparently simple narrative style makes use of suggestive symbols to convey the perplexity of human experience.\n\nE Modern Poetry\n\nThe modern era of German poetry begins with Nietzsche, who wrote lyric poetry of the Impressionist and Expressionist schools. His influence can be traced in the lyrics and prose of Gottfried Benn, whose almost nihilistic disillusion and despair underlie his search for positive values. A strong resentment of social injustice characterizes the poems of Richard Dehmel. Hugo von Hofmannsthal developed his poetic gifts in lyric poems and in librettos for operas by the German composer Richard Strauss. The most influential collection of poetry at this time was the anthology Menschheitsdämmerung (The Twilight of Humanity, 1920) containing work by some 23 poets; although many of the poems dealt with the shock of industrialization and urbanization, or with the horrors of war, some also looked forward with hope that, after the carnage, a new humanity would arise and the twilight thus become a dawn.\n\nThe leading exponent of the Symbolist movement in German poetry was Stefan George, who, like Nietzsche, attempted to revive the role of the poet as a critic of materialism and corruption. A similar mission was proposed by Rainer Maria Rilke, who in his Die Sonette an Orpheus (1923; Sonnets to Orpheus, 1936), sought to convey the poet’s mysterious perceptions of beauty. In marked contrast were the mordant verses of Bertolt Brecht, whose first collection Hauspostille (1927) broke with poetic convention by adopting the tone of the folk ballad, with scant attention to the niceties of rhythm or metre and a crude energy designed more for live performance than private reading.\n\nVIII LITERATURE SINCE 1945: FROM DIVISION TO UNIFICATION\n\nThe National Socialists virtually destroyed German culture, imposing a trivial realism upon literature and requiring it to reflect their own fanatical nationalism. As a result of the changes in the political and cultural climate many writers left Germany, and the only significant German literature produced during this period came from writers in exile. Among these were Bertolt Brecht, Thomas Mann, and the poet Nelly Sachs (co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966), whose 1945 poem “O die Schornsteine” (O the Chimneys) was the first verse in German to evoke the reality of the Holocaust. Another such, and possibly the best known of all, was “Todesfuge” (1948; Fugue of Death, 1962) by Paul Celan, whose compressed metaphors convey in 36 lines of chilling intensity the Jewish experience of Auschwitz. West German writing immediately after the war was given the soubriquet of Trümmerliteratur (rubble literature), its most notable example being Draussen vor der Tür (1947; The Man Outside, 1952), Wolfgang Borchert’s powerful play of a soldier returning to a Hamburg in ruins. In the same year Gruppe 47 was formed, a loose grouping of young writers determined to rescue the German language from its debasement under Hitler and to challenge complacent attitudes towards the war. Among these were the poets Günter Eich and Ingeborg Bachmann and the Austrian prose-writer Ilse Aichinger. Another was Heinrich Böll, winner of the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature, whose early short stories described the squalor and futility of warfare.\n\nIn later works such as the novel Gruppenbild mit Dame (1971; Group Portrait with Lady, 1972) he combined this theme with a trenchant denunciation of what he perceived as the dehumanized materialism of the West German Federal Republic. His criticism of social values received further striking expression in the short narrative Die Verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (1974; The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, 1975), based upon his own experience at the hands of the Bild newspaper and telling of the character assassination of a young woman by the gutter press. The story was filmed in 1975. No less eminent and arguably more inventive than Böll is, Günter Grass, whose novel Die Blechtrommel (1959; The Tin Drum, 1962), filmed in 1979, created a storm with its impious vulgarities, portraying Nazi Germany and the post-war era from the bizarre perspective of an eternal three-year old. Also a poet and playwright, Grass has continued to comment on social and political issues in works such as the play Die Plebejer Proben den Aufstand (1966; The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising, 1972) and the novel Der Butt (1976; The Flounder, 1978).\n\nAmong other novelists from the same generation are Siegfried Lenz, best known for his gentle but incisive presentation of the question of guilt in Deutschstunde (1968; The German Lesson, 1971); Uwe Johnson, whose panoramic four-volume novel Jahrestage (1968-1983; Anniversaries, part trans., 1975) evokes historical events in Germany and the United States from the 1930s to 1968; and Martin Walser, the author of more than a dozen novels, initially critical in tone but later mellowing into the often comic creation of inadequate male heroes bewildered by their lives in contemporary society. The 1960s introduced a period of flux and upheaval, symbolized by an attack by Peter Handke upon the writers of Gruppe 47 for what he saw as the sterile descriptiveness of their prose. Handke’s own work, such as the play Kaspar (1968) or the story Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter (1970; The Goalkeeper’s Fear of the Penalty, 1972), examined the ambiguity of reality and the unstable relationship between language and meaning. Far more directly political were the writings of Hans Magnus Enzensberger, whose essays and poems offered a Marxist analysis of society (a position he has long since abandoned).\n\nThe conventionally structured novels of Gabriele Wohmann, with their cool portrayals of middle-class domestic life, and the experimental and nihilistic works of the Austrian Thomas Bernhard illustrate the variety of German literary culture in the years that followed. A spate of so-called “father-novels”, such as Ruth Rehmann’s Der Mann auf der Kanzel (1979; The Man in the Pulpit, 1997), Christoph Meckel’s Suchbild Über meinen Vater (1980; Image for Investigation: About my Father, 1987), or Peter Härtling’s Nachgetragene Liebe (A Grudging Love, 1980), showed a younger generation critically scrutinizing the role played by their fathers during the Nazi era. Among noteworthy works in the 1980s were Peter Schneider’s Der Mauerspringer (1982; The Wall Jumper, 1983), a remarkably prescient narrative on Germany’s division, Patrick Süskind’s internationally best-selling quasi-detective novel, Das Parfum (1985; Perfume 1986), and, from Austria, Elfriede Jelinek’s controversial treatment of sexuality in Lust (1989; Lust, 1992). Literature in the East German state, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was produced under very different conditions from those in the Federal Republic. Writing within the constraints of Soviet-style Socialist Realism, authors were expected to use their works to advance the prevailing orthodoxy and heighten the political consciousness of their readers.\n\nThe later novels of Anna Seghers are painful illustrations of the arid prose that could result. But the history of GDR literature is in essence that of a process in which the limits of the permissible were continually being challenged and enlarged. The young poets of the so-called “lyrical wave” in the 1960s, among them Günter Kunert, Sarah Kirsch, Reiner Kunze, and Volker Braun, without repudiating their allegiance to the state, sought to carve out a greater freedom for subjective expression.\n\nThat this was often fraught with difficulties was illustrated by the fate of the epoch-making Modernist novel Nachdenken über Christa T. (1968; The Quest for Christa T., 1970) by Christa Wolf, freely available in the West but suppressed by the authorities in the GDR until 1973. Nevertheless, work of great originality was written and published, not only Christa Wolf’s own later works, among them Kindheitsmuster (1976; A Model Childhood, 1980) and Kassandra (1982; Cassandra, 1984), but the witty satirical novels of Stefan Heym, for example Der König-David-Bericht (1972; The King David Report, 1973) or Ahasver (1981; The Wandering Jew, 1984), Ulrich Plenzdorf’s ingenious tale of teenage rebellion, Die Neuen Leiden des Jungen W. (The New Sufferings of Young W., 1973), or the radical dramas of Heiner Müller.\n\nBut the authorities were ever watchful for supposed subversion and in 1976 stripped one of their most trenchant critics, the singer and poet Wolf Biermann, of his East German citizenship and expelled him to the West. This marked the start of an exodus, sustained for the next 13 years, of other leading GDR writers and artists, all disillusioned with the reality of East German socialism. Innovative literature continued to be produced, notably Christoph Hein’s laconic chronicles of GDR life, the feminist novels of Irmtraud Morgner, or the vibrant poetry of the anarchic counter-culture centred upon the East Berlin district of Prenzlauer Berg. But not even those writers, like Braun, Heym, and Wolf, who remained loyal to their state and were urging democratic reform to the very end, could save the GDR from final collapse. German unification in 1990 saw the outbreak of an uncommonly bitter literary dispute, the so-called Literaturstreit, launched by some younger critics in the West.\n\nAlthough their accusation of opportunism and political naivety was initially directed at Christa Wolf and her short story Was Bleibt (1990; What Remains, 1993), it developed into a denunciation of GDR writers in general for their alleged role in sustaining a corrupt regime. In the ensuing debate the process of revision was extended to West German literature, with the suggestion that the works of such as Böll had been revered more for their moral posture than their literary quality, the corollary being that German writers should now concern themselves with aesthetics rather than politics.\n\nThe merits of this argument are by no means self-evident, but since unification German writers have certainly lost the authority and public esteem they had previously enjoyed in both East and West. Nevertheless, the response to Günter Grass’ Ein Weites Feld (A Broad Field, 1995), a wide-ranging novel articulating his long-held doubts about German unification, showed that some German writers, at least, have lost none of their ability to arouse controversy and stimulate lively public debate. Grass was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999."
