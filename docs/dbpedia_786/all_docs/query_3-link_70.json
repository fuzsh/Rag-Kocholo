This suggests that this structure can be transferred to the Ukrainian case.\n\nThe cost of rebuilding Ukraine\n\nIn the following, the transfers and investment requirements for the development of Ukraine are calculated. A per capita income of US $6,397 is set as the starting point for Ukraine for the year 2021. This value is between the official World Bank value of only US $2,452 and the PPP-adjusted value, which is four times higher. As a target value, the Polish per capita income of 2021 is calculated analogously at US $23,180. It is 3.6 times higher, and to reach it in 15 years, the Ukrainian economy would have to grow by 9% per year. If Poland could maintain its current growth path of 4%, it would have increased its economic output by 80% in this period. However, the per capita income ratio of Ukraine relative to Poland would have increased from 28% to 55%. The state revenues must be offset; the tax ratio was initially set at 50%, but then falls by five percentage points over time.Table 2 summarises the results of the analysis. The left-hand column shows Ukraine’s initial situation based on the values for 2021, while the right-hand column shows the values for a period 15 years after the start of reconstruction. With 43.8 million inhabitants, the gross domestic product amounts to US $280 billion, and then grows to over US $1 trillion. The allocation of private and government consumption follows the average values of developed economies. The tax rates assumed are in line with the requirements to finance development and be incentive compatible.\n\nSources: Author’s calculations with data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (2019); Blum and Scharfe (2002); Blum et al. (2009), Blum (2012).\n\nThe second block contains the state expenditures of reconstruction including investment aid, guaranteeing the institutions of the state and social security. All state-securing expenditures are included here, and make clear that the amounts cannot be covered initially by the Ukrainian government. State and provincial expenditures grow from US $34.2 billion to US $114.6 billion and social security from US $30.9 billion to US $103.6 billion. This exceeds the amounts mentioned in the first block by US $9 billion and US $15 billion, respectively. For privatisation and – crucial for Ukraine – deoligarchising (the task of the Treuhand in Germany), the annual expenditure is between US $2 billion and almost US $6.5 billion. Induced tax and social security contribution revenues are listed two lines below and offset part of this sum. This considerably reduces the actual burden on the national budget, which has to be covered by other revenues, to US $33.5 billion, rising to US $123.6 billion.\n\nIn the third block, capital coefficients are used to calculate the expenditures for rebuilding the Ukrainian capital stock. The value of around US $9.2 trillion mentioned above assuming a direct transfer of German economic structures is then reduced to US $8.5 trillion. The annual values range between US $343.5 billion and US $538.8 billion. The first value reflects the initially low Ukrainian wages, which also reduces the cost of implementing investment projects, i.e. wages for supply chain management, assembly, construction, etc.; the second reflects the value more adjusted to international competition and integration of the Ukrainian economy.\n\nThis means that initially about US $400 billion have to be spent annually on reconstruction, and as growth increases and as a result of the associated wage and cost increases, this later rises to US $730 billion. The value, however, is reduced by taxes and social security contributions in the respective construction phases; classical values for tax ratios, based on input-output analyses, are around 4%, for social security contributions these values range between 2% and 3%, depending on the development of the welfare state. This appears low overall, but is due to the fact that high shares of intermediate inputs are assumed to be imported or are already included in the normal tax and contribution calculation in the upper block because they are produced domestically.\n\nSince investments, with the exception of economic development, are largely privately financed, the government burden of reconstruction activity (as the sum of the two budget balances – own public investments and investment incentives) is between US $30.3 billion and US $137.3 billion. The increase in this construction-related deficit is mainly driven by wage developments.\n\nFrom the government’s point of view, the overall costs are limited. This is because a functioning, reconstruction-driven economy generates taxes that help to shoulder this deficit. This necessitates a high responsibility for Ukraine to ensure the correct collection of public revenues through an efficient tax and social security contribution system.\n\nThe reconstruction-related current account deficit results from imports for investment purposes; it initially amounts to about one-third of demand, assuming that other effects balance out (in particular that household imports are covered by business exports), but then falls to one-fifth. These are values that have also been experienced by other transition countries with favourable investment opportunities.\n\nExamining the development of Ukraine as a business case, the only expenditures of interest are of the second and third blocks, the state revenues induced by them and the regular state revenues of the country. Over the course of 15 years, the said €8.5 trillion in total expenditure is offset by income from taxes and social security contributions of US $5.9 trillion. The difference of US $2.6 trillion is close to the current account deficit, which ultimately expresses the need for external financing, i.e. capital imports from investors and transfers from other countries, potentially remittances from Ukrainian workers abroad.\n\nPerspectives\n\nIs such a reconstruction of Ukraine feasible? The answer is: yes, but with conditions.\n\nSimilar to the new Länder, which initially had a current account deficit of about half of their own economic output as a result of transfer-supported, overshooting demand and need for outside capital, Ukraine’s “external survival” will largely depend on stabilising the external economic situation through transfers and capital imports. In the scenario, after 15 years and with an economic output equal to that of Poland in 2021, this would be around US $203 billion.\n\nThe initial price situation is similar to that of the new German states. Imports must prevent prices from exploding due to the excessive demand from transfers and capital imports that meets too little supply and triggers massive inflation. Both excessive foreign demand for investment capital and transfers and excessive internal demand for goods either increase the exchange rate or lead to inflation. From an outside perspective, this is a currency appreciation. This effect cost about 10% of industrial jobs in the new Länder in addition to the productivity shock (Greiner et al., 1994) and made it too expensive for Germany to enter the euro, which is why an internal devaluation actually took place via the labour market reforms. Wise macroeconomic policy is important here.\n\nThe state can finance the construction or accompany private investment with public money if it can rely on an efficient tax system. After all, deficits are manageable if foreign countries have institutional and especially credit confidence. Nevertheless, the national budget will only come into balance in the course of the reconstruction period.\n\nDemography is a challenge because of extremely low birth rates, losses because of the war, and outmigration. In the latter, we find similarities to the Eastern German case. The number of refugees in Europe will certainly exceed 10 million soon because large parts of Ukraine are uninhabitable; in the event of peace, some will return, many will stay in the EU for the time being. A strong propensity to work can be assumed. This could result in a considerable number of remittances. An amount of €5,000 per year would already mobilise a contribution of €25 billion by five million workers. However, the employment of Ukrainian citizens abroad competes with the construction needs at home, which in turn quickly creates wage pressure that can only be avoided by strongly increasing productivity and growth.\n\nPolitical stability and economic openness are key, otherwise the construction process cannot be accomplished because insecurity and local pricing power stifle the willingness to invest. Finally, the location must remain attractive so that returns do not flow away but are reinvested locally.\n\nThe potential for a self-sustaining upswing is enormous, because “best practice” is built into industrial premises and this above all is what the public eligibility criteria for financial incentives must require. In addition to agriculture and its potential for a food industry, the country also possesses important strategic raw materials for the energy transition, which favour new local value chains. Particularly worthy of mention are rare earths and battery raw materials, as well as titanium and palladium (Blum et al., 2023).\n\nUkraine must escape the conflict zone in which it is currently stuck and gain an independent political perspective for the future. Then reconstruction will be feasible, manageable and profitable. Otherwise, it will become a poorhouse of Europe. Through its war of aggression and the complete loss of its reputation under international law, the Kremlin has made a cooperative solution impossible in the short term. Thus, the West is called upon to find a viable solution for Ukraine that will also open up future political access for Russia in the distant future.\n\nReferences\n\nBayerischer Rundfunk (2022, 4 July), Wiederaufbau: Ukraine schätzt Kosten auf 750 Milliarden Dollar, https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/wiederaufbau-ukraine-schaetzt-kosten-auf-750-milliarden-dollar,TAdWaOr (16 March 2022).\n\nBlum, U. and L.
