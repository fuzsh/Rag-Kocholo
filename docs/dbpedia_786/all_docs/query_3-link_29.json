        "text": "Here is a very interesting post and film biopic on Ulrike Meinhof, of the German Baader-Meinhoff Red Army Faction (RAF).\n\nThe film attempts a fuller examination of her life, journalism, and later active involvement, interviewing many who knew her personally in private life, work, and through commitment and action.\n\nhttp://notesfromaroom.com/2024/05/22/to-talk-elsewhere/\n\nAs always with political, social, events there is a lot more unknown than we imagined. In this case it is not just the personal, family details, but also the complex, shifting, and developing situation in the divided Germany of the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe main catalyst to action was what they (RAF) sarcastically called The Grand Coalition, an unholy government pact between known Nazi and then chancellor, Kiesenger, and avowed anti-Nazi Willy Brandt, Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was as though saying, If this is possible, then there can be no credibility to the government.\n\nWe are shown nothing of the victims or their families, of the RAF attacks.\n\n*\n\nThere is a mystery to her death. Wiki tells us that, contrary to what the film says, a suicide pact was made between Red Army Faction members held in detention.\n\nThey were held in extreme isolation, though, at that time, that is isolated from outside contact, and from contact with each other.\n\nThere is also a suggestion of character-alteration due to physiological causes:\n\nFollowing their apparent suicides, the German government had the brains of Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin and Raspe illegally removed for study at the Neurological Research Institute at the University of Tübingen.[40][41] Meinhof’s brain contained scar tissue, the result of surgery to remove a benign tumor in 1962, that could have affected her behavior.[42]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Baader\n\nThis examining of brains to find reasons for behaviour, attitudes, seems to us now as little more than a modern version of phrenology.\n\nAll this attempting to rationalise her life-trajectory seems to miss the point, somehow. It is as though ‘normal’ people’s life experience does not include crises of conscience, or temperaments that run adversely to a status quo. After all as a woman her default setting would be nurturing, passive. Right ?\n\nThis is probably why there will always be, and always has been, political extremists of all ‘wings’. Is it a temperament one is born with ?\n\nIt’s not a form of determinism, factors can alter one’s directions all the time. There are some periods in a regime’s existence when options are curtailed, however, when ameliorating factors and influences become, perhaps unintentionally, smothered.\n\nThe Notes from a Room blog site is well worth reading, with high quality content and presentation.\n\nhttps://notesfromaroom.com\n\n*\n\nIn the 1980s the painter Gerhard Richter revisited the legacy of Ulrike Meinhof, establishing and situating her images permanently within mainstream German culture\n\nhttps://gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/photo-paintings/baader-meinhof-56\n\nChina’s history, like nearly every history, is littered with ages of chaos interspersed with ‘quieter’ ages. The old ‘Chinese curse’ May you live in ‘interesting times‘ says enough in its condensed few words, to capture an attitude of wry… fortitude ?\n\nBut to be caught up in one of these times, one that dashes, and continues to dash, all hopes for a better future, now that is the hardest.\n\nIn Liu Cixin’s sci-fi novel The Three Body Problem explores the devastating consequences.\n\nHow many died needlessly in the Cultural Revolution?\n\nHow many died on Tiananman Square that night\n\nas we slept safely in our beds ?\n\nThat last detail is one I still find difficult to cope with, we are so used to our rights being observed, here, in the West.\n\nOn the whole we live in caring times, we have rights, and mostly they are not violated, en masse.\n\nThe Palestinian protests have not been smashed by tanks and armoured vehicles.\n\nThere are degrees of violation, of course; most often they have a narrow, domestic, focus.\n\nPersistant, yes, and not (never?) corrected, but our repression has not been on the scale we see elsewhere in the world.\n\nWhat am I getting at ?\n\nTiananmen Square remains\n\na political stain.\n\nUnaddressed. Unredressed.\n\nHttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-businesses-mark-tiananmen-anniversary-in-face-of-pressures\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-china-57314397\n\nSo, we were watching a film the other niiiight…\n\nand it became so preposterous that we had to leave it.\n\nBUT there were two big ticks in its favour –\n\nthe first was the main character was played by Jessie Buckley, who is always good (what was she doing in this ?)\n\nthe second, the piece of piano music she purportedly played : Chopin, Nocturne Op 9, 2.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Buckley\n\nThe film played with two images, of The Green Man\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man\n\ncombined with a Sheela-na-Gig figure.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheela_na_gig\n\nNeither had been thought through, and used solely for surface effect.\n\nThe Green Man copies the Roman figure of Sylvanus too closely to not be a related memory.\n\nSheela-na-Gig, mostly found on ecclesiastical sites, is surely a warning for celibate priests, of what would await them should they stray.\n\nA Whore of Babylon figure ? Maybe.\n\nBe that as it may, the music in the film’s close domestic setting, was perfect.\n\nI will leave you with that\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg\n\nUnity through music\n\nI really enjoyed Eurovision this year.\n\nI have started viewing it again after many years of neglect.\n\nSheer spectacle, and that is certainly half of the appeal – and it is so good to see different countries make such good use of the technologies available.\n\nAh, but the music, so much better than it use to be.\n\nThis year was particularly strong on singers.\n\nSome really great acts.\n\nI was impressed by the phenomenal voice of Gunnhild Sundi, lead singer of Gåte, the Norwegian entry. Although the song itself lacked that special element, she stood out.\n\nAnd the Portuguese entry ! iolanda ! Great voice, strong, tonal, with real range.\n\nThe French singer, too, Slimane, so rich and strong. And Latvia’s Dons, lovely voice.\n\nBut fun, too, many acts here, with all this pressure, made their entry seem so much fun, enjoyable. Take Croatia’s Baby Lasagne, with Rim Tim Tagi Dim. Joyous.\n\nOf course, who could miss Finland’s Windows95Man and the amazing pants !\n\nEthnic tunes and traditional instruments were used too; Serbia’s Teya Dora and entourage had such a sense of fun.\n\nAnd Armenia’s Ladaniva… such energy; lively music.\n\nLet’s also applaud Estonia’s 5miinust x Puuluup – simply joyous.\n\nIreland’s Bambi Thug, of course, with its mix-up of … was that Slipknot ? And Shakespeare’s Sister ?…. Great blending of harshness and melody. Wonderful choreography.\n\nWhich leads to the main blight of the programme for me, and that is the compère, Graham Norton’s inane comments. Admittedly he is not as bad as he use to be, with waspish comments. Could do without him, though.\n\nNemo, the winner, his balancing on the lip of a rotating disk, was stupendous.\n\nThe song, second time around….\n\nJust me."
