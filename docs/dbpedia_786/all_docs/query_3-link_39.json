        "text": "This thesis sets out to define the field of Berlin English-language fiction since 1989 by identifying its distinctive forms of representation of space and memory. The post-Wall Berlin thriller can be characterised as a literary category based on genre combinations and a turn to the past. Distinct spatial iconographies emerge in thrillers representing Nazi Berlin, post-war &#39;rubble Berlin&#39; and the divided Cold War period; even the twenty-first-century city is related to 1920s cabarets. Applying Huyssen&#39;s observations on Berlin as a palimpsest of dynamic relations between past and present, I show that the Berlin thriller&#39;s concern with memory is responsive to contemporary uncertainties in the decades following the fall of the Wall. I proceed to compare British perspectives on divided Berlin in novels with thriller associations by Ian McEwan, John le Carré and James Lasdun. I posit that British involvement in the shared governance of divided Berlin during the Cold War er...\n\nThere was no Berlin Wall and it never fell. In this book I show that these claims are not in any way radical. My book is neither about conspiracy theories, nor about the fragile nature of truth. Instead, it considers the ways in which we recount and remember news stories of historic significance. Focusing on journalists covering the fall of the Berlin Wall and on subsequent retellings of the event, I discuss how storytellers build up certain events so that people in many parts of the world remember them for long periods of time.\n\nIn this article I argue, based on Gilles Deleuze’s concept of affect, that the aesthetics of the Berlin Wall, i.e., the aesthetics of the different generations of the Wall itself (especially the last generation of the Wall) and the artistic interventions on the Western side of the Wall, in form of graffiti and wall art, have created effects which not necessarily challenge the Wall’s function as a border fortification system, but incorporate it in dialectical form. Affects triggered by the Western Wall’s sensational effects and its meandering course through the divided city have animated the Wall in such a way, that the Wall transforms into a living ornament. I read the Wall’s aesthetics as Baroque, in which façade and inner structure are seemingly unrelated but not separate and condition each other. I argue that the growing tension between Western surface intervention and Eastern military structure have the potential to bring forward states of e/motion, which I term in the Deleuzian...\n\nThis paper will focus on three historical narratives by European filmmakers which grapple with the Holocaust when constructing a narrative about Germany's past and present. The motifs of lack, ashes, non-depiction, and fantasy or magical realism run through these narratives, suggesting that a way to hint at memory and evoke truth is not through pure depiction of facts but through narrative and an intentional engagement of non-reality. Furthermore, I will center ideas of space and geography and the unique usage of both concepts in each of the three films. Vergangenheitsbewältigung, a word meaning \"struggle of overcoming the past,\" is what I will be focusing mainly on, with an analysis of each film also including how the built environment of the geographical setting or physical structures, for example the Höss's family home in The Zone of Interest (2023), the Berlin Wall in Wings of Desire (1987), or the concentration camp infrastructure in Nuit et brouillard (1956), contributes to the psychological topology of each film. I will also consider modern-day Berlin and its erections, memorials, and monuments, including how they are depicted in the films mentioned, and the Stolpersteine, or stumbling stones, an ongoing art project by German artist Gunter Demnig, as physical manifestations of a fraught history in a city with many material remnants of past atrocities which shape the nation's contemporary consciousness."
