Hundreds of children learned Aleph Bet and experienced a “joyful Jewish beginning” under her tutelage, and her classroom was full of her lively and happy art.\n\nShe deeply cared about individuals and would make an extra effort to reach out to those who had no family or place to celebrate Shabbat.

And while Audrey struggled to adapt to the rain that first year, soon she never wanted to live anywhere else than her beloved Portland.\n\nAudrey passed away Tuesday, Aug. 8, 2023, at Washington Gardens Memory Care in Tigard, after a near 15-year battle with Alzheimer’s, with her beloved husband of 66 years, and her family at her side. Born April 9, 1935, in Schenectady, N.Y., to Augusta, a homemaker, and Samuel Englebardt, a lawyer, Audrey was a loving daughter, wife, mother, grandmother, sister, and friend. She met Mort while they were still in high school at a cousin’s birthday party, where the girls had to put one shoe in a basket for the boys to choose from.\n\nAudrey loved dance and school, and excelled at both. She grew up surrounded by a large extended family, including her two brothers, Marvin and Carl. At Knott Terrace High School, she was the captain of the cheerleading team and a dancer and also one of the top students. Audrey majored in sociology at Skidmore College, where she was a member of the Periclean Society (Phi Beta Kappa) and continued to pursue her love of dance. After college, Audrey and Mort married and moved to Chicago, where he studied law at the University of Chicago and she worked as a secretary in a doctor’s office, and where Jane was born.\n\nAfter law school, they moved to Salem, Ore., in 1960, where Diane was born. From the beginning of her life in Portland, Audrey was active at Congregation Neveh Shalom and the Jewish Community Center, teaching in the Sunday School and pre-school. She continued to dance with a local company as well. When their son, Sam, born in Portland, started grade school, Audrey returned to school at Portland State University to get her Master of Social Work in the early 70s.\n\nAudrey was active in the Jewish community and a loyal supporter of the arts, especially Chamber Music Northwest and Portland Center Stage. She spent over 25 years as a medical social worker at Good Samaritan Hospital, counseling patients and families during and after their hospital stays. Whether in her professional or personal life, people always recognized Audrey’s warm personality and generous spirit.\n\nFor all of her obvious kindness Nunni was also fierce. Fiercely intelligent, fiercely moral, fiercely loyal. And she believed in her family and friends fiercely. She immersed her children in the arts because it brought her so much joy. She studied classical piano for many years and also studied painting. She was obsessed with the New York Times crossword puzzle, enjoyed trying new Portland restaurants, and had a strong sweet tooth, especially loving chocolate and ice cream. Her favorite activity was weekends on the Oregon Coast with Mort, where she could walk for hours.\n\nShe is survived by Mort, Jane Zalutsky and Mark Kantor of Cle Elum, Wash.; Diane Zalutsky Alexander and Kent Alexander of Atlanta; Sam Zalutsky and Ed Boland of New York City; grandchildren, Nicki and Kayla Alexander, and Josh and Lane Kantor, as well as her brother and sister-in-law, Carl and Kathy Englebardt of Niskiyuna, N.Y.; sister-in-law Sabra Englebardt of Boulder, Colo. Her beloved brother, Marvin Englebardt, predeceased her.\n\nThe funeral was held Thursday, Aug. 10, 2023, at Congregation Neveh Shalom, led by Rabbi Eve Posen, with the burial at Ahavai Shalom cemetery.

She was passionately devoted to Labor Zionism and Yiddish culture as well as her family. Her children include Aki Fleshler, former President of Congregation Kesser Israel in Portland. After living in New York, Ohio, and Connecticut, she moved to Portland in December 2022 and resided at Rose Schnitzer Manor.\n\nShe was born Oct. 19, 1927, in New York City, the only child of Pearl (Perel) and Samuel (Shulem) Weiner. Her parents were activists in the Farband, an organization of Yiddish-speaking Labor Zionists. When Mrs. Tilow was young, they moved to Akron, Ohio, where her parents became Farband leaders in the Midwest, and Shulem taught in one of the organization’s schools. She spoke proudly about the time her family hosted a fundraising event for a fiery young Zionist named Golda Myerson, who eventually became Prime Minister Golda Meir.\n\nWhen she was 12, her family returned to New York City, where she became active in Habonim, a Labor Zionist youth organization. She was so inspired by the idea of a Jewish state that she joined a small group of American Jews planning to start Kibbutz Gesher Haziv. After getting an Associate’ Degree in Nutrition, she planned to run the kibbutz kitchen.\n\nHer plans changed in 1948 after she fell in love with Maurice (Moishe) Fleshler in a training camp for would-be kibbutz pioneers. They married, and after becoming pregnant, they decided it would be too difficult to give birth and raise the baby on a new kibbutz, so they stayed in New York City, where they had two sons, Aki and Dan, and Mr. Fleshler got an engineering degree. They subsequently lived in several small towns in Pennsylvania, where Mrs. Tilow began a career as a hospital dietician. In her limited spare time she also ran a small catering company with Eastern European recipes she’d learned from her mother, including pot roast,tongue with tomato sauce, kasha varnishkes and huluptzes (stuffed cabbage).\n\nIn early 1967, the Fleshlers moved back to New York City where, tragically, Mr. Fleshler died from a heart attack at age 40. In 1970, she married William Tilow, who had three sons from a previous marriage, and moved to Woodbridge Connecticut, a suburb of New Haven. After handling the daunting responsibility of managing—and cooking great meals for—a household filled with rambunctious boys, she was widowed again in 1984.\n\nUndaunted, Mrs. Tilow rebuilt her life yet again, moving to Hamden, Connecticut and working in several hospitals in the New Haven area. She became the president of the local chapter of Na’amat, an Israel-focused organization dedicated to uplifting women and children. After retiring in her late 60s, she travelled extensively, was an active participant in the New Haven Yiddish Club and read stories to disadvantaged children at the Hamden Library. At the age of 80 as a member of Temple Beth Shalom in Hamden, she studied for and celebrated the Bat Mitzvah she’d never had in in her youth.\n\nIn addition to her sons, Aki Fleshler and Dan Fleshler and stepsons Seth Tilow, Josh Tilow and Adam Tilow, she is survived by grandchildren Eva, Shoshana, Lillie, Julia, Kaniel, Dylan and Jessica and great-grandchildren Ayla, Zoe, Yehezkel and Eliora.\n\nBurial was July 3 in the Congregation Kesser Israel Cemetery. The family suggests memorial contributions to Na’amat USA (https://naamat.org/waystogive/).\n\nARNOLD COGAN\n\nArnold Cogan z”l died Friday, July 14 in Portland at the age of 90.\n\nCogan was born Dec. 3, 1932, in Bath, Maine, and moved to Portland in 1948. He graduated from Grant High School in Portland and studied engineering at Oregon State University, where he met Elaine Rosenberg. The couple were married in 1952.\n\nAfter serving in the United States Army, Cogan returned to Portland and worked in engineering. He later joined the City of Portland’s planning department, working on the design of Pioneer Courthouse Square, Tom McCall Waterfront Park, and the Swan Island Industrial Park. Cogan was named the state’s first land use planning director after working to establish the Department of Land Conservation.\n\nCogan joined Congregation Neveh Shalom shortly after moving to Portland; he was President of the congregation from 1988-1990 and chaired multiple long-range planning projects with the congregation.\n\nCogan is survived by his wife, Elaine Cogan; children Leonard Cogan, Mark (PJ) Cogan, and Suzanne (Bob) Van Brocklin; sisters Carol Koranda and Judy Ross; grandchildren Elizabeth, Kate, Meg, David, Annabelle, and Rodrigo; and great-grandchildren Jovie and Remy.\n\nA private burial was followed by a July 17 memorial service at the Stampfer Chapel at Congregation Neveh Shalom.\n\nHAZEL LUCILLE HARDEN\n\nCongregation Kol Ami is saddened to announce the death of Hazel Lucille Harden z”l, mother of Kol Ami member Phil Harden.

He was the son of Dr. Ben Vidgoff and Laura Horwitt Vidgoff and the brother of Dr. Jaclyn Vidgoff. Martin graduated from Lincoln High School in Portland in 1961 and from Harvard College in 1966 with an A.B. degree cum laude in government. He received his Juris Doctor degree from Stanford Law School in 1969, where he was president of the student Law Association.\n\nMartin became a member of the Oregon State Bar in 1969 and initially worked as an associate of the Miller Nash firm in Portland. Next Martin served as Deputy County Counsel for Multnomah County. In 1978 he followed Multnomah County Counsel George Joseph to the Oregon Court of Appeals, where Martin served as staff attorney for 23 years.\n\nMartin was known for his formidable intellect and precise memory of the law. He was very much an old-fashioned gentleman, and could quite often politely point to the precise volume in the Oregon Reports where one could find the answer to a legal question. He was given to murmuring (or occasionally muttering) profound insights into the law, delivering lengthy monologues on the assassination of JFK, and telling humorous stories about the political insights of his cats Ishmael and Barnaby.\n\nFormer Appeals Court Chief Judge Mary Deits stated that Martin drafted more than 1,100 opinions for the Court of Appeals during his years of service to the Court. Judge Deits also referred to Martin’s “ability to write a perfectly worded opinion in a difficult case-often in a matter of hours.” Many of his opinion drafts dealt with Oregon land use law. Former Oregon Supreme Justice William Riggs stated Martin drafted “just about all of the landmark land use decisions for [the Court of Appeals] for a long time.”\n\nMartin’s humor was legendary. When he graduated from Stanford Law School, he wrote about himself: “I had a normal childhood except for never catching the mumps. Then I went to Harvard, where I caught the mumps.” Martin was preceded in death by his parents; his sister; and many close family members.

Rick is survived by his wife, Sura Rubenstein; daughter, Malia (Molly) Haselton, a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps stationed at Camp Pendleton in California; sister, Diane (Haselton) Landers and her husband, Greg Landers, of Portland; nephew, Tom Landers, of Portland; and many Schantz and Wilcox aunts, uncles and cousins and their children.\n\nRick was appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals by Gov. Barbara Roberts on March 3, 1994.\n\nAt that time, he was 40 years old and had been in private law practice for some 14 years, most of them at the Lindsay, Hart, Neil & Weigler firm. He had joined the firm of Haglund, Kirtley & Kelley just before his appointment to the appellate court, and the HKK firm took out an ad in the Oregon Bar Journal announcing their newest partner – and congratulating him on his appointment to the Court of Appeals.\n\nWhen he retired on Dec. 31, 2015, his 21 years of service on the Oregon Court of Appeals made him the longest-serving judge in the history of that court. He had been Chief Judge of the court since 2012 and continued to hear cases as a senior judge for several years.\n\nRick was born Nov. 5, 1953, in Albany, Ore. His parents divorced early; his mother, Shirley Schantz Haselton, was a teacher at what is now West Albany High School and later became a professor in the School of Education at Oregon State University.\n\nRick said recently that a photo of “Little Ricky” playing in his bathtub expressed his essence. He had never changed from that little boy, happy to be splashing, making a mess and just enjoying life. He took such delight in everyday blessings and the wonders of the world around him. He loved a good milkshake, his daily “medicinal” glass or two of red wine, good Scotch, old and new friends, books, ballgames and mowing the lawn.\n\nHe loved family – Sura so much that they celebrated three separate weddings (there’s a story there!). Most of all, he loved being a father – he and Molly were a team, often co-conspirators, and the best of buddies. This last August, the Great American Father-Daughter Cross-Country Road Trip from Virginia to California was a special memory, complete with commemorative travel mugs and great stories from stops along the way.\n\nA onetime altar boy in Albany, Rick embraced Judaism as an adult, found joy in its rituals and wisdom, and abiding friendships across the spectrum of Jewish life. As the “Orthodox judge” at the Oregon Court of Appeals, he appreciated the Court staff’s efforts to accommodate his religious practice – and took a measure of delight in how his non-Jewish carpool mates always worried about leaving early enough on dark winter Fridays so he could be home in time for candlelighting.\n\nRick graduated from what is now West Albany High School and then earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Stanford University in 1976. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1979, then returned to Oregon to serve as a clerk to the late Alfred T. “Ted” Goodwin, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers nine western states, before beginning work with the Lindsay Hart law firm.\n\nHe considered the Oregon Court of Appeals the place he was meant to be. His clerks became a part of his family, and he delighted in their achievements.\n\nIn the Jewish community, he served on the boards of the Jewish Federation of Greater Portland, Portland Jewish Academy and Congregation Kesser Israel, where he also served as president.

He is survived by his significant other, Roslyn Millet; children, Karen, Robyn, Leslie “Choo” (Matt), Phillip (Mary) and Edy (Tim); grandchildren, Jaren, Joseph, Mallory, Shaun, Kara, Joshua, Zachary, Brittney, Curtis, Cody and Jamie; and great-grandchildren, Mya, Jason, Jude, McKenna, Maisen, Nora, Maggie, Ezekiel, Peyton, Delilah and Reilly. He was preceded in death by his brother, Leonard; his wives, Audrey, Marilyn and Corrine “Corky”; significant other Sue; and grandson, Kelly.\n\nZelinka was born May 31, 1929, and grew up in Los Angeles, Calif. He was an unstoppable Fairfax High School All-City guard and captain of the ‘47 eleven. He was a 3-year letterman and excellent student, who also found time to give back to the community as a camp counselor and swim and ski instructor for children.\n\nHe discovered early on that he was an excellent athlete. He later graduated with a bachelor’s degree in physical fitness, becoming the first college graduate of his eastern-European immigrant family.\n\nZelinka’s athletic ability and love of football created a lifelong passion and career that he loved. At junior college, he won a national championship as a guard for the Santa-Ana “Don’s” and led them to the Jr. Rose Bowl. He then became a UCLA Bruin, coming in as a junior in 1950, proclaiming himself “mighty rough to handle.” As a senior, he was touted as saying, “I’ll bust ‘em up and break ‘em in little pieces.” He took football very seriously and would stop at nothing to be the best.\n\nIn 1952 and 1953, Zelinka took his Naval Training Center San Diego football team to the Poinsettia Bowl and Salad Bowl, respectively.\n\nHis coaching career would be what he was ultimately famous for. At age 25, “Tiger,” as he soon came to be known, became a Beaver when he was named assistant head football coach at Oregon State. He was the youngest coach in OSU history and, until recently, in the United States.\n\nTiger quickly took Oregon State to the 1956 Rose Bowl as Pacific Coast Conference champions. He found himself in the newspapers nearly weekly because of his success coaching Oregon State. The press followed his coaching style and his personal life, including his marriage and the arrival of his children.\n\nIn 1962, Zelinka won big. He and his star player, Heisman Memorial Trophy winner, Terry Baker, won the Liberty Bowl. It was an epic game and would go down in Oregon State history as one of the best wins ever.\n\nZelinka’s Oregon State coaching career ended in 1965 after another run at the Rose Bowl. A new head coach moved Zelinka out, and the Beavers have never played in another Rose Bowl.\n\nZelinka went on to become a Head Linesman for the Pacific Coast Conference and officiated many bowl games over the years. He spent time in the offseason trading lumber and continued to do that following his officiating career until the time he retired.\n\nZelinka has been inducted into the State of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, Oregon State University Hall of Fame and Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. He was known well for being a faithful friend and even continued to meet with his high school sports club, The Unicorns, monthly until the day he died. He was larger than life. Bob “Tiger” Zelinka will forever be known simply as Coach.\n\nZelinka’s family said he passed away peacefully at the Los Altos home of his significant other’s family. To everyone, he was a football star, great friend, a funny man and life of the party and truly a remarkable man who lived a big, bright, remarkable life. To his family, he was a loving partner, father, grandfather and great-grandfather who made a big impact on the world and in their lives and who will forever be in their hearts.\n\nServices will be held at 11 am, Thursday, May 25, 2023, at Beth Israel Cemetery, 426 SW Taylors Ferry Road, Portland.\n\nDonations in Bob’s memory may be made to the Mittleman Jewish Community Center Harry Glickman Scholar-Athlete Award.\n\nHOWARD MARTIN COHN\n\nHoward Martin Cohn, z”l, passed away on May 21, 2023.

Through hard work and determination, they built a life in Beaverton filled with many cherished memories.\n\nGrigoriy’s wife and devoted partner, Vera, will profoundly mourn his loss, as she unwaveringly stood by his side through the most joyous and the most challenging times of his life. Their connection will forever remain unbreakable.\n\nGrigoriy took great pride in watching Roman flourish and become a remarkable individual while carrying on his father’s legacy and starting a loving family of his own.\n\nThe Shabashevich family would like to extend their heartfelt gratitude for the overwhelming support, thoughts and prayers received during this challenging time.\n\nGrigoriy Shabashevich will be remembered as a devoted family man and a source of inspiration.

Here are few snippets of her remarkable life.\n\nMuriel was born in Chicago, Ill., Dec. 12, 1926, to immigrant parents. At age 19, she married the love of her life, a sailor (Irv) and remained married to him for 76½ years until her death.\n\nA model trendsetter for many of the woman of her generation at a time when women were expected to stay home and be a housewife, Muriel had other ideas and dreams. She pursued her passions and went to junior college when her youngest daughter was 5 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree and a full scholarship to Northwestern University, where she earned a master’s degree in Sociology. She became a professor and taught Sociology at Wright Jr. College. When teaching and sociology no longer quite fit her dreams and goals, she returned to school at Jane Adams College of Social Work (University of Illinois, Chicago Campus) earning an MSW. She then went on to have a very successful private practice – a career that she was passionate about. She also worked for Traveler’s Aid with international adoptions and travelled to Korea several times.\n\nMuriel cared deeply for human rights and equality for all. She tried to cure the world of social injustices by fighting for civil rights, marching with Martin Luther King Jr. and trying to integrate her “white” neighborhood in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1989, grandbabies brought Muriel and Irv to Oregon, where she continued working as a therapist until she retired at age 80. Muriel and Irv were pivotal to the creation and growth of Kol Shalom, where she continued to try and cure the world of its injustices. She was proud to call herself a cultural and humanistic Jew. She embraced culture from her Jewish heritage, to her love of music, theater, opera, dance, art, books, travel and food. She enjoyed nature, beach walks and laughing.\n\nYes, she enjoyed life to the fullest. She and Irv were models for active aging. Age was only a number to them. At least until that wretched Alzheimer’s disease took her brilliant mind, little by little and bit by bit. Donations can be made to the Alzheimer’s Association (alz.org).\n\nThe best way to honor her memory is to continue her fight against social injustice. Volunteer, email your elected officials, and get out and just talk to folks. Hug often and pursue your own passions.\n\nA celebration of her life is planned for May 14, 2023.\n\nROBERTA (BOBBY) BERWIN\n\nRoberta (Bobby) Berwin, z”l, passed away on Feb. 24, 2023, at the age of 79 in Overland Park, Kansas.
