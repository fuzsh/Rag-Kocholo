Her teaching and research interests center on German literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, literary theory, and contemporary Germany, especially as pertaining to women. Her publications include editions of Sophie LaRoche and A.O. Hoyers, an edited volume Frauen Freundschaft —Männer Freundschaft: Literarische Diskurse im achtzehnten Jahrhundert (1991), and the books Die Frau von der Reformation zur Romantik (3d ed. , 1987) and Der lange Weg zur Mündigkeit: Frau und Literatur 1500-1800 (1987 and 1989). She is currently completing a study titled \"Friendship, Love, and Patriarchy: Gender and German Romanticism.\" Jutta Brückner is a filmmaker and professor for film and video at the Hochschule der Künste in Berlin. She studied political science and wrote her dissertation on German statesmanship in the eighteenth century. Subsequently she did radio plays and wrote essays and filmscripts for directors such as Volker Schlöndorff. As an author of screenplays, director, and producer she has made eight films of her own, including Years of Hunger (Hungerjahre), One Look and It's Love (Ein Blick und die Liebe bricht aus), and Colossal Love (Kolossale Liebe). She is currently preparing a documentary film essay on Bertolt Brecht, a feature film about Brecht and the women in his life, and a documentary film essay on Ingeborg Bachmann. Lewis Call is a PhD candidate in History at the University of California, Irvine. In his dissertation, \"Friedrich Nietzsche as Critic and Captive of Enlightenment,\" he explores Nietzsche's often virulent critique of the Enlightenment tradition, focusing on Nietzsche's attacks on Descartes, Rousseau, and Kant. He also examines the ways in which Nietzsche critiques such scions of nineteenth-century enlightened thought as John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, and Herbert Spencer. He concludes with a look at how, despite all efforts to escape the influence of Enlightenment, Nietzsche retains important elements of Enlightenment thought, notably the utopianism exemplified by his Übermensch.
