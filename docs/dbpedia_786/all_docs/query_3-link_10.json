This includes literature written in Germany, Austria, the German part of Switzerland, and to a lesser extent works of the German diaspora. German literature of the modern period is mostly in Standard German, but there are some currents of literature influenced to a greater or lesser degree by dialects (e.g. Alemannic).\n\nAn early flowering of German literature is the Middle High German period of the High Middle Ages. Modern literature in German begins with the authors of the Enlightenment (such as Herder) and reaches its classical form at the turn of the 18th century with Weimar Classicism (Goethe and Schiller).\n\nPeriodization[]\n\nPeriodization is not an exact science but the following list contains movements or time periods typically used in discussing German literature. It seems worth noting that the periods of medieval German literature span two or three centuries, those of early modern German literature span one century, and those of modern German literature each span one or two decades. The closer one nears the present, the more debated the periodizations become.\n\nMedieval German literature\n\nOld High German literature (750-1050)\n\nMiddle High German literature (1050–1300)\n\nLate medieval German literature/Renaissance (1300–1500)\n\nEarly Modern German literature (see Early Modern literature)\n\nHumanism and Protestant Reformation (1500–1650)\n\nBaroque (1600–1720)\n\nEnlightenment (1680–1789)\n\nModern German literature\n\nEighteenth- and 19th-century German literature\n\nEmpfindsamkeit / Sensibility (1750s-1770s)\n\nSturm und Drang / Storm and Stress (1760s-1780s)\n\nGerman Classicism (1729–1832)\n\nWeimar Classicism (1788–1805) or (1788–1832), depending on whether one marks the end of this period with Schiller's death (1805) or with Goethe's (1832)\n\nGerman Romanticism (1790s-1880s)\n\nBiedermeier (1815–1848)\n\nYoung Germany (1830–1850)\n\nPoetic Realism (1848–1890)\n\nNaturalism (1880–1900)\n\n20th century German literature\n\n1900-1933\n\nFin de siècle (c. 1900)\n\nSymbolism\n\nExpressionism (1910–1920)\n\nDada (1914–1924)\n\nNew Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit)\n\n1933-1945\n\nNational Socialist literature\n\nExile literature\n\n1945-1989\n\nBy country\n\nFederal Republic of Germany\n\nGerman Democratic Republic\n\nAustria\n\nSwitzerland\n\nOther\n\nBy thematic or group\n\nPost-war literature (1945–1967)\n\nGroup 47\n\nHolocaust literature\n\nContemporary German literature (1989-)\n\nFile:Frenzel.gif\n\ngraph of works listed in Frenzel, Daten deutscher Dichtung (1952). Visible is medieval literature overlapping with Renaissance up to the 1540s, modern literature beginning 1720, and the baroque period separating the two, from 1550 to 1700.[1]\n\nMiddle Ages[]\n\nMain article: Medieval German literature\n\nMedieval German literature refers to literature written in Germany, stretching from the Carolingian dynasty; various dates have been given for the end of the German literary Middle Ages, the Reformation (1517) being the last possible cut-off point.\n\nOld High German[]\n\nThe Old High German period is reckoned to run until about the mid-11th century, though the boundary to Early Middle High German (second half of the 11th century) is not clear-cut.\n\nThe most famous work in OHG is the Hildebrandslied, a short piece of Germanic alliterative heroic verse which besides the Muspilli is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition. Another important work, in the northern dialect of Old Saxon, is a life of Christ in the style of a heroic epic known as the Heliand.\n\nMiddle High German[]\n\nMiddle High German proper runs from the beginning of the 12th century. In the second half of the 12th century, there was a sudden intensification of activity, leading to a 60-year \"golden age\" of medieval German literature referred to as the mittelhochdeutsche Blütezeit (1170–1230). This was the period of the blossoming of MHG lyric poetry, particularly Minnesang (the German variety of the originally French tradition of courtly love). One of the most important of these poets was Walther von der Vogelweide. The same sixty years saw the composition of the most important courtly romances. These are written in rhyming couplets, and again draw on French models such as Chrétien de Troyes, many of them relating Arthurian material, for example, Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach. The third literary movement of these years was a new revamping of the heroic tradition, in which the ancient Germanic oral tradition can still be discerned, but tamed and Christianized and adapted for the court. These high medieval heroic epics are written in rhymed strophes, not the alliterative verse of Germanic prehistory. For example, the Nibelungenlied.\n\nEarly Modern period[]\n\nFurther information: Early Modern literature\n\nGerman Renaissance and Reformation[]\n\nFurther information: German Renaissance, Humanism in Germany, and Protestant Reformation\n\nFurther information: Early Modern High German\n\nSebastian Brant (1457–1521)\n\nThomas Murner (1475–1537)\n\nPhilipp Melanchthon (1497–1560)\n\nSebastian Franck (1500–1543)\n\nAndrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503–1572)\n\nBaroque period[]\n\nThe Baroque period (1600 to 1720) was one of the most fertile times in German literature. Many writers reflected the horrible experiences of the Thirty Years' War, in poetry and prose. Grimmelshausen's adventures of the young and naïve Simplicissimus, in the eponymous book Simplicius Simplicissimus, became the most famous novel of the Baroque period. Andreas Gryphius and Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein wrote German language tragedies, or Trauerspiele, often on Classical themes and frequently quite violent. Erotic, religious and occasional poetry appeared in both German and Latin.\n\nModern period[]\n\nFurther information: Modern literature\n\n18th century[]\n\nThe Enlightenment[]\n\nFurther information: The Enlightenment\n\nAugust Friedrich Wilhelm Crome\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder\n\nPaul Heinrich Dietrich von Holbach\n\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi\n\nTheodor Gottlieb von Hippel\n\nImmanuel Kant\n\nGotthold Ephraim Lessing\n\nMoses Mendelssohn\n\nCarl Leonhard Reinhold\n\nChristian Thomasius\n\nChristian Jacob Wagenseil\n\nChristian Felix Weiße\n\nChristoph Martin Wieland\n\nChristian Wolff\n\nFriedrich Nicolai\n\nChristian Garve\n\nSensibility[]\n\nEmpfindsamkeit / Sensibility (1750s-1770s) Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724–1803), Christian Fürchtegott Gellert (1715–1769), Sophie de La Roche (1730–1807). The period culminates and ends in Goethe's best-selling Die Leiden des jungen Werther (1774).\n\nSturm und Drang[]\n\nMain article: Sturm und Drang\n\nSturm und Drang (the conventional translation is \"Storm and Stress\"; a more literal translation, however, might be storm and urge, storm and longing, or storm and impulse) is the name of a movement in German literature and music taking place from the late 1760s through the early 1780s in which individual subjectivity and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in response to the confines of rationalism imposed by the Enlightenment and associated aesthetic movements. The philosopher Johann Georg Hamann is considered to be the ideologue of Sturm und Drang, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a notable proponent of the movement, though he and Friedrich Schiller ended their period of association with it, initiating what would become Weimar Classicism.\n\nGerman Classicism[]\n\nMain article: Weimar Classicism\n\nWeimar Classicism (German “Weimarer Klassik” and “Weimarer Klassizismus”) is a cultural and literary movement of Europe, and its central ideas were originally propounded by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller during the period 1788–1832.\n\n19th century[]\n\nRomanticism[]\n\nGerman Romanticism was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its English counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as German Classicism or Weimar Classicism, which it opposed. In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty. The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the Middle Ages as a simpler, more integrated period. As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking. Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. Heinrich Heine in particular criticized the tendency of the early romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.\n\nG.W.F. Hegel\n\nE.T.A. Hoffmann\n\nFriedrich Hölderlin\n\nHeinrich von Kleist\n\nNovalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg)\n\nFriedrich Schlegel\n\nAugust Wilhelm Schlegel\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher\n\nLudwig Tieck\n\nLudwig Uhland\n\nJoseph von Eichendorff\n\nTheodor Storm\n\nBiedermeier and Vormärz[]\n\nBiedermeier refers to work in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the years 1815 (Vienna Congress), the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and 1848, the year of the European revolutions and contrasts with the Romantic era which preceded it. Typical Biedermeier poets are Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, Adelbert von Chamisso, Eduard Mörike, and Wilhelm Müller, the last three named having well-known musical settings by Robert Schumann, Hugo Wolf and Franz Schubert respectively.\n\nYoung Germany (Junges Deutschland) was a loose group of Vormärz writers which existed from about 1830 to 1850. It was essentially a youth movement (similar to those that had swept France and Ireland and originated in Italy). Its main proponents were Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg; Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Börne and Georg Büchner were also considered part of the movement. The wider circle included Willibald Alexis, Adolf Glassbrenner and Gustav Kühne.\n\nRealism and Naturalism[]\n\nPoetic Realism (1848–1890)\n\nNaturalism (1880–1900)\n\n20th century[]\n\n1900 to 1933[]\n\nFin de siècle (c. 1900)\n\nSymbolism\n\nExpressionism (1910–1920)\n\nDada (1914–1924)\n\nNew Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit)\n\nNazi Germany[]\n\nNational Socialist literature: see Blut und Boden, Nazi propaganda\n\nUnder the Nazi regime, some authors went into exile (Exilliteratur) and others submitted to censorship (\"internal emigration\", Innere Emigration)\n\nInnere Emigration: Gottfried Benn, Werner Bergengruen, Hans Blüher, Hans Heinrich Ehrler, Hans Fallada, Werner Finck, Gertrud Fussenegger, Ricarda Huch, Ernst Jünger, Erich Kästner, Volker Lachmann, Oskar Loerke, Erika Mitterer, Walter von Molo, Friedrich Reck-Malleczewen, Richard Riemerschmid, Reinhold Schneider, Frank Thiess, Carl von Ossietzky, Ernst Wiechert\n\nin exile: Ernst Bloch, Bertolt Brecht, Hermann Broch, Alfred Döblin, Lion Feuchtwanger, Bruno Frank, A.
