        "text": "The University of Kassel (GhK) has awarded its Brothers Grimm Poetics Professorship for the winter semester 1995/96 to the poet Sarah Kirsch.\n\nThe award of the Grimm Professorship in 1996 follows numerous honors already bestowed upon Sarah Kirsch since she achieved early fame with her volumes of poetry Landaufenthalt (1967), Zaubersprüche (1973) and Rückenwind (1977).\n\nBorn in Limlingerode/Südharz on April 16, 1935, after graduating from high school, working in a sugar factory, studying biology and spending two years at the GDR's \"school of poetry,\" the Johannes R. Becher Institute of Literature, she began working as a freelance writer in 1965. Since her divorce from Rainer Kirsch (1968), she lived in East Berlin and worked simultaneously as a journalist, radio author and translator."
