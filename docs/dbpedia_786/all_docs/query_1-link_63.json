There are few details of his life known from 1600, when he first arrived in London, to 1606, when he completed his first literary works Fame's Memorial and Honour Triumphant. In 1601, he was residing at the Middle Temple, a complex of buildings which is one of the Inns of Court, the four associations of the barristers of England and Wales, but it is not known if Ford was studying for the bar, or was a just gentleman boarder. Financial difficulties got him expelled from the Middle Temple between 1606 and 1608, when he was readmitted. From 1620 onward, he concentrated on writing plays, and is best known for his 1633 tragedy 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, a family drama with brother-sister incest. Ford’s date of death is unknown, but is believed to have been in 1639.\n\nA Bridal Song\n\nby John Ford\n\n.\n\nComforts lasting, loves increasing,\n\nLike soft hours never ceasing;\n\nPlenty's pleasure, peace complying,\n\nWithout jars, or tongues envying;\n\nHearts by holy union wedded,\n\nMore than theirs by custom bedded;\n\nFruitful issues; life so graced,\n\nNot by age to be defaced;\n\nBudding as the year ensu'th,\n\nEvery spring another youth:\n\nAll what thought can add beside,\n\nCrown this Bridegroom and this Bride!\n\n.\n\n____________________________\n\nApril 18\n\n______________________________________\n\n1915 – Joy Davidman born in New York City, American poet, author, and novelist; her first book of poetry, Letter to a Comrade, won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition in 1938 and the Russell Loines Award for Poetry in 1939.

He was one of eight children in a poor family, and though a bright student, he dropped out of school at age 16, and worked as a shoe shiner before joining the army in 1947. He served in Korea as a medical technician until 1950, when he was seriously wounded. He became addicted to morphine. Coming back to the U.S., he was a drug dealer and thief to support his habit. In 1960, he was arrested for armed robbery, and sentenced to prison. There, he began writing poetry, and some of it was published in the Negro Digest, attracting the attention of established Black poets like Gwendolyn Brooks and Haki Madhubuti. Dudley Randall, poet and owner of Broadside Press, published Knight’s first verse collection, Poems from Prison, in 1968, coinciding with his release from prison. His second book, Black Voices from Prison was published in 1970. He earned a bachelor's degree in American poetry and criminal justice from Martin Center University in Indianapolis in 1990, and taught creative writing until he became too ill to continue. He died of lung cancer in 1991 just weeks before his 60th birthday.\n\nHe Sees Through Stone\n\nby Etheridge Knight\n\n.\n\nHe sees through stone\n\nhe has the secret eyes\n\nthis old black one\n\nwho under prison skies\n\nsits pressed by the sun\n\nagainst the western wall\n\nhis pipe between purple gums\n\n.\n\nthe years fall\n\nlike overripe plums\n\nbursting red flesh\n\non the dark earth\n\n.\n\nhis time is not my time\n\nbut I have known him\n\nin a time gone\n\n.\n\nhe led me trembling cold\n\ninto the dark forest\n\ntaught me the secret rites\n\nto make it with a woman\n\nto be true to my brothers\n\nto make my spear drink\n\nthe blood of my enemies\n\n.\n\nnow black cats circle him\n\nflash white teeth\n\nsnarl at the air\n\nmashing green grass beneath\n\nshining muscles\n\nears peeling his words\n\nhe smiles\n\nhe knows\n\nthe hunt the enemy\n\nhe has the secret eyes\n\nhe sees through stone\n\n.\n\n\"He Sees Through Stone\" from The Essential Etheridge Knight, © 1986 by Etheridge Knight – University of Pittsburgh Press\n\n_______________________\n\n.\n\n1947 [year disputed] – Kathy Acker born, American experimental novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and feminist writer; listening to stories of women whose lives were completely different from her own during her brief stint as a stripper in the mid-1970s had a profound impact on her understanding of gender and power relationships and on her early work. She had several long-term relationships with men and was married twice, but was openly bisexual. In 1979, she won the Pushcart Prize for her short story “New York City in 1979.” She wrote some of her most critically acclaimed works while in living in England in the 1980s, then returned to the U.S. as a visiting professor at several universities and colleges. In 1996, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and lost her faith in conventional medicine after an unsuccessful surgery. In 1997, she died in a Tijuana Mexico alternative cancer treatment clinic.\n\nthe diseased\n\nby Kathy Acker\n\n.\n\nI want all of you out there to shut up.\n\nI'm going to live the ways we want to live.\n\nWhat do you want of me now?\n\nLiver, blood, guts?\n\nThe only thing left is madness.\n\n.\n\nYou too’re gonna drive yourself to the pits:\n\nYou're gonna walk on coals through blazing fires:\n\nYou're gonna drink down the world's most painful poisons:\n\nThat's what wanting love is.\n\n.\n\nMy man isn't like other men.\n\nHe can keep you in prison.\n\nHe can make you do anything.\n\nI know why all of you want him.\n\n.\n\nBut worse, what happens\n\nif my Slave Trader\n\nfor some stupid reason\n\nhappens to like you?\n\n.\n\nThen you’re screwed:\n\nno more sleep\n\nNor will he let you keep your eyes.\n\nHe compulsions alone can fetter forces wildness.\n\nHow many times a spineless being you'll run to\n\n.\n\nall the weaky friends you formerly despised,\n\ntremulous sorrow will arise with tears shuddering\n\nwarts and pimples and fleas’ll appear on your skin\n\nall your wishes’ll go, words are no more,\n\nyou'll never again now who you are.\n\n.\n\nYou'll learn to serve him, girl, to be whatever he wants,\n\nto disappear whenever he wants you to go.\n\nYou'll learn why people who want, want to die\n\nwhy the whole world are lies.\n\nYour rich parents ain't helping:\n\ncause Love's more powerful than social climbing.\n\nBut if even small you have given footsteps of your failure\n\nhow quickly from such a reputation you will be a murmur!\n\nNot I then I will be able to comfort to bear to asking you\n\n.\n\n‘Cause I'm sick too.\n\nAt this point sicker than you.\n\nMy disease is forever.\n\nI know no comfort.\n\nSince we're both maniacs,\n\nlet’s be nice to each other.\n\nI myself want to live.\n\nI want to burn.\n\nall I ask is no one loves me\n\nin return.\n\n.\n\n“the diseased” from Blood and Guts in High School, © 1978 by Kathy Acker – Grove Press\n\n____________________________\n\nApril 20\n\n______________________________________\n\n1826 – Dinah Mulock Craik born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire; English novelist, poet, and author of biographical sketches of famous writers, who often used Mrs. Craik as her pen name. Her most popular novel was John Halifax, Gentleman, but she wrote dozens of articles and sketches and hundreds of poems for popular magazines of the day in order to support herself, and help her family. In 1858, A Woman's Thoughts about Women was published, a series of essays advocating for women being educated, so they would be capable of supporting themselves if they remained unmarried, or were widowed. She died of heart failure at age 61 in Shortlands, a London suburb.\n\nGreen Things Growing\n\nby Dinah M. Craik\n\n.\n\nO the green things growing, the green things growing,\n\nThe faint sweet smell of the green things growing!\n\nI should like to live, whether I smile or grieve,\n\nJust to watch the happy life of my green things growing.\n\n.\n\nO the fluttering and the pattering of those green things growing!\n\nHow they talk each to each, when none of us are knowing;\n\nIn the wonderful white of the weird moonlight\n\nOr the dim dreamy dawn when the cocks are crowing.\n\n.\n\nI love, I love them so - my green things growing!\n\nAnd I think that they love me, without false showing;\n\nFor by many a tender touch, they comfort me so much,\n\nWith the soft mute comfort of green things growing.\n\n.\n\nAnd in the rich store of their blossoms glowing\n\nTen for one I take they're on me bestowing:\n\nOh, I should like to see, if God's will it may be,\n\nMany, many a summer of my green things growing!\n\n.\n\nBut if I must be gathered for the angel's sowing,\n\nSleep out of sight awhile, like the green things growing,\n\nThough dust to dust return, I think I'll scarcely mourn,\n\nIf I may change into green things growing.\n\n.\n\n“Green Things Growing” from Poems of Dinah Maria Mulock Craik – Kessinger Publishing 2008 facisimile reprint\n\n____________________________\n\nApril 21\n\n______________________________________\n\n1816 – Charlotte Brontë born in Thornton, West Riding in Yorkshire; English novelist and poet, eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and wrote novels that became classics of English literature. Her father was an Irish Anglican clergyman, and the family lived in straightened circumstances. She is best known as the author of Jane Eyre, which was published in 1847, although it was originally published under the pseudonym Currer Bell. Several reviewers of the time criticized Jane Eyre for its unconventionalism, immorality, passionate exchanges, anti-authoritative and anti-Christian tendencies, and improbabilities within the storyline, even though some of them admitted the quality of the writing was remarkable. In 1848, Brontë released a preface with the second edition of Jane Eyre to defend the novel against criticism, while also acknowledging its success and thanking the press, public, and publishers. Charlotte Brontë was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage to Arthur Bell Nicholls in June 1854 but died on March 31, 1855, almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum, a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting.\n\nSpeak of the North!\n\nby Charlotte Brontë\n\n.\n\nSpeak of the North! A lonely moor\n\nSilent and dark and tractless swells,\n\nThe waves of some wild streamlet pour\n\nHurriedly through its ferny dells.\n\n.\n\nProfoundly still the twilight air,\n\nLifeless the landscape; so we deem\n\nTill like a phantom gliding near\n\nA stag bends down to drink the stream.\n\n.\n\nAnd far away a mountain zone,\n\nA cold, white waste of snow-drifts lies,\n\nAnd one star, large and soft and lone,\n\nSilently lights the unclouded skies.\n\n.\n\n_______________________\n\n.\n\n1930 – Hilda Hilst born, influential Brazilian author, poet, and playwright; noted for her poetry collection, Presságio (Omen), and her novels, Com meus olhos de cão (With My Dog Eyes) and A obscena senhora D (The Obscene Madame D).She died at age 73 of a chronic heart and pulmonary conditionin 2004.\n\nOf Desire\n\nby Hilda Hilst\n\n.\n\nBecause there is desire within me, everything glimmers.\n\nBefore, daily life was thinking of heights\n\nSeeking Another decanted\n\nDeaf to my human bark.\n\nSap and sweat, they never came to be.\n\nToday, flesh and bones, laborious, lascivious\n\nYou take my body. And what rest you give me\n\nAfter the readings. I dreamt of cliffs\n\nWhen there was a garden by my side.\n\nI thought of climbs where there were no signs.\n\nEcstatic, I fuck you\n\nInstead of yapping at Nothingness.\n\n.\n\n– translated by Lavinia Saad, Brazilian Poetry in Translation blogger\n\n____________________________\n\nApril 22\n\n______________________________________\n\n1943 – Louise Glück born in New York City and grew up on Long Island; American poet and essayist; winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for The Wild Iris; Library of Congress Special Bicentennial Consultant (2000-2002) and Poet Laureate (2003-2004); and 2014 National Book Award (Poetry) for Faithful and Virtuous Night. In 2020, she won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant who helped invent and market the X-Acto Knife. She attended Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University without graduating from either school. In her mid-twenties, she published her poetry collection Firstborn to mixed reviews. Glück has since published over a dozen collections which have been heaped with honors.\n\nThe Garment\n\nby Louise Glück\n\n.\n\nMy soul dried up.\n\nLike a soul cast into a fire, but not completely,\n\nnot to annihilation.
