        "text": "This anthology presents the winners of The Popescu European Poetry Translation Prize 2015, and includes stunning translations by both the winning and shortlisted translators, profiles of the translators, poets and publishers, and a commentary by the judges Clare Pollard and Olivia McCannon. Iain Galbraith was the winner of the 2015 prize with his translation of Self-Portrait with a Swarm of Bees by Jan Wagner. Shortlisted were: David Constantine and Tom Kuhn for Love Poems by Bertolt Brecht (Liveright); Anne Stokes for Ice Roses – Selected Poems by Sarah Kirsch (Carcanet); Ellen Doré Watson for The Mystical Rose by Adélia Prado (Bloodaxe); Susan Wicks for Talking Vrouz by Valérie Rouzeau (Arc), and Elzbieta Wójcik-Leese for Nothing More by Krystyna Milobedzka (Arc). The Popescu European Poetry Translation Prize is awarded biennially by The Poetry Society for a volume of poetry translated from a European language into English. The prize was supported in 2015 by the British Council."
