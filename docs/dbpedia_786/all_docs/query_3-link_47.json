        "text": "Apri 6, 2020\n\nBy the Wolfsonian team\n\nWell, it's April (finally). After a March that stretched on for what felt like 5 thousand years, we're at last in a new month, though our anxieties and the headlines are not any lighter. While the world continues to adjust to the era of coronavirus—working from home, socializing virtually, and limiting our spheres of movement—the Wolfsonian staff are taking stock of the many forms of cultural content that are helping us get through \"house arrest.\"\n\nBelow is some recommended reading, listening, watching, and playing so you can live your best #quarantinelife. Sharing is caring!\n\n📚 Books\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\n\nWritten by Michael Chabon, published 2000\n\n\"Set against the background of the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the Holocaust, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is both an origin story for the superhero comic book genre and a moving account of friendship and loss. Plus, it features a pivotal scene in the abandoned Perisphere, a futuristic structure built for the 1939 New York World’s Fair that is depicted over and over in The Wolfsonian's collection.\"\n\n- Jon Mogul, associate director of curatorial + education\n\nChasing Cézanne\n\nWritten by Peter Mayle, published 1997\n\n\"An upbeat read involving a state-of-the-art scam on the international art scene. From the south of France to the Bahamas, England, and New York, Mayle takes the reader through galleries, the homes of prominent collectors, and even restaurants in this delightful armchair-traveler detail.\"\n\n- Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nA Curiosity of Doubts\n\nWritten by T.L. Uglow, published 2016\n\n\"With rigor and whimsy in equal measure, the author (creative director for Google's Creative Lab in Sydney) explores the role and value of the unknown, innate and induced, in the practice of creativity.\"\n\n- Zoe Welch, education manager\n\nThe Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America\n\nWritten by Erik Larson, published 2003\n\n\"A world's fair and a serial killer combine for a page-turner. The story is about to be adapted for TV by Hulu, with Martin Scorcese and Leondaro DiCaprio producing.\"\n\n– Michael Hughes, development director\n\nThe Dutch House\n\nWritten by Ann Patchett, published 2019\n\n\"A 1920s mansion casts a dark cloud over one Philadelphia family.\"\n\n– Ian Rand, assistant director of marketing + partnerships\n\nThe Fountainhead\n\nWritten by Ayn Rand, published 1943\n\n\"A celebration of individual intellect, integrity, and willpower. It tells the story of a young architect, Howard Roark, and his unwavering vision for his buildings that are not supported by the establishment.\"\n\n- Leidiany Perez, office specialist\n\nGeorge Merrick, Son of the South Wind: Visionary Creator of Coral Gables\n\nWritten by Arva Moore Parks, published 2015\n\n\"A most brilliant overview of the history of one man’s vision in creating one of the great garden cities of the world.\"\n\n- Mitchell \"Micky\" Wolfson, Jr., founder\n\nIshmael\n\nWritten by Daniel Quinn, published 1992\n\n\"In this philosophic novel on sustainability and ethics, your teacher is none other than a speaking gorilla, who breaks down our cultural biases such as humanity's supremacy over the Earth and animal kingdoms.\"\n\n- Leidiany Perez, office specialist\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI\n\nWritten by David Grann, published 2017\n\n\"After being forced to live on 'worthless' Oklahoma land, the discovery of oil made the Osage Nation the wealthiest group of people in the world in the 1920s. Then, one by one, the Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances. It's a dark and wild chapter of U.S. history, in which the Osage and a fledgling FBI work together to unravel a sinister web of oil greed, corruption, and murder. Soon to be a film by Martin Scorsese, staring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro!\"\n\n- Erin Heffron, library collections specialist\n\nThe Master and Margarita\n\nWritten by Mikhail Bulgakov, published 1966–67 (posthumously)\n\n\"Wonderfully weird and dark, all the more so given the context of its production. Written in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Bulgakov between 1928 and 1940 but not published until 1967, long after his death, the book has a simple premise: what happens when the Devil visits the Soviet Union, an officially atheistic society? Humorous, absurd, and sometimes incredibly confusing, it's a novel that lends itself to endless rereading and re-interpretation.\"\n\n– Shoshana Resnikoff, curator\n\nOrigin\n\nWritten by Dan Brown, published 2017\n\n\"Edmond Kirsch, a billionaire philanthropist, futurist, and atheist, meets with world religious leaders to let them know that he has made a revolutionary discovery that he plans to release to the public. But before Kirsch can even complete his exclusive unveiling event at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, things start to go awry. Super-sleuth Robert Langdon and Guggenheim curator Ambra Vidal begin a quest to unlock Kirsch’s secret. Layered with modern art, hidden history, enigmatic symbols, and extreme religion, this mystery thriller will keep you guessing.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nDe Stille Kracht [The Hidden Force]\n\nWritten by Louis Couperus, published 1900\n\n\"Set in Java around 1900 during the Dutch colonial rule in the East Indies, De Stille Kracht [The Hidden Force] is a suggestive and sensual novel by Louis Couperus that conveys the tragedy of colonialism depicting the cultural gap between Western rationalism and a mystical local 'hidden force.'\n\nWe have several copies of this book in the Wolfsonian collection. Chris Lebeau, a versatile artist, designed beautiful batik cotton covers in several color variations, as well as a luxury version on velvet.\"\n\n- Silvia Barisione, senior curator\n\nStranger in a Strange Land\n\nWritten by Robert A. Heinlein, published 1961\n\n\"The story follows Valentine Michael Smith, a human who is born and raised on Mars and decides to travel to Earth. His arrival is monumental, and it shapes Earth (Terra) in unexpected ways.\"\n\n- Leidiany Perez, office specialist\n\n📺 TV\n\nAlta Mar [High Seas]\n\nNetflix, aired 2019–present\n\n\"Following the death of their father, two sisters travel on a luxury cruise ship sailing from Spain to Brazil in the 1940s. They share space on the elegant ocean liner with other well-to-do travelers, working class passengers, enigmatic stowaways, and, later, rescued castaways. The women quickly become enmeshed in the investigation of mysterious deaths at sea.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nBabylon Berlin\n\nNetflix, aired 2017–present\n\n\"A German neo-noir thriller. Much like Bob Fosse’s Cabaret (an all-time great on every level), Babylon Berlin explores the seedy underbelly and artistic explosion that was the Weimar Republic, 1929.\"\n\n– Ian Rand, assistant director of marketing + partnerships\n\nBelgravia\n\nEpix, premiered April 12, 2020\n\n\"The latest from Downton Abbey’s Julian Fellowes. For those who miss the Crowleys and company, many of London society’s juicy 19th-century scandals and secrets lie ahead!\"\n\n– Ian Rand, assistant director of marketing + partnerships\n\nBomb Girls\n\nAmazon Prime, aired 2012–13\n\n\"Set in the 1940s, this Canadian series profiles the stories of four women working in a munitions factory during World War II. The protagonists include two newcomers (a young socialite and a girl on the run) working to learn the ropes, a nurturing floor matron, and a tough but helpful veteran coworker. Besides highlighting the camaraderie and bonds these young women forge, Bomb Girls depicts the hardships of wartime life on the home front and shows how these women rise to the challenge.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nLa Casa de Papel [Money Heist]\n\nNetflix, aired 2017–present\n\n\"An absorbing Spanish crime drama about social and economic injustice.\"\n\n– Paola La Rivera, museum shop + box office manager\n\nLas Chicas del Cable [Cable Girls]\n\nNetflix, aired 2017–present\n\n\"This Madrid-based dramatic series focuses on the lives and friendship of four young women starting in the late 1920s and continuing through to the late 1930s, the time of the Spanish Civil War. The show highlights the introduction and development of switchboard-operated telephones and spotlights the struggles women faced in trying to rise—both personally and within the workforce—in a male-dominated society. For people who speak Spanish, this show is better enjoyed in its native language. Otherwise, it can easily be watched in various languages via dubbing or subtitles. One of several shows I recommend that tie into The Wolfsonian's collection through their historically detailed sets, costumes, and props.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nThe Crown\n\nNetflix, aired 2016–present\n\n\"I was surprised by how much I loved it. It moves slowly and is almost plotless, but the phenomenal performances, biting script, and gorgeous sets make it some of the most compelling TV out there.\"\n\n– Shoshana Resnikoff, curator\n\nThe Durrells in Corfu\n\nPBS, aired 2016–19\n\n\"The Durrells in Corfu follows a British widow with her 4 children as they move to the Greek island of Corfu in the 1930s. A comedy-drama, it’s based on Gerald Durrell's autobiographical book, My Family and Other Animals, published in 1956.\"\n\n– Johanny Ditren, senior visitor services associate\n\nThe English Game\n\nNetflix, premiered March 20, 2020\n\n\"Based on a true story, The English Game by Downtown Abbey creator Julian Fellowes explores class divisions in the early days of soccer in the 19th century.\"\n\n– Lisa Li, exhibitions manager\n\nGrantchester\n\nPBS, aired 2014–present\n\n\"One that I'm really vibing with right now: Grantchester, originally broadcast on British television and currently available in the U.S. on Amazon. It is, amazingly, about a country vicar who solves crimes with a hardbitten police detective in the small hamlet in post-Second World War England. It is just as goofy as it sounds, and I am here for it. Pure escapist fun is exactly what I need right now, and Grantchester gives it to me in spades (which, ironically, will probably end up being a murder weapon in a future episode).\"\n\n– Shoshana Resnikoff, curator\n\nHollywood\n\nNetflix, premiered May 1, 2020\n\n\"Could there be a better excuse to stay at home than Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series? I think not. Set in post-WWII Hollywood, a writer, director, and group of aspiring young actors set out to stake their claim in Tinseltown. Weaving historical characters such as Rock Hudson, Hattie McDaniel, Tallulah Bankhead, and Vivien Leigh through the narrative, this is old Hollywood glamour at its best, and the production design and costumes are worth the price of admission alone! So, sit back, enjoy, and don't feel any remorse about this guilty pleasure—there's a stay-at-home order in effect, you're just following the rules.\"\n\n– Ian Rand, assistant director of marketing + partnerships\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nAmazon Prime, aired 2014–19\n\n\"Based on Phillip K. Dick's novel, the show presents an alternative history in which the Axis powers won World War II rather than the Allies. In this universe, Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan have divided the U.S. into two territories separated by a neutral zone. The story follows characters whose destinies intertwine when they come into contact with mysterious and controversial films that show Germany and Japan losing the war.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nThe Plot Against America\n\nHBO, premiered March 16, 2020\n\n\"HBO has adapted Philip Roth's novel that squares right in with The Wolfsonian's collecting period. I loved The Plot Against America, an alternative history that proposes a different path for the United States if aviator Charles Lindbergh had challenged Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election and won. The show is written by David Simon, the creator of The Wire and another favorite of mine, Generation Kill, and I'm excited to see how he brings to life both the time period and Roth's vivid writing.\"\n\n– Shoshana Resnikoff, curator\n\nEl Tiempo Entre Costuras [The Time in Between]\n\nNetflix, aired 2013–14\n\n\"Based on Maria Dueñas' best-selling novel, this award-winning Spanish TV miniseries traces a young woman's life from simple but content seamstress in 1934 Madrid, to hard-times civil service typist and dutiful wife, to torrid affair and travels to Morocco. Eventually abandoned and robbed of her fortune by her lover, she is persuaded to return to Madrid during the Second World War, when she takes on a new identity and embarks upon her most dangerous post yet: espionage.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nUnorthodox\n\nNetflix, 2020\n\n\"Intense, insightful, and powerful miniseries based on Deborah Feldman's memoir, Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots. I watched it in one sitting.\"\n\n– Johanny Ditren, senior visitor services associate\n\n🎥 Movies\n\nDear Ruth\n\nDirected by William D. Russell, released 1947\n\n\"In this comedy of errors starring Joan Caulfield and William Holden, a politically-minded teenage girl has a WWII soldier as a pen pal. The only problem is, he thinks he's been talking to her older sister! Now the soldier has a two-day leave and he can’t wait to see his 'dear Ruth.' (Fun fact: If the last names of the main stars sound familiar, you've probably read The Catcher in the Rye. Author J.D. Salinger found inspiration for the name of his protagonist, Holden Caulfield, while walking by the movie’s marquee in New York.)\"\n\n– Sandra Solis Hazim, office manager + HR liaison\n\nDear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father\n\nDirected by Kurt Kuenne, released 2008\n\n\"One of the most painful and beautiful pieces of film I've ever seen, this documentary begins with the filmmaker attempting to document his late best friend's life for his infant son, Zachary. It starts as a meditation on friendship and loss and becomes something else entirely by the end. Avoid spoilers before you watch it, and prepare to be heartbroken and moved.\"\n\n– Shoshana Resnikoff, curator\n\nDestino\n\nDirected by Dominique Monféry, released 2003\n\n\"This 7-minute short film was nominated for an Oscar and is the winner of several other industry awards. Accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful title song by Mexican composer Armando Dominguez, the wordless animation depicts Greek god of time Chronos and his ill-fated love for a mortal woman named Dahlia, as she dances gracefully through dreamlike scenery inspired by surrealist paintings. Destino, which translates to 'destiny,' was originally storyboarded back in 1946 by painter Salvador Dalí and animator Walt Disney—a creative collaboration that resulted in lifelong friendship.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted: Designing America\n\nDirected by Lawrence Hott and Diane Garey, released 2014\n\n\"Olmsted designed the first major public parks in the U.S., notably Yosemite National Park and New York City's Central Park among them. He advanced the notion of public open spaces, and ultimately their role in personal and collective life, which we continue to experience 150 years on.\"\n\n– Zoe Welch, education manager\n\nHow to Steal a Million\n\nDirected by William Wyler, released 1966\n\n\"The daughter of an art forger feels she must steal a statue from a Paris museum in order to keep her father out of jail, so she hires a burglar. Alas, the burglar is really a detective with plans to arrest both daughter and father after the heist. Meanwhile, an American art collector seeks to woo the daughter and acquire the forger's works. Sprinkled with witty banter, this stylish, comedic caper shows that not all is as it appears.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nIl Giardino dei Finzi-Contini [The Garden of the Finzi-Continis]\n\nDirected by Vittorio De Sica, released 1970\n\n\"A memorable film. Set in the Italian city of Ferrara before the start of the Second World War, it tells the story of two siblings from an upper-class Jewish family, the Finzi-Continis, whose sheltered existence comes to an end after the promulgation of the racial laws by the Fascist Regime. Based on the semiautobiographical novel by Giorgio Bassani, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and the Berlin Golden Bear.\"\n\n– Silvia Barisione, senior curator\n\nThe Monuments Men\n\nDirected by George Clooney, released 2014\n\n\"Loosely based on Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter's 2007 non-fiction book The Monuments Men, this American-German action drama focuses on a World War II platoon tasked by then-president Franklin Delano Roosevelt with going into Germany to rescue artistic materpieces. Assisted by curator and French Resistance member Claire Simone (modeled on real-life Rose Valland), who provides a comprehensive ledger containing valuable and detailed information, the group is able to recover more than five million plundered works of art from Nazi thieves and return them to their rightful owners.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\nReap the Wild Wind\n\nDirected by Cecil B. DeMille, released 1942\n\n\"John Wayne trades his cowboy spurs for diving gear in this swashbuckling adventure tale, which takes place in Key West. A feisty female marine salvager, a talking dog, a fight scene with a giant octopus, and true love! Expect the unexpected.\"\n\n– Sandra Solis Hazim, office manager + HR liaison\n\nRebecca\n\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock, released 1940\n\n\"'Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again . . . .' That line never fails to thrill me. What seems to be a storybook romance soon finds itself engulfed in a much darker tale. What lies within the beautiful and palatial walls of Manderley is not what you expect; and neither is its former mistress. Also, this film has Laurence Olivier at his most Olivier!\"\n\n– Sandra Solis Hazim, office manager + HR liaison\n\nThe Square\n\nDirected by Ruben Östlund, released 2017\n\n\"This movie completely gets the life of a curator.

Ms. Altmann, already 82 at the time she filed the case, fought relentlessly not just to regain what was rightfully hers and keep alive her family's memories, but also to obtain some measure of justice for the death, destruction, and widespread art theft perpetrated by the Nazis. After many delays and complications, Maria was ultimately successful—winning back this and other family paintings by Klimt.\"\n\n– Marlene Tosca, art director\n\n🎙️ Podcasts\n\nThe Allusionist\n\nHosted by Helen Zaltzman, active 2015–present\n\n\"Why do we say the things we do?

It's fascinating to hear about life as a balloon or Sharpie—and of course, the entire philosophical and educational approach (that objects are windows into understanding their makers) is very Wolfsonian, and very Micky.\"\n\n– Meg Floryan, head of marketing + PR\n\nLaughter Permitted\n\nHosted by Julie Foudy, active 2019–present\n\n\"Who says women aren't into sports?

Choreographer Martha Graham commissioned Copland to create an American-themed score (if you listen carefully, you'll hear inspiration from an 1848 Shaker melody, 'Simple Gifts'). Graham danced the lead role, Isamu Noguchi designed the ballet sets, and Copland's score won a Pulitzer Prize for music.\"\n\n– Lea Nickless, research curator\n\nBetter Things (Soundtrack)\n\nReleased 2016–20\n\n\"How do you pull together dancehall, Dixieland ragtime, vintage blues and classic rock ballads, gospel rap and gypsy swing, and today's hip-hop and neo-folk? With Better Things.

You can hear that in the recordings of the Duke Ellington Orchestra, one of the most talented groups of musicians ever assembled.\"\n\n– Jon Mogul, associate director of curatorial + education\n\nPines of Rome\n\nComposed by Ottorino Respighi, premiered 1924\n\n\"Respighi's 1924 symphonic poem soars and uplifts. You can't help but picture magestic trees lining the streets of ancient Rome (or, if you're a fan of Disney's Fantasia 2000, scenes of flying whales swimming up to the northern lights!).\"\n\n– Meg Floryan, head of marketing + PR\n\nSidney Bechet\n\nAmerican musician, 1897–1959\n\n\"My WFH soundtrack. He's very 'trumpet forward,' and apparently other trumpeters hated playing alongside him. Still, his music strikes the right balance of energetic and relaxing for these strange days, especially as I'm working from home and need some music to disappear into.\"\n\n– Shoshana Resnikoff, curator\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (Soundtrack)\n\nIssued by MGM records, released 1956\n\n\"You may not have watched The Wizard of Oz since you were a kid. And there’s plenty of competition for streaming content right now. But even if you don’t rewatch the movie, the soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own—inspired word-play from lyricist Yip Harburg, gorgeous melodies composed by Harold Arlen, and moving singing by the whole cast.
