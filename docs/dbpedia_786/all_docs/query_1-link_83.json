        "text": "For other uses, see Leipzig (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Saxony, Germany\n\nLeipzig ( LYPE-sig, -⁠sikh,[4][5][6][7] German: [ˈlaɪptsɪç] ⓘ; Upper Saxon: Leibz'sch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. The city has a population of 628,718 inhabitants as of 2023.[8] It is the eighth-largest city in Germany and is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region. The name of the city is usually interpreted as a Slavic term meaning place of linden trees, in line with many other Slavic placenames in the region.[9]\n\nLeipzig is located about 150 km (90 mi) southwest of Berlin, in the southernmost part of the North German Plain (the Leipzig Bay), at the confluence of the White Elster and its tributaries Pleiße and Parthe, that form an extensive inland delta in the city known as Leipziger Gewässerknoten [de], along which Leipzig Riverside Forest, Europe's largest intra-city riparian forest has developed. Leipzig is at the centre of Neuseenland (new lake district), consisting of several artificial lakes created from former lignite open-pit mines.\n\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire.[10] The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig's trade fair dates back to 1190. Between 1764 and 1945, the city was a centre of publishing.[11] After the Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East Germany, but its cultural and economic importance declined.[11]\n\nEvents in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy (which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry), severe unemployment, and urban blight. By the early 2000s the trend had reversed, and since then Leipzig has undergone some significant changes, including urban and economic rejuvenation, and modernisation of the transport infrastructure.[12][13]\n\nLeipzig is home to one of the oldest universities in Europe (Leipzig University). It is the main seat of the German National Library (the second is Frankfurt), the seat of the German Music Archive, as well as of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and as of 2018 ranks first in Germany and second in Europe.[14]\n\nLeipzig's late-19th-century Gründerzeit architecture consists of around 12,500 buildings.[15][16] The city's central railway terminus Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is, at 83,460 square metres (898,400 sq ft), Europe's largest railway station measured by floor area. Since Leipzig City Tunnel came into operation in 2013, it has formed the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland (S-Bahn Central Germany) public transit system, Germany's largest S-Bahn network, with a system length of 802 km (498 mi).[17]\n\nLeipzig has long been a major centre for music, including classical and modern dark wave. The Thomanerchor (English: St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig), a boys' choir, was founded in 1212. The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Several well-known composers lived and worked in Leipzig, including Johann Sebastian Bach (1723 to 1750) and Felix Mendelssohn (1835 to 1847). The University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\" was founded in 1843. The Oper Leipzig, one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany, was founded in 1693. During a stay in Gohlis, which is now part of the city, Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\".\n\nNames\n\n[edit]\n\nAn older spelling of Leipzig in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used.[18]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Leipzig is commonly held to derive from lipa, the common Slavic designation for linden trees, making the city's name etymologically related to Liptetsk, Russia and Liepaja, Latvia. Based on medieval attestations like Lipzk (c. 1190), the original Slavic name of the city has been reconstructed as *Lipьsko, which is also reflected in similar forms in neighbouring modern Slavic languages (Sorbian/Polish Lipsk, Czech Lipsko). This has, however, been questioned by more recent onomastic research based on the very oldest forms like Libzi (c. 1015).[19]\n\nEpithets\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the etymology mentioned above, Lindenstadt or Stadt der Linden (City of Linden Trees) are common poetic epithets for the city.[20]\n\nAnother, somewhat old-fashioned epithet is Pleiß-Athen (Athens on the Pleiße River), hinting at Leipzig's long academic and literary tradition, as the seat of one of the oldest German universities and a centre of the book trade.[21]\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Reich Trade Fair City Leipzig).[22]\n\nIn 1989 Leipzig was dubbed a Hero City (Heldenstadt), alluding to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War, in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime.[23]\n\nMore recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed Hypezig, the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", or \"The better Berlin\" (Das bessere Berlin) and is celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for its vibrant lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.[24][25][26][27]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nLeipzig is located in the Leipzig Bay, the southernmost part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The city sits on the White Elster, a river that rises in the Czech Republic and flows into the Saale south of Halle. The Pleiße and the Parthe join the White Elster in Leipzig, and the large inland delta-like landscape the three rivers form is called Leipziger Gewässerknoten. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riparian Forest (Leipziger Auenwald), though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat, though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\n\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-pit mines in the region, many of which have been converted to lakes.[28] Also see: Neuseenland\n\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east–west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial highway), a north–south road.\n\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\nSubdivision\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten Stadtbezirke (boroughs), which in turn contain a total of 63 Ortsteile (localities). Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\nStadtbezirke of Leipzig Stadtbezirk Pop.

Winters are cold, with an average temperature of around 1 °C (34 °F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 °C (66 °F) with daytime temperatures of 24 °C (75 °F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours per day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours per day).[32]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Leipzig.\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Margraviate of Meissen and Electorate of Saxony\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronicon, VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\n\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Pleiße that, most likely, refer to Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.[35]\n\nThere were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfußgäßchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranstädter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\n\nThe University of Leipzig was founded in 1409 and Leipzig developed into an important centre of German law and of the publishing industry in Germany, resulting, in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library being located here.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 km (5 mi) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\n\nOn 24 December 1701, when Franz Conrad Romanus was mayor, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.[36]\n\nWhen it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\n\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements.[37] The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gründerzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Yearly production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.[38]\n\nDuring World War I, in 1917, the American Consulate was closed, and its building became a temporary place of stay for Americans and Allied refugees from Serbia, Romania and Japan.[39]\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\n\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He later became an opponent of the Nazi regime.[40] He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\n\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.[41]\n\nLike all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenhäuser, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.[41]\n\nThe Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures.[41]\n\nOn 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\".[22] In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began.[41] On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.[41][42] The Polish Consulate sheltered 1,300 Polish Jews, preventing their deportation.[43]\n\nOn 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse, synagogues and businesses were set on fire.[41] Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp.[44] As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.[45]\n\nIn 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported.[41] On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz concentration camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt concentration camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.[41][46]\n\nDuring the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, in September 1939, the Gestapo carried out arrests of prominent local Poles,[47] and seized the Polish Consulate and its library.[43] In 1941, the American Consulate was also closed by order of the German authorities.[39] During the war, Leipzig was the location of five subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp, in which over 8,000 men, women and children were imprisoned, mostly Polish, Jewish, Soviet and French, but also Italian, Czech and Belgian.[48] In April 1945, most surviving prisoners were sent on death marches to various destinations in Saxony and German-occupied Czechoslovakia, whereas prisoners of the Leipzig-Thekla subcamp who were unable to march were either burned alive, shot or beaten to death by the Gestapo, SS, Volkssturm and German civilians in the Abtnaundorf massacre.[49][50] Some were rescued by Polish forced laborers of another camp; at least 67 people survived.[49][50] 84 victims were buried on 27 April 1945, however, the total number of victims remains unknown.[49][50]\n\nDuring World War II, Leipzig was repeatedly struck by Allied bombing raids, beginning in 1943 and lasting until 1945. The first raid occurred on the morning of 4 December 1943, when 442 bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropped a total amount of almost 1,400 tons of explosives and incendiaries on the city, destroying large parts of the city centre.[51] This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, they were unable to control the fires. Unlike the firebombing of the neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\n\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945.[52] In April 1945, the Mayor of Leipzig, SS-Gruppenführer Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter, together with Deputy Mayor and City Treasurer Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter and Volkssturm Major and former Mayor Walter Dönicke, all committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\n\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.[41][53] They were joined by large numbers of German refugees who had been expelled from Central and Eastern Europe in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.[54]\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\n\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in East Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make matters worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in.[55] Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.[13]\n\nIn October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government.[56][57] The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's specialty was, in terms of the advanced economy of reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished.[13] As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunification, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.[13]\n\nStarting in 2000, an ambitious urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's population decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving the city's attractive historic downtown area and particularly its early 20th century building stock, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement. However, the renewal has led to gentrification of parts of the city and has not arrested the decline of Leipzig-East.[55][13]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nLeipzig is an important economic centre in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre with a very high quality of living.[58][59][60] It is often called \"The new Berlin\".[61] Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city.[62] Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013.[63] Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nMayor\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Hinrich Lehmann-Grube of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), who served from 1990 to 1998. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. Wolfgang Tiefensee, also of the SDP, served from 1998 until his resignation in 2005 to become federal Minister of Transport. He was succeeded by fellow SPD politician Burkhard Jung, who was elected in January 2006 and re-elected in 2013 and 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 2 February 2020, with a runoff held on 1 March, and the results were as follows:\n\nCandidate Party First round Second round Votes % Votes % Sebastian Gemkow Christian Democratic Union 72,427 31.6 107,611 47.6 Burkhard Jung Social Democratic Party 68,286 29.8 110,965 49.1 Franziska Riekewald The Left 31,036 13.5 Katharina Krefft Alliance 90/The Greens 27,481 12.0 Christoph Neumann Alternative for Germany 19,854 8.7 Katharina Subat Die PARTEI 5,467 2.4 Marcus Viefeld Free Democratic Party 2,739 1.2 Ute Elisabeth Gabelmann Pirate Party Germany 2,089 0.9 7,542 3.3 Valid votes 229,379 99.6 226,118 99.5 Invalid votes 822 0.4 1,235 0.5 Total 230,201 100.0 227,353 100.0 Electorate/voter turnout 469,225 49.1 469,269 48.4 Source: Wahlen in Sachsen Archived 12 May 2021 at the Wayback Machine\n\nCity council\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most recent city council election was held on 26 May 2019, and the results were as follows:\n\nParty Votes % +/- Seats +/- The Left (Die Linke) 171,423 21.4 2.8 15 3 Alliance 90/The Greens (Grüne) 165,683 20.7 5.7 15 4 Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 140,585 17.5 7.5 13 6 Alternative for Germany (AfD) 119,616 14.9 8.5 11 7 Social Democratic Party (SPD) 99,022 12.4 5.9 9 4 Free Democratic Party (FDP) 38,481 4.8 1.9 3 1 Die PARTEI (PARTEI) 30,764 3.8 2.7 2 2 Voters Association Leipzig (WVL) 20,369 2.5 0.7 1 ±0 Pirate Party Germany (Piraten) 11,512 1.4 0.5 1 ±0 Leipzigers for Basic Income 4,297 0.5 New 0 New Valid votes 274,916 98.7 Invalid votes 3,751 1.3 Total 278,667 100.0 70 ±0 Electorate/voter turnout 466,442 59.7 17.9 Source: Wahlen in Sachsen Archived 12 May 2021 at the Wayback Machine\n\nBundestag\n\n[edit]\n\nLeipzig is represented in the Bundestag by three constituencies; Leipzig I, Leipzig II, and Leipzig-Land.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%15079,000— 160020,000+122.2%175035,000+75.0%185266,686+90.5%1875127,387+91.0%1890295,025+131.6%1900456,124+54.6%1910589,850+29.3%1920620,000+5.1%1930718,200+15.8%1935699,300−2.6%1940709,100+1.4%1945581,528−18.0%1955613,707+5.5%1960589,632−3.9%1965595,660+1.0%1970583,885−2.0%1980562,480−3.7%1990511,079−9.1%1995470,778−7.9%2001493,052+4.7%2011502,979+2.0%2022598,899+19.1%Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. Source for 2001-2022: [64]\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 620,000.[65] In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000.[66] As of 2015 , Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.[67] The growth of the past 10–15 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.[68]\n\nIn the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994.[69] However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of −17.7 (−393.7 in 1995).[70]\n\nThe unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.[71][72][73]\n\nThe percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012 , only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.[74]\n\nThe number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).[75]\n\nThe largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31 December 2021 are:[76]\n\nRank Ancestry Total Foreigners Germans 1 Ukraine 11,768 10,022 1,746 2 Syria 9,059 8,523 536 3 Russia 8,773 3,214 5,559 4 Poland 5,019 3,006 2,013 5 Romania 4,161 3,675 486 6 Vietnam 3,930 2,403 1,527 7 Turkey 2,820 1,800 1,020 8 Iraq 2,816 2,104 712 9 Kazakhstan 2,244 246 1,998 10 Afghanistan 2,171 1,916 255 11 Italy 1,983 1,564 419 12 Hungary 1,814 1,349 465 13 Bulgaria 1,615 1,238 377 14 France 1,594 1,066 528 15 India 1,537 1,309 232\n\nCulture, sights and cityscape\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2010s, Leipzig was often referred to as Hypezig, as overblown comparisons were made to 1990s and early 2000s Berlin. The affordability, diversity and openness of the city have attracted many young people from across Europe, leading to a trendsetting alternative atmosphere, resulting in an innovative music, dance and art scene.[77]\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gründerzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\n\nSome 90,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany.[78] and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, a significant minority of people are still living in Plattenbau accommodation; Grünau, for example, had about 43,600 people living in this sort of accommodation in 2016.[79]\n\nThe St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\n\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\nTallest buildings and structures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk Bösdorf GmbH with a height of 205 m (673 ft). With 142 m (466 ft), the tallest building in Leipzig is the City-Hochhaus Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\nBuildings and structures Image Height in metres Year Notes Chimney of Stahl- und Hartgusswerk Bösdorf GmbH 205 1984 Funkturm Leipzig 191 2015 DVB-T-Sendeturm 190 1986 Demolished in 2023 after loss of function. 4 x Wind turbine Nordex N100 190 2013 City-Hochhaus Leipzig 142 1972 Total height 153 m, headquarters of European Energy Exchange.

This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School[80] of artists. According to The New York Times,[81] this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.[82]\n\nThe Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections:[83] the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.[84]\n\nFounded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection.[85] This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School.

After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\nRailways\n\n[edit]\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof (lit. main station) is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the Intercity-Express (ICE) and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\n\nIn Leipzig the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg–)Berlin–Leipzig–Nuremberg–Munich and Dresden–Leipzig–Erfurt–Frankfurt am Main–(Wiesbaden/Saarbrücken) intersect. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)–Magdeburg–Hannover–Dortmund–Köln and –Bremen–Oldenburg(–Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\n\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via three S-Bahn lines, two of which run via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\n\nThe city's railway connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h (120 mph) since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h (190 mph), was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg followed in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network considerably reduced the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long city tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\n\nThere are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\nSuburban trains\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Wurzen, Zwickau, Dessau, and Lutherstadt Wittenberg. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north–south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\nTramway and buses\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Trams in Leipzig\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 15 tram lines and 47 bus lines in the city.\n\nThe total length of the tram network is 146 km (91 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (134.4 km (83.5 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (196 km (122 mi)).\n\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\n\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\nBicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990. According to the data from the 2021/22 traffic count, the Saxons' Bridge has the highest traffic occupancy with over 15,000 cyclists per day in cycling in Leipzig.[145]\n\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\nRoad\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west, and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction.\n\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, and B 184 lead through the city area.\n\nThe ring road (Innenstadtring), which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\n\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\n\nLeipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with vehicle for hire services that can be booked via a mobile app. In contrast to taxicab services, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\nLong-distance buses\n\n[edit]\n\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\n\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\n\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\n\nPassenger flights are operated to and from the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially to the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\n\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia, called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport, about a half-hour drive from Leipzig, was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\nWater\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster, and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl Heine Canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Pleiße, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\n\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. A link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port was opened in 2015. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\nTram of Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe\n\nTramsystem at the Georg-Schumann-Straße\n\nLeipzig City Tunnel, part of Leipzig's new S-Bahn network\n\nInside the S-Bahn train\n\nQuotations\n\n[edit]\n\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!
