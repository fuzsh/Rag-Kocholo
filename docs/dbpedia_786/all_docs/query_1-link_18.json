Siobhan Chapman and Billy Clark (eds.) Amsterdam: John Benjamins. Sarah Kirsch’s 1982 poem “Naturschutzgebiet” (Nature Reserve) textually excavates the geographical space upon which a portion of the Berlin Wall stood. Through the use of metonymical references to features of the past and present landscape, the fifteen-line poem is dense with words that seem to simultaneously index multiple moments in the history of this place. For readers privy to these references, this potentially creates a poetic texture (Stockwell, 2009) characterized by the layering of text worlds (Gavins, 2007) corresponding to actual worlds, which overlap in space but not in historical time. A key pragmatic effect for many readers is a range of stronger and weaker socially critical implicatures related to the Berlin Wall and the East German regime that built it. Kirsch’s poem provides an ideal case study for how cognitive-pragmatic theories of metonymy can help us to understand how readers’ experiences of poetic texts are connected to their conceptualization of past and present social and physical realities and how this in turn can result in socially critical implicatures. While cognitive poetic models of texture and text world theory provide models for understanding the role of metonymy as a world building element, pragmatic theories of implicature and relevance conceptualize its potential effects within a broader account of utterance interpretation. In what follows, I summarize models of texture and text world theory from cognitive poetics, before turning to a discussion of metonymy. I will briefly introduce cognitive linguistic and relevance theoretic approaches to metonymy, before turning to the cognitive-pragmatic framework that will be the focus of this chapter. I will then analyse Sarah Kirsch’s poem as an example of a text that relies heavily on metonymy in the enactment of and manipulation of past and present realities. Based on this analysis, I will argue that cognitive linguistic models of metonymy and cognitive poetic models of text worlds can help us to describe the types of mapping that occur as a reader experiences the poem, but to account for the ambivalent socially critical implicatures inferred by some readers requires a pragmatic theory of relevance."
