        "text": "Axel Goodbody, Bath\n\nThis paper asks what has become of the distinctive tradition of GDR landscape poetry since reunification. It examines the representation of the physical changes which have come over the East German landscape in the work of older and younger poets, and considers the extent to which they provide objective correlatives for the socio-political and cultural changes experienced since 1989. The role played by landscape poetry in identity construction is also discussed. The past, travel and Heimat are themes associated with a new critical regionalism in the new Länder founded on personal and collective, local and East German experience. The principal focus is on the poems of Volker Braun, Heinz Czechowski, Wulf Kirsten and Thomas Rosenlöcher, but reference is also made to texts by younger contemporaries such as Kurt Drawert, Durs Grünbein and Michael Wüstefeld.\n\n1. The Landscape Poem as a genre articulating responses to social transformation\n\nVeränderte Landschaft was the title of an anthology of GDR landscape poetry published by the Insel Verlag in 1979. Its editor, Wulf Kirsten, paid tribute to his former teacher at the Johannes R Becher Literature Institute in Leipzig, Georg Maurer, by opening the volume with Maurers poem Veränderte Landschaft, which expressed the feeling of a new beginning at the end of the Second World War, and adopting the phrase to denote a poetic programme celebrating the transformation of society in the GDR under socialism. This new socialist nature poetry focused on the working and shaping of the natural environment; the landscape is witness to the process of human self-realisation through interaction with nature, in agriculture and industry. While not himself a particularly distinguished poet, Maurer was a perceptive essayist and an influential teacher, who grounded a generation of East German writers in poetic tradition. The landscape poetry of what has become known as the Sächsische Dichterschule, a loose grouping whose members included Volker Braun, Heinz Czechowski, Sarah Kirsch, Wulf Kirsten, Kito Lorenc and other less well-known writers writing from the 1960s to the 1980s, built on the work of the earlier social nature poets Theodor Kramer, Peter Huchel and Johannes Bobrowski, and the critical realism of prose writers on the provinces such as Oskar Maria Graf. At the same time, it engaged in a critical dialogue with Klopstock and Hölderlin, Schiller and Goethe, making it clear that the encounter with nature and the farming landscape (Kulturlandschaft) continued to serve as a vehicle for the articulation of personal feelings and circumstances, and to prompt reflection on society and politics, however much their understanding of nature differed from that of their eighteenth and nineteenth-century predecessors.\n\nThe process through which this socialist nature poetry, a distinctive phenomenon without genuine equivalent in West Germany, Austria or Switzerland, developed into a medium of political dissidence has been described elsewhere (see Berendse 1990 and Emmerich 1990). In the course of the 1970s industrial pollution and the environmental damage resulting from open-cast mining and collectivised agriculture found their way into poems with increasing frequency. The disappearance of the familiar landscapes associated with traditional farming and forestry was lamented increasingly openly as damaging to the environment and detrimental to the lives of the people, but the real significance of the change lay in its metaphorical implications. Disillusionment with the Marxist-Leninist ideology of progress, a process in which social and political advances were seen to go automatically hand in hand with science, technology and economic growth, found expression initially in ambivalences and wistful phrases, and later in apocalyptic visions conveying a massive critique of contemporary society.\n\nThe lyric Abfallandschaften (Heukenkamp 1981: 249) of the 1980s were realistic descriptions and simultaneously emblems of political stagnation and individual alienation. How far beyond the mere documentation of everyday socio-political reality they could go may be seen in the obscure, but suggestive poems published in the West under the title abwesenheit by the ex-coal miner Wolfgang Hilbig, which allude to the decaying industrial wasteland around his home in Meuselwitz, South of Leipzig (Hilbig 1979). Twenty years later, Lutz Seiler published similarly laconic and demanding, but equally fascinating, many-layered poems evoking personal traumas associated with the environmental damage and sense of political oppression in the final decade in the GDR (Seiler 2000). The title of his poetry volume, pech und blende, alluded, via pitchblende, to the notorious Thuringian uranium mines, while implying the ecological blindness and destruction involved in their operation. (The village he grew up in disappeared in their path.) Durs Grünbein, probably the best-known younger poet from East Germany today, also depicted the landscape of his childhood on the periphery of Dresden as a Grauzonenlandschaft in the volumes Grauzone Morgens (1988) and Schädelbasislektion (1991). In a poem written in the early 1990s he recalls how he gazed longingly at the aeroplanes passing overhead:\n\nGezeugt im verwunschenen Teil eines Landes\n\nMit Grenzen nach innen, war er Märchen gewöhnt,\n\nGrausamkeit. [ ]\n\nHinter den Hügeln, gespenstisch, zog den Schluß-\n\nStrich kein Horizont, nur ein rostiger Sperrzaun.\n\nLandeinwärts gehegte Leere. Sein Biotop, früh\n\nWar ein riesiger Müllberg, von Bulldozern\n\nAufgeworfen, am Stadtrand. Ein Manöverfeld,\n\nNaßkalter Sand, übersät mit Autoreifen und Schrott,\n\nDazu ein schillernder Teich, eine Einflugschneise,\n\nEin dürres Wäldchen. (Grünbein 1994: 58, lines 1-3 and 7-14)\n\nThe citizens of the GDR are presented as living under an evil spell, at the mercy of political lies and cruelty. They are imprisoned in a habitat of decay and emptiness, surrounded by rubbish dumps, polluted ponds and crippled trees. The reference to a military exercise area reinforces the link between environmental degradation and the repression of individual self-realisation.\n\nThis paper is not, however, concerned with poems recalling such scenes, but with poetic responses to a third major change to the East German landscape in the last half century, after socialist transformation and ruthless industrial exploitation: the consequences of the impact of unification in 1990. After a brief discussion of the environmental situation in the new Länder today, and the role played by writers in publicising environmental issues and constructing new, regional identities in East Germany, I examine a selection of post-Wende poems. My choice is guided by a preference for short poems, so they can be quoted in full, general accessibility and the aim to address three questions: firstly, how the new social and political order is characterised through depiction of the change in the rural and urban landscape, secondly, what function the individuals encounter with these landscapes serves in constructing a post-Wende identity, and finally, what particular contribution poetry has made to this process.\n\n2. Recent changes in the East German landscape\n\nWhat has become of the blühende Landschaften famously promised to the people of East Germany by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the winter of 1989? Positive developments in the new Länder have included the clean-up of polluted industrial sites and the regeneration of industry, agricultural reform and the revitalisation of backward rural areas (Zschiesche 2003). Borders and other physical barriers have been removed, military exclusion areas returned to normal civilian use, new national parks and nature reserves created for the enjoyment and benefit of all. But there have equally been less welcome aspects of change: urban sprawl and poorly planned development, a huge increase in the volume of traffic and associated pollution, insensitive standardisation, and the advent of advertising and other outward signs of commercialisation. In a recent rather gloomy article on the state of the environment and the environmental movement in East Germany, Michael Zschiesche notes the impressive success of the clean-up operation undertaken in the 1990s: between 1990 and 2000 sulphur dioxide and dust emissions were reduced by 94 and 99% respectively, and the condition of the East German forests has improved correspondingly. However, the change is largely a result of the closing down of dirty industries. The old, visible pollution has to a certain extent been replaced by new pollutants and forms of environmental damage (Zschiesche 2003: 37).\n\nReunification has imported the unsolved structural problems of the social market economy. East Germans, once models in recycling and the sparing use of resources, now produce more per capita waste than their neighbours in the West, and the shift from public transport to private cars has led to a dramatic increase in noise and the related forms of atmospheric pollution. At the same time, the relaxation of planning legislation to allow rapid commercial development has resulted in irreparable damage to towns and the countryside. Scandalous exceptions to building restrictions have been granted in nature reserves. Interest in the environment waned rapidly after 1990. The dynamism of the GDR environmental movement with its various official and unofficial home-grown organisations in the late 1980s did not survive the process of reorganisation into NGOs along West German and international lines. The countrys considerable environmental problems were tackled largely from above, by West German experts, and any remaining concerns of the disempowered public were swiftly displaced by more urgent economic ones.\n\n3. Writers, environmental activism, and identity construction in East Germany\n\nIn the years leading up to 1989, a sizeable number of GDR writers were involved in the Literatur um Welt working group within the Writers Union (see Goodbody 1994). Others, including such internationally known figures as Christa Wolf, Volker Braun and Heiner Müller, also participated in environmental debates, drawing attention to the wretched environmental situation in poetic elegies, dramatic scenarios and satirical or apocalyptic narratives. After the Wende, the social importance of their concern received a measure of official recognition in the Erwin Strittmatter Prize for Environmental Literature awarded annually by the Brandenburg State government (see Pietraß 2000), and environmental issues have featured prominently in the programme of the Academy of the Arts in Saxony. To what extent do post-Wende poems reveal a continuation of such concerns? Do recent poetic landscapes reflect the social consequences of political and economic change, e.g. unemployment and shifting ownership patterns? And what links are there between landscapes and the new, precarious economic position and social standing of the writer?\n\nThe second and third of these questions, which I will attempt to address with reference to relevant texts below, raise the issue of the use of landscape as a metaphor, and of the poem as a vehicle for the poets self-definition through analogies between the landscape and the poets individual situation  analogies which may of course be applicable to a wider public. This assumes particular importance for GDR citizens, who were plunged into an identity crisis by unification with the Federal Republic. As Gabrielle Zimmer, who succeeded Gregor Gysi as Leader of the PDS in 2000, expressed it in an interview:\n\nIch bin auf der Suche nach einer neuen Identität. Man kann Thüringerin, Europäerin, Weltbürgerin sein, wie man will  für mich gibt es darüber hinaus eine nationale Identität. [ ] Ich [ ] hatte eine durchaus positives Verhältnis zur DDR. Ich habe mich zu ihr als meinem Land bekannt. Jetzt, wo es sie nicht mehr gibt, bin ich ein bißchen auf der Suche nach einem Ersatz. (Tageszeitung, 28 October, 2000, p.3. Quoted in Thompson 2002: 125)\n\nThe loss of the State they had hitherto identified with was compounded by the demise of the Party which had provided a powerful ideological focus, leaving behind a vacuum and the need for new sources of self-identification, as Gisela Brinker-Gabler has argued in a thoughtful article on Writing (East) Postunification Identity in Germany (Brinker-Gabler 1997). The transition from GDR to German nationality left East Germans displaced spiritually and mentally, and dislocated from their history and culture. The prevailing view in the West that their efforts to create a true socialist society were worthless, and the denial that they had a positive contribution to make to the new Germany, meant they were marginalised  especially those writers and intellectuals who had held fast to the ideas of a Third Way (socialism with a human face) in the autumn of 1989. Writers experienced mixed feelings, finding themselves in positions which can be located on a sliding scale between the extremes of the immigrant (i.e. enthusiastically embracing the new host culture) and the exile (suffering from rupture from the original culture).\n\nIf they were to avoid idealising the past, looking back at the GDR nostalgically as a sphere of stability, and forgetting the price that had been paid for this in terms of individual liberty, writers were forced to adopt one of two strategies. While some made a radical break with the utopian socialism they had previously regarded it as the purpose of their writing to promote (Helga Königsdorf serves Brinker-Gabler as an example), others sought to make creative use of the interstitial space between the old East and the new unified State. (Brinker-Gablers example is Christa Wolf.)\n\nOne way forward for East Germans, Brinker-Gabler writes, has lain in the redefinition of identity by recollecting and rearticulating the past. For many, unification meant their past was taken from them, appropriated and devalued by the West, undermining their self-worth. Writing is a form of resistance against this: it remembers and constructs, through a blend of reality and imagination, recall and fictional narrative, a history which legitimises their experiences and those of their readers.\n\nA second theme related to identity construction is travel. Journeys, literal and metaphorical, for instance in the form of imaginary dialogues with an alternative community of geographically distant contemporaries and figures from the past, facilitate a process of self-questioning and provide orientation.\n\nA third way forward has been the rediscovery of Heimat. Not, needless to say, through idealisation of happier times in the past and their commodification in nostalgic Heimat discourse, but rather through identification with a geographical area and community, and the development of a self-understanding of which these form a part. In post-Wende East Germany, Brinker-Gabler argues, identifications have more often been local and international than national. The new, unified German State did not constitute an entity with which East Germans identified emotionally. However, the demise of the GDR opened up possibilities of situated meaning and emotional belonging which had been suppressed in forty years of the socialist State. For many, the local area, city or region has become a focus for Heimatgefühl. As well as being associated on the one hand with personal memories and family origins, it harbours familiar historical legends, traditions and allegiances. Personal and collective memories come together in a feeling of homeland. Such feelings are not without their dangers: regional pride can manifest itself in parochialism and the exclusion of outsiders such as immigrants and ethnic minorities. However, Brinker-Gabler suggests, the emergence of a critical regionalism, conscious of the dangers of Heimatgefühl, can be observed in the new Länder.\n\nIt will be useful to bear in mind the distinction between immigrant and exile in the following discussion of poems, and to ask whether private revisiting of the past, gaining an awareness of cultural alternatives and creating an alternative community through travel, and rediscovering Heimat in a critical regionalism, have possessed the importance for poets which Brinker-Gabler considers they have for prose writers.\n\nFrom a vantage point in 2005, the perspectives and questions outlined by Brinker-Gabler require modification in one respect. It was not clear when she was writing in 1996-7 that what she saw as mere Ostalgie would develop into the revival of East German identity we have seen over the past decade. Paul Cooke writes of a new visceral sense of Easternness reflected and actively fostered by intellectuals and writers. There is nothing new is this: national feeling in 19th-Germany was already described by Friedrich Meinecke as a by-product of the intellectual efforts of poets and thinkers. The concept of the Kulturnation not only preceded any realistic hope of political unification, it also survived as an ideal after the division of Germany in 1949, when writers maintained a dialogue with their counterparts in the other German State during the cold war years. Around the unification of Germany in 1990 this notion of a unified cultural nation was again evoked by the cultural and political elites, as a potential means of overcoming the obvious social and economic disunity, and writers were exhorted to do their bit for inner unity. Ironically, Cooke suggests, East German writers, and particularly the younger ones, have contributed and are contributing more to the constitution of an East German regional identity than to a German national one. (He does not consider the significance of more localised identities, for instance in Saxony.) They articulate a notion of East Germanness based on private examination of the collective past experience and a shared sense of dislocation within the unified German State. To what extent, we may then also ask, have post-Wende landscape poets articulated this new form of East German identity, and participated in its construction?\n\n4. The Landscape Poem since 1990\n\nSeveral generations of landscape poets have observed and commented on change in East German cities and the countryside since reunification. Among the better known are Volker Braun, Heinz Czechowski, Elke Erb and Wulf Kirsten, who were born in the 1930s, Richard Pietraß, Thomas Rosenlöcher and Andreas Reimann, born in the 1940s, Kurt Drawert, Uwe Kolbe and Michael Wüstefeld, born in the 1950s, and Lutz Seiler, Durs Grünbein and Christian Lehnert, born in the 1960s. During and immediately after the Wende, many poems were written and collected in anthologies such as Grenzfallgedichte and Von einem Land und vom andern (Chiarloni and Pankoke 1991 and Conrady 1993). Elke Erbs Perspektive im Februar, written in 1990 in response to a questionnaire canvassing opinion on the Wende, adopts a cautiously optimistic stance:\n\nMir will nicht in den Kopf\n\nein in der Zukunft wartendes Elend,\n\nund sei es das einer Minderheit.\n\nMir geht nicht aus dem Kopf\n\ndie vergiftete Natur der Umwelt\n\nund die geschändete der menschlichen Produktivität.\n\nIm Vordergrund meines Interesses taucht der Deutsche auf,\n\neine Begegnung, die mich freut;\n\ner ist zu studieren:\n\nWie richtet er Schaden an,\n\nwie gedeiht seine Güte,\n\nschmarotzt er? (Chiarloni and Pankoke 1991: 80)\n\nErb draws a parallel between environmental damage and exploitation of the people, and speculates on the characteristics of a new all-German identity. She asks herself whether Germans will now avoid living at the expense of nature and poorer nations. Neither local nor East German identity concern her at this point. Volker Brauns Der 9. November, a poem on the fall of the Berlin Wall, reflects a different response to the extraordinary events of the Winter of 1989-90:\n\nDas Brackwasser stachellippig, aufgeschnittene Drähte\n\nLautlos, wie im Traum, driften die Tellerminen\n\nZurück in den Geschirrschrank. Ein surrealer Moment:\n\nMit spitzem Fuß auf dem Weltriß, und kein Schuß fällt.\n\nDie gehetzte Vernunft, unendlich müde, greift\n\nNach dem erstbesten Irrtum Der Dreckverband platzt.\n\nLeuchtschriften wandern okkupantenhaft bis Mitte. BERLIN\n\nNUN FREUE DICH, zu früh. Wehe, harter Nordost. (Braun 1993: 51f.)\n\nIf Erb stands midway between the immigrant and the exile, Braun is clearly closer to the latter. Like many other members of the GDR intelligentsia, he experienced unification as a humiliating failure, putting an end to aspirations held for decades to create an alternative to Western capitalism, and a process of colonisation, in which East Germans were relegated to the status of second-class citizens in the new state. At first he expresses astonishment and ambivalent feelings at the non-violent collapse of the GDR military and political establishment. On the one hand, the term Brackwasser suggests a society which has been stagnant: this critique is reinforced by the impact of its liberation from confinement behind barbed wire and land mines. On the other, the path taken towards rapid unification is presented as a mistaken, knee-jerk reaction laying the country wide open to Western advertising and capitalism. The euphoric words of the West Berlin mayor Walter Momper are cited in sarcastic capitals, and the poem closes with a warning of political storms to come. Braun foresees the replacement of the old landscape, which he describes in terms comparable to Grünbeins Grauzonenlandschaft, by a new, commercialised and commodified one. Both serve as images for social relations. Though the poem is not explicitly concerned with the construction of a new personal or collective identity, it anticipates the emergence of a sense of East Germanness within the new nation, based on the shared experiences of forty years of socialism, the upheavals of the Wendezeit, and distrust of and resistance to capitalism.\n\nThe dismantling and abandoning of military installations mentioned in Brauns poem also features in post-Wende poems by Kirsten, Pietraß and Rosenlöcher. The pleasure they express in nature repossessing territory once used for purposes of oppression and destruction remains recognisable, but changes its significance in Lutz Seilers more recent poem safari. Here the military buildings have first been adapted to serve a commercial function:\n\nich sah die aufgegebnen flaggen von\n\ncitroën am alten panzerplattenweg; ein toter\n\nxantia-handel. das\n\ndach: durchstoßen [ ]\n\nvergessne, restlos\n\nausgestorbne arten kehren um, sind\n\ngleichgestellt und kämpfen, wölfe\n\n& insekten auf den alten routen [ ]\n\n[ ] ich\n\nsah die böden: schon entsiegelt. aus\n\ndem grundriß der wachstube wuchs\n\nwachsteppe. (Seiler 2003: 88, lines 1-4, 13-16 and 18-20)\n\nSeiler seems to be envisioning the self-destruction of modern civilisation and natures triumphal return. This motif also plays a central role in Andreas Reimanns provocatively pessimistic poetry volume Zwischen den Untergängen (Reimann 2004). In the poem Untergänge (p. 117), Reimann comments with pleasure that nature is indifferent to mans judgement, and in Utopia he foresees a post-nuclear, post-human landscape:\n\nWenn in die märkische wüste der leguan heimkehrt,\n\nein seltsamer sandfisch, und wir uns in dörrobst verwandeln,\n\nda unserer selbst wir uns niemals erbarmten: wie klar\n\nwird dann der frieden sein endlich!: aus allen verstecken\n\nzüngelt, zunächst nur sehr zögerlich, zierlich das gras,\n\nein schachtelhalmwald überwächst die bedrohlichen dome. (Reimann 2004: 115, lines 1-6)\n\nMore characteristic of East German poetry in the 1990s is, however, Richard Pietraßs melancholy account of the sale of the countryside to Westerner developers, in the poem Randlage:\n\nDie letzte Saat\n\nDes Felds ist aufgegangen.\n\nEllenbogen\n\nVermessen das Land.\n\nPflöcke stückeln\n\nRoggenschläge.\n\nZins- und Pferdefuß\n\nGehen zur Hand.\n\nAm Rapsrain\n\nTrapst die Nachtigall.\n\nDie Säge singt\n\nIm Holunder.\n\nDie Bauern motten\n\nPflüge ein.\n\nDem Schafstall\n\nBlüht ein Quellewunder.\n\nWohin ich Habnicht sehe\n\nSieht mich das Ende an.\n\nIch stehe und verstehe.\n\nWende sich, wer kann. (Pietraß 2002: 29)\n\nThe fields in which crops of rye and rape once grew, and which are now marked out for commercial development, provide a striking image for the loss associated with the structural change which is sweeping over the country. Elder trees, associated in folklore with the nature spirits, are being felled, and the lambing shed is making way for the warehouse of a mail order firm. The end of agricultural production and the mothballing of ploughs can be understood as alluding by extension to the winding down of GDR industries by the Treuhandanstalt. Capitalism appears as a Darwinian struggle for survival, in which the simple East Germans are tricked out of their inheritance by clever entrepreneurs in dubious business deals. The dispossessed and disillusioned poet ends on a note of cynicism (Wende sich, wer kann), yet not necessarily one of resignation, for there is a subversive delight in his use of rhyme and alliteration, and his adaptation of sayings (die Sache hat einen Pferdefuß, Nachtigall, ich hör dich trapsen) and metaphors (Ellenbogen/ Vermessen das Land). Like Braun, Pietraß slyly constructs an East German community of resisters to capitalism. The theme of the sell-out of the country is in fact treated by Braun with a comparable mix of pathos and irony, in the poem Einsteins Wiese:\n\nDer Makler führt mich auf den falben Hügel\n\nEinsteins Wiese im krummen Raum\n\nDer Geschäfte, Ginster mit Grundzins\n\nDAS EXIL IN BENZINFREIER LUFT zum Liebhaberpreis\n\nBöhmen am Meer wird eine Immobilie. (Braun 1996: 167)\n\nBohemia on the coast is reduced to a piece of real estate  the phrase, borrowed from Shakespeares Winters Tale, via Ingeborg Bachmanns poem Böhmen liegt am Meer, is one of a series of terms used by Braun for his vision of a socialist utopia, the potential GDR idyll (others are das innerste Afrika, Lustgarten Preußen and Atlantis). However, it is particularly apposite here: Einsteins Wiese is the name of an unspoiled place on the Baltic coast (Hochland auf Hiddensee, see Braun 1996: 173). In the phrase krummer Raum Braun has also smuggled in an allusion to the curved space-time in Albert Einsteins Theory of General Relativity.\n\nThomas Rosenlöchers poem Das Immobilistenballett similarly satirises a visit by West German financiers to the site of a proposed development:\n\nDie Autos stehn schräg auf der Wiese. Die Herren\n\nTreten drei Schritt vor und heben die Köpfe\n\nIm Grölen der Vögel. Ist ja wirklich hier\n\nEine richtige Wildnis. Doch schwierig als Bauland.\n\nWie soll sich das rechnen? Rechnet sich das,\n\nKauft man sich gleich was, und wieder drei Schritt vor,\n\nWo man noch wirklich, und Brombeergerank\n\nUmklammert die Hosen, zu leben versteht,\n\nIn der Toscana, der Kirschbaum muß weg,\n\nZwecks Tiefgarage - aufwehn die Schlipse,\n\nDas Grölen der Vögel malt Bögen in ihre\n\nPragmatischen Hirne, und selbdritt drei Schritt\n\nStolpern die Herren, SOS tippt einer\n\nIn den Taschenrechner, o Wunder, in Richtung\n\nToscana. Totale Kirschblütenverschüttung. (Rosenlöcher 1996: 54)\n\nThe countryside is here in the eyes of the developers an object to be exploited, so they can buy themselves villas in Tuscany. The total burying of the cherry blossom to make way for an underground garage in the final line evokes a recurring motif in Rosenlöchers poetry. Like his earlier poem Das Schreckensbild, in which he celebrated the ability of a cherry tree to flower amid a desolate industrial wasteland, it echoes Barthold Heinrich Brockes vision of the deity in the much anthologised poem Kirschblüte bei der Nacht. (See for instance Grimm 1995: 81f.) However, pathos is here, as above with Pietraß and Braun, qualified by humour: the developers move in comic, clumsy ballet steps, brambles catch in their trousers, the wind in their ties, and the birdsong interferes with the calculations of their pragmatic brains.\n\nDas Schreckensbild was among 76 poems written by Rosenlöcher between 1976 and 1987, reflecting on life in the GDR and Saxon identity with self-critical irony, which he made minor changes to, rearranged and republished in 1998 (Rosenlöcher 1998: 64f.). Such re-collection and rearticulation of the past constitutes, as Brinker-Gabler has pointed out, like Volker Brauns intertextual dialogue with his earlier poetry, one way in which writers sought to redefine identity after 1990. A second is in poems on travel. Many of the poets examined broadened their horizons by spending periods of time in the West (West Germany, Paris, Amsterdam or Tuscany), and some (Czechowski, Drawert and Kolbe) have left East Germany for good  though they have written about visits to the landscapes of their childhood. The unsettling impact of reunification is evident even in the poetry of writers who had left the GDR for the West more than a decade earlier, such as Günter Kunert and Sarah Kirsch. Although Kirsch had found a new home among the fields and dykes on the North Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein, a visit to Berlin at the end of 1990 prompted her to write in the poem Aus dem Haiku-Gebiet (an allusion to the GDR): Das Jahr geht hin./ Noch immer trage ich/ Reisekleider. (Kirsch 1992: 5) She did not, however, return to live in Berlin. The feeling of many East German poets that they were no longer at home anywhere after 1990 is expressed in Heinz Czechowskis Die Stadt, written after a bittersweet re-encounter with his birthplace, Dresden:\n\nDie Stadt, Welt-\n\nMeisterin in der Kunst des Vergessens.\n\nÜber den Fluß\n\nKommen die Wolken, ost-\n\nWärts dreht sich der Wind.\n\nDie Brücken, kaum zerstört\n\nVon des Krieges Angriff: hier\n\nStand ich mit Leising.\n\nOder der Freundin, vordem.\n\nJetzt, in Schöppingen, denk ich:\n\nWäre ich doch geblieben\n\nDort oder sonstwo, bloß nicht\n\nHier, wo ich mit Schnapses Hilfe\n\nHinübersegele,\n\nDer Fliegende Deutsche,\n\nIns Nachbarland Holland. (Czechowski 2002: 22)\n\nCzechowski decided to move permanently to the quiet Northrhine-Westphalian town of Schöppingen after spending a period there as writer in residence. The raw emotions, including self-pity which are evident here, as in so many of his poems in the 1990s, are qualified by humorous detachment in the second stanza, where he describes himself as a Flying German living on the Dutch border. Despite the melancholy tone of the poem, he refuses to share in the common amnesia, and is recognisably engaged in the process of reviewing the past on which the construction of personal and collective identity is often grounded. In the poem Aufenthalt, Czchowski describes an unfriendly encounter when passing through Weimar, a city which is, like much of East Germany in the 1990s, im Umbau begriffen and bis zur Unkenntlichkeit entstellt. Wärn Sie doch drüben geblieben!, the station master calls, when he complains that all the public lavatories are out of order, and he concludes wryly that a city he once loved is being whisked in steamed cement, in preparation for the anticipated invasion of tourists on the 250th anniversary of Goethes birth:\n\nDas Jahr Zweitausend naht, das achtundneunzigste endet.\n\nDie Weltkulturhauptstadt bereitet sich rohen Tons\n\nAuf die Ankunft der Dioskuren vor:\n\nWas du einst geliebt, wird verquirlt\n\nIm bedampften Zement. (Czechowski 2002: 63, lines 14-18)\n\nBut it is Dresden and Leipzig which form the main focus of his attention. Dresden, with its great cultural flowering in the Baroque, when the Electors of Saxony were also Kings of Poland, its terrible destruction by British incendiary bombs in February 1944, and its decades of neglect as a provincial backwater under the SED, has emerged as one of the principal sites of local identity for East German poets. Exploring personal memories and the history of the city, they express a powerful sense of belonging, and are fiercely critical of the forgetting of awkward aspects of the past which has accompanied Dresdens reinvention of itself as a heritage site, and the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche, the castle and the Academy of the Arts. Kurt Drawerts poem Wo es war expresses a double disappointment, with industrial development and pollution, and with forgetfulness, in this place where, like Auschwitz, the grass is growing over the scars of the past:\n\nHier kam ich als Kind her, verstört,\n\nhier ging es uns gut [ ]\n\nSpäter, an einer empfindlichen Stelle\n\nder Biographie, brach, wie dem einen\n\ndie Stimme, dem andern\n\ndas Rückgrat [ ]\n\nWo es war, hat das Gras schon zu wuchern\n\nbegonnen. Die kleine Senke im Boden,\n\nin der ich von Liebe geträumt haben muß,\n\nist mit Schotter gefüllt, Lachen von Flußtang\n\nund Öl, zerdrückte Aluminiumdosen,\n\nein Brandfleck. Auch diese Erde\n\nhat ihre Geschichte verleugnet. (Drawert 1996: 80, lines 7-8, 10-13 and 16-22)\n\nIn a poem entitled 6.5.1996, Volker Braun revisits the city of his childhood, where his mother is now dying. He is caught in a traffic jam on the bridge opposite the castle, which, named after Georgi Dimitroff in 1945 (the Communist accused by the Nazis of burning down the Reichstag in February 1933, whose courageous defence gained him acquittal), was given back its old name, Augustusbrücke, in 1990. Forced to walk through the vast building site that the city centre had become, he is prompted by the excavations and the laying of new foundations to engage in painful reflection on his life and the mistakes of the GDR:\n\ndas Taxi\n\nSteckte im Stau auf der Dimitroff der Augustusbrücke\n\nNichts ging mehr während meine Mutter starb\n\nIch ging zufuß umrundend eine Erdramme [ ]\n\nDie Stadt war aufgerissen wie nach dem Angriff\n\nBarockschutt, man kann in den Fundamenten wandeln\n\nUnd den Irrtum suchen. (Braun 1999: 25)\n\nBrauns poem exemplifies the use of the changing landscape as a signifier of the loss of a GDR identity associated with fairness, goodness and compassion, but more importantly, also as a trigger for critical self-examination and reflection on the past, reviewing hopes and illusions.\n\nMy final examples return to the poetry of the natural landscape, and illustrate the development over the decade of the 1990s. Observation of the countryside serves as a vehicle for identity construction in Wulf Kirstens post-Wende poem Wie leb ich hier?:\n\ndie unschuld des ersten blicks\n\nhat sich verloren,\n\ndas flurengefühl versteppt.\n\nwo sich die stadt aufläßt und grün wird,\n\nscheunengeniste  geometrische\n\nfiguren in schräglage,\n\ngespeichertes nichts im halblicht.\n\neine mauer aus scheitholz geschichtet.\n\nam graspfad wegwarte,\n\nblaue sonnenwirbel, die sich\n\nselbstherrlich drehn.\n\nflankierende maßnahmen\n\nin gestalt von datschenparzellen.\n\ndie nackten tatsachen\n\nüber den zaun geworfen\n\nins herrenlose schwarzdorngestrüpp.\n\ngartenplunder mit vorbedacht\n\nentsorgt zum nulltarif.\n\ndas leben in die gleiche\n\ngebracht. die wirklichkeit\n\nein bodenloses faß, schön rostzerfressen.\n\nstiefvater staat hat sich\n\naus dem staube gemacht,\n\naufgeflogen, flügellos.\n\nwer hat das scheitholz\n\ngeschichtet? wem gehört das flurband\n\nvor der stadt?\n\nmittendrin mein weg\n\nüber die schaftrift,\n\nauf den schlittenberg hinauf,\n\nflirrende schattenzüge neben mir her,\n\nfelderwärts gleitendes licht.\n\nwie leb ich hier? (Kirsten 1993: 61f.)\n\nWriting two years after reunification, when initial hopes had subsided, the poet notes the sense of wellbeing (Flurengefühl) in the countryside on the outskirts of Weimar has yielded to one of barrenness and monotony. The margins of the city are marked by ugly new development  he is forced to thread his way between barns which seem to store nothing, walls of precisely stacked firewood and fenced allotments. A critique of the clandestine disposal of unwelcome aspects of the past is implicit in his reference to the illicit dumping of garden waste. The reality is that the stepfather state has absconded, leaving behind a rusting economy which is a bottomless pit for subsidies. The injustice of property-owning is touched on, which has led to the sudden wealth of those who can sell out to developers, at the expense of others like himself. The uncertainty of the poets personal position, summed up in his final question, Wie leb ich hier? (perhaps less: How am I living here? than How will I be able to live here?), is reflected in the ambivalent lighting of the landscape.\n\nIn kammlage, written six years later, this ambivalence has disappeared: the silent winter landscape has become an image for spiritual emptiness:\n\nvom\n\nwinterhimmel drückt das nichtende nichts,\n\ndie überjährigen stengel, verholzt,\n\nder landschaft hinterlassen, sehr dekorativ,\n\nein zuckerrübenfeld, ernteversessen, wenn\n\nauch im schlamm trostlos vergessen, fault\n\nvor sich hin, wie leicht man sich schwarz\n\närgern kann, das erdreich zerwalkt,\n\nebenheit in ergebenheit, wie sie doch\n\nstillhält, kein mucks keine bewegung,\n\nerstarrtes zucken, eingelassen in\n\ndie weglosen wege, aber bald schon von\n\ngrund auf versiegelt, erdmassen zu halden\n\nhochgewälzt, gehölzentblößte quellflächen,\n\nvom rechten winkel besiegt, flurbereinigten\n\nblicks auf zu den bergen geschaut, ach\n\nwie liegt so traut, der horizont\n\neine verschriftlichte abbreviatur. (Kirsten 1999: 61f., lines 4-21)\n\nThe poet is racked with frustration, he seems, like the landscape, to have been given a belting (zerwalkt), and to be anticipating, like the springs now denuded of trees, his own concreting over (Versiegelung). The ruthless reduction of fields and rivers to administrative norms and their preparation for commercial development provide a metaphor for the process of globalisation impinging on the people of Thuringia. However, like the psalmist, he lifts his eyes up to the distant hills, and unlike the landscape, he is not mute.\n\nThe elegiac tone present in Kirstens verse dominates the East German landscape poetry of the older generation in the 1990s. However, the younger writers tend to be more detached, and to adopt a more ironic and playful approach. The Dresden poet Michael Wüstefeld, for instance, cheekily calls on us to create more landscape. Creation, the creator and all creatures may be exhausted, consumed, trampled on by jackboots, and abused, but the topic has been discussed to death. Schafft mehr Landschaft is the first in a short cycle of texts entitled LandStrich, published in 2003:\n\nDie Schöpfung ist erschöpft\n\nvom Verbraucher verbraucht\n\nSchafft mehr Landschaft\n\nDer Schöpfer ist erschöpft\n\nvon Schaftstiefeln geschafft\n\nSchafft mehr Landschaft\n\nDie Geschöpfe sind erschöpft\n\nvom Verbraucher mißbraucht\n\nSchafft mehr Landschaft\n\nDas Thema ist erschöpft\n\nvon Apokalyptikern zu Tode geritten\n\nSchafft mehr Landschaft\n\nDie Vorräte sind erschöpft\n\nvom Verbraucher aufgebraucht\n\nSchafft mehr Landschaft (Wüstefeld 2003)\n\n5. Conclusion: The special contribution of poetry\n\nWith the demise of the Leseland GDR, one might have expected poetry, a genre whose inherent structural ambiguity has deterred a wider readership at the best of times, to cease to be a significant medium for debate on public issues. However, though the conditions of literary production and the self-understanding of ex-GDR poets changed dramatically in 1990, they have, as Ruth Owen has pointed out, continued to write and to be published, and as many new voices have appeared in East Germany in the 1990s as in other parts of Germany (Owen 2001: 3f.). East Germans have on the whole blended into the general field of contemporary German poetry, but they continue to constitute an identifiable group.\n\nDespite the fact that the environment was, in Michael Zschiesches words, ein schnell verschwundenes Thema in the new Länder (see the title of Zschiesche 2003), agricultural Flurbereinigung (the restructuring of the countryside to meet the requirements of agribusiness), the gentrification of city centres and most of all the commercial development of the urban periphery continue to prompt environmental concern in the above poems. However, it is seldom the principal focus of interest. The changing local environment is an objective correlative for broader political and social change. At the same time, it can act as a vehicle for the expression of the poets feelings.\n\nFinally, the encounter with the landscape facilitates self-orientation and the orientation of readers, by triggering a process of critical stock-taking. The poems examined bear out Ruth Owens description of the journey in search of identity as a crucial motif in post-unification poetry (2001: 186f.). Writing is a regrounding of identity in the face of an all-consuming Fremdheit, trawling through personal and collective memories in order to construct ones own text. East German poets are distinguished by their probing of identity and their challenging of comfortable accommodation with injustices which are often ignored and accepted in the West. Particularly in the case of the Dresden poets, a rediscovery of Heimat and the critical regionalism Brinker-Gabler speaks of seems discernible.\n\nAt the same time, the distinctive quality of poetic language, which augments the everyday meanings of words with figurative and metaphorical levels of meaning, fusing the private with the public voice, has had a unique role to play in post-Wende writing. The special contribution of the texts examined lies not least in their concision, their ability to sum up complex relationships and evoke powerful feelings in images and aphoristic phrases, giving them a freshness, an intensity and a memorable quality prose normally lacks. Thirdly, their exploitation of linguistic ambivalences and their deconstruction of linguistic conventions have challenged assumptions and suggested alternative ways of seeing things. Through word play and irony, they have restored to readers a sense of poise and control in a situation where they felt marginalised, and they empowered their readers through subversive fantasy.\n\nIn a short text written in response to a newspaper survey of public opinion at the time of unification, like Elke Erbs poem above, Thomas Rosenlöcher provides a curiously appropriate image for the quest for a German identity rooted in the local, but embracing a wider horizon. All the issues discussed here resonate in Die deutsche Seele, in the space of a mere seven lines: the environment, the experience of post-reunification dispossession and disorientation, throwing the poet back on himself, reexamination of the personal and collective past, travel and the hint of Heimat in Rosenlöchers former home, Kleinzschachwitz:\n\nWo die deutsche Seele ist?\n\nWoher soll ich das wissen.\n\nAm ehesten in Kleinzschachwitz.\n\nAm ehesten in mir.\n\nAber auch ich bin zur Zeit unterwegs.\n\nEndlos kreisend sucht sie sich\n\nSelbst auf den Autobahnen.
