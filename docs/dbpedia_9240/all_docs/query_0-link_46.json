        "text": "This is still completely ignoring the many documents shared with you: A weak sovereign is still a sovereign. Judging whether a place is a part of China or not by the amount of self-rule, is tantamount to claiming that all truly autonomous regions of a country are in fact separate, independent countries.\n\nYou just ignored all the posts I shared with you, in which China incorporated Tibet in in 1720, and the degree of internal affairs that the Qing was limited but not nearly as limited as you claim, and even if it is you ignore the part which I described autonomous regions, which are still considered part of the country despite the central government having limited interference.\n\nIn post 279 I asked you:\n\nWhy does it matter that Qing administration was direct/indirect, so long as Tibet was considered a part of China, unless if you're saying autonomous regions are actually the same as independent countries. Any appeal to autonomy would hence be just another separatist attempt.\n\nAnd the amount of direct/indirect rule is only relative to the Chinese bureaucracy at the time. Achaemenid rule was very indirect in which its satraps had their own courts/armies too, yet it was still considered the largest empire of its day rather than a collection of independent states.\n\nTibetan Nation: A History of Tibetan Nationalism and Sino-Tibetan Relation by Jr, Warren W. Smith (and this person is hardly a CPC sympathizer by any means):\n\nWhen the Dzungar attacked the walls of Lhasa on 30 November 1717, Tibetan sympathizers threw down ladders and opened the gates. The Dzungar found themselves in control of Lhasa, but without the legitimacy that the precense of the Seventh Dalai Lama would have provided them. In addition, they looted Lhasa and abused the citizens, destroying overnight the support theyhad previously enjoyed among the Tibetans. The Dzungar, patrons of the Gelugpa sect, began persecuting the Nyingmapa sect, destroying several of their monasteries.\n\nIn response to Lhazang Khan's appeal for assistance against the Dzungar, the Ch'ing Emperor K'ang His dispatched armies from Sining and Szechuan. However, in 'the meantine, Lhasa had fallen and Lhazang had been killed. The mission of the Ch'ing armies therefore became the conquest of the Dzungar in Tibet. Realizing that their resources were insufficient for this, the Ch'ing commanders temporarily withdrew to muster their forces. In preparation for an expedition from Szechuan, the Ch'ing established control of Tachienlu (Dartsendo), Lithang and Ba along the southern route into Tibet. The Ch'ing Szechuan army invaded over this route in 1720, entering Lhasa without opposition on 24 September. The Dzungar concentrated their forces at Dam in the north against an expected Ch'ing army coming from Kokonor. After the fall of Lhasa, the Dzungar fled back along the route that they had originally taken into Tibet. A Ch'ing army from Sining arrived in Lhasa in mid-October, bringing with them the young Dalai Lama. Tibetan forces under the Tibetan leaders Kanchenas and Polhanas had meanwhile regained the territory of Tsang from the Dzungar. The Ch'ing enetered Tibet as the patrons of the Kokonor Mongols, the liberator of Tibet from the Dzungar, and the supporters of the Seventh Dalai Lama.\n\nAlthough the Mongols of Kokonor had joined the Ch'ing in driving Dzungar out of Tibet and restoring the rightful Dalai Lama, they harbored resentment because the Ch'ing had replaced them as lords of Kokonor and of Tibet. An immediate cause of resentment was a perceived lack of respect accorded to the Kokonor Mongols at the installation of the Dalai Lma in Lhasa. Once back in Kokonor, the Mongols began fomenting revolt, led by a grandson of Gushri Khan, Lobsang Danjin, who wished to restore the privileges due his clan as \"Kings of Tibet.\" The Mongol revolt was joined by most of the Tibetans of Kokonor, led by the lamas of Kumbum. The lamas, particularly those of Kumbum and of all its affiliates, were intense in their opposition to the Ch'ing; they reportedly provoked their Tibetan and Mongol adherents into a state of frenzy. In late 1723 a reported 200,000 Tibetans and Mongols attacked Sining. The Ch'ing summoned troops from Szechuan and supporessed the rebellion with thoroughness and brutality. The revolt was quelled by 1724, but the Kokonor region suffered great destruction.\n\nThe revolt of 1723 in Kokonor had its roots in Mongol and Tibetan resistance to increased Ch'ing control. Ch'ing control was perhaps more immediately felt in Kokonor, where Ch'ing presence had existed since an earlier time and with a greater intimacy than in central Tibet. The lamas of Amdo were intensely opposed to Ch'ing control, despite the role of the Ch'ing in restoring the Dalai Lama. The central Tibetans not only did not assist the Kokonor Mongols and Tibetans against the Ch'ing, but provided a force under Polhanas that prevented the Mongol and Tibetan tribes' escape from Ch'ing suppression.\n\nThe Ch'ing subsequently reorganized the administration of Kokonor and made clear their intention to exercise more direct control there. The Tibetan and Mongol tribes previously dependent upon the Khoshot Khan were reorganized into units responsible only to the Ch'ing administration. But the Mongol and Tibetan tribes were alloted fixed territories and were forbidden to infringe upon the territories of others. Lama monasteries had their lands and properties confiscated. Those who had paid taxes to the monasteries or to Mongol overlords now paid directly to Ch'ing officials. Kokonor was thus effectively incorporated into the Ch'ing empire. In 1725 a census was taken that revealed that there were 50,020 persons in the territory. The boundaries between Amdo and Kham were subsequently demarcated, following the lines established by the Yuan dynasty…………..\n\nTibetan officials were riven by personal feuds, however, and by political and reginoal factioons. Kanchenas and Polhanas, representatives of the nobility who had been loyal to Lhazang Khan and to the Ch'ing, were of western Tibetan origin (Tsang and Ngari). They saw Tibet's (and their own) best interest lying in the protection afforded by the Ch'ing. They were opposed by the Lhasa nobility, many of whom had been supporters of the Dzungar and opponents of Lhazang Khan and Ch'ing interferance in Tibet. Polhanas attempted to reconcile the various factions, pointing out the benefit of unified Tibetan administration. However, Polhanas and Kanchenas soon fell out over the issue of the persecution of the Nyingmapa.\n\nThese internal disputes finally came to a head in 1727. The news reached Tibet that the emperor was dispatching new ambans, who would more closely superintend Tibetan affairs under the administration of Canchenas. The anti-Ch'ing faction decided to act before the new ambans arrived. On 5 August 1727 they murdered Kanchenas in the council chambers in the Lhasa Jokhang and took over control of Lhasa. Polhanas was at his estate at Polha and, having been warned in advance, was able to escape. He retired to Ngari, securing the support of Kanchenas' brother, who was governor there. Polhanas gathered his supporters in Ngari and Tsang; he sent messages to the Ch'ing informing them of events and requesting Ch'ing assistance.\n\nBy September, only a month after the assassination of Kanchenas, Polhanas, by an impressive feat of political and logistical organization was able to start on a reconquest of Tsang with the troops he had gathered in Ngari. The Lhasa officials who had revolted against Kanchenas summoned troops from Kongpo, Dakpo and various Mongol tribes. The faction struggle then took on charactersitcs typical of past regional conflicts between U and Tsang. Polhanas brought up his forces and confronted the Lhasa army between Gyantse and Shigaste. After three days of fighting, Polhanas was forced to retreat back to the west of Sakya. The Lhasa ministers then disbanded their army, only garrisoning the dzongs (forts) of Tsang, thinking that the fighting was over for the winter. Polhanas managed to retain his army and retook the offensive, taking the Lhasa garrisons by surprise and regaining control of Tsang.\n\nAt this point, a truce was agreed upon, each side having appealed to the Ch'ing emperor for assistance. Polhanas, who may have been fairly assured that he would be supported by the Ch'ing, soon broke the truce due to his desire to gain control of the situation before the Ch'ing mission could arrive. After garrisoning his strongholds in Tsang, Polhanas sent his forces by various routes toward Lhasa. Polhanas himself proceeded with a small force by the northern route to Yangbijan, northwest of Lhasa. From there, after gaining the allegiance of some of the Mongols of Dam, Polhanas approached Lhasa. Polhanas now held the advantage; the army of the Lhasa ministers melted away, allowing Polhanas to enter Lhasa in July 1728, virtually without opposition.\n\nA Ch'ing military expedition to Tibet was organized in 1727 but was postponed until 1728 after the emperor learned that the conflict in Tibet did not involve the Dzungar. The Ch'ing army finally left Sining in June 1728 and reached Lhasa on 4 September. Considering that Polhanas had already brought the civil war to a close, the main purpose of the expedition was to administer justice to the rebels, a right of the emperor that Polhanas was careful not to usurp. The ministers and their followers, a total of eighteen men, were found guilty of rebellion and were ceremoniously executed by the \"slicing process.\" Ch'ing justice required that the immediate relatives of the eighteen men, including women and children, also be executed, which was done. The populace of Lhasa was effectively cowed by this display of the justice and retribution of the Ch'ing……\n\nActual administration in Tibet was in the hands of Polhanas, who reestablished order, commerce, the postal system and taxation…….. IN 1731 the Ch'ing emperor granted Polhanas a seal of office and judicial powers in Tibet. In 1733 Polhanas petitioned for a reduction of the Lhasa garrison to 500 men; this was granted because the situation in Tibet was considered stable. The garrison was also moved to the north of Lhasa, near Sera monastery. The Chamdo garrison was also reduced, to 500 men. In the next year, the Chamdo garrison was completely eliminated and that at Lithang reduced to 600 men……\n\nPolhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his youngest son Gyurmey Namgyal, who soon demonstrated that he was not of the same loyal and submissive nature as his father. Gyurmey Namgyal attempted to reduce the ambans' influence in Tibet by requesting a reduction in the now very small Ch'ing garrison in Lhasa. The emperor agreed to this request, perhaps in the spirit of good relations with the new Tibetan administrator, and reduced the garrison to 100 men. The Ch'ing were now confident of their position in Tibet, despite a rather serious revolt in Kham from 1747 to 1749. Gyurmey Namgyal first raised the suspicions of the Ch'ing by a request to send Gelugpa lamas ot the monasteries of unreformed sects (Nyingmapa, Sakyapa and Karmapa) in Kham and Amdo. His purpose was to gain Gelugpa control, and therefore the political control of Lhasa, over Tibetan territories of Kham and Amdo, which the Ch'ing had separated from Lhasa's administration. To this the emperor did not agree.\n\nThe ambans in Lhasa became alarmed when Gyurmey Namgyal began assembling an army……..In 1750, the ambans, convinced that Gyurmey Namgyal was intent upon rebellion, and knowing that he was regarded as a tyrant by many Tibetans, decided to take steps to eliminate him. The ambans lured Gyurmey Namgyal to their residence and murdered him by their own hands.\n\nGyurmey Namgya's attendant escaped the ambans' residence and gathered a crowd to avenge the death of his master. Although the Dalai Lama and the abbot of Reting tried to calm the crowd, claiming that Gyurmey Namgyal had received what he deserved, the mob attacked the ambans' residence, killing the two ambans and most of their escort. The Dalai Lama quickly assumed authority in Lhasa. The Tibetans then awaited the arrival of the Ch'ing army, which they knew would be dispatched to administer justice. By the time the Ch'ing had assembled their expeditionary force, the situation in Lhasa had stabilized. The emperor therefore dispatched only 800 men to Lhasa. The leader of the mob and six others were publicly executed by the slicing process. The family of Gyurmey Namgyal was also executed when evidence was produced that he had been conspiring with the Dzungar…….The Dalai Lama had stabilized the situation in Lhasa and had demonstrated loyalty to the Ch'ing during the crisis. The Dalai Lama was therefore reinvested with spiritual and temporal rule; this was announced as a restoration of the system that had existed under the Fifth Dalai Lama…..\n\nThe Gurkhas entered Tibetan territory at Nyalam and advanced as far as Shekar Dzong in the summer of 1788. The Tibetans and the ambans appealed to the Ch'ing emperor for assistance. An advance Ch'ing army was sent, but its commander negotiated a truce agreement that required Tibet to make a tribute payment to Nepal in return for the withdrawal of the Gurkhas. After Tibetan delays in paying tribute, the Gurkhas invaded Tibet again in 1791, capturing Shigaste and looting the Tashilhunpo monastery. The Tibetans responded by surrounding the Gurkhas at Shigastse and Shekar Dzong; in the spring of 1792 they forced their withdrawal to the border districts.\n\nAt this point, another Ch'ing army, composed mainly of Tibetans (only 3,000 of the 13,000 troops were non-Tibetan), arrived, drove the Gurkhas out of Tibet and continued into Nepal via Nyalam and Kyirong. The Tibetan-Ch'ing army had advanced to the approaches to the Kathmandu valley when a truce was reached. The Gurkhas had agreed to return the treasures they had looted from Tashilhunpo and to send tribute to Peking every five years……..\n\n\"The Travels of Ippolito Desideri of Pistoia, 1712-1727\":\n\nThe Emperor of China showed his sagacity by the steps he took to gain the affections of the Tibetans and to alienate them from the GIonngars (Dzungar Mongols). As I have said before, news had spread all over Tibet that the Grand Lama, killed by King Cinghes Khang, had been born again near Sciling in China. These credulous and superstitious people had tried in vain by supplications and every sort of of intrigue to obtain the boy's release from the fortress in which he was well guarded by the Emperor's orders. Now he released the young imposter and sent him to Tibet with his second army. Proclamations were addressed to monks, governors, and people saying if they wished to fight him they were to join with the treacherous GIongars, but if in this youth they recognized their venerated Grand Lama, they must obey all the commands of the leaders of this army.\n\nSlowly and in good order the Chinese advanced, not by the road across the desert but by the more inhabited one, and from all parts the people assembled to acclaim the Grand Lama and hear the orders given by the representatives of the Emperor of China. These orders were that all men, even the aged and infirm, from the age of twelve upwards should be armed, enrolled and employed, and they were obeyed. May more, against Thibettan custom, monks were also called up, as will be seen by what happened to me. At that time I was ...... Now although the Thibettans had been armed, only a chosen few had been incorporated in the Chinese army, the rest were dispatched to guard the frontiers of Thibet and of the different provinces and close all the roads, even those over the mountains. This was done to prevent the Giongars and their fellow-conspirators from taking flight. What ardour does desperation inspire in men! What courage the dread of failure! One would think that abandoned by the Thibettans, threatened by a formidable army and weakened by former losses, the GIongars now reduced to about four thousand men and with no hope of receiving reinforcements......[after some military reverses on the Chinese side]...... After nigh twenty years of tumult and disaster this Third Great Thibet, or Butant, was thus subjugated by the emperor of China in October 1720, and here his descendants will probably continue to reign for many centuries.\n\nWell that is clearly not true as can be seen here:\n\nFrom the same book:\n\n[Given statements and maps such as the above\", being a \"Fanbang\" or \"Fanshu\" don't preclude a region from being a part of China either]\n\nFrom Battleground Tibet:\n\nSo the Qing themselves invented the golden urn process and had control of the Tibetan capital, albeit the rest of Tibet was relatively autonomous. That doesn't mean it's independent, the Qing still considered Tibet to be a part of China, and if autonomy equates to independence than the Achaemenid empire would not be the largest state of its time but rather a bunch of independent satrapies. The Louisianna Purchase would not have belonged to the US immediately after the time of transfer either.\n\nThe Chinese viewed it the same way in which autonomy is not the same as independence, as can be seen in this discussion between Chinese diplomat Zeng Jize and French prime minister Jules Ferry on the Sino-French War in which the Chinese diplomat kind of called out a Western double standard:\n\nZeng: What is the difference between being the protector and the ruler of a country?\n\nFerry: There are big differences. If you are the ruler of a state, you are responsible for all of its political affairs and govern on its behalf. Whereas if you are the protector of some country, you are only responsible for the general affairs, but are not responsible for its administration.\n\nZeng: When China administers dependent territories, it does not interfere in its internal affairs, just as the Americans govern their frontier. This is unlike the Western way of ruling over dependent territories through law....\n\n-Suzerainty, Semi-Sovereignty, and International Legal Hierarchies on China's Borderlands by Yuan Yi Zhu, University of Oxford"
