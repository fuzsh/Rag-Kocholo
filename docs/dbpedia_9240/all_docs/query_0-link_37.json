        "text": "Even 40 years later, one anecdote still makes Jean-Paul Ribes laugh. When this former journalist, who became a tireless defender of the Tibetan cause in France, met the Dalai Lama for the first time in 1986, he halfheartedly confessed: \"You know, Your Holiness, in my youth I was a Maoist.\" The Tibetan spiritual leader's whole body shook with laughter and he immediately retorted: \"But so was I!\"\n\nThe story is more than just a witty quip. It illustrates the ambivalence of the young Dalai Lama who, after seeing his country invaded by Maoist Chinese soldiers in 1950, forged an almost paternal relationship with the Great Helmsman: Mao Zedong. Invited to Beijing by the communist leader, he was even tempted to join the Communist Party and accepted the post of Vice-President of the National People's Congress, the rump parliament of the Chinese regime. At the time, the Dalai Lama believed that Marxism-Leninism and Buddhism could go hand in hand.\n\n\"Mao? Oh, he was a great leader, a great leader!\" he said to Le Monde in 1996, punctuating this statement with yet another burst of laughter. In a similar vein, he later recounted having at the time given a watch to former vice-premier Xi Zhongxun, father of current president Xi Jinping. \"I used to give gifts of that kind to people for whom I had affectionate feelings,\" he said. It must be said that Tenzin Gyatso – his official name as a reincarnated lama – is not afraid to speak frankly, even when it might bewilder his listeners.\n\nIllusions\n\nTo hear the \"Precious Protector,\" as he is known to his followers, admit that he may once have had a close relationship with communist leaders could come as something of a surprise. Especially from the living symbol of a country that, due to China's involvement, has ceased to exist as a nation and has since faced increasing Sinicization.\n\nRelations between the Dalai Lama and Mao proved to be superficial. At the close of their last meeting in 1955, the communist leader issued him with a stern prescription against the \"poison of religion,\" a term that left the Dalai Lama stunned. Four years later, after a popular uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa, he fled and set up his government-in-exile in India.\n\n\"His Holiness,\" as he is also known to all Tibetans, has long since lost all faith in the illusions of the \"socialist paradise\" that China claimed to want to build in Tibet. His earlier receptiveness to Mao Zedong's charisma gave way to horrified reactions to the violence perpetrated in China and occupied Tibet. Just between 1950 and 1976, for example, \"the Dalai Lama and Tibetans in exile estimate that over a million of their compatriots died as a result of Chinese policy in Tibet,\" wrote former AFP Beijing correspondent Pierre-Antoine Donnet, in his book Tibet mort ou vif (\"Tibet dead or alive,\" 1990). \"One Tibetan in six died an unnatural death during this period.\""
