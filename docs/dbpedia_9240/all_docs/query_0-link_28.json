        "text": "21 Article DC of the 1904 Convention says:\n\n“The Government of Tibet engages that, without the previous consent of the British Government:\n\n(a) no portion of Tibetan territory shall be ceded, sold, leased, mortgaged or otherwise given for occupation to any Foreign Power;\n\n(b) no such Power shall be permitted to intervene in Tibetan affairs;(c) no representatives or agents of any Foreign Power shall be admitted to Tibet;\n\n(d) no concession for railways, roads, telegraphs, mining or other rights shall be granted to any Foreign Power, or the subject of any Foreign Power. In the event of consent to such concessions being granted similar or equivalent concessions shall be granted to the British Government;\n\n(e) no Tibetan revenues, whether in kind or in cash, shall be pledged or assigned to any Foreign Power, or the subject of any Foreign Power.”\n\nThe expression “Foreign Power” is nowhere defined in the Convention.\n\n64 Report, p. 139; U.N. Doc. A/1549, Attachment dated 11 November 1950 containing the complaint of Tibet to the U.N., reprinted in C. Sen, Tibet Disappears, London, 1960, p. 94 at p. 95; Letter of the Dalai Lama to the Secretary-General of the U.N. dated 29 September 1960, paragraph 6, reprinted in Dalai Lama, My Land and My People, London, 1962, p. 239 at p. 240.\n\nThe text of this alleged declaration does not appear to be printed or cited directly in any of these sources, but perhaps it is the same as that referred to in Portrait, p. 135, as occurring some months after the Dalai Lama's return to Lhasa.\n\nThis “declaration” was the Dalai Lama's reply to the offer of Yuan Shih-K'ai, the President of the Chinese Republic, to restore him to his former rank. This reply mere said that the Dalai Lama was not asking the Chinese Government for rank as he intended to exercise both temporal and ecclesiastical rule in Tibet. Compare Sir Charles Bell's version of this “declaration,” in which it appears that Yuan's offer was rejected as merely “unnecessary.” Bell, , “China and Tibet,” 36 J.R.C.A.S. (1949) 54 at p. 55Google Scholar. Since the Dalai Lama must have regarded his rank and position as divine (even in temporal matters) during the high tide of Chinese authority in Tibet, it is difficult to see how this assertion of the Dalai Lama can have been a “declaration of Tibetan independence” as now apparently argued. It was not the Dalai Lama's personal position which was at issue except in so far as the Chinese had been attempting to oust him—a feat patently beyond their authority in Tibet at any time (which is why Dalai Lamas tended to die young during the days of greatest Chinese power in Tibet. Cf. Portrait, p. 38). It was the extent of his temporal authority within the Sino-Tibetan constitution, not the existence of a scintilla of that authority, which was at issue.\n\nThe Lama, Dalai, op. cit., p. 69Google Scholar, mentions “declarations” issued by his predecessor using a Tibetan seal in place of the apparently customary Chinese seal, and changing the heading on some ancient documents from the formula “By order of the Emperor of China, the Dalai Lama is the Pontiff of Buddhism” to the formula “By order of the Lord Buddha.” It is not clear whether this action by the former Dalai Lama was merely a bit of forgery performed on ancient texts, or was the fixing of a new style on legislative documents. But, assuming the latter to have been the case, all that appears to have been asserted was the ecclesiastical competence of the Dalai Lama independent of Chinese delegation. This is hardly a “declaration of independence” in temporal matters. It is noteworthy that the American colonies of Great Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries normally enacted their own laws in the sole name of the local government and not in the name of the King or of the Government in London. Snow, A. H., The Administration of Dependencies, New York, 1902, pp. 117–118Google Scholar.\n\nMost recently a proclamation dated 8 February 1913 (the date is not absolutely certain; on the difficulty of translating Tibetan dates into Christian dates see Shakabpa, , loc. cit., pp. 15–16Google Scholar) has been argued to have been a “Declaration of Independence.” Shakabpa, , loc. cit., pp. 246–248Google Scholar. Read closely that document will not bear the weight ascribed to it by Shakabpa, a former official of the Lhasa Government now in exile. While it recites in the name of the Dalai Lama the acts of the Lhasa Government in 1913 in attempting to drive out Chinese troops and circumvent the Chinese intention of colonising Tibet, the Proclamation does not purport to cut the governmental ties between Peking and Lhasa in areas in which Peking had actively exercised authority in the past. There is nothing in the Proclamation inconsistent with the Dalai Lama deriving temporal authority from Chinese delegation of some years before. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Proclamation was in fact delivered to any Chinese authorities or to the world in general.\n\nThe patent distortion by the Dalai Lama and his supporters of the meagre evidence of the political intentions of the Lhasa officials in 1911–13 argues powerfully against the proposition that Lhasa's political ties with China were truly intended to be cut at that time. As noted in the text above this note, the issue is of negligible legal significance in this context. It is of substantial legal significance, although still not decisive, with regard to the validity of the McMahon Line border between India and China today. See Rubin, , “Tibet's Declarations of Independence?” 60 A.J.I.L. 812 (1966)Google Scholar.\n\n167 It has been suggested by a reader of a preliminary version of this paper that the failure of either party to register the agreement with the United Nations may be significant. That suggestion seems empty, since the duty to register treaties and international agreements under Article 102 of the Charter applies only to members of the United Nations. Tibet has never been a member nor is the Government of the Chinese People's Republic represented in the U.N. In any case failure to register a treaty or international agreement does not void it; it merely makes it improper to invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations. Neither party has attempted to invoke it there. If an attempt were made to invoke it there, there would remain the question of whether it is better viewed as a “treaty” or a constitutional document—the failure to register it may be taken as evidence that both China and Tibet regarded it as a constitutional document and not a treaty or international agreement. Yet, although that is undoubtedly the view of China, it seems unlikely that that view is now taken by the Dalai Lama's supporters. Thus, to the extent that the point is significant, it would ironically add a scintilla more to the hesitations expressed with regard to the tentative conclusion that the Agreement is void.\n\nIn the argument above, based on the views of the International Commission of Jurists, the position most favourable to the Dalai Lama's supporters has been set forth and adopted for purposes of this discussion. For the sake of completeness two counterarguments should be pointed out. First, the views of the International Commission of Jurists, published in 1967, do not reflect agreement as to the state of law in 1951, when the coercion was applied and the Sino-Tibetan Agreement concluded. The views of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission, Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, advocating in 1953 the “rule” that was eventually adopted in the 1967 draft as Article 49, were strongly disputed in 1958 by his successor as Special Rapporteur, Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice. Compare U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/63 and A/CN.4/115. An interesting summary of the two arguments is in Jennings, R. Y., The Acquisition of Territory in International Law, Manchester, 1963, p. 57Google Scholaret seq. Second, the views of academics as to the existence or precise formulation of a “rule” of international law are not always persuasive in the harsh world in which those “rules” must be applied. There are even cases in which academic formulations of “rules” have been adopted by states in so-called law-making treaties, only to be ignored without apology or explanation being felt necessary.
