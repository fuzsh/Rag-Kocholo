An altitude above 3000 meters is usually defined as high altitude, and most places in Tibet are higher than this level. Therefore, AMS is one of the biggest challenges when travelling in Tibet.

TTB permit – Tibet travel permit\n\nWhen you fly from Kathmandu or any city to Lhasa you will need to show TTB permit (Tibet Visa) when you check in at the airport. Even while buying a flight ticket to Lhasa you need to show this permit.\n\nB. PSB permit – Alien's Travel permit\n\nif you like to visit restricted area you will need to buy an Alien's travel permit issued by PSB of Tibet.\n\nQuestion 02: How to get Tibet travel permits?\n\nAnswer: To get the travel permits, you need to send us below details:\n\n01) Full Name:\n\n02) Sex:\n\n03) Date of birth:\n\n04) Passport number:\n\n05) Nationality\n\nThe details you provide us must be exactly the same as on your passport and you need to tell us your profession because journalists and people that are involved in political matters could be revoked ( they need a different procedure to get a permit).\n\nWe suggest you to apply your permit at least 25 days prior to your entry date. Please note that if you do not book any tour with Alpine Eco Trek, we can't help you get the permits. No one can provide permit only service. Tibet Tourism Corporation will not issue travel permits to individuals and will direct you to a travel agency like Alpine Eco Trek. We can organize a travel permit to almost anywhere in Tibet but only if you book a package tour with us.\n\nQuestion 03: What are the essential points about Tibet Travel Permit?\n\nAnswer:\n\nA. we can provide Travel permit to all kinds of people except Diplomats, Journalists and Governments officials who should travel to Tibet under the arrangement by the Foreign Affairs Office of Tibet Government.\n\nB. After issuing a permit, we could help you to buy your air tickets or train tickets.\n\nC. The permit we provide you is a copy, the original will be with guide, in Tibet you are not allowed to bring permit with you and not even allowed to travel to anywhere you want because except Lhasa you need another permit named as Aliens Permit. Otherwise if you are stopped by the police or army you will be sent out of Tibet or have trouble politically and economically. Tibet is still very sensitive destination in Asia. Moreover, the travel agency which helped to get you the permit will also be in trouble. Therefore seriously not any legitimate travel agency could sell you the Tibet Permit if you do not book a tour with them. We don't think so you would like to be in trouble while you are enjoying your hard earned holiday due to a SOLD Tibet permit after you pay a lot of money for the your trip to Tibet.\n\nD. There is a service charge to get the Tibet Travel Permits. And, it takes time, paper work, transportation fee and delivery fee for us to get a permit for you, so Alpine Eco Trek will charge an extra fee for the permits.\n\nRead more"
