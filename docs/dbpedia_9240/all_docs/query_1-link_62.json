        "text": "LHASA, Tibet - Judging from their work, the Gedun Choephel Artists' Guild might be just another garden-variety group of painters struggling to make names for themselves in any city you can think of. Their artwork, displayed in a small gallery owned by the group, shows the hallmarks of contemporary art everywhere: abstract symbolism, veiled social commentary, mixed-media expressions of postmodernism. But in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, this co-op of 10 Tibetan and two longtime-resident Chinese painters is the beginning of something bigger: a bold attempt to remake a culture bound by centuries of tradition and hemmed in by narrow stereotypes.\n\nThe group opened the gallery, which they call Tibet's first \"semiprofessional art space,\" last year both to show their art and to advance their heady goal of reinterpreting modern Tibetan culture. \"Many people simplify Tibet,\" says Gade (many Tibetans use single names), a 33-year-old Tibetan painter who also teaches fine arts at Tibet University. \"They ask, 'How can Tibet have things like Christmas trees or fast food or Nikes?' But young Tibetans have already accepted these things.\"\n\nLike the work of many of the guild members, Gade's art deals with the interplay between tradition and modernity that is shaking Lhasa. One of his paintings, \"Group Photo,\" combines Western icons with traditional Tibetan figures that he grew up admiring: a few of the dozens of characters pictured include Mickey Mouse, Superman, Karl Marx and Ludongzan, a Tibetan famous for escorting a Chinese princess to Tibet, where she married a Tibetan king in the seventh century.\n\nAnother Gade work is a series of five paintings examining how trees are used symbolically around the world. One painting in the series shows a Christmas tree full of gifts, a comment, he says, on Western material culture. Another shows the Bodhi tree, under which the Buddha found enlightenment in the sixth century, a third is a coin-laden traditional Chinese \"money tree\" and yet another is a futuristic vision.\n\nFor Westerners used to thinking of Tibet as a spiritual Shangri-La removed from the fast-paced changes of the international marketplace, such images are shockingly modern. But for Tibetans living amid the rapid globalization that has gripped Lhasa during the last two decades, they are simply a natural response. \"We aren't deliberately revolutionizing our art,\" the 30-year-old artist Tsering Nyandak says. \"We are just being ourselves.\"\n\nThat is not to deny that their art is clearly Tibetan. Several of the artists in the group create realistic portraits of Tibetan life. Tserang Dhundrup's \"Old Alley,\" for example, an oil painting of photographic veracity, shows a woman carrying her child through a Tibetan lane. Other artists incorporate traditional Buddhist imagery to comment on international politics. \"Wrong Position,\" by Jhamsang, 32, is a fragmented representation of the Buddha set over the artist's rendition of Picasso's \"Guernica,\" a comment on how war conflicts with the harmony that Buddhist doctrines encourage. \"2004,\" an oil painting by the guild member Penpa Tsering, 30, shows a Buddhist saint against a backdrop of Chinese newspaper clippings on the Iraq War. \"Buddhism stresses acceptance and forgiving,\" Mr. Penpa says. \"And right now people need those ideals.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
