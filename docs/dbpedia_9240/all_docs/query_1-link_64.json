        "text": "HISTORY\n\nBefore discovery of this area by the Tibetan Empire more than 1300 years ago, this terrain was a high altitude, marshy wilderness where antelopes roamed the range. Before civilization this land was known as Wotang. Back in the 7th century AD, King Songtsen Gampo, transferred his capital to the area, after discovering it while bathing in the Wotang River. His personal residence was constructed on the Potala hilltop, overlooking the magnificent mountains that rose to the sky from both sides of the river.\n\nThe king conquered the whole Tibetan region and took five wives, one of which was Princess Khri b'Tsun, or \"Royal Lady\" from Nepal, and another Princess Wencheng of the Imperial Tang Court. At that time in this new city, most Tibetans lived in tents, not houses. There was a lot of construction needed to adapt the land to the desires of the new government. Princess Wencheng insisted on a monastery to house her most valuable dowry possession, a statue of Sakyamuni, the Buddha. Thus the Ramoche Temple in Lhasa. Likewise the Napalese Princess Khri b 'Tsun wished to build a monastery for her statue of Sakyamuni, however when construction obstacles continued, Princess Khri b 'Tsun asked Princess Wencheng for advice. She told her, \"Lhasa is a like a Rakshas witch lying on her back, with the Wotang Lake of Lhasa being her heart and water being her blood. Build the monastery on top of the lake and that will rid Lhasa of these evils.\" And so the temple named Lhasa meaning \"the Sacred Land\" (now known as the Jokhang) was built.\n\nThese myths and stories, along with dozens more, delight tourists as they walk back into the timelessness of this awe-inspiring city. From calm alleys to bustling markets and people still living in yesteryear, tourists from around the world who are lucky enough to come while traditions are still strong, leave with a new sense of the world.\n\nPlease note that reports indicate that around 24 or 25 April 2002, demolitions began on a building on the southeast corner where Dekyi Shar Lam (Ch: Beijing Dong Lu) and \"Snow land Street\" meet. Disappointing for tourists, the Beijing government's plans are to demolish the entire block around this building complex, including an old residence called Samding. The area concerned is the block beside (immediately north of) the well-known tourist hotel \"Snowlands,\" including a French restaurant opposite (east of) the Pentoc Hotel and the Xiangbala Hotel. This block contains some important old aristocrat buildings, such as Phunkhang and Ganglha Metok and is one of the few remaining centers of traditional Tibetan buildings. The area is approximately three minutes walk from Jokhang Square, which is the historic centre of Lhasa. The Tibetan quarter is shrinking rapidly. more"
