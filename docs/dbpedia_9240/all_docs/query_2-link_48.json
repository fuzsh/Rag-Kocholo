        "text": "Shangri-La Hotel, Lhasa\n\nLhasa, Tibet\n\nOpened in April 2014, this luxury property is a fitting new addition to the Lhasa hospitality scene. Shangri-La is, after all, the mythical kingdom believed to inhabit the Tibetan plateaus. Located in the city center, this stylish urban retreat allows guests to experience time-honored Tibetan customs - being welcomed with a local drink called chima, for instance, and being presented with a ceremonial khata scarf. Visitors at the Shangri-La Lhasa can enjoy being within strolling distance of this historic city's main attractions, including Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple. For those who find Lhasa's high-altitude landscapes literally breathtaking, there's an oxygen lounge and relaxation center at the resort primed for guest recuperation. As with all Shangri-La properties, local culture plays a vital role in both the hospitality and the décor. At the Lhasa resort, this manifests in traditional architecture and design, with contemporary, luxuriously appointed guest rooms accented with local Tibetan textiles and artworks. Guests are also spoiled with far-reaching views of the mountains, the city and the spectacular Potala Palace.\n\nSongtsam Linka Lhasa\n\nLhasa, Tibet\n\nWhen people close their eyes and imagine Tibet, the iconic Potala Palace may come to mind, and the Songtsam Linka Lhasa positions its guests just a stone’s throw from the famed structure. The palace is located a mere three miles away and is directly visible from the windows and balconies of several of the hotel’s rooms. The hotel itself features slaked lime walls, indigo-carved windows, and a fish-fin-shaped facade – all nods to traditional Tibetan artisans and culture – and the interior maintains an aura of reverence with decorations like wooden floors covered by warm carpets and exquisite wall tapestries. Rooms are spacious, with sitting spaces, balconies, and comfortable beds, and they are equipped with oxygen concentrators to help guests deal with Lhasa’s demanding altitude. There is a Chinese and Tibetan restaurant, which serves excellent home-style dishes, as well as a Western restaurant, where guests will find a breakfast buffet and a selection of wines later in the day. There is also a library and a boutique where guests can purchase souvenirs. Besides Potala Palace, visitors to Lhasa can also explore Jokhang Temple and the Drepung and Sera monasteries, and there are also many natural landscapes to explore in the region.\n\nSt. Regis Lhasa\n\nLhasa, Tibet\n\nOpened in November 2010, the St. Regis Resort in Lhasa stands on eight acres of land at “the roof of the world,\" with sweeping views of the Potala Palace. The spacious 162 rooms and villas with marble baths are decorated with carefully sourced artifacts that reflect the richness of Tibetan culture. There are a variety of restaurants to choose from, including the intimate private wine club Decanter by Haut-Brisson and Si Zi Kang, which serves traditional Tibetan cuisine. The health club boasts an indoor heated swimming pool, a yoga and pilates studio, and Iridium, a spa offering refined indulgence with Tibetan flavor. The business center offers 4 meeting rooms, copy and printing services, and faxing services. Other amenities include secretarial service and 24-hour butler service. The St. Regis Lhasa is located just minutes from the Potala Palace, the famous Barkhor area, Jokang Temple, Norbulinka, and is 46 miles from Gongga International Airport.\n\nHouse of Shambhala\n\nLhasa, Tibet\n\nLocated in a quiet, traditional Tibetan courtyard in the heart of old Lhasa, this boutique hotel is dedicated to architectural preservation and the sustainable development of Tibetan culture. It has six suites and two rooms, all fitted with Tibetan textiles and furnishings and elegant four-poster beds. Enjoy fine Himalayan cuisine in the intimate dining room, tea on the meditation terraces or a meal on the rooftop veranda that has striking views of the Potala Palace and mountains. The House of Shambhala Spa offers massage therapy based on Tibetan Mandala techniques focused on bringing the body into contact with the non-physical world. There is no business center, fitness center or pool. House of Shambhala is about a 90-minute drive from Lhasa Gonggar Airport (LXA).\n\nBrahmaputra Grand\n\nLhasa, Tibet\n\nThe Brahmaputra Grand is an executive hotel of 187 rooms situated in Yangcheng Square, south of holy Lhasa, on the northeastern banks of the Lhasa River. The architecture is Tibetan, though the furnishings are modern, and most rooms have excellent views. Dining at the hotel includes both Chinese and Western restaurants. Facilities available at the Brahmaputra include sauna, business center, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts and a fitness center. The hotel is approximately a 90-minute drive from Lhasa Gonggar Airport (LXA).\n\nWith Remote Lands you'll travel with people who have made Asia the solitary focus of their own lifelong adventure.
