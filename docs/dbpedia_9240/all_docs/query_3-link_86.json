How can the real history be revealed?\n\nwhat do you want to discuss ? Tibetan nationalists dream of yarlung empire and are extremely xenophobic against han and huis. Tibetan rationalists like me appreciate what the CCCP has done.\n\nAs you yourself said the average income of Tibetans have increased exponentially in the last two decades. people are getting richer and living longer. The roads are good and healthcare decent.\n\nI am not saying CCCP is all good. No sir, CCCP has done its share of stupidity but i strongly believe the good outweighs the b\n\nIf you are allowed to visit Tibet. Americans can only visit with an approved tour group. Such stupidity is ridiculous.\n\nany visit to tibet and any other place of china must be approved, what is the point of visa?\n\nas for tour groups, it means you can customize your own plan but you will accompanied by a local guide. thinking about the low density of tibet and the old cia activities, i'd say it is expected.\n\nbtw, i guess we will not and not expected to talk about any history things in this thread?\n\nany visit to tibet and any other place of china must be approved, what is the point of visa?\n\nas for tour groups, it means you can customize your own plan but you will accompanied by a local guide. thinking about the low density of tibet and the old cia activities, i'd say it is expected.\n\nbtw, i guess we will not and not expected to talk about any history things in this thread?\n\nI have visited almost all of China and none of my plans have had to be approved. It is pure stupidity that anyone who wishes to visit Tibet or Xinjiang must have approval to go.\n\nThe point of a visa is that you are allowed to enter the country and visit without barriers any place within the confines of said country.\n\nMy wife spends a month in the U.S. every year and not once has anyone asked to see her passport or her visa. She is free to move around and enjoy everything the country has to offer at her leisure.\n\nTibet (or Xizang) before 1951 wasn't exactly some form of paradise.\n\nBoth the Chinese official accounts and the accounts of Dalai Lama are dubious.\n\nLet's make a relatively fair and square account:\n\nConsiderable economic gains have been achieved since 1951; Tibet's GDP per capital in 2015 was about $4000 USD,\n\nwhich is substantially better than most African states.\n\nDestructions of monasteries and killing of commoners happened.\n\nTibet is currently WAY MORE CONNECTED with the outer world, with both modern infrastructures and equipments.\n\nLet's discuss: is the improvement of quality of life real in Tibet?

She is free to move around and enjoy everything the country has to offer at her leisure.\n\nThat might not be true if China had a history of funding American armed separatist movements(as the CIA did in Tibet) and have large organized sponsors with the purpose of funding American separitist movements.\n\nOne area worthy of attention is whether Amdo and Kham should really be considered traditional Tibetan territory than traditional multi-ethnic territory, and whether Utsang Tibetans are related to Amdo and Kham natives enough to justify the TGIE claim that both should be freed and incorporated under an independent Tibet.\n\nThe powerful Tibetan Empire was a contemporary of the Tang Dynasty that collapsed before the Tang Dynasty, so it was something of a distinct past.\n\nThe debate is that whether Tibet was a country from 1912-1951, but even the Nationalist government maintained at least de jure control of Tibet.\n\nAs a previous poster has stated, Tibet before 1951 was largely in anarchy (or very small local authorities.)\n\nYôḥānān;2457260 said:\n\nThere is the matter of if they wanted that improvement in the first place.\n\nIt may well be true that no one asked the Tibetan people if they wanted change.\n\nIt is also true that no one asked the Tibetan people if they wanted to be subject to feudal theocratic rule under the Lamas.\n\nOn balance it seems the people have more freedom and more opportunity under the present regime.\n\nOne area worthy of attention is whether Amdo and Kham should really be considered traditional Tibetan territory than traditional multi-ethnic territory, and whether Utsang Tibetans are related to Amdo and Kham natives enough to justify the TGIE claim that both should be freed and incorporated under an independent Tibet.\n\nUtsang kham and Amdo are related and considered one people although they all have stereotypes of one another. historically the Amdo tribes and kham have paid tribute to Lhasa even when under the Qing rule. There is an emotional and historical attachment to Lhasa and Utsang region by the kham and amdo people.\n\nPhysically we look very different in different places. For eg a khampa of Dege will look different from a golok khampa who will different to gonjo khampa. Utsang people are generally Mongol looking while Amdo goes from Tajik looking to pure Mongol look. Many of the Amdowas look like Muslim people.\n\nkham and amdo had tusi, which is very different from utsang. the things happened is more complicate than tribes paying tribute to lhasa\n\nIt is very complicated as you said.\n\nMy hometown which is located in Sichuan had to pay two taxes to the Dege King. One was called gandenphodron thre and another called gyanak gyabo thre.\n\nIt literally means the throne tax which was given to Lhasa officialsdirectly and King of China tax which was given to the Dege King who I presume gave it to Beijing.\n\nAmdo tribes paid to taxes to Lhasa and were the most fanatical supporters of Lhasa. Khampas, Mongols and amdo tribes of Amdo/qinghai were hired as soldiers by Lhasa when they wanted to go to war but they only trusted ganzi khampas plus Amdowas and Mongols."
