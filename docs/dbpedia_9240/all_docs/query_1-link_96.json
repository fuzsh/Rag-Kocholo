        "text": "Potala Palace is one of the several iconic landmarks in Tibet known for its brilliant architecture and timeless beauty. Situated in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet, the palace stands tall at an elevation of 12,139 ft. Built around 1,300 years ago, the majestic structure symbolizes the rich history of the region. As the highest palace in the world, the structure provides a spectacular view of Lahsa along with a mesmerizing panoramic view of the surrounding mountains. The palace is not only known for its glorifying design but also holds spiritual significance as the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas.\n\nThe palace was first built by the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo. But later the monks took over the palace which went through multiple expansions and renovations over the centuries. Centuries later, the palace still remains an iconic symbol of Tibetan identity and a representation of the region’s rich heritage. For anyone willing to explore Tibetan architecture, craftsmanship, culture, and spirituality, the Lhasa tour is a perfect way to go about it.\n\nFacts about Potala Palace\n\nHighlights of Potala Palace\n\nThe Great West Hall: It is the largest and most magnificent hall in the palace, with four large chapels and murals depicting the life of the 5th Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Golden Roof Group: It is the most eye-catching feature of the palace, which consists of nine gilded roofs that shine brightly in the sun.\n\nThe Tombs of the Dalai Lamas: You can witness the sacred burial places of Dalai Lamas that are decorated with gold and jewels.\n\nStunning views of the surrounding landscape: It offers a spectacular view of the Lhasa Valley and the surrounding mountains.\n\nA Short History of Potala Palace\n\nPotala Palace’s history is deeply rooted in Tibetan culture. Over the years, the centuries-old structure has witnessed several empires, cultural shifts, and structural transformations. Regardless of the several changes in those years, the palace still remains the perfect embodiment of Tibetan heritage.\n\nInitially, the palace was built under the commission of King Songtsen Gampo. Later, the palace was expanded and renovated by the Great Fifth Dalai Lama in the 17th century. The palace’s spiritual significance comes from the fact that it served as the winter palace for the Dalai Lamas for centuries. But, after the exile of the Dalai Lama in 1959, the Chinese government took over the palace and turned it into a museum.\n\nHistorical Timeline of the Palace\n\nTake a look at some of the important dates in the history of Potala Palace:\n\n7th century: First constructed by King Songtsen Gampo on the Red Hill\n\n1645: Expansion and renovation by the Great Fifth Dalai Lama\n\n1649: The Dalai Lama and his government moved into the Potrang Karpo, a.k.a. White Palace (the lower section of Potala Palace)\n\n1690-1694: Addition of the Potrang Marpo, a.k.a. Red Palace (the upper section of Potala Palace)\n\n1959: The palace underwent a few damages during the Tibetan uprising against China and was later turned into a museum by the Chinese government\n\n1966: The palace was listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nWho Built the Potala Palace in Tibet?\n\nThe Potala Palace was built about 1,300 years ago by Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo. The structure was constructed on Red Hill under the commission of the Tibetan king as a gesture of love for his wife Princess Wencheng of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. Over the centuries, the palace has been renovated and expanded by different Tibetan figures and religious leaders.\n\nAnother major construction happened in 1645 when the Great Fifth Dalai Lama discovered that the site was ideal as a seat of government as advised by his spiritual advisor Konchog Chophel. The palace that we see today is largely the expanded version of the original Potala Palace. However, the expansion took over 45 years to finish. Over the years, further minor structural additions and renovations were carried out by reigning Tibetan rulers and the following Dalai Lamas. Now, the structure is under the authority of the Chinese government with substantial preservation and conservation efforts.\n\nDid you know that there is a rule that forbids any other building from exceeding the elevation of Potala Palace?\n\nArchitecture and Design of Potala Palace\n\nThe Potala Palace is one of the oldest and historically significant architectural structures in the world. As the construction dates back to 637, the ancient design of the palace is surely one of a kind. Located in the Red Hill in Lhasa, Tibet, the dzong fortress structure has two major sections, the Potrang Karpo and the Potrang Marpo with specific functions and characteristics. Likewise, the ornamental designs in every nook and corner of the large structure reflect the magic of ancient Tibetan art and craftsmanship.\n\nThis architectural marvel was constructed with local materials such as stones, clay, and timber and covers an area of approximately 79 acres. The 117 meters (384 ft) tall state-of-the-art design of the palace, from thick walls to ideally positioned windows, can withstand Tibet’s harsh weather conditions and earthquakes. Also, this 13 storeys high palace comprises over 1,000 rooms for various purposes. All in all, the palace’s magnificent architecture, complex detailing, and spiritual resonance make it alluring, attracting thousands of visitors every year.\n\nArchitectural highlights of the palace:\n\nThe strategic position of the palace on a hilltop in Lhasa provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the valley.\n\nThe palace has two sections, the Potrang Karpo (White Palace) and the Potrang Marpo (Red Palace). White Palace is the lower section and serves as administrative and living quarters, while Red Palace is the upper section used for ceremonies, meditation, and spiritual practices.\n\nThe exterior of the palace has towering white-washed walls.\n\nThe exterior structure of the palace is well-decorated with golden ornamental rooftop designs consisting of visually attractive designs.\n\nThe delicate carvings and decorative detailings of the palace reflect Tibetan artistic excellence.\n\nThe colorful murals and Thangkas resemble the cultural heritage of Tibet.\n\nConsists of several sacred relics and statues.\n\nPotala Palace: Winter Palace of the Dalai Lama\n\nThis iconic landmark was the winter residence and administrative center of the Dalai Lamas from 1649 to 1959. In 1649, the Fifth Dalai Lama began the reconstruction of the palace with the addition of additional structures. The location of the palace on the Red Hill in Lhasa between the Drepung and Sera monasteries made it perfect for the abode of the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Dalai Lama residence used to be at Norbulingka during the summer, and he would transfer to Potala Palace during winter. The palace was chosen for winter residency because of its suitable environment for conducting various religious ceremonies and government affairs. Within the castle, the White Palace was the living quarters while the Red Palace was the place for administrative affairs and rituals.\n\nIt remained the Dalai Lama’s winter palace until 1959 when the current Dalai Lama the 14th was exiled to India during the Tibetan uprising. Now, it is no longer his winter residence ever since the Chinese took charge of the Tibetan territory. This change in authority has shifted the traditional functions of the palace. However, the role of this historic structure in representing the Tibetan heritage still remains as important.\n\nReligious and Cultural Significance\n\nThe Potala Palace has played a significant role in embodying Tibetan culture and religion throughout the centuries. As one of the most sacred landmarks in Tibetan Buddhism, the palace has served as a crucial symbol for the cultural identity of the region. Some of the key aspects of the cultural and religious significance of the palace are:\n\nClose association with Tibetan Buddhism\n\nDalai Lama’s resident\n\nPresence of sacred relics and artifacts\n\nOne of the famous sacred sites in Tibet for religious pilgrimage\n\nUnique architectural design\n\nEmblem of Tibetan culture and traditions\n\nListed as UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nWhat’s Inside the Potala Palace?\n\nIt is a complex structure spreading over several acres of land area. The huge fortress has different sections, each with various functionalities. As a major landmark for Tibetan Buddhism, the palace holds numerous significant religious relics and statues. Besides, some of the notable features inside the palace are:\n\nWhite Palace and Red Palace\n\nAssembly hall\n\nGreat west hall\n\nBuddhist chapels\n\nLibrary and archives\n\nLiving quarters\n\nCourtyards and gardens\n\nMurals and Thangkas\n\nAncient relics, statues, and scriptures\n\nHow to get to Potala Palace?\n\nPotala Palace is located on the Red Hill, at Lasha, Tibet.
