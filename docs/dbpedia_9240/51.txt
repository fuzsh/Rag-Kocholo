In 629 AD, after Songtsen Gampo, the 33rd Zanpu (leader) of the Tubo Kingdom, unified all the tribes in Tibet, he selected Lhasa, situated in the Lhasa River Valley, as the new capital of Tubo. He made this choice due to its moderate climate, flat terrain, and fertile land.

The historic market square and pilgrim path have been carefully preserved, retaining a layout and architectural style that embodies traditional Tibetan design.
