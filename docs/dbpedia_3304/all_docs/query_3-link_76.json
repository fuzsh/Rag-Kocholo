        "text": "During one of the darkest periods in American history, voters made a clear choice to change the leadership in Washington, D.C. Amid the lows of the Great Depression, the 1932 Presidential election in the United States was a decisive referendum on the current president's handling of the economic woes afflicting the nation. Most voters hoped the \"New Deal\" promised by the Democratic candidate would quicken the recovery begun under the Republican incumbent candidate. In this article, we will look at the two major candidates, examine the results and major issues, and reflect on the significance of this pivotal election.\n\nThe 1932 Presidential Election Candidates\n\nThe election of 1932 was between the incumbent Herbert Hoover for the Republican Party and the seasoned government official Franklin Delano Roosevelt for the Democrat Party. Both belonged to the upper class but had very different agendas.\n\n1933 Presidential Inauguration Hoover (left) and Roosevelt (right). Source: Architect of the Capitol, AOC on Wikimedia Commons.\n\n1932 Republican Candidate: Herbert Hoover\n\nThe U.S. President in 1932 was Herbert Hoover. Hoover had a humble past with a time as an orphan and a Quaker upbringing. He earned a reputation for efficiency and practicality with a degree from Stanford and an extensive mining and business background. He then served as Secretary of Commerce from 1921 until 1928, when he was elected president. In his first term, the stock market crashed in 1929. Hoover attempted to address the Great Depression that soon followed but not without issues that negatively impacted his popularity.\n\nWhile most Americans did not blame Hoover for the Great Depression, distressed citizens ridiculed the president and his failure to reverse the course of the Depression in many ways. Shantytowns across the nation were called \"Hoovervilles,\" and newspapers used as bedding were called 'Hoover blankets' to attack him on public opinion.\n\n1928 Photo from the Library of Congress of Herbert Hoover. Source: Wikimedia Commons.\n\n1932 Democratic Candidate: Franklin Roosevelt\n\nThe Democratic candidate for the 1932 Presidential election led a life of wealthy privilege. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, widely recognized by the acronym \"FDR,\" was devoted to government service. He served as a State Senator from New York, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and through regular election as Governor of New York State. The Stock Market Crash in October 1929 and the resulting economic Depression hit N.Y. hard. The state was the nation's most populous and had significant manufacturing and agricultural industries. As Governor, Roosevelt attempted to manage the economic situation with minimal success as the problems of the Depression were both national and international.\n\nDid you know that in 1921, FDR became seriously ill and was diagnosed with polio? Despite therapies, he was paralyzed from the waist down and required aid from assistants to give speeches. His use of crutches and eventually a wheelchair was unknown to most of the general public as media tradition was to avoid sensationalizing and discussing disabilities.\n\n1930 photo of N.Y. Gov. Roosevelt. Source: National Archives via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n1932 Presidential Election Issues\n\nThe most decisive issues debated in the political and public arena were related to the country's economy. Between a conservative free market and private assistance (Hoover) and a policy of governmental intervention and centralized programs (FDR), the voters elected the latter.\n\nHoover's Campaign Plan\n\nDuring the campaign, Hoover reiterated his plan for economic recovery through fiscal conservativism. Essentially, by maintaining America's currency basis on the \"gold standard\" and ensuring a balanced federal budget, America would retain stability and recovery as companies hired workers. By the third year of the Depression, the Republican Party nominated Hoover again to the ticket and continued a platform of reserved government intervention.\n\nHoover believed in individual responsibility and the value of hard work and reassured Americans the crisis would resolve. The Republican Party continued to urge local and state organizations, including the Red Cross, YMCA, and the Salvation Army, as well as religious institutions and soup kitchens, to assist the poor rather than the federal government. By 1932, Congress passed, and Hoover signed into law the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that provided financial assistance to the nation's banks and insurers. To the public eye, Hoover appeared stern and reserved, with a sparse and stiff smile.\n\nRoosevelt's Campaign Plan\n\nI pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.\"\n\n–From Roosevelt's 1932 Democratic Party Convention Speech. Source: Library of Congress\n\nRoosevelt's 1932 presidential platform, known as the \"New Deal,\" planned for expansive, direct federal assistance and centralized programs. As public unhappiness over Prohibition was widespread, FDR called for its end. Roosevelt highlighted the 13 million Americans out of work and urged a more active federal approach. Specific groups such as farmers and industrial workers were targeted for direct government assistance. In contrast to his political opponent, Roosevelt was more genial and smiled broadly when in public.\n\nCriticism of the New Deal\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal was a bold plan criticized as too radical and drastic in expanding the scope and power of the federal government. Critics argued higher federal spending and regulation would harm the economy in the long term. Historians have noted some economic improvement after many Roosevelt policies were implemented. Conversely, those effects were short-term and did not end the Great Depression. The war industry during World War Two ended America's worst economic period.\n\nHoover had to run on his policy of addressing the record unemployment figures, bank and stock failures, and growing poverty. Roosevelt was able to position his presidential bid as the experienced outsider who could lead the nation out of the Great Depression. On the campaign trail, FDR blamed the Depression on Hoover and Republicans in Congress. In addition, he offered vague but hopeful plans for economic recovery, relief, and reform. The question was whether or not voters wanted to change leadership during a crisis and if Roosevelt offered a new course and leadership style.\n\nMany voters were unhappy with the major party candidates and their plans. In the 1932 election, the Socialist candidate received 882,000 votes, while a Communist candidate received 103,000 votes.\n\n1932 Presidential Election Results\n\nThis chart of the presidential election results clearly reflects Roosevelt's dominance over Hoover in both the electoral and popular votes.\n\nCANDIDATEPARTYELECTORAL VOTESPOPULAR VOTES✔ Franklin D.

According to the 1930 U.S. Census, there were 122,775,046 citizens. The population was increasing by 15 to 20% every ten years.\n\n1932 Presidential Election Map\n\nWe can see on the 1932 presidential election map the landslide by which FDR was victorious: except for five states, the whole country went Democrat (blue).\n\n1932 Presidential Election Significance\n\nThe significance of this election stands today. The election of Roosevelt ushered in one of the most expansive shifts in federal power. The New Deal would expand the federal role in economic matters and shift the responsibility of action from the private sector and states to Washington, D.C. The voters were willing to accept a bold national strategy with a positive, unflappable leader. While many did not lose faith in Hoover or his policies, enough voters were swayed to try a new approach. The costs of higher budget deficits, increased government regulation, and tariff policies would later be considered as the Depression lingered on into Roosevelt's second term.\n\nThe Democratic Party also brought into its ranks new voting blocs from union workers, many farmers, Catholics, and Jews, while solidifying its base of Southern voters and blacks. The resulting movement of the Democrats toward more liberal policy was striking. The rejection of Hoover and conservative policies were felt beyond the White House. The Democrats also took control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the Congressional election.\n\n1932 Election - Key takeaways\n\nHerbert Hoover, the Republican, was running for re-election against Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic challenger.\n\nThe election occurred during the Great Depression, the worst economic period in U.S. history.\n\nRoosevelt, the Governor of N.Y., planned for a \"New Deal\" for America, while Hoover aimed to continue a less interventionist federal approach.\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal would expand the federal government's role in providing direct relief and instituting economic reforms.\n\nRoosevelt easily beat Hoover, winning 472 electoral votes to Hoover's 59.\n\nThe election would mark a change in government economic policy and dramatically expand the power and size of the federal government."
