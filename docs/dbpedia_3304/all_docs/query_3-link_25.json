Roosevelt's\n\nVisits to Hyde Park During His Presidency.*\n\n*Explanatory Note on Calculation of Dates: Date ranges include only those days in which a significant or substantial part of the day was spent in Hyde Park.

Roosevelt visited his hometown of Hyde Park, New York, while he held the title of President. Included in the timeline are notes on special events relating to the President in Hyde Park; Links to speeches the President made in Hyde Park; Links to selected Press Conferences that the President held in Hyde Park; Links to other documents describing events in Hyde Park during Presidential Visits; and Links to photos of President Roosevelt and others in Hyde Park.\n\n1933 | 1934 | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 | 1939 | 1940 | 1941 | 1942 | 1943 | 1944 | 1945\n\n1933\n\nJuly 29, 1933 -
