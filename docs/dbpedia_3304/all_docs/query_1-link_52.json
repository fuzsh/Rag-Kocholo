        "text": "Was the New Deal a good deal?\n\nSince shortly after the treaty that ended World War I, the world economy struggled. Germany was straddled with harsh reparation debts and their economy stalled. Farm income in the United States fell dramatically with the end of wartime price supports, and with nearly half of the U.S. population living in rural areas, American buying power plunged. At the same time, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imported items, helping manufacturing but raising prices for consumers. The stock market boomed, and investors poured money into stocks far beyond their earning capacity. Eventually, these and other factors combined to bring the stock market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the greatest economic downturn ever experienced in the United States.\n\nHerbert Hoover and the Market Crash\n\nHerbert Hoover was elected president in 1928 and assumed office while prosperity was still running high. When the market crashed in October, he and many other economists saw it as a temporary slide and predicted quick recovery. As unemployment continued to rise and business slumped, Hoover proposed some new efforts by the federal government. His main idea was to provide incentives and financial supports to business to get firms hiring and selling again. He favored lower taxes and a balanced budget. He also encouraged greater volunteer contributions to charities for the poor and unemployed, but he opposed any direct relief efforts to individuals fearing the welfare would discourage the unemployed from looking for work.\n\nNew Deal Programs\n\nAnger against Hoover grew rapidly through 1931 and 1932, leading to the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. While Roosevelt also talked about balanced budgets during the campaign, he changed courses between his November election and March inaugural as national conditions became worse. With the Democratic majorities in Congress that were elected with him, Roosevelt pushed through a remarkable agenda of programs that radically changed the relationship of individuals to the federal government. The New Deal created work programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration that put people to work on public parks, roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects and hired teachers and artists. The Civilian Conservation Corps hired, fed and clothed teenage boys and sent most of their salaries back to support their families. The Agriculture Adjustment Act provided payments to farmers who agreed to limit their production. It was Roosevelt's policy that, in times of recession, the government should spend to spur economic growth, even if that means adding to the federal debt.\n\nWhile New Deal programs provided a safety net to hundreds of thousands of American families, there is debate among economic historians about their overall effectiveness. What finally ended the Depression was American entry into World War II with a military draft and government contracts for planes, tanks, ships, munitions, uniforms and farm products. However, on the political side, the hope that the New Deal offered those struggling, including many Iowa farm families, was a factor that prevented rebellions against the government at all levels. It also reconfigured the American political landscape as African Americans, other urban-based minorities and labor unions leaving the Republican Party to form a strong Democratic coalition.\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nHow did Franklin Roosevelt’s policies differ from Herbert Hoover's?\n\nWhite House Insider Theodore Joslin's Account of the Depression and Herbert Hoover's 1932 Presidential Campaign, 1932 (Document)\n\n\"Untitled\" Clifford Berryman Depression-Era Cartoon, December 23, 1932 (Political Cartoon)\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover's Letter to Senator Simeon Fess , February 21, 1933 (Document)\n\n\"That Conquering Cooperative Spirit!\" March 7, 1933 (Political Cartoon)\n\n\"A Capitol Hill May Day Parade,\" May 1, 1933 (Image)\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Campaign Address at Madison Square Garden, October 31, 1936 (Document)\n\nHow did the New Deal affect the relationship between citizens and the national government?\n\nDepression-Era Breadlines, ca. 1932 (Image)\n\nMen Stringing Rural Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Transmission Lines, 1933 (Image)\n\n\"The New Deal\" Mural, ca. 1934 (Image)\n\nLetter from Edwin Locke to Depression-Era Photographer Arthur Rothstein, July 14, 1936 (Document)\n\nImpoverished Family of Nine during the Great Depression in New Mexico, August 1936 (Image)\n\n\"A Day In the Life of a New Dealer\" Newspaper Article, October 20, 1936 (Document)\n\nPeople Waiting for Relief Checks in Calipatria, California, March 1937 (Image)\n\nInterview with Italian Munitions Worker Charles Fusco, 1938 (Document)\n\nFederal Writers' Project Interview of Henry Gill, between 1938 and 1939 (Document)\n\nTwo Teenage Girls Participating in the National Youth Administration in Iowa, 1940 (Image)\n\n\"American Guide Week\" Pamphlet, 1941 (Document)\n\nHow effective were New Deal policies in bringing relief from the effects of the Great Depression for all Americans?\n\nLetter from Edgar Harlan to H.O.
