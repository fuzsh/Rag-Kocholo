        "text": "VisitScotland has announced it will close its 25 information centres over the next two years as part of a new strategy to influence tourists in the planning stage of their trip. VisitScotland chairman Lord Thurso said research had shown it had a \"more impactful\" role to play in providing information before people travel. He said: \"The tourism landscape has changed significantly in recent years. \"The demand for iCentres has reduced while the demand for online information and booking has continued to grow. \"In order to continue building demand and growing the value of tourism and events, it is vitally important that we target channels we know visitors use to influence them to visit Scotland.\" https://lnkd.in/e9NKcJU2 #tourism #Scotland\n\nStarting your own business in tourism in northern Norway: From vision to reality As the pristine landscapes and majestic beauty of northern Norway attract an increasing number of tourists year after year, it is a prime time for aspiring entrepreneurs to grasp the opportunity and establish a successful tourism-related business. From travel bureaus to Airbnb experiences, there are a plethora of avenues to capitalize on the booming tourism industry. If you have a vision for your own business or a dream you want to realize, here are some solutions and ideas for an approach in creating a thriving tourist-based venture. Before diving into specific tourism niche ideas and approaches, it is important to lay the groundwork for running a successful business. To begin with, extensive market research must be conducted to determine which types of travel experiences resonate well with the current demographic of visitors. Additionally, identifying your target audience is crucial; knowing their preferences, limitations, and budget constraints will enable you to tailor your services accordingly. Once you have gathered sufficient data on your potential customers and understand the driving factors behind their visit to northern Norway, it's time to consider which businesses align with your skills and passions: 1. Travel bureau: Starting a travel agency can be an attractive option if you possess good organizational skills and enjoy crafting unique experiences for visitors. As demand grows for specialized itineraries in northern Norway, you can branch out by collaborating with local tour operators or offer customized packages. 2. Wildlife activities: Northern Norway is well-known for its breathtaking wildlife including whales, seals, and birds. Creating guided tours or collaborating with existing wildlife excursion companies can provide travelers with unforgettable encounters. 3. Snowmobile & husky tours: Winter adventures are one of the main appeals of this region, with tourists eager to ride across snowy landscapes on snowmobiles or husky-driven sledges.

The objective of Accessible Tourism is to allow all people the experience of travelling as independently as possible and to have the opportunity to get to know new realities and new locations, as an experience leading to personal growth. Increasingly this is being understood as everyone‚Äôs right. The impact of accessible tourism thus goes beyond the tourist beneficiaries to the wider society, ingraining accessibility into the social and economic values of society. Accessible tourism destinations that create #environments, products and services suitable for people with specific access requirements will experience positive effects in terms of increasing #tourism flows, improved economic returns and enhanced competitiveness.

According to Netherlands Board of Tourism & Conventions (NBTC), every Dutch individual should be able to benefit from tourism. But how can this be achieved if residents have different attitudes towards tourism and perceive tourism impacts differently? Although characteristics and values differ, research within the urban areas of Provincie Zuid-Holland, The Netherlands, shows that the main frustrations among all resident types are crowd formation within their living environment and ignorance of their municipality. Accordingly, a solution is created to mitigate these issues, which consequently improves residents' Quality of Life and liveability of their residence. How do you perceive tourism in your living environment? #hotelschoolthehague #provinciezuidholland #gemeenterotterdam #gemeentedenhaag #gemeenteleiden #gemeentedelft #gemeentegouda #cityhospitality #tourism\n\nüåç The importance of local tourism üåç At Mhikes, we are passionate about travel and adventure. We firmly believe in the importance of unveiling and appreciating the treasures of each region. Today, we want to share with you why local tourism is so crucial. üåç 1. When you promote local travel, you contribute to the economy of your own region by helping local businesses thrive, for example. 2. Each region has its own history, culture, and unique traditions. By traveling locally, you may discover that the most astonishing treasures are right on your doorstep. 3. Local tourism tends to have a lower environmental impact than long-distance travel. More train journeys, for example, mean fewer carbon emissions, contributing to the protection of our planet. We are discussing this because it's a subject close to our hearts, and we have ensured that Mhikes enables tour operators to offer this style of travel. Indeed, with Mhikes, you, as tour operators, can create unique itineraries that showcase the most beautiful spots in your regions, the best local restaurants, viewpoints, and more. Feel free to share your thoughts on local tourism with usüí≠ #localtourism #tourism #travel credit üì∑ : Mael Balland\n\nHappy World Tourism Day!üß≥ On the 27th of September, we celebrate the power of travel to connect people, cultures and economies. ‚úàÔ∏è Today, we encourage you to: üó∫Ô∏è Explore a new place: Whether it is a city, town, or country that you have never visited before, make an effort to explore a new place. üó∫Ô∏è Learn about a new culture.
