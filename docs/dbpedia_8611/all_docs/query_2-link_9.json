Swanson\n\nA Fascinating Account of the Evolutionary\n\nDevelopment of Impressionist Painting Within\n\nthe Former Soviet Union\n\nIn this volume lavishly illustrated with 176 color plates, art\n\nhistorian Vern G. Swanson, Ph.D. analyzes the body of\n\nwork now considered by many to be the twentieth century's\n\nmajor realist school of painting. Soviet Impressionism\n\ntraces the discovery of Russia's \"hidden treasures\" in the\n\nlate 1980s to their introduction into the western world\n\nthroughout the early '90s and to their broad acceptance\n\ntoday. Starting with the years leading up to the Bolshevik\n\nRevolution in 1917, the author describes in sixteen chapters\n\nthe evolution of the artists and the era that influenced their\n\nwork. Swanson's narrative explains the distinctions within\n\nthe genre in straight forward prose, well annotated and\n\nreferenced. Further, it places this art in the context of one of\n\nthe most turbulent times in history: through two World Wars\n\nand within the rise and fall of Communism. Dr. Swanson's\n\ninsights into the artists' on-going challenge to maintain\n\nartistic integrity while avoiding denunciation or imprisonment\n\ncontribute to the uniqueness of this masterful work. Its\n\nimmense scope, depth and scholarship commend it as an\n\nindispensable book for anyone interested in this dramatic\n\nsubject.\n\nDr. Vern G. Swanson's Soviet Impressionism dispels harsh\n\nstereotypes of the twentieth century Russian Impressionist\n\nschool of painting. During the past eleven years Dr.\n\nSwanson has made sixteen trips to Russia and other\n\ncountries of the former Soviet Union, visiting the studios of\n\nsome 400 artists. Such credentials qualify him as one of\n\nthe foremost experts on the genre, and he has written\n\nnumerous catalogs and articles. In a treatise entitled \"The\n\nPhenomenon of Soviet Art,\" he termed the introduction of\n\nmuseum quality paintings from the former USSR into the\n\nWestern European and American art scene the most\n\nsignificant art story of the 1990s. He is also known for his\n\npublications on academic-realists of the nineteenth century,\n\nespecially Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema and John William\n\nGodward. A graduate in art history from Brigham Young\n\nUniversity and the University of Utah, he holds a doctorate\n\nfrom the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London.\n\nSince 1980 he has been director of the Springville Museum\n\nof Art in Springville, Utah. Previously he served at the\n\nNational Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and as\n\nassistant professor of art history at Auburn University.\n\nPublished in England by the Antique Collectors' Club\n\nLimited, 303 pages, 11,5 x 9,5 inches, 176 color plates\n\nwith numerous black and white photographs.\n\nFor review of more paintings by Leningrad artists presented in this\n\nvolume please visit the following pages:\n\nOvchinnikov Vladimir (1911-1978)\n\nGalakhov Nikolai (b.1928)\n\nTkachev Mikhail (b.1912)\n\nKopinina Tatyana (b.1921)\n\nKostenko Elena (b.1925)\n\nTimkov Nikolai (1912-1993)\n\nVeselova Nina (1924-1961)\n\nNazina Vera (b.1931)\n\nLomakin Oleg (b.1924)\n\nTatarenko Alexander (1925-1991)\n\nBeloussov Piotr (1912-1989)\n\nLavrenko Boris (1920-1990)\n\nNeprintsev Yuri (1909-1996)\n\nPozdneev Nikolai (1930-1978)\n\nLubimov Alexander (1879-1955)\n\nFrentz Rudolf (1888-1966)\n\nor please visit Search Art by Artist page\n\nor Search Art by Subject Categories page."
