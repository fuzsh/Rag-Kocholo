        "text": "I was on my way back from Spokane over the weekend where we decided to stop in Moses Lake. We actually like Moses Lake quite a bit as it has some cool shops and restaurants and it's nice for the drive back to Yakima as it breaks the trip up so instead of driving 3 straight hours it's right in the middle so an hour and a half there, then an hour and a half home.\n\nWe stopped by a diner-type place that seemed popular enough but it was at an off-meal time so it wasn't as crowded as it usually is. That's always the perfect time to go out to eat.\n\nIt's one of those 'breakfast all day' type of places. Often times when it has the option for breakfast all day, I'll get the breakfast. Unfortunate for my own rule of thumb, they also had monte cristo on the menu so I opted for that instead. I mean, it uses french toast so it's kinda like breakfast? Not really, but still.\n\nOn the way out they had these gigantic cookies under the cash register. I mean, they were big. How could I resist?\n\nI didn't.\n\nI bought three. The chocolate chip, the peanut butter and a no-bake style cookie (think chocolate mountain but flat).\n\nNo offense to the snickerdoodle cookies. In retrospect, I should have bought one of those, too.\n\nThese cookies are ginormous and taste great, too. I would say the chocolate chip could definitely use more chocolate chips in them, maybe even some chocolate chunks, but they all taste great and worth the stop if you find yourself at Bob's Cafe in Moses Lake.\n\nLOOK: 35 Vintage Cereals That Perfectly Captured Pop Culture Moments\n\nMovies and TV shows have always found ways to partner with cereal companies as part of their promotion strategy.
