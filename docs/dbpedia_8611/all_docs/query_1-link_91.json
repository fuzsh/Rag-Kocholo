        "text": "Recreation is an important issue for protected areas and especially for national parks where visitor numbers are growing. This can be seen as a result of the increasing interest in nature- and landscape based recreation. Conse- quently, there is a rising demand to manage this kind of human use accordingly. Therefore, measures must be based on well-founded data as well as widespread knowledge and understanding of recreation. Associated investigations must not only focus on visitors. Interest must also inhere to infrastructure, nature- and landscape compatible activity forms, and stakeholders. Another aspect is the need to incorporate protected areas in a larger planning framework. All too of- ten national parks are regarded as something apart from the adjacent lands. But particularly recreation in park areas cannot be seen separately from the surroundings. By integrating all data regarding to recreation in databases and GIS, persons responsible for management-decisions can gain a com...\n\nIn order to successfully manage natural recreational sites, it is fundamental to have a comprehensive understanding of recreational use in the outdoors. Depending on the research question or a management problem to solve, scientists try to identify groups that respond to a certain situation in a similar way. Such knowledge seems to be useful while trying to satisfy visitors’ needs and to assure the conservation goals. It is argued that focusing on the visitors themselves and their typological forms helps explain why people are attracted to specific destinations (Jafari 1989, 26–27 in Wickens 2002).\n\nThe aim of this paper is to contribute to improving visitor monitoring in the Tatra National Park, based on the results obtained from the pilot use of a counting device. A direct data collection method was applied in order to monitor the number of visits. In the study period from May 31, 2008, to November 20, 2008, a counting device with pyroelectric detector (Eco Twin) registered the exact number of tourists entering the specified sector of the hiking trail that leads from the crossing near Žabí brook to Rysy peak. During the total observation period, the system registered 96 366 traverses. As a result, an average daily volume of visits and a total volume of visits for the selected trail segment were identified. Temporal changes in the intensity of recreational use on a weekly and daily basis were observed for the period from June to October 2008 as well as the acceptance by visitors of seasonal trail closure. The current number of visitors was related to the specified carrying capacity of the trail and the impact of weather on the number of visitors was also taken into account. For the next period, we suggested further lines of investigation. Extension and improvement of research in this area is urgently needed because the amount and dynamics of visits to the Tatra mountains has changed in recent years. This might have an impact on the environment of the national park and biosphere reserve. The management will have to take this fact into account."
