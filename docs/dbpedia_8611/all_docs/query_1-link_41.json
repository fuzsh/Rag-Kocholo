W.; El Gabaly, F.; Stavila, V.; ...\n\n2016-03-23\n\nIn this study, hydrogen diffusion impacts the performance of solid-state hydrogen storage materials and contributes to the embrittlement of structural materials under hydrogen-containing environments. In atomistic simulations, the diffusion energy barriers are usually calculated using molecular statics simulations where a nudged elastic band method is used to constrain a path connecting the two end points of an atomic jump. This approach requires prior knowledge of the âend pointsâ. For alloy and defective systems, the number of possible atomic jumps with respect to local atomic configurations is tremendous. Even when these jumps can be exhaustively studied, it is still unclear howmoreÂ Â» they can be combined to give an overall diffusion behavior seen in experiments. Here we describe the use of molecular dynamics simulations to determine the overall diffusion energy barrier from the Arrhenius equation. This method does not require information about atomic jumps, and it has additional advantages, such as the ability to incorporate finite temperature effects and to determine the pre-exponential factor. As a test case for a generic method, we focus on hydrogen diffusion in bulk aluminum. We find that the challenge of this method is the statistical variation of the results. However, highly converged energy barriers can be achieved by an appropriate set of temperatures, output time intervals (for tracking hydrogen positions), and a long total simulation time. Our results help elucidate the inconsistencies of the experimental diffusion data published in the literature. The robust approach developed here may also open up future molecular dynamics simulations to rapidly study diffusion properties of complex material systems in multidimensional spaces involving composition and defects.Â«Â less\n\nTemperature- and composition-dependent hydrogen diffusivity in palladium from statistically-averaged molecular dynamics\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhou, Xiaowang; Heo, Tae Wook; Wood, Brandon C.\n\nSolid-state hydrogen storage materials undergo complex phase transformations whose kinetics is often limited by hydrogen diffusion.

Here we perform robust statistically-averaged molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a well-converged analytical expression for hydrogen diffusivity in bulk palladium that is valid throughout all stages of the reaction. Our studies confirm significant dependence of the diffusivity on composition and temperature that elucidate key trends in the available experimental measurements. Whereas at low hydrogen compositions, a single process dominates, atmoreÂ Â» high hydrogen compositions, diffusion is found to exhibit behavior consistent with multiple hopping barriers.

K.; Murali, K. V. R. M.\n\n2015-01-21\n\nUsing first-principles simulations, we have computed incorporation energies and diffusion barriers of ammonia, the nitrogen molecule and atomic nitrogen in monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO{sub 2}). Our calculations show that ammonia is likely to dissociate into an NH{sub 2} molecular unit, whereas the nitrogen molecule remains as a molecule either in the interstitial space or at an oxygen lattice site. The lowest energy pathway for the diffusion of atomic nitrogen interstitials consists of the hopping of the nitrogen interstitial between neighboring three-coordinated lattice oxygen atoms that share a single Hf atom, and the barrier for such hops is determined by a switchingmoreÂ Â» mechanism. The substitutional nitrogen atom shows a preference for diffusion through the doubly positive oxygen vacancy-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, we have investigated the impact of nitrogen atoms on the diffusion barriers of oxygen and hydrogen interstitials in m-HfO{sub 2}. Our results show that nitrogen incorporation has a significant impact on the barriers for oxygen and hydrogen diffusion: nitrogen atoms attract oxygen and hydrogen interstitials diffusing in the vicinity, thereby slowing down (reducing) their diffusion (diffusion length)Â«Â less\n\nEffect of dual-dielectric hydrogen-diffusion barrier layers on the performance of low-temperature processed transparent InGaZnO thin-film transistors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTari, Alireza; Wong, William S.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nDual-dielectric SiOx/SiNx thin-film layers were used as back-channel and gate-dielectric barrier layers for bottom-gate InGaZnO (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The concentration profiles of hydrogen, indium, gallium, and zinc oxide were analyzed using secondary-ion mass spectroscopy characterization. By implementing an effective H-diffusion barrier, the hydrogen concentration and the creation of H-induced oxygen deficiency (H-Vo complex) defects during the processing of passivated flexible IGZO TFTs were minimized. A bilayer back-channel passivation layer, consisting of electron-beam deposited SiOx on plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-deposition (PECVD) SiNx films, effectively protected the TFT active region from plasma damage and minimized changes in the chemical composition of the semiconductor layer. A dual-dielectric PECVD SiOx/PECVD SiNx gate-dielectric, using SiOx as a barrier layer, also effectively prevented out-diffusion of hydrogen atoms from the PECVD SiNx-gate dielectric to the IGZO channel layer during the device fabrication.\n\nDiffusion barriers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNicolet, M. A.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe choice of the metallic film for the contact to a semiconductor device is discussed. One way to try to stabilize a contact is by interposing a thin film of a material that has low diffusivity for the atoms in question. This thin film application is known as a diffusion barrier. Three types of barriers can be distinguished. The stuffed barrier derives its low atomic diffusivity to impurities that concentrate along the extended defects of a polycrystalline layer. Sacrificial barriers exploit the fact that some (elemental) thin films react in a laterally uniform and reproducible fashion. Sacrificial barriers have the advantage that the point of their failure is predictable. Passive barriers are those most closely approximating an ideal barrier. The most-studied case is that of sputtered TiN films. Stuffed barriers may be viewed as passive barriers whose low diffusivity material extends along the defects of the polycrystalline host.\n\nDiffusion of hydrogen into and through Î³-iron by density functional theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChohan, Urslaan K.; Koehler, Sven P. K.; Jimenez-Melero, Enrique\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis study is concerned with the early stages of hydrogen embrittlement on an atomistic scale. We employed density functional theory to investigate hydrogen diffusion through the (100), (110) and (111) surfaces of Î³-Fe. The preferred adsorption sites and respective energies for hydrogen adsorption were established for each plane, as well as a minimum energy pathway for diffusion. The H atoms adsorb on the (100), (110) and (111) surfaces with energies of â¼4.06 eV, â¼3.92 eV and â¼4.05 eV, respectively. The barriers for bulk-like diffusion for the (100), (110) and (111) surfaces are â¼0.6 eV, â¼0.5 eV and â¼0.7 eV, respectively. We compared these calculated barriers with previously obtained experimental data in an Arrhenius plot, which indicates good agreement between experimentally measured and theoretically predicted activation energies. Texturing austenitic steels such that the (111) surfaces of grains are preferentially exposed at the cleavage planes may be a possibility to reduce hydrogen embrittlement.\n\nLiquid metal hydrogen barriers\n\nDOEpatents\n\nGrover, George M.; Frank, Thurman G.; Keddy, Edward S.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nHydrogen barriers which comprise liquid metals in which the solubility of hydrogen is low and which have good thermal conductivities at operating temperatures of interest.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the influence of rhenium impurity on hydrogen isotopes retention in tungsten. First-principle calculations were used to study the properties of hydrogen solution and diffusion in perfect tungsten-rhenium lattice. The interstitial hydrogen still prefers the tetrahedral site in presence of rhenium, and rhenium atom cannot act directly as a trapping site of hydrogen. The presence of rhenium in tungsten raises the solution energy and the real normal modes of vibration on the ground state and the transition state, compared to hydrogen in pure tungsten. Without zero point energy corrections, the presence of rhenium decreases slightly the migration barrier. It is found that although the solution energy would tend to increase slightly with the rising of the concentration of rhenium, but which does not influence noticeably the solution energy of hydrogen in tungsten-rhenium alloy. The solubility and diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in perfect tungsten and tungsten-rhenium alloy have been estimated, according to Sievert's law and harmonic transition state theory. The results show the solubility of hydrogen in tungsten agrees well the experimental data, and the presence of Re would decrease the solubility and increase the diffusivity for the perfect crystals.\n\nApoplastic Diffusion Barriers in Arabidopsis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchreiber, Lukas; Franke, Rochus Benni; Geldner, Niko; Reina-Pinto, JosÃ© J.; Kunst, Ljerka\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDuring the development of Arabidopsis and other land plants, diffusion barriers are formed in the apoplast of specialized tissues within a variety of plant organs. While the cuticle of the epidermis is the primary diffusion barrier in the shoot, the Casparian strips and suberin lamellae of the endodermis and the periderm represent the diffusion barriers in the root. Different classes of molecules contribute to the formation of extracellular diffusion barriers in an organ- and tissue-specific manner. Cutin and wax are the major components of the cuticle, lignin forms the early Casparian strip, and suberin is deposited in the stage II endodermis and the periderm. The current status of our understanding of the relationships between the chemical structure, ultrastructure and physiological functions of plant diffusion barriers is discussed. Specific aspects of the synthesis of diffusion barrier components and protocols that can be used for the assessment of barrier function and important barrier properties are also presented.

J.\n\n2012-02-01\n\nNitride semiconductors are known to suffer from low p-type doping efficiency due to the high activation energy of Mg acceptors and the compensation of hole carriers. To enhance hole carrier concentration, the hydrogen co-doping method is widely used, in which hydrogen is intentionally doped with Mg dopants and removed by subsequent thermal annealing. In this work, we perform first-principles density functional calculations to study the stability and diffusion of hydrogen in Mg-doped GaN. For the exchange-correlation potential, we employ both the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof and the hybrid density functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof. We examine the diffusion pathways and dissociation barriers of H from the Mg-H complex using the nudged elastic band and dimer methods. We compare the results of the GGA and hybrid density functional calculations for the stability of various H interstitial configurations and the migration barriers for H diffusion. Finally, using the calculated migration barriers as inputs, we perform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for the dissociation of the Mg-H complex and find that the Mg acceptors are activated by thermal annealing up to 700-800 ^oC, in good agreement with experiments.\n\nStrain effect on the adsorption, diffusion, and molecular dissociation of hydrogen on Mg (0001) surface\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLei, Huaping; Wang, Caizhuang; Yao, Yongxin; Wang, Yangang; Hupalo, Myron; McDougall, Dan; Tringides, Michael; Ho, Kaiming\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe adsorption, diffusion, and molecular dissociation of hydrogen on the biaxially strained Mg (0001) surface have been systematically investigated by the first principle calculations based on density functional theory. When the strain changes from the compressive to tensile state, the adsorption energy of H atom linearly increases while its diffusion barrier linearly decreases oppositely. The dissociation barrier of H2 molecule linearly reduces in the tensile strain region. Through the chemical bonding analysis including the charge density difference, the projected density of states and the Mulliken population, the mechanism of the strain effect on the adsorption of H atom and the dissociation of H2 molecule has been elucidated by an s-p charge transfer model. With the reduction of the orbital overlap between the surface Mg atoms upon the lattice expansion, the charge transfers from p to s states of Mg atoms, which enhances the hybridization of H s and Mg s orbitals. Therefore, the bonding interaction of H with Mg surface is strengthened and then the atomic diffusion and molecular dissociation barriers of hydrogen decrease accordingly. Our works will be helpful to understand and to estimate the influence of the lattice deformation on the performance of Mg-containing hydrogen storage materials.\n\nHydrogen diffusion in Zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIngrin, Jannick; Zhang, Peipei\n\n2016-04-01\n\nHydrogen mobility in gem quality zircon single crystals from Madagascar was investigated through H-D exchange experiments. Thin slices were annealed in a horizontal furnace flushed with a gas mixture of Ar/D2(10%) under ambient pressure between 900 Â° C to 1150 Â° C. FTIR analyses were performed on oriented slices before and after each annealing run. H diffusion along [100] and [010] follow the same diffusion law D = D0exp[-E /RT], with log D0 = 2.24 Â± 1.57 (in m2/s) and E = 374 Â± 39 kJ/mol. H diffusion along [001] follows a slightly more rapid diffusion law, with log D0 = 1.11 Â± 0.22 (in m2/s) and E = 334 Â± 49 kJ/mol. H diffusion in zircon has much higher activation energy and slower diffusivity than other NAMs below 1150 Â° C even iron-poor garnets which are known to be among the slowest (Blanchard and Ingrin, 2004; Kurka et al. 2005). During H-D exchange zircon incorporates also deuterium. This hydration reaction involves uranium reduction as it is shown from the exchange of U5+ and U4+ characteristic bands in the near infrared region during annealing. It is the first time that a hydration reaction U5+ + OH- = U4+ + O2- + 1/2H2, is experimentally reported. The kinetics of deuterium incorporation is slightly slower than hydrogen diffusion, suggesting that the reaction is limited by hydrogen mobility. Hydrogen isotopic memory of zircon is higher than other NAMs. Zircons will be moderately retentive of H signatures at mid-crustal metamorphic temperatures. At 500 Â° C, a zircon with a radius of 300 Î¼m would retain its H isotopic signature over more than a million years. However, a zircon is unable to retain this information for geologically significant times under high-grade metamorphism unless the grain size is large enough. Refrences Blanchard, M. and Ingrin, J.

Tungsten surface is prepared by cumulative irradiation of the 25 eV deuterium atoms at various fluences. The diffusion coefficients for T>500K and various D concentrations were calculated from the average slope of the mean square displacements of deuterium as functions of time. The accumulation of deuterium suppresses its diffusion at all temperatures. The results are in a reasonable agreement with the existing experiments. Supported by the LDRD of PPPL.\n\nFirst-principles-based kinetic Monte Carlo studies of diffusion of hydrogen in NiâAl and NiâFe binary alloys\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nTafen, De Nyago\n\n2015-02-14\n\nThe diffusion of dilute hydrogen in fcc NiâAl and NiâFe binary alloys was examined using kinetic Monte Carlo method with input kinetic parameters obtained from first-principles density functional theory. The simulation involves the implementation of computationally efficient energy barrier model that describes the configuration dependence of the hydrogen hopping. The predicted hydrogen diffusion coefficients in Ni and Ni 89.4Fe 10.6 are compared well with the available experimental data. In NiâAl, the model predicts lower hydrogen diffusivity compared to that in Ni. Overall, diffusion prefactors and the effective activation energies of H in NiâFe and NiâAl are concentration dependent of themoreÂ Â» alloying element. Furthermore, the changes in their values are the results of the short-range order (nearest-neighbor) effect on the interstitial diffusion of hydrogen in fcc Ni-based alloys.Â«Â less\n\nReactive diffusion in the presence of a diffusion barrier: Experiment and model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMangelinck, D.; Luo, T.; Girardeaux, C.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nReactions in thin films and diffusion barriers are important for applications such as protective coatings, electrical contact, and interconnections. In this work, the effect of a barrier on the kinetics of the formation for a single phase by reactive diffusion is investigated from both experimental and modeling point of views. Two types of diffusion barriers are studied: (i) a thin layer of W deposited between a Ni film and Si substrate and (ii) Ni alloy films, Ni(1%W) and Ni(5%Pt), that form a diffusion barrier during the reaction with the Si substrate. The effect of the barriers on the kinetics of Î´-Ni2Si formation is determined by in situ X ray diffraction and compared to models that explain the kinetic slowdown induced by both types of barrier. A linear parabolic growth is found for the deposited barrier with an increasing linear contribution for increasing barrier thickness. On the contrary, the growth is mainly parabolic for the barrier formed by the reaction between an alloy film and the substrate. The permeability of the two types of barrier is determined and discussed. The developed models fit well with the dedicated model experiments, leading to a better understanding of the barrier effect on the reactive diffusion and allowing us to predict the barrier behaviour in various applications.\n\nDiffusion of Hydrogen and Helium in Inconel 625\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPalosz, W.; Gillies, D.; Lehoczky, S.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nDiffusion parameters for hydrogen and helium in Inconel 625 were investigated. The dependence of permeability of hydrogen in the temperature range 310 - 750 C is given. Solubility of hydrogen at 1 atm in the range 640 - 860 C was determined and diffusivity of the gas was calculated. Experiments with diffusion and solubility at 0.09 atm suggest a molecular mechanism of solution of hydrogen in the material. Diffusivity of helium was estimated at less than 10(exp -18) sq cm/s (at 1040 C).\n\nFirst-principles multiple-barrier diffusion theory. The case study of interstitial diffusion in CdTe\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nYang, Ji -Hui; Park, Ji -Sang; Kang, Joongoo; ...\n\n2015-02-17\n\nThe diffusion of particles in solid-state materials generally involves several sequential thermal-activation processes. However, presently, diffusion coefficient theory only deals with a single barrier, i.e., it lacks an accurate description to deal with multiple-barrier diffusion. Here, we develop a general diffusion coefficient theory for multiple-barrier diffusion. Using our diffusion theory and first-principles calculated hopping rates for each barrier, we calculate the diffusion coefficients of Cd, Cu, Te, and Cl interstitials in CdTe for their full multiple-barrier diffusion pathways. As a result, we found that the calculated diffusivity agrees well with the experimental measurement, thus justifying our theory, which is generalmoreÂ Â» for many other systems.Â«Â less\n\nMaterial Barriers to Diffusive Mixing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaller, George; Karrasch, Daniel\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTransport barriers, as zero-flux surfaces, are ill-defined in purely advective mixing in which the flux of any passive scalar is zero through all material surfaces. For this reason, Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) have been argued to play the role of mixing barriers as most repelling, attracting or shearing material lines. These three kinematic concepts, however, can also be defined in different ways, both within rigorous mathematical treatments and within the realm of heuristic diagnostics. This has lead to a an ever-growing number of different LCS methods, each generally identifying different objects as transport barriers. In this talk, we examine which of these methods have actual relevance for diffusive transport barriers. The latter barriers are arguably the practically relevant inhibitors in the mixing of physically relevant tracers, such as temperature, salinity, vorticity or potential vorticity. We demonstrate the role of the most effective diffusion barriers in analytical examples and observational data.

Quasi-instantaneous jumps separating periods of localized vibrations around a mean position are found to characterize the hydrogen motion at the microscopic scale. The hydrogen motion is furthermore analyzed using the van Hove function. We highlight a non-Fickian behavior for the hydrogen diffusion due to a large spatial distribution of hydrogen jumps. We show that a generalized continuous time random walk (CTRW) model describes the experimental diffusion coefficients in a satisfactory manner. Finally, the impact of impurities and alloying elements on hydrogen diffusion in aluminum is discussed.\n\nUsing light transmission to watch hydrogen diffuse\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPÃ¡lsson, Gunnar K.; Bliersbach, Andreas; Wolff, Max; Zamani, Atieh; HjÃ¶rvarsson, BjÃ¶rgvin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBecause of its light weight and small size, hydrogen exhibits one of the fastest diffusion rates in solid materials, comparable to the diffusion rate of liquid water molecules at room temperature.

It was shown that ion transfer in placental (mimicking lipid-protein barriers) and muscle barriers occurs by different mechanisms. In placental barriers, the electromigration diffusion occurs along lipid-protein channels formed due to the conformational deformation of phospholipid and protein molecules with the coefficients of diffusion D = (2.6-3.6) x 10(-8) cm2/s. The transfer in muscle barriers is due to the migration across charged interfibrillar channels with the negative diffusion activation energy, which is explained by changes in the structure of muscle fibers and expenditures of thermal energy for the extrusion of Cl- from channel walls with the diffusion coefficient D = (6.0-10.0) x 10(-6) cm2/s.\n\nFermi level dependence of hydrogen diffusivity in GaN\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPolyakov, A.

It is shown that, at 350 Â°C, hydrogen diffusion is quite fast in heavily Mg doped p-type material with the Fermi level close to Ev+0.15 eV, considerably slower in high-resistivity p-GaN(Zn) with the Fermi level Ev+0.9 eV, while for conducting and semi-insulating n-GaN samples with the Fermi level in the upper half of the band gap no measurable hydrogen diffusion could be detected. For these latter samples it is shown that higher diffusion temperature of 500 Â°C and longer times (50 h) are necessary to incorporate hydrogen to appreciable depth. These findings are in line with previously published theoretical predictions of the dependence of hydrogen interstitials formation in GaN on the Fermi level position.\n\nAdsorption, dissociation and diffusion of hydrogen on the ZrCo surface and subsurface: A comprehensive study using first principles approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChattaraj, D.; Kumar, Nandha; Ghosh, Prasenjit; Majumder, C.; Dash, Smruti\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWith increasing demand for hydrogen economy driven world, the fundamental research of hydrogen-metal interactions has gained momentum. In this work we report a systematic theoretical study of the stability of different surfaces of intermetallic ZrCo that is a possible candidate as a getter bed for tritium. Our first principles ab initio thermodynamic calculations predict that amongst the (100), (110) and (111) surfaces, the stoichiometric (110) surface is the most stable one over a wide range of Co chemical potential. We have also studied adsorption, dissociation and diffusion of hydrogen on the (110) surface. On the basis of total energy, it is seen that adsorption of molecular hydrogen (H2) on the surface is much weaker than atomic hydrogen. The H2 decomposition on ZrCo surface can easily take place and the dissociation barrier is calculated to be 0.70 eV. The strength of binding of H atom on the surface is more or less independent of surface coverage till 1.0 ML of H. The thermodynamic stability of atomic H adsorbed on the surface, in subsurface and bulk decreases from surface to bulk to subsurface. Though the H atoms are mobile on the surface, their diffusion to the subsurface involves a barrier of about 0.79 eV.\n\nReview of Graphene as a Solid State Diffusion Barrier.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorrow, Wayne K; Pearton, Stephen J; Ren, Fan\n\n2016-01-06\n\nConventional thin-film diffusion barriers consist of 3D bulk films with high chemical and thermal stability. The purpose of the barrier material is to prevent intermixing or penetration from the two materials that encase it. Adhesion to both top and bottom materials is critical to the success of the barrier. Here, the effectiveness of a single atomic layer of graphene as a solid-state diffusion barrier for common metal schemes used in microelectronics is reviewed, and specific examples are discussed. Initial studies of electrical contacts to graphene show a distinct separation in behavior between metallic groups that strongly or weakly bond to it. The two basic classes of metal reactions with graphene are either physisorbed metals, which bond weakly with graphene, or chemisorbed metals, which bond strongly to graphene. For graphene diffusion barrier testing on Si substrates, an effective barrier can be achieved through the formation of a carbide layer with metals that are chemisorbed. For physisorbed metals, the barrier failure mechanism is loss of adhesion at the metalâgraphene interface. A graphene layer encased between two metal layers, in certain cases, can increase the binding energy of both films with graphene, however, certain combinations of metal films are detrimental to the bonding with graphene. While the prospects for graphene's future as a solid-state diffusion barrier are positive, there are open questions, and areas for future research are discussed. A better understanding of the mechanisms which influence graphene's ability to be an effective diffusion barrier in microelectronic applications is required, and additional experiments are needed on a broader range of metals, as well as common metal stack contact structures used in microelectronic applications. The role of defects in the graphene is also a key area, since they will probably influence the barrier properties. Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The nanopillar light-emitting diodes utilize an n-GaAs/i-InGaAs/p-GaAs axial heterostructure for current injection. Axial GaAsP segments are inserted into the n- and p-GaAs portions of the nanopillars surrounding the InGaAs emitter region, acting as diffusion barriers to provide enhanced carrier confinement. Detailed characterization of growth of the GaAsP inserts and electronic band-offset measurements are used to effectively implement the GaAsP inserts as diffusion barriers. The implementation of these barriers in nanopillar light-emitting diodes provides a 5-fold increase in output intensity, making this a promising approach to high-efficiency pillar-based emitters in the near-infrared wavelength range.\n\nThe hydrogen diffusion in liquid aluminum alloys from ab initio molecular dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJakse, N.; Pasturel, A.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWe study the hydrogen diffusion in liquid aluminum alloys through extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. At the microscopic scale, we show that the hydrogen motion is characterized by a broad distribution of spatial jumps that does not correspond to a Brownian motion. To determine the self-diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in liquid aluminum alloys, we use a generalized continuous time random walk model recently developed to describe the hydrogen diffusion in pure aluminum. In particular, we show that the model successfully accounts the effects of alloying elements on the hydrogen diffusion in agreement with experimental features.\n\nDiffusion Barriers to Increase the Oxidative Life of Overlay Coatings\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNesbitt, James A.; Lei, Jih-Fen\n\n1999-01-01\n\nCurrently, most blades and vanes in the hottest section of aero gas turbine engines require some type of coating for oxidation protection. Newly developed single crystal superalloys have the mechanical potential to operate at increasingly higher component temperatures. However, at these elevated temperatures, coating/substrate interdiffusion can shorten the protective life of the coating. Diffusion barriers between overlay coatings and substrates are being examined to extend the protective life of the coating. A previously- developed finite-difference diffusion model has been modified to predict the oxidative life enhancement due to use of a diffusion barrier. The original diffusion model, designated COSIM, simulates Al diffusion in the coating to the growing oxide scale as well as Al diffusion into the substrate. The COSIM model incorporates an oxide growth and spalling model to provide the rate of Al consumption during cyclic oxidation. Coating failure is predicted when the Al concentration at the coating surface drops to a defined critical level. The modified COSIM model predicts the oxidative life of an overlay coating when a diffusion barrier is present eliminating diffusion of Al from the coating into the substrate. Both the original and the modified diffusion models have been used to predict the effectiveness of a diffusion barrier in extending the protective life of a NiCrAl overlay coating undergoing cyclic oxidation at 1100 C.\n\nSubmersed sensing electrode used in fuel-cell type hydrogen detector\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNiedrach, L.

The experiments were performed in a multi-anvil press at 3 GPa, for a temperature range between 900 and 1200 Â°C and for various durations. The oxygen fugacity was buffered along Ni-NiO joint. Polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and recent empirical calibration were used to quantify the hydroxyl distributions in the samples along crystallographic axes after the experiments. The chemical diffusion coefficients are similar (barely slower) than in olivine hydrated at lower pressure (0.2 and 0.3 GPa) for the same diffusion mechanism. Under the given experimental conditions, the anisotropy of diffusion is the same as for proton-vacancy mechanism, with diffusion along the [0 0 1] axis faster than along the [1 0 0]. However, the anisotropy at 3 GPa is weaker compared to measurements at lower pressures and the analysis of concentration profiles using 3D models shows that an isotropic solution could also be relevant. Fits of the diffusion data to an Arrhenius law yield activation energies for the slightly faster [0 0 1] axis of the crystallographic axes around 198 Â± 5 kJ mol-1, a value only slightly lower than the results from previous experimental studies for natural iron-bearing olivine hydrogenated at lower confining pressure. At 3 GPa, hydrogenation can be well approximated by a single mechanism controlled by coupled diffusion of protons and octahedral vacancies (di- and tri-valent ions). The diffusion rates are fast enough to alter hydrogen concentration within olivine in xenoliths ascending from the mantle or experiencing hydrogen-rich metasomatism events, but too slow to permit complete homogenization of hydrogen in olivine-rich rocks at kilometer scale in less than one My.\n\nProbing Hydrogen Diffusion under High Pressure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBove, L. E.; Klotz, S.; Strassle, T.; Saitta, M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe study of the microscopic mechanism governing hydrogen and hydrogen-based liquids (as water, ammonia and methane) diffusion is crucial for a variety of scientific issues spanning most of natural sciences. As an example, characterizing hydrogen diffusion in a confined medium, like in porous systems or zeolites, is fundamental in problems relating to environment, hydrogen storage and industrial applications [1]. The presence of water diffusion in the minerals of the Earth's mantle have strong incidence on the processes governing volcanic eruptions and intermediate-depth seismicity. As last example, knowing in details the microscopic dynamics of hydrogen-based simple liquids under extreme conditions is essential in order to interpret observations and develop models of planet interiors [2]. On the other hand, water and other simple hydrogen-based liquids have always been key systems in the development of modern condensed-matter physics, because of their simple electronic structure and the peculiar properties deriving from the hydrogen-bond network. Their high compressibility and chemical reactivity have made these systems very challenging to study experimentally under static high P-T conditions. In the last few years, a large effort has been undertaken by several groups around the world [2] to extend the static and dynamic techniques to high temperatures and pressures, a program in which our group has been actively involved [3-6]. However, while the structure of water and other hydrogenated liquids of geological interest, is now known up to almost 20 GPa, the study of their transport properties greatly lags behind. We have recently developed a new large-volume gasket-anvil ensemble for the Paris-Edinburgh press based on a novel toroidal design [7], which allows to perform quasi elastic neutron scattering measurements on hydrogen based liquids up to one order of magnitude higher pressures (5 GPa) respect to what was achievable with standard methods [8].

In this process the ion exchange occurs between bulk glass (rod) and a molten salt. It was find that diffusion barrier exists on a border of glass surface and molten salt. The investigations of this barrier show that it value varies with ion exchange time and process temperature. It was find that in the case when thalium glass rod was treated in KNO3, bath, the minimum of the potential after 24 h was in temperature of 407Â°C, after 48 h in 422Â°C, after 72 h in 438Â°C and so on. So there are the possibility to keep the minimum of diffusion barrier by changing the temperature of the process and then the effectiveness of ion exchange process is the most effective. The time needed to obtain suitable refractive index distribution in a process when temperature was linearly changed from 400Â°C to 460Â°C was shorter of about 30% compare with the process in which temperature was constant and equal 450Â°C.\n\nAmorphous-Metal-Film Diffusion Barriers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNicolet, M.

The blood-brain barrier regulates the exchange of substances between the brain and the blood, but the diffusion properties of molecules at this blood-brain interface, particularly around the astrocyte endfeet, are poorly characterized. In this study, we used 2-photon microscopy and acute brain slices of mouse neocortex and directly assessed the diffusion patterns of fluorescent molecules. By observing the diffusion of unconjugated and 10-kDa dextran-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 from the ECS of the brain parenchyma to the blood vessels, we find various degrees of diffusion barriers at the endfeet: Some allow the invasion of dye inside the endfoot network while others completely block it. Detailed analyses of the time course for dye clearance support the existence of a tight endfoot network capable of acting as a diffusion barrier. Finally, we show that this diffusion pattern collapses under pathological conditions. These data demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of molecular diffusion dynamics around the endfeet and suggest that these structures can serve as the diffusion barrier. Therefore, astrocyte endfeet may add another layer of regulation to the exchange of molecules between blood vessels and brain parenchyma.\n\nHydrogen bonds and heat diffusion in Î±-helices: a computational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiÃ±o, German; Barriga, Raul; Gutierrez, Gonzalo\n\n2014-08-28\n\nRecent evidence has shown a correlation between the heat diffusion pathways and the known allosteric communication pathways in proteins. Allosteric communication in proteins is a central, yet unsolved, problem in biochemistry, and the study and characterization of the structural determinants that mediate energy transfer among different parts of proteins is of major importance. In this work, we characterized the role of hydrogen bonds in diffusivity of thermal energy for two sets of Î±-helices with different abilities to form hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds can be a constitutive part of the Î±-helices or can arise from the lateral chains. In our in vacuo simulations, it was observed that Î±-helices with a higher possibility of forming hydrogen bonds also had higher rates of thermalization. Our simulations also revealed that heat readily flowed through atoms involved in hydrogen bonds. As a general conclusion, according to our simulations, hydrogen bonds fulfilled an important role in heat diffusion in structural patters of proteins.\n\nUse of laser-induced spark for studying ignition stability and unburned hydrogen escaping from laminar diluted hydrogen diffusion jet flames\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPhuoc, Tran X.; Chen, Ruey-Hung\n\n2007-08-01\n\nIgnition and unburned hydrogen escaping from hydrogen jet diffusion flames diluted with nitrogen up to 70% were experimentally studied. The successful ignition locations were about 2/3 of the flame length above the jet exit for undiluted flames and moved much closer to the exit for diluted flames. For higher levels of dilution or higher flow rates, there existed a region within which a diluted hydrogen diffusion flame can be ignited and burns with a stable liftoff height. This is contrary to previous findings that pure and diluted hydrogen jet diffusion cannot achieve a stable lifted flame configuration. With liftoff, the flame is noisy and short with significant amount of unburned hydrogen escaping into the product gases. If ignition is initiated below this region, the flame propagates upstream quickly and attaches to the burner rim. Results from measurements of unburned hydrogen in the combustion products showed that the amount of unburned hydrogen increased as the nitrogen dilution level was increased. Thus, hydrogen diffusion flame diluted with nitrogen cannot burn completely.\n\nHydrogen-isotope permeation barrier\n\nDOEpatents\n\nMaroni, Victor A.; Van Deventer, Erven H.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA composite including a plurality of metal layers has a Cu-Al-Fe bronze layer and at least one outer layer of a heat and corrosion resistant metal alloy.

Ni barriers show the largest potential as at an AAT temperature of 250 Â°C both cells with 10 and 100 nm thick Ni barriers show significantly better performance compared to Au/Cu cells, with the cells with 10 nm Ni barriers even showing virtually no degradation after 7.5 days at 250 Â°C (equivalent to 10 years at 100 Â°C at an E a of 0.70 eV). Detailed investigation shows that Ni does not act as a barrier in the classical sense, i.e. preventing diffusion of Cu and Au across the barrier. Instead Ni modifies or slows down the interactions taking place during device degradation and thus effectively acts as an 'interaction' barrier. Different interactions occur at temperatures below and above 250 Â°C and for thin (10 nm) and thick (100 nm) barriers. The results of this study indicate that 10-100 nm thick Ni intermediate layers in the Cu/Au based metallization of III-V solar cells may be beneficial to improve the device stability upon exposure to elevated temperatures.\n\nDetermination of the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen ion in hydrogels.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuszter, GÃ¡bor; GehÃ©r-Herczegh, TÃ¼nde; SzÅ±cs, ÃrpÃ¡d; TÃ³th, Ãgota; HorvÃ¡th, DezsÅ\n\n2017-05-17\n\nThe role of diffusion in chemical pattern formation has been widely studied due to the great diversity of patterns emerging in reaction-diffusion systems, particularly in H + -autocatalytic reactions where hydrogels are applied to avoid convection. A custom-made conductometric cell is designed to measure the effective diffusion coefficient of a pair of strong electrolytes containing sodium ions or hydrogen ions with a common anion. This together with the individual diffusion coefficient for sodium ions, obtained from PFGSE-NMR spectroscopy, allows the determination of the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen ions in hydrogels. Numerical calculations are also performed to study the behavior of a diffusion-migration model describing ionic diffusion in our system. The method we present for one particular case may be extended for various hydrogels and diffusing ions (such as hydroxide) which are relevant e.g. for the development of pH-regulated self-healing mechanisms and hydrogels used for drug delivery.\n\nDiffusion of hydrogen in olivine: Implications for water in the mantle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMackwell, Stephen J.; Kohlstedt, David L.\n\n1990-04-01\n\nTo investigate the kinetics of diffusion of hydrogen in olivine, single crystals from San Carlos in Arizona have been annealed at temperatures between 800Â° and 1000Â°C under hydrothermal conditions at a confining pressure of 300 MPa. The hydrogen diffusivities were determined for the [100], [010], and [001] directions from concentration profiles for hydroxyl in the samples. These profiles were obtained from infrared spectra taken at 100-Î¼m intervals across a thin slice which was cut from the central portion of each annealed crystal. The rate of diffusion is anisotropic, with fastest transport along the [100] axis and slowest along the [010] axis. The fit of the data to an Arrhenius law for diffusion parallel to [100] yields an activation enthalpy of 130Â±30 kJ/mol with a preexponential term of (6Â±3)Ã10-5 m2 s-1. For diffusion parallel to [001], as there are insufficient data to calculate the activation enthalpy for diffusion, we used the same value as that for diffusion parallel to [100] and determined a preexponential term of (5Â±4)Ã10-6 m2 s-1. The diffusion rate parallel to [010] is about 1 order of magnitude slower than along [001]. The measured diffusivities are large enough that the hydrogen content of olivine grains which are millimeters in diameter will adjust to changing environmental conditions in time scales of hours at temperatures as low as 800Â°C. As xenoliths ascending from the mantle remain at high temperatures (i.e., >1000Â°C) but experience a rapid decrease in pressure, and hence hydrogen fugacity, olivine grains may dehydrate during ascent. By comparison, slow rates of carbon diffusion (Tingle et al., 1988) suggest that carbon will not be lost from olivine during ascent. Thus, low hydrogen contents within olivine and within fluid inclusions in olivine cannot be taken as support for low water contents in the mantle.\n\nVisualizing Molecular Diffusion through Passive Permeability Barriers in Cells: Conventional and Novel Approaches\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLin, Yu-Chun; Phua, Siew Cheng; Lin, Benjamin; Inoue, Takanari\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDiffusion barriers are universal solutions for cells to achieve distinct organizations, compositions, and activities within a limited space.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, they have been shown to sustain parental identity through asymmetric segregation of ageing factors during closed mitosis. Even though barriers have been extensively studied in the plasma membrane, their identity and organization within the nucleus remains poorly understood. Based on different lines of experimental evidence, we present a model of the composition and structural organization of a nuclear diffusion barrier during anaphase. By means of spatial stochastic simulations, we propose how specialised lipid domains, protein rings, and morphological changes of the nucleus may coordinate to restrict protein exchange between mother and daughter nuclear lobes. We explore distinct, plausible configurations of these diffusion barriers and offer testable predictions regarding their protein exclusion properties and the diffusion regimes they generate. Our model predicts that, while a specialised lipid domain and an immobile protein ring at the bud neck can compartmentalize the nucleus during early anaphase; a specialised lipid domain spanning the elongated bridge between lobes would be entirely sufficient during late anaphase. Our work shows how complex nuclear diffusion barriers in closed mitosis may arise from simple nanoscale biophysical interactions.

D.; Krasheninnikov, S. I.\n\nDesorption phase of thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments performed on tungsten samples exposed to flux of hydrogen isotopes in fusion relevant conditions is analyzed using a reaction-diffusion model describing hydrogen retention in material bulk. Two regimes of hydrogen desorption are identified depending on whether hydrogen trapping rate is faster than hydrogen diffusion rate in material during TDS experiments. In both regimes, a majority of hydrogen released from material defects is immediately outgassed instead of diffusing deeply in material bulk when the evolution of hydrogen concentration in material is quasi-static, which is the case during TDS experiments performed with tungsten samplesmoreÂ Â» exposed to flux of hydrogen isotopes in fusion related conditions. In this context, analytical expressions of the hydrogen outgassing flux as a function of the material temperature are obtained with sufficient accuracy to describe main features of thermal desorption spectra (TDSP). These expressions are then used to highlight how characteristic temperatures of TDSP depend on hydrogen retention parameters, such as trap concentration or activation energy of detrapping processes. The use of Arrhenius plots to characterize retention processes is then revisited when hydrogen trapping takes place during TDS experiments. Retention processes are also characterized using the shape of desorption peaks in TDSP, and it is shown that diffusion of hydrogen in material during TDS experiment can induce long desorption tails visible aside desorption peaks at high temperature in TDSP. These desorption tails can be used to estimate activation energy of diffusion of hydrogen in material.Â«Â less\n\nTechnique for determining the amount of hydrogen diffusing through a steel membrane\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKardash, N.V.; Batrakov, V.V.\n\n1995-07-01\n\nHydrogen diffusion through steel membranes still attracts much attention from scientists, and during recent years new results have been reported. Hydrogen diffusion is usually studied in the cell designed by M.A. Devanathan, but there are also other techniques for determining hydrogen permeability, namely: from the change in the solution volume in a horizontal or gas microburette; from the hydrogen ionization current; from the penetration current; and from the buckling of the cathode. The authors developed an analytical method using autocatalytic titration for determining the amount of hydrogen passed through a steel membrane. The method is based on permanganatometry which ismoreÂ Â» widely used in analytical chemistry.Â«Â less\n\nDiffusion of gas mixtures in the sI hydrate structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWaage, Magnus H.; Trinh, Thuat T.; van Erp, Titus S.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nReplacing methane with carbon dioxide in gas hydrates has been suggested as a way of harvesting methane, while at the same time storing carbon dioxide. Experimental evidence suggests that this process is facilitated if gas mixtures are used instead of pure carbon dioxide. We studied the free energy barriers for diffusion of methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen in the sI hydrate structure using molecular simulation techniques. Cage hops between neighboring cages were considered with and without a water vacancy and with a potential inclusion of an additional gas molecule in either the initial or final cage. Our results give little evidence for enhanced methane and carbon dioxide diffusion if nitrogen is present as well. However, the inclusion of hydrogen seems to have a substantial effect as it diffuses rapidly and can easily enter occupied cages, which reduces the barriers of diffusion for the gas molecules that co-occupy a cage with hydrogen.\n\nDiffusion and Stability of Hydrogen in Mg-Doped GaN: A Density Functional Study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPark, Ji-Sang; Chang, Kee Joo\n\n2012-06-01\n\nUsing hybrid functional calculations, we study the diffusion and thermal stability of hydrogen in Mg-doped GaN. Compared with the generalized gradient approximation, we obtain a higher activation barrier for dissociating a Mg-H complex, which is attributed to the increase in the binding energy of Mg-H. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations yield the annealing temperature of around 800 Â°C for activating Mg acceptors, close to the measured values. The results provide an insight to understanding the annealing effect such that the annealing temperature generally increases with the Mg-H concentration, and the retrapping of H is partly responsible for the low doping efficiencies at high Mg concentrations.\n\nFirst-principles study of transition-metal nitrides as diffusion barriers against Al\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMei, Zhi-Gang; Yacout, Abdellatif M.; Kim, Yeon Soo\n\n2016-04-01\n\nUsing density-functional theory based first-principles calculations we provided a comparative study of the diffusion barrier properties of TiN, ZrN, and HfN against Al for U-Mo dispersion fuel applications. We firstly examined the thermodynamic stability of these transition-metal nitrides with Al. The calculated heats of reaction show that both TiN and ZrN are thermodynamically unstable diffusion barrier materials, which might be decomposed by Al at relatively high temperatures. As a comparison, HfN is a stable diffusion barrier material for Al. To evaluate the kinetic stability of these nitride systems against Al diffusion, we investigated the diffusion mechanisms of Al in TiN,moreÂ Â» ZrN and HfN using atomic scale simulations. The effect of non-stoichiometry on the defect formation and Al migration was systematically studied. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

We investigate the adsorption and diffusion of H atoms on pure solid CO as an analog of dust surfaces observed toward some cold interstellar regions. Using a combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization methods to detect H atoms directly, the relative adsorption probabilities and diffusion coefficients of the H atoms are measured on pure solid CO at 8, 12, and 15 K. There is little difference between the diffusion coefficients of the hydrogen and deuterium atoms, indicating that the diffusion is limited by thermal hopping. The activation energies controlling the H-atom diffusion depend on the surface temperature, and values of 22, 30, and â¼37 meV were obtained for 8, 12, and 15 K, respectively.\n\nThe effect of tensile stress on hydrogen diffusion in metal alloys\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDanford, M. D.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe effect of tensile stress on hydrogen diffusion has been determined for Type 303 stainless steel, A286 CRES, and Waspaloy and IN100 nickel-base alloys. It was found that hydrogen diffusion coefficients are not significantly affected by stress, while the hydrogen permeabilities are greatly affected in Type 303 stainless steel and A286 CRES (iron-based alloys), but are affected little in Waspaloy (nickel-base) and not affected in all in IN100 (nickel base). These observations might be taken as an indication that hydrogen permeabilities are affected by stress in iron-based alloys, but only slightly affected in nickel-based alloys. However, it is too early to make such a generalization based on the study of only these four alloys.\n\nDiffusion Study on Dissolved Hydrogen toward Effective Bioremediation of Chlorinated Ethenes in Aquitards\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYoshikawa, M.; Zhang, M.; Takeuchi, M.; Komai, T.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nIn Japan, the demand for in-situ remediation of contaminated sediments is expected to increase in the future due to the recent amendment of Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act. The Japanese law requires remediating not only contaminated groundwater but also contaminated sediments including those in aquitards. In-situ remediation of contaminated aquitards has been a challenging issue and bioremediation is considered to be one of the effective techniques. In microbial degradation of chrolinated ethenes such as tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene under anaerobic environments, dissolved hydrogen plays an important role. The dechlorinating microbes utilize hydrogen and chlorinated ethenes as an electron donor and an electron accepter, respectively. The size of hydrogen molecule is extremely small and the diffusion rate of dissolved hydrogen in an aquitard would be the key factor that controls the process of microbial dechlorination. However, the diffusion behavior of dissolved hydrogen in subsurface sediments remains unclear. The purposes of this study are to develop a practically utilizable test apparatus, carry out a series of dissolved hydrogen diffusion tests on representative samples, and illustrate the applicability of bioremediation in aquitards. A completely leak-free apparatus was developed by using aluminum alloy and gas tight rubber. This apparatus is capable of testing specimens with a diameter as large as 100 mm by a length from 5 mm to 10 mm, depending on the maximum grain size within a test specimen. Preliminary tests have been performed with glass beads as an ideal material, commercially available kaolin clay, and core samples taken from a polluted site containing clay minerals. The effective diffusion coefficients of these samples were all on the order of 10E-10 m2/s, though their coefficients of permeability varied between the orders of 10E-2 and 10E-7 cm/s. These results showed that there was no obvious relationship between the effective\n\nKinetic Monte Carlo simulation on influence of vacancy on hydrogen diffusivity in tungsten\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOda, Takuji; Zhu, Deqiong; Watanabe, Yoshiyuki\n\n2015-12-01\n\nKinetic Mote Carlo (KMC) simulations are performed to quantify the influence of trap in hydrogen diffusivity in tungsten. As a typical trap, mono-vacancy is considered in the simulation. Experimental results reported by Frauenfelder are nicely reproduced when hydrogen concentration and trap concentration expected in the experiment are employed in the simulation. The effective diffusivity of hydrogen is evidently decreased by traps even at high temperatures like 1300 K. These results suggest that only high-temperature experimental data, which are not significantly affected by traps, should be fitted to, in order to derive the true hydrogen diffusivity from experiments. Therefore, we recommend D = 1.58 Ã10-7exp(- 0.25 eV / kT) m2 s-1 as the equation for hydrogen diffusion coefficient in tungsten, which was obtained by fitting only to experimental data at 1500-2400 K by Heinola and Ahlgren, rather than the most cited equation D = 4.1 Ã10-7exp(- 0.39 eV / kT) m2 s-1, which was obtained by fitting to all experimental data at 1100-2400 K including some data that should be affected by traps.\n\nA sphingolipid-dependent diffusion barrier confines ER stress to the yeast mother cell\n\nPubMed Central\n\nClay, Lori; Caudron, Fabrice; Denoth-Lippuner, Annina; Boettcher, Barbara; Buvelot Frei, StÃ©phanie; Snapp, Erik Lee; Barral, Yves\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn many cell types, lateral diffusion barriers compartmentalize the plasma membrane and, at least in budding yeast, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the molecular nature of these barriers, their mode of action and their cellular functions are unclear. Here, we show that misfolded proteins of the ER remain confined into the mother compartment of budding yeast cells. Confinement required the formation of a lateral diffusion barrier in the form of a distinct domain of the ER-membrane at the bud neck, in a septin-, Bud1 GTPase- and sphingolipid-dependent manner. The sphingolipids, but not Bud1, also contributed to barrier formation in the outer membrane of the dividing nucleus. Barrier-dependent confinement of ER stress into the mother cell promoted aging. Together, our data clarify the physical nature of lateral diffusion barriers in the ER and establish the role of such barriers in the asymmetric segregation of proteotoxic misfolded proteins during cell division and aging.

This investigation targeted a silicon oxide (SiOx) film that was deposited on a plastic substrate by a large-process-area web coater. Using the finite difference method based on diffusion theory, our estimation of the effective diffusion coefficient of a SiOx film corresponded to that of bulk glass that was previously reported. This result suggested that the low diffusivities of barrier films can be obtained on a mass-production level in the factory. In this investigation, experimental observations and mathematical confirmation revealed the limit of the water vapor transmission rate on the single barrier coating.\n\nQuantum fluctuations increase the self-diffusive motion of para-hydrogen in narrow carbon nanotubes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKowalczyk, Piotr; Gauden, Piotr A; Terzyk, Artur P; Furmaniak, Sylwester\n\n2011-05-28\n\nQuantum fluctuations significantly increase the self-diffusive motion of para-hydrogen adsorbed in narrow carbon nanotubes at 30 K comparing to its classical counterpart. Rigorous Feynman's path integral calculations reveal that self-diffusive motion of para-hydrogen in a narrow (6,6) carbon nanotube at 30 K and pore densities below â¼29 mmol cm(-3) is one order of magnitude faster than the classical counterpart. We find that the zero-point energy and tunneling significantly smoothed out the free energy landscape of para-hydrogen molecules adsorbed in a narrow (6,6) carbon nanotube. This promotes a delocalization of the confined para-hydrogen at 30 K (i.e., population of unclassical paths due to quantum effects). Contrary the self-diffusive motion of classical para-hydrogen molecules in a narrow (6,6) carbon nanotube at 30 K is very slow. This is because classical para-hydrogen molecules undergo highly correlated movement when their collision diameter approached the carbon nanotube size (i.e., anomalous diffusion in quasi-one dimensional pores). On the basis of current results we predict that narrow single-walled carbon nanotubes are promising nanoporous molecular sieves being able to separate para-hydrogen molecules from mixtures of classical particles at cryogenic temperatures.

M.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA computational simulation of the opposed-jet diffusion flame is performed to study its structure and extinction limits. The present analysis concentrates on the nitrogen-diluted hydrogen-air diffusion flame, which provides the basic information for many vehicle designs such as the aerospace plane for which hydrogen is a candidate as the fuel. The computer program uses the time-marching technique to solve the energy and species equations coupled with the momentum equation solved by the collocation method. The procedure is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, a one-step forward overal chemical reaction is chosen with the gas phase chemical reaction rate determined by comparison with experimental data. In the second stage, a complete chemical reaction mechanism is introduced with detailed thermodynamic and transport property calculations. Comparison between experimental extinction data and theoretical predictions is discussed. The effects of thermal diffusion as well as Lewis number and Prandtl number variations on the diffusion flame are also presented.\n\nAnisotropic hydrogen diffusion in Î±-Zr and Zircaloy predicted by accelerated kinetic Monte Carlo simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yongfeng; Jiang, Chao; Bai, Xianming\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis report presents an accelerated kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method to compute the diffusivity of hydrogen in hcp metals and alloys, considering both thermally activated hopping and quantum tunneling.

Contamination of the shielding has can occur due to poorly maintained gas distribution systems. Moisture entering as a gas contaminant is a source of hydrogen that can cause delayed cold cracking in welds. Limiting heat-affected zone hardness is one method of controlling cracking. Even this is based on some assumptions about the hydrogen levels in the weld. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of shielding gas moisture contamination and welding parameters on the diffusiblemoreÂ Â» hydrogen content of gas shielded flux cored arc welding. The total wire hydrogen of various electrodes was also tested and compared to the diffusible weld hydrogen. An empirical equation has been developed that estimates the diffusible hydrogen in weld metal for gas shielded flux cored arc welding. The equation is suitable for small diameter electrodes and welding parameter ranges commonly used for out-of-position welding. by combining this with the results from the total wire hydrogen tests, it is possible to estimate diffusible hydrogen directly from measured welding parameters, shielding gas dew point, and total hydrogen of the consumable. These equations are also useful for evaluating the effect of welding procedure variations from known baseline conditions.Â«Â less\n\nGeneral Protein Diffusion Barriers create Compartments within Bacterial Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchlimpert, Susan; Klein, Eric A.; Briegel, Ariane; Hughes, Velocity; Kahnt, JÃ¶rg; Bolte, Kathrin; Maier, Uwe G.; Brun, Yves V.; Jensen, Grant J.; Gitai, Zemer; Thanbichler, Martin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSUMMARY In eukaryotes, the differentiation of cellular extensions such as cilia or neuronal axons depends on the partitioning of proteins to distinct plasma membrane domains by specialized diffusion barriers. However, examples of this compartmentalization strategy are still missing for prokaryotes, although complex cellular architectures are widespread among this group of organisms. This study reveals the existence of a protein-mediated membrane diffusion barrier in the stalked bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. We show that the Caulobacter cell envelope is compartmentalized by macromolecular complexes that prevent the exchange of both membrane and soluble proteins between the polar stalk extension and the cell body. The barrier structures span the cross-sectional area of the stalk and comprise at least four proteins that assemble in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Their presence is critical for cellular fitness, as they minimize the effective cell volume, allowing faster adaptation to environmental changes that require de novo synthesis of envelope proteins.

They represent a solution to the problem of the complete Fermi-Dirac description which is physically appropriate for these systems. Hydrogen diffusion which proceeds via lattice assisted quantum tunneling at room and lower temperatures requires a new and different description from the one based on the thermal hopping picture, which pertains only to relatively high temperatures. It is also shown that the analogs of the solution to the Fermi-Dirac problem of hydrogen can be successfully applied to the description of vacancies in a hydrogenated system, a phenomena known to occur due to high hydrogen-vacancy binding energies and the creation of hydrogen-vacancy clusters. The solution based on this model applies to much lower temperatures and higher concentrations than the tradition alone. This methodology has also been applied to the surface problem where very large vacancy and hydrogen concentrations occur. This is of special importance since mechanical properties are known to be greatly affected by the surface. As another consequence of hydrogen induced vacancies, hydrogen induced lattice migration (HILM) occurs. This has been demonstrated in our electrical resistivity study of palladium wires where recrystallization and annealing effects were observed upon hydrogen-heat-treatment (HHT).\n\nHydrogen consentration meter utilizing a diffusion tube composed of 2 1/4 C r\n\nDOEpatents\n\nRoy, Prodyot; Sandusky, David W.; Hartle, Robert T.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nA diffusion tube hydrogen meter for improving the sensitivity and response time for the measurement of hydrogen in liquid sodium. The improved hydrogen meter has a composite membrane composed of pure nickel sleeve fitted, for example, over a 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel or niobium diffusion tube. Since the hydrogen permeation rate through 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steels is a factor of four higher than pure nickel, and the permeation rate of hydrogen through niobium is two orders of magnitude greater than the 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel, this results in a decrease in response time and an increase in the sensitivity.\n\nApplication of CFRP with High Hydrogen Gas Barrier Characteristics to Fuel Tanks of Space Transportation System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYonemoto, Koichi; Yamamoto, Yuta; Okuyama, Keiichi; Ebina, Takeo\n\nIn the future, carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) with high hydrogen gas barrier performance will find wide applications in all industrial hydrogen tanks that aim at weight reduction; the use of such materials will be preferred to the use of conventional metallic materials such as stainless steel or aluminum. The hydrogen gas barrier performance of CFRP will become an important issue with the introduction of hydrogen-fuel aircraft. It will also play an important role in realizing fully reusable space transportation system that will have high specific tensile CFRP structures. Such materials are also required for the manufacture of high-pressure hydrogen gas vessels for use in the fuel cell systems of automobiles. This paper introduces a new composite concept that can be used to realize CFRPs with high hydrogen gas barrier performance for applications in the cryogenic tanks of fully reusable space transportation system by the incorporation of a nonmetallic crystal layer, which is actually a dense and highly oriented clay crystal laminate. The preliminary test results show that the hydrogen gas barrier characteristics of this material after cryogenic heat shocks and cyclic loads are still better than those of other polymer materials by approximately two orders of magnitude.\n\nMigration mechanisms and diffusion barriers of vacancies in Ga2O3\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKyrtsos, Alexandros; Matsubara, Masahiko; Bellotti, Enrico\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe employ the nudged elastic band and the dimer methods within the standard density functional theory (DFT) formalism to study the migration of the oxygen and gallium vacancies in the monoclinic structure of Î² -Ga2O3 . We identify all the first nearest neighbor paths and calculate the migration barriers for the diffusion of the oxygen and gallium vacancies. We also identify the metastable sites of the gallium vacancies which are critical for the diffusion of the gallium atoms. The migration barriers for the diffusion of the gallium vacancies are lower than the migration barriers for oxygen vacancies by 1 eV on average, suggesting that the gallium vacancies are mobile at lower temperatures. Using the calculated migration barriers we estimate the annealing temperature of these defects within the harmonic transition state theory formalism, finding excellent agreement with the observed experimental annealing temperatures. Finally, we suggest the existence of percolation paths which enable the migration of the species without utilizing all the migration paths of the crystal.\n\nSymmetry and diffusivity of the interstitial hydrogen shallow-donor center in In 2O 3\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nWeiser, Philip; Qin, Ying; Yin, Weikai; ...\n\n2016-11-16\n\nUniaxial stress experiments performed for the 3306 cm -1 vibrational line assigned to the interstitial-hydrogen, shallow-donor center in In 2O 3 reveal its symmetry and transition- moment direction. The defect alignment that can be produced by a [001] stress applied at 165 K is due to a process that is also a hydrogen- diffusion jump, providing a microscopic determination of the diffusion constant for H in In 2O 3 and its mechanism. Lastly, our experimental results strongly complement theoretical predictions for the structure and diffusion of the interstitial hydrogen donor center in In 2O 3.\n\nEnhancement of tunneling magnetoresistance by inserting a diffusion barrier in L10-FePd perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, De-Lin; Schliep, Karl B.; Wu, Ryan J.; Quarterman, P.; Reifsnyder Hickey, Danielle; Lv, Yang; Chao, Xiaohui; Li, Hongshi; Chen, Jun-Yang; Zhao, Zhengyang; Jamali, Mahdi; Mkhoyan, K. Andre; Wang, Jian-Ping\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe studied the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of L10-FePd perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (p-MTJs) with an FePd free layer and an inserted diffusion barrier. The diffusion barriers studied here (Ta and W) were shown to enhance the TMR ratio of the p-MTJs formed using high-temperature annealing, which are necessary for the formation of high quality L10-FePd films and MgO barriers. The L10-FePd p-MTJ stack was developed with an FePd free layer with a stack of FePd/X/Co20Fe60B20, where X is the diffusion barrier, and patterned into micron-sized MTJ pillars. The addition of the diffusion barrier was found to greatly enhance the magneto-transport behavior of the L10-FePd p-MTJ pillars such that those without a diffusion barrier exhibited negligible TMR ratios (<1.0%), whereas those with a Ta (W) diffusion barrier exhibited TMR ratios of 8.0% (7.0%) at room temperature and 35.0% (46.0%) at 10 K after post-annealing at 350 Â°C. These results indicate that diffusion barriers could play a crucial role in realizing high TMR ratios in bulk p-MTJs such as those based on FePd and Mn-based perpendicular magnetic anisotropy materials for spintronic applications.\n\nTunnel barrier design in donor nanostructures defined by hydrogen-resist lithography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPascher, Nikola; Hennel, Szymon; Mueller, Susanne; Fuhrer, Andreas\n\n2016-08-01\n\nA four-terminal donor quantum dot (QD) is used to characterize potential barriers between degenerately doped nanoscale contacts. The QD is fabricated by hydrogen-resist lithography on Si(001) in combination with n-type doping by phosphine. The four contacts have different separations (d = 9, 12, 16 and 29 nm) to the central 6 nm Ã 6 nm QD island, leading to different tunnel and capacitive coupling. Cryogenic transport measurements in the Coulomb-blockade (CB) regime are used to characterize these tunnel barriers. We find that field enhancement near the apex of narrow dopant leads is an important effect that influences both barrier breakdown and the magnitude of the tunnel current in the CB transport regime. From CB-spectroscopy measurements, we extract the mutual capacitances between the QD and the four contacts, which scale inversely with the contact separation d. The capacitances are in excellent agreement with numerical values calculated from the pattern geometry in the hydrogen resist. Furthermore, we show that by engineering the source-drain tunnel barriers to be asymmetric, we obtain a much simpler excited-state spectrum of the QD, which can be directly linked to the orbital single-particle spectrum.\n\nHow thin barrier metal can be used to prevent Co diffusion in the modern integrated circuits?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDixit, Hemant; Konar, Aniruddha; Pandey, Rajan; Ethirajan, Tamilmani\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn modern integrated circuits (ICs), billions of transistors are connected to each other via thin metal layers ("
