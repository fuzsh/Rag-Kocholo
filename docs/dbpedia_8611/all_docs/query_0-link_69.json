        "text": "This book, by one of the foremost authorities on the subject, explores the complex nature of Russian nationalism. It examines nationalism as a multi-layered and multifaceted repertoire displayed by a myriad of actors. It considers nationalism as various concepts and ideas emphasizing Russia's distinctive national character, based on the country's geography, history, Orthodoxy, and Soviet technological advances. It analyzes the ideologies of Russia's ultra-nationalist and far-right groups, explores the use of nationalism in the conflict with Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, and discusses how Putin's political opponents, including Alexei Navalny, make use of nationalism. Overall the book provides a rich analysis of a key force which is profoundly affecting political and societal developments both inside Russia and beyond.\n\nTo what extent do elite narratives about history shape what citizens make of the past? This article focuses on young Russians' understanding of history and provides insights into the effects of memory politics in authoritarian settings. The research uses original survey data of urban youth and demonstrates that the regime successfully determines what events are considered important. However, conflicts over their interpretation persist, particularly with regard to less emotionally charged signifiers and those to which respondents can relate personally. Given low variation by age, I suggest that we observe a period effect upon historical memory, rather than a generational effect."
