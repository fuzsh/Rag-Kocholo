INTRODUCTION TO THE REPLY\n\n1. Pursuant to the Court’s Orders of 8 October 2021 and 8 April 2022, Ukraine files this Reply.\n\n2. As Ukraine stated in its Memorial, this case concerns a brazen and comprehensive assault on human rights and international law in the territory of Ukraine. In the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, the Russian Federation invaded and occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory in 2014, launching and maintaining a regime of racial discrimination and cultural erasure targeting the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities under its control. In eastern Ukraine, illegal armed groups launched what U.N. human rights monitors called “a campaign of intimidation and terror” against the civilian population, which Russian officials and other persons under Russian jurisdiction supported with weapons and money, as Russia’s government refused to take cooperative measures to prevent and punish such financing of terrorist acts.\n\n3. Tragically, as Ukraine submits this Reply, the world is witnessing that Russia’s behavior at issue in this case, revealing Russia’s contempt for both international law and the Ukrainian people, was only a prelude. On 21 February 2022, Russia purported to recognize as independent the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic” — the very illegal armed groups responsible for committing the terrorist acts documented in Ukraine’s Memorial. Then, on 24 February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian military has used illegal means to carry out its illegal mission, making entire populations in Ukraine’s cities and towns the object of attack, and raining rockets and shells down on peaceful civilian areas — similar to the shellings of civilians documented in Ukraine’s Memorial in this case, but multiplied exponentially, massively expanded geographically, and carried out by the Russian Armed Forces. In newly occupied territory, Russia is employing repressive techniques familiar from its campaign of racial discrimination in Crimea.\n\n2\n\n4. Russia’s latest aggression against Ukraine is the subject of a different case pending before the Court, in which the Court has indicated provisional measures.1 At the same time, as this Court considers Russia’s past violations of the ICSFT and the CERD, it is impossible to simply ignore Russia’s current actions.\n\n5. In the first instance, the Court should assess prior Russian support for attacks on Ukrainian civilians in eastern Ukraine, and Russia’s active program of cultural erasure in Crimea, in light of the tragic attacks on civilians by the Russian Federation and the denial of Ukrainian identity and statehood that have been ongoing since 24 February 2022. Russia’s recent conduct underscores the bad faith that permeates Russia’s Counter-Memorial, in effect asserting that white is black, and night is day. Russia’s Counter-Memorial presents a fictional world in which all ethnic groups in occupied Crimea are treated fairly and equally. Similarly, Russia’s Counter-Memorial mounts a defense of the DPR’s and LPR’s attacks against civilians, and then seeks to draw a false equivalence between the illegal armed groups inflicting a reign of terror on the population and the Ukrainian armed forces seeking to stop them and restore constitutional order. Now Russia is directly deploying cluster munitions and other powerful weapons against Ukraine’s cities — even targeting a theater in Mariupol that was serving as a shelter, with the word “CHILDREN” spelled out and visible from satellite imagery.2 Viewed in light of these recent actions, Russia’s Counter-Memorial can only be understood as a series of deflections and distractions crafted by lawyers, not the position of a State genuinely committed to fulfilling its obligations under the ICSFT and the CERD.\n\n6. Second, while Russia’s past violations of international law and human rights can appear dwarfed by the magnitude of Russia’s current assault on Ukraine, the violations of the ICSFT and the CERD at issue in this case remain extraordinary and important. The world\n\n1 See Allegations of Genocide Under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation), Provisional Measures, Order of 16 March 2022.\n\n2 OSCE, Report on Violations of International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Committed in Ukraine Since 24 February 2022 (13 April 2022), pp. 47–48; Human Rights Watch, Ukraine: Mariupol Theater Hit by Russian Attack Sheltered Hundreds (16 March 2022).\n\n3\n\nhas now seen that if Russia is not held accountable for its violations of international law, Russia will escalate its violations. After years of imposing a campaign of racial discrimination and cultural erasure in Crimea, Russia now threatens to deploy the same tactics across the entirety of Ukraine, as Russia’s president chillingly denies the existence of a separate Ukrainian people and its historical right to a State of its own. After years of Russian officials providing deadly military weaponry for use against civil aviation, residential neighborhoods, and peaceful unity rallies, the Russian military is now directly turning those same weapons systems and more against the Ukrainian people.\n\n7. As Ukraine completes this Reply, Russia is seeking to expand its occupation of Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian population is now at risk of the same regime of discrimination faced by the Ukrainian population in occupied Crimea. And to achieve this expanded territorial occupation, Russia is deploying the same tactics of intimidation and coercion that the DPR and LPR used in eastern Ukraine beginning in 2014. The symmetry between past and present is both tragic and unmistakable. In 2015, a bus full of pensioners at a civilian checkpoint near Volnovakha was shelled; today, a hospital in Volnovakha has been bombed and the town “has been almost completely destroyed” by shelling.3 In 2015, a residential neighborhood of Mariupol was intentionally targeted; today, the entire city of Mariupol is being targeted, including direct attacks on civilians that have killed thousands, including many children.4 In 2015, a sophisticated multiple launch rocket system was fired\n\n3 OSCE, Report on Violations of International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Committed in Ukraine Since 24 February 2022 (13 April 2022), p. 82; euronews, Heavy Fighting Leaves Much of Volnovakha in Ruins (13 March 2022); Reuters, Inside the Almost Completely Destroyed Town of Volnovakha (12 March 2022).\n\n4 See OSCE, Report on Violations of International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Committed in Ukraine Since 24 February 2022 (13 April 2022), pp. 32, 46–48; U.N. News, UN Alarm Over Mounting Ukraine Casualties, Amid Desperate Scenes in\n\n4\n\ninto the center of Kramatorsk; today, a missile strike targeted a train station in Kramatorsk where civilians were gathering to evacuate, killing more than fifty civilians.5\n\n8. Third, in violation of the Court’s Order of 19 April 2017, Russia has taken “action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve.”6 Part IV below addresses in more detail Russia’s violations of the Court’s Order, but it is worth noting here that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also makes this dispute more difficult to resolve in the most literal way possible. By forcing Ukraine to defend itself from a war of aggression, by forcing it to turn government resources to the most basic needs of its people, by forcing witnesses in this case to dedicate their attention to the national defense, and by forcing others in Ukraine who have been assisting with this case to prioritize their own personal safety, Russia has made it more difficult for the Government of Ukraine to complete this Reply and assist this Court with resolution of the dispute on the merits. Russia also has gone so far as to suggest in negotiations with Ukraine to end Russia’s unlawful aggression that Ukraine drop its legal actions as part of a price for peace.7\n\n9. Despite the aggression it is facing, Ukraine’s belief in international law compels it to move forward in this case and demand accountability and responsibility for Russia’s breaches of the ICSFT and the CERD. At the same time, this Reply will on limited occasions\n\nMariupol (25 March 2022); Human Rights Watch, Ukraine Theater Hit by Russian Attack Sheltered Hundreds (16 March 2022).\n\n5 See U.N. News, Ukraine: UN Condemns Deadly Attack on Train Station, Dozens of Civilians Killed (8 April 2022); Jonathan Beale, Ukraine War: Disbelief and Horror after Kramatorsk Train Station Attack, BBC (10 April 2022).\n\n6 Application of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian Federation), Provisional Measures, Order of 19 April 2017, I.C.J. Reports 2017, p. 140, para. 106.\n\n7 StoryUkraine, Arahamiya in an Interview with RBC-Ukraine on Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and Security Guarantees (30 March 2022), https://news.storyua.com/news/3360.html.\n\n5\n\nrefer to information available to Ukraine but for which production of documents or a formal\n\nwitness statement has been rendered temporarily impossible by Russia’s invasion. The Court\n\nhas long recognized that “a State that is not in a position to provide direct proof of certain facts\n\n‘should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.’”8\n\nThis principle must apply with particular force when the reason certain evidence is unavailable\n\nis that a respondent State has launched an unprovoked invasion of an applicant State while\n\nthe two States have an important dispute pending before the Court. While the present record\n\nmore than supports Ukraine’s claims, Ukraine reserves the right to seek the Court’s\n\nauthorization, pursuant to Article 56(2) of the Rules of the Court, to submit additional\n\ndocumentary evidence when it is able to do so, which under the present circumstances would\n\nbe manifestly justified.\n\n10. In significant respects, Russia’s Counter-Memorial does not and cannot dispute\n\nthe most critical facts. Russia does not dispute, for example, the massive supply of arms and\n\nmoney to illegal armed groups in Ukraine who notoriously committed attacks against civilians,\n\nand Russia’s complete refusal to police its border or take other cooperative, practicable\n\nmeasures to prevent the financing of terrorist acts in Ukraine. Nor does Russia dispute that it\n\nhas repeatedly restricted the right of the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities to\n\ncommemorate events of cultural significance to them, or that it has prioritized the educational\n\nneeds of Crimea’s ethnic Russian community over those of the Crimean Tatars and\n\nUkrainians. Unable to dispute these and other facts, Russia attempts to bend the law in its\n\nfavor — denying the most natural interpretations of its obligations in favor of convoluted\n\nreadings and artificial evidentiary burdens, all for the sake of avoiding responsibility for\n\nindefensible conduct. The Counter-Memorial reveals a strategy focused on creating an escape\n\n8 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda),\n\nReparations, Judgment of 9 February 2022, p. 40, para. 125 (quoting Corfu Channel (United\n\nKingdom v. Albania), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 18).\n\n6\n\nroute for a non-compliant state, rather than one based on good faith interpretation and performance of international obligations.\n\n11. The first component of Russia’s escape route is to nullify its obligations by treating words as if they lack meaning. Thus, when the ICSFT defines the term “funds” to include “assets of every kind,” Russia defines funds to mean only “financial assets” but not “non-financial assets”9 — that is, not assets of every kind. When the ICSFT requires States to take “all practicable measures” to prevent and counter preparations for terrorism financing offenses, Russia insists that its sole obligation is to take only regulatory measures — only “certain” practicable measures, not all practicable measures as the treaty says. To accept these tortured interpretations would free Russia of any obligation to take measures to prevent the supply of deadly weapons from its territory to known perpetrators of terrorist violence. Similarly, Russia ignores the CERD’s absolute prohibition on racial discrimination, claiming that it is subject to exceptions based on Russia’s subjective assessment of its national security needs, including those purportedly embodied in its discredited anti-extremism laws.\n\n12. The second component of Russia’s escape route is to layer unfounded evidentiary requirements on top of one another, such that if Russia’s obfuscations can create the smallest uncertainty, Ukraine’s case would fail. For example, under the ICSFT Russia maintains that Ukraine should not be permitted to draw reasonable inferences as to the purpose of attacks on civilians — even though the ICSFT states that the purpose of a third party’s act to intimidate or compel is to be determined by its “nature or context.” Under the CERD, which defines “racial discrimination” to include actions which have “the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life,” Russia insists that “effect” is not enough and that Ukraine must prove “purpose.” And across the entirety of the case, Russia ignores the fact that the financiers of\n\n9 See Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, paras. 37, 73, 101.\n\n7\n\nterrorism and the perpetrators of racial discrimination are located in territory controlled by Russia, and that as a consequence, Ukraine must under this Court’s jurisprudence be “allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.”10\n\n13. The third component of Russia’s escape route is to ignore inconvenient facts and invent its own facts with the thinnest veneer of support. Under the ICSFT, for example, Russia baldly asserts that well-documented assassinations of civilians based on nothing more than their pro-Ukrainian views are merely “ordinary crimes.”11 It seeks to bury the phenomenon of a bombing campaign across Ukraine’s peaceful cities, not even engaging with the evidence that the sophisticated military-grade explosives used in those bombings came from Russia. And where the Under-Secretary General of the United Nations determined that the bombardment of a residential neighborhood in Mariupol “knowingly targeted a civilian population,” Russia puts forward the opinion of a Russian Major General who is willing to do no more than speculate that the carnage might theoretically have other explanations. Under the CERD, Russia responds to Ukraine’s well-documented allegations that the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities have been targeted for arbitrary police action that negates or impairs their human rights with conclusory statements by members of the Russian law enforcement apparatus asserting that everything was done in accordance with Russian law.\n\n14. This Reply will answer Russia’s strategy to evade accountability: Ukraine demonstrates why Russia’s legal interpretations are wrong, its proposed evidentiary burdens unfounded, and its approach to the facts is not credible. Under good faith interpretations of the ICSFT and the CERD and the facts before this Court, there is but one conclusion to reach: Russia has engaged in brazen violations of these treaties and, in the process, shown fundamental disregard for the human rights of the people of Ukraine.\n\n10 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Reparations, Judgment of 9 February 2022, p. 40, para. 125 (quoting Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 18).\n\n11 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 515.\n\n8\n\nChapter 2. STRUCTURE AND SUMMARY OF UKRAINE’S REPLY\n\n15. Ukraine’s Memorial presented its claims that Russia has violated numerous obligations under the ICSFT and the CERD. On 8 November 2019, the Court issued a judgment finding that “it has jurisdiction on the basis of Article 24, paragraph 1, of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, to entertain the claims made by Ukraine under this Convention,” and that “it has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article 22 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to entertain the claims made by Ukraine under this Convention, and that the Application in relation to those claims is admissible.” On 9 August 2021, the Russian Federation filed a Counter-Memorial in two parts.12\n\n16. Part II of the Reply addresses Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT, Section A of which discusses the interpretation of the Convention. Chapter 3 responds to Russia’s flawed framework for assessing its obligations. It summarizes the framework under which Russia was obligated to cooperate with Ukraine in the prevention and suppression of terrorism financing, outlines Russia’s systematic rejection of its obligations, explains the common flaws that run throughout Russia’s interpretation of the ICSFT, and addresses Russia’s attempt to artificially heighten the evidentiary standard for establishing a breach of its obligations.\n\n17. Chapter 4 addresses the proper interpretation of Article 2(1) of the ICSFT. It responds to Russia’s arbitrary attempt to narrow Article 1’s definition of “funds,” arguing that weapons and other non-financial assets are excluded from the Convention’s broad definition\n\n12 Prefaces to both Parts of the Counter-Memorial state that “Russia submits two Counter-Memorials.” In a letter to the Parties, the Registrar noted that the Court “regrets that the Russian Federation used wording in the prefaces to the two volumes of its Counter-Memorial which referred to the submission of ‘two Counter-Memorials,’” as “Article 45, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court only envisages the presentation of one Memorial by the applicant and one Counter-Memorial by the respondent in a given case.” Letter from Philippe Gautier, Registrar, International Court of Justice, to Yevhenii Yenin, Agent of Ukraine before the International Court of Justice, dated 24 September 2021. The Court instructed that in future pleadings, “reference should be made to the Counter-Memorial Part I and the Counter-Memorial Part II.” Ibid. Russia has not designated which parts of its Counter-Memorial it considers Part I and Part II, so for purposes of consistency with the presentation in Ukraine’s Memorial, Ukraine will refer to the volume of the Counter-Memorial addressing the ICSFT as “Counter-Memorial Part I,” and the volume of the Counter-Memorial addressing the CERD as “Counter-Memorial Part II.”\n\n9\n\nof “funds” to include “assets of every kind.” Chapter 4 then addresses the mental state requirement of Article 2(1), explaining the parties’ common ground that where a funder provides assets to a person or group that has notoriously committed terrorist acts, the funder acts with the required knowledge. The chapter then refutes Russia’s argument, unmoored from the text of the treaty, that such notoriety requires a formal international designation or similar characterization, and cannot be established by notoriety of the group’s acts themselves.\n\n18. Chapter 5 responds to Russia’s interpretation of the terrorist acts which may not be funded. It first addresses the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, explaining that intention to destroy a civil aircraft is not an element of an offense, and that even if it were, such intention is present where a person fires a weapon incapable of distinguishing military and civilian targets into skies open to civil aviation. Chapter 5 further responds to Russia’s misreading of Article 2(1)(b) ICSFT, which refers not to the mental state of a third party but to the objective nature of an act, and directs that an act’s purpose to intimidate or compel must be evaluated based on its nature or context.\n\n19. Section B of Part II responds to Russia’s arguments that Ukraine has not established acts of terrorism financing under Article 2 of the ICSFT. Chapter 6 addresses the evidence that illegal armed groups in Ukraine committed numerous acts covered by Article 2(1)(a) and 2(1)(b) of the ICSFT through the targeted killings of Ukrainian civilians, the shoot-down of Flight MH17, shelling attacks on civilian areas, and bombing attacks in Ukrainian cities. It shows that for many of these acts, the critical evidence showing they are covered by Article 2(1)(b) is undisputed, and with respect to the DPR’s shelling of civilian areas, Russia’s attempts to excuse and justify these attacks fail. Chapter 7 demonstrates that it is also undisputed that persons in Russian territory provided money, weapons, and other equipment to the illegal armed groups that carried out the covered terrorist acts, and responds to Russia’s attempt to minimize or ignore the evidence that Russian officials supplied the bombs used in a wave of terrorist bombings across Ukraine. Applying the proper interpretation of Article 2(1), Chapter 7 then illustrates how the many persons in Russian territory who provided funds\n\n10\n\ndid so with the requisite knowledge of how they were to be used. 20. Section C, Chapter 8 concludes Part II by responding to Russia’s attempt to deprive its obligations under the ICSFT of practical effect, and demonstrating Russia’s breaches of its obligations under Articles 18, 8, 9, 10, and 12.\n\n21. Part III of this Reply addresses Ukraine’s claims under the CERD. Section A discusses Russia’s attempt to mischaracterize Ukraine’s case and misconstrue the applicable law in order to avoid responsibility for its racially discriminatory conduct. Chapter 9 sets out the proper legal framework governing Ukraine’s claims, and explains why Russia’s efforts to excuse its behavior, including on the basis of purported national security concerns, cannot provide a legal basis for Russia to avoid its CERD obligations. The chapter also responds to Russia’s misguided attempt to distort both the nature of Ukraine’s claims of discrimination, and the showing that Ukraine must make in order to establish a violation of the CERD.\n\n22. Section B examines Ukraine’s claims that Russia has violated numerous provisions of the CERD. Chapters 10 – 13 respond to Russia’s arguments that it has not engaged in a policy of discrimination in political and civil affairs against the ethnic Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar communities. Chapter 10 explains that Russia has violated Articles 2(1), 5(b), and 6 of the CERD, by directly engaging in, or encouraging and tolerating, acts of physical violence targeting Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians, and by systematically failing to investigate such acts. The chapter shows that data from diverse, credible sources consistently confirm that the Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians are disproportionately affected by such enforced acts of violence. It explains that, contrary to Russia’s claim that it has made all available investigative efforts, Russia’s own evidence confirms that any alleged investigative efforts were a mere formality. The chapter concludes by explaining that Russia is responsible for all illustrative cases set forth in Ukraine’s Memorial.\n\n23. Chapter 11 demonstrates that Russia’s campaign of harassment against the Mejlis, and its ongoing ban on that institution, burdens numerous human rights of the Crimean Tatar community, including those protected under Articles 2(1), 4, and 5(a) of the\n\n11\n\nCERD. The chapter responds to Russia’s attempts to mischaracterize the Mejlis as but one of numerous organizations representative of the Crimean Tatar people, and explains that Russia’s national security justification for its ban on the Mejlis has no legal or factual basis. The chapter concludes by addressing Russia’s criticism of Ukraine’s claims of political suppression as entirely unfounded. In fact, as the chapter shows, Russia’s own account plainly confirms each and every occasion of individual harassment against members of the Mejlis. 24. Chapter 12 establishes that Russia has targeted the Crimean Tatar community, in breach of Articles 2(1), 4, 5(a), and 6 of the CERD, by subjecting it to a pattern of arbitrary searches and detentions. The chapter shows that the specific examples in Ukraine’s Memorial demonstrate an ongoing pattern of arbitrary law enforcement measures which disproportionately affect the Crimean Tatar population. The chapter establishes that Russia’s claim of compliance with its domestic laws, including the anti-extremism laws, does not excuse its CERD violations, and concludes by addressing Russia’s factual criticisms of Ukraine’s case, which are belied by Russia’s own evidence.\n\n25. Chapter 13 describes how the imposition of Russian citizenship and its residency and immigration framework laid a legal foundation for Russia’s systematic campaign of racial discrimination against the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities, violating Articles 5(c), 5(d)(i), 5(d)(ii), 5(d)(iii), 5(e)(i), and 5(e)(iv) of the CERD. The chapter addresses Russia’s attempt to characterize the discriminatory effects of these actions as citizenship-based restrictions excluded from the scope of the CERD by virtue of Articles 1(1), 1(2), and 1(3). The chapter demonstrates that Russia’s automatic citizenship regime essentially coerced a choice, where either option would unlawfully restrict the human rights of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians, albeit in different ways.\n\n26. Chapters 14 – 17 rebut Russia’s denials that it engaged in cultural discrimination and suppression by showing the devastating effect Russia’s policies have had on the ethnic Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar communities. Chapter 14 shows that regardless of Russia’s legal defense of its legislative and regulatory framework on gatherings, it has been\n\n12\n\napplied in a discriminatory manner to the Crimean Tatar and ethnic Ukrainian communities in contravention of Articles 2(1), 5(d)(ix), and 5(e)(vi) of the CERD. It also provides sorely needed context to Russia’s narrative regarding its rejection of applications for Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar gatherings, demonstrating that pro-Russian events were accepted while Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar gatherings were denied for pretextual reasons. 27. Chapter 15 again responds to Russia’s defense that if its legislative and regulatory framework, in this instance governing the media, is lawful, it cannot be accused of discrimination. This Chapter refutes this fallacy, establishing that Russia’s application in Crimea of its restrictive media regime had the purpose or effect of disproportionately burdening the right to free speech of the Crimean Tatar and ethnic Ukrainian communities, in violation of CERD Articles 2(1), 5(d)(viii), and 5(e)(vi).\n\n28. Chapter 16 responds to Russia’s attempts to reduce Ukraine’s complaints about the degradation of cultural heritage to one claim: the destruction of the Khan’s Palace. Ukraine sets forth numerous other instances of attempted erasure of cultural heritage in violation of CERD Articles 2(1), 5(e)(vi), and 6, while also rebutting Russia’s depiction of the work being done to the Khan’s Palace as innocent “restoration.”\n\n29. Chapter 17 describes how, regardless of whether Russia’s educational system treats all students alike, its introduction into Crimea has had the purpose or effect of significantly decreasing access to education for the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities by severely restricting the pre-existing provision of education in their native languages and significantly reducing the quality of what remains, in contravention of CERD Articles 2(1), 5(e)(v), 5(e)(vi), and 7.\n\n30. Part IV, Chapter 18, addresses Russia’s ongoing and blatant violation of the Court’s Provisional Measures Order of 19 April 2017 — namely, its failure to lift its ban on the Mejlis and to ensure that education in the Ukrainian language is available in Crimea, as well as its aggravation of all aspects of the dispute — constitutes an independent violation of its international obligations. The Reply concludes with Ukraine’s submissions in Part V.\n\n13\n\nPART II: UKRAINE’S CLAIMS UNDER THE ICSFT\n\n31. The ICSFT requires States Parties to take concrete measures in order to cooperate in the prevention and suppression of terrorism financing. The purpose of the Convention is reflected in its preamble, which stresses “the urgent need to enhance international cooperation among States in devising and adopting effective measures for the prevention of the financing of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators.”13 The ICSFT is thus based on a recognition that terrorism financing is a cross-border phenomenon, which can only be effectively prevented and suppressed by good faith cooperation between States. In this Part, Ukraine responds to Russia’s interpretations of the ICSFT that defy both the text and the object and purpose of the Convention, explains how the factual record before the Court establishes numerous instances of terrorism financing, and demonstrates Russia’s complete failure to fulfil its obligations under the Convention to take cooperative measures to prevent and punish terrorism financing.\n\nSection A: Interpretation of the ICSFT\n\nChapter 3. THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION’S FAILURES TO COOPERATE IN THE PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM FINANCING\n\n32. As with other forms of trans-boundary harm where actions in one State cause harm in another, the State where terrorism financing offenses are committed is best positioned to take measures to prevent and suppress such acts, acting both proactively and in cooperation with the State where the underlying acts of terrorism cause harm. The ICSFT promotes such cooperation by requiring States Parties to take specific cooperative measures set forth explicitly in the treaty’s provisions. For example, Article 8 requires States to take appropriate measures to identify, detect, and freeze or seize funds used or allocated for committing covered offenses. Article 9 requires States Parties to take investigative measures upon receiving information — from any source — about alleged terrorism financing. Article\n\n13 ICSFT, preamble.\n\n14\n\n10 imposes obligations to prosecute or extradite. Article 12 requires States Parties to “afford\n\none another the greatest measure of assistance” in connection with criminal investigations and\n\nproceedings. Finally, Article 18 obligates States Parties to “cooperate in the prevention of the\n\noffences set forth in article 2 by taking all practicable measures . . . to prevent and counter\n\npreparations . . . for the commission of those offences within or outside their territories.”14\n\n33. These provisions work together to create a structure for genuine, not\n\nbegrudging, cooperation. A State that is serious about its obligation to cooperate in the\n\nprevention of terrorism financing will take comprehensive action to ensure that terrorism\n\nfinancing is not committed within its territory. Such a State will establish a legislative and\n\nregulatory framework addressing terrorism financing — but it will not only do that, while\n\nrefusing to take any other cooperative measures. When a State receives information by\n\nanother State or any other source, the State will investigate promptly and thoroughly, and then\n\nbased on that investigation will prosecute or extradite those who committed acts of terrorism\n\nfinancing. When there is reasonable suspicion that funds are being used for terrorism\n\nfinancing, the State will freeze those funds immediately. When a State is informed or has\n\nreason to know that weapons flowing across its border are being used in terrorist acts, it will\n\nimmediately police its border. And if there is any indication that a State’s own officials are\n\ninvolved in providing funds to groups that are known to commit acts targeting civilians, it will\n\ntake measures to forbid and stop its officials from engaging in such conduct.\n\n34. In this case, the Russian Federation has at most made gestures toward\n\ncompliance; it has shown no genuine interest in cooperating to prevent and suppress the\n\nfinancing of terrorism in Ukraine. As a consequence, Russia has hollowed out the ICSFT’s\n\ncooperation obligations. Instead of cooperating in the suppression of terrorism financing,\n\nRussia has violated its obligations and obstructed the very object and purpose of the ICSFT.\n\n14 ICSFT, art. 18.\n\n15\n\nRussia Has Failed to Cooperate in Accordance with the ICSFT\n\n35. Russia has systematically failed to cooperate by taking the measures required by the ICSFT to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism by any person, including state officials. As established in Ukraine’s Memorial, Russia’s refusal to cooperate has taken many forms, including ignoring Ukraine’s express requests for cooperation by investigating and freezing assets, failing to provide meaningful assistance to Ukraine, and failing to take practicable measures to prevent terrorism financing, such as policing its own border and providing instructions to its own officials.15\n\n36. There is no meaningful dispute that Ukraine has requested Russia’s cooperation, but received none. For example, Ukraine provided Russia with dozens of individuals’ and organizations’ names, bank account numbers, and other identifying information for funds suspected to be used in terrorism financing. In response, despite Ukraine’s repeated requests, Russia did not freeze any of the identified assets.16 Ukraine asked Russia to investigate more than 50 named individuals for offenses related to terrorism financing, all of which requests Russia ignored or failed to adequately investigate.17 To cite one glaring example of Russia’s bad faith: Ukraine provided information that Konstantin Malofeev, one of the most prominent businessmen in Russia and a close associate of Russia’s President, was involved in terrorism financing. Russia did not respond for almost a year, and then simply made the non-credible assertion that “[i]t was not possible to identify the location of” Mr. Malofeev.18 As with many of the examples of Russia’s non-cooperation established in\n\n15 See Ukraine’s Memorial, Chapter 3.\n\n16 See Ukraine’s Memorial, Chapter 3, Section B.\n\n17 See Ukraine’s Memorial, Chapter 3, Section B.\n\n18 Russian Federation Note Verbale No. 10448 to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (31 July 2015) (Ukraine’s Memorial, Annex 376).\n\n16\n\nthe Memorial, Russia’s Counter-Memorial ignores these uncomfortable facts.\n\n37. Russia’s Counter-Memorial ignores several practicable measures — identified in Ukraine’s Memorial — that Russia should have taken, but did not take, to prevent acts of terrorism financing from being committed in Russia. These practicable measures included instructing its own officials not to finance terrorism, policing its border to ensure weapons do not enter Ukrainian territory, and monitoring and disrupting DPR and LPR fundraising networks within its territory.19 For example, Ukraine repeatedly informed Russia about impending transfers of funds from Russian to Ukrainian territory, but Russia ignored these warnings and took no steps to stop the flow of funds.20 Russia’s disregard of Ukraine’s requests for cooperation at the border is particularly egregious: after months of Ukraine requesting a joint meeting between the two States’ border services to address the flow of weapons across the border, Russia finally offered the incredible response that it had not identified a Russian government agency with relevant authority.21\n\n38. From this general pattern of non-cooperation grows Russia’s specific and numerous violations of Articles 8, 9, 10, 12, and 18 of the ICSFT, which are addressed in more detail in Chapter 8, below. Together, they reveal a State that shows no interest whatsoever in cooperating in the prevention and suppression of the financing of terrorism — at least when the State experiencing the consequences is Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Counter-Memorial Attempts to Diminish the Scope of the ICSFT and Minimize Its Own Obligations\n\n39. Russia is now faced with defending its record of non-cooperation before this Court, but it makes no attempt to show that it took measures to cooperate. Rather than attempt to defend an indefensible record, Russia proffers an implausibly thin theory of ICSFT compliance that would entirely strip the Convention of meaning and effectiveness.\n\n19 See Ukraine’s Memorial, Chapter 6, Section A.\n\n20 See Ukraine’s Memorial, Chapter 3, Section A.\n\n21 See Ukraine’s Memorial, para. 185.\n\n17\n\n40. Russia does not dispute most of the critical facts before the Court. It does not,\n\nfor example, dispute that illegal armed groups in Ukraine have inflicted death, destruction,\n\nand intimidation on Ukraine’s civilian population. Russia does not dispute that as early as\n\n2014, there was widespread reporting by U.N. human rights monitors and other credible\n\nsources that these groups were targeting civilians, murdering political opponents, and\n\n“inflict[ing] on the populations a reign of intimidation and terror to maintain their position of\n\ncontrol.”22 Russia does not dispute that individuals and organizations in Russia mounted\n\nlarge-scale efforts to fund the groups in Ukraine that had a well-known record of attacking\n\ncivilians. Russia does not dispute that its own officials have provided assets to these groups,\n\nincluding the Buk missile system that was used to shoot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17,\n\nand the multiple launch rocket systems used to shell civilian areas in Ukrainian cities. Russia\n\ndoes not dispute that it ignored numerous requests to investigate allegations of terrorism\n\nfinancing occurring within its territory; that it disregarded requests to guard its border to\n\nprevent the financing of terrorism; and that it never took any measures to prevent its own\n\nofficials from funding groups that commit terrorist acts in Ukraine.\n\n41. Instead, Russia seeks to nullify the ICSFT’s cooperation obligations, in two\n\nmain ways. First, Russia repeatedly offers interpretations that defy the text and defeat the\n\nobject and purpose of the Convention. Second, Russia attempts to erect heightened\n\nevidentiary hurdles with regard to what constitutes a terrorism financing offense under Article\n\n2 of the treaty. The self-evident goal of these legal tactics is to ensure that Russia’s obligation\n\nto cooperate to prevent and suppress terrorism financing can never be triggered.\n\n22 OHCHR, Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine (15 July 2014), para. 26 (Ukraine’s\n\nMemorial, Annex 296).\n\n18\n\n42. Russia’s first strategy has been evident from the beginning of this case. At the preliminary objections stage, Russia argued that the phrase “any person” in Article 2 excluded some persons, i.e., State officials, such that Russia would have no obligation to take cooperative measures to prevent its own officials from financing terrorism. The Court disagreed with Russia, but Russia continues to advance restrictive interpretations at odds with the words of the treaty.23 It now argues, for example, that the phrase “assets of every kind” in Article 1 means only assets of some kind, such that providing terrorists with non-financial assets (such as weapons) is not an offense under the Convention, perversely freeing Russia from any obligation to take measures to prevent and suppress the supply of weapons to groups that carry out terrorist attacks on civilians.24\n\n43. Russia further argues that the obligation in Article 18 to cooperate by taking “all practicable measures” means only some practical measures, limited to legislative or regulatory measures — going so far as to state that if individuals in Russia are known to be engaged in terrorism financing activities, the ICSFT does not require Russia to take any measures to actually “prevent these persons from operating.”25 Russia’s interpretive errors are discussed in more detail in the chapters that follow, but they should be considered together as a thoroughgoing effort by Russia to deprive the words of the ICSFT of their ordinary meaning and to prevent the treaty from achieving its core aims.\n\n44. Russia’s second strategy is to compound the effect of these restrictive interpretations with requests for the Court to apply unusually high evidentiary standards, borrowed from cases adjudicating State responsibility for the crime of genocide.26 But this case is about different Russian treaty violations, not about state responsibility for the crime of\n\n23 Application of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2019, p. 585, para. 61 [Judgment on Preliminary Objections].\n\n24 See Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, Chapter II.\n\n25 See Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, Chapter VIII, Section VI.\n\n26 See Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, Chapter I, Section IV.\n\n19\n\ngenocide. It is about Russia’s failure to cooperate in the prevention and suppression of the financing of terrorist acts by any person in Russian territory. The manifest incorrectness of Russia’s evidentiary approach is discussed in the next Section.\n\nUkraine’s Burden Is to Establish that Russia Breached Its Obligations to Cooperate Under the ICSFT Without Resorting to Heightened Evidentiary Standards\n\n45. Ukraine’s burden before the Court is to establish, according to ordinary evidentiary standards, that Russia failed to take the measures required by the ICSFT to cooperate in the prevention and suppression of terrorism financing. Russia’s Counter-Memorial errs in its approach to what Ukraine needs to prove, and how Ukraine may prove it. Ultimately, Russia’s attempt to create heightened evidentiary burdens are irrelevant to the only critical fact here: that it did nothing to cooperate. Russia’s arguments cannot distract from this bald fact of comprehensive non-compliance with its obligations under the ICSFT.\n\nRussia’s Responsibility for Failing to Take Cooperative Measures Can Be Established Without Conclusive Proof that Specific Acts of Terrorism Financing Were Committed\n\n46. Ukraine claims that Russia has failed to take specific measures that it was required to take under Articles 8, 9, 10, 12, and 18 of the Convention. Russia, however, largely focuses not on its own cooperation or lack thereof, but on the actions of others: the funders of the covered acts who committed offenses under Article 2(1) of the Convention, and (even further removed) the third parties who carried out the covered acts. According to Russia, “to uphold Ukraine’s claim the Court will, first, need to make a determination that there was an act of terrorism financing, before considering whether Russia complied with an obligation to prevent such act.”27 The main support Russia provides for this argument is the Court’s\n\n27 Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, para. 596.\n\n20\n\nconclusion in the Bosnian Genocide case that “a State can be held responsible for breaching the obligation to prevent genocide only if genocide was actually committed.”28\n\n47. To be clear, Ukraine has indeed proven many acts of terrorism financing. These specific offenses and the evidence showing they were committed are discussed in Chapter 7 of this Reply. Russia is also wrong, however, to claim that it can avoid responsibility for failing to take the cooperative measures required by the Convention, simply by claiming insufficient proof of the underlying terrorism financing offense. Russia’s total failure to cooperate to suppress and prevent the financing of terrorism establishes violations of the ICSFT’s operative provisions separate from proof of specific terrorist acts or their financing.\n\n48. As an initial matter, Ukraine’s claims relate to several different requirements of cooperative action, and the duty to take such action under the ICSFT is triggered by different thresholds. For example, Article 9 imposes a duty to investigate whenever information is provided “that a person . . . is alleged to have committed an offence set forth in Article 2.” If a State receives information about alleged terrorism financing, it must investigate. Article 8 requires appropriate measures to identify, detect, freeze, or seize assets used or allocated for use in terrorism financing; the degree of proof will necessarily depend on the severity of the measure in question. If there is reasonable suspicion of terrorism financing, for example, a State must take the urgent and temporary measure of freezing assets.\n\n49. The obligation under Article 18 is to “cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2,” and to do so “by taking all practicable measures . . . to prevent and counter preparations” for such offenses. While prevention of terrorism financing is the objective of these measures, the obligation is to take the measures.\n\n50. Russia argues that absent conclusive proof that terrorism financing offenses have been committed, no violation of Article 18 is possible. This argument is based on a flawed\n\n28 Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, para. 595 (quoting Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, I.C.J. Reports 2007, p. 221, para. 431 [hereinafter Bosnian Genocide]).\n\n21\n\nanalogy between Article I of the Genocide Convention, under which States “undertake to prevent” genocide, and Article 18 of the ICSFT, under which States “shall cooperate in the prevention” of terrorism financing “by taking all practicable measures.” Russia’s analogy simply does not work for several reasons.\n\n51. First, an obligation to “cooperate” in the prevention of an act by taking certain “measures” is different from an obligation “to prevent” an act from occurring at all. The International Law Commission, in Article 14(3) of the Articles on State Responsibility, states that “[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs.”29 If there is an obligation to prevent harm, and the harm does not occur, the obligation to prevent that harm has been fulfilled. By contrast, the obligation under Article 18 of the ICSFT is to “cooperate” by taking “practicable measures.” If a State has an obligation to take measures, and it does not take those measures in a situation in which they are called for, the obligation is violated regardless of what happens next. For example, if the supply of a limpet mine to a terrorist poised to strike civilians is averted by the swift action of domestic law enforcement who is able to intercede before the mine is transferred, that fortuitous event would not absolve Russia for a manifest failure to take the preventive measures required of it under the Convention. Indeed, the very point of an obligation to take concrete preventative measures is to ensure that States Parties act before harmful terrorist consequences may occur.\n\n52. Though Russia seeks to draw an analogy to the Bosnian Genocide judgment, it disregards the Court’s observation that alongside the duty to prevent in that case, there was a\n\n29 U.N. General Assembly Resolution 56/83, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, Annex (28 January 2002) (emphasis added). The Court relied on this article in Bosnian Genocide to conclude that the duty to prevent genocide is established only upon occurrence of genocide. See Bosnian Genocide, para. 431.\n\n22\n\n“corresponding duty to act.”30 This “duty to act” did not depend on proof of the occurrence of genocide, but “arise[s] at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.”31 Thus, the State has a duty to act to prevent genocide if it “has available to it means likely to have a deterrent effect on those suspected of preparing genocide, or reasonably suspected of harbouring specific intent (dolus specialis).”32 A failure of this duty to act is not, on its own, a basis for responsibility under the Genocide Convention, because a duty to prevent genocide cannot be breached unless and until genocide is committed. The obligations under the ICSFT are different. The duty is not merely to prevent terrorism financing, but to cooperate by taking practicable measures. That is an affirmative duty to act. Failure to cooperate by taking the measures appropriate in the circumstances violates that duty, whatever the final outcome.\n\n53. The ICSFT is premised on cooperation between States Parties. Accordingly, if one State asks another State to take measures to address the possibility of terrorism financing, the State should approach that request with a view toward cooperation. A law-abiding, cooperative State would presume that the request is made of it in good faith, and take preventive measures that have been requested of it, at least absent some explanation for why the measure is not practicable or appropriate (an explanation which Russia never provided when ignoring or dismissing out of hand Ukraine’s requests for cooperation). At a minimum, if terrorism financing is reasonably suspected, a State is obligated by Article 18 to take whatever practicable measures are available to it to address and mitigate the risk. A State cannot categorically refuse to take any measures to prevent terrorism financing and then as an excuse simply assert a lack of conclusive proof of the mental elements of a terrorist act under Article 2 of the Convention, which would typically only be developed after an offense is committed and a full criminal investigation occurs.\n\n30 Bosnian Genocide, para. 431.\n\n31 Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\n32 Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\n23\n\n54. Second, treaty text and context further compel the conclusion that the duty to cooperate by taking practicable measures is breached at the time measures should be, but are not, taken. Article 2(3) of the ICSFT states that “it shall not be necessary that the funds were actually used to carry out” a terrorist act, which, as the Finnish diplomat and ICSFT negotiator Marja Lehto observes, demonstrates that terrorism financing is “a prospective crime” that “may — or may not — lead to terrorist violence.”33 As further context, Article 2(4) provides that “[a]ny person also commits an offence if that person attempts to commit an offence” under Article 2. And Article 18 provides that practicable measures must be taken not only to “prevent” the commission of terrorism financing offenses, but also to “counter preparations . . . for the commission of those offences.” There are many examples of this in other contexts. For example, the international environmental law rule of harm prevention is an obligation of conduct, and thus “a breach occurs when the relevant state’s conduct falls short of what due diligence required.”34 A domestic law example arises where a person is legally obligated to take prophylactic measures to safely store explosive materials, but instead leaves explosives dangerously exposed to fire; the obligation is violated whether or not the explosives ignite.35 Like these other violations of due diligence obligations, a violation of an obligation to take measures to prevent and counter preparation for a terrorism financing offense cannot depend on proof of what happens following the failure to take the required measures. The breach occurs when there was a failure to take those measures.\n\n33 Marja Lehto, Indirect Responsibility for Terrorist Acts 258 (2009), p. 296 (Ukraine’s Memorial, Annex 490).\n\n34 Jutta Brunnée, Harm Prevention, in THE OXFORD HANDBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (Lavanya Rajamani & Jacqueline Peel, eds., 2d ed. 2021) (Ukraine’s Reply, Annex 73); see also Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with commentaries, 53rd. Sess., U.N. Doc. No. A/56/10 (23 April–1 June, 2 July–10 August 2001), art. 16 & commentary, p. 154, para. 7, reproduced in Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, vol. II(2) (“It is the conduct of the State of origin that will determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the present articles.”).\n\n35 See e.g., The Explosive Regulations 2014, SI 2014/1638 (United Kingdom), accessed at https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1638/data.pdf.\n\n24\n\n55. Third, conclusive proof that an act of terrorism financing has been committed on the territory of a State will often only be available with the cooperation of the State in which the offense is committed. A failure to cooperate by the State where the offense is allegedly carried out may be the very reason why there is a lack of proof of the terrorism financing offense. In this case, Russia refused even to investigate allegations of terrorism financing, yet then claims that Ukraine lacks sufficient proof of various mental elements of the offense of financing terrorism and the underlying terrorist acts. But if, as Russia proposes, there can be no violation of the Convention without final proof of both an act of terror and the knowing financing of it, the Convention’s entire logic would be reversed: a State could achieve near complete immunity from responsibility under the ICSFT by stubbornly refusing to cooperate in any respect. A totally noncompliant State Party would be perversely rewarded for flouting its obligations to cooperate, making Russia’s interpretation completely opposed to the object and purpose of the Convention.\n\nThe Heightened Evidentiary Standard Proposed by Russia Is Not Appropriate for Proving the Terrorism Financing Offenses that Underlie Russia’s Breaches of the ICSFT\n\n56. In addition to demanding proof of the commission of terrorism financing offenses, Russia argues that Ukraine must prove these offenses with evidence that is “fully conclusive,” without the benefit of any inference unless it is “the only reasonable inference that can be drawn.”36 Since the objective facts of these offenses are largely undisputed, Russia asks the Court to apply this heightened evidentiary standard “in particular [to] the requisite mental elements of the offence.”37 Though Russia presents this evidentiary standard in legalistic terms, the Court should take note of what it would mean in practice. On Russia’s view, even if a strong inference can be drawn that a group is intentionally targeting civilians for purposes of intimidation, and someone within Russian territory is knowingly funding that group and its\n\n36 Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, para. 13 (quoting Bosnian Genocide, para. 290).\n\n37 Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, para. 12. As discussed in Chapter 5, Russia erroneously refers to the objective nature of the acts which may not be funded as “mental elements.”\n\n25\n\nacts, Russia would have no obligation to take actions to stop the funder, as long as it is possible that a different inference could be drawn regarding the purpose and intent of those third parties who ultimately murder civilian activists, shell civilian areas, or bomb peaceful rallies. Yet Russia cannot explain why, as a good faith interpretation of the ICSFT, a State should be relieved of the obligation to take practicable measures that could prevent likely or even potential instances of terrorism financing — such as effective border control — just because there is some possibility that a different inference could be drawn about the intent and purpose of a third party’s conduct. Nor can Russia explain why a State should be permitted to demand from another State the level of proof normally reserved for criminal prosecution, before it is willing to take basic cooperative measures to address a risk of terrorism financing.\n\n57. The heightened evidentiary standard sought by Russia has only been applied by this Court in genocide cases, in which the Court was asked to conclude that a State bore responsibility for committing the crime of genocide. That unusual context called for particular evidentiary standards unique to those cases. In this case, however, Ukraine is alleging that Russia failed to comply with its duty to cooperate in the prevention of terrorism financing by taking practicable measures — a serious treaty breach, but not a criminal charge against the State itself. Nor is Ukraine attempting to establish State responsibility for the underlying act of terrorism, or for violation of any duty to prevent terrorist acts. The evidentiary standard in this case should not be similar to that of a prosecutor’s burden to establish criminal responsibility for committing genocide.\n\n58. Russia’s proposed evidentiary standard is particularly ill-suited to this case, where Russia focuses heavily on the underlying acts of terrorism committed by third parties. According to Russia, Ukraine must prove with “fully conclusive” evidence, drawing inferences only where no other inference is possible, that a third party’s act was an “act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian,” and that its purpose was “to intimidate a\n\n26\n\npopulation, or to compel a government.”38 It is inherently more difficult to prove a third\n\nparty’s mental state, and the ICSFT was drafted accordingly: Article 2(3) establishes that a\n\nresulting terrorist act does not need to be proven, and Article 2(1)(b) instructs that “nature or\n\ncontext” should be consulted to evaluate purpose. Under the Convention, a State Party is not\n\nentitled to presume that an illegal armed group that is in fact harming civilians may still be\n\nfunded until conclusive proof of that group’s mental state is presented. Applying Russia’s\n\nheightened evidentiary standard in this context would defy the ICSFT’s text and undermine\n\nand weaken the Convention’s objective of enhancing cooperation in the prevention and\n\nsuppression of terrorism financing.\n\n59. Apart from the genocide context, this Court has addressed breaches of\n\nimportant international norms, such as the unlawful use of force by one State against another,\n\nwithout resorting to the heightened evidentiary standards Russia invites the Court to apply in\n\nthis case. The Court has instead considered whether there is “sufficient evidence” or\n\n“convincing evidence” to establish such breaches. For example, in Armed Activities on the\n\nTerritory of the Congo, the Court found “sufficient evidence to prove that there were attacks\n\nagainst the Embassy and acts of maltreatment against Ugandan diplomats at Ndjili\n\nInternational Airport,”39 and “convincing evidence of the training in UPDF [Uganda People’s\n\nDefence Force] training camps of child soldiers and the UPDF’s failure to prevent the\n\nrecruitment of child soldiers in area under its control.”40 The Court analyzed various United\n\n38 Russia’s Counter-Memorial, Part I, para. 13.\n\n39 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda),\n\nJudgment, I.C.J.

Moreover, as the Court recently reiterated, “a State that is not in a position to provide direct proof of certain facts ‘should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.’”43 One circumstance where the Court has permitted this more liberal recourse to inferences is where relevant evidence is outside the applicant State’s “exclusive territorial control.” 44 That is the case here: Russia’s Counter-Memorial focuses on the mental state of funders who are in Russia, and on the intent and purposes of perpetrators, some of whom are in areas not controlled by Ukraine.\n\n61. In this case, Russia’s comprehensive failure to cooperate in the prevention and punishment of the financing of terrorism constitutes a serious breach of international law, but it does not call for importation of standards from the sui generis context of state responsibility for the crime of genocide. The Court should apply the typical standards it uses in resolving disputes between States regarding other serious breaches of international law. In doing so, it should have liberal recourse to inferences and circumstantial evidence, on account of (i) the structure of the ICSFT and the relevance of the acts of third parties, and (ii) the fact that the third parties at issue have not been located in territory controlled by Ukraine. If there is sufficient evidence that Russia has breached its many obligations to cooperate under the Convention by taking preventive measures, such an evidentiary record establishes its breach.\n\n41 Ibid., paras. 208, 210.\n\n42 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The States Parties’ cooperation obligations under the ICSFT are designed to prevent and suppress the commission of terrorism financing offenses, as defined in Article 2 of the Treaty. Throughout its Counter-Memorial, Russia repeatedly attempts to strip Article 2’s definition of the offense of terrorism financing of practical effect. The effect of Russia’s proposed interpretation is to nullify Russia’s substantive obligations to cooperate.\n\n63. First, Russia seeks to re-define the word “funds,” which Article 1 of the Convention defines to include “assets of every kind.” In an attempt to shrink the scope of the ICSFT, however, Russia asks the Court to read “assets of every kind” to mean only assets of some kind — only “financial assets,”45 but not “non-financial assets” such as weapons and equipment.46 In doing so, Russia envisions a porous treaty regime under which any person is forbidden from providing terrorists money with which to buy weapons, but any person is free to provide terrorists with the very same weapons directly. As a result, in Russia’s view, when persons in Russia’s territory are directly supplying weapons to perpetrators of terrorist acts in the territory of another State, Russia is under no obligation to cooperate in the prevention and suppression of this provision of weapons to those engaged in terrorist acts.\n\n64. Second, Russia seeks to make it unreasonably difficult to prove knowledge on the part of the funder, again in an effort to limit its own obligations to cooperate in the prevention and suppression of terrorism financing. Russia initially appears to argue that a funder must know to a certainty that particular funds will be specifically directed toward terrorist acts. Such a rule would, as a practical matter, nullify the ICSFT. As the drafters of the treaty were well aware, groups that engage in terrorist acts also engage in other activities,\n\n45 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, paras. 73, 99\n\n46 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 37.\n\n29\n\nand it is impossible for a funder to know exactly how a third party will use fungible assets. Understandably, Russia is unwilling to embrace the implications of its own argument, and ultimately concedes Ukraine’s fundamental point by acknowledging that knowledge under Article 2(1) may be established where a person provides funds to a group or individual known to commit terrorist acts.47 Yet even then, Russia attempts to deprive its concession of practical effect, proposing an arbitrary rule, unmoored from the text of the Convention, that a group cannot be treated as a known perpetrator of terrorist acts unless it has been “characterised by the international community” as a terrorist group.48 This argument defies the ICSFT drafters’ deliberate decision to focus on acts rather than labels, designations, and characterizations, and is refuted by how States apply the ICSFT in practice.\n\nThe ICSFT Defines “Funds” to Encompass “Assets of Every Kind,” Including Weapons\n\n65. The ICSFT defines “funds” in Article 1(1) to mean:\n\nassets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, however acquired, and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to, or interest in, such assets, including, but not limited to, bank credits, travellers cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts, letters of credit.49\n\n66. Thus, the term “funds” has a special meaning for purposes of the ICSFT. Whenever it appears in the Convention, it refers to “assets of every kind.”50\n\n47 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 125.\n\n48 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 125.\n\n49 ICSFT, art. 1(1) (emphasis added).\n\n50 See Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 31(4) 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (“A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.”); Richard Gardiner, TREATY INTERPRETATION (2d ed., 2015), p. 339 (“The most common way in which a special meaning is indicated is by including a definition article in a treaty.”) (Ukraine’s Reply, Annex 72).\n\n30\n\n67. A weapon easily fits within the Article 1(1) definition, as it is an “asset,” which\n\nis “tangible” and “movable.” Consistent with this point, the Court’s Judgment rejecting\n\nRussia’s Preliminary Objections observed that “[t]his definition covers many kinds of financial\n\ninstruments and includes also other assets.”51 Prior to its Counter-Memorial, including during\n\nthe preliminary objections phase, Russia never denied that weapons fall within the category\n\nof “assets of every kind.” Now, however, Russia argues that “non-financial assets” are not\n\nwithin the scope of the Convention.52 Russia’s new position is that “assets of every kind” does\n\nnot mean every kind of asset, but only some kinds: “financial assets”53 are an “asset of every\n\nkind,” but “non-financial assets,”54 including weapons, are somehow not.\n\n68. Russia’s proposed interpretation of “funds” must be rejected. It contradicts the\n\nCourt’s explanation that the Convention covers “financial instruments” and “also other\n\nassets.”55 It defies the ordinary meaning of “assets of every kind” — in French, “biens de toute\n\nnature,” using a word that refers broadly to goods or property. Russia’s interpretation would\n\nalso thwart the Convention’s object and purpose of enhancing cooperation in the prevention\n\nof the financing of terrorism, so that terrorists cannot procure the weapons and other\n\nmaterials needed to commit acts of terrorism. It would make no sense to create an\n\ninternational regime to deprive terrorists of the money they need to purchase weapons and\n\nequipment in order to carry out terrorist acts, only to leave untouched what Russia refers to\n\nas “direct, in-kind support,” such as the transfer of arms, which may be more immediately and\n\n51 Judgment on Preliminary Objections, p. 586, para. 62 (emphasis added).\n\n52 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 37.\n\n53 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, paras. 73, 99.\n\n54 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 37.\n\n55 Judgment on Preliminary Objections, p. 586, para. 62 (emphasis added).\n\n31\n\ndirectly useful in carrying out terrorist acts.56 The travaux préparatoires confirm that the States Parties did not intend this surprising result. As the United States summarized in its domestic ratification process, the treaty’s definition of “funds” “was understood by all delegations to include property.”57\n\n69. Notwithstanding all of this, Russia bases its argument on an assumption that the undefined phrase “financing of terrorism” in the title and preamble limits the ICSFT’s scope. In so doing, Russia ignores the reasoning of its own Supreme Court, which has stated that the “financing of terrorism . . . should also be understood as the provision or collection not only of money (in cash or non-cash form), but also of material assets.”58 This understanding of terrorism financing by Russia’s own Supreme Court is consistent with the proper interpretation of the phrase “assets of every kind” in Article 1 of the ICSFT.\n\nA Good Faith Interpretation of “Assets of Every Kind,” According to its Ordinary Meaning and Read in Context, Covers All Forms of Property, Including Weapons\n\n70. As a matter of ordinary meaning, a weapon is an “asset of every kind.” Dictionaries define “assets” to include “the property of a person.”59 The same breadth is conveyed by the Convention’s authentic texts in other languages. Had Article 1(1) been meant to refer only to financial assets, the French term “avoirs” might have been used. Instead, the Convention uses the phrase “biens de toute nature,” using the word “biens” which refers to\n\n56 See Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 101.\n\n57 Submittal Letter from the Secretary of State, International Convention for the Suppression of Financing Terrorism (Oct. 3, 2000), accessed at https://www.congress.gov/106/cdoc/tdoc49/CDOC-106tdoc49.pdf.\n\n58 Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, No. 1 of 9 February 2012, “On Some Aspects of Judicial Practice Relating to Criminal Cases on Crimes of Terrorist Nature,” para. 16 (Ukraine’s Memorial, Annex 438) (emphasis added).\n\n59 Asset, Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed., 1989); Asset, Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed., 2008).\n\n32\n\ngoods generally. Likewise, the Spanish text uses the phrase “los bienes de cualquier tipo,”\n\nagain using a word (“bienes”) that speaks generally of goods or property, and not only financial\n\nassets. Even Russia in its Counter-Memorial finds it natural to distinguish between “financial\n\nassets” and “non-financial assets.”60 Russia’s use of the phrase “financial assets” confirms that\n\nthe word “assets” alone does not mean solely financial assets.\n\n71. The complete definition of funds in Article 1(1) further supports the conclusion\n\nthat “assets of every kind” includes weapons and other non-financial assets. After specifying\n\nthat “funds” means “assets of every kind,” Article 1 provides that such assets are within the\n\ndefinition whether they are “tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, however\n\nacquired.” These words are indicative of an all-encompassing definition, reinforcing that no\n\ntype of asset is excluded. To state the obvious, weapons are assets that are both tangible and\n\nmovable and therefore fall under the Convention’s definition.\n\n72. Moreover, the clarification that assets can be “tangible or intangible” as well as\n\n“movable or immovable” would not make sense if “assets of every kind” were interpreted to\n\nrefer only to financial assets. The phrase “intangible asset,” according to the accepted\n\ninternational accounting standards that guide common practice, means “an identifiable nonmonetary\n\nasset without physical substance,” such as “scientific or technical knowledge” and\n\n“computer software, patents, [and] copyrights.”61 These intangible, non-monetary assets\n\nwould be excluded from Russia’s narrow category of “financial assets,” even though Article 1(1)\n\n60 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, paras. 37, 73, 99.\n\n61 International Accounting Standard 38 – Intangible Assets, International Financial Reporting\n\nStandards (2021), para. 9, accessed at https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/\n\npublications/pdf-standards/english/2021/issued/part-a/ias-38-intangible-assets.pdf (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Asset, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (defining “intangible asset” as “[a]ny\n\nnonphysical asset or resource that can be amortized or converted to cash, such as patents, goodwill,\n\nand computer programs, or a right to something, such as services paid for in advance”).\n\n33\n\nstates plainly that intangible assets are within the scope of the definition. Similarly, an “immovable” asset refers to real estate, such as land and buildings.62 As non-financial assets, immovable assets also would be excluded under Russia’s interpretation, despite Article 1(1)’s express statement that such assets are included.\n\n73. Article 1(2) defines funds as:\n\nassets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, however acquired, and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to, or interest in, such assets, including, but not limited to, bank credits, travellers cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts, letters of credit.\n\n74. The definition includes a list of illustrative examples of “legal documents or instruments.” Russia mistakenly describes this list as reflecting “specific categories of assets,” from which it attempts to infer that “assets” is “only meant to encompass” items “that are similar in nature to those explicitly listed.”63 This is not, however, a list of “categories of assets.” Article 1(1) defines “funds” to include “assets of every kind . . . and legal documents or instruments” that are evidence of an interest in “such assets.” The specific examples provided (bank credits, shares, etc.) are types of “legal documents or instruments” evidencing an interest in an asset, not “assets” themselves.\n\n75. Leading commentaries on the ICSFT are consistent with Ukraine’s interpretation of “assets of every kind.” Marja Lehto explains that the Convention’s definition\n\n62 See, e.g., UK HM Revenue & Customs, INTM153070 - Description of double taxation agreements: Income from immovable property, accessed at https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/international-manual/intm153070 (“In the United Kingdom ‘immovable property’ means, generally, land, the buildings erected on land, minerals in the soil and rights over land.”); Swiss Civil Code, art. 655, accessed at https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/24/233_245_233/en (defining “immovable property” to refer to, for example, “parcels of land and the buildings thereon”).\n\n63 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 30.\n\n34\n\nof “funds” is “broad” and “comes close to ‘material assistance.’”64 Anthony Aust, former\n\nDeputy Legal Adviser of the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, explains that\n\nthe definition of “funds” was “drawn deliberately wide.”65 Roberto Lavalle, Minister-\n\nCounsellor of the Permanent Mission of Guatemala to the United Nations and a member of\n\nthe Sixth Committee when it considered the draft text of the ICSFT in 1999, observed that the\n\ndefinition covers all “material assistance” to those who commit terrorism, and includes\n\n“animals, buildings or vehicles,” and “virtually anything under the sun.”66 Russia’s Counter-\n\nMemorial does not address these commentaries or identify any that supports its strained\n\nreading of “assets of every kind” to mean only “financial assets.”\n\n76. Russia’s effort to constrict the ICSFT’s broad language referring to “assets of\n\nevery kind” relies heavily on unpersuasive inferences it attempts to draw from other provisions\n\nof the Convention. Russia dwells on the use of the word “financing” in the title and preamble\n\nof the treaty,67 but the use of this term adds nothing to the interpretation of “assets of every\n\nkind.” The term “financing” is not used in the operative provisions of the treaty, and it is not\n\ndefined by the treaty. Rather, the treaty uses the word “funds” to describe what may not be\n\nprovided, and it defines “funds” to encompass “assets of every kind.” For purposes of the\n\nICSFT, therefore, “financing” is simply the provision of “funds,” meaning “assets of every\n\nkind.” The treaty’s express definition of “funds” informs what is meant by the more general\n\n64 Marja Lehto, Indirect Responsibility for Terrorist Acts (2009), p. 261 (Ukraine’s Memorial, Annex\n\n490).\n\n65 Anthony Aust, Counter-Terrorism—A New Approach: The International Convention for the\n\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 5 Max Planck Y.B.

The circularity of Russia’s argument is apparent from the drafting history. As explained further below, an earlier draft of the treaty did define the term “financing,” and specified that it included “financial resources,” “assets,” and “other property.”68 Thus, the provision of any kind of property was understood to be “financing,” contrary to what Russia now argues. The drafters ultimately reached the same result in a different way — by adopting a definition of “funds” that itself includes all forms of property. With that change, there was no need to define the term “financing” or use it in the treaty’s operative provisions, because the definition of “funds” had been enlarged to address all forms of financing — including the provision of property — that the Convention was intended to cover.\n\n78. Russia also notes that particular provisions of the Convention — Articles 12(2), 13, 18(1)(b), and 18(2) — are specific to money and banking-related crimes. The inclusion of these provisions, however, does not mean the treaty was only concerned with financial assets. Monetary and banking issues were indisputably an important part of the Convention (and an area already subject to extensive regulation domestically and internationally), so it is not surprising that there are provisions addressing these points. Their inclusion does not imply that the scope of the Convention is limited to financial assets, in direct contradiction of the broad definition of “funds” as “assets of every kind.”69\n\n68 Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Third session, Draft international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism, Working document submitted by France, U.N. Doc. A/AC.252/L.7, p. 2 (11 March 1999) (Russia’s Objections, Annex 5).\n\n69 Russia further argues that the “necessary implication” of Article 8(4) , which requires consideration for using funds derived from forfeitures to compensate victims, is that funds can only be financial, because weapons cannot “be sold on the open market.” Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 58. Yet “[a]ssets of every kind” is not limited to weapons; it includes equipment, vehicles, and other goods. If, for example, the relevant asset is a vehicle, the government could seize the vehicle, auction it, and use the monetary proceeds to compensate victims. Even if some kinds of assets are not\n\n36\n\nThe Object and Purpose of the ICSFT Compels an Interpretation of “Assets of Every Kind” to Include All Property, Including Weapons\n\n79. The purpose of the ICSFT was to counter the rising tide of global terrorism by addressing terrorism financing, which, as explained in the preamble, had not previously been “expressly address[ed]” in a binding international instrument.70 The preamble further notes a deep “concern[] about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism,” calling on all States to “prevent and counteract . . . the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations.”71\n\n80. In light of the ICSFT’s purpose, it makes no sense to define a terrorism financing offense for any person that provides money for use in terrorist acts, but not for any person that provides arms, explosives, equipment, and other goods for use in terrorist acts. Money cannot be used directly to commit a terrorist act — it only furthers acts of terrorism by being exchanged for weapons and other materials necessary to commit terrorist acts. Russia’s attempt to limit the scope of the ICSFT would leave a large loophole that would thwart the Convention’s objective of denying terrorists the resources needed to commit acts of terrorism.\n\n81. Russia argues that “a matter as sensitive as regulating the provision of weapons to non-state groups” would not have been covered by the Convention without being more “explicit[].”72 But Ukraine has never argued that the ICSFT governs “the provision of weapons to non-state groups” as such. The Convention sets forth concrete obligations on States Parties to cooperate in the suppression and prevention of the financing of terrorist acts. Within the Convention’s scope is the provision of assets of every kind, including weapons, with the knowledge that they are to be used, or intention that they should be used, for specific types of unlawful acts. Russia does not explain what it considers sensitive about denying weapons to groups that commit acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to civilians, which by\n\namenable to such a process, that presents no issue for Article 8(4), which merely requires States to “consider establishing mechanisms” to compensate victims from funds derived from forfeitures.\n\n70 ICSFT, preamble.\n\n71 Ibid.\n\n72 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 38.\n\n37\n\ntheir nature or context have a purpose of intimidation or compulsion. Russia cannot seriously\n\nclaim a sovereign right to allow its territory to be used as a safe haven for the unlawful delivery\n\nof weapons to illegal armed groups in other States that attack civilians for terrorist purposes.\n\n82. Russia is also incorrect that respecting the Convention’s use of the phrase\n\n“assets of every kind” would “through the backdoor, turn the ICSFT into an all-embracing\n\ncomprehensive convention on which the international community has so far unfortunately\n\nfailed to reach a consensus.”73 Russia refers to efforts to create a comprehensive convention\n\nthat would regulate all acts of terrorism. Giving effect to the ordinary meaning of “assets of\n\nevery kind” in the context of the ICSFT would leave numerous issues still to be resolved in any\n\nsuch convention. The ICSFT comprehensively addresses terrorism financing, which it defines\n\nto mean providing the perpetrators of terrorist acts with “assets of every kind.”\n\nThe Relevant Rules of International Law Applicable Between Ukraine\n\nand Russia Do Not Support Russia’s Narrowing of “Assets of Every\n\nKind” to Only “Financial Assets”\n\n83. U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibit all forms of support for terrorism,\n\nincluding the provision of weapons and other property, confirming that the international\n\ncommunity’s concern with terrorism financing is not limited to monetary flows alone.74\n\nRussia emphasizes the distinction in these resolutions between “financial” support and “other”\n\nforms of support and argues that the ICSFT was only meant to cover a subset of what is covered\n\nby the Security Council resolutions.75 The more natural conclusion is that both the Security\n\nCouncil and the States Parties to the ICSFT addressed the same important issue in an equally\n\n73 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, para. 103.\n\n74 See U.N.

The Security Council resolutions\n\nlack the ICSFT’s definition of “funds” to mean “assets of every kind,” and so address monetary\n\nfinancing and other forms of material support separately. The ICSFT, by defining “funds” to\n\ninclude assets of every kind, reaches the same result.\n\n84. Russia also points to the Arms Trade Treaty as directly regulating the transfer\n\nof weapons,76 but the possibility of some overlap is unremarkable. Russia and Ukraine are not\n\nparties to the Arms Trade Treaty, which serves a different function. The Arms Trade Treaty\n\nregulates trade that can be done lawfully but for which diligence is required. The ICSFT\n\ncreates a framework for preventing and suppressing exclusively unlawful acts, i.e., providing\n\nassets of every kind for use in terrorist acts. Whereas the ICSFT addresses the unlawful\n\nprovision of assets (including weapons) intending or knowing they are to be used for terrorist\n\nacts, the Arms Trade Treaty focuses more broadly on potential diversion for “unauthorized\n\nend use and end users,” even if a transfer is not itself unlawful terrorism financing.77\n\nSupplementary Means of Interpretation Confirm that “Assets of Every\n\nKind” Includes Weapons\n\ni. The Travaux Préparatoires\n\n85. The travaux préparatoires of the ICSFT confirm that the term “assets of every\n\nkind” includes all forms of property, including weapons. Russia notes that earlier draft texts\n\nreferred to both “funds” and “property,” and that separate references to “property” were\n\n76 Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, paras. 83–91.\n\n77 Russia also attempts to distinguish regional conventions that refer to the suppression of “terrorism”\n\nversus the “suppression of financing of terrorism.” Russia’s Counter-Memorial Part I, paras. 39–44.\n\nThese have limited if any relevance, as neither Russia nor Ukraine is a party to them. In any event,\n\nthese are treaties with different goals — suppressing terrorism regulates acts of terrorism themselves.\n\nAs the language quoted by Russia shows, those treaties were concerned with the use of weapons in the\n\ncommission of terrorist acts. Ibid.\n\n39\n\ndeleted.78 Russia fails to mention, however, the reason for this deletion, which is stated in the\n\nnegotiating records: because the eventual definition of “‘funds’ was intended to refer to all\n\nproperty,” making separate references to property was “redundant.”79\n\n86. As Russia notes in its Counter-Memorial, an early draft produced by France\n\nincluded in Article 1 a definition of “financing,” to mean the “transfer or reception of funds,\n\nassets or other property.”80 Since “funds” in this draft was just one of three types of covered\n\n“financing,” the term “funds” was at that point defined narrowly, as “any type of financial\n\nresource, including the cash or currency of any State . . . .”81 Inclusion of these three distinct\n\nconcepts led to debate, with some delegations proposing “to delete the phrase ‘or other\n\nproperty’ as superfluous” in light of the term assets, while others proposed deleting “the word\n\n‘assets’” for the same reason.82 Others “preferred interpreting ‘property’ as covering only\n\narms, explosives and similar goods.”83 All of these positions, however, recognized t"
