        "text": "This article has an estimated read time of 10 minutes\n\nIn summer 1989, just four years after Roger Moore had been dangling from the top of the Golden Gate Bridge in A View to A Kill – the literal height of Rodge-style campery in the twilight his Bond tenure – James Bond was in much darker territory.\n\nTimothy Dalton had come on board relatively late for 1987’s The Living Daylights, replacing then-contractually unavailable Pierce Brosnan (he’d be back, of course). Dalton brought a broodier, more Fleming-like tone to the classic Bond formula.\n\nBut as director John Glen describes, 1989’s Licence to Kill went “the whole hog” as Bond turns rogue agent for a mission of cold-blooded revenge: a Bond film that was swearier (by 007’s usual Queen’s English standards, that is) and more violent than ever been before.\n\nIt was the first Bond film to be slapped with a 15 certificate and became the most challenging, subversive chapter in Bond’s onscreen adventures for 20 years – ever since George Lazenby had tossed convention off the Swiss mountainside in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. But what should have been the start of a new era for Bond instead marked the end of an old one.\n\nThe grittier, hard-edged feel took its cues from actions films such as Die Hard; the classic henchman became a flick-knife wielding hoodlum, played by baby-faced Benicio Del Toro; and the villain – Columbian drug lord Franz Sanchez, played by Robert Davi – was inspired by the real-life drug barons who had replaced Cold War-era Russians as the West’s enemy number one.\n\n“Michael Wilson [longtime Bond producer, writer, and stepson of Albert “Cubby” Broccoli] researched the drug problems in South America that spilled over to the rest of the world,” recalls John Glen, who directed a record five Bond films. “We discovered these drug lords were so ruthless – they held a grip over whole communities. They were vicious, with no conscience whatsoever. We realised this would have to be a darker Bond, and we were following a trend in the cinema of this much harder, more violent thing that was going on.”\n\nIndeed, Robert Davi’s Sanchez personifies the change of direction in the Bond series as much as Bond himself. A sadomasochist who cuts out the heart of a love rival and murders his own gang members, Sanchez is no volcano base-dwelling cartoon baddie.\n\nDavi was cast after screenwriter Richard Maibaum had seen him in a TV movie called Terrorist on Trial. “Richard Maibaum called up Cubby Broccoli and said, ‘Put on Channel Two right away,’” recalls Davi. “He said, ‘That’s the next bond villain,’ and Cubby said, ‘I think so too!’ They called me into the office the next day.”\n\nIt was a career-defining moment for the actor. “When I grew up in the 1960s, every kid wanted to be Bond or a Bond villain,” he says. “When I got to Hollywood it was the same. A Bond film is the crown jewel of one’s career.”\n\nDavi was already known to Cubby Broccoli. Broccoli’s daughter Tina had been a fan of The Goonies, in which Davi also played a villain (albeit a comedy one), and arranged a dinner between Davi and her father. Both Italian American, they came from the same New York neighbourhood and shared a love of Frank Sinatra. “There was a deep sympatico I had with Cubby immediately,” says Davi.\n\nFrom being cast early in the process, Davi found himself in a unique position: with the script still in development, he could help create his own Bond villain. “That character was shaped as we went along,” says Davi. “I researched and met with people who knew Pablo Escobar. Sanchez was a combination of a few of those characters. I learned the cumbia music from Columbia, some of the language, and distilled that to add some of my own touches.”\n\nOriginally called Licence Revoked (until that title was ironically revoked for fear that US audiences wouldn’t know what the word meant), the film opens with Bond as best man at the wedding of CIA pal Felix Leiter (David Hedison, reprising the role from Live and Let Die). On their way to the wedding, the duo takes a parachuting detour – still in their wedding clobber, naturally – to capture Franz Sanchez.\n\nThe story took elements from Fleming’s short The Hildebrand Rarity, including the character Milton Krest, reimagined here as one of Sanchez’s associates (played with smarmy relish by Anthony Zerbe). Sanchez also borrowed the original Krest’s penchant for beating his wife with a stingray tail, with Sanchez whipping his girlfriend – and soon-to-be Bond love interest – Lupe Lamora, played by Talisa Soto.\n\nThe film’s original conceit, with Bond “going rogue” after M orders him to drop the Sanchez vendetta – showed how far this darker Bond was willing to go to break his own rules. “You have my resignation then, Sir,” Bond bellows at M, in a grand moment of Dalton-esque theatrics. “We’re not a country club, 007!” replies M, before Bond overpowers a couple of useless MI6 cronies and leaps off the balcony.\n\nModern Bond, of course, can barely go an hour without going rogue or hanging up his double-0 status to pursue some personal vendetta. But in 1989, it was a statement: it meant bucking the formula which had been laid out by Goldfinger in 1964 and used as the template of almost every Bond film since. The last time Bond had gone rogue from the Goldfinger formula was in the stylish and daring On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, which has since been re-appreciated as one of the series’ finest moments. But that’s not where the similarities end; the murder of Leiter’s bride of their wedding day recalls Blofeld killing Bond’s bride on their wedding day at the end of OHMSS.\n\n“We were always fighting the studio,” says John Glen. “They changed their heads every five minutes and new hatchet men were brought in, telling us to cut down on the sets and cut down on the very things that made Bond what it was… the spectacle.\n\n“The main problem with Mexico is that it was so corrupt. We had to get some guns brought in from America. We’d got them through the American customs on the border, no problem. But when we got to the Mexican side, they said at the border we’d have to pay $50,000 and if we didn’t pay it today, it would go up in $20,000 increments, even though we’d cleared it all before with the government… Even if you got stopped by the police out there you put $50 in the driving licence… it was a bit different to Pinewood Studios!”\n\nOne vital component of the Bond formula that Glen didn’t want to eliminate was Desmond Llewelyn as Q, who by then was in his mid-seventies and in poor health. “The insurance company said they’d put the premiums up if we took Desmond to Mexico because he could drop dead any minute,” recalls Glen. “I said it would be a disaster to drop Q and convinced the producers to take him in a condensed role. He’s such a wonderful character and actor, he would never dream of dying in the middle of a film.”\n\n“That truck sequence was tough,” says Glen. “Those things are very unforgiving. Those big tankers… one slip and you’re mincemeat.” The sequence was largely a second unit production, filming for over seven weeks on a stretch of road between Mexicali and Tijuana which had been shut down after a series of fatal accidents. The shoot too was plagued by accidents and strange, unexplained incidents, leading the crew to speculate that the road was haunted.\n\nOne of the trucks crashed into a mountainside – a shot so impressive looking that was kept in the film – and a burst of flames shaped like a devilish hand was photographed protruding from staged explosion (rather spookily, the fiery hand was nowhere to be seen when the footage was played back, or even when it was slowed down and inspected frame by frame). In another bizarre accident, a missile fired from the location as part of the action hit someone up a telegraph pole two miles away.\n\nThe chase ends with Sanchez’s satisfying death. After being sprayed with cocaine-infused petrol, Bond ignites Sanchez with a lighter gifted to him from his old pal Felix Leiter.\n\nEven 30 years later, the film’s violent streak is striking: Sanchez’ abusive whipping of Lupe; Leiter being fed to the shark and Bond later shoving a crooked DEA agent into the tank for revenge; Benicio Del Toro dropping feet-first into an industrial grinder; and – in the film’s most cartoonish moment – Sanchez bursting Krest’s head in a pressure chamber for disloyalty. Second unit director Arthur Wooster had even shot footage of a one legged stuntman having a fake leg torn off in the shark tank that was so grisly John Glen didn’t even put it in the original cut. The violence led to a battle with both the British and US censors.\n\n“The real problem was at the end where Robert Davi goes up in flames,” Glen recalls. “It really hurt me because it was done so fantastically well, but the censor kept saying, ‘No you can’t have that,’ and taking frames out. Now whenever it’s on television, it comes up in its entirety, as we cut it originally!”\n\nAs dark and forward thinking as it is, Licence to Kill isn’t entirely free of Bondisms: 007 still can’t help sleeping with every woman he falls into a dinghy with – including CIA informer Pam Bouiver (Carey Lowell), one of the best Bond girls ever – and after all the violence and brooding intensity, Q still turns up with some exploding toothpaste.\n\nSanchez also has touches of the classic Bond villain: instead of the trademark Blofeld pussycat, he strokes and kisses a diamond-clad iguana and leaves Bond to perish on a conveyor belt of doom instead of putting a bullet between Bond’s eyes and being done with it – the same mistake so many baddies have made before. Sanchez is even prone to a Bond-style quip. “I guess it’s time to start cutting overheads,” he says before machine-gunning down an employee. It’s fitting, of course: Dalton and Davi had intended to play Bond and Sanchez as nuanced reflections of each other.\n\nThe film’s most understated moments see the pair bantering; when Bond is pretending to be Sanchez’s pal, they’re a formidable duo. It’s almost a shame they have to fall out and fight to the death. “I played that Sanchez really likes Bond,” says Davi. “The idea of loyalty is more important to Sanchez than money. That was his Achilles heel. Bond found out that Achilles heel and preyed on it. But there was a respect, in a certain way.”\n\nPremiering on June 13, 1989, Licence to Kill was a box office disappointment, particularly in the US. “Being a darker Bond we realised we might run into trouble with our traditional audience,” says John Glen. “But didn’t realise I would hurt us so much in the box office. The kids played such an important part in Bond.”\n\n“In America, for whatever reason, it didn’t translate as much as one would want,” recalls Robert Davi. “They gave it a summer release and that was an issue perhaps, going up against those other blockbusters.”\n\nFor a while, there was an uncertainty about whether Bond would return at all. Dalton was the Bond of record but the series when into a period of flux, held up by a litigation case between Cubby Broccoli and MGM/United Artists, and a prolonged development period. MGM decided if they were going to re-introduce Bond for a Nineties audience, they needed a new actor. In April 1994, Dalton released a statement stepping down from 007, which opened the door for Pierce Brosnan to finally take the role of 007 in Goldeneye.\n\nIt was also the end for several members of cast and crew who’d been so integral to Bond, including director John Glen, screenwriter Richard Maibaum, titles designer Maurice Binder, M actor Robert Brown, and, of course, Cubby Broccoli.\n\nReleased in 1995, Goldeneye recast Bond as a “misogynist dinosaur” and questioned his place in the post-Cold War world. It was credited for reinventing Bond with a new style and attitude. But looking back at it with 24 years’ hindsight, Goldeneye feels and talks more like a classic Roger Moore. A new era for Bond but also somehow a step back.\n\nThe Dalton films – especially Licence to Kill – now seem like the natural precursor to the Daniel Craig era, without looking dour or po-faced as Craig’s tenure does occasionally. Dalton’s era was way ahead of its time, with a 007 believable as both an actor and cold-blooded killer.\n\n“I call Timothy Dalton the father of Daniel Craig,” says Robert Davi. “The years of Roger Moore were delicious. But to take Bond into the era when action films were hard and real… Timothy brought that intensity and darkness as an actor. Like Fleming said, Bond’s not necessarily a good guy. Timothy gave Bond that edge.”\n\nFor My Eyes Only by John Glen is available here"
