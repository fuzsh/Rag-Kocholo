Now for a few statistics:\n\nThe Living Daylights and You Only Live Twice tie for the most awards won in the Bondies- 3 each.\n\nA View to a Kill is the only movie with more than two awards in the Stacys - quite appropriate if you think about it.\n\nThe only five movies not to win any award are: Dr No, The Man with the Golden Gun, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy and Tomorrow Never Dies.\n\nIn comparison to the previous Bondies, the results are much less straightforward. Last time, From Russia with Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service took 5 and 4 Bondie awards respectively, while A View to a Kill and Die Another Day won 4 and 2 'Bond Razzies' respectively.\n\nOverall:\n\nFrom Russia with Love - 1 award\n\nGoldfinger - 1 award\n\nThunderball - 1 award\n\nCasino Royale - 1 award\n\nYou Only Live Twice - 3 awards\n\nOn Her Majesty's Secret Service - 1 award\n\nDiamonds Are Forever - 1 award\n\nLive and Let Die - 1 award\n\nThe Spy who Loved Me - 2 awards\n\nMoonraker - 2 awards\n\nA View to a Kill - 2 awards\n\nThe Living Daylights - 3 awards\n\nLicence to Kill - 1 award\n\nGoldenEye - 1 award\n\nThe World is Not Enough - 1 award\n\nDie Another Day - 1 award\n\nThe second ever Bondies since they began in 2002(?) was, in my view, a great success. Once we got the laborious process of nominating out of the way, the voting commenced, leading to many surprising results- but that can only be a welcome thing when the fans, rather than the so-called experts, are given the responsibility to award excellence.\n\nFeel free to post your thoughts on the winners. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on all aspects of the competition.\n\nFinally, my thanks to everyone who took part in nominating and voting in the Bondies. My particular thanks to Pat (Poonraker) who kindly advertised the Bondie threads during his SlugFest.\n\nWill the Bondies return? Erm. Yes."
