        "text": "There is little evidence to point in either direction. For Brown's first appearance in Octopussy there is no dialogue to indicate a new M and it is all business as usual. This fits with the press material for the film which apparently stated that Brown was intended to be the same character as Lee. There appears to be some useful evidence when Brown's M is referred to as \"Admiral\" by General Gogol in A View to a Kill. Unfortunately, since both Messervy and Hargreaves were Admirals this evidence isn't particularly conclusive! As a final point on this issue, it is worth noting that in the literary continuity of the novels penned by John Gardner and Raymond Benson, it is made clear that it is Miles Messervy who is replaced by a female M.\n\nSource:\n\nThen again, maybe Robert Brown's \"M\" is neither Hargreaves nor Messervy. Why does it have to be one or the other? No one ever said that it had to be one or the other. Perhaps he was playing an entirely new character, Admiral Winston Horatio Sidebottom as \"M\". Or maybe, just maybe, he's playing a different character as M in each of his 4 \"M\" films. Messery in OP, Hargreaves in AVTAK, Sidebottom in TLD and another M in LTK. There could have been 2, 3 or 4 different characters as \"M\" all played by Robert Brown. Charles Grey played 2 characters, Maud Adams played 2 characters, Joe Don baker played 2 characters. Maybe Robert Brown played 4 characters, or maybe even 5 if Hargreaves was never \"M\".\n\nActually, if you play the third track on the vinyl soundtrack album of OCTOPUSSY backwards while playing the DVD of THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS from 15 minutes, 3 seconds to 15 minutes, 8 seconds and reading the last line of the fourth chapter of \"For Special Services\", while someone recites Kipling's \"If\" in the background, clues fall into place revealing clearly the fact that Brown's M is one Admiral Leon \"Shorty\" Mendelsohn. I'm told that the character has quite an interesting backstory, but apparently only Raymond Benson and one other person know what it is, and they never travel on the same plane.\n\nI'm just saying that Robert Brown being Admiral Hargreaves is as stupid as saying that Morzeny was promoted to Gogol just because the same actor was in two different Bond films.\n\nAnd the idea that Brown is Hargreaves just because Messervy was a former admiral is nonsense for me.\n\nI've never read those interviews of Michael Wilson but I don't think at all that Brown is a promoted Heargraves.\n\nBernard Lee died and they tried to find another actor to be Messervy.\n\nOtherwise we would have had informations very CLEAR about that.\n\nAnd we would have learn it by some dialogues. Brown talking about the former M or anything like that. Like Bernard Fox talking about the former M or Judy Dench.\n\nM is called M because his aka is taken from the first letter of his last name M-- Messervy\n\nAs Judy Dench plays M and her name is Barbara Mawdsley. M---Mawdsley.\n\nIf Robert Brown would habe been pomoted to the chief of MI6 he would have beeN called \"H\" and not M.\n\nIn The facts of death, Bond goes to a party organised by the former M (Sir Miles Messervy). And Admiral Hargreaves is present too. As an Admiral not a former H.\n\nWhy do we presume that the M designation comes from an initial of Sir Miles Messervy's name? Why not have it be a joke on the real-life C designation of the British Secret Service and have it come from the first name of Sir Mansfield Smith-\n\nI'm just saying that Robert Brown being Admiral Hargreaves is as stupid as saying that Morzeny was promoted to Gogol just because the same actor was in two different Bond films.\n\nAnd the idea that Brown is Hargreaves just because Messervy was a former admiral is nonsense for me.\n\nI've never read those interviews of Michael Wilson but I don't think at all that Brown is a promoted Heargraves.\n\nBernard Lee died and they tried to find another actor to be Messervy.\n\nOtherwise we would have had informations very CLEAR about that.\n\nAnd we would have learn it by some dialogues.

In the real British Secret Service the Head is named \"C\" regardless of what the persons name is. Where is the C in Stella Rimmington....Hmmm, I don't see one, but then maybe you do? Yet she was still referred to as \"C\""
