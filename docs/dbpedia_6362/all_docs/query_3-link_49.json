A low flat rate for the rest of the world.\n\nSize: 69 cm x 104 cm (27 in x 41 in)\n\nA guaranteed original teaser one sheet movie poster from 1989 for John Glen's James Bond movie, \"Licence to Kill\" (or depending upon your location \"License to Kill\").\n\nThe sixteenth of the Bond films and Timothy Dalton's second outing as 007, the movie also features Robert Davi as a powerful drug baron and Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto as female co-stars.\n\nIt was originally entitled \"Licence Revoked\", but was renamed after feedback to test screenings in the U.S.\n\nThe only Bond film to be classified as a '15', footage had to be cut to enable a general release. Once it hit the big screen, the film took over $150M at the box office.\n\nThis fantastic poster showing Bond ready for action is in superb condition and will look amazing framed and on the wall of any Bond fan!\n\nWe only sell guaranteed original movie posters. We do not sell reproductions."
