        "text": "Relentless, ruthless and rarely stopping to savor a martini, an implacable James Bond takes his license to kill literally in ''Licence to Kill,'' the 16th in the series of Bond movies produced by Albert (Cubby) Broccoli. That the barrel of this James Bond's Walther PPK is seldom cold is no accident. The 27-year-old series is adapting to 1989 newspaper headlines as well as to Timothy Dalton in the leading role. Whereas Mr. Dalton simply stepped into the finished script of the 1987 movie ''The Living Daylights,'' ''Licence to Kill,'' opening Friday, has been tailored to fit him.\n\nOver nearly three decades, James Bond has become a cottage industry for the Broccoli family, with one action-adventure souffle popping out of the oven every two years. Mr. Broccoli's stepson Michael Wilson has co-written the movies since ''For Your Eyes Only'' in 1981 and is now co-producer. His daughter Barbara became associate producer with ''The Living Daylights.'' His daughter Tina was a set decorator on ''Licence to Kill,'' while his skin-diving son Tony was a location manager for the underwater unit.\n\nNor has the 80-year-old Mr. Broccoli abdicated. ''Cubby is trying to pull back,'' says Saul Cooper, vice president of marketing for Mr. Broccoli's Warfield Productions, ''but he stands behind his desk skimming the headlines and photographs on every page of six English newspapers day after day. He believes in keeping the material contemporary.''\n\n''Torn straight from the headlines of today's newspapers,'' according to a United Artists press kit, ''Licence to Kill'' has replaced the usual madman villain who is intent on destroying civilization-as-we-know-it with a more contemporary bad guy - a dope dealer.\n\n''But the drug peddling is on the scale of Noriega rather than 'Miami Vice,' '' says Mr. Wilson.\n\nTo make sure the connection with the Panamanian dictator is not missed, the drug lord's home base is a fictional Isthmus City.\n\nMr. Dalton is the fourth actor to play the British secret agent 007 created by the novelist Ian Fleming. Sean Connery originated the role of a sardonic and ruthless spy and has played it in seven movies. In ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service,'' George Lazenby did a Connery imitation and failed to make audiences forget the original. Roger Moore, who also played the role in seven films, was clever enough not to try to catch Mr. Connery's blend of irony, sophistication and brutality. His immaculate, unruffled James Bond was more superhero than superagent. (''Casino Royale,'' the one novel not owned by Mr. Broccoli and his partner, Harry Saltzman, was turned into a bizarre spoof that included multiple James Bonds.) 'Realistic' may be an odd word to apply to a character who uses a mod white parachute in order to drop in at a wedding and who waterskis behind an airplane, but the co-writers of ''Licence to Kill'' use it to describe the essence of Timothy Dalton's Bond.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
