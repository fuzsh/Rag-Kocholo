        "text": "Another find from the magazine archives...\n\nRichard Maibaum: Veteran Screenwriter for a Brand-New Bond\n\nThe man who penned 11 movie missions for three different superspies tackles his most dangerous assignment, dispatching Timothy Dalton into 007 action with “The Living Daylights.”\n\nBy Lee Goldberg and Edward Gross (Starlog 120, July 1987)\n\nThere have been 14 James Bond movies, so is a “new” one really new?\n\nFor the 15th adventure, The Living Daylights, there’s a new James Bond in Timothy Dalton, a new Miss Moneypenny in Caroline Bliss, and a relatively new M in Robert Brown (who debuted in 1983’s Octopussy).\n\nAnd there's a new angle to selling 007. Last time, with A View to a Kill, the emphasis was on the thrills, with “adventure above and beyond all other Bonds.” Now, the attention is back on the agent himself, “the Most Dangerous Bond Ever.” It’s reflective of an obvious change in Bonds—from Roger Moore to Timothy Dalton—and a change in approach.\n\n“I’ve been feeling for some time that we’ve been getting a little too far out,” says Richard Maibaum, who co-wrote The Living Daylights with the film’s co-producer, Michael G. Wilson. “I happen to think that Timothy Dalton gives us a new lease on life. We can go back to the more realistic espionage stories rather than the far-out fantasy tales.”\n\nMaibaum, 77, has been penning Bond adventures, both outlandish and realistic, since the series began with Dr. No in 1962. “I think the films have given Bond more humor,” he observes. “Bond was pretty humorless in the books, and the dimension of humor that we put there was, I thought, very helpful to the pictures.”\n\nIn all, Maibaum has written or co-written 12 James Bond movies, the last three with Wilson, the stepson of 007 producer Albert R. “Cubby” Broccoli. This isn't the first time the filmmakers have tried to recapture the harder-edged Bond, played by Sean Connery, that made 007 what Maibaum calls “a part of the public consciousness.” The most obvious attempt was with For Your Eyes Only, a film in which Maibaum believes they largely succeeded.\n\nBut it’s not that the movies have been written any differently, Maibaum says, it’s just that the actors playing Bond—Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore and now, Timothy Dalton—have “colored the role with their own personalities.”\n\nLicense Renewed\n\nThe Living Daylights was written with no particular actor in mind, “just the James Bond character we all know.” Moore has often said he would quit, only to sign on again for more money. This time, though, it wasn’t a ploy.\n\nMaibaum and Wilson were still hammering out the script while casting was being discussed, detailed and determined. Who would be the next 007—would it be Ian Christenson? Sam Neill? Tom Selleck? Mel Gibson? Bryan Brown? They finally settled on Pierce Brosnan, NBC’s Remington Steele. When Brosnan couldn’t get out of his TV series commitment, the producers opted for Dalton, a \"classical actor\" whom they had been considering since For Your Eyes Only.\n\n(They also recast Miss Moneypenny, a role played since Dr. No by Lois Maxwell. “We thought the best time to do it was when we got a new Bond,” says Maibaum. “I hate to see her go, because I loved her, she was great. I don’t know what the audience reaction will be to a new Moneypenny. I think they won't mind. After all, it has been 25 years. Lois Maxwell is still a beautiful woman, but now she isn't the hep chick that Moneypenny could and probably should be.”)\n\n“I guess Pierce Brosnan would have been more like Roger,” says Maibaum. “But we really didn’t make any changes for Roger, either. It’s just that he saw Bond in a more humorous fashion than Sean did and was very successful at it, as the box office shows.”\n\nDalton has taken the role “more seriously,” and isn't hampered in that effort by the megalomaniac supervillains and imminent, outlandish, global disasters which have characterized so many Bond films.\n\n“Some of the more fantastical elements that have been in the pictures lately are not in this one,” Maibaum announces. “As a matter of fact, it’s a more realistic story. The whole mood is more realistic.”\n\nAt first, the filmmakers toyed with abandoning the series and starting from scratch, with 007’s first adventure. Maibaum and Wilson even wrote a full-fledged treatment.\n\n“We had some very good things in it,” Maibaum says. “But Cubby felt the audience doesn’t pay to see James Bond as an amateur. Naturally, if you tell that story, you have to show him making mistakes and how he learned his trade. It cuts out too many of the things the audience enjoys watching Bond do.”\n\nSo, they tossed out the treatment and went back to the Ian Fleming short story “The Living Daylights” for inspiration.\n\n“Bond is sent to Germany to cover the escape of a defector from East to West,” says Maibaum, detailing the Fleming yarn’s storyline. “While he is staked out there, he sees through his rifle sights, a bus full of girl musicians arrive in East Germany and go into a conservatory to rehearse.”\n\nOne of the women is a KGB assassin. Rather than kill her, Bond shoots the gun from her hands. “That’s very Bondian,” the writer explains. “He won’t kill a beautiful woman for no reason at all. Also, he likes beautiful girls.”\n\nThe story proved a “good springboard” but then Maibaum and Wilson were faced with “how to make a two-hour movie out of this story. We had to ask ourselves, ‘Who is the defector? Is he really a defector or is he coming to be a double agent? What is he up to? Who is the woman? Why was she there? Was she really going to kill him?’ And one thing led to another and finally, the movie’s story began to evolve.\n\n“There is a greater sense of reality involved in what's happening this time,” Maibaum notes. “It’s easier, I think, for the audience to identify with. You can have all the magnificent action in the world, but if you don't care about the people involved with the action, then something is lost. The Living Daylights is an opportunity to see that Bond is not a thoughtless killer, who they push a button on and he’ll go out and kill somebody. So, this is one picture where a man wants to be convinced before the man he is assigned to kill is killed. It was a departure for us, as James Bond would be trying to avoid assassinating someone before he has damn good reason to do so.”\n\nAll Maibaum will say about the rest of the plot—he’s worried about giving too much away—is that “the fellow who defects is a high KGB official who has a scheme about selling hi-tech arms, which is really a cover for what he really wants to do with the money.”\n\nIf that sounds like some of the covert shenanigans going on at the White House these days, the similarity is unintentional—but nice nonetheless.\n\n“We started to do it and found that real events were overtaking us,” Maibaum explains.\n\n“The whole thing suddenly exploded on the front pages with Irangate and we found ourselves with a very hot scenario. Most people, of course, will think we decided on the story after the fact.”\n\nMaibaum is amused by the repeated references to James Bond in the reporting of “Irangate,” once again proving how much 007 has become a lasting part of American pop culture.\n\n“When Senator Paul Laxalt was asked on Nightline if he thought President Ronald Reagan knew about this whole business, Laxalt said, ‘I doubt if he would have anything to do with a James Bond caper like this,” Maibaum notes.\n\nFor Special Services\n\nComing up with the capers is the hardest part of writing a James Bond script. “It’s murder,” Maibaum confesses. “But once you’ve got the caper, you’re off to the races and the rest is fun.”\n\nHe calls his writing with Wilson a “close, fruitful collaboration. When we start out, we do a very full treatment, sometimes 50 or 60 pages long. This is, I think, the 21st film I’ve done with Cubby, and he likes to know beforehand what's going to be. We lay it out very carefully and very thoroughly in scripting. Sometimes, we sit there and write together. Sometimes, Michael will write the first draft or I will write the first draft, and we give it to the other fellow and argue about it. There’s an awful lot of arguing that goes on. But, you know what they say, if collaborators don’t argue, then there’s one collaborator too many.”\n\nMaibaum likes to write in longhand, and then type his material up later, while partner Wilson prefers to work on a word processor. And although Maibaum has more screen writing experience—experience that dates back to movies like 1949’s The Great Gatsby—Wilson has “lots of good ideas. He’s a versatile, accomplished man. He’s a lawyer, engineer, businessman, writer and all in all, a solid contributor.”\n\nWilson is also, along with sister Barbara Broccoli, heir apparent to the James Bond series when, or if, Albert R. “Cubby” Broccoli ever bows out. Although Wilson has worked on five films, and “learned so much from Cubby and those around him,” Maibaum still “hates to think” about what would happen without Broccoli.\n\n“Actually, someone once said that the Bond pictures are not written or acted, they are produced,” explains Maibaum. “The most important aspect in the success of the Bonds is the superb way they have been produced. That doesn't minimize the contributions that other people make. But it has been Cubby’s great combination of showmanship, good taste, plain courage, bullheadedness and personality that kept it all together.”\n\nAlthough Broccoli was presented with the Irving G. Thalberg Award (in 1982) from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his contributions to the movie business, and has received many honors over the years, Maibaum believes “Cubby is still not given the credit that he deserves.\n\n“Can you imagine the strength he must have to persevere through all the ups and downs and difficulties to keep this series going? And at the level of excellence he has maintained?” Maibaum adds. “It really is amazing. I can't think of another instance of it in motion picture history.”\n\nProbably because there isn’t. The Bond films have endured for 25 years, becoming the most successful and long-lasting theatrical series in history, with no end in sight.\n\n“I think the films have had a good run because they’re good films,” Maibaum says. “The audience knows they’re going to get a good show, they won’t be shortchanged.\n\n“And the James Bond syndrome, of course, has been worldwide. Bond is in the Sherlock Holmes class now. Hardly a day goes by where I don’t see three or four references to James Bond in some way—newspapers, television and so forth. People talk about it. The whole James Bond syndrome has become a part of the culture, and that has a great deal to do with the movies’ success.”\n\nWith Ian Fleming titles just about gone (a few short stories remain), Maibaum says Broccoli has bought the rights to the John Gardner 007 novels, which provide fresh titles if not fertile new ground for stories.\n\nAnd the fact that the 007 series has survived three actors now—the verdict won’t be in for a while on Dalton—shows that Bond could “go on forever.”\n\n“Audiences will want to see more of James Bond,” Richard Maibaum says. “That is, if we continue to make the pictures as well as they have been made in the past.”\n\nLicensed to Thrill\n\nEven after 12 missions with 007, Richard Maibaum is still proud to back up Bond\n\nBy Edward Gross (Starlog Yearbook #5, 1989)\n\nIn Licence to Kill, James Bond is on a personal vendetta, and so, it could be argued, is screenwriter Richard Maibaum, whose intent has been to offer a different type of Bond for the 1990s; a Bond more akin to the early Sean Connery thrillers of the ’60s than the Roger Moore escapades of later years.\n\n“This particular script is a little different,\" explains Maibaum, who has helped write 12 Bond film adventures. “It is less fantastical and far out in theme and caper. It's more realistic, deals with a very important subject and very well suits Timothy Dalton’s capacity to be real and actual, not cute and arch. As a matter of fact, I like Timothy very much. He brings a great reality to the situation. I also think that this is a good kind of shifting of gears into a more realistic, more believable course of action.\n\n“This was a deliberate attempt to tackle a more serious problem,” Maibaum adds, “and by doing so, you cannot take the same airy approach to it that you have in other Bonds, where you have, let’s say, things like breaking into Fort Knox, which is pure fantasy. It was clearly in everybody’s mind that this time, we wanted something dark and something more serious, because we're dealing with a very serious and terrible evil in the world. We’ve been fortunate in that we have been neck and neck with history in many of our pictures, and here we’ve caught up with General Noriega, which I think is luck and will do the picture some good. The drug lord from Central America is the villain of the day. There’s no doubt about that, so why duck it? In The Living Daylights, for God sakes, we anticipated the Contra business of selling guns. We had that six months before it happened, but it was in the air—the kind of maverick secret agent who goes nuts on his own and embroils countries.\n\n“So, who was there to be the definitive villain of today but the drug lord? We wondered whether we should do it, because there have been other Bond movies that have dealt with drugs. In a peripheral way, The Living Daylights dealt with it too, but in that case, they were just using the drugs to buy weapons. This time, we go into depth regarding the laundering of the money, the making of the drugs and the national organizations involved. It’s very interesting and very real. When it’s all said and done, however, it’s going to be director John Glen’s magnificent stunts and action that’s going to carry it.”\n\nVendettas to Go\n\nIn Licence to Kill, Maibaum’s drug lord is Franz Sanchez, perhaps one of the richest men in the world, who has made his fortune in the trade and will allow nothing to stand in his way, including Drug Enforcement Agent Felix Leiter. To prove this point, Sanchez murders Leiter’s newlywed wife, and feeds the former CIA agent to the sharks, although Leiter does survive.\n\n“These events are so terrible,” says Maibaum, “that Bond, for the first time follows out a strictly personal vendetta...well, not for the first time, because in Goldfinger, the girl was painted gold which gave him that certain added drive. But this thing, having happened to Leiter and his wife, is so close and so personal to Bond, that it gives you a great engine to send the story straight through as Bond follows this guy. Sanchez is an absolute monster in a very sophisticated and clever way, and I must give Robert Davi credit for that. He’s one of the best villains we’ve had, and the amazing thing is that he has this tremendous capacity to project evil, while at the same time you want to kick yourself because you like him for his occasional charm. It’s a very, very skillful job, and I think Davi does it magnificently.\n\n“Anyway,” the writer puts himself back on track, “the film really deals with the business of license to kill. In the film, Bond’s license to kill is revoked. In fact we first called the film License Revoked, which was a nice, literary title, but they decided that most people wouldn't know what ‘revoked’ means. After all, the concept of license to kill has prevailed all these years. It has a special significance that it really didn’t have when we started. Killing is out just the way that alley-catting around is out, and you must be more circumspect. Yet if Bond’s license to kill has ever been justified, it’s this time, but he’s forbidden by M to exercise it. That’s an interesting idea.”\n\nAnd to a large degree, Maibaum, who previously discussed his tenure as a 007 scenarist in Starlog #68 & #120, thinks the film works. He believes it manages to touch upon the tone of such earlier fare as From Russia With Love and On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, thanks, largely, to Timothy Dalton’s portrayal of Bond. “I was really stunned by the picture in that I was very pleasantly surprised by many aspects of it,” observes Maibaum. “I especially thought that Timothy carne alive more, and his being such a good all-around actor—a true Shakespearean actor—allowed him to handle the business of James Bond’s grief at his friend’s wife’s death. He made that believable for me, and somehow was much more sympathetic and human than he had been in the last film. While Timothy doesn’t have the inherent irony and sardonic quality that was bred into the Scotch bone of Sean Connery, he has an effectiveness as an actor so that he makes real, more than any of them I think, what is happening on the screen. That’s something we needed very much.\n\n“Dear old Roger Moore was very good as Bond in his own way and the way he did it, and his pictures were most successful financially. But I’m glad he wasn’t playing the part this time, because he couldn’t have done it. He couldn’t have projected the real grief and horror that Bond felt when he walked in there and saw the girl’s body. Roger’s very good with the light stuff and the flip stuff, but the serious stuff you just didn’t believe. They say when an actor laughs, the audience doesn’t. It got to be a little bit too cute for my money, but I guess the public didn't agree with me.”\n\nActors to Change\n\nMaibaum, as a writer who has been involved with the Bond films since 1962’s Dr. No, is equally at ease singing the praises for the various films as he is pointing a critical finger at them. He reflects on the evolution of the series as one Bond actor gave way to yet another.\n\n“Roger was such a change from Sean, and the audience loved Sean so much that it made it more difficult for Roger,” Maibaum explains. “I have to admit that Man With the Golden Gun, in particular, was a weak film. What happens is that they get on the set and try things which seem like a good idea at the time, but they don’t consider that the writer has been breaking his head for six months trying to think of things. On a moment’s notice, they come up with something that’s not that great. Sometimes it does work, but very rarely.\n\n“It’s what the stars want,” Maibaum laughs, “and I think Jimmy Goldman is the one who said, ‘What is a star? A star is a person that no one ever contradicts.’ I wish the day would come in the far utopian land that we’ll live in some day, that the writer is the one that no one ever contradicts. I did think that Roger was getting better, but (by A View to a Kill) the audience was feeling that he was getting a little long in the tooth for a guy who the bobby-soxers were expected to drool about. I think he was ready to call it quits, too. I love Roger. He’s a very delightful and witty outgoing person. He really is, but I think if the series was going to continue, it did need an infusion of the kind of thing that Dalton is doing.”\n\nWhile the past few Bond films, beginning with 1981’s For Your Eyes Only, have proclaimed that they were moving back in style towards the more serious Connery-type adventures, it wasn't until 1987’s The Living Daylights, and the introduction of Timothy Dalton, that a genuine attempt to do so became apparent.\n\n“I like The Living Daylights very much,” says Maibaum, “and I like some of the performances. We did have some criticisms that although it was smooth and so forth, the villains weren’t up to scratch and they weren’t. They weren’t evil enough. I like John Rhys-Davies very much. I thought he was great. I also thought Maryam d’Abo was a little colorless. She was sympathetic and gentle; and Bond was properly protective of her, but no one has ever come, in the protective aspect, up to James Bond and Honeychile Rider in Dr. No. He was simply great as far as that was concerned.”\n\nMaibaum also, has fond memories of Diana Rigg, who co-starred with Bond number two, George Lazenby, in 1969’s On Her Majesty's Secret Service, although he feels Rigg was “lumbered” by the newcomer.\n\n“But she is a magnificent actress,” he points out, “and she almost helped Lazenby to pull it off. I thought she was superb. So was Honor Blackman in Goldfinger. My favorite, however, was Carole Bouquet in For Your Eyes Only. She’s so beautiful. The next one is Daniela Bianchi in From Russia With Love. What a beautiful girl!”\n\nWhile he holds From Russia With Love and Goldfinger in high esteem, it is On Her Majesty’s Secret Service that fans mention to him most frequently. It’s one of the scripts of which he’s most proud.\n\n“First of all,” Maibaum details, “it was the best of Ian Fleming’s novels. It was more of a novel than any of them. In the second place, it had a beginning, a middle and an end, and yet it had a wonderful relationship between Bond, the girl and her father. The whole damn thing was so interesting. I’m proud of several of the scripts I’ve written for the films, and this is one of them. My only problem with the film is that I don't think Telly Savalas was very good as Blofeld. He should have had an accent or something, but I couldn’t convince Peter Hunt to get him to use one. I had the same problem with Christopher Lee in Man With the Golden Gun. That was a real fight, because I thought the character in the novel was very unusual. But it was all lost. Lee wanted to play it like a spoiled Guard’s Officer. In other words, he was trying to outdo Bond, and it couldn’t be done.”\n\nLicenses to Kill\n\nMoving the subject back to the latest Bond extravaganza, Maibaum is willing to discuss his likes and dislikes concerning the film, now that he has seen a finished print of Licence to Kill.\n\n“I don’t like to be critical of producers Cubby [Broccoli] and Michael Wilson,” he prefaces. “Let me say this, I think this is a tremendous job of production. Can you imagine putting it all together in Mexico of all places? I don’t like in any way to deprecate their efforts. I also think that there’s no doubt that John Glen is the premier action director in the world today. He is absolutely fantastic. Everyone does a car chase, but there's always something different and unexpected in his action sequences. He’s really a genius in that way. He also has the capability of evoking believable performances from his people.\n\n“Frankly,” Maibaum continues, “one thing the picture suffers from is that for one reason or another we've had so many actors playing Felix Leiter. There have been six of them. David Hedison is repeating from Live and Let Die, but it isn't enough. The audience had sort of forgotten him. In Licence to Kill, you didn’t get the feeling that there had been this close life and death relationship between Bond and Leiter. Somehow it didn’t come over, but it was our intention that it should. I asked myself about it, and I have to attribute it to the fact that there have been so many different actors, which is particularly detrimental to this story in which Bond’s concern for Leiter and his desire for revenge is such an important part of the plot. It would have been better if there had not been so many Leiters, and if the audience had started out the picture with a very strong recall of the great camaraderie between Bond and Leiter, hooking it up with a face and a personality. I do think that Dalton is so good that he is able to compensate somewhat.\n\n“I was pleasantly surprised by the girls, particularly Carey Lowell. She’s going to go places. Most of the Bond Girls didn’t go much further than the Bond film, but I think she has a very good chance. The other girl, Talisa Soto, was so daffy that she was more amusing than anything. I also thought Q’s involvement was marvelous, and the audience seemed happy to see him and recognize that old friend. This time, Desmond Llewellyn had something to do, although I wish we had given him a few more good lines at the end.”\n\nDespite the fact he has some problems with the sequence, Maibaum believes that the audience has also taken to Wayne Newton as a TV evangelist who works for the Sanchez organization via his coded meditation broadcasts.\n\n“The audience laughed and seemed to like him,” Maibaum muses. “Personally, I didn’t feel that the meditation center came off clearly enough as to what exactly its function was, but once you get there, the action is so exciting, that you don’t care. We had originally based it on plain, ordinary American evangelism, which is something you could grasp. As presented, it was pretty far out, but I think that Cubby and Michael thought the other way might have been too risky as far as adverse reaction from legitimate religious groups in the United States. But this scene is so far out and fantastic, that it doesn’t really go along with the darker, realistic mood of the rest.”\n\nThe film's action, as Maibaum notes, is quite outrageous and wonderful, particularly the sequence involving several massive Kenworth Trucks, which have the capability of popping “wheelies” and driving sideways on two wheels.\n\n“That has never been done before,” proclaims the writer gleefully. “I personally think the sequence was a little too long with too many explosions, but what happens is that they shoot it and the material is so good that they don’t want to cut it. There’s one thing I always keep telling them when we write it and make it: less is more. It's still something I can't convince them about.”\n\nDespite any criticisms he may have, Maibaum is quick to note that the audience often proves him wrong as they make each successive film in the series a box office hit. “One thing about the Bonds is that you never know what to expect until you’ve seen them in front of a packed audience, 25 percent of which is kids,” he says. “Then, you get the whole effect. You get the people who talk back to the screen, those who laugh and those who shout. It's really amazing to see a Bond picture in front of that kind of audience, and I'm continually surprised by the reaction.”\n\nWhich leads Maibaum to ponder the changes in writing the Bond films between 1962 and today.\n\n“I think it has been altered to a certain extent by the alteration in action-adventure pictures themselves,” he observes. “In other words, the first one was in 1962 and you could be more leisurely. You could have more dialogue scenes, and by that happening, you had an opportunity to project a fuller characterization of the people. That has slowly begun to tail off, because the action demands that you must move so fast that you haven’t got time for leisurely characterization. It’s something I regret, because the only way you can forge a characterization is by dialogue and give and take. There’s no time for it today, and I think that has gradually happened over the years to all action pictures.”\n\nDespite these changes, Maibaum is confident that Bond will continue for many years to come. He isn’t as certain about his own involvement.\n\n“I don’t even know if they’ll ask me to do another one,” Richard Maibaum smiles. “I always wait, and one day Cubby calls me up and says, ‘Well, do you want to do another one?’ And I say, ‘Yes.’ So, in the back of my head, I’ve got several ideas...\n\n“Well, I’m not going to tell you about them.”"
