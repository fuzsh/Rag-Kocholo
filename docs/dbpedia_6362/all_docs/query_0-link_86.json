He easily might have. He wrote many plays while a student in speech and dramatic arts at the University of Iowa in the late 1920s. One of them, The Tree, was produced on Broadway while he was still a student. Two of his plays subsequently became Hollywood films while eleven of his plays were produced or published. Four of them were produced on Broadway in the 1930s and in one multiple production by the Works Progress Administration or the WPA Federal Theatre Project. In 1935, he went to Hollywood and commenced a career as a screenwriter/producer, and writer of television properties—a career that he was still actively pursuing at the time of his passing at the beginning of 1991. Along the way, he interacted with many students and colleagues who often sought his artistic opinion. He was always pleased to see younger talent enter the field and succeed and see contemporaries do well. Absorbed with his writing for stage and screen, he did not have time to write his ideas about creative writing. However, he was often invited to speak about his work and the writing process at universities and various organizations. He was born in the Bronx, New York City, on May 26, 1909. After attending New York City public schools, notably Evander Childs High School (where he met his future wife Sylvia Kamion), he attended New York University, University Heights campus on a scholarship. After a year and a half there, he left and resumed his studies in the Midwest at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, a school well-known as a demanding, challenging, spirited, innovative school in the areas of his interest. He majored in speech and dramatic art and minored in English, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. The Tree, which he wrote at college, won the interest of a Broadway producer and was produced on Broadway while he was still an undergraduate. He continued on at Iowa receiving the master of arts degree in 1932, during which he continued writing plays while pursuing his other mandated classwork. The Tree was the first anti-lynching play to appear on Broadway. Another play, Singing Acres, dealt with the terrible problems faced by Midwest farmers during the Depression. Meeting a group of German Jewish refugees in London in 1933, he was inspired to write, Birthrights A Play of the Nazi Regime. It was the first anti-Nazi play produced on Broadway. The use of the pen to shake peoples’ consciences and inspire others to a new understanding of problems and issues of the time was a motivating interest of his. All during his schooling, he also developed his talent as an actor. He played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice at age sixteen, the title role of The Hairy Ape, and many other parts at the university and had experience in summer little theaters in New England. After completing his studies at the University, he spent a year with a Broadway Shakespearean repertory company directed by B. Aiden Payne. He played seventeen different roles. And at twenty-two, he was the youngest Iago ever to appear on Broadway! Some of his plays were in a lighter, humorous vein. Later in the thirties, he poked fun at the dealings of attorneys during the Depression (See My Lawyer), and the insurance business (Sweet Mystery of Life). Many years later, he was to reflect, “Time has changed, but it seems that the behavior of people today is not that much different in these areas than when I first wrote about them.” After the Broadway production of Sweet Mystery of Life, he was brought to Hollywood by Metro-GoldwynMayer or MGM and pursued what was to become a rarely paralleled career of fifty-five years writing and producing films. Ultimately, he was credited with writing, producing, and both writing and producing or cowriting sixty films. He worked in Hollywood until World War II when he was immediately commissioned a captain. He spent four and a half years in the Army attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. In his work with the United States Army, signal corp combat films division, Richard Maibaum assembled and organized information films for the public, films for military personnel, and histories of the war. One series of seven-hour-long films dealing with the war produced by his division was entitled, Why We Fight and featured respectively segments that dealt with “the prelude to war,” the initial Nazi successes, the progression of Axis alliances and Allied initial efforts, the Battle of Britain, the battles in Russia, the war in China, and American’s entry into the War. Other efforts resulted in a “know your enemy” series. Some of the material collected by the division during the War was used to produce series seen many years after the end of the War, by the public, chiefly on televisions like the Victory at Sea series and Battle Line. He made some documentaries in the service, such as Appointment in Tokyo and The Liberation of Rome,¹ and a documentary called Twenty-Seven Soldiers, and one of the branches under him produced a five-hundred-reel comprehensive history in film of the War.² His work explored many different themes and backgrounds. They Gave Him a Gun in the 1930s was an antiwar film. The changing world situation later brought forth I Wanted Wings, a story about training for war! It was about the need for building air power in the months before America’s entry into the war. He was credited with the first major Westerns, large-production efforts in Hollywood. Prior to those, Western films had been small production, low-cost endeavors. Two of his major Westerns in the 1930s were Bad Man of Brimstone and Twenty Mule Team both of them starring Wallace Beery. Some of his films had historical backgrounds, such as Ten Gentlemen from West Point and The Day They Robbed the Bank of England. He was meticulous and thorough in his research for all his projects. Working in the new medium of television in the 1950s, he cowrote Fearful Decision, the teleplay version of his and Cyril Hume’s play, Ransom!, other teleplays, program episodes, and vignettes, some of the latter adapted from earlier short stage plays of his. Then came the Bond films commencing with Dr. No in 1962. He has credits\n\nof thirteen Bond films! His role in these pictures needs no elaboration here. He is credited with thirteen of these films. He was indeed an innovator as reflected in his work. Birthright was the first anti-Nazi play produced on Broadway. The film Bigger Than Life, with James Mason, was the first film dealing with medication abuse, and one of the first dealing with substance abuse. He wrote a play, less well remembered today, in the 1930s that was possibly the first play or other property to talk about what the United States would be like if run by a fascist, authoritarian government with a racist policy (Wanted and A Deluge). It came well before contemporary literary and television and film properties like Amerika, Fatherland, and the Philadelphia Experiment II. He wrote and produced one of the first films about the world of espionage, a predecessor of the spy film, O. S. S. (1946), starring Alan Ladd. And very early in his career, he wrote They Gave Him a Gun, a film about a demobilized World War I veteran who through perceived necessity gravitates into the world of organized crime. All along the way, he was always helpful to young writers and colleagues. Not primarily interested in being a teacher, he was invited to teach at the University of Iowa, however, for a year in the early 1950s. Again, a screenwriting assignment took him back to Hollywood. He interacted with and came to know scores of others interested in stage and film around the country who went on to pursue active careers in either medium. Enormously erudite, precise, and concise in how he described things and in how he wrote, he did extensive scholarly research on every project. Had he chosen alternatively to pursue an academic career he doubtlessly would have been the mentor and guide to students of film or theater. He did leave us, however, comments on his field of work. Over the years, he wrote articles for magazines, and gave lectures and speeches of a more academic orientation intended for the more selective university or university communities. And he was interviewed on various occasions. The copies and transcriptions of these have been collected and are presented here. The editors and compilers of this volume have collected his work here and faithfully reproduced it as it was, without adding or detracting anything. The only emendations to each piece of writing have been, in some cases, footnotes felt to be helpful to the reader about less well-known subjects and persons. These lectures, presentations, and interviews hopefully will convey to the reader and to students of theater arts and film pertinent, reflective and collective observations that he made about his work. They relate the distilled essence of what he found to be important in different areas of his work. Their major points should be useful to colleagues and students in the fields in which Richard Maibaum worked and to which he devoted his time and energies. And his Hollywood anecdotes will doubtlessly interest Hollywood moviegoers. His papers, research, plays, and filmscripts are preserved in the Special Collections Library of the University of Iowa. Copies of the filmscripts may also be found at the Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills. Copies of some of his television properties may be found in the Library of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (or ATAS) in Burbank, and copies of award-winning scripts may be found in the Library of the Writers Guild of America in Los Angeles. The interested student of the world of Hollywood and Broadway is encouraged to read Richard Maibaum’s screenplays and plays with an effort to analyze those components held to be so important in drama school and film school. But he or she should also consider and think about what Richard Maibaum says here. It has been said, “Make wisdom and knowledge that you possess survive after your time and you will continue to live, with it.” Richard Maibaum would want that for any student of his or of his work. He said on well more than one occasion, the most important thing perhaps a man can do is to show others how to do that which he can do. Finally, another statement that he himself would have fondly passed on to students and colleagues is an opinion from close to two thousand years ago, found in the Midrash, a commentary on the Bible, “Who shall bring redemption after all others have tried to and have failed? They who can make us laugh.” Sylvia Kamion Maibaum April 30, 1998 Los Angeles, California\n\nPart I\n\nGeneral Lectures, Presentations, and Essays\n\nOn Russian Drama (Invited Address, University of Iowa, 1947) A speech delivered by Richard Maibaum at the University of Iowa, Department of Speech and Theater Arts, March 1947. For some inexplicable reason, Professor MacGowan usually asks me to discuss Russian plays. Not being an expert on the subject, and having no particular qualifications outside being a professional screenwriterplaywright with a reasonably extensive knowledge of dramatic literature, I am forced to the conclusion that he always thinks of me for this assignment because he first knew me as an ardent youth who rarely got a haircut. Yes, I’m sure it’s the memory of my unusually long hair which somehow associates me in his mind with Chekhov, Gorki, Andreyev, Gogol, and Ostrovsky. Since those days I’ve discovered it isn’t necessary to look like a fella with a poetic soul in order to be one and visit my barber with reasonable regularity. But first impressions, they say, are the abiding ones, so I suppose that even if I someday grow as bald as Charles Boyer he’ll still hold my appearance in his mind’s eye as a somewhat stout version of the young Leon Trotsky. Please understand I’m speaking from a sartorial and not a political viewpoint. Although it’s hard to forget politics when you think about Gorki’s plays. They derive a great part of their effectiveness from the social background against which they were written. Indeed, it is my belief that without that background and kind of play Gorki invariably wrote could not have been successful from either a popular or artistic standpoint. His loose construction, his blunt and clumsy plot progression, his irrelevant dialogue digressions, all his other weaknesses, would be disastrous except for the great overall theme that seems to tie everything together—man’s inhumanity to man. That theme, or the Russian equivalent of it, was in his mind, his characters’ minds, and in the minds of the audience. There was a rapport between them before the curtain even went up. I think this was evidenced by the fact that almost all his plays were, except for a few notable exceptions, poorly received by the bourgeois press, and well received by the public with, again, a few exceptions. Officialdom, the discredited intelligentsia, entrenched and entrenching forces all hated Gorki’s plays. The people approved of them. Like the audiences of the old Greek plays they enjoyed the demonstration over and over again of a single great theme. With the Greeks it was man’s struggle against the fate the Gods had prepared for him. With Russian devotees of Gorki it was man’s struggle against the exploitation to which his Russian masters subjected him. “There is no true and just land,” says Luka. “But we must look for it anyway.” Just so the Greeks had said, “You can’t win against the Gods but you must keep on struggling.” (Events for a time made Russians think they could find or had found the true and just land. I wonder how many of them still think so today?) When you read or see a Gorki play you had better keep the background against which they were written in mind or you’re very likely to be disappointed. The only reason they still stand up at all is because of Gorki’s gift for characterization and his humor. And I think we have there the subject of this discussion. As writers and would-be writers of plays, what can we learn from Gorki’s plays, and especially from his masterpiece, The Lower Depths? I think it is this. If you have striking characters truthfully and effectively revealed your play can overcome great faults. If you haven’t got those characters you can’t possibly overcome even slight ones. One of Broadway’s current hits, I Am A Camera, is a good example of this. It is nothing but a series of loosely connected incidents but its characters are so well-delineated and so moving that the play overcomes what would ordinarily be considered faulty construction. I have a notion that I Am A Camera is indicative of a trend in playwriting. The three mediums—theater, movies, and TV—are more and more taking on a character of their own. In the theater, the most popular form is the musical. Next comes plays of great emotional intensity dealing with characters and themes censorable according to motion picture standards. It is the motion pictures that are presenting, for the most part, melodramas of scope which are well plotted. And in TV, outside the comedians, everything is crime and crime is nothing but plot. The pun is intended. Next time you watch the television go from station to station and, excepting forms of variety and quiz shows, just count the number of programs that are nothing but plot, plot, plot. The characters are usually all stock. The only thing of interest is the twisting and turnings of the story in order to achieve suspense and interest. Member of the Wedding was another example. Here was a play that had hardly any plot at all. It consisted almost entirely of an almost psychopathic emotion generated inside one character—a girl who wanted to accompany her brother and his bride on their honeymoon. Added to that was the relationship between a Negro servant girl, an adolescent girl, and a little boy. This trio and their affection for each other was written with such warmth, understanding, and beauty, that I, for one, came back after each act only for the pleasure of continuing to participate in it. I thought the main idea of the play was silly, but somehow the character relationships generated such satisfaction that it overcame all my other objections. Death of a Salesman really had very little plot in the conventional sense, but the characters generate such overpowering emotion it doesn’t matter. It would only get in the way. Mind you, I am not saying that a play which has both a good solid plot and excellent characterizations isn’t really more satisfying. Come Back, Little Sheba which I enjoyed as much as any play I’ve seen in years is a good example of such a play. A man living with a slatternly woman has been fighting alcoholism. He had given up medicine to marry her when she was young and lovely and become a vet. Disappointment in his career and in his wife urge him to drink, and he struggles against it manfully. A young girl boards with them, and reawakens in the man his sense of the beauty of life—then he discovers the girl is having an affair with a local muscle man and intends to marry her fiancé anyway. The blow sends the man into a raging drunk in which he comes home and tries to kill his wife with an axe. He is taken away to the hospital and his wife tries to go back to her folks but is turned down by them. She decides to “grow up,” as it were, and when the\n\nhusband comes out of the hospital he recognizes this and together they face the future, whatever it might bring. Here is a play that has both plot (a story) and wonderful characterizations. I was completely satisfied. In the Lower Depths what is the plot? I suppose you would have to say that Vassilissa, jilted by Pepel who is in love with her sister Natasha, pretends to accept the situation, and even offers Pepel money—if he will kill her husband. Luka, a pilgrim, overhears this, and tells Pepel to go away. Pepel and Luka convince Natasha to go with him, but Vassilissa overhears this (Ouch!) and with her husband pours scalding water on Natasha’s feet. A minor character objects and starts a fight with the husband and in the scuffling Pepel wallops the husband who falls and gets killed. Vassilissa accuses him and he in turn accuses her of egging him on to kill her husband. Natasha who is really a screwy character then refuses to believe that Pepel had rejected Vassilissa’s plan and disappears while Pepel and Vassilissa are taken to jail. Such is the plot. You can realize how disjointedly the play is constructed when you recall that there is no scene between Pepel and Vassilissa or Pepel and Natasha in the first act. Not one. And that neither Vassilissa, Pepel, Natasha and, naturally, the husband, appear in the last act. You wouldn’t think it possible that a play constructed like that could be effective! Woven around this main story are at least seven others, although you can’t really call them stories, or even subplots. There is the one about the key maker Klestch and his unloved wife, Anna, whose death desolates him; there is a Mohammedan stevedore who is going to lose his hand; a drunken actor who hopes to cure himself, falls off the wagon, and commits suicide; a romantic prostitute who keeps an impoverished nobleman; a kind of Greek chorus ex-murderer and cardsharper, Satin; a policeman who gets fired and marries a fat, wary widowed dumpling-maker; and Bubnov the tailor, or whatever he is, who saves up a little capital as he calls it and then drinks it all up. His wife had run away with his assistant. I think there are one or two more, including a kind of village idiot who goes around spreading gossip and lying down in the street daring people to run over him. All this is given unity by the location, the cellar, where they lodge, and the overall theme that all these people and their dislocated lives are the victims of an unfair social order. But what really holds all this together today? Nothing more or less than superb writing. These people are so original, funny, sad, so dumb, so wise, so stripped of all pretenses (except the prostitute), so good, so evil, above all so human, that they provide superb entertainment. Gorki was a great humorist. And that too is why he and almost he alone has been able to successfully write this kind of play against the background which we spoke of before. I don’t advise any but great writers and great humorists to attempt it. But I also want to point out again, the ability to depict wonderful characters in an entertaining and truthful way is probably the greatest asset a dramatist can have. Be mindful of plot construction, but be constantly aware that real characters make a play live, and nothing else. Concentrate on that. The Lower Depths is a splendid example of a play that breaks almost every rule of conventional playwriting and is still, in my opinion, a great play. All I know is that I enjoy it more every time I read it.\n\nThe Social Role of the Motion Picture (Invited Address at the University of California at Los Angeles, 1950) Speech delivered by Richard Maibaum at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), November 1950 I’m going to start this talk with a whopping half-truth…which I’ve found, by the way, is a pretty good average… When I was told that the subject matter I was to discuss was the Social Role of the Motion Picture a statement instantly occurred to me which I had heard at a heated meeting recently sponsored by the Johnson office in an effort “to raise the moral standards of the industry.” An excited and frustrated producer, who claimed he was being hampered in the creation of good entertainment by the Johnson office regulations, shouted, “Fellas, let’s face it! We’re selling blood, sex, and money! Without them we’re dead!” That’s the half-truth. We are selling blood, sex, and money, because they have always been the staples of entertainment…all the way from Sophocles to Shaw. What was half untrue about the statement was the way this particular producer wanted to sell those eternally attractive commodities? As a matter of fact, if he and people like him continue to sell blood, sex, and money in the way they have in the past they will be dead…stone-cold dead in the marketplace. But we’ll come back to that later. Obviously, the first and foremost function of the motion picture is to provide mass entertainment. A good show was, is, and always will be the best therapy to apply for the bruises of life—escape, catharsis, identification, release—call it what you will, it all comes down to a way to forget your troubles…and laugh and cry at somebody else’s. It’s a funny thing, though… That somebody else is really you…and so you’re actually laughing and crying at your own troubles and thus make them bearable. Which reminds me of a card we once received after a preview which said, “Best tragedy I ever saw. Laughed my head off.” Yes, the number one job of the motion picture is to entertain millions of people. Man does not live by bread alone…he needs the circus too…and the motion picture is a magical kind of dream circus where we’re both spectators and performers and all as pretty as Gable or Grable. Take your pick. Incidentally, it might be interesting for you to know that 60 percent of the people who go to the movies are under thirty years of age, and a majority of those are under twenty. Which would seem to indicate that a dark place to hold hands is at least as much a lure as the title of the film being shown. I often wonder whether the socalled Main Attraction exerts as potent a draw as the sideshow in the balcony. Indeed, one might say that going to the movies plays a much greater role socially than the pictures themselves. I think we can safely say that Young America lives most of its puppy love life in motion picture houses. And that’s a good thing too. After all, nothing very drastic can happen in a crowd…and munching popcorn at that. I firmly believe that the movies are here to stay until the Television people figure out a way of getting Mom and Pop and Aunt Agatha out of the living room. But seriously. I think the main social role of the motion picture is so clearly understood we don’t have to discuss it any further. I’m sure what was wanted today was consideration of the subsidiary social functions of films. So let’s consider them. I suppose others have told you that the powers that rule the industry are not interested in socially enlightening or culturally uplifting audiences. Again we have a half-truth. They are interested in those worthy objectives—if it is also profitable. I’m reminded of a certain important producer who reluctantly permitted the production of the movie The Story of Louis Pasteur. Paul Muni had set his heart upon playing it, but the idea was so novel, so untried, that the head of his studio had no way of measuring the possible success of such a picture. Hence, he was understandably hesitant about investing money in it. There had never been such a film before. What guarantee did he have that audiences would accept it? So a deal was made. Muni agreed to make a second film which the studio had great faith in and which he had previously turned down. I think it was Bordertown, but I’m not sure. So Pasteur went before the cameras. I’m sure you all know what it was about. One day at the rushes while the executives were looking at a close-up of a slide full of bacteria as seen through a microscope, the big boss could stand it no longer. He jumped out of his seat and shouted, “This is insanity! We’ll chase the audience right out of the theater! Boys and girls they want, and we’re giving them germs!” It goes without saying that the very same man forgot his dire predictions in the excitement and pleasure of being presented with an Oscar for having produced the Best Picture of the Year. So you see, by trial and error and accident and under pressure from creative actors, writers, and directors, the powers that be discovered that social enlightenment and cultural uplift could be profitable too. The reason we don’t have many pictures of the same quality as “Pasteur” is that they are difficult to make, just as any work of art is difficult to create. And not just works of art either. So many people in other businesses and professions ask me, “Why are movies so bad?” I invariably ask them. “Sir, what business are you in?” Let us assume the reply is, “The dress business.” I then ask them a simple question, “Why are most dresses so god-awful?” Or if he says, “I’m a doctor!” I ask him, “Why do so many people die?” Or if he’s a teacher, “Why are most lectures so dull and so many people with college degrees ignorant?”\n\nMost human activity is mediocre. To do anything well is unusual. Frankly, I think it perfectly amazing that some pictures are as good as they are, rather than that so many are as bad. The heads of studios want to make good pictures. It’s just difficult to do it. And that brings us to an important question. What criterion should we use in judging films? What motion pictures are socially valuable? Here’s a simple yardstick. Does this film enable a person to participate in a worthwhile experience? Now a sermon in a church is undoubtedly an enlightening discourse and listening to it should be eminently worthwhile, but I’m not talking about that kind of edification. I’m talking about worthwhileness in terms of the theatrical medium. And in a way in terms of all artistic media. Does watching this picture, or play, or hearing this symphony, or seeing this painting, or reading this novel, does it enrich my personality? Does it make me more understanding? Does it make me happier? Does it so engross me that the time I take to observe it is so full of enjoyment that I am not conscious of its passing? If the play or film is fashioned inexpertly I am prevented from participating in the experience it attempts to depict…or if it is well-fashioned the experience it asks me to share may not be worthwhile. I saw a film produced by Leni Riefenstahl glorifying Hitler and all his monstrous works. It was done superbly from a technical standpoint and yet any decent human being would reject participating in the experiences it unfolded. It was thus a bad film. And yet a silly little Mickey Mouse can give us true moments of lightheartedness and delight. That’s a good film. And this brings us to the question of responsibility…the responsibility of those who make films to the people for whom they make them. And this is responsibility in the sheerest social terns. Now we are really getting close to the heart of our subject. We all know the tremendous effect motion pictures have upon the tastes, habits, morals, of the public. I wrote a film called I Wanted Wings and a slim young unknown then named Constance Moore was cast as the bad girl. The Paramount hairdressing department came up with a brand new hairdo for her—a kind of rag mop motif that covered half her lovely face. The girl’s name was changed to Veronica Lake and a few weeks after the picture was released millions of girls were going to the beauty shops and asking for a sheepdog coiffure. Privately, I’ve often wondered how many girls were spattered with how many assorted fruits after the film in which Jimmy Cagney hit his ladylove in the face with a grapefruit. Alan Ladd once told me he has received as many as eighteen thousand fan letters a week. Think of it! The staggering influence exerted by how he looks and what he does on the screen. And I must say that Alan is aware of it and has certain taboos which he will not do on the screen because of the effect they might have on his following. Speaking very frankly there is much in our pictures that tends to vulgarize, to brutalize, and to distort, much that panders to low taste and cheap salaciousness. And I am not talking so much about those matters that the Legion of Decency objects to. I resent all pressure groups that attempt to censor the screen. Actually, most of the Bible could not be filmed as set down, and hardly a great piece of literature could be made into a film as written. This is wrong. Because it tends to create a special motion picture version of the world which simply isn’t true. Too often audiences find difficulty in participating in the experience depicted by a film because they instinctively sense this false perspective which distorts and offends taste and reason. I feel I must say something in behalf of the Johnson Office, however. Until a federal law which forbids the censorship of a film by local agencies the Johnson Office will serve a very practical purpose. It knows what will be cut out of a film in each specific locality and it forewarns the producer. In other words, you comply or have your film cut up into nonsensical tatters by bigots and bluenoses. “Make the cuts first,” says the Johnson Office. “And preserve an intelligible continuity.” What is not good about the Johnson Office is that it seems to make no real effort to mitigate these deplorable local censorship conditions. It merely helps you to cope with them instead of seeking to do away with them. You cannot show repentance without suffering in a film, suffering and punishment. A woman can be as adulterous as the screenwriter pleases just as long as she is run over by a truck at the end of the picture. Yet married people in their bedroom cannot be shown sharing a single bed. I don’t know the actual statistics on Mr. and Mrs. America’s sleeping arrangements but I’m reasonably sure not all of them use twin beds. Multiply these two examples many times and you will understand what I mean by the distortions caused by censorship pressure. I’ll only mention one glaring taboo. Divorce is never permitted to be shown as the solution for an unhappy marriage. All of us know perfectly well that most Americans who encounter marital difficulties solve them by divorce. I’m neither for or against divorce; all I know is that it exists as an American phenomenon and that phenomenon cannot be handled honestly in an American motion picture. If such a picture were made, it would be boycotted by the Legion of Decency and denied a seal by the Johnson office… As a result, it could only be shown then in a limited number of independent houses because the bigger chains are pledged not to run any film without the seal. So the industry works under difficulties when it seeks to do better films, but that does not mean it fails to surmount them. It does, time and again. Under men like Dore Schary, Darryl Zanuck, and others they have made and are continuing to make many films that utilize the social power of the medium. There is no need for me to enumerate those films. You all know them. However, the effect of this social force upon the thinking of the American public (I mean from a political, economic, and ethical standpoint) is perforce spotty and haphazard. In Russia where subject matter is dictated completely as well as the treatment of that subject matter I suppose you might say that the social force of the film is more potent than in our own country. Filmmakers are permitted only one point of view. Hence, everything is integrated and consistent even if for a misguided principle. In the United States, pictures like No Way Out, Home of the Brave, Pinky, Intruder in the Dust have, I believe,\n\nstrongly influenced the thinking of the American public on the subject of the exploitation of the Negro. They were good pictures and did a wonderful job. But we still see on our screens in many other films the Uncle Tom version of the Negro. We still see the Negro portrayed as a comical caricature. We still see the good old Mammy and all the other stock low-comedy Negro types. We have made films like Gentlemen’s Agreement and Crossfire on the Jewish problem. Excellent films from a sociological standpoint. I’m sure they were of great value and made many thoughtless people reexamine their own prejudices. And yet Major Ruven Dafni, the Israeli consul in Los Angeles, wryly pointed out to me that in Cecil DeMille’s Samson and Delilah, the story of the greatest Jewish fighting man (the word Jew was never used once). As far as audiences were concerned, Samson’s people were known as Danites. And I’m sure there are some misguided souls who are not under the impression that Samson came from Denmark* The reasoning behind the omission of the word Jew is quite interesting. It was feared that because of the prejudices of portions of the audience Samson would not be considered a “romantic” figure. Here we have a truckling to a prejudice rather than an honest attempt to overcome it. We have had pictures about civil liberties like The Lawless, yet time and again in westerns, we are presented with glorification of vigilantes. In view of this condition where good and bad are presented indiscriminately, I think we will have to say that the social force of the American film is less than it might be if all filmmakers were men of goodwill. However, as there is no group of living men who are all men of goodwill we would be naive to expect that condition to prevail in the motion picture industry. However, I do believe that things are improving. I was once called in by a producer who said he wanted me to write a picture which ended, as he described it, with “Indians on a bicycle,” which meant, I suppose, that the final sequence showed the beleaguered wagon train and mounted Indians riding around it. I wrote a treatment and was called in by the producer who glared at me as if I had committed treason. “What kind of people are these Indians you got in here?” he bellowed. “Just people,” I replied. “But they ain’t people!” he yelled. “After all, what is an Indian? A lot of extras from Central Avenue with paint on their pusses! Nobody takes an Indian seriously. You’d never get a jury to absolve an Indian. I’ll tell you what an Indian is! UG! That’s what he is! Just UG!” How different was the treatment of the Indian in the current film Broken Arrow, where for once the Original American is dealt with in dignity and sorrow. I think that we cannot avoid in this discussion some mention of the documentary film. The social force of the ordinary film made primarily for entertainment is in a way indirect; the avowed purpose of the documentary is always frankly the conditioning of a social attitude. I am somewhat familiar with the documentary field because of my work in the Army where I was first chief of the special projects film branch in the office of the chief Signal Officer, and later director of the combat films division at the signal corps photographic center. In my earlier capacity, among other films, I made a series to be shown in factories and union halls which sought to dramatize for the workers who produced our guns, tanks, and planes, the issues of the conflict as they effected their hopes and interests as members of organized labor and as Americans. We made films for specific industries—two-reelers mostly—and I am not exaggerating when I saw that we actually prevented strikes and slowdowns by the timely running of a film. This was an example of utilizing the social force of a film in the clearest sense. Later, I was in charge of a division whose job was the utilization of the millions of feet of combat film shot by our Army photographers in all theaters of war. We made propaganda films to be shown in motion picture houses to the general public, such as The Liberation of Rome which was an attempt to explain to the country the sort of difficulties the Fifth Army was encountering in Italy and indirectly to challenge their own capacity to endure and struggle and fight through as the men at the front were doing. We made a weekly film called the “Staff Film Report” which was sent to the sixty top-ranking soldiers in the Allied Armies to keep them posted visually on the progress of the war, the performance of new weapons, the types and capacities of captured enemy equipment, and many other matters best projected by motion pictures. We also made a six-hundred-reel history of the war which is used now by West Point, Annapolis, and the staff and command schools. And we made Divisional Histories which were shown to new members and replacements in an outfit to give them pride in the organization they were joining. Of course, you’ve heard of the magnificent series of documentaries made by Frank Capra called Why We Fight which was a must for every member in the Army. And the program of training films was considered to have cut the length of training in most categories by 40 percent. As a matter of fact, the effectiveness of all army films was well stated by General Marshall when he declared, “We have discovered two new weapons in World War II, the airplane and the motion picture camera.” Such is the power of film well utilized in a great purpose. At this moment, there is a representative of the state department in Hollywood seeking two hundred writers, directors, and producers to make films for the Voice of America in an effort to bring the case for democracy as against communism before the people of the world. No more effective way could be devised! And more and more special groups are bringing their special messages to people through documentary films— doctors, dentists, churches, industries, charities—they, too, are beginning to understand the advantages of visual education. Most of the films that I have seen made for these groups by independent commercial film outfits are pretty bad. There is a special technique of making documentaries, and it isn’t an easy one to learn. The trick is usually in finding some dramatic objective, thus using good old basic dramatic principles despite the ostensibly factual treatment. Or else to find some way of telling a story that is so compelling and unusual that it makes a film interesting despite its lack of dramatic progression. The best documentary I ever saw appeared in the Army-\n\nNavy Screen magazine, a weekly compilation of film subjects of interest to servicemen. All these subjects were slanted subtly to make a point the Army wanted made—such as understanding our allies, racial tolerance in the services, or helping the soldier understand the contribution made by the civilians back home. None of these subjects were preachy, all were done in entertainment terms. The subject I am talking about was the one that dealt with the death of President Roosevelt. An entire issue was devoted to it, and it made use of the best footage of the thousands of feet of film shot by servicemen photographers from the time the funeral train left Hot Springs to the lowering of the coffin into the grave at Hyde Park. The footage was most impressive. Along Constitution Avenue, people wept as the funeral procession moved toward the White House. Then came the problem. What to say about it? We had some of the best young writers in America in our outfit, all of them tried and said quite frankly, “Anything you give the commentator to say seems weak and ineffectual compared to the emotional power of these pictures.” And then someone got the idea. The only words big enough to match the film were Roosevelt’s. And the only voice that could say these words was Roosevelt’s. So they found his recorded speeches and took from them phrases and sentences and statements that matched the action. It was thrilling. Roosevelt himself the commentator to his own last journey. When the camera was on the faces of people weeping Roosevelt’s voice said, “There are those who believe in the people, and those who do not… I believe in the people…” And as his coffin was lowered into the grave and the bugles blew taps, his voice said… “The health of this nation is good…the spirit of this nation is high…the hope of this is eternal!” That was documentary-making at its best. And the sheerest expression of the social power of a film I have ever seen. And now, recklessly perhaps, prediction of things to come. What is the future of the film in general? The future of the film is beyond our comprehension. We have only just begun… After all, the images on a television screen are in effect motion pictures. And motion pictures, I believe, will be the backbone of television—films will be made for television eventually and films made for television will be good. I say this despite the present low quality of the stuff you are seeing at present, which are feeble exploratory efforts. When you come right down to it only two things will count on the television screen—the face of the actor and the words he speaks, and they will have to be good. Ten thousand Indians riding over a hill coming full tilt at the camera don’t mean a thing on the television screen…spectacle and pageantry will go…as I said, what will remain is the actor and what he is given to say…and if they are found wanting…well…the public, unlike in the motion picture theaters, is always able to turn to another channel and try watching something else. Competition for the public’s attention will force the creation of better entertainment. Here’s what I think will happen. When a method is devised to install a box office into the living room—by Phonovision perhaps—which enables the telephone company to unscramble an otherwise unseeable, inaudible program on your television screen, and then bill you for the service. The gross returns on a picture will be enormous. This will permit the production of excellent films with the biggest stars and the motion picture companies will then go into the production of such pictures.³ They are fighting the idea now because of their need for the owners of the seventeen thousand theaters in which they are at present showing their films. But progress will prevail, unless we have a big war, and eventually they will have to abandon their friends the exhibitors. I predict that when this happens, almost all neighborhood theaters will close and become markets, garages, bowling alleys, what you want. The big movie palaces will remain and show stage shows and films that tend toward spectacle and pageantry on a very popular level. I believe this because of what I spoke about before the social necessity of movie going for the younger people in the country. Along with these five or six thousand bigger houses. I envisage a circuit of perhaps two thousand so-called art theaters which will show the best films of all nations an American films of very high quality specially made for exhibition in this circuit. These films will definitely not be for children. And such a setup represents a terrific possibility that “the art of motion picture” might at long last come into its own artistically and finally achieve its fullest expression as a social force in our national life.\n\nHow to Write a Successful Play (Invited Address, Loyola University of Los Angeles, 1951) Speech delivered by Richard Maibaum at Loyola University of Los Angeles, March 1, 1951. Gentlemen, my subject for today will definitely not be you too can write a successful play. No one can teach you or tell you that. As the Irishman said when he first saw a giraffe, “Begorra! There’s no such animal!” I’m convinced of it after twenty years of trying to find somebody to tell me. Not that a lot of people don’t try to tell you, particularly relatives who are always coming up with ideas for plays guaranteed to run as long as Tobacco Road and with probably more reason to run than Tobacco Road, remember it? A bunch of degenerates living like pigs whose main enjoyment was public back-scratching. For once in my life, I almost agreed with certain moralists who want to censor plays and declared that everyone concerned with the production ought to be arrested. However, as is common knowledge now, Tobacco Road ran about five years, maybe more, and earned several million dollars. Actually, joking aside, there was inherent in “Tobacco Rad” one underlying theme which lifted the play to the status of a real folk play… Jester Lester’s strange and deep love for his parched piece of earth, his home. In spite of the filth and degradation of his life he identified himself with something greater than himself—the land and its promise…and because of that one aspect of the play it, strangely enough, represented an experience worth sharing…which is just about the best definition of a good play I have ever come across. All right, so Tobacco Road was a successful play. All you have to do is get a bunch of unusual preferably filthy people doing socially distorted things and you have a hit on your hands… But wait a minute…what about Life with Father? There was a play about a most conventional bourgeois proper family…the Day household positively reeked with disinfectant… One of the Day boys didn’t dare let his sweetheart sit on his lap while he was wearing his father’s pants. Mother Day was a paragon of all the accepted motherly virtues. It was a gentle play, a nostalgic play, a heartwarming, lovable, homey play and it ran ten years, and made twice as much money as Tobacco Road. Now we really have it. Write something like Life with Father and you can’t miss. That’s exactly what Buck Crouse and Howard Lindsey, the authors of Life with Father thought, too…so they wrote Life with Mother and they didn’t make a dime… However, we can rule that out and say Life With Father, the kind of play it was, ought to be a pretty good kind of thing to write. Gentle, homey, that’s what people like. Something like Guys and Dolls which a friend of mine produced and off which he will live for the next fifty years on caviar and humming-bird’s tongues. Guys and Dolls is about as gentle as Sugar Ray Robinson and as homey as Grand Central Station. But it isn’t hard to understand the success of Guys and Dolls… Damon Runyon’s characters delighted millions…and in a cock-eyed kind of way were really as sentimental as lavender and old lace… Sentiment! Perhaps that’s the magic word. Never mind the deep intellectual. Just good old fashioned “schmaltz!” That’s what it takes! Hold on there—Did somebody say, The Cocktail Party? I saw The Cocktail Party and I fancy myself a fairly receptive intelligent fellow. I give you my word neither I myself or the audience had the foggiest notion what Mr. Eliot was trying to say. Of course, the British accent didn’t make it any easier, but I looked around at the people seated about me and all I could see were a few highbrow phonies pretending to be entranced and complete stupefaction on the part of everyone else. But we all must be wrong. The Cocktail Party is a very successful play. Intellectual soul-searching must be what the public wants…Hmmm. Maybe that’s the open sesame… Let’s write something intellectually soul-searching, like South Pacific. High point, I’m Gonna Wash that Man Right Out of My Hair sung by Mary Martin while taking a bath on stage and a platoon of sex-starved gobs bellowing There is Nothin’ Like A Dame! However, if we analyze South Pacific we realize the secret of its success must be the appeal the far-off romantic place exerts upon us…Bali Hai…mystic island…and all that… Escape! There’s the end-all and be-all! People want to escape, to get away from it all, to forget the petty inconvenience of living. So I went to see a poor, bare, stark little play called Come Back, Little Sheba about a vet who is a drunk and his sloppy wife who is hipped about a dog she had when she was younger. Said dog, called Sheba, has run away, and it certainly showed very good sense about that, and she keeps going out to the back porch and whistling for it…’til one day her husband falls off the wagon and comes home with a hatchet which he tries to plant in her peanut-brain… After the husband sobers up, she tells him she has decided not to whistle for the pooch anymore…which presumably means she has grown up and will now wash the breakfast dishes now and then… Escape, huh? No, certainly not…but a little thinking indicates the reason for the terrific impact this little play had on audiences… There isn’t a family in the country I don’t believe who hasn’t had to face the problem of drinking…and the handling of Come Back, Little Sheba was expert enough, especially in the acting, to be universal. Universality! That’s the best key of all! Write about something that has happened or could happen to anybody… Universality! Where’s my typewriter! Whooaaa! Don’t start ordering that Cadillac just yet. Ever hear of a show called The Member of the Wedding? All about an adolescent girl who becomes obsessed with the idea that she is going to accompany her brother and his new bride on their honeymoon. Happens every day. Common occurrence… Here is a play about something not universal at all… I dare say it happened just once before…to Carson MacCullough the author of the novel from which the play comes…and never again and never will again to anyone else… “The Member of the Wedding” has just been sold to Stanley Kramer to be made into a film… Miss MacCullough has probably earned herself close to a quarter of a million dollars so far from it… What was haunting about “member,” however, was really the sense of human loneliness it projected…it was heartbreaking…and yet Lost in the Stars which could give Member of the Wedding heartbreak in spades was not successful… Go figure it out! There is no way to certainly write a successful play and there is no formula to ensure it. And now, to add to your confusion and bewilderment I shall be glad to answer any questions not only\n\non this subject but any other except why doesn’t UCLA play Loyola football? Yes. Any questions?\n\nOn Freedom: Concepts for a Class (Visiting Professorship, University of Iowa, 1954) Concepts for a Class, University of Iowa, 1954 We are going to try to do something that has never been attempted before about the most important thing in the world. The thing that has never been attempted before is tackling a writing problem in quite this way—and the most important thing in the world is freedom… I think we’ll have to do some listening about it, some reading about it, some thinking about it, some talking about it, some feeling about it, and eventually some writing about it. Our objective first is to turn out a series of scripts for a Television Program. The purpose of these programs is to stimulate thinking about freedom in a democracy and to deepen loyalty to the traditions on which our way of life rests…or perhaps I should say grows…because the processes we are going to examine and then project are never-ceasing, ever-changing, and as flexible as life itself. After we have soaked up an understanding of the underlying concepts of this program…what freedom is…how it is achieved…how it can be lost…we’ll proceed as a group and try to discover the best overall approach to the writing of our scripts…what format shall we use…if any? What is the best way of telling the freedom story? What production methods can be utilized to most effectively televise that story? We’re going to search for ideas…and every idea, no matter how impractical or far-fetched it may seem, should be thrown into the pot for discussion and analysis, because often the so-called crazy idea suggests an acceptable practical one… Don’t be hesitant about speaking up… This stage of our project will be a big collaboration… We’ll set up ideas and knock them down if we can… After we arrive at an overall conception…we’re going to look for stories…stories that will illustrate what we’re trying to say… We’re going to have to dig down into our own experience…or the experiences of others… Each story will have to be concentrated on one aspect of freedom…although it is often difficult to entirely isolate one aspect from many others akin to it. Most probably these stories when we find them will be about people and their particular relationship to some problem of freedom… When I say find them, I mean, of course, create them within ourselves from the experiences, personal or impersonal, we have contemplated… At that point, we’ll start writing…either by ourselves…or in collaboration, depending on individual backgrounds and ability… I’ll be available for whatever help or advice or cooperation is required… We’ll have conferences on individual scripts, their construction, characterization, dialogue, and general progress. The amount of time I give to any individual will depend upon two things…the individual feeling, he needs help…or my feeling he needs help. When the scripts are completed some of them will be televised…the kinescopes, or films of the program, will then be available for showing both over TV or as motion pictures… There are many problems ahead of us… The most difficult is to so shape our scripts that they not only entertain but also teach… You’ll have to learn about principles of playwriting in general…and how they apply specifically to television writing… You’ll have to learn something about TV production methods…or your scripts won’t be shootable… You’ll have to learn the TV script form… You’ll also have to learn about the things a camera can and can’t do… You’ll have to learn what kind of shots to call for when writing your script… You’ll have to learn how to write with a realization that your story must basically be told in terms of pictures augmented by words… As a matter of fact, there are so many things you’ll have to learn that I had better not try to enumerate all of them here because I don’t want to frighten you prematurely… I’m not frightened…not much…because I believe we can do this thing if we tackle it together…never forgetting though that in the last analysis, like being born and dying…you write alone…except of course if you collaborate and that’s like being twins… Screen writing book…freedom books…from Mercer and Whitsel…freedom to work—feet walking behind a plow… Freedom of conscience—feet walking up steps of church, a bell is ringing… Freedom of expression—the feet of a toe-dancer Freedom of association—feet of men and women on a picket-line freedom to learn—feet of children going to school, books swinging on straps Claims to possession of property—feet of people in bank Freedom from physical interference—feet walking down road…freedom of contract—? Freedom of opinion—feet of people stopping to buy papers at newsstand General Security and safety—feet filing into a jury box Freedom of belief—steps going into curtains of voting booth—claim to honor and reputation (End)\n\nOn Speaking (An Address to Professor Hitchcock’s Class, University of Iowa, 1954) An address to Professor Hitchcock’s Class Department of Speech and Dramatic Arts University of Iowa Iowa City, 1954 I hope you will permit me an occasional reference to these typewritten sheets—I didn’t have enough time to prepare to speak extemporaneously. Besides, I want to protect myself as much as possible and say more or less what I intend to say. I’ve had too much experience with the three versions of a speech every speaker is familiar with: The speech he wants to make, the speech he does make, and the speech he makes to his pillow that night. As a playwright, screenwriter, TV and motion picture producer I am somewhat out of my element in the field of forensics. However, I sense we have some things in common and there have occurred to me several observations I’d like to pass on to you for what they might be worth. That’s something like a fellow in the wrong church insisting he’s in the right pew. But here goes anyway. But first, let me confess that when Professor Hitchcock asked me to address you, I was conscious of certain qualms. I do a good deal of holding forth in story conferences and now and then lecture on entertainment matters to various groups, but I’m certainly not accustomed to speaking to speakers about speaking. After some hesitancy, however, I agreed to appear and almost immediately regretted it. To buoy myself up I went over to the library to see if I couldn’t brush up on a few fundamentals. And I must say I soon regained my confidence. How could I go wrong after a thorough perusal of Putnam’s Ready Speech-Maker, George W. Hibbit’s How to Speak Effectively on All Occasions, The White Sunlight of Potent Words by J. S. MacKintosh? L. O. Smith’s A Compendium of Source Material to Make Your Speech Sparkle, and most helpful of all, Homer S. Hannah’s Public Speaking Without Fear and Trembling. And speaking of fear and trembling there’s a great deal of it going on these days. I divide my time between Hollywood and Hew York and on second thought I realize that many people there are beyond the fear and trembling stage and definitely in the wailing and gnashing of teeth category. For the foundations of the entertainment world as we know it have been shaken and cracked by the impact of a monstrous hurricane that threatens to blow it into entirely new shapes. To hear people talk you would think that compared to it the invention of the alphabet and the appearance of the first printing press were merely minor zephyrs in the draughty corridors of history. Oratorical touch approved by the aforementioned J. S. Macintosh’s The White Sunlight of Potent Words. I’m speaking, of course, of a small boxlike apparatus found in the living room of the American Home called innumerable names, most of them unpleasant, technically known as “the audiovisual facsimile transmission system.” TV to you. And there are twenty-five million audiovisual facsimile transmission systems. And more to come… Stop for a moment to think about it in these terms… Time was when a private theater represented the gaudiest display of personal magnificence. Lorenzo the Magnificent, Marie Antoinette, the Emperor Caligula— such are the names we associate with private theaters. Today, in the United States alone, there are twenty-five million private theaters in twenty-five million homes, presenting entertainment of an infinitely wider scope, putting to shame the sort of minor pleasantries enacted in the private theaters of the past… After all, they didn’t have My Friend Irma, or Hopalong Cassidy, not even Howdy Doody, to say nothing and nothing is precisely the right word there, Martin Kane, Private Eye. Twenty-five million private theaters—and all for free—the economic upheaval in the entertainment world has been enormous. In Hollywood where seventy and sometimes more pictures would be shooting at a time there were last week exactly twenty films before the cameras. Many neighborhood theaters have closed. The major companies are living off the distribution of their back-logs, some pictures made as long as four years ago. Cinemascope and for a short while 3-D helped somewhat, but the general fate of the entire industry is still very much in doubt. I personally believe it will survive but in a much contracted form. TV will probably take over the responsibility of supplying the greater part of mass entertainment. And the motion pictures will turn to a more selective form, on more adult themes. This will necessitate a change in the production code as regards censorship, but I’m convinced that will come about. The same thing that happened to the New York stage when motion pictures appeared until now, I think, happen to the motion picture confronted by television. Where before pictures the stage was the medium for mass entertainment, reaching the entire country through innumerable road shows and stock companies, after the advent of the silver screen the stage survived by filling a real need for a higher type of entertainment. It is not accidental that Eugene O’Neill appeared and revolutionized the American Theater just about the time that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were pioneering in saccharine and somersaults. So perhaps the American public will benefit substantially by all this. Pictures will be better, and when the television screens will be considerably enlarged, and programs televised in color, many wonderful things will be possible in that field too. How does all this affect you specifically? Yes, the impact of TV has been tremendous, terrific, and colossal on the industry that endeared those adjectives to our hearts. But has it any meaning to you as people interested in public speaking? I’m sure it does. Why, if Marc Anthony had made his funeral oration over TV the citizens of Rome would still be rioting. Obviously, television multiplies the audience to a size never before contemplated. Of course, the radio did that, too, and oratory took great strides forward in radio. Huey Long, Father Coughlin, Al\n\nSmith, Adolf Hitler, and those wonderful words of President Roosevelt’s, “My friends”—all these took great advantage of the new medium. But in the last analysis, they could bring you only voice… Jane Cowl took my advice and the change in her performance was perfectly amazing. So too, anyone who seriously thinks about television oratory will have to learn certain essential techniques. President Truman, for instance, seriously impaired his effectiveness as a speaker in his TV appearances by jerking his hands up and down in sharp, quick movements. Actually a slight blur results, not enough for an audience watching their television screens to become conscious about, but still subconsciously dissatisfied by an intrusive element. I think it’s significant that the fine motion picture and television actor, Robert Montgomery, spends a great deal of time at the White House before President Eisenhower’s appearances. Let me say this. There is a law of diminishing returns, as the TV audiences become satiated with the kind of entertainment they have for the most part been getting. When they turn off the umpteenth version of the Private Eye getting hit on the head, or the umpteenth-umpteenth variation on the eternal squabble supposedly going on between husbands and wives, there will be more and more discussion groups, panels, debates, educational programs, and so forth. Appearing on these programs will be as casual to the trained speaker as appearing before his club, if he is well-prepared and not half-baked as a television personality. One or two more observations. A great audience emphasizes the importance of responsibility. A lie is a damnable thing whenever and wherever it is uttered, because in the last analysis it is only through confidence in each other and the words we speak that make this planet at all inhabitable. A lie before millions is a frightening thing to contemplate. Do I hear the frightful echoes, “Heil! Heil! Heil!” And in the last analysis, and most important of all, a good speech in any medium is one that has something to say. Don’t forget the single greatest oration ever made, and sometimes we forget that is exactly what it was, the speed that most profoundly changed the heart of man, was made under the glowering glances of Roman soldiers to a multitude on the outskirts of Jerusalem. We call it the Sermon on the Mount. Finally, of some importance to a speaker is knowing when to stop.\n\nOn the New Drama, the New Play (Presentation at Northwest Drama Conference, Eugene, Oregon, 1962) Presentation at Northwest Drama Conference, Eugene, Oregon, 1962. When I was a little boy, about seven years old, my father took me to see a performance of the Barnum and Bailey Circus at the old Madison Square Garden in New York. I was bewitched, entranced, transported, completely. On the way home in the subway my father asked me what I’d liked best—the clowns, the acrobats, the jugglers, the animal tamers, the trapeze artists? “Daddy,” I replied, “those men who rolled up the rugs were wonderful!” Evidently I had been watching the roustabouts throughout the performance. According to that early indication of what I considered important in the theater I should have become a stage hand. Indeed, there have been times in my career that suggestion has been made to me. And times I considered taking it. Be that as it may, I chose to become a playwright. I have been one now for about thirty years. It is my profession, and I am stuck with it. The previous speaker has conveyed to you some of the problems on becoming a playwright. Having been one a good deal longer than I would like to tell, I would like to tell you about what happens after you become one. First let me say that playwrights as playwrights have more problems than anybody else. Of course, other people have problems too. As people, I mean. And in all instances where playwrights also happen to be people, they have those problems too. Take for instance actuarial tables. According to them, astronauts present the maximum insurance risk. Scanning the list of occupational diseases common to playwrights we find such relatively minor ailments as migraine headaches, hypertension, writer’s cramp, and certain unmentionable afflictions caused by excessive periods of sitting down. But the actuarial tables do not reflect the true statistics. Because the chief mortality factor among playwrights is the usually undetected ailment commonly known as a broken heart. And this condition is unique in that it enables the victim to go living, sometimes for many years, while dead. You can readily see how this louses up the actuarial tables. Playwrights have always had more problems than other people. But recent developments in the media of communications have further increased the ratio. A playwright today, such as myself, the kind called a working pro, who writes for stage, screen, and television, for money, to please the audience, is faced with a multiplicity of opportunities to pile up problems, quantitatively and qualitatively, hitherto unknown in the history of the theater. This is so because the people chiefly responsible for those problems, the Producer, the Director, the Actor, and the Scenic Artist, have extended their egos, their ignorance, and their ingratitude, into the new media with characteristic avidity. In television, of course, there are in addition two Johnny-come-lately menaces, the Sponsor and the Advertising Man, who gleefully join in the sorrowful spectacle of what is known to writers as “spitting in the chicken soup.” Before proceeding any further let me assure you that all this is in the nature of good clean fun. I am purposely exaggerating to put the playwright’s plight as pungently as possible. And any similarity to actual persons or places is unintentional, uninspired, and un-American. I realize that most of you are or will be connected with community or collegiate theatrical organizations, in an area where what is known as the professional theater is limited. And let me hasten to add that I have never been guilty of the peculiarly New York–ish provincialism that “professional” and “excellence” are necessarily synonymous. Last night’s production is as fine a production as you will find anywhere. I have had better productions of my plays in Roslyn, Long Island; Iowa City, Iowa; Skowhegan, Maine; and such places than ever I had on Broadway. It has always seemed to me that the very lack of “professional” theater creates an atmosphere of do-ityourself, in the best sense, which very often gives theatrical endeavor a vitality and an importance found nowhere else. My very first play, The Tree,⁴ which I wrote while I was an undergraduate at the University of Iowa and was initially produced there, is a case in point. In some ways, the subsequent Broadway production, although slicker and smoother, lacked the intensity and power of the original performance. And this despite the fact that the New York version was directed by Robert Rossen later to become celebrated as the director of motion pictures such as All the King’s Men and the current, The Hustler. There is often a certain magical atmosphere about a play done in Little Theatre that no amount of professionalism can match. So I speak to you as people I believe are capable or someday will be of producing meaningful, worthwhile plays worthwhile, especially if people like myself write them for you. Perhaps it will be of some value to you to know something about the problems of the professional playwright as I have encountered them during those almost thirty years of considerable activity. It might enable you to better project that most important of all theatrical objectives, the playwright’s intention. Incidentally, I also am aware of the general theme of this conference, the new drama — the new play . And although I am not what you would designate a representative of the new drama and the new play, the playwright’s problems whether he be classified as new, slightly soiled, or moth-eaten, are essentially the same. To achieve one’s ambition. Incidentally, the new drama is going precisely where the playwright has been skillful enough to convey new meanings. When we fail, the critics usually say, “It can be ambiguous on many levels.” But let’s get back to the playwright’s problems. First artistic problems.\n\nWhen I close my eyes and try to visualize a stack of all the scripts with which I have been connected in some way as a writer (or as a producer, and I often confess I have been one of those too) my mind boggles at it. I would say that those scripts represented about two hundred theatrical projects—plays, screenplays, documentary films, teleplays. And each one represents one or more problems. Many of them unsolved. Most of them represent one or more mistakes. Indeed, I believe I have made, both as an individual and as a member of a group, almost every kind of theatrical mistake it is possible to make. Every kind, that is, except the ones I shall discover working on future projects. It would be a miracle if I hadn’t an ulcer. Indeed, it would take a miracle, because I have one. Looking back now I realize that the basic reason for most of these mistakes was my inability to realize my own intention or my inability to convince someone else to faithfully project that intention if I had realized it. Most of my plays have been realistic, with solid, recognizable themes. If I have had difficulties in achieving my intention, how much more difficult it must be for men writing what is called the new drama , where theme is deliberately veiled and concealed, where the symbolic is open to numerous interpretations, and where dialogue, action, and setting are implicatory rather than explicit. Messrs. Beckett, Adamov, Ionesco, Pinter, Genet, et al., must live in a veritable hall of mirrors where every problem known to the conventional playwright is multiplied ad infinitum. I implore you to help them all you can. But we’ll return to that later. Actually, it was a toss-up whether I would become an actor or a playwright. I became the latter because I am slightly knock-kneed. I’d had two of my plays already done on Broadway, with no financial but some critical success, and to make a living as an actor. I’d heard that Norman Bel Geddes was interviewing young men for his Raymond Massey Production of Hamlet. So I went over there and found myself with about a hundred other eager applicants, tall, short, skinny, fat, all sorts of shapes and sizes. Mr. Bel Geddes addressed us from the orchestra (we were standing on the stage). “I have no doubt,” said Mr. Bel Geddes, “that you are all excellent actors. But before I read any of you I must satisfy myself of one thing. I am determined that this will be the most beautiful ‘Hamlet’ of all time from every standpoint. And as I cannot abide legs that look anything less than perfect in tights, will you all kindly remove your trousers, please.” I looked around at the hundred other chaps unbuttoning and unzipping, said to myself, “This is a hell of a profession for a man,” and walked out. I’ve never acted since. For a while, I told myself it was my sense of personal dignity that prompted me to walk out of an acting career. But in my heart I knew it was those slightly knocked knees that never would have gotten by Mr. Norman Bel Geddes. So thereafter I concentrated on playwriting. As a profession playwriting has one tremendous advantage over all others. The overhead is very small. All you need is a pencil, a pad of paper, and an idea. The first two items are relatively easy to obtain. Where and how does a playwright get this idea? Well, first he has to be ready, emotionally and intellectually, to receive it. Then some pieces of information, or incident or image triggers it off. In my own case, the sight of a rope dangling from the branch of a huge, blasted dead oak (I think it must have been once part of a child’s swing) started me thinking about the subject of lynching. That was the beginning of The Tree. Seeing a group of young German Jewish refugees in London, one of them with his head bandaged, launched me on Birthright.⁵ Once during the Depression, waiting in a cubbyhole lawyer’s office at two in the morning while a young barrister called various judges in an effort to get a writ of habeas corpus to spring a black sheep uncle out of jail, I saw a list of fourteen names on the glass door. I asked the young lawyer who they all were. “My partners,” he replied. Six weeks later, I completed the first draft of See My Lawyer.⁶ Fearful Decision,⁷ first performed on the United States Steel Hour program, and later made into the MGM picture, Ransom!⁸ about a father who refuses to pay ransom for his kidnapped young son, was the result of a vague feeling many years ago that Lindberg had been morally wrong in dealing with the people who stole his child. Then when Mr. Greenlease, twenty years later, also paid, with the same heartbreaking result, I was prompted to do some research in the FBI files. I was staggered to discover that six out of ten times a kidnapped person is recovered, whether the ransom is paid or not, and paying the ransom, if the child is still alive, often causes his death. Whereas if the parent refuses to pay ransom the criminal knows there will be no profit in what he is doing and may think twice before committing murder. As you see, there are a variety of things which stimulate the playwright’s imagination in choosing a theme. For a pro who is often given the theme and story, the most effectual stimulation, of course, is the sole requirement to produce palpable work. Next comes the task of selecting the proper stimulation in which that theme can best be exploited. Here we run into one of the immutable laws of playwriting. There are thirty-six dramatic situations, no more, no less. I am prepared to make a bona fide offer of one hundred thousand dollars to anyone who can find the thirty-seventh for me. Do it and that hundred grand is yours. Before seizing your pencils however I think I must warn you not to spend the money before you have received and deposited it. Here is a quote from a fairly inventive new drama practitioner, the author of Faust, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, “Schiller took great pains to find more than thirty-six situations, but he was unable to.” By the way, there is a most interesting book called the Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations by George Polti, published in 1916,⁹ which every aspiring young dramatist should own. It is the secret Bible of the playwriting profession. And the despair. That elusive thirty-seventh situation is the Holy Grail, the Alchemist’s Stone, for which we all continue to search. There is a story about the great jazz trumpeter, Bix Beiderbecke. During a jam session, he suddenly burst into tears. His fellow musicians tried desperately to console him, but to no avail. “Don’t carry on like that, Bix,” said one of them. “That note you’re tryin’ to blow ain’t on the trumpet.” Incidentally, the so-called new dramatists, no matter how far out they get, have not yet blown that note. Every one of their plays falls into one of those thirty-\n\nsix situations. Waiting for Godot, for instance, situation number one: Supplication to a power whose decision is doubtful. Ionesco’s Rhinoceros, situation Number Twenty: Sacrifice for an ideal; Pinter’s The Caretaker, situation Number Seven: Falling prey to cruelty or misfortune, or the unfortunate robbed of their only hope. I could go on. So the playwright reconciles himself to the fact that he is telling an oft-told tale and seeks to make his personal statement novel in terms of style. This is particularly difficult in Hollywood where mass production relies so heavily on the stereotype. Once when I was telling a producer a story I had cooked up for a Wallace Beery vehicle, he interrupted me indignantly. “No, no!” he exclaimed. “It doesn’t go that way. It goes this way!” In other words, not only were there only thirty-six situations but only one way to tell each situation, the way it had always been told by that studio. Innovation in the not so old days of Hollywood was anathema. Rodgers and Hart once sold a story to MGM called I Married an Angel.¹⁰ One day, Louis B. Mayer, who hadn’t read it, asked the story editor what it was about. The editor told him. A man says he wouldn’t marry a woman unless she was an angel. Whereupon an angel flies in the window, he marries her, and his troubles begin. LB stared at the story editor incredulously. “Let me get this straight,” he said. “An angel flies in the window, a real angel?” “A real angel,” the story editor assured him. LB shook his head grimly. “We’ve thrown out our money,” he said. “We can’t make it.” “Why not?” asked the bewildered story editor. “Because it couldn’t happen!” shouted LB. It might interest you to hear the rest of the story. When Rodgers and Hart learned that the studio had shelved their story, they bought it back for a pittance and made it the basis for a successful musical which ran for two years on Broadway. It was then once more bought by Hollywood and made into a film. By what studio? You guessed it. MGM. Yes, playwrights do have the most amazing problems. So now let us assume we have our theme and our situation. Characters take shape to participate in that situation and we draw them from prototypes we have met going about the daily business of living. We are ready to begin writing. And here we must pause and take a deep breath. Ferenc Molnár has put it brilliantly. “The only thing irrevocable about a play,” he said, “the only thing that cannot be changed, is the decision to write it.” In other words, the third act can be strengthened, funny lines can be made funnier, scenes can be cut or added, but the project is doomed if it carries in the original concept the seed of its own failure. So before plunging in we ask ourselves the fateful question. Should I or shouldn’t I? Really, there’s no way of knowing. You might as well toss a coin. Naturally you want the play to be a hit. But what assurance have you that the subject matter is timely, attractive, or whatever it is that makes people want to pay money for the privilege of witnessing it? You see a play like Tobacco Road with its cretinous, verminous characters living in filth and moral degradation. It makes five million dollars and runs five years. That must be what the public wants, you think. Then along comes a nice clean wholesome sugary play like Life with Father and it makes ten million dollars and runs ten years. Aha! That’s what the public wants. Lindsey and Crouse, the authors of Life with Father, must have thought so too. Because they wrote another play, just like Life with Father, called Life with Mother, and it flopped. I ask you now. Is there any other profession where doing what was done successfully is just about the best way to be unsuccessful? So we write the play. During this time, the men of my profession are not pleasant people, no more than an elephant in labor can be expected to be pleasant. Some playwrights work fast, others slow. Ionesco takes two days, I hear. Sidney Kingsley, on the other hand, takes years, patiently building his structure, as though it were a house, brick by brick. Sometimes he writes one line of dialogue a day. In my youth I used to write quickly, completing a play in three days. Unfortunately, some of them sounded like that. Now I write more slowly, probably because I have enough sense to be scared of the consequences. Sometimes, especially in motion pictures, you write with a collaborator. Let me assure you there is really nothing more enjoyable than stretching out on a sofa after a good lunch in a studio commissary and listening to the tapping of your collaborator’s typewriter. Naturally, there are times when you fight with your collaborator. This is not only to keep up appearances but serves a definite aesthetic function. After all, if collaborators don’t disagree there’s one collaborator too many. A typical Hollywood incident in which I was involved might be illuminating. Samuel Goldwyn was producing Pride of the Yankees, starring Gary Cooper.¹¹ He hired me and then introduced me to my collaborator, Herman Mankiewicz. “Herman’s great on story,” said Sam. “And I hear you’re good on emotion.” I had never worked with Herman before, only met him fleetingly a few times socially. I soon discovered that Herman, a brilliant raconteur, was also a two-fisted drinking man at times and this was one of those times. He rarely came to the office. So I ploughed on by myself and had completed about forty-five pages of screenplay when Herman and I were called to a conference in Mr. Goldwyn’s office. Sam had discovered Herman’s dereliction from duty and castigated him violently. “You’ll never work again in Hollywood,” he told him. Then he turned to me with an expression which I interpreted as one of gratitude and admiration. “So,” he said, picking up the forty-five pages, “you’ve done these all by yourself!” I nodded modestly.\n\n“I don’t like it,” he said. “I think it’s awful. I’m going to get Dorothy Thompson to do the screenplay.” I left, somewhat chastened. That night, Collier Young, Goldwyn’s assistant, called me. “Sam had to say that because he didn’t want to hurt Herman too much, they’re very old friends. Just stand by and as soon as Thompson gets to town, you’ll go back on the script and work with her.” I felt better. I waited. And waited. Two weeks later, having heard that Dorothy had arrived and was at work, I called Collier. “I meant to call you,” he said. “I don’t think things will work out exactly the way we planned. I mean, it’s this way. Dorothy’s working with Herman Mankiewicz.” Assuming, however, that nothing of that sort happens and the play or screenplay, either with or without a collaborator, is written, at that moment when you would think a playwright’s main difficulties are over, they actually only began. Getting a play on, for instance, is a miraculous confluence of circumstances involving a particular producer’s taste, or lack of it, finding the proper cast, a theater, which is today increasingly difficult, and a thousand other factors over which the playwright has absolutely no control. Again assuming all this is somehow accomplished, rehearsals, and the playwright’s ultimate agony, begins. I once wrote a play with an insurance agent, Mike Wallach, about the insurance business.¹² In its original form, it was a lovely satire on American business. Herman Shumlin, who bought it, insisted on bringing in a very talented man named George Haight to help with revisions. During those revisions and during the rehearsal, the play grew from eleven scenes to thirty, and the cast from fifteen to fifty. It took three revolving stages beautifully designed by Donald Oenslager to contain all the action. By the time the play opened our lighthearted spoof was something between The Miracle and Getting Gertie’s Garter. Robert Benchley’s review in the New Yorker is now quoted as a classic piece of modern criticism. Benchley wrote, “It was a triumph of lumber over a good idea.” What could I have done about it? Do about it? I aided and abetted the slaughter because I lost sight of my own intention. I listened to the great Herman Shumlin’s theories about comedy (his forte was the sort of play Lillian Hellman writes) and let myself be convinced when all the time in my heart of hearts I knew everything was going to pot. My only consolation in the whole affair was that representatives of Warner Brothers practically forced us to sign a contract for the motion picture rights for a sum just ten minutes before the curtain went up opening night.¹³ So you see a playwright’s profession isn’t as hard a crust as it’s made out to be. And things do go right aesthetically, too, at times. Laura Bowman, a magnificent Negro actress, on the opening night of “The Tree” suddenly began to chant a long dramatic passage she had previously only spoken. The effect was electric. It was a hundred times better than I had ever imagined it could be. On the other hand, I have had an actor on an opening night suddenly slow down his performance, so that by contrast with the swift pace of the other actors he would draw attention to himself. It’s an old trick. Watch out for it. I’ve had actors in my plays whose minds went blank, who lost their voices, who introduced carefully concocted revisions on opening night which they’d made no previous mention of. To say the least this was somewhat disturbing to the rest of the cast as they waited for cues which were no longer in the play. Directors represent a special problem. For every one like George Abbott, who is a writer himself, and the original dreamboat,¹⁴ there are dozens who butcher and manhandle your scripts beyond recognition. Even good ones can make dreadful mistakes. Alex Segal is considered a brilliant director. He did the United States Steel Hour version of “Fearful Decision” and it was nominated for an Emmy as the best written screenplay.¹⁵ He also did the motion picture version.¹⁶ When he came to Hollywood, I buttonholed him and cautioned him about a serious pitfall I saw looming up. In the shorter television script, the savage intensity he evoked from the actors was endurable. In the motion picture, which would be exactly twice as long, I cautioned him to take it somewhat easier. Or else he would wear out his audience before the climax. He disagreed. He was going to win an Oscar his way. Exactly what I’d feared happened. It was, I think, a good film, but it could have been a great one. I am picking these incidents at random to give you some idea of the problems that beset the professional playwright. But, I realize, time is limited, and I’ll close with a few thoughts that have helped me and might help you as we play our respective roles in this wonderful, terrible world of make-believe. Never kid yourself. If you’re doing something for commercial reasons, admit it to yourself. Do the best job you can under the circumstances. A real pro knows when he’s in there to carry the champ and when he’s in there to knock his block off. Playwriting is my profession. I write for money. But not all the time. There are times when I remember Sainte-Bueve’s marvelous definition of a masterpiece and try to achieve it. “A masterpiece,” he said, “is that work in an accepted art form, which reveals, where all had seemed known, a new aspect of the human heart.” Thirty-seventh situation or no thirty-seventh situation, that’s what we’re all trying to achieve, the new men in their way, the older boys in ours. It all comes down to answering a single question. Does this book or symphony or painting or statue or play enable the people reading it, or listening to it, or looking at it, does it enable them to participate in a worthwhile experience? I’m sure you realize I’m not necessarily using the word “worthwhile” in a moral or educational sense, but in the sense of that which quickens my emotion, deepens my understanding, and enriches my life. If the drama can do that, if a play can do that, it will always be new. I would now like to announce the title of my next plays The Thirty-Seventh Situation.\n\nDeus Ex Machina, 1965 Model (1965) Invited Address, 1965 If Variety, the show business trade paper, had covered the plays in the amphitheaters of ancient Athens a typical review might very well have been captioned: Greeks gimmick gaga . Anachronistic? Not at all. For Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, et al., were no less gadget-happy than our present-day James Bond scriptwriters. As one who has worked on the screenplays of all four Ian Fleming novels to be made into films, I find a measure of literary balm in knowing that the old Greek masters who rocked the cradle of the drama were also not above resorting to mechanical devices. Invariably, when they enmeshed their hero in a particularly sticky situation, they would fall back on the old “machina.” This was a kind of crane or derrick used to fly actors playing gods or goddesses on stage a la Peter Pan. Said divinity would extricate here from his predicament and fly off again. The Romans later called this bit “deus ex machina,” the God from the Machine. It was the granddaddy of all the gadgets and gimmicks we dream up for the Bond films. Naturally we’ve chimed a lot of changes on the classic idea of a contraption rushing a super-being to the rescue. James Bond, super stuff too, personally operated most of the machinery and usually rescues himself. Occasionally, however, lesser mortals like Felix Leiter of the CIA are permitted to help out a bit. A case in point is in Thunderball when Felix saves Bond by pulling him up through the blowhole of an otherwise sealed underwater cave. Felix either winches him out by helicopter or utilizes the fantastic new US Army Skyhook technique. At present writing, it hasn’t been decided which. But save him he will and in the latest scientifically exciting way. All Ian Fleming’s characters are larger than life, including his villains. So it is only fitting that they, too, should have at their disposal the gadgetry to implement their outsize diabolism. Fleming himself revealed in fast new cars, boats and planes, and was fascinated in adapting the latest scientific developments for the secret agentry gimmicks, both offensive and defensive, with which he galvanized his stories. In Thunderball, for instance, he had his villains use an enormous hydrofoil in their plot to hijack the atomic bombs and blackmail the governments of Great Britain and The United States for a hundred million pounds. We’ve gone Ian one better by adding a false superstructure to the hydrofoil, thus disguising it as a much slower conventional yacht. At the touch of a button the superstructure can be jettisoned, enabling the unencumbered hydrofoil to achieve its maximum getaway speed and leave the US Navy wallowing in its wake. But not James Bond. He pursues and overtakes the hydrofoil in a still later development in boat building, a Hovercraft, which skims along above the surface on an air cushion. The struggle for power has become a contest between men using all the marvelous machines made possible by technological progress. No small part of the success of the Bond films can be attributed to their reflection of this hair-raising condition of contemporary life. Presented in terms of exciting entertainment audiences somehow find it all enormously rewarding. They never seem, even momentarily, to be appalled by the implications of eventual destruction to the planet. I suppose we can thank the old Greeks for that too. They called this magical, identifying yet escapist ability of the audience “empathy.” It enables them to participate in peril without danger, violence without pain, love without the morning after, tears without sorrow. The only price they ever have to pay is for admission. A spoil-sport part of me sometimes whispers that I am merely explicating popular mechanics oiled with sex and sadism. It may be so. I can only plead it’s just as much fun for me as it seems to be for the public. It takes considerable research and constant alertness to news of industrial and military devices which could conceivably be useful in Bond’s adventures. Sometimes a device like the laser beam in Goldfinger can replace Fleming’s more conventional circular buzz saw. And I think the all-purpose exploding attaché case is From Russia with Love was an improvement on the gun in the binding of a volume of Tolstoy’s War and Peace. So too the electronic and nuclear establishment we gave Dr. No lent itself to more exciting action than Fleming’s birdfertilizer processing plant, whimsical though that might have been. And, of course, Fleming’s version of the Aston-Martin in Goldfinger was a mere child’s toy compared with the complex lethal weapon it became in the film.¹⁷ In other instances, gadgets have suggested episodes not in the novels. In Thunderball, among others, we use radioactive pills taken internally to emanate impulses which can be picked up to locate our missing hero. He also carries a plastic hood, coated with silicon, which extracts just enough 0 from H20 to enable him to continue breathing and survive for the few crucial seconds he needs to escape man-eating sharks through a water-filled tunnel. We also screen the latest developments in military techniques and equipment. The sensational Aquaparas, stationed at Fort Orlando in Florida, frog-men-parachutists used primarily in air-sea rescue work, suggested an entirely novel way of handling one aspect of the climax in Thunderball. In the book Fleming used frogmen surfacing through the escape hatch of a nuclear submarine. We felt that was no longer newsworthy enough to produce the series of shocks and thrills we wanted. In the opening of Thunderball, Bond escapes from the thirdstory balcony of a French chateau by jet-pack, soaring away and over a broad expanse of lawn to the safety of his\n\ncar, parked strategically behind tall hedges along the road. The episode is not in the book. It’s in the film only because there is such a device in existence and it cried to be buckled onto James Bond’s broad back.¹⁸ I hope I haven’t given the impression that I am solely responsible for including all these gadgets and gimmicks in the films. Everyone connected with them is on the lookout for striking new devices. It’s the writer’s job, however, to integrate them effectively into the action. He has to do that first, on paper, then the director does it for real. The British Secret Service, MI6 particularly, for which Bond works, has what Fleming calls “Q Branch.” It develops the espionage and counterespionage devices Bond and his fellow Double 0 agents use. Eon Productions, which produces the Bond films, has what amounts to a Q Branch too. All of us who work for Eon belong to it. Even relatives are allowed in. And some have come up with the best ideas we’ve had. Naturally none of these suggestions would ever appear effectively on the screen without the superb talents of Eon’s technicians. In a hot war I’d much rather be bucking Ml6’s Q Branch than Eon’s. And I’d vastly prefer to cope with M than with Messrs. Broccoli and Saltzman, Eon’s producers. Their showmanship with these infernal machines is only equaled by their demand for more of them! They are willing to spend considerable sums required to achieve the very latest, positively most sensational thrills ever to be flashed upon the screen. And I’m not sure that isn’t the main reason they’ve captured a world audience of such rabid fans. I’m pretty sure James Bond and his gadgets will be with us for a long time. As overt war becomes increasingly unthinkable, governments will more and more resort to clandestine conflict which can be denied officially. The era of the Secret Agent is only dawning, and his doings, both real and fancied, will continue to interest the public. Most fascinating of all will be the equipment yet to be invented with which he will fight his country’s battles, and which Eon Productions will immediately snatch up for its next James Bond film.\n\nOn Writing the Bonds, 1965 1965 I had turned in the final draft of the Goldfinger screenplay and was about to leave for London Airport and the plane to Los Angeles. At the door of his office, Harry Saltzman, who produces the James Bond films with his partner, Mr. Broccoli, shook my hand. “Thanks for knocking your brains out for us,” he said, then quickly corrected himself. “I mea"
