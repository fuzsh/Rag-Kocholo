        "text": "Licence to Kill is a 1989 film in which James Bond leaves Her Majesty's Secret Service to stop an evil drug lord and avenge his best friend, Felix Leiter.\n\nDirected by John Glen. Written by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.\n\nHis bad side is a dangerous place to be. taglines\n\nFranz Sanchez\n\n[edit]\n\n[curious about Bond's appearance at the casino] Se√±or Bond, you got big cojones. You come here, to my place, without references, carrying a piece, throwing around a lot of money... but you should know something: nobody saw you come in, so nobody has to see you go out.\n\n[about to put Bond in a cocaine grinder] When it gets up to your ankles, you're going to beg to tell me everything. When it gets up to your knees, you'll kiss my ass to kill you.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nEd Killifer: You're facing 139 felony counts, Sanchez. Why that's 936 years. Even one of your famous $1-million-dollar bribes can't get you out of this one.\n\nFranz Sanchez: Two.\n\nKillifer: What?\n\nSanchez: Two million. U.S. Standing offer for anyone who squeaks me.\n\nKillifer: Goddammit, you think you're in some banana republic?! All that scumbag money won't do you a bit of good here.\n\nSanchez: Very good, but I think I'm gonna be home soon, huh?\n\nKillifer: Why you.....[attacks Sanchez before being restrained by his partner]\n\n[M confronts Bond in Key West over his emotional response to what happened to Felix and Della as well as ignoring his assignment]\n\nM: [disappointed] You were supposed to be in Istanbul last night! I'm afraid this unfortunate Leiter business has, somehow... clouded your judgment. You have a job to do. I expect you on a plane this afternoon.\n\nJames Bond: I haven't finished here, sir.\n\nM: Leave it to the Americans. It's their mess. Let them clean it up.\n\nBond: Sir, they're not going to do anything! I owe it to Leiter. He's put his life on the line for me many times before.\n\nM: [cutting him off] Oh, spare me this sentimental rubbish! He knew the risks.\n\nBond: And his wife?\n\nM: This private vendetta of yours could easily compromise Her Majesty's Government. You have an assignment, and I expect you to carry it out objectively and professionally.\n\nBond: [refuses to let the matter go and chooses to resign instead] Then you have my resignation, sir.\n\nM: [shocked] We're not a country club, 007! Effective immediately, your licence to kill is revoked. And I require you to hand over your weapon. Now. I need hardly remind you that you're still bound by the Official Secrets Act.\n\nBond: Then I guess it's... farewell to arms.\n\n[Bond knocks the other agents and escapes before a nearby sniper and the other MI6 agent try to shoot Bond down, but M stops the agent]\n\nM: Don't! Too many people! [M sees his best agent running away from MI6 in Key West and is shocked to see this] God help you, commander.\n\n[Killifer is dangling on a rope over a shark tank]\n\nEd Killifer: There's $2 million in that suitcase. I'll split it with you.\n\nJames Bond: [menacingly] You earned it. You keep it... old buddy.\n\n[Bond throws the case at him, knocking Killifer into the water. A shark makes Killifer his next meal]\n\nSharkey: God, what a terrible waste. [Bond glares at Sharkey] Of money.\n\n[Bond fins Q at his hotel room in Isthmus]\n\nJames Bond: This is no place for you, Q. Go home.\n\nQ: Oh, don't be an idiot, 007. I know exactly what you're up to, and quite frankly, you're going to need my help. Remember, if it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago. [opens a case] Everything for a man on holiday. Explosive alarm clock - guaranteed never to wake up anyone who uses it. Dentonite toothpaste - to be used sparingly, the latest in plastic explosive.\n\nBond: I could do with some plastic.\n\n[Kwang and his men, plus MI6 Agent Fallon, have captured James Bond after he tried to kill Sanchez at his casino office]\n\nKwang: Who would have a signature gun?\n\nFallon: James Bond. [examines the gun] This is the property of Her Majesty's Government. How did you get it?\n\nJames Bond: Piss off!\n\nKwang: Who ordered you to kill Sanchez?\n\nFallon: No one! He's a rogue agent. I've got orders to take him back one way or another.\n\nBond: Who the hell are you people?!\n\nKwang: We're Hong Kong Narcotics, you bastard! [grabs Bond] Sanchez is taking us to the heart of his operations. I've been setting it up for years! [menacingly] I just hope that little stunt of yours hasn't scared him off!\n\n[Sanchez's army is at the hideout]\n\nBond: Get me out of these bloody things so I can deal with you.\n\nFallon: No, Commander. You're in no position to make deals. You're a loose cannon on deck. [prepares syringe] I'm shipping you straight back to London.\n\n[Bond struggles until Sanchez's army attacks]\n\n[Bond has destroyed a tanker]\n\nTruman-Lodge: Brilliant! Well done, Franz! Another $80 million write-off!\n\nFranz Sanchez: Then I guess it's time to start cutting overhead. [guns him down]\n\n[Bond has destroyed all of Sanchez' tankers and has just emerged from the wreck of the last tanker]\n\nFranz Sanchez: [sets up to hack Bond by machete] You could have had everything!\n\nJames Bond: Don't you want to know why? [briefly shows Sanchez his cigar lighter which says \"James, love always. Della and Felix.\" Bond sets Sanchez on fire and escapes before the oil tanker explodes. He sees Pam driving a truck cab]\n\nPam Bouvier: What are you waiting for, get in!\n\nBond: Yes, sir! [gets in the truck and escapes with Pam]\n\n[Bond is at the party having a phone call with Felix Leiter]\n\nJames Bond: I'll be up to see you next week.\n\nFelix Leiter: Good. I'll be out by then. M called, he tried to reach you, I think he may have a job for you.\n\nBond: [sees Lupe] Look, Felix, I have to go, my, er, hostess has just arrived.\n\nLeiter: Take care, James.\n\nBond: You too. Goodbye.\n\n[Bond dives onto a pool to join Pam, who was distraught seeing him with Lupe]\n\nPam Bouvier: Why don't you wait until you're asked?\n\nJames Bond: So why don't you ask me?\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nHis bad side is a dangerous place to be.\n\nJames Bond is out on his own and out for revenge.\n\nOut for revenge. Glimpse behind the cool facade of 007, And see how sweet revenge can really be.\n\nDisgraced, Dishonoured, Deadly.\n\nWhen Bond wants revenge, nothing stands in his way. Not even HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE!\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nTimothy Dalton - James Bond\n\nCarey Lowell - Pam Bouvier\n\nRobert Davi - Franz Sanchez\n\nTalisa Soto - Lupe Lamora\n\nAnthony Zerbe - Milton Krest\n\nFrank McRae - Sharkey\n\nDavid Hedison - Felix Leiter\n\nPriscilla Barnes - Della Churchill\n\nWayne Newton - Professor Joe Butcher\n\nBenicio Del Toro - Dario\n\nAnthony Starke - Truman-Lodge\n\nEverett McGill - Ed Killifer\n\nCary Hiroyuki-Tagawa - Kwang\n\nDesmond Llewelyn - Q\n\nRobert Brown - M\n\nCaroline Bliss - Miss Moneypenny\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nLicence to Kill quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nLicence to Kill at Rotten Tomatoes"
