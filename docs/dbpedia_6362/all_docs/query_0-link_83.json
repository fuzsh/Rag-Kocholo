        "text": "In 2008 Sir Roger Moore released his first book, a memoir entitled My Word is My Bond. The book is an enthralling tale that takes readers through his early childhood, his many years as a venerated actor with such prominent roles as The Saint and James Bond, up through his present day role as an elder show business statesman and more importantly a celebrity ambassador for UNICEF. Moore has often been described as a raconteur and this book lives up to that expectation. As a reader you feel like you’re seated with him at your favorite restaurant sipping wine as he relates colorful anecdotes of his long storied career as well as his early childhood. Born in Stockwell, his childhood was plagued by illness and having to evacuate his home town to live in Devon while the threat of bombing raids loomed over London. Moore paints a colorful portrait of his early life and career and provides a rather insightful view into the latter days of the Hollywood studio system where actors would be under exclusive contract to a film making studio and the heads of these studios wielded enormous power and control over the careers of the actors employed by them.\n\nMoore is charmingly self-deprecating throughout holding no delusions as to his actual acting prowess. One gets the sense that he sees himself as someone who was extremely lucky having the right look and obtaining the right contacts, friendships, and show business relationships to mold his career over the span of decades. His one literary vice seems to be name dropping, and that is actually the one consistent flaw throughout the book. Oftentimes an amusing anecdote is accompanied by several tangents where the name dropping can get irritating, but once you get used to it, it can get rather amusing. Moore is also a self-confessed practical joker. On his James Bond sets, he would often prey upon Desmond Llewelyn who played Q. Knowing that Q’s dialogue was rather intricate and full of technobabble, he’d often get hold of the script and change Llewelyn’s lines hours before shooting forcing him to learn new dialogue. On other occasions, Moore was a peacekeeper as on the set of The Persuaders a TV show where he costarred with Tony Curtis for 1 season as a mismatched duo who went on adventures. When Curtis called the episode’s guest star Joan Collins the “C-word” Moore was called onto the set on his day off to diffuse the situation.\n\nUpon getting the much coveted role of James Bond, he recalls:\n\nI’d be the first to admit that I’d been living the good life in the previous year or so…. That was brought home to me rather curtly when Harry [Saltzman, co-producer] called me one day.\n\n‘Cubby [Broccolli, co-producer] thinks you need to lose a little weight.’\n\nOkay, I thought. So I started a strict diet.\n\nThe phone rang again. ‘Cubby thinks you’re a little out of shape.’\n\nSo I started a tough fitness regime.\n\nAgain the phone rang, this time it was Cubby. ‘Harry thinks your hair’s too long.’\n\n‘Why didn’t you just cast a thin, fit, bald fellow in the first place and avoid putting me through this hell?’ I replied.\n\nThe stories he tells about making the Bond films are quite fascinating as a fan and Moore’s rather unique insight into this experience is always quite compelling and amusing:\n\nCubby and I visited Maurice [Binder, title designer for the Bond credits sequences featuring naked ladies ofttimes in silhouette] on his shooting stage one day and found him on his knees, lovingly spreading Vaseline over the private parts of one of his female nudes. He said it was to keep her pubic hairs flat in front of the wind machine, so as not to incur the further wrath of the censor.\n\nI turned to Cubby, ‘And I thought that was one of the producer’s perks?’\n\nIn a scene where Bond quips about Egyptian builders knowing full well that a representative of Egypt’s government was on set monitoring their every line, Roger suggested that he simply mouthed the line by moving his lips and not actually saying anything so that they could add the line later in post-production. Many such stories are cleverly regaled throughout the book, however, when Roger doesn’t have something nice to say about someone he tries to keep it diplomatic by simply stating that he has nothing to say about them as is the case with Grace Jones his co-star on his final Bond film, A View to a Kill. Jones reportedly took a large black dildo into the bed with her for their love scene, which seems to have perturbed Roger despite his penchant for practical jokes. At the same time, one gets the sense that he may have glossed over his failed marriages although he admits to sharing in some degree of fault for how they ended. One of his ex wives spent many years denying him a divorce.\n\nWhat drives the latter third of the book is his commitment to UNICEF, and we learn that despite his life of privilege Moore has done a remarkable job giving back to the world at large through his dedication to UNICEF bringing awareness to the struggle to help children in need around the globe. His major cause since he joined the organization in 1991 is to raise funds and awareness for Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) in many third world countries. It’s a preventable problem that can be resolved by simply ensuring that every household uses iodized salt to avoid all sorts of maladies and mental disorders. Moore frequently meets with heads of state on behalf of UNICEF to urge them to combat IDD in their poorest communities. Roger has led a fascinating life and he is to be commended for his commitment to UNICEF. He has received many honors for his humanitarian work, and in 2003 he was Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II particularly for his work with UNICEF. Roger Moore may not be everyone’s favorite Bond actor, but he’s lived a fascinating life. Reading this book, you can’t help but develop a profound respect for the man. On his work for UNICEF he writes:\n\nI’ve often been asked just how much UNICEF receives from the United Nations and why we need to raise funds. The answer is UNICEF receives nothing from the UN, it is completely self-funded and that is why I – and others like me – go out banging the drum. Of the money we raise, less than nine percent goes in administration costs around the world; the rest goes directly to the children\n\nApologies for taking so long to finish off this series review of VARGR. I actually finished reading this compelling series as soon as the last issue arrived, but I didn’t have time to sit down and write a review. Before I knew it I found myself occupied by other things and this final review just slipped away from me. By now I realize that the latest issues of Eidolon have already hit the shelves, but for now I’ve decided to wait until the hardcover edition comes out as it’s much easier to review the story as one complete work rather than review the individual issues.\n\nWhen we last left Bond in issue #4, Bond was trapped in a decontamination chamber behind bullet proof glass by the main villain Kurjak who had synthesized a new lethal drug now wreaking havoc in the UK. The decontamination process started at the end of the last issue and now we begin issue 5 wondering just how our favorite hero will get out. Not only does he manage to escape, he finds time to enjoy a cigarette afterwards. Remember, the good ol’ days when Bond smoked?\n\nWe then get a nice little “Peter Franks” call back as Bond returns to London. Many Bond fans will remember that Bond used the Peter Franks alias in Diamond are Forever. I thought that was a nice little touch. M. informs Bond that a possible contaminated package had just been tracked by MI5 at the local docks. Bond pursues the lead only to run into Dharma, Kurjak’s accomplice who now seeks revenge for the death of her lover Bryan Masters who Bond killed in the previous issue. A fight ensues with Bond cleverly dispatching her using her metallic prosthesis to his advantage. It’s a little disarming watching Bond fight with a woman even if the comic makes Dharma out to be an assassin in her own right. Usually, we would either see Bond convert her to the side of good, or we would witness her death at the hands of the villain or a female Bond ally. While, I didn’t expect the writers of VARGR to follow typical Bond tropes from the films, I was expecting something different for this character since they invested so much in her back story in the previous issues. Later Bond remarks, “and then the batteries in her prosthetic arms explosively combusted” while pouring himself a drink.\n\nWe then learn that bond must travel to Norway to pursue a battleship called VARGR where Kurjak’s main operation is based. In issue #6, Bond is equipped with a sniper rifle and a suppressor for his Walther PPK. The RAF airdrop Bond and he easily infiltrates the ship sets up his explosives and goes about well . . . being Bond. It’s nice to see Bond in stealth mode for a while as he sneaks about the battleship without anyone taking notice. When they finally do realize there is an intruder, it’s far too late. Bond kills just about every guard Kurjak’s sends to pursue him. We also get a nice helping of hand to hand combat before Bond bolts off the ship and triggers the explosion leaving Kurjak alone and defenseless. Bond demands to know the reasons for Kurjak’s villainy, but Kurjak offers only a feeble response. Bond kills Kurjak in cold blood and that is the end of the VARGR story.\n\nOverall, I think there are strengths and weaknesses to VARGR. I think writer Warren Ellis and artist Jason Masters have done a good job with the characterization of Bond as well the MI6 team. Even though this is an original story taking place in the present day, it’s easy to tell that they took plenty of inspiration from Fleming as well as the cinematic franchise in this piece and it shows in how Bond relates to M., Bill Tanner, and Miss Moneypenny. The repartee between Bond and the MI6 team is damn near perfect. The action sequences are very well crafted and many panels stand out as great Bond artwork sure to attract many Bond fans.\n\nThe story and the villains themselves are a little murky. I think I was mostly impressed in the early issues before I knew where they were going with it, but as we got to the end, I felt there are certain things that they could have done more with and certain plot choices that could have been better executed. I think Dharma turns out to be a bit of a wasted character. It would have been nice to have more than just a fatal fight between her and Bond as her final moments in the story. Also, I think the ending with Kurjak’s demise seemed a bit weak. I think we had sufficient reasons earlier on to know why Kurjak was engaged in his experiments, and I don’t know why Bond would ask him to clarify his motives at the end rather than just go for the kill. I also think that the MI6 segments that focus on new regulations prohibiting Bond from carrying a weapon within the UK weigh down the plot quite a bit.\n\nDespite my criticisms, I really enjoyed VARGR and look forward to a new era of Bond comics commencing with Eidolon, which promises the return of SPECTRE for the first time in this comic incarnation of Bond. I’m glad Bond has returned to the comics medium, and I know there is more to come including a brand new adaptation of Casino Royale. Furthermore, there is a brand new series called Hammerhead by Andy Diggle and Luca Caslanguida. Indeed, it’s safe to say James Bond will return . . . or rather he’s here to stay.\n\nHeads You Die is the 7th novel in the Young Bond series and the second book written by Steve Cole after Charlie Higson’s monumental first five novels in the series. This book picks up right after Cole’s last offering, Shoot to Kill, where Bond thwarted a dangerous Hollywood blackmail scheme. James (about 14 or 15) and his new school friend Hugo, a 16-year-old boy afflicted with dwarfism, are now in Cuba staying with family friend of Aunt Charmain, Dr. Hardiman prior to embarking on their return trip to Europe. We know from Fleming’s brief writing on Bond’s youth that Bond will eventually end up going to Fettes College in Edinburgh to complete his education, but Heads You Die has other plans in store for young Bond. This is quite simply Steve Cole’s best Young Bond novel so far especially for those readers who may have been discouraged by the Hollywood setting of the previous book. The Caribbean is prime Fleming territory and Cole knows this and utilizes it to optimum effect.\n\nThe plot is set in motion when Dr. Hardiman is harassed and then kidnapped by a dastardly villain named Scolopendra, a native of the island who has achieved wealth and power by acquiring a vast and comprehensive knowledge of the island’s botanical treasures. He needs Dr. Hardiman to work on a mysterious secret project and uses his henchmen to intimidate anyone who stands in his way. James suffered through several encounters with the aptly named El Puňo so christened due to the fact that after the massive man lost his hand, he had a block of granite fixed on to his stump carved into the shape of a fist.\n\nIn addition to Hugo, Bond works with a new set of allies. Jagua is Scolopendra’s daughter\n\nwho has grown disgusted with her father’s cruel methods and Maritsa is Jagua’s best friend. Jagua is probably the strongest female character of all the Young Bond books. She’s fiercely rebellious and is able to handle multiple dangers to achieve her goals. She’s actually very reminiscent of Judy Havelock from Fleming’s For Your Eyes Only short story. Their motivations are different of course but their determination and their strong wills are very much similar. Together the group figures out that the only way to rescue Hardiman and end Scolopendra’s mysteriously cruel secret project is to get some kind of leverage to use against Jagua’s father. A strong box on a sunken cruiser may hold the key to foiling Scolopendra’s plans, but first they must dive. Here’s where Cole unleashes his inspiration from Fleming. The primitive diving equipment utilized by Jagua and Maritsa, who have grown accustomed to diving provides quite a challenge for young James. With a primitive diving helmet attached to hoses and bellows for air, Bond must dive deep down into the water to recover a mysterious strong box with Hugo pumping the bellows to provide air to the homemade helmet under water. As if that wasn’t enough of a challenge to navigate, young James promptly discovers he isn’t alone and a thrilling underwater action sequence ensues.\n\nBond must also contend with the mysteriously veiled woman named La Velada who has Scolopendra under her spell much to Jagua’s contempt and decipher what to make of her connections to Russian Secret Police. Multple dangers are in store for Bond to contend with including many chases, being shot at by La Velada, and hiding while a murder takes place. The following sequences gives us a glimpse at how Cole invests the readers in the psyche of Bond much like Fleming had done.\n\n“ One thought kept spinning around in his head: If La Velada’s bullet had hit me yesterday, I’d be a corpse on the floor myself. Now Scolopendra had executed a man, and she hadn’t even flinched; clearly they were two of a kind. James shuddered. To shoot a man dead in cold blood, at point-blank range . . .\n\nI could never do that.”\n\nWhile demonstrating just the right amount of restraint, here Cole invests us in Bond’s youth and innocence in a way that foreshadows the man that James will become. These experiences throughout the Young Bond novels are slowly shaping who James will be, but at this stage the concept of killing in cold blood is shocking to the young man and appropriately so. Clearly, Bond doesn’t know how any human being could possibly commit an act of brutality without remorse or any emotional effect whatsoever. At the same time, Bond is constantly finding himself in dangerous situations in circumstances far beyond his control. Take this quote from an earlier chapter:\n\n“Heart hammering as he raced away, James knew that he would never get used to the thrill of danger. That was its allure. So much of life was routine and boring, but danger had no rules. It happened anywhere, could take so many forms.\n\n‘And it looks me up wherever I go,’ he muttered to himself.”\n\nNote the italicized emphasis on the word “never.” Danger is something he would “never” get used to, but he still relished the thrill of it. For now, in James’s psyche the dangerous situations are not thrills that are sought after but when he happens to come across said danger he enjoys it on some level because he contrasts it with “boring” and “routine” regular life. It should therefore come as no surprise that the adult Bond would subscribe to a life that guarantees danger with every mission perhaps to relive the same childhood thrill.\n\nHeads You Die is a fantastic novel and I look forward to Steve Cole’s 3rd book, Strike Lightning due out in September where we will finally see how Bond settles into life at Fettes College. While I don’t blame anyone for missing Charlie Higson, Heads You Die has convinced me that Steve Cole has put Young Bond on the right course. Not only is able to deliver thrilling action sequences for young james, he also delivers on building upon the character we’ve gotten to know in the previous books. I highly recommend this latest book and I have no doubt that Strike Lightning will continue to provide the kind of suspense and thrills to exceed our expectations as Bond fans.\n\nAs a side note, I highly recommend acquiring the limited edition hardcover of Heads You Die available only as an import if you live in the US. Cole provides his insights about where he drew his inspiration for the diving sequences with a notable selection from Fleming’s short story, “The Hildebrand Rarity.” He also provides a deleted / altered scene from his book for context, which gives the lucky reader a brief glimpse at the creative process involved in writing a Young Bond book.\n\nreview by Jack Lugo\n\nAside from all the click bait articles surrounding Daniel Craig’s status as Bond, the one recent article containing an actual relevant quote pertaining to the future of the Bond films came from the Norwegian film / media site filmweb.no . (update: you can find a proper translated version here)\n\nOnce you let Google Translate work its magic, you’ll find an article largely focused on the recent London auction of SPECTRE props and vehicles, most notably an Aston Martin DB10 which sold for £2,434,500 (or $3,375,896.81). The article goes on to mention that they had the opportunity to chat with Gregg Wilson, son of EON producer Michael G. Wilson. Both Gregg and his brother David have done extensive work in the Bond films. David went on to become the executive producer of the Bond video games while Gregg has worked as both assistant and associate producer since Quantum of Solace (2008). Gregg goes on to briefly describe his earliest experiences in the Bond universe. He is quoted as saying:\n\nThe first memory I have of the Bond films is from set of “Octopussy” (1983). I remember that I visited the huge circus set. It was a very magical moment for a little boy. Later, I also remember that I visited the sets of the Timothy Dalton films “The Living Daylights” (1987) and “Licence to Kill” (1989). There is something very special about walking into a Bond set, you feel right away that you are in a different universe.\n\nHe recounts working with David Arnold on the soundtrack to The World is Not Enough (1999) and then working on every film since Die Another Day (2002). He also describes script development as a real passion of his, and it sounds like SPECTRE (2015) marks the first time that he had the opportunity to get involved in this process.\n\nThe most fascinating part of the article comes at the very end, however, which is something I can’t imagine any reasonably competent British or American editor allowing in this day in age. The topic is none other than “The Future of Bond.” Here Gregg gives us the first glimpse into what the thought process is right now at EON during the earliest stages of planning for Bond 25:\n\n“We’ve just begun to doodle with ideas for the next movie. Each script process begins when we ask ourselves the question: ‘What is the world afraid [of] now?.’ In the case of “SPECTRE” was the theme global monitoring and utilization of information. So now we are trying to find out what will be relevant in the coming years.”\n\nHe further elaborates:\n\n“We always want to do something new with the Bond character and see him in situations we have not seen him in the past. We must give the audience something new every time. After noon movies are not always easy. But often it helps to go back to Ian Fleming’s novels for inspiration, whether you’re talking about grades or mood, says Wilson who is pretty sure Daniel Craig reprising the role agent 007 in “Bond 25”.\n\nNow of course this isn’t much to go on. I suppose we have all figured that EON has always thought along these lines in order to make each new film relevant, viable, and interesting to modern audiences, but to actually hear someone from the inner circle talk about the process even in the vaguest terms … well, that’s enough to send most hardcore Bond fans into a bit of a frenzy.\n\nSo, let’s take a moment to consider real world threats that might somehow potentially play a role in Bond 25. It’s safe to assume that if Craig returns, SPECTRE / Blofeld will be the main source behind the threat, but let’s set them aside for now and just look at what threats are out there assuming that SPECTRE is malleable enough that it can manipulate any number of disastrous occurrences within the Bond universe. The threat that probably springs to everyone’s mind immediately is that of terrorism. It’s a horrible reality of living in our times that the threat of terrorism has become something that we have to contend with and confront no matter where you live. In the Bond universe, we already know that SPECTRE were planning to blow up a stadium full of people in Mexico City before Bond intervened. In the real world, there is state sponsored terrorism, rogue non state-sponsored terror cells, and lone wolf attacks, any of which can result in enormous tragedy. There is also cyber terrorism, which Skyfall touched on to some extent before Silva’s motivations were revealed.\n\nHow could Bond 25’s theme explore a terrorism threat? Well, that’s easy. Bond would have to thwart a potential terrorist attack somewhere in the world hopefully outside of the UK. I have no doubt that a decent movie could be constructed from such a basic plot, but doesn’t that sound like the plot of a lot of other typical action movies? Surely, there would have to be more to it than that for it to work as Bond film. There would have to be global consequences at stake, exotic locations, and a beautiful woman or three to either help or impede Bond’s progress. Still, this is Bond and while I’m sure we all would want 007 on our side to protect the world from terrorists, I think it’s safe to say that EON might want to go with a more complicated threat.\n\nBeyond terrorism, there has always been a threat of an attack from a rogue government. Recent rocket testing in North Korea as well as the treaty brokered with Iran have made governments and citizens around the world extremely nervous about the threat of either of these countries achieving nuclear capabilities. While I’m sure EON would like to avoid inserting real world global politics into Bond, the idea of Bond thwarting a potential rogue country’s nuclear strike is one that I think might have appealed greatly to Ian Fleming. Of course, in Thunderball we witnessed Bond thwarting SPECTRE’s plan to hold the world to ransom by stealing nuclear warheads. In that case, it wasn’t an actual government Bond was up against because it was SPECTRE behind the threat, but what if Bond had to go up against a government.\n\nWas it not Fleming himself who said, “Spying has always been regarded as (a) very romantic one-man job, so-to-speak. A one man against a whole police force or an army.” It’s been a long while since we’ve seen Bond go up against the army of an enemy foreign government. Craig’s Bond has gone up against Le Chiffre, Quantum, Silva, and now SPECTRE but never has he really butted heads with the armed forces of a sovereign power. This could potentially also bring back the naval intrigue that has been missing from Craig’s Bond films. Wouldn’t we all love to see Craig put on a British naval uniform aboard a naval vessel or submarine heading into enemy waters? I know that’s something I’d like to see.\n\nOf course SPECTRE could figure into it in some way by somehow lending aid to the rogue government in question, but I’d like to see Craig’s Bond topple the forces of an enemy despot even if it’s a fictional one. This potential plot intrigues me a lot more than just having Bond thwart a terrorist threat alone.\n\nOne other plot that might hold some resonance for modern audiences has sprung to my mind very recently. It involves the recent terrorist lone wolf attack perpetrated in San Bernadino, California by a despicable married couple in December last year. The reason why this has resurfaced in the news lately has to do with Apple’s refusal to allow the FBI access to hack into the phone owned by the murderers. There’s a highly contentious debate being held both in the media and very soon in the court rooms about the liability of allowing the government a backdoor channel into privately owned encrypted technological devices. Both sides to this debate have very legitimate concerns. On one side, the government wants to have this access so it can potentially save lives while on the other side people are concerned with government surveillance of the private information and correspondence of its own citizens.\n\nGetting back to the Bond universe, I believe that while SPECTRE touched on the issue of government surveillance it failed to really focus on it in any meaningful way. The film doesn’t really delve into the actual implications of Denbigh’s and SPECTRE’s plot to obtain control over the intelligence networks of nine governments. Bond 25 could potentially rectify this shortcoming by actually framing a fictional plot around a scenario similar to the one happening between Apple and the FBI. They could go the conspiracy route. If you think about it, do we actually believe that the government lacks the means to hack into one iPhone? Maybe the government (the fictional one in the film- that is) has already hacked into the phone, but now feels the need to use the situation as leverage to get legislation to have the means to do this on a broader basis. I could imagine a scene between Q , M., and the Prime Minister like this one:\n\nM: Were you able to hack into the device?\n\nQ: Of course, Sir. . . I didn’t even have to get out of my pajamas.\n\nPrime Minister: Very well, then. Carry on . . . oh and let’s go ahead and send a writ to (Fictional Company’s Headquarters) ordering them to help us construct a back channel to all their devices.\n\nQ: But sir, I have everything we need.\n\nPrime Minister (to M.): You heard me. Do as I ordered.\n\nPlease forgive my quickly and inadequately constructed dialogue, but you must get the gist of where a plot like this must be going. In this case, it’s the Prime Minister and whoever he’s working with (DUN-DUN DUNNN!!-SPECTRE!!!) who is trying to subvert the political power of the government for their own potential gain or profit. Perhaps SPECTRE is trying to acquire the technology company in question or maybe they just want to continue with their original plan for global surveillance only instead of nebulous platitudes about democracy and drones we have an actual plot with real characters who have a personal stake in the conflict. There could even be a sympathetic Bond girl who is on the side of protecting the privacy of citizens or a femme fatale who might lure Bond into doing her bidding as a counter measure to what M. decides is the right thing to do.\n\nThere is so much they can potentially do and I’m sure there are many fascinating ideas I may not have included here. That’s where you come in. Please, use the comments section below to discuss what you believe should be the next real world related threat for Bond 25? More than just plot, what themes would you like Bond 25 to explore? What kind of scenarios would you like to see 007 thwart or infiltrate? After all, Fleming even had Bond work for the enemy temporarily in some stories such as in Moonraker and The Man with the Golden Gun and we haven’t seen that in the film franchise since Licence to Kill (1989). Feel free to use this space to bandy about ideas. I know you could come up with good ones.\n\nEditor’s Note: I originally wrote this article for the James Bond Radio podcast website. You can check it out on their site\n\nFor my review of VARGR Issue #1, please click here.\n\nWhen we last left Bond after Issue #1, he was headed to Berlin to investigate the origins of a new dangerous narcotic drug that has now reached the streets of London. Both M. and Tanner briefed Bond on a mission and sent him off to pursue a lead given to them by Felix Leiter, an informant named Slaven Kurjak who happens to be a wealthy Serbian doctor with a formidable reputation in prosthetics and genetic development. Due to a new law enacted by the UK stipulating that British agents could not carry guns within the UK, Bond must commence his travel to Berlin unarmed.\n\nWhen he arrives, he’s greeted by a mysterious woman named Dharma Reach, who tells him that she and her driver will take him to Berlin Station. Bond is instantly attracted to her and quite expectedly lays on his classic charm although he also notices that something appears to be off about her. Something is strange bout her hands. She wears thick black leather gloves, and Bond notices that the grip of her hand feels “armored” or “weighted.” As I read this I couldn’t help but think of Dr. No’s hands. Dharma then tries to kill Bond by seducing him in the back of the car using her armored hands to choke him, but Bond fights her off causing the car to veer out of control and crash into an oncoming truck. Bond survives the ordeal although Dharma escapes.\n\nBond gets himself to Berlin station to meet up with his real allies before heading over to meet Slaven Kurjak at an experimental prosthetics laboratory. We learn that Kurjak also lost an arm and a leg in the Serbian concentration camps and now wears the same “powered prosthetics” he seems to be developing. It doesn’t take long for the reader to figure out that there must be some\n\nkind of link to the woman who attacked Bond earlier given the presence of the same kind of prosthetic limbs in both Dharma and Kurjak, the supposed informant. Something most certainly seems off and as we see Bond walk past one of the glass enclosed rooms on his way out of the laboratory, our suspicions are confirmed. Dharma emerges behind a muscular man who appeared at the end of issue #1, a henchman afflicted with anhedonia named Mr. Masters with orders to kill Bond. Much like Renard in The World is Not Enough, Mr. Masters’ condition leaves him with the inability to feel pain or even pleasure when we later learn that Dharma and Masters are also lovers.\n\nIn Issue #3 we learn that both Dharma and Mr. Masters work for Slaven Kurjak, who has just sent Bond into a trap by telling him that the drugs are being manufactured out of a garage run by members of the Al-Zein Clan, who happen to be a powerful\n\nEuropean criminal cartel. Kurjak has Masters and Dharma follow Bond to finish him off in the unlikely event that Bond makes it out of the garage alive. Of course, we all know 007 doesn’t die very easily as we are treated to a really fantastic action sequence featuring Bond eliminating all the Al-Zein Clan members in the garage despite being outgunned and outnumbered. He sleekly maneuvers himself around various scaffolding to get leverage on each member kicking over boxes and eventually gunning them all down.\n\nDharama informs Kurjak who now says that he is activating condition “VARGR,” which seems to consist of killing not only all of his workers at his laboratory but also killing everyone over at Berlin Station. Mr. Masters heads over and ambushes all of Bond’s Berlin Station allies leaving us to wonder what Kurjak’s scheme could possibly be that would lead him to such drastic measures.\n\nIssue 4 starts with Mr. Masters greeting Bond very much reminiscent to how Red Grant greeted Bond in From Russia with Love.\n\nMasters attempts to earn Bond’s trust the same way Dharama did, but it doesn’t take long for Bond to figure out that something is off about him as well. Bond uses his cell phone and tells Masters that he’s making a personal call to ward off Masters’s concerns about Al-Zein tapping all the phones. Of course Bond is really speaking to Tanner and M. using discreet language to inform them of the status of the mission pointing them to “my cousin’s friend.” In this case, the cousin is of course the CIA and Leiter and the friend is Kurjak, the supposed informant. M. also informs Bond that the cocaine that had been causing problems in London had been altered or synthesized in some way to also carry a highly infectious disease.\n\nMasters leads Bond back into Kurjak’s laboratory where everyone working there has been slaughtered. Bond tries to get the jump on Masters but Masters is able to counter Bond easily because he is impervious to pain. No amount of punching, stabbing,\n\nor kicking could possibly overtake Masters until Bond happens upon a hypodermic needle and some oxytocin. Just as Masters is about to finish Bond off, Bond injects the needle into the back of Masters’ thigh and plunges the drug into his system. The highly concentrated dose stimulates the dopamine levels and leaves Masters helpless. Bond interrogates Masters only to find out about some project named “VARGR” before administering a lethal dose of oxytocin into his neck. He then turns around to find Kurjak standing behind a plated glass partition, which he quickly learns to be bullet proof. Kurjak confirms his involvement in the synthesis of the new drug and informs Bond that he wasn’t so much of a victim in the Serbian concentration camps as he was a participant. His fascination for controlled experiments was born out of watching the inmates drink from a contaminated water supply and determining how long it would take for many of them to get sick and for the dysentery to spread. Kurjak coldly informs Bond of the decontamination cycle about to commence in Bond’s section of the room as he leaves Bond to die with the room expected to reach 300 degrees Celsius. Bond must urgently use his wits to escape the burning inferno that is about to engulf the room. He reaches for some tools and a chemical canister and tries to burn a hole through the glass partition in order to escape. Will he escape in time? He’s Bond so we know he will, but in order to find out how, we must wait for Issue #5.\n\nSo far, I’m very impressed with the story and the artwork of this series. Warren Ellis has constructed a suitable classic spy thriller with a very clever balance of the realistic and the fantastical. I’m interested to find out more about Kurjak’s plot with the synthetic drug and what his ultimate end game might be. Is there some personal motivation for what he’s doing and how does everything tie back into his work in prosthetics? Obviously, both Dharma and Masters were working for him out of some personal sense of duty because they both needed his services. I feel bad for the victims over at Berlin Station. They were all killed off quite quickly and they seemed like a friendly bunch who might have come to Bond’s aid had they been able to figure out what was happening. Artist Jason Masters does a great job with the action sequences. All the action is very easy to follow in addition to containing some very remarkable artwork. There are some frames that I imagine many Bond fans will greatly admire.\n\nI look forward to seeing how this VARGR storyline will resolve. It’s great to see Bond make a comeback to the comics medium because Bond is an ideal kind of character for comics. There’s a visual aesthetic that is integral to Bond that is unique to him and I’m glad to see both Warren Ellis and Jason Masters tap into that and put it right there on the page for Bond fans to appreciate. I’m someone who doesn’t regularly read comics so it’s a very different experience than reading a novel or seeing a film, but as a Bond fan all of my favorite elements are there. The visuals are all well executed and the story has enough intrigue to keep me interested to find out more. I suppose in a novel, we might have been treated to more information about the motivations of certain characters. I’d like to know more about Dharma’s role in all this as I think she’s the most fascinating of all the original characters. Will she remain loyal to Kurjak or will she switch to Bond’s side? That’s why I suppose I enjoy reading a story as a novel as opposed to a comic. In a comic, you’re getting the action and the dialogue and you must wait from issue to issue to have your questions answered. In a novel, you can just read it and you get all the character motivations and a perhaps a better sense of where the story is going as you read it. It takes a little more patience when reading a comic because each issue ends with more questions and you have to wait for the next issue to hope your questions will be answered. I definitely encourage Bond fans to check out VARGR and get a hold of the issues if you haven’t already. It’s a 6 issue story so I will probably wait until after the 6th issue to complete my review.\n\nEditor’s Note: I originally wrote this review for the James Bond Radio podcast website. You can check out my review on their site here.\n\nWith its meticulous research into the history of the Bond film franchise and close attention to many of the franchise’s little known details, Some Kind of Hero is the ultimate nonfiction book for Bond fans. Authors Matthew Field and Ajay Chowdhury conducted over a hundred interviews with noteworthy participants in the Bond film saga, uncovered countless little known facts, shed light on many of the franchise’s unsung heroes, and poured years of research into a well-crafted epic tome. It’s a worthy addition to anyone’s library whether you’re a hard core Bond fan familiar with the franchise’s history or a casual fan looking to read and learn more about the Bond phenomenon.\n\nThe only thing that would have cemented this book as even more definitive would have been an interview with Sean Connery himself. Rest assured, the authors landed interviews with every other Bond actor and then some. Connery, however, has become notoriously elusive in recent years. Although he has been seen a number of times in public, I imagine it would be a challenge to land an interview with him particularly if the sole topic was to be about Bond and not say Scottish independence. The authors recount their efforts to get an interview with Connery in the Introduction and they did in fact come very close. I suppose an in-depth interview with Connery relating his side of the story in regards to his experience as 007 might make for a book of its own. Even without Connery’s participation, I think the authors did a fantastic job of informing the readers about many of Connery’s concerns and issues with the franchise as well as the producers without necessarily taking sides.\n\nThe personalities of Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman permeate this book. In fact, I feel I have better sense of who those two individual men were as people than I did before reading it. Each of these men whose names have become synonymous with the James Bond film franchise has an early chapter devoted to them before the main crux of the book continues with a chapter devoted to each Bond film. As the narrative unfolds, the authors impart many subtle details and personality traits of each of these men along with the roles they took on as the partnership progressed. There are quirky details like Saltzman’s unenthusiastic reaction to Paul McCartney’s condition that he be the one to perform the song he wrote for Live and Let Die when Saltzman would have preferred Thelma Houston. Prior to that Cubby Broccoli described Ian Fleming’s disappointment at having had his meal pre-ordered for him at a restaurant in Turkey. The most fascinating chapter, however, is devoted to the ultimate breakup of their partnership after The Man with the Golden Gun. The complex details concerning the dissolution of their partnership are explored in a chapter the authors call “Two Scorpions in a Bottle – Broccoli vs Saltzman.” Here, we learn from Harry’s son Steven that film title designer Maurice Binder served as a “back-channel” between the two producers when they were most at odds. We also learn a great deal more about the circumstances that led to Harry Saltzman being forced to sell his shares and controlling interests to United Artists.\n\nSome Kind of Hero also gives us a very compelling look at some of the unsung heroes in the Bond franchise. Of particular note is Johanna Harwood whose screenwriting contributions remain largely unrecognized within Bond fan circles. The authors were\n\nlucky enough to sit down for an interview with Harwood, who has not frequently spoken publicly about her role in the Bond saga. She enters the story as Harry Saltzman’s assistant but her actual role was to write scripts. She described Saltzman’s personality at one point saying, “[His] big fault was that he was tactless. He was always rubbing people up the wrong way because he was saying things, unkind things but he wasn’t actually unkind. He never thought this might upset this person . . . He was an extraordinarily good salesman. If he had one really big quality, I would say it was he could sell anything. He could go off with an idea and sell it to anybody. What he couldn’t do later was develop the idea.”\n\nSaltzman first tasked Harwood with writing synopses of all the Ian Fleming books and it would appear that Harwood did a considerable amount of work prior to Richard Maibaum coming on board submitting her own scripts and developing early adaptations of Fleming material. She even wrote her own Bond short story called “Some Are Born Great.” Harwood went on to receive screenwriting credits on Dr. No and From Russia with Love but her work on Goldfinger remains uncredited. Although many of her contributions may have been changed by subsequent writers especially on From Russia with Love, the authors of Some Kind of Hero have done Bond fans a tremendous service by getting her story down and shedding light on the important role she played during the creative process of those early Bond films. Harwood also co-wrote EON’s early non-Bond movie during the sixties called Call Me Bwana.\n\nAlso of note are some of stories the authors have uncovered which have garnered media attention over the past several months. First there was the story of how Amy Winehouse might have done the theme song for Quantum of Solace were it not for her untimely death. David Arnold had “sketched out” some musical ideas leaving the lyrics for Winehouse to complete. The authors were also able to get Pierce Brosnan to unleash a few more details about his departure as Bond. Brosnan describes the phone call he received after his agent informed him that negotiations for him to star in his fifth Bond film had stopped. Brosnan told the authors that he “was utterly shocked and just kicked to the kerb with the way it went down.”\n\nAll in all Some Kind of Hero reads very swiftly despite its rather thick appearance. Although the book clocks in at over 700 pages, the main narrative is actually just over 600 pages with the notes and index taking up the last 100 pages. It could be read either from start to finish or one might decide to read chapter by chapter as you watch the films chronologically. I’m glad to have read it once all the way through, but I could easily see myself returning to Some Kind of Hero as I re-watch the Bond films re-reading each chapter that corresponds to whichever film I decide to put on. I feel like this book tells the story about the key people involved in the Bond saga better than most books on the subject. You get a real sense of the personalities involved, the various conflicts that ensued, and a rationale behind many of the decisions that were made. Each chapter in the Bond saga is given its due and although it’s obviously way too vast to convey the entire scope of this book into one review, it’s safe to say that I believe most Bond fans would benefit from reading Some Kind of Hero regardless of how well-versed they believe themselves to be regarding the history.\n\nReview by\n\nJack Lugo\n\nI originally posted this review over at the James Bond Radio podcast website but I recreated the review here for your convenience. You can find the original review posted over at jamesbondradio.com here: http://jamesbondradio.com/some-kind-of-hero-book-review-by-jack-lugo/?utm_content=bufferdc0eb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer\n\nWARNING: This review does contain major SPOILERS\n\nMy initial reaction leaving the movie theater after having watched SPECTRE was just, “Wow! That was brilliant,” and I pretty much wrote a Facebook post to that effect. Now, that I’ve had some time to process the film, I still believe it to be an exciting thrill ride of a movie with some reservations. The set pieces and action scenes were delightfully executed; the interplay between Bond and the MI6 cast gelled with some smart dialogue and onscreen chemistry; the numerous callbacks and the humor that came into play set a lighthearted tone that had been mostly missing from the Craig era Bond films; and the film generally seemed to fulfill the checklist of all the things I’ve wanted to see in a Bond movie. It was a fun movie-going experience that kept me entertained from beginning to end, however, as with any film you might enjoy, the more you over-analyze it, the more that analysis detracts from the actual enjoyment of it.\n\nThere’s something to be said for the phrase “movie magic.” The phrase has been around for as long as I can remember, and while it’s a phrase that suits most Bond films, it’s most applicable to SPECTRE. Just like a magic trick, SPECTRE is a film that works tremendously well from the perspective of an average spectator in the audience, one who isn’t at all concerned about how the trick is accomplished. It’s when you start to look at the same trick from different angles attempting to deconstruct it, that the “magic” disintegrates. When it comes to magic, there are two types of people. There are those people who just want to enjoy themselves and take in the spectacle and there are those people who just want to figure out how the trick is done, who ultimately relinquish whatever enjoyment might be gained from the brief suspension of disbelief in order to satisfy their own need to explain what their seeing . Neither way of viewing the spectacle of entertainment is necessarily wrong, but one way is perhaps more forgiving than the other. I propose that SPECTRE is a film that will find these two types of people divided and at odds.\n\nSPECTRE is a film that if you don’t think about it much, is absolutely stunning. It’s a visual feast from start to finish. The Mexico City pre-titles sequence alone is well worth the price of admission. I can’t recall a better opening sequence to any film within the Bond franchise or even outside of it. It’s absolutely fun to watch Daniel Craig weave in and out of the crowd with style and walking along the edges of rooftops with all the cool and composure we’ve come to expect from him. Once the helicopter comes into play and the fight onboard it goes into full swing, it’s just a pure adrenaline rush of excitement to behold.\n\nThe rest of the film doesn’t quite live up to the fluid tone established by the Mexico City sequence, but the action sequences in Austria and Rome deliver in their own unique ways. I think Monica Bellucci’s performance was definitely compelling, but they should have tried to find at least one additional scene for her character. The Rome car chase was fun to watch and the interjections of the phone call to Moneypenny and the old man in the Fiat didn’t distract too much\n\nI think the main criticism so far tends to be that the humor and call backs to previous Bond films were just a bit too much, perhaps too self-referential. I can understand where this is coming from to some degree. Craig’s Bond has thus far been a departure from the traditional cinematic Bond relying more on a grittier more down to earth portrayal that recalls the literary origins of the character. Casino Royale in particular greatly departed from the formula that had been established by all the Bond films that had preceded it and firmly established Craig as not just a “new” Bond but a rebooted Bond, an antihero apropos to the 21st century and influenced heavily by the darker more brooding direction that Christopher Nolan had explored in his Batman films. From Casino Royale through Skyfall, we get the sense that this “rough around the edges” Bond was different from all the prior Bonds because this was a Bond that hadn’t been fully formed. This allowed us to explore the emotional side of Bond as well as establish a traumatic past to tie to the character, a past rooted in the Fleming books but never fully explored to any degree in the films.\n\nIn SPECTRE, for the first time since Craig took over the role we have him playing the character of Bond as a fully formed archetype from beginning to end. This has its advantages as well as its disadvantages. On the positive side, we don’t have any of that slip in confidence that we see in the other films. Bond is as sure of himself as he’s ever been, and there’s never any sense of doubt that he’s going to execute just about every movement he makes precisely the way he wants and he comes across as smooth and suave as we’ve come to expect Bond to be. On the negative side, the sense of doubt about his abilities in Skyfall enabled the audience to identify with him more and root for him to become the Bond we all know and love by the end of the film. In Casino Royale we see Bond become vulnerable when he falls in love with Vesper and this gave the character of Bond more depth than we had been accustomed to seeing at that point. In SPECTRE, Bond isn’t vulnerable and he isn’t self-doubting so there’s no hook for the audience to identify with him. Craig is simply playing a character archetype who has already been fully formed and has already gone on an emotional journey in the three previous films. SPECTRE depends upon the audience to simply enjoy Craig playing Bond without any emotional stakes. I believe this to be the reason why the film has had many of the lukewarm reviews particularly in the United States. As a fan of Bond and someone who is very adamant about Craig’s portrayal of the character, I’ve always wondered what a “fully formed” Craig Bond film would look like, and that’s what this film delivers, however, there is a part of me that misses the Bond of the early Craig films who didn’t have it all figured out and who was prone to the occasional emotional meltdown especially when someone close to him died.\n\nThe other part of this film that has been heavily scrutinized is the reveal of Waltz’s Oberhauser as Blofeld along with the sloppily written explanation of his origins. I will admit that it’s probably the weakest part of the film. Generally, the strength of any Bond film relies heavily on the villain, and in the Bond franchise Blofeld is the ultimate nemesis for Bond. The legal battles surrounding the use of Blofeld and SPECTRE are all out there for fans to talk about and discuss, but putting all that aside, the way we finally get the reveal of Blofeld is admittedly a bit anticlimactic in SPECTRE. Waltz still gives a stellar chilling performance, but the exposition that they chose for him is rather clumsy and unbelievable even if it conveniently ties the Craig era films all together rather neatly. It’s just a little hard to swallow the concept that Bond and Blofeld were foster brothers, and that Waltz’s character became enraged at his own father’s attachment to Bond following the death of Bond’s parents. I almost wish they had come up with any other explanation for Blofeld’s connection to Bond, but I don’t think this misstep should taint the entire movie. The torture sequence inspired by the Kingsley Amis novel Col. Sun alone is enough justification to see past the mishandling of Blofeld’s origins. That torture sequence was genuinely scary and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It’s the only time in the entire movie where we feel Bond is actually in danger. It may seem cruel of me to say this, but I actually wish they had extended the torture sequence. Seeing Bond in distress for a bit longer would have added to the tension of that scene a bit more. We all know Bond was going to get out of it somehow, but it’s a scene that could have had the same effect as the chair and rope scene in Casino Royale. In that instance, Bond didn’t actually get out of it on his own, but here he does with help from Madeleine Swann.\n\nSpeaking of Madeleine Swann, I think Lea Seydoux gave us a pretty good performance, but the chemistry was far from the intensity of that between Craig and Eva Green in Casino Royale. Though it seemed to fall a bit short of the mark, I do believe that both Bond and Madeleine fall in love even if I’m not totally convinced that Bond would leave the Secret Service to start a new life with her as he was prepared to do with Vesper.\n\nOf course, this leaves open the possibility of Seydoux’s return, which I’m actually very excited about. Is it possible that Madeleine will be a Tracy-like figure for Craig’s Bond? One direction I can see this going in if Craig returns for Bond 25 is that Blofeld escapes and kills Madeleine leading to the ultimate Bond revenge film that we’ve been waiting for since the end of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Given EON’s recent penchant for cashing in on the missed opportunities of Bond, I can easily see Bond 25 turning into the equivalent of what Diamonds are Forever could have been had George Lazenby remained in the role as Bond. Perhaps, they might even go back to the Fleming roots and craft a story more similar to the Fleming You Only Live Twice novel. Those two possibilities excite me very much because I think it’s the kind of story Bond fans have wanted for a long time. I could even imagine the pre-titles sequence of Bond 25 being the wedding of Bond and Madeleine juxtaposed with Blofeld’s escape and her eventual death as they embark on their honeymoon. Just thinking of that gives me chills.\n\nOverall, I have to say I still love SPECTRE. It’s a brilliant, fun, and engaging Bond film, but it’s a Bond film that you have to sort of surrender yourself to. You have to be the type of person who enjoys a good magic trick without fussing over the details over how the magician achieves his sleight of hand. The minute you look where you’re not supposed to look, you’ll risk being disappointed. I, for one, plan to keep my gaze firmly at the center of screen. It’s a Bond movie and I had fun watching it. That’s all that matters.\n\nAuthor’s note: I originally wrote this piece for the James Bond Radio podcast site. I’ve recreated the post here for your review.\n\nLast year, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to produce a James Bond comic\n\nfrom Ian Fleming Publications. They hired Eagle Award winning author Warren Ellis to write the story and Jason Masters to produce the artwork, and the result is the highly anticipated first new James Bond comic since an incompleted Goldeneye adaptation by Topps Comics in 1996. Prior to that James Bond had a long history in the comics medium that still remains mostly unknown to casual fans. In actuality, James Bond had existed as a comic strip character nearly 4 years before Sean Connery immortalized the role in the first James Bond film Dr. No. From 1958 to 1983, the Daily Express and the Daily Star carried the James Bond comic strip initially adapting the classic Ian Fleming canon and then publishing original Bond adventures once the Fleming material had been exhausted. While I haven’t had the opportunity to examine these original comic strip adaptations of the Fleming stories, they have managed to receive high praise, and there are many who admire the effort that when into adapting Fleming stories that have otherwise been vastly altered in their cinematic presentations by EON.\n\nAlthough the timing of this new endeavor to return Bond to the comic medium is meant to coincide with the release of SPECTRE, Ellis has wisely created a new and independent Bond universe with the release of VARGR. Although I have an idea of where they might be going with the title, I’m still not absolutely sure of the title’s significance other than the fact that it sounds almost nothing like a Bond title. Despite lacking a proper Bondian title, all the other elements we could expect to look for in a Bond comic are present in this 1st of 6 issues. The events take place in the present day, but there is definitely a very cool retro vibe that works very well for the comic, and so far there’s a good balance between classic light hearted Bond elements that we’ve come to enjoy from the films and a bit of noir influenced dark grittiness fans of Dalton and Craig will appreciate.\n\nIssue #1 is meant to be a bit of a table setter. It starts off with what can only be regarded as the comic book equivalent of a pre-credits sequence. We are introduced to a nefarious man running away presumably from Bond. When Bond appears, they struggle and fight. Bond kills him in cold blood leaving him dead in the snow. We learn that this man had killed 008 and Bond had been tasked with a revenge mission to take him out.\n\nSoon after, we get to MI6 headquarters with a brief flirting with Miss Moneypenny and a mission briefing in M’s office. As we know, the cinematic franchise has cast black British actress Naomi Harris in the role of Miss Moneypenny beginning with Skyfall (2012). In VARGR, not only is Miss Moneypenny portrayed as a British black woman, M is also portrayed as a British black man for the very first time. It’s a development that I believe works very well, and I should hope that more opportunities for racial diversity in the franchise continue. The M scene plays out very much like it has many times already in the classic Bond cannon. The dialogue is smart and tightly wound. We get the sense that M is slightly overworked and eager to send Bond along on his mission, which involves him taking over a case 008 had originally been assigned. Bond is to undermine the efforts of a drug dealer and prevent him from importing a new dangerous drug to the UK.\n\nThe mission sends him to Berlin with the caveat that he must adhere to a new piece of legislation forbidding MI6 agents from carrying weapons within their home country. Arrangements must be made for Bond to acquire his gun once he reaches Berlin, but this issue doesn’t get quite that far. Before Bond heads off, he must see his quartermaster of course! This time Ellis has chosen to go with the older gentleman in a laboratory rather than with the Mendes incarnation young wiz-kid type. I suppose it’s meant as a bit of a throwback to the Q we had grown used to for decades although this incarnation of Q is more physically reminiscent of John Cleese than Desmond Llewellyn. The Q scene is quite fun and Ellis seems to instinctively know how to get the right chemistry going between these two characters.\n\nWe are also treated to Bond having lunch with Bill Tanner before going on the mission, which is something I think many hardcore Bond fans will enjoy as we are reminded of the friendship that Bond has with Tanner that up to Skyfall hasn’t made it into the films. Kingsley Amis’ Bond continuation novel, Col. Sun, probably has given us the best portrayal of this friendship within the Bond literary cannon.\n\nI apologize if I’ve given away too many details, but as I’ve said before this issue is all about setting up a larger plot and reintroducing us to this new conception of the Bond universe. Much of the actual plot and intrigue hasn’t even started yet. The issue is very brief but it does what it needs to do and it’s very easy for a reader to get immersed in this new incarnation of Bond, an incarnation that many would argue is long overdue. VARGR is a promising start to what looks to be a thrilling entry in Bond’s return to the comic medium. Ellis and Masters have created a comic that is quintessentially Bond. I look forward to the next 5 issues with keen interest.\n\nI recommend pre-ordering the comic through Dynamite’s Dynamic Forces website. The comic should be available at most newsstand retail outlets.\n\nAuthor’s note: I originally wrote this piece for the James Bond Radio podcast site. I’ve recreated the post here for your review."
