        "text": "Joe Carnahan’s existential thriller transcends its pulpy concept of a group of oil riggers stranded in the mountains of Alaska being picked off one by one to become much more than TAKEN with wolves. Anchored by Liam Neeson at his most raw and human, supported by a memorable cast of character actors and a bleak, haunting tone, THE GREY is one of the most harrowing adventures films of the last ten years. Eschewing the snarky humour of his most famous films SMOKIN ACES and THE A TEAM, Carnahan does for survival films what his 2002 film NARC did for the undercover cop movie: adding a tragic, philosophical bent to a straightforward genre narrative. THE GREY is an unbearably tense tale that feels more like a Werner Herzog film than your typical action adventure, depicting flawed men, hopelessly battling against the indifferent cruelty of their environment and being faced with their inevitable doom. CALL OF THE WILD this ain’t.\n\nTHE PLOT: John Ottway (Liam Neeson), a lonely and suicidal man, works as a marksman for an Alaskan oil company, tasked with shooting any wild wolves that threaten the company’s workers. When a plane that the workers are travelling in crashes into the frozen wilderness, the survivors including Ottway, the anti authoritarian Diaz (Frank Grillo) and mild mannered family man Talget (Dermot Mulroney) are attacked by a pack of feral wolves. Attempting to walk back to civilisation through treacherous landscape and unforgiving weather,the men are slowly picked off one by one by their relentless canine pursuers. Each man must come to terms with the failures of their lives and deal with their own mortality as nature closes in on them.\n\nThere seems to be two Joe Carnahans: the impish, Tarantino imitator who made the entertaining but slight comedy thrillers SMOKIN ACES, STRETCH and BLOOD,GUTS, BULLETS AND OCTANE and the director of NARC and THE GREY. These last two films mentioned are subversions of typically macho genres, the undercover cop drama and the wilderness adventure movie respectively. Carnahan keeps the traditional elements of these genres but makes the characters more three dimensional, more human, the violence more brutal and harrowing. THE GREY takes what would normally be expected in a wilderness survival movie for example resourceful, macho characters overcoming obstacles and battling predators with courage and physical prowess and adds a philosophical bent along with an existential bleakness. One of the ways he achieves this is spending time giving the characters more shades than would usually be expected in this type of film. The screenplay, co-written by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers ( writer of the short story “Ghost Walker” on which this film is based) eschews the usual macho stereotypes usually seen in the adventure genre. The supporting characters, memorably realised by an assortment of talented character actors, are vividly drawn and the bulk of the film is built around the conflict between the misfit group of survivors and the characters conflicts within themselves. Diaz, played by an excellent Frank Grillo, starts the film as a cynical rebel, thumbing his nose at any kind of authority, wearing his hard man credentials on his sleeve. Naturally, Diaz bristles against the leadership of Ottway and slowly his posturing is revealed to be nothing more than armour to protect him from his own sadness at the emptiness of his life and his fear of death. Ottway is ostensibly the hero of the film but his is much more human and flawed than we have come to expect. The theme of a self-hating and suicidal man who has given up on life and finding some kind of redemption through his attempts to save others is perhaps not a novel one but rarely has it been so powerfully wrought as in THE GREY. Carnahan depicts Ottway as all too human, unsure of the best course of action, liable to lose his temper or make rash decisions. Ultimately Ottway becomes a tragic, existential hero: unable to save the lives of his co-workers, struggling to find resolution to the accumulative tragedies of his life, too insignificant to hold back the dismal tide. This all comes to head in the forceful climax as Ottway, now truly alone with no hope of survival rails against God, screaming at the sky, receiving no answer, no salvation. This leads into the polarising final scene, where Ottway finds that he was actually leading his team not away from the wolves’ den but actually straight into it ( another subversion of the infallible action hero trope). Many movie goers were frustrated at the seeming lack of resolution of the climax, where an unarmed Ottway makes the decision to stand and fight against impossible odds, However the outcome of the final fight is a foregone conclusion. It’s not important whether Ottway dies or not, but the fact that he will fight for whatever life he has left and will not go quietly into the good night.\n\nThe way that Carnahan depicts death and the characters reaction to it, is another reason THE GREY is so haunting. The thematic drive of the film is essentially how these supposedly hard men face their own mortality in a cruel and uncaring environment. Some die savagely, ripped apart by wolves as they scream in agony and fear. Another dies peacefully, eased into it by the calm, Zen like tones of Ottway as he exsanguinates. Another simply gives up convincing the other survivors to leave him sitting on a rock as he explains that he is in too much pain to continue and doesn’t have much of a life to return to anyway. In the most upsetting death in a film full of such moments, one character drowns in shallow water, dying more of panic than anything else. Carnahan frames the shot in profile allowing us to see how tantalisingly close to the surface the character is, visualising the film’s ideas around the fragility of life and how vulnerable we are to knife edge turns of fate. Carnahan uses these moments to comment on the unpleasant truth that no matter how strong, how courageous and how capable we are, there is no escaping the inevitable. Death is doubly terrifying in this film, as demonstrated in the scene where Neeson cries to an absent God, there seems to be no hope of an afterlife.\n\nThe film is not without its simple pleasures however. Carnahan stages a few tense set pieces, the standouts being the initial air crash, shot in impressionistic, terrifying bursts of action and the vertigo inducing scene where the survivors must traverse a drop over a 100 ft ravine. This scene includes some terrifyingly subjective shots, using some convincing bluescreen, to place us precariously with the characters as they agonisingly inch there way across a makeshift rope bridge with nothing but jagged rocks below. The film has some impressively oppressive shots of the desolate Alaskan wilderness and Carnahan uses a gritty, handheld style similar to the one he used in NARC, rather than the visual frippery seen in his other films. The film also has a kind of gallows humour that breaks up some of the dark atmosphere, Frank Grillo especially has more than a few sardonic lines and Carnahan has fun skewering the macho posturing of the survivors. There is also an interesting symbolic link between the human characters and the wolves. In one scene, the group hear the pack of wolves infighting and Ottway explains that the Alpha male is putting down a challenge for leadership from one of the other males. In the very next scene, a frustrated and frightened Diaz challenges Ottway to a fight, which Ottway effortlessly wins. Ottway is the alpha putting down a challenge to his position as group leader. In a later scene this is made explicit, when the wolves howl at the humans and they shout back, Diaz calling out ” you’re not the animals, we’re the animals.” In the final scene where Ottway comes face to face with the Alpha of the wolf pack, who is scarred on his face similarly to Ottway. Carnahan frames their close ups in exactly the same way, visually linking the two. The very final shot of the film has the growls of the wolf heard offscreen, superimposed over the image of Ottway grimacing. These moments seem to show that Carnahan is making a link between the humans and wolves, perhaps suggesting that when everything else, family, society etc is stripped away we are at the mercy of the cruelty of nature in the same way animals are, although we are cursed with the knowledge of our own mortality and our desire for some kind of meaning in this indifferent world.\n\nTHE GREY was not a box office success, perhaps due to the trailers portraying the film as an all out action film, ridiculously making out that the film would consist of Liam Neeson punching wolves. No wonder audiences were disappointed when they were presented with something else entirely: a haunting, brutal drama about flawed, unlikeable men who are faced with the reality of their own deaths and struggling to find some kind of peace with their demons. This is why THE GREY deserves reappraisal, few Hollywood action movies attempt the kind of philosophical and emotional depth that Carnahan achieves here, thanks to a thought provoking script, taut filmmaking and a powerful, visceral central performance by Neeson. And yes, a scene where he punches a wolf.\n\nA full decade before he helped to launch the current comic book movie craze with the megahit SPIDER-MAN in 2002, director Sam Raimi made his first foray into the superhero genre with 1990’s DARKMAN. Unlike the family friendly webslinger, DARKMAN is, appropriately enough given his name, a more sinister, harder edged character and has as much in common with classic monster movies like FRANKENSTEIN and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA as he does BATMAN. Thanks to Raimi’s trademark energetic camerawork and penchant for dark humour as well as an unusually deranged performance from a young Liam Neeson, DARKMAN is a witty, entertaining cult classic that is as wild and unhinged as its hero.\n\nTHE PLOT: Mild mannered scientist Dr Peyton Westlake( Liam Neeson, TAKEN, SCHINDLER’S LIST) is working on creating synthetic skin but so far his efforts can only last in the dark- light destroys the artificial skin. Westlake’s girlfriend Julie (Frances McDormand, FARGO) a lawyer working for property developer Strack( Colin Friels), discovers a memorandum that shows Strack’s links to organised crime. Strack sends gangster Durant (Larry Drake, LA LAW), to retrieve the document from Westlake’s apartment/lab. Durant and his men attack Westlake and blow up his lab with him inside. Now hideously deformed and following an experimental medical treatment which means he can no longer feel pain, regulate his emotions and has augmented strength, Westlake becomes DARKMAN, using his synthetic skin to infiltrate Durant’s operation hoping to both exact revenge and rekindle his relationship with Julie. However, Westlake finds that his monstrousness may not be only skin deep.\n\nSam Raimi was something of a wonderkind, making his cinematic debut at the tender age of twenty-one with the controversial horror comedy THE EVIL DEAD in 1981. Although that film was initially lumped in with the video nasties of the early Eighties, THE EVIL DEAD was clearly the work of a singular talent, with impressive special effects and comic book style compositions along with a streak of black humour missing from the likes of THE DRILLER KILLER and NIGHTMARE IN A DAMAGED BRAIN. In 1987 Raimi made the slightly larger budgeted sequel/remake EVIL DEAD II: DEAD BY DAWN, a seminal horror comedy with a pitch perfect blend of comic book style action, gruesomely goofy make up effects and motored by the charismatic Bruce Campbell’s slapstick central performance. After the success of the two EVIL DEAD movies and looking to capitalise on the success of Tim Burton’s 1989 version of BATMAN, Raimi approached the studios with the plan to direct a superhero film. However, after his pitch for the rights to make a film based on THE SHADOW was rejected, Raimi decided to create his own superhero. Working with his brother Ivan, the two Raimis came up with the character of DARKMAN, a scientist who has been horrifically deformed but can assume the identities of anyone thanks to his invention of synthetic skin. Working with his largest budget to date and higher profile actors like Frances McDormand and Liam Neeson as the titular hero ( although Raimi’s original plan to cast his EVIL DEAD star Bruce Campbell as the lead was nixed by the studio) Raimi manages to blend his own somewhat anarchic style with the expectations of a studio action film.\n\nDARKMAN is an excellent showcase for Raimi’s idiosyncratic talents and the attributes that elevated his SPIDER-MAN trilogy to the top tier of superhero movies are present and correct here. Raimi has mastery of tone, much like his close friends the Coen Brothers ( who co-wrote THE HUDSUCKER PROXY with Raimi), he seems to be able effortlessly shift gears from slapstick comedy, high tragedy and horror and back again. The decision to have his central character being unable to regulate his emotions is a smart move, which allows Raimi to justify the whiplash flips in tone as if the film itself is suffering from the same affliction as its hero. For the casual moviegoer perhaps this is a flaw ( and the film was not a huge success with audiences on its release) since the film does lurch from moments of tragic romance played deadly straight to moments of reasonably intense violence( the villain cuts the fingers off his victim’s hands with a cigar cutter), to slapstick pratfalls. The sequence at the fairground, where Westlake attempts to return to normality, hiding his deformity under artificial skin whilst on a date with Julie is a prime example. The sequence starts fairly conventionally, depicting the two tragic lovers on a stroll through a carnival, although something is off from the start. Raimi cuts between Neeson and McDormand and creepy shots of dead-eyed animatronic puppets, who seem to be laughing maniacally. As the scene continues depicting Westlake’s altercation with a cheating carny that escalates from absurdist humour- “the pink elephant if you please?” – to an collage of insanity, Raimi ramps up the surrealism with dutch angles, unsettling stop motion shots of stuffed animals coming to life and a bizarre shot utilising front projection depicting Westlake’s unchecked murderous rage. Sequences like these demonstrate Raimi’s unique gifts: his extraordinary understanding of the technical possibilities of cinema and how those techniques can be used to both thrill an audience and depict the subjective emotional states of the characters.\n\nRaimi is ably assisted in this tonal high wire act by his game cast who understand that the film is essentially a live action cartoon and modulate their performances accordingly. Liam Neeson is usually associated with playing more serious and quiet roles, even when he stars in shoot-em-up action films like TAKEN and NON-STOP, has rarely tried to tap into the vaudevillian energy needed for a film like DARKMAN. Neeson is unsurprisingly convincing in the more dramatic scenes, giving the tragic nature of the character real heft. However, although Neeson gives his all in the more comedic sequences, he never seems fully relaxed enough to give the truly demented performance the film requires. Neeson is not a natural comedian ( see his awkward line deliveries in THE LEGO MOVIE and TED 2) and as an actor his energy is naturally calmer than what is necessary to play a mad scientist emotionally flip flopping from bottomless despair to uncontrollable rage and back again. The lead role was originally written with EVIL DEAD star Bruce Campbell in mind and he would have been ideal for such an unhinged, unpredictable character. McDormand seems more comfortable in her role perhaps due to her experience working with the Coen Brothers, whose films require similar skills to those needed for a Raimi film. She is a lot tougher than your usual love interest seen in the late 80s/ early 90s comic book movies although her character is somewhat underwritten and perhaps is the victim of rumoured studio editorial interference. Together Neeson and McDormand help to give the film some kind of emotional resonance, selling the Phantom of the Opera style tragedy of the romance. The villains have much more fun that the central duo, particularly Larry Drake as the somewhat effete but brutal gangster Durant and Australian actor Colin Friels as Strack. Friels is particularly memorable as the megalomaniacal property developer Strack, affecting an impressive American accent and especially in the third act, cranking his performance up to 11. Friels is undoubtedly over the top but that fits with the cartoonish tone of the film and its a shame that the actor never made it in Hollywood, instead returning to Australian TV in shows like cop drama WATER RATS.\n\nDARKMAN also sees Raimi work with crew members who would become frequent collaborators in future projects. Cinematographer Bill Pope gives the film a slick, moody comic book sheen that would become his trademark in films like THE MATRIX and Raimi’s SPIDER-MAN 2. The composer Danny Elfman would also provide the score for future Raimi films like SPIDER-MAN, ARMY OF DARKNESS( AKA EVIL DEAD 3) and A SIMPLE PLAN. However, Elfman’s work on DARKMAN is unfortunately one of the weak points of the film. The score fits the mock Gothic style of DARKMAN but sounds almost indistinguishable from his work on BATMAN and DICK TRACY, all Wagner-lite sturm and drang and faux opera stylings. Elfman’s career peaked in 1989 with BATMAN and his bouncy, carnivalesque theme tune for THE SIMPSONS but his scores since seem to alternate between variations on these two (brilliant) pieces.\n\nDARKMAN was not a box office success and these could be attributed to a number of factors. The lack of name recognition of the central character, due to him being an original creation is one reason. Another is the seemingly confused conception if the film, perhaps a consequence of the tensions between the studio and the independently minded Raimi. Is the film a tragic monster movie? Or a campy superhero movie? DARKMAN as a concept seems like it should be aimed at adolescents but the film was rated 18 in the UK due to swearing, scenes of violence and its gruesome make up effects. Raimi’s unique everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to tone in his movies often seems to sit uneasily with mainstream audiences, who tend to prefer their movies to be either serious or silly, never both at once. He did refine his skills enough to have two well received and commercially successful SPIDER-MAN films, which managed to strike the balance between goofy comedy and heartfelt coming of age drama. However, even those films are held in less esteem by many current film fans, often being dismissed as “cheesy” or “camp”. Admittedly Raimi’s sure touch deserted him with the bloated SPIDER-MAN 3, but this dismissal of the director’s unique brand of pop comic book stylings is Hollywood’s loss. Raimi hasn’t made a film since 2013’s flop OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL and seems to be in director’s jail. This is nothing short of a tragedy.\n\nDARKMAN is a deliriously entertaining mix of arch romance, impish humour and comic book action. Thanks to Raimi’s unique brand of action-comedy and his talents with juggling extreme tonal shifts and energetic filmmaking style, DARKMAN is a cult classic, an artefact from a time when superhero movies had a sense of style and edge. Undoubtedly flawed and perhaps too dated and camp for the casual movie goer but a treat for both fans of off the wall comic book stories and Raimi’s sadly underrated but undeniable filmmaking abilities.\n\nWriter/director Leigh Whannell brings HG Wells classic character right up to date by reimagining the story as a high tech sci-fi version of woman-in-peril genre; a kind of SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY meets PREDATOR, which is elevated thanks to a forceful performance from Elizabeth Moss (US. THE HANDMAID’S TALE), slick, icy cinematography and a sharp rethink of the original concept, which taps into very modern concerns as psychologically abusive relationships and the violent consequences of the male ego. Much like the best remakes (THE THING, THE FLY) Whannell takes the concept of the original story and the title and makes everything else his own, spinning an entirely new story from an iconic idea.\n\nTHE PLOT: Cecilia Kass (Moss) escapes from the high tech compound of her abusive, controlling partner Adrian Griffin( Oliver Jackson-Cohen) , who is also a billionaire optics expert,and goes into hiding with the help of her sister Emily ( Harriet Dyer) . Whilst living in secret with Emily ‘s police officer friend James( Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid) , Cecilia is relieved to learn that Adrian has committed suicide following their breakup. However, Cecilia begins to notice strange events that suggest that somehow Adrian is still alive; objects disappear and reappear and she can feel the presence of someone watching her. Cecilia’s fears are dismissed by those around, who believe she is showing signs of understandable trauma caused by years of Adrian’s psychological abuse. Soon Cecilia learns the truth that Adrian has found a way to keep a threat he made to her; that if she ever left him he would find her and “she would never be able to see him coming.”\n\nLeigh Whannell has been a presence in low -to-mid budget horror movies since the early 2000’s when he wrote and starred in SAW, directed by his friend James Wan. SAW became a surprise critical and commercial smash hit and Whannell was involved in a producing capacity in the series of (less well received but financially successful) sequels. Whannell made his directing debut with INSIDIOUS 3 ( he wrote the previous two films in that series) but made a bigger impact with UPGRADE, a gory, eighties inspired sci-fi action thriller that made the most of its limited budget. THE INVISIBLE MAN came to Whannell after the studio Universal scrapped their plans for a MCU style Dark Universe after the disastrous remake of THE MUMMY starring Tom Cruise. Thanks to his background in stretching budgets to make his films look more expensive than they actually are (achieved by filming in his native Australia utilising local crews and unknown actors), Whannell found a novel wAy of revamping the central conceit of THE INVISIBLE MAN. Rather than follow HG Wells’ original story of a scientist who invents a serum that makes him invisible and eventually loses his moral compass when he realises that he can get away with anything, Whannell makes the film a metaphor for an abusive relationship. Whannell, like the greatest horror filmmakers, understands that the horror works best when it touches on real life fears, not just monsters and vengeful spirits. In his version of THE INVISIBLE MAN, Whannell uses the hot button topic of sexual harassment and abuse, as well as the way that society often ignores the complaints and fears of women. Adrian is the worst person to be given access to an invisibility suit and now he can carry on his psychological torture and power trips over Cecilia and it is Cecilia’s worse nightmare come to life, as she can never escape from his clutches and never know when he is watching her. Whannell makes the phenomenon of “gaslighting”, a form of abuse where the victim is made to feel as though they are going insane and imagining the cruelty that is being inflicted on them, part of the plot, where Cecilia has no proof that Adrian is still stalking her and setting her up for crimes that she does not commit. Much of the tension of the film comes from the paranoia of Cecilia’s character and her isolation from those around her.\n\nWhannell also makes expert use of the skills he learnt working in the horror genre by orchestrating some perfectly executed scenes of tension and jump scares. From the very beginning of the film, during Cecilia’s night time escape from Adrian’s prison-like mansion, Whannell establishes the recurring visual conceit of static shots of empty corridors and close up shots framed off-centre with plenty of negative space. This instils the idea in the audience that something invisible is lurking in these apparently empty spaces, building the tension to gut churning levels. There is also one expertly timed jump scare halfway through the film and in one impressively choreographed one shot sequence where Cecilia is attacked by the unseen attacker, thrown around like a rag doll around her kitchen. These moments are reminiscent of a haunted house movie, much like POLTERGEIST or Whannell’s own INSIDIOUS series. Its a fun, sci-fi update of the ghost movie and one of Whannell’s canniest ideas is to remove any doubt early on that there is a supernatural element to the story or to cheaply play the idea that Cecilia is imagining the events.\n\nElizabeth Moss has steadily been amassing an impressive career on television with solid performances in MAD MEN, TOP OF THE LAKE and THE HANDMAID’S TALE, and THE INVISIBLE MAN should firmly establish her as a big screen lead. Moss is charismatic and convincing throughout and much of the power of the film comes in Cecilia’s transformation from the terrified, traumatised victim to fierce, empowered survivor. By the end of the film Moss has almost take on a Ripley-style steeliness as Cecilia takes on her tormentors head on. The rest of the cast are fine, Michael Dorman is creepy as Adrian’s snivelling brother Tom whilst Reid and Hodge have some nice comic moments. Whannell makes an interesting choice with Jackson- Cohen’s performance as Adrian. Appropriately for playing THE INVISIBLE MAN, Jackson-Cohen barely features for much of the movie. When he does he convincing gives an air of male entitlement and arrogance but Whannell made the interesting choice not to explicitly show his abusive behaviour, correctly assuming the audience can infer from the desperation of Cecilia’s escape in the opening sequence Adrian’s true monsterousness.\n\nWhannell does make a few missteps in THE INVISIBLE MAN but none that derail the film. The film is a little too long and there a few moments where the film seems to repeat itself. Much like UPGRADE, Whannell adds a last minute twist that attempts to add some ambiguity to what has just occurred and whilst this is less disruptive than it was in UPGRADE, it feels unnecessary and perhaps is due to Whannell’s seeming attempts to replicate the shock ending of SAW (Much like M Night Shymalan’s debilitating obsession with topping the twist at the end of THE SIXTH SENSE.)\n\nVERDICT: Leigh Whannell has made slick, scary and sharp remake of HG Wells’ classic story and THE INVISIBLE MAN certainly earns its place in the pantheon of remakes that are actually an improvement over the original movies. Thanks to some icy camerawork, expertly built tension and a powerful central performance from Elizabeth Moss, Whannell has given THE INVISIBLE MAN a smart update that unlike many other slick Hollywood horrors also works as a chilling comment on real life fears; in this case the real world horrors of stalking, abusive relationships and the powerlessness felt by women in a world dominating by the controlling impulses of the male ego.\n\nTHEMES\n\nMcTiernan seems to have used PREDATOR as a testing ground for the themes he would explore in DIE HARD and the ideas he would use to dismantle the typical Eighties action film and move the genre into the Nineties with the Bruce Willis classic. Not only in terms of the aesthetics discussed already but in the themes of political critique and the skewering of the macho. Much has been made of PREDATOR as an allegory of the Vietnam War and there have been several essays and Youtube videos on the subject. The parallels are obvious: American soldiers sent into the jungle on a mission where the objective is not clear and is morally compromised by political intrigue, where they are picked off by an unseen, unstoppable enemy using guerrilla tactics. The mid-Eighties led to resurgence in Vietnam War movies but unlike the films that depicted that conflict in the 1970s (COMING HOME, THE DEER HUNTER), the 80s Vietnam’s films often seemed to find solutions for the flaws of the war. RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART 2 basically restaged the war, allowing Rambo to defy his superiors’ motives to rescue abandoned POWs and defeat the North Vietnamese Army (and their Soviet backers.)ALIENS suggested that if the military was allowed to use the full force of their arsenal (one of the conservative criticisms of the Vietnam War was that the US was fighting with one hand tied behind its back) and rooted out the bad apples in the industrial-military complex the “good guys” can annihilate the enemy. PLATOON and HAMBURGER HILL illustrated the futility and misguided objectives of the war. Perhaps it was the fact that enough time had passed for some of the psychological and social wounds of the war had begun to heal and/or the bombastic optimism of the Reagan administration, that audiences and filmmaker seemed ready to explore and try to confront the perceived mistakes of the Vietnam War.\n\nPREDATOR also critiques both the objectives and the execution of the military campaign. The character of Dillon (played by Carl Weathers), an old friend of Dutch’s and now an CIA operative who has master minded the rescue/assassination mission, is depicted for much of the movie as the secondary villain. He is portrayed as slippery, secretive and totally out of his depth. He is mistrusted and mocked by the rest of the team, he struggles to physically keep up with the battle hardened heroes and it is eventually revealed that he has lied and manipulated Dutch into carrying out the mission. Dillon stands as a symbol for the morally questionable military-industrial complex whose machinations some felt where responsible for the failings of the war. Dutch and his men stand for the “Good soldiers” that are lied to about the operations true objectives and are morally just in their actions. In the opening scene, Dillon asks Dutch why he has rejected previous missions at the request of the CIA and Dutch responds:\n\n“We are a rescue team, not assassins.”\n\nWhen the mission’s true objective is revealed, that they are not there to rescue diplomats captured by guerrillas but to take out a Communist army about to launch a military coup, Dutch admonishes Dillon for his subterfuge. It is suggested that Dillon, and the shady characters he symbolises, who is responsible for the failures of the war, not “true” soldiers like Dutch. Dillon tries to explain the moral complexities of his motivations but this falls on deaf ears.\n\nDUTCH: What happened to you, Dillon? You used to someone I could trust.\n\nDILLON: I woke up. So should you.\n\nBut the film suggests that Dillon (and those like him) are the ones that need to wake up. Dillon is given redemption of sorts, when he joins forces with the team, setting aside his differences for his own survival and dies in an attempt to hold off the Predator so Dutch can escape. PREDATOR suggests that if those at the top, the ones making the decisions would act like “good” soldiers that disasters like the Vietnam War would not happen.\n\nMcTiernan and the writers also suggest another way that the Vietnam War could have been won. The character of the Predator could be taken as a symbolic representation of the Viet Cong, an enemy who is invisible, blending in with its surroundings, use guerrilla tactics and sneak attacks to psychologically batter its enemies. Much like James Cameron’s 1986 film ALIENS, which also used its creature as a metaphor for the Viet Cong, the use of monstrous aliens as representations of the North Vietnamese is problematic. The Predator is coded as something Other, as ethnic, with its dreadlock like tendrils and tribal attire. (PREDATOR 2 actually carried on this theme of racial coding to the character, set in a futuristic LA boiling over with racial tension.)PREDATOR offers a solution to the failures of the Vietnam War in that Dutch eventually defeats the Predator by learning from his enemy. When Dutch is left as the only survivor of his team and decide to take on the alien one on one, he abandons his previous attempts of fighting the creature head on and the scorched earth approach seen in the earlier mini gun scene, where the team level a whole area of jungle with their heavy weaponry. In the final act, Dutch copies the tactics of the Predator, after discovering that by covering himself in the clay like jungle mud he is invisible to the alien’s heat vision. Dutch creates his own primitive weapons- bows and arrows, spears and traps- whilst using the foliage to blend in with his surroundings. That’s right; Dutch has become a Viet Cong soldier, using guerrilla tactics to take out a technologically superior enemy. Dutch even appears like a VC guerrilla, with his mud covered camouflage. It’s an incredible reversal, as McTiernan depicts the American soldier coded as a Viet Cong guerrilla.\n\nPREDATOR AND THE MACHO\n\nThis leads to the final theme I will discuss.; McTiernan’s skewering of the overblown machismo of the Eighties action movie. The Eighties was the era of the body builder and the action hero of the time was defined by being the definition of hyper masculinity. The biggest stars were the biggest men; physically imposing men with the bodies of an Adonis and limited acting ability. No one could claim that Schwarzenegger, Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lungren were particularly great thespians but they weren’t required to be. These heroes didn’t show emotion or vulnerabilities, they were killing machines that would crack a joke whilst cracking bad guy’s spines. Schwarzenegger’s signature role as THE TERMINATOR even saw him playing a literal killing machine. Even protagonists who didn’t quite fit this physical mould like Sigourney Weaver in ALIENS or Peter Weller in ROBOCOP, used armour and heavy firepower to become an invulnerable machine. Perhaps this was a reflection of the way Reagan era America now saw itself: big, bad and unstoppable. At first PREDATOR seems to be taking this image to the extreme. McTiernan fetishizes the bodies of the pumped up cast, with numerous shots of their naked, sweaty torsos. The director leans into the homoerotic charge that is latent in this era and PREDATOR features such loving shots of men’s bodies that they would look out of place in Kenneth Anger’s avant-garde Queer classic SCORPIO RISING. There is undoubtedly some gay subtext in the film, with this close knit group of men who are resistant to outsiders (the team are suspicious and threatening towards Dillon) and the incredibly close relationship between Mac and Blain hints at something more than just being brothers in arms. Mac weeps and grieves for Blain, tenderly standing vigil over his body and is driven to a deranged quest for vengeance. The relationship between Dillon and Dutch share these homoerotic undertones. Perhaps it is due to Schwarzenegger’s limited expressiveness as an actor that when he sees Dillon in the first scene his reaction is more reminiscent of someone greeting an old flame. When Dillon betrays Dutch there is the overtones of a betrayal in a relationship given Dutch’s hurt reaction. In the final scene before Dillon’s death, when Dillon finally proves that he is a heroic, “good” soldier, they gaze at each other as Dillon’s sweaty, undulating midriff is exposed. Dutch even throws Dillon a phallic gun as he leaves. There is also the fact that a woman is brought into the cast of characters, a prisoner from the rebel camp called Anna (Elpidia Carrilo), the team reluctantly bring her along and only do so under the orders of Dillon. It is telling that there is no sexual tension between the team and Anna, with the only exception being a brief scene where Anna smiles flirtingly at Poncho (Richard Chaves), however this is only as a prelude to an escape attempt. Dutch and the others seem uninterested in her as a sexual object or even for the most in anyway. It is only when she shares her knowledge of the Predator that the men start to show any interest in her and by the end of the film Dutch (almost) see her as an equal. This homoerotic tension and lack of heterosexual desire in the characters has also lead to some reading the film as an AIDS allegory. In the mid to late Eighties the AIDS crisis gripped America and undoubtedly the societal anxiety regarding the disease was reflected in the cinema of the time (Croneberg’s THE FLY is the definitive text of AIDS metaphors in Eighties horror). There are some elements in PREDATOR that do fit with an AIDS allegory reading, the (for the most part) all male cast are attacked by an unseen, unstoppable enemy that brings certain death despite the characters physical strength. (I’m aware that this is a reductive view of the AIDS crisis, the disease was an equal opportunity killer but in the media it was often coded as a “gay plague.”) I’m not sure this was intentional in the way that some of the other themes are and the reading doesn’t quite hold water as there is little to code the Predator as a disease although perhaps the way the alien is coded as foreign or Other is a nod to the fears that AIDS was brought to America by a foreigner from an exotic land. (See the demonization of Gaetan Dugas, falsely identified as Patient Zero during the AIDS crisis in America.)\n\nThis digression into the homoerotic subtext found in the film leads into the more prominent theme of the death of the macho that I think was intentional on McTiernan’s part. It is right there in the film’s opening scene with the famous image of the mid-air arm wrestle between Dutch and Dillon. The shot drew laughter in the screening I attended and there is a sense of comic book ridiculousness to the shot almost surreal in its depiction of bulging biceps. That sets the tone for the rest of the movie in particular the more comic first half. McTiernan leans into the hyper masculinity that is typical of the Eighties action genre and ramps it up to the point of parody. The macho posturing of the rescue team is played for laughs in particular the character of Blain played by wrestler turned actor Jesse Ventura. Blain is a parody of the alpha male, his pumped up muscles, handle bar moustache and cowboy hat is visually representative of a certain type of masculinity. His dialogue and character interactions also highlight his masculine credentials. Blain chews tobacco, spitting disgusting black goo on Dillon’s shoes to emasculate him. He calls the others in the team “slack jawed faggots” and refers to himself as “a sexual tyrannosaurs(sic)”.\n\nAgain this links to the homoerotic subtext discussed earlier, Blain could be seen as a closeted gay character overcompensating with macho bravado by accusing others of being less manly. In the rescue/assassination sequences he is shot which he dismisses with “I ain’t got time to bleed.” McTiernan also visualises Blain’s hyper-masculinity by giving him the largest weapon, a mini gun which according to the filmmakers is normally mounted to the side of a helicopter. Blain carries this around on his side pushing his masculine capabilities to the extreme. Blain however is one of the first to die, shot in the back with a laser bolt from the Predator. That moment is followed by a scene McTiernan has actually stated was an intentional parody of the gun lust of the Eighties action movie. Mac finds Blain’s body, sees the Predator and grabs the mini gun, firing wildly into the jungle. The rest of the team join him and what follows is a few minutes of nothing but gunfire as the team level an entire portion of the jungle. The sequence lasts just a few moments too long, just long enough fir the scene to become comical. The final twist is that despite the amount of destruction, the Predator escapes completely unscathed. McTiernan is showing the ridiculousness and futility of gung ho machismo. McTiernan also delights in dismantling the macho posturing of the heroes when the Predator begins to pick them off one by one. It’s surprising how far McTiernan goes in skewering the hyper-masculinity of the characters: Mac is torn apart by grief over Blain’s death that he completely unravels, Billy (a Native American character who has some lazy qausi-mystical insight into the Predator) becomes convinced of the team’s impending doom “We’re all going die”; Poncho is badly wounded and spends the remainder of the film a whimpering wreck before being shot in the back by the Predator.\n\nThe final face-off between Dutch and the Predator in the third act features one last comment on hyper masculinity from McTiernan. Has there ever been a sequence in Schwarzenegger’s career than the final battle in PREDATOR? Due to his imposing physical stature, Schwarzenegger’s nemeses are usually more cerebral threats, normally well-spoken European bad guys who use armies of henchmen to try and take out the Austrian Oak. Rarely is Schwarzenegger’s physically outmatched and watching the final fight in PREDATOR, it was surprising to see a beaten and bloodied Schwarzenegger, cowering and whimpering at the hands of the Predator. McTiernan has always taken great pains to depict his action heroes as flesh and blood human beings who bleed and cry and show their fear. McTiernan took this idea even further with DIE HARD but the seeds of this approach can be seen in PREDATOR, although no doubt he was hampered in any attempt to create a more human character by Schwarzenegger’s limitations as an actor. McTiernan is a capable director of actors and he does get a decent performance out of Schwarzenegger in PREDATOR, mainly by playing to his strengths and by not asking him to emote too much. (LAST ACTION HERO, Schwarzenegger and McTiernan’s second collaboration was less successful as the actor struggled with the more comic elements of the film.) The final fight between Dutch and The Predator also features one other comment by McTiernan on hyper masculinity. Stripped off his reliance on weaponry, Dutch must use his wits to survive, learning from the Predator’s guerrilla tactics. The wordless, suspenseful final battle becomes a cat and mouse battle of wills between two warriors and Dutch defeats the Predator by luring the creature into a trap. McTiernan’s view on macho posturing is clear: it isn’t guns or brawn but brains that is the most important quality in a hero.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPREDATOR is one of the best action movies of the Eighties and is the perfect example of the big is better philosophy of Hollywood genre filmmaking of that era. It certainly checks all the boxes of the 80’s action movie: muscle bound stars, big guns, over the top action, cheesy one-liners. However, whereas a lot of similar Eighties action movies did little more than check the boxes, John McTiernan’s approach to PREDATOR is anything but by-the-numbers. Not only is McTiernan a master craftsman, with a great eye for composition and a knack for careful camera movement, he is a canny storyteller. McTiernan had more ambition than your average Hollywood action director and not only knew how to strip the story to the bone into something fast paced and muscular but also brought a subversive edge to PREDATOR. McTiernan clearly wanted to elevate the action genre with his work not only with his aesthetics but also with the themes of his films. He obviously wanted to use PREDATOR to critique both the macho posturing of the genre but also to highlight the homoeroticism latent in the genre. McTiernan achieved this PREDATOR by leaning into these genre tropes, exaggerating them to the point of ridiculousness then skewering the hyper-masculine posturing typical of the Eighties action film. This meta textual element of the film and its metaphorical underpinnigs 9such as its critique of American foreign policy) raised PREDATOR above the level of ALIEN knock off that it could so easily have been. However, that isn’t to say the film is perfect. PREDATOR was only the director’s second film and McTiernan had yet to have a hit. Therefore there was a lack of trust from the studio in the relatively untested director, coupled with his own inexperience as a filmmaker. There is a tension within the film that is never quite resolved and it feels like there are two films fighting with each other. There is the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger film, with its silliness and cheesy one liners and the more ambitious, suspenseful movie the director was trying to make. Watching the film now it is the former aspect that seems most dated, in particular the A-Team style first act and set piece and moments like “Stick around”( a one liner that seems totally out of character for the taciturn Dutch.) These cheesy moments clash with McTiernan’s more elegant style and the taut atmosphere he is trying to create. PREDATOR seems now like a good attempt by a talented but inexperienced director to elevate the action genre but it doesn’t quite manage it. The film was a commercial success which allowed McTiernan another chance at his goal with 1988’S DIE HARD. This time McTiernan was given the freedom to make the fim he wanted to make and he not only delivered one of the greatest action films ever made but one that revolutionised the genre. McTiernan managed to achieve with DIE HARD all of the things he wanted to do with PREDATOR: the sharp script makes satirical points about rampant capitalism and authority, John McClane was a more human and vulnerable kind of action hero, played by Bruce Willis an actor with far more range than Schwarzenegger and visually McTiernan was able to create a new aesthetic for the action movie (helped considerably by extraordinary photography by Jan De Bont.) However, many of the ideas and visual techniques found in DIE HARD are seen in nascent form in PREDATOR.\n\nPREDATOR may not quite achieve the ambitions of the director and is a somewhat schizophrenic mix of a generic Eighties action movie and a taut, witty sci-fi thriller but it is still head and shoulders above most other action films. Thanks to John McTiernan’s atmospheric visuals, lean storytelling, impressive creature design by Stan Winston and at least some attempt to give some depth to typical monster movie, PREDATOR is a classic sci-fi action film and is intelligent enough to deserve its reputation as one of the best action movies of the Eighties.\n\nJohn McTiernan’s seminal sci-fi/ action/ horror classic returned to the big screen last month and is as deliriously entertaining as ever. Lean, mean and suspenseful, PREDATOR is a masterpiece of Eighties action cinema, a taut and witty Vietnam metaphor that contains Arnold Schwarzenegger at the peak of his powers and introduced an iconic villain to the sci-fi genre.\n\nPLOT\n\nSchwarzenegger plays Dutch, the leader of an elite Special Forces team (which includes hard men character actors like Sonny Landham, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and bizarrely, LETHAL WEAPON screenwriter Shane Black as a nerdish communications expert) who is tasked with a rescue mission in a fictional Communist South American country. Joined by CIA agent (and Dutch’s former comrade) Dillon (ROCKY’s Carl Weathers), Dutch soon realises that he has been lied to about the missions true objective. This is the least of his problems as, when his team is trapped behind enemy lines and one by one are picked off by an unseen, seemingly unstoppable enemy. Soon, Dutch is the only one left and must face down this alien hunter in an epic showdown of two great warriors.\n\nPREDATOR AND THE EIGHTIES ACTION FILM\n\nPREDATOR stands as the epitome of high concept genre filmmaking from era where action movies were stripped down to their essentials. The Eighties was the era where Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lungren became superstars. Short on acting talent (apart from Stallone) but big on muscles these stars lead movies that reflected their physiques; big, cartoonish and lean. High concept movies dominated the Eighties and where movies that could be described in one sentence or as Steven Spielberg called them “ideas you could hold in your hand.” ALIEN was “JAWS in space”, TOP GUN was “STAR WARS on Earth” and PREDATOR was “Schwarzenegger meets ALIEN.” The Eighties action genre was masterful in its use of stripped down storytelling, with simplistic plots, rigid three act structure and broad strokes character arcs. (TOP GUN was so stripped down it simply named its hero Maverick.) As with all art, they reflected the political climate of the time; after the corruption and paranoia of the Nixon era and the malaise of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan gave America back it swagger and the movies mirrored that newfound bombast. For me PREDATOR is the finest example of the Eighties action movie but perhaps what marks it out from the somewhat forgotten films of that era, is the way that it subverts and skewers much of what made the genre so popular.\n\nWatching it again for its 30th Anniversary it struck me just how taut the film is. The first few minutes efficient set everything up without any flab. The first shot is a brief snippet of the Predator’s ship flying towards Earth. This shot is crucial as it sets up the genre of the film: the first 25 minutes are a relatively gritty, combat movie and the Predator’s presence is only hinted at. This single brief shot primes the viewer that the film will have sci-fi elements saw that the clash of genres doesn’t jar. Then the movie features a wordless scene of the rescue team arriving at a remote military camp via helicopter. This introduces the heroes without the need for dialogue. Then we get the first lines of dialogue, General Phillips (RG Armstrong) giving Dutch his mission. Talk about stripped down; there is no backstory, no scene of the team on their previous mission, no chit chat. We just go straight into the plot. The rest of the film keeps up this relentless pace and demonstrates McTiernan’s knack for economical storytelling.\n\nThis was only John McTiernan’s second feature film, having cut his teeth on the little seen Pierce Brosnan horror NOMADS in 1984, but it is a great showcase for his talents. There was once a time when McTiernan looked like he could become the Hitchcock of the late twentieth century. He shared the master’s gift for suspense and action but he also shared Hitchcock’s sly wit and subversive edge. His next film after PREDATOR, DIE HARD is not only one of the greatest action movie ever made but a witty swipe at Greed is Good Reaganomics and class politics. His 1993 flop LAST ACTION HERO was a self-referential spoof of the action genre he had helped to create and 1999’s THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (his last decent film) felt like a modern TO CATCH A THIEF, with its breezy tone and palpable sexual tension (although unlike Hitchcock, more permissive attitudes allowed McTiernan to actually depict the passion between his stars in a steamy and memorable sex scene). McTiernan’s career fell away after that due to cinematic and personal reasons. The action genre moved on to BOURNE IDENTITY style chaos cinema and McTiernan’s more deliberate, elegant approach was now outdated. His career completely derailed when he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment for committing perjury when he gave false testimony regarding his hiring of a private eye to spy on other Hollywood producers.\n\nVISUAL STYLE\n\nPREDATOR contains the perfect distillation of McTiernan’s unique style. He likes to use long lenses, creating extreme close ups of his actors to ramp up the tension. He also use the telephoto lens when filming high speed tracking shots, one shot in particular at the end of the film of Schwarzenegger running through the jungle becomes an almost surreal blur of motion due to the long lens. His eye for composition is apparent throughout. McTiernan makes good use of the Predator’s heat vision POV, not only using it to increase the suspense as we see the heroes being stalked unawares but also to create surreal, impressionistic images of the characters through psychedelically bright colours. The use of the Predator’s POV is particularly memorable in the final fight, where the alien observes the angular planes of Schwarzenegger’s skull, the image coming across like an impressionistic painting. The final act involving Dutch’s battle of wills with the alien has an almost comic book style of framing and McTiernan uses wide angle lenses and atmospheric lighting to ratchet up the tension. His careful, elegant camerawork is made more apparent in contrast with the first action sequence of the film, the rescue/assassination scene at the rebel camp. This sequence sticks out like a sore thumb with its seemingly random cutting, over the top stunt work (lots of extras leaping up in the air as if jumping on trampolines) and some groan inducing one liners, including the infamous “stick around”. That this scene jars with both McTiernan’s more measured style and the tone of the rest of the film is no accident: it was directed by someone else. The producers were concerned about McTiernan’s lack of experience and handed the scene over to second unit director and stunt coordinator Craig R Baxter. This is often common practice in action film making where complex action and stunt scenes are directed by more experienced, more qualified professionals when dangerous stunts and explosives are involved. Baxter was responsible for shaping much of the aesthetics of the Eighties action movie and directed several set pieces in big Hollywood productions. His style was most evident (and most mocked) in the classic TV series THE A TEAM, where his penchant for stunt men flying through the air in slow motion as flames shot up behind them became the subject of much parody. There is nothing wrong with second unit directors handling action sequences in an action film, it makes sense in terms of safety (no one wants a repeat of the TWILIGHT ZONE tragedy) and hiring a specialist who knows how to get the most out of stunt performers and choreography is smart filmmaking. However, it works best when the second unit director is in sync with the director of the film and ensures that their sequences math the tone and style of the rest of the piece.\n\nIn fact the main problems with PREDATOR and the flaws which prevent the film from reaching true greatness of genre films like ALIEN and THE FLY are due to the tensions within the film, where on one side it is a generic Schwarzenegger Eighties shoot em up and the film’s more ambitious director. There is the aforementioned Baxter directed A-TEAM style action sequence and the COMMANDO style scenes of Schwarzenegger mowing down scores of extras with an oversized machine gun that is the trope of the genre. The studio also denied McTiernan the chance to shoot in the Anamorphic film format and insisted he shot with conventional, spherical lenses in the 1:85 aspect ratio. This is understandable, most genre movies in the Eighties where shot spherically as it is cheaper, uses lighter equipment and is easier to use with optical effects. However, McTiernan revolutionised the action movie aesthetic (along with cinematographer Jan De Bont) with his next film DIE HARD. McTiernan’s style became synonymous with the Anamorphic format and few filmmakers have used the specific elements of the format, the epic scope of the widescreen frame, the blue streaks of lens flare and the soft, shallow depth of field, to such thrilling effect as McTiernan did in DIE HARD. It is this lack of trust in their admittedly inexperienced director by the producers that hampers the film and prevents PREDATOR from revolutionising the genre in the way McTiernan managed with DIE HARD. However, he comes extremely close.\n\nThis analysis was separated into two parts due to its length. In the second part I will look at the themes and subtexts hidden in PREDATOR\n\nDIRECTOR: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWRITERS: Michael Green(Screenplay) Agatha Christie (novel)\n\nTHE PLOT: The world’s most famous detective Hercules Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is called to London on urgent business and hitches a lift on the legendary Orient Express. When the train is derailed in the mountains of Yugoslavia, Poirot is called into action to investigate the murder of one of the passengers, a shady art dealer with a mysterious past called Ratchett (Johnny Depp). Poirot interrogates the suspects one by one and uncovers everyone has secrets to tell and their own motives to murder Ratchett. Poirot must race against time to uncover the truth before the snow clears and the killer can escape.\n\nREVIEW: Kenneth Branagh continues his recent run of form with a fast-paced, humorous revamp of the classic novel by Agatha Christie, breathing new life into an oft-told tale. MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is a lavishly mounted old school romp that features some fun performances from its game cast, a witty screenplay from Michael Green,some slick visuals and a surprisingly moving denouement.\n\nKenneth Branagh burst onto the scene in the late Eighties with his excellent Shakespeare adaptation HENRY V, which was also his film debut as both star and director. Following the success of that film (he won Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Director) and the comedy MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, Branagh was bestowed with the tag of “the next Olivier.”. Obviously this was an impossible tag to live up to and his move into A list Hollywood filmmaking with MARY SHELLEY’S FRANKENSTEIN was a critical and commercial flop. He did recover his reputation somewhat with his big budget, unabridged version of HAMLET but that film was not a huge hit, mainly due to its four hour runtime, but he had lost much of his Golden Boy aura. Despite a few successes including a fun turn as the conceited Gilderoy Lockhart in HARRY POTTER AND THECHAMBER OF SECRETS and an Oscar nominated performance as (ironically) Laurence Olivier in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, the late 90s early 2000s was a quiet period for Branagh. This all changed when Branagh had a huge hit with THOR in 2011. Branagh was a surprise choice to direct an all action Marvel blockbuster but it actually proved to be a master stroke as he brought a sense of Shakespearean weight to the Viking mythology and added an emotional heft to the comic book film. The run continued with spy reboot JACK RYAN:SHADOW RECRUIT and DISNEY’S CINDERELLA and Branagh continues his surprising new career as A list director with MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. He brings his usual Wellesian flamboyance to the film, with his constantly roving camera, ambitious long takes and his love for epic widescreen vistas (he shot MURDER.. on 65mm film as he did with HAMLET). He has a knack for taking unfashionable material be it Shakespeare, classic novels(MARY SHELLEY’S FRANKENSTEIN) or Norse mythology(THOR) and infusing them with a modern, energetic (though admittedly broad) style.\n\nBranagh is a terrific actor although he has often been criticised for being overly theatrical, which is valid since he first found fame on the London stage and that is where he appears most at home. His flamboyance as a filmmaker is mirrored in his acting style and on some occasions in his career he has slipped into overacting, most obviously in MARY SHELLEY’S FRANKENSTEIN. In Hercules Poirot, however, Branagh seems to have found the perfect character for his talents, Poirot is a vain, preening character that is undoubtedly a genius in his field and Branagh nails this perfectly. Always gifted with accents, Branagh’ s Belgian is convincing but with enough Allo Allo style camp to fit in with the heightened world of the film. One of the elements that make Christie’s books so spicy is the fact that the author was aware that Poirot was quite unlikeable: a genius detective yes, but a rigid and conceited stick in the mud. In Sidney Lumet’s 1974 version of MURDER.. (up until this film the definitive cinematic version of Christie’s novel) Albert Finney played up the unlikeable aspects of the detective, playing a dyspeptic Poirot with snap and snarl. Branagh’s reading is a few gears lower than Finney’s, a warmer and more charming version of the character. Special mention must go to Branagh’s gargantuan moustache, almost a character in its own right.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Michael Green (BLADE RUNNER 2049, LOGAN) screenplay is the way it plays up the moral ambiguity of the film’s climax. Without giving away spoilers to the famous ending to the story, Christie’s denouement is a challenge to the cut and dried moralising of most detective tales. Branagh and Green use this to give the film an emotional impact that is missing from many Christie adaptations, including Lumet’s slick but cold version of MURDER. At the beginning of Branagh’s film, Poirot states that “There is right and there is wrong.” The climax of the film actively challenges Poirot’s certainty and the final scenes, where the detective is forced to reset his moral compass, are surprisingly moving.\n\nBranagh is obviously a great director of actors and he draws out some fun performances from the cast. Michelle Pfeiffer vamps it up as a wealthy divorcee, Judi Dench has some funny moments as a gruff Princess and the usually irritating Josh Gad (FROZEN) is surprisingly restrained and menacing as the victim’s shady assistants. Even Johnny Depp who has been in a poor run of form of late, is effectively slimy as Ratchett, the more than deserving victim of the titular crime.\n\nThe film does have its flaws obviously. Branagh’s focus on keeping things moving gives some parts of the film a rushed feeling, especially a chase sequence featuring Branagh and Gad seems to come out of nowhere and is strangely paced. It’s not usually that you would say that a film needed to be longer some moments could have done with more room to breathe. Also, the tone of the film is pitched quite high and the line between theatrical and high camp requires a high wire balancing act and there are a few scenes when Branagh goes over the edge. The shot of the suspects, perefectly arranged to mimic Da Vinci’s Last Supper might have been a joke too far but as always you have to admire Branagh’s cheek.\n\nVERDICT: MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is a fun, funny romp that successfully updates the classic Agatha Christie novel for a modern audience. Branagh lets rip as both star and director, creating a slick, good looking film with a great cast having the time of their lives. Branagh and his writer Michael Green puts some meat on the story’s bones by playing up the moral ambiguity of the film’s ending and actually challenging the hero’s binary viewpoint of justice. Apart from a few missteps the film stays on the right side of camp and although subtlety is not a part of Branagh’s style, that’s what makes his film so entertaining. Sometimes his reach exceeds his grasp but when he gets it right, Branagh is one of the best actors and directors around.\n\nAfter the mixed reaction to Ridley Scott’s sort of ALIEN prequel PROMETHEUS in 2012, the British director has made a follow-up film that serves to fix some of the fan’s problems with the 2012 film. The most successful elements of that film have been retained (Michael Fassbender’s creepy android David returns) whilst much of the artful ponderings on the origin of humanity and the stupid plot holes have been erased (though not all). The main course correction that Scott makes with ALIEN: COVENANT is, as the title suggests, more of an attempt to link with the ALIEN franchise. This film is definitely an improvement on PROMETHEUS and feels more like an ALIEN film but is still far from perfect.\n\n10 years after the events of PROMETHEUS, the ship Covenant , carrying thousands of cryogenically frozen colonists toward the planet Oegis 6, suffers an accident and its crew are awakened early. Their Captain (an incredibly brief cameo from James Franco) is killed and the devout Christian and somewhat indecisive Chris Orrum (Billy Crudup) assumes command. When they receive a signal from a previously uncharted planet, Orrum leads a team, including Captain’s widow Daniels,(Katherine Waterston) and Walter(Michael Fassbender), a more humane model of android than David, to investigate whether it would be a more viable option that the faraway Oegis. However, the team are soon stranded and come under attack from the same pathogen that destroyed the PROMETHEUS. They meet a survivor from the Prometheus, who may or may not have their best interests at heart…\n\nThere is no doubt that ALIEN:COVENANT is a much stronger film than PROMETHEUS. There is more of a stripped down focus to the film, as befits the best horror/sci-fi films. There are far less glaring plot holes in this film and unlike PROMETHEUS the characters behave in ways that have some modicum of logic. As ever with Ridley Scott, the technical and visual aspects of the film are stunning. The production design is top notch (Scott began his career as a Production Designer for the BBC) and the sets, from the hi-tec spaceship to the Giger inspired ruins of an ancient alien civilisation. The lighting and shot design is brilliant and Scott demonstrates once again that he has the finest eye in Hollywood.\n\nScott is also a much more ambitious filmmaker than most other blockbuster directors and whilst he isn’t the most natural storyteller (as a trained artist and photographer he is definitely more visual than literary minded) his best films have more challenging themes. With this film and PROMETHEUS Scott wants to explore the theme of creation, whether that’s the creation of humankind or the creation of more destructive forces. The ALIEN series is a good vessel for these themes, as the films are all about birth trauma. The iconic scene of the Alien bursting from John Hurt’s chest is the ultimate image of nightmarish birth (Although the incredible “abortion” scene in PROMETHEUS came pretty close in terms of impact). ALIEN: COVENANT opens with a quietly creepy scene of the android David’s birth and his discussion with Peter Weyland(the returning Guy Pearce), the evil CEO from the first film. David’s obsession with creation and his God complex have their roots in this scene and it is an effectively haunting opening. In fact, it is in these more quiet moments of the film that ALIEN: COVENANT is most effective. Fassbeneder joins the rank of actors who have played a scene against themselves and the best scene in the film features David teaching his successor Walter how to play the recorder. It is a weird, intimate scene, full of tension and subtle humour , while also revealing the complexity of David’s character. He wants to create, to have a connection with someone who he sees as being on his level and his disappointment in discovering the fact that Walter has been programmed so that he can never create anything himself is subtly conveyed. This kind of scene is rarely seen in Hollywood blockbusters and shows why both Scott and the ALIEN franchise in general is a cut above most blockbuster fare.\n\nWhereas PROMETHEUS for the most part concentrated on sci fi and action there is a more conscious effort to take ALIEN:COVENANT back into the horror genre. There are some truly impressive gore effects this time around, with nightmarish images of bodies bursting open and various creatures emerging covered in gloop. In fact, these scenes where reminscient of the body horror in THE THING, though it must be said that none of the scenes have quite the impact of the chestburster scene in ALIEN or even the C-section of PROMETHEUS. There are some unsettling images of the after effects of the Alien’s attacks that stick in the memory, however. The shot of a victim’s decapitated head bobbing up and down in pool of water, eyes still open and a grim image of one of the heroes with the chest open laying in the mud are images of violence more upsetting than the majority of modern horror films.\n\nIn terms of the characters and acting, ALIEN: COVENANT is somewhat of an improvement on PROMETHEUS. The characters this time around don’t make the same idiotic decisions as the characters do in the first film and the acting is at a much less hysterical level. Fassbender again steals the show, adding new layers to the amoral David and having fun playing a much more heroic character with Walter (although Fassbender’s American accent is once again unconvincing). Waterstone is fine as the Ripley-like second in command who proves to be more than capable in charge although her character is underwritten. Comic actor Danny McBride is the most likeable presence amongst the supporting cast as the wisecracking pilot Tennessee and is surprisingly convincing in the more dramatic scenes. Billy Crudup once again proves that he is the world’s greatest under actor as the out of his depth Orrum and he manages to subtly convey his character’s self-doubt with a few nervous breaths and blinks and not much else. However, the characters are less memorable than the one’s in PROMETHEUS. Yes those characters were cartoonish and overplayed but there is no one on the team as memorable as Idris Elba’s gruff Janek or Sean Harris’s punk rock geologist Fifield. In fact most of the supporting characters in ALIEN: COVENANT are disposable cannon fodder and it’s hard to care when they are picked off one by one.\n\nThe main negative with the film is the sudden nosedive it takes in the final act. Whereas the first two thirds of the movie are creepy, slow-burn and full of interesting elements the film takes a sharp turn into B movie action territory. We suddenly have a super-powered kung fu fight between David and Walter, a silly fight scene with Alien on the rescue craft and laziest of all, a random sex scene where the Alien attacks nude lovers in the shower. You’d expect these kinds of scenes in a B movie ALIEN knock off not in the real thing, especially since the first two thirds of the movie are so well made. In fact the most disappointing elements of the film are when Scott tries to make it feel more like an ALIEN film. In interviews he said that the reason that he didn’t include the original Xenomorph design in PROMETHEUS was because he felt that it had been done to death and had lost its power. He was right. Seeing the Alien leap about in broad daylight is far less terrifying than the slow moving creature in the shadows in Scott’s 1979 original. The scenes of the characters running down hallways being chased by the Alien, the bread and butter of the series, are so rushed and devoid of tension that it is obvious that Scott’s heart is not really in it.\n\nVERDICT\n\nUndoubtedly an upgrade on PROMETHEUS, ALIEN:COVENANT has a thematic ambition and dark allure that sets it head and shoulders above the average cookie cutter Hollywood blockbuster. With some stunning visuals and another brilliant performance by Michael Fassbender as David, surely the most memorable element of these orequels, Scott has made an impressive addition to the series. However the lazy attempts to appease the fans in the third act are extremely disappointing. Scott almost redeems it with the final scene, a cruel and ambiguous set up for the next film, which according to Scott, will tie the prequels directly to the events in ALIEN. Here’s hoping that Scott again learns the lessons from this film and creates the sci-fi masterpiece he is obviously reaching for but just misses with ALIEN: COVENANT.\n\nDirector John Lee Hancock continues his run of solid if unspectacular dramas based on real life events (THE ALAMO, THE BLIND SIDE, SAVING MR BANKS) with this retelling of the creation of the McDonald’s restaurant chain. THE FOUNDER tells the story of Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) the man who took the family owned McDonald’s company run by brothers Dick( Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Caroll Lynch) and turned it into the multinational corporation it is today. However, it is not a heart-warming tale of the American dream, as Hancock paints a morally grey portrait of Kroc, a man who ultimately stole the ideas of the honest McDonald brothers and gradually using more and more unscrupulous business tactics to achieve his success.\n\nThe year is 1954 and 52 year old travelling salesman Ray Kroc(Keaton) is struggling to sell his latest product, a milkshake maker. Whilst on the road, Kroc is astounded to see a restaurant like no other: a fast food restaurant that serves customers within thirty seconds, has a family orientated clientele and a production line approach to cooking invented by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald. Kroc thinks he has seen the future and mortgages his home to buy a small stake in the business and begins aggressively setting up franchises across the country. As the company grows, Kroc’s marriage to Ethel (Laura Dern) deteriorates and he comes into conflict with the honest but stubborn McDonald Brothers. Eventually Ray grows tired of what he perceives as a lack of credit from both his wife and business partners and makes moves to get rid of them both.\n\nTHE FOUNDER touches on themes that have been explored many times on film and there is the feeling that we have been here before. It is the classic story of the desperate pursuit of the American Dream, the illusion of the individual making himself a success against the odds but leaving others in his wake. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, THERE WILL BE BLOOD and SCARFACE tell a similar story but with different tones and stylistic approaches. You can see the appeal of this type of story; from one angle audiences love to see a success story, the individual who changed the world but also there is the dramatic conflict of the individual who, to quote The Bible, “gains the world but loses his soul.” The story of McDonalds is an interesting one and the most enjoyable elements of the film are based around the Eureka moments the characters have over things that seem so commonplace now: the production line cooking methods, the idea of “fast food” itself, the invention of the Golden Arches. Hancock has fun with the conflict between the reserved and honourable McDonald brothers and the more ambitious Kroc. For most of the film’s running time, we are asked to see events from Kroc’s point of view and feel the risks he takes and the elation of his successes. Hancock shows the moral grey areas of each side’s point of view: Kroc’s frustration at the McDonald’s brothers’ lack of ambition and their inflexibility to their methods is understandable we also sympathise with the brothers discomfort with Kroc’s increasing unscrupulous methods. The third act of the film details Kroc’s grab for power, in which he not only completely cuts the brothers out of the business they created but ditches his wife for someone who feeds his ego. The film defiantly comes down on the side of the McDonald brothers, two well-meaning and likeable men who came up with an incredible idea but had no idea how to cope with the cut throat world of big business.\n\nJohn Lee Hancock is a more than capable craftsman, who specialises in middle of the road, true-life dramas. He began his career as a screenwriter and has worked on the screenplay for most of his films as director. His instincts for a good story and his knowledge of writing are apparent in THE FOUNDER: the film is well-structured, moves at a decent clip, has clear dramatic purpose and has some convincing dialogue. However, Hancock’s flaw that is apparent in all of his true life stories is his reluctance to take risks and explore the darker side of the stories. THE BLIND SIDE is a heartwarming story of overcoming racial prejudice and following one’s dreams but doesn’t delve into questions about the motivations of Sandra Bullock’s character. SAVING MR BANKS avoids dealing with Walt Disney’s racism and anti-Semitism in favour of an entertaining but standard populist versus the artist story. Unfortunately these flaws are apparent in THE FOUNDER. Although Hancock paints an ultimately unsympathetic view of Kroc and shows him cruelly abandoning his wife and essentially conning the McDonald’s out of hundreds of millions of dollars, he stops short of criticising McDonalds as a company. There are no scenes about what the company has become, a corporation that has not only been accused of being a cause of the rise of obesity but also its rampant business practices, including its treatment of its staff. The early signs are all there; the way the brothers talk about turning their staff almost into machines, the homogenisation of the food industry. There are hints that Hancock gets this: a humorous scene where the McDonalds brothers argue with Kroc over his plan for Coca-Cola sponsorship featuring the ironic line “The name McDonalds is not associated with that kind of crass commercialism.” Kroc’s explanation to Dick at the end of the film about why he wanted their business so much “That name McDonalds…it sounded so American” hints at an interesting link between America and McDonalds. On the one hand McDonalds positions itself as the embodiment of the American ideals of family, free enterprise and All American values. It can also be viewed as a symbol of the worst elements of America; rampant commercialisation, the bland homogenising of cultural identity, greed, gluttony and even the idea of American imperialism (McDonalds have “invaded” the whole world.) It’s a shame Hancock only touches on these ideas, perhaps a more ambitious filmmaker would have gone much further.\n\nOne of Hancock’s undeniable strengths is his handling of actors. THE FOUNDER is no exception. Michael Keaton is recently getting a much deserved renaissance in his career, following excellent lead performances in the Oscar winning BIRDMAN and SPOTLIGHT. Keaton has always been an interesting screen presence from his insane performance in BEETLEJUICE, his stint as BATMAN and his performance in JACKIE BROWN being one of the most subtle and humane in any Tarantino film. The role of Kroc is a dream for any actor shifting from motor-mouth salesman patter to the avaricious, self-aggrandizing character in the second half of the film. Keaton has the range to play the role, his comedic background means he can sell the humorous elements while he has the charisma to hold the attention for the film. Keaton has a manic quality to him that hints at a darker side to his characters which I think is what made him such a compelling Batman. It was believable that he was someone just unhinged enough to dress up as a Bat and beat villains to a pulp. The rest of the cast are just as good in particular Nick Offerman, who dials down his more comedic side to play the straight laced and tightly wound Dick McDonald. John Carroll Lynch, an underrated character actor who plays the warm affable Mac, demonstrates his range: it’s hard to believe this is the same guy who was so unsettling as the (possible) serial killer in David Fincher’s ZODIAC. Laura Dern is unfortunately only given a small amount of screentime as Ray’s long suffering wife. Dern is a terrific actress and her talents have never really been utilised properly by mainstream directors, considering the power of her work with David Lynch in BLUE VELVET, WILD AT HEART and INLAND EMPIRE.\n\nOverall, THE FOUNDER contains the best and worst qualities of director John Lee Hancock. He is a director with strong storytelling instincts, a knack for making true stories entertaining and he is an excellent director of actors. However his films often lack edge and he soft pedals some of the darker aspects of the story. He is almost like the McDonalds brothers, solid and reliable who have modest ambitions and hit them solidly but lacking the killer instinct to set the world alight. THE FOUNDER then is an entertaining and well-made film with a great lead performance by Keaton but unfortunately it’s a story that has been done many times before and with more ambition and vigour.\n\nKeanu Reeves reprises his role from 2015’s JOHN WICK, as the eponymous unstoppable hitman. The original film was a cult hit and a return to form for Reeves. After the disappointing sequels to THE MATRIX, Reeves career had become listless, with largely unsuccessful sci-fi fantasy roles in films like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and CONSTANTINE and equally unsuccessful attempts as a romantic lead in SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE and THE LAKE HOUSE. There were the occasionally flashes of his ability: most memorably in Richard Linklater’s visually audacious adaptation of Philip K Dick’s A SCANNER DARKLY in which Reeves gives an affecting performance as the tragic undercover agent who spirals into drug addiction. Reeves is often mocked for his acting ability ( or lack thereof) and he has struggled to shake off his BILL AND TED “whoah dude” persona . Its true he struggles when he is hired to do something outside of his limited range, most obviously his spectacularly stilted and bizarrely accented performance in BRAM’S STOKER’S DRACULA. He can’t do period films, that’s for sure but what he can do is action heroics and brooding bad ass. JOHN WICK was an excellent showcase for both and also received deserved praise for its expertly choreographed and violent action. JOHN WICK CHAPTER TWO develops the visual style of the first film and expands its unusual mythology but does lack the original’s lean and mean storytelling acumen.\n\nJOHN WICK CHAPTER TWO follows on immediately after the events of the first film in which retired and widowed professional killer John Wick (Reeves) went on a killing spree to avenge the murder of his puppy. Wick, with a new dog, attempts to return to the quiet life only to be brought back into his violent past when gangster Santino (Riccardo Scamarcio) comes to collect on a promise made by Wick to help him leave the business. Wick is charged with murdering Gianna D’Antonio (Cluadia Gerini) Santino’s sister. When Wick is betrayed by Santino, he becomes the subject of a contract on his life bringing him into conflict with other members of the secret fraternity of killers, including (Common) and (ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK’s Ruby Rose).\n\nThe most praised aspect of the original film was undoubtedly the quality of the action sequences and this is continued and improved upon here. The action scenes in both films seem to be a rebuke to the shaky camera, Chaos Cinema that has permeated Hollywood movies since THE BOURNE IDENTITY. Whereas that style of action was appropriate for those films, it has become an easy get out for filmmakers. Using quick cutting, constantly moving camera and over the top sound effects , action directors can hide pedestrian fight choreography, dodgy stunt work and help receive a lower age rating by making the violence elliptical. One of the worst examples of this is the TAKEN movies. Not to diminish Liam Neeson’s undoubted abilities as a dramatic actor, he is obviously not particularly skilled at martial arts and given that he is in his sixties cannot physically perform much of his own stunts (It is rumoured that he refuses to run on screen, with a stuntman taking his place). The JOHN WICK films hark back to an age of classic action cinema, where the thrills come through incredible fight choreography and skilled martial arts, where the geography of the scene is clearly defined and coherent. In the last few decades, it has been Asian cinema where the greatest action films are to be found with films such as THE RAID and ONG-BAK. This is because the Asian film industry is filled with incredibly talented martial artists and filmmakers experienced in crafting action. JOHN WICK is the closest any American filmmaker has come to matching Asian action cinema, perhaps since THE MATRIX. This is down to two reasons: firstly, the director of both films is Chad Stahelski, former stuntman and fight choreographer, someone who is experienced in designing great action and how to film it in a way that showcases the stunt work. Secondly, the other reason is Keanu Reeves. It is no accident that Reeves has been the star of the best action films of the last twenty years. Unlike many actors, who due to a lack of preparation time and physical ability are unable or unwilling to perform most of the stunt work themselves forcing directors to hide this with chaos cinema, Reeves is more than able to hold his own as a martial artist. Obviously he is naturally fit and athletic (or at least works very hard to become so), he is now 52 but looks fifteen years younger. Also he has a dedication to the action scenes that few other actors share, he spent five months training for THE MATRIX, a whole year on THE MATRIX sequels and trained extensively for the JOHN WICK movies. The only other actor who shares this enthusiasm for action and stunt work is Tom Cruise, again it’s no surprise that his films contain some excellent action sequences.\n\nJOHN WICK CHAPTER TWO demonstrates its slightly higher budget and more confident filmmakers with a larger scale and increase in visual ambition. Whereas the first film was limited to America the sequel expands the scope to Rome, giving the action a different flavour. The action sequences are more elaborate and even have a few touches of humour this time, in particular the extended fight scene between Reeves and Common, as they fall down a series of steps and try to take sly shots at each other in a busy subway station. There is more ambition in terms of camerawork and production design. The hall of mirrors finale is a cliché but Stahelski finds some interesting shots that turn the scene into something surrealistic. Stahelski has also knows how to move the camera to express emotion, the slow push in on Common’s face when he discovers Gianni’s body reveals more about his character than any dialogue scene could. As with the first film the director is more than aware where his talents lie and focuses on the extended fight sequences. Reeves has his flaws but he is a strident action man and thoroughly convinces as an almost superhuman killing machine. The film wisely plays to his strengths as an actor, not giving him much emotional beats to play and letting him use that dead eyed stare that Reeves does so well. Some of the actors are given room to make an impression, particularly Ian McShane as the mysterious Manager, who attempts to enforce the rules of the clandestine criminal world. There’s a nice cameo from Laurence Fishbourne( reteaming with his MATRIX co-star) and Ruby Rose makes an impressive but unfortunately all too brief role as a deaf assassin.\n\nHowever, in some ways JOHN WICK CHAPTER TWO is inferior to the original. Whereas that film was a classic revenge story with clear motivations for every character, CHAPTER TWO unfortunately seems more interested in setting up its convoluted mythology and its inevitable third instalment. Whereas in the first film, Wick was given clear motivations ( he wanted to avenge the murder of his dog, the final gift from his dying wife) and it was easy to understamd his actions here his motivations are not as powerful. He is forced to act due to a promise he made in his past with the threat of death being his motivation. Would such a skilled killer ( supposedly one of the most feared in the world) really be that intimated to reenter the violent world he wants to quit? Or is perhaps that the filmmakers are suggesting that Wick cannot (or doesn’t want to) quit his violent trade. This idea is never really explored and much of the plots questions are left hanging for the sequel.\n\nFor me, although I enjoy the quality of the fight choreography and enjoy Reeves return to form, I do find that the JOHN WICK films fall somewhat short and I can’t quite put them in the category of action classics. I find that Wick is a bit too unstoppable and that there is little dramatic tension. The villains are pretty uninteresting in both films and the stories never build up to much, instead just devolving into scenes of Wick capping endless henchmen in the head. Hopefully, if there is to be a third film these flaws will be addressed and can give Wick an opponent that can match him."
