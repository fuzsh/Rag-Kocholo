        "text": "I can’t understand why some other people didn’t like it. Actually this is the first Bond movie I’ve seen, it made a big impression on me and it still does. I found this movie being one of the most colorful Bond movies. There were few colorful villains, lots of action, some humor, and of course – Roger Moore who is my favorite James Bond. The story isn’t typical for James Bond movies, it’s more mystical this time, but I liked that. Of course nowadays when you watch this movie it may look cheesy in some scenes, but the action sequences where very exiting. Another reason why I liked this movie was the main theme song – Paul McCartney’s Live and Let Die, which is yet my favorite James Bond theme.\n\nPositively surreal Blaxploitation Bond\n\nAuthor: Shawn Watson from The Penumbra\n\n15 December 2006\n\nAnd none the worse for it, since every Bond film needs a fresh spin on the same old formula. Roger Moore’s first outing as JB is, in equal measures, comical and action-packed. You’ll never get bored. But it’s definitely the weirdest Bond ever with loads of utterly bizarre moments.\n\nIt begins with M turning up at JB’s house in the early hours while he’s pumping some Italian agent for information (don’t you just love his initialled dressing gown). Before sending him to America to investigate a Harlem pimp known as Mister Big he delivers some gadgets from Q-Branch, including a very useful watch. Q himself, or Major Boothroyd if you want to call him by his proper name, doesn’t make any appearance in this one.\n\nStanding out like a Muslim in an airport, almost every single black person JB encounters in Harlem is on Mister Big’s payroll. And they’ve got a seemingly endless bag of tricks to play on him. The funny thing about Moore is that he’s very proper and British and doesn’t think anything of walking into a tough Harlem bar while dressed up like the Duke of Edinburgh. His stunned reactions when they mess with his head are seriously funny.\n\nThe action then moves to Lousiana and a savage Caribbean island as JB uncovers a massive heroin plot. There’s a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J.W. Pepper, the most stereotypical southern redneck ever. Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea. JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do, many times over, Solitaire, Mister Big’s Tarot card reader.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hook-handed maniac called Tee-Hee, a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie. Right? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly. Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away. When will they learn?\n\nDespite being the oldest actor to debut as Bond (at 46), Moore does look younger than Connery. And while Sean was gruff and Scottish, Moore is perpetually calm and refined, even in the face of danger (fingers being chopped-off, snake in the bath, being eaten by gators/sharks). Everything that the British once thought they were. He has a certain sarcastic edge that the other Bond actors lacked. While some of his films may have been the sillier of the franchise, Moore has always been my favorite. And the massive revolver and holster he uses at the end is so much more masculine than the usual, wimpy as hell, Walther PPK.\n\nAnd, as much as I am no fan of Paul McCartney, you gotta love that theme song! Exciting and iconic at the same time. And also yet another juxtaposition in the weirdest Bond movie ever.\n\nMI6, Harlem, Pimps, Paul McCartney, Gators, Heroin, Voodoo, Snakes, Sharks, Clairvoyance, Rednecks, Afros, Fake Afros, Fillet of Soul, Human Scarifice, Scarecrows and a small-headed man in a Top-Hat who lost a fight with chickens. Is this a Bond film or did the whole world just go insane?\n\nBond Over Easy, Cool But Dumb\n\nAuthor: Bill Slocum (bill.slocum@gmail.com) from Greenwich, CT United States\n\n24 July 2004\n\nWas Roger Moore channeling Austin Powers in 1973? There’s a scene in this, his first go-round as 007, where Bond is tied up and his arm is cut to draw blood and attract some hungry sharks swimming below. Moore twitches his eyebrow and asks: “Perhaps we can try something in a simpler vein.”\n\nThose sharks don’t need any frickin’ laser beams on their heads to get you to smell the Austin. Moore gets a lot of blame for turning the Bond movies into weakly-plotted farces, ignoring that the series had been moving in that direction since “Goldfinger” and that the previous installment, Sean Connery’s final EON bow “Diamonds Are Forever,” was every bit as goofy. Also, Moore could deliver a more serious Bond when the script allowed, and two of the finest Bonds ever, “The Spy Who Loved Me” and “For Your Eyes Only,” were his.\n\nBut there’s no getting around this, “Live And Let Die” is a dumb movie. The gadgets are silly, the villain’s scheme is ill-defined, the storyline is frenetic and unengaging, the action is plodding and overlong. Moore starts out not quite know how to play Bond here, while the movie requires him to play the fool sauntering through Harlem in a double-breasted suit like the Prince of Wales waiting for some natives to show him around.\n\nBut this film makes me smile, in part because I’m young enough to remember what it was all about when it came out. If this was Bond for the cheap seats, it at least delivered the goods, with some vivid supporting characters, a knockout visual style, amazing title music from Paul McCartney, and most importantly for Moore’s future in the series, drop-dead quips. My favorite is when the nasty Tee Hee twists his pistol muzzle out of shape with a metal pincer arm, then giggles when he hands it back: “Funny how the least little thing amuses him.”\n\nJulius Harris is menacing but charming as Tee Hee, mostly mute except when he sticks Bond in a gator pond and suggests the best way to disarm the beasts is to try and pull out their teeth. Chief villain Yaphet Kotto has his moments, too, but with odd shifts of character. In the beginning, he’s stone-cold Ron O’Neal in “Superfly,” and at the end, he’s plummy Charles Gray in “Diamonds Are Forever.” Jane Seymour is Bond’s love interest, and why she goes off with him is another of those things best not thought about long.\n\nThere are two great characters in this movie, though, bigger than just about anything seen in a Bond movie before who kind of work in tandem in overhauling any objections about this film being too “cartoony.” Clifton James is redneck sheriff J.W. Pepper, who throws off one madman line after another while Bond is off on one of his long silly chase scenes. James mugs through every scene he’s in, rolling his tongue around, playing off everyone and everything, and delivering every hackneyed Southern stereotype to such righteous perfection it’s enough to make cotton sprout out of his ears. Bond purists who whine should just take their vodka martinis shaken not stirred and let the rest of us enjoy the craziness. The series is supposed to be fun; if you want serious espionage go watch “Smiley’s People.” (I grant you Pepper shouldn’t have returned in the next Bond film; that was a mistake.)\n\nThe other great outsized character is Geoffrey Holder as perhaps the most mysterious figure in the whole series, Baron Samedi. Is he supernatural? Is he just crazy from the heat? He’s certainly different, a guy who sides with the bad guys without quite being one of them. The always-eerie quality of his appearances, either dancing in a big hotel production number or quietly sitting in a cemetery playing a flute, make you question whether there ain’t something to that voodoo after all.\n\nIt’s silly bashing Pepper but praising Samedi, they are both equally so unreal, in a way that’s in tune with the rest of the movie. The best thing to do is enjoy the different kinds of fun on offer. Frankly, not having these guys around might push this film on the bad side of Spinal Tap’s “fine line between stupid and clever,” the side where “A View To A Kill” and “Moonraker” are on.\n\nBut “Live And Let Die” is a winner. It’s a fun movie that brings me back to younger days, when my heart was an open book. It’s a nice transitional film for the series in that Moore managed a mostly smooth entrance to the role of Bond. And it has one of the best final shots in movie history. That’s all I’ll say there; you know it if you saw it.\n\nA new era for James Bond, and a fairly effective and enjoyable opening film.\n\nAuthor: Jonathon Dabell (barnaby.rudge@hotmail.co.uk) from Todmorden, England\n\n11 January 2005\n\nLive and Let Die ushers in Roger Moore as the new James Bond. Prior to this movie, Bond had been played most often by Sean Connery, with the one exception being George Lazenby’s short-lived stint in 1969 (On Her Majesty’s Secret Service). Moore is very different to Connery and Lazenby. He plays Bond as a more relaxed, charming, humorous character. Over the years, many people have said that the Moore incarnation of Bond lacks the brutality of Connery’s and the hard masculinity, but actually Moore is not the kind of actor to do Bond in that manner. He’s merely playing to his own strengths, and creating a Bond that is akin to his acting style. I feel that Roger makes a perfectly likable 007, admittedly different to the character of the novels, but still a rousing screen hero.\n\nThe story has James Bond sent to solve the killing of three British agents. One was killed in New York, one in New Orleans, and the third on a voodoo-practising Caribbean island. Bond’s starts his mission in New York, where he runs across a nasty black gangster named Mr Big and his gorgeous, tarot-reading accomplice Solitaire (Jane Seymour). Bond heads down to the Caribbean, where he “connects” Mr Big with a drug-smuggling big-shot named Dr Kananga. Then it’s off to New Orleans, where Bond discovers that Kananga’s master plan is to provide huge amounts of free heroin to the junkies of the world, creating a massive drug-reliant population and setting himself up as a supplier with a worldwide monopoly on the drug trade.\n\nThe title song, sung by Paul McCartney and Wings is one of the best of the series, a lively and powerful tune which fits the style and period of the film perfectly. Yaphet Kotto is a decent bad guy (his death scene at the end is both funny and memorable); Seymour is superb as the Bond girl (probably the best of the bunch apart from Barbara Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me). There are good set pieces as we have grown to expect from the Bond series, most notably a spectacular boat chase around the Louisiana bayous, a scene involving a bunch of hungry crocodiles, and a slick sequence featuring Bond’s escape from corrupt island police aboard a slow and lumbering double decker bus. The film has some negatives, but not too many. The character of Baron Samedi doesn’t fit in the film (check out that ludicrous closing shot, which seems to be hinting that Samedi is somehow immortal), and Clifton James’s brash southern cop is an immature and irritating character who might just as well have been left out of the final cut. On the whole this is a good start to the Moore era, though. One point of interest:- Live and Let Die also features a scene in Bond’s house at the very start….. only once before have we seen where Bond lives, and that was at the start of Dr No.\n\nNow, we’re talking.\n\nWhat Goldfinger does, that so many subsequent Bond movies forget, is not overdo things. It underplays everything. This is a movie of such effortless cool and style that it’s sweeps the viewer along with charm. Many Bond movies also jar between action and non-action scenes (The World is Not Enough, for instance). Goldfinger moves through the gears with aplomb.\n\nGoldfinger is so stylish that even the pre-credit sequence contains more cool than the entirety of most 007 films. You have the iconic wetsuit/tuxedo scene; Bond lighting a cigarette just as an explosion goes off; the unflinchingly brutality of Bond electrocuting a man then just turning away to make a quip; and finally him slamming the door – even than leads perfectly into the Shirley Bassey theme.\n\nEverything is pitch perfect. Goldfinger himself is the ideal combo of vulgar greed and gentlemanly host. A perfect foe for for Bond. Pussy Galore combines the voluptuousness of 60’s Bond girls with the spirit of the more modern ones. Connery himself is the epitome of Bond; charismatic, tough, ultra-suave.\n\nThere are plenty of standout scenes; the laser-beam table is unmatched in the series for sheer, pure tension; the aston martin chase is again one of the best in the series and shows up similar scenes in the likes of Die Another Day as merely visual showcases – this one is genuinely exciting. Bond’s fight with Oddjob set the template for numerous, ‘How do I stop this guy?’ cat-and-mouse fight scenes, especially in Spielberg movies.\n\nYou might argue than Goldfinger could do with at least one more action set-piece, as it does slow down before the climax whilst Bond is Goldfinger’s guest. But it wouldn’t really fit into the story. As a Bond film, Goldfinger is practically perfect. Connery even has the best wig.\n\nBest Bond movie ever.\n\nAuthor: MovieAddict2016 from UK\n\n7 May 2004\n\nGoldfinger could best be described as the quintessential, definitive Bond film, the first of the series to set the necessities of the entire saga in motion. It is also the best of the Bond movies, arguably the most suave and sophisticated, far superior to the Roger Moore era and those who followed in Connery’s footsteps. It is the Bond ultimatum, so to speak.\n\nGoldfinger was the first of the iconic legacy to feature Q (Desmond Llewelyn) as a recurring comic relief figure. (He was introduced in From Russia with Love, the second film in the series, where he was credited as Major Boothroyd, and given little screen time.) It was also the first to truly setup the suave nature of 007, the tongue-in-cheek humor (absent in the first movie, Dr. No), the far-fetched gadgetry (including fast cars, this one being an Aston-Martin) and, arguably, the first of the series to feature the famous line, “Bond, James Bond,” as a 007 catchphrase, versus a mere line of dialogue. When Bond storms out onto the patio of the motel room, the camera zooms in towards his face, the 007 theme song roars through the speakers, and he says his motto with cool confidence. It’s Bond, baby.\n\nBoth of Goldfinger’s predecessors were darker, more serious motion pictures — more in-tune with the writing of Fleming versus the suaveness to later be salvaged from the series with the third installment. Although Dr. No was a terrific movie, and although From Russia with Love is exciting, Goldfinger beats them both. It features the best (and most famous) Bond villain to ever grace the screen, constantly spoofed in countless productions: Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), the target of Austin Powers in Goldmember and, according to IMDb, referenced and spoofed in well over 100 other productions.\n\nThere isn’t much of a plot, really. Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world. Bond finds out and tries to put a stop to his mission. What entices us, and what makes the film so entertaining despite the absurdity, is its leniency towards itself. It doesn’t mind being silly because the entertainment value far outweighs any flaws. Plus, it has some of the most memorable scenes in history, and arguably the best Villain Explanation Scene to ever be recorded. “Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?” Bond (Sean Connery) asks as a laser beam slowly makes its way towards his groin. “No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!” he says with mock ridicule, before walking away. The following shots is one of the only sequences in James Bond history where the iconic character actually seems fairly worried that fate may be playing a deadly hand.\n\nReleased in 1964, forty years later it stands as one of the most risqué Bond films to date. Especially for its time, there is brief nudity during the opening credits, sexual scenes, constant innuendo (including a Bond girl named “Pussy Galore,” played by Honor Blackman) and implications of lesbianism.\n\nGalore’s sexual orientation is not delved into as deeply and explicitly as it may be dealt with in today’s day and age, but the inclusion exists. Bond struggles verbally with Galore, trying to woo and seduce her, and she subtly implies from their very first meeting that she will not be seduced, claiming it is impossible for Bond to get very far with her, thereby insinuating that she is, in fact, a lesbian. According to the director of the film, Guy Hamilton, the entire situation is given much more emphasis in the novel by Ian Fleming, but it was simply too foul a subject for audiences back in 1964. Surprisingly, the verbal exchanges and implications behind the subject matter are much more effective.\n\nAll of the actors in Goldfinger are, at the very least, very good. But of course, it is really Sean Connery who demands our utmost attention and respect, for it is Connery whose inhumanly strong screen presence launched Bond into the heights of Movie Legend.\n\nRecently in London I attended a James Bond exhibition, and as I made my way through a maze of Bond memorabilia and objects used in all twenty-something movies, I found myself realizing that the myth of 007 propels the films farther than anything else ever could. There is a sort of iconic legacy surrounding the entire Bond franchise that will probably never die. Different action heroes come and go, and nowadays Rambo looks criminally out of date, but Bond, in his black-and-white tuxedo, with all his suave sophistication, will never grow old, because he is a timeless hero who is comprised of all the greatest heroic attributes to ever be assembled, and although his style and looks may grow weary amid the changing ages, his character will remain the ultimate hero, and I very much doubt that we will ever live to see a day when Bond.\n\nThe superlative James Bond film\n\nAuthor: Kyle Milligan (toldyaso@planeteer.com) from Toronto, Canada\n\n20 July 1999\n\nFirst of all, I must state for the record, Sean Connery is THE James Bond. Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was “For Your Eyes Only” with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, “Goldfinger” is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I’d seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery’s Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear.\n\nNot a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery’s Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger’s captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. “Do you expect me to talk?” “No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!” A famous scene and line from Bond’s most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don’t even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it’s more than that. Even watching “Goldfinger” today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about “Goldfinger”. How could I? I hadn’t even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of “Goldfinger” is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn’t seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially “Goldfinger” and “Dr. No”, proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry’s scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven’t seen “Goldfinger” yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You’ll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey’s voice in the famous opening theme.\n\nBond’s third is a charmer\n\nAuthor: goya-4 from PA USA\n\n7 September 2000\n\nSean Connery’s third go around as James Bond has become the quisessential James Bond Flick and for good reason..from the catch opening chorus by Shirley Bassey and the intro pretty lady decked out in gold to oddjob’s hat and the name of the bond girl Pussy Galore..What else could one ask for? The most popular and arguable the best Bond as James tries to stop Goldfinger and his pilot from robbing Fort Knox.. On a scale of one to ten… Goldfinger strikes a 9\n\nGenuine candidate for “Worst Bond Ever”\n\nAuthor: Jack from Minnesota, USA\n\n9 January 2006\n\nI had a lot of problems with this movie. Let me list them:\n\n1) The number two person in the conspiracy to nuke Fort Knox changes sides and betrays her comrades…because Bond slept with her? Gimme a break. Judging from her personality, she’d be about the last person in the world I’d expect to do such a thing. It’s obvious that the writers couldn’t think of any way of getting out of the corner they’d written themselves into, so they tossed in a deus ex machina cop-out ending.\n\n2) Bond just doesn’t do much of anything in this movie. He spends the last half of the movie sitting in a cell while other characters run around and do things that don’t advance the plot one bit. It’s boring. I appreciate the fact that he uses his brains to get out of trouble, but he never really “gets out” of trouble, he just turns a bad situation into a slightly less bad one. This is about the only Bond movie where he’s so ineffectual, and it makes for a very unentertaining film.\n\n3) Bond allows himself to be captured by the bad guys so that he can go and check on the condition of a woman who got hit with a flying hat? He barely knew her! He gave her a ride to a gas station; that’s it. It makes no sense that he’d jeopardize his mission in order to check on the condition of a stranger. What was he going to do, give her CPR? He certainly didn’t want to be captured as part of any sort of plan, as he spent the next ten minutes of the movie trying to get away again.\n\n4) Why didn’t Goldfinger just kill Bond? He hit the nail right on the head when he said that Bond only knew the name of the operation (blockbuster), but he didn’t know any of the details. Then Bond tells him that if he is killed, they’ll send another agent. Well, obviously. Goldfinger certainly must have assumed as much. But how would anyone even know if Bond was killed? It was just another poorly thought out scene.\n\n5) Pussy Galore is a really unlikable character. Not only is she just plain homely, but she brags and brags and brags about herself.\n\n6) The ending on the plane felt very tacked on and silly. Are we to believe that a woman and a fat guy overpowered all the soldiers in a military aircraft hanger and stole a plane right out from under their noses?\n\nOh, there are a few good things about the movie. The Swiss Alps are beautiful, even in Summer. The car is really cool. And of course the theme song is fantastic.\n\nOverall, this is easily the worst Connery Bond film. Much worse than any Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby Bond movie. I can’t for the life of me understand why people hold it in such high esteem, the writing is just so ridiculously sloppy. I enjoy most of Connery’s other Bond films, but this thing sticks out like a big, stinky sore thumb.\n\nAwesome Bond film!\n\nAuthor: snash93 from United Kingdom\n\n27 June 2010\n\nThe third issue of the James Bond series, Goldfinger, hit the cinemas with a huge expectation following the success of its predecessors From Russia with Love and Dr.No and it didn’t disappoint. Goldfinger was the first of four Bond movies Guy Hamilton directed and with a budget of $3million and the gross revenue being $124.9million, it is safe to say that it was the crown jewel of his career and of the James Bond franchise.\n\nThe film has a rather basic storyline of how Goldfinger plans to raid Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world and Bond sets out to thwart him. Though the storyline may have been nothing special but the film’s use of iconography and presentation that made it outshine other Bond issues. Unlike the more recent Bond films such as Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace etc, Goldfinger has that James Bond feel to it. What I mean by this is that the newer Bond issues lack the conventions, which made it successful and unique for example there isn’t as much use of gadgets in newer Bond films. I mean you have a beautiful Aston Martin DB5 and not only has it got the speed, but those gadgets within it which Bond can utilise when he is in a chase scene, that can help make it epic and breathtaking.\n\nThis was shown very well in this film as Bond can shoot from using in his car, track villains down, and one particular gadget, the ejector seat, which simple but effective and amusing. There is something else which also stands out in this film and which is decreased in the newer Bond films and that is clichés. For me I think it is a huge mistake of not utilising clichés in up coming Bond films, as you look in modern times, we can watch so many films of the action/adventure genre, who now also use the similar conventions such as the gadgets, the fast cars etc, that you would want a film which is unique on its own. This is where I feel clichés are really important and how it shows this film having that James Bond feel than of Quantum of Solace for example.\n\nOne real famous cliché, which is used in this film, is when Sean Connery’s character says “The names Bond. James Bond”. The use of clichés in this film like the one I just quoted can show the iconic status of James Bond.\n\nThe acting in Goldfinger was absolutely superb especially of Sean Connery and Gert Frobe, who both had unique characters and were the perfect match in the antagonist and protagonist.\n\nThis film displayed Auric Goldfinger as a real legitimate threat and as a sadistic psychopath. There is a famous scene which shows this aspect of his character where a laser beam is about cut Bond in half, James says “Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?” to which Goldfinger replies “No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!”. In the following moments we see Bond worried and I feel this can allow us to recognise Auric Goldfinger as a powerful enemy and as an equal to Bond. The fact that we see James Bond anxious is very rare in the franchise as he has a very strong screen presence and there is an expectation of him being the powerful, authoritative figure.\n\nWith this expectation, the franchise shows itself as a fairytale and the film also displays this. The character of Bond shows to be a resilient hero that defeats the bad guy and saves the world. But the earlier Bond character, which was acted by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, showed wit and humour which so dearly lacks now. Now that we distinguished the traits and personality of the good character and the bad character, what else does every evil, manipulative villain need in the James Bond franchise? For those who haven’t guessed it, there is one word, which I’m looking and that’s henchman. Henchmen’s play a huge part in the Bond film chain (Stamper, Tee Hee and Gobinda to name a few) as they are presented as the unstoppable force that 007 has to fight. The main henchman in this film is Oddjob who is played by Harold Sakata and to be quite honest with you, he is my favourite henchman throughout the whole series.\n\nThe reason being is that he is silent, manservant of Goldfinger but is a ruthless killer and ends up having an epic battle with James Bond, who has to use his intelligence and resiliency to defeat the Korean born wrecking machine.\n\nAs always every Bond film needs Bond girls! Now first of all I would like us to consider the fact that Goldfinger was made in 1964, so naturally back then, the female gender was seen as the inferior sex however that did not stop the persistent use of sexual innuendo but it isn’t as explicit as it used in the more recent Bond movies. The main Bond girl in this film goes by the name of Pussy Galore (note the strong use of innuendo in the name!), but she isn’t the stereotypical Bond girl that gets taken in by 007.\n\nWhen we see her first meet James Bond, there is a clear indication that she will not be seduced and she is playing hard to get. With this we can make the clear assumption that she is not the stereotypical female, and to emphasise this further, in the film her profession is a pilot and she also has learnt judo, thus revealing the masculine nature in the character, evidently summing up why she isn’t easily taken in by Bond. Eventually however, she falls for him and again it’s mainly about Bond’s character, his wit, his bravery, and his intelligence. Having such characteristics is sure to woo even the likes of Galore.\n\nBond, Bowler Hats, Galore and the Man With the Midas Touch.\n\nAuthor: Spikeopath from United Kingdom\n\n21 April 2012\n\nGoldfinger is directed by Guy Hamilton and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum & Paul Dehn from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Gert Frobe, Honor Blackman, Shirley Eaton & Harold Sakata. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.\n\nOperation Grand Slam.\n\nConnery’s third outing as James Bond sees 007 investigating the movements of wealthy gold dealer Auric Goldfinger (Frobe). Little does 007 or MI6 know, but Goldfinger is hatching a master plan that will spell disaster for the world’s financial climate.\n\nUndeniably the turning point in the James Bond franchise, Goldfinger is also one of the most fondly remembered by the cinema loving public. Here is when Bond not only went go-go gadget crazy, but he also impacted on pop culture to the point the waves created are still being felt today. Bond traditionalists are often irked by the mention of the change Goldfinger represents, and with just cause, because this really isn’t Fleming’s core essence Bond. Bond has now become a gadget using super agent, a man who laughs in the face of death, a quip never far from his lips. Yet the hard facts are that this Bond is the one the world really bought into, ensuring for the foreseeable future at least, that this type of Bond was here to say. Marketing was high pitched, fan worship became feverish and the box office sang to the tune of $125 million. Toys, gimmicks and collectables would follow, the Aston Martin DB5 would become “The Most Famous Car in the World”, in 1964 Bond truly became a phenomenon.\n\nPurely on an entertainment front, Goldfinger delivers royally, the sets, casting and the high energy set-pieces all seep with quality. This in spite of the actual plot being one of the weakest in the whole franchise. As great a villain as Auric Goldfinger is, with a voice dubbed Frobe simply joyous in the role, his motives are rather dull and hardly cause for some worldwide Bondian panic. But the film rises above it to the point it only really registers long after the end credits have rolled. We have been treated to Odd Job (Sakata instantly becoming a Bond villain legend), that laser, the DB5 and its tricks, the delicious Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (still an awesome name today and still sounding like a character from a Carry On movie), the golf match, Shirley Eaton’s golden girl and the ticking time bomb finale played out during the chaotic scenes involving Ken Adam’s brilliantly designed version of Fort Knox.\n\nBond staples also serve the production well, the title sequence is neatly strung together as scenes from the movie play out over a writhing golden girl, who was model Margaret Nolan and who briefly appears in the film as Dink. The theme tune is a blockbuster, sang with gusto by Shirley Bassey and the locations dazzle the eyes as we are whisked to Switzerland, Kentucky and Miami. Stock characters continue to make their marks, with M, Moneypenny and Q (setting in motion the wonderful serious v jocular axis of his “to be continued” relationship with Bond), starting to feel like old cinematic friends. Only let down is Cec Linder’s turn as Bond’s CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter, gone is the swagger created by Jack Lord in Dr. No, and while Linder is no bad actor, he doesn’t sit right in the role, he’s looks too world weary. A shame because he is integral to how the plot pans out.\n\nDirector Guy Hamilton was helming the first of what would end up being four Bond movies on his CV, he made his mark by bringing more zip and quip to the Bond character. Connery was firmly ensconced in the role of Bond, he was a mega star because of it, but cracks were beginning to appear in how Connery viewed this gargantuan success and the impact it was having on his hopes to be viewed as a serious actor. However, he was signed up for Thunderball, the next James Bond adventure, and Terence Young would return to the director’s chair, could they top the success of Goldfinger? 9/10\n\nI have not seen the “original” from 1946 but anyway – I am not into black-and-white movies, with the exception of those with Chaplin and Lloyd perhaps. Thus, I decided to watch the one in question, besides, Jack Nicholson (as Frank Chambers) and Jessica Lange (as Cora Smith/Papadakis) are much more known and admired by me than John Garfield and Lana Turner… Their performances were really good (although not among their best), they had sizzling mutual chemistry, but it seems that the topic/script has become timeworn, seen at present as a rather trivial crime thriller, as the main theme – lovers trying to get rid of (rich) husband – has been exploited a lot. The plot does not run smoothly and the inclusion of e.g. Anjelica Huston as Madge Gorland did not provide any additional value; on the other hand, bigger inclusion of past history of the protagonists could have been interesting. The ending was also too abrupt and when the end credits appeared, one could feel confusion about the meaning of the title.\n\nUnderrated, but still not entirely realized\n\nAuthor: Dennis Littrell from United States\n\n10 July 2002\n\nThis remake of the 1946 film which starred Lana Turner and John Garfield is significantly better than its reputation. The script, adapted from James M. Cain’s first novel, is by the award-winning playwright David Mamet, while the interesting and focused cinematography is by Sven Nykvist, who did so much exquisite work for Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. An excellent cast is led by Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, whose cute animal magnetism is well displayed. Bob Rafelson, who has to his directorial credit the acclaimed Five Easy Pieces (1970) and The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), both also starring Jack Nicholson, captures the raw animal sex that made Cain’s novel so appealing (and shocking) to a depression-era readership and brings it up to date.\n\nHollywood movies have gotten more violent and scatological since 1981, but they haven’t gotten any sexier. This phenomenon is in part due to fears occasioned by the rise of AIDS encouraged by the usual blue stocking people. Don’t see this movie if sex offends you.\n\nLange is indeed sexy and more closely fits the part of a lower-middle class woman who married an older man, a café owner, for security than the stunning blonde bombshell Lana Turner, who was frankly a little too gorgeous for the part. John Colicos plays the café owner, Nick Papadakis, with clear fidelity to Cain’s conception. In the 1946 production, the part was played by Cecil Kellaway, who was decidedly English; indeed they changed the character’s name to Smith. Also changed in that production was the name of the lawyer Katz (to Keats). One wonders why. My guess is that in those days they were afraid of offending Greeks, on the one hand, and Jews on the other. Here Katz is played by Michael Lerner who really brings the character to life.\n\nJack Nicholson’s interpretation of Cain’s antihero, an ex-con who beat up on the hated railway dicks while chasing any skirt that came his way, the kind of guy who acts out his basic desires in an amoral, animalistic way, was not entirely convincing, perhaps because Nicholson seems a little too sophisticated for the part. Yet, his performance may be the sort better judged by a later generation. I have seen him in so many films that I don’t feel I can trust my judgment. My sense is that he’s done better work, particularly in the two films mentioned above and also in Chinatown (1974), One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) and such later works as The Shining (1980) and Terms of Endearment (1983).\n\nThe problem with bringing Postman successfully to the screen is two-fold. One, the underlying psychology, which so strongly appealed to Cain’s depression-era readership, is not merely animalistic. More than that it reflects the economic conflict between the established haves, as represented by the greedy lawyers, the well-heeled insurance companies, the implacable court system and the simple-minded cops, and to a lesser degree by property owner Nick Papadakis himself, and the out of work victims of the depression, the have-nots, represented by Frank and Cora (who had to marry for security). Two–and this is where both cinematic productions failed–the film must be extremely fast-paced, almost exaggeratedly so, to properly capture the spirit and sense of the Cain novel. Frank and Cora are rushing headlong into tragedy and oblivion, and the pace of the film must reflect that.\n\nA true to the spirit adaptation would require a terse, stream-lined directorial style with an emphasis on blind passions unconsciously acted out, something novelist Cormac McCarthy might accomplish if he directed film. I think that Christopher Nolan, who directed the strikingly original Memento (2000) could do it.\n\nFor further background on the novel and some speculation on why it was called “The Postman Always Rings Twice” (Cain’s original, apt title was “Bar-B-Que”) see my review at Amazon.com.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book “Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can’t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!” Get it at Amazon!)\n\nGrubby film noir\n\nAuthor: Leofwine_draca from United Kingdom\n\n25 July 2011\n\nThis novel adaptation was the second after a first movie in the 1940s. This one retains the period setting but ups the ante in terms of sexual content, featuring one of the most explicit sex scenes ever shown in a mainstream film which goes far further than any film before – or since.\n\nThe plot is simple in the extreme: the wife of a Greek man who runs his own diner, bored and neglected by her husband, begins a torrid affair with a drifter her husband employs as his mechanic. From there on in, the story gradually develops in often fascinating ways as the two lovers realise that only one thing’s stopping their happiness: her husband.\n\nThe film is shot through with a grim and gritty emphasis, best realised by Nicholson’s grubby mechanic. He’s nobody’s idea of a sex symbol, although Jessica Lange is quite ravishing as the object of his attentions. This focus on realism over Hollywood fantasy is what makes the film so watchable and, in places, uncomfortable as it becomes clear that the lovers have something of a sado-masochistic relationship.\n\nThings move into courtroom-drama territory later on (featuring some terrific acting work from Michael Lerner as the lawyer) whilst handing a number of blink-and-you’ll-miss-em minor parts to familiar faces (John P. Ryan as a blackmailer, Angelica Houston as – bizarrely – a circus owner, cult favourite Don Calfa as a circus hand, Brion James as a thug and Christopher Lloyd as a salsman).\n\nI found the film to be sometimes compelling and never boring. It’s one of those films you watch to find out just what happens to the central characters, a curiosity bolstered by the feeling that they’re never going to unentangle themselves from this mess. Come the surprise climax, well…you’ll have to see for yourself.\n\nA movie well worth seeing\n\nAuthor: brett lanza from West Caldwell, NJ\n\n21 July 1999\n\nI must admit I was quite impressed with Bob Rafelson’s adaptation of the depression era novel, “The Postman Always Rings Twice”. Jack Nicholson plays Frank, a vagabond who eventually falls in love with a sexy waitress named Cora,played by Jessica Lange, who reciprocates this love. However, there is one problem standing in the way: Cora is married, unhappily married, but married nonetheless.\n\nAside from an intriguing story, “The Postman Always Rings Twice” is a wonderfully put together film, as Rafelson does a splendid job delving into the characters and their relationships, as well as examining the problems associated with forbidden love. As a viewer, you truly feel the passion between Lange and Nicholson,(who both won academy award nominations), and you almost feel for their pain. In the 1930’s women in America were at quite a different position than they are today. They were expected to stay with the husband no matter what the circumstances, as divorce was quite uncommon. Lange was very convincing as this trapped 30’s woman who eventually broke free the only way she knew possible..\n\nI definitely recommend “The Postman Always Rings Twice” for any fan of entertaining and thought-provoking movies. Although the character development is not quite as extensive as some of Rafelson’s early work, particularly the 1971 classic “Five Easy Pieces”, the movie combines an intriguing screenplay with superb acting to make its own statement.\n\nDuring the Korean War, an American platoon is kidnapped by the North Koreans. When they return, one of them (Laurence Harvey) appears to be acting strangely. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the enemy did something to him, possibly to the point where they might still be in complete control of him.\n\nAdmittedly, “The Manchurian Candidate” is basically a Red Scare movie, but it’s different in that it doesn’t simply follow the silly story of the Commies invading a Norman Rockwell-style town. The movie’s focus is what the audience doesn’t know. Not to mention the top-notch performances from Harvey, Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury and John McGiver. Interestingly, the 2004 remake actually managed to be as good as the original. Ten out of ten.\n\nA political and social thriller/drama ahead of its time.\n\nAuthor: teren from Chicago, USA\n\n20 August 2001\n\nJohn Frankenheimer’s surrealistic direction and George Axelrod’s adaptation of the 1959 book by the same name offer Laurence Harvey a career defining role.\n\nSet in 1950’s, A Korean War veteran Raymond Shaw(Harvey) returns home to a medal of honor for rescuing his POW platoon from behind Chinese lines and back to safety. One of the returning soldiers, (played effectively by Frank Sinatra) however, has recurring dreams of his platoon being brainwashed and Shaw committing acts of murder.\n\nHe eventually convinces army brass that Shaw is still a puppet of his Communist-Marxist operators.\n\nAngela Lansbury, (although barely a few years older than Harvey was at the time) plays his mother in a tour de force role. She absolutely captivates and steals every scene she is in, playing a very complex role that needs to convince the viewer of many things without much dialogue.\n\nThere’s a rich cast of characters, including Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, James Edwards, and a painfully accurate James Gregory. Each character weaves through the methodical subplots and tapestry of Frankenheimer’s masterful “Hitchcockian” pace.\n\nI won’t give away the plot, but dear readers, allow me to sat that this one is really worth watching–until the nail-biting and chilling conclusion.\n\nThere are many undertones in this film — political, sexual, class and power, and social. You will want to view this film several times to approach it from different perspectives.\n\nA Powerful, Wicked Satire.\n\nAuthor: nycritic\n\n9 March 2005\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nBy the dawn of the 60s America had not been through with McCarthy-ism, the Korean War, and Communist witch hunts when it was already aiming towards a Cold War situation and ultimately, Vietnam.\n\nSo much plays into this movie which came out at exactly the right time and place that even years later, layers of subtext can be garnered from its paranoiac, frightening images.\n\nPower is a deadly thing to deal with, especially when it falls into the hands that should have it the least, and the word seems to dominate every angle of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE like a glowing ball of fire. The power to control minds and bend them to darker wills. The power to control the people into believing what the powers-that-be want. The power to demolish anything or anyone considered an even remote obstacle. The power to seize power, extend it outward, blindly, into a waiting globe.\n\nAnd so does this disturbing, dark tale of the search for power in the political world takes place, with some of the most indelible images ever transferred onto the face of cinema. Frankenheimer amps up the paranoia already oozing from the story and with some truly nightmarish sequences brings forth a Creation that always seems like it will disclose some hideous, unseen force playing behind the scene — the deceptive hydrangea scene at the beginning of the movie and the train scene where a shaken Sinatra meets Leigh who seems to be sincere are two very uneasy sequences to follow through, for example, because both disorient and succeed in sticking needles of doubt into your mind in more ways than one. You know something is completely wrong here and what lies beneath is always unsettling than what is eventually uncovered.\n\nThis is a character study as well as a political satire: while there is plenty of tension throughout, deep characterizations come through, and needless it is to me to state Angela Lansbury’s terrifying performance as Mrs. Iselin, or Laurence Harvey’s chilling portrait of a non-entity, a victim and a puppet who’s design is to serve as a killing machine and a false hero. Much can be also said of Janet Leigh’s Rosie, since her part suggests she also knows and is more than what she reveals, but sadly the film drops what might have been an interesting side story from the moment she appears on the train and talks in that coded language. It seems she only serves to be Sinatra’s “controller.” As for Sinatra himself, he’s an asset and a weakness. He’s too old to be Laurence Harvey’s equal in combat, and his persona often comes through, but he does tune in a measured performance as the damaged General Marco.\n\nMANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one of those stories that detail the loss of innocence in America (with its killing of the more honest Senator Thomas Jordan and his almost pure daughter Josie, done without music, but in two long takes) and its transition to a super-power bent on political domination, and it chills to the bone to see it still today, 42 years later.\n\nKeep Your Eye on the Card, Keep Your Eye on the Card…\n\nAuthor: tfrizzell from United States\n\n11 June 2004\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nIntense Cold War era masterpiece that seems to grow bolder and more intelligent with age. A group of U.S. soldiers are captured one night during the Korean War in 1952. Next thing the group remembers is arriving home with Laurence Harvey (one of the troops) being given the Medal of Honor for some unknown reason.\n\nHe immediately decides to go to New York City to get away from his over-protective mother (Oscar nominee Angela Lansbury) and her senator husband (a solid turn by character actor James Gregory). But nothing is quite what it seems. Harvey, obviously with no experience in journalism, becomes involved with a publication that is sympathetic with Communist propaganda. Meanwhile several other soldiers from Harvey’s battalion (commanding officer Frank Sinatra in particular) start to have disturbing dreams where the group is in a room during a dull women’s meeting where the main topic of discussion is botany. Flashes occur however where the women actually become Korean and Russian delegates that are all listening to a crazed doctor (Khigh Dhiegh) who is discussing brainwashing techniques and total mind manipulation through various kinds of hypnosis. The dreams are rough and frightening.\n\nIt seems that Sinatra has a rare form of war fatigue, but there is no way to explain how others are having similar night-time delusions. As he tries to cope he falls in love with the beautiful Janet Leigh and they start to have a relationship. Eventually Sinatra begins to put the jagged pieces together just as Harvey becomes serious with a beautiful young woman (Leslie Parrish) whose father (John McGiver) happens to be one of Gregory’s main obstacles to a possible vice presidential nomination in the next national election. Who is really controlling everything from the inside and what is Harvey’s main purpose for being brainwashed? Richard Condon’s paranoid novel comes to life vividly in a truly outstanding motion picture. Screenwriter George Axelrod’s adaptation keeps the momentum of the book at a fevered pitch throughout. Director John Frankenheimer (only 32 at the time) completed the one film that he would always be remembered for.\n\nHis career honestly had a lot more lows than highs, but his full potential as a first-class film-maker is easy to recognize here. The performances are top-notch with Lansbury (actually only three years older than Harvey) doing the best work of her career (albeit in a somewhat small role). Laurence Harvey’s tortured character is also a sight to behold. It is an immensely interesting role that keeps the whole production glued together. Harvey, an actor I really never thought had much talent, proves that when everything else is working well that he can be a reputable performer. And of course Sinatra is solid as he always was throughout a film career that hit its peak from about 1950 through 1965. Once again he adds a certain depth and an amazing complexity to an already rich role. Smart, stylish, at times nasty and always impressive, “The Manchurian Candidate” is one of those pictures that continues to be a fixture in the American cinema as time goes by. 5 stars out of 5.\n\nExcellent Cinema\n\nAuthor: Hobbes_512 from Chicago, IL\n\n3 July 2003\n\nI went into “The Manchurian Candidate” without knowing too much about the movie itself. I knew about its critical acclaim, but I was unfamiliar with the plot. Regardless, when I rented and watched the film, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed either.\n\nThe plot revolves around the strange case of Raymond Shaw, a sergeant who wins the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the cold war. Two of the men in his company, however, have strange nightmares that suggest Raymond is not as deserving of the award as he seems. One of these men, Major Bennet Marco, led on by these recurring nightmares, unravels a sinister Communist plot.\n\nSet against the cold war paranoia of the sixties and McCarthyism, “The Manchurian Candidate” does an excellent job of recreating the intense suspense and tension of the time.\n\nThe acting in this film is superb. A great script is heightened by excellent acting in this movie. It’s hard not to like Frank Sinatra in his role as Marco, who is the protagonist. Laurence Harvey as Raymond does a good job showing us a character that is wholly unlikable and snobby, yet pathetic and sad at the same time. And of course, Angela Lansbury in her role as Raymond’s malicious and plotting mother is excellent.\n\nSome stand-out scenes in the film were the nightmare sequences that brilliantly interlaced dream and reality, the all-queen solitaire game with Marco and Raymond, and the supremely tense climax at the political convention. The cinematography in the movie was very well done as action, romance, and tension all mixed together smoothly. All the scenes managed to keep my attention and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. As a thriller, the film works remarkably well, and it is quite easily the best political thriller I’ve seen to date.\n\nKeeping me from giving the movie a perfect ten are one or two little nagging problems. I wasn’t a big fan of the music for the movie, and it even disrupted the mood for me at one point in the film. It was okay, just not great. Also, the whole plot is sort of unlikely. I wont go into it here, but I don’t think that the Communist plan for world domination would fall into the hands of one relatively uncontrolled person, no matter how well trained his mind was. That’s just my opinion, however.\n\nThe movie is sort of long, and isn’t exactly action packed, but it is very interesting, insightful, and even chilling. I had a great time watching it, and I definitely recommend it if you are interested at all in seeing a gripping Cold War era political thriller. Besides, the cultural relevance of the film alone is enough to see it.\n\n9/10\n\nThe look and atmosphere in this film is so vivid that even viewed on TV it makes you feel as if you have been to Niagara Falls sometime in the early 1950s. The plot takes a deceptively leisurely pace but it builds to a gripping climax. It is worth the viewer’s time & effort to stick with it to the end. Marilyn Monroe is radiantly treacherous & her performance is subtle and bears close watching beyond her obvious attractiveness. She should get a lot more credit for this picture than I’ve seen others give her. Joseph Cotten balances between being menacing & getting our pity & sympathy. Not all the performances are terrific but this movie is a gem that rewards the effort to stick with it to the end.\n\nTwo forces of nature – Marilyn and Niagara Falls\n\nAuthor: blanche-2 from United States\n\n11 October 2005\n\nBeauty abounds in “Niagara,” a 1953 film starring Marilyn Monroe, Joseph Cotten, and Jean Peters. There’s the beauty and power of Niagara Falls, spectacularly displayed throughout the movie, and the beauty of Marilyn Monroe, who is gorgeous in Technicolor. Monroe is the unhappy wife of the unstable George Loomis, played by an appropriately seedy Joseph Cotten. It’s not clear whether or not Marilyn drove him to his present state, but he’s wound pretty tight. Monroe and her lover plan George’s demise via the falls. Jean Peters and Max Showalter are a vacationing couple who become more involved than they want to, Peters bearing the acting burden of the film. The casting is great (although the Peters role originally was supposed to go to Anne Baxter). Peters’ wholesome prettiness is in sharp contrast to Monroe’s va-va-va-voom.\n\nHaving grown up near the Falls, it was both interesting and enjoyable to see them featured. And, as we all know who’ve been there, the Canadian side, where this movie was filmed, is far more beautiful. Given today’s security problems, I loved the scene where Monroe intended to walk across to the American side to avoid being questioned while in a car.\n\nI’ve seen candid photos of Marilyn Monroe taken around the time of filming, and she was surely at the peak of her beauty and sensuality. Though I’ve always felt her very careful enunciation detracted from her dramatic acting, she’s very good as the cheating wife. It’s funny to read occasionally that the physical standard of beauty is thinner today – her figure, like the rest of her, is fabulous, shown off in a variety of clothing by Dorothy Jeakins, who was a prominent costumer on Broadway and in film.\n\nThere’s really not much to the story of “Niagara.” It’s a standard tale of love, betrayal, and murder set against a magnificent backdrop and given spark by spirited performances. Well worth seeing.\n\nNoir Goes Over The Falls: Awful\n\nAuthor: Archangel Michael from United States\n\n6 July 2015\n\nSpoilers Ahead:\n\nI adore Film Noir, as huge as my collection is, I just threw this away. Sadly, Showalter and Monroe the one two punch of awful. Showalter ruined two other Noirs; he is like that neighbor next door that sells insurance that only comes when you are really busy. You keep trying to get rid of him and he doesn’t take a hint. The most annoying actor of the 50s with that eternal highly medicated happiness only found in the severely brain damaged.\n\nLook, Marilyn was gorgeous but she could never act. The only good shot is from behind of her walking away; whenever Marilyn speaks it is painful. Billy Wilder said it took hundreds of takes to get one passable scene out of her in Some Like It Hot. Can you tell here? The movie is a disaster. Monroe and Showalter stink it up big time. It is so slow with lots of shots of the falls; yes, they are pretty we get it, move on, could we? It starts so slowly with Cotton being set up by a slinky, bad acting bimbo, forgive me. She is so awful here; Hathaway must not have had the patience Wilder had. The first half an hour nothing happens; when we finally get to the murder of Marilyn’s lover, it is off camera, like the film needed more boredom.\n\nThe Canadian detective is more wooden than a redwood, like Mr. Spock, the Canadian years, awful. Cotten is fine, he gives his usual great acting performance but he is surrounded by bad actors and the script goes nowhere slowly. After Cotton kills Marilyn’s lover, he stalks her half heartedly, finally kills her then goes back to apologize to her after she is dead. How weird is that? This is the script; do not believe the raving reviews. I have a huge collection of Noirs, I just cannot have it in my collection.\n\nShowalter is so bad even worse than Marilyn who at least you can stare at; the worst actor in the 50s. The script has Cotten stealing a boat without checking how much gas is in it; the most improbable events occur next. I cannot tell you how bad this is, boring, poorly acted and the writing is even worse. Sorry Marilyn fans, Wilder got good performances out of her in Some Like It Hot and Asphalt Jungle; she is just awful here. She has a habit of over-expressing with her eyebrows that is unintentionally comic. A Dreadful Attempt At Noir\n\nExcellent, Engaging Hitchcockian Thriller\n\nAuthor: WritnGuy-2 from New Jersey\n\n17 April 2001\n\nI rented “Niagara” for two reasons: one, the obvious reason to see Marilyn Monroe in such a unique role for her, and two, I always liked the idea of a side character (in this case, Jean Peters) getting inadvertently swept up in the intrigue of the main characters (Monroe and Joseph Cotten here). It’s rare that the supporting characters of a film are integrated so well into the plot. Usually, they disappear or are seen less of as the plot progresses. (eg: the inexorable quirky friend of a leading lady in far too many thrillers) But I digress.\n\nThe plot is fairly simple, or so it seems. Polly and Ray Cutler (Peters and Max Showalter) are a young couple heading to Niagara Falls for a delayed honeymoon. Upon their arrival, they meet Rose and George Loomis (Monroe and Cotten), who are over-staying in their time in the Cutlers reserved cabin. Though Polly and Ray agree to stay in a nearby cabin, that is not the last they see of the Loomis’s, a strange couple indeed. One day, Polly sees Rose passionately kissing another man (Richard Allan). Then, the sly Rose angers her husband by playing a seemingly reminiscent song on a record player a few other couples are dancing to, pushing George to destroying the record in his hands. It becomes apparent that something far more than infidelity is going on, and without giving away too many of the plot twists, murder ensues.\n\nOne of the things I really loved about this movie was how timeless it was. The actors, or at least Monroe and Cotten, may be familiar actors of the time, but this movie could be done at any time, and seem appropriate. And speaking of actors, the acting in this movie, for the most part anyway, is wonderful. Monroe, needless to say, was flawless, and I loved every second she was on the screen. Joseph Cotten, as he did in Hitchcock’s “Shadow of a Doubt,” has the ability of being very intimidating, almost brooding, and was terrific. Jean Peters gives an Oscar-worthy performance.\n\nShe’s very realistic, and impeccably likable. She manages to almost steal the movie from Monroe. I’m sorry to say Max Showalter was, well, really quite flat. The worst of the lot. Good thing he wasn’t in a large role, though he still is one of the stars of the film. In supporting roles, Denis O’Dea gave a typical detective role as Inspector Sharkey, popping in once in a while. Richard Allan had little to do as Rose’s lover Patrick. Showing up later in the film were Don Wilson and Lurene Tuttle as Ray’s boss and the boss’s wife, at Niagara Falls to vacation with the Cutlers. Both were excellent, though their roles were somewhat small. I liked the addition of their characters.\n\nThe chemistry between all the characters is terrific, particularly in the scene where Polly is bandaging George’s hand after he breaks the record. The two of them have many scenes together, and I loved how Peters and Cotten interacted with one another. Showalter seemed consistently nervous around Monroe, while on the topic of spouse-switching, so to speak.\n\nOverall, “Niagara” is very engaging. There is a good deal of action, especially towards the end. The chase scene through the bell tower was suspenseful, and the climax on the falls was absolutely wonderful. Polly proved herself to be very tough and a quick-thinker, and, throughout the rest of the movie, I liked how she didn’t turn to Ray every time a problem arose. (Which made the final confronation between only her and the other character so much fun, because no one could save Polly but herself.) I think that’s why I liked her character so much. Though, one thing to note, is the sort of silly-looking moment during the scene towards the end of the movie when George is pursuing Polly along the Falls (muted besides the sound of rushing water) and she slips and breaks through the wooden banister. It was a startling scene (I honestly thought she’d fall) but sort of funny, the way the movie sped up quickly to make it look to sudden. Oh well, blame it on technical abilities.\n\nI definitely recommend this film, not just for Hitchcock fans and Monroe fans, but for anyone, even if you don’t like older films. This one is a classic, but at the same time, feels as if it could have been made only twenty years ago, not almost fifty.\n\na formulaic Hollywood endeavour in the 1950s\n\nAuthor: lasttimeisaw from Cairo, Egypt\n\n16 September 2015\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nA Film-Noir shot in Technicolor and stars Marilyn Monroe as the femme fatale, NIAGARA kick-starts a banner year for Monroe in 1953, with two even bigger splashes following in the same year, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, she would become one of the most bankable actress of her time, a sex symbol, an eternal icon.\n\nThe phenomenal Niagara Falls are maximally deployed through director Henry Hathaway’s (TRUE GRIT 1969) efforts, the awe-inspiring scenery, not merely serves as a locale in the film, where our protagonists, two couple, George and Rose Loomis (Cotten and Monroe) and Ray and Polly Cutler (Showalter and Peters) frequently visit (where an off-screen murder takes place), but also functions as a metaphor of George’s final doom (from the opening scenes) and a perfect template for the final engaging cliff-hanger.\n\nThe story is not as convoluted as other film-noir exemplars, Rose is determined to get rid of her jaded husband George, so she plots with her young lover Patrick (Allan) to dispatch him and make it look like an accident near the Falls. While Ray and Polly are wide-eyed honeymooners involved with the plan by happenstance. Rose’s plan goes awry with a twist of revealing who is the one being murdered? Thanks to a lame plot-hole which allows the survivor to send the same signal to confuse our comprehension. Only within 5 minutes, the truth will reveal itself, and the film changes its orbit to a standard thriller with a vengeful heart, finally, a man must pay the price of killing the woman he loves.\n\nIt is interesting for viewers to buy the prerequisite that Monroe plays a heartless schemer, well, she pulls off a certain degree of credibility in the course, which is poles apart from her most well-known screen image, yet, we haven’t seen too much wit in her murder plan, neither is her prowess in choosing a right muscle to accomplish the job. When the scale being tipped, she fits more dutifully in the victim niche, where she runs away from a man who is resolute in taking her life.\n\nAlbeit an unsatisfactory character-building, Monroe takes on every opportunity to parade her appeal, a deadly poison will lead any man to his ruination. When she hums the enchanting theme song KISS (written by Lionel Newman and Haven Gillespie), no man can resist that tantalisation.\n\nJean Peters, is set as the antithetical good girl against Monroe’s dangerous attraction, a beauty with no thorns, demure, warmhearted and courageous, a perfect wife (as Howard Hughes would prove that) marries to a rather unappealing man Ray, who is gregarious but wanting any personalities. As if the picture was sending a double-standard message: for a man, even you are as ordinary as Ray, you still can marry a girl like Polly, while, for a woman as gorgeous as Polly, you should settle for a man like Ray, he is a complete dull but at least he is bankable. That leaves a bitter taste, the so-called Hollywood-ian brainwashing of gender inequality.\n\nOtherwise, it is an acceptable flick, the vision of the Falls alone can be pleasantly overwhelming, in addition to Monroe’s unique magnetism, although a stroke of bathos is rendered charmlessly when she is no longer in the picture. When the boat weighs anchor, its destination is predestined, so is the life or death payoff of the two characters aboard, a formulaic endeavour.\n\nCritical response\n\nWhen the film was released, The New York Times praised the film, if not the acting. They wrote in January 1953, “Obviously ignoring the idea that there are Seven Wonders of the World, Twentieth Century-Fox has discovered two more and enhanced them with Technicolor in Niagara… For the producers are making full use of both the grandeur of the Falls and its adjacent areas as well as the grandeur that is Marilyn Monroe… Perhaps Miss Monroe is not the perfect actress at this point.\n\nBut neither the director nor the gentlemen who handled the cameras appeared to be concerned with this. They have caught every possible curve both in the intimacy of the boudoir and in equally revealing tight dresses. And they have illustrated pretty concretely that she can be seductive – even when she walks. As has been noted, Niagara may not be the place to visit under these circumstances but the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see.”\n\nThis was a magnificent thriller – Douglas was great, Close was marvelous, but Ann Archer was the greatest. Great concept, excellent filming, perfectly executed acting. What more could one desire? Definite edge-of-the-seat pace – NOT a waste of time to see. I own the video, and I do not own many videos; this was the perfect see-it-over-and-over film. Even now, at age 50+, there are scenes that are the best I have ever witnessed in a movie. Douglas portrayed many men who finds his lover pregnant, though perhaps a bit more understanding in his initial attempt to support the woman. Close portrayed the unexpressed emotions of many women who have been in this situation, anger personified and vengeance motivated. The fact that her mental makeup was destroyed prior to her affair makes no difference in the expression of emotions, until, of course, she takes her emotions out on the family. Men, take notice! This could happen to you if you choose to have an affair. 🙂\n\nJustifiably one of the most talked-about movies ever\n\nAuthor: moviefan08 (moviefan08@yahoo.com)\n\n7 December 2003\n\nThere are a handful of movies out there that have become so ingrained in our collective dialogue as an American society, it’s practically a crime to have not seen them. If you haven’t experienced the joy of Casablanca, you probably haven’t seen from where “Here’s looking at you, kid” originally came. Ever heard someone make jokes about quarter pounders with cheese in France? That’s Pulp Fiction, ladies and gentlemen. Ever have anyone make you an “offer you can’t refure?” Well, that person’s seen The Godfather. Ever had a former one-night stand try to inflict long-running physical and psychological pain on you and your family? Err…probably not, but if you haven’t seen 1987’s Fatal Attraction, you’re missing out on one of the biggest pop-culture phenomenons of recent decades.\n\nBecause of Swimfan and other subpar (but, in Swimfan’s case, guiltily entertaining) efforts of tribute and homage, the plot of Fatal Attraction (and maybe even its ending) is obvious before the movie even starts. Adrian Lyne’s (last year’s magnificent Unfaithful) film is about Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), a New York lawyer with an attractive wife (Anne Archer) and little girl who takes a walk on the wild side one weekend and has a passionate liason with an originally casual acquaintance, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). Dan wants it all to be over right afterwards, but Alex doesn’t let him cut it off that quickly. Dan begins being harrassed by Alex in mounting forms of revenge that eventually reach his family – and become deadly (cheesy writing, huh?). Alex’s continual acts of vengeance aren’t easy to fight back against, though, for Dan must try to keep his secret from his wife and deal with the moral and legal implications that become increasingly complicated.\n\nIf it sounds like a ‘typical’ movie of that sort, it is. Why? Because it was the prototype for all the rest of them to come. One can’t really dock the movie for being the typical “affair goes dead wrong” movie, because it was the first one of its kind that truly perfected the formula. It’d be like saying Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew is WAAAAY too much like 10 Things I Hate About You. The thing is, Fatal Attraction really defied the expectations that I had set for it. The movie starts out kind of like Lyne began last year’s Unfaithful – happy family together, and the parents getting ready to go out to a soiree. At that evening’s party, Dan, while away from his wife, runs into Alex for the first time, and the sparks begin to fly. Now, the movie’s title kind of gives away the fact that the woman is going to go completely nuts on him later, but James Dearden’s screenplay, and Glenn Close’s careful rendering of her character makes Alex a decent person to begin with. I was immediately impressed that Alex isn’t some creepy, eccentric vixen that looks like bad news to begin with.\n\nThe inevitable begins, and Dan’s wife and child must go away for the weekend. Alex turns up at a meeting at Dan’s law firm, and shortly thereafter the affair begins. Right before they engage in some of the most protracted and unintentionally funny sex in film history, Lyne gives us an exquisite little scene in a restaurant between Dan and Alex. This is one of the crucial scenes in the film, for it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Unlike Unfaithful, the two don’t spend an increasingly longer amount of time with each other and then hastily have sex. Their dialogue right before their first tryst is direct. Like consenting adults, they simply agree that they’re going to do it. No dancing around his apartment to sexy jazz music, no braille cookbook seduction. They simply sign a verbal agreement and then go at it on the kitchen sink, complete with running water and Douglas’s odd obsession with having Close’s breast in his mouth. The rest of their weekend consists of sex, more sex, and even more sex, with the obligatory ‘funny scene where they almost get caught doing it in public.’ The movie really takes off on it’s nail-biting, visceral course when Dan decides he must leave.\n\nThe woman goes nuts, and that’s an understatement. Calls and unexpected visits occur. Alex calls the house, but just stays silent when Dan’s wife answers. Family pets are murdered. The tension mounts unbearably. The whole section of the film leading up to its exciting conclusion really makes an amazing impact. I had a huge list of expectations for what certain things would happen, but most of them didn’t. This may be the prototypical erotic revenge thriller, but it certainly jumps over some of its own limitations. Anne Archer, Dan’s wife, is an interestingly written character, for she is unsuspecting of it all until, well, until Dan must break down and confess. There is no bra discovered that isn’t hers, no story that doesn’t check out with someone else, no ‘why have you been so distant since that one weekend when I left you completely alone?’ All of the tension in the movie lies with what Alex will do next to remind Dan that he can’t just let her go.\n\nThe movie throws out another convention by actually letting Alex meet Dan and his wife in an incredibly uncomfortable scene where Alex slyly obtains their phone number after it has been changed. Fatal Attraction, along with its incredible building suspense, becomes less and less of the cookie-cutter genre film that it’s been categorized as. This is in part thanks to amazing work by Close. As the movie’s ‘villain,’ she radiates a dangerous sexuality and inital vulnerability that makes a great combination. Once she goes apes**t on Dan, she’s simply a blast to watch. In that ‘please let me never cross paths with a woman like her’ sense, of course.\n\nI love Fatal Attraction for much of the same reason that I loved Unfaithful. Hidden carefully beneath the movie’s “thriller” facade is actually an excellent morality fable. This is hinted at when Alex is introduced as a likeable, sympathetic character, but fully fleshed-out once Dan must go back to his family.\n\nSure, the woman’s a freak, but Dan was the one that had the affair with her, so he’s somewhat responsible. He told her that things would have to end, but no affair can just be extinguished like that. When he nicely tells her that it can’t continue, I actually kind of felt bad for Alex. Sex has an emotional attachment to it that Dan tried to put behind him, but Alex couldn’t. There is a crucial plot twist introduced into the film nearly halfway through that I won’t reveal here, but it adds most importantly to the whole idea of Dan’s moral quandry. At times, I was torn. For a while, Alex is simply a fling that’s hanging on and one actually feels sympathy for her somewhat. Sure, it’s all dispelled by the end of the film, but for a while the movie really turns the preconceived notions of its characters upside-down. Dan is trying to get back to his family, but isn’t he somewhat of a creep for screwing around in the first place? That’s the rocky terrain of infidelity, and Lyne’s film explores it with an underlying expertise that can be seen through all the knife-weilding and bunny-boiling.\n\nThe movie has a handful of truly exciting, somewhat violent scenes that add an extra punch to its escalating progress. At one point, Dan breaks into Alex’s apartment and has a violent encounter with her as he tells her to quit messing with his family. Alex enacts schemes of such raw cruelty, it’s easy to understand why Dan is scared to death of her. Nothing compares to the movie’s violent, bloody finale that has become a movie thriller landmark (one word, guys: catfight). It’s truly one of the most well-done and exciting action scenes in film, and it’s a bravura closer to a movie that deserves nothing less. Sure, it may not do anything creative to tie up the ends of the movie, but I’m glad Lyne used such an explosive scene. On the Special Edition DVD, an alternate ending can be viewed, and I was disappointed – it may be more creative and mean more in the context of the film (and may be technically better), but I’ll stick with punches, guns, and knives for my revenge flick finales any day.\n\nFatal Attraction is and always will be one of the most exciting, nail-bitingly intense, and entertaining movies of all time. It got six Academy Award nominations in 1987, including nods to Glenn Close and Anne Archer AND Best Picture. That’s a testament to how much of a phenomenon it was then, but the fact that it stands up so well even today says so much more. GRADE: A-\n\nAn unforgettable movie\n\nAuthor: Kristine (kristinedrama14@msn.com) from Chicago, Illinois\n\n13 February 2004\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nOne of the most talked about films of all time, Fatal Attraction, where married men learned a very valuable lesson: keep the pants zipped. I don’t think there was a more talked about film in the 80’s than Fatal Attraction, it made so many people think.\n\nIt was a very intelligent thriller with great characters and a terrifying story. How many women get rejected by a man and haven’t fantasized about just ruining their lives as revenge? Alex Forrest was the woman who didn’t just fantasize, but lived it. How many men have a woman who won’t let go of them no matter what they do? Even vice versa, but this was the movie that scared men right back into their wife’s arms.\n\nDan Gallagher is a successful, happily-married attorney living in Manhattan when he meets Alex Forrest. While his wife, Beth, and daughter are out of town for the weekend, he has a passionate affair with Alex. Though he thought it was understood to be a simple fling, she begins clinging to him. Dan explains that he must go home and Alex cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She continues to call until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. She then phones his home at all hours, and then confronts him saying that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. She will do anything at this point to make him be with her, even if it means destroying his family.\n\nGlenn Close who had only played the nice girl roles blew everyone’s mind when she played Alex Forrest. What passion she put into the role and part of you couldn’t really hate her. She brings up a great point to Dan “Because I won’t allow you to treat me like some slut you can just bang a couple of times and throw in the garbage?”. Your heart does break for her but at the same time you want to scream at her to let go of Dan and not hurt his family. Michael Douglas as Dan plays the role extremely well. He gives Dan a sense of realism, he’s not a major jerk who just looks for random women, he makes a mistake and owns up to it. He’s still very smart, but very frightened and rightfully so when he learns what Alex can do to him. You believe that he loves his family, he made a bad choice and don’t we all? The consequences were a bit extreme this time.\n\nAnn Archer as Beth was not only beautiful, classy, but incredibly intelligent. She makes Beth so real and I loved her line that I found out was improvised when Dan tells her that he cheated “What is the matter with you?!”, how many women or men have screamed that when getting hurt? Ellen Hamilton Latzen as Ellen, their daughter, is one of the best child actors you could imagine. She doesn’t make her character annoying and when she sees her parents crying, she breaks down and you just want to hold her so badly. What talent at such a young age. Fatal Attraction was made so well and the reason why I think it holds up is because it is a very intelligent movie with great characters. You could relate in one way or another. Just a side note, I do wish they stuck with the original ending since it would have made more sense with Alex’s character, I won’t give it away, but it also would have been ironic with her and Dan’s love for “Madame Butterfly”. But people wanted to see Alex get what she had coming after her being named a “bunny boiler”. But trust me when I say this is one of the best movies to come out of the 80’s and I still love watching it.\n\n9/10\n\nMade me squirm\n\nAuthor: Ralpho from United States\n\n9 September 2001\n\nAlthough I found myself checking the elapsed time during this movie to get some idea of when it would end, the final scenes made me squirm with sympathetic fright for the characters.\n\nRoger Ebert says the filmmakers ruined a perfectly good psychological thriller by attaching a “Friday the 13th” ending. The IMDb Trivia page says the movie originally had a different ending in which Glenn Close’s character commits suicide and Michael Douglas’ character is arrested for her murder. Ebert and most serious film lovers would likely have preferred that ending. But making profitable movies sometimes means making them unpalatable for highbrow students of film.\n\nNevertheless, the “flawed” film resonated with women. I have vague memories of female friends and acquaintances in the late ’80s seeing “Fatal Attraction” as an example of what SHOULD happen to any man who cheats on his wife. The movie found a place in our culture for a while, and the title was a euphemism for similar happenings in real life.\n\nOne wonders how much this movie had to do with the near universal creation of “stalker laws” in the 1990s.\n\nWhy I Became A Philosopher\n\nAuthor: Light Sword Of The Protector from Kneeling In The Light\n\n7 August 2015\n\nSpoilers Ahead:\n\nI detested Flashdance, 9 and a half weeks and Jacob’s Ladder was painful. It is hard to believe the same man made this very scary movie.\n\nRenowned for its pop out scares and surprises, that I will not spoil for you, suffice to say, if you are eating during the movie, have a good grip on your food. Full of Death symbolism, she: wears black constantly, lives near a slaughterhouse, everyone she knew is dead, there are allusions that she is some kind of supernatural force. Apart from this, they meet, have fun and he cannot shake her. There are hints that she did something to that older man in her past. The movie is quite linear, Alex starts as a minor annoyance in Dan’s life; the degrees of crazy that she begins evincing give the movie its suspense. She turns from a jilted lover to a potential mass murdering maniac. The progression is believable and well written. It moves just like real life, yet, she will surprise you with little pop outs of just how nuts she really is. No movie is perfect, especially an Adrian Lyne movie. Fat boy and wife, Dan’s friends are quite annoying and inappropriate. It kills the intensity of the movie. Pankin was a big star on an HBO comedy show at this time. His scenes have not aged well. Imagine how good this would be and how much higher the intensity without a bad stand up comic as the couple’s friends.\n\nDouglas seems to know this, given his experience. Look at the pained look on his face when Fat Boy takes over the movie with his unfunny routine. The same flaw as Flashdance with hamburger boy who also killed the intensity with bad humor. This could have been a masterpiece if the couple’s friends weren’t a bad comic and his wife. Yet, it will scare you: I guarantee it. The movie plays with you; the old she is gone forever and we are safe now trick. The movie was attacked in 1987 for showing a child in danger; this had already been broken the year before, in 1986, with Aliens. The movie has graphic violence and is quite intense. Close does a very believable psychotic sociopath. This is not for children. While the violence is tame, by today’s standards, the intensity remains. It also has lots of nudity and wild kitchen sex which are mild by today’s depravations. A monster hit in 1987, it shot Lyne to the stars, Jacob’s Ladder took care of that.\n\nThe ending is one of the scariest and most controversial. Feminists may be offended by his actions. He could have shot her in the legs; the death shot was justified by the charge she made at him. It was attacked as misogynistic and gratuitous in the name of scaring the crap out of people. I never had a problem with it. She charges and gives him little choice. The stresses that infidelity puts on a marriage will evoke laughter within this Zeitgeist. Lyne spends some time showing the devastation of Beth at learning of Dan’s affair and the impact on the little girl. This is now quite anachronistic; it will seem odd to today’s viewer. Our culture has little or no taboo on affairs like they was in 1987. The movie is slow at the beginning but once it gets going, there is no stopping until the terrifying ending. The Only Adrian Lyne Movie Worth Owning.\n\nthe norms of an affair\n\nAuthor: annabegins1883 from rochester ny\n\n9 October 2001\n\nFatal Attraction is a movie that plays on your preconcieved notions about relationships and affairs and then makes you question why things should be the way you expect they should. The movie is about a family man(Michael Douglas) who has a weekend affair with Glen Close’s character while his wife and daughter are away. He expects that the affair is a one time deal just for that weekend but she hounds him at the office and home and turns into an obsessive stalker. At first I was sympathetic to the man but then I wound up asking myself why should the women not be allowed to be treated with respect? why should the man not be expected to handle his responsibility? The movie left me questioning why I was so ready to recognize the woman as crazy and made me wonder about reasonable ramifications of affairs. This movie is more than a simple scarry movie about a psychostalker, it tests people ideas of what the normal and acceptable role af men and women is.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is clearly finding it difficult to follow the phenomenal success of “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction”, which made him the hottest writer-director of his generation. In the six years since then this is the only time that he has returned to the directors chair. “Jackie Brown” – his “difficult third film” – seems to be his response to criticism of his first two films that he could only make movies about other movies, but not real life. He cleverly anticipates the backlash by adapting a tightly plotted, character driven Elmore Leonard novel, still set in his familiar world of LA low-lives, but keeping to a minimum his trademark comic-book violence and pop-culture references, while emphasising the novels more mature themes – such as ageing and the feeling of time running out for the middle-aged characters.\n\nThe result is a slick, interesting, if slightly draggy thriller, which ultimately lacks the freshness and audaciousness of those earlier films.\n\nTarantino still has his maverick streak though, as displayed in his trusting of Pam Grier to carry the entire movie. The casting of a middle-aged black actress with no box-office clout in the lead role can’t have been easy in an industry notorious for it’s scant regard for actresses after they reach 30. You can bet that the studios would have at least insisted on the safety of a Sharon Stone or a Demi Moore. But Tarantino, as he did when casting Travolta, stuck to his gut-instinct, and once again it proved an inspired choice. Grier, bringing with her the memories of her 70’s blackploitation movies, gives a convincingly tough, wise and sympathetic performance.\n\nActors love to work with Tarantino because the roles he gives them will be invariably jucier than usual.\n\nThat is once again the case here, although the casting isn’t quite as inspired as it was in “Dogs” or “Pulp” (or “True Romance”). Samuel L. Jackson is reliably good – if hardly stretched – as an unscrupulous hustler who is not as smart as he thinks he is, and Bridget Fonda has fun as his conniving beach babe girlfriend. Robert Forster jumps at the chance to play a role with depth after years in made-for-tv hell. Robert De Niro though, despite providing some amusing moments, is disappointingly wasted as Jackson’s dim-witted partner.\n\nAt times this feels like just another thriller, but every now and then Tarantino reminds you what all the fuss was about. Jackson’s brutal (off-screen) dispatching of Chris Tucker in the boot of a car, as the camera slowly cranes up into the sky, is masterfully conceived and a scene, which is subtly built up to, involving a teasing Fonda and a p*****-off De Niro is as unexpected and as shocking as anything Tarantino has done before. By refusing to make a Pulp Fiction 2, Tarantino may have missed out on some easy money, but this film has enough to suggest that he will be more than just a flash in the pan.\n\nLess showy than Pulp, but a more mature story that is just as enjoyable\n\nAuthor: bob the moo from United Kingdom\n\n1 February 2004\n\nJackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie. When one of Ordell’s other employee’s is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up. With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money. However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends.\n\nComing as a follow up to both Dogs and Pulp, this film was going to be the `greatest movie ever made’ or it was going to be met with a critical response that seems to be a bit negative. It was the hype and hyperbole around anything baring the name Tarantino that perhaps was giving every film he did higher and higher standards to meet, it is wasn’t Jackie Brown that was met in this way it would have been the next film, or the next one. However the reviews were mostly good, but it did get some unfair reviews from critics who expected this to continue the upward trend. In a way I believe that this film did show Tarantino’s growth as a director.\n\nWhere Pulp Fiction was dizzying in it’s style and pace, Jackie Brown is much more of a mature, balanced film that is satisfying in a more traditional sense that the design of Pulp. Developed from a Leonard novel, the plot is a solid crime thriller with a good plot that still gives room for Tarantino to do some time shifting as he reveals some key scenes from different perspectives to allow us to see the bigger picture. As a story it fills the rather generous running time pretty well and is enjoyable throughout.\n\nThe film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans – the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue. However where the film stands out is that the characters are actually better than in his previous films where they never really went beyond the story and dialogue. Here not only are they better but they also include well-written female parts! While some of the characters are as good as they need to be within the confines of the basic crime story, it is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit – although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters.\n\nFollowing the praise for Pulp and Tarantino’s ability to rejuvenate careers, he must have had no problem cherry picking for this role.\n\nGrier gives a great performance and should be grateful for the role in an industry that generally ignores middle-aged women (not to mention black women!). The only thing surprising about her is how poorly she has taken this big lead role and used it to take her career on. Her performance embraces her age and uses it well, but it is Forster who gives the standout performance here. Not an actor many will be aware of apart from this film, he got an Oscar nomination for this and I think he deserved it. His performance is very low-key and quite moving – I think I will appreciate his work here more as I get older. Jackson does what is expected of him and has no real character, but his energy and skill are there to see. De Niro plays a little against type and is an interesting, but underused character. Fonda is really, really sexy and has some good lines while the rest of the cast do good work in small roles with people like Keaton, Tucker and Bowen in there.\n\nOverall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is. However to me this is a more satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery. The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most and it sadden me to see him regress about a decade into style without substance with Kill Bill Vol. One.\n\nQuentin strikes again.\n\nAuthor: MovieAddict2016 from UK\n\n2 April 2004\n\nWhere does a director go after making two colossal worldwide hits?\n\n“Reservoir Dogs” (1992) and “Pulp Fiction” (1994) were two of the greatest movies ever made, and they launched director Quentin Tarantino into the realm of Mainstream Hollywood Director. Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented – his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit.\n\nBased upon the Elmore Leonard novel “Rum Punch,” it’s packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. It’s also got a good amount of style, too. It’s not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.\n\nJackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life – or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.\n\nHis partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to double-cross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movie’s twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of “Pulp Fiction,” and De Niro’s underrated performance is a real stand-out. The movie’s quite well made and enjoyable.\n\nDon’t misinterpret what I’m saying. This is no “Reservoir Dogs,” nor does it want to be. It’s not in the same vein as Tarantino’s other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesn’t do. But there’s also a little-known fact that Roger Avary co-wrote some of “Dogs” and “Fiction” with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonard’s novel and does justice. People who say it isn’t as good as his other movies because it’s recycled obviously don’t know what they’re talking about.\n\nTarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buff’s filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with “True Romance,” partially based on Tarantino’s own self-image of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm — in Tarantino’s own case, it was film-making. For Clarence, from “True Romance,” it was drugs and murder.)\n\nTarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and “Jackie Brown” is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality.\n\nThe movie was criticized by Tarantino’s die-hard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?\n\n4.5/5 stars.\n\n“Didn’t I blow your mind this time?”\n\nAuthor: Steffi_P from Ruritania\n\n20 February 2012\n\nThese days, when a director becomes a household name, there’s a pressure on them to live up to their established reputation. If the formula changes the fans don’t take it well. This is at least partly thanks to the auteur theory, which tends to value a director’s work on its consistency rather than the actual quality of each movie. After his revolutionary hit Pulp Fiction, his follow-up Jackie Brown was not exactly a flop, but its reception among critiques, awards ceremonies and the general chitchat of Tarantino aficionados was somewhat lukewarm compared to the raging success of Pulp Fiction. What was wrong?\n\nJackie Brown differs from previous Tarantino projects in that it is adapted from a novel, rather than being an original screenplay straight from the director’s brain (albeit filtered through his many cinematic influences). It contains rather less of the dialogue-for-dialogue’s sake that was so integral to the appeal of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, so no “Royale with Cheese” business here. It still has plenty of cracking dialogue in pursuit of plot though, and scenes such as Lewis trying to explain what went wrong with the switch are glowing examples of Tarantino’s black humour. Overall it’s a finely constructed thing, a nod towards the lovers-in-crime sub-genre of film noir as much as it is a stylistic homage to blaxploitation. And perhaps it’s those romantic undertones and the slightly more low-key violence that put off many of the less broadminded Tarantino admirers.\n\nAlways something of a minimalist behind the camera, Tarantino’s visual style here is at its most simple. Like a Sergio Leone picture, every scene basically boils down to a stand-off between two characters. Tarantino mostly eschews camera movement, just giving us stripped-down shots of people glaring at each other. Of course some may miss the more flamboyant touches that could be seen in his earlier movies, but for the sake of story and character, he is better without them. Special mention must be made of the music in Jackie Brown. Tarantino is of course known for his use of popular music soundtracks, but here it is more apt and co-ordinated than ever. The opening sequence is perfectly timed to “Across 110th Street”, the aching melody and lyrics setting the tone of the whole movie as Pam Grier strides along to the beat. At other times the soundtrack is even witty, as when Robert Forster steps out of the changing room. Tarantino should try making a musical one day. It’d be amazing.\n\nThe simplicity of Tarantino’s approach has given more prominence to the cast. Blaxploitation star Pam Grier here gets her most significant role in years, slotting into Tarantino-world with ease and confidence. She has a lot of silences – her refusal to answer when she’s asked if the"
