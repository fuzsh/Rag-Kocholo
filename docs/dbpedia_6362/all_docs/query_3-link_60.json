        "text": "Starring: Timothy Dalton, Carey Lowell, Robert Davi, Talisa Soto, Everett McGill, Benicio Del Toro\n\nA Central American drug lord snuffs out one of James Bond’s friends and the world’s most famous super secret agent isn’t having one bit of it. Vowing revenge, he breaks up with MI6 and heads down to Key West with vengeance on his mind.\n\nQuite brutal for a Bond flick, License to Kill sets a mean-mugged Timothy Dalton up against an iguana-stroking, pinky-ringed kingpin played by Robert Davi. Critics thought it was mean – but they just can’t stand that Florida heat."
