        "text": "The fast-working screenwriter soon earned film work; his debut script was with Maurice Rapf. The ultimately forgettable \"We Went to College\" hit cinemas in 1936, however, after serving in the War, Maibaum signed a contract with Paramount Pictures, and notably adapted \"The Great Gatsby\" (1949) for the studio.\n\nAnother constant in Maibaum's career was work with Alan Ladd. Shortly after meeting, Maibaum began to act as a script supervisor for Ladd and it was through the screenwriter's connection with this star of the day that Maibaum came to the attention of Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli.\n\nMaibaum ran into Terence Young, who would become famed for crafting the on-screen image of James Bond in \"Dr. No\" and a further two Bond outings, as early as the '50s. The war drama \"The Red Beret\" (1953) was Young's breakthrough production - scripted by Maibaum. The next year, \"Beret\" was followed up with \"Hell Below Zero\" (1954). Both films were produced by Broccoli and his then-business partner Irving Allen.\n\n1956 saw the production of the memorable \"Ransom!\" - which would be famously remade by Ron Howard in the 1990s. After \"Ransom!\" Maibaum's fast-paced career slowed, but with James Bond only a few years away, little did he know that 007 would keep him busy for the rest of his working life.\n\nBetween Bond's, Maibaum took on projects such as \"Jarrett\" (1973), \"S+H+E: Security Hazards Expert\" (1980) and Broccoli and Saltzman's own film adaptation of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968).\n\nAfter \"Licence To Kill\" (1989), 007 went on ice and Maibaum faded from the picture. Aged 80 when Timothy Dalton's second outing was released, Maibaum took this opportunity to retire from a full career in the film industry. He made many lifelong friends throughout his time on the Bond pictures - Peter Hunt to name just one - and all the cast and crew cherish memories of the screenwriter.\n\nThe famed screenwriter passed away on 4th January 1991 in Santa Monica, CA, after an illness.\n\nBondography\n\nLicence to Kill (1989) Screenwriter The Living Daylights (1987) Screenwriter A View to a Kill (1985) Screenwriter Octopussy (1983) Screenwriter For Your Eyes Only (1981) Screenwriter The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) Screenwriter The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) Screenwriter Diamonds Are Forever (1971) Screenwriter On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) Screenwriter Thunderball (1965) Screenwriter Goldfinger (1964) Screenwriter From Russia With Love (1963) Screenwriter Dr. No (1962) Screenwriter\n\nExtended Filmography\n\nRansom (1996) - Buy USA\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) - Buy USA\n\nThe Day They Robbed the Bank of England (1960)\n\nRansom!
