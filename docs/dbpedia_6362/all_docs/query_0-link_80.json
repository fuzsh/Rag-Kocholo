        "text": "Bond & Actor Performance\n\nIn his fourth time in the suave seat of secret agent 007 James Bond, Sean Connery delivers the same fire best seen flaring in Dr. No and From Russia with Love.\n\nIf Dr. No and From Russia with Love presented a Bond to us that was primal and predatory, what we have here is that same kind of man with an uber confident twist added to him. While we saw Bond really struggle working on his own in Jamaica in the first film and miss the looming shadow of SPECTRE casting over him in the second, in Thunderball Bond is not only devil may care in his opposition to Largo and his cronies, he openly calls out the SPECTRE plot to the man at the card table and mocks him for his place in the very organization that nearly killed him two films back.\n\nSuffice it to say, in Thunderball Sean’s Bond is a one man wrecking ball that connects all the dots nobody else can, sniffs out the plot, places himself in tough positions to best gain intelligence, and is ultimately the one that progresses the mission to its final success, near single-handedly. It is such an endless kick to see Bond tear up the Bahamas as he counter-schemes Largo in the most delicious of fashions. He is always on the move, always thinking of how to get the information he needs. He checks one location and finds there are no bombs, so he does the necessary detective work to uncover another location where they could be. If he then goes there and his investigation again runs dry, he keeps at it relentlessly while doing his part to stop a nuclear onslaught.\n\nThis is a man who knows his enemy is both faking his death and masquerading as a woman because he spots them open their own car door while in a dress. Who makes a point to secretly tape the sounds of his hotel room to discover when an intruder arrived and where they moved in the space, hiding a gun under the table to have some concealed firepower on hand if things ever kicked up. A man who uses a different hotel room than is booked under his name to throw off enemies who’ve pursued him. Who stands in the center of two opposing forces and fires in both directions to make them shoot at each other in the confusion. Who stabs an opponent while locked inside a pool with a school of sharks so that the creatures will follow the scent while he powers on past them. Who strategically uses a bottle of alcohol and lighter flames to trigger an opportunity to escape. Who spins a villainess in the direction of a bullet with the reflexes of a wild west gunman, coldly quipping about her demise seconds later. Who uncovers a missing NATO plane’s location because he remembers Largo telling him of the rare grotto fish he had recently collected that just so happened to be swimming in one specific part of the Bahamas. In short, Bond is always on the ball, 12 steps ahead and prepared to counter any move his enemies think they can make to best him.\n\nIn pure Sean Connery fashion, this film is absolutely jam-packed with moments where the man conveys cool, anger or assertiveness with just a slight expression or bit of movement. The calm and collected way he sets off the Shrublands alarm with just his elbow. The look he gives to M when he shows up late to his briefing and gets reprimanded for it like a misbehaving child. The expression of child-like wonder in his eyes when he tells Moneypenny about Domino’s two moles. How he pushes the gun away from his face that Largo is pointing near it when he visits the man’s home, picking on how it’s a lady’s gun in his next breath. How his eyes thirst for Domino as he looks at her drying off poolside, only just after telling Largo that he wasn’t a passionate man.\n\nTo put it simply, Bond is remarkable in this film, a true man of action after being a glorified prisoner in the previous movie. He’s so on top of things and clever throughout, muscling in on Largo and provoking his ego with low blows and moments of one-upmanship, using spy tactics to infiltrate enemy boundaries to locate the missing bombs and matching his wits against those of SPECTRE in every confrontation. In Dr. No SPECTRE was nothing but a worthless acronym when the eponymous villain spat the organization at him, and in From Russia with Love the group were the unseen enemies manipulating Bond where they needed him. In Thunderball, however, Bond now knows how the organization plays their twisted spy game and there aren’t many surprises they can deliver to him. Because of this, the agent feels more capable against the threat than ever before, and Connery oozes this confidence. In effect, the boyish portrayal of Bond in Goldfinger has grown into a man, leaking machismo.\n\nSniffing out the NATO plot early as just the kind of operation SPECTRE would consider pulling off, 007 brings the heat to them in his every step, done playing the ignorant puppet. Bond is able to detect the presence of SPECTRE with shocking ease, simply by paying attention to the self-absorbed marks all the organization’s agents wear. There’s a great arrogance in how Blofeld and his associates work, wearing rings on their very fingers that secretly and discreetly point to their hidden power in the world, which nearly everyone passing them by is unaware of. Bond isn’t, however, and it’s those same rings and that same arrogance that undoes the plans of people like Largo and Fiona who think they have everyone fooled.\n\nBond spots the mark of SPECTRE and senses the organization’s presence, and it’s because of the ring that he is able to sniff out Fiona as one of their ranks when she tries to conceal the insignia during their tire-shredding back road drive. Surrounded by the redhead and her goons following their twist in the sheets, Bond comments truthfully on SPECTRE’s tendency to telegraph their power through the rings, stating, “Vanity has its dangers.” SPECTRE think their power and mystery is so great that they can get away with overtly mocking the public with their octopus insignia open to the eye, but thanks to Bond they linger in the shadows no longer. They have met their match.\n\nOn a deeper level, part of what makes Sean’s performance in this film so powerful and resonant is his chemistry with Claudine Auger, who fills the Bond girl role this time around. I think that if one had to rate the Bond films by how well the leading male and female worked off one another, you’d be remiss to exclude Thunderball from the list. There’s such a genuine feeling of life, playfulness and cohesiveness that is created when Sean and Claudine share a scene, and not in a way that would be seen in the era or beyond outside of the chemistry he had with From Russia with Love’s Daniela Bianchi for a long time. In each scene I never feel like I’m watching two actors working on a set, but actual lovers looking out for one another.\n\nThe chemistry Sean has with Auger is part of why the Bond of Thunderball is one of my favorite takes on the superspy. It’s sweet to see the effect Bond has on Domino, but it’s the sweetest surprise of all to see just how much she affects him too. From the very first moment they meet and the dance they share at the casino following their first genuine talk, it’s clear that Bond’s attraction for this woman goes beyond the physical. After seeing how mistreated Domino is by Largo, something innate seems to trigger inside the spy that drives him to give her all the joy and safety he feels she deserves in a mad dash to make up for all that the villain can’t give her. These moments of care can be as simple as the way Bond holds Domino in a dance and how he gets her a towel as he helps lift her from the pool following a swimming session, or they can be much more monumental, like when he must break the news of her brother’s death as softly as he can, knowing it’ll hurt her.\n\nSean hits all the right notes of dangerous and cool in Thunderball, but it’s these kinds of moments with Auger that really stand out to me the most, because they paint Bond to be as devoutly heroic as you would hope. The protective aura he always tries to keep over Domino at every turn really endears him as a man, first and foremost. When he dismantles Largo’s ego, he’s partly doing it because he’s his enemy, but you can also sense that he’s digging in all the more for how badly the bastard treats Domino, and that really fires him up.\n\nPeople that call James Bond a misogynist should really check out films like Thunderball, where he doesn’t just adore and worship women like goddesses, he puts himself between them and danger itself at every turn with no semblance of reward promised to him. How Sean plays Bond in this film sends out a very powerful statement about who this man is, and one that can be seen in every Connery film, especially Goldfinger. While men like Auric and Oddjob oppress and belittle women, Bond celebrates them and can’t get enough. He finds them endlessly fascinating in mind, body and spirit, and excitably rushes to experience all the flavors of them any time he can, all while protecting the ones he collides with no matter the cost to himself. If that’s not the antithesis of a misogynist, I have no goddamn idea what is.\n\nOne of the endless reasons Thunderball is able to achieve such a great sense of gravitas and blockbuster power is through these many moments as detailed above, played effortlessly by Sean Connery in what may be his Bond’s finest hour. To watch this film is to witness a man take a character he’d played so effortlessly for three previous films and play it as even more iconic, cementing himself as the king of the role when all was said and done. This Bond feels like the natural maturation of the man we see at the beginning of Dr. No, a little wiser, a bit tougher, more aware of the seedy underbelly of crime SPECTRE signifies and the epitome of confidence and devil may care flair. Connery as a performer also feels more on his feet, visibly having greater fun than ever before with an endless twinkle in his eye throughout. Alongside each other, Connery and Bond grow up in Thunderball.\n\nBond Girl & Performance\n\nDomino Derval- There’s something about Domino that really does it for me, no matter how many times I pop in Thunderball. A series of details and moments come together to successfully create an interesting picture of a rather complex woman, but at the start the only glimpse we get of her is via a photograph, much like how we first meet From Russia with Love’s Tatiana Romanova. Beyond her moles-two on her left thigh-we know virtually nothing about this woman until we spot her with a foot caught in a bit of reef. Then, in a piece of characterization I always find interesting, Bond complements her when they come up for air by telling her she, “swims like a man.” It’s an odd yet fascinating remark that makes Domino feel experienced at her hobby of diving and well trained in the practice, while also telling us that Bond may not run into many experienced women of that sort while on the job.\n\nWhile striking on the outside and most recognizable by the mole on the bottom right side of her face, Domino’s beauty masks a complicated interior. The most mystery (and uneasy creepiness) that emits from her is down to the strange relationship she has with Largo that never really gets properly cemented for us as the viewer, quite purposefully. We know that Domino met and connected with Largo while she was with her brother, Francois. This leads me to believe that the villain personally sought Francois Derval for the SPECTRE job early on and got familiar enough with him in a social capacity (and maybe even as a friend) to hook him up with Fiona so that she could funnel Angelo the information he needed to best duplicate the man’s voice, mannerisms and overall disposition for the NATO scheme. In doing so, Largo also decided to snatch up Domino as a bonus, charming her as he went.\n\nIt was only until later that the true man Largo is became known to Domino, and by that point it was too late for her to escape. At the start Bond seems to think that Domino is Largo’s niece, not his mistress (as many in the Bahamas seem to think), but it appears that Largo and Domino only perpetuate that myth to hide the fact that they are lovers many, many years separated, adding to the tinge of creep factor present in every scene where the two interact.\n\nIt’s clear that while she may have liked Largo previously, now Domino is uncomfortable and not as assured in her associations with him. He’s very volatile towards her, which Domino implies in no uncertain terms. Every time Bond presses her about what she and Largo do together, her voice goes mellow and soft out of what seems to be a sense of fear or pain. In the Thunderball novel we learn of all the old millionaires Domino is constantly swarmed by who prey on her beauty and flirt incessantly with her, so it’s only inevitable that a younger, more virile man like Bond would attract her as he does from the casino scene onward. While dancing with Bond, the spy errs by comparing himself to Largo, which Domino denies, telling him he’s different just by, “the way you hold me.” It’s not hard to imagine Largo being quite violent towards Domino, and it wouldn’t have been surprising if one of the film’s shots zoomed in on a part of her body that was imprinted with the octopus insignia of his ring where his fist had made contact with her flesh.\n\nLike Tatiana Romanova of From Russia with Love, Domino is clearly an innocent girl lost in a game of high intrigue that she understands very little of, including Largo’s dreaded dealings and his ordered killing of her brother. It’s also evident throughout the film that Bond has a concern for Domino, and realizes that at some point he’s going to have to face her with the death of her brother, which you can visibly see he is not looking forward to. When Domino questions Bond after he tells her about Francois’ murder, asking if he was only sleeping with her to get to Largo, she understandably feels misused by a man once again, nothing but his army candy, just as she is for the SPECTRE second-in-command. Judging simply by the fact that Domino still agrees to help Bond, if only to get a chance to cause Largo the kind of pain he has her, it’s clear how far she is willing to go to avenge the death of her brother, the only man who ever seemed to care for her. It’s fitting then that Largo meets his end by her hand-or is that spear-a moment that is the visual equivalent of a gloriously plumaged bird breaking free of its cage and flying away.\n\nBeyond being a first runner-up in a Miss World competition in 1958 and grabbing up some film roles at the beginning of the 60s, Claudine Auger was by no means a seasoned pro in the field of acting. And yet, here she delvers a truly human and raw performance. Her body language is perfect, and her personality comes out very genuinely whenever she plays scenes opposite Sean. Their chemistry is strong, best exemplified by the poolside chat they have after just meeting and the dance their share following Bond’s card game with Largo. Auger exudes a sense of elegance and grace, rarely seen out of a form-hugging bikini to boot. This visual nicely compliments the kind of stripped down and vulnerable character Domino so naturally is, a really sympathetic figure being cruelly strung along. Auger’s performance gives credence to the “kept woman” Domino is under Largo’s thumb, as she emotes a sharp vulnerability that pierces the screen.\n\nAuger’s performance is anchored in her ability to subtly convey the contrasting feelings that Domino has for both Bond and Largo throughout, providing a shocking amount of subtext to the character that you sometimes really have to pay attention to appreciate. We are treated to moments where Domino will give a little smile, all before Largo grabs ahold of her arm as a father would a misbehaving child, and you can see the life drain out of her as soon as she knows her keeper is back around to reign her freedom in. In other moments, like when she’s having a pleasant dinner with Bond, you can again see her warmth go frigid as she spots the Disco Volante sail into view, or makes note of Quist tailing her for Largo. It quickly becomes clear that Domino only experiences the allusion of freedom while in the Bahamas, as everything she does is under constant watch.\n\nThese moments where Domino’s inner life is repressed via Largo and his associates are juxtaposed whenever Bond is in her proximity, always ready to render her life’s dullness luminescent. In some of Thunderball’s most beautiful moments, an upset or quiet Domino has her spirit awakened as Bond arrives to dazzle her again and make her feel safe. The blackness expressed when she’s with Largo is blocked out by the immense light that cascades off of her in scenes like the dinner outside the casino and her dance with Bond. The way she holds Bond and how he holds her back conveys the feeling of a chivalric man looking out for a woman he knows deserves the world. Because Auger is able to make Domino feel so overwhelmingly sympathetic, you only wish for her to have more time with Bond, if only to see her eyes sparkle in that same wondrous way again. It becomes easy to hate Largo before long, as you see via Auger’s body language what his presence does to the sweet and endearing Domino. In a further showing of Auger’s range, she utterly captivates when she needs to deliver in moments of high performance. Her greatest moment of the entire film may come after Bond tells Domino of Francois’ murder following their underwater undulations. The tears rolling down Claudine’s face hit hard as her character gets the news and you believe the tragedy spilling from her eyes. Her face is centered in the shot in close-up, drawing us to her and her pain while she gets choked up in her speech. Not many Bond actresses with so little experience could nail the kind of raw emotion and genuine charm Claudine does so effortlessly here in so many of her scenes.\n\nWhile dubber Nikki van der Zyl’s voice for Domino sounds a lot like a mix of Sylvia Trench and Honey Ryder’s from Dr. No, her deliveries “fit” Claudine’s performance nicely. Her voice is the right lovechild of sweet and soft, providing the necessary charm, drama and emotion to each of the scenes in which the character appears. The dubbing is one of those moments in the early Bond films where a physical performance and the voice work mesh so well together that they drive you to assume parity. If Thunderball was the first film I watched of the series, I don’t think I’d be able to tell that the voice was not Auger’s own. Her body language and van der Zyl’s interpretations of those movements enrich Domino’s character and provide her with the kind of complexity and endearing emotion that makes her one of my all-time favorite Bond girls.\n\nSecondary Villains & Performances\n\nFiona Volpe- Good lord, what a woman. I can only imagine how many boys became men watching Luciana Paluzzi in Thunderball. She has and will forever be one of my absolute favorite Bond characters in general, and not just one of my favorites from the bevy of Bond beauties. If ever there was a greatest hits compilation of Thunderball produced, every scene Fiona appears in would need to be included for there to exist any credibility in it. She’s so fierce, dangerous and sexy in every way in this movie, drawing your eye to her every movement and your ears to her every purring word. The way she bikes up to Count Lippe and blows him away, drives Bond around bends with the skill of a race car maverick, shoots clay pigeons with deadly ease and has her fun with Bond sans emotion like the spy made a habit of doing himself are all moments that sell her as a character who is a grand departure from the innocent pretty faces we’ve seen up to this point in the series.\n\nFiona’s red-hot beauty masks a dark and resourceful interior that has little opponents of equal skill. She’s a woman that plays the boys’ games, but better. It’s Fiona that slaps Largo on the wrist for trying to get Bond killed, warning him that such rash behavior will draw the spy’s government to their plan. It’s also Fiona who personally takes up the contract to axe Bond, and it’s her finesse and resourcefulness that nearly makes Bond bite it big-time during the Junkanoo festivities. In many ways, her strategies and actions overshadow Largo’s own attempts at getting Bond, because while the villain is distracted with jealousy and anger towards the spy, she is able to separate emotion from the mission and act with clarity to do what needs to be done.\n\nTo back up the game of chess that the redheaded beauty plays with our hero, Thunderball’s script seems to make a conscious effort to show us that Fiona can play the same game Bond does, and play it well. 007 is no stranger to seducing women to pump them for information (excuse the pun), and right at the beginning of the film we witness Fiona using the same sort of strategy. SPECTRE had long planted her in the path of Domino’s brother, Francois Derval, so that the villainess could get close enough to the man and study him like her prey to ensure one of the organization’s agents could disguise themselves as him for the NATO theft. To butter up the unknowing Derval, Fiona uses the best of her feminine wiles, proving that sex truly is a weapon in the right (or wrong?) hands.\n\nFiona’s sex appeal becomes her ultimate tool for both distraction and stalling, as she keeps Derval ensnared in bed while her team make their way to her, and later on in the film she sleeps with Bond just long enough for Vargas and his fellow hench-fiends to come knocking at his door. It’s these kinds of behaviors and strategies that Bond himself employs all the time across the series, and had done as much in just the previous three movies leading up to Thunderball. His seduction of Miss Taro in Dr. No and his attempts to stall her until the Jamaican police arrived to her home in the hills is an exact match for what Fiona does to him in this movie, and his ability to seduce and butter up Tatiana Romanova in From Russia with Love is not unlike the performance Fiona puts on for Derval.\n\nWith this subtle mirroring, we find that Fiona is a great feminine doppelgänger for Bond, the very rare example of a woman who works from his own playbook. It’s jarring to watch Sean’s Bond being held at gunpoint following his roll in the sheets with Fiona, as he thought he was the one playing the game. From the shock in his posture and his resignation to being beaten at this specialty, we see how unprepared and caught off guard he was by his inability to work the girl as well as he did Pussy Galore in the previous film.\n\nBecause of the negative reception some held for Bond’s sexual manipulation of Galore before the climax of Goldfinger, the writers of Thunderball made Fiona a conscious antithetical character to her, a woman who couldn’t be so easily “turned” to the side of virtue the second Bond unzipped his trousers. In the end, it’s Volpe’s commitment to being the person she is without compromise that makes her so exciting to watch. There’s never a moment where you believe Bond has a chance of reaching her on a moral or sexual level, and so you simply kick back and watch them go at it in the same way you would 007’s dinner with No or train ride with Donald Grant.\n\nAs if Ms. Volpe couldn’t be any more unforgettable, two of my all-time favorite scenes in Bond history are jam-packed back-to-back in this film, and both contain the villainess. First, Bond walks into his hotel room, sees Fiona, and when she asks him to hand her something to put on, he passes her sandals and sits comfortably to watch her stark naked in the tub. When they make love, the screen is electric and Fiona is characterized like an animal as Barry overlays a passionate, romantic theme on the scene. I love the way Luciana bites on Sean’s ear and shoulder, and her line deliveries are caked in sensuality as her hands brush and grasp the gold bars of the bed post as she wails the word “safe” in erotic ecstasy while the scene comes to a close.\n\nIn the next moment, Fiona reveals her true intentions in rolling in the sheets with Bond and stamps her foot to emphasize that she’s not like all the other girls who fall so easily at his feet when they’ve had sex-this is actually the script writers breaking the fourth wall and poking fun at critics who thought Pussy fell too fast for Bond in Goldfinger. Bond’s remark of, “Don’t flatter yourself” that he barks back at her is delicious and shows that even in a losing battle he’s trying to make out that he still has a chance to gain victory.\n\nDirectly after these two moments, a nearly dead to rights Bond exudes Fleming’s creation as he watches fearfully while being swarmed by armed SPECTRE gunmen spilling out of the Junkanoo parade. Sean’s performance bleeds fear as the spy spots Largo’s men walking the perimeter of the club, their eyes glued to him, their hands grasping guns. For a brief moment Bond whips out his charm on a girl to direct himself nearer to the dance floor and out of the open, but is out of luck, finding Fiona in his path to salvation yet again. As the instruments rattle and the music booms the pair share a true dance of death. Just as the band drums reach a percussive rise around him, Bond spots the gun coming from behind the curtain afar. In a last second move, he spins Fiona into the bullet’s path as the instruments disguise the concussive hit of the shot.\n\nThe camera lingers on Bond dancing with Fiona’s corpse as blood trickles down the dress and over his fingers, his arms the only thing holding her upright as a look of disgust forms on his face. Her head limp on his shoulder like a sleeping lover, the spectators mistake their shared moment for a romantic dance, while only Bond knows the truth of the dark act he just had to commit for Queen and country-and himself. He puts on a jovial face for a second to drop the villainess into a chair surrounded by relaxing couples before he rips the facade away again and the distaste returns to mark his face.\n\nThe Junkanoo scene and classic death of Fiona creates one of the finest one-liners in Bond history as 007 leaves her slumped corpse in a chair, commenting that, “She’s just dead” to those around him. The moment is a direct recall of a similar scene in Dr. No, where Bond leaves an equally limp and lifeless Mr. Jones in the car as he goes to meet contacts in Jamaica*. The dialogue and visuals of the scene and how Bond’s last second fight for life is shot makes the sequence-and Fiona along with it-truly unforgettable.\n\n(*Another ‘Dr. No’ reference comes when Bond tells Fiona after she races him around in her car that he’s, “…always been a nervous passenger,” the exact thing he told to Mr. Jones before their scuffle)\n\nAll in all, Fiona Volpe and the powerhouse sex cat behind her character, Luciana Paluzzi, represent one of the best figures in all of Bond. She’s resourceful, tough, strategic, and the original femme fatale villainess. She’s also one of the best characters in the series who isn’t directly ripped from a Fleming novel, showing the early risks Maibaum was taking to add his own spin on the stories being adapted to the screen. In the role, Paluzzi is magnetic every time she’s on screen and knows just how to move her body and inflect her voice to draw the eye to her as she plays her scenes. She’s simply one of those women that drips sex when you look at them, and I can’t imagine being a warm blooded male walking around her during the shooting of Thunderball; it’s women like her that make you lose your mind. It’s a fitting touch that “volpe” is Italian for fox, as you aren’t likely to find foxier babes than Ms. Paluzzi as she appears here.\n\nVargas- I have to give a quick honorable mention to Vargas. I don’t know what the intention of his character is, but I always find him so interesting to watch each time I put in Thunderball.\n\nI guess it’s simply intriguing to see a man without vices in a James Bond film full of men and women indulging in all sorts of things. He’s so stiff and in control all the time, and it’s clear that he takes his work as being one of Largo’s soldiers very seriously. I find it interesting how Largo seems to tease him about the fact that he doesn’t indulge himself in women, gambling, drinking or smoking, as if Vargas’ lifestyle is insulting to him. Perhaps it is, as he is the kind of mind who makes a point of showing off to those he betters…until Bond comes along and knocks him down a few dozen pegs.\n\nI often wonder what Bond thinks of Vargas as a man. Does he view him as a bloke making waste of his life by not experiencing all the grand pleasures of the flesh and drink as he does, or is there a part of the agent that somewhat respects his steeled commitment to duty, even in the service of SPECTRE? We’ll never rightly know, but Vargas is one of those essential elements of the bizarre that makes the Bond books and films so fascinating to experience, truly their own beasts.\n\nBond Villain & Performance\n\nEmilio Largo- For some reason, Largo always seems to get a bad rap in the Bond fandom, but I love him and find him to be one of the vilest, creepiest enemies Bond has ever faced. Obviously he’s the least iconic of the 60s bunch, but when your fellow villains are the likes of Dr. No, Donald Grant, Goldfinger and Blofeld, it’s some stiff competition to face.\n\nFrom the very first moment we see Largo, it’s clear that he’s not a man who likes being messed with. He has the audacity to rest his car in a no-parking spot (the monster!), and when he’s reprimanded for it by a French policeman he throws back a gaze of death to the man to shut him up. In the next scene, as Blofeld smokes the traitor in their ranks through his chair during the briefing, all SPECTRE agents but one freak out at what they just witnessed. The exception is of course the eye-patched man, who remains cool and collected, jotting notes down on his paper with a pronounced indifference to it all. It becomes clear quite swiftly why Largo is No. 2 in the organization, the next in line to take over SPECTRE if something were to become of Blofeld. This man stares death in the face and chortles, refusing to bat his one eye.\n\nThroughout the course of the film, there are a lot of great moments that really sell Largo as a villain to me. For one, his commitment to SPECTRE is absolute and he takes his work very seriously, such that he does much of it himself. It is Largo who dives for the NATO bombs and takes out Angelo as punishment for his greed. When his agents fail him, he has them thrown into the pool as chum for his sharks, kissing his ring after he gives his orders, pledging his love to SPECTRE and the insignia that represents it. Even when he and his team are tasked with transporting the nukes, Largo takes lead on the operation, knowing there may well be danger ahead. He’s like a general who rides on horseback on the front lines with his soldiers, dedicated to their work and to SPECTRE, always eager to impress and show his loyalty. It makes sense why he doesn’t suffer fools or mistakes; when he gives 110% nobody around him should be giving anything less.\n\nThere’s also a great sense of imbalance to Largo, like any moment he could be set off into violent lashings. He’s got such a soft ego, which Bond more than spots and takes advantage of. As the film goes on Largo tells his associates-including Fiona-that he wants Bond dead simply because an enemy of SPECTRE is one that needs to die, but it’s clear to us that he’s only using that as a veiled excuse to mask his growing jealousy and resentment of Bond for foiling his plans and dismantling or belittling his private life. His pride is hurting.\n\nThe first time Largo and Bond meet at the card tables, the agent openly mocks his SPECTRE connections and then pummels him in the game with complete arrogance. Following that he buys the man’s mistress a drink, holds her romantically in a dance and begins motions to unravel his entire operation in the Bahamas. When Largo invites Bond to Palmyra for a bit of sport, Bond acts like an amateur at shooting clay pigeons while the villain shows off, thinking he’s got the agent bested. When it’s time for Bond to shoot a clay pigeon he comments on how hard it looks-not even looking at where the object will be flying out-before giving a quick turn and destroying one with deadly precision. Bond looks down at the gun, feigning puzzlement at how he was able to do that, and confesses to Largo that it must indeed be very simple. The pricks to Largo’s ego Bond delivers to him are hilarious to watch, and as Bond hands the villain the gun after nailing his shot you can see him thinking internally, “Everything’s easy for you, isn’t it?”\n\nLargo is also a great schemer, and knows how to command force. It’s clear why he has a love for sharks; they are both predators and strike when they smell blood and weakness in their prey. Largo is enraged at Bond’s romancing of Domino, but he uses their growing attraction to his advantage, offering the agent the opportunity to take the girl out for a night at the Junkanoo parade and away from his hotel so that Paula can be intercepted and tortured for what she-and Bond-knows of his plans. Bond’s attraction to Domino is strong and he takes the bait, just as Largo designed, and it costs him.\n\nAdolfo Celi brings great life to Largo, and his performance more than exposes the man’s soft ego to the audience as we watch him crumble in the face of Bond’s superior strength in…well, everything. He feels on edge at all times, and that’s rooted in Celi’s posture that is always in command and forceful. The actor was fantastically credible at showing audiences the cracks that were constantly forming in the villain’s ego whenever Bond popped around, and through this part of his performance Celi provides Largo with a very subtle, yet rich, instability. The effect renders him to feel akin to a fully loaded pistol whose trigger is constantly but incrementally being squeezed; you never know when it’ll go off, but it shall.\n\nWhen it comes to the strange subtext behind whatever may or may not be going on with Largo and Domino, Celi’s posture and body language whenever he’s playing around Auger’s beauty tell us so much of the power structure set against the poor gal. You can feel Domino’s liberty shrivel in on itself and die the moment Largo appears in her field of vision, telling her that playtime is over. Instead of pushing some exposition onto us to explain the hold that Largo has over the woman and the fear that his presence creates in her, all we need is the visual of the villain grasping Domino tightly by her bicep or yanking her along by the hair collecting around the nape of her neck. These movements shout better than any words ever could Largo’s strict command: “I own you.” Celi makes you believe this man is not to be messed with, and Largo’s calm in the face of death itself in unnerving, as we’re only used to seeing this trait with Bond.\n\nRobert Rietty did the dubbing for Celi, and I think the voice and performance are a great match, as with Gert Fröbe and Michael Collins in Goldfinger. Rietty gives Largo a slimy sensibility, deepening his tone at just the right moments to convey an unsettled and vindictive disposition. It’s the work in tandem by Celi and Rietty that sells scenes like Largo’s hot and cold torture of Domino as the former juggles the ice playfully between his fingers and the latter’s voice cakes the visual performance in some real sadism.\n\nIn conclusion, I think Largo more than deserves his place as an early 60s Bond villain, and belongs alongside those like Dr. No, Donald Grant and Goldfinger as some of the series’ best.\n\nSupporting Cast & Performances\n\nM- If his part in Goldfinger was meant to give him some moments to be comical and witty, in Thunderball Bernard Lee’s M shines as a commander of a spy agency and advocate of his underlings. When Bond addresses the hunch he has about the Dervals, M is willing to listen to his suggestions on how best to approach the mission, just as he did during Bond’s briefing on the Lektor retrieval operation in From Russia with Love. Moments like these underscore that to M, 007 is more than just an employee and is instead a valued collaborator, trusted confidante and crucial team member who can viably shoulder duty and responsibility when it comes to protecting the realm alongside him. In an even greater showing of his loyalty to his 00 section, when M’s colleagues have the audacity to question his judgment and that of his agents, he is quick to snap back and defend their work and acumen for spy craft.\n\nLater on in the film when it appears that Largo and SPECTRE are going to win and the Brits will be forced to fork up the demanded payment to avoid nuclear destruction, you can see M in distress, angry at how much of a fool they’ve been played as. He has that Churchill-like bulldog determination that makes him despise bowing down to anyone. Other revealing moments for the character dot the film as the MI6 chief feels the pressure of performance while all the eyes of his higher-ups cast themselves upon him. M is usually such a put together man and doesn’t let his emotions show through, but when the Home Secretary has the gall to question Bond’s efforts the professional artifice cracks and he reprimands the man for his presumptions. It’s a moment of bravery and resolve for M, who risks his job and professional relationship with his bosses to stand up for what he believes in almost in the same maverick way Bond performs in the field to do what needs to be done.\n\nThinking about how M commands himself around the Home Secretary and his lackeys, I think Bond would’ve been immensely proud of how his boss held down the fort and dug his heel in the dirt, refusing to move no matter how hard they pushed him. I can only imagine that Bond and M shared a nice dinner with accompanying drinks once the spy landed back in London for all the guff they both had to endure to bring Operation: Thunderball to a successful conclusion.\n\nAs M, Lee delivers what was his most ranged performance at the time, playing from a script that purposefully shifted the feeling of the MI6 offices from one of fun and frivolity to uneasiness and anxiety. There’s no room this time around for an office briefing of quiet banter between M and Bond, or a little moment for the agent and Moneypenny to flirt it up. The SPECTRE threat has made everyone put on masks of strength in order to do their jobs effectively, and even when being worn by M, the mask cracks. It’s unsettling to see M so rattled and defeated, because like Bond he always seems to have the answers. The ability Lee has to play this downtrodden and resigned M with the same spirit and character as he does the sour puss boss or reprimanding father figure to Bond is exciting, but also distressing. If M can’t save the day, who can? Lee’s ability to appear so sympathetic here draws us into his plight, and we stand resolute to support him till the end, come hell or high water.\n\nMoneypenny- In a rather unprecedented moment, Thunderball presents an instance where Moneypenny slips up and insults M, calling him “old man,” triggering an awkward aftermath where Bond pretends he’s looking for his hat to get through it all scuff-free. Right off the bat, by the way that Bond’s support staff interact with one another and how the overall office environment of MI6 is depicted in mood, we see that things aren’t as easy-going as they usually appear to be. In this movie the home team of 007 is the most shaken up in all of the vintage Bond films, with M, Moneypenny and Q all called out from their usual positions to react to the heightened SPECTE threat. M must contend with his superiors, who are always watching his back for slip-ups, and Q is forced to head out into the field (ugh), far away from the safety and comfort of his workshop. The patience of the team and the limitations of their constitutions are tested like never before.\n\nThis feeling of hair-trigger temperament and a high-risk environment seems to have an effect on even Maxwell’s Moneypenny, who is rendered as far more sassy and lippy than ever before in Thunderball. When Bond phones her from Shrublands to have her investigate the Red Tong symbol he saw on Lippe’s arm, she gives the man attitude and tells him to file it away until he gets back. Though she finishes her call with Bond playfully, it’s clear that the gal is being quite the naughty one.\n\nIn an even bigger tonal departure for the series at this point in time, there’s no bit of flirtation between Bond and Moneypenny that unfolds around her desk, and Bond doesn’t give the expected toss of his hat onto the rack. When Bond enters the office he is immediately sent to the briefing room, leaving little time for frivolity between the pair. This shake-up to the formula of Bond and Moneypenny’s interactions subtly underscores just how serious the coming threat is and the consequences it poses. Because Dr. No, From Russia with Love and Goldfinger all had moments where Bond lingered in Moneypenny’s wake to peck her on the cheek and whisper sweet somethings into her ear, the fact that Thunderball openly axes such a tradition should tell us as the audience that something serious has called Bond to action. The time for games is over.\n\nThroughout all the rest of the film, Moneypenny is seen helping M in the briefing room as the 11th hour of the SPECTRE plot approaches. I quite like the use of her character here, as it shows us that she’s far more than just a desk-bound lackey. She is a woman who follows behind her boss with great panache whenever he needs her on hand and she’s able to shoulder the strains and tensions posed by a devastating enemy operation quite admirably.\n\nIn her performance, Maxwell shows a bit of range as Miss Moneypenny by slipping from her usually wicked and sassy self as she playfully mouths back to Bond to a far more driven and focused secretary that gives her character a more resonant earnestness throughout. Hidden away in the echoing briefing room to aid M as he and his team mount opposition to SPECTRE, she is dutiful, quick to action and supportive, even while you can see the very clear worry she has on her face. Because a character like Moneypenny who is always so chipper suddenly adopts a more quiet and no nonsense personality, we once again see that what the team are facing is big, and it’ll take a lot of luck, strategy and timing for them to get the citizens of the world out of danger’s shadow.\n\nMaxwell’s range doesn’t meet the impressive mix of sadness and joy she expresses for Bond at his wedding in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, but the notes she plays here does make her reserved Thunderball performance anchor the stakes of the plot in some reality. Because Moneypenny is so unlike herself here, we connect even more to the dramatic consequences of the SPECTRE scheme that has caused this change in her. The result is a refreshing performance that sticks out by design from the rest of her decades long turn as the character.\n\nQ- In his third turn as MI6’s gadget master extraordinaire, Desmond Llewelyn plays a very short-fused Q in a film full of anxious characters. I mentioned above that both M and Moneypenny were acted by Lee and Maxwell in a way that really ramped up the feeling of defeat and danger posed by the SPECTRE scheme in the film, and in a more minor case, the same feeling exists with Desmond’s turn as Q.\n\nLike the MI6 briefing and flirtation scene with Bond and Moneypenny that Thunderball flipped the script on, Q’s gadget briefing adds a similar shake up to the formula. In From Russia with Love and Goldfinger we had a Q that at the very least looked like he was enjoying himself while sharing his creations with Bond, but in Thunderball neither party seem at all pleased to be with each other. Q is very clearly infuriated that he has been pulled into the field-just as he is in the next film, You Only Live Twice-and seems to take his frustrations out on Bond for this outcome. This was the film that started the grand tradition of having Q go out and meet Bond in the field to supply the agent with gadgets, and though he clearly warmed to the idea of travel over time, in Thunderball he is irate. Calling fieldwork a “highly irregular” affair, he is visibly upset not to be in his workshop tinkering away, no matter how much Bond needs him.\n\nVery little playfulness exists between Bond and Q during the proceedings, and on the agent’s side of things he is quite visibly checked out. In a bit of tonal inconsistency, instead of feeling the tension of SPECTRE’s plan coming to fruition with each passing second, Bond throws barbs Q’s way as the man is trying to explain the function of the tools our spy will need to save the day, even flicking the light on a machine on and off with all the focus of an ADD sufferer with a cabinet empty of Ritalin. Worse yet, Bond even disrespects the amazing tech Q is showing him, asking, “Is that clever?” while holding a special camera. Q follows up 007’s inquiry with a sharp retort that shows us now more than ever that the gadget man truly doesn’t joke about his work.\n\nIn Desmond’s performance, it’s hard to tell where Q’s frustrations come from, or how much he is impacted by the consequences posed by SPECTRE’s nuclear plan, as he’s not back at home base facing the brunt of live updates on the operation like M and Moneypenny are. There is, however, a change visible in his mood and how he delivers his briefing to Bond that points to a sense of unrest. Maybe he simply found out about how Bond ran his glorious DB5 into a Swiss factory wall during his last mission and he still hasn’t forgiven him for it.\n\nFelix Leiter-\n\nOne of the biggest missteps from the 60s era of Bond films was the inability of EON to nail down solid casting for Bond’s American ally.\n\nRik Van Nutter takes on Felix duties this time around in Thunderball, carrying on the baton from past actors like Jack Lord and Cec Linder. Once again, everything about Nutter’s portrayal, his height, weight, overall stature and mannerisms are as big a departure from Linder’s Leiter in Goldfinger as that man’s were from Lord’s Leiter in Dr. No.\n\nIn usual Felix fashion, Nutter’s take on the character is largely the same as the others, which is to say that he doesn’t really do anything of importance beyond giving Bond some logistical and moral support. For much of his screen time he quite literally hangs in the back, spying on Bond as the man makes his connections with Largo and Domino to instigate more opportunities to divulge where the two nuclear missiles may be located. When Felix does enter the action, he is of no great assistance. He drives Bond around to important locations, but rarely amounts to anything more than a glorified sailor and helicopter pilot with not much in the way of personality. In Fleming’s novel Leiter poses as an associate of Bond’s in his dealings with Largo in the Bahamas, and I kind of wish that we got to see that in this film, because at the very least it would give Felix a reason to be there. Paula could have done everything he did in this film, and she was far more worthy of added screen time and plot purpose in my opinion, as I really enjoy Martine Beswick for as little as she appears here.\n\nNutter’s performance is fine enough, but the dubbing is often very wooden and badly delivered, lifeless even. I feel like Nutter’s lines were delivered better on set, but in post-production ADR he re-read his dialogue poorly, giving it this wooden presentation in the overlaid audio. It’s also likely that the only reason he got the role in the first place was because of his marriage to Anita Ekberg, who’d recently appeared in the EON-produced film Call Me Bwana, but that’s neither here nor there.\n\nThe rotating casting door that has always been the fate of the character of Felix Leiter in the James Bond films make it seem as if the role is cursed, and this issue is one of the biggest problems the franchise has had. It’s always difficult to criticize Felix and the actor playing him in any film because he’s the most heavily recast Bond character. Secondarily, it is nearly impossible to attach ourselves to him when we know the actor only changes again in the next film. Because of this, Felix barely feels like a character at times because there’s such a lack of consistency in him throughout the series, and that’s a real shame. This issue is especially severe in the Connery films. We go from the tall, slim, well-built and dashing Jack Lord to the graying and unfit looking Cec Linder only two years later, followed by the equally graying Rik Van Nutter here. At least in Thunderball Van Nutter just looked like an older, grayer Lord, so his casting wasn’t as drastic a change in age and body type as the transition from Lord to Linder was, which is mind-boggling to watch now.\n\nMaybe the reason why David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright are my favorite Leiters is because they each got to have more than one bite at the apple playing the character, and in their second films, Licence To Kill and Quantum of Solace respectively, both men got meatier parts in the action that made Felix feel like a more important part of the story. This is a privilege most Leiters don’t have the honor of, after all.\n\nPoor, poor Felix. He’ll sit out the next couple of films and only get appearances in Diamonds Are Forever and Live and Let Die before disappearing entirely until Timothy Dalton takes the Bond reigns, after which he will once again fade from memory for a decade and a half. Tough going…\n\nPat Fearing- While her role in the film is quite simple and largely only facilitated by the convenience of having Bond recouping at the same clinic that is being used by SPECTRE’s Angelo and Lippe, I really enjoy Molly Peters as Pat Fearing here.\n\nA real stunner, she’s another beauty in a long list of them that appear in this film, one of the all-time best ensembles of Bond women in the entire series, especially in such a great number. In performance alone Peters does the job, with high sex appeal and a voice that oozes attraction. She and Sean are quite playful in how they approach their scenes, and this reinforces the attraction that exists between the characters they are playing. Peters plays the role of Fearing well, and expertly sells scenes where she barks at Bond for misbehaving. She really gives it to Bond in this movie, and challenges him on everything, not holding back a step. In addition, I’m sure every boy of the 60s (and those re-watching the film today) fantasized at least once about massaging Peters’ back with a mink glove in an effort to relieve her tensions. I’ve proudly added my name to that (presumably) long list many times over.\n\nFearing gets an interesting and symbolic send-off in this film, as like nearly every other Bond girl, we never see head or tail from her again. She is visibly melancholic about Bond’s departure despite their rough start, and she tells him she’s available to him, “Anytime, anyplace,” to which Bond charmingly replies, “Another time, another place” as he speeds off. In this way, Patricia Fearing is a composite and representation of every Bond babe before and after her: Bond is a busy and committed man whose work demands him to always be on the move while eyeing the next mission and worldwide threat, having time only for the speediest of dalliances and most fleeting of flings.\n\nPaula Kaplan- In many ways, the lovely Martine Beswick’s Paula Kaplan is one of the biggest missed opportunities in a film that largely nails everything. Many commentators I’ve heard or read analyze Thunderball in the past are of the opinion that Beswick is here only to draw the eye to yet another beautiful woman in an already stuffed picture of seductresses. This contention may hold true, but it’s hard not to wonder what effect the girl would’ve had given more time to shine.\n\nBeswick’s history with vintage Bond is well documented, and she flirted with possible stardom many a time. She tested for Terence Young to be Honey Ryder in Dr. No, but was told by the director that she needed some more acting lessons. These works of advice were ones she earnestly took to heart. By the time From Russia with Love was being cast and shot around 1963 she returned to audition and Terence put her in the picture as one of the battling would-be brides at the gypsy camp. She must have made an impression on Young and warranted being cast in a bigger role in his mind, as he fought for her against the producers’ wishes for a larger appearance in his 1965 feature Thunderball.\n\nWith all this in consideration, Beswick does catch the eye and her screen presence and charming demeanor is quite visible. This fact makes it all the more shameful that this is all we see of her in what could barely be called a substantial part. From the moment we meet her on the boat as Bond attempts a romance of Domino, it’s clear that the chemistry between Martine and Sean burned hot.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the film occurs when Bond and Paula are trying to make it seem like their boat is out of order to facilitate Domino taking Bond ashore. In this scene Beswick gives Paula a rather charming personality because she really ribs Bond on his sad attempts at seduction and plays her lines with great emphasis to show the audience that the character is purposely overacting to display how stupid she thinks the whole ruse is. I adore just how little of a care Paula gives when, after Bond asks her if she doesn’t mind finding her own way back to shore, she puts on an overblown performance, throws her hands comically up in the air for added expression and bellows, “Not at all!”\n\nIf only the rest of the film gave Paula this kind of fun material to play with to build up her character. Beyond being what is supposed to be Bond’s assistant in the Bahamas, all she really does is make sure the photos he shoots of the Disco Volante’s underside are developed and delivered to his hotel room. There’s a sense that she fancies Bond, as she straightens her dress and fixes her hair in the mirror when she thinks he’s knocking at her door later in the film (I promise this isn’t a euphemism for anything), but other than this we don’t really get a solid impression of her past experiences, her skill sets as an agent or what kind of dynamic or working relationship her and Bond have had in the past, if any.\n\nBecause of this, when we find out she’s bitten on a cyanide capsule to escape Largo’s torture it’s hard to feel anything because we know so little of her. Her sacrifice, as noble as it is, then inevitably rings hollow. All we’re left with is one fun scene with Paula and a beautiful figure to stare at outside of that performance. Those assets alone are more than some Bond girls in the franchise have gotten to offer, however, so I guess there’s that.\n\nGun Barrel Sequence-\n\nThunderball’s gun barrel sequence is notable for many reasons. The switch to a widescreen presentation necessitated a new lead-in to be shot for the Bond films, and this time around stuntman Bob Simmons (who’d featured in the gun barrel sequence for the first three films) sits out on walking duties so that Sean Connery can take his shot for the first time in the series. In addition to this unique debut, this was also the first full color gun barrel sequence in the franchise beyond just the blood drip. In many ways, the Thunderball intro paved the way for all other gun barrels beyond, as after this point the lead actors of each era were always used for the sequence and the image of each Bond was almost always rendered in full color.\n\nI really enjoy this gun barrel. The Bond theme is proud and loud, a great sound that sets up the very ambitious and epic nature of Thunderball’s story. I also get a kick out of seeing Sean finally do the iconic walk, and I love the turn and pose he strikes to shoot, as it looks like a realistic reaction for an armed person to have if they are in the line of fire. Sean’s Bond turns and immediately crunches down low to avoid a shot to his upper body while making his shot, throwing off his enemy. The 3D looking blood drip adds a nice finishing effect.\n\nPre-Title Sequence-\n\nThe pre-title sequence for Thunderball remains one of my all-time favorites. Fresh off of the gun barrel sequence we get a great opening shot on a casket with the initials “J.B,” not knowing what to think. Are we viewing Bond’s own funeral? All becomes clear once we see Bond waiting in the wings, spying on the proceedings. We get many shots of a woman in funeral dress who feels most curious, and the mystery continues to build. We learn in a bit of dialogue that the funeral is for a Jacques Bouvar, a man who killed two of Bond’s colleagues. 007’s anger at not being able to have punched the man’s ticket himself tells us that he takes actions against his fellow 00s personally, and will avenge them as a professional courtesy on general principle.\n\nThe sequence takes us outside the church, where we see the woman (?) open her own car door, ignoring the guards around her. While this wouldn’t be a weird image to take in for audiences of our current time, it clearly perplexes the traditionalist in Bond, who smells a scheme afoot. We follow the woman to her French chateau and find Bond waiting in the common area with his back turned, sitting in a chair like a silent predator. He feigns sincerity and compassion for the woman before launching his fist into her face, revealing that it was a man all along (!).\n\nWhat kicks off next is one of my favorite fights in the franchise because of how Peter Hunt’s editing adds a sense of messiness to the action, and how Bond and Bouvar use their environment, like cabinets, chairs and vases, to offset each other and go for the kill. The sequence is made all the better when you realize that Sean is onscreen fighting his own stunt double from the previous films, Mr. Bob Simmons. The bout is fast, rough and imaginative, finishing with Bond coldly snapping Bouvar’s neck with a fire poker and dousing his body with flowers of mourning. There’s a bit of black comedy to this whole pre-titles sequence, because Bouvar is murdered barely ten minutes after he leaves his own funeral. If his associates were quick to the draw, they could get his body back to the church to fast track his services without letting the fake funeral go to waste. Death is dreary, but a bargain is a bargain.\n\nThe opening wraps up as Bond escapes on a real working jet pack while Bouvar’s support take shots at him from below, after which he lands by his trusty Aston Martin DB5 and uses its gadgets to give his pursuers a bit of a wash up as the camera is caked in streams of water, leading into the opening titles design.\n\nLocations-\n\nThunderball was a nice return to form where locations were concerned. Dr. No took us to the warm and vibrant Jamaica, From Russia with Love followed up with a more dour and dangerous Turkey and Goldfinger continued by showing us locations that lacked an exotic or breathtaking sensibility (sans the beauty of Switzerland), making me miss more lively and engrossing locales.\n\nWith Terence Young back in the director’s chair, the travelogue feeling of the Bond films came with him as he took us on a ride to experience the atmosphere of the Bahamas through some of the greatest location shooting of the series. The wide beaches and deep seas are the perfect stage to set such an ambitious plot as this one, with Bond acting above ground and below it to achieve his mission. The result makes Thunderball the ultimate tourist Bond film, with a great vacation-like flavor. The overwhelming use of underwater photography also gives the film the title of the ultimate water Bond film, an element that no other movie in the series has to its name. The fact that the underwater scenes are so stunningly filmed is an added plus, with the filmmakers making it clear that the film’s style wouldn’t lessen even when the characters entered the blue depths of the Bahamas.\n\nWe get some nice cultural flair in this movie as we see the Bahamas and its natives out and about, best eclipsed by the Junkanoo parade. Though the story is set in late May and the parade is usually only held at the end of each year for Boxing Day or New Year’s, seeing the festivities play out and to have it used in a major action sequence is thrilling. The vibrant colors of the floats and costumes of the dancers-extras who were actually competing in a contest for the best costumes and floats as devised by the production team-give great life to the scenery as Bond ducks and weaves out of SPECTRE’s grasp. The Kiss Kiss Club, which the filmmakers themselves made, continues to show the vibrant life of the Bahamas, with fire dancers, passionate drummers and gyrating bodies becoming captivating parts of the scenery. There’s a real energy to everything we see in the Bahamas, a feeling that makes nice partners with Hunt’s quick and frantic editing style.\n\nIn a clever use of time, the daylight scenes of Bond courting Domino, grinning through his teeth at Largo at Palmyra and his brisk talks with Felix are contrasted starkly with the nighttime sections of the film where our hero fights for survival. Under the dark of the night Bond dives under the Disco Volante to do some detective work and barely escapes a barrage of grenades after he is exposed. Later, his nighttime escapes bring him into contact with the poisonous Fiona Volpe and Largo uses the opportunity of a nighttime celebration to get Bond to take Domino as his date so that his team can rush to the hotel and snap up Paula. The most tense and near-death experience Bond has in the entire film is also fittingly staged against the backdrop of a dark Bahamas night, as Bond is shot and desperately attempts to evade a bloodthirsty Volpe and company. The film makes a clear distinction between the predator and prey relationship Bond and SPECTRE have by using the constantly turning hands of the clock.\n\nBy day 007 plays tourist and is able to meet and greet with beauties and bastards alike, but come night he must always be on guard as the hunter becomes hunted. Locations that we see in daylight, such as Palmyra, instantly become all the more fearsome as darkness casts itself over the Bahamas, as if they have morphed into something else entirely. Like From Russia with Love before it, Thunderball makes a smart use of location and nighttime photography to show us why Bond should fear sun down. The paranoia comes not from what Bond can see, but what he can’t, with death and danger always mating in the next room.\n\nOverall, Thunderball is able to use its locations to hit all the right boxes, giving us every kind of flavor we could desire from a blockbuster experience. The film’s start in France provides a slice of European intrigue as a crisp and quiet morning turns into just another day on the job for Bond. The continued transition to a fairly mundane clinic is perfectly placed in the film so that the emergence of the exotic Bahamas in the next scenes strike out warmly against it. In a flash, Bond goes from dreary and familiar surroundings to those full of wonder and natural beauty. From this point on visions of sandy beaches propagated with tourists, seabeds littered with Claudine Augers and a coast-dotting estate owned by an eye-patched and parasitic villain are offered up for our eyes to feast on.\n\nBy night we take in the heroic image of our hero floating up to a casino via boat as he has his first standoff with Largo and dances with Domino in his protective hold. The shift from disparate locations keeps things fresh and exciting, and once we stagnate in the Bahamas the inspired use of a day and night cycle to contrast the safety of sun up and the danger of sun down ensure that the locations never become stale. It’s rare to see Bond as entrenched in a location as he is while in the Bahamas, experiencing all its cultural recreations and hazards from morning to night, but that’s part of what makes Thunderball’s use of location so special.\n\nGadgets-\n\nAs with all the Terence Young Bond films, in Thunderball Bond’s gadgets are practical, realistic and “spy smart,” largely with a basis in the actual technological capabilities of the day. The jet pack of the pre-title sequence was a real working model, noisy though it was, grounding the action we witness in the realm of the possible. The pack was designed by Wendell Moore of Bell Aerosystems after he was contracted by the United States army to devise a flight machine for their soldiers to use in combat. Although the device worked as intended, carrying the operator of it 850 feet in distance, it was incredibly loud and only kept in the air for around twenty seconds at a time.\n\nWhile the jet pack obviously wouldn’t have been of much utility to servicemen fighting in the wars of the period, its use in Thunderball does actually fit within its own operational limitations. Bond uses it to fly under the twenty-second flight time limit, and he is able to clear a distance far below the maximum 850 feet to escape Bouvar’s residence. The optimal use of the pack in a real life conflict would essentially fit with what is depicted during the pre-title sequence: as a quick escape from a hot spot where you are already exposed to your enemy. By writing Moore’s creation into the film as such, the action we see stays within the possibilities of the day and the use of the pack doesn’t exceed the known constraints posed by the device’s own performance. As he touches down in the Bahamas later in the film, Bond gets his biggest arsenal in the film from a very cantankerous Q. These gadgets include a reserve-breathing device, handy for in a tough spot, an underwater infrared camera (best for sneaking pictures of boat hulls) and Geiger counters disguised as a watch and camera. For the underwater finale, Bond is armed with a powered aqualung with a working motor, headlights and mounted spear guns tipped with shotgun shells that take center stage in a rousing moment as he fires the spears and collapses a door on two of Largo’s men to rescue one of the navy divers during the finale.\n\nEach bit of equipment featured in Thunderball is used in a cunning fashion to help Bond complete his mission throughout the film, and most of the gadgetry, even down to the sea sleds that Largo and his men use to transport the nuclear weapons, are actual working pieces of tech created by the brilliant production team. The drama of the film is heightened all the more when you realize that so much of the fantastical imagery in front of you can and does exist in reality, operating as advertised.\n\nAction-\n\nOut of all of Connery’s films, I think it’s Thunderball that manages to be an action film and spy film in tandem without one element discrediting or bogging down the other. It’s clear that the Bond team took all that they’d learned from the previous films to stage the action we see in this movie, which is nothing short of amazing, and every set piece we witness feels necessary for the plot and what is required of the story. Thunderball succeeds, and is at its most pulse-pounding, when the filmmakers are juggling scenes with a lot of actors or extras in them while making it all feel natural and not staged in the slightest.\n\nThere’s great excitement when the Governor of the Bahamas triggers a power outage around Palmyra for Bond to slip into the property unseen, snaking along the outside walls to get a view on the place. Showing his tactician side, Bond stealthily goes around taking out Largo’s men while making them shoot at each other in an artfully cunning moment of sabotage that disorients them and stirs Largo. The sequence feels like the big brother of the stealth sequence outside Goldfinger’s Swiss factory in the previous film, but one where Bond is in complete control this time. Although Paula Kaplan was an underwritten part of the screenplay, Bond’s strike against Palmyra and its forces to attempt a rescue of her ground the action in who his character is. As with Domino, Bond is intensely protective of women in this film and is willing to go the extra mile to risk his skin for them.\n\nFollowing the Palmyra raid, the Junkanoo chase is frantic and chaotic as a fearful Bond escapes the fire he caused to release himself from SPECTRE’s hold. The flashes of color dotting the floats and costumes of the dancers and the blurs of movement created in the camera’s picture box are suitably kinetic in their energy, perfect for an editor like Hunt who uses this kind of visual stimuli to his creative advantage. I’ll touch more on this aspect of the film in the editing section of the review. The most famous and daring bits of Thunderball’s action make their impact during the climax as Bond and a legion of frogmen race to get the nuclear weapons out of SPECTRE’s possession and effectively neutralized. I get such a giddy, child-like thrill watching the frogmen jump from the plane soaring over the Bahamas and pull their shoots, lighting up the sky with orange as they land in the drink. Some call the underwater action in this film boring, but I find it to be immaculately rendered and riveting no matter how much I see it.\n\nThe sequence begins like a battle from America’s Civil War, with the heroes and villains standing all in a line, firing their spear guns forward to peel back each other’s ranks. When the spears run out and the distance between the forces narrow, an all-out brawl ensues as the divers propel themselves into each other with knives drawn. In the minutes that follow evocative and cinematic images are unfurled to paint a picture of the heroes’ fight to halt nuclear disaster. Bond and the frogmen twist and turn in heated wrestling with Largo’s men as sharks worm their way in between them. Knives are brandished, spear guns are fired, and trails of deep red blood cloud the water as it seeps from fresh wounds, contaminating the murk.\n\nThe real strength of the sequence is in its use of Bond as a man of action, where he puts his life on the line right beside his fellow navy comrades. 007’s own service with the Royal Navy is given a subtle yet special significance here as he risks it all beside men who had the same training and took the same oaths as he did to serve and protect. It’s a triumph to watch Sean’s Bond racing around aiding the frogmen as they’re about to be killed, yanking breathing apparatuses off the enemy divers or stealing their knives to shank others in the meantime. It’s a welcomed and stark contrast to the climax of Goldfinger where he spends most of his time strapped to a dirty bomb, separated from the fight going on between the Knox forces and Auric’s soldiers. All of the underwater action ultimately leads up to Bond’s face-off with Largo as he plows through enemy after enemy, leading into the final bit of action on the Disco Volante. While the Disco Volante bout may not hold up to modern action standards with its use of shaky rear projection and camera tilts to simulate the action of a boat sliding along the top of rock rising from the sea, I’ve always enjoyed it as a bit of nascent blockbuster action. The moment depicts the single most populated fight that Sean’s Bond has in the series where he’s on constant assault from a pack of enemies, giving it a very tense edge.\n\nThe action is very dynamic, with Bond having to juggle the oncoming enemies with his fists and a variety of props while rushing his way back to the boat’s wheel to steer them away from a collision course with the oncoming hills of rock out in the water. Because of this the fight is always changing and our hero has to keep the status quo in his favor with every step. It’s not an easy fight for Bond and we see him struggle and take the hits as Largo and his men gang up on him. In the final minutes of the sequence Bond is too late to divert the boat from hitting an obstruction as he is sent with a clatter to the floor. Largo takes advantage of the moment and is about to shoot him dead, until Domino intervenes at the last minute. The sequence finishes off with Bond in the kind of danger the film constantly pits him against, making all his victories feel earned.\n\nAll in all, Thunderball is able to feature a mysterious spy plot like Dr. No and retain the ominous SPECTRE conspiracy and lively action of From Russia with Love in a perfect package that improves on these elements in great ways, feeling like a greatest hits collection of Terence Young’s landmark James Bond work. I count the film as the first true Bond blockbuster that showed all the places that the franchise could go in its use of dynamic and ambitious action.\n\nHumor-\n\nAs with all the Terence Young Bond films, Thunderball is at its most witty when lines are delivered dryly or with sarcasm, laced with some black comedy.\n\nIt’s a riot to hear Bond comment about the Prime Minister’s wife losing her dog when he’s called into the 00 briefing room, hand Fiona some sandals when she tells him to get her something to put on, or hear him rib Largo about how easy it is to shoot clay pigeons. I get my most laughs during scenes like the latter where Bond is giving it to Largo inch for inch, deflating his ego big time as only he can. These moments are great companions to the dinner conversation Bond and Dr. No share in the villain’s lair during that film, Bond’s belittling of Grant on the train in From Russia with Love and his endless dismantling of Goldfinger’s ego at the ballooned man’s own golf course and ranch in that feature.\n\nThis movie is jam-packed with great dialogues brought to life by the measured timing of the actors, and I’d lose pages trying to discuss each and every one the film contains. It’s only in Thunderball where you can hear Bond make an irrigation joke, quip about his sharp teeth and equate a nuclear incident to the theft of a dog.\n\nPlot Plausibility-\n\nWhile Thunderball isn’t as raw and real feeling as From Russia with Love, it never becomes overly bizarre or too far out of the realm of logic as I watch it.\n\nThe script does inarguably have moments of convenience and coincidence, including the fact that Bond is laying up at the same clinic Lippe and Angelo happen to be using to mount their SPECTRE plot, he finds the body of Francois that just so happens to be the brother of Domino, and later in the film he is picked up on the road by Fiona who just so happens to be traveling there at the very moment he is walking out from the beach. The script writers seem to address this convenience openly as Fiona drops Bond off after taking him for a ride. Bond points out that they are staying at the same hotel, to which Fiona replies, “What a coincidence.” Bond returns with, “Yes, so convenient.” The writers were aware of some of the leaps they were demanding audiences to take with them, but kept marching on regardless to tell their story.\n\nAnd even with these moments of coincidence or convenience, the film never makes any of it feel overly lucky or sloppy in presentation. In true Bondian fashion, a plot revolving around the seizure and ransom of nuclear weapons, one of the most dire in all of Bond, feels not far removed from what could actually happen in a Cold War climate like that of the period.\n\nVillain’s Scheme-\n\nContinuing off of the discussion of Thunderball’s plot plausibility, it’s astounding how real a threat SPECTRE’s plan poses here. The scheme carries great mystery and tension, and it doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility that the theft of nukes from a NATO ship could happen, if not under the exact same circumstances as we see in the film. It’s without a doubt one of my favorite villain plans of the series, because it’s the perfect mix of a Cold War spy plot and its implications of intrigue, duplicity and war with all the mystery and suspense of a good thriller added on for good measure.\n\nThe ransom for nuclear weapons must have been scary for audiences of the time to imagine in the heat of the real world conflict of the Cold War at that place and time, and seeing the British government react so neurotically to the threat sells how dangerous the entire episode is. It’s quite an ingenious one as well. While $100 million doesn’t seem like anything at all for current day viewers, adjusted for inflation that value would reach near $800 million dollars today. It’s interesting that SPECTRE doesn’t strive to ask for more money in the deal, considering they have the Brits and Yanks in a bind and at their mercy, but why the organization acts this way tells us something about them. SPECTRE wants a hefty sum to go towards the investment of their other operations, but they don’t want to rob the Brits of so much capital that markets crash and the financial aftermath negatively effects the world economy, which would hurt their own interests too.\n\nFurthermore, SPECTRE could accept the diamonds the Brits are sending and turn around and nuke Miami anyway, but that would only send the world governments after them harder and, maybe worse, make the organization appear to be dishonorable, a most damaging outcome considering how Blofeld prides his criminal group as being better than that. In this way, SPECTRE and Blofeld by extension are a better class of criminal in comparison to those who appear in films from other areas of cinema (with more exaggerated mustache-twirling villainy in their antagonists) because they commit bad acts to further their own interests, but are still true to their word and don’t resort to overly crude methods that would be illogical for what their motivates are. There’s a sense of professionalism Blofeld seems intent on keeping alive, even amidst the rough and tumble Cold War spy world. SPECTRE aren’t out to destabilize the world, as there still has to be a world around for them to manipulate and extort money from at the end of the day. That said, they’ll take every opportunity they can to expand their control and stake in power at every level, like a true to form business.\n\nI also love what we learn about SPECTRE in this film and how they operate, as well as what their professional standards are and what they expect from their organization’s members. In From Russia with Love we got to visit the island where they train normal men into fierce killers, while in Thunderball we see first hand the effects of all that training as SPECTRE agents operate in the field. We’re a fly on the wall during a secret briefing in Paris, hidden behind the front for the organization’s French headquarters, “The International Brotherhood for the Assistance of Stateless Persons.” It’s quite fitting that SPECTRE works behind the walls of such a place, considering it prides itself on being a stateless organization with no countries to answer to or serve. I also wouldn’t be surprised if SPECTRE’s agents even bribed or persuaded some of these displaced and temporary vagabonds to join their cause, using the peoples’ desperation against them for the organization’s own gain.\n\nWhen Blofeld announces that an embezzler is in the organization’s midst during this briefing, we see first hand how the organization treats those who resort to underhanded tactics and spread disloyalty throughout the hierarchy. The power and fear Blofeld displays here is palpable. When Lippe is ordered to be punished for his erroneous pick of the greedy Angelo for the Vulcan operation, we also learn that SPECTRE has a dedicated Execution branch whose sole job entails taking out contracts from inside the organization itself to erase any members whose mistakes prove too monumental or destructive to entertain any longer.\n\nIn the character of Dr. Kutze we also learn just how easy it can be for SPECTRE to swallow up people to help lead their cause. Kutze is a talented enough scientist to continue his work happily in his Warsaw lab, but as Largo points out, any scientific discoveries he made would amount to nothing but a million dollars for a Nobel Prize, while his efforts in SPECTRE would give him endless amounts more. In this way, a good man like Kutze is tempted to the side of the organization where his efforts-no matter how inherently bad they are-will be well rewarded and appreciated by the hierarchy in a far greater capacity than the scientific community could ever manage, which is a tantalizing temptation. There’s a slight implication that Kutze may have been “persuaded” against his will by SPECTRE to come along and help on the NATO operation, which would give credence to their overreaching power and explain why the scientist later turns against Largo and his crew when he can stomach their actions no longer.\n\nEach of these factors contribute to the feeling of drama that unfolds during Thunderball. Because we are welcomed behind the veil of SPECTRE and see their plot form incrementally from behind sealed walls, their ransom of the world with the ultimate threat of nuclear destruction cuts all the deeper. Experiencing Blofeld’s Paris briefing with his agents makes us feel like the invasive ones, as if we shouldn’t be witnessing what we are. We stiffen helplessly as we see all the counter moves that are being made by SPECTRE to offset the British and American governments, and James Bond through proxy. Although we know deep in the back of our minds that 007 has to succeed in his mission, doubt is nonetheless seeded early on through the NATO plot.\n\nDirection-\n\nAfter sitting out Goldfinger when he felt he had nothing more to provide to the Bond brand, Terence Young signed on for the Thunderball project to tie off his work with the character with great finality. After Goldfinger had marveled the world and made Bond even more of an international icon, Young knew that the fourth time around the track his Bond had to be bigger than ever, with not even the sky being the limit of its scope.\n\nWhat resulted was no doubt his most ambitious and logistically challenging Bond production by a landslide, and he almost died during his second Bond film, if that tells you something. Thunderball demanded that Young juggle, advise and shoot over one hundred extras and crew members in the Bahamas in and around heavily packed locations that offered little wiggle room with film equipment and gear that amounted to over twelve tons in weight. He was able to reign in the chaos and bring the film into port with psyche unbroken, however, in no small part thanks to one of the all-time greatest production teams in cinema.\n\nIt’s fitting that Thunderball marks Young’s third and final go at a Bond film, because the film represents a culmination of all his strengths as a director, as well as what made his Bond films special, with an added shot of ambition thrown in to credibly tell the story he was assembling. Young’s shooting style and chemistry with his actors is visible on his return, as is his tenacious ability to get shots nobody else could have managed even half as well.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned, Thunderball is the perfect offspring of Dr. No and From Russia with Love, retaining the mystery and detective-styled narrative of the former and a tense and dangerous SPECTRE conspiracy best seen in the latter. Thunderball under Young’s direction takes the best of Bond, adapts it to the new story and adds new twists into the mix to make things interesting. The SPECTRE plot is dire and mind-blowing in its consequence, and the amount of time we are underwater with or without Bond really sets this film apart as special and like no other. This is the water Bond film, fitting for the climate of the Bahamas which it is set around.\n\nI would be erring if I didn’t also include a special recognition of the work of Ricou Browning, who, along with his cameraman Lamar Boren and engineer Jordan Klein, was able to direct the underwater sequences of Thunderball and bring them to glorious life. The second-unit of this movie really had their work cut out for them, but thanks to Browning and his team, who assembled, choreographed and shot the feverish action and built the many underwater machines used in each underwater sequence (like the gear that transports the two nukes with an original design by Ken Adam), we get to enjoy it all. It would be difficult to believe that Terence Young didn’t direct the underwater sequences, including the final battle, because the camera work and stunts are exquisitely produced and shot with an artistic eye. The divers we see cast as Navy frogmen and SPECTRE agents in the final battle are made up of a team of specialists Browning himself, a dedicated diver and stuntman, had brought to the Bahamas to shoot the sequence.\n\nThanks to the widescreen presentation of Thunderball, the underwater crew used the expanded frame to their advantage, filling the camera’s picture box with dozens of extras battling it out with knives and spear guns in awe-inspiring fashion. There’s an epic feeling these sequences carry, and the images we get are some of my favorites in the film. We cut from shots of tussling divers to those of sea creatures reacting to the chaos unfolding around them, juxtaposed with images of dead frogmen and SPECTRE agents sinking to the ocean floor with blood rushing out of their wounds. Everything we see feels alive and real, and never comes off like a staged film production. At times I think I’m watching a snuff film as the stuntmen realistically stab each other with knives, movements that are backed up by perfect sound design to convey the power of the killing blows as blood trails swarm out of their bodies.\n\nI haven’t ever and likely will never see a film with better shot and choreographed underwater photography than Thunderball, or one that balances logistical challenges with the finesse it managed. There were so many stuntmen to manage and command during the filming of this sequence, and so many logistical challenges to juggle and balance when it came to film equipment and keeping continuity with the events being filmed, yet the filmmakers are able to make it look so easy, throwing in some stunning photography to boot as the bright orange frogmen pop amid the crisp blues of the deep. The result is the definition of movie magic, showing the amazing results you can achieve with a lot of work, manpower and creativity.\n\nIn another special mention, United States Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Russhon, who helped EON get the necessary authority to shoot in Turkey for From Russia with Love and fly over the real Fort Knox in America for Goldfinger, returned again for Thunderball. For his part, Russhon provided the second-unit with the experimental rocket fuel used to blow the Disco Volante to smithereens, and also secured EON’s access to the fulton surface-to-air recovery system from the United States Navy that appears at the very end of the movie to get Bond and Domino out of dodge. The latter was a true to life spy tool used in the profession to get agents out of dangerous locations, giving Thunderball even more of a grounded feeling despite its blockbuster essence.\n\nAll these factors are a testament as to why the Bond team of the 60s is unmatched in every way: they took immense challenges and found clever ways to get the job done with their amazing cast of associates and problem eliminators.\n\nOpening Title Design-\n\nComing off of Robert Brownjohn’s stunning back-to-back opening title designs for From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, Maurice Binder returned for the first time since Dr. No to provide the introductory credits to Thunderball. Brownjohn’s titles were so impressive in their cleverness and style, so it’s only fitting that Binder’s own design arriving just after those two would be just as striking and unexpected. Looking through his vast catalogue of James Bond title designs that stretched into the late 80s, the one he delivered for Thunderball could be his crowning achievement for how it is able to truly stand on its own.\n\nWhereas Brownjohn always preferred to work with the canvases of three-dimensional human bodies, Binder chose to use the almost 2D looking effect of swimming silhouettes to bring the opening titles of Thunderball to life. It was in this very design that the man introduced the use of nude female bodies as an ingredient in a credit sequence, an innovation that would remain throughout the entire life of the series, even to this day. If a title design for a new Bond film rolls around and there’s not at least one shot of a female silhouette in it, the criticisms you’ll hear in response are all down to the iconic tradition that was started with this movie.\n\nBinder’s title design realizes its success by being both dynamic and gymnastic, all at once. The dynamism is derived from the very rich and vibrant use of blues, reds, greens and purples as the color of the background is shifted on a dime, and the gymnastic quality is captured through how the divers are photographed as they move through the frame. The images of women twisting and turning in the water are very straightforward and easily consumable, but they go a long way towards proving that simplicity can sometimes be best. Using just a tank full of water at Pinewood studios, Binder was able to create the entire sequence from the ground up with a small group of divers on hand. Instead of throwing everything at the wall to see what stuck, he mindfully chose not to muddle a simple concept with an over abundance of motifs or visual noise. Through restraint, these titles hit a sweet spot.\n\nThe real magic of the entire sequence is down to how Binder was able to create an almost 3D effect with silhouettes that come off as blackened bits of 2D moving art. While the divers begin by swimming from side to side, giving them a 2D impression, as the sequence goes on they break the convention and gravitate towards the camera itself, popping out as their dimensional selves. At specific moments in the titles we watch the female divers swim straight at the camera before rising up and out of frame, as if they were avoiding a collision. In other instances, the male divers create the same effect as they tear across the screen from the background, armed with spear guns and seemingly going for the kill as they chase after the women, giving the sequence more than an ounce of threat.\n\nLike a cartoon jumping off of a comic book page, somewhere along the line the concept of 2D and 3D compromise and mesh as a surreal effect is created and the visuals are given a “pop” by design. I would love to watch this particular title sequence in theaters with 3D glasses for this very reason, to witness the bizarre effect of the divers swimming right for me.\n\nThe use of various divers, lush colored backgrounds and water effects to create bursts of water and rising bubbles come together to make the Thunderball titles like no other we have ever seen in the Bond series before or since. The underwater imagery is inseparable from the film itself and its own emphasis on showing characters fighting for survival as they dive below great depths, creating a design that unifies the movie as a whole. Tom Jones’ opening tune only adds more bravado and might to the proceedings as the notes ringing out further accentuate the cinematic and highly masculine images Binder has designed for us to take in.\n\nScript-\n\nI have stated my love for the script of Thunderball in the previous sections of my analyses in the categories of “plot plausibility” and “villain’s scheme,” so I will add my final thoughts here to further argue why I find this script so strong in particular.\n\nFirstly, Thunderball does what so little films can seem to manage to do, even outside of Bond: it welcomes us into the villains’ homes, figuratively and literally. We get a window into SPECTRE, how the organization is run and what Bond is up against. We see firsthand how they are planning to meticulously get their nukes, and what steps they’ve taken to make sure their seizure of the weapons is successful. Some think it’s a weakness on the part of Thunderball to show us so much of SPECTRE’s plans and how they unfold, but I view it as quite special and thrilling. Part of the reason why From Russia with Love is so different and fascinating is because it too allows us inside the minds of the villains as we see how and why they are acting out their plans in the ways they are. We see the shadow of SPECTRE gradually swallow up Bond and cast him into doubt and danger, and that’s nothing short of thrilling.\n\nIt makes Thunderball special that we get to know Bond’s greatest enemies, that we get to see how their organization is run and how the SPECTRE briefing under Blofeld contrasts with the later 00 briefing under the command of M, two vastly different leaders with different causes and morals, both expecting the best of their agents. We see how Largo and his crew get the nukes and all the problem solving they perform to ensure their plans are a success. This makes it very difficult to nitpick the holes of Thunderball beyond some conveniences because the movie strives to show us how the villains are doing what they are doing step-for-step.\n\nSecondly, in Thunderball Bond is back to being a man of action, a dynamic, not static character, unlike in the previous film. The Terence Young Bond returns, the half spy half detective super combo who meticulously bugs his hotel room to survey any enemy action against him, who uses his cleverness to eradicate his enemies, and who completes his mission by any means necessary, regardless of the increasing odds stacked against him. In Young’s films we get to see Bond subtly develop from a man who had no idea of SPECTRE’s existence in Dr. No and who became an ant-sized agent under the hell of the organization in From Russia with Love to a man who now knows his enemy well and is irreverently confident and devil may care in the face of Blofeld and his agents.\n\nBond smells SPECTRE all over the NATO plot, and when he meets the plan’s architect, Largo, he immediately mocks the man and lets him know he is aware of his organization’s scheme and his connection to it. Both men know who each other are as they meet at the card table, nobody else, and Bond rather cavalierly defeats Largo in a pompous way while still keeping it gentlemanly in a nice sequel to the Dr. No card game that debuted the character to the world. It’s clear that after having two missions where he was in over his head and blind to SPECTRE’s influence, Bond refuses to be duped a third time around, and that makes him more dangerous to the organization than ever before: the gloves are off and he’s playing no games.\n\nThe subtle black comedy of Thunderball’s script gives it even more character as a piece of writing because in it beautiful or harmless imagery is contrasted directly with images that are evil or dangerous by design. As if out of Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, the nuclear weapons Largo and his crew are seizing have a label painted on them that reads, “Handle like eggs.” This element always strikes me as both funny and frightening at the same time, as the label brings to mind the soft and harmless imagery of eggs in a carton while being overlaid on top of the delicate, volatile and serious weaponry of the nukes. Because of the visual metaphor forged between eggs and nukes here, I can feel the hair on my arms stand on end as I picture Largo and his team trying to cautiously remove and transport the missiles around the Bahamas, with me always anxious that they’re destined to go kaboom if any excitable movement is made on their part and the weaponry are triggered to their finite reaction. A nice touch.\n\nAs a greater theme, Thunderball is a story of concealment, where everything is being hidden between the characters, even when the truth is right under the nose. The beauty and grace of Fiona masks a deadly and resourceful tactician, just as Bond’s dapper suits deceive those around him and SPECTRE’s Paris headquarters is concealed inside a quaint social services building. Domino’s innocence and sweetness hide away the tragedy of her character and the pain she faces under the thumb of Largo, and the Vulcan plane Bond is so intent on tracking is purposely hidden from sight in camouflage net. Even the British and American governments are lying to the innocent citizens of the world. Both world powers know the consequences of their failure to retrieve the nukes, as well as the severe aftermath that would come following a nuclear attack on a major English or American city, but they can’t share the dreaded news with the world for fear of the catatonic panic it would cause and what the leak would drive SPECTRE to do in retaliation.\n\nIt’s in these moments that Thunderball’s razor sharp script puts an emphasis on race against time stakes. Back in Britain, M and his superiors are forced into agreeing to SPECTRE’s demands, ringing Big Ben the demanded 7 times to signal their arrangement. The government reports this ringing as a mechanical failure to the public, masses who are unaware in their ordinary lives of just how close the world is to reaching a possible breaking point. It is downright thrilling to know that while Bond is in the Bahamas trying every avenue of strategy to locate the nuclear missiles as the clock winds down-from causing an island-wide blackout to crashing Largo’s estate and manipulating his mistress-the people of Miami and/or Britain have no idea how close they are coming to being decimated. Even when the film concludes and Bond’s team stops the SPECTRE scheme from coming to fruition, the denizens of Florida and his native land back home don’t know him from Adam, even though he’s the only thing that came between them and utter vaporization. Thunderball also does a better job than most of the films at showing the real stakes that are set against Bond’s survival. Throughout the film Bond courts death itself often, by shark and by bullet, and finds himself stumbling into a crowded club with a bloodied wound to his leg at his most dire. Defenseless and preyed on, our hero must turn the tides in his favor and become a predator once again. As with every Young film, the script delivers us a Bond who can be shaken without being stirred, and who uses his brains and a little brawn to get himself out of some desperate circumstances. Because it’s not easy for him his victories are more triumphant, no matter how fleeting they will soon be rendered.\n\nIn light of the above elements, Thunderball goes a long way toward showing us what a thankless job Bond has when he can walk down the street staring people directly in the eyes who exchange no pleasant words with him, even though they wouldn’t be around if it weren’t for his expertise in spy craft. Bond goes all in for humanity with his every breath, but can never share his feats and gambles with anyone outside the agency on professional principle. His sacrifices must go on unnoticed and unrewarded, cast in shadow, never to see the light. Such is the life of a spy whose risks so often meet no rewards.\n\nIn conclusion, Thunderball’s script is a rich and exciting mix of theme, dialogue and character that packs a heavy punch. The immense tension created as Bond races to stop doomsday is a perfect culmination of what made Young’s Bond films so special and mind-bending in the first place with their emphasis on showing Bond overcome danger alongside fleshed out and dimensional allies and enemies.\n\nCinematography-\n\nCinematographer Ted Moore returns for yet another time as the visual mind behind Thunderball, giving us some of his all-time greatest work behind the lens as a result. As a general style, Moore really uses vibrancy to his advantage in this film, popping the color of the scenery with how he shoots his sequences. This is added to by the costume department, who enabled Moore’s camerawork to saturate the"
