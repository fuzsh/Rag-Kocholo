More info: Working with a USB keyboard Package - Fixed the create-clonezilla-sysresccd installation problem\n\nThanks to Chris Rehder 2.2.0CD - Clonezilla Live updated to version 1.0.9-10\n\n- Updated script reloc-img to support remote images (through samba and nfs) Package - Added patch-clonezilla-sysresccd, a script that can be used to\n\ncustomize an existing Clonezilla-SysRescCD ISO file\n\nMore info: Using patch-clonezilla-sysresccd 2.1.0CD - SystemRescueCD updated to version 0.4.3\n\n- Super Grub Disk updated to version 0.9677 1.4.0CD - A script to help relocate a Clonezilla image file during restoration\n\nhase been added to Clonezilla Live.

This way the user will only have to download the\n\ndebian live ISO file, in order to create Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nThe debian live ISO file has not been included because of its size\n\n(~ 79 MB), which would make the source tarball too big.\n\nThe files can be fount in /root/.clonezilla-sysresccd/files\n\n- All cfg files have been moved to /root/.clonezilla-sysresccd/files\n\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version, please delete/move\n\nthese files, and adjust your configuration files (conf files)\n\n- A new variable has been inserted to the configuration files (named\n\nDebianLiveFolder in clonezilla-sysresccd.conf and DebianLiveFolderP\n\nin profiles.conf). This variable should point to the folder where\n\nthe debian live ISO has been saved. If you are upgrading from a\n\nprevious version, please adjust your configuration files (conf files)\n\n- Added support to script create-clonezilla-sysresccd for compressed\n\n(tar.gz) isolinux configuration files, in order to implement menus 1.2.0CD- Added script continue-multi-cd to SystemRescueCD\n\nThis script makes it easy to continue a multi session CD 1.1.0CD- Minor changes (cfg files) 1.0.0- - Moved to version 1.0.0 in order to eliminate any missunderstanding about\n\nthe development status of Clonezilla-SysRescCD CD - Added the options -A and -W to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nSyntax:\n\n/opt/drbl/sbin/ocs-iso -A \"ocs-rs command\"\n\n/opt/drbl/sbin/ocs-iso -W \"ocs-rs command\" [image file]\n\nBoth options set up the restore CD/DVD for automatic image restoration.\n\nThe difference is that when using the -W option the image [image file] is\n\nappended in the ISO file (maximum 4.4BG). When -A is used, the image\n\nfile will be appended to the CD/DVD, after the ISO file created by this\n\ncommand is burnt, using growisofs -M ... (maximum 8GB).\n\n- Added the option -O to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nSpecifies the ISO file name to use when -A, -W options are used.\n\n- Added the options -V and -P to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nThe user creating a restore CD/DVD can now specify its Volume ID and\n\nPublisher ID, respectively.\n\n- Added the option -I to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nSpecifies the user selectable menu item title of the main screen of a\n\nrestore CD/DVD. Applicable only with options -W and -A\n\n- Added the script what-cd to sysresccd.\n\nThis script will identify the CDs present on a pc, and report the\n\ndevice name of the writer (if any)\n\n- Added a copy of the Clonezilla-SysRescCD site to the CD. In this way\n\nthe documentation will be available at all times Package - Fixed a bug that would appear when option -b would be used without any\n\nother options. Then create-clonezilla-sysresccd would not be able to get the\n\nISO file name 0.1.1Package - Build system upgrade\n\nuse ./configure to upgrade the program\n\nuse ./configure --enable-fullInstall to install it\n\n- Fixed a potential script installation bug\n\n- Normal user can get help\n\n- Minor changes"
