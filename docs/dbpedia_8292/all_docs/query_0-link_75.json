I had assumed that because that the external HD was not formatted with a linux file system, clonezilla was not seeing it. So I used GPARTED to wipe the HD then add a GPT table then formatted to ext4. Clonezilla still does not show that drive as an option when it comes time to mount it. Any idea as to why?",
