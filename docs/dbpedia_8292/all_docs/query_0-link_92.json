        "text": "Hello community\n\nFor security reasons, I´ve created a image of an openhabian installation (For this I have used Win32DiskImager) and write it into another SD card with the same program (Win32DiskImager),but this installation Does not take IP configuration, that is way I can not see it in my Network, for that reason I could not gain acces trough SSH.\n\nCould someone give me some guidance about that,I need create a copy of my installation for security reasons.\n\nThanks.\n\nHello matt1\n\nThanks for to reply, I have heard about of Amanda Backup, I will research about the others programs you mentioned.\n\nThanks for your advice.\n\nTo be clear, I am recommending Paragon Hard Disk Manager which can be used for free (after registering the product) to do what you wish. ie create a bit accurate copy of a SD card onto another card even if it is a different sized card. Amanda does backup partitions but I have never used it. Under Linux you can use great opensource programs but they are no where near as user friendly as Paragon Hard Disk Manager.\n\nI am using win32diskimager all the time to clone my openhabian installation. It is correct, that it is not that flexible with card size, you always need a device of same size or larger.\n\nBut nevertheless, it should boot and take the ip address. The problem is not the cloning procedure but something else. It is not unlikely that you will run into the same problem with a different cloning procedure.\n\nPls also read my response in that thread\n\nHere’s a link how I reduced my SD footprint, but don’t do that with your active card, only with the backup one.\n\nhttp://www.netzmafia.de/skripten/hardware/RasPi/SD_Karte_verkleinern.html\n\nYou can also use Amanda to create and restore an image and then use pishrink before you use dd to write it to the new SD card. Works on the go, i.e. no need to shutdown OH meanwhile.\n\nHi,\n\nNot sure if this will hep but I use rpi-cone for taking snapshots of my running SD to a second one, it basically uses rsync to replicate the source to destination and the destination is bootable.\n\nI use this for any OS/OH upgrades and the process has worked fine so far, I have it run automatically via cron once per week and then I can run it manually as required, every now and then I shut the RP down and swap the cards to ensure the clone boots without issues.\n\nI also have rsync running from the pi to a NAS for additional backups, again cron controlled, for belt in braces.\n\nK.\n\nA lot of thanks to all, every suggestion is valuable, I will test all one by one. Regarding the accurate result, I will choose one and will let you know the procedure and results.\n\nThank you very much\n\nHello community.\n\nI create a copy of my openhabian installation using program Paragon Hard Disk manager which was suggested in this thread, I want let you that such copy works very well, even the UUID and SECRET keys used for register OpenhabCloud service have not changed (These are the same of original Installation), this was for my a great happy surprise. I thougt that such codes would change.\n\nWithin the next days I will test Amanda Backup and will comunicate my results.\n\nThanks\n\nYou may run into IP-trouble because of the differen MAC address of the network card of your other Raspberry Pi. This is the one thing you didn’t (and cannot) clone. So your router’s DHCP server WILL notice that this is a different device and will assign an unused IP address for this new device. This is done to keep the old IP unused so that your “old” Raspberry Pi can have its IP back as soon as it comes online.\n\nHave a look into your router’s configuration and clear any previous IP reservation you may have created for your first Raspberry Pi, then create a new reservation for your desired IP address and the NEW Raspberry Pi’s MAC address or device name."
