        "text": "Clonezilla is a free program for backing up complete Operating Systems and optionally restoring them to the same, or replacement, HDD\n\nFor General Users\n\nClonzilla is a technical routine that is NOT SUITABLE for general Windows users, who should obtain and use the utility provided by the manufacturer of their new HDD\n\nFor Intermediate Users\n\nIt is not well suited to routine data backup, although users data within the partition(s) will be backed up by as part of the process..\n\nAscertain HDD capacity\n\nClonezilla assesses number of LBA of original and any replacement HDD\n\nit might refuse to restore to a drive of the same nominal capacity\n\nUntil recently, Clonzilla required a replacement HDD to have equal or larger number of LBA\n\nRecent releases can also restore to a smaller HDD\n\nsame routines used\n\nneed to be certain that the \"used space\", to which the image will be expanded, does not exceed the size of the new HDD (plus some operating margin)\n\nBe certain to read the documentation thoroughly before using Clonezilla, particularly if cloning any HDD containing MS Windows system, where the process has many \"gotchas\"\n\ntry to have the online documentation available on another PC\n\nread the section pertaining to the proposed clonzilla routine\n\nthe safest procedure with Windows is to create an image of the whole disk on a USB HDD\n\nthe folder containing the image will have adequate metadata to identify hardware to which it belongs\n\nimages contain only used blocks of the source drive and can be a fraction of the size of the source HDD\n\nthe image folder can be copied or moved to another repository, to provide additional contingency\n\nif required, the image can be restored to the original HDD\n\nit can also be restored to a replacement (typically larger) HDD\n\ndo not install two Windows system disks concurrently in a PC\n\nif the PC were booted, Windows would render both systems inoperable and give \"Blue Screen of Death\"\n\nthere is a case for creating a clonezilla image of any new Windows computer BEFORE its first boot to Windows\n\nthe latter would require entry of permanent settings such as \"first user name\" and \"computer name\"\n\nClonezilla may be downloaded from\n\nhttp://clonezilla.org\n\nAlternatively, a more general purpose utility CD ISO image containing it may be purchased from\n\nhttp://partedmagic.com/\n\nStrictly for Geeks\n\nPartitions rather than whole HDD can be imaged or cloned.\n\nbootloader routines might not be adequately cloned via this routine\n\nRecent releases of Clonezilla can create a Virtual Machine disk image from a natively installed Operating System"
