How can this be achieved? Upstart is concurrent and doesn't show any particular terminal so I'm not sure how this could be done.\n\nIf you're wondering why, I'd like for it to ask me what school I'm at which would run a specific script for that school's customizations. This way I can have one company image that runs everywhere I work in."
