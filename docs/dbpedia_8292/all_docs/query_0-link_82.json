A better method is used.\n\nBug fixed: toram menu for grub should use toram=filesystem.squashfs instead of toram so that it's consistent with that of syslinux.\n\nThe boot media should not be mounted again as read-write mode in function ocs-live-env-prepare of ocs-functions. Otherwise when rebooting, due to the squashfsfs are mounted, it can not be unmounted. Thanks to ilovecats for reporting this.\n\nThe example \"clone-multiple-usb-example.sh\" was removed. Because it's in the main menu already.\n\nAn example gen-rec-usb was added. It could be used to create a recovery USB flash drive directly from the machine.\n\nAn option -q was added to ocs-live-dev so that it can be used to use the existing image on the recovery device.\n\n-- Steven Shiau <steven at nchc org tw> Tue, 25 Feb 2014 09:10:00 +0800\n\nClonezilla live 2.2.2-11\n\nThe underlying GNU/Linux operating system was upgraded.

Thanks to ilovecats for this idea.\n\n-- Steven Shiau <steven at nchc org tw> Tue, 18 Feb 2014 10:11:00 +0800\n\nClonezilla live 2.2.2-7\n\nThe underlying GNU/Linux operating system was upgraded.

This will work for both ocs-sr and ocs-onthefly.\n\nProgram partclone.restore was replaced by partclone.$fs in ocs-onthefly because partclone.restore will be deprecated in the future.\n\nPixz is used in ocs-onthefly local to remote cloning.
