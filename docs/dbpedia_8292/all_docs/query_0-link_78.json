In fact I’ve left the disk in the drive so I don’t have to scramble for it when I need it.\n\nThat’s enough background information. Let’s get on with the actual instructions which is what this post is supposed to be about…\n\nLaunch terminal and type the following command\n\nsudo chown emeneye /tftpboot\n\nThis changes the owner of the /tftpboot directory to emeneye. Replace ‘emeneye’ with the your own username\n\nenter root password\n\nDownload the latest clonezilla zip file from http://clonezilla.org/downloads.php\n\nRight click on the clonezilla zip file and choose ‘Open with Archive Mounter’.\n\nOpen the mounted folder and from the /live directory copy the following files to the /tftpboot directory:\n\nvmlinuz\n\ninitrd.img\n\nfilesystem.squashfs\n\nGo back to the Terminal and type the following command\n\nsudo gedit /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default\n\nThis will launch a text document. At the end of the document add the following entry (before “PROMPT 0”):\n\nlabel Clonezilla-live MENU LABEL Clonezilla Live KERNEL vmlinuz APPEND initrd=initrd.img boot=live config noswap nolocales edd=on nomodeset ocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\" ocs_live_keymap=\"\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\" ocs_lang=\"\" vga=788 nosplash noprompt fetch=tftp://IP_ADDRESS_OF_FOG_SERVER/filesystem.squashfs\n\nSave and close the document.\n\nReboot your client machine and PXE-boot into FOG and you should see a new menu option labeled Clonezilla Live.\n\nPS.\n\nThis will also come handy if I ever come across a situation when I need to back up a Linux box in future without having to use the live cd."
