I wrote a usage guideline, but it needs 38 steps.\n\nNow I wonder whether I could customize my Clonezilla USB Stick so that it does not provide all the options.\n\nE.g. I could get rid of\n\nthe language selection. It's totally fine if it's always English\n\nthe keymap choice. It should just select \"keep the default\" (\"don't touch the keymap\" on older versions)\n\nthe operation mode choice. We always want \"device-image\".\n\nthe storage selection. We always need \"local_dev\".\n\nWhat would I need to do to configure Clonezilla to get rid of these choices?\n\nClonezilla calls that 'preseeding' as described in that web link. As you pick options, Clonezilla shows the preseed commands in green-on-black as shown here.\n\nFor example, the preseeding command should include a language selection command locales=en_US.UTF-8 and a specification for no special keyboard layout with keyboard-layouts=NONE in syslinux.cfg or isolinux.cfg as appropriate.\n\nanswered Apr 1, 2019 at 22:43\n\nK7AAYK7AAY\n\n3,87844 gold badges2525 silver badges4040 bronze badges"
