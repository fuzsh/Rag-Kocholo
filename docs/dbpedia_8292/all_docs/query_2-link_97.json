        "text": "How to use CloneZilla to encapsulate the system and restore?\n\nauthor: HYSTOU\n\n2024-04-05\n\nOverview:\n\nCloneZilla can take a system such as Windows/Linux and completely port it to another machine, ensuring that the data, partitions, mounts, boot entries, everything is exactly the same.\n\nNote: The machine to be restored needs to have the same key hardware configuration as the machine to be mirrored and encapsulated, otherwise it may produce problems such as graphics cards and other drivers not working.\n\n1.Download CloneZilla\n\nDownload: //clonezilla.org/downloads.php\n\nSelect the second item stable -3.1.0.22\n\nSelect CPU architecture as amd64.\n\nSelect file type as ios.\n\nClick Download to download the image file\n\n2.Make CloneZilla boot USB flash drive\n\nDownload rufus utility to make a USB flash drive.\n\nDownload: //rufus.ie/downloads/\n\nInsert the USB flash drive and run rufus, select the USB flash drive in Drive, select stable -3.1.0.22.iso in SELECT, select GPT in Partition scheme, select START to start writing after the configuration is complete.\n\nNote: The production will delete all the data files in the USB flash drive, please make sure the data in the USB flash drive has been backed up before production!\n\nAccording to the prompts click 2 OK, wait for the writing to complete, press CLOSE to exit and eject the USB flash drive.\n\n3. Perform Windows/Linux system packaging\n\nPreparation:\n\nCloneZilla startup USB flash drive\n\n>16G capacity USB flash drive (used to store the package file, the storage capacity of the USB flash drive is recommended to be larger than the capacity of the CloneZilla startup USB flash drive, so that it is convenient to differentiate in the packaging process)\n\nmake sure that the system to be packaged can boot normally and the driver has been installed.\n\nNote: If used to encapsulate the Windows system, please make sure that the encapsulated system is not connected to the Internet to avoid activation failure when using the key to activate the system later!\n\nInsert the CloneZilla USB flash drive into the USB port of the computer to be encapsulated, press the computer switch button and then quickly hit the keyboard F7/F11 key to enter the Boot menu, select the USB flash drive with the prefix \"UEFI:\" and enter to confirm the entry into the ClonZilla encapsulation wizard.\n\nSelect cloneaill Live (VGA 800*600).\n\nSelect language and keyboard layout.\n\nSelect the working mode: here it is recommended to select Start_clonezilla Start Clonezilla.\n\nSelect device-image work disks or partitions using images.\n\nSelect Local_dev Use local device(E.g:hard drive,USB drive);\n\nInsert the backup USB flash drive, wait for 5-10 seconds and then press Enter to go to the next step to confirm whether the backup USB flash drive is recognized or not. Press \"Ctrl+C\" to exit after recognizing the USB drive.\n\nSelect the backup USB flash drive, if the USB flash drive has more than one partition, be sure to select the partition with the largest capacity;\n\nSelect no-fsck skip checking/repairing the file system before mounting;\n\nMove to via keyboard Tab key, select to enter the next step;\n\nWait for the system to detect whether the capacity of the backup USB flash disk meets the capacity required for encapsulation, confirm that the conditions are met and press Enter to enter the next step;\n\nSelect Beginner Beginner Mode>Savedisk;\n\nEnter the name of the backup file, you can also use the default, in order to facilitate the later distinction, you can enter your own;\n\nSelect the name of the backup hard disk;\n\nSelect the compression option, usually just choose the default one;\n\nAsk whether to check the image, here you can choose to skip the check, which can save the closed backup time;\n\nSelect senc not to encrypt the image.\n\nThe system asks which operation to perform after the completion of encapsulation, here we choose \"-p poweroff\", and finally enter \"y\" to confirm the backup, the backup is complete, the computer will enter the shutdown state, at this time has been completed to complete the encapsulation of the backup, the backup file (image) will be retained in the backup USB flash drive.\n\n4. System Restore\n\nCloneZilla boot USB flash drive inserted into the USB port of the computer you need to restore, the system restore steps and step 3 package is basically the same, the same part will not be introduced, this article directly from the beginning of the different parts.\n\nEnter the following page and select restoredisk.\n\nSelect the naming of the previous encapsulation and backup;\n\nSelect the hard disk;\n\nSelect KO Use the partition table from the image;\n\nSelect scr No,skip checking the image before restoring;\n\nSelect \"-p poweroff\" after restoring is complete;\n\nConfirm the restore information, press Enter after confirming the completion, and press \"y\" twice to confirm the relevant information, the system will automatically shut down after the completion of the restore, after shutting down means that the restore is complete.\n\nAfter the restore is completed, the system will automatically shut down, and the system will shut down to indicate that the restore is complete. After the restore is completed successfully, remove all external storage devices from the USB port, and press the on/off button to enter the operating system desktop. This completes the introduction of using CloneZilla to encapsulate and restore.\n\nPS: Thank you for your patience to see this, if the restoration process encountered related problems, you can contact our customer service online to assist in solving, I wish you a happy life!\n\nSolution to Frequent Reset of Motherboard BIOS\n\nGeneral solution for automatic repair of startup prompts after Win10/Win11 system update\n\nRelated Article"
