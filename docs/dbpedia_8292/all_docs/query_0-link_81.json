        "text": "Disk cloning is the process of making an image of a partition or of an entire hard drive. This can be useful for copying the drive to other computers or for backup and recovery purposes.\n\nTip: Over time file systems get new features and the mkfs utilities change their defaults, but not all new features can be enabled without reformatting. So, when moving data to a new drive, instead of cloning the block devices or file systems, consider creating a new file system and only copy the files (and their attributes, ACLs, extended attributes, etc.) with e.g. rsync.\n\nBlock-level cloning\n\nUsing dd\n\nSee dd#Disk cloning and restore and Core utilities#dd alternatives.\n\nUsing ddrescue\n\nIf possible, data recovery from disks should be performed using their native interface: SATA or, for older drives, IDE. Results may vary while using USB adapters.\n\nGNU is a data recovery tool capable of ignoring read errors. ddrescue is not related to dd in any way except that both can be used for copying data from one device to another. The key difference is that ddrescue uses a sophisticated algorithm to copy data from failing drives causing them as little additional damage as possible. See the ddrescue manual for details.\n\nTo clone a faulty or dying drive, run ddrescue twice. For the first round, copy every block without read error and map the errors to rescue.map.\n\n# ddrescue --force -n /dev/sdX /dev/sdY rescue.map\n\nwhere X is the partition letter of the source and Y of the target block device.\n\nFor the second round, copy only the bad blocks and try 3 times to read from the source before giving up.\n\n# ddrescue --force -d -r3 -n /dev/sdX /dev/sdY rescue.map\n\nIn some circumstances the disk controller or a USB adapter may lock, while attempting to read a particular sector. The -i option may be used to instruct ddrescue to start reading after that position.\n\nNow you can check the file system for corruption and mount the new drive.\n\n# fsck -f /dev/sdY\n\nFile system cloning\n\nUsing e2image\n\ne2image is a tool included in for debugging purposes. It can be used to copy ext2, ext3, and ext4 partitions efficiently by only copying the used blocks. Note that this only works for ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems, and the unused blocks are not copied so this may not be a useful tool if one is hoping to recover deleted files.\n\nTo clone a partition from physical disk /dev/sda, partition 1, to physical disk /dev/sdb, partition 1 with e2image, run\n\n# e2image -ra -p /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\n\nTip: GParted uses e2image to efficiently copy ext2/3/4 partitions.\n\nUsing xfs_copy\n\nfrom can be used to copy an XFS file system to one or more block devices in parallel.\n\nNote: By default, xfs_copy will generate new UUIDs for the new file systems. To clone the UUID instead, use the -d option. This will create a duplicate file system suitable for disk replacement.\n\nTip: To clone XFS to multiple block devices in parallel, simply append them all to the xfs_copy command.\n\nFor example, to clone the file system on /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdb1, run:\n\n# xfs_copy /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\n\nVersatile cloning solutions\n\nThese applications allow easy backup of entire filesystems and recovery in case of failure, usually in the form of a Live CD or USB drive. They contain complete system images from one or more specific points in time and are frequently used to record known good configurations. See Wikipedia:Comparison of disk cloning software for their comparison.\n\nSee also Synchronization and backup programs for other applications that can take full system snapshots, among other functionality.\n\nClonezilla — A partition and disk imaging/cloning program which helps with system deployment, bare metal backup and recovery.\n\nComplete backup and recovery solution: able to image and restore entire drives including boot sector, bootloader, partition table... for different operating systems including Windows\n\nSupports BIOS and UEFI, MBR and GPT\n\nSupports most filesystems (ext2-3-4, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs, jfs, btrfs, f2fs, FAT12-16-32, NTFS, HFS+, UFS and others) and LVM2\n\nFree-space aware when using Partclone (default), Partimage (optional), ntfsclone (optional), otherwise falls back to dd for block-level copying (dm-crypt/LUKS containers, unsupported filesystems...)\n\nSupports multi-threaded compression with different formats (including zstd) and levels\n\nSupports encrypting the backup\n\nMulticasting server to restore to many machines at once\n\nDedicated LiveCD available to boot from CD, USB drive or PXE server\n\nIncluded on the Arch Linux installation media.\n\nhttps://clonezilla.org/ ||\n\nDeepin Clone — Tool by Deepin to backup and restore.
