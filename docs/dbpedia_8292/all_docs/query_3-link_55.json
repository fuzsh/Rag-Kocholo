That support has been added recently, but it is still considered experimental.\n\nDownload the testing version of clonezilla (right now at 3.0.2...) and you can test it out. Note however that the Clonezilla forum states:\n\nOf course, since it's the initial [APFS] support, please backup important data before you use. Please give it a try and let us know the results if you can."
