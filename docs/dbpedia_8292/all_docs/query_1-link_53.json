        "text": "Recently, I found out my HDD is dying: Tumbleweed dead after NTFS partition failed\n\nI went looking for info about cloning the contents of an old HDD to a new one and I found this thread: What needs to be done when cloning HDD\n\nFollowing the second thread, I think the procedure would look something like this:\n\nBuy a new 3TB HDD to replace the old one\n\nDownload and burn Clonezilla onto an USB stick\n\nPlug the new HDD\n\nBoot up Clonezilla and clone the old HDD onto the new one\n\nUnplug old HDD\n\n…done?\n\nThe problem is that the person in the original thread is cloning from a healthy HDD. I don’t know if people use Clonezilla to clone from failing hard drives. On their website, Clonezilla advertizes itself as a recovery tool:\n\nClonezilla live is suitable for single machine backup and restore.\n\nClonezilla saves and restores only used blocks in the hard disk.\n\nbut I don’t see them explicitly talking about cloning from damaged hard drives.\n\nIs this safe? I don’t expect to recover everything from the HDD, but will Clonezilla be able to at least recover as much as possible without dying in the middle of the process because of a random bad block?\n\nIf the used blocks are good, then no problem, because for filesystems it understands, it doesn’t do block-by-block backups.\n\nIf used blocks aren’t good, then files are damaged or corrupted, and it will fail at reading those. I don’t recall offhand if it has options to try to recover with multiple reads - that’s something you probably want to ask the Clonezilla folks about in more detail. They have an online discussion area at Clonezilla / Discussion\n\nFrom what I’ve read, ddrescue will create an image out of my old HDD. I don’t have anywhere to store a 3TB image, so I’m not sure what I would have to do. Would I have to buy 2 new hard drives?\n\nThanks, I’ll post there too.\n\nBy the way, should I unplug my old hard drive until I’m ready to make the transition to the new one?\n\nI do not like the sound of that. Are either of those disks connected via USB2? Heaven help anyone using 16TB disks at that rate. If not SATA or at least USB3, to me it suggests to expect failure to copy some sectors, but hope for better. Good luck!\n\nLet us know after 10-12 hours or so if it already has done most of the disk and advanced to retries on problem areas, and the extent of remaining problem areas. If you can determine remaining problem areas are limited to unused disk areas (absence of formatted partition(s)), you may have already done all that’s needed even though “completion” not yet reached.\n\nIf it was mine I think I’d pop the cover and aim a desk fan at the that HDD’s case location. Room temp here is normally 82F, so all mine run on the warm side of average. I’m lucky when I get as much as 30 months’ life from a UPS battery. They do not like the heat their chargers create, much less elevation from reduced rejection rate.\n\nUpdate: 454GB done, 2546GB to go.\n\nYay!\n\nETA went down to “only” 4 days earlier today, but now we’re back to 15 days for some reason. In any case, after some adjustments, avg transfer rate went from ~1.5MB/s to ~3MB/s.\n\nI’m running it like this: ddrescue -f -c 16 -a 10M -n /dev/sda /dev/sdc mapfile\n\nNope. They’re both connected directly to the mb’s sata ports.\n\nIt’s been almost 2 full days, so here I am.\n\nlol\n\nThe weird thing is that, as slow as it is, zero errors have been reported so far. Which actually checks out with the behavior I was observing: putting aside the NTFS partition, I was able to read from and write into the HDD – it just so happened to be extremely slow.\n\nThe old HDD is already sitting on top of my desk outside the PC tower, so there’s not much I can do about that. At least it’s winter over here, so we’re not getting to the usual 40°C (104°F) of the summer.\n\nI’ve looked around the internet for tips about how to try and speed up this process, but honestly I think this is really as good as it gets. I’m hoping just some parts of the disk are slow instead of the whole thing, but I’m not holding my breath.\n\nAs I said, the PC tower is sitting on my desk with its guts out because I thought this process would take maybe a day and a night, but I guess I’m gonna put it back together and resume the rescue process with the PC put back together and in place. I’ll report back in a few days.\n\nThank you for the help!\n\nCloning a damaged disk will create a damaged clone. That’s by definition of “clone”. It’s safe regarding further damage due to prolonged use of the damaged disk.\n\nYou may try to repair the clone. This can be a tedious undertaking. Some data loss will occur anyway.\n\nA truly safe procedure is restoring from backup. btrfs makes for easy and unobtrusive backups.
