        "text": "If you’ve used Symantec Ghost http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec_Ghost or Acronis True Image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronis_True_Image then you will know how useful they are for making images of computer hard disks. Great for backing up all your data or even for disaster recovery. The down side is they are both expensive programs to buy and for us Linux users, not free (as in beer or as in speech).\n\nClonezilla http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonezilla is in my view as good as, if not better than, the closed source competition and is highly regarded by IT professionals. I use Clonezilla regularly to image PCs before doing a distribution upgrade and I image both Linux and Windows partitions. I also use it for backing up hard disk and for migrating data between disks. For the latter I use Clonezilla along with GParted Live http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php. to resize partitions after the cloned image is restored to a new (larger) hard disk.\n\nBecause it runs from a ‘live’ CD (ISO image obtainable from http://tinyurl.com/c2myn8) and will read most hard disk formats including NTFS, Clonezilla is OS agnostic. It can backup at partition level to another hard disk or to a USB hard disk, and as we shall see it can also back up to a network share, or in our case to a FreeNAS storage server*.\n\n*See my earlier blog posts on installing and configuring FreeNAS http://preview.tinyurl.com/2eglwrm and http://preview.tinyurl.com/2978jqv .\n\nCloning a Hard Disk\n\nInsert the Clonezilla ‘Live CD’ and boot the PC off the CD.\n\nThe following menu will be displayed.\n\nSelect the default option, and press the Enter key. Clonezilla will boot.\n\nEventually displaying the following “choose language” screen.\n\nSelect your language, then press the Enter key.\n\nThe “configuring console data” screen will appear\n\nAccept the default and press the Enter key.\n\nYou will now be given two options, as we don’t want the command prompt, choose the default option Start Clonezilla and press the Enter key.\n\nYou will now get a screen asking if you wish to work with images or clone from one physical disk to another (duplicate). Choose the device-image option and press the Enter key.\n\nYou will now be asked where you are going to save the image to, as FreeNAS runs Samba, we will choose samba_server.\n\nPress the Enter key.\n\nNote: If you are not using FreeNAS, but are instead saving to a Windows or Linux Samba share, then you would still select this option.\n\nYou will now be asked to set-up a network IP address for Clonezilla so that it can connect to the network share.\n\nAs we have a DHCP server (in my case it is my DSL router) I’m going to select dhcp.\n\nPress the Enter key to continue.\n\nOnce Clonezilla has obtained an IP address from the DHCP server, you will be asked for the IP address of the Samba server which contains the file share you wish to connect.\n\nIn my case the address is of the FreeNAS server is 192.168.1.252, yours is probably different.\n\nOnce you have entered the address, press the Enter key to continue.\n\nYou will be asked to provide the domain name, if you don’t have a domain name set you can leave this blank. In my case mine is called workgroup.\n\nPress the Enter key to continue.\n\nYou will now be asked for a username to connect to the FreeNAS server, the offered name is Administrator. Replace this with a valid username for your network share. In my case I have a username of fernsm1 set-up on my FreeNAS server.\n\nPress the Enter key.\n\nYou will then be asked for the destination directory, and will be offered the directory name of /images. Replace this with the name of your network share and the directory within that share you wish to save the image in to.\n\nIn my case this is /NASDisk1/images, remember that Unix and Linux operating systems are case sensitive. So if the share name is in upper case, make sure you write it in upper case!\n\nUPDATE: 15/12/10\n\nYou can also enter the share name. So in my example the Samba/ CIFS share name is /DiskImages and you just enter what I’ve put in bold text. You may find this more reliable than specifying the actual path.\n\nWhen done, press the Enter key.\n\nThe following screen will be displayed. This is a summary of what you have entered so far, and warns that you will now be asked to enter the password.\n\nPress the Enter key.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen the following will appear.\n\nThe above is the command string being used to connect Clonezilla to the share.\n\nType in your password and press Enter.\n\nIf the following will be displayed, this means that Clonezilla has successfully connected to the FreeNAS server/ network share. if you get an error message at this stage, check the share name and/ or username/ password and start again.\n\nPress the Enter key.\n\nYou now need to select the mode you wish to run Clonezilla in, a list of choices will be displayed\n\nAs we are creating an image of the PC, we will use the savedisk option. Select and press the Enter key.\n\nYou will then be asked for a name to give the image. By default Clonezilla gives a unique file name based on the date and time. When you have give a file name for the saved image, press the Enter key to continue.\n\nYou will now be asked to select the hard disk on the PC which you wish to clone. If you only have one hard disk, just press the Enter key. Otherwise use the cursor keys and space-bar to select/ deselect a disk..\n\nYou will now go through a number of screens offering “advanced extra parameters”. Accept the defaults on all.\n\nOnce completed, Clonezilla builds a command string should use wish to use it again without having to go through all the menus. In our case it should look similar to the following\n\nPress the Enter key to continue.\n\nClonezilla will now start the cloning process, telling you what it is about to do and giving you the option to cancel.\n\nIf you are happy with the summary it provided, press y followed by the Enter key to continue.\n\nClonezilla will check the file system of the source PC to ensure okay and determine the cloning method it will use before it starts to clone the hard disk. If satisfied, it will then commence the cloning process.\n\nOnce the disk has been cloned, you will see something like this\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully cloned your PCs hard disk to your FreeNAS network share.\n\nPressing Enter, will give you an options menu:\n\nPoweroff\n\nReboot\n\nEnter command line prompt\n\nStart over\n\nWarning: The default is option 2."
