        "text": "This tutorial is going to show you how to use Clonezilla Live to back up your hard drive. Clonezilla is a free open-source and reliable tool for bare metal backup and recovery of disk drives.\n\nClonezilla Features\n\nYou can create an image of the current disk or partition (disk imaging), and restore the image to disk at any time.\n\nAllows you to clone directly between two disks (disk cloning), without creating a disk image.\n\nThe disk image can be encrypted with ecryptfs, and saved to or read from local disk, SSH server, Samba server, NFS server, WebDAV server or AWS S3 storage.\n\nThe disk image can be compressed with GZIP or ZSTD algorithm.\n\nSupports lots of file systems like ext4, XFS, Btrfs, F2FS, FAT32, NTFS, HFS+, UFS.\n\nSupports MBR and GPT partition table.\n\nSupports BIOS and UEFI firmware.\n\nClonezilla Server Edition allows you to do massive system deployment over the network.\n\nUnattended mode: Almost all steps can be done via commands and options.\n\nWhat You Need\n\nA thumb drive to create a Clonezilla live USB\n\nA hard drive that you want to make a backup of\n\nClonezilla is included in the repository of many Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, so why do we need to create a Clonezilla live USB? Can’t we just install Clonezilla on the operating system? This is because Clonezilla currently doesn’t support online imaging/cloning. The partition to be imaged or cloned has to be unmounted.\n\nIf you have a Debian, Ubuntu, or Arch Linux live USB, you can install Clonezilla on your current live USB, then launch Clonezilla from the live USB (sudo clonezilla). But for the purpose of this tutorial, I will show you how to create and use Clonezilla live USB.\n\nNote: I use a hard drive in this tutorial, but you can use any storage media (HDD, SSD, SD card, etc).\n\nStep 1: Download Clonezilla Live ISO Image\n\nThere are three types of Clonezilla:\n\nClonezilla live: for single disk imaging and cloning.\n\nClonezilla lite server: for massive deployment.\n\nClonezilla SE (server edition): for massive deployment. A DRBL server is required.\n\nIf you just want to back up a single disk, choose Clonezilla live. Go to the Clonezilla live download page. There are two stable versions of Clonezilla live:\n\nstable: based on Debian with no proprietary software. It may not work with the latest hardware.\n\nalternative stable: based on Ubuntu with proprietary software for better hardware support.\n\nI personally use the alternative stable version.\n\nThen select the CPU architecture, file type and repository. You should choose ISO as the file type. If you use the ZIP file type, you might see the “missing partition table” error when creating Clonezilla live USB.\n\nStep 2: Create a Clonezilla live USB\n\nNote: If there are files in your thumb drive, I recommend backing up your files before creating the live USB.\n\nLinux\n\nIf you use Linux on your computer, then you can use the dd command to create Clonezilla live USB. First, insert your thumb drive to your computer. Then open up a terminal window and run the following command to get the device name of your thumb drive.\n\nparted -l\n\nAs you can see, the device name of my thumb drive is /dev/sdb. Next, run the following command to create Clonezilla live USB.\n\nsudo dd if=/path/to/clonezilla-iso-file of=/dev/sdX status=progress\n\nTo make sure every bit of information is written to your thumb drive, run the sync command.\n\nsync\n\nNow you can boot your computer from the USB thumb drive.\n\nWindows\n\nIf you use Windows on your computer, then you can use the Etcher tool to create Clonezilla live USB. It’s very simple to use. Install the software on your computer, then launch Etcher. It automatically selects your USB thumb drive. Select the Clonezilla ISO file and click Flash button.\n\nThen wait for it to finish flashing your thumb drive.\n\nOnce it’s done, boot your computer from the USB thumb drive.\n\nStep 3: How to Use Clonezilla Live to Back Up Your Hard Drive\n\nOnce your computer is booted up from the USB thumb drive, you will be greeted by the Clonezilla Live boot menu. Choose the first item to boot Clonezilla live.\n\nOnce it starts, you have the option to choose a language.\n\nAnd you can change the keyboard layout. (I use the default US keyboard.)\n\nThen, it asks you if you want to use the Clonezilla wizard (which is easy for beginners) or use the command-line interface. Choose the first option to start the Clonezilla wizard.\n\nNext, select a mode. This tutorial selects the first mode.\n\ndevice-image: create an image of the current disk or partition\n\ndevice-device: clone directly between two disks, without creating a disk image.\n\nAfter that, choose where the Cloned image will be saved. You have many options: local device, SSH server, Samba server, etc. This tutorial selects a local device. If you choose one of the other options, please follow the instructions to set up the network connection.\n\nIf you choose local device and want to store the image on an external USB hard drive, then insert the USB hard drive to your computer now and press Enter.\n\nThen Clonezilla will scan your storage devices. As you can see, it detected my 31 GB USB thumb drive. Press Ctrl+C to exit the scanning window.\n\nOn the next screen, choose your USB drive.\n\nThen you can choose if you want to check and repair the file system on your USB drive. I choose no-fsck because my USB drive is totally fine.\n\nNext, choose a directory to store the Clonezilla image. By default, it’s stored on the root directory of the storage device. Press Tab key and choose Done.\n\nThen, it will show you how much free space your storage medium has. Press Enter to continue.\n\nNext, choose between beginner and expert mode. If you are a Clonezilla beginner, then choose the beginner mode.\n\nIn the next screen, you can choose to save an entire disk as an image or save a specific partition as an image. This tutorial chooses the first one (savedisk).\n\nThen give the image a name.\n\nAnd choose which disk you want to make a backup of.\n\nIf you have a software RAID setup, then Clonezilla will give you several options, including the RAID device (md0, md1). You just need to choose one of the real disks, such as sda.\n\nNext, choose which compression algorithm you want to use to compress the image.\n\nAfter that, choose if you want to check the disk file system before backing it up.\n\nAnd choose if you want to check the image is restorable.\n\nIn the next screen, you have the option to encrypt the image, which is useful if you save the image on a network location. Since I will store the image on my local USB drive, I choose not to encrypt the image.\n\nAnd choose which action to take when everything is finished.\n\nNow Clonezilla kindly gives you the equivalent command-line, so you can enter this one-liner next time you make a backup without going through all the questions again. Press Enter to continue.\n\nPress y to start saving your disk to an image.\n\nOnce Clonezilla finishes its job, you can power off your computer. If the process failed, you can check the /var/log/partclone.log file.\n\nHow to Restore a Clonezilla Image to Disk\n\nThe restoration process is very similar to creating a backup. I won’t explain every step but show a few key steps.\n\nAfter booting up your computer from the Clonezilla live USB, choose your language, keyboard layout and start the Clonezilla wizard, choose the device-image mode to restore the image to disk.\n\nThen select where the image will be read from. If the image is on a USB hard drive, you need to select the USB hard drive and mount it as /home/partimag. Note that when you select a directory for the image repository, you should not choose the directory tagged with CZ_IMG.\n\nAfter that, you should be able to choose the restoredisk mode to restore an image to local disk.\n\nAnd follow the rest of the instructions.\n\nCreate Clonezilla Recovery ISO Image\n\nIf your disk image is stored on a remote network location, but you want to restore the image on a machine without Internet connection, you can restart Clonezilla and create a bootable ISO image after you create an image backup for your disk. This allows you to boot other machines and restore the disk without an Internet connection. (You need to save the disk as an image first, then you can choose the image file to create an ISO file.)\n\nSelect device-image mode and then recovery-iso-zip.\n\nChoose the disk image file to create an ISO file from.\n\nWhen asked which device to be restored, enter ask_user, so you will be able to choose the destination device when restoring the image to disk.\n\nAnd follow the rest of the instructions.\n\nClonezilla will ask you to choose a file format for the ISO image:\n\niso file: for CD/DVD\n\nzip file: for USB flash drive\n\nActually, the .iso file format works for both CD/DVD and USB flash drive. On Linux, you can use the dd utility to create a bootable USB flash drive from the iso file.\n\nOnce you have a bootable USB flash drive, you can use it to restore the image on your orignal computer or on another computer if you want to.\n\nOne disadvantage of Clonezilla recovery ISO is that it can’t automatically convert hard disk name such as /dev/vda to /dev/sda. This will become a problem if you use the recovery ISO file on another computer that doesn’t use the same hard disk name. So in this case, you should not use a recovery ISO. The default Clonezilla image is able to convert hard disk names.\n\nUnable to Boot\n\nIf your computer isn’t bootable after restoring from a Clonezilla image, you might need to:\n\nboot the computer from a Linux live ISO image and reinstall the GRUB boot loader to your hard disk.\n\nMake sure the /etc/fstab file contains the correct partition name.\n\nHere’s how to reinstall GRUB boot loader for a BIOS computer. In the Linux live environment, find the name of your OS partition.\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nFor example, my OS partition is /dev/sda2. Then mount this OS partition.\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/\n\nNext, run the following command to reinstall GRUB boot loader.\n\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory /mnt/boot/ /dev/sda\n\nIf your computer uses the new UEFI firmware and the GPT parition table, then you need to find the ESP partition.\n\nsudo parted -l\n\nFor example, my ESP partition is /dev/sda1. Then mount this ESP partition.\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/\n\nNext, run the following command to reinstall GRUB boot loader.\n\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory /mnt/ /dev/sda\n\nClonezilla Drawbacks\n\nWhile Clonezilla is reliable, it does have some drawbacks that limit its usage.\n\nIt doesn’t support online disk cloning/imaging. The disk has to be unmounted.\n\nIt can’t do incremental backup.\n\nBacking Up Individual Files and Directories\n\nIf you just want to back up individual files and directories, not the entire disk, then you can use a tool like Duplicati to automatically back up your files to cloud storage. Duplicati can encrypt your files to prevent prying eyes.\n\nHow to Use Duplicati to Back Up Files on Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint\n\nUsually, I use Clonezilla to do a disk image backup twice a year and use Duplicati to automatically back up individual files and folders every day.\n\nWrapping Up"
