This release is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2020/Oct/16).\n\nImplement a better mechanism to run ocs-onthefly: Now ocs-onthefly mainly uses ocs-sr to save the pseudo image, and let partclone do the device to device clone. This is similar to that of Clonezilla lite server. Due to this improvement, some major changes for ocs-othefly in order to sync with that of ocs-sr:\n\nThese options have been changed to totally different meanings: -d|--destination|--target was -t|--target -po|--port was -p|--port --net-filter was -i|--filter -p|-pa|--postaction was -pa|--postaction -u|--use-nuttcp was -u|--use-netcat\n\nNew options: -t|--no-restore-mbr -t1|--restore-raw-mbr -t2|--no-restore-ebr\n\nBy default, the network cloning is changed to use zstd to compress the data instead of gzip.\n\nocs-sr's option -f|--from-part-in-img is changed as -f|--from-part since it now supports both from an image and a device.\n\nocs-update-initrd: Remove useless prompt.\n\ncnvt-ocs-dev: dev-fs.list should be converted, too. Add a tag file device_name_converted.info in the converted image.\n\nFor drbl-ocs.conf:Remove : PARTCLONE_RESTORE_ONTHEFLY_OPT_INIT\n\nAdd\n\nONTHEFLY_NET_PIPE=\"nuttcp\" NC_PORT_DEFAULT=\"9000\" PARTCLONE_LOG=\"/var/log/partclone.log\"\n\nIf a disk has not any partition, it can not be the source for ocs-onthefly. It will just quit to avoiding confusion.\n\nAdd \"--rsyncable\" for zstd saving.\n\nSince zstdmt is equivalent to zstd -T0, remove \"-T${cpu_no}\" in extra_zstdmt_opt.\n\nUse -np|--net-pipe PROGRAM instead of -u|--use-netcat in ocs-onthefly so that it's easier to switch, and it can be selected in the expert mode.\n\n-- Steven Shiau <steven at stevenshiau org> Sun, 18 Oct 2020 10:38:00 +0800\n\nClonezilla live 2.6.8-15\n\nThe underlying GNU/Linux operating system was upgraded.
