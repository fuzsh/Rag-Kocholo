I just plug in the stick, boot up the pc and after the work is done the pc shut down.\n\nNow i need an confirmation that the backup/restore was successfull. For this purpose i want to execute an shell script which copy the log-file into an specific file to a other partition on the usb-stick after the work is done.\n\nI tried to execute the script as postrun-method in the syslinux.cfg but this always led to an error. Furthermore i tried it with drbl-ocs but i'm not sure if i did it right.\n\nhere is the shell script i want to execute:\n\n#!/bin/sh ############# /opt/drbl/sbin/ocs-sr -q2 -j2 -z1p -i 4096 -p true savedisk img sda ############# dir=/home/partimag/logs/ time=$(date +\"%H-%M-%S\") # current time i=$(ls -l $dir | wc -l) # index # create log-directory if it didn't exist if [ ! -e $dir ] then sudo mkdir $dir fi # create new log-directory ( sudo mkdir $dir/$i\"_\"@$time # copy all log-files to the created directory sudo cp /var/log/* $dir/$i\"_\"@$time # shut-down the machine sudo shutdown -h now\n\nthe first instruction (after the shebang) was my attempt to use the drbl-ocs but i have not really an idea what this is. I believe it's another interpreter which can handle shell scripts too.. Am i right ?\n\nan here is the syslinux.cfg i use:\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd.img boot=live username=user config quiet noswap edd=on nomodeset nodmraid noeject locales=en_US.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=NONE ocs_prerun=\"mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/\" ocs_prerun1=\"mount --bind /mnt/ /home/partimag/\" ocs_live_run=\"/lib/live/mount/medium/syslinux/clonezilla.sh\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\" ocs_live_batch=\"yes\" vga=788 ip= nosplash i915.blacklist=yes radeonhd.blacklist=yes nouveau.blacklist=yes vmwgfx.enable_fbdev=1\n\nplease help ! Thanks :)"
