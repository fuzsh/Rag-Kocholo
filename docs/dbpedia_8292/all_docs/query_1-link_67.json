With dd I know the command and would be confident I'm not going to trash the wrong HD. dd just takes too long unfortunately.\n\ndd if=/dev/sda5 of=/dev/sdb1\n\nI have tried Clonezilla Live but became confused with their terminology for source and target. Hence I didn't do anything, hoping to get some advice here first.\n\nMy question: Is the Clonezilla wizard asking for target first and source second, so that the first device I put will be the one whose data will be destroyed?\n\nAlternatively is there some other way of backing up? For the PC partition (this is a dual boot machine) I use 'DriveImage XML', which is really fast (and you use the Knoppix LIVE CD for restoring). Something like that for Linux would be great.\n\nWhen using the Clonezilla disk-to-disk option, you will first be prompted for a source drive, then the target drive. The target drive will be overwritten and all information on it will be lost.\n\nThis is in contrast to the other option, disk-to-image, where you are first asked to select a target device which the image will be saved at. Then, at the end, you will be asked what drive(or drives) you want to include.\n\nHope this comes to help.\n\nanswered Feb 10, 2016 at 0:20\n\nddybingddybing\n\n9899 bronze badges"
