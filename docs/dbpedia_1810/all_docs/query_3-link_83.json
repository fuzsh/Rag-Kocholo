        "text": "Netherlandish panel painting of the fifteenth century attempted to break down the barrier between viewer and image. Most scholars have considered this primarily a visual conceit through growing verism and the new medium of oil paint. What has not been considered is the role of smell in the compositions and the affect these implied scents had on devotees. I argue that painters deliberately exploited smell to recreate ideal contexts for devotion via memory and odor-cued behavior. This thesis investigates how olfaction, painting, devotional literature, and liturgical experience interact. Current social and behavioral science experiments are surveyed to show the importance of smell to recall memory, to recreate experience, and influence behavior. The link between scent used in popular devotional manuals and what is depicted in painting allows the contextualization of fifteenth-century Flemish paintings of the Adoration of the Magi, Annunciations, and devotional portraits, which are investigated to posit how implied odors could have shaped interaction with them.\n\nDuring the late Middle Ages a unique type of ‘mixed media’ recycled and remnant art arose in houses of religious women in the Low Countries: Enclosed Gardens. These are retables, sometimes with painted side panels, the central section filled not only with narrative sculpture, but also with all sorts of trinkets and hand-worked textiles. Adornments include relics, wax medallions, gemstones set in silver, pilgrimage souvenirs, parchment banderoles, flowers made from textiles with silk thread, semi-precious stones, pearls and quilling (a decorative technique using rolled paper). The ensemble is an impressive and one-of-a-kind display and presents as an intoxicating garden. In this essay the exceptional heritage of such Enclosed Gardens is interpreted from a range of approaches. The Enclosed Garden is studied as a symbol of paradise and mystical union, as the sanctuary of interiority, as the sublimation of the sensorium (in particular the sense of smell), as a typical gendered product, and as a centre of psycho-energetic creative processes.\n\nThe article analyses information on religious elements in the representation of senses in literary sources of late imperial China. The Introduction presents psychological and social functions of olfaction with reference to China. The second part deals with the concepts of xiang, especially in the meaning of incense, but also the supernatural and symbolic aromas and the pollutant load of its antonym chou. The third part offers a survey of other bodily sensations in relation to religion.\n\nThis essay considers two lost paintings of the five senses by Jan Brueghel the Elder and twelve Antwerp masters which were commissioned in 1617 by the city of Antwerp for the governors of the Habsburg Netherlands, Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella. Through an examination of contemporary replicas of the lost works it is suggested that, rather than being fully-fledged allegories or representations, they depend upon an ideal of polyphonic harmony akin to that expressed in the concept of the Music of the Spheres. The article explores the different semiotic character of the two pendants and the significance of particular motifs, among them a sheet of paper displaying geometric diagrams from Euclid’s Elements and the Latin phrase 'Utram maius aut minus' (‘which is greater or lesser’). Themes include: the articulation of difference within a regime of resemblance; giving voice to the complex politics of sovereignty and gender in the Habsburg Netherlands; and ways in which these works can be related to the debates surrounding the relationship between the soma and the psyche on the eve of the Cartesian rupture. The pendant Senses are viewed as a response to the threatened harmony between ‘greater and lesser’ to which the Habsburg Netherlands were ideologically committed.\n\nTreats the motif of smell in King Lear, focusing on feminine odors and their associations with death. Suggests that \"all the men in the play are affected by female bodies and smells, but this negative sniffing out of the female body is most apparent in the character of King Lear.\" Concludes that, after \"Lear detects his feminine odor,\" he finally \"finds the redemptive aromas of the feminine in Cordelia, but too late, contributing to both their deaths."
