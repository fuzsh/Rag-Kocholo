Two attempts directed at prevention stand out: vaccines and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and other materials, such as curtains.\n\nResults of the first mortality study of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets in The Gambia showed a reduction in all-cause mortality of 63% in children under 5 years of age (Alonso et al. 1991). These results led directly to the implementation of the National Impregnated Bednet Programme (NIBP) in The Gambia. The evaluation of NIBP confirmed the earlier study results showing a reduction in mortality of 25-38% in children under 5 in the context of a fully operational program (d'Alessandro et al. 1995).\n\nThe UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and other participating donors have sponsored three additional large-scale trials (populations of 60 000-120 000 each) in Africa to determine whether impregnated mosquito nets or curtains can reduce mortality in different epidemiological settings. The results of this research are critical to the formulation of policy recommendations regarding the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) on a larger scale. Three of these trials (northern Ghana, coastal Kenya, and The Gambia) are now completed, and their results have been recently published.\n\nThere is now a need for operational research on the cost, feasibility, effectiveness, and long-term sustainability of this approach to define the role of ITNs at the national, district, and community levels in countries where the disease is endemic.\n\nA joint TDR-IDRC initiative, currently under way, will attempt to solicit proposals and fund the required operational research over the next few years. The organization of an international meeting in Tanzania and the release of this book are the first steps in the process. For TDR and IDRC, the initiative demonstrates our continuing commitment to the development, promotion, and implementation of cost-effective interventions that will reduce the burden of tropical diseases in developing countries.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the Canadian International Development Agency.

Strong, convincing evidence is now available to document the beneficial impact of ITNs on malaria disease episodes in children.\n\nLarge studies in The Gambia, Ghana, and Kenya have documented a 17-63% reduction in overall child mortality as a result of ITN use. Several more ITN trials currently under way in Africa and elsewhere in the world, are confirming this efficacy in settings where malaria is highly endemic. Collectively, these studies reveal the potential of ITNs as an important public-health intervention in the limited arsenal of malaria-control strategies.\n\nHowever, the cost, effectiveness, long-term sustainability, and practical feasibility of routine (\"nonresearch\") ITN-implementation programs are not yet well documented. The considerable impact measured in highly controlled trials has partly obscured the fact that ITN programs are both complex and costly. They will not be easy to implement and sustain on a large scale in routine health-intervention programing. Therefore, to better inform program managers on the \"how to\" of this intervention, more operational experience is needed. Novel approaches to the financing, distribution, periodic reimpregnation, and promotion of ITNs need to be explored.\n\nBoth the UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) believe that the ongoing efficacy research must now be matched with a comparable effort in effectiveness research. This is usually obtained through operational research done as much as possible with collaboration among researchers, implementing agencies (governmental and nongovernmental), and the private sector. TDR and IDRC have taken the initiative in this area, as outlined in Chapter 1, which also introduces ITNs as a malaria-control tool.\n\nAs a first step in the IDRC-TDR initiative, the available experience on technological, implementation, and promotional aspects of ITN trials and programs in Africa was reviewed (Chapters 2-4). These reviews attempt to cover all published documents and to identify unpublished reports (\"gray literature\"). The second step, based on these reviews, was an international workshop held in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) in November 1994. It brought together researchers and implementors with the main objective to develop a strategic agenda for operational research. A summary of the main recommendations from this workshop are presented in Chapter 5.\n\nITN Technology\n\nHigh-priority topics for research in the field of ITN technology are as follows:\n\nStandardize current field tests and develop new field tests to improve monitoring of mosquitoes' resistance to pyrethroids;\n\nIncrease knowledge of interaction between insecticides and netting and of optimal insecticide doses;\n\nDevelop a simple way to measure the dose of pyrethroids on netting;\n\nDevelop new materials and procedures to reduce the need for retreating netting; and\n\nImprove packaging for insecticides.\n\nITN Implementation\n\nParticipants recommended systematic study of implementation models based on local variables such as actors, institutions, infrastructure, resources, and political conditions. Models could be \"pure\" (that is, completely private, governmental, social marketing, or nongovernmental) or \"mixed\" (that is, combining two or more types). Local- or national-level decision-support models and policy mapping were seen as tools worthy of development. In addition, essential work was recommended in areas with potential for significant improvement in future ITN programs:\n\nStudying the integration of ITN activities with other health interventions;\n\nStudying traditional and innovative financing mechanisms;\n\nDescribing the effect of tax incentives for import, production, and sale of nets and insecticides; and\n\nDeveloping essential indicators for monitoring ITN programs.\n\nITN Promotion\n\nParticipants identified three areas where research in ITN promotion is needed:\n\nAcquiring nets or curtains;\n\nUsing ITNs correctly; and\n\nRe-treating ITNs with insecticide correctly.\n\nDefining the products, target audiences, key messages, and most cost-effective communication channels within given implementation models was seen as essential. With the aid of focused ethnographic research, promotional messages can be based on reinforcing and inhibiting beliefs in target populations. Participants also thought it important to study whether people are more motivated to acquire and use ITNs by perceived reductions in nuisance biting or by perceived reductions in disease. Another issue requiring investigation is optimal pricing of ITNs.\n\nSeveral general recommendations were offered for political action to improve conditions for malaria control in general and ITN interventions in particular. Specifically, governments in countries where malaria is endemic are advised to consider ITNs as public-health goods and to help reduce their price by lifting taxes and duties on nets and public-health insecticides. In addition, governments should issue guidelines regarding the importation and safe use of insecticides. Bilateral and multilateral donor agencies are advised to assist national programs with standardized technical advice and, where appropriate, procurement support.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 1 From Research to Implementation\n\nC. Lengeler, D. de Savigny, and J. Cattani\n\nMalaria is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Two billion people, or about 40% of the world's population, live in the 90 countries at risk (WHO 1994) (Figure 1). Global estimates of the malaria disease burden for 1992 indicated at least 300-500 million clinical cases annually, 90% of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, every year, malaria is associated with 1.5-2.7 million deaths, an overwhelming proportion of them in Africa (WHO 1994). In Africa, the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, accounts for about 25% of all childhood mortality below 5 years of age, excluding neonatal mortality (WHO 1994). Recent studies suggest that the percentage might actually be higher (Alonso et al. 1991; Kuate Defo 1995). The World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) rank malaria as the first cause of (disability-adjusted) life-year loss in Africa (World Bank 1993) and calculate an annual loss of 35 million future life-years from disability and premature mortality. Not only is malaria the largest single component of the disease burden in Africa, it is also a growing component as chemotherapy becomes less effective and alternative drugs become more expensive.\n\nA Global Strategy for Malaria Control\n\nIn 1992, WHO convened a Ministerial Conference on Malaria in Amsterdam to define a Global Strategy for Malaria Control and stimulate new efforts to control malaria around the world (see Box 1). The four basic elements of the global strategy were defined as follows:\n\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment;\n\nImplementation of selective, sustainable, preventive measures, including vector control;\n\nEarly detection, containment, and prevention of epidemics; and\n\nFostering regular assessment of affected countries' malaria situation, especially the ecological, social, and economic determinants of the disease, by strengthening local capacities for basic and applied research.\n\nThis book specifically addresses the second element of the Global Strategy. Among preventive measures, one has emerged during the last decade as especially suitable for promotion in a primary health-care (PHC) approach: the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). This approach has the potential to make a substantial difference to malaria control in areas where the disease is endemic, especially in Africa. The present initiative is largely concerned with applied research aspects at the local, national, and international levels and encourages partnership between researchers, implementors, and communities.\n\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment are still the basic elements of malaria control (WHO 1993a). Especially in young children, averting severe illness and death by timely treatment of every clinical episode with the correct dose of an effective drug is a most important way to reduce the burden imposed by malaria. Unfortunately, over the last 20 years, efforts to improve the situation have been hampered in many parts of the world by increasingly drug-resistant malaria parasites and insufficiently developed and financed public-health services. Enhancing integrated approaches to pediatric case management (such as the \"integrated management of the sick child\") must become a high priority for health ministries in countries where malaria is endemic.\n\nPreventive measures, such as modifying the environment and spraying DDT and other insecticides indoors have worked in specific areas, including southern Africa (Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa). Other countries have used these methods to reduce malaria significantly (for example, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil) or to eliminate it (for example, the United States, Italy, Korea, several former Soviet republics, and many Caribbean islands). However, these achievements resulted from large disease-specific control programs and widespread, costly effort. Elimination of malaria has been achieved only in relatively wealthy countries, concurrent with major socioeconomic development. Moreover, transmission has been sustainably reduced only in countries where malaria is hypoendemic to mesoendemic (see Box 2).\n\nFew malaria-prevention programs have been implemented or even considered in areas of Africa where the disease is hyperendemic to holoendemic. In these areas, roughly between latitudes 15°N and 20°S, transmission is intense and stable. Clinical disease and mortality are concentrated in young children; adolescents and adults have acquired enough immunity to survive recurrent infections. The few indoor-spraying programs undertaken since the 1960s were usually restricted to large cities where malaria transmission was low but nuisance biting intense. However, pilot house-spraying projects in Nigeria (Molineaux and Gramiccia 1980) and East Africa (Bradley 1991) demonstrated that such programs can reduce morbidity and mortality significantly.\n\nEffective control programs are rare in areas of highest risk of malaria for economic, structural, and technical reasons. These areas lack the human, financial, and administrative resources required to carry out control programs in the traditional vertical form. As a result, hundreds of millions of people continue to be exposed to malaria (Figure 2) and\n\nthe potential for lower mortality among children under 5 years of age has not been fulfilled.\n\nFor the first time, in ITNs, we have a malaria-prevention method so simple and safe that it can be organized and conducted locally by non-specialists.\n\nInsecticide-Treated Nets\n\nMost ITN trials and programs have used mosquito nets (also called bednets or nets). In some situations, however, nets are not practical, and curtains covering windows, doors, and eaves are preferred (see Chapter 2). For discussion purposes, ITNs and insecticide-treated curtains should be considered synonymous, and we use the term \"nets\" to refer to both. To eliminate the unfounded assumption that a bed is required for correct ITN use, we prefer to say \"net\" rather than \"bednet.\"\n\nTo refer to applying insecticide to nets, authors use the terms \"net impregnation,\" \"net treatment,\" and \"net dipping.\" Although net dipping refers to a specific way of applying insecticide to nets, these terms are essentially equivalent, and we use them interchangeably.\n\nApplying residual insecticide to fabrics to prevent vector-borne diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis began during World War II, when the Soviet, German, and US forces used insecticide-impregnated nets and clothing (Curtis et al. 1991). In the late 1970s, synthetic pyrethroids were found to be effective for this purpose — they are both highly insecticidal and of low toxicity to mammals.\n\nEarly ITN studies demonstrated the safety of pyrethroids and the significant impact of ITNs on various entomological parameters, such as the feeding success of the vector, vectorial capacity, and human-biting rates. These studies also helped define the action mechanism (repelling and killing) and optimal dosages for various combinations of netting and insecticide (see Chapter 2) (also reviewed in Rozendaal 1989; Carnevale et al. 1991; Curtis et al. 1991).\n\nImpact of ITNs on malaria morbidity\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that ITN use substantially affects the frequency and severity of clinical episodes of malaria. More than 20 studies have been done in areas where malaria is endemic, including more than 12 in Africa. A systematic review of the evidence is beyond the scope of this publication, and interested readers should consult Curtis (1992a) and a review by Choi et al. (1995).\n\nThe epidemiologic design of ITN morbidity trials conducted in Africa was suboptimal, and their results should be interpreted cautiously. It is worth noting that most studies document a reduction of 20-63% (median, 45%) in malaria disease rates following introduction of ITNs. The results of standard clinical trials (randomized, controlled, and using sufficiently large samples) that measured impact on malaria disease in Africa are shown in Table 1. Other studies carried out in Mali (Ranque et al. 1984), Burkina Faso (Carnevale et al. 1988; Procacci et al. 1991), Tanzania (Lyimo et al. 1991; Stich et al. 1994), and Zaire (Karch et al. 1993) confirmed these results. Overall, ITNs' ability to reduce the number of disease episodes in communities with stable malaria is no longer questioned.\n\nImpact of ITNs on malaria mortality\n\nGiven the major role of P. falciparum malaria as a direct and indirect cause of death in African children, the main public-health issue associated with ITNs is their effect on child mortality. Assessing the effect of an intervention on mortality requires very large, long-term, and therefore costly trials. In the first randomized, controlled trial of ITNs for mortality, Alonso et al. (1991) reported a 63% reduction in all mortality in children 1-4 years old.\n\nThe dramatic results of this first mortality trial prompted the UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) to collaborate with many agencies to launch four large-scale trials to measure ITNs' effect on overall child mortality in various areas of Africa where malaria is endemic (Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana, and Kenya). The agencies collaborating in this unique multicountry enterprise are listed in Figure 3.\n\nThese carefully randomized, controlled trials, covering a population of nearly 400 000, help define the potential benefits of ITN programs. Results of the three completed trials show a substantial reduction in child mortality, confirming ITN program benefits. An overview of the impact on child mortality is given in Table 2.\n\nIn 1996, the results of the fourth mortality trial (Burkina Faso) will be published. Further trials are planned for Kenya and Tanzania in areas of very high transmission pressure. It must be noted that the reduction in mortality from all causes seen in these trials exceeds the reduction predictable from current understanding of malaria-specific mortality rates. This finding emphasizes the underestimated contribution of malaria to child mortality in Africa (Snow et al. 1995) and the potentially large benefits of malaria-preventive interventions.\n\nFrom Research Trials to Effective, Community-Based Interventions\n\nThe critical path: where are we now?\n\nITNs are now recognized as an efficacious intervention against malaria in all areas of Africa but those with the highest transmission pressure. However, the main lesson from earlier antimalaria efforts is that identifying an efficacious control tool is only one step toward an effective, sustainable malaria-control program (WHO 1993a). Most ITN mortality trials were implemented under strict control and with substantial financial, human, and technical resources — conditions hardly resembling those in which control programs must be delivered and sustained in PHC or other delivery and financing contexts. This raises the issues of feasibility and cost effectiveness of fully implementing ITN programs and of community-level sustainability and equitability over the long term.\n\nThe preceding brief overview of ITN morbidity and mortality trials reveals the growing body of evidence of the efficacy of ITN interventions in reducing overall mortality and malaria-specific disease among children. However, a distinction must be drawn between efficacy, which is determined in research field trials under excellent conditions of targeting, coverage, and compliance, and effectiveness, which, simply put, is the efficacy level achieved by the same intervention under real-life, program-delivery conditions (see Box 3).\n\nHealth researchers, donors, and program implementors often do not distinguish between efficacy and effectiveness. Therefore, they sometimes overestimate the validity of field-trial research results for programs at the national or international level. When randomized, controlled field trials indicate an efficacious new child-survival technology, it is tempting to implement broad-based policy immediately. However, direct transition from field trials to policy and national strategy skips an essential intermediate step in which researchers, program implementors, and donors collaborate in operational studies of more realistic intervention-delivery experiences.\n\nRecently, there have been calls to base health intervention priorities and investments not only on costs or efficacy but also on cost-effectiveness (World Bank 1993). To generate these data, we must move beyond efficacy research to new partnerships for effectiveness research.\n\nThe path from efficacy research to effectiveness research is outlined very simply in Figure 4 (see also Curtis et al. 1991; Lengeler and Snow 1996). Starting in the early 1980s, much research was led by entomologists and focused on the efficacy of ITNs against malaria vectors.\n\nSuccess at this permitted collaborative research between entomologists and malariologists on ITN efficacy for reducing malaria morbidity in the mid-1980s and for reducing child mortality from 1989 onward. In the mid-1990s we had compelling efficacy results for ITNs. Now it is time to move on to operational research on realistic regional-level ITN implementation programs.\n\nIncreasingly, donors and health ministries in countries where malaria is endemic are considering implementing ITN programs as integral components of national malaria-control strategies. However, implementing a large-scale malaria-prevention program based on ITNs is complex because substantial direct, indirect, and opportunity costs are involved, both for implementing agencies and for communities.\n\nITN trials have already produced much information on the managerial, human, and material elements important to successful implementation and use of ITNs. Some aspects have already been reviewed by Carnevale and Coosemans (1995). The second mortality trial conducted in The Gambia (d'Alessandro et al. 1995), which was actually more an effectiveness trial than an efficacy trial, also produced compelling data on cost effectiveness — it indicated that the cost for each death averted was $6001 (Aikins 1995). Furthermore, several nonresearch ITN programs now running in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are producing much relevant operational experience in implementation, financing, and sustainability. Some of this evidence is published, but most is \"gray\" literature and therefore not widely available (Lengeler et al. 1996). Moreover, much of this experience has never been recorded formally. It is,\n\ntherefore, important to disseminate this information and identify knowledge gaps. Much experience from more routine and realistic ITN programs must still be collected to optimize this malaria-control approach. Also, novel approaches to financing ITN programs, impregnating nets, and distributing ITNs have yet to be explored.\n\nWhere do we need to go?\n\nTDR and IDRC are both convinced that the efficacy-research effort must be followed up with a comparable operational-research effort. This research would inform implementing agencies about the best options for implementing sustainable ITN programs. It should certainly be done as much as possible by collaborating researchers and implementing agencies (governmental, nongovernmental, and private-sector). Researchers, implementors, and donors should all benefit from this collaboration. At this stage of development, researchers must focus increasingly on the requirements of implementors, who may need support for increased monitoring and for testing new implementation approaches. Similarily, we hope that this initiative will encourage ITN implementors to undertake more systematic operational research on their programs.\n\nThe current initiative is a TDR-IDRC joint venture. Its general objective is to develop and promote a strategic agenda for operational research on ITNs to make them as cost effective and sustainable as possible in routine conditions.\n\nBoth TDR and IDRC will use this agenda to guide their support for malaria-control research efforts. Implementing agencies are encouraged to contribute to the agenda and to include operational research in their own programs.\n\nThe Canadian International Development Agency and IDRC already support related research in Africa designed to\n\nTest various community-level models of ITN delivery and financing;\n\nExplore the local potential for net manufacture;\n\nDescribe markets for nets in countries where malaria is endemic;\n\nReview legislative changes, especially in taxation, most likely to improve access to nets and insecticide (PATH 1995); and\n\nMap malaria transmission risks pertinent to ITN program strategies.\n\nHow do we get there?\n\nThe TDR-IDRC initiative has three stages: comprehensive reviews of operational aspects of ITNs; an international workshop to look at specific research issues; and, finally, support of research proposals.\n\nReview of operational aspects of ITNs\n\nMost data on the operational aspects of ITNs are either unpublished or not widely available. Therefore, the first stage was to undertake comprehensive reviews of available information. The reviews addressed the following ITN issues:\n\nIntervention technology;\n\nIntervention implementation; and\n\nIntervention promotion.\n\nIn addition to the reviews, topics are outlined for further applications and research. Discussion at the international workshop was based on the reviews that produced chapters 2-4 of this book.\n\nInternational workshop\n\nHosted by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the workshop was held 22-25 November 1994. It convened researchers conducting various types of ITN trials and workers involved either in ITN programs or donor agencies (see list of participants in Appendix 2). The two main objectives of this workshop were to\n\nDiscuss, critique, and contribute to the three reviews; and\n\nDraw up an operational-research agenda for ITN interventions.\n\nThe meeting dealt mainly with specific research issues but also considered several more general recommendations for political action. The recommendations are detailed at the end of each review and are summarized in Chapter 5. The workshop acknowledged some confusion on the definition of operational research. Although the difference between operational research and program monitoring is not easy to define (see Box 4), this difficulty was not seen as a problem. The two concepts exist on the same practical continuum — and operational research usually must be done in the context of implementation programs.\n\nEliciting and supporting operational research proposals\n\nThe third stage of the initiative began in mid-1995 with a call for proposals on the identified research priorities (Lengeler et al. 1996). TDR reviewed the first set of proposals in September 1995.\n\nAn initiative to facilitate ITN operational research\n\nIn the following chapters, significant efforts were made to review all available sources on ITN technology, implementation, and promotion. However, it is impossible either to perform a perfect retrospective review or to identify all unexplored issues and options. Some information is unavailable, and no general policy framework exists for ITNs.\n\nFor example, no one has adequately examined the option of distributing ITNs at little or no cost to high-risk groups, such as newborns and pregnant women, through established health-care channels, such as immunization and mother-and-child programs. This approach could not be recommended without careful consideration of cost effectiveness and the specific interests of program managers and donor agencies; no such program currently exists.\n\nEven with such a well-defined intervention, operational research takes many forms and requires a wide range of skills. Both multi-and interdisciplinary in nature, it is highly collaborative. The challenge is great, but so are the rewards. Rarely do we encounter an intervention so efficacious at reducing child mortality in Africa. We must make every effort to make this promise a reality.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 2 The Technical Issues\n\nJ.D. Lines\n\nMost people are familiar with the two elements of an insecticide-treated net (ITN). The idea of using a bednet is not new in the tropics, even in places where nets themselves are uncommon. Insecticides are also widely familiar, in one form or another. Agricultural chemicals are used in farming communities, mosquito coils are sold even in remote towns, and traditional plant products are used in many rural areas. The combination of net and insecticide is less familiar, even though it has a long history (Lindsay and Gibson 1988); for example, nets impregnated with DDT were used during World War II (Harper et al. 1947).\n\nThe use of pyrethroids on nets is new, however, and does have the promise of a new technology. To begin with, it gives outstandingly effective personal protection against nuisance insects. Indeed, users' enthusiasm suggests that this technology might eventually appear in shops beside the aerosol insecticides and mosquito coils. Moreover, the efficacy of pyrethroid-treated nets for malaria control in Africa has been confirmed by careful trials (for reviews, see Curtis 1992a; Choi et al. 1995). At last, we have a method of prevention that is comparable in epidemiological effect with house spraying, yet simple and safe enough for application by nonspecialists. ITNs may therefore permit what was previously impossible: truly effective community-based malaria control in Africa. The technology is so simple and the problem of malaria so severe that ITNs are a highly attractive public-health intervention.\n\nTo realize this promise, however, the technology must first be delivered to users. Public-health planners are now considering the structures and processes required to make treated nets available. Both public health systems and the commercial market could contribute, but it is not yet clear what roles each should take. Different distribution systems may be needed for nets and for insecticide. There are two reasons for this. First, nets are already available in many places, but the insecticide generally is not. Second, a net lasts several years and requires repeated re-treatment with insecticide. There is, therefore, little point in distributing treated nets unless an effective re-treatment system can also be established.\n\nSo far, China is the only country where a system for the routine treatment of large numbers of nets has been going on long enough to prove sustainable (Curtis 1992b; Xu et al. 1994; Cheng et al. 1995). Although the Chinese system is a useful model, it cannot be replicated in places where the primary health-care system is weak and few people have nets. Treated bednet and curtain projects outside China have used a range of approaches, but no consensus on the best strategy has emerged. Many successful technologies have to pass through an initial period of evolution and adaptation before a form eventually emerges that proves useful in a wide variety of circumstances. The technology of pyrethroid-impregnated nets and curtains has evolved little, and it is likely that this process has not yet really begun.\n\nThis review considers the technical aspects of treated nets, focusing on the range of materials available. The choice depends on efficacy, safety, and convenience. This chapter therefore begins by explaining how treated nets work and how efficacy can be compared. Safety and convenience can be judged only in context, so the people and organizations that may be involved are also considered. The chapter then deals with the materials and treatment processes.\n\nMeasures of Entomological Impact\n\nITNs affect mosquitoes in several ways (see Box 5), and this section discusses how to measure these impacts. Most of the useful comparative measures are entomological — many combinations of fabric and insecticide are possible, but only a few can be tested in epidemiological trials.\n\nInsecticide deposit\n\nMeasuring the concentration of insecticide on an ITN is essential for quality control in routine operations. Currently, the only available methods are sophisticated and costly gas chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography tests (Hossain et al. 1989; Lindsay, Hossain et al. 1991). In most trials and pilot projects, only a few samples can be tested, and it is, therefore, impossible to measure patchiness of the deposit within a net or variability between nets. Moreover, test results are not returned\n\nquickly enough to provide feedback for modifying procedures. One most pressing research need, therefore, is a test suitable for use in field laboratories. A simple test of presence or absence is better than nothing, and one such test has already been field tested in The Gambia (Muller et al. 1994). A quantitative test would be much better, and both chemical and serological possibilities are being explored (S.W. Lindsay, personal communication). A pigment added to insecticide to indicate presence and consistency might be helpful, especially if it faded at the same rate as the insecticide decayed.\n\nInsecticidal action\n\nITNs are treated both to prevent mosquitoes from biting and to kill them. Protection against biting can be measured easily by pressing an arm against the fabric or by observing whether mosquitoes pass through holes or gaps (for example, Hossain and Curtis 1989; Jana-Kara et al. 1995).\n\nA bioassay is the only test simple and quick enough for routine use with large numbers of ITNs (Lindsay, Hossain et al. 1991; Miller 1994a) and is the primary tool for comparing different types of net treatment (see Figure 6). A bioassay consists of confining mosquitoes in contact with the insecticide deposit and measuring their mortality. In routine operations, bioassays can be used to monitor treatment quality and, at 1-to 3-month intervals, to monitor the residual activity of the insecticide deposit.\n\nMosquitoes can be confined and exposed in various ways, and the outcome measure may be the median time required for mosquitoes to be knocked down or, more commonly, the proportion dead after a fixed exposure period (Rozendaal 1989; Njunwa et al. 1991). The main problem with current bioassay techniques is the variation that is usually observed between replicate tests. In consequence, many replications are needed to produce reliable results. Standardization of methods for maximizing repeatability is needed.\n\nExperimental-hut trials\n\nEven brief exposure to pyrethroids can change insects' behaviour in ways that affect the degree and pattern of further exposure (see Box 5). This interaction produces complex effects that cannot be measured by simple bioassays. Experimental huts are more realistic: the human bait is asleep, and the mosquitoes are free to enter, attempt to feed, and leave the hut. Special modifications to the hut (Smith and Webley 1969; Curtis et al. 1992) allow accurate sampling of mosquitoes that are driven outside, as well as those that are killed — this is impossible in ordinary rooms. In this way, several effects can be distinguished.\n\nDeterrency: Fewer mosquitoes enter the room. Pyrethroids are contact insecticides with a very low vapour pressure, so it is surprising that mosquitoes are affected at all before they enter the room. With ITNs treated less than 6 weeks previously, the vapour from the solvent itself may be deterrent (Lindsay, Adiamah 1991), but an airborne effect from the pyrethroid is also evident (Somboon 1993). Smith and Webley (1969) worked with experimental huts sprayed with DDT, which also has a very low vapour pressure, and demonstrated similar airborne effects from insecticide-contaminated dust.\n\nFeeding inhibition: Of the mosquitoes that enter the room, fewer feed, which is particularly noticeable with ITNs with holes.\n\nMortality: A proportion of female mosquitoes are killed by the insecticide, either before or after feeding.\n\nRepellency: Mosquitoes that would have stayed in the room to rest are stimulated to leave.\n\nTreated curtains and nets that are large in relation to the room protect against biting mainly by deterring mosquitoes from entering the room. Smaller ITNs protect mostly by killing mosquitoes that have already entered the room or by driving them outside before they feed (Lines et al. 1987; Curtis et al. 1992).\n\nExperimental-hut trials confirm bioassay measures of the duration of the residual efficacy of treated bednets, typically giving figures of 6 months (without washing) for permethrin at 200-500 mg/m2 (Figure 5) and 12 months for lambdacyhalothrin and deltamethrin at 10-25 mg/m2(Lines et al. 1987; Curtis et al. 1991; Curtis 1992a; Curtis et al. 1994).\n\nMost experimental-hut trials of ITNs were performed in Africa with Anopheles gambiae s.l. Satisfactory methods have yet to be developed for measuring how well ITNs protect someone sleeping outside or in a house with incomplete walls, such as are found in Latin America and Southeast Asia.\n\nExperimental-hut trials measure feeding inhibition and killing at the individual level. They cannot indicate whether female mosquitoes driven outdoors feed elsewhere (for example, on unprotected people) or, if so, whether host choice is affected. Neither can the trials predict whether the proportion of mosquitoes killed would, with large-scale ITN use, amount to a mass effect on the local mosquito population (see Box 5). The balance between these two opposite effects (diversion and mass killing) determines whether the use of ITNs by some people is detrimental or beneficial to other people in the same community who do not have nets.\n\nMass effects\n\nWhen ITNs are used consistently over a wide enough area against an anthropophilic vector (one that prefers to feed on human hosts), female mosquitoes risk death whenever they try to feed. In these circumstances, the density of the local mosquito population may drop, as may the parous rate and the sporozoite rate. Such effects were seen in village-scale ITN trials in Burkina Faso (Robert and Carnevale 1991), Tanzania (Magesa et al. 1991), Kenya (Beach et al. 1993), and Zaire (Karch et al. 1993). In Tanzania, the effects on density and sporozoite rate reduced the rate of infectious biting of unprotected people by more than 90%. Detailed age-grading of mosquitoes showed that this was due to reduced survival (Magesa et al. 1991), presumably because of mosquito mortality. ITNs are unlikely to be repellent enough to drive mosquitoes from treated to untreated villages.\n\nIn the early village-scale trials in The Gambia, it was not clear whether or not there was a mass effect as well as improved personal protection. The effect on biting rates at the community level was estimated by catching and counting fed female mosquitoes in indoor-resting catches and in exit traps. Fewer fed female mosquitoes were collected in this way in untreated rooms in untreated villages than in treated rooms in treated villages (Snow, Lindsay et al. 1988; Lindsay, Snow, Broomfield et al. 1989). With a repellent treatment, however, the exophily induced in fed female mosquitoes can bias such estimates. This bias exists because exit traps catch a smaller fraction of the mosquitoes that leave a room than spray catches of those that stay.\n\nIn a later trial, sampling in treated villages was done in \"sentinel\" rooms without ITNs; no difference was observed between treated and untreated villages in the number of fed female mosquitoes collected in such rooms. Parous rates and sporozoite rates were also similar (Lindsay, Snow, Broomfield et al. 1989; Lindsay et al. 1993; M. Quinones and J. Lines, unpublished); in other words, there was no mass effect in The Gambia.\n\nThus, because of the repellency effect on fed female mosquitoes, indoor-resting catches in rooms with ITNs (for example, Jaenson et al. 1994) probably exaggerate the effect of ITNs on the village-level infective biting rate. It is not yet clear whether light-trap catches in rooms with ITNs are similarly biased. In general, when testing for a mass effect, sentinel sampling stations without ITNs are preferable in treated villages.\n\nThe vector species does not seem to be the reason why a mass effect has been seen in some African trials but not in others: An. gambiae s.s. is the main vector in both The Gambia and Tanzania. ITNs might kill fewer mosquitoes in The Gambia because of differences in fabric and treatment methods (Nagle 1994). Killing effects could also be masked in The Gambia by movement of mosquitoes between treated and untreated villages (M.C. Thomson and M. Quinones, personal communication).\n\nOutside Africa, clear evidence of a mass effect with An. minimus was reported from Assam, India (Jana-Kara et al. 1995), but not from Thailand (Somboon 1993). The difference between these two cases seems to be related to mosquito behaviour: in Assam, An. minimus is still endophilic and anthropophilic, but it is now zoophilic and exophilic in Thailand (Ismail et al. 1978). Weaker evidence of a mass effect with An. farauti was reported from the Solomon Islands (Hii et al. 1993; Kere et al. 1993).\n\nThe possibility of a mass effect should be considered when planning the scale and coverage of ITN projects, because the community can benefit extensively. However, mass effects are improbable with zoophilic species and uncertain even with anthropophilic ones. Moreover, a mass effect is likely only if ITN use is almost universal in an area — and it is not even certain how large the area must be. Concerted community-wide ITN use may be more difficult to achieve than a gradual, household-by-household increase in coverage. Mass effects should, therefore, be regarded as an important additional benefit of a high rate of coverage and not as a factor that should be allowed to constrain other, more efficient distribution systems.\n\nDiversion\n\nWhen hungry mosquitoes are prevented by a net from feeding on one person, do they succeed in feeding on another host? How long does exposure to the insecticide continue to hamper a mosquito's subsequent efforts to obtain a blood meal? Like mass effects, diversion is relevant to distribution. If ITNs merely alter the bite distribution and do not reduce the number of bites, then ITN users may be protected only at others' expense.\n\nThere is little doubt that untreated nets divert mosquitoes to other hosts nearby. In Tanzania, Lines et al. (1987) estimated the amount of biting on two children sleeping in an experimental hut in three conditions: when a net was used by neither child, by one child, and by both children. When one child slept under an untreated net, the other received more bites. With the net treated with permethrin, however, the opposite effect was observed: the child without a net was bitten less than when both were unprotected.\n\nAre mosquitoes diverted from treated to untreated houses? Lindsay et al. (1992) measured mosquito entry into six experimental huts: five occupied by sleepers with untreated nets and one occupied by a sleeper with an ITN. The rate of entry into the untreated huts was not affected by proximity to the ITN. This finding suggests that diverted mosquitoes do not concentrate in nearby houses but does not rule out the possibility that they disperse and then resume searching for a blood meal.\n\nVillage-scale studies in Papua New Guinea (Charlwood and Graves 1987) showed that ITNs can divert mosquitoes from humans to animals. After ITNs were introduced, the proportion of blood meals taken from animals increased and the proportion of blood meals taken from people decreased. Diversion to animals clearly benefits humans, but mosquitoes would presumably be diverted to other humans if fewer animal hosts were available and ITN coverage was incomplete. However, village-scale trials in Africa found no evidence of a decrease in the human blood index either in small samples of outdoor-resting female mosquitoes in Tanzania (Magesa et al. 1991) or among indoor-resting female mosquitoes in The Gambia (Lindsay et al. 1993; M. Quinones and J. Lines, unpublished).\n\nWhen most people in a village begin using ITNs, the balance between the opposing effects of diversion and killing can be measured directly by counting the number of mosquitoes attempting to feed on unprotected humans outdoors or in rooms without ITNs. Biting rates have either declined or remained unchanged (Magesa et al. 1991; Robert and Carnevale 1991; Beach et al. 1993; Karch et al. 1993; Lindsay et al. 1993; Somboon 1993; Jana-Kara et al. 1995; M. Quinones and J. Lines, unpublished). Overall, the evidence suggests that acquisition of an ITN by one person tends to be either marginally beneficial or neutral to others — as long as the ITN remains treated.\n\nEffects on the biting cycle\n\nTwo studies have reported effects on mosquitoes' daily biting cycle. In Papua New Guinea, Charlwood and Graves (1987) observed that when ITNs were introduced into a village, biting by An.farauti peaked earlier in the night (and the gonotrophic (oviposition) cycle lasted longer). Njau et al. (1993) observed a similar change in Tanzania when a village was divided into four groups of houses, three of which were provided with either untreated nets or ITNs treated with lambdacyhalothrin or deltamethrin. Biting peaked earlier in houses with ITNs but not in houses with untreated nets. In either case, such prompt effects are presumably temporary and phenotypic and must be contrasted with the permanent evolutionary changes in the biting cycle of the Solomon Islands mosquitoes of the An. punctulatus complex apparently caused by spraying DDT (Sloof 1964). Other trials, such as those in The Gambia (M. Quinones and J. Lines, unpublished) and Sierra Leone (E. Magbity and J. Lines, unpublished), have reported no biting-cycle changes.\n\nThe peak biting time of the local vector might be expected to be an important determinant of ITN effectiveness: ITNs are more likely to affect late biters than early biters. However, in Guatemala (Richards et al. 1993) and China (Li et al. 1989; Curtis 1992b; Cheng et al. 1995), where the main vector species are both early biters, malaria has been successfully controlled by ITNs. Further examples can be expected from trials in India, where the biting time of An. culicifacies s.l. varies geographically and between sibling species (T. Adak and V.P Sharma, personal communication).\n\nResistance to pyrethroids\n\nResistance must be regarded as an unavoidable threat whenever an insecticide is used widely, intensely, and for extended periods. Unfortunately, pyrethroids are probably the only insecticides suitable for use on ITNs. Some argue that, as a public-health tool, pyrethroid ITNs are doomed from the start. The same can be said of any antibiotic or antimalarial drug, but no one would suggest that eventual resistance is a good reason not to use new drugs. There are equity implications, however. Genes for insecticide susceptibility in mosquito populations can be regarded as a finite resource that could be exhausted by people with easy access to ITNs before less-privileged people can benefit.\n\nIn some insects, for example, the day-biting mosquito Aedes aegypti, the commonest form of DDT resistance confers cross-resistance to pyrethroids. Fortunately, the same is apparently not true of Anopheles: all DDT resistance characterized so far in malaria vectors is caused by specific DDT-detoxification mechanisms. Pyrethroids have been widely used in agriculture, and there have been several reports of this causing resistance in various Anopheles species (Lines 1988; Roberts and Andre 1994; Kroeger et al. 1995). Such reports, however, are generally not well substantiated (Malcolm 1988); for example, they often lack evidence that the observed resistance is heritable.\n\nField-selected pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles has been well studied in only one case — that of An. stephensi in Dubai (Laddoni et al. 1990; Sivananthan et al. 1992). The resistance arose after pyrethroids were used as larvicides, but in the laboratory it also protects adult mosquitoes against ITNs (Curtis et al. 1993).\n\nITNs have been widely used over a long period only in parts of China, notably Sichuan, where neither resistance nor control failure have appeared (Curtis 1992b; Cheng et al. 1995). However, a moderate (2.5-fold) decrease in susceptibility to permethrin was reported from a local ITN trial in Kenya (Vulule et al. 1994). The significance of this decrease remains unclear. The data may indicate either a homogeneous increase in tolerance or the presence of a small proportion of highly resistant individuals. The latter would be more ominous, as it would suggest scope for further evolution.\n\nConfirmed cases of pyrethroid resistance remain extremely rare in Anopheles species. To preserve susceptibility, selection for resistance should be minimized. Unfortunately, the only clear priorities for resistance management relate to research, not implementation (Taylor and Georghiou 1979; Curtis 1987; Tabashnik 1990; Curtis et al. 1993). So far, resistance arguments do not justify the adoption of any specific product or range of products or the use of different products in rotation or mosaic. The most pressing research need is to find nonpyrethroid insecticides suitable for ITNs. Even products that sterilize female mosquitoes rather than killing them could still be useful in mixures with pyrethroids (Curtis et al. 1993; Miller 1994b).\n\nResistance monitoring is important whenever insecticides are used on a large scale. Magesa et al. (1994) have assessed methods that use the World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility-testing kit to detect pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes.\n\nAfter a treatment session, people should be asked for reports of insecticidal activity; absence of effect against mosquitoes or other nuisance insects might be the first sign of resistance. It could also indicate that the treatment was not done correctly — equally valuable information. However, user's reports should not be regarded as an adequate substitute for essential monitoring of resistance and operational quality control.\n\nEffects on nuisance arthropods\n\nPeople use nets mostly to protect themselves from nuisance biting; protection from disease is secondary (Zandu et al. 1991; Aikins et al. 1993; Stephens et al. 1995) (also see Chapter 4). ITNs seem less lethal to Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes than Anopheles species, although they are fairly effective at preventing C. quinquefasciatus from biting (Curtis et al. 1991; Magesa et al. 1991; Curtis et al. 1994). This property would be especially important in urban areas, where C. quinquefasciatus is responsible for most nuisance biting. Failure to reduce the perceived nuisance of mosquito biting would probably jeopardize any urban ITN program.\n\nSeasonal changes in nuisance biting can affect ITN use. In Bagamoyo, Tanzania, for example, the proportion of people using ITNs declined at the beginning of the dry season, when mosquito density was low but sporozoite rates (and hence infection risk) remained high (J.N. Minjas, personal communications).\n\nUsers often appreciate the effect pyrethroid-impregnated nets have on other arthropod pests, such as bedbugs, chicken ticks, headlice, and cockroaches (Charlwood and Dagoro 1989; Lindsay, Snow, Armstrong et al. 1989) as much as they do the effect on mosquitoes (Njunwa et al. 1991).\n\nNets, Curtains, and Other Fabrics\n\nNet design\n\nBoth conical and rectangular nets are common in many places. Conical nets are easier to hang and fold up. Ease of use is particularly important in small rooms where the beds are used as seats or tables during the day. Rectangular nets, on the other hand, can hang from string as well as from frames and are more spacious inside. This presumably reduces the chance of lying against the netting, especially when there are several occupants.\n\nMore important for net treatment is whether the bottom border or top of the net is made of heavier, more absorbent material. A sheeting border prevents snagging and tearing when the net is tucked under the mattress, and at the top of a conical net, sheeting reinforces the weight-bearing apex. Unfortunately, sheeting tends to absorb much more liquid than netting, especially if the sheeting is cotton and the netting synthetic. When a reinforced net is dipped, therefore, a large and usually unknown fraction of the insecticide is taken up by sheeting tops and borders, where it is presumably much less effective. Testing of ITNs in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, suggests that, on average, more than half the insecticide used to treat them was wasted in this way (J.E. Miller and J. Lines, unpublished). Therefore, it is also more difficult to calculate the dilution needed to achieve a specific dosage of insecticide on the netting.\n\nThese problems can be minimized by making nets with detachable borders and tops or by making narrow borders of relatively nonabsorbent synthetic fabric. These problems can be avoided altogether by giving up the advantages of dipping and spraying the net instead. Another potential solution, which seems as yet untried, is binding the border with plastic and string, as in tie-dyeing. Net designs and preference issues are discussed further in Chapter 3.\n\nNetting material\n\nThe fabrics most commonly used for ITNs are cotton, cotton-synthetic blends, nylon, polyester, polyethylene, and polypropylene. These materials vary widely in their capacity to absorb dilute insecticide emulsion. It is not difficult to achieve a specific dosage if the amount of liquid the net will take is known; the insecticide can be diluted accordingly. However, it is a problem when different fabrics must be dipped together.\n\nCotton absorbs more emulsion than do synthetics. With permethrin, this difference may not matter: permethrin is less insecticidal on cotton than on synthetic fibre (Miller 1994a; Elissa and Curtis 1995). Therefore, the same dilution can be used for both cotton and nylon nets because, although the cotton will absorb more permethrin, it needs more to achieve the same effect. In Tanzania, a final dilution of about 1.0% permethrin proved suitable. A similar difference between cotton and nylon or polyester has also been seen with lambdacyhalothrin and alphamethrin but not with deltamethrin (Figure 6) (Luo et al. 1994; Miller 1994a; Elissa and Curtis 1995).\n\nThe interaction between insecticide and fabric is complex and difficult to predict. Bioassays and experimental-hut studies have only begun to explore combinations of fabric, compound, and dosage. Other aspects, such as weight and type of weave, await consideration. Moreover, comparisons of the insecticidal power of freshly treated fabrics may be\n\nmisleading. For example, immediately ater treatment, a given concentration of insecticide is as active on polyethylene as it is on nylon or polyester, but on polyethylene this activity fades more rapidly with time and with washing (Curtis et al. 1994). Anecdotal evidence suggests that deltamethrin on polyethylene or polypropylene has more severe side effects than on other materials (C.F. Curtis, personal communication). Clearly, more information is needed, and research must accelerate if we are to keep up with new compounds and formulations.\n\nThe dipping process is also influenced by how thoroughly a fabric can be wrung. Light, flexible polyester and nylon nets can be wrung thoroughly after dipping so that very little emulsion drips out as the ITN dries. Cotton tends to drip even after thorough wringing and loses more insecticide. Polyethylene and polypropylene nets tend to be made of thick, rather stiff fibres and are difficult to wring at all. To save insecticide, freshly dipped ITNs can be allowed to drip onto plastic sheeting from which excess insecticide is collected for reuse (S.R. Meek, personal communication). Most of the excess drips out of a polyester ITN in a few minutes, but it can take much longer with a cotton one.\n\nDurability is one of the most important determinants of the cost of nets, and a strong net is a more attractive purchase than a fragile one. Durability is measured in \"denier,\" a scale of load-bearing strength; a 40-denier net is too flimsy, whereas 100-denier nets cost little more and are much sturdier. Stronger, more expensive nets are cheaper in the long run (in terms of dollars per year of effective life). This is discussed further in Chapter 3.\n\nFibre with incorporated insecticide\n\nTechniques for improving the wash resistance of insecticide treatment have kindled some interest. Lindsay, Hossain et al. (1991) showed that a hot-acid treatment, which can be carried out at the factory, increased insecticide uptake and improved wash resistance. Techniques to incorporate the insecticide in the net fibre as it is produced are even more promising. Experimental-hut trials show that the initial insecticidal activity of Olyset™, a ready-made ITN manufactured by Sumitomo Corp., is similar to that of an ITN treated conventionally with the same dosage. The manufacturer's claims for greatly improved wash and wear resistance are currently being evaluated, and the early results are encouraging (C.F. Curtis, personal communication).\n\nUnconventional bednets\n\nAn untreated net needs to be impenetrable to mosquitoes, but even nets with very wide mesh protect well after pyrethroid treatment. In Tanzania, ribbons of polypropylene made by stripping the warp from the weft of fertilizer sacks are used for treated bed curtains. Very incomplete as a physical barrier, these treated bed curtains protect well against biting, though not as well as treated nets (Curtis et al. 1994)\n\nNets versus curtains\n\nImpregnated curtains over eaves, windows, and doors protect everyone in the room and may therefore be valuable in the evening before bedtime. In some places, such as Burkina Faso, they are a more practical alternative to nets because houses are very small or otherwise unsuitable for individual bednets (Pietra et al. 1991; Procacci et al. 1991). However, trials with pyrethroid-treated curtains show that they protect less well than similarly treated nets (Lines et al. 1987; Curtis et al. 1992; Beach et al. 1993). Recently, more encouraging results were achieved with curtains treated with the carbamate bendiocarb (Curtis et al. 1994).\n\nThe perfect ITN material for curtaining doors and windows has yet to be found. Conventional 100-denier netting proved unsuitable in Burkina Faso, where it tended to lose its shape and curl after 1 year of use. Investigators also reported that rodents eat eaves curtains (A. Habluetzel, personal communication).\n\nPyrethroid-treated wall curtains have been tried in Kenya. Called Mbu cloth, these consist of 9 m of sheeting affixed to the walls rather than the eaves or windows. Village-scale trials have been entomologically and epidemiologically inconclusive (Mutinga et al. 1992; Mutinga et al. 1993).\n\nInsecticides\n\nSynthetic pyrethroids were originally developed to mimic the insecticidal compounds in pyrethrum because natural pyrethrum is too unstable to use as a residual insecticide. Synthetic pyrethroids have several advantages for ITN use: they have excito-repellent properties and are quick acting and effective in the small quantities that will adhere to fabric.\n\nSafety\n\nIn considering the safety of synthetic chemicals, three main kinds of short-and long-term hazard can be distinguished: to people, to nontarget organisms, and to the environment. Synthetic chemicals can present short-or long-term hazards to both humans and other nontarget organisms and to the environment. Anyone involved in ITN treatment and distribution should read the Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) booklets published by WHO (1990 a, b, c), which discuss these risks. WHO'S guardedly optimistic approach to pyrethroids contrasts strongly with its alarming statements about organophosphate and carbamate insecticides (WHO 1986 a, b). Some of the more significant remarks about permethrin are reproduced in Table 3. The other booklets contain similar comments about lambdacyhalothrin and deltamethrin.\n\nPyrethroids have no tendency for bioaccumulation — in contrast to DDT, for example — and break down rapidly both in mammalian tissues and in the soil. Their toxicity for fish and other aquatic organisms, however, has important consequences for waste disposal. Pit latrines, in which pyrethroids degrade quickly, are recommended for this purpose.\n\nFor people, the rapid breakdown in tissue means that the main hazards of pyrethroids are related to acute rather than chronic exposure. For example, if all the insecticide on an ITN were absorbed completely\n\nthrough a person's skin over 6 months, the amount absorbed would approach the estimated acceptable daily intake, which is 0.05 mg/kg for permethrin and a little less for deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin (Plestina 1989).\n\nInsecticide hazards vary by formulation and mode of exposure. Formulation is important because the solvent itself may be harmful (see \"Formulations,\" pp. 37-38). On contact with skin, some pyrethroids produce characteristic sensations (see \"Side Effects,\" pp. 36-37).\n\nWe must also consider oral toxicity because insecticide packaged and sold for home ITN treatment could be swallowed by a child. Table 4 compares the amounts that might be sold in this way, using current standard doses, with LD50 values quoted in EHC booklets. The contents of a single sachet of an EC (emulsifiable concentrate) formulation comes uncomfortably close to the LD50 for rats. (LD50 is the amount required in a single dose to kill 50%, on average, of a group of test animals.) Although data on rats cannot be extrapolated reliably to humans and the insecticide usually has a strongly emetic effect, the figures suggest that a 10-kg child (about 1 year old) who swallowed an entire sachet could be seriously poisoned.\n\nThis risk seems to be the gravest of those attached to a commercial market in net treatment. By contrast, the LD50 of each of the two water-based formulations (lambdacyhalothrin CS (microencapsulated) and deltamethrin flowable) is much greater, and the risk of serious poisoning, therefore, seems extremely remote.\n\nThese warnings are offset by the fact that permethrin and deltamethrin have been in agricultural use for many years (deltamethrin was first marketed in 1977). In that time, they have acquired an excellent reputation for safety.\n\nHe et al. (1989) reviewed 573 cases of acute pyrethroid poisoning in the Chinese medical literature. There were seven deaths, of which five were attributable directly to the pyrethroid rather than to any other chemical exposure or subsequent treatment. The vast majority of patients recovered within 6 days, and no residual symptoms were found. These cases mostly arose from occupational or accidental exposure to agricultural formulations, typically over a period of several days, and included some cases of attempted suicide. On the basis of the descriptions of four \"illustrative cases,\" comparable degrees of occupational exposure could perhaps be anticipated in people who dip nets for a living, all day and every day, but would not normally be expected among people who are exposed occasionally to limited doses as they dip their own nets at home. Further discussion, specifically related to the use of cyfluthrin on nets, can be found in Bomann (1996).\n\nPyrethroids are already widely used in homes. For example, aerosol insecticides often contain a mixture of residual and nonresidual pyrethroids, typically amounting to 2.5 g in a large can. Permethrin is also used in lotions and shampoos for treating scabies and lice. Alpha-cyano compounds are considered less suitable for this purpose (Taplin and Meiking 1990). In 1995, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was preparing guideline specifications for domestic pesticides for publication. The WHO (1991) comments on the requirements for registering pesticides for domestic use are reproduced in Box 6.\n\nWHO frequently reiterates its approval of pyrethroids in general and of permethrin in particular for ITN treatment (WHO 1991). To date, however, WHO has not commented on safe insecticide-treatment practices. It should be asked to do so, particularly with respect to commercial products for home ITN treatment.\n\nSide effects\n\nSome solvents used in insecticide formulations have unpleasant effects. People who inhale solvent vapour for prolonged periods during dipping operations often suffer nonspecific, transient symptoms of mild intoxication, such as headaches. These effects can be avoided by dipping nets outdoors and by mixing the insecticide in a shallow basin rather than a deep bucket (Snow, Phillips et al. 1988).\n\nField reports of side effects from insecticide must distinguish permethrin from lambdacyhalothrin and deltamethrin. Permethrin has given rise to remarkably few reports of adverse side effects among ITN users or people involved in dipping. For example, Snow et al. (1987) asked the users of ITNs treated with permethrin or a placebo about nine different side effects, including headache, dizziness, coughing, sore eyes, and itching. The two groups differed only in that the placebo group complained more of sweating. In addition, one or two reports have referred to apparent allergic reactions, such as asthma and dermal sensitivity, on exposure during dipping (C. Reed and C.G. Nevill, personal communication). Such reactions seem remarkably rare, however.\n\nExposure of pyrethroids to skin, especially mucous membranes, can cause transient tingling and burning sensations known as paresthesia. These symptoms are caused by temporary effects on sensory nerves, and no long-term adverse effects have been reported (WHO 1990 b, c). Toxicologically, paraesthesia is regarded as having little significance beyond immediate discomfort; indeed, it is useful because it warns of exposure (WHO 1990c). Reports of paraesthesia from ITN treatment projects using permethrin are extremely rare, but it is commonly reported by people using alpha-cyano pyrethroids such as deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin (for example, Njunwa et al. 1991).\n\nTwo other effects have been reported with these compounds. First, the emulsion causes a painful irritation if splashed into the eye, and droplets of the concentrate produce a tingling sensation on contact with skin (Somboon 1993). Facial swelling has also been reported (Njunwa et al. 1991), possibly in connection with handling freshly dipped and dried ITNs, rather than with dipping itself. Second, people sleeping under freshly treated ITNs frequently report nasal irritation and sneezing lasting from a few days to 2 weeks after the ITN is first used.\n\nThese side effects have several operational consequences. In one trial in northwest Thailand, villagers cited such symptoms as one reason for washing their nets soon after treatment with lambdacyhalothrin (Somboon 1993). In China, where deltamethrin is routinely used on millions of nets, such symptoms are rarely reported. In Tanzania, villagers sleeping under lambdacyhalothrin-treated nets noted nasal irritation (Njunwa et al. 1991) but stressed that they preferred it to the mosquitoes. Finally, in India, villagers reported skin tingling as a positive sign of the presence and strength of the deltamethrin used to treat their nets (Jana-Kara et al. 1995).\n\nSevere or fatal illness soon after the introduction of ITNs is rarely reported. These stories are usually anecdotal and difficult or impossible to investigate properly. Before they come to official attention, they circulate as rumours, causing anxiety that hinders treatment operations (W. Fischer and Z. Premji, personal communication). It is unlikely that exposure to the insecticide deposit on an ITN could cause severe illness, and it must, therefore, be stressed that the insecticide was almost certainly not to blame in such cases. Our assertions of safety, however, can hardly be confident and convincing if we ignore exceptional cases. Little information on the side effects of ITNs exists, and a clearing house for this kind of information is urgently needed.\n\nFormulations\n\nEmulsifiable concentrates (ECs) are the pyrethroid formulations most commonly used for ITNs. They are easy to recognize because they are clear, often yellowish, liquid concentrates that turn milky when mixed with water. ECs contain solvents that are important not only because they can be toxic but also because they help the pyrethroid penetrate the skin. For this reason, formulations with a high insecticide content and less solvent per unit of volume, such as permethrin 55%, should not necessarily be regarded as more toxic than formulations with less insecticide and more solvent. The solvent often gives freshly treated ITNs a characteristic odour (the insecticide itself is odourless), and although this odour disappears rapidly when the ITN is used, it can influence acceptability and perceptions of safety (Evans 1994).\n\nMany manufacturers make different EC formulations for public-health and for agricultural use. Sometimes, the only important difference is the label, but sometimes the agricultural product contains more hazardous solvents. The national program in The Gambia rejected a whole batch of agricultural permethrin because it was not suitable for ITNs (M.K. Cham, personal communication). It is, therefore, important to order ECs formulated specifically for public-health applications.\n\nWettable powder (WP) formulations, normally used for spraying hard surfaces, are not generally suitable for ITNs. ITNs treated with permethrin WP lose their insecticidal effect within a few weeks (Miller 1990), probably because the powder simply falls off. Deltamethrin, on the other hand, seems about as effective in WP formulations as in EC formulations (Jana-Kara et al. 1994; Elissa and Curtis 1995; Jana-Kara et al. 1995).\n\nSome formulations have solvents and insecticide suspended as an emulsion in water (for example the microencapsulated (CS) and the emulsion oil-in-water (EW)). These reduce skin absorbency somewhat and oral toxicity significantly (see Table 4), making them preferable for domestic use. Water-based formulations are available, in one form or another, for most pyrethroids used on ITNs — although, unfortunately, not for permethrin. Water-based formulations seem as effective for ITNs as equivalent ECs (for example, Elissa and Curtis 1995), but it is not yet clear whether they help to reduce paraesthesia.\n\nOne clear need is a formulation that is easy to use in small quantities — for example, a solid, divisible block that dissolves or disperses in water. Washing is a major influence on the residual effect of an insecticide deposit, and a \"wash-proof\" permethrin formulation has been investigated. So far, only marginal improvements have been achieved (Miller 1994a; Miller et al. 1995).\n\nChoosing the right insecticides\n\nPermethrin\n\nPermethrin, one of the first synthetic pyrethroids with stable residual activity (WHO 1990a), was the first pyrethroid specifically recommended by WHO for ITN use. Permethrin is normally used at 200-500 mg/m2on nets, although higher doses have been used on curtains. At 200-500 mg/m2, bioassays and experimental-hut studies indicate that re-treatment is required every 6 months if the net is not washed (Curtis et al. 1994). Washing removes about half the permethrin and rather more than half of the insecticidal activity (Hossain and Curtis 1989; Lindsay, Adiamah et al. 1991) (the consequences of this are discussed in \"Packing, Dosage, and Re-treatment,\" pp. 42-45).\n\nLittle is known of other external factors determining the residual activity of the insecticide deposit on an ITN. The deposit seems to be affected remarkably little by soot and dirt but is reduced by handling (Curtis et al. 1991). Permethrin is more insecticidal on synthetic fabrics than on cotton (see \"Netting Material,\" pp. 28-30).\n\nExperimental-hut comparisons have repeatedly shown that with synthetic fabric, increasing the dose beyond 200 mg/m2 does not significantly improve either immediate insecticidal activity or residual activity (see Figure 5) (Curtis et al. 1994). Also, higher doses cost more (see Chapter 3). However, given the variability in doses actually achieved in routine dipping operations (see \"Target Doses and Observed Doses,\" in this chapter, pp. 50-52), a safety margin in the target dose is desirable.\n\nPermethrin exists as two isomers, cis and trans. The cis form is more insecticidal but also more toxic to mammals (WHO 1990a). Formulations are available containing cis-trans isomer ratios of either 40 : 60 or 25 : 75. One manufacturer's suggestion that the latter formulation is preferable for public-health purposes does not seem justified. WHO (1990a), made no distinction between the two isomer ratios in its acceptable daily intake recommendation, and no major performance differences have emerged from experimental-hut trials (see Figure 5) (Pleass et al. 1993). In any case, the difference in cis isomer content is marginal compared with the large variations in the amounts applied per net in routine operations (Alonso, Lindsay, Armstrong-Schellenberg, Konteh et al. 1993).\n\nDeltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin, and other alpha-cyano compounds\n\nDeltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin belong to the subgroup of pyrethroids characterized by an alpha-cyano group in the molecular structure (WHO 1990 b, c, d). These compounds are more toxic to mammals than permethrin, but their much greater toxicity to insects compensates for this (WHO 1990b). Therefore, remarkably little is needed on an ITN: 10-25 mg/m2. Perhaps because small quantities adhere better to the substrate, the residual activity of nets treated with deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin can persist for 1 year, even with one or two washings (Njunwa et al. 1991; Curtis et al. 1992; Miller 1994a). This is a major advantage, especially in places where the malaria-transmission season lasts for more than 6 months a year. Some alpha-cyano compounds are, like permethrin, more effective on synthetics than on cotton (see \"Netting Material,\" pp. 28-30; also see Figure 6).\n\nAlpha-cyano pyrethroids are cheaper per individual treatment than permethrin (see Chapter 3). Their main disadvantage is that, on contact with skin, they can cause sensory side effects (see \"Side Effects,\" pp. 36-37). Currently, therefore, the choice is between more expensive compounds that require re-treatment every 6 months but are generally free of noticeable side effects and cheaper ones that are not. It is difficult to predict which product customers would choose to buy in a shop.\n\nOther alpha-cyano compounds, such as cyfluthrin and alphamethrin, have also been tested in experimental-hut and village trials (Luo et al. 1994; Curtis et al. 1996). These compounds are not reviewed here; although alphamethrin has been used remarkably cheaply in China (Luo et al. 1994), none of these other compounds has yet proved outstanding in comparison with products already in common use.\n\nEtofenprox\n\nEtofenprox is a novel compound structurally different from, but functionally similar to, conventional pyrethroids. The dosage is similar to, that of permethrin, and it performs like permethrin in experimental hut trials (C.F. Curtis, personal communication). Its main advantage is its remarkably low toxicity to mammals — much lower even than permethrin. Because its structure is different, it is reasonable to assume that mosquito populations that have evolved resistance to conventional pyrethroids would be susceptible to etofenprox; unfortunately, this has not proved true of permethrin-resistant An. stephensi (Curtis 1992d).\n\nNonpyrethroid insecticides\n\nNot many conventional nonpyrethroids are safe enough for ITNs. Moreover, in experimental huts, nets impregnated with the organophosphate pyrimiphos-methyl did not give good protection against biting, although many mosquitoes were killed (Miller 1994a). The carbamate bendiocarb is probably too toxic for nets, but on curtains it can both protect against biting and kill mosquitoes that enter the room (Curtis et al. 1994). However, Munasinghe (1994) found that in Sri Lankan houses, curtains treated with permethrin or lambdacyhalothrin prevented mosquito bites better than curtains treated with bendiocarb.\n\nActors and Organizations\n\nITNs need regular re-treatment, and this is a major obstacle to making ITN technology widely available. The insecticide must be transported from the manufacturer to the user, perhaps being repackaged on the way, and must then be applied to the net or curtain. Two kinds of people are likely to take part in this process: business people — including importers, wholesalers, and retailers — and the staff of public-health and community development organizations (Figure 7).\n\nThe insecticide is most likely to be distributed in the following ways:\n\nPretreatment: An initial treatment is applied at the factory, warehouse, or shop before the nets are transported, distributed, or sold.\n\nCoordinated treatment: The nets or curtains of a whole community are treated and re-treated all together in an operation organized and supervised by trained people.\n\nIndividual treatment: Owners decide when their nets or curtains need re-treatment and bring them to a shop or health facility to be treated by trained staff.\n\nHome treatment: Owners treat their own nets and curtains at home with small quantities of insecticide packaged for domestic use.\n\nEach method has advantages and disadvantages in training, logistics, and quality control. For example, pretreatment seems an efficient way to begin an ITN program, but it merely postpones the question of how re-treatment is to be organized and precludes the opportunity to demonstrate correct treatment methods from the start.\n\nITN programs are usually run by large-and medium-sized public-health organizations and are usually of the coordinated-treatment type. Outside the public-health context, pest-control companies may be able to develop a small market in mass ITN treatment for institutions such as schools and prisons.\n\nIndividual treatment, on the other hand, will probably be essential to the development of a viable domestic market in ITNs and will make public-health operations more flexible.\n\nIn some developed countries, home-treatment kits with small quantities of emulsifiable concentrate are already marketed for tourists. In developing countries, however, the domestic market remains uncertain, so relatively little effort has gone into adapting the technology so that it can be used for treatment services or for home use. Developing this market would make ITNs more available; the commercial and public-health distribution systems would complement each other, as they do with chloroquine.\n\nNational and international regulatory authorities are also important. They are responsible for ensuring that minimum safety standards are met throughout manufacture, distribution, and use of ITNs. This involvement includes approving the specifications of insecticide formulations and packaging and registering trade-marked products. It may also include a retail licencing system and inspections to check storage and handling practices, to prevent adulteration, and to ensure minimum standards of training. In some countries, existing regulations for pesticide distribution and use may be adequate, but no consensus exists on the specific criteria that should be applied in this case.\n\nProcesses\n\nPackaging, dosage, and re-treatment\n\nMost insecticides come in 0.5-to 2-L bottles or 20-L drums. These quantities are suitable for mass treatment; 1 L of 55% permethrin or 2.5% lambdacyhalothrin contains enough insecticide for 150 treatments (assuming doses of 200 and 10 mg/m2, respectively, and 15 m2 of fabric).\n\nWhen insecticide is poured from 20-L drums, large amounts are spilled. Bottles are priced a little higher, but, as little is spilled, the true cost is probably about equal. Spillage also occurs during measuring, so squeeze-and-pour bottles are increasingly popular. These have two chambers: a reservoir in the bottom and a smaller, graduated chamber above. When the bottle is squeezed, the contents are forced from the reservoir into the graduated chamber, which can be emptied without releasing any more from the reservoir. These bottles are probably too big for home use, however. The domestic market will probably depend on individual treatments, especially in countries where even such items as mosquito coils and cigarettes are sold singly.\n\nIndividual doses of insecticide concentrate could be poured from a large bottle into smaller, reusable containers at point of sale. This method has two hazards, however: spillage and adulteration. Spillage could be minimized if insecticide were available in squeeze-and-pour bottles. Deliberate adulteration would be harder to control. Purchasers would not be able to detect dilution of a water-based formulation with water or of an EC with an organic solvent, such as kerosene. Reusable containers are, therefore, prohibited in some countries.\n\nIf insecticides are to be sold in small quantities, they must be packaged appropriately in sealed sachets or bottles with tamper-proof lids. Unfortunately, most formulations contain solvents that are incompatible with the plastics of which sachets and small bottles are usually made. This problem is not insurmountable: fluorinated or foil-laminated plastics can be used. AgrEvo already produces a foil sachet for Thailand (J. Invest, personal communication). However, factory-sealed sachets are expensive except in extremely large quantities. For example, one AgrEvo sachet containing 15 mL of permethrin worth less than $0.50 costs $ 1.60 each in quantities up to 20 000. With distribution costs and wholesalers' and retailers' markup, these sachets could not be sold for less than $2.50 — far too much for developing countries. This problem raises two questions: why not package insecticides for home use locally, and what are the technical standards for sachets to contain insecticides (Tincknell 1985; Dollimore 1993).\n\nIt is also difficult to specify the correct quantity and dilution for all combinations of insecticides and fabrics. As we have seen, the same dilution of permethrin suits both cotton and nylon, but the problem of quantity remains — cotton is more absorbent than nylon. Whatever quantity is chosen, it is probably too much for a small, light, synthetic net and not enough for large, heavy, cotton net. The AgrEvo 15-mL sachet is useful because it contains about 8 g of permethrin; diluted in 1 L of water, this quantity is enough for two medium-sized nylon nets treated at about 200 mg/m2 or one fairly light cotton net treated at about 500 mg/m2.\n\nThe aim with alpha-cyano compounds, on the other hand, is a consistent dosage, and cotton and synthetics require different dilutions to achieve this because they absorb different amounts of water. Ideally, therefore, users should choose between two different dilutions, depending on the fabric in their net. This could be made easier by supplying a plastic bag marked with two lines indicating the volumes of water for each type of fabric. It would be simpler, however, to specify a single intermediate dosage.\n\nIn fact, it is doubtful that dosages calculated for public-health programs are appropriate for home use. These doses are designed to maximize the treatment cycle and minimize the work load. Little is known about how often nets are normally washed, but several times over 6 months seems likely, especially where they are common. White nets are washed more often than coloured ones. Perhaps users could treat nets frequently with small doses during the last rinse of a monthly wash, as is often done with bleach or blueing. Such usage would also bring down the price of individual doses. According to one survey, this \"little-and-often\" expenditure pattern explains why urban Tanzanians spend more on mosquito coils than on nets (Stephens et al. 1995). It is not clear whether a little-and-often treatment system is feasible; an initial \"loading dose\" might be necessary.\n\nWhatever the dosage, instructions are always a problem. This problem is partly a matter of conveying information clearly: it must be simple and in easily understood language. Pictures and pictograms should be used as much as possible, especially for safety warnings (Dollimore 1993). Measuring could be difficult; soft-drink or beer bottles could help — they come in standard sizes — but might users be tempted to put excess insecticide back in the bottle where an unsuspecting person might find it and drink it? Of course, users sometimes fail to follow even the clearest instructions, and everyone makes mistakes; for example, it is easy to lose count of the number of times one has filled a bottle and emptied it into a bucket. It is important to note, however, that unlike workers on a mass-treatment project, users dipping their own nets are probably not repeatedly and frequently exposed to insecticides, so greater latitude in procedure is acceptable.\n\nTreatment techniques\n\nExcept in Central Africa, spraying is not common for ITN treatment outside China. It is, however, the routine treatment in Sichuan Province, where there are more pyrethroid ITNs than in all Africa (Curtis 1992b; Cheng et al. 1995). With spray pumps and skilled workers, spraying is quicker than dipping; also, it can be done without moving the net. However, it can be wasteful (Rozendaal et al. 1989; S.R. Meek, personal communication) and can produce patchier insecticide deposit. This latter effect does not seem to have been investigated.\n\nSnow, Phillips et al. (1988), Curtis (1992c), and Sexton (1994) have all described ITN dipping techniques. Box 7 gives the essential details for nets made of a single fabric, and Figure 8 (A-D) shows the key steps in the treatment procedure.\n\nMeasuring absorptive capacity and area\n\nCalculating the dilutions is clearly the most complicated aspect of net treatment. Achieving the right dose depends on a correct estimate of the net's area and the volume of water it will absorb. This volume can be measured by weighing the net first dry and then wet. Alternatively, the net can be soaked in a known volume of water, wrung out, and allowed to drip so that the excess water falls back into a bucket. The final volume of water in the bucket is measured, and the difference between this and the original volume is the amount of water retained by the net.\n\nIt would be helpful to have a rule for calculating absorptive capacity, but it is not easy to define. The volume absorbed per square metre depends not only on the material (synthetic or cotton), but also on whether the thread is monofilament or spun fibre, whether the fabric is woven or knit, and on the tightness of the mesh. The volume absorbed per kilogram of material may be less variable, as suggested by the data in Table 5. Recent work in Dar es Salaam suggests that 1g of fabric absorbs about lmL of water, for a wide variety of nets (J.E. Miller, personal communication).\n\nWhere nets come in a range of standard sizes and materials, time and effort can be saved by drawing up a chart of appropriate volumes of water and insecticide for dipping different types, sizes, and numbers of nets.\n\nAs explained above, permethrin can be used in the same dilution to treat both cotton and synthetic nets. With deltamethrin, by contrast, the higher absorptive capacity of cotton must be compensated for with\n\nOrigin\n\nType of material\n\nArea (m2)\n\nWeight(g)\n\nVolume absorbed (mL)\n\nMali\n\nCotton-polyamide sides; percale top and border\n\n22\n\n1 500\n\n1 500\n\nThailand\n\nPolyester, 100 denier\n\n14.5\n\n460\n\n500\n\na more dilute emulsion; therefore, separate dilutions would be necessary for cotton and synthetic nets.\n\nTarget doses and observed doses\n\nNetting absorbs insecticide in proportion to the volume of emulsion it takes up. In other words, insecticide is not differentially absorbed, and when many nets are dipped together, the first picks up neither more nor less insecticide than the last (Hossain et al. 1989).\n\nIn the laboratory, chemical assays usually indicate that actual dosages vary moderately but are, on average, fairly close to the target (Hossain et al. 1989; Lindsay, Adiamah et al. 1991; Miller et al. 1991). This finding is also sometimes the experience in the field (Snow, Phillips et al. 1988).\n\nIn other cases, however, surprising differences have been reported between the average amount of insecticide that should have been taken up during a mass dipping and the amount later found on netting samples (for example, Somboon 1993). In The Gambia, Alonso, Lindsay, Armstrong-Schellenberg, Konteh et al. (1993) calculated from the amount of insecticide used and the number of net treatments recorded that, on average, 1 183 mg had been consumed per square metre of netting, compared with a target dosage of 500 mg/m2. Chemical assays on random samples taken shortly afterward from villages showed a mean dose of only 179 mg/m2. This discrepancy may have been caused by insecticide dripping out of nets as they dried.\n\nOn the whole, relatively little attention has been paid to variations in the insecticide deposit from net to net or to patchiness of deposits. The field project by Alonso and co-workers is unusual because it produced such information. Deposits on individual ITNs were patchy; three samples were taken from each ITN, and the mean range across a net was 285 mg/m2. Variation between nets was even greater (Figure 9), and surprisingly little of this variation could be attributed to differences among villages and net materials. Patchiness may or may not be functionally important, but variation from net to net certainly is. We need to know more about what causes it.\n\nSome dipping methods have been adopted, retained, and communicated for reasons that make sense but have never been tested experimentally. For example, some groups recommend drying ITNs flat, whereas others hang them up. The method that gives a more even distribution of insecticide has not apparently been identified. Rozendaal et al. (1989) showed that ITNs hung to dry vertically have a slight downward gradient in insecticide concentration, although the difference between top and bottom was negligible compared with the variation observed by Alonso and co-workers in The Gambia. Preliminary experiments with ink dissolved in the concentrate suggest that orientation is\n\nnot as important as folding; colour accumulates at drying points, such as the edges of folds (J. Lines, unpublished).\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nIn Africa, most scientific ITN trials have concentrated on entomological or epidemiological impact. Projects designed to establish practical methods for routine implementation have distributed large numbers of ITNs. The main outstanding problem is how to make re-treatment available in a sustainable manner that achieves consistently good coverage.\n\nThis review shows that technical, operational, and social questions are mutually dependent; the solution to an operational problem will usually raise technical questions, and vice versa. Wider implementation demands study of the following technical issues:\n\nDeveloping a simple way to quantify insecticide deposits on ITNs;\n\nImproving the repeatability and standardization of bioassays and field tests for monitoring mosquito resistance to pyrethroids;\n\nInvestigating resistance — increasing the intensity of surveillance, verifying field reports, and studying biochemical mechanisms and ways to delay resistance evolution;\n\nStandardizing laboratory methods for comparing netting-insecticide combinations and expanding this work to new compounds and different field conditions;\n\nComparing the ease and effectiveness of various net-treatment procedures, including spraying, taking into account the diversity of net designs and fabrics, and identifying sources of variation in the dosages produced in routine dipping; and\n\nImproving packaging — comparing the convenience and safety of various forms of packaging (and their attached instructions) for both public-health use and commercial sale and identifying public preferences with respect to packaging and dipping methods.\n\nGeneral recommendations for research include the following:\n\nSetting up an effective monitoring system for reports of pyrethroid toxicity during treatment and use of ITNs;\n\nEstablishing an international consensus on regulating the commercial marketing of pyrethroids for ITNs, including choice of insecticide and formulation; setting standards for packaging, handling, and labeling; and licencing distributors and retailers;\n\nContinuing the search for pyrethroid and nonpyrethroid insecticides suitable for ITNs; and\n\nDeveloping a netting fibre incorporating a long-acting insecticide and other procedures to increase wash resistance and lengthen re-treatment intervals.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 3 Experiences of Implementation\n\nR.M. Feilden\n\nThis chapter reviews the operational experiences of schemes and programs using nets or curtains impregnated with insecticide as an intervention against malaria. The discussion applies almost equally to nets and curtains, so the phrase \"insecticide-treated nets\" (ITNs) is used throughout. The review covers ITN interventions conducted as primary health care (PHC) services, as well as more vertical or selective ITN interventions. The operational cases range from national programs to schemes for smaller populations, such as a hospital's clientele. Examples have been sought from the public sector, the private sector, international donors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nMost of the literature reflects the principal objective of field trials: demonstrating the efficacy of ITN technology. The details of planning, supervising, managing, and monitoring the implementation of an ITN program are not typically covered in scientific journals. The information used in this review appears mostly in training manuals, household surveys, recording and reporting formats, shipping documents, and annual reports. These sources describe delays, hurdles, and setbacks as well as achievements. I am indebted to everyone who answered our questions; however, the information we obtained does not constitute a complete review of implementation in practice.\n\nThis review takes an approach frequently used in external evaluations of health programs. It considers both inputs (such as supplies and staff) and the activities and processes that must take place if the inputs are to achieve the desired result. This approach does not attempt to evaluate outcomes, such as changes in morbidity and mortality. It mirrors the method for evaluating the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), in which the quality of immunization services is assessed not by sero-conversion surveys or tests of vaccine potency, but by combining measures of utilization with indicators of cold-chain quality, staff technique for handling vaccine and administering injections, and stock management. The assumption is that inputs and activities of a defined and acceptable quality are needed to produce the desired outcome. In an ITN program, the objective is a properly impregnated net that is used correctly. Process evaluation permits identification and rectification of operational constraints. One objective of this review is to identify indicators that will help managers to implement, monitor, and evaluate ITN activities.\n\nWe obtained little information about private-sector inputs and activities, so this review concentrates on ITN programs implemented by governments, international donors, NGOs, and not-for-profit ventures. The effect of subsidized programs on private suppliers is of particular interest, as are administrative and legal constraints that businesses and NGOs face to a far greater extent than do international agencies.\n\nDoes the Supply of Bednets and Insecticide Meet Demand?\n\nIs there any need for market intervention to make ITNs more readily available? Household surveys and ITN projects introduced by employers, NGOs, and donors suggest that ITNs would be used more widely if they were available and if people could afford to buy them.\n\nNets have been used for decades, but the market shows both uneven supply and lack of knowledge among potential customers. On the supply side, there are places, such as Maputo in Mozambique, where people know about nets and were in the habit of using them but now cannot find them in the shops. In other places, such as Dar es Salaam (Evans 1994) and Bobo-D"
