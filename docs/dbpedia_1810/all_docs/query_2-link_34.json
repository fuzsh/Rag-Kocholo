        "text": "Michael Bleekemolen (born 2 October 1949 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands) is a former racing driver who raced for the RAM and ATS teams in Formula One.\n\nMichael Bleekemolen was a Dutch Formula Super Vee and Formula Ford driver, when he in 1977 came to F1 as a complete surprise with a lot of Dutch sponsor money in 1977. The entry into F1 with the RAM Racing Team March 761 Cosworth at the Dutch Grand Prix was clearly too early for Bleekemolen since he lacked any experience with the fast cars of Formula 1. His application was bound to fail, and Bleekemolen could not qualify.\n\nIn 1978 he went back to Formula 3 Championship with rank 5 in the standings when he got back to F1 in mid-season with a sponsor money at ATS. The second attempt to take a foot in the formula failed too. Only at the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen he could qualify for a Grand Prix race, but resigned after a defect in the oil pump early in the race.\n\nBleekemolen was then on his ambitions in the highest class of international motorsport and focused on a consistent progress in the lower classes. He ran from 1979 three more years in Formula 3 and could always classify in the European Championship among the best. As in, it became clear that will be denied him a very great career, he continued sporadically sports car race, pulled the mid-1980s, apart from occasional appearances in touring car racing, from active racing back and took the careers of his sons Jeroen and Sebastiaan on. In 2011 he participated in a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG part in the ADAC GT Masters.\n\nOverview Dutch Formula One drivers:\n\nJan Flinterman (1952)\n\nDries van der Lof (1952)\n\nCarel Godin de Beaufort (1957 – 1964)\n\nBen Pon (1962)\n\nRob Slotemaker* (1962)\n\nGijs van Lennep (1971 – 1975)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (1975)\n\nBoy Hayje (1976 – 1977)\n\nMichael Bleekemolen (1977 – 1978)\n\nJan Lammers (1979 – 1992)\n\nHuub Rothengatter (1984 – 1986)\n\nJos Verstappen (1994 – 2003)\n\nRobert Doornbos (2004 – 2006)\n\nChristijan Albers (2005 – 2007)\n\nGiedo van der Garde (2008 – 2014)\n\nRobin Frijns* (2013 – 2014)\n\nMax Verstappen (2014 – …)\n\nNyck de Vries (2022 – …)\n\nBoy Hayje (born 3 May 1949, Amsterdam) is a former racing driver from the Netherlands. He participated in seven Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 29 August 1976. He scored no championship points.\n\nAfter his victory in the Dutch Formula Ford championship in 1974, Hayje got the possibility of a international motorsport career. That same year, he ran his first race in the European Formula 5000 in a McLaren M18. The following year Hayje took another five races in this series as part of the Hezemans Racing Team, but could not achieve a remarkable result.\n\nIn 1976 Hayje participated in the British Formula 3 series and finished eighth in the championship standings. In addition, he raced three races in the European Formula 3, where he had a pole position and a podium place was.\n\nIn the same year Hayjes gained international notoriety when he entered his first and only Formula 1 Grand Prix race of that year, the Grand Prix of the Netherlands. He qualified his F&S Properties Penske PC3 in 21st place on the grid, but resigned shortly before the end of the race (lap 63/75) due to a defect of the halfshaft.\n\nIn the following 1977 season Hayje joined the RAM Racing F&S Properties Team with a March 761 for a total of six Grands Prix, but could only qualify twice. The Grand Prix of South Africa, he was unable to finish due to transmission problems. At the Belgium Grand Prix Haye did not cover the sufficient distance of the race to be counted in the final standings.\n\nOnce his Formula One career was over, Hayje raced in the European Renault 5 Turbo championship.\n\nOverview Dutch Formula One drivers:\n\nJan Flinterman (1952)\n\nDries van der Lof (1952)\n\nCarel Godin de Beaufort (1957 – 1964)\n\nBen Pon (1962)\n\nRob Slotemaker* (1962)\n\nGijs van Lennep (1971 – 1975)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (1975)\n\nBoy Hayje (1976 – 1977)\n\nMichael Bleekemolen (1977 – 1978)\n\nJan Lammers (1979 – 1992)\n\nHuub Rothengatter (1984 – 1986)\n\nJos Verstappen (1994 – 2003)\n\nRobert Doornbos (2004 – 2006)\n\nChristijan Albers (2005 – 2007)\n\nGiedo van der Garde (2008 – 2014)\n\nRobin Frijns* (2013 – 2014)\n\nMax Verstappen (2014 – …)\n\nNyck de Vries (2022 – …)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (born 12 December 1948 in Eindhoven, Noord-Brabant) is a Dutch former racing driver. He participated in six Formula One World Championship Grands Prix for Ensign, debuting on 27 April 1975. He scored no championship points.\n\nRoelof Wunderink began his career in 1970 in the Dutch Formula Ford Championship, which he won in 1972. With a lot of money sponsor of HB Bewakingsystems he went in 1973 in Formula 3 and Formula 5000 in 1974.\n\nThe money from HB brought him in 1975 in the Formula 1. With the Ensign N174-Cosworth he managed twice this season a qualification at a world championship race, even managed that with the Ensign N175, was financed the development and construction of HB Bewaking system, Wunderink but never was able to classify. Making its debut at the Grand Prix of Spain, he fell out on lap 20 from a defect in the transmission. In the Grand Prix of Austria he finished, but was not classified. He had four laps behind the winner Vittorio Brambilla, when the race was stopped after 29 laps due to rain. In his last appearance in Formula 1, Grand Prix of the United States, he fell out again. This time, due to a gearbox failure in the 41st round.\n\nAt the end of the same year Wunderink had a serious accident during testing with a Formula 5000 car and suffered a broken cheekbone after which he retired from racing.\n\nHis former sponsor took over in late 1975 of the cars Ensign N175. HB founded in early 1976 a team called HB Bewaking system with base in the Netherlands. There, the N175 is a slightly revised. He was named Boro 001 and was used by HB Bewaking system in the years 1976 and 1977 individual world championship races in Formula 1. Trying to move Wunderink a comeback was unsuccessful; instead of him had HB Bewaking system with Larry Perkins (1976) and Brian Henton (1977) compete.\n\nOverview Dutch Formula One drivers:\n\nJan Flinterman (1952)\n\nDries van der Lof (1952)\n\nCarel Godin de Beaufort (1957 – 1964)\n\nBen Pon (1962)\n\nRob Slotemaker* (1962)\n\nGijs van Lennep (1971 – 1975)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (1975)\n\nBoy Hayje (1976 – 1977)\n\nMichael Bleekemolen (1977 – 1978)\n\nJan Lammers (1979 – 1992)\n\nHuub Rothengatter (1984 – 1986)\n\nJos Verstappen (1994 – 2003)\n\nRobert Doornbos (2004 – 2006)\n\nChristijan Albers (2005 – 2007)\n\nGiedo van der Garde (2008 – 2014)\n\nRobin Frijns* (2013 – 2014)\n\nMax Verstappen (2014 – …)\n\nNyck de Vries (2022 – …)\n\nJonkheer Gijs van Lennep (born 16 March 1942, in Aerdenhout, North Holland) is a Dutch esquire and former racing driver who competed in eight Formula One races. However his main achievements were at the wheel of a sports car.\n\nVan Lennep drove for the Porsche sportscar team from 1967 and won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1971 with Helmut Marko driving the number 22 Martini sponsored Porsche 917K. They set a distance record, covering 5335 km which remained unbeaten until the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans .\n\nThat year the Stichting Autoraces Nederland (Foundation for Car races in the Netherlands), hired a Surtees TS7 for him to make his F1 debut in his home GP where he finished a creditable eighth in a very wet GP. The following year Van Lennep won the 1972 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship driving a Surtees TS11 and a McLaren M18.[1] He also drove twice for the Williams GP team, earning his first World Championship point with 6th place in the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix. With Ensign he scored a second point in the 1975 German Grand Prix, making him the second most successful Dutch Formula 1 driver, until the emergence of Jos Verstappen.\n\nIn 1973 he won the last Targa Florio with Herbert Müller in a Martini Porsche Carrera RSR.\n\nHe continued with sportscar racing, winning the Le Mans 24 Hours for a second time in 1976, sharing a Porsche 936 Turbo with Jacky Ickx before retiring from racing.\n\nOverview Dutch Formula One drivers:\n\nJan Flinterman (1952)\n\nDries van der Lof (1952)\n\nCarel Godin de Beaufort (1957 – 1964)\n\nBen Pon (1962)\n\nRob Slotemaker* (1962)\n\nGijs van Lennep (1971 – 1975)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (1975)\n\nBoy Hayje (1976 – 1977)\n\nMichael Bleekemolen (1977 – 1978)\n\nJan Lammers (1979 – 1992)\n\nHuub Rothengatter (1984 – 1986)\n\nJos Verstappen (1994 – 2003)\n\nRobert Doornbos (2004 – 2006)\n\nChristijan Albers (2005 – 2007)\n\nGiedo van der Garde (2008 – 2014)\n\nRobin Frijns* (2013 – 2014)\n\nMax Verstappen (2014 – …)\n\nNyck de Vries (2022 – …)\n\nRob Slotemaker (13 June 1929 in Batavia – 16 September 1979 in Zandvoort) was a Dutch racing driver.\n\nHe entered one Formula One World Championship race, the 1962 Dutch Grand Prix, with one of Carel Godin de Beaufort’s Porsches.His entry was taken by Wolfgang Seidel.\n\nAt the start of the new Grand Prix season Ecurie Maarsbergen got out in full force by entering no less than three cars for the Dutch Grand Prix. Apart from himself Carel also entered cars for Ben Pon and Rob Slotemaker. In the end Slotemaker didn’t participate because his car was not ready in time for the event, his entry was taken over by Wolfgang Seidel who borrowed an Emeryson from the factory for the occasion. It’s unclear whether the Seidel car was run by Maarsbergen in practice or only on paper.\n\nThroughout the 1960s Slotemaker competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, and was a driver and advisor for the Le Mans film in 1970.\n\nIn 1956 he established his “Anti-skid” driving school at Zandvoort, which is still operating today.\n\nOn 16 September 1979 at the Circuit Park Zandvoort, Slotemaker was killed when he crashed his Chevrolet Camaro during the “Trophy of the Dunes” touring car race. His car spun on a patch of oil and collided with a course car parked alongside the track. Despite the relatively minor force of the accident, he suffered a broken neck and died instantly. A doctor in the course car was also injured.\n\nA section of the circuit, the right-hander past Hunzerug, is named in his memory.\n\nMore information on Slotemaker at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Slotemaker\n\nOverview Dutch Formula One drivers:\n\nJan Flinterman (1952)\n\nDries van der Lof (1952)\n\nCarel Godin de Beaufort (1957 – 1964)\n\nBen Pon (1962)\n\nRob Slotemaker* (1962)\n\nGijs van Lennep (1971 – 1975)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (1975)\n\nBoy Hayje (1976 – 1977)\n\nMichael Bleekemolen (1977 – 1978)\n\nJan Lammers (1979 – 1992)\n\nHuub Rothengatter (1984 – 1986)\n\nJos Verstappen (1994 – 2003)\n\nRobert Doornbos (2004 – 2006)\n\nChristijan Albers (2005 – 2007)\n\nGiedo van der Garde (2008 – 2014)\n\nRobin Frijns* (2013 – 2014)\n\nMax Verstappen (2014 – …)\n\nNyck de Vries (2022 – …)\n\nJonkheer Carel Godin de Beaufort (10 April 1934, Maarsbergen – 2 August 1964, Cologne, Germany) was a Dutch nobleman and motorsport driver from the Netherlands. He competed in Formula One between 1957 and 1964.\n\nHe participated in 31 World Championship Grands Prix, becoming the first Dutchman ever to score points in the Formula One World Championship, and numerous non-Championship Formula One races. He was one of the last truly amateur drivers in F1, and ran his own cars – painted the vibrant Dutch racing colour: orange – under the Ecurie Maarsbergen banner, the team taking its name from de Beaufort’s country estate. In early years he was considered something of a mobile chicane, and a danger to other drivers on the track. However, in later years he matured into a competent and popular competitor.\n\nAlways a Porsche devotee (he only drove two World Championship races in anything else) he was a familiar sight at both Championship and non-Championship races in his orange Porsche 718, bought from the Rob Walker Racing Team. Although the 718 was outclassed even in its first year with him, he persisted with it as it was the only design into which he could fit his burly frame. The size of the car, and a streak of self-deprecating humour in de Beaufort himself, earned it the nickname “Fatty Porsche”. With stereotypical aristocratic eccentricity he often drove without shoes, and at his final race in Germany was even seen taking practice laps wearing a Beatles wig, rather than his helmet.\n\nHe died after an accident at the Nürburgring, during practice for the 1964 German Grand Prix. Driving the Porsche 718, the car suddenly veered off the track at the infamous Bergwerk corner. He was thrown out of the car and suffered massive injuries to his head, chest and legs. Initially de Beaufort was taken to a local hospital, but was later transferred to a major neurological hospital in Cologne. He died from his injuries three days after the accident.\n\nMore on Carel Godin de Beaufort at 8w.forix.com/beaufort.html and www.carelgodindebeaufort.nl\n\nOverview Dutch Formula One drivers:\n\nJan Flinterman (1952)\n\nDries van der Lof (1952)\n\nCarel Godin de Beaufort (1957 – 1964)\n\nBen Pon (1962)\n\nRob Slotemaker* (1962)\n\nGijs van Lennep (1971 – 1975)\n\nRoelof Wunderink (1975)\n\nBoy Hayje (1976 – 1977)\n\nMichael Bleekemolen (1977 – 1978)\n\nJan Lammers (1979 – 1992)\n\nHuub Rothengatter (1984 – 1986)\n\nJos Verstappen (1994 – 2003)\n\nRobert Doornbos (2004 – 2006)\n\nChristijan Albers (2005 – 2007)\n\nGiedo van der Garde (2008 – 2014)\n\nRobin Frijns* (2013 – 2014)\n\nMax Verstappen (2014 – …)\n\nNyck de Vries (2022 – …)"
