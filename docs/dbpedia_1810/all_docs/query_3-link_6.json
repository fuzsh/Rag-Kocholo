Be patient now...\n\nOkay, first batch now: (2nd batch tomorrow)\n\nWith all these questions popping up about how they're doing these days, I've decided that now is the right time to do this. I had wanted to put this on a website, put time, knowhow etc. are against me, even whilst I've got a break now, so rather than clutter more webspace up, I've put it on TNF so that anyone interested can share the results of my findings.\n\nAs you know I specialise in the Grand Prix drivers & specifically, their wherabouts these days - it's something I've been doing since 1992 & I've reached a zenith now, I think.

Also make note Roger Penske runs also NASCAR team. Nice to know Keke real name is Keijo which sounds Japanese. When did Vincenzo suffered injuries or Ukyo Katayama fought cancer? I never heard anything of the two. I know why Katayama cancer kept secret due to the Japanese culture.\n\nUkyo fought cancer & beat it in 1996/97 - Sospiri crashed in 1999, IIRC.\n\nDunno if anyone is still doing updates on the above - just sifting through - I apologise for any puncutation mistakes (although all names, dates etc are correct) but I apologise in the case of Tony Marsh for the derogrative term I gave to Worcestershire!! It's a great place, honestly!\n\nUpdates: (thanks for those already mentioned - have been changed on my original file)\n\nTom Belso - very occasional racer in historic events\n\nErice Bernard - hampered by broken leg (third during career) this year\n\nMark Blundell - looking to form or manage his own team state-side for 2002 or 2003\n\nBruno Giacomelli - regular Atlas F1 BB user! (thanks to Barry Boor)\n\nAl Pease - retired, lives in Tennessee, mainly does car restoring in his spare time (thanks to F1 rejects)\n\nnew entry:\n\nTakuma Sato (J) b. 28/1/1977, Tokyo - makes his F1 bow with Jordan-Honda in 2002\n\nGREAT JOB! I found a small error in Helmut Marko's entry: he had the eye injury during the 1972 French GP, not '71.\n\nDidn't know: Robert O'Brien ...rumour has it that he was a CIA agent who used the above name as an alias & racing was a cover for his activities...\n\nVery interesting!?!?\n\nOn the subject of \"Where are they now?\"...\n\nI just yesterday completed (for a second time) a three-day seminar on race car engineering. The youngest member (and one of the keenest) of the group, a university student, happened to mention to me on the third day, \"My father used to race.\"\n\n\"Oh really,\" I said, \"In what category?\"\n\nThe answer was touring cars, etc, etc, \"...and Formula 1 for a little while, until he was seriously injured in a crash...\"\n\nSuspicious (this was in Australia and he seemed and sounded Australian to me - and I know all of Australia's F1 drivers) I asked what was his name.\n\n\"Basil van Rooyen,\" he told me, and was genuinely shocked that I had heard of him!\n\nIt seems Basil and his family moved to Australia around 16 years ago (when his son James was an infant) and now lives in retirement in a suburb on the north side of Sydney.\n\nThat was news to me.\n\nVan Rooyen raced a Holden Torana at Bathurst in the mid-1970s. Perhaps that visit made him aware of the potential of Australia as a place to live, in favour of a more troubled South Africa.\n\nThanks Barry for that - another new entry:\n\nFelipe Massa b. 25/4/1982, Sao Paulo:- joins Sauber next year in Formula 1, thus becoming youngest driver of them all.\n\nDavid Kennedy (IRL) b. 15/1/1983, Sligo:- Now a TV commentator\n\nI guess he is 30 years older... Or he tried to qualify some 3 years before he was even born...\n\nOr his real name was Dorian Gray? Irish he is...\n\nWHOOPS!!!!!!!! I knew there was a stinker in there.... Yes that should be 53.\n\nOr was I just testing you all with my deliberate mistake?!?!?! ahem...\n\nKurt Adolff is still alive and well. He lives in Achenkirch. Austria, not far from the German border. Will know more about his career after 1953 within soon.\n\nGraham McRae now lives in Auckland where he builds replica Porsches.\n\nOriginally posted by Richie Jenkins\n\nnew entry:\n\nTakuma Sato (J) b. 28/1/1977, Tokyo - makes his F1 bow with Jordan-Honda in 2002\n\nThat's great news, for Sato is a driver of the Montoya mould! If it hadn't been for the Colombian, I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't have watched many F1 races this year, but now things are definitely looking up. Maybe I need to dust off my TV set again? It's been unused for several months now...\n\nThe only downside is that Justin Wilson seems to be left out in the cold yet again. Now here's a great racer, waiting for a chance to shine... in an Arrows, maybe?\n\nI'll be interested to see how Sato goes in F1 - we need more chargers. He was at Goodwood FoS this year with BAR, but only on the Friday. He was by far the most spectacular of the F1 drivers off the line, even though he was theoretically only doing an untimed demo run, and drew a standing ovation from the startline grandstand. He certainly wasn't using traction control ...\n\nThanks guys for the updates - keep em coming - I guess we can add Katayama's brilliant acheivement to the above list.\n\nKurt Kuhnke\n\nDt\n\nb 30 april 1910\n\nD ?? ?? 1994\n\n-----------\n\nmotor im bild/Munchen Dt\n\nDavid Kennedy b 15/1/1953\n\n______________\n\nWHEN xxxx was 30 years old in the year of his GP debut the is he now :\n\n78 year Harry Merkel (D) b.? maby in live ?\n\n78 year Ludwig Fischer (D) b. ? maby in live ?\n\n68 year Gunther Seiffert (D) b. ? maby in live ?\n\n67 year Frank J Dochnal (US) b.? maby in live ?\n\n63 year Tom Jones (USA) b.? : maby in live ?\n\n54 year Karl Oppitzhauser (A) b. ? maby in live ?\n\nxxxx is now yy old\n\n90 year Ken Richardson (GB) b. 21/8/1911, Bourne maby in live ?\n\n86 year Arthur Owen (GB) b. 23/3/1915, London:- maby in live ?\n\n85 year Phil Cade (USA) b. 12/6/1916, Charles City, Iowa maby in live ?\n\n84 year Robert La Caze (MA) b. 26/2/1917, Paris, France maby in live ?\n\n84 year Oswald Karch (D) b. 6/3/1917, Ludwigshafen maby in live ?\n\n82 year Roberto Bonomi (RA) b. 30/9/1919, Buenos Aires: maby in live ?\n\nRichie,\n\nFantastic job ! I particularly find great the precise places of birth and deaths wich I lacked. Thanks. Here are a few minor info :\n\nPhilippe Alliot is the F1 consultant of french cable TV Channel L'Equipe TV (channel of the daily sports newspaper).\n\nDerek Bell drives in SCCA World Challenge - GT Class in a Champion Racing Audi S4 Competition. He does live comments during races for Speedvision.\n\nDidn't Bira died of a heart attack in the London tube ?\n\nSlim Borgudd even was European Champion in FIA Truck Racing in 1995.\n\nErik Comas mostly does rallying this last two years (in Japan & USA)\n\nMartin Donnelly has a great team in British F3\n\nThe make created by Howden Ganley and Tim Schenken was Tiga.\n\nRichie Ginther died near Bordeaux.\n\nAndré Gulefi worked for ELF Aquitaine (not Aquatine)\n\nDuncan Hamilton probably died in 1994 rather than at 14yo in 1934 !(got one of your delibarate mistakes ;) =.\n\nStefan Johansson is no longer involved in CART/Lights. He has founded Johansson Motorsports with his friend Mike Earle (Onyx F2/F3000/F1) and runs Gulf sponsored 2000 Audi R8s. He won the ELMS title this year.\n\nLoris Kessel races all over the world with the Lamborghini Super Sports Trophy.\n\nJacques Laffite does the live F1 comments for french national TV : TF1. 2001 was his fifth season doing so.\n\nArturo Merzario raced in italian sportscar championship. He is part of the SRWC/ISRS since the beginning in the lower SR2 category.\n\nJackie Oliver didn't really founded Shadow AVS. Don Nichols did and Oliver came on board shortly after.\n\nHenri Pescarolo founded his Endurance team. Peugeot (for engines)& FFSA (for drivers) official support extented for 2002.\n\nPierre-Henri Raphanel has built great links with Japan racing. He is know managing young french drivers, among which Sébastien Philippe and Benoît Tréluyer who are brilliant in Japan F3 and JGTCC.\n\nBernd Schneider is Mercedes top driver. No more sportscars since Mercedes retired from Endurance, but clinched another DTM title this year.\n\nHans-Joachim Stück is still a BMW factory driver but in GTs not sportscars.\n\nTeo Fabi's son is doing karting at a high level (FSA). Can't remember his name.\n\nJarno Trulli created his own make of karts.\n\nMaybe more to come...\n\nThanks again Richie\n\nThanks FEV - superb! I had a few doubts over some of them about what they were doing very recently - yes, Hamilton is wrong - I'm going blind there as I actually triple checked the first batch - at least I've got 99 percent of it correct!\n\nBira - yes, i think now he did die of a heart related illness but IIRC he died at home - I could be wrong...\n\nGinther's death place is excellent - interesting to know what Comas, Raphanel amongst others are doing - thanks very much - I will change any corrections on my original database.\n\nBoniver - thanks for the Kuhnke date, which I believe is accurate.\n\nTom Jones is alive ;)\n\n& I can vouch for Cade & Owen still being alive today - reasonably sure Richardson, Bonomi & Lacaze are; Karch, none too sure\n\nContinued thanks for updates... Time to get my glasses fixed!\n\n(Still I did say - it was definitive!)\n\nRichie: confirming FEV's info, here is the last paragraph of \"The Prince and I\" by Princess Ceril Birabongse:\n\nMy brother rang me at home in Italy late one night to tell me Bira was dead. He had suffered a heart attack, collapsed and died on the platform of Baron's Court underground station two days before Christmas 1985 - just opposite the block of flats where, for the last 20 years, I had always stayed during my London visits. He was seventy one.\n\nObviously, Baron's Court is pretty specific as a place of death, but I don't know which platform ....\n\nOriginally posted by Richie Jenkins\n\nBruno Giacomelli - regular Atlas F1 BB user!

Barry?\n\nOriginally posted by FEV\n\nMartin Donnelly has a great team in British F3\n\nMartin Donnelly Racing only competed for one season in F3, iirc. I think that was about three or four years ago, now they are doing Formula Renault, as far as I recall.\n\nYes Fines you are right, I think he wanted to come back to F3 this year but has not.\n\nThis thread made me think about a fact : why does nobody (even the great Forix) inlcude Indy 500 non-qualifiers of the 1950-60 era in the all-time Grand Prix drivers list ? IMHO they have their place in this very exclusive club as much as Tom Jones, Phil Cade, Jean-Claude Rudaz et al. Some of them are great AAA/USAC drivers (Charles van Acker, Joel Thorne, Billy DeVore, Johny Mauro...) and yes some are quite obscure (great stuff for F1rejects guys !).\n\nSo I have little data for most of them, but since some are great dirt-track/midget/sprint-car drivers maybe some of you american fellows have something about some of the 77 drivers I suggest to induct in the \"Grand Prix Hall of Fame\" !!\n\nAll are americans unless stated.\n\nCharles van ACKER b. 14-03-1912 in Belgium (1950 Stevens-Offy)\n\nEmil ANDRES b. 22-02-1911 d. 20-07-1999 (1950 Kurtis-Offy)\n\nJohnny BALDWIN (1956 Ferrari)\n\nBuzz BARTON b. 1916 (1952 Rae-Offy / 1953 Pawl D-Offy)\n\nJoe BARZDA (1951 Maserati-Offy / 1952 Maserati-Offy / 1953 Maserati)\n\nTony BONADIES (1955 Kurtis 3000D-Offy / 1956 Kurtis 3000D-Offy / 1957 Kurtis 500C-Offy & Kuzma D-Offy)\n\nBill BOYD (1951 Golula-Offy)\n\nMike BRUCH (1950 Maserati)\n\nMarvin BURKE (1950 Kurtis-Duray)\n\nNeal CARTER b. 1923 (1952 Kurtis 500A-Offy)\n\nBob CLEBERG (1960 Epperly-Offy)\n\nBud CLEMONS (1957 Shilala-Offy)\n\nHal COLE b. 12-11-1912 d. 12-11-1970 apparently died the day of his 58th birthday – would be the only “GP” driver in this case.\n\n(1950 Kurtis 2000-Offy)\n\nRuss CONGDON (1960 Curtis-Offy)\n\nBob CORTNER (1958 Kurtis 3000-Offy / 1959 Cornis-Offy)\n\nBilly DEVORE b. 12-09-1912 d. 12-08-1985 (1950 Scopa-Offy / 1954 Kurtis 3000-Offy)\n\nLee DROLLINGER (1960 Kurtis-Offy)\n\nTed DUNCAN (1950 Kurtis 2000-Offy)\n\nRex EASTON b. 1913 (1958 Kurtis 500G-Offy & Kurtis 500A-Offy / 1959 Lesovsky-Offy)\n\nKenny EATON (1950 Bardazon-Offy / 1951 Stevens-Offy)\n\nJack ENSLEY (1958 Kurtis 500D-Offy / 1959 Kurtis 500G-Offy)\n\nJohnny FEDRICKS (1950 ?-Offy / 1952 Kurtis-Cadillac / 1953 Kurtis 500B-Offy / Kurtis 500C-Offy)\n\nMilt FRANKHOUSER (1950 Stevens-Offy)\n\nDick FRAZIER (1950 Meyer-Offy / 1952 Stevens-Offy)\n\nAndy FURCI (1957 Schroeder D-Offy)\n\nJoe GIBA (1958 Kurtis 500D-Offy)\n\nPotsy GOACHER (1953 Pankratz D-Offy / 1954 Moore D-Offy)\n\nBob GREGG (1950 Kurtis 2000-Offy)\n\nPeter HAHN (1952 Snowberger-Offy)\n\nRed HAMILTON (1953 Kurtis 4000-Offy)\n\nAllen HEATH Canadian b. 1918 (1952 Kurtis 4000-Offy & Kuzma-Studebaker / 1953 Ewing D-Offy)\n\nAl HERMAN (1953 Kurtis 2000-Offy / 1954 Kurtis 3000-Offy / 1958 Kuzma-Offy)\n\nNorm HOUSER b. 18-12-1915 (1950 Kurtis-Duray / Miller-Offy)\n\nChuck HULSE b. 3-10-1927 (1960 Kuzma-Offy & Kurtis -Offy)\n\nVan JOHNSON (1958 Kurtis 500C-Offy)\n\nJohnny KAY (1953 Clemons D-Offy / 1955 Silnes Sherman D-Offy / 1956 Kurtis 4000D-Offy / 1959 Kurtis 500C-Offy )\n\nRuss KLAR (1955 Schroeder D-Offy)\n\nRay KNEPPER (1951 Silnes-Offy)\n\nChuck LEIGHTON (1950 ?-Wayne)\n\nMark LIGHT (1950 Stevens-Offy & Meyer-Offy)\n\nRalph LIGUORI (1959 Maserati & Kurtis 500G-Offy)\n\nFrank LUPTOW (1952 Ewing-Offy)\n\nGeorge LYNCH b. 20-06-1918 (1950 Snwoberger-Offy / 1951 Rassey-Offy)\n\nCy MARSHALL b. 17-04-1902 d. 20-12-1974 (1950 Ralph Miller)\n\nJohnny MAURO b. 25-10-1911 (1950 ALFA-Romeo / 1952 Ferrari)\n\nAl MILLER b. 1907 d. 18-08-1967 (1950 Miller RE4D)\n\nJohnny MOOREHOUSE (1959 Kurtis 500G-Offy)\n\nEarl MOTTER (1959 Kuzma-Offy)\n\nFrank MUNDY (1954 Shroeder-Offy)\n\nRoy NEUMAN (1953 Maserati)\n\nDanny OAKES b.1911 (1953 Moore D-Offy / 1954 Kurtis 4000-Offy & Ferrari)\n\nJim PACKARD (1959 Kuzma-Offy / 1960 Kuzma-Offy)\n\nJiggs PETERS (1955 Scopa D-Offy)\n\nMarvin PIFER (1956 Ewing D-Offy)\n\nRalph PRATT (1950 Bardazon-Offy & Golula-Offy)\n\nDick REESE (1956 Kurtis 4000D-Offy)\n\nGordon REID b.1923 (1951 Silnes-Chevrolet)\n\nJohnny ROBERTS 1953 Kurtis 2000-Offy\n\nHal ROBSON Canadian b. 1912 (1953 Voelker)\n\nChuck RODEE = Charles Roedinger b. 8-09-1927 d. 14-05-1966\n\n(1959 Kuzma-Offy / 1960 Dunn-Offy)\n\nBud ROSE (1950 Bromme-Offy)\n\nEbb ROSE b. 26-05-1906 (1960 Moore-Offy)\n\nJack ROUNDS (1960 Lesovsky-Offy)\n\nMike SALAY = Mike Szalai b. 10-06-1910 d. ?-11-1973\n\n(1951 Szalai D-Offy)\n\nBob SCHROEDER (1959 Kurtis 500D-Offy)\n\nWayne SELSER (1953 Christy-Offy)\n\nBud SENNETT (1951 Maserati)\n\nDoc SHANEBROOK (1951 Stevens-Offy / 1952 Pawl-Offy)\n\nJoe SOSTILIO (1953 Kurtis 500A-Chrysler)\n\nGig STEPHENS (1956 Kurtis 2000D-Offy)\n\nOtis STINE (1952 Scopa-Offy)\n\nBill TAYLOR (1952 Lesovsky-Offy / 1953 Lesovsky D-Offy)\n\nJoel THORNE b. 16-10-1914 d. 17-10-1955 (1950 Kurtis-Sparks / 1951 Adams-Sparks)\n\nGeorge TICHENOR (1952 Kurtis 4000-Offy / 1954 Kurtis 2000-Offy / 1955 Lesovsky-Offy)\n\nLeRoy WARRINER (1951 Kurtis-Offenhauser / 1953 Kurtis D-Offy / 1955 Kurtis 500A-Offy / 1956 Kurtis 3000D-Offy / 1958 Kurtis 500C-Offy)\n\nFEV\n\nOnce again, the TNF has proved somewhere where you learn stuff you never knew -

I've never seen this list anywhere until now - interesting to see Bob Schroeder on the list - I'll see if I can find anything - thanks once again\n\nMarcor has researched van Acker - he was enquiring at TrackForum about him a while back -

Neal Carter, Teddy Duncan, Rex Easton, Danny Oakes and LeRoy Warriner also are so it might not be too difficult to find things about them.
