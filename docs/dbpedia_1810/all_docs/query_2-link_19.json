        "text": "THE FIRST TWO YEARS: THE GIANTS GERMANY, BRAZIL AND ​\n\nIn the following race, the Monaco GP, the United States competed for the first time with Harry Schell with a Cooper powered by a JAP engine: 20th on the starting grid, he pulled out on the first lap because of an accident which forced nine vehicles to abandon the race. In the last race of the year, the Italian GP, it was Germany’s turn: driving a Maserati, Paul Pietsch was stopped by a problem with the 4CL engine after just a few meters.\n\nIn the next two races in the 1951 championship, a Brazilian and a Spaniard made their debuts. In Monza, Chico Landi managed to complete just one lap in a Ferrari before being stopped by transmission problems. Francisco Godia-Sales, on the other hand, managed to finish his home race, the Spanish GP at Pedralbes, in a Maserati, although he was 10 laps behind the winner. ​"
