        "text": "Prelude\n\nGOOD DAY AND GREETINGS, MUSIC‑MINDED CITIZENS. For this month and for the next two we’re taking a 3‑part sojourn in uncharted lands (as medieval cartographers once denoted, ‘terra incognita’) and what monstrosities may inhabit those unexplored territories (‘hic sunt dracones’, literally translated as ‘here be dragons’). Yes folks, it is time for CRAVE Guitars to explore a current‑day innovation that once seemed surreal but is rapidly becoming increasingly real; a phenomenon that the original makers of what we now know as vintage guitars could never have envisaged (probably).\n\nWhether we like it or not, the faddish fuss around Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a ‘BIG THING’ at the moment. At the forefront of the debate are the societal dilemmas posed by sophisticated systems potentially becoming more intelligent than human beings (in my experience, not particularly difficult in many cases!).\n\n“I’d rather see artificial intelligence than no intelligence” – Michael Crichton (American author)\n\nIn a worst case scenario, how does a supposedly civilised society prevent malicious actors using AI technology for nefarious means? A profound question indeed. Prescient Hollywood film director James Cameron’s bleak vision of Cyberdyne Systems, Skynet and Terminators can, perhaps, be taken as an extreme but stark lesson. The rise of the machines, taking over the world and resulting in the potential obliteration of humanity is a chilling proposition. It seems we already have too many twisted tyrants willing and attempting to achieve that end right now with and without AI and robotics as the means. Just spare a moment to think what deranged despots could do with the technology and what the consequences may be for everyone in the very near future. AI’s potential demands that collectively we address the challenge of what needs to be done to avoid the annihilation of civilisation through unhindered autonomous technological advance.\n\n“Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony” – the character Morpheus from ‘The Matrix’ (1999)\n\nWhat on Earth does this divergent dystopian diatribe (apologies, folks) have to do with vintage guitars and music you may well be justified in asking? Very little, other than as an existential context. From here on, we’ll be taking a far more parochial and prosaically pedestrian path.\n\nLike many people, I have become curious about what AI means for culture and specifically for the creative crafts. Given my obsession with vintage guitars and music, I thought I’d turn my attention to what AI might have to say on the matter. So… that is the basis of this month’s article. For once, I can say, quite legitimately, that AI was used to research and write this article. This interesting (?) examination will not change the world but, then again, neither will it jeopardise it.\n\n“Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without” – the character Merovingian from ‘The Matrix’ (1999)\n\nBefore we get to vintage guitars and what wisdom (or not) AI has to impart, we have to do some homework about AI so that the rest of the article makes sense. We’ll start with an English hero and take it from there.\n\nAlan Turing and the Turing Test\n\nThe following description of one of the world’s most influential geniuses in the world of computers and artificial intelligence, comes direct, courtesy of Wikipedia… “Alan Mathison Turing (1912‑1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general‑purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.”\n\nDuring World War II, civilian Alan Turing worked as a codebreaker based at the Government Code and Cypher School at the Bletchley Park country estate in Buckinghamshire, England. While there, Turing devised complex techniques for breaking German ciphers used by the Nazi’s military encryption device, the Enigma Machine, which had been invented by a German engineer Arthur Scherbius (1878‑1929) shortly after WWI. The Germans were confident that the system could not be broken. However, in 1942‑1943, Turing and his colleagues played a vital part in successfully cracking intercepted German encoded messages transmitted using the Enigma Machine. Turing’s historic achievements enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in, particularly, the Battle of the Atlantic (1939‑1945).\n\nAfter the end of the war in 1945, Turing invented the Automatic Computing Machine the world’s first digital computer capable of using stored programs. By 1950, Turing developed an experiment to gauge the ‘intelligence’ of a computer. His simple test requires that a human being should be unable to distinguish the machine from another human being by evaluating replies to questions put to both. The Turing Test, as it was known, is still regarded as a fundamental benchmark for assessing machine intelligence.\n\n“Artificial Intelligence is what we don’t know how to do yet” – Alan Kay (American computer scientist)\n\nDefining Artificial Intelligence\n\nNow for the techy bit… Sorry, bear with me. The term ‘artificial intelligence’ was first used in 1956 at a Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence held at Dartmouth College, a private Ivy League research university based in Hanover, New Hampshire, USA. The conference was organised by computer scientist and Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, John McCarthy (1927‑2011). The project proposed, “that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it”.\n\nIn 1958, American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt (1928‑1971) outlined what he regarded as “the first machine which is capable of having an original idea”. Rosenblatt’s concept was the ‘Perceptron’, a program inspired by the way the human brain works, which ran on a state‑of‑the‑art IBM mainframe computer. The Perceptron was a rudimentary version of a neural network, comprising interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and learn from data, enabling tasks such as pattern recognition and decision making. Rosenblatt was regarded as ‘the father of deep learning’.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, computer scientists and neuroscientists were already teaching computers how to mimic human decision‑making processes, which developed into research around what is known today as ‘machine learning’.\n\n“If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t” – Emerson M. Pugh (American physicist)\n\nIn 1997, IBM’s ‘Deep Blue’, an expert chess program running on a unique, purpose‑built IBM supercomputer, beat the Russian chess grandmaster, Garry Kasparov, leading to the description of rules‑based ‘Traditional AI’. While Deep Blue may have been excellent at playing chess, its talents were capable of little else.\n\n“AI is the most exciting tech of our time” – Tim Cook (CEO, Apple Inc.)\n\nArtificial Intelligence is now a mainstream branch of computer science that refers to IT systems capable of performing complex tasks that attempt to replicate human thought and intelligence. AI’s systematic tasks include analysing data, identifying patterns, recognising speech, solving problems, proposing solutions and taking decisions.\n\n“Artificial intelligence is one of the most profound things we’re working on as humanity. It is more profound than fire or electricity” – Sundar Pichai (CEO, Google and Alphabet Inc.)\n\nAs of early 2024, not all AIs are created equal. Traditional AI (a.k.a. Weak AI or Narrow AI) is an umbrella term for computer systems that employ supervised learning and discriminative models to solve specific tasks using predefined rules, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\n“Denial is the most predictable of all human responses” – the character The Architect from ‘The Matrix’ (1999)\n\nThe category of AI that we will be looking at in this article is called Generative AI, also referred to as GenAI or GAI, which is a relatively new subset of AI. Generative AI allows users to input a variety of prompts to generate content, such as text, images, videos, sounds, 3D designs and other types of media.\n\n“We’re living in the golden age of AI” – Jeff Bezos (founder, Amazon)\n\nThe distinctive aspect of GAI is that it uses unsupervised deep machine learning models to generate new material based on patterns of data acquired from existing sources. GAI models work on large unlabelled data sets that require complex mathematical algorithms and a great deal of computing power to analyse and build constructs.\n\n“While AI has tremendous potential to transform industries, we must not forget the impact it could have on society and must work to mitigate potential risks” – Elon Musk (CEO, Tesla and SpaceX)\n\nGenerative AI models don’t stand still; they continue to evolve at an increasingly rapid rate, as they learn from additional data as it becomes available. It is the quality of the data sets that enable the AI to predict responsible outcomes and undertake a range of cognitive tasks in the same way that a human might.\n\n“The question is not whether intelligent machines can have any emotions, but whether machines can be intelligent without any emotions” – Marvin Minsky (American computer scientist, MIT)\n\nOver time, it is inevitable that GAI’s ability will catch up with, and ultimately surpass, that of humans. The nature, pace and potential of GAI is causing concern among some experts and policy makers because of the moral and ethical issues it raises, particularly if AI’s unbridled behaviour is not moderated in some way by responsible human intervention. The risks of uncontrolled or poorly controlled AI models are swiftly becoming both tangible and potentially unsafe.\n\n“We should not be afraid of AI. Instead, we should hope for the amazing amount of good it will do in the world” – Mark Zuckerberg (founder, Meta Inc.)\n\nSo, the next question is, what comes after GAI? Well, GAI still has a long way to go and that will keep innovators such as OpenAI and Deep Mind hard at work pushing the boundaries of what is possible for some time yet. After that, the most likely development would be Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial General Superintelligence (AGS). The aim is to build a device that can do anything the human brain can do (and more) and to integrate that with the rapidly developing parallel field of advanced robotics to create a machine that can do anything the human body can do (and more). Scary? Super intelligent super robots may well finally demonstrate that yesterday’s science fiction is becoming today’s science fact.\n\n“I am in the camp that is concerned about superintelligence. But I don’t think we need to be fatalistic about it” Bill Gates (founder, Microsoft)\n\nHowever, let’s not get bogged down by credible or fanciful conspiracy theories and get back to the matter in hand.\n\nApplying Artificial Intelligence to the world of vintage guitars\n\nPhew! Back to basics and more familiar territory. After all that preliminary exposition, I think we can all probably agree that AI is one of topical themes of the first half of the 2020s. Not wishing to be left behind, I thought CRAVE Guitars should try to get AI to respond to a series of questions about my favourite topic, vintage guitars. From my experience so far, all that the easily accessible public AI (as opposed to military‑grade AI) can do is to extract information that is already available on the Internet (whether right or wrong) and to compose it into straightforward responses to an input.\n\nBefore we start, I will lay my cards on the table and state my starting position, which, may or may not change by the time this article has concluded. My naïve biological brain came up with eight statements that set out what AI does not (or cannot) currently do. In my view, AI struggles…\n\nTo understand a question correctly without over‑specificity (i.e. it can’t deal with vague ambiguity)\n\nTo interpret and extrapolate relevant information objectively within a wider context (i.e. the bigger picture)\n\nTo present a cogent argument that can adequately be judged and/or challenged\n\nTo form a genuine opinion from scratch without relevant information being readily available in the first place, in the same way that a person might do in the case of uncertainty (i.e. its ability to make genuinely informed assumptions from limited information)\n\nTo debate the initial result to achieve a potentially better outcome (i.e. to learn from the interaction on the spot and adjust its responses accordingly)\n\nTo produce a creative response that improves on the original information input by humans\n\nTo remember what it has already output (i.e. as part of a continuous ‘dialogue’ – as here – each question is treated as a new subject with no memory of previous questions)\n\nTo understand fully what humans want or expect from ‘intelligence’ (i.e. something coherent and interesting)\n\nAssessing AI’s responses against those eight points is this article’s main challenge.\n\nBelow, I pose 20 (plus 2) questions to AI and present its verbatim response to each question (bar correcting the occasional heinous ‘typo’ or bad grammar, which in itself is a bit ironic!), so that you can judge for yourselves just how close AI might be to succeeding at transcending its silicon‑based electronic components (‘deus ex machina’ – god from the machine – if you will). More importantly, you can gauge whether AI can make any sense of the intricately complex subject of vintage guitars. So… can AI pass the CRAVE Guitars Test? We’ll see.\n\nThere are no images in the main part of this article. AI did not present any pictures to support its answers, so I haven’t embellished the words with anything additional, as it might skew the results. What you see below is what I got, no more, no less; untainted in any way.\n\nThe material presented here is not appropriated as belonging to, or being the view of CRAVE Guitars in any way; it is presented here solely for information, intellectual evaluation and critique.\n\n“Change is never painful, only the resistance to change is painful” Buddha (Siddhārtha Gautama ‑ c.480‑400BCE)\n\nRight. That’s my involvement pretty much at an end for now. I’m off to make a cup of tea or ten. See you again at the end of the article with my appraisal of how I think AI did.\n\n20 Questions about vintage guitars posed to AI\n\nQuestion #1 – What is the definition of a vintage guitar?\n\nAI Response #1 – A vintage guitar is an older guitar that is usually sought after and maintained by avid collectors or musicians. The term can indicate either that an instrument is merely old or that it is sought after for its tonal quality, cosmetic appearance, or historical significance.

Originality matters.\n\nAvoid: Instruments with replaced pickups, bridges, or tuners.\n\nInflated Expectations:\n\nPatience Required: Vintage guitars appreciate slowly. Don’t expect rapid returns.\n\nAvoid: Assuming every old guitar will skyrocket in value.\n\nRemember, research is your best ally. Seek advice from experts, explore reputable dealers, and play the guitars yourself. Whether you’re strumming for passion or profit, choose wisely!\n\nQuestion #11 – What vintage guitars are likely to become more desirable in the next 5 years?\n\nAI Response #11 – The world of vintage guitars is a fascinating blend of history, craftsmanship, and musical magic. While predicting the future is akin to tuning an old guitar by ear, here are some intriguing candidates that might appreciate in value over the next five years:\n\nGibson Les Paul Signature (1974):\n\nOften overlooked, the Les Paul Signature from the ’70s has hidden potential. Its versatility shines through various genres, especially when cranked through a Marshall amp. Keep an eye out for these criminally underrated semi‑hollow beauties.\n\nFender Starcaster (1976–80):\n\nOriginally overshadowed, the Fender Starcaster has gained traction. Ted Turner of Wishbone Ash fame owned one, and its unique pickups contribute to its allure. Expect further value appreciation in the coming decades.\n\nSilvertone 1446 (1960s):\n\nCrafted by Harmony, the Silvertone 1446 boasts Gibson‑made pickups with a distinct tone. It may not be the most refined instrument, but its sound and sexiness compensate. A vintage gem that could resonate with collectors.\n\nKay K775 Jazz II (1960s):\n\nEric Clapton’s early learning ground, the Kay K775 Jazz II, is gaining recognition. Despite Kay’s quality control reputation, this bolt‑on neck thinline surprises with its laminated figured maple top, Bigsby vibrato, and Barney Kessel–designed Kleenex Box single‑coils. A naughty guitar indeed.\n\nSupro and Kay Archtops:\n\nThese old Supro and Kay guitars remain undervalued. While the overall vintage market fluctuates, these archtops haven’t fully rebounded. Their unique character and historical significance make them intriguing investments.\n\nRemember, the guitar market dances to its own rhythm, influenced by players, trends, and nostalgia. Whether you strum for passion or profit, let your heart guide your choices.\n\nQuestion #12 – What is the sort of return on investment that one might expect from collecting vintage guitars?\n\nAI Response #12 – Collecting vintage guitars can indeed be a rewarding investment, combining passion for music with potential financial gains. Let’s explore why vintage guitars are an excellent strategy:\n\nTangible and Attractive:\n\nVintage guitars provide more than just financial value. They’re tangible pieces of history, beautiful to display, and enjoyable to collect.\n\nUnlike stocks or bonds, you can admire and play them.\n\nStability and Appreciation:\n\nVintage guitars have consistently outperformed the stock market in terms of stability.\n\nAs they age, their value tends to appreciate, provided you maintain them well.\n\nSuperior Craftsmanship:\n\nVintage guitars often surpass modern counterparts in quality. They were meticulously crafted using fine materials.\n\nBrands like Gibson Les Paul, Fender Telecaster, and CF Martin remain popular among collectors.\n\nGuitar Brands to Consider:\n\nGibson Les Paul: These older models, made of oak, mahogany, and other fine materials, are highly sought after.\n\nFender: Look for ’50s and ’60s Telecasters, Stratocasters, and Thunderbirds.\n\nCF Martin: Known for their acoustic excellence, Martin guitars from the 1960s hold significant value.\n\nGuild: Although less famous, older Guild instruments are on par with Martin guitars of the same era.\n\nInvestment Potential:\n\nWhile not every vintage guitar will skyrocket in value, a well‑chosen collection can yield substantial returns.\n\nResearch, learn about the models, and make informed decisions.\n\nRemember, whether you’re a musician or simply appreciate the beauty of old guitars, vintage instruments offer a harmonious blend of passion and investment potential.\n\nQuestion #13 – Are vintage guitars better than new guitars?\n\nAI Response #13 – Vintage guitars and new guitars each have their own merits, and the answer depends on various factors. Let’s explore both sides:\n\nVintage Guitars:\n\nHistorical Charm: Vintage guitars carry a sense of history and nostalgia. Owning an instrument that has been played by legendary musicians can be emotionally rewarding.\n\nUnique Tone: Some vintage guitars have aged tone woods that resonate differently. The wood dries out over time, leading to a more resonant tone with better sustain, especially in acoustic guitars.\n\nCollectability: Rare models or those associated with iconic artists tend to appreciate in value over time.\n\nNew Guitars:\n\nAdvancements in Craftsmanship: Modern manufacturing techniques have improved significantly. CNC machines and precision tools allow for consistent builds.\n\nReliability: New guitars are generally more reliable. They undergo rigorous quality control and benefit from advancements in materials and construction.\n\nCustomisation: Custom shop guitars offer the best of both worlds. You can get a new guitar tailored to your preferences, combining vintage aesthetics with modern playability.\n\nQuality Comparison:\n\nSubtle Differences: Vintage guitars may have unique quirks due to handcrafted processes. For example, old Les Pauls had smaller frets and thicker necks.\n\nPrecision and Consistency: Modern CNC machines ensure precise fretwork and consistent results. Every Gibson today goes through a PLEK machine for levelling and crowning frets within micrometers.\n\nSubjectivity:\n\n‘Better’ Is Relative: The definition of ‘better’ varies. It’s subjective and depends on personal preferences.\n\nPlayability: Some players prefer the feel of vintage necks, while others enjoy the sleekness of modern profiles.\n\nIn summary, both vintage and new guitars have their place. Whether you seek historical charm, unique tones, or cutting‑edge craftsmanship, choose based on your playing style, preferences, and budget.\n\nQuestion #14 – Should vintage guitars be used or preserved in museums?\n\nAI Response #14 – Vintage guitars, like ancient manuscripts or Renaissance paintings, straddle the delicate balance between utility and preservation. Let’s explore both perspectives:\n\nPlaying and Using Vintage Guitars:\n\nSonic Legacy: Vintage guitars were crafted to be played. Their rich tones, unique characteristics, and historical significance come alive when strummed or picked.\n\nMusical Connection: Owning a vintage instrument allows musicians to channel the spirit of past players. It’s a bridge across time and genres.\n\nArt in Action: A vintage guitar’s true purpose is to create music. It yearns for fingers on frets, resonating strings, and melodies that echo through decades.\n\nPreserving Vintage Guitars in Museums:\n\nCultural Artefacts: Museums safeguard our collective heritage. Vintage guitars, like ancient artefacts, tell stories of creativity, craftsmanship, and musical evolution.\n\nEducational Value: Displaying vintage instruments educates visitors about music history, luthiery techniques, and the evolution of sound.\n\nConservation: Museums provide controlled environments, protecting guitars from wear, humidity, and light damage.\n\nA Harmonious Balance:\n\nRotating Exhibits: Some museums allow playable vintage guitars in temporary exhibits. Musicians can strum them, and visitors appreciate their beauty.\n\nReplicas and Demonstrations: Museums can create replicas for hands‑on experiences while preserving the originals.\n\nDigital Archives: Recordings, videos, and virtual tours can complement physical displays.\n\nIn the grand symphony of cultural preservation, vintage guitars play a vital note. Whether they resonate in concert halls or rest behind glass, their melodies continue to echo through time.\n\nQuestion #15 – Are collectors a good or bad thing for vintage guitars?\n\nAI Response #15 – Collectors, like the silent guardians of a musical time capsule, wield both light and shadow upon the vintage guitar realm. Let us strum through their impact:\n\nThe Good Harmony:\n\nPreservation: Collectors cradle vintage guitars, shielding them from the ravages of time. These instruments whisper secrets of bygone eras.\n\nCurators of History: They curate private museums, preserving luthiery artistry and the soulful echoes of past players.\n\nFinancial Support: By investing in rare models, collectors contribute to the market’s stability and encourage craftsmanship.\n\nThe Dissonant Notes:\n\nInaccessibility: Some vintage guitars languish behind velvet ropes, yearning for calloused fingertips. Their music remains unheard.\n\nPrice Inflation: Collectors can inflate prices, making it harder for musicians to acquire playable vintage instruments.\n\nFrozen Artefacts: When guitars become mere artefacts, their purpose shifts from music‑making to display.\n\nThe Ongoing Duet:\n\nBalance: Collectors must harmonize preservation with accessibility. Rotate exhibits, allow touch, and share the magic.\n\nCollaboration: Collaborate with musicians, luthiers, and enthusiasts. Let vintage guitars sing in live performances.\n\nLegacy: Remember that these guitars once graced stages, studios, and hearts. Their legacy transcends wood and strings.\n\nIn the grand symphony of vintage guitars, collectors play a vital role. May they strum chords of reverence and resonance, bridging past and present.\n\nQuestion #16 – What is the best advice for someone considering collecting vintage guitars?\n\nAI Response #16 – Collecting vintage guitars is a harmonious blend of passion, history, and craftsmanship. Whether you’re a seasoned collector or just starting out, here’s some valuable advice:\n\nDo Your Homework:\n\nKnow Your Instruments: Dive deep into the guitars you’re interested in. Understand their history, features, and quirks.\n\nLearn Anomalies: Beyond books and the internet, explore anomalies not widely documented. Sometimes, hidden gems lie in those details.\n\nConnect with Experts:\n\nTrustworthy Sources: Build relationships with reputable dealers, collectors, and experts. Seek advice and learn from their experience.\n\nAvoid Shady Sellers: Beware of untrustworthy sources. Not everyone has the same integrity in this world of vintage guitars.\n\nBrand Matters:\n\nCollectible Brands: Focus on heritage brands like Fender and Gibson. These classics tend to rise in value over time.\n\nRickenbackers: Often overlooked, Rickenbackers (played by the Beatles, Byrds, and Tom Petty) offer great American‑made guitars at reasonable prices.\n\nAvoid eBay Frenzies:\n\nWhile eBay is a treasure trove, it can also be a frenzy of bidding. Be cautious and aware of shill bidding.\n\nConsider other platforms and auctions for a more measured approach.\n\nBudget Wisely:\n\nSet a Budget: Determine how much you’re willing to invest. Vintage guitars can range from affordable to astronomical.\n\nQuality Over Quantity: Rather than amassing many guitars, focus on quality pieces that resonate with you.\n\nRemember, collecting vintage guitars is not just about financial gain; it’s about connecting with music history and craftsmanship. Let your heart guide your collection, and may each guitar sing its unique melody in your hands!\n\nQuestion #17 – What are good criteria for evaluating whether to buy a vintage guitar?\n\nAI Response #17 – When considering buying a vintage guitar, it’s essential to assess various factors to ensure you’re making an informed decision. Here are some valuable criteria to evaluate:\n\nCheck The Frets:\n\nExamine the condition of the frets. Worn frets can significantly impact playability.\n\nConsider the cost of refretting if necessary. Lacquer issues on maple fingerboards may also need attention.\n\nElectrical Components:\n\nDon’t be alarmed by minor crackling or cutouts in the electronics.\n\nVintage guitars often need a little love in this area. Budget for potential repairs.\n\nMoving Parts and Hardware:\n\nInspect tuners, bridges, and other hardware. Ensure they function smoothly.\n\nSome vintage parts may be hard to find or expensive to replace.\n\nCosmetic Condition:\n\nDon’t judge a book by its cover. Sometimes slightly worn or ‘cosmetically ropey’ guitars sound better.\n\nLook beyond surface imperfections and focus on playability and resonance.\n\nResearch and Knowledge:\n\nUnderstand the specific model you’re interested in. Learn about its history, features, and common issues.\n\nRead reviews, consult experts, and explore online resources.\n\nBudget Realistically:\n\nSet a budget that considers not only the purchase price but also potential repairs or upgrades.\n\nVintage guitars often require adjustments to optimize playability.\n\nRemember, vintage guitars are more than just instruments; they carry stories, character, and a connection to music history. Let your passion guide you, and may your chosen guitar resonate with your soul!\n\nQuestion #18 – How to detect a fake from an authentic vintage guitar?\n\nAI Response #18 – When evaluating a vintage guitar for authenticity, keep these criteria in mind:\n\nWeight:\n\nAuthentic guitars have consistent weights based on their model and wood type.\n\nCompare the weight of the guitar you’re examining with the average weight for that model.\n\nGuitar Logo:\n\nDownload an image of the authentic model’s logo from the manufacturer’s website.\n\nCompare it with the logo on the guitar you’re considering. Look for differences in size, shape, position, font, and staining around the logo.\n\nComponents and Hardware:\n\nInspect tuners, bridges, and other hardware. Authentic guitars use specific components.\n\nBe cautious if anything looks off or doesn’t match the original model.\n\nSound hole (for Acoustic Guitars):\n\nAuthentic acoustic guitars have perfectly round and symmetrical sound holes.\n\nIf the sound hole appears irregular or poorly crafted, it might be a fake.\n\nSerial Number:\n\nCheck the guitar’s serial number against databases or guides specific to the brand.\n\nSerial numbers can reveal the guitar’s production year and authenticity.\n\nConsult Experts:\n\nSeek advice from reputable dealers, collectors, or luthiers.\n\nThey can spot subtle details that indicate authenticity.\n\nRemember, a genuine vintage guitar carries history and soul. Whether you’re a player or collector, choose wisely and let the music resonate!\n\nQuestion #19 – Are vintage bass guitars worth collecting?\n\nAI Response #19 – Vintage bass guitars, like the heartbeat of a rhythm section, resonate with their own allure. Let’s explore why they’re worth collecting:\n\nHistorical Significance:\n\nVintage basses carry the pulse of music history. They’ve grooved through genres, recording studios, and live performances.\n\nOwning one connects you to the basslines of legends like James Jamerson, Jaco Pastorius, and Paul McCartney.\n\nTonal Character:\n\nEach vintage bass has a unique voice. The wood, pickups, and craftsmanship contribute to its signature sound.\n\nWhether it’s the thump of a Fender Precision Bass or the growl of a Rickenbacker 4001, vintage basses offer distinct tones.\n\nInvestment Potential:\n\nWhile not all vintage basses appreciate significantly, certain models do.\n\nBrands like Fender, Gibson, and Music Man have iconic basses that hold value.\n\nCraftsmanship:\n\nVintage basses were meticulously built by skilled luthiers. Their attention to detail and quality materials shine through.\n\nThe patina of age adds character, like the lines on a seasoned musician’s face.\n\nCollectability:\n\nSome basses are rare due to limited production runs or unique features.\n\nCollectors seek these gems, creating demand and driving up prices.\n\nPlaying Experience:\n\nVintage basses feel different. Their neck profiles, weight, and balance offer a tactile experience.\n\nWhether you’re a player or a collector, the joy of plucking those strings transcends time.\n\nIn the rhythm of life, vintage bass guitars provide the low notes that anchor melodies. Let your passion guide your collection, and may your basslines resonate!\n\nQuestion #20 – What is CRAVE Guitars?\n\nAI Response #20 – CRAVE Guitars is a fascinating venture that celebrates and showcases vintage American electric guitars, effects, and amplifiers. Let me break it down for you:\n\nName and Acronym:\n\nThe name ‘CRAVE’ is a clever play on words.\n\nAs an acronym, it stands for ‘Cool & Rare American Vintage Electric’ guitars.\n\nLiterally, it also means ‘to yearn for’ or ‘to want greatly’.\n\nAll these meanings are fitting for the world of vintage guitars.\n\nMission and Focus:\n\nCRAVE Guitars aims to bring you some of the coolest American vintage electric guitars from iconic brands like Fender and Gibson, among others.\n\nThese guitars aren’t necessarily the most expensive or desirable ones but definitely have that special something that makes them stand out.\n\nNon‑Profit Approach:\n\nUnlike traditional dealers or collectors, CRAVE Guitars is a non‑profit enterprise.\n\nIt celebrates vintage guitars both as important musical heritage and as real instruments meant to be used and played.\n\nThe focus is on more affordable, underdog, and often quirky vintage guitars, effects, and amps.\n\nInstead of the exotic and rarely played classics, CRAVE Guitars delves into the heart of the vintage guitar world.\n\nWabi‑Sabi and Imperfections:\n\nCRAVE Guitars also embraces the Japanese concept of wabi‑sabi.\n\nWabi‑sabi appreciates the imperfections in objects, finding beauty in their flaws.\n\nVintage guitars, with their unique wear and history, embody this concept.\n\nMore Than Guitars:\n\nBeyond guitars, CRAVE features galleries and information on vintage effect pedals (from brands like Electro‑Harmonix, MXR, BOSS, and Ibanez) and a small collection of vintage American valve amplifiers.\n\nIt’s a treasure trove for guitar enthusiasts and those who appreciate the magic of vintage gear.\n\nSo, if you’re curious or have a craving for all things vintage, explore the world of CRAVE Guitars and immerse yourself in the legacy of these remarkable instruments!\n\nIn addition, I also asked AI 2 supplementary questions relating to vintage amplifiers and vintage effects. Here is what AI put forward, very much in the same vein as the previous examples.\n\nQuestion #21 – Are vintage amplifiers worth collecting?\n\nAI Response #21 – Vintage amplifiers are like sonic time capsules, each carrying a unique story and tone. Here’s why they’re worth collecting:\n\nHistorical Significance:\n\nVintage amps shaped the sound of countless recordings. They’re the secret sauce behind iconic guitar tones.\n\nOwning one connects you to the artists and eras that made music history.\n\nTonal Magic:\n\nVintage amps have a warmth and character that modern counterparts often lack.\n\nWhether it’s the creamy overdrive of a Dumble Overdrive Special or the gritty blues of a Marshall JTM45, vintage amps offer distinct flavours.\n\nInvestment Potential:\n\nWhile not all vintage amps appreciate significantly, certain models do.\n\nBrands like Fender, Marshall, and Trainwreck hold value and continue to inspire players.\n\nCraftsmanship:\n\nThese amps were handcrafted with care, using quality components.\n\nThe patina of age adds to their allure, like the wrinkles on a seasoned musician’s face.\n\nPlaying Experience:\n\nVintage amps respond differently. Their tubes, circuits, and speakers create a tactile connection.\n\nPlug in and feel the magic—the way they react to your playing is unmatched.\n\nSo whether you’re a collector, player, or both, vintage amplifiers offer a symphony of history and sound.\n\nQuestion #22 – Are vintage guitar effect pedals worth collecting?\n\nAI Response #22 – Vintage guitar effect pedals are like hidden treasures waiting to be discovered. Let’s explore their allure:\n\nHistorical Gems:\n\nVintage pedals offer a glimpse into the evolution of effects. They’re like musical fossils, preserving sonic eras.\n\nOwning one connects you to the creativity of past players and the birth of iconic sounds.\n\nTonal Mojo:\n\nEach vintage pedal has a distinct flavour. The analogue circuits, aged components, and quirks create magic.\n\nWhether it’s the warm fuzz of a Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face or the psychedelic swirl of a Uni‑Vibe, vintage pedals offer sonic character.\n\nInvestment Potential:\n\nWhile not every vintage pedal appreciates significantly, some models do.\n\nBrands like Boss, Electro‑Harmonix, and Ibanez have cult classics that hold value.\n\nNostalgia and Inspiration:\n\nVintage pedals evoke memories of classic albums and legendary performances.\n\nPlugging into a vintage pedal can spark creativity and transport you to musical moments.\n\nCollectability:\n\nSome pedals are rare due to limited production or unique features.\n\nCollectors seek these gems, creating demand and driving up prices.\n\nRemember, whether you’re a guitarist, collector, or sonic explorer, vintage pedals offer a symphony of history and sound.\n\n“Strings whisper secrets,\n\nAged wood sings timeless stories,\n\nCrave vintage echoes.”\n\nHhmmmm.\n\nHuman observation and verdict\n\nWell, there you have it. 20+2 questions and 20+2 answers (and a haiku thrown in for good measure). What do you think? Apologies, that’s a rhetorical question. My thoughts on the matter are purely my own opinion based on what I was presented with. I am no expert on AI technology, so my observations are therefore, by nature, liable to organic fallibility and bias. I should state at this point that, in no way did I attempt to outwit or trick the AI models. The questions were very simple and the intent was purely to see what would happen. The results are uncorrupted by me in any way.\n\nThere are some truly cringe worthy phrases buried in amongst the relevant outputs – AI trying to be ‘clever’. AI can’t seem to master the human traits of irony, satire, wit, whimsy and sarcasm! Mind you, AI also doesn’t exhibit the less desirable human traits of arrogance, hubris, deceit (intentionally or innocently) or biased opinion, which is probably a good, although potentially less entertaining, thing. This jocular aspect, however, is a bit like the 17th Century Spanish idiom, ‘the pot calling the kettle black’ (NB. from a 1620 English translation of ‘Don Quixote’ by Miguel de Cervantes), especially given my innate trademark penchant for pretentious prose and affinity for asinine alliterations (QED!).\n\nGiven that simulated responses draw directly on diverse material from a range of (human?) contributors, AI could be accused of plagiarism, as it simply extracts these sources of information and re‑presents them as a rational, objective summary. In terms of credibility, many of the responses make common sense, while others are less believable (see, particularly, the off‑kilter response to Questions #5 and #12).\n\nEach question taken in isolation is one thing but when taken together, the repetitiveness of both content and presentation (and is a dead giveaway that this is not the sort of rational intercourse that would take place between, say, a knowledgeable human interviewer and interviewee. It simply wouldn’t be like that in practice.\n\nAre there any factual errors exposed through this process? Not necessarily (although the reference to older Gibson Les Pauls being made of oak in response to question #12 is peculiar). However, this question does raise the issue of interpretation, i.e. the action of explaining the meaning of something. Inevitably, some perspective may be gleaned from information that is neither technically true nor false, especially where that information is dependent on subjective opinion and/or ambiguity that is difficult to corroborate or prove. The interpretation issue may constrain the ability of AI methodology to explore subject matter diligently and thoroughly in the way a human investigation might. While arguably forensic, it clearly isn’t ‘thoughtful’ in its approach.\n\nThe responses generally seem to be ‘playing it safe’, as though AI’s output was written by a committee to iron out any wayward emphases. The sanitised responses may well be useful as a starting point for a novice or someone lacking knowledge about the subject. It doesn’t, however, add anything over and above the basic level of human understanding. AI wouldn’t really impress someone who knows what they are talking about, let alone an expert.\n\n“That’s how it is with people. Nobody cares how it works as long as it works” – The character Councillor Hamann from The Matrix (1999)\n\nAI seems unable to extend a concept beyond the current boundaries of the question. It may be able to develop ‘vision’ at some point but clearly not yet. AI also seems unable to distinguish between poor, acceptable or high quality information – it is innately non‑sceptical of what it is fed with, leading potentially to unreliable outputs. AI currently depends heavily on humans to contribute and moderate content and that is another limitation at the time of writing, perhaps inhibiting its more creative potential. In some ways, AI avoids the question, again, the response to Question #12 doesn’t indicate the range of ROI that one might anticipate from investing.\n\nWhat the responses do is to focus solely (unnaturally?) on the subject matter without even a hint of the possibility of a wider context. The ‘big picture’ omission struck me throughout the exercise. The current new gear market is strongly oriented – almost obsessively (and irritatingly) so – toward stressing the ‘vintage’ qualities, characteristics and specifications of brand new gear. Many new products are clearly aimed at imitating as closely as possible the idiosyncrasies and technological limitations of the past, frequently as if that is the only game in town. The current new guitar marketplace is not really progressive and, in many cases is clearly regressive. No reference to this marketing incongruity exists in the responses. The vintage past is not actually ‘authentically recreated’ in new products. AI therefore comes across as past‑oriented, not future‑focused.\n\nOne of the conundrums with AI at the time of writing is actually how these supposedly intelligible responses were compiled. Presumably, as AI simply mines information originally created by humans (expert or otherwise) in one form or another at some point in time, its generated outputs are not genuinely ‘new’. AI couldn’t possibly conjure a believable level of detail out of an information vacuum, it had to have something from which to start.\n\nThe ‘memory’ question is a big issue for AI. When asked basically the same question twice, either consecutively or separated by others, AI will respond to the second question as if the first had not been asked. A human would either, say “I’ve already answered that” or would respond in a slightly different way. AI lacks nuance and is totally oblivious of the regurgitation issue. It seems incapable of a continuing dialogue without tripping up.\n\nThe extent to which the human input has been manipulated by AI isn’t readily made clear. One therefore might wonder what was omitted (or added) and what was the result of machine intervention? Also, how did AI decide what should and shouldn’t be processed and the methodology by which it is output? What would AI come up with if it had nothing at all on which to base its algorithmic recipe?\n\nQuestion – What will happen when AI starts building information based on the output of another AI over several iterations? It would be like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy, etc. Does the integrity of information degrade significantly as it is repeatedly manipulated such that it bears little or no relationship to the authentic original (i.e. much like artificial Chinese whispers)?\n\n“Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions…” – the character Agent Brown from The Matrix (1999)\n\nSometimes, less is more and getting something from AI can feel like being bombarded with a relentless barrage of words, rather than selective profound insight (hypocritically guilty as charged!). It is like the difference between learning by rote and repeating facts compared with genuinely understanding a subject matter through critical reasoning, or like reading a dictionary and expecting to comprehend the real world. The responses are more like a pre‑prepared structured lecture based on a text book exemplar, rather than a process of meaningful critical analysis and acute deductive reasoning.\n\nAI is clearly getting a lot closer to human behaviour than simple search results from any standard Internet search engine and it will undoubtedly get better. However, it is not (yet) the last word on the matter. There is something to be gained from the responses, as long as they are taken as one of many inputs into a conclusion, rather than to be taken as a determining factor. My advice, for what it is worth, is to consider what AI presents you with but always take it with a figurative ‘pinch of salt’ (NB. yet another idiom; ‘a grain of salt’, from Pliny the Elder’s ‘Naturalis Historia’, 77CE). A genuine fascination with the subject matter – vintage guitars – is as much about subjective experience as it is about objective black and white bullet point facts. Currently, as far as I’m aware, that degree of authentic articulation of ‘shades of grey’ (i.e. sometimes reality is subtle and complex, and the boundaries are not always clear‑cut) cannot be gained readily from the Internet, AI or no AI.\n\n“The deepest sin against the human mind is to believe things without evidence” – Aldous Huxley (American author, 1894‑1963)\n\nWhile the AI processes are undoubtedly impressive, did AI inspire or stimulate curiosity as a skilled mentor might? Categorically not. Did I actually learn anything new about vintage guitars from AI? Nope. But then again, I believe, somewhat conceitedly, that I was already reasonably well informed on the topic.\n\n“AI will be the most transformative technology of the 21st century. It will affect every industry and aspect of our lives” – Jensen Huang of Nvidia Corporation\n\nFinal thoughts on AI\n\nIn conclusion, I would suggest that AI as it stands, at least on this specific subject matter fails the Turing Test as described at the start of this article. It comes across as ‘artificial’ and the sort of assignment a student might construct from prima facie sources without thought, genuine research, analysis, insight or intellect. The clincher for me was AI’s derivative description of CRAVE Guitars, which isn’t presented as a narrative and not at all how I would (and have) articulated it.\n\nSo… Cutting to the chase, how would I rate AI’s responses compared to say, the responses of a specialist to the same questions. Probably, I’d give it about a 5‑6 out of 10 and that is, I think, being generous. AI is leaps and bounds ahead of standard Internet search engine results but still a long way behind what I would expect a rational, knowledgeable human professional to say, not necessarily in terms of what is said but definitely in how it is said. AI could do better (and it definitely will, believe me). It may best be described as ‘work‑in‑progress’.\n\nI posited my starting position at the top of this article, written before embarking on this extravaganza. Reading it again after disembarking, my view has not shifted substantially and I think those eight criteria remain relevant, at least as of March 2024. Perhaps I am falling foul of ‘confirmation bias’, another human flaw. My bad.\n\nPutting it bluntly, AI comes across as having no personality. Some sort of identifiable persona is, I believe, a prerequisite for passing the Turing test. Without a sense of character, AI will always seem a dry, clumsy imitation of an average human. Arguably, AI just wasn’t convincing as being interested in the subject matter. For now, I’ll stick with ‘natural stupidity’, thanks.\n\nLike the character Sarah Connor inaccurately forecast in James Cameron’s 1991 film ‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’, AI didn’t quite get it right, “Three billion human lives ended on August 29, 1997”. Skynet hasn’t grown up… yet. Thankfully.\n\nCRAVE Guitars’ ‘Album of the Month’\n\nI am not going anywhere near the mechanistic and sterile AI for this section of the article. Consequently, I’m going for one of the most organic and natural sounding albums I know (and like). Once again, it is a fairly well‑known recording, so nothing obscure or inaccessible this time around.\n\nCowboy Junkies – The Trinity Session (1988) – The second album from the Canadian alt‑country band, recorded live in the Church Of The Holy Trinity in Toronto in November 1987 and released in 1988. Its atmospheric beauty is partly due to its imperfections and the natural reverb of the building, all captured by a single microphone. The raw recording was purportedly not adulterated, mixed, overdubbed or edited in any way. Interestingly, the sublime, ‘Blue Moon Revisited (Song For Elvis)’ wasn’t on the original vinyl release. While not to everyone’s tastes (and otherwise probably not normally to mine either), it represents fifty three minutes of exquisite alchemy. It is 100% human in all its gentle, fragile, ragged glory – in a good way. It is hard to envisage AI ever coming up with music like this, now or in the future.\n\nTailpiece\n\nPhew! That is way more than enough from me and my erstwhile AI co‑author for now. Please don’t blame me for the majority of this outing, it is mostly down to the synthetic nature of its creation. I must admit that, while a very interesting little (?!?!) project, it was ultimately a bit (?!?!) of a long and arduous slog, bordering on boring (sorry folks). I trust you can discern what was written by me and what was produced by AI.\n\nFinally, a word of sagely counsel. Whatever we do, humanity should always strive to harness the potential of output AI/GAI/AGI for good and to guard against the risks of it being exploited for evil.\n\nI also stated at the beginning that is only Part I of this 3‑part AI adventure! Next month, we’ll take a look at another aspect of AI and vintage guitars. I can tell you are eagerly ‘champing at the bit’ (NB. another human idiom; from ‘Joseph, A Religious Poem’ by the Reverend Charles Lucas, 1810)!\n\nTruth, peace, love, music be with you always. Until next time…\n\nCRAVE Guitars’ ‘Quote of the Month’: “Whoever thinks pets are non‑judgemental has clearly never been owned by a cat”\n\n© 2024 CRAVE Guitars – Love Vintage Guitars.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWell, my, my, my… Here we are back again with spring just about to morph into balmy summer. I can’t believe that we are nearly half way through the last year of the 2010s already.\n\nThis means that we are now well into this year’s major music project with article number three of, well, who knows how many at the moment. Such a venture needs breaking down into digestible chunks or it would be colossal as just one bite at the proverbial cherry. The source data is immense, yet still only manages to brush the surface of a monumental subject matter. As always, if there are errors or omissions that I should consider including retrospectively, let me know via e‑mail or the web site’s contact form.\n\nIf you would like to pop in and (re)visit the first two parts of the story to‑date, you can do so here (each link opens a new browser tab):\n\nPart I – 1650‑1900\n\nPart II – 1900‑1919\n\nThe Story of Modern Music Part III 1920-1939\n\nThis month, we start at the beginning of the ‘Roaring Twenties’ and finish at the end of the ‘Dirty Thirties’ (the latter being a moniker apparently associated with the Dustbowl era rather than something inherently naughty – apologies for that!).\n\nThe world had never seen decades like these and hasn’t since. As such, they exhibit polar opposites in human endeavour. These twenty years stand a testimonial to the rapid progress of civilisation while also as a condemnation of the self‑destructive stupidity of the human condition. Hindsight, as ‘they’ say is a wonderful thing, so perhaps we should learn something profound from an examination of our collective past and build a better future for mankind. However, I digress…\n\nThis brings us to the format of this article, which follows the same tripartite structure for each 10‑year span as last month. Each decade is given a broad historical context outlining the sorts of global events – good and bad – that occurred, followed by examples of how music genres emerged and changed over the period and, finally, the whole point of this series, some music facts associated with the same years. As a whole, it hopefully provides an interesting insight into what went on. Here we go…\n\nOne noticeable trait that comes through strongly this month is the number of births occurring in the 1920s and 1930s of people who would go on to be significant musical icons in the 1950s and thereafter. This means that this month’s ‘facts’ are setting the foundation for future articles, while later ones will see a shift to the other, and rather more mortal, end of their illustrious lifetimes.\n\nHistorical Context 1920-1929\n\nThe 1920s was a paradigm shift in global affairs. The ‘Roaring Twenties’ and were characterised by post‑WWI optimism, individualism, industrial and economic growth, as well as social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. However, underlying the positivity was an omnipresent political paranoia, fuelled by conspiracy and corruption that stood a portent of the looming storm clouds that were gathering. The rise of radical political doctrines including communism and fascism would ultimately lead to further international conflict. Women were experiencing greater emancipation as a result of the suffragette movement, paving the way for later equalities movements.\n\nMusical Genre Development 1920-1929\n\nBlues and jazz continued to be popular during the 1920s, the latter sparking the ‘jazzmania’ craze. These twin pillars of modern musical culture also began to spawn new genre styles and to influence a diverse range of musical expression. Record, radio and film companies started to search out new artists and music to bring to a wider audience. It was in 1925 that the electrical recording and the 78rpm vinyl record became standard, the same year that television began, thereby opening up a whole new market for musicians.\n\nIn the 1920s, two separate musical forms emerged from Louisiana in the deep south of the United States, cajun and zydeco. The Cajuns were French colonists, called Acadians, from North Eastern America (Canada and Nova Scotia) who migrated to Louisiana in the late 18th Century, bringing with them Cajun musical traditions. The creole were people descended from the inhabitants of French colonial Louisiana and who developed their own distinct musical style called zydeco. Although often regarded as similar, the two forms developed in parallel and have different cultural origins and styles. Cajun music is often played on accordion and fiddle, while zydeco is usually played on accordion and washboard. Both forms became popular outside insular local communities from the late 1920s when early recordings became available. Stylistic origins derived from blues, jazz, spirituals, traditional folk and country music, as well as regional influences from Europe, Africa, indigenous Americans and the Caribbean. Both cajun and zydeco are often used as dance music, including two‑steps and waltzes. Cajun and zydeco, in turn, influenced other forms of American roots music.\n\nFrom the 1880s, musical theatre such as vaudeville and burlesque were common and very popular. From around 1920, commercial theatrical Broadway musicals originated in New York and London, becoming widespread and attracting big audiences before ‘talkie’ cinema movies began to adopt musical storytelling as a reflection of popular culture. Successful composers of the time included George & Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. Prior to the 1920s most music distribution was by way of sheet music, piano rolls or live performance. It was during the 1920s that recording and distribution of popular music really took off, giving audiences much greater access to a wide range of music. However, the gramophone had strong competition from the proliferation of wireless radio and commercial radio stations during the 1920s, as well as motion pictures. In 1927, the first commercial feature length film to incorporate synchronised music, singing and speech, ‘The Jazz Singer’, starring Al Jolson was released. Broadway musicals reached their zenith in the 1940s with hits such as Oklahoma (1943). The convergence and crossover between Broadway and cinema musicals became a major launch pad for musical dissemination into the 1950s and beyond, including the development of soundtrack compositions for film and, later, television.\n\nCountry music was another genre that emerged from the Appalachian Mountain region of southern and eastern America during the 1920s, particularly in Tennessee but also Oklahoma and Texas. The roots of country music came largely from traditional genres such as folk, blues, hillbilly and western music, and was heavily influenced by Irish, English and wider European immigrants to the American east and south. Early popular country music, including cowboy songs, were often regarded as the music of the American rural working classes. Popular establishments for hillbilly music were the rowdy honky‑tonk bars of the period. Country music comprised of song ballads and dances normally constructed from simple arrangements, lyrics that told a story, and vocal harmonies. In addition country music accompaniment was usually provided by an array of acoustic string instruments such as banjos, guitars and fiddles as well as harmonicas and Jews harps. Early pioneers of country music included Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family, followed by other famous artists such as Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton. Country music is a massive commercial industry, now largely centred on Nashville, Tennessee. Country music is a diverse musical form of expression and continues to evolve, having seen several resurgences of popularity since its early heyday.\n\nMusical Facts 1920-1929\n\nBert Weedon\n\nHistorical Context 1930-1939\n\nAfter a period of relative peace during the 1920s, the ‘Dirty Thirties’ followed. The harshness of the global recession set in, resulting in widespread unemployment, hardship, deprivation and poverty. The catalysts for descent of the globe’s major industrialised countries into a second and even more destructive world war had been seeded and, despite progress in other areas of human civilisation such as science, technology and art, the political die was already cast. Expansionist agendas fuelled Fascism in Europe, which coalesced into the rise of the Third Reich in Germany and its Axis power allies, while communism was also on the rise.\n\nMusical Genre Development 1930-1939\n\nMusic of the 1930s was largely characterised by social events such as the Great Depression and the growth in popularity of radio and Hollywood cinema, which began to replace Broadway musical theatre. Established genres such as jazz continued to evolve to reflect changes in social culture, giving birth to swing and big band music. Jump blues music began to appear in the 1930s, adapting the grand swing and big band music for smaller venues, performed by small bands. The 1930s also saw the introduction of the electric guitar, which began to play a part in evolution of popular music of the decade.\n\nHawaiian music was popular with mainstream audiences in America during the 1930s, even though it had been a major genre in the mid-Pacific since the late 19th Century. Hawaiian music was important because of its influence on country music, including the introduction of the lap steel guitar, often played horizontally and using a slide. It also helped to shape Polynesian music across the Pacific islands.\n\nTraditional folk music has been an enduring form of musical expression throughout the centuries, in many nations and regions across the globe. Historically, folk music is often regarded as an oral tradition being handed down by word of mouth over many generations. During the 1930s, contemporary folk music, an Anglo‑American acoustic style, experienced a revival, often commenting about social issues including war, work, civil unrest, economic hardship, as well as love songs and non‑topical comedy themes. As the roots of folk music predate many modern musical genres, influences came from all over the world, imported by immigrants to America from Europe and Asia, as well as traditional songs used by African slaves. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, America in particular experienced a booming folk scene. The record industry began to exploit folk songs as an alternative to other popular genres. One of the most significant folk singer/songwriters of the generation was Woody Guthrie, whose work in the 1930s and 1940s was often seen as a protest against rural injustice, and which has influenced many artists since. Other famous artists from the 1940s to the early 1960s included Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan in America, Donovan, Ralph McTell and Martin Carthy in the UK, as well as Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, and Buffy Sainte-Marie in Canada.\n\nSwing music is a close relative of jazz and has its roots as early as the 1920s, becoming a dominant genre during the 1930s and 1940s, predominantly in urban cities such as Chicago, New York and Kansas City. It is notable because music with a strong ‘swing feel’ became popular dance music, especially in lively clubs that could accommodate swing ensembles. Swing was popularised by big band swing orchestras such as that led by Benny Goodman. Other famous swing artists included Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. The ‘swing era’ lasted for about 10 years from 1935 to 1946, when popularity began to fade during and after World War II. Swing was also hugely influential in popular music with artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. Dance crazes of the swing era included the jitterbug and the shag, which would evolve into dances later associated with genres such as R&B and rock ‘n’ roll. Swing and its derivatives have experienced a number of revivals in subsequent years.\n\nMusical Facts 1930-1939\n\nTailpiece\n\nPhew! That was a bit of a 20‑year roller coaster. However, this still hasn’t got us to point at which ‘modern music’ arguably really begins, i.e. from the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll and will ultimately bring us up‑to‑date. However, it is a fascinating insight into not only what the rapidly growing global population got up to but also how this was inextricably linked to how music was also progressing. Social culture and music are symbiotically interdependent – culture shapes and stimulates music and music reflects and influences culture. The 20 years covered in this article are therefore fundamental building blocks of the unstoppable development that will lead us to rock ‘n’ roll and beyond. The next article will, hopefully, bridge the gap from the start of WWII to the ground-breaking events that would take place in the 1950s.\n\nWatch this space and make sure you tune in, same time same place next month.
