        "meta_description": "To elucidate the pathogenesis of vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), the most common and most severe of congenital brain arteriovenous malformations, we performed an integrated analysis of 310 VOGM proband-family exomes and 336,326 human cerebrovasculature single-cell transcriptomes. We found the Ras suppressor p120 RasGAP (RASA1) harbored a genome-wide significant burden of loss-of-function de novo variants (2042.5-fold, p = 4.79 x 10−7). Rare, damaging transmitted variants were enriched in Ephrin receptor-B4 (EPHB4) (17.5-fold, p = 1.22 x 10−5), which cooperates with p120 RasGAP to regulate vascular development. Additional probands had damaging variants in ACVRL1, NOTCH1, ITGB1, and PTPN11. ACVRL1 variants were also identified in a multi-generational VOGM pedigree. Integrative genomic analysis defined developing endothelial cells as a likely spatio-temporal locus of VOGM pathophysiology. Mice expressing a VOGM-specific EPHB4 kinase-domain missense variant (Phe867Leu) exhibited disrupted developmental angiogenesis and impaired hierarchical development of arterial-capillary-venous networks, but only in the presence of a “second-hit” allele. These results illuminate human arterio-venous development and VOGM pathobiology and have implications for patients and their families. Vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs) are severe congenital brain arteriovenous malformations. Here the authors work to elucidate the pathogenesis of VOGMs by performing an integrated analysis of 310 VOGM proband family exomes and 336,326 human cerebrovasculature single-cell transcriptomes to identify mutations of key signaling regulators.",

        "text": "WES of the largest trio-based VOGM cohort to date\n\nWe ascertained a total of 114 probands with radiographically confirmed VOGM (see Methods) treated by endovascular therapy, including 90 proband-parent trios (each with a single affected offspring), 13 duo cases, and 11 singleton cases (Supplementary Data 1). These included 55 previously described VOGM probands26. Among 114 VOGM probands, 34.2% were female; 78.9% were self-reported Europeans; 60% of probands were diagnosed prenatally or within 1 month after birth; only 3.8% were diagnosed after age 2. Salient features at diagnosis included developmental delay (54%), macrocephaly (48%), hydrocephalus (48%), prominent face and/or scalp vasculature (45%), cutaneous vascular lesions (22%), and congestive heart failure (40%). Also present were structural heart defects (7%), including partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary valve stenosis. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the demographics and clinical features of our VOGM cohort. Supplementary Fig. 1 depicts representative angiographic images of VOGM probands.\n\nDNA was isolated and WES was performed (see Methods)26. In parallel, WES of 1,798 control trios comprising parents and unaffected siblings of autism probands was analyzed49,50 by our published informatics pipeline51. 92.7% or more of targeted bases had ≥8 independent reads in both cases and controls, and 87.8% or more had ≥15 independent reads (see Supplementary Table 2 for exome sequence metrics). Variant calling was performed utilizing a combination of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller52,53 and Freebayes54. Population allele frequencies were annotated by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v.2.1.1) and the BRAVO databases55. De novo variant (DNV) identification was performed by TrioDeNovo56. MetaSVM and MPC algorithms were used to infer the effect of missense variants57,58. Missense variants were considered damaging (D-mis) when predicted as deleterious by MetaSVM or with MPC-score ≥ 2. Inferred loss-of-function (LoF) variants, including stop-gains, stop-losses, frameshift insertions, deletions, and canonical splice-site variants were considered damaging. Variants in genes of interest were validated by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2 and 4).\n\nVariants in CM-AVM genes RASA1 and EPHB4\n\nWe first investigated the contribution of DNVs to VOGM pathogenesis (Supplementary Data 2). The average DNV rate of 1.19 per subject (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3) resembled previous results obtained from a similar sequencing platform39 and followed a Poisson distribution (Supplementary Fig. 5). The burden of DNVs in the control cohort was comparable (Supplementary Table 3). There was no enrichment of synonymous or missense DNVs inferred to be tolerated in VOGM cases. In contrast, D-mis (1.65-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 0.02) and protein-damaging DNVs (LoF + D-mis; 1.50-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 0.02) were enriched among all genes in cases but not in controls (Table 1). RASA1 (probability of loss-of-function intolerance [pLI] = 1.00 in gnomAD v.2.1.1) was the single gene that harbors a genome-wide significant burden of damaging DNVs (2042.5-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 4.79 x 10−7) with two novel LoF DNVs (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 4). The only other gene with more than one protein-altering DNV (p.Gly202Ser and p.Gln321*) was endothelin-3-converting enzyme ECE3 (KEL) (440.7-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 1.03 x 10−5). From the observed fraction of patients with damaging DNVs we infer that damaging DNVs account for >12% of VOGM cases (Table 1 and see Methods).\n\nRASA1, encoding the negative Ras regulator p120 RasGAP59, contained two novel LoF DNVs, p.Arg427* and p.Val527Mfs*16, in unrelated VOGM probands KVOGM71-1 and KVOGM122-1, respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Variants in RASA1 have been implicated in autosomal dominant type 1 capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM1) (OMIM# 608354)60, featuring fast-flow vascular malformations, including systemic and intracranial arteriovenous fistulas and AVMs and, rarely, VOGMs27,30,61. Both KVOGM71-1 and KVOGM122-1 had cutaneous capillary malformations characteristic of CM-AVM type 1. See Supplementary Fig. 6 for available cutaneous manifestations in VOGM probands and their family members.\n\nTo identify additional haploinsufficient genes associated with VOGM undetected by DNV analysis, we next assessed the total burden in all probands of rare (BRAVO minor allele frequency [MAF] ≤5 x 10−5) de novo and transmitted D-mis and LoF variants. The probability of the observed number of rare variants in each gene occurring by chance was calculated by contrasting it with the expected burden, adjusting for gene mutability (see Methods)39. Analysis of damaging variants in all genes revealed a genome-wide significant enrichment (Bonferroni multiple testing threshold = 2.6 x 10−6) of variants in RASA1, with five total rare LoF variants (enrichment = 28.4-fold, one-sided binomial p = 1.20 x 10−6; Supplementary Table 5). In addition to the two de novo LoF variants identified in RASA1 (see above), we identified two transmitted stop-gain variants in RASA1 (p.Arg709* and p.Tyr695*) in unrelated probands. We also found an unphased frameshift variant in RASA1 (p.His743Thrfs*24) (Table 2 and Fig. 1c). Case-control burden analysis for rare damaging variants in all probands versus gnomAD controls showed RASA1 as having a significant mutational burden in VOGM probands (odds ratio (OR) = 67.50 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.76, infinite [Inf]), one-sided Fisher’s p = 2.20 x 10−8) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nRAS proteins cycle between an active guanosine-triphosphate (GTP)-bound form and an inactive, guanosine-diphosphate (GDP)-bound form, as do other guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (including heterotrimeric G proteins). The weak intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS proteins is greatly enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as p120 RasGAP62,63. Similar to other LoF RASA1 variants64, variants encoding the prematurely terminated mutants p.Arg427*, p.Val527Metfs*16, p.Arg709*, p.Tyr695*, and p.His743Thrfs*24 are all predicted to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and consequently increase downstream Ras/ERK/MAPK signaling activity65,66.\n\nWe also identified enrichment in rare, damaging variants in EPHB4, encoding Ephrin receptor B4 (EphB4), which physically interacts and cooperates with p120 RasGAP to limit Ras activation67 (enrichment = 17.5-fold, one-sided binomial p = 1.22 x 10-5; Supplementary Table 5). Case-control gene burden analyses for damaging variants in all probands showed a significant variant burden in EPHB4 versus gnomAD controls (OR = 27.39 (95% CI [10.60, Inf]), one-sided Fisher’s p = 1.65 x 10-6; Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 6). EPHB4 variants25 have been reported in type 2 AD Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM2) (OMIM# 618196). In contrast to RASA1, all but one of the EPHB4 variants were D-mis and transmitted; three of these are absent from ExAC and gnomAD, and two have a MAF of <1.48x10-5 in gnomAD (Table 2).\n\nThe only detected LoF variant in EPHB4 (p.Glu432Glyfs*7) immediately precedes the fibronectin type 3 (fn3) domain, truncating the protein kinase domain (Fig. 1c), and is predicted to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay68. All D-mis variants in EPHB4 alter highly conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 1c). p.Lys650Asn and p.Phe867Leu localize to the Eph-B4 tyrosine kinase domain69,70. p.Lys650Asn is a surface-exposed residue in the β3-αC loop of the EPHB4 tyrosine kinase N-lobe and is located proximal to the putative binding site of the autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region. p.Phe867Leu is a highly conserved, hydrophobic core residue in the C-lobe of the EPHB4 tyrosine kinase domain. p.Ala509Gly is a highly conserved, hydrophobic core residue in the second of two EPHB4 extracellular fibronectin III domains (Supplementary Fig. 2). In silico biophysical modeling suggests these VOGM-associated D-mis variants significantly disrupt EPHB4 structure and function26.\n\nThe steady-state abundance of Lys650Asn, Arg838Trp, and Phe867Leu EPHB4 variants expressed in Cos-7 cells approximated that of WT EPHB4 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). Cycloheximide block of protein translation revealed polypeptide decay rates of EPHB4 VOGM mutants similar to that of WT EPHB4 (Fig. 2b), indicating that none of the EPHB4 kinase domain variants affect EPHB4 protein stability. However, none of the VOGM-associated EPHB4 kinase domain mutants contained detectable phosphotyrosine as detected by anti-pTyr immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates and anti-EPHB4 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2c). These findings strongly suggest that VOGM-associated EPHB4 D-mis variants block the protein tyrosine kinase activity of EPHB4 or render EPHB4 phospho-sites more susceptible to dephosphorylation.\n\nPatient phenotypes associated with RASA1 and EPHB4 variants are described in Supplementary Table 7. These kindreds notably include eight additional family members without diagnosed VOGM who carry the same variants. Among these, three carriers of RASA1 variants and two carriers of EPHB4 variants had cutaneous vascular lesions (Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, cutaneous vascular lesions and cardiac abnormalities were absent among confirmed non-carrier family members. For example, KVOGM42-1 with the rare transmitted RASA1 p.Arg709* variant had a carrier mother without a VOGM, but with cutaneous vascular lesions and an extensive family history on the maternal side of aneurysms, stroke, and Raynaud’s syndrome in several other family members unavailable for sequencing. Similarly, the father of KVOGM115-1 carrying the EPHB4 p.Glu432Glyfs*7 variant lacked VOGM but had a capillary malformation. The proband also had a brother with multiple cutaneous capillary malformations and other vascular lesions on his face and leg unavailable for sequencing. Interestingly, none of the VOGM probands or their family members carried a clinical or genetic diagnosis of CM-AVM before inclusion in this study. These findings together show incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of transmitted variants in the related CM-AVM genes RASA1 and EPHB4 in VOGM.\n\nVariants in ACVRL1 and other mutation-intolerant Mendelian vascular disease genes\n\nTo identify other potential VOGM genes and gain insight into the molecular pathways impacted by their variant, we performed Gene Ontology (GO), Reactome, and Wiki pathway analyses (see Methods) on genes of pLI ≥0.9 harboring damaging de novo and/or rare (MAF ≤ 2 x 10−5) damaging transmitted variants (see Supplementary Table 8 and Methods). Among the top significantly enriched terms (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7) was Reactome pathway term REAC:R-hsa-422475 associated with axon guidance (p = 2.17 x 10−15), a process critical for vascular patterning and regulated by Ephrin-Eph receptor signaling1. Other GO biological process and molecular function terms enriched in VOGM probands included those associated with heart development (GO:0007507, p = 5.19 x 10−10) and Ras GTPase activator activity (GO:0005096, p = 3.35 x 10−10) (Fig. 3a).\n\n46 LoF and 72 D-mis damaging variants in total were identified in genes associated with axon guidance terms REAC:R-hsa-422475 (see above) or related axon guidance term GO:0007411 (p = 2.16 x 10−8), including five DNVs (Supplementary Table 9). Besides RASA1 and EPHB4, several other high-pLI genes essential to cerebrovascular development contained multiple rare, damaging de novo or transmitted variants, including ACVRL1, NOTCH1, PTPN11, and ITGB1 (Supplementary Tables 10–11). These genes also contributed to enrichment signals identified in both the heart development term GO:0007507 and/or the Ras GTPase activator activity term GO:0005096 (Fig. 3a) and mapped onto a robust STRING71 protein-protein interactome (PPI enrichment p < 1.0 x 10−16) with other Ras signaling genes harboring rare, damaging variants (Supplementary Table 12 and Fig. 3b). We, therefore, examined the probands harboring these variants in greater detail.\n\nKVOGM73-1 harbored a novel, de novo p.Gly616Cys variant in NOTCH1 (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 4), encoding a cell surface receptor for Jagged-1 (JAG1) and other Notch family ligands72. NOTCH1 variants are associated with congenital heart defects and other vascular anomalies in AD aortic valve disease type 1 (OMIM# 109730)73 and AD Adams-Oliver syndrome type 5 (OMIM# 616028)74. Although KVOGM73-1 exhibited no structural cardiac pathology, he had moyamoya disease (MMD), in common with JAG1-mutant patients with AD Alagille syndrome type 175 (OMIM# 118450). Notch proteins are characterized by N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats followed by LNR domains which form a complex with ligands to prevent signaling. p.Gly616Cys impacts a conserved NOTCH1 residue required for proper folding of the EGF-like domain (Supplementary Fig. 4)76. Unrelated proband KVOGM83-1 contained another rare, damaging, unphased variant in NOTCH1 (p. Asp1064Asn) at the surface-exposed residue of the 28th EGF repeat, part of the Abruptex region in fly NOTCH and potentially implicated in cis-inhibition of NOTCH1 (Supplementary Fig. 4)77. To our knowledge, this is the first report of co-existing VOGM and MMD, as well as the first report of a de novo NOTCH1 variant in a VOGM patient.\n\nProband KVOGM23-1 harbored a de novo p.Tyr63Cys variant in PTPN11, encoding the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 4). PTPN11 variants, including the identical p.Tyr63Cys variant, have been reported in AD Noonan syndrome type 1 (OMIM# 163950), which features a broad spectrum of congenital heart defects and other systemic vascular lesions78,79. KVOGM23-1 exhibited no Noonan syndrome-like features. Interestingly, p.Tyr63Cys impacts a conserved residue of SHP2’s N-terminal SH2 domain (Supplementary Fig. 4). Similar to other N-SH2 domain ‘blocking loop’ variants, p.Tyr63Cys disrupts SHP2 autoinhibition and causes constitutive Ras signaling activation80,81. The paralogous p.Asp61Gly variant in SHP1 potentiates Ras/ERK/MAPK signaling by interfering with the phosphorylation of GAB1, an adapter protein recruiting p120 RasGAP to receptor tyrosine kinases80,82,83. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo PTPN11 variant in a VOGM patient.\n\nProband KVOGM-91 harbored a rare, damaging variant in ACVRL1 (p.Cys344Tyr) (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Variants in ACVRL1 encoding ALK1, a type I cell-surface TGF-beta superfamily receptor serine/threonine kinase84, have been implicated in AD hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) type 2 (Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome 2; OMIM# 600376). Whereas the proband had no features of HHT2, further inquiry revealed that his uncle died at 2 weeks of age from VOGM-related high-output heart failure. Moreover, the proband’s father, grandfather, and multiple paternal cousins had stigmata of HHT2, including epistaxis, visceral AVMs (lung and liver), and cutaneous vascular lesions. ACVRL1 p.Cys344Tyr segregated with VOGM and HHT2 vascular phenotypes in all affected family members available for sequencing. p.Cys344Tyr, impacting a highly conserved residue in the kinase domain (Fig. 3c), has been identified in another HHT2 family (without history of VOGM)85 and decreases ALK1 cell surface expression86. In further support of the pathogenicity of ACVLR1 variant in VOGM, we found that Acvrl1a/b depletion in the Tg(kdr:gfp)zn1 reporter fish line (see Methods) resulted in VOGM-like massive dilation of the venous primordial hindbrain channel and posterior connecting segment, similar to that seen in Ephb4a/b-deficient fish (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 8). These phenotypes were rescued by mRNA co-injection of wild-type human ACVRL1 but not of VOGM-mutant human ACVRL1 Cys344Tyr (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 9).\n\nUnrelated proband KVOGM-100 contained another rare, damaging variant in ACVRL1 (p.Arg484Gln) (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 10). KVOGM-100 had features of HHT2, including recurrent nosebleeds and pulmonary arterial hypertension (Supplementary Table 11). The proband’s father carried the ACVRL1 variant and had telangiectasias on his tongue, lips, and lower extremities. Variant p.Arg484Gln impacts a conserved surface-exposed residue located in helix αI of the kinase C-lobe, and encodes a catalytically inactive ALK1 mutant87. Variants in this region are associated with HHT2, increased incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension88,89,90, and other ALK family-associated diseases such as brachydactyly type A2 (ALK6)91,92 and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (ALK5)93,94. ACVRL1 p.Arg484Gln has also been identified in HHT295 and in childhood-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension96. p.Arg484Gln. ALK1 interacts with p120 RasGAP via the Dok-1 adapter protein97, implicating ALK1-DOK1-p120 RasGAP in crosstalk between the TGF-beta and Ras/ERK/MAPK signaling pathways.\n\nKVOGM89-1 and KVOGM105-1 exomes respectively contained the rare, damaging, variants p.Ser785fs (unphased) and c.2331-2 A>G (transmitted) in ITGB1 (Integrin subunit beta-1), whose protein product is essential for endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and survival during angiogenesis98 (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 10). Interestingly, both patients had intracranial hemorrhage, progressive macrocephaly, and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. KVOGM105-1 and his sister (unavailable for sequencing) presented with impressive nevus simplex lesions, a type of capillary malformation. p.Ser785fs and c.2331-2 A>G variants are predicted to lead to nonsense-mediated RNA decay. Together, these results suggest that rare, damaging de novo or transmitted variants in other mutation-intolerant genes implicated in other vascular Mendelian syndromes are pathogenic contributors to VOGM.\n\nVOGM-associated genes are enriched in developing cerebrovascular endothelial cells\n\nTo gain insight into the developmental periods, cell types, and molecular pathways involved in VOGM biology, we performed a spatiotemporal consensus Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)99, which leverages a large bulk RNAseq data set encompassing multiple human brain regions across development and into early childhood100. We constructed 88 modules characterized by genes that share highly similar expression patterns during brain development across different cortical regions and therefore likely to be involved in similar functions99. Each module was assessed for relative enrichment of high-confidence and probable (p) VOGM genes, brain AVM genes, AVM+VOGM genes together (since each is a high-flow arterio-venous communication disorder), cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) genes, moyamoya disease (MMD genes, and human height genes (as a negative control)), using multivariate logistic regression (see Supplementary Table 13 and Methods for description of gene lists).\n\nVOGM genes converged in several modules in the fetal human cortex. The most significant of these was the post-conceptional week (PCW) 37 “Midnight Blue” module (p = 2.13 × 10−6; Fig. 5). The “Black” module was also enriched with VOGM genes (Fig. 5a). The “Black” module exhibited peak gene expression early in development at PCW 9-17 (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the only module to show enrichment for VOGM genes alone, “Light Cyan”, is expressed later in neurodevelopment, at 10–12 months postnatally. (Fig. 5b). Notably, genes expressed in the PCW 37 “Midnight Blue” module were enriched for those involved in Focal Adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR Signaling Pathway (WP:3932; p = 6.73 × 10−10, 6.7-fold enrichment), including Positive Regulation of Vascular Development (GO: 1904018; enrichment 11.4-fold; p = 7.95 × 10−8) and Regulation of Cell Migration (GO: 0030334; enrichment 4.4-fold; p = 5.94 × 10−6; Fig. 5c). Human height genes were unenriched in any of the defined modules.\n\nWe next studied VOGM gene expression using two different sc-RNAseq transcriptomic atlases. The first set comprised of 154,938 total cells across 42 cell types from 20 brain regions spanning different developmental stages101. VOGM genes (p = 6.43 × 10−6) and pVOGM genes (p = 1.25 × 10−5) showed specific enrichment in the endothelial cell (EC) subcluster. VOGM+AVM genes were also enriched in ECs, but the contributors to this signal were VOGM-specific genes, as AVM genes alone were not significantly enriched. In contrast, CCM and MMD genes were not enriched in Ecs. VOGM genes were also enriched in other cell types to lesser degrees than in EC subtypes. Examples include the excitatory embryonic neuron (cluster “ExN6b”, p = 4.75 × 10−4) and the inhibitory neurons (cluster “InN4b”, p = 3.18 × 10−4) (Fig. 5d). Control human height genes were unenriched in any of the 42 cell subtypes.\n\nThe second sc-RNAseq transcriptomic atlas included 181,388 total cells from normal and diseased human cerebrovasculature, including both endothelial and perivascular cell subtypes46. Corroborating results from the STAB dataset, VOGM genes showed specific enrichment in ECs (p = 6.43 x 10−6). VOGM, AVM, and AVM+VOGM genes were enriched in arterial and venous EC subtypes, but not in perivascular subtypes such as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, fibromyocytes, pericytes, or other perivascular cell types (Fig. 5e). In contrast, CCM and MMD genes were unenriched in arterial and venous EC subtypes. Human height genes were not enriched in any of the 18 cell subtypes.\n\nWe again constructed modules from the cerebrovascular dataset comprising co-expressed genes. These were then assessed for the enrichment of VOGM and other disease genes (see Methods). Of the 25 defined modules, VOGM genes were most highly enriched in Modules 11 (p = 3.23 × 10−4) and 12 (p = 8.22 × 10−5), overlapping with AVM genes (Fig. 5f). In contrast, CCM and MMD genes were most enriched in Module 6 defined by mitochondrial processes. Human height genes were not significantly enriched in any of the modules (Fig. 5f). Module 11 genes were most highly enriched for pathways related to VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling (WP3888; 1.97-fold enrichment; p = 4.51 x 10−5), vascular transport (GO:0010232; 5.0-fold enrichment; p = 7.04 x 10−8), and GTPase activator activity (GO:0005096; 2.7-fold enrichment; p = 3.89 x 10−8) (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 10). Module 12 was notably enriched for pathways related to Ras/ERK/MAPK (WP4223; 2.3-fold enrichment; p = 3.89 x 10−3) and inflammation-regulated EGFR signaling (WP4483; 6.5-fold enrichment; p = 2.05 x 10−3) (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 10). Taken together, these results suggest developing cerebral endothelial cells are an important spatio-temporal locus impacted by VOGM-associated gene variants.\n\nPhenotypic validation of a VOGM-specific EPHB4 kinase domain missense variant in mice\n\nMice constitutively deficient in EPHB4 or its ligand, Ephrin B2, expire at E10.5 of gestation because vascular plexuses that arise through vasculogenesis are not remodeled by angiogenesis into hierarchical arterial-capillary-venous networks3,102,103. However, whether EPHB4 kinase activity is required for normal blood vascular development remains unknown. Based on our human genetic (Fig. 1) and integrative genomic results (Fig. 5), we hypothesized that genetic inactivation of a kinase-dependent, EPHB4-regulated RASA1 signaling mechanism in endothelial cells disrupts VEGF-associated developmental angiogenesis in vivo. To test this hypothesis and gain insight into the mechanism of the identified VOGM-associated EPHB4 kinase domain missense variants, we generated EphB4 mutant mice carrying a knock-in allele orthologous to the EPHB4 p.Phe867Leu variant identified in patient KVOGM18-1 (Table 2 and Methods).\n\nHeterozygous Ephb4+/F867L mice were viable, fertile, and exhibited no obvious vascular developmental or other defects. However, homozygous Ephb4F867L/F867L pups were not identified among the progeny of heterozygous Ephb4+/F867L parents, suggesting that the EPHB4 p.Phe867Leu variant is lethal in homozygous form (Fig. 6a).\n\nExamination of homozygous Ephb4F867L/F867L embryos at E10.5 confirmed a smaller size and vascular defects similar to those reported in constitutive EPHB4- and Ephrin B2-deficient E10.5 embryos (Fig. 6b, c). Blood flow was often absent in E10.5 Ephb4F867L/F867L embryos and the pericardial sac was grossly distended (Fig. 6b). The yolk sacs of littermate E10.5 Ephb4+/+ and Ephb4+/F867L embryos showed normal hierarchical vascular networks supplying blood to the developing embryo (Fig. 6b and d). In contrast, the yolk sacs of Ephb4F867L/F867L embryos exhibited honeycomb-like vascular patterning typical of primitive vascular networks (Fig. 6b and d). At E10.5, some Ephb4F867L/F867L embryos showed reduced cellularity (not shown). Therefore, we examined E9.5 Ephb4F867L/F867L embryos to characterize vascular defects in the embryo proper. E9.5 Ephb4F867L/F867L embryos exhibited impaired developmental angiogenesis among intersomitic vessels that failed to extend branches toward the midline as observed in Ephb4+/+ and Ephb4+/F867L embryos (Fig. 6e). The same phenotype was previously noted in constitutive EPHB4- and Ephrin B2-deficient embryos at E9.5103.\n\nWe have shown previously that EPHB4 and RASA1 promote survival of endothelial cells during developmental angiogenesis67,104. Disruption of Ephb4 or Rasa1 genes in endothelial cells in mid-to-late gestation (when vasculogenesis has ceased and angiogenesis predominates) impairs their ability to export the extracellular matrix protein, collagen IV, a major constituent of vascular basement membranes. Consequently, endothelial cells undergo apoptosis secondary to an unfolded protein response triggered by collagen IV trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, and/or secondary to poor adhesion to defective basement membrane. Therefore, to further understand the mechanism of vascular dysfunction in EPHB4 Phe867Leu embryos, we generated Ephb4fl/F867L embryos carrying the Cdh5-CreERT2 endothelial-specific inducible cre driver (see Methods). At E13.5 of development, tamoxifen was administered to embryos to disrupt the Ephb4 floxed allele, resulting in endothelial-specific expression of EPHB4 Phe867Leu alone. At E17.5, Ephb4fl/F867L Cdh5-CreERT2 embryos showed evidence of blood-filled lymphatic vessels in skin, confirmed by H&E staining and immunostaining of tissue sections with antibody against the lymphatic marker, LYVE-1 (Fig. 7). The presence of blood-filled lymphatics is consistent with the known requirement of EPHB4 for development of lymphovenous valves that prevent backflow of venous blood into the lymphatic vascular system105. Strikingly, at E18.5 lymphatic vessels were essentially absent from skin, and there was evidence of extensive cutaneous hemorrhage (Fig. 7). We previously reported the same phenotypes in Ephb4fl/fl Cdh5-CreERT2 embryos treated with tamoxifen at E13.567. These phenotypes were not evident in control tamoxifen-treated Ephb4fl/+ Cdh5-CreERT2 embryo littermates that retain a single wild-type Ephb4 gene copy after treatment (Fig. 7).\n\nWe also examined sections of brain tissue from tamoxifen-treated Ephb4fl/F867L Cdh5-CreERT2 embryos for evidence of vascular defects. At E17.5, blood vascular hemorrhage in the region of the cerebellum and choroid plexus was observed (Fig. 7). However, at E18.5, neither intravascular nor extravascular erythrocytes were identified in the brain, and brain cellularity was substantially reduced (Fig. 7). At both developmental time points, CD31-positive blood vessels appeared disorganized as compared to control brain blood vessels (Fig. 7). To examine if endothelial cells in Ephb4fl/F867L Cdh5-CreERT2 embryos underwent abnormal apoptosis after tamoxifen treatment, tissue sections from E17.5 embryos were stained with antibodies against active caspase-3. In both skin and the choroidal plexus/cerebellar region of brains, apoptotic vascular endothelial cells were identified (Fig. 8a–c). Furthermore, intracellular accumulation of collagen IV was evident in skin (Fig. 8a). In summary, mid-to-late gestation embryos induced to express only EPHB4 Phe867Leu specifically in endothelial cells phenocopy embryos induced to lose endothelial expression of EPHB4 or RASA1 during the same period.\n\nThe genetic understanding of VOGM has been hindered by its rarity and sporadic nature. Here, we have presented the largest WES cohort of VOGM to date and integrated these WES results with human brain and vasculature transcriptomes to define the cell types, developmental time points, and functional networks impacted by genes associated with VOGM. We also validated candidate genes in zebrafish and mouse models of disease. Collectively, these data shed insight into the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of VOGM, help illuminate the genetic regulation of human arterio-venous development and have implications for clinical risk assessment of patients and their families and the development of targeted therapeutics.\n\nOur analysis uncovered enrichment of rare, heterozygous, damaging de novo and inherited germline variants in VOGM probands (Supplementary Data 3) in mutation-intolerant (high-pLI) signaling genes highly expressed in the embryonic vasculature106 and known to regulate cerebrovasculature development107,108. These disease-associated genes map onto a robust STRING71 protein-protein interactome (Fig. 3) that includes p120 RasGAP (RASA1) and EphB4 (EPHB4), which cooperates with RASA1 to regulate Ras signaling in endothelial cells. Consistent with this, gain-of-function variants were identified in the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTNPN11), which binds to and dephosphorylates Ras to increase its association with Raf and activate Ras signaling109,110. Moreover, LoF variants in the serine/threonine receptor kinase ALK1 (ACVRL1), which facilitates crosstalk between the TGF-beta and Ras signaling pathways by associating with RASA1 via the Dok-1 adapter protein97, were detected in other probands, including an ultra-rare multi-generational VOGM family. These data suggest that genetic dysregulation of Ras signaling is an important driver of VOGM pathogenesis, consistent with other cerebral vascular anomalies25,27,28,29,111,112,113,114.\n\nGermline variants in VOGM risk genes RASA1, EPHB4, ACVRL1, PTNPN11, and NOTCH1 have been reported in other Mendelian diseases featuring vascular phenotypes25,27,110,111,115,116,117. RASA1 and EPHB4 encode interacting proteins mutated in CM-AVM type 1 and 2, respectively. Our VOGM probands with ACVRL1 (ALK1) variants, which have been linked with HHT1, are either part of a multi-generational VOGM family with HHT1 or have HHT1 features. Consistent with this pattern is the previous identification of a VOGM patient with a variant in HHT2 gene ENG, encoding the ALK1 binding partner Endoglin28. Interestingly, the Ras-activating PTPN11 (SHP2) p.Tyr63Cys variant identified in KVOGM23-1 was previously identified in Noonan syndrome (OMIM# 163950), which features a broad spectrum of congenital heart defects and other systemic vascular lesions78,79. Thus, VOGMs may represent phenotypic expansions of CM-AVM, HHT, or other Mendelian vascular syndromes. Nonetheless, none of our RASA1 or EPHB4 patients or their family members carried a diagnosis of CM-AVM at the time of DNA sequencing.\n\nInherited VOGM variants show incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, with variant carriers often exhibiting cutaneous vascular lesions. Cutaneous vascular lesions are a common hallmark of developmental vascular disorders such as RASA1- and EPHB4-mutated CM-AVM25,27, ENG1- and ACVRL1-mutated HHT29, and RASA1-mutated Parkes Weber syndrome, among others30,118,119. As many VOGM families with full clinical data had capillary malformations or other uncommon cutaneous vascular lesions, and as variants identified in probands were found in all family members with these cutaneous lesions, VOGMs and the cutaneous lesions are likely linked to the same variants. These observations highlight the pleiotropy of these genetic variants and the value of WES as a diagnostic adjunct.\n\nVariable expressivity of VOGM and associated features could arise from environmental modifiers120 in concert with the identified rare variants and/or specific genetic modifiers43. However, our findings are most consistent with a two-hit mechanism in which phenotypic expression relies on an inherited germline mutation and a second, post-zygotic (i.e., somatic) mutation in a second allele121,122. This mechanism has been shown for other hereditary multifocal vascular malformations, such as CM-AVM127,123,124, glomuvenous malformations (OMIM: 138000), cutaneomucosal venous malformation (OMIM: 600195), and cerebral cavernous malformations (OMIM: 116860)122. In this context, phenotypic expression depends on the cell types in which somatic variants co-occur and could explain the low penetrance of VOGM arising from transmitted variants. Our data in mice supports this genetic mechanism, as heterozygous Ephb4F867L mice expressing a VOGM-specific EPHB4 kinase-domain missense variant exhibited severe vascular abnormalities, but only when carrying a second variant allele, i.e. Ephb4F867L or a cre-disrupted Ephb4 allele. Exome sequencing of ultra-rare human VOGM lesion tissue could test this two-hit hypothesis.\n\nIntegration of our WES findings with scRNA-seq datasets of the developing human cerebrovasculature helped define developing endothelial cells as a potential key spatio-temporal locus of VOGM pathophysiology (see Fig. 5). Pathway analysis showed VOGM genes are enriched in growth-factor-regulated, tyrosine receptor kinase-associated signaling, which regulates vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and arterio-venous specification1. Thus, tamoxifen-induced Ephb4fl/F867L Cdh5-CreERT2 mice expressing a VOGM-patient mutation that disrupts EphB4 kinase activity in fetal endothelial cells exhibited impaired remodeling of primitive vascular plexuses by VEGF-regulated sprouting angiogenesis, a process required for development of hierarchical arterial-capillary-venous networks67. VOGM genes are also enriched in pathways that regulate axon pathfinding, which is important for vascular patterning1. Elucidating the mechanistic details of how VOGM variants impact vasculogenesis, including the intercellular communication between developing neural and endothelial cell types, will be important topics of future investigation.\n\nAlthough rare, damaging DNVs of large effect contribute ~12% of VOGM cases, variants in additional genes likely contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our Monte Carlo simulation based on observed damaging DNVs estimated ~66 genes contribute to VOGM by a de novo mechanism. Future WES of 250 or of 1,000 trios should yield respective saturation rates of 20.1% and 70.5%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11). The consequence of cis-regulatory elements and more complex structural variants remains unknown. The still unclear impact of somatic variants requires additional deep sequencing in matched normal and affected-tissue pairs to enable their characterization. Genomic repeats, transposable elements, and epigenomic changes should also be investigated using more comprehensive long-read sequencing technologies.\n\nOur findings have several clinical implications. The enrichment of damaging variants in the VOGM cohort suggests that variant carrier offspring may be at increased risk for VOGMs as well as for capillary malformations and potentially other AVMs. However, not all variant carriers develop capillary malformations, making the presence of capillary malformations an unreliable clinical marker for transmission risk in affected families. These observations highlight the importance of family history and the potential use of exome sequencing-based screening for risk assessment among family members. Family members of VOGM patients with positive exome sequencing results might benefit from intracranial imaging with MRI/MRA, especially in the setting of suspicious mucocutaneous lesions.\n\nThe finding that MAPK inhibitors rescue RASA1 and EPHB4-mutant embryonic vascular phenotypes in mice67,104,125 suggest potential targeted treatments for VOGM and perhaps other CM-AVM and HHT spectrum lesions67,104,125. Trametinib, an orally available inhibitor of MEK kinase activity, is under evaluation in a prospective phase II trial for systemic AVMs (TRAMAV (Trametinib in Arterio-Venous Malformations that are refractory to standard care, https://www.clinicaltrialsreg- ister.eu; unique identifier: 2019-003573-26)). In contrast to systemic vascular lesions, the narrow window of gestational weeks 6–11 during which the primitive choroidal arteries and the MPV are usually present, and therefore during which VOGMs are speculated to develop10, may pose a challenge to improved early therapeutic strategies for VOGM. Thus, attempted diagnosis with intention to treat must proceed before the safe gestational age threshold for amniocentesis126. These data highlight the need for continued genetic research on VOGM, as well as investigation into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of newly discovered VOGM-associated variants in mammalian model systems.\n\nAll procedures in this study comply with Yale University’s Human Investigation Committee (HIC) and are approved by Yale University’s Human Research Protection Program. Written informed consent for genetic studies was obtained from all participants. Written authorization was obtained from a parent or legal guardian for sample collection from all minors in this study. All animal care and handling was performed in accordance with Yale IACUC protocol 2019-20274. All experiments with mice were approved by the Yale University and University of Michigan IACUCs.\n\nPatient subjects\n\nInclusion criteria included male or female patients with clearly defined mural or choroidal VOGMs, radiographically confirmed by both a neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist from an angiogram or magnetic resonance angiogram. Family members of included patients were also studied when possible. Given the non-randomized cohort design of this study aimed at identifying genetic etiologies associated with VOGM, it is important to note that the demographic distribution, including the sex ratio, may not be representative of the general population. Controls consisted of 1,798 unaffected siblings of autism cases and unaffected parents from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative Simplex Collection (SFARI)49,50. Only the unaffected siblings and parents, as designated by SFARI, were included in the analysis and served as controls for this study. Permission to access the genomic data in the SFARI or the National Institute of Mental Health Data Repository was obtained. The SFARI provided written informed consent for all participants.\n\nExome sequencing and variant calling\n\nExome capture was performed on genomic DNA samples derived from saliva or blood using Roche SeqCap EZ MedExome Target Enrichment kit or IDT xGen target capture kit followed by 99 base paired-end sequencing on the Illumina sequencing platform. Sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37/hg19 using BWA-MEM127 and further processed to call variants following the GATK Best Practices workflow52 and Freebayes54. Variants were annotated with ANNOVAR128, gnomAD (v.2.1.1)129, and BRAVO55 databases. We used MetaSVM and MPC algorithms to predict the deleteriousness of missense variants (D-Mis, defined as MetaSVM-deleterious or MPC-score ≥ 2)57,130. Inferred LoF variants consist of stop-gain, stop-loss, frameshift insertions/deletions, canonical splice sites, and start-loss. LoF and D-Mis variants were considered ‘damaging.’ DNVs were called using TrioDeNovo56. Candidate DNVs were further filtered based on the following criteria: (1) exonic or splice-site variants; (2) a minimum read depth (DP) of 10 in the proband and both parents; (3) minimum proband alternative read depth of 5; (4) proband alternative allele ratio ≥ 28% if having <10 alternative reads or ≥20% if having ≥10 alternative reads; (5) alternative allele ratio in both parents ≤ 3.5%; (6) global MAF ≤4 x 10−4 in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. For recessive variant analysis, we filtered for rare (MAF ≤ 1 × 10−3 in BRAVO and in-cohort MAF ≤ 1 × 10−2) homozygous and compound heterozygous variants that exhibited high-quality sequence reads (pass GATK variant quality score recalibration, ≥ 8 total reads for proband, genotype quality (GQ) score ≥ 20). Only LoF, D-Mis, and non-frameshift indels were considered potentially deleterious to the disease. Only homozygous variants were analyzed for probands with unavailable parental WES data. See Supplementary Table 14 for damaging recessive variants identified. For rare transmitted dominant variants, only LoF and D-Mis were included. They were filtered using the following criteria: (1) pass GATK variant quality score recalibration, (2) MAF ≤ 5 × 10−5 in Bravo and in-cohort MAF ≤ 5 × 10−3; (3) a minimum DP of 8 in the proband, and (4) GQ score ≥ 20. After filtering each type of variant as described above, false-positive calls were removed by in silico visualization. Candidate variants were confirmed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing (primer sequences available on request).\n\nKinship analysis\n\nThe relationship between proband and parents was estimated using the pairwise identity-by-descent (IBD) calculation in PLINK131. IBD sharing between the proband and parents in all trios was between 45% and 55%. For pairs sharing ≥ 80% of rare variants, the sample with greater sequence coverage was retained in the analysis, and the other discarded.\n\nPrincipal component analysis\n\nSubject ethnicity was determined by EIGENSTRAT132 software to analyze tag SNPs in cases, controls, and HapMap subjects, as described39.\n\nDe novo expectation model\n\nAs case trios were captured by two different reagents (MedExome and IDT), we took the union of all bases covered by different capture reagents. We generated a Browser Extensible Data file representing a unified capture for all trios. We used bedtools (v.2.27.1) to extract sequences from the Browser Extensible Data file. We then applied a sequence context-based method to calculate the probability of observing a DNV for each base in the coding region, adjusting for sequencing depth in each gene133. Briefly, for each base in the exome, the probability of observing every trinucleotide mutating to other trinucleotides was determined. ANNOVAR (v2015Mar22) was used to annotate the consequence of each possible substitution. RefSeq was used to annotate variants (based on the file ‘hg19_refGene.txt’ provided by ANNOVAR). For each gene, the coding consequence of each potential substitution was summed for each functional class (synonymous, missense, canonical splice site, frameshift insertions/deletions, stop-gain, stop-loss, and start-loss) to determine gene-specific mutation probabilities133. The probability of a frameshift variant was determined by multiplying the probability of a stop-gain variant by 1.25133. The model does not account for in-frame insertions or deletions. To align with ANNOVAR annotations, analysis was limited to variants located in exonic or canonical splice site regions and were not annotated as ‘unknown’ by ANNOVAR. We identified potential coding variants and generated gene-specific mutation probabilities for 19,347 unique genes following the inclusion criteria. Due to the difference between exome capture kits and DNA sequencing platforms, and to variable sequencing coverage between case and control cohorts, separate de novo probability tables were generated for cases and 1,798 autism control trios.\n\nDe novo enrichment analysis\n\nThe burden of DNVs in the case and control trios was determined using the denovolyzeR package39,134. Briefly, the expected number of DNVs in the case and control cohorts across each functional class was calculated by taking the sum of each functional class-specific probability multiplied by the number of probands in the study 2× (diploid genomes). Then, the expected number of DNVs across functional classes was compared to the observed number in each study using a one-sided Poisson test. To examine whether any individual gene contains a greater number of protein-altering DNVs than expected, the expected number of protein-altering DNVs was calculated from the corresponding probability, adjusting for cohort size. A one-sided Poisson test was then used to compare the observed DNVs for each gene versus expected. As separate tests were performed for protein-altering, protein-damaging, and LoF DNVs, the Bonferroni multiple-testing threshold is, therefore, equal to 8.6 × 10−7 (= 0.05 / (3 tests × 19,347 genes)).\n\nEstimation of the expected number of rare, transmitted variants\n\nWe implemented a one-sided binomial test to quantify enrichment of rare damaging or LoF heterozygous variants in each gene by comparing observed and expected counts estimated by mutability39. Because the number of rare damaging or LoF heterozygous variants in a gene was inversely correlated with the constraint score (i.e., pLI score) obtained from the gnomAD database, we stratified genes into five subsets by pLI quartiles to control for the potential confounding effect: (1) the first quartile with pLI <6.4 × 10−8; (2) the second quartile with pLI score 6.4 × 10−8–1.9 × 10−3; (3) the third quartile with pLI 1.9 x 10−3 −0.48; (4) the fourth quartile with pLI 0.48–1.0; between third quantile and 1; and (5) those without a pLI score. For each set, the expected number of LoF heterozygous variants per gene was estimated by the following formula:\n\n$${{{{{{\\rm{Expected\\; heterozygous}}}}}}}_{j,k}={{{{{{\\rm{L}}}}}}}_{k}\\times \\frac{{{{{{{\\rm{mutability}}}}}}}_{j}}{{\\sum }_{{{set}}_{k}}{{{{{{\\rm{mutability}}}}}}}_{j}}$$\n\nwhere ‘j’ denotes the ‘jth’ gene, ‘k’ means the ‘kth’ set, and ‘L’ means the total number of damaging or LoF heterozygous variants.\n\nBinomial analysis\n\nExpected and observed counts of rare variants in each gene were compared by independent binomial tests. The expected number of rare de novo damaging variants was determined using the de novo expectation model (see above); the expected number of rare transmitted heterozygous variants was determined using the estimation method mentioned above. Inputs for this test were those with inferred pathogenicity, including D-mis variants (MetaSVM-deleterious or MPC-score ≥ 2) and LoF variants (stop-gains, stop-losses, frameshift insertions, and deletions, or canonical splice-site variants). Binomial analysis for mutational enrichment did not include non-frameshift insertions or deletions, or compound heterozygous variants. The genome-wide significant cut-off was 2.6 × 10−6 ( = 0.05/19,347).\n\nCase-control burden analysis\n\nCase and control cohorts were processed using the same pipeline and filtered with the same criteria. A one-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the observed number of total alternative alleles in cases vs. gnomAD controls (without disease-enriched TOPMed samples) for our candidate genes, regardless of transmission pattern.\n\nGene lists for specific diseases\n\nGene lists for VOGM, AVM, CCM, MMD, and human height were curated from the publications referenced and genes were considered disease-causing based on guidelines from the Centers for Mendelian Genomics23,26,36,113,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148. Genes were classified as “possible” VOGM risk genes if they are established VOGM genes, or if they harbored ≥ 1 damaging DNV in a gene with pLI score ≥0.9 in the gnomAD database.\n\nWeighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)\n\nRobust consensus WGCNA was conducted by applying a processed bulk transcriptome sequencing data set encompassing sixteen human brain regions across human brain development100. To increase resolution of the primary neurodevelopmental time periods, analysis was limited to timepoints between gestational week 9 and postnatal year 3. We removed samples >3 standard deviations above the mean network connectivity as outliers. Network analysis was performed with WGCNA99, assigning genes to specific modules based on bi-weight mid-correlations among genes. Soft threshold power of 10 was chosen to achieve scale-free topology (r2 > 0.9). A signed co-expression network was then generated. The topological overlap matrix was clustered hierarchically using average linkage hierarchical clustering (using ‘1 – TOM‘ as a dis-similarity measure). The topological overlap dendrogram was used to define modules using a minimum module size of 40, a deep split of 4, merge threshold of 0.1.\n\nModule enrichment analysis\n\nModule gene lists were obtained via WGCNA as described above. In a background set of all genes categorized in co-expression modules, logistic regression was used for an indicator-based enrichment: is.disease ~ is.module + gene covariates (GC content, gene length, and mean expression in bulk RNA-seq atlas)101. Of the 88 WGCNA modules, the gray module, by WGCNA convention100, contains all genes that do not co-express and are consequently unassigned to a co-expression network. Thus, the gray module was excluded from enrichment testing, and enrichment significance was defined at the Bonferroni multiple-testing cutoff (α = 5.68 × 10−04).\n\nCell type enrichment analysis\n\nCell type-enriched genes (cell type markers) were obtained from a scRNA-seq atlas of human brain spanning the period between early fetal development into adulthood and from a scRNA-seq atlas of mouse meninges. In a background set of all genes expressed in ≥ 3 cells of the scRNA-seq atlas, logistic regression was applied for indicator-based enrichment analysis: is.cell.type ~ is.disease + gene covariates (GC content, gene length). All p-values were adjusted by Bonferroni correction (α = 1.19 x 10−03 for the brain parenchyma and α = 8.33 x 10−03 for the meninges).\n\nGene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis\n\nA total of 436 genes, including genes harboring damaging DNVs, LoF-intolerant genes (pLI ≥ 0.9) with rare (Bravo MAF ≤ 5 × 10−5) damaging transmitted variants, EPHB4, ACVRL1, and ENG were input into EnrichR R package Version 3.0149. Enrichment analysis was performed for gene ontologies (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions), and biological pathway (Wiki pathways and Reactome pathways). The top 10 terms with the lowest adjusted p-values were reported.\n\nZebrafish husbandry\n\nAdult Tg(kdr:gfp)zn1 zebrafish (AB background) were maintained in 3.0 L tanks with constant water flow (Iwaki Aquatic) under a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle. They were fed GEMMA Micro 500 (Skretting USA) dry food twice daily supplemented with hatched Artemia once daily. Embryos were obtained via natural matings; these embryos were maintained at 28.5° C in E3 medium containing 100 µM 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) to prevent melanization and facilitate imaging. Embryos were anesthetized with 0.16 mg/mL tricaine (Syndel). Care protocols were developed from techniques developed at Boston Children’s Hospital150,151. All animal care and handling was performed in accordance with Yale IACUC protocol 2019-20274.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein generation, mRNA synthesis, and injection\n\nGene-specific crRNA sequences were designed using CRISPOR152 and ordered from IDT. In general, two crRNAs were generated per gene; for paralogous genes such as ephb4a/b, both paralogs were targeted simultaneously. These scRNAs were annealed to tracRNA per the manufacturer’s instructions (to generate complete sgRNAs), then complexed with Cas9 protein at a 1:2 molar ratio (final concentration of RNA:Cas9 was ~33 µM:66 µM) in Cas9 buffer to generate active ribonucleoprotein knockout reagents. Phenol red was added to a final concentration of 0.1% w/v to generate injection mix. Embryos at the one-cell stage were injected (WPI Pneumatic PicoPump) with 1 nL of injection mix, then allowed to develop to 48 hpf. In some injection mixes these RNPs were combined with rescue or false-rescue mRNAs (200 ng/µL) generated from cloned human cDNAs inserted into pCS2+ and in vitro transcribed using the mMessage mMachine SP6 kit (ThermoFisher) per manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nValidation of knockout reagents\n\nTo verify sgRNA efficacy, injected embryos were collected, and crude genomic DNA isolated via boiling/alkaline lysis. Primers flanking the sgRNA target site were used to generate amplicons of ~500 bp. These were denatured, reannealed, digested with T7 endonuclease (NEB) and electrophoresed on 2% agarose. sgRNAs were selected by fragmentation patterns that indicated mismatch DNA arising from CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing. See Supplementary Table 15 for all crRNAs and primer sets used in this study.\n\nMicroangiography, confocal imaging, and statistical analysis\n\nAnesthetized 48 hpf zebrafish embryos were injected via caudal vein with 1 mg/mL 2,000,000 MW rhodamine dextran (ThermoFisher), embedded in 1.5% agarose, and immediately imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Image stacks were processed and analyzed using Fiji/ImageJ. All statistical analysis was performed using R. A Welch two-sample t-test was used for all two-level factor analyses; all multi-level factor analyses were by ANOVAs followed by Tukey multiple comparisons of means.\n\nPlasmids, cell culture, and protein isolation\n\nc-myc-tagged Ephb4 cDNA in pCMV6 was from Origene. Single K650N, R838W and F867L Ephb4 mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) per manufacturer’s instructions. Cos-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 10 cm culture dishes. At 60% confluency, cells were transfected with 10 μg plasmid using Lipofectamine in Opti-MEM (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). To control for transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with 1 µg pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Takara Bio USA). Where indicated, protein stability was assessed by adding 5 mg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) to the cell growth medium for the indicated times prior to harvest. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS. GFP content was assessed by flow cytometry using BD Fortessa or BD FACSCanto instruments (BD Biosciences). Proteins were extracted in NP40 Lysis Buffer (NLB, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by 3 repeats of freeze-thawing on dry ice. Extracts were subsequently centrifuged at 13.000 x g. for 10 min at 4 °C and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis.\n\nImmunoprecipitation and Western blotting\n\nFor immunoprecipitation, 20 μg total protein in 200 μl NLB was precleared with 10 μl protein A Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were incubated with 1 μg goat anti-EPHB4 polyclonal IgG (R&D systems, AF446-SP) at 4 °C for 3 h followed by addition of 10 μl Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 20 min to capture antibody-protein complexes. Beads were washed 5 times for 5 min each with 200 μl NLB before protein elution by boiling for 10 min in 20 μl 1x NuPage LDS Sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For Western blotting, lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated on a Bolt 10% Bis-Tris Plus gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). To determine total EPHB4 amounts and EPHB4 phosphorylation status, the following antibodies were used: goat anti-EPHB4 polyclonal IgG, mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal IgG (clone 4G10; MilliporeSigma), rabbit anti-ACTB polyclonal IgG (Cell Signaling Technologies, 4967), rabbit anti-TUBB monoclonal IgG (clone 9F3, Cell Signaling Technologies, 2128), and mouse anti-Myc monoclonal IgG (clone 9E10; EMD MilliporeSigma, OP10-200UG), goat anti-rabbit IgG–HRP (Cell Signaling Technology, 7074), horse anti-mouse IgG–HRP (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076) and donkey anti-goat IgG–HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch, 705-035-147).\n\nCRISPR generation of the EphB4 F867L mouse\n\nThe EphB4 F867L mouse was created via CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing153,154. Potential Cas9 target guide (protospacer) sequences in exon 15 in the vicinity of the F867 codon were screened using online tool CRISPOR http://crispor.tefor.net, and 5 candidates were selected. Templates for sgRNA synthesis were generated by PCR from a pX330 template, sgRNAs were transcribed in vitro (Megashortscript; ThermoFisher) and purified. sgRNA/Cas9 RNPs were complexed and tested for activity by zygote electroporation, incubation of embryos to blastocyst stage, and genotype scoring of indel creation at the target sites. The gRNA with highest activity was selected to create the knock-in allele. A recombination template oligo (IDT) was designed to create the TTT->CTT codon change and incorporated an EphB4 P865 CCC->CCT silent mutation to destroy the PAM. sgRNA/Cas9 RNP and the template oligo were electroporated into C57Bl/6 J (JAX) zygotes. Embryos were transferred to oviducts of pseudopregnant CD-1 foster females155. Genotype screening of tissue biopsies from founder pups was by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing, followed by breeding to establish germline transmission of the correctly targeted F867L allele. Mice carrying the exon 2-exon 3 floxed alleles of Ephb4 have been described105. Cdh5-CreERT2 mice were obtained from Cancer Research UK156. All mice were on a mostly C57BL6/J background. Sex of embryos was not determined.\n\nMouse genotyping\n\nDNA isolated from tail clips was used for genotyping. The following primers were used to show: (a) the presence of Cre recombinase: forward 5'-ATTTACTGACCGTACACCAAA-3' and reverse 5'-CTGTTTTGCACGTTCACCGGC-3', (b) the Ephb4 floxed allele: forward 5′-GGAATGAGGGCGAGTGGGTT-3′ and the reverse 5′-GGTTGGGGACAAAGAGGAAGA-3, and (c) the Ephb4 F867L mutant locus: forward 5'-GCGAACGATTCTCTCAAGCC-3' and reverse 5'-AGAATAGTGAGGCTGCCGTT-3; for the latter, the obtained product was subsequently digested with EcoN1 restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) to differentiate wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mice. 20 μl PCR reactions contained 10 μl GoTaq® green PCR Master mix (Promega), 6 μl nuclease-free water, 0.5 μl of each primer (10 μM), and 3 μl template DNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 98 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles consisting of 98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 50 s, followed by 10 min incubation at 72 °C. Products were separated on a 2% agarose gel.\n\nCD31 whole mount staining of yolk sacs and embryos\n\nEPHB4F867L/+ heterozygous mice were intercrossed, and embryos and yolk sacs were harvested at different stages of embryonic development. Embryos and yolk sacs were fixed in 4x diluted Cytofix, Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and stained with a rat anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences, 550274, 1:50), followed by a secondary donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Invitrogen, 1:300). Specimens were washed in PBS + 0.3% Triton (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.\n\nInduced vascular disruption of Ephb4\n\nEphb4+/F867L heterozygous females were crossed with Ephb4fl/fl Cdh5-CreERT2 males, and pregnant dams were injected i.p. with tamoxifen (Sigma, 0.05 mg/g body weight, dissolved in corn oil) on consecutive days E13.5 and E14.5. Embryos were harvested at E15.5 through E18.5, formalin-fixed, dehydrated and paraffin-embedded. 5 μM sections were stained with H&E or with antibodies against CD31 (SZ31, Dianova, 1:50), LYVE-1 (14917, Abcam, 1:100), active caspase 3 (AF835, R&D Systems, 1:100), or collagen IV (1340-1, Southern Biotech, 1:100), followed by appropriate species-specific fluorochrome-labeled secondary anti-Igs (Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:500). Images were acquired on a Nikon N-SIM + A1R microscope.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article."
