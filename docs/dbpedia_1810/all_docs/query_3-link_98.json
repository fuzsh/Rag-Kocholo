We investigated the risk of gastric and small intestinal cancer in patients with LS in a large, community-based population. This retrospective cohort study included all patients diagnosed with LS between 1/1/1997-12/31/2020 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Cumulative incidence of gastric cancer and small intestinal cancer was calculated using competing risk methodology. Among 1106 LS patients with a median follow-up of 19.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9.4-24.0 years), 11 developed gastric cancer (8 MSH2, 2 MLH1 and 1 PMS2) with the median diagnosis age of 56 years (IQR 42-63 years); 11 developed small intestinal cancer (6 MSH2, 3 MLH1, 1 MSH6 and 1 PMS2) with the median diagnosis age of 57 years (IQR 50-66 years). Cumulative incidence by age 80 years was 7.26% (95% confidence internal [CI], 1.80-18.03%) for men and 3.43% (95% CI, 0.50-11.71%) for women for gastric cancer, and was 7.28% (95% CI, 3.19-13.63%) for men and 2.21% (95% CI, 0.23-9.19%) for women for small intestinal cancer. Pathogenic variants (PV) carriers of MSH2 and MLH1 had the highest risk of gastric and small intestinal cancer. History of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was associated with increased risk of gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio 5.52; 95% CI, 1.72-17.75). Patients with LS, particularly MSH2 and MLH1 PV carriers, had significantly increased lifetime risk of gastric and small intestinal cancer. Testing and treatment of H. pylori should be considered for all patients with LS.\n\nAuthors: Lin, Christina F;Carwana, Holly E;Jiang, Sheng-Fang;Li, Dan\n\nClin Transl Gastroenterol. 2024 Jun 26.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nReply by Authors\n\nAuthors: Presti, Joseph;Horton, Brandon;Alexeeff, Stacey;Prausnitz, Stephanie;Avins, Andrew L\n\nUrol Pract. 2024 Jun 21:101097UPJ0000000000000663.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nAssociation between Neighborhood Stressors and Allostatic Load in Breast Cancer Survivors: The Pathways Study\n\nAllostatic load (AL) is an intermediary outcome through which neighborhood drivers of health may impact cancer survivorship outcomes. We examined associations of neighborhood stressors and AL in 2,553 women with breast cancer recruited into the Pathways Study in 2006-2013. AL score was derived from biomarkers in the cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune domains of physiological stress measured within 3 years after baseline. Neighborhood data were appended to participants’ geocoded baseline addresses. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate associations between neighborhood stressors and risk of higher AL score. Adjusting for age and stage, high AL was positively associated with low versus high neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES; OR=2.24, 95% CI=1.61-3.12) and green space (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.18-2.03); high versus low traffic (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.01-1.72), crime (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.05-1.67), and household crowding (OR=1.57, 95% CI=1.22-2.01); and more versus no fast-food restaurants (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.21-1.84). Associations remained for nSES and fast-food restaurants after co-adjustment with other neighborhood stressors, and for fast-food restaurants after additional adjustment with individual sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Our preliminary findings can inform further studies of the physiological effects of neighborhood stressors, which collectively may help improve survivorship outcomes for the growing population of breast cancer survivors.\n\nAuthors: Sangaramoorthy, Meera;Samayoa, Cathy;Inamdar, Pushkar P;Roh, Janise M;Valice, Emily;Hong, Chi-Chen;Kwan, Marilyn L;Ambrosone, Christine B;Kushi, Lawrence H;Gomez, Scarlett Lin;Shariff-Marco, Salma\n\nAm J Epidemiol. 2024 Jun 18.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nProspective Evaluation of the Kaiser Permanente Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Biopsy-Naïve Men with Mild PSA Elevations\n\nOur goal was to assess the impact of providing prostate cancer risk estimates to patients and urologists among biopsy-naïve men with mild PSA elevations. This prospective intervention study was conducted in urology departments in Kaiser Permanente Northern California among biopsy-naïve men with mild PSA elevations (<10 ng/mL) between March 2021 and March 2023. The intervention was providing prostate cancer risk estimates for intermediate-/high-grade cancer (Grade Groups 2-5) and any cancer to patients and urologists using our previously validated risk calculator. Biopsy outcomes were compared to a historical comparison group biopsied between January 2016 and December 2019. Over 24 months, the risk calculator was used to estimate risk for 1962 men, of whom 1455 (74%) accepted the biopsy. The men who accepted the biopsy had higher predicted intermediate-/high-grade cancer risks (median 24%, interquartile range [IQR] 17%-31%, vs 20%, IQR 14%-29%; P < .0001) and higher predicted risks for any cancer (median 48%, IQR 40%-56%, vs 45%, IQR 37%-53%, respectively; P < .0001) than those who declined the biopsy. Compared to the historical group, use of the risk calculator resulted in a biopsy population enriched with intermediate-/high-grade cancer: 29% vs 25%; similar rates of low-grade cancer: 24% vs 24%; and fewer negative biopsies: 47% vs 51%, respectively; overall P = .013. In biopsy-naïve men with mild PSA elevations, use of this risk calculator resulted in a biopsy population that had more intermediate-/high-grade cancer and fewer negative biopsies compared to a historical group.\n\nAuthors: Presti, Joseph;Horton, Brandon;Alexeeff, Stacey;Prausnitz, Stephanie;Avins, Andrew L\n\nUrol Pract. 2024 Jun 14:101097UPJ0000000000000634.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nTrends in chemotherapy use for early-stage breast cancer from 2006 to 2019\n\nLittle is known about how use of chemotherapy has evolved in breast cancer patients. We therefore describe chemotherapy patterns for women with stage I-IIIA breast cancer in the Optimal Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Dosing (OBCD) Study using data from KPNC (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) and KPWA (Kaiser Permanente Washington). Among 33,670 women, aged 18 + y, diagnosed with primary stage I-IIIA breast cancer at KPNC and KPWA from 2006 to 2019, we explored patterns of intravenous chemotherapy use, defined here as receipt of intravenous cytotoxic drugs and/or anti-HER2 therapies. We evaluated trends in chemotherapy receipt, duration over which chemotherapy was received, and number of associated infusion visits. In secondary analyses, we stratified by receipt of anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab), given their longer duration. 38.9% received chemotherapy intravenously, declining from 40.2% in 2006 to 35.6% in 2019 (p-trend < 0.001). Among 13,089 women receiving chemotherapy, neoadjuvant treatment increased (4.1-14.7%; p-trend < 0.001), as did receipt of anti-HER2 therapies (20.8-30.9%) (p-trend < 0.001). The average treatment duration increased (5.3 to 6.0 months; p-trend < 0.001), as did the number of infusion visits (10.8 to 12.5; p-trend < 0.001). For those receiving anti-HER2 therapies, treatment duration and average number of visits decreased; among those not receiving anti-HER2 therapies, number of visits increased, with no change in duration. While the prevalence of chemotherapy receipt has decreased over time, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has increased, as has use of anti-HER2 therapies; duration and number of administration visits have also increased. Understanding these trends is useful to inform clinical and administrative planning.\n\nAuthors: Bhimani, Jenna;Ergas, Isaac J;Kolevska, Tatjana;Kroenke, Candyce H;Liu, Raymond;Kushi, Lawrence H;Kantor, Elizabeth D;et al.\n\nBreast Cancer Res. 2024 Jun 13;26(1):101.

Their efficacy relies on phase 2 enzyme metabolism and immune response activation, respectively. Dietary isothiocyanates, phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables, are phase 2 enzyme inducers and immunomodulators, and may impact treatment outcomes. We investigated the modifying effects of cruciferous vegetable and isothiocyanate intake on recurrence risk following MMC or BCG treatment. Self-reported cruciferous vegetable intake, estimated isothiocyanate intake, and urinary isothiocyanate metabolites were collected from 1158 patients with incident NMIBC in the prospective Be-Well Study. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated from Cox proportional hazards regression models for risk of first recurrences, and random effects Cox shared frailty models for multiple recurrences. Over median follow-up of 23 months, 343 (30%) recurrences occurred. Receipt of MMC and BCG was associated with decreased risks of first recurrence (MMC: HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.46-0.73; BCG: HR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49-0.88) and multiple recurrences (MMC: HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.44-0.68; BCG: HR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55-0.95). Patients receiving BCG and having high intake (>2.4 servings/mo), but not low intake, of raw cruciferous vegetables had reduced risk of recurrence (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.36-0.86; P for interaction = .02) and multiple recurrences (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34-0.77; P for interaction < .001). The inverse association between MMC receipt and recurrence risk was not modified. For NMIBC patients who receive induction BCG, increasing consumption of raw cruciferous vegetables could be a promising strategy to attenuate recurrence risk.\n\nAuthors: Kwan, Marilyn L;Ergas, Isaac J;Quesenberry, Charles P;Kushi, Lawrence H;Tang, Li;et al.\n\nJ Urol. 2024 Jun 07:101097JU0000000000004070.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nTranscriptome-wide association analysis identifies candidate susceptibility genes for prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer\n\nDeciphering the genetic basis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels may improve their utility for prostate cancer (PCa) screening. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 95,768 PCa-free men, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to examine impacts of genetically predicted gene expression on PSA. Analyses identified 41 statistically significant (p < 0.05/12,192 = 4.10 × 10-6) associations in whole blood and 39 statistically significant (p < 0.05/13,844 = 3.61 × 10-6) associations in prostate tissue, with 18 genes associated in both tissues. Cross-tissue analyses identified 155 statistically significantly (p < 0.05/22,249 = 2.25 × 10-6) genes. Out of 173 unique PSA-associated genes across analyses, we replicated 151 (87.3%) in a TWAS of 209,318 PCa-free individuals from the Million Veteran Program. Based on conditional analyses, we found 20 genes (11 single tissue, nine cross-tissue) that were associated with PSA levels in the discovery TWAS that were not attributable to a lead variant from a GWAS. Ten of these 20 genes replicated, and two of the replicated genes had colocalization probability of >0.5: CCNA2 and HIST1H2BN. Six of the 20 identified genes are not known to impact PCa risk. Fine-mapping based on whole blood and prostate tissue revealed five protein-coding genes with evidence of causal relationships with PSA levels. Of these five genes, four exhibited evidence of colocalization and one was conditionally independent of previous GWAS findings. These results yield hypotheses that should be further explored to improve understanding of genetic factors underlying PSA levels.\n\nAuthors: Chen, Dorothy M;Van Den Eeden, Stephen K;Graff, Rebecca E;et al.\n\nHGG Adv. 2024 Jun 06;5(3):100315.

We analyzed factors related to early (<5 years) vs late (≥5 years) recurrence in 2,992 women with stage I-IIB ER+ breast cancer in the Pathways Study, a prospective cohort of women with breast cancer enrolled between 2006 and 2013, with ascertainment of recurrence and death through December 2021. After a median follow-up of 13.3 years, 341 (13.8%) women had recurrences, including 181 (53.7%) with late recurrence. Higher stage and grade were associated with recurrence regardless of timing, whereas progesterone receptor (PR) negativity was associated with early but not late recurrence. Receipt of endocrine therapy was associated with reduced risk of overall recurrence, but the length of endocrine therapy was not significant in multivariable models. Minoritized racial and ethnic groups, including Asian, Black, and Hispanic women, had higher risk of early but not late recurrence, compared with non-Hispanic White women. The trend of higher risk of early recurrence among these groups remained after adjustment for clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors, but was statistically significant only in Asian women. Our study revealed potentially important distinctions for early vs late recurrence, including the associations with PR-negativity and self-identified race and ethnicity. Possible higher risk of early recurrence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic women provides novel evidence for the existence of disparities in cancer outcomes, even within the breast cancer subtype indicative of generally good prognosis.\n\nAuthors: Chua, Alfredo V;Kwan, Marilyn L;Ergas, Isaac J;Kushi, Lawrence H;Yao, Song;et al.\n\nJ Natl Cancer Inst. 2024 Jun 06.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nA Response-able Diagnosis: Type 2 Autoimmune Pancreatitis in the Setting of Ulcerative Colitis\n\nAuthors: Kane, Kevin;Velayos, Fernando S;Lee, Jeffrey K;Cherny, Sarah;Karia, Kunal\n\nDig Dis Sci. 2024 Jun;69(6):1934-1938.

To inform CRC risk prediction and MHT risk-benefit assessment, we aimed to evaluate the joint association of a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CRC and MHT on CRC risk. We used data from 28,486 postmenopausal women (11,519 cases and 16,967 controls) of European descent. A PRS based on 141 CRC-associated genetic variants was modeled as a categorical variable in quartiles. Multiplicative interaction between PRS and MHT use was evaluated using logistic regression. Additive interaction was measured using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). 30-year cumulative risks of CRC for 50-year-old women according to MHT use and PRS were calculated. The reduction in odds ratios by MHT use was larger in women within the highest quartile of PRS compared to that in women within the lowest quartile of PRS (p-value = 2.7 × 10-8). At the highest quartile of PRS, the 30-year CRC risk was statistically significantly lower for women taking any MHT than for women not taking any MHT, 3.7% (3.3%-4.0%) vs 6.1% (5.7%-6.5%) (difference 2.4%, P-value = 1.83 × 10-14); these differences were also statistically significant but smaller in magnitude in the lowest PRS quartile, 1.6% (1.4%-1.8%) vs 2.2% (1.9%-2.4%) (difference 0.6%, P-value = 1.01 × 10-3), indicating 4 times greater reduction in absolute risk associated with any MHT use in the highest compared to the lowest quartile of genetic CRC risk. MHT use has a greater impact on the reduction of CRC risk for women at higher genetic risk. These findings have implications for the development of risk prediction models for CRC and potentially for the consideration of genetic information in the risk-benefit assessment of MHT use.\n\nAuthors: Tian, Yu;Sakoda, Lori C;Chang-Claude, Jenny;et al.\n\nBr J Cancer. 2024 Jun;130(10):1687-1696.

We aimed to examine the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis (pPPX) and compare two risk assessment methods for HA VTE: a retrospective electronic Padua Score (ePaduaKP) and admitting clinician’s choice of risk within the admission orderset (low, moderate, or high). We retrospectively analyzed prophylaxis orders for adult medical admissions (2013-2019) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, excluding surgical and ICU patients. ePaduaKP was calculated for all admissions. For a subset of these admissions, clinician-assigned HA VTE risk was extracted. Descriptive pPPX utilization rates between ePaduaKP and clinician-assigned risk as well as concordance between ePaduaKP and clinician-assigned risk. Among 849,059 encounters, 82.2% were classified as low risk by ePaduaKP, with 42.3% receiving pPPX. In the subset with clinician-assigned risk (608,512 encounters), low and high ePaduaKP encounters were classified as moderate risk in 87.5% and 92.0% of encounters, respectively. Overall, 56.7% of encounters with moderate clinician-assigned risk received pPPX, compared to 7.2% of encounters with low clinician-assigned risk. pPPX use occurred in a large portion of low ePaduaKP risk encounters. Clinicians frequently assigned moderate risk to encounters at admission irrespective of their ePaduaKP risk when retrospectively examined. We hypothesize that the current orderset design may have negatively influenced clinician-assigned risk choice as well as pPPX utilization. Future work should explore optimizing pPPX for high-risk patients only.\n\nAuthors: Xu, James;Neeman, Elad;Thai, Khanh K;Mishra, Pranita;Schlessinger, David;Clancy, Heather;Myers, Laura;Roubinian, Nareg;Liu, Vincent;Liu, Raymond\n\nJ Hosp Med. 2024 Jun;19(6):449-459.

We describe diagnostic processes, previously seldom reported, for a common hereditary cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome (LS), using EHR data within a community-based, multicenter, demographically diverse health system. Within a retrospective cohort enrolled between 2015 and 2020 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we assessed electronic diagnostic domains for LS including (1) family history of LS-associated cancer; (2) personal history of LS-associated cancer; (3) LS screening via mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) testing of newly diagnosed malignancy; (4) germline genetic test results; and (5) clinician-entered diagnostic codes for LS. We calculated proportions and overlap for each diagnostic domain descriptively. Among 5.8 million individuals, (1) 28,492 (0.49%) had a family history of LS-associated cancer of whom 3,635 (13%) underwent genetic testing; (2) 100,046 (1.7%) had a personal history of a LS-associated cancer; and (3) 8,711 (0.1%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer of whom 7,533 (86%) underwent MMRD screening and of the positive screens (486), 130 (27%) underwent germline testing. One thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven (0.03%) were diagnosed with endometrial cancer of whom 1,613 (92%) underwent MMRD screening and of the 195 who screened positive, 55 (28%) underwent genetic testing. (4) 30,790 (0.05%) had LS germline genetic testing with 707 (0.01%) testing positive; and (5) 1,273 (0.02%) had a clinician-entered diagnosis of LS. It is feasible to electronically characterize the diagnostic processes of LS. No single data source comprehensively identifies all LS carriers. There is underutilization of LS genetic testing for those eligible and underdiagnosis of LS. Our work informs similar efforts in other settings for hereditary cancer syndromes.\n\nAuthors: Sharaf, Ravi N;Udaltsova, Natalia;Li, Dan;Pai, Rish K;Sinha, Soham;Li, Zixuan;Corley, Douglas A\n\nJCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2024 Jun;8:e2300157.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nTwo genome-wide interaction loci modify the association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with colorectal cancer\n\nRegular, long-term aspirin use may act synergistically with genetic variants, particularly those in mechanistically relevant pathways, to confer a protective effect on colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We leveraged pooled data from 52 clinical trial, cohort, and case-control studies that included 30,806 CRC cases and 41,861 controls of European ancestry to conduct a genome-wide interaction scan between regular aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and imputed genetic variants. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, we identified statistically significant interactions between regular aspirin/NSAID use and variants in 6q24.1 (top hit rs72833769), which has evidence of influencing expression of TBC1D7 (a subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, a key regulator of MTOR activity), and variants in 5p13.1 (top hit rs350047), which is associated with expression of PTGER4 (codes a cell surface receptor directly involved in the mode of action of aspirin). Genetic variants with functional impact may modulate the chemopreventive effect of regular aspirin use, and our study identifies putative previously unidentified targets for additional mechanistic interrogation.\n\nAuthors: Drew, David A;Sakoda, Lori C;Gauderman, W James;et al.\n\nSci Adv. 2024 May 31;10(22):eadk3121.

A less-explored barrier to appropriate follow-up is repeat fecal testing after a positive test. We investigated this phenomenon using mixed methods. This sequential mixed methods study included quantitative data from a large cohort of patients 50-89 years from four healthcare systems with a positive fecal test 2010-2018 and qualitative data from interviews with physicians and patients. Logistic regression was used to evaluate whether repeat testing was associated with failure to complete subsequent colonoscopy and to identify factors associated with repeat testing. Interviews were coded and analyzed to explore reasons for repeat testing. A total of 316,443 patients had a positive fecal test. Within 1 year, 76.3% received a colonoscopy without repeat fecal testing, 3% repeated testing and then received a colonoscopy, 4.4% repeated testing without colonoscopy, and 16.3% did nothing. Among repeat testers (7.4% of total cohort, N = 23,312), 59% did not receive a colonoscopy within 1 year. In adjusted models, those with an initial positive test followed by a negative second test were significantly less likely to receive colonoscopy than those with two successive positive tests (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.35-0.40). Older age (65-75 vs. 50-64 years: OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.33-1.41) and higher comorbidity score (≥ 4 vs. 0: OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.67-1.83) were significantly associated with repeat testing compared to those who received colonoscopy without repeat tests. Qualitative interview data revealed reasons underlying repeat testing, including colonoscopy avoidance, bargaining, and disbelief of positive results. Among patients in this cohort, 7.4% repeated fecal testing after an initial positive test. Of those, over half did not go on to receive a colonoscopy within 1 year. Efforts to improve CRC screening must address repeat fecal testing after a positive test as a barrier to completing colonoscopy.\n\nAuthors: Hahn, Erin E;Levin, Theodore R;Levin, Theodore R;et al.\n\nJ Gen Intern Med. 2024 May 21.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nLead Time and Immortal Time Biases Impact the Calculation of Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancer Survival\n\nAuthors: Kang, James H-E;Jensen, Christopher D;Merchant, Sophie A;Lee, Jeffrey K\n\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2024 May 21.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nAssociation of Ultra-Processed Food and Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Food Consumption With Bowel Habits Among US Adults\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) may have a negative impact on bowel habits. We aimed to assess the association between UPF and unprocessed or minimally processed food (MPF) intake and bowel habits among US adults. We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2010). We used two 24-hour dietary recalls and, based on the Nova classification, calculated intakes of UPFs and MPFs. Constipation and diarrhea were defined using the Bristol Stool Form Scale and stool frequency. We performed survey-weighted logistic regression and substitution analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among 12,716 US adults, there were 1,290 cases of constipation and 1,067 cases of diarrhea. Median UPF and MPF intakes were 26.5% and 66.2% of total grams per day, respectively. Greater UPF consumption (in % gram/d) was associated with higher odds of constipation (aORQ4 vs Q1, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.76-2.74) (Ptrend <.001) but not diarrhea (aORQ4 vs Q1, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.09) (Ptrend =0.12). Increased MPF consumption was associated with lower odds of constipation (aORQ4 vs Q1, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37-0.57) (Ptrend <.001). Associations with constipation were attenuated after adjusting for diet quality (aORQ4 vs Q1, UPF =1.53; MPF =0.69). Substituting 10% of UPF intake with an equivalent proportion of MPFs was associated with lower odds of constipation (aOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93). UPF intake was associated with higher odds of constipation whereas the odds were lower with greater MPF consumption. The effect of food processing on bowel habits was independent of diet quality.\n\nAuthors: Lo, Chun-Han;Zhao, Longgang;Steele, Euridice Martinez;Pan, Chun-Wei;Lee, Jeffrey K;Zhang, Xuehong;Singh, Harminder;Samadder, N Jewel\n\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2024 May 15.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nMammographic density mediates the protective effect of early-life body size on breast cancer risk\n\nThe unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk may be mediated via mammographic density (MD). Here, we investigate a complex relationship between adiposity in childhood and adulthood, puberty onset, MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)), and their effects on breast cancer. We use Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR to estimate the total and direct effects of adiposity and age at menarche on MD phenotypes. Childhood adiposity has a decreasing effect on DA, while adulthood adiposity increases NDA. Later menarche increases DA/PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect is attenuated. Next, we examine the effect of MD on breast cancer risk. DA/PD have a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD SNPs estimates are heterogeneous, and additional analyses suggest that different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, we evaluate the role of MD in the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer. Mediation MR analysis shows that 56% (95% CIs [32%-79%]) of this effect is mediated via DA. Our finding suggests that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, subsequently reducing breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is important for identifying potential intervention targets.\n\nAuthors: Vabistsevits, Marina;Davey Smith, George;Richardson, Tom G;Richmond, Rebecca C;Sieh, Weiva;Rothstein, Joseph H;Habel, Laurel A;Alexeeff, Stacey E;Lloyd-Lewis, Bethan;Sanderson, Eleanor\n\nNat Commun. 2024 May 13;15(1):4021.

Using Switzerland as a case study, we estimated the population-level impact of this recommendation. We predicted the CRC risk of all respondents to the population-based Swiss Health Survey. We derived the distribution of risk-based screening start age, assuming predicted risk was calculated every 5 years between ages 25 and 70 and screening started when this risk exceeded 3%. Next, the MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model evaluated biennial faecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening with this risk-based start age. As a comparison, we simulated screening initiation based on age and sex. Starting screening only when predicted risk exceeded 3% meant 82% of women and 90% of men would not start screening before age 65 and 60, respectively. This would require 43%-57% fewer tests, result in 8%-16% fewer CRC deaths prevented and yield 19%-33% fewer lifeyears gained compared with screening from age 50. Screening women from age 65 and men from age 60 had a similar impact as screening only when predicted risk exceeded 3%. With the recommended risk prediction tool, the population impact of the BMJ Rapid Recommendation would be similar to screening initiation based on age and sex only. It would delay screening initiation by 10-15 years. Although halving the screening burdens, screening benefits would be reduced substantially compared with screening initiation at age 50. This suggests that the 3% risk threshold to start CRC screening might be too high.\n\nAuthors: van Duuren, Luuk A;Bulliard, Jean-Luc;Mohr, Ella;van den Puttelaar, Rosita;Plys, Ekaterina;Brändle, Karen;Corley, Douglas A;Froehlich, Florian;Selby, Kevin;Lansdorp-Vogelaar, Iris\n\nBMJ Open Gastroenterol. 2024 May 09;11(1).

Needs assessment is recognized as an important component of cancer care delivery, ideally beginning during active treatment to connect patients with supportive services that address these issues in a timely manner. Despite the recognized importance of this process, many health care systems have struggled to implement a feasible and sustainable needs assessment and management system. This article uses an implementation science framework to guide pragmatic implementation of a needs assessment clinical system in cancer care. According to this framework, successful implementation requires four steps including (1) choosing a needs assessment tool; (2) carefully considering the provider level, clinic level, and health care system-level strengths and barriers to implementation and creating a pilot system that addresses these factors; (3) making the assessment system actionable by matching needs with clinical workflow; and (4) demonstrating the value of the system to support sustainability.\n\nAuthors: Stout, Nicole L;Alfano, Catherine M;Liu, Raymond;Dixit, Niharika;Jefford, Michael\n\nJCO Oncol Pract. 2024 May 06:OP2300482.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nOvarian cancer risk among older patients with stable adnexal masses\n\nFew studies have evaluated the risk of cancer among older patients with stable adnexal masses in community-based settings to determine the duration of observation time needed. This study aimed to assess the ovarian cancer risk among older patients with stable adnexal masses on ultrasound. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in a large community-based health system aged ≥50 years with an adnexal mass <10 cm on ultrasound between 2016 and 2020 who had at least 1 follow-up ultrasound performed ≥6 weeks after initial ultrasound. Masses were considered stable on follow-up examination if they did not exhibit an increase of >1 cm in the greatest dimension or a change in standardized reported ultrasound characteristics. Ovarian cancer risk was determined at increasing time intervals of stability after initial ultrasound. Among 4061 patients with stable masses, the average age was 61 years (range, 50-99), with an initial mass size of 3.8 cm (range, 0.2-9.9). With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 11 cancers were detected, with an absolute risk of 0.27%. Ovarian cancer risk declined with longer duration of stability, from 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.30-1.17) per 1000 person-years at 6 to 12 weeks, 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-1.07) at 13 to 24 weeks, 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.87) at 25 to 52 weeks, and 0.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.00) at >52 weeks. Expressed as number needed to reimage, ongoing ultrasound imaging would be needed for 369 patients whose masses show stability at 6 to 12 weeks, 410 patients at 13 to 24 weeks, 583 patients at 25 to 52 weeks, and >1142 patients with stable masses at 53 to 104 weeks to detect 1 case of ovarian cancer. In a diverse community-based setting, among patients aged ≥50 years with an adnexal mass that was stable for at least 6 weeks after initial ultrasound, the risk of ovarian cancer was very low at 0.27%. Longer demonstrated duration of stability was associated with progressively lower risk, with no cancer cases observed after 52 weeks of stability. These findings suggest that the benefit of ultrasound monitoring of stable masses beyond 12 months is minimal and may be outweighed by potential risks of repeated imaging.\n\nAuthors: Suh-Burgmann, Elizabeth J;Hung, Yun-Yi;Schmittdiel, Julie A\n\nAm J Obstet Gynecol. 2024 May 02.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nCirculating immune signatures in chronic pancreatitis with and without preceding acute pancreatitis: A pilot study\n\nTo investigate profiles of circulating immune signatures in healthy controls and chronic pancreatitis patients (CP) with and without a preceding history of acute pancreatitis (AP). We performed a phase 1, cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected serum samples from the PROspective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for EpidEmiologic and Translation StuDies (PROCEED) study. All samples were collected during a clinically quiescent phase. CP subjects were categorized into two subgroups based on preceding episode(s) of AP. Healthy controls were included for comparison. Blinded samples were analyzed using an 80-plex Luminex assay of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Group and pairwise comparisons of analytes were performed between the subgroups. In total, 133 patients with CP (111 with AP and 22 without AP) and 50 healthy controls were included. Among the 80 analytes studied, CP patients with a history of AP had significantly higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-15) and chemokines (Cutaneous T-Cell Attracting Chemokine (CTACK), Monokine induced Gamma Interferon (MIG), Macrophage-derived Chemokine (MDC), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1)) compared to CP without preceding AP and controls. In contrast, CP patients without AP had immune profiles characterized by low systemic inflammation and downregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators, including IL-10. CP patients with a preceding history of AP have signs of systemic inflammatory activity even during a clinically quiescent phase. In contrast, CP patients without a history of AP have low systemic inflammatory activity. These findings suggest the presence of two immunologically diverse subtypes of CP.\n\nAuthors: Hagn-Meincke, Rasmus;Van Den Eeden, Stephen K;Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC),;et al.\n\nPancreatology. 2024 May;24(3):384-393.

Despite rapid growth of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations in the US, limited research exists on their pubertal timing, potentially masking health disparities. To examine pubertal timing among Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander children and adolescents by disaggregating ethnic subgroups. This retrospective cohort study included Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander youths aged 5 to 18 years assessed for pubertal development at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large, integrated health care delivery system. Follow-up occurred from March 2005, through December 31, 2019. Data were analyzed in October 2023. Race and ethnicity, categorized into 11 ethnic subgroups: Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Other South Asian, Other Southeast Asian, Vietnamese, multiethnic, and multiracial. Pubertal timing was determined using physician-assessed sexual maturity ratings (SMRs). Outcomes included the median age at transition from SMR 1 (prepubertal) to SMR 2 or higher (pubertal) for onset of genital development (gonadarche) in boys, breast development (thelarche) in girls, and pubic hair development (pubarche) in both boys and girls. In this cohort of 107 325 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander children and adolescents (54.61% boys; 12.96% Asian Indian, 22.24% Chinese, 26.46% Filipino, 1.80% Japanese, 1.66% Korean, 1.96% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, 0.86% Other South Asian, 3.26% Other Southeast Asian, 5.99% Vietnamese, 0.74% multiethnic, and 22.05% multiracial), the overall median ages for girls’ pubarche and thelarche were 10.98 years (95% CI, 10.96-11.01 years) and 10.13 years (95% CI, 10.11-10.15 years), respectively. For boys’ pubarche and gonadarche, median ages were 12.08 years (95% CI, 12.06-12.10 years) and 11.54 years (95% CI, 11.52-11.56 years), respectively. Differences between subgroups with earliest and latest median age at onset were 14 months for girls’ pubarche, 8 months for thelarche, 8 months for boys’ pubarche, and 4 months for gonadarche. In general, Asian Indian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, and Other South Asian subgroups had the earliest ages at onset across pubertal markers, while East Asian youths exhibited the latest onset. Restricting to those with healthy body mass index did not substantially change the findings. In this cohort study of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander children and adolescents, pubertal timing varied considerably across ethnic subgroups. Further investigation is warranted to assess whether these differences contribute to observed health disparities in adulthood, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nAuthors: Kubo, Ai;Acker, Julia;Aghaee, Sara;Kushi, Lawrence H;Quesenberry, Charles P;Greenspan, Louise C;Srinivasan, Shylaja;Kanaya, Alka M;Deardorff, Julianna\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2024 May 01;7(5):e2410253.

This perspective article summarizes the components of traditional Latin American, Asian, and African heritage diets, their association with diet quality and markers of health, and implications for nutrition programs and policy. Though these diets differ in specific foods and flavors, we present a common thread that emphasizes healthful plant foods and that is consistent with high dietary quality and low rates of major causes of disability and deaths. In this perspective, we propose that nutrition interventions that incorporate these cultural models of healthy eating show promise, though further research is needed to determine health outcomes and best practices for implementation.\n\nAuthors: LeBlanc, Kelly E;Baer-Sinnott, Sara;Lancaster, Kristie J;Campos, Hannia;Lau, Ka Hei Karen;Tucker, Katherine L;Kushi, Lawrence H;Willett, Walter C\n\nAdv Nutr. 2024 May;15(5):100221.

Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 7925 AYA survivors (aged 15-39 years at diagnosis) who were 2-5 years from diagnosis in 2006-2020 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. We calculated ED utilization rates overall and by indication of the encounter (headache, cardiac issues, and suicide attempts). We estimated rate changes by survivorship year and patient factors associated with ED visit using a Poisson model. Results: Cohort was 65.4% women, 45.8% Hispanic, with mean age at diagnosis at 31.3 years. Overall, 38% of AYA survivors had ≥1 ED visit (95th percentile: 5 ED visits). Unadjusted ED rates declined from 374.2/1000 person-years (PY) in Y2 to 327.2 in Y5 (p change < 0.001). Unadjusted rates declined for headache, cardiac issues, and suicide attempts. Factors associated with increased ED use included: age 20-24 at diagnosis [relative risk (RR) = 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.56 vs. 35-39 years]; female (RR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.47 vs. male); non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.38-1.95 vs. non-Hispanic white); comorbidity (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.16-1.55 for 1 and RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.40-2.30 for 2+ vs. none); and public insurance (RR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.70-2.32 vs. private). Compared with thyroid cancer, cancers associated with increased ED use were breast (RR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-1.70), cervical (RR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.76-2.71), colorectal (RR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.94-2.81), and sarcoma (RR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.88).

We sought to fine-map all known CRC risk loci using GWAS data from 100,204 cases and 154,587 controls of East Asian and European ancestry. Our stepwise conditional analyses revealed 238 independent association signals of CRC risk, each with a set of credible causal variants (CCVs), of which 28 signals had a single CCV. Our cis-eQTL/mQTL and colocalization analyses using colorectal tissue-specific transcriptome and methylome data separately from 1299 and 321 individuals, along with functional genomic investigation, uncovered 136 putative CRC susceptibility genes, including 56 genes not previously reported. Analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data from colorectal tissues revealed 17 putative CRC susceptibility genes with distinct expression patterns in specific cell types. Analyses of whole exome sequencing data provided additional support for several target genes identified in this study as CRC susceptibility genes. Enrichment analyses of the 136 genes uncover pathways not previously linked to CRC risk. Our study substantially expanded association signals for CRC and provided additional insight into the biological mechanisms underlying CRC development.\n\nAuthors: Chen, Zhishan;Sakoda, Lori C;Zheng, Wei;et al.\n\nNat Commun. 2024 Apr 26;15(1):3557.

Participants with no history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), or coronary heart failure from the Women’s Health Initiative Extension Study II self-reported social isolation, loneliness, health behaviors, health status, and veteran status. CVD and CVD subevents were physician adjudicated. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the Interquartile Range (IQR) in social isolation (IQR = 1) and loneliness (IQR=.33) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for sociodemographic, health behavior, and health status characteristics. Veteran status was tested as an effect modifier. Among 52,442 women (Mean age = 79 ± 6.1; veterans n = 1023; 89.2% non-Hispanic White), 3579 major CVD events occurred over an average 5.8 follow-up years. Compared to nonveterans, veteran women reported higher levels of social isolation (p < .01) and loneliness (p < .01). The CVD HR was 1.07 (95% CI, 1.04-1.10) for the IQR in social isolation and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.10-1.06) for the IQR in loneliness. The HR for the IQR in both social isolation and loneliness was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.15). Social isolation was associated with CHD (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21). The CHD HR for the IQR in social isolation was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21). Associations did not differ by veteran status (all p-interactions > 0.08).

This study examined associations between ECOG PS and adverse outcomes in a diverse community oncology population. In this retrospective cohort study, demographic and clinical characteristics, including the most recent ECOG PS between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, were examined for patients receiving cancer treatment within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the effect of ECOG PS on adverse outcomes. A total of 21,730 patients were identified. Overall, most patients had an ECOG PS of 0 (42.5%) or 1 (42.5%). In multivariable analysis, an ECOG PS of 3 or 4 was associated with higher risk of 30-day emergency department visits (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.85; 95% CI, 3.47-4.26), 30-day hospitalizations (aHR, 4.70; 95% CI, 4.12-5.36), and 6-month mortality (aHR, 7.34; 95% CI, 6.64-8.11) compared with an ECOG PS of 0. Additionally, we found that upper gastrointestinal and stage IV cancers were associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes compared with breast and stage I cancers, respectively. When adjusted for ECOG PS, African American race, Asian race, and female sex were associated with a lower risk of mortality than White race and male sex. An ECOG PS of 3 or 4 was more predictive of mortality in younger patients and those with breast cancer (P<.001). ECOG PS and upper gastrointestinal and stage IV cancers were independently associated with increased risk of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality, whereas African American and Asian race and female sex were associated with decreased risk of mortality. An ECOG PS of 3 or 4 was more predictive of an increased risk of mortality in younger patients and patients with breast cancer. These findings can enhance the use of ECOG PS for clinical decision-making and defining eligibility for clinical trials.\n\nAuthors: Kumar, Deepika;Neeman, Elad;Zhu, Shiyun;Sun, Hongxin;Kotak, Dinesh;Liu, Raymond\n\nJ Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2024 Apr 23;22(2D).

The increasing availability of imaging artificial intelligence enables development of more comprehensive imaging biomarkers to objectively phenotype frailty in surgical patients. To evaluate the associations of body composition scores derived from multiple skeletal muscle and adipose tissue measurements from automated segmentation of computed tomography (CT) with the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and adverse outcomes after abdominal surgery. This retrospective cohort study used CT imaging and electronic health record data from a random sample of adults who underwent abdominal surgery at 20 medical centers within Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from April 1, 2022, to December 1, 2023. Body composition derived from automated analysis of multislice abdominal CT scans. The primary outcome of the study was all-cause 30-day postdischarge readmission or postoperative mortality. The secondary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity among patients undergoing abdominal surgery who were sampled for reporting to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The study included 48 444 adults; mean [SD] age at surgery was 61 (17) years, and 51% were female. Using principal component analysis, 3 body composition scores were derived: body size, muscle quantity and quality, and distribution of adiposity. Higher muscle quantity and quality scores were inversely correlated (r = -0.42; 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.41) with the HFRS and associated with a reduced risk of 30-day readmission or mortality (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56-0.67) and 30-day postoperative morbidity (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: relative risk, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52-0.67), independent of sex, age, comorbidities, body mass index, procedure characteristics, and the HFRS. In contrast to the muscle score, scores for body size and greater subcutaneous and intermuscular vs visceral adiposity had inconsistent associations with postsurgical outcomes and were attenuated and only associated with 30-day postoperative morbidity after adjustment for the HFRS. In this study, higher muscle quantity and quality scores were correlated with frailty and associated with 30-day readmission and postoperative mortality and morbidity, whereas body size and adipose tissue distribution scores were not correlated with patient frailty and had inconsistent associations with surgical outcomes. The findings suggest that assessment of muscle quantity and quality on CT can provide an objective measure of patient frailty that would not otherwise be clinically apparent and that may complement existing risk stratification tools to identify patients at high risk of mortality, morbidity, and readmission.\n\nAuthors: Fumagalli, Ijeamaka Anyene;Le, Sidney T;Peng, Peter D;Kipnis, Patricia;Liu, Vincent X;Caan, Bette;Chow, Vincent;Beg, Mirza Faisal;Popuri, Karteek;Cespedes Feliciano, Elizabeth M\n\nJAMA Surg. 2024 Apr 10.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nUtilization of Pancreatic Endotherapy in Patients with Chronic Pancreatitis: Results From a Multicenter Cohort Study in the United States\n\nAlthough commonly used for treating complications of chronic pancreatitis (CP), data on the frequency and factors associated with the use of pancreatic endotherapy (PET) are limited. Our aim was to define the utilization and factors predictive for receiving PET in a well-characterized CP cohort. This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from PROCEED, a multicenter US cohort study of CP. PET modalities primarily consisted of ERCP. A treatment course was defined as the number of sessions performed for a specific indication. A repeat course was defined as PET >1 year after completion of the last course. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictive factors for receiving PET, and proportional rates model assessed risk factors for repeat PET. Of a total of 681 subjects, 238 (34.9%) received PET. Factors associated with receiving PET included female sex (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03-1.53), lower education (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04-1.62), income ≤ $50,000 per year (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.07-1.71) and prior acute pancreatitis (AP) (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.32). 103/238 subjects (43.3%) underwent repeat PET at a median duration of 2 years with 23.1% receiving 2 courses, 9.7% receiving 3 courses, and 10.4% receiving 4+ courses.

Cost-conscious prescribing and inclusion of low-cost alternatives can help mitigate this burden, but cost transparency at the point of prescribing remains a major barrier to doing so. Pharmacy assistance programs, including co-payment cards and patient assistance programs administered by manufacturers and foundation-based grants, remain an essential resource for patients facing prohibitive co-payments for OAMs. However, access to these programs is fraught with complexities, including lack of trained financial navigators, limited transparency on eligibility criteria, onerous documentation burdens, and limits in available funding. Despite these drawbacks and the potential for such programs to incentivize manufacturers to keep list prices high, assistance programs have been demonstrated to improve financial well-being for patients with cancer. The increasing development of integrated specialty pharmacies with dedicated, trained pharmacy staff can help improve and standardize access to such programs, but these services are disproportionately available to patients seen at tertiary care centers. Multistakeholder interventions are needed to mitigate the burden of cost sharing for OAMs, including increased clinician knowledge of financial resources and novel assistance mechanisms, investment of institutions in trained financial navigation services and centralized platforms to identify assistance programs, and policies to cap out-of-pocket spending and improve transparency of rates charged by pharmacy benefit managers to a health plan.\n\nAuthors: Ragavan, Meera V;Swartz, Scott;Clark, Mackenzie;Chino, Fumiko\n\nJCO Oncol Pract. 2024 Apr;20(4):472-482.

LUTS were defined by American Urologic Association Symptom Index (AUASI) scores and impact on quality of life (QoL). Separate questions assessed urinary incontinence (UI) and postvoid dribbling. We performed cluster analyses using AUASI scores, with and without urine incontinence and postvoid dribbling, and impact collected in 2010-11. We performed analyses to evaluate sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors between clusters. Among CARDIA men (mean age: 50.0, SD = 3.6; range: 42-56 years) with complete LUTS data (n = 929), we identified and compared four clusters: men who reported no or very mild symptoms and no impact on well-being (bladder health, n = 696, 75%), men with moderate symptoms and moderate impact on well-being (moderate symptoms/impact, n = 84, 9%), men with high symptoms and high impact on well-being (severe symptoms/impact, n = 117, 13%), and a separate group that reported moderate symptoms and UI with a high impact on well-being (UI + moderate symptoms/severe impact, n = 32, 3%). Exploration of the groupings showed a large percentage of postvoid dribbling across groups (overall 69%). Sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with symptom/impact groups. Bladder health clustered into four categories. A majority of middle-aged men in the community showed no or mild bladder symptoms without impact on QoL. Postvoid dribbling is pervasive but did not cluster with a specific LUTS or impact category.\n\nAuthors: Markland, Alayne D;Hellemann, Gerhard;Shan, Liang;Brady, Sonya S;Huling, Jared D;Schreiner, Pamela J;Sidney, Stephen;Van Den Eeden, Stephen K;Lewis, Cora E\n\nNeurourol Urodyn. 2024 Apr;43(4):840-848.

We followed 2,952 participants in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) who were premenopausal or early perimenopausal and diabetes-free at baseline. SHBG,T, and estradiol (E2) levels were measured at up to 13 follow-up visits (over up to 17 years). We used complementary log-log-based discrete-time survival models anchored at baseline. Diabetes developed in 376 women. A 5-unit increase in time-varying SHBG was associated with a 10% reduced risk of diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95), adjusting for covariates, and baseline SHBG,T, and E2 levels. Time-varying T was not associated with diabetes risk. Compared with the lowest quartile for annual rate of change of SHBG since baseline (quartile 1 [Q1] -92.3 to -1.5 nmol/L), all other quartiles were associated with a decreased risk of diabetes adjusting for covariates and baseline SHBG; associations persisted after adjusting for rate of change of T and E2 (Q2 [> -1.5 to -0.2 nmol/L] HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.48; Q3 [> -0.2 to 1.3 nmol/L] HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.55; Q4 [>1.3 to 82.0 nmol/L] HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30-0.63). Increasing levels of SHBG over the menopause transition were associated with a decreased risk of incident diabetes. Stable to increasing rates of change in SHBG were also independently associated with a decreased risk of diabetes compared with decreasing rates of change, suggesting SHBG may affect glucose through a mechanism beyond androgenicity.\n\nAuthors: Hedderson, Monique M;Capra, Angela;Lee, Catherine;Habel, Laurel A;Lee, Jennifer;Gold, Ellen B;Badon, Sylvia E;Mitro, Susanna D;El Khoudary, Samar R\n\nDiabetes Care. 2024 Apr 01;47(4):676-682.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nA novel body composition risk score (B-Score) and overall survival among patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer\n\nMeasurements (amount, distribution, and radiodensity) of muscle and adipose tissue were reported to be individually associated with overall survival in patients with breast cancer. However, they were not typically combined to develop an overall risk score, which can identify patients at high risk of death and prioritize patients in need of dietary and lifestyle interventions. Thus, we aimed to develop a novel composite body composition risk score (B-Score). We included 3105 patients with stage II or III breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Dana Farber Cancer Institute. From CT scans at diagnosis, we assessed areas and radiodensity of muscle and adipose tissue at the third lumber vertebrae. We considered skeletal muscle index (SMI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) and SAT radiodensity as they were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Each measurement was dichotomized using optimal stratification, with low SMI (<40.1 cm2/m2), high SATI (≥75.7 cm2/m2), and high SAT radiodensity (≥-97.2HU) considered risk factors. We calculated B-Score as the sum of these factors and estimated its association with overall survival using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for clinicopathologic factors. Mean (standard deviation) age was 53.9 (11.8) years, 70.3% were Non-Hispanic White, and 60.5% were stage II. Most patients (60.6%) had only one body composition risk factor (B-Score = 1). Compared to those with no risk factors (B-Score = 0), the risk of death increased with more body composition risk factors: the adjusted hazard ratios were 1.10 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.42), 1.47 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.92), and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.26, 3.53) for B-Scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Ptrend < 0.001). More unfavorable body composition characteristics were associated with increased risks of overall mortality in a dose-response manner. Considering body composition measurements together as a composite score (B-Score) may improve risk stratification and inform dietary and lifestyle interventions following breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nAuthors: Cheng, En;Caan, Bette J;Chen, Wendy Y;Prado, Carla M;Cespedes Feliciano, Elizabeth M\n\nClin Nutr. 2024 Apr;43(4):981-987.

Given that aggressive tumours can adversely impact body composition and even non-metastatic tumours can be aggressive, we evaluated associations between pre-surgical body composition features and tumour pathological features in patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC). The Resolve Cohort consists of 1239 patients with non-metastatic ccRCC who underwent nephrectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2000 and 2020. The cross-sectional areas and radiodensities of skeletal muscle, visceral adipose, and subcutaneous adipose tissues were determined from pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) scans at the third lumbar vertebrae using Automatica software. Pearson’s correlation coefficients describe inter-relationships among BMI and body composition variables, while odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimate associations between continuous body composition features (per 1-standard deviation) and advanced stage (Stage III vs. Stages I-II) and high Fuhrman grade (Grades 3-4 vs. 1-2) from multivariable logistic regression models that considered the potential impact of biological sex, contrast enhanced CTs, and early age at onset of ccRCC. The cohort was predominantly male (69%), white (89%), and had a median age of 58. The proportion of patients presenting with advanced stage and high-grade disease were 31% and 51%, respectively. In models that adjusted for demographics and all body composition variables simultaneously, decreasing skeletal muscle radiodensity (i.e., more fat infiltration) but increasing visceral adipose tissue radiodensity (i.e., more lipid depletion) were associated with advanced tumour features. Per 8.4 HU decrease in skeletal muscle radiodensity, the odds of presenting with advanced stage was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.34-1.93). Per 7.22 HU increase in visceral adipose tissue radiodensity, the odds of presenting with advanced stage was 1.45 (95% CI: 1.22-1.74). Skeletal muscle index (i.e., sarcopenia) was not associated with either tumour feature. Similar associations were observed for Fuhrman grade, a more direct marker of tumour aggressiveness. Associations did not differ by sex, contrast use, or age at onset of ccRCC. Lipid infiltrated skeletal muscle, but lipid depleted visceral adipose tissue were independently associated with advanced tumour features in non-metastatic ccRCC. Findings highlight the importance of evaluating the full range of body composition features simultaneously in multivariable models. Interpreting pre-surgical CTs for body composition for patients may be a novel and non-invasive way to identify patients with aggressive renal tumours, which is clinically relevant as renal biopsies are not routinely performed.\n\nAuthors: Furberg, Helena;Caan, Bette;Mourtzakis, Marina;et al.\n\nJ Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle. 2024 Apr;15(2):726-734.

This study aims to investigate whether genetic variations in key ITC-metabolizing/functioning genes modify the associations between dietary ITC exposure and NMIBC prognosis outcomes. In the Bladder Cancer Epidemiology, Wellness, and Lifestyle Study (Be-Well Study), a prospective cohort of 1472 incident NMIBC patients, dietary ITC exposure is assessed by self-reported CV intake and measured in plasma ITC-albumin adducts. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine key ITC-metabolizing/functioning genes, it is calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for recurrence and progression. The rs15561 in N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) is alter the association between CV intake and progression risk. Multiple SNPs in nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) are modify the associations between plasma ITC-albumin adduct level and progression risk (pint < 0.05). No significant association is observed with recurrence risk. Overall, >80% study participants are present with at least one protective genotype per gene, showing an average 65% reduction in progression risk with high dietary ITC exposure. Despite that genetic variations in ITC-metabolizing/functioning genes may modify the effect of dietary ITCs on NMIBC prognosis, dietary recommendation of CV consumption may help improve NMIBC survivorship.\n\nAuthors: Wang, Zinian;Ergas, Isaac J;Quesenberry, Charles P;Kushi, Lawrence H;Tang, Li;et al.\n\nMol Nutr Food Res. 2024 Apr;68(8):e2400087.

Yet, these data are not routinely available in electronic health records (EHRs) at the specificity required to address these questions. We developed a methodology to identify patients’ intended regimens from EHR data in the Optimal Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Dosing (OBCD) study. In women older than 18 years, diagnosed with primary stage I-IIIA breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (2006-2019), we categorized participants into 24 drug combinations described in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for breast cancer treatment. Participants were categorized into 50 guideline chemotherapy administration schedules within these combinations using an iterative algorithm process, followed by chart abstraction where necessary. We also identified patients intended to receive nonguideline administration schedules within guideline drug combinations and nonguideline drug combinations. This process was adapted at Kaiser Permanente Washington using abstracted data (2004-2015). In the OBCD cohort, 13,231 women received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, of whom 10,213 (77%) had their intended regimen identified via the algorithm, 2,416 (18%) had their intended regimen identified via abstraction, and 602 (4.5%) could not be identified. Across guideline drug combinations, 111 nonguideline dosing schedules were used, alongside 61 nonguideline drug combinations. A number of factors were associated with requiring abstraction for regimen determination, including: decreasing neighborhood household income, earlier diagnosis year, later stage, nodal status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ status. We describe the challenges and approaches to operationalize complex, real-world data to identify intended chemotherapy regimens in large, observational studies. This methodology can improve efficiency of use of large-scale clinical data in real-world populations, helping answer critical questions to improve care delivery and patient outcomes.\n\nAuthors: Bhimani, Jenna;Ergas, Isaac J;Kolevska, Tatjana;Kroenke, Candyce H;Liu, Raymond;Kushi, Lawrence H;Kantor, Elizabeth D;et al.\n\nJCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2024 Apr;8:e2300209.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nScreening for Colorectal Cancer in Asymptomatic Average-Risk Adults\n\nAuthors: Shaukat, Aasma;Levin, Theodore R;Church, Timothy R\n\nAnn Intern Med. 2024 Apr;177(4):542-543.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nColorectal Cancer Screening After Sequential Outreach Components in a Demographically Diverse Cohort\n\nOrganized screening outreach can reduce differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality between demographic subgroups. Outcomes associated with additional outreach, beyond universal outreach, are not well known. To compare CRC screening completion by race and ethnicity, age, and sex after universal automated outreach and additional personalized outreach. This observational cohort study included screening-eligible individuals aged 50 to 75 years assessed during 2019 in a community-based organized CRC screening program within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) integrated health care delivery setting. For KPNC members who are not up to date with screening by colonoscopy, each year the program first uses automated outreach (mailed prescreening notification postcards and fecal immunochemical test [FIT] kits, automated telephone calls, and postcard reminders), followed by personalized components for nonresponders (telephone calls, electronic messaging, and screening offers during office visits). Data analyses were performed between November 2021 and February 2023 and completed on February 5, 2023. Completed CRC screening via colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or FIT. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants completing an FIT or colonoscopy after each component of the screening process. Differences across subgroups were assessed using the χ2 test. This study included 1 046 745 KPNC members. Their mean (SD) age was 61.1 (6.9) years, and more than half (53.2%) were women. A total of 0.4% of members were American Indian or Alaska Native, 18.5% were Asian, 7.2% were Black, 16.2% were Hispanic, 0.8% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 56.5% were White. Automated outreach significantly increased screening participation by 31.1%, 38.1%, 29.5%, 31.9%, 31.8%, and 34.5% among these groups, respectively; follow-up personalized outreach further significantly increased participation by absolute additional increases of 12.5%, 12.4%, 13.3%, 14.4%, 14.7%, and 11.2%, respectively (all differences P < .05 compared with White members). Overall screening coverage at the end of the yearly program differed significantly among members who were American Indian or Alaska Native (74.1%), Asian (83.5%), Black (77.7%), Hispanic (76.4%), or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (74.4%) compared with White members (82.2%) (all differences P < .05 compared with White members). Screening completion was similar by sex; older members were substantially more likely to be up to date with CRC screening both before and at the end of the screening process. In this cohort study of a CRC screening program, sequential automated and personalized strategies each contributed to substantial increases in screening completion in all demographic groups. These findings suggest that such programs may potentially reduce differences in CRC screening completion across demographic groups.\n\nAuthors: Podmore, Clara;Selby, Kevin;Jensen, Christopher D;Zhao, Wei K;Weiss, Noel S;Levin, Theodore R;Schottinger, Joanne;Doubeni, Chyke A;Corley, Douglas A\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2024 Apr 01;7(4):e245295.

To estimate surveillance colonoscopy yields in older adults. This population-based cross-sectional study included individuals 70 to 85 years of age who received surveillance colonoscopy at a large, community-based US health care system between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019; had an adenoma detected 12 or more months previously; and had at least 1 year of health plan enrollment before surveillance. Individuals were excluded due to prior colorectal cancer (CRC), hereditary CRC syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or prior colectomy or if the surveillance colonoscopy had an inadequate bowel preparation or was incomplete. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2022, to February 22, 2024. Age (70-74, 75-79, or 80-85 years) at surveillance colonoscopy and prior adenoma finding (ie, advanced adenoma vs nonadvanced adenoma). The main outcomes were yields of CRC, advanced adenoma, and advanced neoplasia overall (all ages) by age group and by both age group and prior adenoma finding. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with advanced neoplasia detection at surveillance. Of 9740 surveillance colonoscopies among 9601 patients, 5895 (60.5%) were in men, and 5738 (58.9%), 3225 (33.1%), and 777 (8.0%) were performed in those aged 70-74, 75-79, and 80-85 years, respectively. Overall, CRC yields were found in 28 procedures (0.3%), advanced adenoma in 1141 (11.7%), and advanced neoplasia in 1169 (12.0%); yields did not differ significantly across age groups. Overall, CRC yields were higher for colonoscopies among patients with a prior advanced adenoma vs nonadvanced adenoma (12 of 2305 [0.5%] vs 16 of 7435 [0.2%]; P = .02), and the same was observed for advanced neoplasia (380 of 2305 [16.5%] vs 789 of 7435 [10.6%]; P < .001). Factors associated with advanced neoplasia at surveillance were prior advanced adenoma (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.65; 95% CI, 1.44-1.88), body mass index of 30 or greater vs less than 25 (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.44), and having ever smoked tobacco (AOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30). Asian or Pacific Islander race was inversely associated with advanced neoplasia (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99). In this cross-sectional study of surveillance colonoscopy yield in older adults, CRC detection was rare regardless of prior adenoma finding, whereas the advanced neoplasia yield was 12.0% overall. Yields were higher among those with a prior advanced adenoma than among those with prior nonadvanced adenoma and did not increase significantly with age. These findings can help inform whether to continue surveillance colonoscopy in older adults.\n\nAuthors: Lee, Jeffrey K;Levin, Theodore R;Corley, Douglas A;Corley, Douglas A;et al.\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2024 Apr 01;7(4):e244611.

This cohort study included 533 patients with stage II-III colon cancer who initiated a planned regimen of 12 cycles of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy. The primary exposure was chemotherapy RDI. The primary outcome was overall survival. Restricted cubic splines estimated hazard ratios (HR). Chemotherapy regimen RDI was associated with overall survival in an L-shaped pattern (linear P = 0.006; nonlinear P = 0.057); the risk of death was flat above 85% but increased linearly below 85%. For example, a decrease in RDI from 85 to 75% was associated with an increased risk of death [HR: 1.20 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.52)], whereas an increase in RDI from 85 to 95% was not associated with the risk of death [HR: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.38)]. If chemotherapy RDI is considered a potential surrogate of overall survival, supportive care interventions that improve chemotherapy RDI might confer a potential clinical benefit in this population.\n\nAuthors: Brown, Justin C;Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A;Yang, Shengping;Caan, Bette J\n\nCancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2024 Mar 23.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nEvaluation of Pre-Analytical Variables for Human Papillomavirus Primary Screening from Self-Collected Vaginal Swabs\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) primary screening is an effective approach to assessing cervical cancer risk. Self-collected vaginal swabs have shown promise to expand testing access, but there are limited data defining analytical performance criteria necessary for adoption of self-collected specimens, especially for those occurring outside the clinic, where the swab remains dry during transport. Here, we evaluated the performance of self-collected vaginal swabs for HPV detection using the Cobas 6800. There was insignificant variability between swabs self-collected by the same individual (n = 15 participants collecting 5 swabs per participant), measured by amplification of HPV and human β-globin control DNA. Comparison of self-collected vaginal swab and provider-collected cervical samples (n = 144 paired collections) proved highly concordant for HPV detection (total agreement = 90.3%; positive percentage agreement = 84.2%). There was no relationship between the number of dry storage days and amplification of HPV (n = 68; range, 4 to 41 days). Exposure of self-collected dry swabs to extreme summer and winter temperatures did not affect testing outcomes. We assessed a second internal control (RNase P) in a subset and demonstrate that lack of amplification for β-globin from self-collected specimens was consistent with poor, but not absent, cellularity. These data suggest that self-collected vaginal samples enable accurate clinical HPV testing, and that extended ambient dry storage or exposure to extreme temperatures does not influence HPV detection. Furthermore, lack of β-globin amplification in HPV-negative samples accurately identified participants who required recollection.\n\nAuthors: Qi, Michelle;Naranjo, Anissa R;Duque, Abigail J;Lorey, Thomas S;Schapiro, Jeffrey M;Suh-Burgmann, Betty J;Rummel, Michael;Salipante, Stephen J;Wentzensen, Nicolas;Greene, Dina N\n\nJ Mol Diagn. 2024 Mar 15.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nHospital Readmissions Among Patients Experiencing Homelessness: An Electronic Health Record Data Study\n\nPopulation-level tracking of hospital use patterns with integrated care organizations in patients experiencing homelessness has been difficult. A California law implemented in 2019 (Senate Bill 1152) aimed to ensure safety for this population after discharge from the hospital by requiring additional documentation for patients experiencing homelessness, which provides an opportunity to evaluate hospital use by this population. In a large integrated health system in California, patients experiencing homelessness were identified through documentation change requirements associated with this law and compared with a matched group from the general population. Patients experiencing homelessness had increased rates of hospital readmission after discharge compared to the general population matched on demographics and medical comorbidity in 2019 and 2020. Any address change in the prior year for patients was associated with increased odds of emergency department readmission. Patients experiencing homelessness, both enrolled in an integrated delivery system and not, were successfully identified as having higher readmission rates compared with their housed counterparts. Documentation of housing status following Senate Bill 1152 has enabled improved study of hospital use among those with housing instability. Understanding patterns of hospital use in this vulnerable group will help practitioners identify timely points of intervention for further social and health care support.\n\nAuthors: Banerjee, Somalee;Yassin, Maher;Dyer, Wendy T;Thomas, Tainayah W;Rodriguez, Luis A;Schmittdiel, Julie\n\nPerm J. 2024 Mar 15;28(1):55-61.

The aim of this study is to determine whether declines in physical function after cancer diagnosis are associated with all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. This prospective cohort study included 8,068 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) who were diagnosed with cancer and had physical function assessed within 1-year of cancer diagnosis. Self-reported physical function was measured using the 10-item physical function subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Cause of death was determined by medical record review with central adjudication and linkage to the National Death Index. Death was adjudicated through February 2022. Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years from cancer diagnosis 3,316 (41.1%) women died. Our results showed that for every 10% decline in the physical function score after cancer diagnosis, all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality were significantly reduced by 12% (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89) and (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.86 to 0.91), respectively. Further categorical analyses showed a significant dose-response relationship between post-diagnosis physical function categories and mortality outcomes (trend test P < .001), where the median survival time for women in the lowest physical function quartile was 9.1 (8.6, 10.6) years compared to 18.4 (15.8, 22.0) years for women in the highest physical function quartile. Postmenopausal women with low physical function after cancer diagnosis may be at higher risk of mortality from all causes and cancer-related mortality.\n\nAuthors: Gonzalo-Encabo, Paola;Kroenke, Candyce H;Dieli-Conwright, Christina M;et al.\n\nJ Natl Cancer Inst. 2024 Mar 06.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nClinical, Epidemiologic, and Pathologic Significance of ERBB2-Low Expression in Breast Cancer\n\nIt is unclear whether breast cancer (BC) with low ERBB2 expression (ERBB2-low) is a distinct clinical, pathological, and epidemiological entity from BC classified as no ERBB2 expression (ERBB2-negative). To evaluate the clinical, pathological, and epidemiologic features of BC with ERBB2-low expression compared with ERBB2-negative BC in a large population study. This cohort study was conducted as part of the Pathways Study, a prospective, racially and ethnically diverse cohort study of women with BC enrolled between 2006 and 2013 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). The hematoxylin and eosin slides underwent centralized pathology review, including the percentage of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Breast biomarker results were extracted from pathology reports, and women were included if they had a documented ERBB2 value that was not classified ERBB2-positive. Data were analyzed from February 2023 through January 2024. Clinical and tumor characteristics associated with BC and ERBB2-low or ERBB2-negative status. ERBB2-low was defined as immunohistochemistry score of 1+ or 2+ (negative by in situ hybridization); ERBB2-negative was defined as immunohistochemistry score of 0+. Other data were collected by self-report or extraction from electronic health records, including BC risk factors, tumor characteristics, treatment modality, and survival outcomes, with recurrence-free survival (RFS) as the primary outcome and overall survival (OS) and BC-specific mortality (BCSM) as secondary outcomes. The clinical, pathological, and epidemiological variables were compared between ERBB2-low and ERBB2-negative BC. Of 2200 eligible patients (all female; with mean [SD] age, 60.4 [11.9] years), 1295 (57.2%) had tumors that were ERBB2-low. Hormone receptors were positive in 1956 patients (88.9%). The sample included 291 Asian patients (13.2%), 166 Black patients (7.5%), 253 Hispanic patients (11.5%), 1439 White patients (65.4%), and 51 patients (2.3%) who identified as other race or ethnicity (eg, American Indian or Alaska Native and Pacific Islander). Within the hormone receptor-negative group, patients whose tumors had ERBB2-low staining, compared with those with ERBB2-negative tumors, had better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.91; P = .02), RFS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.95; P = .03), and BCSM (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22-0.84; P = .01). In multivariable survival analysis stratified by hormone receptor status and adjusted for key covariates, patients with ERBB2-low and hormone receptor-negative tumors had lower overall mortality (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.83; P = .009), RFS (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24-0.86; P = .02), and BCSM (subdistribution HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.10-0.46; P < .001) compared with patients with ERBB2-negative and hormone receptor-negative tumors. Within the hormone receptor-negative subtype, patients with ERBB2-low and high TILs tumors had better survival across all 3 outcomes compared with patients with ERBB2-negative and low TILs tumors. Additionally, patients with ERBB2-low and low TILs tumors had better BCSM (subdistribution HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14-0.92; P = .03). These findings suggest that there were clinical, pathological, and epidemiological differences between ERBB2-low and ERBB2-negative BC, raising the possibility that ERBB2-low might be a unique biologic entity.\n\nAuthors: Khoury, Thaer;Kwan, Marilyn L;Ergas, Isaac J;Kushi, Lawrence H;Kushi, Lawrence H;et al.\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2024 Mar 04;7(3):e243345.

However, information on VTE beyond the first two years after diagnosis (‘late VTE’) is scarce, particularly in young survivors. We examined the risk of, and factors associated with, late VTE among adolescents and young adults (AYA, 15-39 years) diagnosed with cancer (2006-2018) who survived ≥2 years. Data were obtained from the California Cancer Registry linked to hospitalization, emergency department and ambulatory surgery data. We used non-parametric models and Cox proportional hazard regression for analyses. Among 59,343 survivors, the 10-year cumulative incidence of VTE was 1.93 % (CI 1.80-2.07). The hazard of VTE was higher among those who had active cancer, including progression from lower stages to metastatic disease (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 10.41, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 8.86-12.22), second primary cancer (HR = 2.58, CI:2.01-3.31), or metastatic disease at diagnosis (HR = 2.38, CI:1.84-3.09). The hazard of late VTE was increased among survivors who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation, those who received radiotherapy, had a VTE history, public insurance (vs private) or non-Hispanic Black/African American race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White). Patients with leukemias, lymphomas, sarcoma, melanoma, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers had a higher VTE risk than those with thyroid cancer. VTE risk remained elevated ≥2 years following cancer diagnosis in AYA survivors. Active cancer is a significant risk factor for VTE. Future studies might determine if late VTE should prompt evaluation for recurrence or second malignancy, if not already known.\n\nAuthors: Abrahão, Renata;Kushi, Lawrence H;Keegan, Theresa H M;et al.\n\nThromb Res. 2024 Mar;235:1-7.

In this validation study, we evaluated pairs of breast cancer recurrence algorithms (vs. individual algorithms) to identify recurrences. We generated algorithm combinations that categorized discordant algorithm results as no recurrence [High Specificity and PPV (positive predictive value) Combination] or recurrence (High Sensitivity Combination). We compared individual and combined algorithm results to manually abstracted recurrence outcomes from a sample of 600 people with incident stage I-IIIA breast cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2015. We used Cox regression to evaluate risk factors associated with age- and stage-adjusted recurrence rates using different recurrence definitions, weighted by inverse sampling probabilities. Among 600 people, we identified 117 recurrences using the High Specificity and PPV Combination, 505 using the High Sensitivity Combination, and 118 using manual abstraction. The High Specificity and PPV Combination had good specificity [98%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 97-99] and PPV (72%, 95% CI: 63-80) but modest sensitivity (64%, 95% CI: 44-80). The High Sensitivity Combination had good sensitivity (80%, 95% CI: 49-94) and specificity (83%, 95% CI: 80-86) but low PPV (29%, 95% CI: 25-34). Recurrence rates using combined algorithms were similar in magnitude for most risk factors. By combining algorithms, we identified breast cancer recurrences with greater PPV than individual algorithms, without additional review of discordant records. Researchers should consider tradeoffs between accuracy and manual chart abstraction resources when using previously developed algorithms. We provided guidance for future studies that use breast cancer recurrence algorithms with or without supplemental manual chart abstraction.\n\nAuthors: Aiello Bowles, Erin J;Kushi, Lawrence H;Kantor, Elizabeth D;et al.\n\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2024 Mar 01;33(3):355-364.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nThe economics of nature’s healing touch: A systematic review and conceptual framework of green space, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and healthcare expenditure associations\n\nGreen spaces play a crucial role in promoting sustainable and healthy lives. Recent evidence shows that green space also may reduce the need for healthcare, prescription medications, and associated costs. This systematic review provides the first comprehensive assessment of the available literature examining green space exposure and its associations with healthcare prescriptions and expenditures. We applied Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to search MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science for observational studies published in English through May 6, 2023. A quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment was used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence. Our search retrieved 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Among these, 20 studies (77 % of the total) showed beneficial associations of green space exposure with healthcare prescriptions or expenditures. However, most studies had risks of bias, and the overall strength of evidence for both outcomes was limited. Based on our findings and related bodies of literature, we present a conceptual framework to explain the possible associations and complex mechanisms underlying green space and healthcare outcomes. The framework differs from existing green space and health models by including upstream factors related to healthcare access (i.e., rurality and socioeconomic status), which may flip the direction of associations. Additional research with lower risks of bias is necessary to validate this framework and better understand the potential for green space to reduce healthcare prescriptions and expenditures.\n\nAuthors: Patwary, Muhammad Mainuddin;Van Den Eeden, Stephen K;Van Den Eeden, Stephen K;et al.\n\nSci Total Environ. 2024 Mar 01;914:169635.

Whether higher diet quality at breast cancer diagnosis lowers this risk remains unknown. We set out to determine if higher diet quality at breast cancer diagnosis was related to lower risk of CVD and CVD-related death. This analysis included 3415 participants from the Pathway Study, a prospective cohort of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2005 and 2013 and followed through December 31, 2021. Scores from 5 diet quality indices consistent with healthy eating were obtained at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. Scores were categorized into ascending quartiles of concordance for each diet quality index, and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. P values were 2-sided. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet quality index was associated with lower risk of heart failure (HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.87; Ptrend = .03), arrhythmia (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.94; Ptrend = .008), cardiac arrest (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.96; Ptrend = .02), valvular heart disease (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.98; Ptrend = .046), venous thromboembolic disease (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.93; Ptrend = .01), and CVD-related death (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.99; Ptrend = .04), when comparing the highest with lowest quartiles. Inverse associations were also found between the healthy plant-based dietary index and heart failure (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.94; Ptrend = .02), as well as the alternate Mediterranean dietary index and arrhythmia (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.93; Ptrend = .02). Among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, higher diet quality at diagnosis was associated with lower risk of CVD events and death.\n\nAuthors: Ergas, Isaac J;Kushi, Lawrence H;Iribarren, Carlos;Nguyen-Huynh, Mai;Rana, Jamal S;Quesenberry, Charles P;Kwan, Marilyn L;Kwan, Marilyn L;et al.\n\nJNCI Cancer Spectr. 2024 Feb 29;8(2).\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nUse of Cancer-Directed therapy at the end of life among adolescents and young adults\n\nAdolescents and young adults (AYAs) frequently receive chemotherapy near death. We know less about use of targeted agents and immunotherapy or trends over time. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,836 AYAs with cancer who died between 2009-2019 after receiving care at one of three sites (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, and Kaiser Permanente Southern California). We reviewed electronic health data and medical records to examine use of cancer-directed therapy in the last 90 days of life, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and investigational drugs. Over the study period, 35% of AYAs received chemotherapy in the last 90 days of life; 24% received targeted therapy, 7% immunotherapy, and 5% investigational drugs. Fifty-six percent received at least one form of systemic cancer-directed therapy in the last 90 days of life. After adjustment for patient sex, race, ethnicity, age, site of care, diagnosis, and years from diagnosis to death, the proportion of AYAs receiving targeted therapy (odds ratio (OR) 1.05 per year of death, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.10, P = .006), immunotherapy (OR 1.27, 95%CI 1.18-1.38, P<.0001), and any cancer-directed therapy (OR1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.08, P=.01) in the last 90 days of life increased over time. More than half of AYAs receive cancer therapy in the last 90 days of life, and use of novel agents such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy are increasing over time. While some AYAs may wish to continue cancer therapy while living with advanced disease, efforts are needed to ensure that use of cancer-directed therapy meets preferences of AYAs approaching death.\n\nAuthors: Mack, Jennifer W;Kushi, Lawrence H;Uno, Hajime;et al.\n\nJ Natl Cancer Inst. 2024 Feb 20.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nQuality of End-of-Life Care Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer\n\nAdolescents, "
