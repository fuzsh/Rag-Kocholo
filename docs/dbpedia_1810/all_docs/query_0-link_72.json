(2015: Table S2); other ages are around 142 Ma, the highest, in Paterson et al. (2004), ca 124 Ma (Givnish et al. 2018b), ca 121 Ma (Tang et al. 2016), 123 to 111 Ma (Magallón & Castillo 2009), (124-)117(-108) (Givnish et al. 2016b), (126-)117(-106.5) Ma (Eguchi & Tamura 2016), (120-)109(-89) Ma (Merckx et al. 2008a), ca 108 Ma (Bremer 2000b), ca 107 Ma (Foster et al. 2016a: q.v. for details), about 98.6 Ma (Givnish et al. 2000), (91-)87, 83(-79) Ma (Wikström et al. 2001). See also 105-84 Ma in Mennes et al. (2013), 111-88 Ma in Mennes et al. (2015), and (126-)117, 109(-103) Ma in Hertweck et al. (2015).\n\nEvolution: Plant-Animal Interactions. Sap-eating chinch bugs of the Hemiptera-Lygaeidae-Blissinae have been recorded from taxa throughout this clade, although they occur on Poales and especially Poaceae most frequently (Slater 1976).\n\nGenes & Genomes. The rate of molecular evolution in the plastome is high (with some notable exceptions) in this whole clade (Barrett et al. 2015).\n\nPhylogeny. For a discussion about the relationships of Poales, see the Arecales page.\n\nPrevious Relationships. Engler (1892) recognised a group, Farinosae, distinguished by its mealy (versus fleshy or oily) endosperm, which included many of the taxa in Poales and Commelinales. Engler thought that Farinosae were close to his Liliflorae, perhaps partly because he included Juncaceae (Poales here) in the latter. Hamann (esp. 1961, 1962c) provided a comprehensive evaluation of the variation pattern of the taxa included in the Farinosae.\n\nPOALES Small - Main Tree.\n\nMycorrhizae absent; vessel elements in roots often with simple perforation plates, vessels also in stem and leaf, also with simple perforation plates; SiO2 epidermal; cuticular waxes not as laterally aggregated rodlets; raphides 0; inflorescence indeterminate; style well developed, stigmas small, dry; micropyle bistomal, both integuments ca 2 cells across; tegmen with thick cuticle, tanniniferous [esp. endotegmen]; embryo size?; whole nuclear genome duplication [σ/sigma event], 2 C genome (0.6-)1.02(-1.73) pg; mitochondrial sdh3 [succinate dehydrogenase 3] gene lost; primary root degenerates early, cotyledon phanomer, haustorial [?level]. - 14 families, 997 genera, 18,875 species.\n\nIncludes Bromeliaceae, Cyperaceae, Ecdeiocoleaceae, Eriocaulaceae, Flagellariaceae, Joinvilleaceae, Juncaceae, Mayacaceae, Poaceae, Rapateaceae, Restionaceae, Thurniaceae, Typhaceae, Xyridaceae.\n\nNote: In all node characterizations, boldface denotes a possible apomorphy, (....) denotes a feature the exact status of which in the clade is uncertain, [....] includes explanatory material; other text lists features found pretty much throughout the clade. Note that the precise node to which many characters, particularly the more cryptic ones, should be assigned is unclear. This is partly because homoplasy is very common, in addition, basic information for all too many characters is very incomplete, frequently coming from taxa well embedded in the clade of interest and so making the position of any putative apomorphy uncertain. Then there are the not-so-trivial issues of how character states are delimited and ancestral states are reconstructed (see above).\n\nAge. Ages for crown-group Poales are notably variable. Leebens-Mack et al. (2005) suggested an age of 109-106 Ma, Magallón and Castillo (2009) ages of ca 109 and 99.2 Ma, Bell et al. (2010) ages of (103-)93, 85(-73) Ma, Wikström et al. (2001) an age of 72-69 My; estimates are ca 120 Ma in Givnish et al. 2018b), (124-)117(-108) Ma in Givnish et al. (2016b), (116-)106(-88) Ma in Merckx et al. (2008a), (115.3-)104.8(-93.6) Ma in Eguchi and Tamura (2016), ca 101 Ma in Magallón et al. (2015), ca 83 Ma in Janssen and Bremer (2004: c.f. topology), only ca 52.3 or 51.6 Ma in Xue et al. (2012) but 98-78 Ma and 104-82 Ma in Mennes et al. (2013, 2015 respectively), while ages in Hertweck et al. (2015) are (122-)113(-109) or (105-)99(-94) Ma, in D.-F. Xie et al. (2020) they are (69.3-)54.2(-34.6) Ma, in Can et al. (2020: Brom Cyp) they are ca 114.3 Ma, while 121-107 Ma is a similar estimate (Jiao & Wang 2022).\n\nHowever, there are problems. Poinar (2004, 2011) proposed that Programinis laminatus, found fossil in deposits from the Early Cretaceous of Myanmar some 110-100 Ma, can be placed in Poaceae-Poöideae, i.e. a clade rather highly embedded in Poaceae. More recently Poinar et al. (2015) described a spikelet assigned to Poaceae (parts spirally arranged) that was infected with a Claviceps-like fungus, and they noted âWith the discovery of a Claviceps-like fossil infecting a floret of an Earlyâmid Cretaceous Asian grass, we propose that the progenitor of Claviceps evolved in Asia among early grasses sometime in the mid- to Late Jurassic.â (ibid., p. 17). Similarly, if the identity of the putative stem Bromeliaceae Protoananas lucenae, 114-112 Ma old and from Brazil (Leme & Brown 2011), is confirmed (Kessous et al. 2021 were not sure), older dates for the clade are again suggested.\n\nEvolution: Divergence & Distribution. Magallón and Castillo (2009) suggested that Poales, which include about 1/3 of all monocots, have the highest diversification rates in the monocots and about the same as in Asparagales, but in both the rate is only little over half that of Lamiales.\n\nLinder and Rudall (2005) provide a detailed discussion of morphological evolution and diversification in Poales. Subsequently, Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. (2014: tree rather distinctive) looked at correlations of various ecological parameters and diversification; they thought that much diversification in major lineages was Late Cretaceous, even if the origins of those clades was substantially earlier, while Bromeliaceae were a particularly good example of a much more recent radiation with an extremely long phylogenetic fuse, i.e. with a very old stem group. In Linder et al. (2017b: Fig. 5) largely ecophysiological features are displayed on a tree of the order. Males (2016) suggested that a propensity (sic) for aerenchyma formation was plesiomorphic in Poales.\n\nEcology & Physiology. Cornwell et al. (2008) found that litter decomposition of forbs was faster than that of graminoids - presumably mostly grasses and sedges, indeed, litter decomposition of monocots (sic) was slower that that of other angiosperms; in fact, the main difference is core eudicots (higher on average) versus other angiosperms + gymnosperms (LeRoy et al. 2019). Bamboo wood is particularly slow to decompose (G. Liu et al. 2015). Such differences affect the rate of nutrient cycling in the environment.\n\nRecently it has been emphasized that within commelinid monocots, and especially Poales, some sieve tubes lack companion cells, are notably thick-walled, and are close to the tracheary elements; they seem to be involved in short distance transport of not very concentrated sugars. Interestingly, aphids do not probe such cells, rather, they prefer the thinner walled \"normal\" sieve tubes which have more concentrated sugars (Botha 2013). The distribution of these distinctive sieve tubes is unclear.\n\nPollination Biology & Seed Dispersal. For the repeated evolution of wind pollination in Poales, see Givnish et al. (2010a, b).\n\nPlant-Animal Interactions. Host-plants of the ca 165 species of reed beetles, Chrysomelidae-Donaciinae, noted for the larvae being able to live under water, are scattered in Poales in particular, especially in Typhaceae, Juncaceae and Cyperaceae (Kölsch & Pedersen 2008: much discussion on the age and evolution of the group). They are mono- or oligophagous and show close co-cladogenesis with endosymbiotic bacteria (γ proteobacteria-Enterobacteriaceae, near Burkholderia) which produce the material that makes up the cocoon that characterises this beetle clade. The bacteria live in blind sacs in the foregut of the larvae and in the Malpighian tubules of the female adult in particular; transmission is vertical and external (Kleinschmidt & Kölsch 2011).\n\nPlant-Bacterial/Fungal Associations. Mycorrhizae are absent in many members of this clade (Brundrett 2017b), although Poaceae commonly have arbuscular mycorrhizae.\n\nGenes & Genomes. The σ/sigma nuclear genome duplication event is placed at this node (Ming et al. 2015; McKain et al. 2016a), however, Zwaenepoel and Van de Peer (2020) place this event at the commelinid node... Ca 90.2 Ma is the age of the ORSAβ event (Landis et al. 2018: no Ty Spar). Ming et al. (2015), working on pineapple, think that the sequence of changes in chromosome numbers was x = 7 → x = 14 (tetraploidy: τ/tau genome duplication event]) → x = 12 → x = 24 (tetraploidy: σ/sigma genome duplication event) → x = 16 (\"extant chromosomes\"), although they also mention a sequence x = 7 Ã 2 Ã 2 = 28, i.e. no chromosomal rearrangements. On the other hand, the proposed sequence in Murat et al. (2017) is x = 5 → x = 10 (tetraploidy: τ/tau genome duplication event) → x = 9 → x = 27 (hexaploidy: σ/sigma genome duplication event). For these events, see also Qiao et al. (2019).\n\nPuttick et al. (2015) estimate the genome size of Poales - it is small.\n\nLam et al. (2016) found very long branches for Cyperus and Poaceae (somewhat shorter in Flagellaria, short/ordinary in Typhaceae and Bromeliaceae) that they examined in a three-gene analysis (plastome), and these branch lengths were similar to those of some holomycoheterotrophic taxa.\n\nFor the general pattern of movement of genes from the mitochondrion to the nucleus, see Adams and Palmer (2003). J. J. Doyle et al. (1991) discussed chloroplast inversions. Ong and Palmer (2006) examined the rps14 nuclear gene/mitochondrial pseudogene system.\n\nChemistry, Morphology, etc.. Eriocaulaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Juncaceae at least have lateral roots originating opposite the phloem of the vascular tissue, in Restionaceae and Bromeliaceae they originate opposite the xylem (ref.?). Note that at least some members of the Poaceae and Cyperaceae groups have distinctive cellulose orientation in the outer epidermal walls of their roots, but that some Typhaceae and Bromeliaceae do not (Kerstens & Verbelen 2002); one wonders what improved sampling will show.\n\nFor details of variation in gynoecium initiation/development, see Oriani and Scatena (2019); de Oliveira et al. (2020) summarize obturator variation in Poales. Von Guttenberg (1960) drew attention to embryological similarities between Typhaceae, Bromeliaceae, Cyperaceae and Juncaceae.\n\nSee Prychid et al. (2004) for SiO2 bodies (phytoliths), Tiemann (1985) for embryology, L. R. de O. Silva and Oriani (2022) for seed and seedling, de Carvalho et al. (2023: seed anatomy) and Tillich (2007) and Silva et al. (2023) for seedling morphology and evolution.\n\nPhylogeny. Poales do not always have very strong support, but c.f. e.g. Givnish et al. (2010b) and Barrett et al. (2012b). The topology of the tree in early versions of this site was based on the work of K. Bremer (2002) in particular, and also that of Harborne et al. (2000), but Janssen and Bremer (2004) suggested a rather different set of relationships, albeit some had little support, and relationships in Givnish et al. (2010b) were somewhat different again. It will become clear from the discussion below that the topology of the tree above is probably incorrect in detail, but I await further studies with better sampling and support before changing it; the topologies of nuclear and plastid phylogenies tend to differ in detail (McKain et al. 2016a).\n\nThe general pattern of movement of genes from the mitochondrion to the nucleus suggests that Bromeliaceae and Typhaceae (of the taxa sampled) are sister to other Poales (Adams & Palmer 2003), and of course Bromeliaceae, along with the near-basal Rapateaceae, alone have septal nectaries in this clade. A three-nucleotide deletion in the atpA gene was found to characterise Typhaceae and Bromeliaceae (J. I. Davis et al. 2004), although there was little bootstrap support for this group (but see also Givnish et al. 2005, 2007; c.f. Givnish et al. 2006b). Typhaceae were placed sister to Bromeliaceae with weak jacknife support but strong Bayesian posterior probabilities (Bremer 2002; see also Eguchi & Tamura 2016). Other work also suggests that Typhaceae and Bromeliaceae form a clade sister to other Poales, and Rapateaceae are in turn consistently sister to the remainder (Givnish et al. 2005; Chase et al. 2006; also Rudall & Linder 2005; Givnish et al. 2008a: ?rooting; Graham et al. 2006: see Rapateaceae; Soltis et al. 2011: strong support, but sampling; Ruhfel et al. 2014; Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2014b), although these relationships are not always obtained (Givnish et al. 2010a). Support for this family pair was also quite strong in the Seed Plant Tree of Life i.2022 version and the position of Rapateaceae was strongly supported. However, Bromeliaceae and Typhaceae are also often placed as successive basal branches with respect to other Poales (Givnish et al. 2005, 2008a, 2010b: quite strong support, 2016b; also Graham et al. 2006; H. Wu et al. 2022: some analyses), while Typhaceae are sister to all other Poales in the phylogenomic analyses of McKain et al. (2016a) and Timilsena et al. (2022a: only moderate support). Other than these two families, Rapateaceae appear to be sister to remaining Poales in many analyses (e.g. J. I. Davis et al. 2004; Timilsena et al. 2022), albeit sometimes with little support (see also Barrett & Davis 2011; Barrett et al. 2013; J. I. Davis et al. 2013).\n\nAway from the base of the tree, in the complete plastome analysis of Ruhfel et al. (2014), for example, a clade [[Eriocaulaceae + Mayacaceae] [Xyridaceae + Poaceae, Restionaceae, etc.]] was obtained - only a single species of each of the first three families was included - while Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. (2014b) recovered the clades [[Rapateaceae + Mayacaeae] [Thurniaceae [Juncaceae + Cyperaceae]]] and [[Eriocaulaceae + Xyridaceae] [Restionaceae et al. + Poaceae et al.]]. There is support for these groups forming a larger clade (e.g. Givnish et al. 2005, 2010b; Chase et al. 2006), perhaps compatible with the distribution of deletions in the chloroplast inverted repeat ORF 2280 region and absence of a full accD gene (Hahn et al. 1995; Katayama & Ogihara 1996).\n\nThinking of Xyridales of Kubitzki (1998c), which included Mayacaceae, Xyridaceae, Eriocaulaceae and Rapateaceae, there was some evidence for a group made up of the first three families alone, and perhaps, but not very probably, also including Rapateaceae (see above). Bremer (2002) noted that Mayacaceae (and Hydatellaceae - see below) might be weakly associated with Xyridaceae or Eriocaulaceae, depending on what taxa were included in the analysis, but there were a number of long branches in this area and he excluded the first two families from his final analysis (Chase et al. 2006 also found the position of Hydatellaceae to be problematic; for the association of Mayacaceae with Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae, see also Campbell et al. 2001). J. I. Davis et al. (2004) found a more complex set of relationships, although with very little support. Members of this group of families were in adjacent branches along the spine of the tree, with one including Flagellariaceae, the Juncaceae group, some Xyridaceae, Mayacaceae, and perhaps Hydatellaceae. Both Xyridaceae and Mayacaceae have more or less clawed petals and anthers with an exothecium. Finally, as mentioned some Mayacaceae have been linked with Rapateaceae (e.g. Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2014b), and both have poricidal anthers. The three members of the old Xyridales that remain here may form a grade as follows: [Mayacaceae [[Xyridaceae + Eriocaulaceae] [Thurniaceae [Juncaceae etc.]]]] (Givnish et al. 2006b; Chase et al. 2006); the topology of the tree in Graham et al. (2006) although with poor sampling, is consistent with such relationships. Although there are several distinctive characters in this group of families, relationships remain unclear. Givnish et al. (2010b) found that in maximum likelihood analyses the general relationships were [[Juncaceae, etc.] [[Xyridaceae etc.] [Abolboda [Poaceae, etc.]]]] and later (Givnish et al. 2018b) a variant of this [[Juncaceae, etc.] [Mayacaceae [[Xyridaceae + Eriocaulaceae] [[Poaceae, etc.]]]]. Quite similar relationships were found by Barrett and Davis (2011), while J. I. Davis et al. (2013) recovered the grouping [Eriocaulaceae/Mayacaceae [Xyridaceae + Restionaceae/Poaceae area]], but there Abolboda stayed with other Xyridaceae. Givnish et al. (2010b) found that Abolboda, the only member of Xyridaceae examined, did not link with the Eriocaulaceae-Mayacaceae clade in maximum likelihood analyses, while in maximum parsimony analyses there was some support for a clade [Juncaceae etc. + Xyridaceae etc.] (the latter grouping was also recovered by Davis et al. 2013).\n\nPoaceae and their immediate relatives consistently form a clade, although some details of relationships within it are a little unclear (see below). Note that in versions 6 and earlier of this site, Eriocaulaceae and their relatives were tentatively associated with the Poaceae group, while analysis of the nuclear PhyB gene recovered a clade [Poaceae [Mayacaceae [Typhaceae + Eriocaulaceae]]] (Hochbach et al. 2018).\n\nPart of the problem in the early analyses of Poales may have been caused by the inclusion of Hydatellaceae. However, Saarela et al. (2006, esp. 2007) showed that Hydatellaceae are completely misplaced in monocot analyses, rather belonging to Nymphaeales where they are sister to other members of that clade, and this position has very strong molecular and morphological support.\n\nThere is indeed still some way to go. Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. (2014b: rbcL, ndhF) recovered the relationships, not all well supported, [[Typhaceae + Bromeliaceae] [[[Eriocaulaceae + Xyridaceae] [Restionaceae etc.]] [Mayacaceae [Rapateaceae [Thurniaceae etc.]]]]]. There was weak support for an [Eriocaulaceae + Xyridaceae] clade in the phylogenomic analysis of McKain et al. (2016a). A more recent comparison of relationships suggested by two nuclear genes and the plastid workhorse, matK, showed several differences, although many were weakly supported. For example, Mayacaceae, Xyridaceae, and Eriocaulaceae were not immediately related in trees that used the two nuclear markers while the position of the old Centrolepidaceae within Restionaceae varied according to the analysis (Hochbach et al. 2018). Darshetkar et al. (2019: plastomes) recovered the relationships [Typhaceae [Bromeliaceae [Rapateaceae [[Thurniaceae, etc.] [[Mayacaceae + Eriocaulaceae] [Xyridaceae [Restionaceae etc.]]]]]]], but H.-T. Li et al. (2021: * = nodes with weak support), in a very much more comprehensive study, found the relationships [Bromeliaceae *[Typhaceae [Rapateaceae [[Thurniaceae, etc.] *[Mayacaceae [*[Eriocaulaceae + Xyridaceae] [Restionaceae etc.]]]]]]]. H. Wu et al. (2022: 69-91 taxa, plastome and chondrome data) in their organelle analyses found about equal support for the three topologies at the base of the poalean tree involving Bromeliaceae and Typhaceae. As Wu et al. (2022) concluded in their analyses of conflict in the Poalean tree, \"Many factors, such as the missing data of mitochondrion, insufficient nuclear sampling, rapid radiation, heterogeneity of molecular evolution rate, and allopolyploidy by hybridization are potentially involved in generating these conflicts in the Poales.\" Hmmm. Many relationships around here are in a state of flux, nodes may have little support, and one can only wait for analyses of nuclear genomes - although of course the water may be muddied still further.\n\nThe first Angiosperms353 analysis associated with W. J. Baker et al. (2021a) unfortunately had poor sampling in critical areas - no Eriocaulaceae or Rapateaceae - but other relationships were [[Typhaceae + Bromeliaceae] *[Mayacaceae [[Restionaceae including Xyris] [Flagellariaceae, etc.]] [Thurniaceae, etc.]]]. However, i.2022 data release shows the relationships ...[[Thurniaceae, etc.] [Mayacaceae [[Eriocaulaceae + Xyridaceae] [Restionaceae etc.]]]] (see Seed Plant Tree), although the [Eriocaulaceae + Xyridaceae] clade had little support (most other relationships were fairly conventional, and Typhaceae were sister to Bromeliaceae with quite strong support - see also above). The similar topology [...[[Juncaceae, etc.] [Mayacaceae [Eriocaulaceae [Xyridaceae [Restionaceae etc.]]]]]] was often recovered by Wu et al. (2022), although they found the topology [...[[Eriocaulaceae + Mayacaceae] [[Juncaceae, etc.] [Xyridaceae [Restionaceae, etc.]]]]] in some of their analyses. As Wu et al. (2022) concluded: \"Many factors, such as the missing data of mitochondrion, insufficient nuclear sampling, rapid radiation, heterogeneity of molecular evolution rate, and allopolyploidy by hybridization are potentially involved in generating these conflicts in the Poales.\" Hmmm. In the recent nuclear phylogenomic analyses of Timilsena et al. (2022a: sampling pretty minimal) relationships, all strongly supported, are [[Thurniaceae etc.] [Mayacaceae [[Xyridaceae + Eriocaulaceae] [etc.]]] - it does seem that the old Xyridales are turning out to be paraphyletic.\n\nSynonymy: Eriocaulineae Thorne & Reveal, Xyridineae Thorne & Reveal - Avenales Bromhead, Bromeliales Link, Centrolepidales Takhtajan, Cyperales Berchtold & J.

[Photos - Collection.]\n\nAge. Crown-group Typha may be (10-)7.1(-4.1) Ma (Sulman et al. 2013: see sampling) or (57.6-)39(-22.6) Ma (B. Zhou et al. 2018).\n\nFossils of Typha are known from the Late Cretaceous onwards (B. Zhou et al. 2018 and references).\n\nSparganium is a rhizomatous aquatic with linear leaves and inflorescences with a few spherical heads of flowers, carpelate towards the base of the inflorescence and staminate towards the apex. Typha is a robust, rhizomatous herb that likes damp conditions and has erect, linear leaves and distinctive, elongated, densely cylindrical inflorescences, the part containing the carpelate flowers being borne below and usually separate from the part with the staminate flowers.\n\nEvolution: Divergence & Distribution. Sulman et al. (2013) discussed the biogeography and evolution of Sparganium, not easy to work out partly because of the very long evolutionary \"fuse\" of the genus, perhaps 80 Ma or more.\n\nPollination Biology & Seed Dispersal. Sparganium is ambophilous, being pollinated both by insects (beetles, hoverflies) and by wind (Gottsberger 2020).\n\nTypha has a sort of hyperextragynoecial compitum; the carpelate flowers are very close and are organized in groups of four, and in species where the pollen grains are in tetrads, pollen tubes from the four grains may reach the stigmas of four different flowers (Krattinger 1975; Nicholls & Cook 1986: Kubitzki 1998d: Fig. 113b, c; Carvalho & Mariath 2019).\n\nPlant-Bacterial/Fungal Associations. Similar rusts are shared by the two genera (Savile 1979).\n\nGenes & Genomes. The TYPHα genome duplication, which happened around 43 Ma, characterises the family (Landis et al. 2018).\n\nGuisinger et al. (2010) looked at the plastid genome of Typha latifolia, comparing it with that of some grasses.\n\nChemistry, Morphology, etc.. Corrêa et al. (2023) looked at foliar development in Typha domingensis, finding that most leaf tissues developed basipetally (the intercalary meristem producing these tissues was near the base), except for the xylem and phloem, as is common in monocots. Witzum and Wayne (2016) discuss the unlignified foliar fibre cables of Typha that run parallel to the leaf surfaces and at right angles to the diaphragms that divide the air spaces.\n\nSome flowers of Sparganium may have a second, empty loculus, or there may even be three fertile loculi (Dahlgren et al. 1985). Indeed, since fossil Sparganium may have up to 7-locular fruits (Cook & Nicholls 1986), it seems likely that the pseudomonomerous gynoecium in the two genera evolved independently and therefore should not be a family-level apomorphy.\n\nMuch information is taken from Kubitzki (1998d: general); see also D. Müller-Doblies (1970: inflorescence and flower), Dietz (1887: development of flower and fruit) and Grayum (1992) and Albert et al. (2011), both pollen - the two genera are palynologically almost identical. For general information on Typha, see Thieret and Luken (1996: southeast U.S.A.). As to Sparganium, see Cook and Nicholls (1986, 1987) for a monograph, Carlquist (2012a) for vessels, U.

However, other estimates are much younger, thus Givnish et al. (2004a, 2008) suggest a crown age of a mere 24.9-18.4 Ma, Givnish et al. (2011a) an age of ca 19.1 Ma, Givnish et al. (2014a) an age of ca 22.7 Ma, Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. (2014b) an age of (32.3-)19.5(-17.4) Ma, while ca 20.7 Ma is the estimate in B. Zhou et al. (2018).\n\nProtoananas lucenae, from the Crato limestone of Brazil and some 114-112 Ma old, is considered to be a \"putative ancestral stem-lineage of Bromeliaceae\" (Leme & Brown 2011: p. 217) and in the discussion it is also referred to as if it were in a separate family, Protoananaceae. Its age is greater than some estimates of the age of the whole order. It appears to have an inferior ovary, presumably of independent origin from that found in other Bromeliaceae (but see below — superior ovaries in some Bromeliaceae are thought by some to be secondarily so). However, Kessous et al. (2021) were unsure of the identity of the plant, and the oldest fossil that they thought could be reliably placed in Bromeliaceae was Karatophyllum bromelioides, initially believed to be from the upper Eocene but reassigned to the Pleistocene...\n\n1.

Mexico and the West Indies to Chile and Argentina, esp. Brazil, the Atlantic Forest. Map: see Zizka et al. (2020: Fig. 3b). Photo: Flower, Fruit, Flower, Flower.\n\nAge. Crown-group Bromelioideae are estimated to be 9.5-8.9 Ma (Givnish et al. 2011a), ca 9.4 Ma (Givnish et al. 2014a) or (14.6-)10.9(-7.6) Ma (Silvestro et al. 2013).\n\nBromeliaceae are often rosette plants, the leaves always being tough, spirally arranged, lacking a distinct sheath, and often with spiny-toothed margins; the indumentum is scaly (lepidote); and the terminal inflorescence is predominantly bracteate, the bracts sometimes being coloured. The flowers have a calyx and corolla, and the petals, although free, are erect, overlap and form a tube.\n\nEvolution: Divergence & Distribution. Givnish et al. (2011a, b) suggested that there was ca 80 million years between the origins of stem and crown Bromeliaceae (stem - sister to all other Poales - ca 100 Ma, crown ca 19 My), a very long evolutionary fuse, although there must of course have been at least some extinction during this period. Furthermore, where proto-Bromeliaceae were hanging out during this time is unclear, although Givnish et al. (2004a, 2008a) thought that Bromeliaceae had radiated from an ancestral home on the Guyana Shield (see also Givnish et al. 1997, 2011a: much detail, b). Given the size of the family and its recent diversification, establishing a phylogenetic framework to think about diversification has been tricky. Thus within clades like Bromelioideae there may have been a combination of incomplete lineage sorting and some hybridization - radiation has been rapid radiation, and there are about 1,000 species here, yet the clade is a mere ca 10 Ma (Givnish et al. 2011a, 2014a; Silvestro et al. 2013; Bratzel et al. 2022). Hybridization is also implicated in the rapid diversification of clades like Vriesea (Tillandsioideae) where diversification is mostly Pleistocene; here ca 11% of the species are hybrids, and there are also hybrids with Tillandsieae (Loiseau et al. 2020 for discussion and references).\n\nCentres of overall diversity in Bromeliaceae are the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, the Cemtral Andes and the northern Andes, while endemism is particularly high in the Atlantic Forest, the central and southern Andes, southern Mexico and parts of Venezuela (Zizka et al. 2020). Most diversification within Bromeliaceae is indeed very recent. Divergence within the Guianan Brocchinia may have begun a mere 14 Ma (Givnish et al. (2004a, 2008a) and much of the diversity (at least in terms of species numbers) in the family is in the Andean core tillandsioids, which began to radiate ca 14.2 Ma (see also Granados Mendoza et al. 2017), and the Brazilian Shield bromelioids, which started speciating only around 9.1 Ma (Givnish et al. 2011a). Indeed, 99% of the 1,300+ species of Tillandsioideae originated in the last ca 9.6 Ma, 95% of the >100 species of Navioideae in the last ca 6.7 Ma (Givnish et al. 2014a), and so on. Within Tillandsia in particular there are two major clades that diversified in North/Central America and Andes/Chile respectively, the latter with migration events to the Brazilian Shield (Granados Mendoza et al. 2017). Diversification of the Andean Puya seems to have begun in Peru (along with other early branches of Bromelioideae), and then following the Andean orogeny north (Schmidt Jabaily & Sytsma 2010, esp. 2013; Madriñán et al. 2013); it has occurred within the last ten Ma or so (Givnish et al. 2010). The speciose clade made up of Aechmea and relatives (Bromelioideae) seems to have diverged from Ananas about seven Ma and diversified within the last four Ma (Givnish et al. 2004a; Sass & Specht 2010). For diversification rates in the family, particularly high in tank epiphytes, see also Givnish et al. (2011b).\n\nThere is a fair bit of geographic structure in the tree of the Ronnbergia alliance (Bromelioideae: Aguirre-Santoro et al. 2016) and of Dyckia (Pitcairnioideae: Pinangé et al. 2017; see also morphology). For diversification in Tillandsia, see Granados Mendoza et al. (2017), there a North and Central American clade is sister to a cenral South American clade in which there had been several shifts from the Andes to the Brazilian shield. The ancestor of Pitcairnia feliciana probably moved to Africa by long distance dispersal perhaps 12-9.3 Ma (Givnish et al. 2008a, 2011; see also Porembski & Barthlott 1999), and it is basal in the genus (plastid markers)/basal in one of the two major clades in the genus (nuclear markers) (Schütz et al. 2016).\n\nGivnish et al. (2008a, 2013, 2014a) discuss the evolution of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM, see also Ecology and Physiology below), bird pollination, epiphytism, periodically water-limited sites and xeromorphic traits in the family, and how all these features interact (see also J. A. C. Smith et al. 2005; Nyffeler & Eggli 2010b; Quezada & Gianoli 2011; Palma-Silva et al. 2016; Holtum 2023); geography and other factors can be added to the mix and localised to the appropriate part of the tree (Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2015; Donoghue & Sanderson 2015). Quezada and Gianoli (2011) considered that the acquisition of CAM photosynthesis consisted of a series of key innovations; in five sister group comparisons the CAM clade was significantly more diverse than the non-CAM clade. About 13.6% of bromeliads are CAM plants, and its evolution may have initially occurred as the family moved to dry/arid terrestrial habitats, rather than as an adaptation facilitating epiphytism (Quezada & Gianoli 2011), while C. E. Martin (1994) had suggested that some 69% of bromeliads were CAM plants, either epiphytes or growing in arid habitats. Note, however, that Zotz et al. (2023) question the nature of any general connection between CAM and the epiphytic habit. In any event, Bromeliaceae are certainly a major CAM group and they are second most diverse family of Neotropical epiphytes (Bratzel et al. 2022). Silvestro et al. (2013) noticed an increase in speciation rates in CAM Bromelioideae in particular (CAM treated as a single character), although extinction rates also increased sharply (c.f. Orchidaceae). They suggested that there had been multiple origins of CAM there (Silvestro et al. 2013: Fig. 1, Table 3) given a highly asymmetric model of trait evolution, but this may need to be rethought as ideas of relationships in the family change. Thus Bratzel et al. (2022) found that the C4 Deinacanthon urbanianum was sister to [Fernseea [[Ananas group + Cryptanthoid complex] [core Bromelioideae]]], while in Silvestro et al. (2013) it was sister to a clade that was sister to the rest of the subfamily; unfortunately, Bratzel et al. (2022) did not sample widely in basal Bromelioideae. Givnish et al. (2013, 2014a) thought that extensive speciation depended on the evolution of ecological traits such as the adoption of the epiphytic habitat (ca 60% of the family are epiphytes), the evolution of CAM in arid environments (terrestrial CAM species are ca 13.6%), or adaptations to understory life in forests (ca 12.3%), with subsequent geographic spread and radiation into different areas and environments. However, Givnish et al. (2014a) did not see CAM photosynthesis as being a major driver of speciation here; Males (2016) also thought that CAM was unlikely to be an explanation for diversity in the family as a whole. Air and tank bromeliads may have had different centres of origin/diversification (see below). Within Bromelioideae, the evolution of tanks may be a key innovation, diversification rates increasing because extinction rates had decreased in the epiphytic habitat as compared to the harsh, dry and open conditions of more ancestral Bromelioideae (Silvestro et al. 2013). For more on tank and CAM bromeliads, see Ecology & Evolution below.\n\nPerhaps 1,060-1,800 species of Bromeliaceae, around half the family, are pollinated by hummingbirds, and these species are commonest at higher altitudes in the Andes, but less common in drier and in lowland forest habitats (Snow & Snow 1980; Stiles 1981; Benzing et al. 2000a; Kessler & Krömer 2000; Krömer et al. 2006; Givnish et al. 2008a; Kessler et al. 2019). However, insect pollination may be ancestral in the family (Aguilar-Rodríguez et al. 2019). Kessler et al. (2019) suggested that there had been 4-12 shifts to hummingbird pollination and about three times as many shifts away from bird pollination, but overall they thought that there were several factors that could lead to increased diversification rates, but that little was understood about them. Certainly simple adaptation of bromeliads to hummingbirds with different bill lengths did not fit the bill here (Kessler et al. 2019). Bird pollination in the [Pitcairnioideae [Puyoideae + Bromelioideae]] clade (there was one origin of ornithophily here) can be dated to ca 15, 13.4-13.3, or 14.1 Ma (Givnish et al. 2004a, 2011a, 2014a respectively), and bird pollination is also very common in Tillandsioideae (another origin), with a crown group age of ca 15.2 Ma, 99% of the species originating in the last ca 9.6 Ma (Givnish et al. 2014a). Nevertheless, Givnish et al. (2014a) did not see bird pollination as being a major driver of speciation in the family. Neves et al. (2020) focused on bird and bat pollination in Vriesea from the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, suggesting that pollinators were driving ecological isolation there, although there seemed to be little molecular separation of the species. Bird pollination (plants epiphytes, habitats shaded) may have been derived from bat pollination (plants epilithic, habitats open) (Neves et al. 2023). (For other major bird-pollinated clades in Central and (Andean) South America, see Lamiaceae-Nepetoideae-Salviinae, Gesneriaceae-Gesnerioideae, Heliconiaceae and Ericaceae-Vaccinieae, and for hummingbird pollination in general, see elsewhere.)\n\nA number of epiphytic Tillandsioideae are quite small plants, and heterochrony (neoteny, paedomorphosis) has been invoked to explain their evolution (Benzing et al. 2000b; see Orchidaceae-Epidendroideae-Oncidiinae for a comparable example). Donadío et al. (2022) also invoked heterochronic processes, both paedomorphosis and peramorphosis, to explain the evolution of features throughout the plant in Tillandsia subgenus Diaphoranthema.\n\nKuhn et al. (2020) summarized information on embryological variation in the family, putting it in the context of a phylogenetic tree; overall there was relatively little variation. Aguirre-Santoro et al. (2016), focussing on the Ronnbergia alliance, but also taking in some other Bromelioideae, optimize the evolution of a number of characters, while de Oliveira et al. (2017) looked at anatomical variation in the context of the phylogeny of the nidularoid complex - 11/ca 150 species were examined.\n\nBrocchinia, although a small genus of about 21 species restricted to the Roraima region, is remarkable in that it includes different growth forms - both tank plants and true terrestrials - and takes up nitrogen (N) in different ways. Of the tank plants, B. reducta may acquire N through carnivory (see below), while the terrestrial B. acuminata is an ant plant. Givnish et al. (1997) discussed the radiation of the genus, which seems to have begun only ca 14 Ma, although, compared with other younger but far more speciose bromeliad clades this is hardly a very diverse=species-rich clade (Givnish et al. 2004a, 2008a, 2011a; Givnish 2015b), and overall these other clades encompass a considerable amount of morphological diversity; they are, of course, all in a clade sister to Brocchinia (c.f. Givnish 2016).\n\nEcology & Physiology. The ecophysiology of Bromeliaceae has attracted much attention; for an early summary see C. E. Martin (1994) and for a nice discussion of water relationships in Bromeliaceae, central to understanding the ecophysiological evolution of the family, see Males (2016). The ecological preferences of basal Bromeliaceae (and of Typhaceae) are for wet and nutrient-poor conditions, and in Bromeliaceae this would include conditions like those that occur on the tepuis and surrounding areas of the Guyana shield, perhaps where the family originated (Givnish et al. e.g. 2011a; Crayn et al. 2015).\n\nAll told, about 1,780 species of bromeliads are epiphytes, rather over half the family and ca 7% of all epiphytes (see also Kress 1989; Holtum et al. 2007; Zotz, Weigelt et al. 2021 for a checklist of all vascular epiphytes, hemiepiphytes, etc.), and they are especially common in montane habitats (Benzing 1990 for much discussion; Luther & Norton 2008: epilithic species not included). Associated with the adoption of the epiphytic habit in bromeliads are the evolution of CAM photosynthesis and various novel forms of water uptake, and these are discussed below. Along with orchids and ferns, bromeliads are one of the three main epiphytic groups, but despite their smaller genomes they have larger and fewer stomata than orchids, and thicker leaves, lower nutrient concentrations, and higher water content and water use efficiency than ferns (Hietz et al. 2021); see also Benzing (1990) and Zotz et al. (2021) for the ecophysiological features of epiphytes in general - they are on the slow end of the Leaf Economic Spectrum.\n\nThe diversity of growth forms in Bromeliaceae is well known (e.g. Pittendrigh 1948; Benzing 2000; Males 2016). Bromeliads can be grouped in five ecophysiological types that depend on how the plant grows, how it absorbs water, and on its photosynthetic pathway (see also Males & Griffiths 2017b; Eggli & Gouda 2020). Type I. Terrestrial, with a well-developed absorbtive root system, C3 or CAM photosynthesis. Type II. Terrestrial, tanks forming at bases of leaves, absorbtive roots, also absorbtive trichomes at leaf base, CAM photosynthesis. Type III. Terrestrial (saxicolous)/epiphytic, central tank present, with water etc. absorbing scales, thick leaves, roots for support, most CAM photosynthesis. Type IV. Mostly epiphytic, plants with tank, with water etc. absorbing scales at leaf base, thin leaves, roots for support, C3 photosynthesis. Type V. Epiphytes (saxicolous), air/atmospheric epiphytes with water etc.-absorbing scales over whole leaf, thick leaves, CAM photosynthesis, roots for support, or none (for germination/seedling characteristics in Bromeliaceae related to these five ecophysiological types, see Kowalski et al. (2021). Note that leaves of members of Bromelioideae and Tillandsioideae (types III, IV, V) have very low stomata:trichome ratios of around 3.2-0.5:1 while in the rest of the family ratios are ca 13.6:1 (Tomlinson 1969; Males 2016). This great diversity in physiology and morphology has arisen well within the last 18 Ma (see above), thus Givnish (2014a) estimated the crown-group age of a clade of ca 630 species of tank Bromelioideae to be only some 5.5 Ma.\n\nAs just mentioned, Bromeliaceae include a major concentration of CAM plants, including the most such species of any group, along with Crassulaceae and probably Orchidaceae-Epidendroideae. Some half to two thirds of Bromelioideae have some form of CAM metabolism and ca 44% have strong CAM, CAM photosynthesis having evolved some five times or more; however, there is phylogenetic uncertainty in Puyoideae and Bromelioideae and details of CAM evolution remain somewhat unclear (Crayn et al. 2000, 2004, 2015; Reinert et al. 2003; Keeley & Rundel 2003; Schulte et al. 2005; Ming et al. 2015: parallelism at the molecular level); Aguirre-Santoro et al. (2016) noted that in the Ronnbergia alliance (Bromelioideae) there had been reversals from CAM to C3 photosynthesis. In pineapple, at least, the CAM pathway results from the reconfiguration of C3 pathways via regulatory neofunctionalization of preexisting genes, not through gene duplication (Ming et al. 2015). The number of CAM species decreases with altitude although that of C3 species reaches a maximum at around 2000 m, however, some CAM Puya grow at over 4000 m (Crayn et al. 2015). Malate in tissue of CAM plants during the night reduced the osmotic potential of the tissue, and water uptake increased (C. E. Martin 1994). Bromeliaceae, like other CAM plants, tend to have less in the way of intercellular spaces than C3 plants, presumably enabling greater storage of CO2 as malic acid in the cell vacuoles during the day, and the extreme form of CAM, succulence plus much compacted cells (Earles et al. 2018), was the result of anatomical changes perhaps not easy to accomplish that happened late in the whole process (see E. J. Edwards 2019; c.f. C4 photosynthesis). J. A. C. Smith et al. (1986) and Martin (1994) discussed the comparative ecophysiology of CAM and C3 bromeliads and Hermida-Carrera et al. (2020) the molecular evolution of RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase), an enyzme centrally involved in C fixation. For more on the details of CAM evolution, its geography, etc., see Holtum (2023) and Gilman et al. (2023); Zotz et al. (2023) question the nature of particular connections between CAM photosynthesis and the epiphytic habit.\n\nThere is considerable plasticity in the development of the CAM syndrome within genera like Puya (Schulte et al. 2011) and seedlings of Ananas, at least, CAM when adult, are C3 plants (J. Zhang et al. 2014). Menezes et al. (2020) discuss how seedlings of the CAM Acanthostachys strobilacea deal with drying conditions, interestingly, many tank Bromelioideae carry out CAM photosynthesis (Silvestro et al. 2013). There can be specialization in function within a single leaf, thus in Guzmania monostachia the bottom part of the leaf stores water as a reserve for when the tank dries out, while CAM photosynthesis intensified in the upper part of the leaf (Freschi et al. 2009); Males (2016; see also Petit et al. 2014) gives several other examples of such physiological flexibility in photosynthesis.\n\nAs bromeliad plants grow, their morphology may change quite dramatically, and one plant may change ecophysiological types as it ages, also, note that the distinction between the various features used to characterise these types may not be that sharp. Bromeliaceae can be heteroblastic, and Meisner et al. (2013; see also Males 2016) discuss the physiological changes involved. For example, young plants of tank epiphytes in shaded conditions have narrow, leaves densely covered by scales and are air epiphytes, type 5 above, but as they get bigger and have more numerous leaves there is self-shading by the leaves, and under such circumstances the adult form of the plant, a tank bromeliad with fewer, broader leaves that self-shade less, is at an advantage (Beyschlag & Zotz 2017). Heteroblasty also occurs in tank bromeliads growing in more exposed conditions, the ecophysiology of the plant changingf as it grows (Schmidt & Zotz 2001; Petit et al. 2014). Reinert and Meirelles (1993) looked at the development of Vriesea geniculata, a plant of the inselburgs of the Atlantic Forest. The young plant was an atmospheric type IV plant, with succulent narrow leaves, scales covering ca 83% of the adaxial and ca 68% of the abaxial leaf surfaces. The adult plant was a tank type 3 plant, the scales covering only around 15% of the leaf. Similarly, young plants of Alcantarea are succulent rosette plants, but when mature they are tank bromeliads (Versieux et al. 2010). Meisner et al. (2013) suggested that heteroblastic changes in leaf shape were quite often not accompanied by any obvious changes in physiology or anatomy and were not associated withe change from atmospheric to tank form. However, in a comparison of various aspects of the leaf - morphology, venation density, hydraulic capacity, etc. - in Pitcairnia and some terrestrial Bromelioideae along with environmental factors like precipitation, Males (2017a) found suggestive correlations between foliar and environmental features. Indeed, there is quite extensive variation in leaf morphology within genera like Pitcairnia and Cryptanthus (Males 2017a). Roots may change, too, switching from being absorbtive to being soley for attachment, as in V. geniculata, where younger plants might have root hairs; in both young and older plants the root system was sclerified (Reinert & Meirelles 1993).\n\nIndumentum in Bromeliaceae is very variable (Ehler 1977) and multicellular hairs on the leaf surface are integral to the ecophysiology of both tank plants and air epiphytes; details of how they take up water and nutrients are discussed in C. A. Takahashi et al. (2022). As mentioned above, how much the scales cover the leaf may vary during development - and even proceeding from the base to the apex of the leaf (e.g. Reinert & Meirelles 1993). Tillandsioideae have elegant multicellular peltate trichomes that may completely cover the plant and through which the plant takes in water and nutrients - water moves in as liquid by wicking, but can only be lost by evaporation (see Mez 1904 for detailed early studies; Ehler 1977; Papini et al. 2010 for scale development). In Tillandsia there are regularly-arranged central shield cells, four in the centre, eight surrounding those four, then sixteen; these shield cells have much thickened outer cellulosic walls, and they are surrounded by radially arranged cells. Underneath the shield cells is a central dome cell. All these cells are dead - although in some cases these cells may be alive (Takahashi et al. 2022). Beneath the dome cell are two living foot cells with outer walls surrounded by cuticle (Raux et al. 2020). The scales flex as they dry and so pull away from the leaf surface, but when there is fog or it rains they readily take up water, coming to lie flat on the surface (Benzing 1976; Pierce et al. 2001), Ha et al. (2021) noting that in T. usneoides this flattening of the scale wings was sequential, a film of water between scale and leaf propagating itself across the leaf. The subsequent absorbtion of water and nutrients by the scales is a two-step process. For example, in the rosette-forming T. ionantha water moves into the cells of the scales by capillary action in the fluid phase, and this happens within minutes of wetting, and then over the next three hours or so it moves into the body of the leaf by the aid of aquaporins, proteins in plant cell walls (Ohrui et al. 2007). Indeed, water moves through the thick cellulose walls of the scale surface and into the lumina of the scale cells with almost no impediment, the plasma membrance of the foot cell being the main resistor. However, when the scale dries, there is no reverse wicking effect. Rather, movement of water is in the gas phase, the dead cells drying out, water moving into their empty lumina only by evaporation, and then water vapour diffusing with difficulty through the thick walls of the shield cells; the cuticle surrounding the foot cells further impedes water loss (Raux et al. 2020). It has also been suggested that the dry, white scales of some species of Tillandsia may reflect light and so provide photoprotection (Pierce 2008); see also Orchidaceae for UV light and epiphytism.\n\nEpiphytic bromeliads tend to be found on trees with rough bark, although species of Tillandsia on the Pacific coast of Mexico preferred large trees with compound, pulvinate leaves, the leaflets moving during the day and affecting the light that the plants received (Reyes-García et al. (2007). In general, air epiphytes can maintain photosynthetic activity when leaf relative water content is low, their leaves tend to be more succulent, and they obtain water from rain showers (Cháves-Sahhagún et al. 2019); as mentioned above, succulence is common in the leaves of group III and V bromeliads, and Eggli and Gouda (2020) discuss succulence in Bromeliaceae; the water storing tissue there is parenchymatous mesophyll. Reyes-García et al. (2011) compared water uptake in CAM tank, succulent air and non-succulent air epiphytes in Tillandsia; the non-succulent air epiphytes like T. usneoides, etc., caught water from fog while the tank epiphytes relied on rain water stored in their tanks, their stomata closing when it was used up. Species of Tillandsia on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico varied in their ability to take up water from dew; a tank and an air epiphyte could do this, two other air epiphytes could not, although the effect of drought on the plant depended on far more than this (Cháves-Sahhagún et al. 2019). However, in Tillandsia growing on the Pacific coast, air epiphytes taking up water from dew, etc., had their maximum photosynthetic activity when there was no rain, while in tank epiphytes photosynthesis was practically limited to the rainy season (Reyes-García et al. (2007). Different species of Tillandsia from the Ilha Grande, southeast Brazil, grew in different places in the tree canopies, T. usneoides with its long, dense scales happily growing in the most exposed sites (Miranda et al. 2020). Virzo de Santo et al. (1976) also discuss the uptake of water from the atmosphere, in this case by ground-dwelling species of Tillandsia growing in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert - they have no roots and are basically air epiphytes; they obtain both water and nutrients from fog (A. L. González et al. 2011, see also papers cited by Koch et al. 2022 - \"Living at its dry limits: Tillandsiales in the Atacama desert.\").\n\nPerhaps somewhat paradoxically, adaxial leaf surfaces in Bromelioideae and some other subfamilies are hydrophilic while abaxial surfaces are hydrophobic (Reuter & Brown 2009; see also Fagaceae). Dense scales or a powdery epicuticular wax make the abaxial leaf surface water-repellent so the stomata there remain functional even in wet conditions, and it has even been suggested that repelling water was an ancestral function of bromeliaceous scales (Pierce et al. 2001). The less dense scales on the adaxial surfaces of the leaves are involved in nutrient uptake (Benzing et al. 1985; Pierce et al. 2001) here, too. Thus phosphate is taken up very efficiently by the hairs on the adaxial surfaces of the leaves in tank epiphytes like Aechmea fasciculata and either moved elsewhere in the plant or stored as phosphorus-containing phytin (Winkler & Zotz 2009; Gonsiska & Givnish 2009). For further details of xylem anatomy, etc., and water transport, see Males (2016 and references). Leaves of Bromeliaceae also do not seem to lose metabolites easily (Benzing & Burt 1970; McWilliams 1974).\n\nAir epiphytes are common in Tillandsioideae, in some species roots being for attachment only while other species have no roots at all (for seedlings, see Gatin 1911; Kowalski et al. 2021). Thus adult plants of Tillandsia usneoides (Spanish moss) lack roots, the plants growing readily on any available support - branches, telegraph wires, etc. (Wester & Zotz 2010 and references); the leaves take over the nutritional function of roots, however, the plant lacks photoprotection (Reyes García & Griffiths 2009). Perhaps somewhat paradoxically the dense trichomes may lead to a reduction in CO2 uptake when the plant is wetted, the trichomes plastering the surface of the leaf and making CO2 uptake more difficult (C. E. Martin 1994).\n\nTank epiphytes occur in a major clade in Bromelioideae, some Brocchinia, a few Tillandsioideae, etc., the tanks being formed by the closely appressed overlapping bases of the leaves (in some Bromelioideae every leaf forms a small basal tank). Tanks may hold up to around 6.5 l of water, more commonly half a litre or less, although some old records suggest that tanks of Alcantarea imperialis, for example, might hold up to 45 l; the water content of the hydrated plant varies little, although much of that may effectivly be unavailable, depending on the species (Zotz et al. 2020). Zotz and Thomas (1999) followed the drying out of tanks; they found that by ca 30 days the tank of Guzmania monostachia (= Tillandsia) had dried out and the plant had lost ca 50% of the water in its tissues, while in similarly-sized plants of T. fasciculata it took 40-50 days for this to happen. In such situations, the hydraulic conductance of the leaf is affected by changes both in the xylem, e.g. the formation of embolisms, and in extraxylary tissues, e.g. changes in intercellular spaces, aquaporins (membrane proteins involved in water transport), etc., indeed, changes in the latter seem to most affect hydraulic resilience in G. monostachia (North et al. 2019). Intercellular spaces in Vriesea and other Vrieseeae are area of stellate parenchyma between the vascular bundles (Versieux et al. 2010). Roots of tank bromeliads may grow into the tank where they absorb water and the products of the rotted detritus in the tank; Pittendrigh (1948) noted that such roots were mycorrhizal, while roots growing into the soil were not obviously mycorrhizal. Many tank Bromelioideae also carry out CAM photosynthesis (Silvestro et al. 2013: see above). Aguirre-Santoro et al. (2016) note that in the Ronnbergia alliance (Bromelioideae) there have been reversals to C3 photosynthesis and the terrestrial habitat, and also the loss of tanks.\n\nIn some tank bromeliads the apical meristem remains submerged and at the bottom of the tank. Nogueira et al. (2021) focussed on nidularoids (Bromelioideae), and there the inflorescence is congested, the flower buds developing under water and opening above; after flowering, the perianth rots, and the fleshy fruits initially develop under water but later rise above the surface as their pedicels elongate. The walls of the tank are made up of large, conspicuously-coloured inflorescence bracts, although Canistropsis has water-containing bracts at the end of a somewhat elongated peduncle. Taxa with this behaviour appear not to form a monophyletic group; genera tend to be small and restricted to the Atlantic Forest, but the large genus Neoregelia is widespread (Nogueira et al. 2021). The whole system is perhaps functionally analogous to a water calyx.\n\nBromeliaceae in general have extremely low leaf N concentrations. Takahashi et al (2022) suggested considerable complexity in detauils of N uptake, for example, the scales of air epiphytes may be modified depending on the source of N (urea, nitrate, etc.), and the N source might affect the amount of water-storage tissue in the leaf. N metabolism in epiphytic tank Bromeliaceae can be complex, with N moving into the plant via frass and general detritus produced by insectivores living in close association with the plants, sometimes aided by the activities of associated microbiota. In a study of 22 individuals of Aechmea nudicaulis (Bromelioideae), Louca et al. (2016) found that the various operations involved in breaking down the contents of the tanks - ureolysis, cellulolysis, methanogenesis, etc. - went on in each, but different organisms were involved from plant to plant; I have not seen species comparisons. The pH of the water in the tank affects the microorganisms that grow there (Goffredi et al. 2011). Inselbacher et al. (2007) found that micro-organisms in the tank of Vriesea gigantea increased the mineralization of organic compounds to NH4+, the form in which N was taken up, and chitinases may have been produced by the plant (as they are in carnivorous plants - e.g. Jopcik et al. 2017 and references). A variety of βproteobacteria isolated from the tanks of Werauhia gladioliflora could utilize N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, the building block of chitin; they also broke down a variety of plant-derived C sources (Klann et al. 2016). The presence of chitinases and nitrogenases emphasized the importance of tanks in both C and N cycling (Goffredi et al. 2011). That being said, in a study of Mexican tank epiphytes growing at various altitudes the amount of litter that they captured was small relative to the total amount of litter produced and it had overall little effect on the C and nutrient cycles (Aguilar-Cruz et al. 2021).\n\nHowever, detritivores themselves may not be directly involved in facilitating N uptake by the plant. They may indeed break down debris in the tanks, but Ngai and Srivastava (2006) suggested that carnivorous damsel fly larvae might be more important: They ate the detritivore larvae, and it was N from the damsel fly faecal pellets that was important for the plant, and when the detritivore adults flew away, the N that they contained was lost to the plant. Leroy et al. (2013) proposed that associations of tank bromeliads in particular with mutualistic ants enhances N uptake of the former, N moving from ants and their debris into the plant via its roots. Carnivorous ants may show this effect most, thus in an ant-association of the terrestrial Quesnelia arvensis, which grows on poor soils in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, it was the predatory ant Odontomachus hastatus that had the greatest effect on the plant, the largely vegetarian Camponotus crassus the least, although the latter is also a very small ant... (Gonçalves et al. 2016a). Bromeliads can also take up N from the excreta of spiders living on the plants, the amount depending on the season, the disposition of the N inside the plant, and on the growth form of the plant (Gonçalves et al. 2011), thus frass, etc., from the jumping spider Psecas chapoda improved the N balance of the terrestrial Bromelia balansae, bacteria perhaps being a way station in the movement of N to the plant; note that B. balansae does not form tanks (Romero et al. 2006; Gonçalves et al. 2014). Nyman et al. (1987) found that a variety of amino acids moved from liquid placed on the leaves of Tillandsia pauciflora into the plant, arginine and lysine moving in fastest, about four times as fast as neutral amino acids, which in turn moved in about three times faster than acidic amino acids. Blue-green algae may fix N in some bromeliads, although in such cases there are perhaps more algae in seepage areas from the tank than in the tank itself (Bermudes & Benzing 1991). Vergne et al. (2021) noted that a high proportion of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APG) in particular - they range from aerobic photoheterotrophs to anaerobic photoautotrophs - were found in the phytotelmata of the bromeliads from French Guiana that they sampled. Indeed, some 41-79 of the sequences used to enumerate the bacterial taxa in these phytotelmata were associated with APG groups that had a N-fixing gene toolkit, although N fixation had yet to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the bacteria involved varied depending of the identity of the bromeliad (Vergne et al. 2021).\n\nPhosphorus may be another important nutrient for the plant, as in other epiphytes (Zotz & Asshoff 2010).\n\nThere are important physiological differences among epiphytes that do not seem to respect the tank/air distinction as much as they reflect phylogeny. L.-L. B. Müller et al. (2017b) found that the young Tillandsioideae they studied, which included both tank and air epiphytes, grew much more slowly and had a much lower relative growth rate than the Bromelioideae, all tank epiphytes, whose relative growth rate was much more normal, the differences being due to differences in the net assimilation rate. Interestingly, Tillandsioideae showed relatively high total amino acid/asparagine accumulation when fed anuran faeces compared with Bromelioideae, perhaps allowing for faster growth in the latter, greater stress-resistance in the former (Gonçalves et al. 2016b). Some aspects of germination behaviour, for example, lower thermal limits and lower thermal optima, distinguish germination/young seedlings of Tillandsioideae from those of Bromelioideae, although overall thermal niche breadth did not differ much (L.-L. B. Müller et al. 2017b; see also Whigham et al. 2008 for germination, seedlings, etc.).\n\nAs mentioned above, the air and tank groups possibly have different centres of origin/diversification (the Andes versus the Brazilian Shield). However, they often grow together, and in any particular locality, or even on a single tree, tank and air bromeliads may partition the environment in distinctive ways. Thus Reyes García et al. (2007) observed that in Chamela (the west coast of Mexico) almost 40% of the bromeliads were growing in about 5% of the trees, and they were most frequent in trees with compound leaves, perhaps because the light could penetrate the canopy more easily. Different species grew in different parts of the canopy, i.a. depending how the plant could take up water; perhaps paradoxically, the air epiphyte Tillandsia usneoides prefered shady conditions, but it lacks photoprotection - and it also seemed to prefer plants with simple leaves (Reyes García & Griffiths 2009).\n\nC. E. Martin (1994) suggested that epiphytic bromeliads were in general resistant to drought, their water potentials remaing high; juvenile atmospheric Tillandsia deppeana was more drought-tolerant than the adult plants, which were tank epiphytes. Transpiration rates of epiphytic bromeliads were low, and those of C3 plants were rather lower than those of CAM plants. The plants could be very desiccation tolerant, detached shoots taking months before their water content was reduced 50%. Most epiphytic bromeliads had the photosynthetic responses of shade plants, although many could/did grow in full sunlight. Epiphytic species had (4-)29-104(-411) stomata/mm2, while the figures for terrestrial bromeliads were (10-)78-110(-446)/mm2\n\nFor ideas about the importance of the evolution of features like CAM photosynthesis and the tank habit in the diversitifcation of the family, see Divergence & Distribution above. See also Gesneriaceae, Melastomataceae, Ericaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae and ferns, other major epiphytic groups.\n\nIn the hyperarid lomas of coastal Chile and Peru, bromeliads, especially Tillandsia, can dominate, thus T. landbeckii is found by itself growing in bands on the otherwise bare ground over some 1,500 km2, the plant - it has CAM photosynthesis - absorbing water from the coastal fogs (Koch et al. 2019). Such communities have the highest biomass of any bromeliad community in the world, and practically no other angiosperms can stand conditions here (Rundel & Dillon 1998).
