        "text": "Archive 50 Archive 51 Archive 52 Archive 53 Archive 54 Archive 55 Archive 56\n\nCurrently a drivers Formula One carrer is set out in the following way (taken from Charles Leclerc):\n\nFormula One\n\nTest driver (2016-2017)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSauber (2018)\n\nFerrari (2019-)\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nI.e we prioritise team over season and in this case it is fine. However in instances where a driver changes team mid-season we get this (taken from Max Verstappen):\n\nFormula One career\n\nScuderia Toro Rosso (2014–2016)\n\n2014 season\n\n2015 season: Youngest full time driver\n\n2016 season\n\nRed Bull (2016–present)\n\n2016 season: Youngest race winner\n\n2017 season\n\n2018 season\n\n2019 season\n\n2020 season\n\nAnd this is where the problem arises. In my mind Formula One (or indeed any sport) is defined by the season much more than the team and yet we've split up the 2016 season (a level 4 header) across two level 3 headers. To me it makes no sense to split up a drivers season just because he was promoted/demoted in said season. His season just carries on where it left off., the only thing that has changed is that he is in a different car, he still caries over his points tally and his championship position.\n\nI have 2 possible ways to deal with this (both of which I boldly implemented at Pierre Gasly and Alexander Albon but were reverted for no reason by an IP) although I am open to other suggestions:\n\nOption 1\n\nFormula One career\n\nScuderia Toro Rosso (2014–2015)\n\n2014 season\n\n2015 season: Youngest full time driver\n\n2016 season\n\nRed Bull and Toro Rosso (2016) Youngest race winner\n\nRed Bull (2017-present)\n\n2017 season\n\n2018 season\n\n2019 season\n\n2020 season\n\nThis keeps the team headings but still keeps the 2016 season together.\n\nOr\n\nOption 2\n\nFormula One career\n\n2014 season\n\n2015 season: Youngest full time driver\n\n2016 season: Youngest race winner\n\n2017 season\n\n2018 season\n\n2019 season\n\n2020 season\n\nWhere we get rid of specifing teams completly.\n\nLike I said this changes only need to be implemted to drivers who changed teams mid-season to keep their season efforts toghether under one heading. I would support option 1 over option 2 but only because it is similar to what we have now and with drivers whose article won't need changing and I do see the benefit of grouping thier efforts under one team under one heading.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nIn my opinion, Option 1 is the better choice for maintaining the team headings without splitting seasons.\n\n5225C (talk)\n\nI'd go with option 2 because each year is self-contained. Even if a driver stays with a team for multiple years, each individual year has little to no measurable effect on subsequent years. It would also help in the case of high-profile driver articles like Schumacher, Vettel and Hamilton where they won multiple titles with the same team. Grouping Hamilton's Mercedes career under one sub-heading could get messy quuckly.\n\nThat being said, I could get behind a hybrid option: organised by team for most drivers, but organised by year in special circumstances (ie multiple World Champions, or an extended stay with a particular team). While I appreciate the desire for a consistent format across articles with a similar topic, I can also see that getting in the way at times. Organising an article based on the year might benefit Vettel's article while organising by team might benefit Ericsson's. Does that mean we should organise Ericsson's article by year because Vettel's article does it, or that we should organise Vettel's article by team because it Ericsson's article does it? I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all solution here, but rather a one-size-fits-most approach. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nI agree with Mclarenfan17. Certain drivers will lend themselves to different layouts and so I don't think prescribing a particular layout would be of any benefit. Go with whatever works best for a given driver. Consistency for consistency sake is self-defeating. A7V2 (talk)\n\n@A7V2 and Mclarenfan17: I agree completely. However, I came here because I tried to adopt that philosophy over at Pierre Gasly and Alexander Albon and was reverted. Due to being reverted I am mostly here to gain some consensus to adopt the above suggestions at those articles.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nI think in their cases since they switched teams during a season and, as McLarenfan points out, each season is more or less self contained, option 2 is most suitable. A7V2 (talk)\n\nI would definitely suggest that switching teams mid-championship would warrant structuring the article by year rather than by team. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nI've been wondering wether we couldn't simply keep the existing system by simply removing the word \"season\" from the section headings. That way we would no longer give the impression we are splitting season in parts.Tvx1\n\nno longer give the impression we are splitting season in parts. - how does that solve the problem? A drivers season campaign would still be cut in half because of an event which is doesn't affect the continuation of his/her Championship. It's not about the impression but about the fact its actually happening.\n\nSSSB (talk) It\n\nNo it wouldn't. Because then we would simply be going by years. And in the above case for instance, Verstappen did drive for Toro Rosso and Red Bull Racing during 2016. It's just much less confusing without the word \"season\" in those titles.Tvx1\n\nI'm sorry but I don't see how the addition/removal of the word season changes anything. For the current Verstappen article it would produce:\n\nFormula One career\n\nScuderia Toro Rosso (2014–2016)\n\n2014\n\n2015: Youngest full time driver\n\n2016\n\nRed Bull (2016–present)\n\n2016: Youngest race winner\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nThen his 2016 season is still split between two headers which is exactly the problem we have if we keep the word season there. Grouping his championship campaign together is more important than grouping his activities by team which is the problem I am trying to solve, removing the word season doesn't change this.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nDetailed explanation of what happens to each driver race-by-race should not be written in biographical articles. This sort of information belong in race articles. Formula One driver articles are substantially over-written. In wikipedia driver bios should be written as a season summary not race-by-race with individual events only highlighted if they are particularly notable. --Falcadore (talk)\n\nFalcadore, I know and agree, but that doesn't awnser the question I'm asking.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nWell I'm suggesting the words should be redistrubuted, but to answer specifically, both or neither. It depends on the driver. Some drivers flit around from team to team achieving nothing of great note. \"Early years\" or \"Later years\". Perhaps only their time at one team is fantastically notable. Alan Jones for example. He raced for seven to nine teams but apart from one race for Shadow only his time at Williams is important. Jacques Villeneuve's F1 history is Williams, BAR, then everyone else in a single chapter. --Falcadore (talk)\n\n@Falcadore: - again, I agree, but I am asking specifically about Albon and Gasly because whenever i tried to apply one of the above suggestions (following the depends on the driver mindset) I am being reverted by an IP who seemingly disagrees with the depends on the driver mindset. So I am trying to gain consensus for changing the order on those two. By no stretch of the imagination am I suggesting we apply this to every driver.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nIn the past few hours, I have noticed an anomaly emerging. Editors on the 2020 championship article consider the Australian Grand Prix to have gone ahead (all drivers are listed as taking part in round 1)—but some editors at the race article suggest that the race did not take place (see here). We need some consistencies across the articles. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nWe can consider this from two perspectitives, logically and according to sources. Now the race did not take place, that is true. However, the Grand Prix is not defined as only being the race, it is the whole weekend. The AUS Grand Prix weekend had started. Therefore the race weekend did take place, if only in part (which is why 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix is not a suitable guide). Therefore logic dictates that the Grand Prix should take the place of round 1.\n\nIf we consider sources we should seek the highest authority. My first thought was the official F1 website. They consider AUS to be round 1, but they also still say that CHN will be round 4, so... My next port of call was fia website's calendar. They also still list AUS as round 1 (but acknowledge that CHN was postponed). These are the highest authority sources there are on the matter. It is therefore clear to me that AUS still takes its place as round 1.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nHow we're treating it now seems fine to me. However, if races are reinstated after being cancelled, that could pose a much greater problem.\n\n5225C (talk)\n\nIf we consider the March 2020 event to have run we will have to list it twice in the calendar. If we don't consider it to have run we deal with it in the same way as 2020 Chinese Grand Prix.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nThat's not really what I was trying to point out. I was just trying to highlight the way the race was being treated differently in different articles. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nAll we can do is add these pages on our watchlists and make sure they stay consistant. Unless you want (and there is sufficent content changes) to request page protection.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nI think it depends on whether or not the cancelled event remains a part of the calendar. If so, we will have to list it twice, but if not we can simply update the article and remove the cancelled event from the championship standings.\n\n5225C (talk)\n\nWhy would we have to list an event twice? Surely if e.g. the Chinese Grand Prix were held later in the season, we simply only list it once where it actually took place.Tvx1\n\n@Tvx1:, becuase officially there was an Australian Grand Prix which happened this weekend as it was only cancelled after the weekend began\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Because the AUSGP was cancelled and the CHNGP was postponed. Cancelled implied the event was going to take place and then did not., while postponed means delayed. If the cancelled GP is later removed as an official round, then yes, I'd say we remove it, but if the FIA and F1 continue to treat the cancelled event as a round then so must we.\n\n5225C (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) I'm of the opinion that since no session ever started, nor were any laps turned, that the event never happened. Supercars and S5000 had sessions, so for them it's a normal \"cancelled before race completion\" setup. Obviously, the best solution is to determine what the FIA and F1 websites do to the statistics of the drivers that arrived for the weekend; but in the absence of any of that so far, treat the race weekend as if it was never even scheduled in the first place. 🇮🇪 TheChrisD {💬|✏️}\n\nTheChrisD, we have [1] and [2] which suggest that the Grand Prix took place officially\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nThose pages also suggest Bahrain and Vietnam are still going on, despite the very recent postponement announcement. We shouldn't treat them as gospel until they're updated to reflect recent changes (basically, WP:AGE MATTERS). 🇮🇪 TheChrisD {💬|✏️}\n\nAgreed, but right now that's the best we got.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nAs a personal appreciation, I think there is a big difference between canceling (or postponing, that doesn't matter) a month before and canceling with all the teams (McLaren left voluntarily) a few hours before the start of the official sections. I think that difference should be marked in the articles. --Adriel 00 (talk)\n\nSince it's now looking like many events will be cancelled and/or rescheduled, perhaps from the perspective of showing the schedule and points tables a good solution would be to follow what was done on 1992 World Sportscar Championship: have two separate schedules, one the original, and one the actual, and then for points tables only include the events which do run. (I'm not going to give an opinion on how the Australian GP should appear in the tables or not given what some above have said about it being cancelled once it had started or not). A7V2 (talk)\n\nI suggested something similar here:\n\nSchedule of events Round Grand Prix Circuit Race date Races cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic 1 – Australian Grand Prix Albert Park Circuit, Melbourne — 2 – Bahrain Grand Prix Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir — 3 – Vietnamese Grand Prix Hanoi Street Circuit, Hanoi — 4 – Dutch Grand Prix Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort — 5 – Spanish Grand Prix Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Montmeló — 6 – Monaco Grand Prix Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo — Revised calendar issued after pandemic declared over 7 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix Baku City Circuit, Baku 7 June 8 2 Canadian Grand Prix Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montréal 14 June 9 3 French Grand Prix Circuit Paul Ricard, Le Castellet 28 June 10 4 Austrian Grand Prix Red Bull Ring, Spielberg 5 July\n\nIt's not perfect, but I think it works. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nI hadn't seen your proposal there. Yes I think that would work well. A7V2 (talk)\n\nIt just needs some tinkering. Especially with races having two round numbers. Maybe I'm breaking my own cardinal rule of table design and having the table do too much that should be carried out by prose.\n\nSchedule of events Round Grand Prix Circuit Race date Races cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic – Australian Grand Prix Albert Park Circuit, Melbourne — – Bahrain Grand Prix Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir — – Vietnamese Grand Prix Hanoi Street Circuit, Hanoi — – Dutch Grand Prix Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort — – Spanish Grand Prix Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Montmeló — – Monaco Grand Prix Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo — Revised calendar issued after pandemic declared over 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix Baku City Circuit, Baku 7 June 2 Canadian Grand Prix Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montréal 14 June 3 French Grand Prix Circuit Paul Ricard, Le Castellet 28 June 4 Austrian Grand Prix Red Bull Ring, Spielberg 5 July\n\nThat would make it easier to add cancelled rounds back in. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nThat could work, but I would prefer to use a formatting similar to the aforementioned sportscar example.Tvx1\n\n@Tvx1: the problem there is that it requires a lot of duplication of content. The size of the article is going to balloon pretty rapidly for what might only amount to a small difference. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nThere wouldn't be that much duplication. Mostly the column headers. And looking at the average length of our season article and what are generally the longest sections, there is quite some margin before the calendar section would balloon. This is exceptional and unprecedented situation and with four races already cancelled or postponed it is no longer a small difference. Using the sportscar example would not be undue here.Tvx1\n\nI think that if none of the races are rescheduled the most suitable case would be the first option Mclarenfan presented. However if any of the event's are rescheduled we would want to look at relpicating the sport's car example as the clearest way to present the new calendar.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nWhat was done in the 1955 article where a bunch of races were cancelled. Maybe this is not something to be tabluated but written? --Falcadore (talk)\n\nIf the all postponed events end up cancelled then that would be best. But isn't this imparactical if the events are successfully rescheduled. Then a secnd table would be the clearest way to present the 'new' calander.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nI have noticed that the subjects Alfa Romeo in Formula One, Honda in Formula One, Mercedes-Benz in Formula One and Renault in Formula One (there might be others too) have two separate Wikidata items, meaning that, for example, it's not possible to go from the English page to the German page on the Mercedes F1 article. Should those Wikidata items on these subjects be merged so that is possible? Carfan568 (talk)\n\nI would expect three different teams to have three different articles and three different Wikidata entries,if that’s what you mean.\n\n5225C (talk)\n\nShould those Wikidata items on these subjects be merged so that is possible? yes they should be together, what you have to do is manually remove them all from one and then add them back onto the other.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@5225C: I think he is asking whether Alfa Romeo in Formula One should share a wikidata entry with its german equivilant.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nBut part if the problem is that, taking Alfa Romeo in Formula One as an example, the German's (for example) don't have a equivilant, they include it as part of Alfa Romeo in motorsport which are linked through wikidata. Therefore it is not possible to link Alfa Romeo in Formula One to its German equivilant as it doesn't exist.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nIf that’s what Carfan568 means, absolutely, but that isn’t a “merge”, it’s simply adding data to the Wikidata entry.\n\n5225C (talk)\n\n@5225C: I think what Carfan is getting at is that there are 2 wikidata entries for the same article, I've come across this before as well. Thats what he means by merging (although this is just a hunch).\n\nBut part of the problem is that, taking Alfa Romeo in Formula One as an example, the German wikipedia (for example) don't have a equivilant, they include it as part of Alfa Romeo in motorsport which are linked through wikidata. Therefore it is not possible to link Alfa Romeo in Formula One to its German equivilant as it doesn't exist.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nSo to clarify:\n\n1. Articles for the for the same topic have different scopes on different Wikipedia’s (F1 vs. motorsport)\n\n2. Wikidata entries exist for both articles\n\n3. The articles should be linked but can’t because of the different scope\n\n5225C (talk)\n\nPartly yes, for some articles they can't be merged becuase articles have different scopes such as the Alfa Romeo example above. But for others there are 2 entries on wikidata for an article with the same scope that need to be merged. I just did the one for Mercedes. — Preceding unsigned comment added by SSSB (talk • contribs)\n\nYes, I meant that that there are 2 Wikidata entries for the same article. The German Alfa article seems to cover other motorsport series as well, so that's why it's linked to the \"Alfa Romeo in motorsport\" Wikidata item, but there are 2 Wikidata entries for their F1 involvement: Q622489 and Q65960697. Carfan568 (talk)\n\nOkay, thanks for pointing out that last one, I'd missed it. I've merged them and have done the equivilant for the other ones you listed at the top of this page (Mercedes, Honda and Renault). If there are any I missed feel free to come back to me.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nThanks for your work. I'm not sure, but maybe BMW Sauber and BMW in Formula One could be merged. Carfan568 (talk)\n\nI'd be cuatious about that one. It is basiclly the Alfa Romeo in Formula One situation for Germany but applied to our wiki and to more articles.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nAlso English Wiki has a page in both wikidata entries.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nEurohunter has reverted those merges, saying that \"Formula One team is not the same as whole activity in F1 (team, engine supplier, sponsor)\". However most of the \"team\" articles that I went to seemed to also cover the engine history, or were stub, so is this really necessary? Also, does \"F1\" next to the company's name in the title mean that it's just covering the team? Carfan568 (talk)\n\nWD has practice to not mess different items like above. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nIf you look at BMW there are even separate entries for \"BMW Motorsport\" (motorsport division name) and for BMW in motorsport which include \"BMW Motorsport\" and other BMW divisions in motorsport. Please do not mess them. There are also BMW in Formula One and BMW Sauber articles. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nWell, look for example at the Japanese pages of Renault, Honda and Mercedes, their names are just F1 next to the company name and the articles cover all of their history in F1, but they are linked to the \"team\" Wikidata items. The same situation exists for multiple other languages. Should the Wikidata items then be properly organised, so that articles which cover all of their history in F1 are linked to the \"in Formula One\" item and articles which cover just the team are linked to the \"team\" item? Carfan568 (talk)\n\n@Eurohunter: could you answer the question above? Carfan568 (talk)\n\nI think I have given more than enough time to answer now, and since there is no evidence of disagreement, I will organise the items according to their content. Carfan568 (talk)\n\nI know, this is probably a stupid question, but... I know this is also on other articles too, but shouldn’t Michael Schumacher with the DSQ be classified after all the DNF drivers? I don’t know if it was a rule back then to put the DSQ drivers before the DNFed ones. I know that’s what they do modernly, you can see from 2019 Japanese Grand Prix that both Renaults are DSQ but classified after Max Verstappen. The official website does not even classify him in the results page. FORMULA1FAN71 (talk)\n\n@FORMULA1FAN71: yes he should. I just moved it to the bottom. Remember you can be WP:BOLD next time.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: Hmmm, well, maybe I should have checked the source, it’s an archive to the old F1 site from 2014. There, it states the DSQ was indeed placed before the DNF’ed people, and it also lists the DNQ people in the results part. All of the other articles from 1994 follow this pattern. BUT, the modern, updated F1.com lists the results as you changed them. Question: A. Should we update every race from this year with the circumstances used here while using a citation from the modern website, or B. Should we revert these standings to the original and keep the citations the same. FORMULA1FAN71 (talk)\n\n@FORMULA1FAN71: well consistancy from article to article is not needed, we are also under no obligation to format our results the same way as the source. But I would support changing all the results to reflect the situation at the current F1 website. The thing is that different sources present the results a different way. StatsF1 lists Schumacher at the top becuase he finished the race first and was only disqualified later. Both these sources are equally valid to cite the results table on this page. This only adds to the notion that we don't need to present it in the same way as any source so long as the article as a whole presents the same information (even if its in a different way).\n\nTherefore we can keep the article as it is without changing the source (although I would support replacing the source with a non archived version as the current version of the source presents more information better (in my opinion)). And I would support making the same changes everywhere else.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: That’s great. I will change the sources if I can. But I do not know how to change the tables as that is in markup and I can only use the vis editor FORMULA1FAN71 (talk)\n\n@SSSB: @FORMULA1FAN71: No disrespect intended, but I think this discussion needs to continue on the WP:F1 talk page (if it hasn't done so already, of course).\n\nI'm still not completely on board with non-qualifiers being removed from the race results tables. Nor am I completely on board with all disqualified drivers (both during the race, like Mansell at the 1989 and 1991 Portuguese GPs, and after it) being listed after the drivers who retired.\n\nI think we should seek the opinions of more than just two users. And the best way for that to happen is for this discussion to continue on the WP:F1 talk page (again, if it hasn't done so already). 80.233.50.63 (talk)\n\nI don't believe it has. It definitly hasn't recently. Feel free to take it there.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nOr better still. Place an advertisment for this discussion there. WOuld you mind explaining why you prefer it the way you do (barring in mind what has been said above).\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: @FORMULA1FAN71: Ever since I first looked at Wikipedia's F1 race articles - which was a considerably long time ago - it seems to me to have always been the style that the non-qualifiers (and non-pre-qualifiers where applicable) are listed at the bottom of the race results table, and drivers that were disqualified during the race are listed before the drivers that had already retired from the race at that point (and, obviously, after the drivers that retired later on in the race). In other words, I've come to see it as the status quo.\n\nSo removing the non-qualifiers and non-pre-qualifiers from these tables - and grouping all the disqualified drivers together - feels to me like a pretty seismic change in that status quo, and hence I feel it should be discussed on the WP:F1 talk page. Making these big changes based on the opinions of just two users feels plain wrong - I for one would certainly like to know the opinions of the other users who frequently edit F1 race articles, like User:Falcadore, User:GTHO and User:DH85868993. Otherwise, it just comes across as two users editing these articles to suit themselves and maybe one or two others, which isn't good, is it?\n\nCall all this whatever synonym of \"testicles\" you so desire, if you feel so compelled (\"sloblock\" is my preferred choice, BTW), but it genuinely is how I feel. :) ChupoKlasky1991 (talk)\n\n@ChupoKlasky1991: I honestly do not mind about the DNQ/DNPQ stuff being in the race results, but I do feel it is unnecessary even as that has come across as the norm. They haven't participated in a race they weren't allowed to take part in, so why should they be mentioned. As for DSQ placement, that should and would most likely stay where it is at the back. If you look at the most recent DSQs: 2014 Australian Grand Prix, 2015 Brazilian Grand Prix, 2018 Italian Grand Prix, 2018 United States Grand Prix, and as previously mentioned 2019 Japanese Grand Prix. All of these have drivers disqualified and placed at the back. I feel that if this was discussed more, no action would be taken to place because these articles are made up to recent standards that would've already been discussed. That would also make this article more up to date with the placement. FORMULA1FAN71 (talk)\n\n@ChupoKlasky1991:, this way of dealing with DNQ's is also the current standard and how it was dealt with the last time we had DNQ's (2011 Australian Grand Prix and 2012 Australian Grand Prix). I also dispute that this is a seismic change. They are still in the other tables. I also don't think it makes any sense to add DNQ's into race results given they aren't even allowed to particpate in the race. But I will add an advertisment to this discussion on WT:F1\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nConsistency for this isn't necessary. In \"modern\" times yes, DSQs are usually placed after the DNFs but that isn't how things used to be done. DSQs usually occured due to technicalities like recieved unauthorised outside assistance as opposed to running an inelligible car. And many period sources list something like \"DNF\" with the reason given as \"Disqualified\" at least in certain circumstances. Anyway I think it's fine to do it here, but in general this isn't something which should be applied to all articles just based on the F1 website. A7V2 (talk)\n\nThe function of disqualification is you have been punished. Disqualified. Dis. You have been removed from the race entirely. Your lap times are not eligible for lap records or fastest lap points. When you are a DNF you at least had laps recorded. You can still get the lap record. You have made an honest attempt to race, or at least your level of dishonesty remains undiscovered. Disqualified goes at the end. Always. You got caught, you are removed from having participated. --Falcadore (talk)\n\nThe above was copy and pasted from Talk:1994 Belgian Grand Prix\n\n@Falcadore: \"Disqualified goes at the end. Always.\"\n\nI take it that this means all disqualified drivers? Both those who were disqualified after the race, for fuel irregularities or because their cars were underweight or whatever, and those who were disqualified during the race, because they reversed in the pits (like Nigel Mansell at the 1989 Portuguese GP) or had their car worked on in the pit lane (like Mansell at the 1991 Portuguese GP) or whatever? ChupoKlasky1991 (talk)\n\nThere are not degrees of disqualification - or to use the modern variation, exclusion. It is DSQ or EXC, not DSQ* or DSQ1 or DSQ-Post race, just DSQ. Do not look for distinctions or complications which do not exist. --Falcadore (talk)\n\nTables and table symbology should never be used to describe what should be in the race report prose. If you feel the standard terms of DNF, DSQ, EXC, DNS etc do not adequately describe events then the race report is at fault (presumably it is under-written), not the results tables. This is why INJ was removed from tables years ago as inappropriate. Sentences belong in the race reports, not the table. This also includes the increasing use of footnotes for tables. Tables summarise, they do not detail. --Falcadore (talk)\n\n@Falcadore: Maybe in more recent years but in the past this simply wasn't true. For example, Moss was disqualified from the 1959 French Grand Prix but did recieve one point for fastest lap. And in this particular article the current table has Moss after all the \"Ret\"s but I think should be placed above the DNFs (since none completed as many laps) but still below all classified finishers even though some completed fewer laps. A7V2 (talk)\n\n@Falcadore: No need to get shirty just because you disagree that there is any kind of distinction between disqualifications after the race and disqualifications during the race (though one thing we can agree on is that the latter are much rarer compared to the former).\n\nStill eager to hear what the likes of User:DH85868993 and User:GTHO think. This discussion could go on a while yet. ChupoKlasky1991 (talk)\n\nDo not confuse direct clear language with \"shirty\". Do not get unneccesarily emotional without any foundation for it. Stay on topic. --Falcadore (talk)\n\nMay I suggest A7V2 that comparing one race to another is only academic in nature as only the results of one race appear in each table. What happens in a race in 1959 compared to 1992 are not practically relevant as the two races do not appear in the same table. While I find the Moss example curious and contradictory to my language it doesn't contradict my point. DSQ is a penalty. DSQs at the end.\n\nI would further love to see if there is an actual distinction of when a disqualification or exclusion is applied (during vs after) as I have never previously seen any official distinction between the two other than timing. The effect has always been the same. If that is not the case curiosity compels me to want to read it. --Falcadore (talk)\n\nThere is no distinction between penalties applied during the race and after and you have to provided any evidence to suggest this may be the case. The fact that Moss was allowed to keep his fastest lap point has nothing to do with when he was disqualified but rather why.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@Falcadore: Well, if that's going to be your attitude, then maybe I'm just wasting my time taking part in this discussion.\n\nI absolutely respect other people's opinions, no matter how different they are from mine. I do not like it, though, when other people display snobby attitudes for no valid reason - and I like it even less when they also feel compelled to tell others what to do. What has happened to democracy and good old-fashioned respect in discussions? Have Facebook, Twitter and Br*x*t made it that acceptable to be disrespectful, snobby, mean and even nasty when disagreeing with others' opinions, anywhere?\n\nWell, I certainly did feel compelled to say that - I felt that this had become a situation where it had to be said. And it certainly is off-topic, but again, I felt that the situation called for it. And feel perfectly free to call it \"sloblock\", \"poppycock\", \"baloney\" or whatever, because I am leaving this discussion now and I am not going to read any future replies.\n\nUser:SSSB and User:FORMULA1FAN71, I guess you two are now perfectly free to group all disqualified drivers together, and to remove non-qualifiers and non-pre-qualifiers from race results tables. Just make sure to show respect towards those who don't agree with you, and to not be snobby or mean, or tell them what to do. :) ChupoKlasky1991 (talk)\n\nChupoKlasky1991, I ask specifically not to apply emotive judgements. If you feel I am being abrupt, I am not. I am trying to be clear. You say snobbish, I am not, I am trying to be specific. I ask again to not assume any form of emotion, including snobbery, as that is not my aim. I request you not get upset, it is not my intention to offend. I do not know how to make this clearer. I am trying to strip away any attitude from this. Please do not assume offence where none is offered. --Falcadore (talk)\n\n@Falcadore: My point was (and is) that up to the 60s or perhaps 70s the attitude was different since disqualifications were generally only for things which would only otherwise have been a retirement (ie recieving outside assistance meant that instead of retiring you keep on going), and often was only done to allow the driver to get back to pitlane rather than have to wait out on the circuit (and of course many of the regulations were set by the national governing bodies rather than the FIA/FISA/etc). I only made this comment when the discussion originally on the article talk page started moving towards making general statements about all races. I have no issues with placing DSQs after Rets in more recent races, just not for the older ones, and in particular I think the 1959 French GP example I gave should be changed but I decided not to change it straight away since this discussion was ongoing. A7V2 (talk)\n\n@A7V2:, so what you're saying is we should determine where we place DSQ's based on the reason for disqualification, or the year of the event. You want one rule for then and another for now because the attitude was different?\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB:I believe we shouldn't have consistency for consistency's sake. While modern sources may reflect current (for lack of a better word) \"attitudes\" towards disqualification in their results tables of older races, older sources do NOT do this as it simply isn't how results used to be reported. For example in Mike Lang's \"Grand Prix!\", the two drivers disqualified in the 1954 Argentine GP are just listed amoungst the retirements. For the 1959 French GP Moss is listed as the last (as in final) retirement with reason as \"disqualified\" by both Mike Lang and in David Hodge's \"French Grand Prix\" book. It's not about wanting one rule for then and one for now, it's about reflecting the way results were recorded at the time and not rewriting history because the way things were done in the 1950s was not the same as it was done in the 1990s or is done today. A7V2 (talk)\n\nSince no-one presented an objection I have made this change to 1959 French Grand Prix — Preceding unsigned comment added by A7V2 (talk • contribs)\n\nyou have to wait more than 2 days before declaring no objection. Any suggestion that history will be re-written is ludicrous. The results tables still show exactly the same information regardless of where it is listed. Also just because it was listed that way then doesn't mean it should be now. We don't have to present information in one way just because other sources do it in the same way. No matter where we put DSQ's the tables show the same data. There is therefore no reason that they shouldn't be consistent with each other.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: You have edited this page ~5-10 times since I originally replied to your comment which, I will add, did not give an actual objection, so I assumed you had lot interest. I wasn't aware that there was any kind of time limit for these kinds of things (I just assumed it was up to judgement) but I'll take it in good faith and not revert your revert. We don't have to present information in one way just because other sources do it in the same way - then why do we need to put DSQs after Rets now? Not because most sources do this? Any suggestion that history will be re-written is ludicrous - I'm not going to respond to such an obviously emotive statement and would kindly ask you to rephrase. I will say, however, that the reason it is akin to rewritting history as it gives the reader the impression that those who were disqualified are placed below those who retired, which at that time was not the case. And I know of no Wikipedia policy requiring consistency between articles. If such a policy did exist then why not have consistency between all motorsport articles rather than just F1 articles? A7V2 (talk)\n\nI hadn't lost interest, I was simply busy with the whole AUS GP mess and forgot. We would present DSQs after DNFs because I think its more logical. A DSQ and a DNF may be equivalent is some situations, but generally it isn't. it gives the reader the impression that those who were disqualified are placed below those who retired, I don't think it gives that impression at all. The only impression it gives is that Moss (using France '59) was disqualified and the others not. I think that you are looking too much into these tables if you think the order of disqualified and retired drivers. Where they appear on the table does not impact on the results the table shows.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nApologies for taking so long to contribute to this discussion. One reason the DNQs and DNPQs are listed at the bottom of the race results tables is that the pre-2006(?) race results tables were derived from the (old style) race result tables at www.formula1.com, and that's where they listed them. Now that many/most(?) of the race reports articles have qualifying and pre-qualifying tables, I don't really mind whether the DNQs and DNPQs are listed at the bottom of the race results tables or the (pre)qualifying tables, or both. One advantage of listing them in the race results table is that you can see every driver's result in the one table. With respect to DSQs, my personal preference would be to list the disqualified drivers where they originally finished in the race (but with \"DSQ\" in the \"Pos\" column, obviously), so that you can easily see where they originally finished. But I acknowledge that (almost?) no external sources present the information this way. Given that, I don't really mind whether the DSQs are listed before or after the DNFs. DH85868993 (talk)\n\n@SSSB: A DSQ and a DNF may be equivalent is some situations - as I've already said, this was generally always the case up to perhaps the 1960s. The number of laps recorded is generally how many the driver completed before they were disqualified since it was, in effect, the equivalent of a retirement. We would present DSQs after DNFs because I think its more logical. - I disagree that it's more logical. Would you also support placing NCs somewhere else, and not in amoungst the retirements? See for example Joe Kelly in 1950 British Grand Prix would finished but completed insufficient distance to be classified by the rules of the day. I think it's most logical to have all non-classified drivers/entrants who started the race be ordered based on the number of laps completed, at least up to/including the 1960s since, as I've already mentioned, that is how results were generally presented in those days.\n\n@DH85868993: TO be clear, in the example I gave before (1959 French GP) the reason I think Moss should be placed above the other Rets is because he completed more laps, not specifically because I think DSQs should go above Rets (I don't, I think they should be in order of laps completed). As far as showing where DSQs fit in assuming they weren't disqualified, you can't really do that for earlier races since they often reported the lap on which the driver was disqualified (since it was, in effect, a retirement) rather than how many they ended up completing. I don't know when this changed. A7V2 (talk)\n\nA7V2, firstly comparing NC's and DSQ's are like apples and oranges, The only offence NC's commited was being too slow. However, it appears that I'm alone on this so I'll drop '59 French (because it looks like a no concensus, I still disagree with you). How do you feel then about instances such as\n\n1994 Belgian Grand Prix where Schmacher got disqualified for worn skid blocks, not a situation where DSQ and DNF may be equivilant\n\n1989 Japanese Grand Prix which is outside of your pre-1960's window.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: Often the DSQs weren't due to any action on the part of the driver. For example, in the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix Brabham tried to tell the officials not to help him but they did, resulting in disqualification. But by my comparison I'd not meant that NC and DSQ are similar, more that DSQ and Ret are no more or less dissimilar than NC and Ret, the way things were done back then since effectively all three just mean \"not classified as a finisher\".\n\nI'm not going to get into the details of the 1989 Japanese GP decision, but there was a material difference between Senna and the Rets in that he/McLaren received (I believe) reduced or no prize money which would normally go to everyone. As for the 1994 Belgian GP, this is a good example of the difference between a \"modern\" disqualification and an \"old\" disqualification. In 1960 Monaco, Brabam completed more than 40 laps, but was only credited with 40 since that's when he recieved the outside assistance. In 1994 Schumacher completed all 44 laps but due to his disqualification he was effectively credited with zero. (In answer to your question I think in both the examples you give the DSQs should go AFTER the Rets, but I'm less sure about Senna than Schumacher).A7V2 (talk)\n\n@SSSB: I've made the edit again to the 1959 French Grand Prix. One thing I've noticed though, is if you look at the current Formula One website's results archives, in the 1959 French example [3] or 1960 Monaco [4] the disqualified driver is just placed in their place based on number of laps (with Moss actually ahead of some classified finishers). However for 1989 Japan [5] and 1994 Belgium [6] the disqualified driver is missing entirely from the table. I realise this would mean a LOT of work and at least some investigation of other sources (which I don't have time to do myself at the moment) but could it be that what we really need is something like \"Excluded\" for use when a driver is disqualified and it is interpreted as if they never even started the race as opposed to disqualification being seen as a kind of retirement? A7V2 (talk)\n\nWell, for starters we know that the results in f1.com's archives are by no means the way those results were officially declared or presented. Look at the source as archived in 1989 Japanese Grand Prix and compare it to how the archives show it now. Now personally I don't care if it says excluded or disqualified, it comes to the same thing. But another interesting case to point out is Hamilton in quali for 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, he is listed at the top despite being excluded. This reflects the cited sources but contradicts every other case of exclusion from quali i've ever seen (including an identical incident at the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix involving Vettel. Finally, if we are comparing other sources StatsF1 shows disqualifed drivers where they would have finished had they not been disqualied (take Japan 2019 for example where Renault drivers are listed as the 6th and 10th driver down but with DSQ next to thier names and all other numbers bumped up instead.) They have done the same with Japan '89 and belgium '94 where they display Senna and Schumacher at the top with DSQ next to thier name and then show Nannini and Hill below with a 1 next to their names. Different sources will always choose to display results tables differently. It's up to us to decide which system we think works best.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nHow to add calendar to season item and how to add entries, qualification and race results to GP item on Wikidata? Eurohunter (talk)\n\nJust a heads up that in my covid-19 related boredom I have created Draft:Aston Martin in Formula One in anticipation of it needing to be its own article after they join in 2021. Interested editors are invited to contribute.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nYesterday I removed several Grand Prix of that category because I thought that only races that NEVER belonged to the World Championship were included. I thought this because several cases are missing: Argentina (1971), Brazil (1972) and surely many others. --Adriel 00 (talk)\n\nThe category description says \"This category records Formula One events which have been run independent from the FIA World Championship at some point in their history.\" (my italics). I've added Argentine Grand Prix and Brazilian Grand Prix (and the corresponding categories) into the category. Feel free to add any others which are missing. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nAs it stands it's quite a confusing category having both subcategories and individual articles (some races only appearing as subcategories such as Caen Grand Prix and International Gold Cup and of course several which probably don't have their own category only appear in the list of pages). I think it would be easier to navigate if it only contained links to the main article (except for one-off races) since they generally all contain a link to every year's race anyway. A7V2 (talk)\n\nMy opinion: Add the individual races of Grand Prixs that were once part of the championship and Grand Prix articules in case they have NEVER been scored. --Adriel 00 (talk)\n\nI would not object to that suggestion. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nWe currently have some inconsistency regarding Pierluigi Martini's result at the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix:\n\n1995 Brazilian Grand Prix says \"DNS\"\n\nPierluigi Martini, 1995 Formula One World Championship, Minardi and Minardi M195 say \"Ret\"\n\nHere's what external sources have to say:\n\nFORIX (subscription site) says \"Not started\", StatsF1 says \"np\" (= DNS)\n\nformula1.com (archived version) says \"Ret\", formula1.com (current version) says \"NC/DNF\", grandprix.com says \"r\", Motor Sport says \"Rtd\", ChicaneF1 says \"ret\"\n\nFORIX says \"gearbox broken on the formation lap\". So what do we think - should we list his result as \"Ret\" or \"DNS\"? DH85868993 (talk)\n\nIn the prose of the article (last line of first paragraph of the subsection titled Race) it says (with sources) that Martini retired on the parade lap, giving two references (one is the year's Autocourse which I don't own myself) so I'd say definitely \"DNS\".A7V2 (talk)\n\nAlso Motorsport Magazine's database has DNS [7]. A7V2 (talk)\n\nMichael Schumacher at the 1996 French Grand Prix and Sebastian Vettel and Jolyon Palmer at the 2016 Bahrain Grand Prix got DNS's under similar circumstances.Tvx1\n\nIt looks like there's consensus for \"DNS\". If there are no objections within the next 24 hours, I'll update the affected articles. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nI've updated Pierluigi Martini, 1995 Formula One World Championship, Minardi, Minardi M195 and List of Formula One drivers and added the race to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One/Disputed_results#Other_disputed_results/information.

Is now the time to include a Free Practice results table to the event articles (such as the following, using the 2016 British Grand Prix as an example)?\n\nNo. Driver Constructor FP1 FP2 FP3 3 Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull–Renault 5th 1:32.773 2nd 1:32.051 3rd 1:31.488 5 Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 4th 1:32.501 4th 1:32.570 5th 1:32.049 6 Nico Rosberg Mercedes 2nd 1:31.687 – No time 2nd 1:30.967 7 Kimi Räikkönen Ferrari 6th 1:33.039 5th 1:32.736 9th 1:32.833 8 Romain Grosjean Haas–Ferrari 15th 1:34.547 8th 1:33.614 13th 1:33.344 9 Marcus Ericsson Sauber–Ferrari 20th 1:36.003 19th 1:34.722 21st 1:34.551 11 Sergio Pérez Force India–Mercedes 8th 1:33.235 16th 1:34.356 14th 1:33.361 12 Felipe Nasr Sauber–Ferrari 17th 1:34.805 14th 1:34.154 17th 1:33.710 14 Fernando Alonso McLaren–Honda 10th 1:33.527 6th 1:33.040 7th 1:32.754 19 Felipe Massa Williams–Mercedes 14th 1:34.456 10th 1:33.801 15th 1:33.440 20 Kevin Magnussen Renault — 20th 1:34.959 19th 1:34.049 21 Esteban Gutiérrez Haas–Ferrari — 12th 1:34.000 11th 1:32.895 22 Jenson Button McLaren–Honda 12th 1:34.132 9th 1:33.763 12th 1:33.042 26 Daniil Kvyat Toro Rosso–Ferrari 11th 1:33.738 13th 1:34.139 16th 1:33.538 27 Nico Hülkenberg Force India–Mercedes 3rd 1:32.492 15th 1:34.321 8th 1:32.798 30 Jolyon Palmer Renault 16th 1:34.787 18th 1:34.610 18th 1:33.769 33 Max Verstappen Red Bull–Renault 7th 1:33.202 3rd 1:32.286 4th 1:31.561 44 Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1st 1:31.654 1st 1:31.660 1st 1:30.904 45 Esteban Ocon Renault 19th 1:35.980 — — 50 Charles Leclerc Haas–Ferrari 18th 1:35.869 — — 55 Carlos Sainz, Jr. Toro Rosso–Ferrari 9th 1:33.446 11th 1:33.840 10th 1:32.889 77 Valtteri Bottas Williams–Mercedes 13th 1:34.263 7th 1:33.493 6th 1:32.736 88 Rio Haryanto Manor–Mercedes 22nd 1:36.647 21st 1:35.841 20th 1:34.471 94 Pascal Wehrlein Manor–Mercedes 21st 1:36.136 17th 1:34.549 22nd 1:34.658 Sources:[1][2][3]\n\nReferences\n\nAbsolutely not. We are not a repository of every bit of data. The359 (Talk)\n\nIf it were entirely up to me I would say yes, but I don't think free practice is notable enough to be included.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions)\n\nStrong oppose. Your opening sentenance says it all: statistics database. A statistics database is the only place such information belongs. However Wikipedia is not a stats database. We only need to mention the first few drivers in each session in prose and this is more than sufficent. No need for a large unwieldy table providing next to no useful information.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nIf we should a FP table, I would limit it to the top five per session, like they do on the Dutch wiki. However, I'm not convinced of the relevance as the teams are mostly focused on evaluating set-ups and strategies rather than purely on setting the quickest possible time.Tvx1\n\nWP:NOTSTATS springs to mind here, I don't think it adds value to most readers of F1 articles. Nobody watches the FP sessions because people don't care about them, and the times from them are meaningless- people use different tyres and fuel loads, so being first in free practice doesn't mean anything for qualifying and the race. Joseph2302 (talk)\n\nThere is an ongoing disussion at Talk:Fernando Alonso#Claim of often regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the history of the sport as to weather his article should claim that he is one of the greatest of all time. Interested editors are inivited to contribute.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nAn editor has posted a suggestion at Talk:Rudolf Krause that we expand the information we currently have on East German drivers. (I thought I would mention the suggestion here because I wasn't sure how many people would have Talk:Rudolf Krause on their watchlists). DH85868993 (talk)\n\nI've noticed a discrepancy between various sources on whether Fangio alone set fastest lap in the 1953 French GP, or if it was shared with Ascari. This has some fairly far reaching implications, since it affects the number of points Fangio scored in the championship (note that Ascari would still drop this round from his total even if awarded an extra half point). For that reason I'm bringing it to your attention as I'm not sure which way to go. See Talk:1953 French Grand Prix. Thanks. A7V2 (talk)\n\nAn editor had proposed that the article Death of Ronnie Peterson (Draft:Death of Ronnie Peterson) be created. Intereseted editors are invited to respond to the proposal at Talk:1978 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nNote: Yet another sock of Rowde; In fact three socks blocked today and the draft deleted. Eagleash (talk)\n\nIn answer to the actual question, I don't think separate article about his death is warranted, it can be covered sufficiently in his own article and the race article. Joseph2302 (talk)\n\n@Joseph2302: the proposal is being discussed at Talk:1978 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nHeads up for those with a long memory; the UK West Country IP-hopping disruptive editor (250+ addresses) eventually blocked as 'Rowde' has created yet another sock account here. The previous sock accounts have all been blocked but the one before this was declined by the blocking Admin. and had to wait until a different one spotted it. Been reported. Eagleash (talk)\n\n@Eagleash: just to point out: \"IP-hopping\" is not something that editors using dynamic IP addresses have any control over. It could be that each time they connect to the internet they receive a different IP address from their ISP. Also, Wikipedia welcomes IP editors as much as any other editor. So it, in itself, changing IP addresses is neither a sign of disruption nor of socking. That isn't to say there aren't other signs though. So \"IP-hopping\" or \"IP hopper\" shouldn't be used as a pejorative when referring to a Wikipedia editor. -- DeFacto (talk).\n\nWell true up to a point but there comes a time when constantly changing IPs becomes a disruption in itself – it makes it very difficult to communicate with the editor effectively for example. Or as another F1 regular put it when you get a disruptive editor \"you can't keep up with them\". As I recall you were the only editor who tried to defend this guy back in 2016. See this archived thread. Eagleash (talk)\n\nThe point is that the frequency of change of their IP address is not under the control of the editor, it is controlled by the system their ISP uses. So we can't blame the editor for that. -- DeFacto (talk).\n\nThe term was used to remind people of who we are dealing with here. It's not pejorative, that is what you inferred; it is a fact. Eagleash (talk)\n\n@Eagleash: so when you say \"changing IPs becomes a disruption in itself\", what would you recommend users do, if, for whatever reason, they do not want to register, but whose ISP only provide dynamic IP addresses? -- DeFacto (talk).\n\nBut this user did register. Multiples times even, in an abusive sockpuppeting manner. A user who was blocked indenfinetly should not edit Wikipedia at all. Not with other new accounts, not while logged out.Tvx1\n\nI don't know whether they were doing whatever they did, abusively, or not. But that wasn't my point. What I'm saying is that we shouldn't conflate abusive editing and the switching of IP-addresses. -- DeFacto (talk).\n\nThere is nothing wrong with editing constructively with a different IP each time if that's how their ISP operates. It is wrong to use it to intentionally deceive, disrupt or evade blocks.\n\nAdditionally, it adds some difficulty in stopping the disruption. However, we should put this into perspective. There are very many disruptive editors active at any given time and the vast majority are dealt with effectively (in large part thanks to notices like this thread). Usually they show patterns which identify themselves. But, if an IP-hopping vandal jumps to a different target each time and shows no patterns, then each IP would simply appear as another disruptive editor among the many others also active at the time. But it's still just one person, and there is only so much one individual can do to move the needle on the total volume of disruption, regardless of the number IPs or accounts they are using. --DB1729 (talk)\n\nI notice the recent creation of the following \"timeline\" templates:\n\nTemplate:Formula One tyre supplier timeline (1950-1989)\n\nTemplate:Formula One tyre supplier timeline (1990-present)\n\nTemplate:Formula One constructor timeline (1950-1979)\n\nTemplate:Formula One constructor timeline (1980-present)\n\nTemplate:Formula One circuit timeline (1950-1969)\n\nTemplate:Formula One circuit timeline (1970-1989)\n\nTemplate:Formula One circuit timeline (1990-2009)\n\nTemplate:Formula One circuit timeline (2010-present)\n\nDo we think these templates are useful? I thought I would ask, so that if consensus is that they're not useful, we can avoid wasting effort adding them to and then removing them from articles. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nThey really do look.... not nice. And I'm not sure how appropriate it is to include the current F1 logo on the older templates (or at all frankly) given that F1 as an entity didn't even exist until at least 1981. Maybe the tyre supplier ones could be modified a bit to look nice and be useful but I really don't think the other ones are going to be useful to anyone since they are so cluttered. And don't they duplicated information which can easily be found elsewhere? A7V2 (talk)\n\nAgreed. I'll also add that the majority of these templates are too wide, for some of them only half the template (or less) fits on my laptop screen. The need to be split more than they already are. I think the only way that these could be useful is if you want to see which construcotrs were involved in the 80's (for example). Personally I don't see the benefit of these templates even if we ignore the wide range of issues I have with the formatting and timeframe (which I have only touched upon)\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nWe already have categories and lists for constructors (Category:Formula One constructors and List of Formula One constructors) and circuits (Category:Formula One circuits and List of Formula One circuits). I cannot see how these navboxes/timelines help it. As for tyre suppliers, a category could be created for that. – Sabbatino (talk)\n\nI agree that categories are better- those templates are pretty confusing (especially the constructor ones which have loads of UK teams and so are long). Joseph2302 (talk)\n\nGood points. I'll clean up the tyre supplier ones today and tomorrow, but the others are subject to whatever y'all see fit, be it deletion or splitting or whatever. Quattrovalvole (u/t, s s/t) 12:02, 14 May 2020 (UTC) (Update - the tire supplier ones have been fixed. Might fix the others, but their fate is ultimately up to y'all. Quattrovalvole (u/t, s s/t) 18:00, 14 May 2020 (UTC)) (Oh yeah - I made a tire supplier category too. Quattrovalvole (u/t, s s/t) )\n\nI really can’t see the purpose of these. I believe deletion is the only sensible option.Tvx1\n\nThe tyre supplier timeline is the only of the above templates that I would deem usable on an article. The others are wildly impractical. If no use can be found for them, then deletion would be sensible.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions)\n\nWhy is it important to sort tyre and constructor by nationality? It obscures usability. To find a company quickly it requires you to know the nationality. Nationality is also not a defining characteristic and it is not a characteristic at all of tyre makers. There is no pointscore for them anymore than there is a prize for brake discs or engine computers, radiators or any other component of the car. Not even for engine suppliers! Sorted by alphabetical spelling is much more suitable. --Falcadore (talk)\n\nI can't make head nor tail of the logic of these. They are unwieldy and confusing. They don't really have any intrinsic value. I think deleting is the only viable endpoint, they don't seem to have a purpose. Sparkle1 (talk)\n\nWhy are there currently five different F1 driver results legends and one redirect?\n\nRedirect\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 2\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 3\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 4\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 5\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 6\n\n--Sparkle1 (talk)\n\nThey are all variations used for different sorts of articles with different needs. The first one is a redirect because it would be otherwise identical to Template:Motorsports driver results legend — Preceding unsigned comment added by Tvx1 (talk • contribs)\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend is a redirect to Template:Motorsport driver results legend. If I recall correctly, the template started life as Template:F1 driver results legend, but then people started using it for the results tables for other racing categories, so it was moved to the more general name.\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 2 is for use with Formula One World Championship results tables, where pole position and fastest lap are indicated by bold and italics respectively (see Note)\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 3 is for use with non-championship Formula One results tables, where pole position and fastest lap are indicated by bold and italics respectively (see Note). It differs from Template:F1 driver results legend 2 in that green means \"other top 6 position\" rather than \"other points position\" (since references to \"points\" don't make sense for non-championship races) and omits expansions for \"WDC\" and \"WCC\" which also aren't applicable for non-championship races\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 4 is for use in season summary articles, where pole position and fastest lap are indicated by bold and italics respectively (see Note). I can't remember why we started using a different legend for the season summary articles.\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 5 is for use with Formula One World Championship results tables, where pole position and fastest lap are indicated by \"P\" and \"F\" respectively (see Note)\n\nTemplate:F1 driver results legend 6 is for use in season summary articles, where pole position and fastest lap are indicated by \"P\" and \"F\" respectively (see Note)\n\nNote: Originally/for a long time pole position and fastest lap were indicated by bold and italics respectively. Recently there has been a change to indicate pole position and fastest lap by \"P\" and \"F\" respectively. But some tables still use the \"bold and italic\" format.\n\nDH85868993 (talk)\n\nOk that confusing as all giddy-up. So why is there not a consolidated single template? This would make understanding a lot easier to someone who is not an expert on the subject. Sparkle1 (talk)\n\nBecause different results tables use the same colour to mean different things and/or indicate pole position and fastest lap in different ways. For example, in Graham_Hill#Complete_Formula_One_World_Championship_results, a green background means \"other points position\" (i.e. other than 1st, 2nd or 3rd). But in Graham_Hill#Complete_Formula_One_Non-Championship_results, a green background means \"other top 6 position\" (i.e. other than 1st, 2nd or 3rd), because there is no such thing as a \"points position\" in a non-championship race. So the two tables need different legends. Likewise, in Graham_Hill#Complete_Formula_One_World_Championship_results, pole position is indicated by the race abbreviation being bold. But in 2019_Formula_One_World_Championship#World_Drivers'_Championship_standings, pole position is indicated by a superscript \"P\". So the two tables need different legends. Admittedly, if we ever get to the situation where all the F1 results tables use \"P\" and \"F\" to indicate pole position and fastest lap, we could possibly retire Template:F1 driver results legend 2 and Template:F1 driver results legend 4. And maybe it would have been a good idea if we'd picked a different colours for \"other points position\" in Championship results tables and \"other top 6 position\" in non-Championship results tables, but we didn't. Plus I think there's an argument that it makes more sense to have a separate legend for non-championship races, which omits elements which aren't applicable to non-championship races such as \"WCC\", \"WDC\" and \"Friday test driver (2003 onwards)\". DH85868993 (talk)\n\nThe reason why we started using legend 4, is because legends two and three include some information (e.g. Free Practice Driver (TD)) that are only used in individual article like those of drivers. Because this led to frequent discussion as to why some code weren't used in the result matrices of season articles, legend 4 was created as a dedicated legend for season articles.Tvx1\n\nAn article on 2020 Formula One pre-season testing was recently created and has been nominated for deletion. You are welcome to contribute to the discussion here.Tvx1\n\nMercedes have recently adopted the habit of having lengthy names for their chassis. Where McLaren, for example, are entering the McLaren MCL35 in 2020, Mercedes are entering the Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance. However, outside the official launch, I have never actually seen or heard the car referred to by its full name. Most of the time it's just the \"F1 W11\". This is not the only car that this has happened with; in this article, the Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+ is just referred to as the \"F1 W09\". As such, I'm wondering what the best way to handle this is. Chassis names don't get mentioned much outside their individual articles, but when they do—such as in championship articles—I think the shorter version should be used. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nAgree, if I don't google for it I don't think I even find a mention of W11 in any article, let alone the whole thing. It may even be worth considering a WP:RM. To a commonly used (the shorter) name.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: I would even say the same goes for engine designations. Mercedes' current engine is officially known as the \"Mercedes-AMG F1 M11 EQ Performance\" and I couldn't tell you what anything after the F1 means. The other engine suppliers just name theirs sequentially. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nAgreed, unfortunately previous (recent) discussions don't. Incidentally the Mercedes engine name uses the same naming convention (as far as I can tell) as the car but with M instead of W.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@Mclarenfan17: The only source I know of is 2019-20 Autocourse (I don't have any other recent years) which has Mercedes-AMG F1 W10-F1 M10 EQ Power+ V6 in every results table, so definitely the redundant marketing nonsense could be removed if next to no sources use it. I tend to side with Stirling Moss' view anyway, that \"no-one used (model names)\", and it seems a lot of sources agree with this, often referring to just Mercedes' \"2020 car\". @SSSB: The tradition dates back to at least the W25 where usually the numbers lined up (but not always), with W standing for Wagen, M standing for Motor. A7V2 (talk)\n\n@A7V2: this issue has come up before and it was rejected. I don't really see the point of including the full engine designation in championship articles—car and engine manufacturer articles are another matter—unless the engine itself notable enough to warrant its own article, such as the Cosworth DFV. That said, discussing this is not really what I had intended when I started this section. I am, however, wondering if there is something we can do: if we shorten the \"F1 W11 EQ Performance\" to \"F1 W11\" in some articles, then perhaps we can also shorten the \"Mercedes-AMG F1 M11 EQ Performance\" to \"Mercedes F1 M11\". Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nAlso, thank you for pointing out the reason for Mercedes' naming convention. I'm glad it's not all marketing junk. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nAfter long discussion in the German motorsport portal (Link to discussion (German)) we've an aligned decison:\n\nThe picture will not used further more in the German Wikipedia! This picture has been retouched to the point where it is not clear if it actually represents what it claims to represent. regards --Pitlane02 🏁 talk\n\nAt the moment I'm wondering about the missing feedbacks and maybe my explanations (and my English) is not good enough. We've discussed, is that file a fake or not, and this point is crucial for each other wiki project... Regards --Pitlane02 🏁 talk\n\nAn editor has proposed that Formula One be moved to Formula 1. Interested editors are welcome to join the discussion at Talk:Formula One.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nThis was closed as not moved but another editor has now opened an RfC on the subject (same location).\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nThe RfC is entirely justified. For one, moving the article would have a significant impact on the WikiProject. Considering that an RM discussion is only open for a week—and the RM discussion was closed just as editors started debating it—an RfC reaches a wider audience and gives editors more time to discuss it. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\n@Mclarenfan17:, I think you are reading too much into my comment. I only meant to update this thread with the latest happenings. I wasn't suggesting that the RfC was unjustified.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\n@SSSB: that wasn't aimed specifically at you. It was more for people wondering why an RfC was opened if the RM was only recently closed. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nNear the end of last year a short discussion took place regarding redesigning some results matrices. It's unclear whether some consensus was reached, but the proposed new format was implemented on the 2020 season's car articles (e.g. [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McLaren_MCL35&oldid=934824678 McLaren]). With the new season about to finally start I think we should matter first. I think there a more option, like making the too wide tables scrollable that weren't considered back then.Tvx1\n\nSomeone has created an article about pre-season testing in 2020, which I have nominated for deletion (again ... surprised it didn't get deleted the first time). I think we need to be vigilant about this, because details of pre-season and rookie tests have found their way into Formula E articles where there seems to be more in the article about testing than there is about actual racing. It seems the creator(s) of this article have assumed that if something happened, it's automatically notable enough for a Wikipedia article. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nIt had an AfD a few weeks back which had no consensus. Views of long standing F1 editors would be appreciated. Joseph2302 (talk)\n\nTesting this season after the imposed gap may be more significant than usual. I'm not bothered so let's see how it goes. Britmax (talk)\n\nMercedes have already announced that they are taking a raft of updates to Austria. The car they compete with will be significantly different to the one they tested with, making testing irrelevant. Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nI hate to break it to you and risk wandering into forum territory, but the role of the Maclaren team as the sole arbiter of what is relevant in Formula One is currently at a bit of a nadir. Britmax (talk)\n\n... huh? Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nHah! Interesting error on my part there. Still only the one team though. let's see what turns up. Britmax (talk)\n\nClosed. At WP:AN now.Tvx1\n\nI've started a discussion at Talk:70th Anniversary Grand Prix about if the Grand Prix name (i.e. what is listed in List of Formula One Grand Prix) should be 70th Anniversary Grand Prix or Anniversary Grand Prix. Interested editors are welcome to contribute there. Thank you,\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nWould somebody mind taking a look at 70th Anniversary Grand Prix, please? There's a small issue with the infobox that I don't know how to fix. The heading of the infobox reads \"2020 70th Anniversary Grand Prix\", but the way the article is written (and indeed some of the discussion on the 2020 talk page) suggests that the title should be \"70th Anniversary Grand Prix\". In other words, if the race were to be run in 2021 it would be \"71st Anniversary Grand Prix\", not \"2021 70th Anniversary Grand Prix\". Mclarenfan17 (talk)\n\nI've removed the incorrect \"2020\" by depopulating the \"Year\" field. The cost is that we also have to lose the \"Race x of y\" line. But I don't think it's worth changing the template just to accommodate this one race, noting that there are plenty of other races which don't have the \"Race x of y\" line in the infobox. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nI was about to do the same change as User:DH85868993 did (I got an edit conflict). I think it's a good enough solution. A7V2 (talk)\n\nI've just had a look at the documentation (Template:Infobox Grand Prix race report) to see if there was an obvious solution, and it's interesting to note that the \"Date\" is apparently depreciated in favour of \"Fulldate\", and that per a discussion in 2017 the \"season number\" and \"race number\" fields shouldn't be used anyway, but also that there's so disagreement about it so it should be left \"until a final resolution on the subject is reached.\" A7V2 (talk)\n\nI wonder wether it's really that much trouble to make the year appearing in front of the name optional (i.e. that it only appears there if the nameyear parameter is present and populated.Tvx1\n\nIf you mean \"i.e. that it only appears there if the Year parameter is present and populated\", then that's how the template currently works. The problem is that \"Race X of Y in the YYYY Formula One World Championship\" line also uses the Year parameter, so if you omit the Year parameter but populate the Race_No and Season_No parameters, then the infobox displays \"Race X of Y in the Expression error: Unexpected > operator\". DH85868993 (talk)\n\nNo that's not what I meant. Obviously that's NOT how the infobox currently works. Currently, the year parameter is mandatory and its absence generates an error message. But we can also make the parameter optional, which means its absence does not cause an error.Tvx1\n\nI figured it out, it can be done using \"CUST\" as the type instead of \"F1\" then typing the \"Race 5 of...\" bit directly. A7V2 (talk)\n\nNice work. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nWell this has become more confusing now since the race is actually using 2020 in its nameTvx1\n\nYes, but this isn't reflected in the article title. The article title and the infobox should really match.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nWe can easily change that though.Tvx1\n\nHow come, in Grands Prix where one or more drivers failed to qualify and thus did not take part in the actual race (the few cases where such drivers were given permission to take part notwithstanding), these drivers are present in some of the corresponding race result tables, but not in others? And how come there's objection when they're removed from these tables, *and* objection when they're put back?\n\nFor that matter, how come these drivers' position numbers in qualifying are displayed beside their names in some of the corresponding qualifying result tables, while in others \"DNQ\" is displayed beside their names? And again, how come there's objection when the position numbers are replaced with \"DNQ\"s, *and* objection when \"DNQ\"s are replaced with the position numbers?\n\nWe have to agree on a single standard here, folks. Either *all* the GPs in which drivers failed to qualify and thus didn't take part in the actual race include these drivers in the corresponding race result tables, or they *all* exclude them. And either *all* these GPs display the position numbers beside the names of these drivers in the corresponding qualifying result tables, or they *all* display \"DNQ\" beside their names. 80.233.42.141 (talk)\n\nI agree we should bring some consistency in this. I feel the DNQ and DNPQ drivers should not be included in the race results tables. And in the qualifying tables they should not get a position number, since the FIA themselves do not credit them with one. Note though that some of our older race reports do not include a qualifying results table (yet). In such cases it makes sense to list these drivers in the race results tables until a qualifying table is added.Tvx1\n\nI agree that DNQ/DNPQ cars should only appear in the results table in the absence of a qualifying table. I understand the reasoning for keeping it as DNQ instead of position numbers for qualifying but it's worth remembering that the FIA \"official\" results, especially for pre 1981, is not necessarily the actual official/correct result, and also in some older races drivers didn't necessarily start the race in the correct order, and sometimes cars which DNQed were allowed to start the race anyway (and not just because someone ahead couldn't start). I think it would be better to keep the position, maybe in brackets, or maybe put the DNQs in italics or something like that. A7V2 (talk)\n\nThe fact that sometimes they didn't start in their qualifying order is actually a reason why we shouldn't give these DNQ or DNQ drivers positions in the qualifying tables. The simply didn't have one. And with regards to \"official\" results I think you are mixing the F1 site's results archive with the FIA. They are not the same at all. The F1 archive has the occasional error, but if you encounter a contemporary FIA document it most certainly will be correct.Tvx1\n\nThe positions in the qualifying tables should show the order of lap times, nothing else. There's usually a separate column for grid position (in the race result table) and of course prose or notes can be used to clear up any inconsistencies. Not sure what you mean by \"contemporary FIA document\" since races were originally organised and regulated by the national clubs (with increasing oversight and standardisation by the FIA through the 70s of course), the only time the FIA would issue an \"official\" result was if they had to rule on a protest. A7V2 (talk)\n\nI was editing Gilby Engineering and noticed that all the cars were listed with separate links for manufacturer and model, i.e: Cooper T45 rather than just Cooper T45. I was going to combine them all as this seemed erroneous, but perhaps that is how things are supposed to be done? Is there a rule for this? At Tyrrell Grand Prix results, both methods are used which is giving me a headache. Thank you, Mr.choppers | ✎\n\nIn a driver results table, the convention is to link the manufacturer and model separately, e.g. Cooper T45, per the 5th bullet point under Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One/Tables#Driver_results_table. The sample constructor/team results table at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One/Tables#Constructor/Team_results_table, contains direct links to the models, e.g. Jordan EJ13, but this is not explicitly specified in a footnote. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nUgh, I don't like it, but I restored the content accordingly. Best, Mr.choppers | ✎\n\n@Mr.choppers: I was suggesting that the results table at Gilby Engineering, being a constructor/team results table, should have (for example), links to Maserati 250F, per the sample constructor/team results table, not separate links to \"Maserati\" and \"250F\" as would be found in a driver results table. Sorry if my previous comment didn't make that clear. I've updated the table accordingly. DH85868993 (talk)\n\n@DH85868993: that's much nicer, great. Mr.choppers | ✎\n\nThere is a move discussion at 70th Anniversary Grand Prix. This is different to the previous discussion which was regarding the inclusion of \"70th\" in the article name. I invite interested editors to participate in the discussion there. Thanks. A7V2 (talk)\n\nI will always keep admire Template:F1stat. And I think it is time to think about a new step to the simpler updates of the results tables.\n\nWe update the same info about the result of one driver at least in the four similar tables (we probably can find a way for a driver table).\n\nSo my proposal is to keep all the season result data in one template. There are my first concept of the template and demonstration of how it actually works.\n\nI believe that if we store information about one season in the template, it will be good not only for the current season, but for all previous. Because it will be easier to monitor the changes for data in one template, than in four articles.\n\nHope to hear about disadvantages of my proposal and/or something about how to make my code for the template clearer and easier. If community will be satisfied with the proposal and the code in the current state I will extend the data for all 2020 drivers and create the template. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nI like this idea. Some comments/questions:\n\nCan it/does it work when the value in the template has not yet been populated? i.e. at the start of the season, could we populate all the results tables with appropriate references to the template (which at that time would appear blank) and then after each race just update the template and have the results \"automagically\" appear in all the tables? (If this doesn't currently work, I'm sure we should be able to make it work). Obviously 2020 is a bit of a weird season in that the calendar has changed multiple times; I'm more thinking of a \"normal\" season where the calendar is set at the start of the season and doesn't change.\n\nI'm in two minds about whether it's better to have lots of simple templates (e.g. F1-1, F1-2, F1-3, etc) for the different race positions, or to have a single \"smart\" template which works out the background colour based on a \"race result\" parameter. Obviously the former arrangement is simpler but more of a maintenance burden. I might have a go at trying to write a \"smart\" template.\n\nIt would need to support the \"dagger\" (for classified but did not finish), but I think this should just be as simple as adding the dagger after the call to the lower-level template.\n\nThere are very rare occasions where the standard background colours aren't used, e.g. if a driver finishes 4th but is awarded no points, but we could always just not use the template in those instances.\n\nIt would be good if it worked for \"DSQ\" (where the text is a non-standard colour), but if that ends up being too hard, we could just not use the template in those instances.\n\nWe'd need to make sure that the template substitutes properly at the end of the season, but that's just a technical issue. I remember when we substituted {{F1stat}} at the the end of the first season - rather than just inserting numbers like \"3\", it inserted the whole template code!\n\nDH85868993 (talk)\n\nThank you for your quick and detailed feedback! Yes, it can work without populated value, and we can fill all at the start of the season, but I had to remove the first \"|\" from the F1-1 and similar templates to make empty cells possible.\n\nI agree that one single \"smart\" template will be much better, but I haven't find any working examples for table cells at first. I will try to work with Template:Coltit for the solution.\n\nI will think about what to do with different point systems and non-standard bgcolors, probably your proposal is the easiest solution.\n\nIt work with DSQ and dagger, exactly like with Template:F1 race position. I have updated my demonstration page. To show this.\n\nAs I said previously part of my proposal is to avoid substition at the end of season at all, and use these even for the previous seasons to take away the neccesity of checking that in all tables the same result after somebody's edit. Also it will decrease the level of test and vandal edits in the tables. Other words, I propose to copy the approach of the Template:F1Laps2020 and create templates for every single season. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nP.S.I have changed my single templates to Coltit. It works beautiful, and doesn't require additional template for bgcolor, and now we don't have problems with different point systems and can choose any bgcolor. We almost ready to start to make complete 2020 template. I think that we should also think about how make it work in the driver articles. Via template I was able only to make it upside down, result and link to the GP below. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nI notice on the demonstration page that when you hover over a cell, it produces a tooltip of the colour value (e.g. \"colour FFFFBF\"). I think this is probably undesirable, but that it can be turned off by adding \"|x=\" to the end of the calls to {{Coltit}}. Apart from that, I think the updated template and demonstration page look good. I'm not entirely convinced about the idea of having templates for previous seasons though:\n\nBecause we rarely need to update the results for previous seasons, it seems to me like a lot of effort for comparatively little benefit, i.e. compared to a template for the current season which means that after each race, we only need to update each driver's result in one place rather than 4.\n\nPerhaps more of a concern is whether we might hit template transclusion limits in large team results pages, e.g. McLaren Grand Prix results or (especially) Ferrari Grand Prix results. I'd suggest setting up a copy of your template with 20 race results for each of 20 drivers (since we're only testing transclusion limits, they could all be the same result if you like, so it could all be \"copy and paste\", but maybe use {{F1 race position|10|f|p}}† as the result, as a \"worst case scenario\"), then doing up a test version of Ferrari Grand Prix results with 2120 (= number of individual Ferrari race entries to date) calls to the template (again, since we're just testing transclusion limits, you could just have 53 repeats of the same season of 2 drivers x 20 races). Then double that to simulate the \"Ferrari as an engine supplier\" and \"non-championship results\" tables and a bit of future expansion. If you hit the template transclusion limit you'll know because the bottom of the page won't render properly.\n\nHaving said all that, if there are no issues with template transclusions, and you're happy to put in the effort to do templates for previous seasons, I have no objection to them. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nThanks for your great help with this and noticinig things which I have missed, really appreciate it. I fixed the tooltip issue. And you convinced me to wait and think more about neccesity of adding it to the previous seasons. We can at least wait and see how will work 2020 template. Certanly we should substitute the template at the end of the season in team and engine suppliers articles due to transclusion limits (I have a test and reached the limit, as you said), but I think we don't have neccesity to substitute it in season and chassis article and we can start new template for 2021 season just like with F1laps. I will work on template documentation and then I will add to 2020 season article and 2020 chassis articles.\n\nMy proposal for the update algorythm in the drivers' standings is to add f1stat template to the points section, and after the update of the f1 stat and our new template just to copy the driver row to the his current actual position. Using F1stat for the current position wouldn't add much help as it will still require to switch factual location of the rows. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nYou know, I've been thinking a lot about or tables and I have been wondering for while wether it wouldn't be a good idea to start using Modules. Modules are far superior to the basic templates we still use an can easily be programmed to automatically perform a myriad of function like for instance adding a specific background color based on the entered value. It's even possible to allow an optional parameter to override the automatically generated color if desired. Other sports Wikiprojects like WP:FOOTY use them extensively and I think we can benefit from them. Module:Sports rbr table actually has functionality that comes close to what we would need.Tvx1\n\nI'm certainly like it more than the template as it will also reduce template transclusions, but Module:Sports rbr table doesn't work with Template:F1 race position and even with bold and italics. It will be great if somebody has an ability to write a module for motorsport tables. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nOf course that module is not at present compatible with our needs. But it does quite clearly show a lot of the functionality that we desire. So it could be used as a basis to write a F1 (or even motorsports) module or we could request one be written from the ground up here.Tvx1\n\nWe may save some width if we decide to use this option. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nI'm not opposed to this idea in general, but I have a few questions/comments:\n\nHow would you handle a mid-season team change, such as we had with Albon and Gasly last year? Obviously we could just list both entrants/chassis/engines in the \"entrant/chsssis/engine\" line, but I think many readers would be keen for the table to show which races the driver drove for each team.\n\nThe formatting looks quite nice in the sample table, but I'm wondering how it will work with longer entrant/chassis/engine names, e.g. \"Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team\", Mercedes AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance\", \"Mercedes M11 EQ Performance 1.6 V6 t\", as in the \"2020\" row of Lewis Hamilton's results table. To partially answer my own question, I tried previewing these names in the sample table and (unsurprisingly) it just made the first 14 columns wider, but I guess this could be overcome by either inserting judicious line breaks in the entrant/chassis/engine names, or perhaps by specifying a fixed width for the table, so that the names wrap automatically?\n\nDo you propose to continue colour-coding the WDC and Points cells for the top three positions, as we currently do? The current location of these cells, at the extreme right of the table, makes it very easy to quickly see where a driver finished in the championship, e.g. if I look at the right-hand columns of Lewis_Hamilton#Complete_Formula_One_results, for the last 7 rows, I see \"gold, gold, silver, gold, gold, gold, gold\" which instantly tells me he finished \"1st, 1st, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st\" in the last 7 championships. In the revised format, that information is still there, but it's buried in between (coloured) race result cells, so it may not be as easy to see at a glance.\n\nIf we decided to update all the driver result tables to the new format, that's over 700 tables to update, so if the benefit is only marginal, then it may not be worth the effort.\n\nDH85868993 (talk)\n\nYeah, you are right the first proposal creates more problems than it solves. So I have a new proposal to use id links to have links for both racing record and results table. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nI like the link from the Career Summary table to the detailed results table. I'm not so sure about the \"pared back\" detailed results table though. I think most readers would still want to see at least the entrant and WDC position/points columns in the detailed results table. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nSomething like this? I have moved the link from extra column to the \"Races\" column. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nThis is unnecessarily convoluting a already effective system, and, as DH85868993 has mentioned, the benefit (and I would dispute there is any) is marginal compared to difficulty of implementation. These proposals make the results, especially over time, much more difficult to follow (both visually and navigation wise), and the only discernible benefit is less horizontal scrolling. I don't see any added usability from this.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions)\n\nHave you seen the last proposal? The first two not on the table anymore (but probably the first one will be good for the chassis as their usage lasts just one season), or you consider this as a better idea?). In general, there are two questions: 1. Why do you oppose an opportunity for quick jump from the racing record table to the relevant line in the result matrix? 2. Are we really need chassis and engine info in the result matrix? Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nI have looked at all the proposals you've posted here, but I take issue with the difficulty in scanning through results and comparing them year by year. The table implemented at the start of this year on the vehicle pages were very effective and I'm a fan of them, but they don't work on driver/team pages for the same reason - it makes scanning through results over years exceptionally difficult.\n\nThis test is, in my opinion, the best of your proposals so far. But, as I mentioned in my first reply, I just don't see the advantage of this change. Horizontal scrolling isn't that big of deal, and the loss of easy visual navigation (one row per year, entry on the left, results through the middle, standings on the right) just to reduce page width doesn't sound compelling to me.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions)\n\nWhy is vehicle info is neccesary in the driver result matrix? The main purpose of the table is to give a quick detalisation of results. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nThat vehicle information is important for both context of both results and entry, particularly in early years when it was common for a driver or team to use multiple vehicles in a single season. Seeing what vehicle/driver pairings achieved what results is pretty significant for the reader to properly understand what they're seeing. That's completely lost in this system.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions) 11:32, 24 July 2020 (UT\n\nOk, understood, would not push this idea. Though certain that it will not hurt nobody if we introduce scheme with id link from races in racing record to the result matrix with keeping the current format. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nMight I remind all of you that Wikipedia possesses many technologies at present, like one that can make this tables scrollable?Tvx1\n\nIf I'm understanding that documentation correctly, the table is limited to 30 rows. That would be fine for all driver/vehicle articles (assuming they aren't prolific team switchers) but probably wouldn't work in engine manufacturer/team results.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions)\n\nPer the documentation, extra rows beyond 30 can be added.Tvx1\n\nI don't oppose the link to jump from career summary to results, but I do oppose any changes to the results table itself.\n\n5225C (talk • contributions)\n\nWith Imola having been announced as a returning venue for the 2020 championship, I have been reading through our article on the circuit. I noticed that our coverage of its early existence is quite poor and even at some spots incorrect. We apparently have no maps depicting its early configurations on Wikimedia. The infobox incorrectly list the version of the circuit used for its inaugural formula one world championship race (in 1980) as the \"original configuration\". That is quite incorrect. The circuit has existed since the fifties and its original layout was quite different to the one used in 1980 as well as to later revisions. The circuit has even been used for formula one races, albeit non championship ones, before 1980. A full chronology of all the different layouts can be found for instance here.Tvx1\n\nIn the \"Next_year's_race\" section for the race report template should \"None\" or \"TBD\" be used when another race hasn't been held? I think it's best to be consistent here. \"None\" is the text currently in use the most with older Grand Prix entires. I personally don't find that \"None\" means that no race will ever be held there again but I'd like to get a consensus on this. FozzieHey (talk)\n\nTBD - firstly I had every intention to apply it across all relevant article. Anyway, to me \"none\" has an implication of finality behind it (I.e. it implies there won't ever be another one)\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nI'd rather discuss it here before we change it across all articles to get a consensus, I think it'd be better for a bot to do this if we did get a consensus to change? FozzieHey (talk)\n\nThat's fine. I was simply pointing out that I had no intention of keeping it inconsistent.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nDepends on the situation - TBD implies that some sort of effort is taking place to host another race in the near future or that an agreement exist, but it hasn't been confirmed when the next race is expected to be. In case like for instance the Pacific Grand Prix using TBD is just nonsensical. In such a case using none is better. I don't think this has an implication of finality, but only states that no subsequent edition of that race is scheduled to happen in near future.Tvx1\n\nI have recently added the 1953 French Grand Prix fastest lap discrepancy to Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One/Disputed results and noticed that many of the other disputed results were not discussed on the article talk pages for the particular race (instead either not discussed, or discussed on this page). Given also that the disputed results page is quite hard to find (it's more than one click away from the main wikiproject page for example) I think it would be useful to have some kind of note (perhaps in the form of a template) to put at the top of the relevant article talk pages linking both to the disputed results page and a link to any relevant discussion establishing the consensus interpretation of the sources, but I'm interested in others' views. Thanks. A7V2 (talk)\n\nI think that's a good idea. Whether we use a template, or just come up with a standardised wording/format, I'm not especially fussed. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nSupport your idea. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nDefinitely support.\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nSeems sensible to me. Good idea to direct them to the disputed results page. Joseph2302 (talk)\n\nPotential wording(s)\n\nI'm not sure of the exact wording, but here are two suggestions (one where there was a discussion, one where there was not): Eg for van der Lof at 1952 Dutch Grand Prix:\n\nReliable sources sometimes disagree about race results. In this case there is disagreement over the result of driver Dries van der Lof. Current consensus is that he was NC (Not Classified). Before changing this, please see the 52 NED entry on the disputed results page, then start a discussion either on this page or on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Formula One. The consensus regarding other disputed results are listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One/Disputed results.\n\nFor Fisher at the 1967 Mexican Grand Prix:\n\nReliable sources sometimes disagree about race results. In this case there is disagreement over the result of driver Mike Fisher. Current consensus is that he was DNS (Did not start). Before changing this, please see the 67 MEX entry on the disputed results page, read the archived discussion then start a discussion either on this page or on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Formula One. The consensus regarding other disputed results are listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One/Disputed results\n\nThoughts? A7V2 (talk)\n\nI should (I think?) that the first sentence is taken directly from the first sentence of Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One/Disputed results. A7V2 (talk)\n\nI have implemented these two since there were no objections. I will probably eventually add the others (probably not the \"restarted races\" ones which aren't disputed) using more or less the same layout. A7V2 (talk)\n\nDo we really need this template? What does it do which could not do a simple sup tag?\n\n1''' <sup>P F</sup>''' {{F1 race position|1|f|p}} 1P F 1PF\n\nI see a potential issue with the big articles like Ferrari Grand Prix results and Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix results because at some point we may reach template transclusions limit and the pages would not load correctly. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nPinging template creator: @Krea:\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nThe template was created as a result of this discussion. I think one of the perceived advantages of using a template is that if that we decide in the future to change the formatting/annotation used to denote pole position and fastest lap (again), it only needs to be changed in one place, (the template) rather than in all the individual results tables. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nCan't deny this advantage. But what will you do when you reach template transclusions limit? P.S. Also the template doesn't work inside the module if we will decide to use it at some point. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nFirst thought is we would split it (Ferrari Grand Prix results (1950-2029) and then Ferrari Grand Prix results (2030-)). Then we can either have them as separate pages (with a summary on the main page) or transclude them into the main page (if that's a way of going around the transclusion limit). (I.e. Ferrari results would have a code of {{Ferrari Grand Prix results (1950-2029)}} {{Ferrari Grand Prix results (2030-)}}\n\nSSSB (talk)\n\nOk, I have no more questions on this one, thank you both. Corvus tristis (talk)\n\nTypically when discussing the season we break it up into multiple sections. For example, the 2019 season is broken up into \"Opening rounds\", \"European rounds\", and \"Closing rounds\", while the MCL34 article is even more specific and refers to \"Opening rounds\" (4 events), \"European and Canadian rounds\" (10 events), \"Asian rounds\" (3 events), and finally \"Closing rounds\" (4 events). Presumably, this is done for ease of navigation and to break up the 'legs' of the season. However, I have no idea how we're going to split up this season given it is almost e"
