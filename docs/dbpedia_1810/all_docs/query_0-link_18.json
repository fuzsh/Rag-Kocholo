The Dispute\n\n1.2 The main subject matter of the dispute is a small island called Pedra\n\nBranca situated in the middle of the Straits of Singapor e at the entrance to the\n\nSouth China Sea. Pedra Branca has been part of Singapore’s territory since the\n\n1840s. On 21 December 1979, Malaysia published a map entitled “Territorial\n\nWaters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia”. By this map, Malaysia\n\npurported to include Pedr a Branca within Malaysia’s territorial waters.\n\nSingapore duly lodged a protest with Mala ysia against this paper claim on 14\n\nFebruary 1980.\n\n1.3 By a Special Agreement dated 6 Febr uary 2003 and notified to the Court\n\non 24 July 2003, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to submit the foregoing dispute\n\n1\n\nto the Court. By Article 2 of the Special Agreement:\n\n“The Court is requested to determine whether sovereignty over:-\n\n(a) Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh;\n\n1 The Special Agreement is attached to this Memorial as Annex 1.\n\n– Page 1 – (b) Middle Rocks;\n\n(c) South Ledge,\n\nbelongs to Malaysia or the Republic of Singapore.”\n\n(Middle Rocks and South Le dge are two maritime featur es lying approximately\n\n0.6 nautical miles and 2.1 nautical miles from Pedra Branca.)\n\n1.4 The Special Agreement does not request the Co urt to enter into an\n\nexercise of delimitation or to make decl arations concerning fishing or other\n\neconomic rights. However, as is demonstrated in Chapter IX, principles of the\n\nLaw of the Sea are relevant in dete rmining whether sovereignty over Middle\n\nRocks and South Ledge belongs to Singapore or Malaysia.\n\nSection II. The Parties\n\n1.5 Malaysia is a federal State made up of 13 constituent states.She was\n\nformed in 1963 through the merger of the Federation of Malaya with the State of\n\nSingapore (then a British colony) and the British territories of Sabah and\n\nSarawak in Borneo. Among the 13 constituent states of Malaysia, the one that is\n\nrelevant to this dispute is the State of Johor.t is the state which is\n\ngeographically closest to Singapore.\n\n1.6 In the context of this dispute, Mala ysia is the successor State to the State\n\nof Johor in relation to her claim of sovereignty over Pedra Branca.\n\n1.7 Geographically, the Republic of Si ngapore consists of the main island of\n\nSingapore and 50 or so sm aller islands and islets.The English East India\n\nCompany (“EIC”) established a trading station at Singapore in February\n\n1819. In 1824, the EIC obtained, on behalf of the British Government, full\n\nsovereignty over the island of Singapore through a cession treaty with the local\n\nMalay chiefs.Singapore remained und er British rule until 1963, when she\n\n– Page 2 –became part of the newly fo rmed Federation of Malays ia. Singapore separated\n\nfrom Malaysia in 1965 to become an independent and sovereign republic.\n\n1.8 The Republic of Singapore has a total area of about 680 square kilometres\n\n(or 260 square miles) and a population of about 4 million. Her land area is\n\n2\n\nslightly smaller th an New York City or roughly one-third the size of Greater\n\nLondon. In comparison, Malaysia has a land area of 329,747 square kilometres\n\n(slightly larger than Italy but slightly smaller than Germany) including more\n\nthan 2,000 off-shore islands . Malaysia has a population of 24.5 million.\n\n1.9 Singapore is situated south of the Malay Peninsula, at the eastern entrance\n\nof the Straits of Malacca. To the north, Singapore is separated from Malaysia by\n\nthe Straits of Johor, but the two States are connected by a causeway and a\n\nbridge. To the south, Singapore is se parated from Indonesia by the Straits of\n\nSingapore. The position of Singapore rela tive to neighbouring States is shown\n\nin Map 1 (General Setting), overleaf.\n\n1.10 In the context of this dispute, Si ngapore is the succe ssor in title to the\n\nUnited Kingdom 4.\n\n2\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica (15th ed., 1988) states that the area of New York City is about 787\n\nsquare kilometres or 304 square miles.\n\n3\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica (15th ed., 1988) states that the area of Malaysia is about 329,747\n\nsquare kilometres or 127,356 square miles.\n\n4\n\nThroughout this Memorial, the terms “United Kingdom”, “Great Britain” and “Britain” will be\n\nused interchangeably as is appropriate to the context.\n\n– Page 3 – Section III. Structure of this Memorial\n\n1.11 In this Memorial, Singapore will sh ow that since 1847, Pedra Branca has\n\nbeen administered as part of Singapore ’s territory contin uously, without any\n\nprotest or challenge from Malaysia (or any of her predecessors) until the present\n\ndispute arose in 1979. Over the span of more than 150 years, Singapore (and her\n\npredecessors in title) has exercised her un interrupted sovereign authority over\n\nPedra Branca and its surrounding waters.\n\n1.12 This Memorial is divided into nine Chapters, including this Chapter.\n\n1.13 Chapter II provides a description of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and\n\nSouth Ledge.\n\n1.14 Chapter III provides a summary of the relevant historical background\n\nbeginning from the founding of Singapore in 1819 to the present day.\n\n1.15 Chapter IV explains in greater detail the origin and context of the dispute,\n\nand explains how the dispute came to be submitted to the Court.\n\n1.16 Chapter V explains how the United Kingdom (as predecessor of\n\nSingapore) came to acquire sovereignty over Pedra Branca. The Chapter\n\ndiscusses the applicable principles of international law, and demonstrates how\n\nSingapore effectively appropriated the is land in accordance with principles\n\ngoverning the acquisition of territory in the middle and late 19th century.\n\n1.17 Chapter VI demonstrates how Singa pore has effectively and peacefully\n\nexercised State authority over Pedra Br anca after taking possession of it, and\n\ndiscusses the legal consequences that flow from this exercise of State authority.\n\n– Page 4 –1.18 Chapter VII discusses Malaysia’s recognition of Singapore’s sovereignty\n\nover Pedra Branca, both expressly by Mala ysia’s official acts and implicitly by\n\nMalaysia’s persistent silence in the face of Singapore’s acts of sovereignty. The\n\nChapter also highlights a number of offi cial maps published by the Malaysian\n\ngovernment which expressly recognised Pedra Branca as part of Singapore.\n\n1.19 Chapter VIII discusses the express disclaimer of title made through\n\nofficial correspondence in 1953 by the State of Johor (Malaysia’s\n\npredecessor). This disclaimer is legally binding on Malaysia, and must be given\n\neffect.\n\n1.20 Chapter IX addresses the question of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and\n\nSouth Ledge. The Chapter shows that these minor geographical features, found\n\nvery near to Pedra Branca, must belo ng to the State adjudicated to have\n\nsovereignty over Pedra Branca.\n\n– Page 5 – CHAPTER II\n\nTHE PHYSICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING\n\n2.1 This Chapter describes the physic al and geographical setting of Pedra\n\nBranca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge.\n\nSection I. Pedra Branca\n\n2.2 Pedra Branca is an island measuri ng 137 metres long, with an average\n\nwidth of 60 metres and covering an ar ea of about 8,560 squa re metres at low\n\ntide. It is described in the Malacca Strait Pilot in the following manner :\n\n“PEDRA BRANCA, lying in the middle of the eastern entrance of\n\nSingapore strait, nearly 8 miles fr om either shore, is 24 feet (73)\n\nhigh. It is mn the wemtern edge of a ban1/4ith depths of 6 to 10\n\nfathoms (11 0 to 18 3), which extends 1 miles eastward of it. It\n\nwill be known by the lighthouse, which was erected on it in 1851,\n\nand named after Horsburgh, the celebrated hydrographer, whose\n\nlabours have in a high degree bene fited the inte5ests of navigation\n\nand commerce in every part of the eastern seas.”\n\n2.3 Pedra Branca is made entirely of granite. No vegetation grows\n\nthere.There is no eviden ce that Pedra Branca was ever inhabited before the\n\nBritish began constructing the Horsburgh Lighthouse there.Ever since the\n\nconstruction of the Lighthouse, the only people resident on Pedra Branca have\n\nbeen the personnel manning the lighthouse and other equipment on the island.\n\n5 Malacca Strait Pilot (1st ed., 1924), at p. 206.

Thus, J.T. Thomson, the Government\n\nSurveyor who designed and constructed Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca,\n\ndescribed it as:\n\n“…situated at the eastern extremity oftheStraitsofSingapore,\n\nnearly in mid-channel…” 6\n\nThe navigational guides of that period also described it in similar fashion. For\n\nexample, the 1817 edition of the famous India Directory, which was authored by\n\nthe British Hydrographer Captain James Horsburgh, describes Pedra Branca as:\n\n7\n\n“...situated in the middle of the entrance of Sincapour strait …”\n\nMap 2 (Location of Singapore, Pedra Branca and Johor ) overleaf shows the\n\nlocation of Pedra Branca relative to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\n2.5 Pedra Branca has been known to mariners for centuries.The name\n\n“Pedra Branca” is Portuguese for “white rock”, a reference to its original whitish\n\nappearance caused by the accumulation of bird droppings over hundreds of\n\nyears. Pedra Branca has been known by that name and other European language\n\nvariations thereof in European maps and sailing directi ons since the 16th\n\n6 Thomson J.T., Account of the Horsburgh Light-house , 6 Journal of the Indian Archipelago and\n\nEastern Asia 376 (1852), at p. 378.

It was similarly referred to as “B ai Jiao” (meaning “white reef”) in\n\n9\n\nChinese maps and sailing directions dating back to the 15th century .\n\n2.6 Pedra Branca’s position right in the middle of the Straits of Singapore as\n\nit opens into the South China Sea has made it a serious navigational hazard on an\n\nimportant international trade route.Fr om 1824 to 1851 al one, 16 ships were\n\nwrecked and another nine stranded after running aground in the vicinity of Pedra\n\nBranca 10. In 1847, the British colonial gov ernment in Singapor e occupied the\n\nisland and proceeded to build a lighthouse on it named “Horsburgh Lighthouse”\n\nin memory of the famous British hydr ographer James Horsburgh. Commencing\n\noperations in 1851, Horsburgh Lighthouse was the first lighthouse to be built by\n\nthe British in South East Asia. Shown on the following pages are:\n\n(a) an etching of Pedra Branca, dr awn and engraved by Thomas and\n\nWilliam Daniell, showing Pedra Branca before Horsburgh\n\nLighthouse was built (circa 1820) (Image 1);\n\n8\n\nSee Warnsinck J.C.M.

It links the Straits of Malacca (and the Indian Ocean to the\n\nWest) with the South China Sea (and the Pacific Ocean to the East). This means\n\nthat most ships going to the Far East from Europe, the Middle East and India,\n\nand vice versa, pass through the Straits of Singapore.On average, there are\n\nmore than 900 ships using the Straits of Singapore every day (i.e., one ship every\n\n1.6 minutes), with more than 80% of these ships arriving and departing from the\n\nport of Singapore, making Singapore the bu siest port in the world. More than\n\n1,000 ships are within Singapore port limits at any one time.\n\n11 Thomson’s Account, supra note 6, at p. 376.\n\n– Page 10 –2.9 The Straits of Singapore is cons equently of great importance to the\n\ninternational shipping co mmunityI .t plays a crucial part in Singapore’s\n\neconomy as her economic well-being and historical role as an entrepôt is heavily\n\ndependent on the flow of maritime traffic through th e Straits. As Pedra Branca\n\ncommands the entire eastern approach to the Straits, the continued ability of\n\nSingapore to exercise her sovereign terr itorial rights over Pedra Branca and its\n\nsurrounding waters is of the utmost importance to Singapore.\n\nSection II. Middle Rocks and South Ledge\n\n2.10 Slightly to the south of Pedra Br anca are two minor maritime features\n\nknown as “South Ledge” and “Middle Rocks”.\n\n2.11 South Ledge is a low-tide elevati on 2.1 nautical miles south of Pedra\n\nBranca. It is described in the Malacca Strait Pilot in the following manner:\n\n“South Ledge, consists of three ro cks, the northern of which dries\n\n8 feet (2m 4) and lies about about 2 miles south-south-westward of\n\nHorsburgh lighthouse; the others do not uncover. They are steep-\n\nto and are 12arly always mark ed by heavy tide-rips or by\n\nbreakers.”\n\nThree photographs showing South Ledge appear overleaf:\n\n(a) a photograph showing South Le dge completely submerged at high\n\ntide, with only the wreck of MV Gichoon showing (Image5);\n\n(b) a photograph showing South Ledge at low tide (Image 6); and\n\n(c) a photograph showing South Ledge at low tide, with two persons\n\non the largest rock (Image 7).\n\n12 Malacca Strait Pilot (2nd ed., 1934), at p. 213, supra note 5.\n\n– Page 11 –2.12 Between South Ledge and Pedra Branca is a group of small rocky\n\noutcrops called “Middle Rock s”, lying about 0.6 nautic al miles south of Pedra\n\nBranca. Middle Rocks consists of two cl usters of small rocks about 250 metres\n\napart. While the largest of these rocks measures a bout 55 metres by 15 metres,\n\nmost of the rocks in these two clusters are much smaller, averaging 5 metres in\n\nsize. Middle Rocks and Pedra Branca ar e joined to each ot her by a submerged\n\nbank. The Malacca Straits Pilot describes Middle Rocks as:\n\n“Middle rocks, from 2 to 4 feet (0 m6 to 1 2) high, and of a whitish\n\ncolour, lie about half a mile sout hward of the lighthouse, and on\n\n13\n\nthe south-western edge of the bank on which Pedra Branca lies.”\n\nIncluded overleaf are close-up photographs of Middle Rocks:\n\n(a) showing the western cluster of Middle Rocks with the eastern\n\ncluster in the background (Image 8);\n\n(b) showing the eastern cluster of Middle Rocks (Image 9); and\n\n(c) showing a close-up of persons on the western cluster of Middle\n\nRocks (Image 10).\n\n2.13 The position of Middle Rocks and South Ledge relative to Pedra Branca\n\nis shown on Map 3 (Sketch Map of the vicinity of Pedra Branca) overleaf. A\n\nmore detailed physical description of Middle Rocks and South Ledge is given in\n\nChapter IX. It is sufficient for the purposes of this Chapter to reiterate that\n\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge are extremely insignificant maritime features, as\n\ncan be seen in Images 5 to 10.\n\n13 Malacca Strait Pilot (2nd ed., 1934), at p. 213, supra note 5. See also Malacca Strait Pilot (3rd\n\ned., 1946), at p. 217, supra note 5.\n\n– Page 12 – Section III. Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge form a\n\nDistinct Group of Features\n\n2.14 In this Memorial, a group of feat ures known as Romania Islands (also\n\ncalled “Lima Islands” in more recent ch arts and sailing directions) will be\n\nreferred to from time to time. Within this group lies an island called “Peak\n\nRock”. It is convenient to state clear ly that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and\n\nSouth Ledge stand by themse lves as a group and are distinct from the Romania\n\ngroup of islands. The latter group of isla nds all lie within close proximity (i.e.,\n\nwell within 3 nautical miles) of the Malay Peninsula and is separated from Pedra\n\nBranca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge by the main shipping channel, known as\n\nMiddle Channel, which is also the deep wa ter channel in this part of the Straits\n\nof Singapore. This can be seen from Map 3 (shown above, after page 12) and\n\nfrom the British Admiralty Chart 3831, an extract of which is presented overleaf,\n\nas Map 4 ( Extract from British Admiralty Char t 3831 (1979) entitled\n\n“Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, Singapore Strait, Eastern Part”).\n\n2.15 Older maps and sea-charts have al so shown and depicted Pedra Branca,\n\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge as a dist inct group which is clearly separated\n\nfrom the Romania group of island s. See, in this regard, Map 5 (Map entitled\n\n“The Straits of Sincapore”, published by Laurie and Whittle, 1799) and Map 6\n\n(Inset entitled “A Plan of the Strait of Singapore from the latest Surveys” ,\n\nextracted from “A New Chart of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore drawn\n\nfrom the latest Surveys, with Additions and Improvements”, published by Norie,\n\n1831), shown overleaf.\n\n– Page 13 –2.16 An examination of the various pilots and sailing di rections of the region\n\nconfirms that Pedra Branca, Middle Ro cks and South Ledge as a group has\n\nalways been regarded as distinct fro m the Romania group of islands.For\n\nexample, an 18th century Pilot states that:\n\n“Pedro Branco bears from the outermost rocks, or islands, off\n\nPoint Romania, EbS½S. 2½ leagues. Between these is the\n\nchannel, or entrance into the Straits of Sincapour… ” 14\n\nThis geological fact is also repeated in more recent Pilots:\n\n“Middle Channel, between Pedra Branca and Remunia shoals, is 4\n\nmiles wide…\n\nm\n\nPedra Branca, 24 feet (7 3) high, lies… 7¾ miles east-south-\n\neastward of Tanjong Datok [i.e. Point Romania]…\n\nLima islands, together with many dangers around them, extend\n\nabout 3 miles in a north-north-ea sterly and south-south-westerl15\n\ndirection, and 2¼ miles south-eastward of Tanjong Datok.”\n\n2.17 Thus Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge do not form part of\n\nthe Romania Islands, but are a distinct group of features by themselves.\n\n14\n\nDunn S. et al, A New Directory for the East Indies (5th ed., 1780), at p. 509, attached to this\n\nMemorial as Annex 2.\n\n15\n\nMalacca Strait Pilot (3rd ed., 1946), at p. 217, supra note 5.

As peninsular Johor was then la rgely covered by\n\nprimary forest, the Temenggong lived in a small settlement in Singapore.\n\n3.3 In the Malay political context of th at time, the Temenggong was a vassal\n\nof the Sultan of the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sult anate.The state of affairs in this\n\nSultanate in 1819, when Sir Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore to establish a\n\ntrading station there on behalf of the English East India Company (“EIC”), was\n\ndescribed by C.M. Turnbull in A History of Singapore, 1819-1975 in the\n\nfollowing words :\n\n“By that time little remained of the once powerful Malay\n\nempire.From his capital in th e Riau-Lingga archipelago, the\n\nSultan claimed suzerainty over Johor, Pahang and some of the East\n\nSumatran states. In practice the authority of the throne was\n\nundermined by disputes and intrigues between Bugis and Malay\n\nfactions at court. The two most senior vassals, the Bendahara who\n\nlived in Pahang, and the Teme nggong, whose fief was Johor,\n\nSingapore and neighbouring is lands, enjoyed an increasing\n\nmeasure of independence.\n\nThe succession to the throne had b een in dispute since 1812 when\n\nthe previous Sultan had died, leaving no heirs by his royal\n\nmarriages but two sons by commoner wives. Hussein, the elder,\n\nseemed to be marked for succession by his father. Marriages were\n\narranged for him with relatives of the Bendahara and Temenggong,\n\nand he was attending his wedding in Pahang when his father\n\ndied. In his absence, the Bugis faction acclaimed the younger son\n\nAbdu’r-Rahman as Sultan. Abdu’r-R ahman held court at Lingga\n\n– Page 15 – while Hussein returned to live in obscurity in Riau, but no formal\n\ncoronation ceremony could take pl ace because the late Sultan’s\n\nroyal widow, who favoured Hussein, refused to give up the\n\nregalia. Abdu’r-Rahman’s succession was acknowledged neither\n\nby the Temenggong nor the Bendaha ra, but the Dutch recognized\n\nhim, and Farquhar [ one of Raffles’ lieutenants ], who was familiar\n\nwith the background to the disputed succession, and by the\n\nTemenggong, who was Hussein’s fa ther-in-law, decided that, in\n\norder to establish legality for th e British station at Singapore, it\n\nwould probably be necessary to recognize the elder claimant.” 16\n\n3.4 Accordingly, Raffles had Hussein brought to Singapore from where he\n\nwas living (in a small island near Singapor e) to proclaim him as the Sultan of\n\nJohor in order for the new Sultan to lend his authority to the establishment of the\n\nBritish station in Singapore.For this purpose, a Treaty of Friendship and\n\nAlliance was made on 6 February 1819 between Raffles (for and on behalf of the\n\nEIC) on the one hand and Sultan Hussein (d escribed in the Treaty as “Sultan of\n\nJohore”) and Temenggong Abdul Rahman (described in the Treaty as “Chief of\n\nSingapore”) on the other hand . 17\n\n3.5 On 2 August 1824, the EIC entered into a treaty of cession with Sultan\n\nHussein (who was descri bed in the treaty as “Sultan of Johore”) and\n\nTemenggong Abdul Rahman (who was desc ribed in the treaty as “Tumongong\n\nof Johore”) whereby, in consideration of certain payments to them, they ceded:\n\n“… full sovereignty and property to the… English East India\n\nCompany, their heirs and successors for ever, the Island of\n\nSingapore, situated in the Straits of Malacca, together with the\n\nadjacent seas, straits, and islets, to the extent of ten geographical\n\nmiles, from the coast of the main Island of Singapore.” 18\n\n16 Turnbull C.M., A History of Singapore, 1819-1975(1977), at p. 9.\n\n17 With the proclamation of Hussein as the Sultan of Johor, there were two Sultans of Johor, one\n\nunder Dutch protection and the other under British protection.\n\n18 A Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between the Honourable the English East India Company\n\non the one side and their Highnesses the Sultan and Tumungong of Johore on the other,\n\nconcluded on the Second day of August, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty-Four\n\n– Page 16 –3.6 In 1826, Singapore an d the other two British settlements in the Malay\n\nPeninsula, viz ., Malacca and Penang (also know n as the “Prince of Wales\n\nIsland”), were amalgamated into a single administrative unit called the “Straits\n\nSettlements”.The Straits Settlements we re governed direc tly by and as a\n\ndependency of the Bengal Government in In dia. It was during this period, as\n\nwill be explained in Chapter V, that the British colonial authorities in Singapore\n\ntook lawful possession of Pedra Branca in 1847 and acquired sovereignty over\n\nthe island.\n\n3.7 In 1867, the Government in India ceas ed to be responsible for the Straits\n\nSettlements which then became a Crow n Colony reporting directly to the\n\nColonial Office in London. This took place on 1 April 1867 and was effected by\n\nthe Straits Settlements Act of 1866. Th is Act described the Straits Settlements\n\nas:\n\n“Prince of Wales’ Island , the Island of Singapore, and the Town\n\nand Fort of Malacca, and their Dependencies .”19[emphasis in\n\nunderline added]\n\n3.8 ThSetratettlements continued as a Crown Colony until they, together\n\nwith the Malay States in the Malay pe ninsula, were inva ded and occupied by\n\nJapan between 1942 and 1945I .n Se ptember 1945, the Japanese forces\n\nsurrendered to the South East Asia Allied Forces and immediately thereafter the\n\n(1824), reprinted in Allen, Stockwell & Wright (eA Collection of Treaties and other\n\nDocuments Affecting the States of Malaysia, 1761-1(1981), at p. 37, attached to this\n\nMemorial as Annex 4.\n\n19 An Act to provide for the Government of the “Straits Settlements”, 29 & 30 Vic.

Since then, as Chapter VI will show, Pedra Branca has\n\nbeen occupied and administered as part of Singapore’s territory continuously for\n\nmore than 130 years without any protes t or challenge from Malaysia (or her\n\n32\n\npredecessor, the State of Johor) until 1979 .\n\nSection I. The Origins of the Dispute\n\n4.2 On 21 December 1979, Malaysia published a map (“the 1979 Map”)\n\nwhich showed the outer limits and turning point coordinates of her territorial sea\n\nand continental shelfT . hese limits were not, as between Singapore and\n\nMalaysia, derived from any negotiated delimitation exercise 33.\n\n4.3 The 1979 Map covered all of Malaysia’s maritime boundaries. A reduced\n\nversion of the 1979 Map is shown overleaf as Map 7 (Map entitled “Territorial\n\nWaters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia ”, published by the\n\nDirector of National Mapping, Malaysia, 1979).\n\n32\n\n130 years refers to the period from Singapore’s occupation of Pedra Branca (1847) to the date\n\nwhen Malaysia first made a paper claim (1979).\n\n33\n\nThe 1979 Map was published pursuant to legislation passed ten years earlier in August 1969 –\n\nthe Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No(Malaysia), attached to this Memorial as\n\nAnnex 114. Through this piece of legislation, Malaysia claimed a territorial sea of 12 nautical\n\nmiles and announced its intention to effect the publication of a “large scale map indicating the\n\nlow water marks, the baselines and the territorial waters of Malaysia.” The 1969 Ordinance did\n\nnot mention or describe the intended limits of Malaysia’s 12 nautical mile territorial sea.\n\n– Page 21 –4.4 The 1979 Map, published by the Director of National Mapping, Malaysia,\n\npurported, for the very first time, to un ilaterally define some of Malaysia’s\n\nboundaries with Singapore.The ma p shows Pedra Branca as lying within\n\nMalaysia’s territorial waters. See Map 8 below.\n\nMap 8 (Extract from map entitled “Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf\n\nBoundaries of Malaysia”, published by the Director of National Mapping,\n\nMalaysia, 1979), focussing on the area around Pedra Branca (indicated by the\n\nadded red arrow above) – Pedra Branca has been placed within Malaysian\n\nterritorial waters (dark blue)\n\n4.5 A few days before the publicati on of the 1979 Map, the Malaysian\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs contacted Singapore’s High Commissioner to\n\nMalaysia and asked him to attend a me eting at the Malaysian Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs on Friday 21 December 1979. The Malaysian Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs did not explain what the purpose of the meeting was. This was\n\nhow the Singapore High Commissioner described the meeting in his report to the\n\nSingapore Government dated 24 December 1979:\n\n“3 Wisma Putra [ i.e. the Malaysian Mi nistry of Foreign\n\nAffairs] telephoned my PA [ i.e. Personal Assistant ] four days\n\nbefore to fix an appointment (11.45 am on Friday, 22 [ sic]\n\nDecember) for me to call on De puty Secretary Ge neral, Hamid\n\nPawanchee. His PA indicated sh e hoped I would not change the\n\ntime for the appointment. When my PA asked what the subject\n\n– Page 22 –would be the PA said she did not know, but it was ‘bilateral’. It\n\nlater turned out thatthe timing was to co incide with a press\n\nconference scheduled to be held by [ Malaysia’s] Minister of Land\n\nand Regional Development, Tan Sri Kadir Yusof. In other words,\n\nwhile Pawanchee was informing me verbally in this office Tan Sri\n\nKadir would be telling the press about the new map being gazetted.\n\nThis plan was, however, changed at the last moment. I will\n\nexplain later.\n\n…\n\n5 After Hamid Pawanchee had verbally read the official\n\nstatement from a prepared text I asked him where I could get\n\ncopies of the map and the gazette notification. He said they would\n\nbe available at the Map Sales Offi ce. I then said Tan Sri Kadir\n\nwould obviously be giving copies of the gazette to the press at a\n\nnews conference. Pawanchee replied : ‘No, that has been changed.\n\nThere will be no press conference .’ He did not as k me how I got\n\nthe information. I did not disclose my source either.\n\n6 The method of informing us wa s definitely a strategy that\n\nwas carefully laid out. Pawanche e read it out from a typewritten\n\ntext and after reading it put it aside. He did not offer me a copy. It\n\nwas clear the Malaysian Governme nt wanted the notice to be\n\nverbal.\n\n7 Pawanchee behaved unnaturally at this meeting. At other\n\ntimes he used to behave in a personal and friendly manner. This\n\ntime he became silent after reading the statement. I asked if that\n\nwas all he wanted me to convey to my Government. He merely\n\nsaid : ‘If there are any clarifica tions or points your government\n\nlikes to have, they can be discussed in a friendly manner.’\n\n8 I asked Pawanchee if the ne w continental shelf was drawn\n\nonly on the provisions of the Geneva Convention 1958 and the\n\nJohore-Singapore Maritime Trea ty 1927 or were there other\n\nconsiderations. He mumbled ‘Yes, on those two, but if there are\n\nclarifications we could meet and discuss.’\n\n…\n\n11 He repeated twice to me th at there were no problems with\n\nThailand and Indonesia. Malays ia had discussed with these two\n\nneighbours and entered into bilate ral agreements with them. He\n\ndid not say anything about the Phili ppines. He then point out that\n\nin our case Horsburg [sic] lighthouse was affected. I looked at the\n\nmap and saw ‘Pulau Batu Puteh’. …\n\n– Page 23 – 12 As an aside, probably to soften the blow on us, Pawanchee\n\npointed out that Hanoi and Jakarta have a dispute on some islands\n\nnear the Natunas. He was trying to tell me that this sort of thing is\n\nto be expected among neighbours.\n\n13 Overall, my reading is that Malaysia is taking the line of\n\ngazetting their claim of Pulau Batu Puteh, then wait for Singapore\n\nto dispute it. The ball, therefore, is now in our court.” 34\n\n4.6 Despite the fact that Malaysia ma de her claim to Pedra Branca in a\n\nhesitant and unusual manner, a response was clearly warranted. After obtaining\n\na copy of the map and considering it in detail, Singapore sent Malaysia a\n\ndiplomatic note on 14 February 1980. This note, in rejecting Malaysia’s\n\npurported claim and requesting that the 1979 Map be amended, stated\n\nSingapore’s legal position in the following terms:\n\n“The Government of the Repub lic of Singapore is gravely\n\nconcerned at what is set out in th e said map. This map purports to\n\nclaim the island of Pedra Branca as belonging to Malaysia. The\n\nGovernment of the Republic of Singapore rejects this claim. There\n\nis no premise in international law on which to found such a\n\nclaim. The Government of the Republic of Singapore has since the\n\n1840s, by virtue of both its ac ts and those of its predecessor\n\ngovernments, occupied and exer cised sovereignty over Pedra\n\nBranca and the waters around it. Since that time, no other country\n\nhas exercised or claimed jurisd iction or contested Singapore’s\n\nsovereignty over Pedra Branca. The Government of the Republic\n\nof Singapore therefore requests that the said map be suitably\n\namended to35eflect the sovere ignty of Singapore over Pedra\n\nBranca.”\n\n34 See Letter from Singapore’s High Commissioner (Kuala Lumpur) to the Singapore Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs dated 24 Dec 1979, attached to this Memorial as AnnSee also Telex\n\nfrom the Singapore High Commission (Kuala Lumpur) to the Singapore Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs dated 21 Dec 1979, attached to this Memorial as Annex 140.\n\n35 See Singapore’s Note MFA 30/80 dated 14 Feb 1980, attached to this Memorial as Annex 144.\n\n– Page 24 –4.7 Malaysia responded to this diplomatic note two months later, on 14 April\n\n1980, by stating:\n\n“... the Government of Malaysia ha s included the island of Pedra\n\nBranca or Pulau Batu Puteh as part of Malaysian territory in the\n\nmap because, from time immemorial this island has been part of\n\nthe territor36of the State of Joho re which is a component State of\n\nMalaysia.”\n\nSection II. The Special Agreement\n\n4.8 In 1981, Singapore’s Prime Minist er agreed with Malaysia’s Prime\n\nMinister that the matter should be resolved bilaterally through a formal exchange\n\n37 38\n\nof documents . Despite many reminders, the exchange did not take place . In\n\n1989, Singapore recommended to Malaysia that the dispute should be referred to\n\n39\n\nthe International Court of Justice for final adjudication . Eventually, after the\n\nPrime Ministers met on 25 January 1992, Malaysia’s Prime Minister agreed with\n\nSingapore’s Prime Minister that the form al exchange of documents should be\n\n40\n\neffected T.he two Attorneys-General were to “effect the exchange of\n\ndocuments and determine the ownershi p of Pedra Branca based on legal\n\n36 See Malaysia’s Note EC 87/80 dated 14 Apr 1980, attached to this Memorial as Annex 146.\n\n37 See Singapore’s Note SHC 109/89 dated 1 July 1989, attached to this Memorial as Annex 163.\n\n38 See Singapore’s Note SHC 109/89 dated 1 July 1989 attached to this Memorial as Annex 163;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 139/89 dated 11 Sep 1989 attached to this Memorial as Annex 166;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 143/89 dated 13 Sep 1989 attached to this Memorial as Annex 168;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 64/90 dated 8 June 1990 attached to this Memorial as Annex 169;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 161/90 dated 22 Dec 1990 attached to this Memorial as Annex 170;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 104/91 dated 16 Sep 1991 attached to this Memorial as Annex 171;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 134/91 dated 15 Nov 1991 attached to this Memorial as Annex 176;\n\nSingapore’s Note SHC 135/91 dated 15 Nov 1991 attached to this Memorial as Annex 177;\n\nSingapore’s Note MFA/D1/858/91 dated 15 Nov 1991 attached to this Memorial as Annex 174;\n\nand Singapore’s Note MFA/D1/859/91 dated 15 Nov 1991 attached to this Memorial as Annex\n\n175.\n\n39 See note 37 above.\n\n40 See Singapore’s Note SHC 18/92 dated 13 Mar 1992, attached to this Memorial as Annex 179.\n\n– Page 25 – 41\n\nprinciples.” Singapore took the first step , and submitted her arguments and\n\ndocumentary evidence of Singapore’s ownership of Pedra Branca to Malaysia on\n\n15 February 1992.\n\n4.9 Malaysia responded in a Memorandum dated 20 June 1992. Face-to-face\n\nconsultations between senior officials were held on 4-6 February 1993 and 12-14\n\nJanuary 1994. After two rounds of consultations, further rebuttals and a\n\nSupplementary Memorandum, it became cl ear that the dispute could not be\n\nresolved by the parties through bilateral consultations. Singapore then reiterated\n\nher suggestion that the dispute should be submitted to the International Court of\n\nJustice 42. Malaysia agreed , and senior officials were asked to negotiate a\n\nSpecial Agreement to submit the dispute to this Court, pursuant to Article 36 of\n\nthe Statute of this Court.Senior officials met in 19 95, 1996 and 1998 to\n\nnegotiate the text of the Special Agreemen t. They agreed on a draft, which was\n\n44\n\nthen submitted to the respective governments .\n\n4.10 The Special Agreement was signed by the Foreign Ministers of both\n\nStates on 6 February 2003.The exchange of instruments of ratification took\n\nplace on 9 May 2003 and the Special Agre ement was jointly notified to the\n\nRegistrar of the Court on 24 July 2003 45.

Introduction\n\n5.1 The purpose of the present Chapter is to give an account of the process by\n\nwhich the British Crown deci ded to take possession of Pedra Branca for the\n\npurpose of constructing a lighthouse on it, together with related fixtures and\n\nappurtenances, the achievement of this purpose, and the legal consequences.\n\n5.2 As will become clear, the decision to build a lighthouse on Pedra Branca\n\nwas taken by the (British Co lonial) Government of I ndia and it was the British\n\nCrown, acting through the Government of India, which planned and substantially\n\npaid for the construction. It was, again, the Government of India which, in the\n\nperson of the appropriate officials in th e Straits Settlements, participated in\n\nceremonies which accompanied both the in ception of the construction and the\n\ninspection of the completed works by an official party on 27 September 1851.\n\n5.3 As a further preliminary, it is pertin ent to give emphasis to the fact that\n\nthe Government of India selected an is land on which an appropriate lighthouse\n\nwould be built. The physical description provided in Chapter II above indicates\n\nthe character and dimensions of Pedra Branca as a physical feature.\n\n5.4 In these circumstances it must be clea r that the feature is not an artificial\n\nisland created by the construction of the lighthouse or other works, but an island,\n\nin the sense of international law, on which a lighthouse has been built.\n\n– Page 29 – Section II. The Basis of Claim\n\n5.5 It will be helpful to the Court if the basis of Singapore’s claim to Pedra\n\nBranca is indicated as a preface to the present chapter. Singapore’s claim is not\n\nbased on the Treaty of Cession of 1824. 47 That treaty dealt only with the main\n\nisland of Singapore and its immediate vici nity. It did not extend to the area\n\naround Pedra Branca. Instead, Singapore’s case is that the events of 1847 to\n\n1851 (to be elaborated in due course) constituted a taking of lawful possession of\n\nPedra Branca by agents of the British Crow n. In the years that followed, the\n\nBritish Crown, and subsequently, Singapore, continually exercised acts of State\n\nauthority in respect of Pedra Branca. This effective and peaceful exercise of\n\nState authority confirmed and maintained the title gained in th e period 1847 to\n\n1851 by the taking of lawful possession on behalf of the Crown.\n\nSection III. The Decision to Build the Lighthouse was Taken by the\n\nBritish Crown\n\n5.6 It is necessary to introduce the so urces of British authority in the Straits\n\nSettlements. These comprised Singapore, Malacca and Penang (also known as\n\nthe Prince of Wales Island). The Straits Settlements were created in 1826 and\n\nwere administered by the East India Company.\n\n5.7 The East India Company acted as an organ of the Br itish Crown and its\n\nactivities were supervised by the Boar d of Control in London headed by a\n\n48\n\nBritish Government Minister .\n\n47 This treaty is discussed above, at para. 3.5.\n\n48 See Letter from the Court of Directors of the East India Company to the Governor General of\n\nIndia in Council dated 15 Oct 1845, attached to this Memorial as Annex 15; and Letter from the\n\nCourt of Directors of the East India Company to the Governor General of India in Council dated\n\n24 Feb 1847, attached to this Memorial as Annex 18. See also Article XXV of the 1833 Charter\n\nof the East India Company, attached to this Memorial as Annex 5.\n\n– Page 30 –5.8 It is universally recognised th at the East India Company was the\n\nrepresentative of the British Crown in the sphere of international relations. In a\n\nLaw Officers’ Report of 28 December 1897, Webster and Finlay observe that:\n\n“The Royal Niger Company is no t a mere trading Company, but\n\nhas also power to acquire, retain and govern territory. It resembles\n\nthe East India Company, the pos ition of which was explained by\n\nChief Justice Tindal in the case of Gibson v East India Company, 5\n\nBingham, New Cases (Common Pleas Reports), p.273.” 49\n\n5.9 In Gibson v. East India Company, Chief Justice Tindal had explained the\n\nposition in detail. In his words:\n\n“The stat. 9 & 10 W., c.44, a nd the charter of incorporation\n\ngranted by the King under the po wers of that act, form the\n\nfoundation of the privileges of the present united East India\n\nCompany.And from the provisions made by the statute it is\n\nevident, that the comp any was established, originally and in the\n\nfirst instance, for the purpose of trade only; namely of exclusively\n\ntrafficking and using the trade of merchandise to and from the East\n\nIndies, and in all places between the Cape of Good Hope, and the\n\nStraights of Magellan, and with no other object or design.But,\n\nwithout adverting to various enlargements by the legislature in\n\nsubsequent reigns, of the term for which the charter was originally\n\ngranted, it will be sufficient for the present purpose to observe, that\n\nabout the commencemen t of the reign of George III., a question\n\narose between the government and th e East India Company, as to\n\nthe claim set up by the latter, to the possession of the territorial\n\nacquisitions in India, which ha d been made by them; a claim\n\ninconsistent with the general prin ciple prevailing in the law, both\n\nof this and other states, namely, that all conquests made by\n\nsubjects must necessarily belong to the CrowA n.nd in\n\nconsequence of this contention an agreement was entered into\n\nbetween the company and the public, ‘that the territorial\n\nacquisitions and revenues lately acquired in the East Indies, should\n\nremain in possession of the comp any, and their successors during\n\nthe term therein mentioned; an Agreement which was carried into\n\neffect by the stat. 7G. 3, c.57. The term therein mentioned was\n\nafterwards enlarged, and the possession and government of the\n\n49 See McNair, International Law Opinions, Vol. 1 (1956), at p. 296.\n\n– Page 31 – territorial acquisitions continued in the said united company by\n\nsubsequent acts of the legislatur e, down to the present time;\n\nwithout prejudice, however, as decl ared by the preamble to the\n\nstatute of the 53 G.3, c.155, s.61, to the undoubted sovereignty of\n\nthe Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in\n\nand over the same, or to any clai m of the said united company to\n\nany rights, franchises, or immunities.’” 50\n\n5.10 The opinion of Chief Justice Tindal was expressed in 1839T . he\n\nassessment is shared by later commentator s.Thus Schwarzenberger refers to\n\ncompanies like the East Indi a Company as “organs of the States by which their\n\n51\n\ncharters had been granted.” Similar opinions were expressed by T.J. Lawrence\n\n52\n\nand H.A. Smith in their publications as well .\n\nSection IV. The Constitutional Relationships: The Government of\n\nIndia, the Court of Directors of the East India Company and the\n\nBoard of Control\n\n5.11 It will be helpful if the nomenclature is explained. In general, reference\n\nto the Government of India involves the Governor-General of India and his\n\nCouncil sitting in Calcutta – all of wh om were officers of the East India\n\nCompany 53. The Governor-General of India wa s subject to the authority of the\n\nCourt of Directors of the East India Co mpany.This, in turn, was under the\n\ndirection of the Board of Control, which was headed by the Secretary of State, a\n\nBritish Government Minister. Consequently, all decisions of the Government of\n\nIndia were made under the control of the British Crown, that is to say, the British\n\n50\n\n(1839), at pp. 271-272, attachedto this Memorial as Annex 7.mmon Pleas Reports)\n\n51\n\nSee Schwarzenberger G., International Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals ,\n\nVol. 1 (3rd ed., 1957), at p. 80.\n\n52\n\nSee Lawrence T.J., The Principles of International Law (1895), at pp. 79-82, and Smith H.A.,\n\nGreat Britain and the Law of Nations, Vol. 2 (1935), at p. 77.\n\n53\n\nExcept for one member of the Council called the “legal member” who was in attendance only\n\nduring legislative proceedings.\n\n– Page 32 –Government in London. Below the Governor-General of India, the\n\nadministration was divided into four Presidencies (Bengal, Bombay, Madras and\n\nAgra). The Straits Settlements, including Singapore, were administered as part\n\nof the Bengal Presidency at the time when the lighthouse was being planned and\n\nconstructed.\n\n5.12 As will be demonstrated in du e course, the ultimate approval for\n\nconstruction of the lighthouse was obtaine d from the Court of Directors of the\n\nEast India Company (sited in London) and this was the appropriate procedure.\n\nSection V. The Entire Process of Planning, Choice of Site and\n\nConstruction was Subject to the Control and Approval of the British\n\nGovernment and its Representatives\n\nA. I NTRODUCTION\n\n5.13 It will be helpful at this stage to present a brief history of the events\n\nleading to the construction of the light house and the taking of possession of\n\nPedra Branca. As a preliminary, it is ne cessary to describe the general character\n\nof the evidence. This consists, to a very great extent, of correspondence between\n\nthree linked pairs of officials of the Government of India, who were instrumental\n\nin the planning of the enterprise and, in due course, in the execution of the\n\ninstructions of the Court of Directors of the East India Company when these\n\nwere issued in 1847.\n\n5.14 The three pairs of officials functioned in this way:\n\n(a) The Government of India, th rough the Bengal Presidency, had\n\nauthority over, and corresponded with, Colonel W.J. Butterworth,\n\nGovernor of the Straits Settlements (hereinafter referred to as\n\n“Governor Butterworth”);\n\n(b) Governor Butterworth had auth ority over, and corresponded with,\n\nThomas Church, Resident Councillor at Singapore; and\n\n– Page 33 – (c) Thomas Church had authority ov er, and correspond ed with, J.T.\n\nThomson, the Government Surve yor at Singapore, who was the\n\narchitect and engineer responsible for planning and constructing\n\nthe lighthouse on Pedra Branca (hereinafter referred to as\n\n“Thomson”).\n\n5.15 Governor Butterworth was direc tly involved from early on, and it is\n\nrecorded that he visi ted Pedra Branca in 1847 54. Governor Butterworth was\n\npresent at the formal laying of the Foundation Stone on 24 May 1850; his name\n\nappears on the panel in the Visitors Room of the lighthouse ; and he it was who\n\nsigned the British Notice to Mariners dated 24 September 1851.It was also\n\nGovernor Butterworth who was in char ge of the final commissioning ceremony\n\non 27 September 1851.\n\n5.16 But the authoritative witness is clearly Thomson. Apart from the\n\ncorrespondence involv ing Thomson, a major resource is the Account of the\n\nHorsburgh Light-house , written by Thomson and pub lished, in 1852, in the\n\nJournal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia 56. This is in fact the text of\n\nthe official report prepared by Thomson, in his role as Government Surveyor at\n\nSingapore, after completion of the project. It is dated 14 August 1852. As the\n\npreface explains, the account had been prepared at the wish of Governor\n\nButterworth. On the panel in the Visito rs Room, Thomson is described as the\n\n54\n\nSee Letter from Butterworth W.J. (Governor of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore and Malacca)\n\nto Beadon C.

(Governor of Prince of Wales\n\nIsland, Singapore and Malacca) to Beadon C. (Under Secretary to the Government of Bengal)\n\ndated 1 Oct 1847, attached to this Memorial as Annex 24.\n\n55\n\nThe panel is mentioned in Thomson’s Account, supra note 6, at p. 474, and is described further\n\nbelow, at para. 5.86 of this Memorial. A picture of the panel appears as Image 14, shown after\n\np. 72 below.\n\n56\n\nSee generally Thomson’s Account, supra note 6.\n\n– Page 34 –“Architect” and it was Gove rnor Butterworth who sele cted Thomson for that\n\nposition .7\n\n5.17 Thomson was in charge of the en tire construction project, and it was\n\nunder his direct control. Not only did he make regular visits to Pedra Branca,\n\nbut he spent long periods living on the island in a house. The correspondence\n\nbetween the key officials, together with Thomson’s Account, produces a detailed\n\nand reliable volume of evidence.\n\n5.18 The brief history of the events leading to the construction of the\n\nlighthouse begins in 1836 when Ca ptain James Horsburgh, an eminent\n\nhydrographer of the East India Company, passed away.Merchants in Canton\n\nresolved to raise a lighthouse on Pedra Branca to his memory 58. Funds were also\n\nraised to this end by the merchant communities in Bombay and Penang . 59\n\n5.19 After a lapse of six years, Jardine Matheson & Co. wrote to the Governor\n\nof the Straits Settlements in 1842, to inform him that they had collected 5,513.50\n\nSpanish Dollars for the building of a lighthouse on Pedra Branca. The Governor\n\nat the time – S.G. Bonham – reported th is to the Government in India and\n\n60\n\nrecommended that a lighthous e be built on Barn Island . However, Bonham’s\n\nsuggestion was declined because the British Crown, through the Court of\n\n57 See Thomson’s Account, supra note 6, at p. 377.\n\n58 See Letter from Jardine Matheson & Co. to Bonham S.G.

However, Governor Butterworth\n\nsuggested that the Lighthouse be built on Peak Rock of f Point Romania instead.\n\nSee overleaf for Map 9 (Chart of the Vicinity of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and\n\nAdjacent Malayan Coast by J.T. Thom son, Government Surveyor, 1851),\n\nshowing the various locations involved. Governor Butterworth also reported\n\nthat Peak Rock had belonged to the Rajah and the Temenggong of Johor but that\n\nhe had obtained their consent to cede Peak Rock to the East India Company\n\n62\n\ngratuitously .\n\n5.21 There then ensued some argument between Governor Butterworth and the\n\nGovernment of India over where Horsburgh Lighthouse should be located. In a\n\nletter to the Government of India dated 22 August 1845, Governor Butterworth\n\ntook great pains to explain that while Pedra Branca was the best possible\n\n61 See Letter from Bushby G.A.

(Governor of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore and Malacca)\n\nto Currie F. (Secretarto the Government of India) dated 28 Nov 1844, attached to this\n\nMemorial as Annex 13. The reference in the letter to the “Rajah of Johore” is a reference to\n\nTengku (Prince) Ali, son of Sultan Hussein of Johore, who died in 1835 leaving Tengku Ali as\n\nhis successor. The British did not immediatel y recognise Tengku Ali’s rights tcalled\n\n“Sultan of Johore” and this was why Butterworth did not refer to him as “Sultan of Johore” in\n\nthe letter. It was only in 1855 that the Britis h recognised Tengku Ali’s claim to the title of\n\n“Sultan of Johore”.The Temenggong of Johore was traditionally the third highest official\n\nwithin the Johor Sultanate, and he possessed a hereditary fiefdom whose extent was described\n\nthus: “[t]he immediate sway of the Temenggong of Johore ran from Pontian around Cape\n\nRumenia to Sedili Besar.” (See Winstedt R.O., A History of Johore (1992 reprint), at p. 102,\n\nattached to this Memorial as Annex 185.) If Peak Rock is said to belong to the Temenggong, it\n\ncould also be said to belong to the Rajah of Johore as he was the overlord of the Temenggong.\n\n– Page 36 –position, it was too far from any mainland and inaccessible at certain times of\n\n63\n\nthe year .\n\n5.22 It was not until 1846 that Governor Butterworth changed his mind and\n\nagreed that Horsburgh Lighthouse should be built on Pedra Branca 64.\n\n5.23 Following this, both the Government of India and the Court of Directors\n\nin London approved of the construction of the Horsburgh Li ghthouse on Pedra\n\nBranca.The Court of Directors also agreed that a levy be imposed for the\n\npurposes of funding the construction an d maintenance of the lighthouse and\n\ndirected that the lighthouse should be built of stone 65.\n\n5.24 Thereafter, the full attention of the Government of the Straits Settlements\n\nwas brought to bear on the issue of constructing the lighthouse on Pedra\n\nBranca. On 21 June 1847, Thomas Chur ch, Resident Councillor at Singapore,\n\ninstructed Thomson, the Government Su rveyor, to submit plans and estimates\n\nfor the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse 66.Thomson replied on 9 July\n\n1847 with a description of Pedra Br anca and some preliminary plans and\n\nestimates .67\n\n63 See Letter from Butterworth W.J.

In his words:\n\n“Peak rock being 33 feet above the level of spring tides, is\n\nsomewhat higher than Pedra Bran ca, and being close inshore, the\n\neffects of the sea during the nort h-east monsoon are not so heavy\n\nupon it.I had, consequently, after observing the action of the\n\nwaves at the worst season, deemed it sufficient for the former, to\n\nhave merely the lower part of th e Light-house tower to the height\n\nof sixteen feet of granite ashlar, and the rest of brick work, but on\n\nbeing called upon for plans and es timates of a building on Pedra\n\nBranca, it was necessary to pause before deciding, as it might be\n\nfairly anticipated that the action of the waves would be heavier on\n\nits lower surface and more exposed position I.therefore\n\nrecommended to the authorities, that before the coming on of the\n\nensuing N.E. monsoon, brick pillar s should be erected on various\n\nparts of Pedra Branca, in order to test the force of the waves, and\n\nthis was accordingly done on the 1st November, 1847. ”68\n\nThe erection of the brick pillars was carried out und er the instructions and\n\nsupervision of Thomson, and with the knowledge and approval of Governor\n\n69\n\nButterworth .\n\n5.26 Concurrently, the Government of India obtained the approval of the Court\n\nof Directors of the East India Compa ny for the imposition of a levy to fund the\n\nconstruction of and to maintain the lighthouse. On 5 September 1849, the Court\n\nof Directors wrote to Governor Butterworth giving their approval for the levying\n\nof a duty as soon as the lighthouse was illuminated.\n\n68 See Thomson’s Account, supra note 6, at pp. 390-391.\n\n69 See Letter from Butterworth W.J. (Governor of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore and Malacca)\n\nto Beadon C. (Under Secretary to the Government of Bengal) dated 1 Oct 1847, attached to this\n\nMemorial as Annex 24.\n\n– Page 38 –5.27 The letter dated 5 September 1849 fo rms part of a sequence of letters\n\nwhich confirm that the bulk of the expens e of construction wa s to be borne by\n\nthe Government. This letter explains the interacting considerations very clearly:\n\n“2.The increased charge has b een occasioned by the selection\n\n(made after communication with the Lords of the Admiralty) of the\n\nIsland of Pedra Branca instead of Peak Rock, as the site of the\n\nLight House, the former being no t only much more distant from\n\nSingapore and much less accessible, but being also so much more\n\nexposed to the influence of th e waves during the North East\n\nMonsoon, as to render it absolute ly necessary that the structure\n\nshould be ‘entirely faced with gr anite set in cement’, with a back\n\nwork of Masonry instead of bein g composed of brick and Chunan\n\nMaterials which would have suffi ced on Peak Rock which is\n\nsituated on the Northern Shore of the Straits.\n\n3. The subscriptions hitherto received for the Light House amount\n\nto R s.22,194 leaving a deficit of R s.28,723, which you propose\n\nshould be advanced by Governme nt, and to ensure repayment of\n\nthis loan, you further pr opose that the duty authorized by us to be\n\nlevied on Vessels touching at Singapore or clearing out from\n\nIndian ports to China or the East ward of Singapore, should be\n\nraised from one rupee to two dollars or 4½ rupees per 100 tons.\n\n4.As the smaller rate would be quite inadequate to meet the\n\nexpenses of a Light House on Pedr a Branca and as there seems no\n\nmore unobjectionable mode of pr oviding for its construction and\n\nmaintenance than the imposition of a suitable tonnage duty on\n\nshipping, we authorize you to levy a duty as soon as a light is\n\nexhibited on that Station: but as we have no doubt that the\n\nexpenses will exceed the amount you have estimated we direct that\n\na Tonnage duty of 2½ Dollars 70 r 100 Tons be levied on the\n\nShipping above described.”\n\n5.28 The consequence was that the Unde r Secretary to the Government of\n\nIndia transmitted a copy of the despatch of 5 September 18 49 to the Under\n\nSecretary of the Government of Bengal in a letter dated 27 October 1849. This\n\nletter (and its enclosure from the Court of Directors) was accordingly forwarded\n\n70 See Letter from the Court of Directors of the East India Company to the Governor General of\n\nIndia in Council dated 5 Sep 1849, attached to this Memorial as Annex 31.\n\n– Page 39 –by the Government of Bengal to Governor Butterworth under cover of a letter\n\n71\n\ndated 12 November 1849 .\n\n5.29 These documents make it abundan tly clear that the decision for the\n\nfunding, construction, and location of the lighthouse on Pedra Branca was taken\n\nby the Government of India and the British Crown.\n\n5.30 Behind the series of events summar ised above lies the consideration of\n\nthe public interest in safe navigati on from the South China Sea through the\n\nStraits of Singapore and vice versa and of ships using Singapore as a port of call\n\nbefore proceeding onwards through the South China Sea to China and through\n\nthe Malacca Straits. The original public meeting of merchants and mariners in\n\nCanton, at which the propo sal to raise a lighthouse on Pedra Branca was first\n\nmade, was concerned to commemorate Horsburgh precisely because of his\n\nvalued work in improving the naviga tion of the seas between India and\n\nChina. The construction of the lighthouse in the most helpful place was a logical\n\nextension of the work of the famous hydrographer.\n\n5.31 Pedra Branca had long presented se rious dangers to shipping. Thomson\n\nprovides a list of casualties in the peri od June 1824 to September 1851. The\n\ntotal was 25 and sh ips of seven different nationalities were involved. Thomson\n\nintroduces his account of the dangers with the following passage:\n\n“The proximity of Pedra Branca has long been noted for its danger\n\nto shipping, and as the commerce of the Eastern settlements has\n\nincreased, so have the losses become more numerousT . he\n\nfollowing list of casualties, extr acted from the Singapore journals,\n\n71 See Letter from the Court of Directors of the East India Company to the Governor General of\n\nIndia in Council dated 5 Sep 1849 attached to this Memorial as Annex 31; Letter from Grey W.\n\n(Under Secretary to the Government of Indito Seton Karr W.

It is not offered as\n\nbeing at all complete in its notice of minor accidents, for in many\n\nof these cases there was probably no report made to the editors. In\n\nthe cases of stranding or total loss, I believe none have escaped my\n\nattention, as I carefully exam ined all the Singapore journals\n\npublished since 1824 with referen ce to this subject. Between the\n\nyears 1824 and 1839 inclusive, 5 total wrecks occurred; one vessel\n\nwas stranded and 3 minor accidents took place; while between the\n\nyears 1841 and 1851 incl usive, 11 total wrecks occurred, if we\n\ninclude the Metropolis, which was water-logged and abandoned by\n\nthe crew, thus averaging one vessel per annum; during this period\n\n1 vessel was stranded and 4 minor ac cidents also took place.It\n\nwould be impossible at this time to estimate the amount of\n\nproperty lost in these vessels. In the Dourado al one there were\n\n500,000 Spanish dollars sunk to the bottom; while there was on\n\nboard the Sylph, when she was stranded, opium to the value of\n\n557,200 Spanish dollars, and a lthough most was saved, the\n\naccident to her must have created large loss to the owners of the\n\ncargo in paying for salvage, and by the loss of time, market, &c.;\n\nmost of the other vessels in the list will be seen to have been large,\n\nand to have contained valuable cargoes.” 72\n\n5.32 Whilst the strong public intere st lying behind the proposals for a\n\nlighthouse in the region was evident from the outset, it is clear that all sides\n\nassumed the necessity of government f unding (see paragrap hs 5.60 to 5.65\n\nbelow). However, there were certain mo dalities which had to be decided upon\n\nby the Government of India. The first of these was the choice of the site for the\n\nlighthouse, and the second was the decision on the method of public funding.\n\n72 See Thomson’s Account, supra note 6, at p. 385.\n\n– Page 41 – B. T HE C HOICE OF PEDRA B RANCA AS THE S ITE OF THE LIGHTHOUSE\n\n5.33 The ultimate choice of the Govern ment of India, and the Court of\n\nDirectors of the East India Company, was to build the lighthouse on Pedra\n\nBranca, but this decision was preceded by a substantial discussion of other sites\n\nand, in particular, of Peak Rock. The process of selection was pursued by the\n\nrepresentatives of the British Government exclusively.\n\n5.34 The first item consists of the lett er from Sir Edward Belcher to Governor\n\nButterworth, dated 1 October 1844. In response to the Governor’s request for\n\nadvice as to a suitable site for a lighthouse, Sir Edward Belcher writes:\n\n“In reply to your communication No . 109 and bearing date April\n\n20th 1844, requesting an opinion upon the most eligible position\n\nfor a Light House in th e Straits of Singapore.I have after very\n\nmature consideration and also from a recent special survey, come\n\nto the conclusion: That in pursuance of the intent of the vote to\n\nerect a Testimonial to the hydro grapher James Horsburgh Esq., I\n\nam firmly of opinion that it wo uld lend more to the general\n\ninterests of navigation if such Testimonial stood upon a position\n\nwhere its benefit would be generallyuseful to navigation of the\n\nChina Seas as well as these Straits.\n\nFor the latter object, nature speci ally presents the Romania outer\n\nisland as the most eligible site by affording the means of distinctly\n\navoiding night dangers, and thus enabling vessels to sail to and\n\nfrom Singapore with confidence as well as security.\n\nFrom a slight inspection of the chart of the Straits, you will\n\nperceive that a line drawn from the centre of the outer Romania\n\nIsland to the tail of Johore Bank wo uld nearly eclipse the light by\n\nthe intervention of the nearer Land. Vessels have no business near\n\nthis line as is frequently practised in our British Light Houses, it is\n\nvery easy to screen the light to the safe line so as to warn vessels in\n\n– Page 42 – time to shape a safe course. Th e law being either on entering or\n\nquitting the Straits to ‘keep the Light in sight’.” 73\n\n5.35 The “Romania outer island” can only be Peak Rock as the contemporary\n\nsurvey map by Thomson himself demonstrates. See Map 9, after page 36 above.\n\n5.36 As shown in Chapter II (see, in particular, paragraphs 2.14 to 2.17), Pedra\n\nBranca is not part of the Romania Group of islands. This is also confirmed by\n\nThomson, who states that:\n\n“I received official intimation fro m the Hon’ble T. Church… in a\n\nletter dated 21st June, 1847, that the Government had determined\n\non erecting the Horsburgh Light-house on Pedra Branca, instead of\n\non Peak rock, which belongs to the Romania group; for which\n\nposition I had furnished plans and estimates in November, 1844.” 74\n\n5.37 In light of Belcher’s advice, Governor Butterworth instructed Thomson to\n\nexamine Peak Rock and provide an estimate of costs of building a\n\nlighthouse. The report, prepared by Thomson and dated 20 November 1844, is\n\nunequivocal on the point that it is Peak Rock in the Romania group which is in\n\nissue.\n\n5.38 The following passages from the report are of particular relevance:\n\n“In accordance with your instruc tions that I sh ould proceed and\n\nexamine Peak Rock Ro mania in order to as certain the probable\n\ncost of building a Light House ther eon, of a construction fitted for\n\nthe situation and whose price shou ld not exceed the limited funds,\n\nthat have been subscribed for its erection – also to estimate the cost\n\nof laying a substantial base suited to bear a superstructure of sheet\n\niron and further to make the plans (as far as practicable with the\n\nlimited sum allowed) in conform ity with the recommendation of\n\nSir Edward Belcher viz ‘that the Li ght house should be based as a\n\n73 See Letter from Belcher E.

Consequently, the request for permission addressed to the\n\nTemenggong to build a lighthouse on a partic ular rock must have indicated that\n\nthe chosen site was Peak Rock. In his report to Gove rnor Butterworth, dated 20\n\nNovember 1844, Thomson refers to the factthatPeakRockwasnotBritish\n\nterritory. In paragraph 6 of the letter Thomson observes that Peak Rock:\n\n“… on reference to the chart will be seen intervening the shores of\n\na country under the rule of independent Malay chiefs.” 77\n\n5.42 In the subsequent period, and unt il August 1846, the project to build on\n\nPeak Rock was maintained in principle. In a lette r dated 15 October 1845, the\n\nCourt of Directors of the East India Company adopted the proposal to build a\n\nlighthouse on Peak Rock and authorised the levying of light dues at Singapore\n\nand in India in order to provide the necessary funds. 78\n\n5.43 In April 1845, the Superintendent of Marine in Bengal raised the question\n\nof preferring Pedra Branca as a site fo r a lighthouse.In response Governor\n\nButterworth reported on 22 August 1845 that:\n\n“The number of vessels that have been wrecked in the vicinity of\n\nPedra Branca and Point Romania at the opening of the China Sea\n\nimperatively call for a Light H ouse in that neighbourhood and\n\nthere can be little doubt that the fo rmer would be the best possible\n\nposition for one as far as the light is concerned, but it is so remote\n\nfrom Singapore, at so great a di stance from the Main Land and so\n\ninaccessible at certain seasons of the year that under all\n\ncircumstances I should give the pr eference to the position selected\n\n77 See Letter from Thomson J.T.
