        "text": "The 1956 Monaco Grand Prix was the first race of the 1956 Formula One World Championship and was held in Monte Carlo on May 13th 1956. Defending champion Jack Brabham took pole position and set the fastest lap on his debut for Gordini, but failed to finish. Desmond Titterington instead took his first victory as well as that of Lancia and Irish Racing Cars. Peter Collins finished second for B.C.M.A., with Juan Manuel Fangio taking third place on his return from injury, Ferrari's first podium since their return after the buy-out by Simone Bizzarri.\n\nBackground\n\nBritish Commonwealth Motorsports Association\n\nThe government-backed B.C.M.A. outfit was undoubtedly the best new team last year, and certainly the most consistent, scoring six podiums when no one else managed more than three, their crowning moment being a 1-3 finish at their home race. The choice of Peter Collins and Tony Brooks proved inspired, and they scored a well-deserved entrants' title. This year, with their tried-and-tested combination from last year and the addition of Mike Hawthorn as third driver in place of Umberto Maglioli, they're hoping to add another three titles to their collection, and they're well capable of achieving their target.\n\nAlfa Romeo SpA\n\nAfter a couple years away from week-in-week-out success (whilst still winning races from time to time), Alfa Romeo's new AR160 took the Italian manufacturer back to the forefront, winning the constructors' title with the help of the private Renzo team and driver Jack Brabham, who won the drivers' title. This year, however, Brabham left after one season for pastures new, leaving the aging Giuseppe Farina to lead the team once more. Tony Gaze returns for one more year, whilst Porfirio Rubirosa comes over from Gordini. The car is the same as last year's, so success should still be there.\n\nAlexander Racing Team-Gordini\n\nThe French team managed to overcome at least part of its unreliability issue, getting a car to the finish in all but one race, even getting two cars to the chequered flag on three occasions. This year, Gordini have a new car ready, and it seems very quick indeed. If it's more reliable than its predecessor, the Type 56 will be a serious contender. Not content with a quick car, Gordini pulled off the best move of the off-season by signing reigning World Drivers' Champion Jack Brabham alongside the perennial Consalvo Sanesi. Rather surprisingly, Robert Manzon left the team to join O.S.C.A., leaving the third seat empty for many weeks. A short while before Monaco, the final driver was announced to be sportscar ace Eugenio Castellotti, who gets his first real shot at F1 fame.\n\nTeam Lotus\n\nFollowing a major falling out with Jaguar, Aston Martin sold their Formula One assets to Colin Chapman's Lotus outfit, whilst Jaguar sold their assets to Coventry-Climax. It appeared that the two manufacturers, under their new names, would compete together once more, but a series of baffling decisions by Climax caused Lotus to strike out on their own with a new car, the Lotus 10, powered by B.C.M.A. engines. As for drivers, the usual suspects of Bira, van der Lof and Trintignant return to the cockpit, with the notable absence of 1953 World Champion, Tony Bettenhausen, who was let go after a season in which he failed to finish a single race. Bettenhausen instead headed to Ferrari's five-car outfit.\n\nOfficine Specializzate Costruzione Automobili\n\nLast year, Scuderia Anglo-Italia's progress was there, but not nearly as big as the team had hoped. Moss, Gonzalez and Whitehead each scored podiums, but that first victory still eluded them. As a result, Bentley lost interest in the team, leaving the assets for O.S.C.A. to control. Immediately, O.S.C.A. announced the design of a new car, the F156, quickly revised into the F156A, with a new 1500S-56 engine quickly following. Moss, Whitehead and Gonzalez stay on, while the fourth seat (vacant for the end of 1955) is filled by Robert Manzon, who sensationally left Gordini after 6 seasons of service. O.S.C.A., once again, are in prime position to take their first win as a constructor after Alberto Ascari finally took the O.S.C.A. engine to victory in Reims.\n\nIrish Racing Association\n\nLast year, IRA were described as \"promising\". Now, they're full-on contenders, with the now well proven Lancia D50 and rising star Desmond Titterington teaming up for one more year, with Duncan Hamilton on full-time as well and local legend Joe Flynn signing on for the Irish Grand Prix. Their success from last year was the catalyst behind said Irish Grand Prix reaching the calendar at the Wicklow Circuit, already the home of the Leinster Trophy for Formula Libre. This year, they're also gaining some extra cash by loaning their cars to other teams, such as Coventry-Climax in Monaco.\n\nHampshire Racing Alliance\n\nOnly appearing this early through a stroke of pure luck, David Hampshire picked the perfect moment to have his one good race of the season, doing so in Reims where attrition was so high that only six cars finished, Dave finishing second behind the late Alberto Ascari. Despite this result exempting him from prequalifying for the rest of the season, neither Hampshire nor his teammate and friend Roy Salvadori could reach the grid again. This year, Dave used his hard-earned prize money to acquire some Vanwall equipment as well as some O.S.C.A. engines. for both himself and Salvadori. With Dave himself looking to retire in the near future, it's up to Salvadori to step up and build up experience.\n\nScuderia Ferrari\n\nFerrari's 1955 was a veritable rollercoaster. Enzo got into financial trouble early on, but was telling everyone that he was protesting new regulations. No matter the reason, Simone Bizzarri stepped in with a sizable amount of cash, and Ferrari was back on the Formula 1 circuit by the Scottish Grand Prix. Over the final three races, Ferrari scored four points, and entered a six-car super-team in Monza, giving Philippe Etancelin and Guido Meregalli one final go at Formula One. For 1956, Ferrari have wheeled out a completely new design (after what was rumoured to be a very hefty development cost) and announced a five-car team, comprising Hernando da Silva Ramos, Paco Godia (staying on from last year), Juan Manuel Fangio (returning after two years off from injury), Tony Bettenhausen (sacked by Lotus) and Phil Hill (a young sportscar driver making his début).\n\nVanwall\n\nAside from Mike Hawthorn's fourth place in France and Dennis Poore's, erm, poor performances, the main story to come out of 1955 for Vanwall was team boss Tony Vandervell's outspoken hatred of all things communist, refusing to attend the Soviet Grand Prix and even creating (and selling) statues and board games with symbolic depictions of Vandervell himself crushing communism. This is the man who ordered the creation of a new chassis, the VW56. When Hawthorn left for B.C.M.A. and Poore was cast aside, Vandervell had to find a driver. After Collins, Brooks and Lewis-Evans turned down the offers, it's rookie Cliff Allison who will be leading the team for 1956.\n\nBernie C. Ecclestone\n\nWith race winner Hernando da Silva Ramos in his ranks, Bernie should have done better than he did. But instead, after one single incident, he fired the Brazilian and instead hired his friend Stuart Lewis-Evans to take on the drive, which seemed like a big risk, considering Lewis-Evans' total lack of F1 experience. But Stuart adapted quickly, and after a rocky start, scored a shock sixth place in Estonia, taking advantage of the controversial multiple race stoppages to gain ground on rivals. With Stuart gone to drive for Coventry-Climax, Bernie had to find someone else, but ultimately couldn't. As of writing, Ecclestone will be competing on his own in 1956.\n\nEcurie Voeckler\n\nThe French team's season was more disappointing than they'd hoped, entering proven Alfa Romeo machinery for a rotating cast of drivers including André Simon, Louis Chiron, Toulo de Graffenried, Jean-Louis Rosier and Clemar Bucci. They only rarely qualified, the best result being 8th place for Rosier in Italy. Following this disappointing season and following issues with the legality of their involvement with Ferrari and Renzo (which disappeared completely), Voeckler turned to becoming a privateer, hoping to enter cars in various races in Western Europe. No drivers have been signed of yet, but André Simon is slated to come back once again.\n\nState Committee for Sports and Body Culture of USSR\n\nFollowing a successful (if not convincing) appearance in the Soviet Grand Prix, organised in Estonia by none other than themselves, the USSR Committee for Sports have not yet completely announced a return this year, but rumours are flying around that they may once again send a presence to one championship round, most likely the East German Grand Prix, as East Germany is, of course, a communist country. As previously mentioned, no concrete plans have as of yet been announced, though.\n\nJulius Kubinsky\n\nSee above. Jaroslav Vlcek certainly didn't disgrace himself in Tallinn, and is therefore interested in returning to F1 on the occasion of the East German Grand Prix. Like the official USSR team, he has not as of yet announced any concrete plans, but he is certainly weighing up his options to do so.\n\nReatherson Racing Developments\n\nThe Irish team had promise in large amounts going into 1955, with capable machinery and the help of Lance Macklin and Ken Wharton. In the end, Macklin qualified for all four of his races, but proved to be immensely frustrating, suffering countless accidents. Costly accidents. With financial issues, Reatherson brought an end to his season after the Scottish Grand Prix, and following his involvement with the Le Mans disaster and another fatal crash at Dundrod, Lance Macklin put an end to his career. Suddenly, Ferrari stepped in to help Reatherson, offering subsidised brand new cars to the private entry, as well as the services of drivers Cesare Perdisa and Giulio Cabianca. With a new lease of life, Reatherson have a solid base on which to improve.\n\nEscuderia Hernandez\n\nHernandez were certainly ambitious last year, deciding to field a team based out of Argentina, which effectively ruled out return trips running on a relatively small budget. Miraculously, they survived the year, despite not making a single race start, although Federico Hernandez seems to have a fair bit of outside help from FIAT. This year, plans have changed once again. Their Cooper T41 will still be in use, powered by a brand new Gordini engine, whilst FIAT managed to obtain plans to a stillborn Ferrari chassis, which they have rebadged the F56. No one is exactly sure how the two will tie in together, but Hernandez himself, after losing the interest of Roberto Mières, signed polo player Carlos Menditéguy to drive the car.\n\nEcurie Maghreb\n\nThere's no reason for this team to exist. They were founded following the announcement of the Moroccan Grand Prix achieving world championship status, with the sole goal of raising public support for the event by entering local drivers Robert la Caze and André Guelfi for a full season (although only Guelfi ever drove the car). However, when the Moroccan Grand Prix (along with the Dutch, German and Portuguese rounds) got canceled following the Le Mans tragedy, Maghreb were left without a purpose, and were severely bitter about the race not being rescheduled as an F1 event for 1956. Nonetheless, they persevered, selling off their Lancia to purchase a second-hand AAC 555 (a rebadged 1953 Ferrari), entering it for Louis Chiron as main driver, with Guelfi staying on as back-up. At least they have the funds to last the year.\n\nBrits Under No European Legislation\n\nThis team with an absurdly long and convoluted name have been a controversial presence in the sport since their inception. The team refuse to run anything but female drivers and express public disappointment in any female driver who turns down their offers. They have failed to show any sort of competence in terms of properly preparing cars or indeed choosing the right cars. Bearing this in mind, it came as a giant shock to most people in the racing world when Maria Teresa de Filippis, who had just come off the back of a season in which she scored three points, signed for the Northern Irish team. Many people regard this as a career-killing move for her, seeing Escuderia Hernandez as a more logical option. Pat Moss has also decided to stay on for another part-time shot, although her lack of experience showed. Stirling Moss being her brother helped at first, but the authorities are thinking of revoking her licence...\n\nBritish Racing Motors\n\nWhat a rollercoaster this off-season has been for BRM! Last year, they decided to start as a private entry in order to gain experience. This backfired massively for unclear reasons, although the team management (namely Alfred Owen) put the blame squarely on the shoulders of driver Kenneth McAlpine. Either way, they quickly decided to take matters into their own hands, building a new car, the P25. However, soon after the completion of the first cars, Owen left the team. Enter BERO. British Empire Racing Organisation was a small-time team interested in joining the sport for 1956, having previously signed some deals with Ferrari. However, soon after Owen announced his departure from BRM, it was announced that instead of striking out on their own, BERO would be taking over the Bourne operation. Ron Flockhart was signed as lead driver, with Paul Frère and Horace Gould taking part-time roles. Jean Behra will join them on occasion after an agreement with Scuderia Centro Sud.\n\nOfficine Alfieri Maserati\n\nLet's face it. Maserati are done. They've been done for years now. And yet they refuse to die. And on top of this, they've been given a new lease on life in the form of a dropped Ferrari engine design, generously sold to Maserati at reduced price. No matter the problems with it, the 56A is undeniably better than their previous 200F engine, and they still have the allegedly competitive Cooper T41 to put it in. With the young and ambitious Lucien Bianchi hired to drive the car, Maserati might just yet survive for a little while longer.\n\nScuderia Adriatica\n\nThis new team based in Bari appeared towards the middle of 1955, purchasing an old Ambrosiana and acquiring the services of Lucien Bianchi. Entering the British and Italian Grands Prix, Bianchi failed to clear prequalifying on both occasions, but showed decent amounts of promise nonetheless. This led to a partnership with Ferrari for the 1956 season, in which Adriatica will enter two brand new R560 packages for the handpicked Dorino Serafini and Gerino Gerini. If they stay realistic, they should first be looking to regularly qualify.\n\nEcurie Ecosse\n\nAfter a tentative go at the Scottish Grand Prix last year with David Murray driving, Ecurie Ecosse plan to return once more in 1956 as a privateer, this time branching out to the British and Irish Grands Prix. Hoping to enter a Cooper-Climax if one can be found, they planned on hiring Ron Flockhart for those races, but the Scotsman eventually signed for BRM. There haven't been any announcements concerning potential replacements, but David Murray already planned on stepping back into the car for the Scottish race, so he might take on the role for all three rounds.\n\nJonkheer Gijsbert van Loon\n\nNo one knows how this has happened, but Dutch nobleman Gijsbert van Loon has not only managed to survive until 1956, he's managed to actually sell cars! After purchasing the rights to the Guidobaldi FG01 and the old Aqua engine, he's managed to sell off a few cars to customers and secure the funds for a full year's racing. Much like in Monza last season, the safe pair of hands of Hans Tak will be behind the wheel. The whole world watches on in fear.\n\nScuderia Centro Sud\n\nGuglielmo Dei, better known as Mimmo, is an Italian Maserati dealer who decided that he would use his connections to the Maserati brothers to launch a Formula One team. Coming from Rome, he named his team after the rough position of Rome in Italy, and pulled some strings to secure a supply of O.S.C.A. machinery for a handful of private entries in 1956. To do so, he has recruited the experienced Luigi Villoresi, the journeyman Jean Behra and the rookies Giorgio Scalatti and Masten Gregory. Neither of them have huge expectations on their shoulders, so this low-pressure environment should help the team grow.\n\nAsso di Fiori\n\nThis team have certainly had one of the most volatile histories of any team yet. Founded as Scuderia Commesso in 1951 and originally a constructor, they employed the services of the likes of Georges Grignard, Chico Landi, Louis Chiron, Rudi Fischer, Luigi Villoresi and Troy Ruttman, but are perhaps most notable for launching the Formula One careers of Tony Gaze and Dries van der Lof. Changing their name to Asso di Fiori in 1953, they scored two podiums and won the non-championship Syracuse Grand Prix in 1954 before missing the 1955 season. They intended to enter Onofre Marimón in the Italian Grand Prix, although plans failed to materialise. This year, they have confirmed their return, using a new O.S.C.A. package, with Onofre Marimón's paddock return confirmed.\n\nClaus Simon Schlusser\n\nNot much is known about this Bavarian enthusiast. Based in Munich, he decided to use his limited funds to purchase a Guidobaldi-Loonmotor package to enter the East German Grand Prix. This last fact is what attracted attention to his entry, as soon after this announcement, it was announced that Travis \"Spider\" Webb would be driving the car. It was soon rumoured that this partnership offer didn't come from Schlusser but rather from Webb, possibly helped by some 'encouraging words' from the American government. As Webb had previously attempted the Soviet Grand Prix last year with Hernandez (though he never got to hit the track), the paddock is wondering about Webb's knack of finding himself entered in races in communist countries, especially given that his American career is all but over.\n\nEquipo Castelldefels\n\nIt's getting increasingly obvious that this team has no idea what they're doing. The Spanish team run by small-time businessman and garage owner Manuel Bautista has been around since 1950 and involved in motorsport since last year, deciding to enter Formula One this year. With no relations to speak of and a tight budget, he insisted on entering two cars, and therefore purchased two Guidobaldi-Loonmotor packages. As for the drivers, he got a better deal, acquiring the services of Alfonso de Portago, who are relatively experienced, if not entirely impressive. At the very least, this team should be interesting to watch.\n\nCooper Car Company\n\nWho really knows what exactly is happening at Cooper? No one seems to, not even the people at Cooper themselves. After the poorly thought-out plan of outsourcing the design of a chassis (the T41) to a number of teams, which, while it produced a decent chassis, bankrupted three of the participating teams (Australasia, Tasman and ENB), Cooper have returned as a full-on factory team based in Surbiton. Retaining a privileged relationship with Maserati, the team will nonetheless be using a Climax engine in one car, a Maserati in the other. Reg Parnell and Harry Schell are set to drive the two cars, with budding sportscar ace Olivier Gendebien signed as a reserve driver.\n\nCoventry Climax\n\nCoventry Climax had a tumultuous entry into Formula One to say the least. Following Jaguar's withdrawal from its Formula One operation, Climax stepped in to take on the assets and continue to supply customers as well as Lotus, the new incarnation of the Aston Martin works team. However, through a series of baffling moves, Climax spent over 90% of their budget attempting to design and build a decent engine. This lack of financial foresight led Lotus' Colin Chapman to break all ties with Climax and acquire B.C.M.A. engines instead, forcing Climax to rely on customer teams, such as Cooper. In order to pick up more money, they have also decided to enter a few races in their own right, first of all in Monaco. Their development driver, Stuart Lewis-Evans, is to drive a Lancia D50 owned by IRA, powered by the Climax engine.\n\nMSG Köthen\n\nFollowing the departure of Group Ultimate and the likely disappearance of Balkan Eagle, MSG Köthen has appeared to fill the spot of the token Eastern Bloc team. Until now, MSG Köthen had entered Formula 3 and sportscar events, but the announcement of an East German Grand Prix for the 1956 season, prompted the team to find some funds and purchase, with the backing of the local government, an O.S.C.A. package for use in a handful of races. Having competed in the Soviet Grand Prix last year and having driven for the team in the past, Theo Fitzau was hired as the team's driver.\n\nTheodore Yip\n\nTeddy Yip is a businessman born in what is now Indonesia, has Dutch nationality and now resides in Hong Kong. He is also the driving force behind the Macau Grand Prix. Confused yet? Well, anyways, this increasingly rich man with an obvious passion for motorsport heard about the upcoming Thai Grand Prix to be run in December following the inexorable rise in popularity of Prince Birabongse Bhanudej Bhanubandh (or B. Bira). The world-class status of this event is a major selling point for Yip, who is planning on entering two cars to the event for some of his own Macau Grand Prix's biggest stars.\n\nPredicting a winning driver will not be easy. No single driver has won here more than once in a championship race, and five of the six winners are here this weekend: Giuseppe Farina, Robert Manzon, Reg Parnell, Jack Brabham and Dries van der Lof. Only André Simon, the 1952 winner, is absent. On top of this, Louis Chiron is also in the field, having won the race a full 25 years ago.\n\n42 drivers were originally entered for this event, but after various teams pulled out (most notable Alfa Romeo), this was reduced to a total of 35.\n\nRace weekend\n\nPre-qualifying\n\nThe expected frontrunners easily make the cut, as do Menditéguy and Allison. Bianchi fails to make the cut for Maserati, but gets closer than they ever did last year. All three BRMs fail, as does Gerini for Adriatica.\n\nAlso, Hans Tak was 24 seconds down on Fangio.\n\nQualifying\n\nAs was very much expected, the Gordini is right at the top with defending world champion Jack Brabham taking the second pole position of his career. Behind him, B.C.M.A. are once again major players, as are Lotus (ex-JAMR), IRA, O.S.C.A. and the rejuvenated Ferrari team, with Paco Godia lining up third on the grid.\n\nNo driver from a major team fails to qualify, but conversely, no driver other than one from a major team does. All 20 spots are filled up by just six teams, none of them privateer. That is, unless you count IRA as being a private team, but seeing as they essentially have control of all Lancias in circulation, that wouldn't be fair.\n\nRace\n\nPeter Collins took the lead at the start and led the first lap while van der Lof and Castelotti gained the most ground. On lap 2, Brabham took the lead back from Collins and Bettenhausen reached third place behind Collins. On lap 4, Sanesi and Titterington tangled at Tabac over fifth place, resulting in Sanesi's retirement. Collins continued to threaten Brabham's lead, and finally took over the top spot on lap 6. His teammate Brooks, after a bad start, crawled his way back into a points paying position while Bettenhausen was holding up everyone else. Stirling Moss then made a bid for that sixth position, taking it on lap 10. On the next lap, Phil Hill and Eugenio Castellotti tangled over second-last position. Hill squeezed Castellotti into the wall, causing the Italian's retirement. At that moment, Godia passed Bettenhausen and Moss passed Titterington, taking third and fifth respectively.\n\nOn lap 12, Bettenhausen passed Godia and Brabham to take second place, followed by Stirling Moss. On the next lap, Moss' teammate Peter Whitehead suffers an engine failure, becoming the first mechanical retirement of the season. On lap 16, Brabham passed Moss and almost collided with Bettenhausen, ultimately settling for third place for the time being. Behind this incident, Moss and Godia swerved into each other, resulting in Moss spinning and stalling his car. Reports that Godia was given a signal the previous lap and gave one back the next lap may or may not be substantiated.\n\nBettenhausen and Brabham's fight for second place was the main point of interest at this point, as Peter Collins remained in a short lead...until lap 22, when he started having to defend from Brabham and Bettenhausen. On the following lap, Brabham was in the lead, with Bettenhausen behind. On lap 24, Bettenhausen passed Brabham and took the race lead for Ferrari. Four laps later, Collins took the lead once again, while Brabham dropped to fourth behind Godia. Then, Bettenhausen and Godia tangled over second place. Godia confirmed his hard-'earned' reputation by spinning out as a result. This all allowed Collins to extend his race lead over Bettenhausen and Trintignant, who passed Brabham on lap 31. Two laps later, Collins made his life much harder by spinning at Sainte-Dévote, allowing Bettenhausen and Trintignant to catch him. Collins took the spin in his stride, however, and immediately started to extend his lead again.\n\nThe fight for second expanded, with Titterington, Ramos and Brooks catching up. This battle wouldn't be able to last extremely long without turning dirty, and indeed, on lap 39, Brooks and Trintignant had a coming together at the Gasworks. The Frenchman ended off worse, finishing his race in the hay bales. After 40 laps, Collins led from Bettenhausen, who had just passed Titterington. Brooks was fourth, ahead of Brabham, Ramos, González, Bira, Hill, van der Lof, Manzon, Fangio, Hamilton and Hawthorn.\n\nRamos suddenly retired, spinning out on oil from Whitehead's engine failure, reducing the field to 13 drivers. This was reduced to 12 on lap 45 when Hawthorn's B.C.M.A. pulled into the pits with a suspension failure. 9 laps later, Duncan Hamilton punted Phil Hill into retirement at Mirabeau, leaving 11 drivers still running, then 10 when Brabham ran over debris at Tabac. The resulting puncture damaged the car too badly for him to continue. Over the next few laps, the order was jumbled up massively thanks to the close fights up and down the field. On lap 62, Bettenhausen finally caved in and let Bira through into second place, then Titterington and Brooks. Bira started progressively catching Collins and reached him on lap 68.\n\nTony Bettenhausen promptly decided to throw his Ferrari off the road at Sainte-Dévote. But it was Bira who took the spotlight away, taking the lead on that same 68th lap. Unfortunately, he wouldn't hold on to it, as on the very next lap, his gearbox failed right in front of the Casino. He promptly got out of his car and entered the establishment, where he reportedly spent the best part of the evening. Titterington was in pursuit, followed by Brooks and Fangio, both of which quickly passed him. However, on lap 70, Brooks ran over debris and span into the straw from the resulting puncture, leaving only seven drivers in the race. Collins in the lead, Fangio a close second, Titterington an equally close third. Manzon, van der Lof, González and Hamilton were the other remaining drivers.\n\nFangio was finally close enough to make a move on lap 76, but Collins managed to defend his position. However, this allowed Titterington to catch up and join the battle for the lead. Despite some brilliant defending, Collins finally let Titterington through into the lead on lap 87. Titterington continued to expand his lead, while Fangio began to have car issues, preventing him from fighting for the win or even second place. Dries van der Lof retired on lap 96 with an engine failure, leaving six drivers for six points positions. But nothing else happened, and Desmond Titterington calmly finished the race and scored his maiden Grand Prix victory! Peter Collins duly came home second, one lap down, followed by Juan Manuel Fangio, who scores a podium on his long-awaited comeback. Robert Manzon gets O.S.C.A.'s season off to a good, if unimpressive, start, finishing fourth, while Duncan Hamilton gets his first points. González scored the final point.\n\nClassification\n\nEntry list\n\nNo Driver Entrant Chassis Engine 2 B.
