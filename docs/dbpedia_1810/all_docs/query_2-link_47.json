        "text": "Chassis: 09389\n\nOriginally finished in Rosso Chiaro or Light Red with a beige leather interior, this 275 GTB/4 was originally dispatched to Belgian distributor Jacques Swaters. It was then shown on the stand of his company Garage Francorchamps during the 1967 Brussels Motor Show. In February of the same year, it was sold to its first private owner, J.J. Molenaar from The Netherlands. In 1972, it was acquired by fellow Dutchman and great Ferrari enthusiast Dries van der Lof. It had been repainted black, while bumper guards, fog lights and Campagnolo alloy wheels had also been added. The car would remain in the family after Van der Lof's passing in 1990 until it was finally sold to a third Dutch owner, Jos Koster in 2010. Some four years later, it joined a British collection of European sports cars. Never fully restored, it was Ferrari certified in 2015. Early in 2021, it was consigned together with the rest of the collection to Gooding's online-only European Sporting & Historic Collection sale.\n\nChassis details Manufactured in December 28, 1966 Engine number 09389 First owner J.J. Molenaar Most recent auction(s)\n\n2021 Gooding & Co. European Sporting & Historic Collection (Â£1,870,000)"
