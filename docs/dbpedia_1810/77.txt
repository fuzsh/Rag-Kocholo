I'm not sure my memory is accurate but I seem to recall the van der Lof car having been originated from a fairly minimal selection of surviving parts, while the V12 engine which went into it had spent some time - many years - in a factory compound not too far from a town named Maidenhead in England...

Mr. Dries van der Lof bought remaining parts from a UK Ferrari specialist who had bought it (along with other cars) in South America. Van der Lof bought a chassis, a completely disassembled engine and a body in part and in a very bad shape from which a new body was constructed. His car bears chassis #5.

It is in the family for years and was brought out at a meeting this september were it met his longer Indy brother: The Grant Piston Ring Spl.

I don't have a 104 in my records, but 102, 106 and 110 were all 1951 numberings...

I wonder if 104 was an earlier Landi car, with an engine smaller than 4.5 litres?

104 (or possibly 0104) was the first Landi Ferrari, the tipo 166 FL.
