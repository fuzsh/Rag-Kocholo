Wealthy businessman who manufactured electrical cable in Haaksbergen. Later owned an extensive classic car collection. Raced on until the 1980's in historics, but raced in rallies around the time of his F1 spell. Also known as Dries, van der Lof was entered with his seat paid for by the organisers to help drum up local interest. Dries got this opportunity due to his prowess not only in rallies but in national club events and had recently taken a class win in the Tulip Rally and a 1500cc sportscar victory at Zandvoort. Andre's granddaughter, Shirley, also raced, having a brief spell in German Formula 3 in the late 2000's.
