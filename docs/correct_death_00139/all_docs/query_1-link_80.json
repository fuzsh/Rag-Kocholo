        "text": "Activist and author Fatima Bhutto's visit to the temple after her nikah left social media divided with some users praising the gesture and others wondering what she was doing there\n\nFatima and her husband Graham Gibran sparked outrage on social media when they paid a visit to Karachi's old Mahadev Temple on Sunday as a tribute to Hindu Sindhis, who laid the foundations of Karachi in ancient times\n\nThe nikkah ceremony of Fatima Bhutto, 40, niece of slain former Pakistan PM Benazir Bhutto, and daughter of Murtaza Bhutto, took place at her grandfather’s library on Friday\n\nAccording to media reports, Fatima Butto’s husband is an American citizen. Accompanied by her brother Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Junior and Hindu leaders, Fatima and her husband, a Christian, poured milk over the deity as per rituals\n\nThe wedding news was shared on Twitter by Fatima's brother who goes by the same name as his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto with the caption, \"On behalf of our father, Shaheed Mir Murtaza Bhutto, and the Bhutto family, I’m very happy to share some happy news. My sister Fatima and Graham were married in an intimate nikkah ceremony yesterday at our home, 70 Clifton.\"\n\nFatima Bhutto tweeted, \"Yesterday, Graham and I married in a small nikkah ceremony in my family home, 70 Clifton.\" She further said that aside from Nikkah, they won't be having any other ceremonies. She wrote, \"I’m not one for opulent weddings but especially now it feels so inappropriate given what so many are struggling through.\"\n\nThe picture of the couple at the temple was shared by a user Saad Ahmad Khan on his Twitter account with the caption, \"She is @fbhutto niece of Benazir Bhutto and Grand daughter of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, once a ruling elite, with his brother and newly reverted Husband Gibran (formerly, Graham), Gibran might be thinking why even I converted if I have to do this all. Look at low self-esteem elites.\"\n\nIn the image circulating all over social media, Fatima and her husband can be seen pouring milk over the idol as per customs, accompanied by her brother Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Junior and Hindu dignitaries at the temple\n\nThe Bhutto family has remained a formidable force in Pakistan politics but has also been hit by several tragedies over the decades. Fatima's grandfather and the former Pakistan PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged by the late military dictator Zia ul Haq in April 1979 after a military coup"
