        "text": "Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was barely 19 when he inherited a role in a dynasty whose history is steeped in power and bloodshed.\n\nHe is the son of former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and murdered ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\n\nThree days after his mother's assassination in December 2007, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari took over her position as chairman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).\n\nDespite suddenly being catapulted to the top of the political echelon, he initially kept a low profile, focusing instead on finishing his history degree at Oxford University.\n\nBut he returned to Pakistan in 2010, and has taken on an increasingly active role as PPP chairman since then.\n\nNow, he is 29 and running for parliament for the first time.\n\nHe told the BBC ahead of the 25 July election that he was campaigning to implement his mother's vision of a \"peaceful, progressive, prosperous, democratic Pakistan\".\n\nSuch is the pressure of his family name that Mr Bhutto Zardari will find it difficult to escape comparisons with his mother, father and grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Mr Ali Bhutto was Pakistan's first elected prime minister and was executed under martial law in 1979.\n\nThe heir to one of South Asia's most famous political dynasties must do more than just follow in his forebears' footsteps.\n\nMr Bhutto Zardari had just turned 19 when his mother died in a gun and bomb attack during her election campaign in December 2007.\n\nHis appointment as party chairman was considered a strategic move to consolidate the party using the Bhutto legacy: the PPP was founded and has always been led by a Bhutto family member.\n\nAs Mr Bhutto Zardari made his first public appearance before the world in the wake of the assassination, his father announced that his son would be linked with his mother's famous last name. Bilawal Zardari became Bilawal Bhutto Zardari\n\nMr Bhutto Zardari has spent most of his life outside Pakistan, travelling with his mother - who went into self-imposed exile in 1999 - moving between London and Dubai, and then studying in Oxford. Since 2010 he has spent most of his time in Pakistan.\n\nHe does speak Urdu but, like Benazir, his first language is English and his Urdu accent just as Anglicised as that of his mother. However, language never stopped her from reaching a mass audience, and it remains to be seen if it will present a long-term barrier to her son.\n\nMr Bhutto Zardari is described as a keen sportsman who enjoys cricket, shooting and horse-riding. He also has a black belt in taekwondo.\n\nIn joining Oxford's Christ Church college, he followed in the footsteps of both his mother and his grandfather."
