        "text": "Hailing from the feudal background of Larkana, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was the son of Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, born on January 5, 1928. After completion of his early education, he moved to Bombay, where he passed his senior Cambridge in 1946. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto got the degree of bachelor in political science in 1950 and completed his master in 1952 from Britain. He was not only a good student but was also a good cricketer and debater, during academia. After completing master degree in political science, he returned to Pakistan in 1953. Instead being a landlord, Bhutto choses his professional career as professor in law college. Later, he joined politics in 1957 and became an active member in 1958 and administrated as head of different departments. During General Ayyub Khan tenure, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had been minister of commerce, Information and Industry. He was chosen as foreign minister of Pakistan in 1962 by the ruling dictator of that time General Ayyub Khan. He called off from his duties due to two main reasons:\n\nDifference with General Ayyub Khan\n\nTashkent agreement with India\n\nCreation of Pakistan People's Party:\n\nBhutto went to abroad after having differences with Ayyub dictatorship in 1966 but turned back to homeland in 1967 and laid the foundation of his own party, named as Pakistan People's Party. Bhutto's political thoughts were basically based on the concept of socialism and hence the party's manifesto consist of 4 things;\n\nThe Religion\n\nSocialism\n\nDemocracy\n\nSovereignty\n\nAfter examining the political manifesto of the Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's political party, one can say that it is near to that of Chines Communist party's manifesto. The slogan of Pakistan People's Party is very important and it clarifies the statement of Abraham Lincoln;\n\n\"Democracy of the people, by the people and for the people\".\n\nRoti, Kapra aur Makan gained popularity from its beginning and got people's attention towards their fundamental rights.\n\nPre-and Post-Election Era of 1970:\n\nThe pre-and post-election era had played a vital role in the personality building and later downfall of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The role of twin political wings and later their alliances has a prominent place in the political background of Pakistan (East and West). The role of right and left wing, later their broke up has resulted the partition of Pakistan in two parts into Bangladesh and Pakistan. The regional politics, which was based on language, culture and tradition, has helped different parties in gaining their attention of people. The national issues were neglected and those were not on the agenda of either side of political party. The negligence of national issues has created much confusions among the people and both sides, East and West Pakistan went onto differences. The election of 1971 has created a bunch of problems between East and West Pakistan. Awami league got 160 seats out of 162 in the East Pakistan and Bhutto's Peoples Party could get 87 seats in West Pakistan. Although it remained 2nd on the political chart but the coming days created much confusions between Mujeeb's Awami League and Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. Now the political scene was describing the political part of Awami League in center clearly but it was denied by General Yahya Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The effects of 1971 elections remained as Bhutto/Mujeeb dialogues failed and both parties failed to find out a proper solution of formation of government. The six-point agenda, which was proposed by Shaikh Mujeeb Ur Rehman was neglected by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Then the well-known term came out by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto:\n\n\"Here We and There You\"\n\nThis term was misunderstood and became a kind of misrepresentation. The coming days were worse days in the history of Pakistan as it was facing dual issues. The one was related to government affair which was not being resolved by the winning parties and the other issue was civil un-rest. Both these main factors, later caused in the creation of Bangladesh. The winner from both sides were causing to create a space among the people of East and West Pakistan and their speeches were adding fuel to the burning fire. Addressing a session at Minar-e-Pakistan:\n\n\"Who will go to East Pakistan, I will break his legs.\"\n\n(On 18 February 1970, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto)\n\nThe leaders from Eastern Pakistan were making statements about the people of West Pakistan and same case was being practiced by the leaders of Western Pakistan. Declaring Dhaka as slaughter house by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, dismantled the emotions and feelings of Bengalis and Shaikh Mujeeb refused to visit West Pakistan by stating if president wants to see him them he should has to come Dhaka.\n\nThe tussle was generated between both parties and either side was on denied to agree on a singular agenda. The Six Points agenda by Mujeeb-Ur-Rehman was strongly disagreed by Bhutto and the concept of one unit was openly challenged by Shaikh Mujeeb-Ur-Rehman. Finally, this tussle resulted in form of separation of East from West Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nMilitary Operation in Eastern Pakistan:\n\nThe military operation added fuel to the fire and demoralized the character of Bengali people. The operation in Eastern Pakistan ended up on killings of thousands of innocent Bengali people and the formation of separates movements like Liberation Army of Mukti Bahini. The Indian role cannot have been neglected as they have had helped the liberation army through multiple channels i.e Weapons, Money and Politically.\n\nFinally, after a lot of killings of people and stretch between political leaders, ended up not only the creation of Bangladesh but also the defeat of Pakistan by Indians as they overwhelmed by capturing more than 90,000 soldiers and civilians. The 16th of December is now being observed in Pakistan as a black day and Bangladesh celebrate it as their Independence Day.\n\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto became the first civil marshal law administrator after the resignation of General Yahya Khan 1971 and remained in power till 1973.\n\nThe Democratic Government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Challenges:\n\nLater, in 1973, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took oath as the democratic prime minister of Pakistan. There were multiple challenges, waiting for the newly elected government of Pakistan. Some of the main factors are highlighted below:\n\n90,00 army soldiers, which were poisoned by Indian army, during 1971 war\n\nThe role of Military Generals in politics\n\nMaking of the constitution of Pakistan\n\nThe social, cultural and ideological barrier\n\nCreation of Bangladesh\n\nCivil and Military administrators of Bengali Origin\n\nReligion has been a key and important factor in Pakistan's politics and policy making\n\nThe Bhutto government must face multiple challenges, regarding religious affairs and Bhutto has tried to resolve them through constitution of 1973. For More than last ten years, the military had been directly involved in the government. Military generals were never ready to give powers to political leaders. More than 90,000 soldiers became the prisoners and went under Indian custody. It was a biggest challenge for Bhutto government to get them back to Pakistan.\n\nSome of the Bengali officers were holding charges to key positions in government and they had information about various important records and strategies. If the government of Pakistan took any immediate and violent action against them and sent them back to Bangladesh before making necessary track record changes, it would have been dangerous for the security of Pakistan.\n\nThe General Reforms by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto:\n\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto has tried to make some reforms at high level and those brought up a stability in Pakistan. The initiatives, which were the basic agenda of Bhutto's government including:\n\nAdministration\n\nMilitary\n\nAppointment of New Cabinet\n\nThe Shimla Deputation\n\nThe case of Bengali Officers was resolved\n\nHamud-Ur-Rehman Commission\n\nControl on Bureaucracy\n\nHealth Reforms\n\nEducation Policy\n\nIndustrialization\n\nLabor and Agricultural Reforms\n\nAchievements:\n\nMajor achievements by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto are given in details.\n\nNuclear Program:\n\nBhutto has been regarded as the founder of Pakistan’s Nuclear Program. After India’s Nuclear Test in 1974, Bhutto sensed a great danger for Pakistan. After India’s test in May 1974, in a press conference, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto said:\n\n\" We will eat grass but will make atom bomb.\"\n\nBhutto could not get atom bomb in three years. But, he had provided a guideline to Pakistani scientists and had mobilized them for this purpose. That is why Pakistan became a nuclear power in 1998.\n\nConstitution of 1973:\n\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto is given the credit for making a constitution that was unanimously approved by the all the parliamentary political parties of Pakistan and still, with basic structure, is followed in Pakistan. The 1973 constitution was passed on April 10th, 1973 by National Assembly and was promulgated on 14th August 1973. Bhutto became the Prime Minister of Pakistan from this date and Fazal Elahi Chaudhary became the President. Pakistan became a parliamentary democracy.\n\nSolution of Qadiani Issue:\n\nIn Bhutto government, the issue of Qadiani was resolved. They were declared as non-Muslims through second amendment to the Constitution of 1973.\n\nThe Decline of Bhutto:\n\nThe important political parties made political alliance against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. and participated in the elections 1977. The name of alliance parties was PNA (Pakistan National Alliance). During election campaign PNA succeeded in promoting anti-Bhutto feelings among the masses and received a great response from public in processions they held across the country.\n\nPNA’s Public Movement:\n\nPNA refused to participate in provincial elections and launched a public movement against the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto on March 14th. Huge processions and protests were held throughout Pakistan. History also records the worst ever torture on the participants of protests. This movement was led by Mian Tufail Muhammad (Jamaat Islami) and Mufti Mahmood (Father of Fazal Ur Rehman Jamaat Ulma-e-Islam) etc\n\nLater, Bhutto and PNA began negotiations for reconciliation but no proper agreement could be reached between government and PNA.\n\nEnforcement of Martial Law:\n\nOn 5th July 1977, General Zia Ul Haq in the light of the apparent failure of the dialogue for consensus building between government and PNA, and also in the light of worsening law and order situation, enforced Martial law, took over the government and arrested the Prime Minister of Pakistan Zufiqar Ali Bhutto along with his cabinet members. Gen. Zia Ul Haq addressed the nation through television and tried to justify his Martial law in front of nation and assured nation of holding elections in October 1977.\n\nLater, Bhutto was released on July 29 who was received by a large crowd of supporters in his hometown of Larkana. Bhutto moved across Pakistan and delivered hatred speeches against the ambitions of military Generals. Gen. Zia _apparently afraid of his sharp speeches and political campaign, again arrested Bhutto on September 3, 1977. On the other hand, LHC released Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto on bail on September 13.\n\nOn September 17th, Zia again gave orders of Bhutto’s arrest and later, multiple member of PPP leaders was arrested and disqualified from contesting in elections. After few days, Zia announced to postpone elections that were scheduled in October.\n\nNusrat Bhutto Case:\n\nNusrat Bhutto (wife of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and acting Chairman of PPP) filed a petition against illegal Martial law of Zia in SC and claimed that General Zia had no authority to arrest the democratically elected Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The hearing started on 20th September, 1977 and went on till 1st November 1977. On November 10th, SC validated and provided the legitimate foundation to Martial law and regarded Zia’s acts as extra constitutional measures.\n\nBhutto’s Execution, End of An Era:\n\nOn October 24th, 1977 Bhutto was tried before (LHC) Lahore High Court in Ahmed Raza Qasuri’s father murder case. After various hearings, Bhutto was declared guilty and sentenced to death by LHC on March 18, 1978. After that, he was sent to Central Jail Rawalpindi. Bhutto was denied the right to appeal and his family later appealed on behalf of him to Supreme Court of Pakistan about LHC judgment. During various hearings before SC, Bhutto could speak up and defend himself.\n\nOn February 6, 1979 Bhutto was finally convicted in the Murder Case of Nawab Mehmood Ahmed Khan, father of Ahmed Raza Qasuri (a prominent lawyer). Supreme Court of Pakistan gave its final verdict and sentenced Bhutto to death. After the judgment, Bhutto ‘s family contacted international community and requested to help him to build a pressure on Zia in overruling his conviction. Bhutto’s family totally failed with Zia not ready to accept foreign intervention in this matter.\n\nFinally, on 4th April 1979, the Ex-Prime Minister was hanged at 2 am in Central Jail Rawalpindi. He was buried in a Village Cemetery at Garhi Khuda Bakhs.\n\nThe execution of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto is still surrounded by many controversies with many seeing it to get rid of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBhutto got important place in the history of Pakistan. His party lost a charismatic leader but still, Bhutto lies in the heart of every political worker of PPP. He had given two important things to Pakistan,\n\nThe start nuclear program\n\nThe unanimously approved constitution of Pakistan which is the salient foundation of constitution of Pakistan.\n\nEven after the execution of Bhutto. PPP still existed under his wife and then was led by his daughter Benazir Bhutto. Today, PPP is as an important political party in Pakistan’s politics. PPP has been able to participate 3 times in Pakistani government and is currently the most influential political party with government in federation and elected representatives in almost all the provinces.\n\nIn the end, it can be asserted that the blood of Bhutto family played a major role in giving life to PPP. Bhutto also gave voice to the poor people of Pakistan and helped them to raise their voice in front of feudal Lords. But remember, Bhutto itself was a feudal Lord of Larkana. He was, and perhaps still is, the only person capable enough of pulling such stunts and still being adored by a large part of the population.\n\nUpon the news of his death, many people immolated themselves in protest. This kind of fervor and adoration is not reserved for ordinary mortals. He gave the down trodden people of this country a reason to hope for a better future, a sense of dignity and purpose. It’s his image that lives on, after more than three decades of his death. The outgoing federal government, despite their best efforts, was not able to erase that image from people’s minds.\n\nBibliography:"
