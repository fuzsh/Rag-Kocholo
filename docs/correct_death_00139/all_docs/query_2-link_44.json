        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nFrom Islamabad, Bhutto headed about 10 miles south to Rawalpindi, the city where the Pakistan army has its headquarters. There, she staged a campaign rally in the final days before the election. She told the crowd, \"I put my life in danger and came here because I feel this country is in danger.\"\n\nAfterwards, Bhutto walked to a white vehicle in her caravan, surrounded by aides, supporters and security. This is the last photograph of Bhutto alive, waving to the crowd from the sunroof of her vehicle. Witnesses reported she was fired on at close range by a gunman. Soon after, a bomb exploded. At least 20 people were killed in the blast.\n\nBhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital for surgery as crowds thronged the scene. Later, a member of Bhutto's party announced that she had been declared dead by doctors at 6:16 p.m. local time.\n\nNawaz Sharif, the leader of another opposition party and also a former prime minister, had to this to say at the hospital.\n\nPERVEZ MUSHARRAF, Pakistani President (through translator):\n\nAt this unfortunate incident, in honor of Madam Benazir Bhutto, I am declaring three days of mourning. Our flags will fly at half-mast. This is the work of those terrorists with whom we are engaged in war. I have been saying that the nation faces the greatest threats from these terrorists. Today, after this tragic incident, I want to express my firm resolve. And I also seek solidarity from the nation and cooperation and help. We will not rest until we eliminate these terrorists and root them out."
