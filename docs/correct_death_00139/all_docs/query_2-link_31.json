        "text": "The Pakistani cabinet has supported moves to re-examine the death sentence meted out to former Prime Minster Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1979.\n\nMr Bhutto led the country's first democratically elected government, but was ousted from power in a military coup in 1977.\n\nHe was hanged two years later in what is widely seen to have been a controversial death sentence.\n\nIt was thought to have been at the behest of military ruler Zia-ul Haq.\n\nA government spokesperson said President Zardari will shortly put the case before the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Zardari is the head of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), founded by Mr Bhutto, and is his son-in-law.\n\nMr Bhutto's daughter Benazir - who was married to Mr Zardari - like her father also served as prime minister, but she was assassinated while in opposition in 2007.\n\nInformation Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan told the media the proposal to reopen the case was presented to the cabinet by Law Minister Babar Awan.\n\nThe information minister said the cabinet unanimously endorsed the proposal."
