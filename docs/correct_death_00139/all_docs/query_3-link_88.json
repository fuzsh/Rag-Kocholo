        "text": "RAWALPINDI, Pakistan – Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was fatally shot in the neck as she was leaving a political rally yesterday, in an assassination that left at least 19 others dead in a follow-up explosion.\n\nThe murder came minutes after Bhutto – addressing thousands of supporters in this army-stronghold city where her father, a former prime minister, was hanged nearly 30 years ago – spoke of the risks she faced.\n\n“I put my life in danger and came here because I feel this country is in danger. People are worried. We will bring the country out of this crisis,” she said.\n\nFBI and Homeland Security officials sent a bulletin to law-enforcement agencies stating that al Qaeda had claimed responsibility on Islamist Web sites and that the group’s No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, had planned the assassination.\n\nBut US intelligence officials said they could not confirm the claim.\n\nThere was no immediate explanation of how the gunman evaded security, which had been heightened since an attempt on Bhutto’s life two months ago during her triumphant return from exile.\n\nWitnesses said the 54-year-old former prime minister was leaving the rally at Liaquat Bagh Park in her bulletproof Toyota Land Cruiser just after 5 p.m. (7 a.m. New York time).\n\nBut there were conflicting accounts of the murder – which took place in front of hundreds of witnesses.\n\n“She was inside the vehicle and was coming out from the gate after addressing the rally when some of the youths started chanting slogans in her favor,” said Sardar Qamar Hayyat, a leader from Bhutto’s party.\n\n“Then I saw a smiling Bhutto emerging from the vehicle’s roof and responding to their slogans.\n\n“Then I saw a thin, young man jumping toward her vehicle from the back and opening fire. Moments later, I saw her speeding vehicle going away.”\n\nBut other officials in Bhutto’s party said a sniper in a nearby building fired the fatal shots. The suicide bombing was carried out moments later, likely by the gunman.\n\nCNN reported that the bomb was detonated by a man on a motorcycle who managed to get near the SUV carrying Bhutto.\n\nAccording to another version, reported by CalcuttaNews.net, two men on motorcycles rode by Bhutto’s SUV. One detonated the bomb, and when Bhutto emerged to see what had happened, the second cyclist fired five times at her.\n\nWhat is clear is that the bomb blast rocked the area, leaving mangled bodies in a pool of blood and pieces of clothing and shoes scattered on the road. The death toll, including Bhutto, stood at 20.\n\nBhutto’s SUV raced two miles to Rawalpindi General Hospital and she was rushed into emergency surgery.\n\nA doctor on the team that treated her said she had a bullet in the back of the neck that damaged her spinal cord before exiting from the side of her head.\n\nAnother bullet pierced the back of her shoulder and came out through her chest.\n\nShe was given open heart massage, but the main cause of death was damage to her spinal cord, he said. She was pronounced dead at 6:16 p.m.\n\nHours after the assassination, Bhutto’s body was carried from the hospital in a plain wooden coffin by a crowd of supporters.\n\nIt was flown to her home province of Sindh early today shortly after the arrival of her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and their three children.\n\nPakistani TV reported the body was transported by plane because it was feared Bhutto supporters would block a motorcade.\n\nParty officials said Bhutto would be buried in her native village of Garhi Khuda Baksh, in a family graveyard next to her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n\nThousands of mourners flocked to Bhutto’s ancestral home ahead of today’s expected funeral, following the Islamic tradition of conducting burials as quickly as possible.\n\nThe crowds cried and wailed as the coffin was brought out into the home. “Show patience. Give us courage to bear this loss,” Zardari told the mourners.\n\nPresident Pervez Musharraf – Bhutto’s main rival for power – declared a three-day period of mourning and said, “This cruelty is the work of those terrorists with whom we are fighting.”\n\nBut questions remained as to how Bhutto was killed.\n\nHundreds of riot police had manned security checkpoints around the rally venue yesterday. People entering the park had to pass through metal detectors.\n\nBhutto’s own security included guards armed with assault rifles who stood in front of the stage she used to address the throng.\n\nRetired army Gen. Hamid Gul, a former head of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence secret-service agency, questioned how an attacker could get to the rear park gate.\n\n“How could they enter with so much of a police cordon? I am surprised,” Gul said.\n\nHe said a suicide bomber couldn’t have carried out the attack without being forewarned of Bhutto’s movements with a cellphone or other device.\n\nBhutto had complained after the October assassination attempt in the city of Karachi that devices used to jam cellphone signals had not been working, Gul said.\n\n“Why were the jammers not working? She had been begging the government after the attack in Karachi, saying the jammers were faulty then,” he said. “I know that these things could not occur if the jammers are working.”\n\nABC News reported yesterday that Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, al Qaeda’s commander in Afghanistan allegedly, claimed responsibility for yesterday’s attack in a phone call to a little-known Italian Web site.\n\n“We terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat the mujahedeen,” the site said.\n\nWith Post Wire Services,The Times of London, Ed Robinsonand Andy Soltis"
