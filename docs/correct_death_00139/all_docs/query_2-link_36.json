Here are some of the key events in her career:\n\nApril 4 1979: Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, is executed for the murder of a political opponent, two years after he was ousted as prime minister in a military coup.\n\nApril 10 1986: Bhutto returns from exile in London to lead the Pakistan People's party that her father founded.\n\nDecember 1 1988: Bhutto, aged 35, becomes the first female prime minister of a Muslim nation after winning parliamentary elections.\n\nAugust 6 1990: President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismisses Bhutto's government, citing corruption and a failure to control ethnic violence.\n\nOctober 19 1993: Bhutto takes the oath for a second term as prime minister.\n\nNovember 5 1996: President Farooq Leghari dismisses Bhutto's second administration amid accusations of nepotism and undermining the justice system.\n\nApril 14 1999: A court finds Bhutto guilty of corruption while she is out of the country. The conviction is later quashed, but Bhutto remains in exile.\n\nOctober 5 2007: President General Pervez Musharraf signs a corruption amnesty covering other cases against Bhutto, opening the way for her return and a possible power-sharing agreement.\n\nOctober 18 2007: Bhutto flies in to Karachi, where tens of thousands of supporters give her a rousing welcome amid tight security. Two bombs go off near her vehicle. More than 140 people are killed in the assassination attempt."
