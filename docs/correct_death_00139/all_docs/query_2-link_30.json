        "text": "On 4 April 1979, 38 years ago to the day, former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged by the General Zia-ul-Haq regime for murder.\n\nIn his book Bhutto Kay Aakhri 323 Din (The Last 323 Days of Bhutto), Lt Col Rafiuddin, who was deputed inside the jail for over 10 months to keep an eye on him, details the deposed PM's last moments.\n\nAccording to Rafiuddin, Bhutto had trouble sleeping that night and couldn't draw up a will owing to his disturbed state of mind. He even burnt the piece paper on which he had earlier penned down a will. When the jail superintendent later came to his cell, he found him lying motionless on a mattress.\n\nDawn cites the book to recount the final couple of minutes leading up to the former PM’s execution.\n\nWith this, Bhutto’s exceptional and dramatic life came to an abrupt end. He was hanged for the alleged murder of Nawab Mohammad Ahmad Khan, belying expectations that his stature would help him escape the noose.\n\nHis hanging also cut short his impressive and stormy political career. As PM, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had a successful and turbulent stay in office, during which he laid the foundation of Pakistan's nuclear programme.\n\nJoin The Quint on WhatsApp. Type “JOIN” and send to 9910181818."
