Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 6 FOREWORD “Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice”. Shakespeare: Othello “ZULFIKAR ALI BHUTTO: Recollections and Remembrances” is one of the series of books that will be published in due course of time. World leaders, men of letters, intellectuals, journalists here and abroad who have had some association with Shaheed Bhutto have written about him, their experiences with him on various occasions. His charisma as a leader of the masses, his statesmanship and his life long instinct by design and by his deeds to be part of history have left indelible imprints on the sands of time, and his unique niche in the world of politics have given him permanence as an engrossing subject in which the more you learn the more you know of life and about life. For any student of history understanding of politics in South Asia in the global milieu of changing perceptions and realities would be incomplete without a study of him and apportionment of his role in the populist movements of far-reaching universal consequences. Different people had different interests in Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Intellectuals saw in him a giant unequal to match skills with. World leaders felt comfortable in his company because deliberating with him was always an enlightening and enriching experience. For the masses he was an embodiment of their suppressed aspirations. He was a singular phenomenon in a Third World country which had been kept in chains by reactionary and obscurantist forces. His progressive socio-economic and democratic ideas not only gave him the strength but also a popular support to consolidate the edifice of the state on an agenda which pledged total national commitment to power to the people as a means to guarantee roti, kapra aur makkan for all. Besides being a multi-dimensional subject for intellectual, academic research and pursuit as has been manifested in unending writings on him, inconclusively falling too short of the world canvas that he occupied. the present undertaking “Zulfikar Ali Bhutto: Recollections and Remembrances” is just a small attempt towards collecting and printing reminiscences of those who have been associated with him as a child, as a student, as his friends, political colleagues, workers, ministers, family members and those who attended to him at some stage or the other in his illustrious life. In their own way these recollections and remembrances throw some light on his personality and the traits that made him an eternal flame for lightning up causes\n\n8. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 7 pertaining to the welfare of the poor and the denied, for getting across through the dark tunnel of despair. Anecdotes about him and about his life, his being the most apt person to handle a crisis, the dauntless determination that he showed in inspiring the nation to look to a better tomorrow after the fall of Dhaka in 1971, and the unsurpassable chapter in human dignity that he wrote in his blood by showing preference to an honorable death, to surrendering to the dictates of a dictator open new vistas of inquiry into higher human values that survive even to this day in un-diminishing legacy that he bequeathed to the people of Pakistan. Shaheed Bhutto was a keen and ardent student of history. Many a great leader of the yore and of his age, leading lights in the world of letters, diplomacy and statecraft made him pick up the best from them to carve for himself an enviable position among those who have helped in some way in the progress of mankind against retrogressive forces. However, as other writings on him and this book would show, he was most impressed by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah founder of Pakistan. His friend late Piloo Mody in his book, “Zulfi My friend” brings out Shaheed Bhutto’s devotion to the Quaid as follows: “For Zulfi everything that Jinnah said or did was correct.” And that he was a fanatic supporter of Jinnah’s two nation theory, demand for Pakistan and commitment to enlightened Islam. I have maintained that big and small contributions in making history need always to be recorded. Shaheed Bhutto was yesterday a relevant subject for comment, be is today an appropriate case for study and so shall be remain tomorrow. Therefore, all those who knew him and for whom he was an individual of interest--owe it to history to write about him, about his period, his leadership and above all, the man that he was, to leave enough source-material and data for posterity, as well as a homage to Shaheed Bhutto who, conscious of his rightful place in history, lived and died for his people. I am grateful to Mr. Khurshed Junejo, who hails from Shaheed Bhutto’s home district of Larkana, for accepting the challenge of compiling Recollections of Shaheed Bhutto. I am also grateful to all those who made contributions to the book and helped make it a reality. Finally the book is a tribute from a loving daughter to a loving father. Not only was he a great political leader but a great family man. From him I learnt: “The best thing any parent can give his child is a good education. Everything else can be taken coral, but not an education:” “Values and character are more important than material well being. We can take nothing to the grave except a good name;”\n\n9. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 8 “All men and women are equal. In Islam a king and a beggar are buried in the same kafan:” “Never go in for short term gains but your place in history:” “Realities change. This time too shall pass.” “Ultimate victory belongs to the masses” “Politics is the highest Juror of public service” “I would rather live like a lion for a day than a jackal Jar a decade” “Honour is more important than life” He is gone from us. Yet he lives amongst us. I see his face not only in my children but in all children, in the future generations for whom he sacrificed his life. I would request all those who wish to contribute their recollections for posterity to send these articles to Mr. Khurshed Junejo at Bilawal House. Karachi. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto\n\n10.

Khurshed Junejo Compiler\n\n11. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 10 HE WAS A LOVING HUSBAND Begum Nusrat Bhutto Q. What are your recollections of your child-hood and your family history? A. MY family comes from Iran. My great grand father had three sons. He sent one of his sons to China, to learn how to make silk, he became a businessman. He sent his second son to Najaf-e-Ashraf to become a religious man. He kept the third son with him at the lands to become an agriculturist. The one who went to Najaf-e-Ashraf was my grand father. His father built a mosque for him in Isfahan when he came back from Najaf after becoming an Ayatollah, but grandfather died before he could go back to preach in Isfahan and serve in this mosque. It is a very, beautiful mosque and is still there. My father Mirza Mohammed was born in Najaf. His mother was Syed and his father was non-Syed. His family name was Mirza Mohammed Abdul Latif Isfahani. He was a modern man and he did not want to become an Ayatollah. So he studied in Najaf. Once he and his friends went on a holiday to Bombay, India and when he returned he told his father and grandfather that he wanted to put up soap industry in India. So my parents shifted to India and established “Baghdad Soap Industries” in Bombay. There I was born. I was the third daughter and after me a son was born, so they said I was a good luck. They pampered me a lot. These were the final years of British Raj. My, father used to visit Karachi frequently, to buy raw material for his soap industry. I went to school in Bombay. When I did my senior Cambridge, my parents asked me to wear “Burka” (veil). They said now you are a grown-up and you cannot go around without hijab. My father was a very simple and soft- hearted person, he used to help poor relatives and neighbours. I refused to wear a “Burka” to go to college. A niece of mine would also go to college with me and she was very clever. She would leave her home wearing “Burka” but on tier way, she would take it off in the car, and then while coming back home, site would put it on again. Her father thought his daughter was very obedient. But I was the simpleton and I did not want to fool my parents. I did not know for many years about my niece, much later I came to know what she used to do. So I did not go to university and now I am sorry that I do not have a degree. So these were my olden days. I was treated fondly by everyone. My elder sisters were much older than me the first was 14 years and the second was 13 years elder to me. They had married very early and they had children of my age or a little younger than me. Fakhri is one of them. She is the daughter of my eldest sister. Safia Khanum. Fakhri and I grew up together.\n\n12. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 11 Q Coming from a conservative family, you and Fakhri Begum were two liberated women. A. My father was not so conservative, he always encouraged us. My mother was a little old-fashioned, who would ask me to wear “Burka”. In fact in those days, generally women wore Burka. When I got married, my husband’s family wanted me to wear Burka at least in Larkana. So every time I went to Larkana, I would wear Burka. It was much later when my husband became a Minister and my father-in-law had died that I discarded it. Once my husband said it (Burka) was a big farce and that I should forget it and take it off. One day when I was traveling with him in a plane to Larkana he said, “Don’t wear it any more.” So I threw it away. Q How did you meet Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto? A. It was very strange. During my childhood, when we still lived in Bombay, we used to visit Khandala, a hill resort near Bombay. We had a small summer house there sometimes we used to go to Lonavala near Khandala. I saw him in Lonavala for the first time. I remember so vividly, I was I I-years old. We were walking around and his family was also there and walking. Somehow our parents got together and started talking. There were three girls and this boy. So we kids also began talking. They said they were from Sindh. We knew Karachi but did not know Sindh, so we asked where Sindh was. They told us where it was. These were the things that our parents talked about. I think we just net twice. I don’t remember the details. And then we shifted to Karachi. His sister, Manna. (Begun Munawwar Islam) was a friend of mine and when she was getting married, she invited me also. So I went to the bank to get my jewellery from my locker. I saw him standing there. He was grown up by now and I did not know it the first instance as to who he was. But his mother was also there and she knew that I was friendly with Manna. So she said: “Oh... Nusrat, this is my son, just came from America, his name is Zulfi.” Now, I had heard from another friend of mine, now she is Mrs. Habibullah, that Manna had a brother who was very handsome and tall. I had seen him in the childhood and I had actually forgotten how he looked. While standing in that bank, I saw him. Perhaps it was a little dark inside the bank, or whatever, but somehow I thought that he was not so good-looking. This was our first meeting as grown-ups. Anyway, we went to Mehndi and wedding ceremony and he was always there. There I thought he was charming. He liked me and I liked him. He was so\n\n13. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 12 dignified. I had met many other people in parties and picnics. There were many boys and girls around and there was much misbehaving and rubbish-talking. But he was so dignified. Q. How old were you, at that time? A. I was 20. Q. Then what happened’? Did he propose? A. No, he did not. I had joined Pakistan National Guards and was a Captain in the Army. My friend, who is now Mrs. Habibullah, was in the Navy. So after a few days of Manna’s wedding, both of us went to her to congratulate her and see how she was doing after marriage. Both of us were in our uniforms. He was there and we met. But I think he did not like us in uniform because afterwards he said to his sister, “What are these two girls up to?” Then again he went to America to study. Then..., Well, I cannot tell you all my secrets... Or should I? Okay, I tell. After some time, a friend of his who was also studying in America, came and met me and said Zulfi had sent his love for me. Nov I could not place the name at that moment and I asked which Zulfi? So when he went back he told him that she does not know who you are and you are sending love to her. After two years, he came back. Now he was studying in Oxford. We saw each other at a friend’s birthday party. He came over and said: “Shall I introduce myself to you? Do you know who I am?” I said “No.” I had realized what he was talking about and I was feeling guilty. He asked: “Shall I bring an ice cream for you?” I said “Yes”. Then he went and brought me an ice cream. Later, he would ask his married friends to throw a party and invite me there. So we met at such parties, but never met alone. Then he proposed. Q. Do you remember exactly when? A. Manna got married in 1949. He proposed me in 1951. And we got married. The wedding was in Karachi. I left with him on our honeymoon. At that time, his family lived in a house under the Clifton Bridge at McNeil Road. I lived with them in that house after the marriage, and Benazir was born there. But soon after the marriage I went with him to Oxford. It was his first year there, and under the rules, he could not live outside hostel. Therefore, I had to live in a hotel and he would live in the hostel. We would stay together during the day. Once he did not\n\n14. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 13 go to his hostel in the night, and next day, he told his Dean: “Sorry. I stayed with my wife.” But he was so young that the Dean did not believe him. So he took me to him and then the Dean said he felt sorry that we could not live together and did not punish him for staying out that night. Q. How was Sir Shah Nawaz like? A. He was very old by that time. He was a very good person. When we were in Oxford, he would keep writing that I come back. Finally I came back to live with my in-laws, and I was not very happy about it because by that time I was in love with my husband and I wanted to live with him. But my in-laws thought their son would not study properly if I was with him. So we would talk on telephone and I would cry for not being with him. After sometime, my father purchased my tickets and I went back to Oxford to live with him. It was in 1952 that I got pregnant then I told him we were going to have a child. He was so happy to hear it, that he shouted on the street with joy “Oh... I am going to be a father.” Then in 1953, I gave birth to Benazir. Q. Somebody told me that Mr. Bhutto had a sister whose name was Benazir and she died at a young age and he named his daughter after her, is that true? A. Yes. It was much earlier, before Independence. She studied in Poona and lived in the school hostel. We later saw her diary in which she wrote about her keenness to finish the school and come back to her home. But there she got meningitis and died at a young age. She was buried in Poona. It was after her that my mother-in-law, named our daughter Benazir. She was only 15 years old. Q. How was your mother-in-law like? It is said that she belonged to a poor family. A. There has been much talk about my mother-in-law, and I think that has to be settled once and for all. My mother-in-law was Begum Khurshid whose mother was a new Muslim. Mr. Hidayatullah, who was not a Sir at that time, had married that lady after she had converted from being a Hindu to be a Muslim. Two daughters were born out of that marriage, Begum Khurshid being one of them. Later Hidayatullah divorced that lady and married another woman. Now Begum Khurshid’s elder sister is married to a person, whose name, I think, was Mir Maqbool Ahmad Khan. Now this Maqbool Ahmad Khan was a close friend of Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto. Sir Shah Nawaz’s first wife was very old and he wanted to marry again. So this Maqbool Ahmad Khan suggested to him that he could marry his wife’s sister, Khurshid, and so they got married.\n\n15. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 14 Q. Mr. Bhutto was the only son from that lady? A. Yes. The other two brothers and four sisters were from the first wife and one son and three sisters from the second wife, Khurshid Begum. She was a conservative lady and a religious person. I accompanied her to Ziaraat, to Najaf- e-Ashraf, Karbala, Baghdad. She was a good Muslim. She used to wear “Burka” and she asked me to wear it whenever I visited Larkana. Anyway, after completing his studies in Oxford, Mr. Bhutto got a job in the University but his parents did not like the idea that their son should live in England so they compelled him to come back. In Karachi, he would some time go to deliver lectures in the Sindh Muslim Law College. But he wanted to join Foreign Office. Q. When you met him for the first time, could you imagine what he would do in life later? A. No. He was simply a student then. I could only see that he was a dignified person. Q. What else did you notice at that time? A. He was charming. You cannot explain what is charm. Q What was his source of inspiration? A. I can’t say. He was brought up very well. May be his mother was his source of inspiration. His father used to encourage him. His uncle, Ahmad Khan Bhutto, whose daughter was his first wife, was in politics. I tell you an interesting incident. When we got married, his uncle, who was also his father-in-law, gave a dinner party for us in Karachi Club. Because marrying again was nothing strange in Sindh. Q. Did you know he was already married? I did not know it in the beginning. What happened was that I conveyed his proposal to my parents through my elder sister. First they rejected it. They said how could an Irani family agree to a proposal from a Sindhi man whom we did not know. My mother had died by that time and my grandmother and my elder sisters were there. Some days later, I think some people from Haroon family visited us and the subject came up. There, the Haroons broke the news that this man was already married. Oh my God... My parents gave me hell. They scolded me and said how I could marry a man who was already married, and break his family. After some time, he came to see my family and then I said to him: “You\n\n16. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 15 are a married man. You cheated me. Why didn’t you tell me before you were already married?” Then he told me in what circumstances he had been married. Later he brought his mother along and she explained to my family as to how he was made to marry his cousin when he was just 14 and they asked him to sit in the wedding if he wanted to get his favorite cricket bat set. Q. What kind of a man he was? A. He had very few friends. What nobody knows about him is that he was a very shy person, very shy. He read a lot. He educated me too. He gave me books to read and made me read a lot of books. When I was having children, he gave me books on psychology, so that I could understand my children. He used to say that our children should not do anything which could bring bad name to the family. Q. Where did you go for honeymoon? A. Paris and Rome. Interestingly, my mother-in-law accompanied us during our honeymoon. In fact, her daughter Mumtaz, had been married to Col. Mustafa who was posted in Turkey at that time. She wanted to see her daughter. So we took her along. We went to Paris, Rome and then to Turkey where she stayed with her daughter and we went to London. Q. How did he get into Ayub Khan’s cabinet? A. I think his parents knew Iskandar Mirza, who would visit them frequently. One day Iskandar Mirza said he wanted their son to be a Minister. Before that, he had written a pamphlet, titled: “Federal or Unitary Government,” and the government was angry with him. Later, he was sent as a delegate to international conferences on behalf of the government and he became the Commerce Minister. Then Iskandar Mirza was thrown out. We were in Larkana at that time. We had no plans to go to Karachi which was the Capital at that time. But he received phone calls after phone calls. Ayub Khan wanted to keep him as a Minister. Then we had discussions on whether we should go or not. His father had died by then. His mother and I suggested he should agree. So he accepted it. Q. Would he discuss politics with you? A. Quite often. I never forced in opinion on him. I just said what I genuinely felt. Some time he would accept my advice and some times he would reject it.\n\n17. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 16 Q. What kind of a husband he was? A. He as a very caring husband. Very caring, I would some times get angry on little things but he would not mind. He was a very loving person. He had a lot of patience. People would come and talk long winded rubbish and give advice to him. He would just sit and listen. Then he would say whatever he believed. He never ever scolded his children. He would talk to them very nicely. He never ever beat his children. When he became a Barrister, he contested a murder charge against an old man who came to him and said he had not committed the Murder. This was Mr. Bhutto’s first case. He gave it to me and I kept this money with me for a very long time. He won his second case and his client brought his little daughter in place of money. Mr. Bhutto brought that girl to me and said: “Look. Nusrat. This is my payment for winning the case. Do you want to keep it?” She was a very small and skinny girl. He returned her to her parents. Q. In what manner did he express his happiness over a success? A. He remained quiet. I don’t know why he had a feeling that he was going to die young. He said it even when he proposed me. He said. “We must get married quickly because I have a very short life” I said: “Why do you have a short life?” He said he could not say exactly why, but he had this feeling. He explained to me that his family had a lot of enemies who could kill him. Then there was this fortune-teller who had told his father, when he was a child, the details of his future. About his early education, college days how he would become famous. But that story ended at the age of 48. He was exactly 48 when the PNA started agitation against him. I remember the First elections in 1970. I got up early in the morning. I said we had to go out early. He asked, why. Why I was in such a hurry. Then I made him get up. I said we should go out and look around. He was very worried about the results. He kept listening to radio and television. He was very quite until the last reports came. He was very happy but he was too shy to express his happiness even in front of me. He was very serious and very sedate. He used to read, read and read. When he was a Minister, he would see his files till three in the morning. He would work in the bed room and I had to hear him turning the papers and I could not sleep. Once I said I could go to another room if he wanted to work but he did not allow me. He was never tired of reading and working. He would work till three in the morning and then wake up at eight in the morning and go to office. He slept very little.\n\n18. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 17 Q. You say he was a very shy person. But the whole world knows him as a very daring, brave and bold person. A. I suppose psychologically, if you are shy, you try to hide your shyness and you act to be bold and brave. I do the same thing. Basically I am a very shy person but I always try to hide my shyness by being bold and acting as if I am not afraid of anything. There was a fantastic thing about him also. He could sleep for 5 or 10 minutes if he wanted to. He would enjoy a deep sleep and then wake up. Very often he would tell me he had 10 minutes and he wanted to sleep for these 10 minutes after which I should wake him up. The moment he finished telling this to me he would start snoring. Just believe me, I am not exaggerating. He would have a deep sleep for 10 minutes and after I woke him up, he would be very fresh. I asked him how he could sleep like that. He said: “My conscience is clear. That is why I can go to sleep like that.” He used to do it quite often because he used to work all the time, so in between his engagements he got tired and then slept for a few minutes. Q. Oriana Fallacci wrote in her interview with Mr. Bhutto that he was a man full of contradictions. He was a rich man who cared for the poor. He was a feudal but a socialist. He was an orthodox Muslim but a liberal man at the same time. How do you comment on that? A. His background was feudal, but he was an educated man. He had been educated in countries like America and England. His father first sent him to America which is very modern then to Oxford to create a balance. So he was a very balanced man. He had a very kind heart but when it came to taking a decision, he would think from his head. He did not act as many mindless people do who say whatever they feel like saying. He would plan exactly what he really wanted to do. He used to say why the poor in our country have to remain poor while the poor in other countries have become rich. He was the first one who introduced nuclear energy in Pakistan, when he was the Minister for Science and Technology. He was the first one who set an educated person belonging to sweeper community as an ambassador. He was the first one who appointed a woman, Begum Raana Liaquat Ali Khan as the first woman Governor in the country (Sindh). He did so man things for the first time that no other person had done. He was a forgiving person. He forgave many who had been nasty to him. He never forgot someone who had done something good to him. When he was a Law Minister, he would always go and see Iskandar Mirza when in London because Iskandar Mirza had been kind to him. At that time he was a Minister in Ayub\n\n19. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 18 Khan’s cabinet but he didn’t care about Ayub Khan’s anger. When Iskandar Mirza died, we both went to see his wife to offer condolence. Ayub Khan was another person who had been once kind to him and he never forgot him too. He always kept a painting of Ayub Khan done by Guljee hanging in his drawing room in Larkana he never took that painting out to throw it in the store room. Still it is hanging on the wall in the drawing room of Al-Murtaza for everyone to see Mr. Bhutto was that kind of a person. Q. Much has been said about Mr. Bhutto’s role during 1971 tragedy, when Pakistan was dismembered. What is your comment on that? A. When a newspaper accused him of planning to divide the country, he denied it there and then. When they wanted to kill Mujibur Rahman, he pleaded for his life and said it would be worse. He went to see Mujib in jail and talked to him. He said to him that he was going to release him and that he should not become an enemy in future. That conversation was taped but Mujib was very clever and he knew that the discussion was being taped, so he kept knocking the table with his pipe to disturb the taping. Mr. Bhutto tried his best to save the country. He flew to Dhakka but it was too late. You know that Hamoodur Rehman Commission had put the blame on the generals. I had a copy of the report of that Commission but they came and broke my cupboard and took it. We knew that they were coming to get it. Mr. Bhutto told me in jail that they would be coming to get the report, so I should keep it in open. I put in a cupboard which was lying in a corridor. Q. His critics say that he was such a big landlord that four railway stations touched his lands. A. It was true. But not any more, it was so during his father’s time. During the land reforms, he surrendered 40.000 acres of land. There was one very beautiful house at his lands in Jacobabad. He could have kept his house but he did not. He gave that house also to the harees. He never bothered about money. Q. It is also alleged that during his days in jail, he was playing his whole game on the false hope that Zia would never dare execute him. A. That is not true. When he was first put into jail, he told me: “They are going to hang me. Because, Zia knows if he does not hang me, I shall come back to power.” I said still I wanted to try to save his life. He allowed me but said it was no use. Zia was not going to let him live. After the court announced death sentence for him, I said I wanted to file clemency petition. He said: “If you do that and Zia releases me, I will have no face to show to my people. I swear I will have to kill\n\n20. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 19 myself” Q. What did he say in your last meeting with him in the death cell? A. When he saw myself and Benazir together, he said: “Achha... Both of you have come.” Because previously they allowed us to visit him separately. He asked one of the guards to call Jail Superintendent. When he arrived, Mr. Bhutto said and these are his exact words: “So the black book has arrived?” The Superintendent said. “Yes, Sir.” Mr. Bhutto said. “Oh... Then I have to shave. I have to have a bath. I have to change.” Then he asked the Superintendent about the time (of the execution), who said five in the morning. He talked like that in front of us but we did not want us to cry in front of the jail staff we controlled ourselves. Q. What did he like to eat the most? A. His favorite food was Qeema, Daal, Pickle and Chatni. Q. What did he dislike the most? A. If anybody humiliated him or made fun of his family, he felt hurt. Q. Was he a moody person? A. No he was a very serious person. Q. How did you get into politics? A. Women used to conic and see him, but he did not have enough time to see them. So he asked me to see them, then he asked if I could organise the women wing of the Party. So I became head of the women wing. Q. You have been very close to one of the best persons in contemporary history. What do you think is the best thing in a man? A. The best thing in a man is: Kindness, truthfulness and straightforwardness. That is what he taught our children. Q. Whom did he like the most among the children? A. Sanam. He loved her the most. She was very pretty. But unlike our other\n\n21. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 20 children, she was not tall. She was a bit small. Her eye sight was weak from the beginning. So he felt a little protective towards her. She was also very cute as a child and she also loved hint very much. Q. Did he give you a lot of presents? A. He loved giving me gifts. First he used to buy me perfume. Once he brought a whole set of perfume bottles, worth thousands of rupees. I said he should have rather bought me jewellery with so much money. Then he started buying jewellery and watches for me. He always remembered birthdays of the children and myself. He never forgot calling us on such occasions even if he was abroad. He would always bring lots of personal things for children and myself from abroad. Q. How about himself? A. He loved wearing nice clothes. He was very careful about his silk shirts and socks and shoes. He wore lovely suits. But he never got them stitched from a foreign country. He did not like their style. He would buy some cloth from outside, but would always get it stitched by Hamid Tailor. Once I suggested to him to buy a suit. He bought it but then got it redone by Hamid. His favorite colours were dark grey and navy blue. His favorite perfume was “Shalimar”. Q. Every wife has some complaints against her husband. Did you too have any? A. Not any more. I had some at that time. Once was that he was always busy working. Then of course, girls would fall for him because he was so good-looking and handsome. We spent such a long time together, from 1951 to 1977. We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary just before they arrested him and they killed him. He gave me a lovely diamond ring. Q. It is said that he did not discuss Zia with many people before promoting him as Chief of Army Staff. A. That is wrong. He discussed Zia with many persons. Gen Tikka Khan opposed Zia and said the man was an actor. He said Zia had always been pretending. Intelligence Chief Gen. Jillani said Zia suited the slot the best. He said Zia had no political ambitions and Mr. Bhutto heard Jillant’s advice. Q. What was the last thing that Mr. Bhutto said to you? A. He said: “I have done my best. I have no regrets. No matter what they do to me. I shall go to God with a clear conscience.” Then they killed him. I know\n\n22. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 21 they did not hang him. They murdered him. I don’t agree with those, no matter who they are, who say that he was hanged. Somebody from the jail whispered into my ears that he had been murdered. Q. How would Mr. Bhutto call you? A. He would say Nusratam (my Nusrat) in Persian.\n\n23. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 22 A HAPPY MAN ALWAYS Ameer Begum We passed our childhood clays together and I was engaged at the age of 25 with Shaheed Bhutto. Every thing was carried out traditionally in village Mirpur Bhutto, where my father the cousin of Shaheed Bhutto was dwelling. Later I left for Bombay, where Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Saheb was busy studying and I returned back when Pakistan came into being. I don’t remember the exact date of leaving Bombay, but what I remember as the three years tenure I stayed there and most probably it was 1944, when I left my village for Bombay. When Shaheed Bhutto Saheb and I were engaged both mine and his fathers were alive and Bhutto Saheb set out for London to take studies. Though my father was thinking about the difference in our ages but my in-laws did not give more importance to it, saying that everything was being done within family and it was purely a family matter. I don’t know exactly when Shaheed Bhutto returned to Pakistan but I could only say that as soon as he came back he started teaching Law in Sindh Muslim Law College and at that time I was living in nay village and he used to visit Naudero while practicing law. Things around me were good enough to speak about his high thinking’s. He as always pointing towards the picture of Mr. Jinnah in his room and was wishing to become a leader of Mr. Jinnah’s caliber after completing studies in England. Though my mother-in-law did not favour him going and living abroad but he was a man who had constantly been pressing upon his intentions and that speaks of the volume of his determination at that age and time. We shared happiness and sorrows. He respected me. He tried to make cue realize that we were from same family and sometimes he talked of his mind to marry again, for which he had formed opinion that I could not company him breaking the family traditions of purdah. But he always promised for fulfilling the commitments of remaining with me at any cost he told me he will have another wife but after completing education. He respected me a lot and usually asked me for settling down local problems in Naudero myself. Shaheed Bhutto usually visited Naudero on Eids. Q. Did you ever accompany Bhutto Saheb any where? A. No, I did not, because I preferred to remain inside the home. Once there was a party in the honour of Bhutto Saheb, his friends expected me to be there, but Mr. Mashooq Bhutto, the brother of Mr. Mumtaz Ali Bhutto told them that Bhutto’s wife would not attend it because she did not like to come in public. “No one identifies me in Karachi. Even in Larkana I am unknown to people. If I come out in Larkana without burka people will not recognize me. They have never seen\n\n24. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 23 me before.” Q. Did Bhutto Saheb tell you he would marry again? A. Yes. Q. Did he inform you when he married Begum Nusrat Bhutto? A. No. Q. Then how did you come to know about it? A. It is a long, story which could only be covered in many books. To put it in short we went to Karachi to meet my Iranian friend. When we reached her house she was not there. We were told that she had gone to attend an engagement ceremony of an Iranian girl with a Sindhi boy. And that boy was no one else but Bhutto Sahib. At that time my sister and my foster mother were also present. My father-in-law came there to meet my father but he was out. When he came back we told him about it, so he went to meet him where my uncle informed my father about the engagement of Bhutto Saheb. Bhutto Saheb came to me in the night and in the next evening he got engaged. Q. Did you not fight on it? No. My father asked if Zulfikar told me about his marriage. I replied in negative. Then my father apprised me about Bhutto’s engagement with an Iranian girl. Later my father invited Zulfikar and Nusrat to dinner at Karachi Club. Q. Who is dearest to you amongst Bhutto Saheb’s children? A. All of them were dear to me. Bhutto Saheb would bring them to village on every Eid. We had many horses. They would enjoy riding on them. I would prepare sweets for them. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto used to tell them that I was their first mother and they ought to respect me. Benazir and other children respected and loved me very much. Q. What were Bhutto Saheb’s activities in Bombay? A. He would go to school regularly and took great interest in cricket. Once famous cricketer Mushtaq Ali was his close friend with whom he played cricket. He loved to play cricket. He had also tied a ball in his room with the ceiling fan and used to hit it with the bat to practice.\n\n25. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 24 Q. Was Bhutto Saheb an angry man? A: No. Most certainly not. Q. Was he well dressed? A. Yes, he was too much fond of fine clothes. Q. What was his other interest? A. He wanted to be a great man. He preferred wearing BOSKEY (double gorha silk). He hailed from a rich family and his grand mother used to send him BOSKEY from Bombay. In Summer he ate Falsa and in Winter Anar with great interest. Q. Did you see Bhutto’s mother? A. Yes. I lived with her for three years in Bombay. Before our marriage we would visit each other, and Bhutto Sahib would come to our home. Q. When did she pass away? A. After our marriage. Q. How was she, people say she was from a poor family? A. I don’t know. I did not dare ask my mother-in-law of her life. Q. So Bhutto Saheb wanted to be a great man. A. Yes. He would tell me that I was a wife of a great man. Q. Do you guess, from whom did he get inspiration to be a great man’? A. He didn’t tell me. We did try to stop him from the involvement in politics. He came in tussle with President Ayub. He used to say “I have not got education only to rest in bungalows and have a chit chat with naukars. I shall serve the people through politics”. He would say with great enthusiasm, pointing to the picture of Mr. Jinnah placed on the wall in his bedroom: “I would become like this man and work for the betterment of the people.” Q. So you remained in the village when he became President/Prime Minister? A. Yes I lived in village.\n\n26. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 25 Q. Didn’t you go to President’s house or anywhere with him? A. He insisted me to go with him but I refused. I thought that I would feel alone there. Q. What about those three years you remained with Bhutto Sahib in Bombay? A. Yes I remained in Bombay for three years after that I lived in my father’s house. Bhutto Sahib visited me there occasionally. We had lived together for only three years. Q. Where were you at the time when Bhutto Saheb was arrested? A. I was in Larkana. He was also arrested from there. Then I went to Karachi and sometimes later news came that he (Bhutto Saheb) was released on bail. He came to me on Eid. Both the sisters and my foster mother also met him. People were chanting slogans but Bhutto Saheb stopped them. Q. Did he talk to you? A. Not that much. He looked occupied in some thoughts. Q. Did he debar you from politics? A. Yes. He refrained me from appealing for his release from the jail. Q. How many times did you meet him in jail? A. Four times. Q. What do you talk to him? A. I can’t tell you about that. Q. How did you fund Bhutto Saheb in jail? A. Bhutto Saheb faced it bravely and courageously. When I wept there he solaced rue and said. “Don’t weep. Look to your family. Don’t weep. If they will see you weeping they will laugh at and say that they saw Bhutto’s wife weeping.” Zia had secretly installed bug devices in the room to listen to us. That is why we did not talk too much. Q. What happened during your last meeting in Rawalpindi jail?\n\n27. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 26 A. We got there under great surveillance. We were made to stand, outside the door and Bhutto Sahib stood behind the bars. He was put in a small cell. His bed was on the floor. He had one blanket only, a wooden commode and a plastic bucket of water. His sister who brought him up and his nephew were also present there to meet him but the time of meeting was very short. We met him last on the 30th or 31st of March. They searched us thoroughly before the meeting. From there I went to Rohri, from where my vehicle picked me up. Enroute to Naudero my driver told me that Police and Military had raided and searched our houses in Naudero. Four days after our last meeting they hanged him. Q. What did they search in your home? A. I don’t know. They had got hold of box containing documents of our land. Q. Did they take anything with them? A. No. They didn’t take anything with them. Since nothing was there, what would they take? Q. How did you find Bhutto Saheb? A. He was a great man. I never saw him angry. Sometimes I used to get annoyed and would criticise him. He would laugh and say. “I am what I am.” He was the best man. I would say to him, “You may be Prime Minister of your people but for us you are only same Zulfikar.” He always respected elders. He would respect and welcome my foster mother, too. Q. Did you two quarrel? A. No. Never. Why should I lie. I fought with him sometimes. I used to tell him, “You have come clandestinely to me.” He would reply, “You are my wife, don’t fight with me.” Q. Didn’t you ever appear before his friends? A. No. Never. We observe strict Purdah. Q. Is polygamy allowed in your family? A. Yes. For want of children. Bhutto Saheb joined politics. He needed educated life partner who may go accompany him every where. In our family girls were not allowed to go to school. We got only Quranic education. Now girls\n\n28. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 27 are getting educated. Q. Didn’t you ever go school? A. No. Q. Did they call you when the body of Bhutto Saheb was brought home on 4th April? A. Yes. Zia had given them instructions to allow first wife of Bhutto to have his (Bhutto’s) last glimpse in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto (In tears). That whole night from dusk to dawn we read Holy Quail and Durood. All of a sudden son of Munshi Nazir Muhammad came and lamented calling “YA HUSSAIN. YA HUSSAIN”. At first I thought that there might be some sort of fighting outside, then I asked that what had happened. My mother veepingly asked for “Kafan” for Bhutto Sahib. It seemed as if mountain had fallen upon me. I couldn’t control myself and asked them to take me there. I went there. Four hundred army men were present there. We were without purdah, barefooted and bareheaded. That moment was like ‘KARBALA’ for us. We had reached in ‘AUTAQ’ to see Bhutto’s body there in the presence of heavy contingents of army. They didn’t allow us to see him fully. Even we were not permitted to give him ‘ghusal or kafiin’. Zia got killed all those ‘MULLAS’ who had given ghusal to Bhutto’s body even. JALAD was also killed. Q. You were allowed to see his face only? A. I was not in my senses at that time. I saw him upto the chest. My sister Akhtar saw his body and said it had torture marks Q. When did you see Bhutto Saheb more happy? A. He always remained in good mood and happy.\n\n29. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 28 A SISTER SPEAKS Mrs. Munawar-ul-Islam I have frequently read that my brother Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a controversial figure. People either love or hate him. I am perhaps the only person who knows him well. We grew up together. Of our childhood days certain memories cling. One was of father’s long absence in England where he had gone for the Round Table Conference. In those days we heard of only one dacoit. The servants often talked of his daring and defiance. Our sister Benazir was then a baby. Zulfi and I liked to hear of the dacoit who the servants said was forced to leave his feudal masters village. The reason we never learnt. However, as night approached we felt scared. Our house was three-storied. From the second floor we climbed the staircase to the third to sleep in a Spanish type courtyard during Larkana’s long hot summers. That night Zulfi and I called out from the stairs the name of each servant to check whether they were all present. It made us feel secure. We played in the extensive grounds and lawns of our garden and ran after the rabbits. Those were happy, carefree days. As were the days proceeding our departure for Bombay where father was to represent Sindh. Sindh was then attached to Bombay. The sea voyage thrilled us. We explored the ship and made friends with other children. Father had to be six months in Bombay and six months in Poona. Poona had a much better climate. My sister Mumtaz and I were admitted to a boarding school: The Convent of Jesus and Mary. Zulfi’s health was indifferent; therefore, he was admitted to a day-school St. Mary’s and he returned to Bombay with my parents. While in Poona we went home for the week-ends Zulfi was always waiting for us in the car, well before time. Once he told us he had a surprise. He brought out his bicycle he had learnt to ride. During the Poona season there were many social activities which my parents had to participate in. so the three of us went to movies sometimes. We loved the tonga rides and engaged two tongas accompanied by a servant. We tried to over-take each other’s tonga. The cinema was in the cantonment not far from our house. I remember the name of one movie. “The 39 Steps” which starred the late Robert Donat. He became our favorite actor. Whatever pocket money we got we got movie magazine, which contained pictures of Robert Donat and competed with each other to collect the most. The following year we saw “The Scarlet Tonga” and then Donat was forgotten and we\n\n30. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 29 were buying the series of “Scarlet Tonga” books. One week-end we spent with the Deputy Commissioner of Khandala Mr. Parpia. The Parpias took us walking to Echo Point as it got dark we started our walk back. We all thought we knew the way but Khandala is a hill-station surrounded by thick tall trees and many turns into various lanes Zulfi and my little sister Benazir were walking ahead of us suddenly we lost sight of them. Mother panicked but Parpias said they must have reached. They were not home, at this the Parpias also got worried but assured mother search parties were being sent after then, mean while we were nervous. An hour later they were found they had taken the tong route which brought them to the bazaar. Mr. Parpia asked Zulfi. “Did you get afraid? The woods are thick and some monkeys come on the road.” He replied that he was not as such in a crises. He remembered mother calling to Pir Dastagir and he did the same. Mumtaz and I went to Bombay for our Christmas holidays. Zulfi took us to his favorite shops. It was the time of the British Raj. The shops were stocked with so many things. Large variety of all sizes of chocolate and biscuits tins, toys, the best were the Christmas stockings like treasure-chests filled with balloons, masks and little things. Zulfi’s favorite story was Hiawatha which he was never tired of hearing it from Mumtaz. She also read him the Scarlet Pimpernel stories. When Sindh was separated from Bombay we returned to Karachi. In Karachi we all went to day school. We lived on Club Road and our house was called Hordley House. The house is still there. I have visited it on several occasions and each time the years roll back reminding of me our happy, stay there. We again returned to Bombay. Father had served Sindh with dedication. His contribution was recognised for he never lost any election except the last one. He decided to serve Sindh as Sindh’s representative in The Public Service Commission. Zulfi was now in the Cathedral High School and cricket had become his obsession. He played in the junior team and later in the senior team. He was an ardent fan of the well known cricketers of the time. Kardar and Amarnat but his favorite was Mushtaq Ali. There was a wide age-gap but he still befriended them. One of Zulfi’s school friends Omar Kureshi who remained a friend to the end lived in Dhanraj Mahal. It was the meeting place of cricketers and other sportsmen. Zulfi spent many evenings there. In his final year of school he got very attached to a girl named Suriya. He phoned her every day at a certain time and asked me to continue phoning when he left for the States to join Berkeley college. He was keen to marry her but somehow it did not work out.\n\n31. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 30 Politics also interested him. Pandit Nehru’s younger sister Mrs. Krishna Huthee Singh was our neighbor. Pandit always stayed with her when he was in Bombay. On one of his visits Zulfi was determined to meet Pandit Nehru. Not that this was difficult. Across the low dividing-wall we saw the garden and pathway crowded with people in the Ghandi dress. Zulfi walked through the open door. He was a young student not in the white Congress dress. Panditji noticed him and called him near. Panditji asked Zulfi his name and then his views on Pakistan. Zulfi was a enthusiastic Pakistani. Panditji told him that youth was always emotional but India was a large country which would soon become great and India needed young people like him to serve it. Zulfi tried several times to meet the Quaid-i-Azam who lived on Malabar Hill but he was not lucky. The Pathan chowkidar promised to let him in when Jinnah Sahib was in residence but the few times Zulfi tried he was out of Bombay. He did meet Miss Jinnah and many years later reminded her when she was living in Mohata Palace. Mumtaz was now married and was living in Hyderabad Deccan which again left Zulfi and myself with mother in our Cumballa Hill apartment. Father was in Junagadh. Zulfi had to shop for winter clothing and baggage. I often. accompanied Zulfi and his best friend Jehangir Mugaseth on the shopping sprees. In the baggage shop I saw a train-case for the first time and kept holding it. Zulfi noticed and told me to keep it. It would go into his baggage account. Zulu’s favorite restaurant was “The Parisian Diary”. The shopping sprees ended with a visit to The Parisian Diary. Zulfi, mother and I drove to Poona to visit the grave of our youngest sister. We all went to Poona once a month. Years later, whenever Zulfi visited India on official work he always went to Yaseen Jog in Poona. The day came for Zulfi to leave. Mother and I went with heavy hearts to Bombay’s Santa Cruz Airport to see Zulfi off. After Zulfi’s departure, mother left for Karachi by sea because of the heavy baggage. I flew to Karachi a day earlier and stayed with Lady Hidayatullah and when mother joined me each morning we went house bunting till we found a house that suited its on McNeil Road. It was to this house that Zulfi returned for his summer holidays. He came home every summer. Abroad he had missed home and family and did not socialize in Karachi. He preferred being in the house and enjoyed mother’s cooking. His favorite dishes were Chicken Seekh, fried Potatoes (Sindhi Style) and Carrot Halva. I heard many stimulating and absorbing conversations and discussion between Father and Zulfi. Father was conservative and brought up in a feudal\n\n32. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 31 environment. Father’s love of reading and wide travels made him much more liberal than the other feudals nevertheless he was of the old school of thought. Zulfi had socialist ideas. He believed in the power of the people. He envisaged a future of social justice and equal opportunities. He put down his ideas in a booklet which he had published. It is our misfortune that we do not have a copy of that booklet. When Zulfi was in his final years at Oxford he met Nusrat who had come to visit me. He met her on several other occasions and they decided to marry. Father wanted him to wait till be returned home for good but Zulfi and Nusral preferred to marry which they did and both left for England. When Zulfi was home for his holidays. I remember another incident. Qasim our mali, was bitten by a snake. Mother asked me to phone Junagadh House for our driver who lived in the quarters. Zulfi jumped out of bed rushed out and drove Qasim to Jinnah Hospital. He realized it might be too late to wait for the driver. He always looked after his dependents. Yar Mohammed the land manager had to have a major operation. Yar Mohammed wanted only surgeon Amanullah to do it and Dr. Amanullah operated on him. Babu our bearer had been with us since Larkana days. My father got him married and sent his four sons to St. Anthony’s School. After Father’s death Zulfi looked after their education and got all four good jobs. If my brother had another face I did not see it. I have only read about it by his critics. Personally I was upset about his Baluchistan action. All my life I had heard my father speak with respect for the Baluchees. Father had many friends and contacts in Baluchistan which border Jacobabad in Sindh. Zulfi, however, said at the Supreme Court hearing that he had long wanted to withdraw the artily but met with stiff resistance from Gen. Zia. When Zulfi returned to Karachi after completing his education, father arranged for him to work with his friend Dingo Mal Ramchandani who had a law firm. He also had to visit Larkana frequently to help father. He more or less took over the management of the lands as father was not keeping good health. On one of these visits he met Iskander Mirza at Uncle Ahmed Khan’s house in Naodero. Iskander Mirza went several times to Naodero for partridge shooting. He knew my father and was much impressed by Zulfi. Zulfi was in Geneva for The Law of the Sea Conference when we lost father. He returned immediately on receiving our telegram. He sobbed and was inconsolable. Father and son were very close inspite of different thinking. Zulfi came to know of his appointment in Iskander Mirza’s cabinet when he and Nusrat were in Rex Cinema. On the screen they read that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s\n\n33. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 32 presence was desired at Government House. I presume his whereabouts was given by 70 Clifton. It was then he learnt that he was to become Commerce Minister. We were happy for Zulfi but at the same time felt father’s absence poignantly. Zulfi immediately left for Garhi Khuda Baksh to offer ‘Fateha’ at father’s grave. That same night Nusrat had to go to the hospital. A few hours later Shah Nawaz was born. He was a beautiful baby and grew up to be a handsome man. Little did we know then what the future held for him. Shah Nawaz would become a victim of conspiracy and was murdered in a foreign land at the age of twenty six. General Zia did not only deprive our family but the whole nation of an outstanding and brilliant personality. Even his detractors cannot deny he was a great patriot. He would have been a great asset. He was well educated, very well read. An orator respected by the great statesmen of the time: Soekarno who put all Indonesian asset at the disposal of Pakistan at the time of our first war with India. Nasir of Egypt, Chou-En-Lai, the late King Faisal, President Assad of Syria. Col. Gaddafi with whose contribution we were able to acquire a Nuclear Plant, the former President of France Giscard D’Estaing. Zulfi was respected and world leaders were his personal friends. He initiated friendship with China. No other Pakistani can claim personal friendship and equation with world statesmen. After Quaid-e-Azam he was the best known Pakistani in the world. Zulfi’s trial invoked world interest. Many representatives of the Muslim countries were in Islamabad to plead for his life. They realized his life was valuable to the Muslim World. I am very fortunate that this great man was my brother. As a brother he was affectionate and thoughtful. In his school days when he went on trips with his friends he always brought back gifts for us although he had to manage on a tight budget. After my marriage he always kept in touch. I asked his help for friends and acquaintances and our servants and he always obliged. I am proud of his many contributions but most proud of his tremendous courage and dignity in the days of his trial and in the death cell. In his cell he enlightened my husband and myself on various subjects. His behavior was as if we were visiting him in 70 Clifton: cheerful and alert. Only a person absolutely innocent could be so. I will always regret not been allowed to see him on his last day on earth although we were not aware of it. I visited him every Wednesday. He knew that and expected me. My husband and I reached the jail and were told Nusrat and Benazir were with him. That was bewildering. It was not their days for visiting him. However we waited and saw a car with dark windows up drive past. We were then told by the authorities that our visit was cancelled. After meeting Zulfi\n\n34. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 33 we always drove to Sihala to meet Nusrat and Benazir who were in detention. On that Wednesday we also drove to Sihala but the police guards at the entrance told us we could not meet our relations. We now feared the worst. We contacted the two lawyers who were still in Rawalpindi and heard from them that Benazir had sent a message that the execution was on the following day, Thursday. I could not believe that it could happen and was in a daze. The lawyers suggested we leave for Larkana. We drove to the P.I.A. office. No tickets were available for Moen-Jo-Daro and we had to fly to Karachi. By the time we reached Nao Dero it was too late. The Women’s havelli was crowded already. Everyone was crying. I felt to drive to our graveyard. Here there were men and women reciting the Holy Quran seine silently some aloud. “I stood near my brother’s grave near me was an old peasant showering rose petals on the grave. He sighed very deeply and said in Sindhi. “Aba Zulfikar Ali! you have left us. What is to become of us!”. Did the peasant have a foreboding of a Sindh without Bhutto. Did he see the burning and destruction of Sindhi’s lands and crops by Gen. Zia’s men. Did he see the anguish pain and deprivation of the Sindhi people or Jain Sadiq’s reign of terror? Who knows Sindhis are born mystics.\n\n35. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 34 MONJO PAYARO CHACHO Shabnam Bhutto One whose sell was larger than the largest deserts. whose love was deeper than the deepest oceans. whose person was cooler than the coolest drops of dew. whose challenging; tone was bolder than that of the bravest lions. whose sight was sharper than that of Shaheens (lying at great heights. whose rock hard principles were stronger than the highest Himalayas. whose vision reached the farthest horizons. whose loving personality would make him yours for ever. whose thought was higher Than the highest skies. And who was named after the Holy name of Maula Ali Murtaza. whom people remember as their own Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Shaheed. he was my uncle, the younger brother of in father Late Sikandar Ali Bhutto. In the same was that he was loved by the children, youth and old citizens, he loved and was loved by his family members. Each and every one in the family loved him immensely, we still love him and shall continue to love him. We know that he and his love for his family and his people live on. My sister Rukhsana was a very small child when she sat down on a hunger strike with her beloved uncle during Ayub days. He was protesting against Ayub, but I went on a hunger strike, because he could not come to our house due to his very busy political engagements after his release from jail. I sent a message that I will not take anything till such time he visited us. He rushed to our house. My hunger strike was over then and there, but Rukhsana insisted on carrying on her hunger strike, till such time her dear uncle was on a hunger strike. “Children do not go on hunger strike. Please take something”, he tried his best to make Rukhsana understand. But she would not listen. Her hunger strike ended when Shaheed Chacha himself ended his own hunger strike. Shahecd Chacha loved cauliflower and carrot Achars, which my aunts used to prepare with their own hands. We also love these Achars. However, although years have passed after Chacha’s shahadat, we have not touched these Achars.\n\n36. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 35 After the death of our father, he gave a lot of love to our brother Imdad Ali Bhutto. He being a boy could remain with his uncle all the time and Chacha was always so caring and concerned about him inspite of his own very busy schedule. I remember that during a rainy winter my brother joined Shaheed Chacha on shikar. My brother being a little careless was not wearing any warm clothing. Chacha called the servants and was angry with them because they had ignored to give Imdad warm clothing to wear in that extreme cold. He took off his own warn coat and made Imdad put on that coat. Chacha’s coat is still treasured by Imdad. His political engagements kept him away for long intervals, but he always kept himself aware and informed of everything about us. His love could not be measured by the time he gave to us. We knew that he never belived in making a show of it. But his love was deep, sincere and immense. Rukhsana, when still very small got sick. Together with that she was also upset with her Chacha and complained that Chacha could not find time to come to see her. But Rukhsana’s doctor told us that Chacha used to telephone him every day to know about Rukhsanas condition and the results of various tests. Whenever he would be in Larkana he would comc to visit us. Usually he would be so busy that he could only visit us late at night. The children would wait for him and would never go to sleep without meeting him. I and my sister were from our childhood interested in composing verses. He knew of our interest and whenever he would come he would make it a point to ask us to recite our verses. Much as we loved to recite our verses. I remember that I would freeze with nervousness, when ever he would say, “so what have our young poetesses composed this time. Let us listen”. But his encouragement over what ever we had written in that young age would give us new confidence and so our talents for writing poetry grew and we continued to write. As children we wrote a poem for him. Although it did not rhyme very well. I still remember a verse which I will quote here.\n\n37. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 36 When we grew up we started writing short stories and novels. These would usually be tragic. Nusrat Auntie was concerned. She told Chacha. “I ask them not to write tragedies. They should write things which make readers happy”. “Do not slop them. Let them write what they feel. Whatever they want to write”. Chacha advised her. Little did we know that a real life tragedy awaited us and the nation. A strange incident took place after Chacha’s Shahadat. People used to say that they had seen Chacha’s picture in the moon. I and Rukhsana would keep awake every night from the moon rise to its setting staring at the moon. We did not see Chacha in the moon, but after about three months of his Shahadat we went to Sehwan to pay our respects at the Mazar of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. Even there I and Rukhsana continued our stare at the moon. Every morning around four o’clock we used to go to the Mazar. After returning from there we would take tea and then go to sleep. It was Fair time on Friday. We had returned from the Mazat. I took my tea and remained in the courtyard, while Rukhsana went inside to sleep. Rukhsana relates that she was woken up by a strong light that was falling on her eyes. When she opened her eyes she saw that Shaheed Chaca was standing in the adjoining room. He was wearing emerlad green Shalwar Kamiz. Rukhsana was startled. She immediately closed her eyes, and then she heard a voice. “Today is Friday. Bhutto Shaheed had come to the Mazar to pay his respects. On the way back he stopped to see his children.” In our last meeting in his death cell he had regretted. “Today I can not offer you even a cup of tea”. Even now the teacup shakes in our hands when we remember these words. When we were children we used to feel proud of the great Martyrs of Islam and\n\n38. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 37 wished in our hearts that we were born during the days of these Martyrs. We wished to have net them. On that last meeting on the 1st of April 1979, when we saw our lion hearted Chacha fighting the battle for his principles, we knew that we were face to face with the Hydcr Ali, the Tipu the Sirajudaula of our times. And today when my brother Imdad Ali narrates before his children, Mehdi Raza, Zaigham Abbas, Mohammad Jawad, Sikandar Ali, Ali Hussain, or my sister Rukhsana tells her sons the stories of the great Martyrs of Islam, they include the story of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Shaheed. With hint they have a blood relationship too besides having a relationship of devotion. I would end by quoting a poem that I and Rukhsana wrote for shaheed chacha.\n\n39. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 38\n\n40. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 39 AN IDEAL OF MILLIONS Tariq Islam When I was asked to write this article, my reaction oscillated between a sense of pride and a degree of consternation. To recall memories of the Shaheed as an uncle is a difficult and complex undertaking. Were he an ordinary man, an ordinary uncle, one could fill pages with mere platitudes. He was neither Mr. Bhutto the leader and legend towered high above ordinary mortals. From so youthful an age so encumbered was he with his work and politics that one has to journey repeatedly through the windmills of the mind to recall glimpses of an unburdened, relaxed man who for a fleeting moment or two was simply an uncle. I too, from a very young age was obsessed with the desire and passion to know this great man as a leader more than to know him as simply an uncle. I was awed by him. He fired my imagination even though I was no more than a boy. His charisma worked with children too! My love and admiration for the man was, in a strange surreal sense not an ordinary one.... in the sense that love for Zulfikar Ali Bhutto the leader of men transcended the love of a nephew for an uncle. During his time as a minister in Ayub Khan’s cabinet, the Shaheed was a frequent visitor to our house in Hyderabad, where we lived in those days. I can recollect so clearly his first visit following his appointment as minister for Commerce. My parents had thrown a huge party in his honour and our house was lit up like a bride. Hyderabad was a much smaller city in those days --- almost rural in ambience. The commissioners, D.Cs. the I.G.P., the city notables and the feudals were all there. A shy little boy waited excitedly at the portals away from the sprawling lawns where the guests were assembled. His cavalcade arrived amid the blare of sirens. As he stepped out of his car, I waited on my haunches while my parents greeted hint .... then like a sprinter making the final lunge to the finishing line. I rushed towards him to offer my congratulations. I could see that he was touched. He broke into a broad grin and holding my hand he asked me to accompany him to the waiting guests. For me that was a moment of uncontrolled ecstasy, as I loved being near him and listening to him talk to the grown ups. I would happily surrender two hours of his time chatting to me for listening to two minutes of his conversation and his views expressed to politicians and officials. So many names, so many faces. He knew them all by name and had a different greeting for each. The discussion ranged from a crop failed in Tando-Jam to the machinations of super powers. The Shaheed’s rise in the Ayub government was meteoric, reaching a climax with his appointment to the portfolio where his real passion lay. He became Pakistan’s\n\n41. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 40 Foreign Minister which provided him the access to international stage upon which he could bring into play his unbelievable and consummate skills and mastery in power politics and global gamesmanship. These were heady days. A youthful and vibrant foreign minister was captivating the hearts of the young at home and winning admiration abroad. He identified with the downtrodden and the dispossessed. He became the champion and spokesmen for the underdog and a Third World bulwark against the ravages of imperialism and neo-colonialism. His close liaison and friendship with the symbols of revolution and resistance of the 1960’s - ---Soekarno, Nasser, Ben-Bella and Chou En Lai were reflective of the fires burning in his own heart and the destiny he had chosen for himself and his country. For the youth of Pakistan he became the Pied Piper. A country used to aging and ailing politicians, lacking in both charisma and integrity the arrival of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was like the dawning of the Genesis’s first chapter. Here at last was a man to fill their hearts with pride and bring them out into the streets in spontaneous joy. The Shaheed’s historic speeches at the U.N. where he tore the Indian delegation into shreds and subsequently his heroic resistance to the Tashkent Declaration made him the fantasy of every young dream. The 60’s was an era of revolution. The gale force winds of change were sweeping away the old order. It was an era which took within its wrap the re-sculpturing of political, cultural and social milieu. To be young in the 60’s and to be Bhutto’s nephew was intoxicating. School friends would gather in groups to talk about him. They would query me on every minor, insignificant detail I could give them and waited with baited breaths as I gave my impressions. I was no longer the nephew of Mr. Bhutto the ex-Foreign Minister. I was the nephew of a folk hero. I remember the historic train journey he undertook on 20th June 1966 from Rawalpindi to Larkana after resigning from Ayub’s cabinet. Multitudes came out to greet him at even stop. big and small. The sea of humanity which had gathered at the Lahore railway station has very few precedents in terms of spontaneous emotion and adulation that was displayed. Tears trickled down the Shaheed’s eyes as he surveyed the ecstatic and delirious crowds. The handkerchief he used for wiping away the tears was grabbed and battled over for possession. All this at a time when no one dared to whisper a word against the dictator for fear of the punishing wrath of a draconian regime. By this time we had shifted to Karachi and this was also the period in which I perhaps saw him most, as the Shaheed too had moved to Karachi and taken up residence there. I was at his house virtually even day, playing cricket or just hanging around with my cousins. Ayub Khan’s intelligence had put him under surveillance and the visitors were all hounded and harassed. To escape the gauntlet, the Shaheed would often arrange to meet people at our house. He invariably arrived before his guests and chatted with us. He would ask about my progress at school and keep stressing upon the value of good education at which point I would ask if I could put on his favorite song “Strangers in the night”,\n\n42. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 41 knowing full well he won’t refuse that offer. I was least interested in hearing his harangue about school and studies. I wanted to hear him on politics and his political plans. For this I would have to wait until his guests arrived and would then lurk in corners to eavesdrop on the ensuing conversation. I must admit I learnt a great deal from these regular eavesdropping sessions. By this time the political climate had started heating up and beneath the calm exterior dissent and discontent was taking root. Ayub was by now a most hated man while the popularity of Mr. Bhutto was growing in equal measure. People were looking to him as a catalyst of change. My friends and I were growing impatient. They would pester me and I in turn would direct our common complaint at my cousin Mir -- “when will your hither start his movement against Ayub Khan. What is he waiting for opportunity is passing him by.” But the Shaheed was a master of political timing. His timing and his each step was carefully calculated and weighed in precise political scales. Combining the best in science and art to his political calculation together with his innate and instinctive political sense made the Shaheed a formidable politician. His entire thesis on politics was built around the concept of timing. He believed politics had its own dynamic force, its own electric field. He knew precisely when it was time to ignite the fuses that would blow away dictators. The moment finally arrived in early 1967. Fearful of the Shaheed’s growing popularity, his compelling youth and his iconoclastic and idealistic image, Ayub Khan encouraged his ministers and minions to assail him on public forums. Mr. Bhutto was, likewise, compelled to defend his reputation and honour on public forums and thus the forum for political debate was created, which was to prove the watershed mark in the political mobilization and movement, leading eventually to the downfall of the Ayub regime. Pakistan Peoples Party was formed on 30th November 1967 at an inaugural conference held at the residence Dr. Mubashir Hasan in Lahore. Shortly afterwards, I rushed to get my 25 paisa membership of the Party. The PPP archives would show that subsequent to its formation, I was among the first batch of common people to join. Having given birth to PPP, the Shaheed launched a frontal attack on Ayub. The manner and style adopted by him was unique in Pakistan’s history for two main reasons. First, no politician before had dared so boldly to speak out and agitate against an established dictatorship that, by its sanguinary methods, drove fear and terror in the hearts of people. Second, no one had previously addressed the masses directly. Not only did the Shaheed do this, but he also spoke to them in the language and idiom they related to. The Shaheed cut across the conventional lines of political discourse to direct his appeal to the poor and the dispossessed. His address at the Hyderabad rally in the autumn of 1967 drew such a magnificent public response that a panic stricken and scared regime got the Governor of West Pakistan, General Musa to react with a shoddy and typically\n\n43. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 42 callous rebuke. Musa taunted the Shaheed by claiming that only the rickshaw walas. Tonga ‘alas and labourers were there at the rally to hear him. The brilliant and adroit politician that he was, the Shaheed responded by accepting the charge of addressing a crowd of Tonga and rickshaw walas and reminded the Ayub government that he was indeed proud to represent the shirtless masses. The Shaheed was soon touring and rallying the crowds from Karachi to Khyber. He barnstormed across the countryside and cities. He toured every village and every town, every hamlet and every hut. His charisma and magic carried a magnetic field that drew huge crowds every where he went. As the momentum grew and the political temperature rose, all of Pakistan was in the grip of a revolutionary fervor. A despondent and desperate Ayub Khan reacted by arresting the Shaheed in November 1968. Protest rallies were held throughout Pakistan and I remember going out with my friends to join one in Karachi. We were tear gassed and baton charged and together with a few companions I ended up in a police lock up, where we spent several hours until a friend used his influence to get us out. The Shaheed’s affidavit filed before the high court was a political masterpiece. Not only did it challenge his unlawful incarceration but also served as his political testament which was to fire the imagination of the students, intellectuals and professionals. Hitherto, the government through complete press censorship had ensured that the Shaheed’s public speeches and statements were totally blacked out. Inadvertently, Ayub Khan had created the interstices through which he himself would fall. The PPP had printed “Free Bhutto” badges and I recall walking down Karachi’s Elphinstone Street with Benazir distributing these badges. Enthusiastic crowds gathered and before we knew, we had run out of the badges. I wrote to my uncle at Sahiwal Jail to pour out all my emotions and sentiments. I was delighted to receive his letter in reply to mine and to this day I have preserved that letter as my most prized possession. He wrote. “Not until I received your affectionate letter of January l5th did I realize how much you have grown. Of course I have seen you grow but that is not the same as getting an idea of your mental growth: Your letter gave me that idea and made me feel very happy. Time passes very fast and very slowly, depending on how one is placed. Somehow, children always seem to remain children no matter how much they grow.” Elsewhere, he wrote about his favorite subject of lecture---education: “In the world of today, there is nothing more important than knowledge. Every thing can get lost or taken away except knowledge. Everyone knows that but it is truer of today than of the past. You must select your career carefully and really concentrate on it.” He wrote so succinctly about the country, its people and youth that even 24 years later, when I read that letter today. I can feel a chill running down my spine. Some of the extracts I would like to reproduce; “Things are moving fast. Pakistan is entering a new phase. We must understand the future and be prepared for it. I am glad you are taking an active interest in what is\n\n44. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 43 happening. This is a very good sign. The younger generation has a great deal to do with shaping the future of this country. I any very attached to the youth of Pakistan. I understand its feelings: that is why the Noting have been so kind to me. I have tremendous faith in the capacity of the new generation. I know it will effectively meet the challenge of the future. The country is going through a difficult period but the difficulties will pass. We have to make sacrifices otherwise the future cannot change for the better. Now that the people have made sacrifices, I am confident that a more equitable society will emerge. Life in jail is not very pleasant but that does not matter. It is most elating to know that the people remember me. There is nothing better to hope for than to be in the hearts of the people. I have done my best to serve the people of Pakistan and that is why they have not abandoned me. Please make it a point to keep in touch with events. The more you study the causes of the present crisis and go into its why’s and what’s, the better will be your understanding of life. My time in jail will pass. No dictator in the world can bring it to a stop. None of you should worry at all. It will be utterly wrong if you did not concentrate on your studies on account of such setbacks. In reality, we have not received a setback. Time will Insha’ Allah show that we have not. But even if the difficulties are real, the mind must be trained to face them. On the contrary, because I have been unjustly put in jail, you should concentrate more on your studies to ensure we have a future free from such excesses. We are a poor country with limited resources. These resources have to be well harnessed to reduce the misery of our people. Socialism is the only way by which it can be done. If Ayub Khan had understood this, he would have been in less trouble today.- It is not a matter of what we like but what is good for the people. Sooner or later, people get what is good for them. Nobody can stop it. If socialism is explained properly, it will not only be understood but also accepted by the people. Our Party papers called the “Foundation Papers” explain what we mean by socialism. Only those who rob and loot the people will oppose socialism. But they will not be able to rob for long. Soon they will be held accountable. Please do not worry about me. Look after yourself, work hard and prepare to serve your country.” The letter comprised two full scape typed pages and given the Shaheed’s pre occupation with the court and lawyers, I was obviously touched beyond measure. In February 1969, the High Court ordered his transfer to house arrest in Larkana. I travelled to Larkana with my cousins. A beaming Mr. Bhutto, immaculately dressed in a dull, bottle green suit greeted us at the porch. Air Marshal Asghar Khan who had accompanied us on the flight to Mohenjodaro arrived with us. It was obvious that jail had not dampened the Shaheed’s spirit.... only made him more defiant and confident of success. This was an immensely exciting time. The Shaheed had unleashed a tidal wave of protest against oppression and with the students forming the spearhead, demonstrations, rallies and marches were becoming, for the first time, a part of Pakistan’s political culture. And here we were with the man himself. It was exhilarating to be with hint. To hear him speak,\n\n45. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 44 to follow him. The Shaheed called for the release of all political prisoners and for an end to the state of emergency. Towards this cud, he began a hunger strike. Through out the period of hunger strike lasting three or four days he sat out at the porch of Al- Murtaza in full view of the slogan chanting crowds gathered outside. The mounting tide of public pressure compelled Ayub Khan to capitulate to the demands and the Shaheed was released. A victory march through the streets of Larkana followed as huge enthusiastic crowds sang and chanted “Jive Bhutto” and “Khati aiyo khair san Ho jamalo”. It was a moment of sheer magic. The apotheoses rendered have been reserved in history only for saints. The Shaheed Would bring his fists together in simulation of hand cuffed hands of a prisoner and then tear them away to symbolize the breaking of the chains. The dramatic effect of this act sent the wild sea of humanity into uncontrolled frenzy. I was with my cousins atop the truck as it made its snail like passage through the narrow and congested Larkana streets and was completely mesmerized by this giant of a man who sent electric impulses through every vein, nerve and muscle. Suddenly, a man appeared before our truck, pulled out a revolver and aimed at the Shaheed. There was not a sign of panic or fear on the Shaheed’s face. His first instinct was to turn towards us to ensure our safety. In the meantime, quick as lightning, the angry mob had grabbed the would-be assassin and begun to render street justice. The Shaheed intervened and asked Katpar and Hayat Mohanuned Khan Sherpao who were accompanying us on the truck to save the Juan from the wrath of the mob. Ayub Khan’s last desperate bid to stop the Shaheed in his tracks had failed and now the end was nigh. The Shaheed decided to return to Karachi by train and I was thrilled that I could accompany him together with my cousins. We boarded the Bolan Mail bound for Karachi and were all in the same compartment through one of history’s greatest train journeys. In between the stops, the Shaheed kept us riveted with his anecdotes and his hilarious mimickery of Ayub Khan. All through the night and into, the next day, the train would screech to a halt at every small, wayside station and at very stop the scene was much the same. Whether it was Dadu. Sukkur, Kotri or Hyderabad, people turned out in their multitudes to greet their leader. The Shaheed would emerge from the compartment to mesmerize them with his theatrical oratory and they would go into wild unrestrained rapture. It was a spectacle of messianic incantation that Lenin could not match during his own historic journey back home following the Russian Revolution. During the course of the journey we were joined at various intervals by other PPP leaders among whom I can recall Mumtaz Bhutto and Hafeez Pirzada. We finally arrived at the Karachi Cantonment station where a human avalanche had already struck. Old men and young, women and children had gathered in\n\n46. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Recollections and Remembrances; Copyright © www.bhutto.org 45 their thousands to catch a glimpse of their political messiah. The air was rent with “Bhutto Zindabad” and “Ayub Murdabad” slogans. The Shaheed led a massive procession through the streets of Karachi, at each stage throwing down the gauntlet to Ayub in defiant speeches. Things began to move at a very rapid pace and finally Ayub Khan succumbed to relentless street pressure and handed over power to Yahya Khan. An election date was announced and soon the Shaheed was on the hustings touring the remotest corners of Pakistan long forgotten and forsaken by the Country’s rulers. As a youth, I recall attending each and every public meeting addressed by him in Karachi. A few days prior to the general elections, I went to Larkana again with my cousins. Finally, the day itself arrived and as the results began to come in, they surpassed all our expectations. It was a resounding victory for the PPP and many a feared and famous name fell before its electoral juggernaut. The Shaheed sat in the lounge of Al-Murtaza listening to the results on the radio and accepting the greetings of people who were steadily streaming in. The PPP had swept the polls in West Pakistan and the Shaheed had confounded the establishment, the political pundits and commentators who had forecast no more than a handful of scats for him. The Shaheed’s emphatic victory at the polls was followed by a dark and sordid period in the country’s history precipitated by the ugly machinations and Byzantinist game play of the military junta. After the fall of Dhaka a defeated and dispirited junta handed over power of the truncated Pakistan to the Shaheed. What followed was an epoch making period for Pakistan already recorded in history and signed by the Shaheed in his own blood. 5th July 1977 was to be Pakistan’s blackest day. Like a thief in the dark, General Zia overthrew the popular and democratic PPP government, followed by a kangaroo trial and the judicial murder of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in one of history’s most sordid and vindictive court room plays. I was in London throughout most of Shaheed’s incarceration as were Mir and Shahnawaz. In the last week of March 1979, Mir asked me to visit Pakistan with the purpose of meeting his father to convey certain messages. At this time we were also busy organizing an international jurists conference in London to review the trial papers and expose the farcical nature of the entire trial. My task was also, therefore, to gather all the legal material available and bring it back to London. With some trepidation, I finally arrived in Rawalpindi and following my application to the interior ministry, was given permission to meet my uncle on 27th March. I arrived at the Pindi jail at the appointed hour. On a long and winding walk passing through many steel gates to his cell, my heart was heavy and I could feel my entire body in a state of nervous affliction. It was like going to see a lion caged. Through out the walk towards the cell, Yar Mohammed, the"
