        "text": "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (born January 5, 1928, near Larkana, Sindh, India [now in Pakistan]—died April 4, 1979, Rawalpindi, Pakistan) was a Pakistani statesman and politician who served as president (1971–73) and prime minister (1973–77) of Pakistan. Although a popular leader, he was overthrown and executed by the military.\n\nBorn into a noble Rajput family that had accepted Islam, Bhutto was the son of a prominent political figure in the Indian colonial government. He was educated in Bombay (now Mumbai) and at the University of California, Berkeley (B.A., 1950). Bhutto studied law at the University of Oxford and then practiced law and lectured in England. Upon his return to Pakistan (1953), he set up a law practice in Karachi, where he was appointed a member of Pakistan’s delegation to the United Nations in 1957.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nPakistan: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\n\nAfter Mohammad Ayub Khan seized the government in 1958, Bhutto was appointed commerce minister and then held other cabinet posts. After his appointment as foreign minister (1963–66), he began working for greater independence from Western powers and for closer ties with China. His opposition to the peace with India after the 1965 war over Kashmir caused him to resign from the government, and in December 1967 he founded the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP). Bhutto denounced the Ayub Khan regime as a dictatorship and was subsequently imprisoned (1968–69).\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Ayub Khan regime by Gen. Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, national elections were held in 1970. Although Bhutto and his party won a sweeping electoral victory in West Pakistan, the biggest election winner was the Awami League, an East Pakistan-based party that had campaigned for full autonomy for East Pakistan. Bhutto refused to form a government with this separatist party, causing a nullification of the election. The widespread rioting that followed degenerated into civil war, after which East Pakistan, with the help of India, emerged as the independent state of Bangladesh. After West Pakistan’s humiliating defeat by India in this military conflict, Yahya Khan turned the government over to Bhutto on December 20, 1971. Bhutto placed his predecessor under house arrest, nationalized several key industries, and undertook the taxation of the landed families in his first acts as president. After the new constitution (1973) made the presidency largely ceremonial, Bhutto became prime minister. In both capacities, he had also filled the cabinet posts of foreign affairs, defense, and interior. His government, retaining martial law, began a process of Islamization."
