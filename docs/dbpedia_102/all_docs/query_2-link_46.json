Reid was head coach at Snow College in Utah for two seasons before landing at Southern Utah.\n\nFormer North Dakota State head coach Greg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) has a 54-54 record in his fourth season at Iowa State. McDermott was 15-11 at NDSU in 2000-01 after posting four straight 20-win seasons in six years at Wayne State in Nebraska. He moved to Northern Iowa for a five-year stint, where he left after three 20-win seasons and NCAA first round appearances. McDermott is in his 16th season overall with a 275-181 record.\n\nABOUT NORTH DAKOTA STATE: The Bison are 5-8 overall and sixth in The Summit League with a 2-2 record after a 65-59 home loss to Oral Roberts last Saturday.

Back-to-back home losses against Idaho and Wisconsin-Green Bay on Nov. 21 and 27 marked the first time in six years that the Bison have lost twice in a row at home. NDSU shot 32 percent in both games and went a combined 8-for-44 from the 3-point line. Northern Michigan and Michigan Tech were the opponents Nov. 21-22, 2003, when the Bison last dropped consecutive home games.\n\nFELT BREAKS SHOOTING SLUMP: North Dakota State freshman guard Mike Felt broke a three-game shooting slump Dec. 5 at IUPUI when the Bison needed him the most. Felt's third straight 3-pointer capped an 18-3 run and tied the game at 65. He had missed his previous 14 straight field goal tries against Western Illinois, Wisconsin-Green Bay and UC Davis. Felt has missed the last six games with a foot injury.\n\nBIG NIGHT FOR BIG FRESHMAN: Six-foot-9 freshman forward Jordan Aaberg had his biggest night in a North Dakota State uniform Nov. 27 in the 71-62 loss to Wisconsin-Green Bay. Aaberg had season highs of 12 points, eight rebounds, six blocked shots and five field goals. His six blocks were the second most in NDSU single-game history and one shy of the school record. Aaberg had 10 points and three blocks in the final 5 minutes, 41 seconds of the first half to help keep the Bison within three points at halftime, 27-24.\n\nLARGEST COMEBACK IN THREE YEARS: North Dakota State's 15-point comeback for a 63-62 victory at UC Davis on Nov. 24 was NDSU's largest comeback for a victory in three seasons. The Bison trailed 17-2 but tied the game at 24 with a 15-0 run midway through the first half. NDSU led by as many as eight points late in the game, but the Bison committed turnovers on the final four possessions and went scoreless over the final 3 mintues, 31 seconds. The 15-point comeback was NDSU's biggest since 2006-07 when the Bison erased a pair of 15-point deficits to beat Princeton (57-50) and Southwest Minnesota State (72-68).\n\nLEADING SCORERS GONE: North Dakota State graduated its Nos. 1, 2 and 7 all-time leading scorers from last year's 26-7 NCAA tournament team. Guard Ben Woodside (2,315 points), forward Brett Winkelman (1,962) and guard Mike Nelson (1,562) accounted for 66 percent of NDSU's scoring last year. In fact, one of those three players was NDSU's leading scorer for 64 straight games until forward Michael Tveidt poured in a game-high 21 points against Oakland in the Summit League championship game. Tveidt, the only returning starter from last year's team, was the fourth-leading scorer with 9.8 points per game.\n\nBISON PICKED FIFTH IN THE SUMMIT: North Dakota State was picked to finish fifth out of 10 teams in The Summit League according to a preseason poll of the league's head coaches, sports information directors and media. Oakland received 34 of 35 first-place votes, Oral Roberts was picked second, IUPUI was third with one first-place vote, and South Dakota State was picked fourth. Oakland guard Johnathon Jones was voted Preseason Player of the Year. NDSU forward Michael Tveidt was named to the preseason second team.\n\nTeam (First Place)\n\nPts\n\n1.\n\nOakland (34)\n\n520\n\n2.\n\nOral Roberts\n\n426\n\n3.\n\nIUPUI (1)\n\n422\n\n4.\n\nSouth Dakota State\n\n401\n\n5.\n\nNorth Dakota State\n\n303\n\n6.\n\nIPFW\n\n265\n\n7.\n\nSouthern Utah\n\n250\n\n8.\n\nWestern Illinois\n\n176\n\n9.\n\nUMKC\n\n141\n\n10.\n\nCentenary\n\n89\n\nTHE SUMMIT LEAGUE: This is North Dakota State's third season as a member of The Summit League, an NCAA Division I athletics conference that sponsors 19 championship sports.
