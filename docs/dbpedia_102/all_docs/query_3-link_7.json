        "text": "Three ranked teams, including the No. 1 team in the country, will travel to Maui in 2014\n\nThroughout the 2013-14 college basketball season, we will take a look at each team from the 2013 and 2014 fields and see how they are playing. This week's update features the teams coming to Maui next November for the 2014 EA SPORTS Maui Invitational.\n\nArizona\n\nThe Wildcats have been the nation's best team so far in 2013-14. With a perfect 13-0 mark, Arizona is ranked No. 1 in both polls and enters conference play as the favorite to win the Pac-12. The Wildcats are led in scoring by junior guard Nick Johnson, who averages 16.0 ppg and is a lockdown defender. Forwards Brandon Ashley (So.) and Aaron Gordon (Fr.) are both averaging 12.5 ppg and lead the team in rebounding with 7.0 and 7.6 rpg respectively. With a neutral court win over then-No. 6 Duke and a road victory at Michigan, Arizona is in prime position to make a run for the No. 1 overall seed in this year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nBYU\n\nJunior Tyler Haws has lived up to his preseason All-American hype with a 22.2 ppg average in his first 12 games this season. The Alpine, Utah native missed two games due to injury, but leads the WCC in scoring and is shooting 41.0 percent from behind the arc. BYU had an impressive early-season win at Stanford but has struggled lately against one of the nation's best non-conference schedules. Four of the Cougars' losses have come to Top 25 teams, including an overtime loss at No. 10 Oregon just before the holiday break.\n\nChaminade\n\nThe Silverswords followed up an impressive showing at the 2013 EA SPORTS Maui Invitational with three consecutive victories over Division II opponents. Chaminade also held a second-half lead over in-state rival Hawaii before falling to the Rainbow Warriors on the island of Kaua'i. The 'Swords ared led in scoring by senior guard Lee Bailey, who is averaging 15.8 ppg and has scored 44 points over Chaminade's two PacWest Conference games. With 10 players averaging double-digit minutes per game, Chaminade should have the depth to make another run at the NCAA Division II Tournament.\n\nKansas State\n\nAfter a slow start, K-State has now won seven in a row, including an impressive 72-62 victory over then-No. 21 Gonzaga in Wichita. The Wildcats also knocked off 2013 SEC Champion Ole Miss during the streak. True freshman guard Marcus Foster has impressed early, leading the 'Cats in scoring (13.7 ppg), 3-point shooting (26-of-75, .347) and minutes played (29.6). Junior forward Thomas Gipson missed two games earlier this season due to injury, but has made his presence felt upon returning to the lineup. The bulky big-man leads K-State with 5.7 rpg and is second on the team in scoring at an 11.4 ppg clip. The Wildcats kick off Big 12 play with a bang, opening the campaign vs. No. 6 Oklahoma State on Jan. 4. A week later they travel to Allen Fieldhouse to take on their in-state rivals, No. 16 Kansas.\n\nMissouri\n\nAn 11-1 start has the Tigers ranked No. 25 nationally with impressive non-conference wins vs. then-No. 18 UCLA and at NC State. With just two games remaining against ranked opponents, Missouri appears likely to win 23 games or more and earn an NCAA Tournament bid for the sixth consecutive season. The Tigers are led by redshirt juniors guards Jordan Clarkson (20.0 ppg) and Jabari Brown (18.1 ppg). Clarkson leads the SEC in scoring and has already earned SEC Player of the Week honors three times this season.\n\nPittsburgh\n\nThe Panthers have also started the season 11-1 and are currently receiving votes in both polls. Their lone loss came by one point off a last-second putback on a neutral floor against Cincinnati. Redshirt senior Lamar Patterson does a little bit of everything for Pitt, leading the team in scoring (17.1 ppg) and assists (55) while shooting a remarkable 45.3 percent from the 3-point line, the fourth-highest mark in the ACC. Sophomore guard James Robinson leads the conference in assist/turnover ratio at 5.0. The Panthers will play their first league game since joining the ACC on Jan. 4 at NC State.\n\nPurdue\n\nWith 10 wins in non-conference play, Purdue has put themselves in great position to return to the NCAA Tournament, after missing out on the Big Dance in 2013 for the first time in seven years. The Boilermakers already have wins over opponents in the ACC (Boston College) and Big 12 (West Virginia) and their only losses have come to strong opponents away from home (Oklahoma State, Washington State and Butler). Offensively, Purdue is led by senior guard Terone Johnson. The Indianapolis native is averaging 14.0 ppg. On defense, the Boilermakers have 7-foot sophomore A.J. Hammons manning the paint. A Big Ten All-Freshman selection last year, Hammons leads the Big Ten in blocks with 3.8 bpg, a full 1.5 bpg more than anyone else in the conference.\n\nSan Diego State\n\nThe Aztecs have won 10 consecutive games and boast an 11-1 record, with their lone loss coming to Arizona, the No. 1-ranked team in the country. Currently ranked No. 20, San Diego State has already defeated then-No. 20 Creighton and then-No. 25 Marquette at neutral sites. They open Mountain West play on Jan. 1 at Colorado State before traveling to play No. 16 Kansas on Jan. 5. A pair of seniors have been instrumental to the Aztecs' success, as guard Xavier Thames leads the team with 15.6 ppg and is shooting 47.1 percent from 3-point land. Forward Josh Davis is averaging 9.0 ppg and 10.7 rpg, ranking second in the Mountain West in rebounding. The 10-man rotation for head coach Steve Fisher has San Diego State seeking its ninth consecutive 20-win season and fifth consecutive NCAA Tournament berth."
