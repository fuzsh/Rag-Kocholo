        "text": "Ray Allard\n\nRay Allard is one of only two LI Track and Field athletes to be a New England Champion. In 1951, Ray was the New England Champion in the pole vault, clearing a height of 11 ‘11”. This was when pits were ground level and filled with sawdust, and the poles were made of bamboo or sometimes steel, and athletes needed to land on their feet to avoid serious injury. A far cry from the foam pits and fiberglass poles of today.\n\nRay was the State Champion in both the pole vault and the long jump two years in a row, 1950 and 1951. But also was the first LI pole vaulter to go over 12 feet. At 12’1/2”, Ray held the school record from 1951 to 1969, when it was broken by Larry Griggs with a vault of 12’1”.\n\nWhile almost 20 other vaulters at LI have gone over 12 feet in the pole vault in the past 72 years since Ray Allard first achieved the feat, he was the first to do it and the only one to do it without more modern types of poles and landing areas people have now become accustomed to using to vault.\n\nConsider this: In 1951, the world record in the pole vault was 15’7”. Which meant Ray was only 3’6” below the world record. Today, the world record is 20’ 5.25”. This means in a conversion, to be only 3’6” behind the world record today would put a high school vaulter at over 16’11”. Impressive indeed. Given the access to modern technology, who knows how high Mr. Allard could have gone.\n\nRiley Blankenship\n\nRiley was born in 1994 in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Derek Blankenship and Traci Williams. When she was a little over 1 year old, they moved to Lyndonville where she spent the rest of her childhood. She started playing sports from a young age, which included dandelion picking in T-ball and holding hands and skipping up and down the fields with friends at Lyndon Youth Soccer on Saturday mornings. In 5th grade she picked up basketball, which became her first true sports love. She played throughout high school, making the varsity team as a freshman. Her senior year was by far her best and that, as well as the team’s success and growth in that year, can only be attributed to the coaching wisdom and skills of Eric Berry; she also got the school record for blocked shots. She played softball from 7th grade to freshman year of high school at Lyndon Institute, and had the privilege of her late grandfather to not only umpire many of the games, but to also tell her to “suck it up buttercup” on more than one occasion (certainly formative moments for her athletic mindset and career). In sophomore year she decided to switch to track and field, and contributed to the team by sprinting the 100m, 4x100m relay, and throwing the shot put, discus, and javelin. Her success in shot put and discus would not have been possible without her excellent coaches, Mr. Bob Heath and Mr. Ron Pearl, who came out of retirement and put in countless hours of their expertise and wisdom to guide and mentor her. Riley made the record board in her senior year for both discus and javelin. She also did the heptathlon at the end of her junior and senior year. She graduated from LI in 2012.\n\nRiley attended college at Norwich University on an Army ROTC scholarship where she decided to learn a completely new sport and join the women’s rugby team. She played basketball her freshman year as well, but after one very busy and stressful year of two sports, nursing school, and ROTC and the Corps of Cadets, decided that one sport would suffice. Rugby became her second sports love – not only did she love learning all about the sport, but it also gave her a great community in college and two of her lifelong best friends. During her time there, the women’s rugby team won three 7s national championships and one 15s national championship; she was also named MVP in her junior year and was selected as an All-American in her junior and senior years. Riley graduated from Norwich University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing and commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army in 2016.\n\nRiley received orders to Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii, in the summer of 2016. She attended Basic Officer Leadership Course from October to December 2016, and arrived in Hawaii in January of 2017 to begin her Army nursing career. She worked on a medical-surgical unit for 3 years, serving many of Hawaii’s veterans. Having been born at that very hospital, she truly felt like she had come full circle. She stayed active by hiking and joining a CrossFit gym, and truly enjoyed all of what Hawaii had to offer. She moved to San Antonio in December of 2019 and completed the Army’s rigorous critical care course in May of 2020. She has been in San Antonio for almost 3 years and has worked on the medical intensive care unit at Brooke Army Medical center throughout that time. She continues to fulfill her passion of staying active by training for Strongman competitions (inspired by her aunt Erin Williams) and occasionally does CrossFit or other various recreational sports. Riley is in the process of transitioning to the Reserves over the next year, after 6 years of active duty service, and figuring out where the field of nursing will take her. She is hoping to work for the VA hospital system and do travel nursing through them.\n\nRichard Cameron\n\nRick Cameron, ’67 was born in Saint Johnsbury, Vermont. In 1971, after graduating from college, he married his high school sweetheart, Jane Howe, ‘67. They have three adult children and seven grandchildren. At this point in his life he enjoys an active retirement with his wife and family. In Rick’s own words:\n\n“My experience with began in the early 1950s. As a young child I started my schooling at the Baker Hall located on the LI campus. At the early age of first and second grade I became exposed to LI and its athletes by watching them practice and play their games on the football field (Lewis Field).\n\nDuring my eight years of elementary school and having gone to many LI sporting events I knew I was destined to play sports for LI. During my four years at Lyndon, I competed on the football, basketball, and track teams. I was chosen by my fellow teammates to be their team captain in both football and track. Football was my sport of choice. At the end of my senior football season 1966 the team was crowned Vermont State Champions. During that year I set several school football records, was selected to the State of Vermont All-North and State All-Star teams as well as being selected captain of those teams which were made up of the best players in Vermont. In the spring of 1967 I achieved one of my major high school athletic goals and that was the selection to and participation in the Vermont/New Hampshire Shrine Bowl game. The team’s selection to the LI Hall of Fame is a great honor.\n\nI would like to thank my high school football coaches Al Reilly, Bob Stone, Bob Heath, and Don Erskine to name a few. With their help I transformed my raw, yet unskilled, talents into an athlete who had strength in skill and determination. Thank you to all the members of my LI and greater Lyndon community for their support.” - Rick Cameron\n\nRalph Devereaux\n\nRalph Devereaux '59 was a member of the Vermont Division 1 State ChampionTrack and Field Teams in 1956, 57, and 58. These teams were inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame in the inaugural class in October 2021. Ralph was selected for individual induction for the class of 2022, and honored with the class of 2023.\n\nRalph was the Vermont Division 1 State Champion in 120-yard High Hurdles in 1957, 1958, and 1959. During those years, Ralph not only set the Lyndon Institute Record in the 120 High Hurdles, but he also set the Vermont State record in them as well. Ralph held the record by himself at LI until it was tied by fellow Hall of Famer Milt Norway in 1970. Ralph’s record of 14.9 seconds makes him only one of two LI athletes to run under 15 seconds in either the 120-yard or 110-meter high hurdles.\n\nRalph honed his craft by trying to knock coins off of the hurdles without moving the hurdle itself while crossing the barrier. He became elite at this training exercise and added to his reputation as being the best hurdler in Vermont at that time.\n\nBesides the 120 High Hurdles, Ralph was also the 1958 and 1959 State Champion in the 180 Hurdles. Again, he held both the LI and the Vermont State Record in this event with a personal best time of 20.8 seconds.\n\nRalph also participated in the High Jump, western rolling himself over 5”9.5” and into a ground level pit of sawdust. At the time of his graduation, Ralph was number 2 in the LI history books in that event.\n\nBesides Track, Ralph excelled in skiing and was a member of the 1956 and 1959 State Champion Boys Combined Ski Teams. Ralph went on to participate in the Juniors Ski Program and ski across both the Eastern and Western United States as well as Canada.\n\nAfter graduating from LI and as he hurdled through life, Ralph became a very successful businessman in the Lyndonville area, where he raised his family.\n\nRon Dunphy\n\nRon, Class of 1959, competed in football and track. His natural speed and agility contributed to both teams enjoying great success. Ron started making his mark his sophomore year on the track team as he grew stronger and started to train seriously. That hard work began paying dividends and in his junior year he became the first recipient of the Burns and Lewis Award for earning the most points in a single season-45! It was also that year that he was State Champion in the 100, 220, and 440 setting both LI and State records in those events finishing undefeated. The boys track team won the state championship that year and traveled to Rhode Island to compete in the New England Championship.\n\nThe team was able to repeat their championship the following year and Ron was able to again capture the title in the 100 yard dash. Ron considers himself grateful for his LI years not only for his accomplishments, but also because he got to train and compete with other amazing athletes such as Bob Heath, Tim Simpson and Ralph Devereaux.\n\nRon married his high school sweetheart, Leora (Thompson) Dunphy in 1960, who was also a classmate. They had four daughters Pamela, Patricia (Tissy), Paula and Peggy, nine grandchildren and four great grandchildren. Ron joined the National guard after graduation and worked as head of maintenance at the Lyndon Town School. Ron and his family have a long tradition at Lyndon Institute as his mother, his brother, his children, and some of his grandchildren are LI grads.\n\nCoach Don Erskine\n\nDon was born in 1924 to parents Warren and Hester Erskine and grew up at 518 Main Street, Lyndonville along with 1 sister Dorothy. He was full of curiosity and enjoyed learning how things worked, constructing model airplanes, and particularly enjoyed skiing with his friends which involved hiking up hills time and time again carrying wooden skis on their shoulders to experience the thrill of plummeting down the terrain, or going over ski jumps. A pair of these wooden skis, with Don’s initials embossed, are still on display in his daughter’s home today. When Don Erskine entered Lyndon Institute as a freshman in 1938 there were no ski teams at the time. However, the Lyndon Outing Club was founded in 1937 and, like many ambitious skiers, Don was drawn to the 35 meter ski jump in the Fletcher pasture, by the Oscar Baril Farm, which was later rebuilt to 45 meters. Here he honed his technical skills and fostered a love of ski jumping and competition that would later lead him to remain involved in the sport as the treasurer of the Eastern Ski Jumping Judges Association, long after he had hung up his own competitive skis.\n\nDon Erskine also had a love of learning. He was fascinated by science and technology. At age 16, he obtained his FCC radio operator’s license which is a skill that served him well during World War 2. Don left Lyndon Institute before completing his senior year to enlist with the 10th Mountain Ski Division. He was a technical sergeant in the Division Signal Corps radio and ski patrol in the Apennine Valley in Italy until 1946. When the war ended he had an opportunity to ski in the Austrian Alps for the sheer joy of it, and he talked about that experience many times later in life, although he always mentioned how happy he was to return to a peaceful world and his home in Lyndonville, VT.\n\nOn return from the war, Don Erskine completed his final year of high school, graduating from LI in 1947. During that year, he is also responsible for initiating the very first girl’s ski class at Lyndon Institute. He then went on to Norwich University for 2 years on the GI Bill, then to the University of VT graduating with a BS in Education in 1951. He was a member of the Alpine and Ski Jumping teams at both Norwich and UVM where he achieved many individual and team wins. 1951 is also the year that he married fellow Lyndon Institute alumnus Evelyn Coe (LI class of 1946), took a position teaching chemistry and physics at LI, and moved into the Sanborn House as a dorm proctor. Don and Evelyn eventually moved to Collison Cottage on the LI Campus, then further down the street in Lyndon Center years later. They had 5 children; Cheryl, Karen, Linda, Diane and Bryant who all attended Lyndon Institute.\n\nFor 15 years Don was a teacher and ski coach at Lyndon Institute from 1951 to 1965. His love for learning transitioned well for becoming a respected teacher, coach and mentor. Under his tutelage the Lyndon Institute Ski Team flourished. They won: • 13 district championships • Nine VT state championships - 1951, 1952, 1955, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963 • Two All New England championships 1960 and 1963. Don Erskine had high standards for himself and his students, whether it was in the classroom, a laboratory, or on the ski slopes. He believed that everyone can excel, but that there will also be times of defeat. He never berated a student or athlete for falling short of a goal, so long as the effort was strong. He believed that if you do your best, and continue to learn and improve from each experience that you have, then you are a winner. He also encouraged appreciation of being part of a team, something larger than yourself. This philosophy put into action is what made him a great coach. It also accounts for his unwavering loyalty to Lyndon Institute where, even after he left LI to become a research engineer, he continued to be a corporator and vocal advocate of the school and Lyndon Institute sports until his death in 1988.\n\nHe was inducted into the VT Ski Hall of Fame in 2003 posthumously for his service in the 10th Mountain Ski Division during World War 2. He would be equally proud and honored by this induction into the Athletic Hall of Fame at Lyndon Institute.\n\nMichael “Mickey” Goodwin\n\nMickey enjoyed sports from his youngest years in elementary school and excelled there as well as at LI (1951-1955). He was a well-rounded student and particularly enjoyed Music and the Arts. Bertha Koury, Mickey recalled, opened up a whole new experience for him.\n\nMickey was a starter on the varsity football team all four years and played quarter back his first three years and running back as a senior. He was third in the state his senior year for points scored in the state and in one game, versus Newport, ran two kickoffs back for touch downs. He was selected for the VT Shrine Team as a punter, return man, and running back helping VT record a 12-6 victory. In Track Mickey participated in the Long Jump, Javelin, Shot Put, Pole Vault, and the 100 Yard Dash. He held the LI record in the Long Jump at 21’ 1 ’ until it was broken by Milt Norway. In one meet his track coach, Mr. Lewis, asked him if he’d try the high jump as they needed a point to edge their rival that day. Mickey agreed, placed third, and gave LI the victory. After high school Mickey stayed active with baseball, softball, and archery among other pursuits. He won the 1963 VT Indoor Archery Championship.\n\nMickey’s children with his wife, Frances, also participated in sports at LI: Brad ’85, Casey ’87, and Joy ’89. His grandchildren followed in those big shoes as well. Dylan ’09, Breanna ’11, Rossen ’18, Sawyer ’21, and Brody, Emma, and Brinley are waiting in the wings.

A proud graduate of Lyndon Institute’s Class of 1973, Ernie was a three-sport athlete and left an indelible mark on the world of sports.\n\nAt Lyndon Institute, Ernie Gaskin showcased his talent by becoming a Vermont state champion in not one, but two track and field events: the shot put and the high jump. His athleticism extended beyond the track, as he was a formidable presence on the Vikings’ football and basketball teams, earning admiration and respect from teammates and opponents alike. He was nominated to the Vermont Shrine Football team.\n\nAfter his time at Lyndon Institute, Ernie briefly attended Kimball Union Academy, further enriching his education and athletic journey. Yet, it was his destiny in the world of Standardbred horse racing that would truly define him.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Ernie Gaskin embarked on a new chapter in his life when he arrived in the state of Indiana. The dawn of pari-mutuel racing presented an opportunity, and he and his wife, Darla, seized it. Together, they established Crimson Lane Farm, a harness racing training facility that set the standard for excellence. Complete with a state-of-the-art training track, two training barns, and a breeding operation.\n\nBefore venturing to Indiana, Ernie honed his craft as the second trainer for the renowned Billy Haughton, where he assisted in the training of illustrious horses like Peace Corps and Nihilator. His apprenticeship under Haughton solidified his reputation as an extraordinary talent in the world of Standardbred horse training.\n\nErnie Gaskin’s contributions extended beyond the racetrack. He was a founding member of the Indiana Standardbred Breed Development committee, dedicating countless hours to advancing the sport he loved. His advocacy for projects in horse racing, such as casino gaming at racetracks and enhanced breed development funding, played a pivotal role in shaping the industry in Indiana.\n\nRecognizing his immense impact, Ernie was appointed as a director for the Indiana Standardbred Association and achieved a prestigious position on the Hambletonian Society Board of Directors. His dedication and influence culminated in his induction into the Indiana Horse Racing Association Hall of Fame.\n\nToday, Ernie Gaskin and his wife, Darla, continue their legacy as they train a stable of horses and operate Crimson Lane Farm. Ernie and Darla have two daughters, Emily Ratcliff (husband Dr. Josh Ratcliff) and Amanda Gaskin. Ernie has a log home in Granby, Vermont, that he frequently visits with his family throughout the year.\n\nBob Heath\n\nA standout member of the LI Class of ’58, Bob was a star in football, basketball, and track. The ’56, ’57, and ’58 teams were State Champs in an era when all teams were grouped in a single division. He was a two-time State Champion in the 220 and the first of only seven LI throwers to reach 48 feet in the shot put.\n\nBob led his football mates in scoring his Senior year and set records for punting and receiving. His accomplishments led to his selection for the VT Shrine Team. He was honored to be recruited by Syracuse University as their punter but chose to stay home to work while also attending Lyndon Teachers College. He did note that Syracuse became National Champions in 1959. At LTC Bob competed in, and excelled at, soccer and track. He won a New England Championship in the 220 and along with his exploits on the pitch was selected to the Lyndon Athletic Hall of Fame’s second induction class.\n\nBob returned to LI in 1964 where he was a teacher, coach, and administrator-usually all at the same time-retiring in 1998. He remained a fixture on campus coaching track athletes long after his retirement, many of whom went on to set their own school records, and win their own state championships. Bob was inducted into the VT Principals Association Athletic Hall of Fame for his service to Vermont Athletics.\n\nDuane Johnson\n\nDuane was born in 1953 in Montpelier, Vermont, to David and Vinnie Johnson of Plainfield, Vermont. In 1957, he and his family moved to Lyndon Center. Throughout grade school, he was able to watch many football and track events. He started skiing on Dutton and Harris Hill in Lyndon Center with his twin brother and the Harris brothers. They would pack trails to ski on and build jumps to see who could jump the furthest.\n\nDuring the spring, they would make high jump standards and bars out of boards so they could compete against each other. Duane and his friends would play on the LI track, jumping over hurdles and using the long jump pit in the evenings after LI practices were over. From 6th through 8th grade, Duane joined the Lyndon Outing Club junior ski team coached by Reg and Dick Welch. He learned to ski slalom, giant slalom, ski jump, and ski cross country. He started competing in a few Eastern Ski Association meets during the weekends.\n\nThe highlight of 8th grade was competing against the LI high school JV ski team. In 1967, Duane attended LI and graduated in the spring of 1971. During high school, he played on the football, ski, and track teams, and was a co-captain of the ski and track teams during his senior year.

After college, Duane and Jane moved back to Lyndonville where Duane got a job at Ethan Allen in Orleans, Vermont, as a computer operator and was later promoted to computer programmer. In 1978, he started a new job at Fairbanks Scales as a computer programmer and worked his way up to IT Manager. After 41 years at Fairbanks Scales, Duane retired in June of 2019.\n\nFor a few years, Duane was able to help coach javelin at LI. He helped coach Lyndonville boys tee ball, Minor League, Little League and Babe Ruth baseball, plus girls Little League Softball. Duane also coached in the Burke Mountain Academy junior race program for eight years. He was fortunate to help a number of youngsters learn to ski race, and enjoy skiing.\n\nJen Kirchoff Layn\n\nJen was born in 1982 to Larry and Joan Kirchoff, and grew up in Lyndonville on Pudding Hill on the Circle K Farm. Living on a beef farm and helping with all sorts of farm chores taught her invaluable lessons that served her well in athletics, and life – the importance of teamwork and dedication.\n\nDuring her youth Jen was naturally competitive and participated in multiple sports, but by high school at Lyndon Institute chose to focus on girls soccer, boys ice hockey and softball, where she was a member of the varsity team all four years for each.

High school and college sports activity, specifically skiing, influenced the professional work direction I was to take. I can credit my early athletic development with enabling me to lead a pro-active lifestyle, both recreationally and professionally, I feel fortunate that that lifestyle remains with me to this day.\n\nEarly employment in public relations departments at Colorado and VT ski resorts led to several years of freelance photography and cinematography assignments in and outside of the U. S. Editorial photography throughout the mid-’60’s and 1970’s included published work for Today’s Health, Maclean’s Magazine, Ski, Skiing, Venture, True, Sports Illustrated, Travel and Leisure, Seventeen Magazine. Additionally, I worked at the 1968, 1974, and 1980 Winter Olympic Games as an accredited professional photographer.\n\nStill Photography morphed into motion picture photography with eighteen years as a regular cameraman for Warren Miller Productions in California, and several film projects with Edward Films of Chamonix, France and Eagle Bridge, NY.\n\nAlong the way photography stimulated my interest in photo-mechanical reproduction, and by working in the trade I learned pre-press skills and computer imaging. This was augmented with technical programs at Rochester Institute of Technology and at the Kodak Center for Creative Imaging in Camden, Maine.\n\nI joined the Stinehour Press in Lunenburg, VT early in its digital transformation and enjoyed several years as an imaging technician producing fine art reproductions for national publishing companies.\n\nRetiring from the Stinehour Press in 2004 I continued my activity in digital imaging working independently and in association with Stinehour Editions in Lunenburg, VT. Lancaster, NH has been my home for the past 24 years.\n\nMeg McCormack\n\nMargaret, “Meg,” was born in St. Johnsbury, the first child of William and Claudia McCormack. Named after her mother’s favorite Aunt Margaret (“Marnie”), who interestingly had polio as a teenager and was limited in her activities, yet rarely let that condition stop her from doing the things she loved. While Meg enjoyed skiing at a young age, she also loved to dance and took ballet lessons until her teacher relocated to another area. When Fenton Chester Ice Arena started offering figure skating lessons, Meg’s parents thought she might enjoy using her ballet skills on the ice; she did and became a successful competitor and also performed in many local ice shows during her school years. It was during her junior high years at Lyndon Graded School Meg heard about a summer track program being organized by some local coaches. With the help and encouragement of Paul Wheeler and Bob Heath, she developed a love for sprint running and jumping events.\n\nDuring the four years at Lyndon Institute, Meg played field hockey in the fall, kept up her figure skating skills in the winter, and participated in track and field in the spring. In 1989, she was a member of the field hockey team that made it to the Div. II Semifinals. From 1988-91, she was a member of the undefeated girl’s track team, winning the state long jump title each of those four years. She also competed in the triple jump, 100 yd., 4x100 relay, and 100 hurdles. At the 1989 New England Track and Field meet, Meg placed 4th in the long jump with an LI school record of 17.5”. Coach Merlyn Courser beamed that day! In 1991, Meg received the Gatorade Player of the Year Award for Track and Field. In addition to sports, Meg attended Girl’s State in 1990 and was inducted into the National Honor Society in 1991.\n\nMeg attended The University of Vermont on a partial track scholarship, graduating in 1995 with a degree in Medical Technology. Soon after, she moved to Boulder, Colorado with her college roommates, finding a job as a forensic chemist in a private lab and her future husband, Brian, on the ski slopes. While living there, skiing and hiking the Colorado 14’ers, she discovered she had a congenital heart defect that later required two open-heart surgeries.\n\nMeg’s quiet but competitive nature eventually led her back to an active lifestyle, competing in various road races and running her first marathon at age 40. Meg currently lives on the coast of Maine with her husband, where she’s raising two sons, a dog, and six chickens.\n\nMilton Norway\n\nMilt was born in 1952 to Milton and Ione Norway of Sheffield, the next to the youngest of eight siblings. Living in the rural town of Sheffield and attending Sheffield Graded School, Milt didn’t have the opportunity to join any youth athletic programs. It wasn’t until he entered his freshman year at Lyndon Institute that his natural athletic ability began to shine. At Lyndon Institute, Milt participated in football and track.\n\nMilt holds school records in indoor track in long jump (only LI jumper to go over 21 feet indoors) as well as school records in 45 and 55-yard hurdles. He holds the school record (tied with Ralph Devereaux) in the 120-yard high hurdles. They are the only 2 ever to go under 15 seconds in the hurdles At one time, Milt held the school record in the long jump, 21’ 10.5”, from 1970 to 1982 (broken by Mark Weigle) by .5”. He is still number 2 all-time\n\nat LI in that event.\n\nMilt remains in the top 10 of LI triple jumpers. At one time, he held the school record in that event until broken by Duane Johnson in 1971. After graduating from Lyndon Institute in 1970, Milt went to college to pursue his football passion at Huron College in South Dakota. After a short time there, his love of the Northeast Kingdom brought him back to Lyndon State College, where he continued to set records in track at the college level.\n\nAfter college, he enjoyed playing softball with local teams. He was very proud of his three children, Jeff, Chris, and Carrie. He enjoyed watching Jeff and Chris as they played baseball, football, and hockey both at the youth level, high school, and college. Although Milt passed away in 2014, he would have loved to watch his grandchildren pursue his love of athletics as they continue\n\nin his footsteps, setting records in baseball, football, and lacrosse.\n\nJudi St. Hilaire\n\nJudi St. Hilaire was the finest female runner (and occasional X-C skier) ever to wear maroon for the Vikings. All four years (Class of 1977) she set and broke records in fall X-C running and in track when spring finally rolled around. She skied X-C in her Junior year and the LI girls won their first State Championship! Judy led her fall X-C teams to championships in 1974,’75, and’76.

She also played in whole wiffleball seasons organized by her brother, and she also occasionally engaged in running races against her grandmother, Zelda Cox Simpson, who was extremely fast and an under-recognized athlete of the family.\n\nRunning was just an assumed path in the Simpson family. Susan was preceded by her sister Beth and her brother Timmy on all of her teams. She was coached by her father in cross country and track, guided by his unique brand of very quiet, but highly effective encouragement.\n\nWhile at LI, she participated in cross country, and track.

At that time Tim was the first Vermonter to run a mile or the metric conversion under 4 minutes. At the time it was the fastest 1500-meter time run by a collegian from New England.\n\nAfter graduation Tim moved into a graduate assistant and then assistant coaching position with the MSU track and field/cross country program which he held for three years before taking a high school coaching position and a job in private industry.\n\nTim took a position with the Michigan Office of Retirement Services in 1996 where he is still employed as a manager in their customer service process.\n\nTim and his wife Angela who is now a retired State of Michigan employee were married in 2004 and their only child, daughter Zee was born in 2005. They have lived in the Lansing, Michigan area the entire time and Zee is currently a senior at Lansing Catholic High School where Tim is coaching.\n\nTim took the coaching position at Lansing Catholic High School in 2000 and has been coaching boys’ and girls’ cross country and track at the school since.

She was a dancer, baton twirler, girl scout, cross country skier, down hill skier, track and field fielder, swim team member as well as a Shadow Lake water skier and sailor. It was no wonder that Wendy would go on to have such a successful athletic career in both high school and college.\n\nDuring her high school years, 1974-1978, Wendy received many team honors in cross country running, skiing and track and field events and even setting some team records but her individual honors showed her true abilities. In 1977, she was a Vermont Division I State Champion in Cross Country Skiing. In 1978, she was the Vermont Division I State Champion as Vermont Skimeister which meant she was the best female alpine and nordic skier in the State of Vermont. Wendy was the first female track and field athlete at LI to clear 5’0” in the high jump. She held this record from 1976-1994 and is currently ranked number three all time in the high jump at LI and one of only four female athletes, at LI, to clear five feet. Wendy was on the Junior Olympic Ski Team and competed all across the country as far away as Alaska. She also excelled in academics being a yearly member of the National Honor Society. At UNH, she continued with her passion for skiing and competed on their ski team. Wendy was also a sister of AXO sorority. Wendy has many life-long friends from both Lyndon and UNH.\n\nDuring college, Wendy met Christopher Griffin and they married many years later and raised their family in Hingham, MA. Wendy worked for many years as a purchasing agent for Sheraton Hotel before being a stay at home mom. Wendy was a devoted mother to her children and she enjoyed watching them in their sporting events. She was a devoted and skillful advocate for her autistic son, Daniel. Wendy enjoyed traveling, spending time with her family at Ho-Hum on Shadow Lake in Glover, Vt., family ski trips to Burke Mountain and Madeira Beach Florida.\n\nAfter a short period of declining health, Wendy passed away on January 28, 2017.\n\nMark Weigel\n\nMark was a three-sport star at LI in the early nineteen eighties: football, basketball, and track. His accomplishments and records were many at LI as they were up the hill at LSC. He was inducted into the LSC Athletic Hall of Fame for his successes there, so it is fitting that he joins the inaugural class at the formation of the LI Athletic Hall of Fame. Rather than submit a list of his athletic achievements Mark sent the following:\n\n“I have spent the past 32 years doing exactly what I always wanted to do, work with kids and be around athletics, which is why I have the best job I could ever imagine: teaching physical education. I have spent the past 30 years at Thetford Academy and look forward to more. The bulk of my coaching career took place in the 90’s. I coached varsity boys’ soccer and basketball. I was fortunate to have coached some great people and to win championships in soccer, ‘93 and in basketball, ‘94. All of my success began with great coaches and great teammates at LI!\n\nI left paid coaching positions to volunteer coaching as my children came through the youth sport’s programs. Once they reached the high school level, I stopped coaching and became a dad and fan for my three boys. Once my boys graduated from high school, I returned to coaching varsity soccer at Thetford Academy. I coached for eight years before I decided it was time to stop. I think back to my playing days and realize I can’t appreciate my mother enough. She was a single mom with four children, yet she attended all of my games, made sure I was fed, and where I needed to be. I owe her everything.” - Mark Weigel\n\n1966 Football Team Class II State Champions\n\nFootball at LI generates spontaneous enthusiasm and pride from the entire student body. With this heartening support the Vikings are encouraged to train and play in unison. The 1966 team was decked in flashy new uniforms and had the determination to win. On the helmets white wings, designed by the school’s art teacher, Miss Koury, became a symbol of the team’s speed and stamina. For the first time training camp was conducted in late August, under the guidance of Trainer, Ed Fregosi and Coaches, Al Reilly, Bob Heath and Bob Stone. During the eleven-day training sessions the boys developed in mind, muscle and competitive spirit.\n\nA telegram from the Minnesota Vikings Football Club was received that year sending them “The best of luck in one of the oldest rivalries in football-Beat St. J!” “To win all games and then lose to St. Johnsbury…this is like eating cake without the frosting, you can have anything in this world if you want it bad enough” – Coach Al Reilly. With these oft-repeated words ringing in the team’s ears, the Vikings crowned the season 7-6 against the Hilltoppers. Because of the exceptional record posted, Lyndon Institute was named Co-Champions Class II, by the Vermont Headmasters’ Association. The team members and coaches remember when Fred Bona fulfilled his promise to the team and footed the bill for a steak dinner prepared by many of the LI Boosters at the Lyndon Outing Club.\n\nTeam members: Stan Cass, Jim Chamberlain, Earl Daniels, Milt Norway, Tom Blake, Dana Emery, Alan Leach, Doug McGregor, Dave Hartwell, Wayne Fuller, Ed Toombs, Mike McFadden, Ed Cass, Don Smith, Bob Toombs, Capt.
