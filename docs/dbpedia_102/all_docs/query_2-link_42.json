They are the boys and girls from next\n\ndoor, or the next town. We watched them grow up, watched them\n\nplay when it was still play. Unfortunately, these luminaries are\n\nalmost inevitably dispersed because of sport's mercenary nature,\n\nlured away by scholarships or contracts. Well, we're bringing 'em\n\nall back home for the millennium--not necessarily to where they\n\nwere born, but to where they first showed flashes of the\n\ngreatness to come. Thus, Broadway Joe is in Pennsylvania, not\n\nAlabama or New York; and the Mailman is in Louisiana, not Utah.\n\nThe result: the top 50 from your state and, on the following\n\npages, a list of those from all 50 states.
