        "text": "Ben Brust finished his UW career as the most prolific long-range shooter in UW history. Brust exited Madison with a school-record 235 3-pointers and finished 27th in Badgers history with 1,048 career points. During his senior season, Brust also broke his own school record by knocking down 96 triples. Over his career, the shooting guard emerged as much more than just a long-range gunner, totaling five double-doubles and grabbing 437 career rebounds, despite his 6-foot-1 frame. Brust also added \"clutch\" to his legacy after making one of the most memorable plays in recent UW history, draining a half-court shot to force overtime in the Badgers' 65-62 win over No. 3 Michigan on Feb. 9, 2013. Owning some of the fastest feet on the team, head coach Bo Ryan has said the guard comes off a screen as quick as any player he has ever coached.\n\nCareer\n\n• Owns 124 career games played (73 starts)\n\n• Finished 27th in UW history with 1,148 career points\n\n• Recorded 5 career double-doubles\n\n• Scored 20+ points in a game 9 times\n\nHonors\n\n• 2013 and 2014 honorable mention All-Big Ten\n\n• Big Ten Co-Player of the Week (2/11/13)\n\nRecord Book\n\n• School-record 235 career 3-pointers\n\n• Made a UW single-season record 96 3-pointers in 2013-14\n\n• Made seven 3-pointers in a game on two occasions, equaling the Wisconsin record\n\n• His 7-for-7 performance from 3-point range vs. UNLV (Dec. 10, 2011) tied a UW and Big Ten record\n\n• Shot .899 (80-89) at the FT line as a senior, 2nd in UW history\n\n2013-14\n\nStarted all 38 games ... earned consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten Team honors ... third on the team in scoring (12.8) and rebounding (4.5) ... converted 96 3-point field goals, breaking his previous UW school record of 79 set in 2012-13 ... ranked third in the Big Ten in 3-point field goals made per game (2.5) and 11th in 3-point field goal percentage (.393) ... averaged a turnover every 48.8 minutes per game (27 TOs in 1318 min.) ... finished the season making multiple 3-pointers in 29 of 38 games ... ranked second on the team in scoring (12.6) during the NCAA tournament ... led the team in 3-point field goal percentage (min. 10 attempts) during the NCAA tournament, finishing 15-for-30 (.500) from beyond the arc ... reached double figures 29 times this season, including a 15-point, four-rebound performance against Kentucky in the Final Four (April 5), finishing 3-of-7 (.428) from 3-point range ... recorded 14 points and six rebounds against Baylor (March 27) in the NCAA Sweet Sixteen ... hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:07 remaining in UW's comeback win over Oregon in the third round of the NCAA tournament, a shot that broke the UW career 3-point FG record ... finished 6-of-9 (.667) from the field vs. American (March 20) in the opening round of the NCAA tournament, tallying 17 points and four rebounds ... tallied a career-high 29 points vs. Minnesota (March 14) in the Big Ten tournament, finishing 8-of-15 (.533) from the field ... tallied 20 points on 4-for-4 (1.000) shooting from 3-point range vs. Minnesota (Feb. 13), adding six rebounds ... scored 16 points at Illinois (Feb. 4) ... poured in 21 points against Northwestern (Jan. 29) ... recorded 18 points and shot 50.0 percent from 3-point range (4-for-8) vs. Milwaukee (Dec. 11) ... scored 13 points against Marquette (Dec. 7) and tallied 16 points, five rebounds and two assists vs. West Virginia (Nov. 26) in the championship game of the Cancun Challenge ... scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds vs. Oral Roberts (Nov. 23) ... scored 19 points, including a 5-for-6 (.833) effort from 3-point range, and grabbed six rebounds vs. Bowling Green (Nov. 21) ... recorded 10 points and eight rebounds against North Dakota (Nov. 19) ... tallied 11 points and nine rebounds against Florida (Nov. 12) ... scored 15 points and shot 37.5 percent from 3-point range in regular-season opener vs. St John's (Nov. 8)\n\n2012-13\n\nStarted all 35 games, posting 5 double-doubles ... consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honoree ...
