        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas – University of Alaska Anchorage skiers JC Schoonmaker and Espen Persen capped amazing seasons Tuesday with the ultimate honor for an NCAA student-athlete, both being named to the 2022 Academic All-America® Men's Division II At-Large Team, selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America.\n\nA senior from Tahoe City, Calif., Schoonmaker became just the 13th UAA student-athlete ever to earn First Team Academic All-America honors, while Persen was a Third Team honoree in voting by CoSIDA members.\n\nThe 'at-large' award recognizes the nation's top overall athletic and academic achievers, encompassing the sports of beach volleyball, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rowing, swimming & diving, skiing and tennis.\n\nSchoonmaker earned All-America honors in the 20-kilometer freestyle with a third-place finish and placed 11th in the 10-kilometer freestyle at the NCAA Championships, helping UAA to a fifth-place team showing. The All-Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association First Team performer also competed at the Beijing Olympics in February, where he paired with Ben Ogden to finish ninth in the team sprint event. He also finished 13th in the freestyle sprint and 66th in the 15-kilometer classic at the Games.\n\nAmong his seven top-10 finishes, Schoonmaker won three medals at the US National Championships in January, racing to gold in the freestyle sprint and bronze in the classic sprint and 15-kilometer classic.\n\nIn the classroom, he earned National Collegiate All-Academic Ski Team honors from the U.S. Collegiate Ski Coaches Association and graduated in May with a 3.96 grade-point average in natural sciences.\n\nA junior from Oslo, Norway, Persen raced to a pair of All-America awards on the Nordic trails, finishing ninth in the 10-kilometer classic and eighth in the 20-kilometer freestyle at the NCAA Championships. He earned All-RMISA Honorable Mention honors after posting four top-10 finishes on the season, including runner-up in the classic race at the Utah Invitational and eighth place in the freestyle race at the UAF Invitational. Persen finished 10th in the freestyle and 14th in the classic races at the RMISA/NCAA Regional Championships.\n\nPersen also earned National Collegiate All-Academic Ski Team honors from the USCSCA and graduated in May with a 3.73 GPA in finance.\n\nSchoonmaker and Persen become the 43rd and 44th Academic All-Americans in UAA history, and join fellow 2021-22 honorees Eve Stephens (volleyball) and Tennae Voliva (women's basketball) to tie for the Seawolves' most ever in an academic year (1995-96 and 2001-02).\n\nThe Academic All-America teams are nominated and voted upon by members of CoSIDA and recognize student-athletes of sophomore standing or higher who are starters or significant reserves for their teams with a minimum GPA of 3.30 or better.\n\nUAA All-Time CoSIDA Academic All-Americans (44)\n\nYear Student-Athlete Sport Honor\n\n1988-89 Meganne Hendricks Volleyball 3rd Team\n\n1994-95 Elena Tkacheva Gymnastics 1st Team\n\nAllegra Stoetzel Women's Basketball 3rd Team\n\n1995-96 Kyle O'Kelly Men's Skiing 3rd Team\n\nBobby Taylor Men's Skiing 3rd Team\n\nElena Tkacheva Gymnastics 2nd Team\n\nAllegra Stoetzel Women's Basketball 1st Team\n\n1996-97 Rick Stafford Men's Basketball 2nd Team\n\nDoris Hausleitner Women's Skiing 3rd Team\n\nZuzana Razusova Women's Skiing 3rd Team\n\n2001-02 Janelle Veith Volleyball 3rd Team\n\nTobias Schwoerer Men's Skiing 1st Team\n\nTobias Schwoerer Men's Cross Country 2nd Team\n\nAurore deMaulmont Women's Skiing 2nd Team\n\n2002-03 Tobias Schwoerer Men's Skiing 2nd Team\n\n2004-05 Mandy Kaempf Women's Skiing 1st Team\n\n2005-06 Brian Gregg Men's Skiing 2nd Team\n\nMandy Kaempf W.
