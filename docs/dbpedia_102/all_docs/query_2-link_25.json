        "text": "Both Ramon and Julie Beck descend from original Alpine settlers dating back to the early 1850’s. Their parents, June and J. Paul Beck and William Grant and Geraldine Bangerter were their examples of leadership and participation in the close-knit Alpine society. During the summer of 1973 Julie and Ramon met in their Sunday School class; they were married in December of that year and made their home in Alpine. It was in Alpine that they raised their three children; Gerilyn, Joseph and Heidi. Together they participated in community experiences in education, drama, music, Church, and service.\n\nWhen Julie was 4 years old, her family moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil where for five years she was immersed in mission life, school, culture, and language. Ramon benefited from growing up in the unique rural life of by-gone Alpine times; hunting, playing sports, and helping with the farm and other chores.\n\nBoth Ramon and Julie graduated from American Fork High School; Ramon played basketball, football and accompanied the High School Choir. Julie joined the drill team, school choir and orchestra. Following high school Ramon served in the Italian Mission and Julie attended and graduated from Dixie College after which they both graduated from Brigham Young University. Their family culture has been centered around happy home life. music, church, and community service. Ramon has accompanied church congregations and choirs for decades. Julie and all the Beck children have taught dozens of Alpine youth in their private piano studio, participating in local music teachers’ associations and events.\n\nAlong with busy community involvement, Ramon served for over 25 years as a Chief Warrant Officer in the Utah National Guard as an Italian language specialist, interpreter, and Intelligence officer. He had many great experiences traveling to Italy and other military assignments during those years. He also served as an Alpine City Councilman for two and a half terms.\n\nBoth Ramon and Julie have been abundantly blessed from teaching and leading in various Church responsibilities; fulfilling assignments in Scouting, various presidencies, Missionary Training Center and serving as Bishop. New adventures world-wide began when Julie was called as a General Officer in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; first as a member of the Young Women General Board and Presidency, then as Relief Society General President. As President, she assisted on a number of Church committees including Church Welfare and Church Education. Following her release from those opportunities she began over a decade of service in Higher Education with Brigham Young University\n\nand assignments from the Governor of Utah, recently completing a term on the Board of Higher Education.\n\nRamon and Julie enjoy riding in the mountains and foothills in their Jeep, traveling with their family and hosting their eighteen grandchildren.\n\nRonald Wesley and Kathleen Moyle Rasmussen have proudly called Alpine home for 56 years. Growing up in Alpine and being a direct descendant of one of its founders, John Rowe Moyle, Kathleen had strong roots and feelings for her hometown and knew Alpine was where she wanted to raise a family.\n\nRon grew up in Lehi and came from hard-working pioneer stock also, so the union of Ron and Kathy was a natural. They were married on July 7th, 1961. In 1966 while living in Salt Lake, they determined the time was right to move, so their hearts led them back to Alpine.\n\nAll that love and hard work were built and nurtured in the same house they live in today. Having seven children, a strong work ethic, and devotion to their small town, led them to years of community service. They believed then and still believe that a community is everyone’s responsibility, so they dug into everything from numerous church callings, to helping with the Alpine Days activities, to fundraising drives and many other worthwhile endeavors.\n\nIn the early 80s, soccer came to Alpine, and Ron and Kathy wasted no time jumping in to help build the growing sport for the community. They started coaching their children’s teams, but the new league needed help in many areas. Seeing the need, they became certified referees and spent hours on field preparation and continued coaching. Ron became the League President, and Kathy went on to coach a 14/15 all-girls competition team.\n\nIn 1982, Ron ran for Alpine City Council. He was elected and served on the council from 1982 – 1986. After his first term as a councilman, he made a successful run for Mayor of Alpine and served from 1986 to 1990. During those years, Alpine did not have a city administrator or an engineer, so those responsibilities were overseen by the mayor. What was supposed to be a part-time commitment seemed like a full-time responsibility, but one that Kathleen and all the kids rallied around in support of Ron and the city they all loved.\n\nWith a growing family, Kathleen was always busy but chose to serve as a voting registrar for Alpine District 2 for over 15 years. As a former elementary school teacher, she understood the value of education and gladly served on the PTA board for many years as PTA president for Alpine Elementary. She continues to serve as a member of the Alpine Daughters of the Utah Pioneers.\n\nMoyle Park did not always have a paid caretaker. Because of the family affiliation, Ron and Kathy were asked by the city to look after the park. When the city hired someone for the upkeep of the land, Kathy became a tour director for the park and home of John Rowe Moyle and took many schools and summer groups on those tours. Many friends, neighbors, and newcomers to the area were recipients of Kathy’s homemade bread.\n\nTheir love for Alpine and their friends and neighbors was always manifested by their willing and helping hands. Ron and Kathy taught their children to work hard, love where they live, and make it better by getting involved and serving. As a result, the whole Rasmussen family, all seven kids, and their spouses, along with 33 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren, are filled with gratitude for this great honor given to their very deserving parents as the Grand Marshals.\n\nHunt was born on April 18, 1959 in Boulder, CO. The first child of Otis and Zella Willoughby. Two little sisters joined the family at later dates so he grew up the big brother to Laurel and Heather. Many childhood adventures involved the mountains of Colorado and activities included hiking, biking, motorcycle riding, fishing and family trips at Christmas to Mexico.\n\nAfter graduating from fairview high school in boulder, CO, Hunt served a 2 year mission for the LDS church in Germany. He loved his experiences there and still watches tv in German and reads in German to keep up his language.\n\nHunt attended and graduated from BYU with a bachelors in geology, a bachelors in German and a masters in geology. While attending BYU he met his wife Aniva. Aniva was born in Utulei, American samoa. When she was 5 years old her parents moved from American Samoa to Cardston, Alberta, Canada where they had extended family and there they raised their four children.\n\nHunt and Aniva married in Cardston, Alberta on August 23, 1984 and have two children. Melia is 28 years old and lives in the SLC area and Hunter is 16 years old and attends Lone Peak High School.\n\nHunt works for the state of Utah overseeing the disposal of hazardous waste at Energy Solutions. For 21 years Hunt served as an Alpine Planning Commissioner, an Alpine City Councilman and the Alpine Mayor. One of his favorite contributions to the city is the creation of Creekside Park which has become a great venue for Alpine Days.\n\nHunt loves the outdoors and has enjoyed adventures hiking mountains in Utah and Colorado, buckle rides in Utah, Colorado, Washington, and Montana. Rafting the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, family trips to Alberta, Canada and Montana, volcanoes and whale watching in Hawaii, hiking to Everest base camp in Nepal, zip lines in Costa Rica, research trips to Baja, Mexico, deep sea fishing in Alaska and riding his motorcycle across back roads of the USA.\n\nAniva received her Bachelors from BYU in Psychology and has worked full time before kids and part time after kids in various positions at Utah valley hospital and American Fork Hospital for 30 years. She loves being a mom to her two children and is hoping for future grandchildren because she has heard that it is the best. Aniva’s hobbies include making stuff, sewing, quilting and bonnet movies. (You know the kind where the cast wear hats or bonnets) She has gone on some of Hunts adventures and for some she has been the one at home with kids who kept the “home fires burning”.\n\nJay was born and raised in the tiny little town of Alpine, while Julia was raised in the tiny little town of Herriman, just over the mountain. Both places had a little mercantile, two gas pumps, and one LDS Ward. They have watched the growth and population explode throughout the years as each town was developed and became cities. Their great grandparents were the founding fathers and first settlers in both towns. Jay worked alongside of his father Marion for all his growing up years. He bailed hay, and fed animals along with all the other chores that farmers do. He knew how to drive the tractor when he was 6 years old. He irrigated the fields all hours of the day and night. Jay and his three siblings attended the school on the hill, Alpine Elementary, which had 6 grades in it. He was able to leave first to go to lunch each day because he and a friend helped carry his classmate, Junior Galetka, who had polio. They carried him up and down the stairs several times a day. Wintertime brought lots of fun. During recess, after school and on Saturdays the children would sleigh ride from the top of the hill, past the school, onto the road and continue down to Main Street. What a thrill! Jay started hiking up in the hills and mountains of Alpine at a young age. He later would hunt deer in the same mountains (he was an excellent shot). He has lot of stories about the old-timers and who was related to who and how things used to be “in the good ‘ol days”.\n\nJulia was the oldest of six children, having five younger brothers. They attended the little schoolhouse in Herriman, where there were 2 teachers and a total of 60 children in the whole school. Jay attended the combined junior high and high school in the schoolhouse on the hill in American Fork from 7th grade to 10th grade. He attended his last 2 years at the new American Fork High School, and graduated with 128 other students in 1961. He continued his studies at Utah State University. Julia attended West Jordan Jr. High School where she was a cheerleader for 3 years. She went on to Bingham High School and graduated in 1966. Jay laid hardwood floors for Lynn Hale. The biggest floor they laid was the original Deseret Gym, located where the LDS Conference Center is now. He served for six years in the Army National Guard during the Vietnam War, but his guard unit was never deployed.\n\nJay started working utility construction for Turner Construction until it closed. Meanwhile Julia worked at Electronic Memories in West Jordan making memory boards until they were married on July 24th 1969. Jay went on to work for Jay Tuft Construction for eighteen years until the company closed it’s doors. He then went to work for Westcon Construction laying pipe up and down the coast of California for six years. He was then hired by Alpine City in May of 1993. He served as the Public Works Director. He knew how to work with his men and they all admired him and had a deep respect for him. His two greatest accomplishments while working for the city were the pressurized irrigation and the downtown project, which was the curb and gutter and sidewalks in all of downtown Alpine. He also assisted Ula Hemingway in erecting many historical sites throughout the city. Jay attended every city meeting on Tuesday night for 20 years. During which time he was instrumental in planning and developing four city parks, and many other city projects.\n\nThe Healey family developed their family farm, which is now called Healey Heights. They created Healey Park for the city and donated the land for the Alpine High Bench LDS Chapel. Jay designed and developed their 100 acres of land. While Jay was working hard, Julia had 7 children, which kept her very busy. She considers her children her greatest joy and accomplishment. Her and Jay have 8 grandchildren and still counting. Julia and Jay served on the Old Folks Committee from 1972, until the program ended. They served as the chairman for many of those years. In the first years of their marriage, Julia was asked to teach 4-H classes. Her 4-H kids took many things to the County and State Fairs. Julia also shared her talents by helping with many “Road Show Productions”, in Herriman and Alpine. She choreographed dancing and applied all kinds of make-up, created backdrops and made costumes. She has taught craft classes in the Adult Education Program and in Relief Society Homemaking Classes. She started selling her crafts at the boutiques for years in the 1980s. Jay spent countless hours constructing tents, booths, power lines and water lines for Alpine Days. He hauled chairs, bleachers and equipment and did so much of the behind the scenes work. Julia organized the Alpine Days Fair at the Old Gym on the hill. It was filled to the brim with the best creations that Alpine people brought and displayed. For 29 years their children rode on floats that she made or rented. She also helped with the fish- pond and other concessions, even the bake sale for the DUP.\n\nJulia owned and operated Sunshine Preschool for many years. Her love of children was demonstrated every day as she taught them. Many people were sad when she retired. Are you a Sunshine School Graduate? Julia creates fun and laughter wherever she goes. She knows how to have a great party. In fact, she taught classes on parties and reunions for the Stake Relief Society and surrounding community wards. Julia has served in many LDS Church capacities. She has served in many presidencies on the stake and ward level. She is now serving as a Compassionate Service Leader and enjoys helping others.\n\nJay and Julia have lived in their four-generation home for 47 years. Jay has remodeled and added onto their home throughout those years. They have traveled the whole world over and found “there’s no place like home”. Alpine is a beautiful city and a wonderful place to raise children. There are lovely views from every angle and every season adds to its charm. We love Alpine!"
