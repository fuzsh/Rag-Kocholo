        "text": "Alex Trautwig/Getty Images\n\nDuring BYU Basketball's annual media day, head coach Dave Rose announced this season's team captains (h/t Salt Lake Tribune).\n\nJunior guards Matt Carlino and Tyler Haws will be joined as captains by sophomore guard Kyle Collinsworth in his first season back with the team after completing his LDS mission.\n\nThis year's BYU team is unique in that there are no seniors on the roster. However, the selection of Haws, Carlino and Collinsworth as captains is hardly surprising.\n\nHaws served as a team captain last year despite not having had a full offseason to train after completing his mission. It's not hard to see why, considering he was statistically one of the best players in the country last season.\n\nHaws finished seventh in the country in scoring and first in the West Coast Conference. He had 25 games in which he scored 20 or more points and averaged 21.7 points per game on the season.\n\nPart of his scoring prowess came from his impressive proficiency from the free-throw line. Haws was second in the WCC in free-throw percentage and 17th in the country, shooting .877 from the charity stripe.\n\nHaws also averaged 4.6 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.3 steals per game.\n\nCarlino is in his third season at BYU after transferring from UCLA during a redshirt freshman season. The Cougars' point guard has frustrated fans during his time in Provo with his inconsistency but started to find his stride last season, especially towards the end.\n\nDuring BYU's 2012-13 campaign, Carlino averaged 11.5 points, 4.8 assists, 3.6 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game. His 64 steals on the season were the fourth-best total in school history, and his 171 assists place him third in school history in that category.\n\nDuring BYU's NIT run, Carlino was a force to be reckoned with, averaging 18 points and eight assists per game in the tournament.\n\nCollinsworth has only one season of NCAA experience under his belt, but it came during BYU's 2010-11 season that saw the school make it to the Sweet 16 and engulfed the country in Jimmermania. Collinsworth proved to be versatile, playing more of a forward position for the team once they started losing big men left and right.\n\nHe averaged 5.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game in his one season with BYU. Those numbers reflect a player who came off the bench for most of the season until he was forced into a starting role late in the season due to the lack of size the Cougars were dealing with."
