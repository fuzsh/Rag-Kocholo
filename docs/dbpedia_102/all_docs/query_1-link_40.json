That trio includes BIG EAST Freshman of the Year Ryan Nembhard (12.4 ppg., 5.7 apg.) as well as Arthur Kaluma (11.3 ppg., 4.8 rpg.) and Trey Alexander (11.3 ppg., 4.9 rpg.).\n\nCreighton's highest-impact newcomer to date has been South Dakota State transfer Baylor Scheierman (11.9 ppg., 9.7 rpg.), who also owns the team lead with five double-doubles and 24 three-pointers made.\n\nPreseason expectations are at an all-time high for a Creighton team returns 10 lettermen and three starters from last year's squad that finished 23-12 and reached BIG EAST Tournament final as well as the Second Round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nCreighton was picked to win the BIG EAST Conference in a preseason poll of league coaches and earned its best preseason poll ranking ever (No. 9).\n\nThe Bluejays average 78.6 points per game while allowing just 67.2 points per contest. CU shoots 47.6 percent from the floor, 33.3 percent from deep and 69.8 percent at the line while outrebounding foes by 6.2 caroms per contest.\n\nScouting BYU\n\nBYU is 5-5 on the season after suffering back-to-back losses to South Dakota (in Salt Lake City) and to Utah Valley (in Provo). The Cougars are 2-3 on neutral floors, which includes a 1-2 showing at the Battle 4 Atlantis.\n\nRudi Williams (12.4 ppg.) and Gideon George (12.1 ppg.) lead the Cougars in scoring, with Fousseyni Traore (11.8 ppg., 8.3 rpg.) and Spencer Johnson (11.0 ppg.) not far behind.\n\nJohnson, however, has missed the last four games due to a knee injury, and veteran guard Trevin Knell (6.4 ppg. in 2021-22) has yet to play following September surgery on his rotator cuff.\n\nThe Cougars average 74.1 points per game while shooting 42.6 percent from the field, 31.3 percent from downtown and 66.7 percent at the line while outrebounding teams by 4.9 caroms per contest. BYU surrenders 72.1 points per game.\n\nIn back-to-back losses to South Dakota and Utah Valley in the past week, BYU had 25 assists compared to 37 turnovers and allowed the opposition to shoot a combined 23-for-47 from three-point range.\n\nThe Series With BYU\n\nBYU leads the all-time series against Creighton by a 7-4 count, but the teams have split two previous meetings on neutral courts.\n\nLast year's game took place at Sanford Pentagon in Sioux Falls, S.D., and saw Creighton top the No. 24 Cougars, 83-71.\n\nGreg McDermott is 1-2 all-time against BYU and 1-0 against Mark Pope.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) owns a 282-140 record in his 13th season with the Bluejays. He owns a career mark of 562-335 in his 29th season, and is 431-271 in his 22nd Division I campaign.\n\nMcDermott led Creighton to its first BIG EAST regular-season title in 2019-20, taking a Bluejay team that was picked seventh in the league's preseason poll and ending the year ranked seventh nationally. The Cascade, Iowa native then coached Creighton to its first Sweet 16 since 1974 in 2020-21 and to a share of its first regular-season BIG EAST title in 2019-20.\n\nMcDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nHe is assisted by Alan Huss, Ryan Miller and Jalen Courtney-Williams.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n- Creighton would improve to 3-1 this season on neutral floors.\n\n- Creighton would snap a three-game losing streak.\n\n- Creighton would win its 149th game all-time when playing as a ranked team.\n\n- Creighton would start 7-3 or better for the 12th consecutive season.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 10-3 all-time in Las Vegas, and 6-1 under Greg McDermott.\n\nWho is Jack Jones?\n\nAfter graduating from Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia Law School in 1948, John Paul \"Jack\" Jones joined the Memphis law firm of Wrape and Hernly, with offices in Washington, DC. He later went into private practice where he specialized in interstate commerce transportation, and labor law.\n\nIn 1960, Mr. Jones became publisher of the Memphis Daily News, a family-owned business and legal newspaper that has published since 1886. Mr. Jones retired from the practice of law in 1992.\n\nA lifelong resident of Memphis, he was a past president of the Tennessee Press Association, the American Court and Commercial Newspapers, Inc., and also a past member of the Memphis Literacy Council. Mr. Jones was a board member of the Benjamin C. Hooks Library, the Rock n' Soul Museum located in the FedEx Forum, the Tennessee Shakespeare Company and a founder of the Memphis Economic Club.\n\nMr. Jones was a lifelong devotee of his family, Thomas Jefferson and William Shakespeare.\n\nThe basketball/entertainment complex at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville opened in 2005, and bears the name the John Paul Jones Arena. This is a fitting tribute to a man who loved basketball and believes it is a way to help educate young athletes in life through sports.\n\nBizarro World\n\nOne of the reasons why Creighton is playing two games in Las Vegas this week is because Omaha native Terence \"Bud\" Crawford (38-0, 29 KO) returns to the ring on Saturday to defend his WBO welterweight title against David Avanesyan (29-3-1, 17 KO) inside Creighton's normal home court, CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nCrawford, who is 38-0 and frequently referred to as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, has worn Creighton apparel during his ring walk several times in the past and is a frequent attendee to Bluejay Basketball home games (including last Sunday's contest vs. Nebraska).\n\nSaturday will mark Crawford's sixth fight inside CHI Health Center Omaha. He's also fought seven times in the state of Nevada. His most recent fight on Nov. 20, 2021, a 10th round knockout of Shawn Porter, took place inside Michelob ULTRA Arena.\n\nOnce Crawford's fight is done, CHI Health Center Omaha will host the NCAA Volleyball Championships next Thursday (semifinals) and Saturday (final). Creighton opens BIG EAST play next Friday at Marquette.\n\nPut It In Neutral\n\nCreighton generally plays a few neutral-site games each season, but those are typically associated with MTE's, a conference tournament or postseason play.\n\nSaturday's game in Las Vegas against BYU will be just the second neutral-site game not with an MTE since December 12th, 1970.\n\nThe only other game since then was last year's victory over BYU played at Sanford Pentagon in Sioux Falls, S.D.\n\nSin City Spectacular\n\nThis is Creighton's eighth trip ever to Las Vegas, but first since November of 2019 when it played in the 19th Annual Continental Tire Las Vegas Classic.\n\nThe Bluejays are 9-3 all-time in Las Vegas, and 5-1 under Greg McDermott.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's past trips to Sin City:\n\nDate Opponent CU Result\n\n01/04/67 at UNLV W 71-70\n\n01/02/69 at UNLV L 99-109\n\n12/21/87 vs. Alaska W 85-84\n\n12/23/87 at #15 UNLV L 59-90\n\n12/22/08 vs. Fresno State W 84-65\n\n12/23/08 vs. DePaul W 83-75\n\n11/23/12 vs. Wisconsin W 84-74\n\n11/24/12 vs. Arizona State W 87-73\n\n11/23/15 vs. Rutgers W 85-75\n\n11/25/15 vs. Massachusetts W 97-76\n\n11/28/19 vs. San Diego State L 52-83\n\n11/29/19 vs. #12 Texas Tech W 83-76 (OT)\n\nOn The Rebound\n\nBaylor Scheierman gets lots of attention for his shooting and passing skills, but he did lead the Summit League in rebounding last year as well.\n\nScheierman has grabbed 10 or more rebounds in six of his first 10 games this season, and has five double-doubles to date.\n\nThe Aurora, Neb., product's current 9.7 rebounds per game average is the best mark by a Bluejay since Benoit Benjamin averaged 14.1 rebounds per game in 1984-85.\n\nScheierman remains on pace to become the first man in school history to average at least 8.0 rebounds and 2.0 three-pointers per game.\n\nWith 10 or more rebounds vs. BYU on Saturday, Scheierman can become the first Bluejay since Gregory Echenique 10 years ago (Jan. 7-15, 2012) to compile four straight double-digit rebound games.\n\nNo Bluejay has had four straight double-doubles since Doug McDermott from Nov. 25-Dec. 10, 2011.\n\nSince the 1994-95 season, Scheierman, Ryan Hawkins, Martin Krampelj and McDermott (twice) are the only four Bluejays to record three straight double-doubles.\n\nFarabello Fired Up\n\nAfter starting the year making just 5-of-28 shots from three-point range, senior guard Francisco Farabello made 5-of-9 long-range attempts en route to scoring a career-high 16 points last Sunday vs. Nebraska.\n\nFarabello shot 40.2 percent (76-189) from three-point range in three seasons at TCU.\n\nYoung A Utah Native\n\nCreighton freshman Evan Young hails from Alpine, Utah, and finished high school just a few miles down the road from the BYU campus at American Fork High School.\n\nYoung won a state title to close out his senior season in March, helping the Cavemen defeat Corner Canyon in the state title game at Marriott Center.\n\nYoung is the first player who finished high school in the state of Utah to play for Creighton in the last 50 years, though former Bluejays Kyle Korver and Chad Gallagher both have spent time with the NBA's Utah Jazz.\n\nLosing Streaks Rare\n\nCreighton heads to Las Vegas riding its first three-game losing streak since February of 2019. That team lost four consecutive games by 10 points or less, with three away from home, but responded by winning its next five games. This year's club has lost its three straight games all by 10 or less, with all but one away from home.\n\nBefore the current stretch, Creighton had not lost three consecutive games in the month of December since 1995.\n\nOnly One Name Needed\n\nAlums Doug McDermott and Jimmer Fredette each are considered among the all-time greats in their respective program, and among the nation's best players in the last 15 years.\n\nBoth men swept the National Player of the Year awards as seniors, appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and are among the NCAA's all-time scoring leaders (McDermott is sixth, Fredette 41st).\n\nMcDermott and Fredette are among 33 different players since 1985-86 who have scored 900 points or more in a college season, a list that also includes the likes of Stephen Curry (twice), Kemba Walker, J.J. Redick, Allen Iverson, Glenn Robinson, Buddy Hield and Kevin Durant.\n\nHere's a closer look at their basketball stats:\n\nCategory McDermott Fredette\n\nCollege Games 145 139\n\nCollege Points 3,150 2,599\n\nCollege Points/Game 21.7 18.7\n\nCollege Rebounds 1,088 367\n\nCollege Assists 194 515\n\nCollege 3FG Made 274 296\n\nCollege 3FG Percentage .458 .394\n\nNBA Draft 11th (2014) 10th (2011)\n\nNBA Games 547 241\n\nNBA Points 5,051 1,438\n\nNBA Points/Game 9.2 6.0\n\nNBA 3FG Made 762 193\n\nNBA 3FG Percentage .409 .372\n\nA Good Start\n\nHere's a look at how Creighton has done statistically after 10 games in recent seasons, which CU will reach after Saturday's contest.\n\nNotably, this will be the fourth time that CU has five had double-figure scorers after 10 games since 1994-95, but third straight campaign.\n\nOf note, Creighton has started 5-5 or better after 10 games in 28 of the past 29 seasons (including 2022-23).\n\nA win would guarantee a 12th straight season with a 7-3 start or better.\n\nCreighton Stats Through 10 Games, Since 1994-95\n\nYear W-L PPG FG% 3FG 10+ PPG guys\n\n'22-23so far 6-3 78.6 .476 80 5\n\n2021-22 8-2 73.4 .491 62 4\n\n2020-21 8-2 81.3 .482 101 5\n\n2019-20 8-2 78.5 .478 98 3\n\n2018-19 7-3 83.8 .510 117 3\n\n2017-18 8-2 90.2 .516 102 3\n\n2016-17 10-0 91.6 .544 99 4\n\n2015-16 7-3 85.5 .506 93 5\n\n2014-15 8-2 73.8 .438 85 2\n\n2013-14 8-2 83.7 .491 113 2\n\n2012-13 9-1 80.2 .519 90 2\n\n2011-12 9-1 86.0 .516 90 2\n\n2010-11 6-4 69.0 .426 74 3\n\n2009-10 4-6 71.3 .450 78 2\n\n2008-09 8-2 75.6 .439 89 3\n\n2007-08 9-1 80.8 .478 84 2\n\n2006-07 6-4 66.0 .408 59 3\n\n2005-06 7-3 69.3 .405 70 3\n\n2004-05 8-2 69.2 .434 80 2\n\n2003-04 10-0 72.1 .463 61 2\n\n2002-03 10-0 84.9 .526 97 1\n\n2001-02 6-4 75.9 .439 63 3\n\n2000-01 8-2 76.0 .445 83 3\n\n1999-00 9-1 74.7 .458 84 2\n\n1998-99 8-2 78.4 .454 79 2\n\n1997-98 7-3 77.3 .467 73 1\n\n1996-97 5-5 65.7 .409 57 2\n\n1995-96 5-5 66.7 .390 56 3\n\n1994-95 4-6 65.1 .404 66 3\n\nScheierman A Consistent Threat\n\nBaylor Scheierman has scored 107 points in his first nine games as a Bluejay.

Going back to last season when he played for South Dakota State, Scheierman has made two or more three-pointers in each of his past 16 games.\n\nScheierman has drained at least one triple in each of his last 19 contests dating to last season.\n\nConsecutive Games, 2+ 3-Pointers (Active Streaks)\n\nStreak Name, School Next\n\n23 Kamdyn Curfman, Marshall 12/8\n\n16 Baylor Scheierman, Creighton 12/10\n\n13 Tajion Jones, UNC Asheville 12/10\n\n11 Xander Rice, Bucknell 12/18\n\n10 Taylor Funk, Utah State 12/10\n\n10 Adam Flagler, Baylor 12/18\n\nCougar Talk\n\nBYU is 21-6 following a loss under Mark Pope.\n\nBYU is 45-4 under Pope when allowing fewer than 70 points, with three of those losses coming when the opposition scored exactly 69 points.\n\nBy comparison, Creighton is 236-47 under Greg McDermott when scoring 70+ points as opposed to a 46-93 mark when being held under 70.\n\nFantastic Five\n\nMuch has been written about Creighton's starting five this season, and the success CU has had when Ryan Nembhard, Ryan Kalkbrenner, Trey Alexander, Arthur Kaluma and Baylor Scheierman are on the floor together.\n\nThe quintet has played 169:31 (of a possible 360 minutes) together this season, outscoring the opposition 340-277 in those minutes.\n\nIn four games against ranked foes, the group has been paired together for 88:18 (of a possible 160 minutes) and outscored opponents 185-165.\n\nDeep Dive Into The Rankings\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team was ranked ninth in the Associated Press Preseason Top 25 poll, its highest preseason AP ranking ever.\n\nThe Oct. 17th announcement marked just the fifth time in program history the writers have voted CU to the top-25 in the preseason, joining 2006-07 (No. 19), 2012-13 (No. 16) and 2016-17 (No. 22) and 2020-21 (No. 11). All four of those Bluejay teams would end up in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nCreighton was 10th in the AP poll released on Nov. 14th and Nov. 21 and was seventh last Monday. This week the team fell to No. 21.\n\nThe Nov. 28 week is the 21st time in program history that Creighton has been in the top-10 at any point, with all but one of those weeks happening under head coach Greg McDermott. Creighton's best ranking in program history is seventh, done five times (Jan. 16, 2017, March 10, 2020, March 18, 2020, Jan. 7, 2021 and Nov. 28, 2022).\n\nCreighton has now been ranked 118 times in program history, with 90 of those weeks under the direction of McDermott. Creighton is 148-60 all-time as a ranked team, including a 114-46 mark under McDermott. Creighton has been ranked at least one week in nine of McDermott's 13 seasons on The Hilltop after doing it just five different seasons in program history before his 2010 arrival.\n\nCreighton was also ninth in the preseason USA Today Coaches poll, its best preseason mark ever in the Coaches poll. The Jays remained ninth in the Nov. 14 Coaches poll and climbed to eighth in the Nov. 21 Coaches poll and were seventh on Nov. 28. This week CU is 21st. The program's best slotting ever in the Coaches poll is fifth, done on Jan. 4, 2021.\n\nSophomores Standing Tall\n\nLegendary Marquette coach Al McGuire once said that the best thing about freshmen is that they become sophomores. The Bluejay trio of Arthur Kaluma, Trey Alexander and Ryan Nembhard were all part of the BIG EAST All-Freshman Team last season, and all three are off to fantastic starts as sophomores.\n\nThis year the trio have combined to average 35.1 points per contest.\n\nCollectively, they shoot 43.2 percent from the field (112-259), 31.1 percent from downtown (32-103) and 80.0 percent at the line (60-75) while also contributing 105 rebounds and 82 assists against just 46 turnovers.\n\nNationally Relevant\n\nThrough games of Dec. 7, Creighton ranked second in the country in fewest fouls per game (11.22).\n\nThe Jays are also 21st in fewest turnovers per game (10.44) and 19th in assist/turnover ratio (1.53).\n\nIndividually, Ryan Nembhard ranks 17th in assist/turnover ratio (3.85) and 29th in total assists (50).\n\nTeammate Ryan Kalkbrenner is second in field goal percentage (76.3%) among players to make five field goals per game. Kalkbrenner is the only player shooting 70 percent or better who has made three or more three-pointers.\n\nAdditionally, Baylor Scheierman ranks fifth nationally with five double-doubles.\n\nWooden Award Watch List\n\nThe Creighton duo of Baylor Scheierman and Ryan Kalkbrenner have been named to the Preseason Top 50 Watch List for the John R. Wooden Award® presented by Wendy's®.\n\nThe players on the list are considered strong candidates for the 2023 John R. Wooden Award Men's Player of the Year presented by Wendy's. Players not chosen to the preseason list are still eligible for the Wooden Award™ midseason list, late season list, and the National Ballot. The National Ballot consists of 15 top players who have proven to their universities that they meet or exceed the qualifications of the Wooden Award. Nearly 1,000 voters will rank in order 10 of those 15 players when voting opens prior to the NCAA Tournament and will allow voters to take into consideration performance during early round games. The Wooden Award All American Team™ will be announced the week of the \"Elite Eight\" round of the NCAA Tournament. The winner of the 2023 John R. Wooden Award will be presented in Los Angeles in April.\n\nScheierman and Kalkbrenner give Creighton nine Preseason John R. Wooden Award Watch List recognitions in 13 seasons under Greg McDermott. Marcus Zegarowski made the list in 2020-21, one year after Ty-Shon Alexander was listed prior to the 2019-20 campaign. Others to make the list include Marcus Foster (2017-18), Maurice Watson Jr. (2016-17), Doug McDermott (2013-14, 2012-13 and 2011-12). Creighton's lone recipient of the John R. Wooden Award® is Doug McDermott, who was recognized following the completion of the 2013-14 campaign.\n\nTurnover Free At The Point\n\nRyan Nembhard's 12 assists without a turnover vs. Holy Cross on Nov. 14 made him just the fourth player in Bluejay history to accomplish that feat. He's the first to do it inside CHI Health Center Omaha and the first Bluejay to do it at any site since 2002.\n\nHere's the single-game assist leaders at Creighton, along with their turnover statistics on that night:\n\nAst. Name, Opponent Date TO\n\n17 Ralph Bobik vs. Bradley 01/22/74 0\n\nRalph Bobik at St. Francis (Pa.) 02/23/73 ??\n\n16 Ralph Bobik vs. BYU 12/17/73 4\n\n14 Maurice Watson Jr. at Providence 01/07/17 2\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. at Seton Hall 01/09/16 4\n\n13 Maurice Watson Jr. vs. Washington St. 11/18/16 4\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. vs. Akron 12/03/16 5\n\nJason Bey vs. Southern Illinois 02/27/95 1\n\nLatrell Wrightsell vs. Nebraska 12/07/91 1\n\n12 Ryan Nembhard vs. Holy Cross 11/14/22 0\n\nGrant Gibbs vs. Northwestern 12/22/11 4\n\nTyler McKinney at Nebraska 12/21/02 0\n\nEd St. Fleur at CS-Sacramento 01/13/96 0\n\nLatrell Wrightsell vs. N.

He played just 19 minutes in the win, making him the nation's only player with 12 assists against a Division I opponent this year while playing less than 30 minutes.\n\nMcDermott Among The Best\n\nA Nov. 10th article on CBSSports.com ranked the nation's best Top 25 And 1 coaches, with Creighton's Greg McDermott making that list.\n\nMcDermott and Providence's Ed Cooley were the lone BIG EAST coaches named to the list.\n\nKalkbrenner Up For Naismith Award\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner has been named one of 50 players to watch during the season-long competition for the 2023 Jersey Mike's Naismith Trophy Men's Player of the Year honor, as announced by The Atlanta Tipoff Club.\n\nA junior from Florissant, Mo., Kalkbrenner averaged 13.1 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots per game while starting CU's first 34 contests last season. He was an Honorable Mention All-BIG EAST choice, BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year and named to the All-BIG EAST Tournament Team while ranking fourth nationally in both field goal percentage (.646) and offensive rebounds per game (3.9). He was the lone Bluejay named Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST last month for ninth-ranked team in the nation, who are predicted to win the BIG EAST.\n\nKalkbrenner's recognition makes him the fourth different Bluejay in 13-year head coach Greg McDermott's tenure to be on a Naismith Award watch list. Doug McDermott was on the Preseason watch list in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 and was a finalist in 2012-13 before winning the award in 2013-14. Marcus Foster was named to the Midseason watch list in 2016-17, then made the Preseason and Midseason watch list in 2017-18. More recently, Marcus Zegarowski was on the Preseason and Midseason watch list in 2020-21.\n\nThe midseason 30 team will be announced in February, and then the competition will be narrowed down to 10 national semifinalists in early March. Following those results, four finalists will be named on March 21, 2023, and the winner of the 2023 Jersey Mike's Naismith Trophy for Men's Player of the Year will be announced on April 2, 2023.\n\nTop 10 Under McDermott\n\nPrior to Greg McDermott's 2010 arrival, Creighton had spent one week ranked in the top 10 of the Associated Press poll in program history (10th on Jan. 20, 2003, when Dana Altman's team led by Kyle Korver lost at Steve Merfeld's Evansville team).\n\nUnder McDermott, Creighton has spent 21 weeks in the top 10, including at least one week in five different seasons (1 week in 2012-13; 8 weeks in 2016-17, 3 weeks in 2019-20, 5 weeks in 2020-21 and 4 weeks so far this year).\n\nCreighton's best AP ranking ever is seventh, done five times (Jan. 16, 2017; March 10, 2020; March 18, 2020; Jan. 7, 2021 and Nov. 28, 2022).\n\nAn Area for Improvement\n\nOne area that Creighton will look to improve in 2022-23 is its marksmanship from behind the arc, as last year's 30.8 percent shooting from deep was its worst as a team since 1993-94.\n\nThe Creighton staff is confident those numbers can improve as its talented freshman class is now sophomores. Thus far, Creighton is third in the BIG EAST with 8.9 three-pointers made per game but ranks eighth with 33.3 percent marksmanship from deep.\n\nLast year's freshmen combined to shoot 27.2 percent from deep (85-313), but they're not the first Bluejay freshmen to struggle early on from downtown, as seen in the chart below of some other prominent marksmen.\n\nEven that chart is a little misleading, as Doug McDermott shot 15-of-53 (.283) from deep in his first 20 games of his freshman year before finishing 32-of-63 (.508) in his last 19 games. Likewise, Kyle Korver was shooting 11-for-41 (.268) from downtown after his first 14 contests before blistering the nets to the tune of 52-of-104 (.500).\n\nAs a Freshman Other College Years\n\nName 3FG-3FGA 3FG% 3FG-3FGA 3FG%\n\nKy. Korver 63-145 .434 308-674 .457\n\nMcDermott 47-116 .405 237-482 .492\n\nTy. Alexander 32-96 .333 178-469 .380\n\nBallock 44-135 .326 264-638 .414\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 328 regular and postseason contests at CHI Health Center Omaha all-time in the 20-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 269-59 (.820) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Friday (22-0).\n\nCreighton's Nov. 25, 2017 win over SIU Edwardsville was the program's 200th at the facility, coming in its 242nd home game. CU's 100th win came on Nov. 17, 2010, a 63-58 win over Louisiana.\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 25,624-21,489 in games at CHI Health Center Omaha, an average margin of 12.61 points per game. Creighton has not trailed 87 different times, including once this year (Holy Cross).\n\nIncredibly, Creighton hasn't trailed in its home opener in 10 of the past 23 seasons (2000-01, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2016-17 and 2019-20).\n\nCreighton is also 32-35 all-time in the 67 games at the arena in which it's fallen behind by double-figures at any point, 8-11 when down by 10+ points at halftime in the facility, and 40-29 when trailing at halftime at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton is 172-41 (.808) at CHI Health Center Omaha under Greg McDermott and hasn't trailed in 62 of those games. In that same span, CU owns a 95-9 home record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 288-59 (.830) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nWho's Back?\n\nWith Creighton returning eight of the 13 men who appeared in a game last season, it's no surprise that a similar ratio of the production from 2021-22 is also gone. Below is a breakdown of what is back:\n\nStat Returners Departures\n\nBlocks 118 (79.2%) 31 (20.8%)\n\nAssists 284 (60.9%) 182 (39.1%)\n\nStarts 104 (59.4%) 71 (40.6%)\n\nPoints 1,360 (56.2%) 1,062 (43.8%)\n\nMinutes 3,881 (54.9%) 3,194 (45.1%)\n\nCharges Taken 7 (53.8%) 6 (46.2%)\n\nRebounds 663 (53.3%) 580 (46.7%)\n\nSteals 98 (51.0%) 94 (49.0%)\n\n3FG Made 83 (35.3%) 152 (64.7%)\n\nYouth Is Served\n\nIn case you've forgotten, Creighton had at least one freshman on the floor for every second of every game last season, and actually had a late stretch of 1:28 vs. Colorado State when all five of its players on the floor were freshmen.\n\nAll told, 3171:36 of Creighton's 7,075 total minutes (44.83 percent) were played by freshmen last season.\n\nBy comparison, in 2020-21 Creighton had a freshman on the floor just 32.4 percent of the time and had multiple freshmen on the floor just 17 minutes (of 1,250) all season (1.4 percent). Only 7.5 percent (465:52 of 6250) of CU's overall minutes were played by freshmen in 2020-21.\n\nThrough nine games this season, Creighton's freshmen have played 220:51 of 1800 possible minutes (12.27 percent).\n\n2021-22 Minute Breakdown\n\nFreshmen Time Score Margin\n\n0 freshmen: Never -- --\n\n1 freshman: 34:23 59-49 +10\n\n2 freshmen: 962:14 1,692-1,578 +114\n\n3 freshmen: 347:15 611-407 +4\n\n4 freshmen: 45:54 54-85 (-31)\n\n5 freshmen: 1:28 5-2 +3\n\nWatch This\n\nCreighton has four men that made a preseason watch list for their respective position.\n\nRyan Nembhard is one of 20 candidates on the watch list for the 2023 Bob Cousy Award, given to the nation's best point guard. Nembhard is the fourth different Bluejay in the last 12 years named to the Bob Cousy Award watch list, joining Antoine Young (2011-12), Maurice Watson Jr. (2016-17) and Marcus Zegarowski (2020-21).\n\nBaylor Scheierman is one of 20 candidates on the watch list for the 2023 Julius Erving Award, given to the nation's best small forward. Scheierman is Creighton's first player in the nine seasons of the Julius Erving Award to be named to the watch list at any point.\n\nArthur Kaluma is one of 20 candidates on the watch list for the 2023 Karl Malone Award, given to the nation's best power forward. Kaluma is Creighton's first player in the nine seasons of the Karl Malone Award to be named to the watch list at any point.\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner is one of 20 candidates on the watch list for the 2023 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, given to the nation's best center. Kalkbrenner joins Justin Patton (2016-17) as Creighton's second player in the nine seasons of the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award to be named to the watch list at any point.\n\nCreighton (4) is one of six schools with four or more MBB players on a watch list, joining Duke (5), Kentucky (5), Arizona (4), Gonzaga (4) and UCLA (4).\n\nCU's four watch list student-athletes match the totals of the rest of the BIG EAST combined (Xavier 2, Villanova 1, UConn 1).\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team was picked to win the BIG EAST Conference in the annual survey of league coaches, which was unveiled as part of BIG EAST Media Day on Oct. 18th at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIt's the first time since 2012-13 that Creighton has been chosen as a preseason favorite in its league, though that recognition came in CU's final season in the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\nThis is the 10th time Creighton has been tabbed as the preseason favorite (also 1989-90, 1990-91, 1998-99, 2000-01, 2002-03, 2006-07, 2008-09, 2011-12 and 2012-13), though the first nine occurrences all happened in the Missouri Valley Conference. Four of those MVC teams finished first (1990-91, 2000-01, 2008-09, 2012-13), while the other five took second place. Six of those nine Bluejay squads went on to win the MVC Tournament (1990-91, 1998-99, 2002-03, 2006-07, 2011-12, 2012-13) and seven of the nine squads played in the NCAA Tournament (1990-91, 1998-99, 2000-01, 2002-03, 2006-07, 2011-12, 2012-13).\n\nThe Bluejays collected eight first-place votes and earned 98 points in the poll. Xavier was picked second in the poll with 86 points, including two first-place votes. Villanova, the defending BIG EAST Tournament champion, was one point behind Xavier with 85 points and received one first-place vote from the men's basketball head coaches, who did not vote for their own teams. Connecticut was picked fourth with 77 points and Providence was fifth with 62 points. St. John's and Seton Hall finished sixth and seventh with 62 and 52 points, respectively. Butler was eighth with 36 points, four points ahead of ninth-place Marquette with 32 points. Georgetown was 10th with 21 points and DePaul 11th with 12 points.\n\nCreighton is the only school in the league that has met or exceeded its preseason BIG EAST prognostication every year since joining the league, as seen below:\n\nCreighton's BIG EAST Preseason Poll History\n\nYear Preseason Actual Preseason All-BIG EAST\n\n2013-14 3rd 2nd Doug McDermott (1st)\n\n2014-15 9th T-9th -\n\n2015-16 9th 6th -\n\n2016-17 3rd T-3rd Maurice Watson Jr. (1st); Marcus Foster (HM)\n\n2017-18 5th T-3rd Marcus Foster (1st); Khyri Thomas (HM)\n\n2018-19 9th T-3rd Martin Krampelj (HM)\n\n2019-20 7th T-1st Ty-Shon Alexander (1st)\n\n2020-21 2nd 2nd Marcus Zegarowski (1st); Mitch Ballock (2nd)\n\n2021-22 8th 4th -\n\n2022-23 1st ??

McDermott is in his ninth season in the NBA.\n\nOther famous Bluejays to play in the NBA in the past include Paul Silas, Kyle Korver, Benoit Benjamin and Anthony Tolliver.\n\nWe're Jamming!\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns 122 dunks in his career, including 69 last year. He has more career dunks than any other Bluejay player since Greg McDermott's arrival in 2010.\n\nAs a team, Creighton owned 132 dunks last season, including nine vs. Georgetown on Feb. 12th and eight vs. No. 18 UConn on March 2nd.\n\nHere's a look at the Creighton student-athletes with 20 or more dunks in a season, and 25 or more dunks in a career, under Greg McDermott:\n\nMost Creighton Dunks, Season, Since 2010-11\n\nDunks Name Year\n\n74 Martin Krampelj 2018-19\n\n72 Justin Patton 2016-17\n\n69 Ryan Kalkbrenner 2021-22\n\n50 Christian Bishop 2020-21\n\n38 Christian Bishop 2019-20\n\n36 Gregory Echenique 2012-13\n\n33 Martin Krampelj 2017-18\n\n30 Gregory Echenique 2011-12\n\n29 Marcus Foster 2017-18\n\n29 Ryan Kalkbrenner 2020-21\n\n24 Gregory Echenique 2010-11\n\n24 Ryan Kalkbrenner 2022-23\n\n23 Marcus Foster 2016-17\n\n22 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2010-11\n\n21 Alex O'Connell 2021-22\n\n21 Arthur Kaluma 2021-22\n\n20 Khyri Thomas 2017-18\n\nMost Creighton Dunks, Career, Since 2010-11\n\nDunks Name Years\n\n122 Ryan Kalkbrenner 2020-Pres.\n\n121 Martin Krampelj 2015-19\n\n103 Christian Bishop 2018-21\n\n90 Gregory Echenique 2010-13\n\n72 Justin Patton 2016-17\n\n52 Marcus Foster 2016-18\n\n51 Khyri Thomas 2015-18\n\n38 Will Artino 2011-15\n\n33 Zach Hanson 2013-17\n\n28 Arthur Kaluma 2021-Pres.\n\n25 Geoffrey Groselle 2012-16\n\n25 Damien Jefferson 2018-21\n\nMost Creighton Dunks, Team, Season, Since 2010-11\n\nDunks Year Team W-L\n\n144 2016-17 25-10 (NCAA)\n\n132 2021-22 23-12 (NCAA)\n\n107 2017-18 21-12 (NCAA)\n\n106 2018-19 20-15 (NIT)\n\n90 2020-21 22-9 (NCAA)\n\n60 2019-20 24-7 (Postseason Canceled)\n\n58 2015-16 20-15 (NIT)\n\n56 2010-11 23-16 (CBI)\n\n54 2012-13 28-8 (NCAA)\n\n42 2011-12 29-6 (NCAA)\n\nAmong The Nation's Best\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranks nationally since the start of the 2010-11 season, per Basketball-Reference.com.\n\n2010-11 to Dec. 7, 2022\n\nCategory CU Stat CU Rank\n\n3FG Made 3,704 4th\n\nFG Percentage .477 5th\n\n3FG Percentage .376 6th\n\nAssists 6,724 6th\n\nFG Made 11,505 8th\n\nPoints 32,159 10th\n\nWins 282 28th\n\nWinning Percentage .668 33rd\n\n20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton had 23 wins in 2021-22, securing a seventh straight 20-win season.\n\nCreighton is one of six schools with 20 or more wins in each of the previous seven seasons, joining Belmont, Gonzaga, Houston, Kansas and Oregon.\n\n22 of 24 Seasons With 20 Wins\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 22 of the last 24 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust two schools have had 20 or more wins each of the last 24 years: Gonzaga and Kansas.

Last year's double-figure group included Ryan Hawkins (13.8 ppg.), Ryan Kalkbrenner (13.1), Alex O'Connell (11.8), Ryan Nembhard (11.3) and Arthur Kaluma (10.4).\n\nCreighton had not had five or more men finish a season averaging 10 or more points per game since the 1964-65 club had SIX men average in double- figures (Neil Johnson, 17.3; Elton McGriff, 15.0; Fritz Pointer, 14.3; Tim Powers, 12.6; Bob Miles, 11.9; Charlie Brown (11.6), though Johnson only played in 8-of-23 games.\n\nThis year's team has five players averaging 11.3 points per game or more, Ryan Kalkbrenner (15.9), Trey Alexander (11.3), Ryan Nembhard (12.4), Arthur Kaluma (11.3), Baylor Scheierman (11.9).\n\nCreighton has won each of its last 26 games when five or more players score in double-figures, a streak that dates to Jan. 9, 2019 vs. Marquette.\n\nWho Are These Guys?\n\nAfter returning just two total starts in from its Sweet 16 squad team to open 2021-22, Creighton returns a 104 starts from last year's club.\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games each of the previous seven times (and 11 of the last 12 times) it has returned 100 or more starts.\n\nReturning Returning Starts Final\n\nYear Starters From Previous Year W-L\n\n2022-23 3 104 ? ? ?\n\n2021-22 0 2 23-12\n\n2020-21 5 124 22-9\n\n2019-20 4 136 24-7\n\n2018-19 2 57 20-15\n\n2017-18 2 72 21-12\n\n2016-17 4 130 25-10\n\n2015-16 1 64 20-15\n\n2014-15 1 49 14-19\n\n2013-14 4 144 27-8\n\n2012-13 4 140 28-8\n\n2011-12 3 101 29-6\n\n2010-11 4 123 23-16\n\n2009-10 3 106 18-16\n\n2008-09 3 83 27-8\n\n2007-08 1 44 22-11\n\n2006-07 4 120 22-11\n\n2005-06 4 134 20-10\n\n2004-05 2 58 23-11\n\n2003-04 3 101 20-9\n\n2002-03 5 159 29-5\n\n2001-02 2 65 23-9\n\n2000-01 3 90 24-8\n\n1999-00 3 84 23-10\n\n1998-99 3 84 22-9\n\n1997-98 4 72 18-10\n\n1996-97 4 126 15-15\n\n1995-96 4 100 14-15\n\n1994-95 2 52 7-19\n\n1993-94 3 73 7-22\n\n1992-93 2 64 8-18\n\n1991-92 2 51 9-19\n\n1990-91 4 132 24-8\n\n1989-90 4 127 21-12\n\n1988-89 4 123 20-11\n\n1987-88 3 83 16-16\n\n1986-87 2 65 9-19\n\n1985-86 1 48 12-16\n\n1984-85 4 124 20-12\n\n1983-84 3 72 17-14\n\n1982-83 3 77 8-19\n\n1981-82 2 78 7-20\n\n1980-81 4 112 21-9\n\nDynamic Duo\n\nCreighton was one of 11 schools to earn at-large bids in the NCAA Tournament in both men's and women's basketball in 2021-22, a list that featured Arkansas, Baylor, Creighton, Indiana, Iowa State, LSU, Miami (Fla.), Michigan, North Carolina, Notre Dame and Ohio State.\n\nThose 11 schools, in addition to 13 others (Arizona, Delaware, Gonzaga, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Longwood, Montana State, Tennessee, Texas, UConn, Villanova and Virginia Tech) were the only 24 schools with both men's and women's basketball teams to make the Big Dance.\n\nThis season, Creighton is one of nine teams with a preseason top-25 squad on both the men's and women's side, joining Arizona, Baylor, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 27 victories since the start of the 2010-11 season after trailing by double-figures at some point, including four such rallies last season. In its NCAA Tournament win vs. San Diego State, Creighton trailed 35-21 late in the first half.\n\nThirteen of those 27 comebacks have come away from home.\n\nIf you're curious, CU's largest comeback win since 2000 came on Jan. 28, 2006, when the Jays trailed 25-6 early before rallying to beat Wichita State on a buzzer-beater by Anthony Tolliver.\n\nCU's Double-Digit Comebacks Under McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n16 at Seton Hall 01/27/21\n\n16 SIU Edwardsville 11/27/21\n\n15 Arkansas-Pine Bluff 11/09/21\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n14 vs. San Diego State 03/17/22\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n13 #22 Xavier 12/23/20\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n12 East Tennessee State 11/11/18\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n11 vs. Ole Miss 11/21/16\n\n11 vs. Connecticut 03/12/21\n\n11 DePaul 01/22/22\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\n10 St. John's 01/03/18\n\n10 at DePaul 02/07/18\n\n10 Bemidji State 02/13/18\n\nMcDermott's Coaching Tree\n\nA bunch of former Greg McDermott protégés are thriving at the Division I level.\n\nEric Henderson led South Dakota State to the first 18-0 season in Summit League history. The Jackrabbits went 30-5 after winning the Summit League Tournament and clinching an NCAAA bid.\n\nNorth Dakota State's Dave Richman went 23-10 overall and finished as the runner-up in the Summit League standings and Summit League Tournament to Henderson's SDSU team.\n\nBen Jacobson won the MVC regular-season title while coaching Northern Iowa. The Panthers went 20-12 and reached the NIT.\n\nDrake's Darian DeVries led the Bulldogs to a 25-11 mark and runner-up finish in the MVC (to Jacobson's UNI team) in the regular-season and the league tournament. Drake played in the CBI.\n\nSteve Lutz led his Texas A&M-Corpus Christi team to a 24-12 record and a Southland Conference Tournament title in his first year as a head coach, with the Islanders reaching the NCAA Tournament First Four. He inherited a 5-19 team that hadn't won 20 games or had a winning record since 2016-17.\n\nTJ Otzelberger turned around Iowa State in his first year in Ames. He inherited a 2-22 team (0-18 Big 12) and turned it into a team that reached the Sweet 16 and finished 22-13.\n\nPatrick Sellers led Central Connecticut State to an 8-24 record in his first season with the Blue Devils, including a victory in the Northeast Conference Tournament.\n\nPaul Sather is the head coach at North Dakota after successful tenures at Black Hills State and Northern State.\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nCreighton is 8-8 in games with a game-winning go-ahead score in the final 10 seconds at CHI Health Center Omaha, which opened in the fall of 2003.\n\nCreighton's Go-Ahead Scores in Wins at\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n11/26/05 Dayton W 91-90* Funk FG :5.7\n\n01/28/06 Wichita St. W 57-55 Tolliver FG :0.0\n\n11/25/06 George Mason W 58-56 Watts FT :7.5\n\n03/18/08 Rhode Island W 74-73 Witter 3FG :3.2\n\n01/13/10 Southern Illinois W 71-69 Young FG :1.3\n\n02/18/12 Long Beach St. W 81-79 Young FG :0.3\n\n01/28/14 St. John's W 63-60 McDermott 3FG :2.8\n\n01/18/20 Providence W 78-74 Zegarowski 3FG :3.2\n\n*double-overtime\n\nOpponent Go-Ahead Scores in CU Losses at\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.)

The streak is the nation's 13th-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last game without a three-pointer came at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993, when the Jays were 0-for-5. Creighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (through 12/7)\n\nRk.

That put him in the company of some of the greatest coaches in CU Athletics history.\n\nMcDermott is one of five head coaches in Creighton history to lead seven different NCAA Tournament teams.\n\nName Sport NCAA's @CU\n\nKirsten Bernthal Booth Volleyball 12\n\nBob Warming Men's Soccer 11\n\nDana Altman Men's Basketball 7\n\nBrent Vigness Softball 7\n\nGreg McDermott Men's Basketball 7\n\nTicket Information\n\nSingle-game tickets for the 2022-32 season went on sale on October 14th.
