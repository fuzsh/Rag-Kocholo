        "text": "Candlelight Coin Drive Week\n\nIt is Candlelight School Coin Drive Week! This will be Alpine Elementary’s 11th year helping provide meals for children at our sister school in Nairobi, Kenya. More than 650 students attend Candlelight School, and nearly all of them are orphans or children living on the streets. They receive their only meal of the day at school. Our Coin Drive donations directly fund their lunch program for the year. See the attachments to learn more about the Candlelight School.\n\nMonday—Pennies\n\nTuesday—Nickels\n\nWednesday—Dimes\n\nThursday—Quarters\n\nFriday—Any amount of money\n\nHere are the total amounts that our annual Coin Drive has raised for the Candlelight School in previous years.

Thank you to librarian, Paula Ruesch, and Assistant Librarian, Janece Thompson, for suggesting a Veterans Day ceremony that included members of Mrs. Thompson’s bagpipe band! What a powerful and touching way to remember Veterans both present and past. It was an honor to have one of our parents, Paul Blackham, a military helicopter pilot, join our parade. And Student Council officers, Daniel Snow and Max Bergquist, did a great job of carrying our country’s flag! As I walked behind the flag, the bagpipe band, and Mr. Blackham, I saw several adults with tears in their eyes, touched by the bagpipe tribute to Veterans. Not going to lie, I cried through the entire parade!\n\nPTA News\n\nSpirit Night this Friday to Support Candlelight School – This Friday, Nov. 16, (all day!) stop into Yummy Ice Cream Emporium in Highland as another way to support the Candlelight School. 25% of proceeds will go directly to the Candlelight School Coin Drive.

Friday night, Laura and I watched LPHS beat Skyridge in a 6A semifinal football game at Rice-Eccles Stadium on the University of Utah campus. Several Lone Peak players are former Alpine Elementary students. So fun to see those boys earn their way into a state championship game on Friday afternoon against Corner Canyon!\n\nA bike ride, yard work and going to two grandsons’ basketball games filled my Saturday. I hope you all were able to get outside and enjoy the beauties of this wonderful place that we call home!\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nAlpine Elementary\n\nVeterans Day, November 11\n\nWe are grateful to veterans, both current and past, for their service to our country. My father is a Korean War veteran and father-in-law a World War 2 veteran. And though they both have passed on, it is a privilege each year to honor them and all veterans.\n\n“The U.S. Military is us. There is no truer representation of a country than the people that is sends into the field to fight for it.

It was the opportune time to rake leaves. I don’t know about you, but I experience a great feeling of accomplishment when I spend several hours raking leaves and seeing the lush green grass as the aftermath. However, autumn leaves continue to fall from trees, so there is more work to do next weekend. A metaphor for life? The events in our lives never remain neat and orderly. There is always more work to do!\n\nI enjoyed a beautiful bike ride up to South Fork on Saturday morning. A magnificent fall day with several wild turkeys, feeding in nearby fields, checking me out as I pedaled away!\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nAlpine Elementary\n\nAnother Halloween Gone\n\nCan you believe we have turned the calendar to November? We enjoyed bringing back our long-standing tradition of a Halloween Parade on Friday, October 29. It was fun to see the students in their different costumes. I learned that a lot of our students don’t know who Colonel Sanders is, but I appreciate Martha Hadlock and Sheri Davis, our office secretaries, being good sports and joining the Colonel in some very hot chicken costumes.\n\nPTA\n\nPTA Meeting this Thursday – Anyone who is interested can come to our monthly PTA meeting happening this Thursday, Nov. 4, at 9:30 am in the faculty room.

Please do not get out of your vehicle unless you are parked in a designated parking area. Safety of students during these drop off and pick up times is our number one priority. We occasionally have a Lone Peak police officer at the school when students arrive or are dismissed, but on most days we rely on the common courtesy that adults need to display when dropping off or picking up their students. Please be considerate of others during these transition times!\n\nStudents of the Week\n\nThe following students were recognized as Students of the Week on Friday, October 29. Teachers nominate students who are consistently demonstrating the character traits of the Alpine Big 3: Being Respectful, Responsible and Ready to learn.

Saturday was the best! I enjoyed a morning bike ride up Suncrest where the view of the valley and Utah Lake are breathtaking. We had a late afternoon family gathering at our daughter’s house in Saratoga Springs followed by an army of grandchildren going trick-or-treating in a neighborhood that has so many young children it looked like Disneyland. And then to culminate the day, a trip to LaVell Edwards Stadium to watch an exciting high scoring football game, with the Cougs prevailing 66 – 49 over their former coach Bronco Mendenhall and his University of Virginia team. The game reminded me of the type of high scoring shootouts I observed when I was a student at BYU 1979 – 1982. I didn’t get home from the game until 1:00 am, but there was nothing but memories of a day well-lived as I drifted off to sleep.\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nAlpine Elementary\n\nFall Break\n\nI hope the entire Alpine Elementary Community had an enjoyable Fall Break. It is snowing as I write this, so fall weather in the Utah Valley can be very unpredictable. My wife and I went to Texas to watch a football game in 80-degree weather, and judging from the number of people wearing blue in McLane Stadium, home of the Baylor Bears, there had to be someone besides me at the game with ties to Alpine Elementary.\n\nRed Ribbon Week\n\nOur students and staff will be participating in our annual Red Ribbon Week, October 19 – 22. We are grateful to one of our parents, Andrew Young, and the fantastic videos he produces that our students will watch each day this week. The focus of the week is for students to learn how to say no to drugs and alcohol. Ask your students what they learned at school each day this week. The most powerful conversations about making safe and correct choices about drugs and alcohol happen at home.\n\nPTA News\n\nJunior Achievement Helpers – The PTA is looking for volunteers to help organize the Junior Achievement program at Alpine.

Our Fall Festival is taking place Monday, October 25th from 4:00-7:00. There will be food, games, a cake walk and much more!! It is going to be a great event for students and their families.

Place the cartridges in a plastic bag before bringing them to the school, and our school receives money through this recycle program.\n\nOld Lost and Found Items\n\nWe have several bags of Lost and Found items that were not claimed during the 2020 – 2021 school year. If you want to come and look through these assorted items, contact our Head Custodian, Mike Carter, 801-785-5040. Any Lost and Found items from last year not reclaimed by November 1 will be donated to a charitable organization.\n\nOutside the Principal’s Office\n\nThe primary purpose of our Fall Break trip to Texas, to watch a football game between BYU and Baylor, was less than satisfying, as the Cougars lost for the second consecutive week. Unlike the Boise State game, where turnovers could be used as the reason for the loss, Baylor was simply the better team, dominating both lines of scrimmage. The Baylor fans were very kind and gracious, welcoming BYU fans to the Big XII in two years. Aside from the football game dominance, other parts of our trip were more enjoyable.\n\nHaving never traveled to Dallas and Waco, Laura and I learned more about one of the darkest days in our country’s history. We visited the John F. Kennedy Museum in the Book Depository Building, the location from where the 35th President of the United States was assassinated on November 22, 1963. As a kindergartner in Pendleton, Oregon, I remember being sent home early from school on that fateful day.\n\nAnd of course, while in Waco, we had to eat at Magnolia Table and visit The Silos of Chip and Joanna Gaines fame. The breakfast at Magnolia Table was delicious, as were the cupcakes and cookies Laura purchased at the Magnolia Bakery after standing in line for 20 minutes. My sweet wife knows me well enough to not ask me to shop with her, so while she checked out the different stores at The Silos, I spent time with a friend, my iPhone. We also visited the Branch Davidian Memorial Site outside of Waco and toured the Dr. Pepper Museum, the birthplace of that particular soft drink. Waco is not what I would call a beautiful city. I told my wife that the residents in the city and surrounding areas should be happy that Chip and Joanna have made efforts to beautify the city.\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nAlpine Elementary\n\nParent/Teacher Conferences\n\nThank you to all of the parents who came to Parent/Teacher Conferences! It was nice to see parents back in the school conversing with teachers after the unusual year we had last year. And we are grateful to all of the parents who purchased books at our Book Fair and to the local heroes who came to participate in the Hero Read with our students!\n\nFall Break and Minimal Day\n\nFall Break will be October 14 – 18. October 13 will be a Minimal Day with students being dismissed at 12:45 pm. We hope all families in the Alpine Elementary Community have an enjoyable Fall Break!\n\nPTA News\n\nReflections – Reflection entries are due this week on October 13!

School menus are posted on the Alpine School District website.\n\nPrinter Cartridge Recycle Program\n\nJust a reminder that we have a box in our Staff Room where you can deposit your used computer ink cartridges. Place the cartridges in a plastic bag before bringing them to the school, and our school receives money through this recycle program.\n\nOutside the Principal’s Office\n\nI was once again in LaVell Edwards Stadium and watched BYU lose their first football game of the season on Saturday afternoon against Boise State in a mistake-filled game. The sour taste of the football game was washed away on Sunday as we were able to have a family gathering with four of our five children and their families. Our son and his wife from South Dakota were visiting Utah, so we were only missing our daughter and her family in Oregon, though they did join our family get together via FaceTime. The ongoing happiness and progress of family is certainly of much more meaning and long-lasting significance than a football game. Having said that, I will continue to root for my alma mater! Laura and I will be in attendance next week in Waco, Texas at the BYU/Baylor football game. Go Cougs!\n\nHave a wonderful week and an enjoyable Fall Break, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nAlpine Elementary\n\nAlpine Elementary PTA Fundraiser & Fun Run\n\nFun Run PTA Fundraiser\n\nThis week, we are excited to host this year’s Fun Run PTA Fundraiser!

Running Club will continue Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays during morning recess, and kids will earn prizes as they log those miles!\n\nSchool Picture Day – Sept. 28\n\nWe are still looking for a few volunteers to assist with School Picture Day taking place on Sept. 28th. If any parents could come between 9:15 – 11:30 am, please sign up here.\n\nReflections\n\nLast week, an email went out about the Reflections Art Program. Reflections is an incredible nation-wide program put on by the PTA that encourages children to be creative and involved in the arts. There is no fee to participate and there are several art categories. See last week’s email for more details, but this year’s theme is “I Will Change the World by…” and the submission deadline is October 13th.\n\nInk Cartridge and Toner Recycling Program\n\nFor the second consecutive year we will have an ink cartridge and toner recycling program. Bring your computer ink and toner cartridges to the box in our Staff Room and our school receives money in this recycling program.\n\nSchool Community Council\n\nOur first School Community Council meeting will be 9:30 – 10:30 am on Thursday, September 16 in our Conference Room. Any parent is welcome to attend.\n\nStudents of the Week\n\nThe following students were recognized as Students of the Week on Friday, September 10. Teachers nominate students who are consistently demonstrating the character traits of the Alpine Big 3: Being Respectful, Responsible and Ready to learn.

I saw those words repeatedly this past weekend as our country reflected on what happened 20 years ago on 9/11/2001. While we should all certainly remember the tragic loss of life, I think we should also remember how one of the darkest days in our nation’s history unified us. We were all Americans grieving and resolved to defend our country at all costs. There was no focus on red or blue states or political bickering. Fast forward 20 years and we have lost much of that unity and are in many ways a very divided country. I yearn for the sense of unity, not for catastrophic national events, that we experienced two decades ago.\n\nAs we attended the BYU/Utah football game Saturday night, Laura and I were seated next to some Utah fans, and as we watched the pregame festivities (the two F-15’s flying low over the stadium was an unforgettable goosebump moment) commemorating 9/11, all 64,000 fans in attendance, whether wearing blue or red, were once again unified in somber remembrance of those who perished, with an in-state football game seeming rather insignificant to the events of that day 20 years ago.\n\nOur sixth graders were not yet born or just infants the last time BYU beat the University of Utah in a football game, November 27, 2009. The Perdues bleed Cougar Blue, but none of our 14 grandchildren have any memories of a BYU victory in the rivalry game. The twelve-year, nine game losing streak ended on Saturday night, and even though the almost 64,000 fans in attendance got soaked in a brief torrential downpour, it was a wonderful night for the Cougar faithful. With the announcement on Friday that BYU will become a member of the Big XII Conference, it was a very good weekend to be a BYU fan. Having said that, I saw nothing but class and congratulatory words from the Utah fans I interacted with at the game.\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nAcadience Testing\n\nWe will have our Beginning of the Year Acadience test for K – 3 students on Thursday, September 9. Acadience is the foundational reading assessment given to our students three times during the school year. The assessment results inform the literacy instruction that teachers deliver in the classroom. Additionally, our first graders will also be administered a Math Acadience Assessment on Thursday.\n\nChange in Picture Day\n\nBecause of a scheduling conflict with Eastman Adams Photography, our Picture Day is now scheduled for September 28. Picture flyers explaining the different purchasing packages will be coming to parents before September 28.\n\nP.L.A.Y. (Play, Learn, Accept, YouKnight) Day\n\nThe Lone Peak football players and cheerleaders who came to Alpine Elementary last week for P.L.A.Y. Day were treated like rock stars by our students. It was a fun day and we appreciate the LPHS students, many former Alpine Elementary students, who came to talk, play and interact with our students.\n\nInk Cartridge and Toner Recycling Program\n\nFor the second consecutive year we will have an ink cartridge and toner recycling program. Bring your computer ink and toner cartridges to the box in our Staff Room and our school receives money in this recycling program.\n\nSchool Community Council\n\nWe have four new parents who will be serving on our School Community Council for the 2021 – 2022 school year. Our one returning SCC parent will be JoLynn Greenwood. Here is our 2021 – 22 School Community Council:\n\nYing Garrison—Parent\n\nJoLynn Greenwood–Parent\n\nSarah Johnson—Parent\n\nJaron Mathis—Parent\n\nMelissa McCoy—Parent\n\nConnie Faux—Teacher\n\nMcKayla Hill—Teacher\n\nDave Perdue—Principal\n\nTeacher Aides Still Needed\n\nWe continue to have Teacher Aide positions that need to be filled. The jobs range from three to five hours in length and pay $11.28 an hour. If you or someone you know is interested in working as an aide at Alpine Elementary, please contact our Instructional Coach, Jenna Berry, [email protected].\n\nPTA News\n\nWe had a successful Walk to School Wednesday last week and will continue the practice every other week, so our next Walk to School Wednesday will be September 15. We are grateful to all of the Room Parents who met with teachers last week. The PTA will have their first meeting of the school year, Thursday, September 9, 9:30 – 10:30 am in the Staff Room. All parents are welcome to attend.\n\nOutside the Principal’s Office\n\nJudging from the number of BYU fans in Las Vegas on Saturday, there had to be members of the Alpine Elementary Community in attendance at Saturday night’s football game between BYU and the University of Arizona. Las Vegas is not one of my favorite destinations to visit, but Laura and I headed south and enjoyed the BYU football victory on Saturday night. Allegiant Stadium, home of the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders, which was built for a mere $2 billion, was a very nice venue in which to watch an athletic contest. The AC in the enclosed stadium was a welcome relief when temperatures were hovering around 90 degrees outside in the Nevada desert.\n\nI know of at least one Alpine Elementary parent in attendance at the game. Nick Greer who along with his wife Debra have had five of their seven children attend Alpine Elementary was definitely at the game as he had the honor of running the BYU flag onto the field before the game started. Mr. Greer is a humble man and will undoubtedly be embarrassed by this recognition in the Eagle News. Nick is the CEO of Built Bar and recently announced that all 36 walk-on players on the BYU football team would have their college tuition paid by Built Bar.\n\nBecause of Nick’s magnanimous donation to the University and being a loyal BYU supporter, the BYU football team gave Nick the honor of carrying the BYU flag out onto the field prior to the game Saturday night. Nick ran the flag out proudly with not one misstep as he had a highly energized team and the cumulative weight of many football players with sharp field cleats running behind him. A fall could have been disastrous. Way to represent the Alpine Elementary Community, Nick! See the attached video.\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal\n\nPicture Day\n\nSchool Picture Day will be September 28. Flyers explaining the different picture purchasing packages will be coming home soon.\n\nP.L.A.Y. (Play, Learn, Accept, YouKnight) Day\n\nLone Peak High School football players will be at Alpine Elementary during our morning recess on September 2 to mingle and play with all of our students. The focus of the LPHS athletes is to reach out to all of our students, not just our elementary football players or athletes.\n\nOutside Lunch\n\nWhen the weather is nice, as it was last week and is supposed to be this week, we have our students eat lunch outside, instead of in the cafeteria. Students sit by grade level on the grass and eat their school and home lunches before going to the playground to begin their lunch recess. We have three adults supervising the students while they are eating their lunch. We started the outside lunch last year as a part of the COVID protocols that we had in place, but have continued the practice this year because the feedback from the students and supervisors on the outdoor lunch has been overwhelmingly positive. Please do not pull into our back parking lot to visit with your students while they are eating lunch. It is difficult for our lunch supervisors to determine who is a parent and who is not a parent, and we want to follow safety protocols regarding the adults that students are in contact with during the school day.\n\nTeacher Aides Needed\n\nI have already sent out a couple of messages to the Alpine Elementary Community explaining that we are in need of Teacher Aides at our school. We currently have four unfilled TA positions, even after posting jobs on the Alpine School District website. The jobs range from three to five hours in length and pay $11.28 an hour.\n\nIf you or someone you know is interested in working as an aide at Alpine Elementary, please contact our Instructional Coach, Jenna Berry, [email protected].\n\nPTA News\n\nWalk-to-School Wednesdays (PTA-sponsored)\n\nParent volunteer, Chelsea Hertig, is starting up Walk-to-School Wednesdays beginning this Wednesday, September 1st. Students can walk to school from whatever location makes the most sense for your family, and earn rewards for participation! This year, we’ll do Walk-to-School Wednesdays every other Wednesday. We need 4 volunteers to help this Wednesday morning from 8:50 – 9:30 am. Sign up to be a helper this Wednesday morning here!\n\nPicture Day\n\nPicture Day will be happening on September 28, and we are looking for just a few volunteers to help that day! Please sign up here to help out!\n\nRunning Club (PTA-sponsored)\n\nRunning Club will be starting up soon! The PTA has moved Running Club to morning recess time to allow all students the option to participate. The Club will run Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at that time. Stay tuned for more details!\n\nOnline Absence Requests\n\nParents can excuse their students from school by using the Online Absence Request for Parents. I have attached instructions on how to use this online form.\n\nOutside the Principal’s Office\n\nDid you or any of your family or friends hike Timp on Saturday? I biked the Alpine Loop on Saturday morning, and I have never seen so many cars parked alongside the road in the various pull outs, trying to park as close as possible to the Timpooneke Trailhead. Undoubtedly, the dropping temperatures and hint of fall in the air, not to mention the return of college students to BYU and UVU, is bringing many hikers to the mountain trails.\n\nAfter my bike ride, Laura and I watched some of our grandchildren play soccer in Saratoga Springs and Riverton. Watching four-year old girls play soccer is actually quite entertaining. Not the soccer, as it is just a jumble of little girls in a beehive formation trying to kick the ball, usually missing contact, while giggling, checking to see if their parents are watching them, and very concerned about hair and uniform tidiness.\n\nHave a wonderful week, and as always, remember that it is a great day to be an Eagle!\n\nDave Perdue, Principal"
