The Cougars, led by head coach Bronco Mendenhall, played their home games at LaVell Edwards Stadium. This was the third year BYU competed as an independent. They finished the season 8–5. They were invited to the Fight Hunger Bowl where they lost to Washington, 31–16.\n\nBefore the season\n\n[edit]\n\nCoaching changes\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 2012 Poinsettia Bowl, longtime assistant coach Lance Reynolds announced his retirement after 33 years of service at BYU (29 years as a coach and 4 years as a player).[1] To fill the vacancy, BYU looked to an old face. Longtime assistant Robert Anae was brought back from the University of Arizona as the new offensive coordinator.[2] In addition to his position as the offensive coordinator, Anae was given the responsibility of helping Bronco evaluate the entire offensive staff.\n\nOn January 8, Mark Weber left BYU for Utah State after six years with the Cougars. Weber was hired by the Aggies as the new assistant head coach and as the offensive line coach.[3]\n\nOn Monday, January 14, Coach Mendenhall informed running backs coach and recruiting coordinator Joe DuPaix and tight ends coach Ben Cahoon that their contracts would not be renewed for the 2013 season.[4] It was also revealed that Brandon Doman's status with the university was uncertain for 2013. BYU announced they had interviewed Max Hall, Paul Peterson (Sacramento State offensive coordinator), and Steve Clark (Southern Utah offensive coordinator) for the position of quarterback coach for the 2013 season.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 15, BYU announced that two coaches had been hired as part of the new offensive staff for the 2013 season. Garett Tujague was hired and Mark Atuaia was moved from the athletic director's office as the assistant to the AD over to the football coaching staff. BYU's official press release said that positions wouldn't be announced until the staff was finalized, but common rumors stated that Tujague would become the offensive lines coach and Atuaia would become the running backs coach.[5]\n\nOn Wednesday, January 16, BYU announced that Aaron Roderick had been hired as an assistant coach on the offensive side at BYU. Roderick was to join the Cougars after 8 years of service at Utah, and it was believed that he would serve as the receivers coach.[6] Less than 24 hours after accepting the position at BYU, Roderick changed his mind and decided to return to the Utes for the 2013 season.[7]\n\nThe final coaching staff members were announced on Friday, February 15. Jason Beck was hired as the quarterback coach and Guy Holliday was hired as the wide receiver coach.[8]\n\nOn February 28, Bronco Mendenhall announced that Nick Howell had been promoted to the defensive coordinator position, Robert Anae was assistant head coach, and Kelly Popinga would serve as special teams coordinator.[9]\n\n2013 recruits\n\n[edit]\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for 2013 recruits Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight Commit date Chasen Andersen\n\nLB Logan, UT Logan 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) 218 lb (99 kg) Jan 19, 2013 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN grade: 67 Josh Carter\n\nOL Tucson, AZ Eastern Arizona College 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) 290 lb (130 kg) Feb 6, 2013 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN grade: NR Michael Davis\n\nWR Glendale, CA Glendale 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) 180 lb (82 kg) Jul 28, 2012 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN grade: NR Tim Duran\n\nOL Puyallup, WA Cabrillo College 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) 290 lb (130 kg) Feb 6, 2013 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: N/A Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN grade: NR Nathan DeBeikes\n\nLB Thousand Oaks, CA Thousand Oaks 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) 196 lb (89 kg) May 31, 2012 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN grade: 69 Garrett England\n\nDB Salt Lake City, UT Skyline 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) 190 lb (86 kg) Jul 1, 2012 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN grade: 70 Edward Fusi\n\nOL Corona, CA Mt.

Instead of doing a traditional 20-minute scrimmage with 5 minutes per quarter, the Cougars held a 50-play scrimmage that became more of a 75-play scrimmage. More than 12,000 fans turned out to see the first team offense and second team defense (titled BYU West) take on the second team offense and first team defense (BYU East). Several expected starters, including QB Taysom Hill, who had not been cleared for full contact, were held out of the scrimmage. The offense scored four touchdowns and added one field goal in a 15–13 victory by the West team.\n\nPre-season honors\n\n[edit]\n\nName Number Pos.

New BYUtv Sports reporter Spencer Linton conducted webchats with some of BYU's returning starters, new starters, and head coaches. Trevor Matich returned from ESPN to act as a special analyst alongside BYUtv analysts Blaine Fowler, Jan Jorgensen, and Brian Logan. A TV special titled LaVell Edwards and the BYU Quarterback Factory was also held.

Bad news occurred for Cougar fans before game time as it was revealed Cody Hoffman had an ankle sprain and would be unable to play. The first quarter saw BYU's total yardage as nearly quadruple that of Virginia's, but neither team was able to score. As the two teams got ready to start the second quarter, lightning struck within 15 miles of the stadium. Both teams were sent to their locker rooms, and a two-hour lightning delay began.\n\nThe lightning also caused havoc with the TV arrangements. ESPNU had another game to start broadcasting at 7 PM, but BYU at Virginia would only be in the second quarter. As a result, ESPN decided to move the entire nation, except for those in the states of Virginia and Utah, to the Washington State/ Auburn ESPNU game while the markets of Utah and Virginia would remain with the BYU/ Virginia game. The game would be made available on ESPN3 for the rest of the nation. However viewers on DirecTV and Dish Network had no choice but to move to the next game as they couldn't put in territorial restrictions. Dish Network was able to air the remainder of the game on Channel 147, an ESPN alternate station, but DirecTV fans were to go unhappy, unless they had internet access to ESPN3.\n\nThe Cougars were able to strike first in the second quarter, and it provided hope for the Cougars as the Cougars had only lost three times in the Bronco Mendenhall era when BYU scored first. However a 53-yard field goal and a blocked punt gave Virginia the momentum, and they never looked back.\n\nWeather continued to cause problems for BYU and Virginia as the third quarter began. A heavy rain storm began, and while the degrees of heaviness would rotate throughout the remainder of the game, the rain would cause both teams to shift to a ground and pound attack strategy. Virginia would score 12 unanswered points, culminating in a great toe drag by Darius Jennings to give the Cavaliers the lead.\n\nDespite the toe drag, it would be the Virginia defense that would save the day for the Cavaliers. On a 3rd and 7 Hill threw the ball to sophomore running back Jamaal Williams, but the slickness of the ball and the continual rain caused it to slip from his hands. The ball would land in the hands of Virginia safety Anthony Harris. After a quick lateral Williams was able to bring the Cavs down at BYU's 13 yard line, but one play later Virginia would score the game's final touchdown. The Cougars would complete a 50-yard pass on the last play of the game, but it was too little, too late.\n\nJamaal Williams led the Cougars with 33 carries for 144 yards. Taysom Hill carried the ball 11 times for 42 yards and a touchdown. He would also throw the ball 13 times for 175 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBYU owned every statistical category with 187 yards rushing compared to Virginia's 109. They would also out pass Virginia 175 to 114. However Virginia's wise ball control (34:09 to BYU's 25:51) allowed them to control the clock for 3 out of 4 quarters, and in the end it was the ball control, special teams blunders, a safety, and an interception that gave the Cavaliers a narrow 19 to 16 win.\n\nDespite the loss, BYU did manage to compile one award for the week.\n\nScott Arellano\n\nFBS Independent Special Teams Player of the Week\n\n[15]\n\nTexas\n\n[edit]\n\nBYUtv Panel: Alema Harrington, Brian Logan, and David Nixon\n\nTexas at BYU\n\n1 234Total Longhorns 7 770 21 • Cougars 10 17130 40\n\nDate: September 7\n\nLocation: LaVell Edwards Stadium\n\nProvo, UT\n\nGame start: 6:52 PM MST\n\nElapsed time: 3:27\n\nGame attendance: 63,197\n\nGame weather: 63 °F (17 °C), Cloudy w/ Scattered Showers, winds variable, Game start delayed 1 hour, 46 minutes by lightning\n\nReferee: Randy Christal\n\nTV announcers (ESPN2/LHN/Sports USA/BYUtv): Joe Tessitore, Matt Millen, and Maria Taylor (ESPN2)\n\nCraig Way, Roger Wallace, Rod Babers, and Kaylee Hartung (LHN)\n\nJohn Ahlers, Gary Barnett, and Scott Garrard (Sports USA)\n\nDave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Kathy Aiken, and Spencer Linton (BYUtv)\n\nSources:[16]\n\nAt first many fans thought the game would be a repeat of last week as a severe thunderstorm hit Provo at 4 PM. Kickoff was immediately postponed from 5:06 PM as a 55-minute warmup was still required for both teams. Some of the players were able to go to the fans and interact with them before heading back to the locker room during the delay, giving the fans additional motivation. Nearly an hour after the storm hit, a start time of 6:52 was announced, resulting in a 1-hour, 46 minute lightning delay. The rain would continue on and off throughout the rest of the game, but no one expected the performance BYU put up.\n\nSophomore Quarterback Taysom Hill found lane after lane and was able to dominate the Texas line, setting a BYU record with 15.2 yards per rush, but he wasn't alone. For the second consecutive game Jamaal Williams would go over the century mark, and Paul Lasike would also add 86 rushing yards. It was part of a record performance for BYU- 550 rushing yards, which also became the most rushing yardage Texas has ever given up. For individual totals Hill had 259 yards rushing, the second highest rushing total for a BYU QB, and Williams had 182 yards rushing. Hill's passing yardage was less than impressive (9–26 with 129 yards and 1 interception), but with the running lanes throughout BYU was able to dominate and shock the #15 ranked Longhorns.\n\nAfter the game, BYU swept the FBS Independent Player of the Week Awards and won a lot of other national attention awards.\n\nTaysom Hill\n\nAthlon Sports National Player of the Week\n\nCBSSports.com Offensive Player of the Week\n\nDavey O'Brien Quarterback of the Week Honorable Mention\n\nFBS Offensive Independent Player of the Week\n\nCollege Sports Madness Independent Offensive Player of the Week\n\nJustin Sorensen\n\nFBS Independent Special Teams Player of the Week\n\nCollege Football Performance Awards Honorable Mention Placekicker of the Week\n\nLou Groza Collegiate Place-Kicker Award Star of the Week\n\nJamaal Williams\n\nCollege Football Performance Awards Honorable Mention Running Back of the Week\n\nAlani Fua\n\nFBS Independent Defensive Player of the Week\n\nCollege Football Performance Awards Honorable Mention Linebacker of the Week\n\nTostitos Fiesta Bowl National Team of the Week\n\n[17]\n\nUtah\n\n[edit]\n\nThe week of the game, BYU linebacker Spencer Hadley was suspended 5 games for an honor code violation.[18]\n\nUtah at BYU\n\n1 234Total • Utes 3 1007 20 Cougars 0 067 13\n\nDate: September 21\n\nLocation: LaVell Edwards Stadium\n\nProvo, UT\n\nGame start: 8:21 PM MST\n\nElapsed time: 3:26\n\nGame attendance: 63,470\n\nGame weather: 73 °F (23 °C), Cloudy, winds S at 12mph\n\nReferee: Jack Folliard\n\nTV announcers (ESPN2/BYUtv): Mark Jones, Brock Huard, and Lewis Johnson (ESPN2)\n\nDave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Kathy Aiken, and Spencer Linton (BYUtv)\n\nSources:[19]\n\n[20]\n\nMiddle Tennessee\n\n[edit]\n\nMiddle Tennessee at BYU\n\n1 234Total Blue Raiders 10 000 10 • Cougars 7 16140 37\n\nDate: September 27\n\nLocation: LaVell Edwards Stadium\n\nProvo, UT\n\nGame start: 7:02 PM MST\n\nElapsed time: 3:13\n\nGame attendance: 58,763\n\nGame weather: 48 °F (9 °C), Partly Cloudy, winds S at 5mph\n\nReferee: Joe Pester\n\nTV announcers (ESPNU/BYUtv): Eamon McAnaney and Anthony Becht (ESPNU)\n\nDave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Kathy Aiken, and Spencer Linton (BYUtv)\n\nSources:[21]\n\nComing into the game, it was bad news for BYU from the start.\n\nJammal Williams was out with a concussion\n\nCody Hoffman was suspended for 1 game for violating team rules\n\nMichael Yeck was back starting at RG after an injury to Brock Stringhman during the week.\n\nScoring summary\n\nQuarter Time Drive Team Scoring information Score Plays Yards TOP Middle Tennessee BYU 1 12:14 7 15 2:46 Middle Tennessee 42-yard field goal by Cody Clark 3 0 1 10:47 3 10 1:14 BYU Taysom Hill 12-yard touchdown run, Justin Sorensen kick good 3 7 1 0:36 7 24 2:28 Middle Tennessee Marcus Henry 16-yard touchdown reception from Logan Kilgore, Cody Clark kick good 10 7 2 12:36 BYU Kyle Van Noy 2-yard safety 10 9 2 7:31 3 58 0:37 BYU Taysom Hill 50-yard touchdown run, Justin Sorensen kick good 10 16 2 0:15 7 67 1:27 BYU Michael Alisa 2-yard touchdown run, Justin Sorensen kick good 10 23 3 11:21 12 60 3:33 BYU Michael Alisa 1-yard touchdown run, Justin Sorensen kick good 10 30 3 0:28 BYU JD Falslev 71-yard punt return for a touchdown, Justin Sorensen kick good 10 37 \"TOP\" = time of possession.

The news was only a small spark for the Cougars as they headed into the game. Running back's Jamaal Williams and Algernon Brown would run for their first TD's of the season, and Taysom Hill showed his passing performance against the Aggies wasn't a fluke, hitting Cody Hoffman for a 45-yard touchdown on their first possession of the game. Hill would later add a rushing touchdown of his own. The Cougars got out to an early 24–10 lead on the Yellow Jackets, and that lead would not let up. Hadley would play the entire second half, getting some 3rd down conversion sacks and tackles that prevented the Yellow Jackets from rallying. In the end BYU's defense would hold their 12th straight opponent under 21-points, and the Cougars would pick up their 3rd consecutive win. Hill completed 19/27 for 244 yards and a touchdown. Williams carried the ball 17 times for 89 yards while Hill added 15 carried for 87 yards. Hoffman led the Cougars receiving with 99-yards, and Falslev joined him with 69-yards.

The two sets of Cougars combined for 701 yards of offense and 72 points in the first half (456 for BYU, 245 for Houston). With his first reception of the game, Cody Hoffman became the all-time leading receiver in BYU history, surpassing TE Dennis Pitta. With his touchdown reception, Hoffman tied Austin Collie for the most touchdown receptions made by a receiver at BYU. Taysom Hill became the first person to rush for more than 100 yards against Houston this season. BYU ran a record 115 plays, tying the all-time number of plays run in a FBS game by one-team and shattering their previous record of 95-plays in a game. BYU also made 41-first downs in the game, a new mark for most first downs in a game, and the 76-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Spencer became the most yardage the Cougars have given up in a pass this season.[25]\n\n[26]\n\nBoise State\n\n[edit]\n\nBoise State at BYU\n\n1 234Total Broncos 0 3107 20 • Cougars 7 17103 37\n\nDate: October 25\n\nLocation: LaVell Edwards Stadium\n\nProvo, UT\n\nGame start: 6:06 PM MST\n\nElapsed time: 3:25\n\nGame attendance: 62,954\n\nGame weather: 63 °F (17 °C), Clear w/ a sunset, Winds S 5mph\n\nReferee: Reggie Smith\n\nTV announcers (ESPN/BYUtv): Carter Blackburn, Danny Kanell, and Allison Williams (ESPN)\n\nDave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Kathy Aiken, and Spencer Linton (BYUtv)\n\nSources:[27]\n\n[28]\n\nWisconsin\n\n[edit]\n\nBYU at Wisconsin\n\n1 234Total Cougars 3 077 17 • Badgers 7 1037 27\n\nDate: November 9\n\nLocation: Camp Randall Stadium\n\nMadison, WI\n\nGame start: 1:30 PM MST\n\nElapsed time: 3:10\n\nGame attendance: 80,191\n\nGame weather: 51 °F (11 °C), Overcast, Wind: W 14mph\n\nReferee: Dave Witvoet\n\nTV announcers (ESPN): Bob Wischusen, Rod Gilmore & Quint Kessenich\n\nSources:\n\nIdaho State\n\n[edit]\n\nIdaho State at BYU\n\n1 234Total Bengals 3 073 13 • Cougars 14 35100 59\n\nDate: November 16\n\nLocation: LaVell Edwards Stadium\n\nProvo, UT\n\nGame start: 1:05 PM MST\n\nElapsed time: 3:20\n\nGame attendance: 58,645\n\nGame weather: 36 °F (2 °C), Cloudy w/ Mixed Rain & Snow, Wind: S 2mph\n\nReferee: Rick Loumiet\n\nTV announcers (BYUtv): Dave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Kathy Aiken, and Spencer Linton\n\nSources:[30]\n\nNotre Dame\n\n[edit]\n\nBYU at Notre Dame\n\n1 234Total Cougars 7 060 13 • Fighting Irish 14 333 23\n\nDate: November 23\n\nLocation: Notre Dame Stadium\n\nNotre Dame, IN\n\nGame start: 3:42 PM EST\n\nElapsed time: 3:11\n\nGame attendance: 80,795\n\nGame weather: 26 °F (−3 °C), Snow Flurries, Wind: NW 20mph\n\nReferee: Gary Patterson\n\nTV announcers (NBC): Dan Hicks, Mike Mayock, and Alex Flanagan\n\nSources:\n\n[31]\n\nNevada\n\n[edit]\n\nBYU at Nevada\n\n1 234Total • Cougars 0 01414 28 Wolf Pack 7 079 23\n\nDate: November 30\n\nLocation: Mackay Stadium\n\nReno, NV\n\nGame start: 12:11 PM PST\n\nElapsed time: 3:14\n\nGame attendance: 21,540\n\nGame weather: 48 °F (9 °C), Sunny, winds calm\n\nReferee: Scott Novak\n\nTV announcers (CBSSN): Andrew Catalon, Randy Cross & Lauren Gardner\n\nSources:\n\nFight Hunger Bowl\n\n[edit]\n\nBYU vs. Washington\n\n1 234Total Cougars 0 1600 16 • Huskies 7 1473 31\n\nDate: December 27\n\nLocation: AT&T Stadium\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nGame start: 6:36 PM PST\n\nElapsed time: 3:22\n\nGame attendance: 34,136\n\nGame weather: 56 °F (13 °C), Mostly cloudy, winds SW 4mph\n\nReferee: Clay Martin, (CUSA)\n\nTV announcers (ESPN/ESPN Radio): Dave Pasch, Brian Griese, Tom Luginbill (ESPN)\n\nDave Flemming, Mike Bellotti, Shelley Smith (ESPN Radio)\n\nSources:[32]"
