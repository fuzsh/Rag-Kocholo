        "text": "TUCSON, Ariz. - The Drake softball team (4-1) travels west to the Hillenbrand Invitational hosted by the University of Arizona this weekend. The Bulldogs play five games starting Friday night at 7 p.m. CT against Arizona followed by a matchup with Purdue at 9 p.m. CT. Saturday they will play Utah State at noon CT and Nebraska at 2 p.m. CT before wrapping up the tournament against Southern Utah on Sunday morning at 10 a.m. CT.\n\nA LOOK BACK\n\nDrake started the 2013 season with four wins in five games at the UNI-Dome Classic last weekend. The Bulldogs beat North Dakota State, Illinois, Green Bay and Northern Iowa with their only loss to No. 1 ranked and defending national champions Alabama, 8-2.\n\nIN THE CIRCLE\n\nThe Bulldogs had strong pitching during the opening weekend with junior pitcher Jordan Gronewold (Carlisle, Iowa) winning three games and finishing with a 1.88 earned run average. Sophomore Rebekah Schmidt (Cottage Grove, Minn.), who led the nation in saves last year with 10, picked up two saves along with a victory in the tournament.\n\nAT THE PLATE\n\nSophomore Laura Brewer (Waukee, Iowa) hit a blistering .556 with a double and five runs batted in while junior Amy Pierce (Olathe, Kan.) hit .318 with a double, five runs scored and three stolen bases in Cedar Falls. Sophomore Hayley Nybo (Minnetonka, Minn.) finished the tournament with two doubles, two runs scored, two stolen bases and two runs batted in. Nybo drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh inning in the victory over Illinois.\n\nABOUT THIS WEEK'S OPPONENTS\n\nNo. 16 Arizona (3-2)\n\nThe Wildcats started the season with victories over Northwestern, Cal Poly and San Diego State and losses to Bradley and Florida. Lauren Young leads the Wildcats with a .400 batting average while Briget Del Ponte is hitting .375 with two home runs and seven runs batted in. On the mound, Shelby Blaylock holds a 2-2 record with a 3.44 earned run average. The Wildcats are coached by Mike Candrea, who is in his 28th year as head coach and has 1,314 wins.\n\nPurdue (2-3)\n\nThe Boilermakers defeated Hampton and Tulsa with losses to LSU, North Carolina and Tulsa at the LSU Tiger Classic last weekend. Ashley Burkhardt leads the team at .400 with six hits, two runs scored and three runs batted in. Lexy Moore is 1-1 with a 0.48 earned run average in the circle for the Boilermakers. Purdue is coached by Kim Maher, who is in her seventh season as head coach and has a 189-153-3 overall record.\n\nUtah State (0-5)\n\nThe Aggies lost to Tennessee, Colorado State, Loyola Marymount, Southern Utah and South Dakota at the Red Desert Classic.

Click here.\n\nSouthern Utah (1-4)\n\nThe Thunderbirds defeated Utah State and lost to Tennessee, Utah Valley, Arkansas and Seattle at the Red Desert Classic this past weekend. Kelsey Bryant is batting a team-leading .556 with one home run and four runs batted in while Mikkel Griffin is batting .333 with one home run and one run batted in. On the mound, Danielle Axe is 1-1 with a team-leading 3.00 earned run average. The Thunderbirds are coached by Kyle Magnusson, who is in his third year and has a 55-63 overall record.\n\nPREVIEWING THE BULLDOGS\n\nDrake will have a balanced team of experience and youth in 2013 under head coach Rich Calvert, who helped guide the Bulldogs to the MVC semifinals last year. Calvert is in his 11th season at the helm of the program and holds a 279-263 overall record.\n\nThe 2013 roster includes eight seniors and juniors along with eight sophomores and freshman. Calvert welcomes back 12 letterwinners including All-MVC first teamers, juniors Jordan Gronewold (Carlisle, Iowa) and Amy Pierce (Olathe, Kan.), and an All-MVC second team selection in sophomore, Hayley Nybo (Minnetonka, Minn.).\n\nGronewold and sophomore Rebekah Schmidt (Cottage Grove, Minn.) give Drake a formidable pitching rotation this season. Gronewold and Schmidt each finished in the top-10 of multiple conference statistics in 2012. Gronewold, a Carlisle native, appeared in a school-record 50 games with a school-record 48 starts and won 20 games (third most in school history), finishing with a 2.75 ERA and 200 strikeouts. Schmidt settled into the number two spot and appeared in 43 games, which is tied for fourth most in program history. The Minnesota native won nine games and had a 2.88 ERA with 154 strikeouts. She finished with an MVC-best 10 saves, which ranked second in the country. Freshman Mariah Mckinnon (Oxford, Iowa), who helped Clear Creek Amana High School win two state titles, joins the rotation.\n\nNybo had an outstanding first season with the Bulldogs as she settled into the third base position. The Minnesota native led the team in batting average (.333), home runs (9), runs batted in (42), hits (57) and doubles (13). Her 42 runs batted in were the second highest individual total in school history behind only Dani Tyler, who had 50 in 1994. Nybo, along with shortstop Pierce, gives Drake a solid left side of the infield in 2013. Pierce hit .280 with 12 doubles and 25 runs batted, along with a conference-best 25 stolen bases last year.\n\nJunior Liz Buck (Olathe, Kan.) started 49 games at first base last season and recorded 296 putouts with just seven errors. Sophomore Laura Brewer (Waukee, Iowa) will share time at first base this spring with Buck. Torrey Craddock, one of the best second basemen in Drake history, graduated so the Bulldogs will look to senior Lindsey Vande Wall (Prairie City, Iowa) this year. Vande Wall started 45 games in 2012 in the outfield and stole 19 bases before a late-season injury sidelined her for the last part of the campaign. Freshman Chelsea Blaylock (Des Moines, Iowa) will add backup depth at second, third and shortstop.\n\nZeah Peterson (Baxter, Iowa) started 14 games behind the dish in 2012; and along with junior college transfer Cortney Wood (Alburnett, Iowa), will split time at the catcher position in 2013.\n\nSeniors Macie Silliman (Winterset, Iowa) and Sam West (Kearney, Mo.) along with junior Nicole Randel (Alpine, Calif.) lead a talented outfield group for the Bulldogs. Silliman swiped 22 stolen bases one season ago and West had 21 stolen bases in 2011. Randel hit .273 with a conference-leading seven pinch hits last year and will split time between the outfield and the designated player position. Sophomore Sarah Ryan (Mount Vernon, Iowa) and freshman Seyerra Dubois (Carlisle, Iowa) will also play in the outfield while McKinnon will see time at the corner outfield spots as well.\n\n2013 SCHEDULE\n\nThe Bulldogs face a challenging non-conference schedule with a game against Alabama (Feb. 9), the reigning national champion, at the UNI tournament and two games at Oklahoma (Mar. 8 & 9), which finished as runner-up to Alabama in 2012. Drake will also face these 2012 NCAA tournament teams: Arizona, Florida (twice), Mississippi Valley, North Dakota State, UT-Martin, and Missouri Valley Conference rival, Illinois State.\n\nDrake starts the conference slate with a visit to Southern Illinois on March 16-17 before hosting its home opener against Evansville on March 23. The Bulldogs have 15 home games at Ron Buel Field including annual matchups against in-state foes, Iowa State (Mar. 26) and Iowa (April 3). Northern Iowa will visit Des Moines, May 4-5, to close the regular season. The 2013 MVC tournament will be played in Omaha, Neb. May 9-11.\n\nBULLDOGS PICKED FIFTH\n\nThe Drake softball team was picked to finish fifth in the Missouri Valley Conference preseason's coaches poll. The Bulldogs garnered 62 points in a vote by the league's head softball coaches.\n\nBULLDOGS ADD FOUR TO 2013 CLASS\n\nThe Drake softball team added four student-athletes to its roster for the 2013-14 season this past November. The Bulldogs signed Ashlie Chambers (Ankeny, Iowa), Kaitlyn Finneran (Morrison, Ill.), Maddie Hooyman (Trenton, Mo.) and Megan Sowa (Gurnee, Ill.) to National Letters of Intent.\n\n\"Outstanding characteristics, great passion and outstanding work in the classroom would describe the four who make up our 2013 recruiting class,\" Drake head coach Rich Calvert said. \"Time will tell the impact they will have on the softball field, but they all come from programs, whether high school or club, that have achieved great success during their time.\"\n\nChambers plays for Ankeny High School and helped lead the Hawkettes to the 2012 Iowa Class 5A state softball championship. She has primarily played shortstop for Ankeny but has the versatility to play multiple positions for the Bulldogs. Chambers was named to the 2012 Iowa Class 5A all-tournament team and is a two-time Iowa Girls Coaches Association second team all-state selection. Ankeny was the Iowa Class 4A softball runner-ups in 2011.\n\nFinneran, a shortstop from Morrison High School (Ill.), is a three-time all-conference selection and helped the Fillies win the 2011 Illinois Class 2A state championship. Finneran earned second team all-state honors in 2011 and first team Sauk Valley and Quad Cities all-area awards in 2012.\n\nHooyman, a multi-sport standout at Trenton High School (Mo.) is a four-time all-district and all-regional selection in softball in addition to winning multiple Missouri Class 3 state relay championships in track and field. A four-year starter, Hooyman led Trenton to an 84-15 overall record and three district championships in her career.\n\nSowa, an outfielder for Warren Township High School (Ill.), was selected second team Class 4A all-state by the Illinois Coaches Association this past year. The Blue Devils finished 31-5-1 overall and were the North Suburban Conference champions. The 31 wins were the most in school history."
