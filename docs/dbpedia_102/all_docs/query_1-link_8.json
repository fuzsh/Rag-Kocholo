        "text": "BYU Cougars\n\n2012-13: 24-12 (10-6)\n\nIn-conference offense: 1.10 points per possession (3rd)\n\nIn-conference defense: 1.00 points per possession (3rd)\n\nJunior guard Tyler Haws will be the anchor of this year's BYU team. In his first season back from his Latter-day Saints mission, he averaged 21.7 points and made more than 50 percent of his 2s. Haws also attempted more than 30 percent of his team's shots when he was on the floor and posted a true shooting percentage of 58. As a staple of that scoring repertoire, he'll likely be the WCC's best player at getting to the line, and he made a whopping 88 percent of his 211 free throws last season.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nWhile the news that four-star point guard Nick Emery elected to embark on his two-year LDS mission tempers expectations surrounding this freshman class, four-star center Eric Mika will be expected to make a significant immediate impact on the inside. The 6-foot-9 big man, one of the most coveted centers in his class, already possesses the rebounding and finishing chops to compete with bigs throughout the nation. Mika is the headliner, but coach Dave Rose also hauled in three-star power forward Luke Worthington, who rounds out a highly anticipated class of 2013.\n\nAlong with Haws and the freshmen, junior guard Matt Carlino will provide offensive punch. He was one of only three double-digit scorers for the Cougars last season and will be one of the WCC's leading distributors, as he assisted on 30 percent of his teammates' shots.\n\nOne of the most intriguing facets of this season's team will be the reintegration of 6-foot-6 guard Kyle Collinsworth, who returns from his LDS mission to play for the first time since 2010-11. The versatile Collinsworth averaged 5.8 points, 5.1 rebounds and 2.1 assists as a freshman and should contribute in a meaningful way again, not unlike Haws did last year.\n\nWith the influx of new talent and returning leaders, the Cougars will almost assuredly return to the NCAA tournament for the seventh time in eight years."
