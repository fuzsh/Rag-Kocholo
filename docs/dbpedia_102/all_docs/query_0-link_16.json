        "text": "June 3, 2013\n\nNOTRE DAME, Ind. — University of Notre Dame guards Eric Atkins (Columbia, Md.) and Jerian Grant (Bowie, Md.), who will comprise one of the nation’s top backcourt tandems in 2013-14, are among 29 collegians named to the 2013 USA Basketball Men’s World University Games Team training camp, announced today by USA Basketball. The duo will attend the training camp June 24-30 at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. The USA Basketball Men’s Junior National Team Committee issued the invitations and is chaired by Syracuse University head coach Jim Boeheim.\n\nThe 2013 World University Games (WUGs) are scheduled to be played July 6-17 in Kazan, Russia. Davidson College’s Bob McKillop will lead the USA, with assistant coaches John Beilein of the University of Michigan and the University of South Carolina’s Frank Martin. Additionally, Tad Boyle of the University of Colorado, Jim Kessler of Grace College (NAIA) and Matt Matheny from Elon University were tabbed as court coaches for training camp.\n\nFinalists for the team are expected to be announced on June 27 or 28 and the 12-member roster will be released prior to the team’s departure for Russia on July 1.\n\nJoining Atkins and Grant at the training camp will be: Markel Brown (Oklahoma State); Deonte Burton (Nevada); Quinn Cook (Duke); Bryce Cotton (Providence); Spencer Dinwiddie (Colorado); CJ Fair (Syracuse/Baltimore, Md.); Yogi Ferrell (Indiana); Davante Gardner (Marquette); Treveon Graham (Virginia Commonwealth); PJ Hairston (North Carolina); AJ Hammons (Purdue); Luke Hancock (Louisville.); Joe Harris (Virginia); Tyler Haws (BYU); Andre Hollins (Minnesota); Rodney Hood (Duke); Josh Huestis (Stanford); Cory Jefferson (Baylor); Sean Kilpatrick (Cincinnati); Alex Kirk (New Mexico); Devyn Marble (Iowa); Doug McDermott (Creighton); Adreian Payne (Michigan State); Chasson Randle (Stanford); Will Sheehey (Indiana); Aaron White (Iowa); and Kendall Williams (New Mexico).\n\nThe last Irish player to represent Notre Dame on a USA Basketball roster was former standout Tim Abromaitis in 2011.
