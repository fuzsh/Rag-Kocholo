So we felt going into that second half if we get some guys to really attack them, it might change the pace of the game. Frank did a great job, played a great game, (and) a terrific second half.”\n\nHighlights and Interviews here.\n\nBartley, who finished with 14 points and five rebounds, led a key 11-2 run to give BYU a 74-63 lead. Tyler Haws finished with a game-high 21 points, while Kyle Collinsworth contributed seven points, eight assists and a season-high 13 rebounds.\n\n“Frank came in and he played great and so we kept the small lineup,\" Collinsworth said. \"We just fueled off Frank because he played an awesome game.”\n\nMatt Carlino added 18 points, four rebounds and two steals of his own and Eric Mika finished with 15 points and nine rebounds. Skyler Halford added eight points off the bench in 13 minutes of play.\n\nThe Cougars (6-2) outscored the Aggies (5-1) in the paint 54-38 and capitalized on Aggie turnovers, scoring 19 points off turnovers to the Aggies' six. BYU also led in fast break points outscoring USU 20-0 and kept USU to a 35.3 shooting percentage in the second half.\n\nBYU led early with a Haws steal and a two-hand dunk to go up 14-10 at the 16:24 mark. The Aggies tied it up at 16-16, but answered back with a 3-pointer from Haws with 13:20 left in the half. A Collinsworth steal led to an easy layup by Haws, which was followed by a three-point play by Mika at the 10:42 mark to lead 24-19.\n\nHalford drove to the basket to extend the lead 27-22, followed by Bartley’s free throws to grab a seven-point lead. USU responded and took its first lead, 40-37, with 3:38 remaining. Carlino’s layup cut the deficit to one, but BYU ended the half down 44-39.\n\nHaws led the team with 11 points, while Mika added nine points and five rebounds of his own. Collinsworth ended the half with four points, five rebounds and three assists.\n\nCollinsworth started the second half with a block at the 18:51 mark, followed by a pair of free throws from Carlino and an alley-oop from Carlino to Mika for the dunk to cut BYU’s deficit to 44-43. With 17:34 remaining in the game, Mika made another layup to take a one-point lead. Consecutive layups in transition from Carlino and Halford put BYU up 58-55 with 11:07 left in the game and the Cougars didn't trail again.\n\nBartley recorded a block at the 9:28 mark and followed with a 3-pointer to extend the BYU lead to five at 66-61 with 8:21 left in the game. He then followed it up by drawing a charge, which led to a backdoor pass from Collinsworth to Carlino for a nine-point lead. With 4:49 remaining, Bartley capped an 11-2 BYU run with a drive down the lane for a slam dunk to extend the lead to 74-63 and BYU never looked back.\n\n“These guys are fighters, and that second half, it came down to what I feel are two really good basketball teams just trying to figure out how to get a win,\" Rose said. \"We made a couple more plays. I think Stew’s going to have a terrific year. He’s got a great team with good leadership and great experience. I like his bench and I really like his roster.”\n\nThe Cougars will return to the Marriott Center to play North Texas on Tuesday at 7 p.m. MST. The game will be televised live on BYUtv and broadcast on the Cougar IMG Sports Network on KSL Newsradio 102.7 FM/1160 AM.\n\nGame Notes: BYU vs. Utah State\n\nBYU and Utah State will meet for the 230th time on Saturday and the Cougars hold a 137-92 advantage in the series. The Cougars and Aggies will be playing at a neutral site for only the second time in the history of the series, which began in 1906. The first neutral meeting was on Dec. 6, 2008, when BYU defated Utah State 68-63 at EnergySolutions Arena. Saturday's game will be televised live on BYUtv and broadcast live on the Cougar IMG Sports Network on KSL Newsradio 102.7 FM and 1160 AM.\n\nBYU Cougars (5-2, 0-0 WCC)\n\nHead Coach: Dave Rose\n\nAlma Mater: Houston, 1983\n\nCareer Record: 214-68 (9th)\n\nRecord at BYU: Same\n\nUtah State (5-0, 0-0 MWC)\n\nHead Coach: Stew Morrill\n\nAlma Mater: Gonzaga, 1974\n\nDivision I Career Record: 589-267 (28th)\n\nRecord at Utah State: 371-129 (16th)\n\nSeries Information\n\nSeries Record: BYU leads 137-92\n\nLast Meeting: BYU won 70-68, 2/19/13\n\nH/A/N: 84-32/52-60/1-0\n\nGame Information\n\nTV: BYUtv\n\nTV Talent: Dave McCann (play-by-play), Blaine Fowler (analyst), Lauren Francom (sideline)\n\nLive Video: BYUtvsports.com\n\nRadio: Cougar IMG Sports Network, KSL 102.7 FM / 1160 AM, BYU Radio - Sirius XM 143\n\nRadio Talent: Mark Durrant (play-by-play), Russell Larson (analyst)\n\nLive Audio/Stats: BYUcougars.com\n\nProjected starters\n\nUtah State (5-0, 0-0 MWC) No. Name Ht.

His 114 steals are 14th all-time and the 64 he totaled in 2012-13 as a sophomore are the fourth most in team history. 2 The number of players in BYU history to reach 1,000 career points as a sophomore. Danny Ainge was the first to do so and had 1,130 points in 57 games by the end of his sophomore season (1978-79). Sophomore Tyler Haws joined Ainge when he reached the 1,000 career point mark at Saint Mary’s on Feb. 21, 2013. 4 With three NIT wins last postseason, BYU has won a postseason game for four-straight years, a program record. The Cougars defeated Florida 99-92 in double overtime in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in 2010 and in 2011 BYU advanced to the Sweet 16 with wins over Wofford and Gonzaga. In 2011-12, the Cougars overcame a 25-point deficit to defeat Iona in the First Four in Dayton. It marked the largest deficit overcome in the history of the NCAA Tournament. 4.7 Matt Carlino’s career assist average, first all-time in BYU history. As a freshman in 2011-12, he averaged 4.6 assists and in 2012-13, he averaged 4.8. His 171 assists last season are the third most in team history. Carlino is averaging 5.0 assists per game this season and had a season-high 8 assists in BYU’s 108-76 win against Mount St. Mary’s. 7 Haws’ rank among NCAA scoring leaders in 2012-13 with a 21.7 scoring average. He joins Danny Ainge, Jimmer Fredette, Michael Smith and Devin Durrant as the only Cougars to finish among the nation’s top 10 scoring leaders and is the only BYU sophomore to achieve the mark. His 780 points are the fourth-most scored at BYU in a season and his 21.7 average is 10th best in team history. 8 With a bid to the 2013 NIT, Dave Rose and the Cougars reached the postseason for a BYU record eighth-straight season. In his first year as head coach, Rose and the Cougars went to the 2006 NIT. That was followed by six-straight trips to the NCAA Tournament and last season’s NIT bid. BYU has also won 20-plus games in each of Rose’s eight seasons. 23 Tyler Haws’ point total in the second half vs. Texas, a career high for points after halftime for the junior guard. Haws scored just two points in the first half but took over in the second. Starting with a jumper with 10:45 to go, he scored 21 of BYU’s last 25 points and finished the game with 25 points. 29 BYU’s starting guards combined for 29 of BYU’s 46 rebounds against Weber State. Tyler Haws set a career high with 13, Kyle Collinsworth had 10 boards and Matt Carlino had 6. 32 The number of 20-point games Haws has in his career at BYU, ninth all-time in team history. He had 25 20-point games in 2012-13, fourth all-time in a single season. 83.3 BYU’s 3-point percentage against Texas (10 of 12), a BYU single-game record (minimum 10 3-pointers attempted). Matt Carlino hit 5 of 7, Frank Bartley IV hit 3 of 3 and Tyler Haws hit 2 of 2. 88.3 Tyler Haws’ career free-throw percentage, first all-time in BYU history. He has hit 329 of 374 from the line in his career. 90.0 Eric Mika’s shooting percentage against Mount St. Mary’s, tied for the BYU freshman record for field goal percentage in a game (minimum 10 attempts). The freshman from Alpine, Utah, hit 9 of 10 from the field and scored 20 points. He shares the record with Fred Roberts, who also hit 9 of 10 vs. Utah State on Dec. 6, 1978. 112 BYU’s point total against Stanford, a 112-103 road win. The point total is the most by a BYU team under Dave Rose and the most since Feb. 25, 1993, when the Cougars scored 128 at home against Sacramento State. It also marked a BYU record for points scored against a Pac-12 team. 214 Dave Rose (2005 to present) is second all-time in BYU basketball history with 214 career victories, behind only the great Stan Watts, who coached the Cougars to 371 wins from 1949 to 1972 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986. 1,298 The number of points Tyler Haws has scored in his career, good for 22nd all-time and one from tying Dick Nemelka for 21st. Haws holds the BYU record for most points scored during freshman and sophomore seasons combined. With 854 career points, Matt Carlino is on pace to become the next BYU player to reach 1,000 career points.\n\nDave Rose\n\nBYU head coach Dave Rose has led BYU to one of the most successful runs in program history since taking over in 2005. His career record of 214-68 ranks him second in BYU history in total victories and first in winning percentage (.759). Rose has been named conference coach of the year three times, district coach of the year twice, led the Cougars to four conference titles, six NCAA Tournament appearances, two NIT appearances, six 25-win seasons and eight 20-win seasons. In 2010, he led BYU to its first NCAA Tournament win in 17 years and the Cougars have also won at least one postseason game in the three seasons since, including a spot in the Sweet 16 in 2011 and a trip to the NIT semifinals in 2013.\n\nNational media taking notice\n\nBYU basketball has received a lot of positive attention in the early going, especially from the national media. ESPN.com’s Jeff Goodman recently ranked the nation’s top 10 freshman and has BYU big man Eric Mika at No. 9 (Mika has since moved up to No. 5 on Goodman's list).\n\nGoodman on Mika: ‘The Utah native entered the program with plenty of hype, and has already begun to live up to it.’ Goodman quotes an NBA executive who said: “He’s athletic, tough, runs the court well for their fast-paced offense and is a strong enough body to bang already. He’s got a decent post-up game against the right matchup. He plays really hard and physical -- which is rare for a freshman big man.”\n\nBruce Pearl, also of ESPN.com, created a list of the top 10 most underrated teams. He has the Cougars at No. 9. He says BYU has ‘one of the quickest and most potent offenses in the country. BYU’s speed is relentless, it shoots more than 50 percent as a team and has a 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio.’ Pearl adds that ‘Kyle Collinsworth ... reminds me of a bigger Michael Carter-Williams (rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers).’\n\nReturn of Kyle Collinsworth\n\nThe 2013-14 season marks the return of sophomore guard Kyle Collinsworth, who spent the last two years serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Russia. As a freshman in 2010-11 he averaged 5.8 points and 5.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals while shooting .481 from the field. Collinsworth started 27 games on a BYU team that won a team record 32 games and advanced to the Sweet 16 of the 2011 NCAA Tournament. Collinsworth is averaging 11.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.6 steals.\n\nRecord streaks\n\nThe Cougars will be looking to keep several program-record streaks intact during 2013-14. Coming into the season, Dave Rose has led the Cougars to eight-straight 20-win seasons and eight-straight postseason appearances, eight-straight seasons with 10-plus conference victories and four-straight seasons with a postseason victory.\n\nBYU’s newcomers\n\nThis season’s roster includes five newcomers – three freshmen, a junior college transfer and an NCAA Division I transfer. The freshmen are Frank Bartley IV from Baton Rouge, La., Eric Mika from Alpine, Utah, and Luke Worthington from Mequon, Wis. Skyler Halford comes to BYU from Salt Lake Community College and Chase Fischer is a transfer from Wake Forest.\n\nBartley prepped last season at Future College Prep in California last season and averaged 19.7 points, 8.5 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 3.3 steals and 1.0 blocks while leading his team to the West Coast Prep title.\n\nMika earned third-team All-America honors last season while leading Lone Peak to the MaxPreps.com national title and the 5A Utah state title. He averaged 16.4 points, 11.2 rebounds and 1.7 blocks.\n\nWorthington averaged 13.6 points and 10.0 rebounds while leading Homestead High School to a 13-7 record. He was named first-team All-North Shore Conference and all-state honorable mention.\n\nHalford was a first-team NJCAA All-American and averaged 17.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.6 steals at SLCC. He led SLCC to the SWAC and Region 18 titles.\n\nFischer played two season at Wake Forest after a successful prep career at Ripley High in Ripley, W.Va. He averaged 4.5 points and 1.1 rebounds and shot .422 from three last season."
