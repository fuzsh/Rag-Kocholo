Carlos Nakai joined the Philharmonia and conductor Robert Baldwin for a mesmerizing performance of James DeMars’ Two World Concerto. The work deftly combines Western classical music traditions with Native American idioms in a compelling and fascinating work. And Nakai brought a sense of spirituality to his soulful playing.
