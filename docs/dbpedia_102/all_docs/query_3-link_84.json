        "text": "For the second time in nine years, Gary Andersen is out as Utah State head coach, but it’s not on his own terms this time.\n\nAndersen was fired Saturday after a 0-3 start to the season, putting him at 7-9 in his second stint as the head coach. He previously left USU for Wisconsin in 2012 after an 11-2 season and turning the program around. When the Aggies job opened two years ago, boosters clamored to bring him back, hoping to continue winning after the successful tenure of Matt Wells. Instead, the Aggies went 7-6 last year with a quarterback now in the NFL and have been blown out in their first three games this season.\n\nAndersen previously left Wisconsin after two seasons from 2013-14, then quit on Oregon State six games into his third season from 2015-17. Now, he’s out during the season again, and the Aggies are looking to fix something that quickly spiraled downward.\n\nSo what kind of job is Utah State? What names could get in the mix? Here are some factors to keep in mind.\n\nThe standards are a lot higher than they used to be\n\nWhen Andersen first arrived in 2009, Utah State had posted 12 consecutive non-winning seasons. When he arrived the second time in 2019, the Aggies had reached seven bowl games in eight years. Going 7-6 with Jordan Love at quarterback last season wasn’t good enough. And this year’s 0-3 start, during which Utah State was outscored 114-29, wasn’t, either.\n\nThe standards are higher because the program is better. This isn’t a dead-end job. Anderson turned it into the Wisconsin job, and Wells turned it into the Texas Tech job. There was a lot of interest from rising coaches last time, which is why the decision to bring back Andersen was short-sighted. Expect this job to get a good amount of interest again.\n\nHow important are ties to the state?\n\nAndersen had playing and coaching experience at Utah before he first landed the job. Wells was a Utah State alumnus and was promoted from within. Logan is a remote town, and getting recruits there can be difficult.\n\nThe last time the job opened, athletic director John Hartwell said the next coach would need to understand the culture and nature of the program, pointing to the success with Polynesian players and others returning from Mormon missions. The Aggies typically have the second-highest number of players on missions, behind BYU. That takes an understanding of the culture and the system, as well as good roster management. How important is that this time around?\n\nThe facilities are a plus\n\nRelative to the Mountain West, the facilities are pretty good. What I wrote two years ago when this job opened holds true:\n\nAn indoor practice field has been around since 1998. Maverik Stadium has undergone renovations in recent years, including training table for team meals and nutrition. Attached to the stadium is a sports medicine complex, which is part of the bigger athletics/academics complex opened in 2008. For a program in a remote location, the tools to succeed are available.\n\nHow much is Utah State willing to pay?\n\nAndersen earned a $900,000 salary, which was seventh in the Mountain West among the 11 schools with publicly available information. Things have changed in the conference, especially as the league added six new head coaches last year. Four of them earned more than Andersen, including those at UNLV, Colorado State, Fresno State and San Diego State. The bar is higher.\n\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the finances of college sports. There have not been any reports of furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts in Utah State athletics, but the department is certainly losing millions of dollars this year, as most schools are.\n\nAccording to USA Today’s coaching salary database, Andersen’s buyout is around $2 million. It’s possible that is subject to offset, but it’s a lot of money for any athletic department right now.\n\nWhat names could get in the mix?\n\nTo start, there are a number of local candidates. Weber State head coach Jay Hill could be high on the list. The Utah native and Utah graduate is 47-29 in six seasons leading the FCS program, including 32-9 over the past three years. The 2019 team reached the FCS semifinals. Normally, a school like Utah State would need to wait until later in the season to have conversations with coaches, but Weber State isn’t playing football until spring, so there’s no need to wait.\n\nMontana State head coach Jeff Choate has improved in all four years, with an 11-4 season and an FCS semifinal appearance in 2019. He was a Utah State assistant from 2002 to 2004 and has a long history in the northwest.\n\nBYU is a top-10 team and could have several candidates. BYU assistant head coach/special teams coordinator Ed Lamb was previously the Southern Utah head coach from 2008 to 2015, going 45-47 and winning two conference titles, including his last season in 2015. BYU offensive coordinator Jeff Grimes has been lauded for this year’s offensive success, though he doesn’t have the same ties to the region as others. BYU passing game coordinator Aaron Roderick, who calls the plays, is a Utah native and a BYU grad and has coached in the state for his entire career. Since 1999, he’s coached at BYU, Snow College, Southern Utah and Utah. His ties to the area run deep.\n\nUtah defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley has long been considered the heir when Kyle Whittingham hangs it up, but his head-coach-in-waiting tag was rescinded and his stock took a huge hit this offseason when he was investigated by the school for the past use of racist language. If he feels the Utah head coaching job is no longer in his future, would he look at Utah State? Would Utah State consider him, given the investigation?\n\nAs for names outside the state, let’s look at coaches who were in the mix last time. Former Arizona head coach Rich Rodriguez is not in coaching this year, although he’s earning money from his large buyout as the Ole Miss offensive coordinator. Rodriguez has a long track record of success as a head coach (Michigan notwithstanding), but his firing at Arizona amid allegations of improper conduct will bring questions.\n\nFormer Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich spent the past two years as the Chicago Bears offensive coordinator. Helfrich reached a national championship game with the Ducks, but the bottom fell out once Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota departed. Stanford defensive coordinator Lance Anderson coached at Utah State in 2004 and recruits Utah for Stanford. Virginia offensive coordinator Robert Anae played at BYU and coached there over three stints. He was a finalist for the Hawaii job a year ago but backed out.\n\nUtah State has turned itself into an appealing job over the past decade. It proved how much the right hire can change things, but the wrong hire can as well.\n\nA coaching carousel that wasn’t expected to be busy already has two in-season changes — or three if you count Southern Miss twice. Stay tuned to the Coaching Tracker as this develops.\n\n(Photo: Brian Losness / USA Today)"
