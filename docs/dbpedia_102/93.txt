"It's a compliment to our program to be invited to play in the College Basketball Experience Tournament. We will face many tests and teams from coast to coast. We are excited about the opportunities we have to play and look forward to preparing our team for the challenge."

The 2013-14 regular season will open at home on Friday, Nov. 8, with instate opponent Weber State.
