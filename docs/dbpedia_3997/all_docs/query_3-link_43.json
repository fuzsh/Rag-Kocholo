        "text": "George Nakashima began his furniture business as a reactionary movement against the practice of twentieth-century “modern” architecture, design, and art. Through his work, he called for a reclamation of the philosophy of earlier historical periods, in which the human eye and hand determined an individual’s world in relationship to the universe, not the universe itself.\n\nGeorge’s approach was that of an Integral Yogi: not only did he believe that the inherent beauty of natural materials like wood should be studied, understood and respected, but that the product should retain such materials’ marks of individuality, as well as those of the craftsperson who brings it into being.\n\nIn his book The Soul of a Tree, George described his philosophy in which wood is not regarded as an inanimate object, but rather as a material which “lives and breathes.” Through the woodworker’s hands, wood takes on a life of its own. We continue to observe this philosophy when crafting the Nakashima furniture we produce today.\n\nMira Nakashima’s work grows from her father’s philosophical legacy and expresses her own profound admiration for nature, having lived and worked in close contact with the wood that defines both her artistry and her daily experience. In her designs, Mira captures the form and spirit of the wood, which is capable of transmitting its sensitivity, peace, and harmony into the furniture and those who use it.\n\nTrained in her father’s craft from a young age, Mira received her formal design education at Harvard and within Waseda University’s intensive atelier system, which imbued her conceptual process with a strong belief in the value of collaboration. Under her leadership, Nakashima Woodworkers has expanded its community of craftspeople and integrated design team, which adheres to the approach and philosophy established by George while imagining new, creative solutions.\n\nIn carrying on the Nakashima legacy, Mira was motivated to preserve and utilize the prodigious pile of custom-sawn lumber that her father left with his passing in 1990. Along with her daughter Maria and ex-husband Tetsu Amagasu, Mira conceived of a modified Pennsylvania “pole barn” structure to house the lumber on the New Hope property, which continues to be an invaluable source of raw material and inspiration.\n\nSpurred by her deep respect for her father’s ideals and process, Mira strives to appreciate, safeguard, and expand upon the traditions and knowledge integral to George’s work, and to communicate through wood the beauty that is a manifestation of the divine.\n\nFrom an early age, Kevin Nakashima embodied his father’s belief that “Furniture should be lived with and not treated as something overly precious. A certain amount of scratching and denting adds character to a piece.” His preternatural gift for “antiquing” a surface became known affectionately among the family as “Kevinizing,” a practice that is prized and encouraged among all end-users of Nakashima furniture.\n\nIn the shop, Kevin’s role evolved from sweeping and drilling holes to shaving spindles, assembling chairs, and making pencil holders, letter openers, and seat blanks. Having lived his whole life on the New Hope property, Kevin is keenly aware of the pleasure that comes with daily use of objects crafted with artistry and care.\n\nMore than any other, Kevin has long been attuned to the “personal relations” side of the Nakashima business. Always gregarious, he catches visitors – including artists, philosophers, scientists, and collectors – in conversation, facilitating the fruitful exchange of knowledge and stories.\n\nKevin’s spirit and character naturally lend themselves to the joyful perpetuation of the Nakashima legacy, in the support and caregiving he’s provided and in the memories he’s preserved of his parents, their relationship, and their joint contributions to the studio.\n\nEach team member brings a different gift to our work. Some have worked in construction, others have studied art, and some have crafted furniture in other places, but all are unified by a shared love and respect for George Nakashima’s work, design approach, and way of life.\n\nJon received a Quaker education and came to Nakashima in 1974 in search of a job. He decided to devote a lifetime to following George’s path and eventually married George’s daughter, Mira. His careful attention has served the wood well; from his perch in the Chair Shop, he crafts fine pieces and dispenses mystic philosophy. His natural sensitivity finds full expression in the phrase “Silent Trees Speak.”\n\nJaysond joined the Design Department in 2018. He brought with him a background in architecture, interior design, and historic architectural restoration. He spearheads wood searches for new orders, as well as design development for unusual projects, creates hand drawings and supervises all furniture construction in the woodshop with Mira.\n\nAlyssa joined Nakashima in the Finishing Department in 1995 and has dedicated herself to learning as much as she can about furniture construction, details and history. Expert and exacting, she passes along with meticulous care the legacy of Nakashima furniture construction to the younger woodworkers since Jerry retired in 2020.\n\nMichael came to Nakashima in 2010 after the dedication ceremony of the Peace Garden at Chandler Hall in Newtown, PA, which was designed by Mira and built by Michael’s parents in memory of Marion Nakashima. Every project Michael works on has an exceptionally beautiful spiritual presence, reflecting the mind, hand, and spirit of the maker and allowing the intrinsic qualities of the wood to speak.\n\nGrowing up in Doylestown, PA, David would ride his bike past the New Hope property, with its unique buildings and beautiful setting, and wondered what went on there. He joined Nakashima in 1999, where he works in the Main Shop, and his sense of both humor and humility allows him to flow seamlessly to whatever job needs to be done.\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Rick worked as an engineer for fifteen years before coming to Nakashima in 2005. In the Chair Shop, he crafts turned-leg chairs, intricate lamps, and various pieces for the showroom; his engineer’s intellectual precision is evident in every piece.\n\nThanks to a grant from the World Monument Fund, Brandon came to Nakashima in 2015 with a dual\n\nrole of woodworker and apprentice restoration carpenter for the property. With his artistic eye,\n\nBrandon has worked his way up from making smaller objects for the gift shop to making large dining\n\ntables, as well as helping to record, organize, select and kiln dry the wood in the storage sheds.\n\nJustin started as a groundskeeper in 2003 and is currently head of the Finishing Department. His awareness of the finishing procedure’s impact on the environment, the furniture, and its end-users is extraordinary. Justin also faithfully tends the property’s vegetable garden , has a knack for catching and releasing birds that get trapped in buildings, and has rescued the fish in the ponds from large snapping turtles.\n\nA graduate of RIT, John worked at Thomas Moser for 17 years from the bench through design and administration before coming to Nakashima’s in 2008. As General Manager, he has become an indispensable member of the team, establishing and maintaining organization, peace and harmony among a previously chaotic group of artisans. He joined the Board of Directors in 2016. An excellent problem-solver and multi-tasker, John has hired talented younger woodworkers to ensure that Nakashima’s has a clear path into the future, initiated our establishment as an historic site, makes sure that our buildings are maintained for future generations to enjoy, as well as scheduling production, shipping and taking care of furniture restoration.\n\nToshi, named after his great-grandfather George whose middle name was Katsutoshi, is pursuing his college education while also working at Nakashima’s. Entertaining and outgoing like his great-uncle Kevin, Toshi is the only one of Mira’s seven grandchildren who lives nearby. He was happy to make his first Mira chair at 16 years old with help from the woodworkers, and he enjoys guiding the post-Pandemic tours of the property on Saturdays.\n\nMira’s only daughter, Maria grew up amongst the architecture, trees, boards and shops of George Nakashima Woodworkers. Maria’s first job at Nakashima’s was about 1980, and through experience working at the complex and what she has learned primarily from her mother and grandparents, Maria has an intimate knowledge of the business. She has a degree in architecture from McGill University and a Master of Architecture from the University of California at Berkeley. Maria has worked and lived in the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and India. Now specializing in heritage conservation, she joined the Board of Directors in 2022 to represent her siblings and looks forward to helping guide the business into the future.\n\nWith degrees from Penn State, an MPA from Cornell, and MLIS from Rutgers, Dave, has become the archivist at Nakashima. He quietly handles authentications, documentation and research for our team. Along with guiding tours, Dave initiated the renovation and organization of two archival rooms and often discovers little-known pieces of Nakashima history.\n\nBorn in Cornwall and raised in Dorset, United Kingdom, Karen took a circuitous route to Nakashima’s. After shepherding four children through three countries, she turned her hand to bookkeeping. She ensures the bills get paid and payroll happens! Most of all, Karen enjoys watching the progress of the pieces in the woodshop.\n\nZane is one of the newest members of the Nakashima Team. With a background in Industrial Design; He is currently learning the fine art of searching the wood piles for boards appropriate to orders, as well as learning how to identify wood species. Dedicated to our legacy, Zane creates beautiful shop drawings by hand to be used by the woodworkers."
