Indexes are available for most years; contact the Genealogy Division for further information.\n\nThe publicly available years of the U.S. census are available on several commercial genealogy sites. FamilySearch provides access free of charge, although you must create an account and sign in: https://www.familysearch.org/\n\nSpecial Census\n\nThe State Archives does have Special Census schedules available on microfilm in the reading room. These include:\n\nThe Agricultural Census 1850-1880 (Available on FamilySearch)\n\nThe Manufacturers Census 1820-1880\n\nSocial Statistics 1850-1880\n\nCensus of Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent (3-D Census) 1880\n\nState Census\n\nIndiana's state censuses were performed solely as a legislative count of the population performed by count officials. They only delivered statistical information to the state government. Thus, no similar state record to the federal census, with its full names and locations, exists."
