        "text": "Box Score\n\nOct. 17, 2008\n\nBox Score | Photo Gallery\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. - Six different Tigers scored as the No. 20 University of Missouri soccer team stormed to a 6-1 victory over Francis Marion on Friday night at Walton Stadium. Mizzou improves to 10-4-0 with the victory while the Patriots fall to 2-11-1.\n\n\"Francis Marion was a good team and was well coached,\" Missouri Head Coach Bryan Blitz said. \"Anytime you score an early goal it loosens up the game. The biggest difference was our depth today because it allowed us to wear the other team down.\"\n\nA misclearance by Francis Marion allowed the Tigers to strike first in the 13th minute. Senior Kat Tarr send a long ball into the box that two Patriot defenders were unable to clear. Junior forward Michelle Collins gathered the loose ball, dribbled past the defenders, and scored on a low shot to the far post. The goal was the fifth of the year for Collins, who is tied for second on the team with 14 points.\n\nSeven minutes later sophomore forward Alysha Bonnick notched her team-leading seven goal of the season to give the Tigers a 2-0 advantage. The striker unleashed a shot for just outside the box that curled into the top corner of the net and past the Patriot goalie for the eventual game-winner.\n\nMissouri took advantage of a set piece in the 43rd minute to enter the break up 3-0. Senior forward Ashley Hamblin sailed a corner kick eight yards in front of the goal, which senior defender Kat Tarr headed back on net for her first tally of the season.\n\nMizzou increased its offensive onslaught in the second half and went up 4-0 with 53 minutes on the clock when junior midfielder Bree Thornton uncorked a 19-yard blast over the Patriot goalies head. The goal was the second of the year for Thornton.\n\nIn the 66th minute, Francis Marion caught the Mizzou defense off guard to make the game 4-1. Patriot Taylor Jenkins blasted a high 30-yard shot toward goal that sailed just over the outstretched fingers of Tiger goalie Mallory Forst.\n\nThe Tigers responded six minutes later with the team's fifth goal of the night. Hamblin dribbled to the far endline and sent a cross six yards in front of the goal mouth. Sophomore forward Kari Adam outjumped everyone to head the ball on net for her second goal of the year.\n\nSophomore midfielder Krista Kruse closed out scoring in the 89th minute when she beat the Patriot goalie to a header from freshman defender Mallory Stipetich and knocked the ball in.\n\nThe Tigers outshot Francis Marion 35-3 in the contest, including a 16-2 shots on goal advantage.\n\nMizzou travels to College Station, Texas, on Sunday for an important contest against No. 6 Texas A&M at 1:30. The game will be televised nationally on ESPNU with veteran play-by-play announcer Beth Mowins and U.S. National Team member Cat Whitehill on the call."
