Cornish was freed \"on or before April 19, 1861,\"5 which presumably enabled him to earn $300.00 as a soldier in the Union army.6 Cornish enlisted as a private in Company D of the 4th U.S. Colored Troops regiment on July 28, 1863.7 He was enlisted by Col. Wm. Birney at Baltimore, Maryland and was to serve a term of three years before being discharged.8 After serving the majority of his term, Cornish was promoted to corporal on July 22, 1865.9\n\nThe 4th regiment organized in Baltimore, Maryland from July 15, to September 1, 1863, to serve three years.10 The regiment was drilled and disciplined in Yorktown, Virginia where they also built fortifications.11 The regiment saw action mainly in Virginia during 1864. They were involved in battles at Petersburg, City Point, Chapin's Farm, Dutch Gap, Spring Hill, Jordan's Farm, and Bermuda Hundred.12 The engagements at Spring Hill and Jordan's Farm saw tremendous losses in both killed and wounded soldiers.13 The regiment also saw action in North Carolina, where they participated in campaigns at Fort Fisher and Greensborough.14\n\nDuring the war, he suffered from several injuries that hindered his ability to perform manual labor. In the summer of 1864, Cornish contracted piles \"whilst in line of duty at 'Spring Hill' near Petersburg, Va.\" and \"no hospital treatment given.\"15 He suffered a gunshot wound to his left shoulder in action at Sugar Loaf, North Carolina around December 1864 or January 1865.16 He also suffered from an accident that occurred at Fort Totten, about seven miles from Washington, D.C.17 This injury occurred when a cannon slipped causing him to fall between the wheels and cannons with the weight of the cannon crushing his chest \"producing congestion and hemorrhage of the lungs.\"18 From January 1865 until June 1865, Cornish was assigned to \"daily duty as Color Guard.\"19 He may not have been able to perform laborious activities, which is why he was assigned that type of duty. The regiment was stationed at Fort Lincoln, North Carolina for several months after the war acting as a garrison.20 Cornish was not officially discharged from the army until May 4, 1866 at Washington, D.C.21\n\nAfter the war, Cornish moved to Baltimore, Maryland from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. His occupation in Baltimore had been shucking oysters, but his wound hindered his ability to perform manual labor.22 He was not able to work for two years and six months after his discharge because the injuries were that severe.23 Soon after his discharge, he was married to Mary A. Simpson on October 5, 1876 at Baltimore, Maryland by Reverend Mr. Sluben and the marriage record was filed in Baltimore.24 Josiah and Mary resided at several residences during their tenure in Baltimore. These included 150 Rogers Avenue,25 315 McElderry Street,26 105 South Caroline Street,27 and 618 McElderry Street.28 In 1880, Josiah and Mary were living together with a boarder named William Simpson.29 Twenty years later, in 1900, Josiah and Mary were listed as boarders in David Tate's household.30\n\nSince his discharge in May of 1866, Cornish began receiving a monthly pension of $6.00 for \"injury of chest and G.S.W. (gunshot wound) of left arm.\"31 That amount increased to $10.00 per month commencing on October 15, 1890, then to $14.00 per month on October 22, 1890, and finally $17.00 per month commencing September 3, 1910.32 On May 12, 1914, he applied for a pension increase, which was accepted for the amount of $24.00 per month.33 On September 18, 1913 that Josiah Cornish died from \"chronic brights disease,\" and he was subsequently buried on September 22, 1913 at the National Cemetery.34 At the time of his death, he was employed as a hod carrier.35 His place of residence at death was 620 McElderry Street.36\n\nEndnotes:\n\n1.
