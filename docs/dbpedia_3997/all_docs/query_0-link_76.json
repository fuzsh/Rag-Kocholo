        "text": "LAZARO LOPEZ\n\nLazaro Lopez and Julia Dulion Lopez\n\nLazaro ‘Laz’ Lopez (1850-1903) was born at Aviles, Asturias Province, north western Spain in October 1850. He left Spain for Cuba in 1863 and immigrated to the United States landing in Texas before arriving at Biloxi in 1868. In late July 1870, Lazaro was domiciled at Biloxi with Joseph Garcia (1828-1870+), also a Spaniard, who was the proprietor of a coffee house. Lazaro made his livelihood at this time keeping bar with Andrew Nugarre (1840-1870+), a fellow Spaniard.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, September 26, 1903, p. 1 and 1870 Harrison Co., Mississippi Federal Census M593_729, p. 323B, image 655)\n\nLaz and Julia Dulion Lopez\n\nOn August 19, 1871 at Harrison County, Mississippi, Judge Lyman B. Holley married Lazaro Lopez and Julia Dulion (1857-1918), the daughter of Arnaud Michel Dulion (1830?-1870), a French immigrant, and Mary Ann Keegan or Briscoe (1832-1890), a native of Ireland. Their children were: Josephine Mary Angeline Lopez (1872-1892); Teresa Lopez (1873-1951) m. Hyman M. Folkes (1871-1926); Clara Josephine Lopez (1875-1895); Lazaro T. Lopez (1877-1918) married Eurilda ‘Lily’ Seal (1879-1966); Arnaud Lopez (1880-1948) m. Nellie May Gorman (1890-1952); Erena Lopez (1885-1940) married Edward L. Brady (1874-1939); Julius M. Lopez (1886-1958) m. Belle Markey (1887-1946); Juanita Olivia Lopez (1890-1891); Rowena Maria Lopez (1895-1986) married Philip Columbus Caldwell (1892-1930+); and Noreta Julia Lopez (1896-1960) married James Rucks Yerger Jr. (1892-1931).(Harrison Co., Mississippi MRB 6, p. 76)\n\nEarly land acquisitions in downtown Biloxi\n\nIn 1870, Lazaro Lopez acquired a lot in Biloxi on the northwest corner of Pass Christian and Point Cadet Road, now West Howard Avenue and Reynoir Street in a tax sale. In November 1884, Mrs. Frederique Reynoir and Arthur Reynoir conveyed to Laz Lopez a small lot, 20 feet by 40 feet, on the west side of Reynoir Street. Laz Lopez owned the land to the south; Mrs. Nelson was to the north; and Lazarus Seymour bordered to the west.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 20, p. 459)\n\n1890 new residence\n\nJ.R. Harkess was contracted to erect a $7000 residence for Laz Lopez and Julia Dulion Lopez on the corner of Pass Christian Street and Reynoir Street. In early March, the Lopez home was \"assuming architectural proportions for beauty and prominence second to none.. By late April 1890, the Lopez domicile was described as elegant and rapidly approaching completion.(The Biloxi Herald, January 18, 1890, p. 4, March 8, 1890, p. 4 and April 26, 1890, p. 4)\n\n1890 store building\n\n1895\n\nIn August 1895, Lazaro Lopez, Sr. acquired two very valuable, contiguous lots on the southeast corner of West Howard Avenue and Reynoir Street from the Estate of Constantino Olivari (1841-1894), an Italian immigrant entrepreneur. Mr. Olivari was the proprietor of a ship chandlery and grocery store on Howard Avenue and Lameuse Street. The Olivari tracts had 120-feet on West Howard Avenue and ran south with 150-feet fronting on Reynoir. After Mr. Olivari’s demise, two of his children Eulalie Olivari Clark (1872-, the spouse of James Penton Clark (1872-1907+), and Vincent Jean Olivari (1874-1934), created a forced heirship sale in the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, which Mr. Lopez and his family, was the beneficiary.(Harrison Co., Mississippi land Deed Bk. 33, p. 113 and Harrison Co., Mississippi Chancery Court Cause No. 683-1895)\n\nCommerce\n\nThe L. Lopez & Company store building was erected on the northeast corner of Pass Christian Street and Reynoir Street in the spring of 1890. An old structure on the site was demolished before the two-story, (The Biloxi Herald, May 17, 1890, p. 4)\n\nNew store started in early May 1900.(The Biloxi Herald, April 27, 1900, p. 8)\n\nUpon his demise and subsequent probate in 1903, Teresa Lopez Folkes was legated a one-half interest in this property. Theodore P. Dulion (1861-1907), the uncle of Mrs. Folkes, owned the other undivided, one-half interest. After the death of Mr. Dulion in 1907, his one-half interest was left to his children: Una C. Dulion; Paul Dulion; Barton Dulion; Roy Dulion; Fay Dulion Hermann; and Julia Abbey Dulion. They sold their interest to Tersea Lopez Folkes in February 1924 for $20,000. Grant’s Drug Store was situated on this property at this time.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 33, p. 113 and Bk. 140, p. 567 and Bk. 140, p. 588)\n\nSEAFOOD PIONEER\n\nLopez, Elmer and Company\n\nThe Lopez, Elmer and Company was organized in 1881, with a capital stock of $8,000 by Lazaro Lopez (1850-1903), F. William Elmer (1847-1926), W.K.M. Dukate (1853-1916), William Gorenflo (1844-1932), and James Maycock (1826-1892). The land on which the Lopez, Elmer and Company plant was built in 1881, was purchased from Joseph Diaz Jr. (1845-1923) and Adele Santa Cruz Diaz (1846-1915) on June 29, 1881 for $100. The lot had a front of 82 feet on Back Bay and ran south 196 feet. Reynoir Street was the western boundary. Diaz had purchased a tract here in 1873, from John Bradford. It was 82 feet x 950 feet and cost $200. Henry Diaz (1872-1944), a son of Joseph Diaz Jr., operated a store on the northwest corner of Reynoir and Chartres Street, now Bay View Avenue. In 1914, Mr. Diaz was operating a canning company east of the Biloxi Canning Company.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. Bk.18, p. 20 and Bk. 13, pp. 53-54)\n\nThe Pascagoula Democrat-Star reported on December 30, 1881, that the Lopez, Elmer and Company was placing its canning machines in the factory. The proprietors had over one hundred, local, white men and boys on the payroll. They were employed as follows: forty-four openers, forty-five men manning fifteen boats, twenty or more canners and wharf men.(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, December 30, 1881, p. 3)\n\nSince none of these Biloxi seafood pioneers had any experience in canning operations, W.K.M. Dukate was selected to go to Baltimore where the packing industry was well established. Here he observed procedures, gathered technical information, and purchased machinery for the coving of oysters and canning shrimp. It is very probable that Mr. Dukate brought Charles Patten (1835-1922), a Baltimore native, to Biloxi in 1881, to manage the new cannery. Patton remained associated with the cannery until his wife, Ellen Spencer, died here in February 1915. He returned to Baltimore where he resided at 1527 North Caroline Street. Mr. Patten expired at Baltimore on January 11, 1922. His remains were interred in the Loudon Park Cemetery.(The Baltimore Sun, January 13, 1922)\n\nThe initial efforts of The Lopez, Elmer and Company were crude, but ready markets were available and the organization was profitable. The Lopez, Elmer and Company was dissolved in 1884, and the Biloxi Canning Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Mississippi was chartered on March 23, 1883.\n\nIn rapid succession, after the dissolution of The Lopez, Elmer and Company, the Barataria Canning Company, William Gorenflo & Company, E.C. Joullian & Company, and J.T. Maybury were competing in the seafood packing business at Biloxi. By 1902, the factories of Biloxi ranked second to those of Baltimore, Maryland in canning American oysters.(Twentieth Century Coast Edition of The Biloxi Daily Herald, 1902, p. 20)\n\nLopez, Dunbar’s Sons & Company\n\nIn October 1888, they planned to dig another artesian well at their oyster factory.(The Biloxi Herald, October 27, 1888, p. 8)\n\nIn November 1889, the firm made large additions to their shucking sheds and solicited employment for ‘white and colored’.(The Biloxi Herald, November 16, 1889, p. 4)\n\nBuying figs from Russell & Co. of Grand Bay, Alabama; George Foretich at Scranton [Pascagoula]; and Delmas Seymour of Ocean Springs.(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, June 19, 1891, p. 2)\n\nIn July 1893, the Julius Elbert, a new tug boat, owned by Laz Lopez and W.K.M Dukate, arrived in Biloxi this week from Mobile. It will put to work at Lopez, Dunbar’s Sons & Company.(The Biloxi Herald, July 1, 1893, p. 8)\n\nUnfortunately the day has come that the Biloxi canners are forced to move their factories to other locations. Has something to do with the oyster dredging law.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, February 4, 1900, p. 12)\n\nLopez, Dunbar’s Sons & Co.\n\nThe Lopez, Dunbar’s Sons & Company was commenced in 1884, when Lazaro Lopez (1850-1903) and W.K.M. Dukate (1852-1916) resigned from the Biloxi Canning Company. The Biloxi Canning Company was located in Section 27, T7S-R9W, in the city of Biloxi, Mississippi on the Back Bay of Biloxi, at the head of Reynoir Street. It was originally called The Lopez, Elmer and Company. This company was organized in 1881, with a capital stock of $8,000 by Lazaro Lopez, F. William Elmer (1847-1926), W.K.M. Dukate, William Gorenflo (1844-1932), and James Maycock (1826-1892).(1)\n\nLopez, Dunbar’s & Sons was situated on East Beach in Biloxi. In 1895, it was the second largest oyster canning plant in the United States. The factory utilized the Norton Brothers machinery to pack its shrimp with the patented muslin bag insuring a good product. Its shrimp were marketed under the “Dunbar Standard”, “Deer head”, “Lion Head”, and “Pelicans” labels.\n\n(see The Biloxi Herald, “Biloxi Chief Industry”, September 12, 1892, p. 4)\n\nLopez & Dukate\n\nLopez & Dukate cannery\n\nIn November 1899, Lopez & Dukate advertised for fifty boats to fish on the oyster banks and pay oystermen 40 cents per barrel of oyster. They would pay for fifty boats to transport oysters from the reef to the factory wharf for 40 to 50 cents per barrel. The factory also sought one hundred oyster shuckers.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, November 10, 1899, p. 8)\n\nIn May 1901, a special train consisting of three coaches and a baggage car and transporting about eighty, Bohemians laborers, who were employed by Lopez & Dukate, left Biloxi for their Maryland homes to work in the seafood industry there in the summer months. Biloxi’s oyster industry was closed until cooler weather in the fall.(The Biloxi Herald, May 5, 1901, p. 8)\n\nIn July 1902, L. Lopez & Dukate contracted with Ola (sic) Thompson (1874-1944) to build a large oyster cannery, house, store, warehouse, and Bohemian camp at the Rigolets in southeast Louisiana. T.J. Rosell (1861-1923), Biloxi builder and mill owner, had crews busy at the Rigolets erecting a Catholic Church, which cost $1500, for the workers of the Lopez & Dukate cannery.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, July 16, 1902, p.8 and November 20, 1905, p. 1)\n\nLopez & Dukate-Sent Captain Fred Eaton aboard Tom, a large power boat,to Morgan City, Louisiana in late June 1907 to open a canning factory.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, June 29, 1907, p. 5)\n\nDunbars, Lopez, and Dukate Company\n\nThe Dunbars, Lopez, and Dukate Company was organized at NOLA on September 8, 1908.\n\nThey advertised in September 1909, as follows:\n\nDUNBARS, LOPEZ, and DUKATE COMPANY\n\nCanning Factory\n\nOYSTER, SHRIMP, and FRUIT PACKERS\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi\n\nLaborers wanted, both white and colored, in season\n\n(The Daily Herald, September 29, 1909, p. 3)\n\nIn July 1911, workers at the Dunbars, Lopez, and Dukate Company were repairing factory schooners for the autumn pack in its boatyard.(The Daily Herald, July 20, 1911, p. 8)\n\nIn September 1915, the Dunbars, Lopez, and Dukate Company amended its charter and changed its nameto Dunbar Dukate Co. Inc. At this time, the company was located at 1011 Maison Blanche Building with George H. Dunbar as president and Elbert L. Dukate, secretary.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chattel Deed Bk. 57, p. 208-210 and The Daily Herald, October 14, 1915, p. 2)\n\nBanker\n\nLazaro Lopez was a pioneer in finance at Biloxi, Mississippi. He was a founder of the Biloxi branch of the Inter-State Building & Loan Association of Columbus, Georgia and the Bank of Biloxi. The local Inter-State Building & Loan Association was founded in December 1889 and the Bank of Biloxi was incorporated on December 26, 1892.(The Biloxi Herald, December 21, 1889, p. 4 and January 21, 1893, p. 4)\n\nThe founding fathers of the Bank of Biloxi were primarily the following Biloxi seafood packers and merchants: Lazaro Lopez, W.K.M. Dukate, Isidore Heidenheim, F.W. Elmer, J.T. Maybury, S. Picard, A.O. Bourdon Sr., B. Tucei, O.M. Nilson, H. Otto, W.H. Maybin, J.W. Maybin, W.A. White, Charles F. Theobald, Charles Redding, T.P. Dulion, Phil McCabe, John Walker, and E.J. Buck. The first officers of the Bank of Biloxi were: C.F. Theobald, president; Lazaro Lopez, vice president; and E.J. Buck, cashier.(The Biloxi Herald, February 25, 1893, p. 8)\n\nSeashore Academy\n\nThe Seashore Academy, a private boy’s boarding school, was chartered in Mississippi in June 1893 by Laz Lopez, F.W. Elmer, S. Picard, John Walker, E.J. Buck, H.T. Greaves, E.W. Morrill, H. Otto, J.R. Harkness (1827-1903), George H. Dunbar, and F.B. Dunbar. This educational institution was situated on the beach front at Biloxi about 500 feet west of the Biloxi Lighthouse. It opened in September 1893 with Dr. George S. Roudebush (1829-1921), a Presbyterian minister, in charge. Dr. Roudebush was born in Ohio.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chattel Deed Bk. 1, p. 6 and The Biloxi Herald, July 1, 1893, p. 8)\n\nPass Christian Street residence-1890\n\nThe first residence of Lazaro Lopez on Pass Christian Street, now Howard Avenue, was erected commencing in January 1890 by John R. Harkness (1827-1903), local building contractor. The $7000 structure was completed in May 1890 and described as ‘an ornament and credit to the enterprise of our beautiful city’.(The Biloxi Herald, January 18, 1890, p. 4, March 1, 1890, p. 4, April 26, 1890, p. 4)\n\nThe Lopez family residence on Pass Christian Street was destroyed by fire in November 1900.\n\nForest Park School\n\nIn early September 1898, the City of Biloxi was the recipient of three new public schools: the Back Bay Ward School was donated by W.K.M. Dukate and William Gorenflo; the Primary School situated on the corner of Main Street and Water Street given by Mayor Harry T. Howard; and the Forest Park School on Porter Avenue donated by Lazaro Lopez and Julia Dulion Lopez.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, September 10, 1898, p.4)\n\nIn February 1898, Lazaro Lopez acquired a large lot on the SW/C of Porter and Cemetery Street, now Irish Hill Drive, for $650 from J.S. Williams and O.S. Williams. The Williams lot ran south from a point on Cemetery Street which was twelve feet west of Porter for one hundred ninety-five feet; thence west one hundred twenty-nine feet; thence north two hundred two feet; and then one hundred twenty-nine feet to the point of beginning on Cemetery Street. There was a twelve-foot banquette or R-O-W on Porter which ran south for one hundred ninety-five feet.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 37, p. 411)\n\nFrom this tract formerly of Williams, Mr. Lopez donated to the City of Biloxi, the Forest Park School lot. Its perimeter was described as being: eighty-five feetsouth from a point on Cemetery Street which is twelve feet west of Porter; thence west for one hundred thirty feet; then north eighty-five feet; then east one hundred thirty feet to the point of beginning on Cemetery Street. The Lopez deed required that this lot be used by the City of Biloxi for school purposes or other charitable functions or its title would revert back to the Lopez family.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 39, p. 70)\n\nIt is interesting to note that Porter Street was still closed to the public as late as February 1890. At this time, Biloxi’s Town Council postponed a petition for its opening.(The Biloxi Herald, February 8, 1890, p. 4)\n\nAfter the demise of Lazaro Lopez in late September 1903, the land on Porter and Cemetery Street juxtaposed to the Forest Park School parcel was inherited by Erena Lopez, his daughter.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Will Bk. 3, p. 21)\n\nWest End School\n\nIn time, the Forest Park School became known as ‘the West End School’ because of its location on the western end of Biloxi. It appears to have functioned as a school until the new Lopez School opened nearby on West Howard Avenue in 1924. The City of Biloxi then utilized the building to house the Charles L. Baudry American Legion Post No. 33. This organization formed in early November 1919, when fifty veterans of WWI met at the Maccabees Hall on West Howard Avenue and selected to honor U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Charles L. Baudry (1891-1918), a New Orleans native and Biloxi resident who was killed in action at Chateau Thierry in France in October 1918.(The Daily Herald, December 7, 1918 and November 4, 1919, p. 1)\n\nCity of Biloxi\n\nDuring the 1943-1947, mayoral term of Chester A. Delacruz(1889-1964), Biloxi seafood packer, and City Clerk J.A. ‘Tony’ Creel (1901-1992), the City of Biloxi in January 1946, adopted a resolution to abandon and convey the West End School site and an additional lot contiguous to the school lot which it had purchased in June 1927 for $800. The building on the parcel was valued at $700. On January 21, 1946, the city of Biloxi sold to Julius M. Lopez and Noreta Lopez Yerger for $1500 the following tract on the SW/C of Porter and Cemetery Street: From the SW/C of Porter and Cemetery Street go 185 feet south along Porter; thence 175 feet west; thence 98 feet north; thence 51 feet west; thence 108 feet north; thence 226 feet along Cemetery Street to the point of beginning. At the same time, Eurilda Seal Lopez, Teresa Lopez Folkes, Rowena Lopez Caldwell, and Arnaud Lopez gave Julius M. Lopez and Noreta Lopez Yerger a quitclaim deed on this tract.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 283, p. 532 and p. 535)\n\nCatholic Bishop Diocese of Natchez and Notre Dame\n\nIn early September 1943, Notre Dame High School, the first Catholic boy’s high school in Biloxi was commenced by Brothers from Notre Dame University with Reverend Brother Francis Borgia, CSC, as principal. Possession of the Dantzler House on West Beach near the Biloxi Lighthouse was taken by the Brothers on August 18, 1943. Frank Leahy (1908-1973), legendary football coach of the Fighting Irish, attempted to find a football coach for the new school. He worked with the Reverend Doctor Geoffrey O’Connell (1900-1976), superintendent of Catholic schools in Mississippi, to obtain a first class coach for the fledgling football squad. One hundred twenty-five students enrolled in the new educational institution.(The Daily Herald, September 9, 1943, p. 7)\n\nIn March 1946, Julius M. Lopez and Noreta Lopez Yerger for $1500 sold the West End School property to Richard O. Gerow, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Natchez for the use of the Nativity of the B.V.M. Parish. Notre Dame utilized the old building for its Junior High School program, probably until it relocated to its new campus on the north end of Hopkins Boulevard in September 1953. Here in a new $220,000 building Brother Rex, C.S.C and the principal, anticipated school to commence on September 14th for grades seven through twelve.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 283, p. 537and The Daily Herald, September 1, 1953, p. 1)\n\nDelchamps\n\nAfter the West End School site was rezoned in October 1954 by the Biloxi zoning board, Bishop R.O. Gerow sold the former school property to Delchamps Food Stores Inc., a Mobile, Alabama based retail food chain. The consideration was $55,000. One of the stipulations in the warranty deed was that ‘the old school building to be removed within sixty days’. Delchamps was expected to erect a large food market here in the fall of 1955. The Mobile based food chain anticipated total expenditures for their Biloxi store to be about $350,000, which included land acquisition, construction of a 16,000 square-foot store building, stock, equipment, and parking lot.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 389, p. 272 and The Daily Herald, December 13, 1954, p. 1)\n\n1897 Yellow Fever\n\nThe 1897 Biloxi Yellow Fever event was benign to the Lopez family as Laz, Julia and some of the older children had been infected at other times and were now immune. Only, Julius M. Lopez (1886-1958), then a child, got the virus, but survived.(The Biloxi Herald, October 30, 1897, p. 1)\n\nPolitical Career\n\nLazaro Lopez was elected Ward 3 Alderman at least twice during his short tenure in Biloxi's politics. In April 1898, he donated a lot to the City of Biloxi to be utilized as a 'pound' or storage site for stock animals that were illegally roaming the street of Biloxi. The City was required to fence the lot.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, April 9, 1898, p. 8)\n\n1900 fire\n\nIn early November 1900, unarguably the worst fire in the long history of Biloxi commenced on the Kennedy property on the east side of Reynoir Street near the L&N Depot and swept southward to the beach. Much commercial and residential property was totally destroyed and that of Lazaro Lopez, which was situated on Howard Avenue and Reynoir Street was inflicted the greatest damage. It was estimated that the losses of Mr. Lopez would exceed $80,000. After surveying his devastated properties, he stated that “ it was his intention at the earliest possible time to undertake the work of replacing the handsome structures destroyed with buildings no less ornamented.”(The Biloxi Daily Herald, November 11, 1900, p. 1)\n\nLOPEZ HOME (1901-1920)-West Howard Avenue\n\nNew residence-1901\n\nThe handsome Lazaro Lopez residence was situated on the north side of West Howard Avenue between Reynoir Street and Croesus Street. It was erected commencing in May 1901 following the great conflagration of early November 1900, unarguably the worst fire in the long history of Biloxi. This destructive blaze commenced on the Kennedy property on the east side of Reynoir Street near the L&N Depot and swept southward to the beach. Much commercial and residential property was totally destroyed and that of Lazaro Lopez, which was situated on West Howard Avenue and Reynoir Street was inflicted the greatest damage. It was estimated that the losses of Mr. Lopez were in excess of $80,000. After surveying his devastated properties, he stated that: “it was his intention at the earliest possible time to undertake the work of replacing the handsome structures destroyed with buildings no less ornamented.”(The Biloxi Daily Herald, November 11, 1900, p. 1)\n\nThe new, two-story, Lopez domicile was built upon the site of their fire ravished home. It was designed and its construction supervised by Theo Brune (1854-1932), well-known New Orleans architect, and built by Barnes & Owens from Bedford Sandstone. The roof was slate and adorned with a graceful and ornamental tower. The house had fifteen rooms, an elegant reception and palatial reception and stair hall lighted by rich and rare art glass windows. The Lopez family anticipated occupancy within six months of construction startup.(The Biloxi Herald, May 5, 1901, p. 1)\n\nThe Laz Lopez family residence on West Howard Avenue was demolished by the Heath Construction Company in June 1920. It had been inherited by Noreta Lopez Rucks (1896-1960), his daughter, after the death of her mother, Julia Dulion Lopez (1857-1918), in June 1918. Noreta Julia Lopez (1896-1960) was born at Biloxi, Mississippi on July 31, 1896. She had married James Rucks Yerger II (1892-1931), called Rucks, who was born at Friars Point, Coahoma County, Mississippi. After the demolition was completed, the Rucks built a modern, one-story, brick building with a plate glass front on the former Lopez homestead. The Yerger Building had four rental spaces which were initially occupied by a haberdashery, grocery store, plumber, and dry goods merchant.(The Daily Herald, June 10, 1920, p. 6)\n\nNew L. Lopez & Company store building\n\nMr. Lopez was eager to erect a new mercantile and hardware store situated on the northeast corner of West Howard Avenue and Reynoir Street to replace his destroyed store and regain his market position in the thriving Biloxi economy. By mid-November 1900, the burned Lopez store lot was virtually cleared on the rubbish and debris created by the recent fire. In early January 1901, his Renaissance, architectural style, two-story, business house was one of the first buildings to rise in Biloxi’s badly burned commercial district. Barnes & Owens were contracted to erect the W.T. Harkness, designed structure. Theo Brune (1854-1932), well-known New Orleans architect, was hired to supervise construction of the 4500 square-foot structure to cost $10,000. The T.J. Rosell Company built the counters, shelves, and interior fixtures. The ceiling of both stories was made of steel. Hempstead & Williams were hired for the interior and exterior decorating. Mr. Lopez planned to vend fancy and staple groceries, hardware, shoes, ship chandelry from the first floor and lighter and bulky goods from the upper floor.(The Biloxi Herald, November 15, 1900, p. 8 and April 27, 1901, p. 8)\n\nThe new L. Lopez & Company building on Reynoir and Howard Avenue opened in late April. Theo P. Dulion (1861-1907) was the store manager.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, April 27, 1901, p. 8)\n\nLazaro’s demise\n\nLazaro Lopez expired in Rome, Italy on September 25, 1903 as the result of an acute inflammation of his kidneys and dysentery. He and Julia with four of their children, Erena Lopez, Rowena Lopez, Noreta Lopez and Master Julius Lopez, had departed Biloxi, Mississippi via the L&N Railroad for NYC where they boarded the for Europe.\n\nMr. Lopez had been ill at Biloxi before they left for Europe. A telegram from Rome reached Biloxi on September 19, 1903 notifying his family here that he was seriously sick.(The Biloxi Herald, September 19, 1903, p. 8)\n\nReturn to Biloxi\n\nOn October 1, 1903,Julia Lopez and her children sadly boarded the Deutchland, a steamer, disembarking from Cherbourg, France for New York without their beloved Lazaro. The body of Mr. Lopez was shipped several days later from France to Boston, Massachusetts aboard the Princess Irene. The Lopez family reached New York City and was met by Arnaud Lopez. The family left New York for Biloxi on October 7th without Julius Lopez who stayed behind with Arnaud, his older brother. Lazaro’s brother, Manuel Lopez, a Havana merchant, accompanied them to Biloxi. W.K.M. Dukate, a family friend and business associate, left Biloxi for New York City on October 8th to join Arnaud and Julius Lopez to escort Lazaro’s body home.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, October 1, 1903, p. 7, October 5, 1903, p. 8, October 8, 1903, p. 8, and October 9, 1903, p. 8)\n\nLazaro’s funeral\n\nThe corporal remains of Lazaro Lopez arrived at Biloxi by train in the morning of October 17, 1903. Biloxi began planning for Lazaro’s funeral on October 5th when Isidore Heidenheim (1852-1918), a prominent Biloxi seafood packer, called a meeting at the Firemen’s Hall. It was decided that Mr. Lopez’s funeral would be held on Monday October 20th at 10:00 a.m. in Nativity B.V.M. with father Alphonse Kettels holding a requiem high mass. All stores, banks, and other business houses were closed until after the funeral.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, October 6, 1903, p.1, October17, 1903, p. 1, October 19, 1903, p. 1\n\nLazaro Lopez’s body was escorted from the Lopez residence on West Howard Avenue to the Catholic church, a short distance, by Lazaro Lopez Jr., Arnaud Lopez, Julius Lopez, Manuel Lopez, Theo P. Dulion, and Arnaud M. Dulion. After the high mass, the large Lopez funeral cortege left the church and proceeded west on West Howard Avenue to Cuevas Street. Here it turned south to the Beach Road and then west again to the Biloxi Cemetery. The order of the Lopez funeral procession was as follows: Biloxi Public School children; members of the Oystermen’s Protective Association; Commercial Club members; Ladies of the Sacred Heart Society, United Daughters of the Confederacy, and King’s Daughters; carriages carrying floral offerings; carriage of Father Kettels and his assistants; the Hearse accompanied by the pall bearers, honorary pall bearers, twelve young ladies dressed in white from the West End School; and finally carriages of the Lopez family followed by many carriages transporting friends and acquaintances of Lazaro Lopez to his final resting place in the Biloxi cemetery.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, October 19, 1903, p.1)\n\nPall bearers\n\nActive pall bearers and honorary pall bearers selected for Mr. Lopez’s funeral read like a Who’s Who of Biloxi’s commercial and political community. Pall bearers were: Phil Wachenfeld; Joesph Arguelles; John Wentzell; Joseph Rusk; August ‘Gus’ Barthes; and D.M. McCarroll. The Lopez family selected as honorary pall bearers: W.K.M. Dukate; William F. Gorenflo Sr.; Captain John Walker; John C. Bradford; T.J. Rosell; William Buck; Florian Seal; George W. Young; Aristede Hopkins; George W. Grayson; John E. Morrison; and Walter A.

Roman Catholic Church\n\nLazaro Lopez and his family were congregants of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church, which was situated a few blocks west of their domicile on West Howard Avenue between Fayard Street and Caillavet Street. The Lopez children were baptized here and several were married in this sanctuary. Like most of the Lopez structures, Nativity B.V.M. was destroyed by the Great Fire of November 1900. Laz Lopez, W.K.M. Dukate, Ernest Desporte, Phil McCabe, Ed Glennan, and Louis Gill were the building committee responsible for erecting a new church. A contract was let in early February 1902 to J.F.

Dulion Mercantile Company. It was one hundred twenty-two feet by one hundred-forty feet and was bounded by Fayard Street on the west; Howard Avenue on the south; and Reynoir Street on the east. It was fenced and had one hundred twenty-five benches capable of seating eight people and two hundred-fifty chairs giving it a seating capacity of 1250 people. There was a stage and ‘picture machine box’, probably the projector. Harry Haise (1854-1954) did the carpentry work to erect the Airdome. The newly formed Daily Herald Band under the direction of Professor Joseph Dowling performed on opening day. Frederick P.

On June 14, 1900, she married Dr. Hyman McMaken Folkes (1871-1926) in the Nativity B.V.M. Catholic Church at Biloxi. Reverend Alphonse Ketels officiated. William Wachenfeld served as Dr. Folkes best man and Miss Lopez was attended by Erena Lopez, May Young, and Jennie Gillen. Miss Augusta Folkes (b. 1878), the sister of Dr. Folkes came from Jackson for the wedding.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, June 5, 1900, p. 8 and Harrison Co., Mississippi MRB 12, p. 321)\n\nHyman M. Folkes\n\nDr. H.M. Folkes was born on October 6, 1871 at Bovina, Warren County, Mississippi, the son of August Albert Folkes (1839-1904) and Anna E. Hilzheim (1850-1880+). August A. Folkes was a Civil War veteran having served with the 1st Mississippi Regiment Light Artillery. In 1877, the Folkes family settled at Jackson, Mississippi. Here, August A. Folkes managed a hotel before he became a lumber agent representing J.C. Redus and vending dressed and rough lumber and building materials such as, shingles, lathing, sash and doors. In late 1903, Captain A.A. Folkes became ill and was brought to Biloxi and put in the Biloxi Sanatorium under his son’s care. He died on January 2, 1904 at Biloxi and his corporal remains were sent to Jackson for internment. Mr. Folkes had been a vestryman at St. Andrew;s Episcopal Church in Jackson.(1880 Hinds Co., Mississippi federal Census T9-648, p. 13, ED 3, The Clarion Ledger, May 2, 1889, p. 6, The Biloxi Daily Herald, December 29, 1903, p. 6 and January 2, 1904, p. 8\n\nBefore Hyman M. Folkes became a medical man, he Dr. Folkes was a 1893 graduate of Tulane.\n\nShip Island-Cat Island Quarantine Station\n\nIn the spring of 1897, Dr. Hyman McMacken Folkes (1871-1926) came to Biloxi from Jackson, Mississippi to accept the post of Quarantine Officer at Ship Island. His initial appearance in the community left one with the impression that Dr. Folkes was a refined, social gentleman. At this time, there appears to be some transitioning of the location of the Quarantine Station. In late July 1896, the Quarantine Station was relocated to Cat Island and Dr. W.C. Brooke of Biloxi appointed to the post.(The Biloxi Herald, May 22, 1897, p. 8, July 25, 1896, p. 1)\n\nYellow Fever\n\nDr. Folkes earned the respect and admiration of Biloxians in the fall of 1897, when he was ordered from Cat Island to Biloxi by the State Board of Health to assist those struck down by yellow f1ever. His youth, experience with yellow fever patients in the tropics and stamina allowed Dr. Folkes to work long, hours and provide efficient and effective service to so many at Biloxi in constant demand of medical attention. In the fall of 1897, Dr. Folkes was sent to McHenry, Mississippi to work with the affirmed there as Dr. McHenry was ill. (The Biloxi Herald, October 30, 1897, p. 1)\n\nShip Island Tale\n\nIn July 1937, Captain L. Peter Eskald (1856-1944), a retired Danish immigrant and former Biloxi chandelier and boatman, related to a reporter forThe Daily Herald that when the Government sold all the armament and munitions on Ship Island to a Mr. Marks, a New Orleans junk dealer, he acquired in a trade from Mr. Marks the large Rodman gun at Fort Massachusetts for returning all of Marks’ tools and dynamite to the Crescent City. Knowing that Dr. Folkes was a collector of historic objects, Captain Eskald offered him the Rodman for $600. Dr. Folkes considered the price and subsequent removal and transfer to Biloxi very dear and passed on the Rodman. The Rodman remained at Fort Massachusetts and has become an integral part of the Civil War history of Ship Island.(The Daily Herald, July 8, 1937)\n\nBy 1899, he had opened an office in Biloxi on Pass Christian Road, now Howard Avenue, in the Eistetter Building and advertised as follows:\n\nDR. H.M. FOLKES\n\nOffice and rooms in Eistetter Building\n\nTelephone 38 Office Hours 11 to 1\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi\n\nAccounts due on the first of each month\n\n(The Biloxi Daily Herald, April 24, 1899, p. 8)\n\nChildren: Josephine Lopez Folkes (1901-1959) m. Albert Brown Russ (1888-1953) and Thomas Burns (1892-1974); Anna Odenal Folkes (1907-1968) m. Eugene Robert Kelly (1902-1990); and Dorothy Hilzheim Folkes (1912-1925).\n\nFolkes & Kennedy\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century and shortly thereafter, Biloxi was fortunate to have an adequate number of pharmacists and drug dispensaries. Among those in this industry were: The Opera Pharmacy of Joseph W. Swetman (1863-1937); William P. Kennedy (1873-1951); The Phoenix Pharmacy of J.B. Lemon (1862-1919); The of Herman Nill (1863-1904); Kimbrough & Pippen of Fenton H. Kimbrough (1874-1952) who later owned Kimbrough & Quints; and Jules A. D’Aquin (1877-1936).\n\nDr. H.M. Folkes first ventured in the drugstore business in May 1901 in a partnership with W.P. Kennedy. Their pharmacy was located in the new, two-story brick building of Lopez & Company on the southeast corner of West Howard Avenue and Reynoir Street. When Mr. Kennedy’s health became poor, he retired from his pharmacy and Dr. Folkes partnered with W.J. Grant.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, May 5, 1901, p. 1 and )\n\nFolkes & Grant\n\nThe Folkes & Grant ‘Century Drug Store’ was a retail drugstore instituted in the summer of 1901 by Dr. H.M. Folkes and W.J. Grant. In 1900, W.J. Grant was a resident of Pascagoula and employed as a drug clerk in that city. He came to Biloxi in 1900 to work in the pharmacy of W.P. Kennedy. Their joint venture in Biloxi was situated in the same space as the short-lived Folkes & Kennedy venture.\n\nIn late July 1901, a large engine and generator supplied by the Blakeslee Manufacturing Company of Birmingham, Alabama was installed in the rear of the Century Drugstore. This dynamo generated electricity for the lighting of the drugstore, the adjoining barbershop, and for the large Lopez & Company across the street. There was also sufficient current to operate electric fans in these venues.(1900 Jackson Co., Mississippi Federal Census T623_812, p. 6A, ED 40 and The Biloxi Daily Herald, July 19, 1901, p. 8, July 25, 1901, p. 8, July 28, 1901, p. 8)\n\n1903\n\n[see The Biloxi Daily Herald, October 3, 1903, p. 6)\n\nW.J. Grant\n\nWilliam Jesse Grant (1875-1932) was born at Pascagoula, Mississippi the son of Robert B. Grant (1852-1932) and Lydia S. Landridge (1852-1909). On April 16, 1902 at New Orleans, William J. Grant married Julia Elizabeth Baltar (1880-1968), the daughter of Jacinto F. Baltar (1834-1898) and Margaretha Gondolf (1840-1932). They were the parents of: Marguerite Baltar Grant (1904-1988) m. Henry Baldwin Curtis; William Jesse Grant II (1906-1976) m. Mary Griffin Dantzler (1905-1988); and Leslie Baltar Grant (1908-1986) m. Vera ‘Bede’ Leola Dukate Bond (1909-1989).\n\nGrant’s Drug Company\n\nWilliam J. Grant and Dr. Folkes parted ways about 1904 and this appears to be Dr. Folkes last pharmacy venture. W.J. Grant joined with Jules A. D’Aquin (1877-1936), a native of New Orleans and Tulane pharmacy graduate, to form Grant & D’Aquin. Mr. D’Aquin would leave Grant and join the staff of J.W. Swetman as a prescription clerk before acquiring the drugstore of J.B. Lemon in January 1910. D’Aquin’s drugstore was located on the southeast corner of Howard Avenue and Lameuse Street. In the spring of 1929, Grant’s opened in their new store adjacent to the Saenger Theatre. W.J. Grant was assisted in his pharmacy by his son, W.J. Grant Jr. (1906-1976).(The Daily Herald, January 14, 1910, p. 8 and The Jackson County Times, June 22, 1929, p. 3)\n\nAfter the demise of W.J. Grant, the family incorporated the business in October 1932. The incorporators of Grant’s Drug Company Incorporated were: Mrs. W.J. Grant, Mrs. Henry B. Curtis, W.J. grant Jr. and Leslie B. Grant. Grant’s remained on West Howard Avenue and Reynoir in the former Lopez-Yerger Building, which became the Barq’s Building in 1940??(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chattel Deed Bk. 52, p. 441)\n\nSeashoreAcademy\n\nThe Seashore Academy was a private school founded in June 1893 by Laz Lopez, F.W. Elmer, S. Picard, John Walker, E.J. Buck, H.T. Graves, E.W. Morrill, H. Otto, J.R. Harkness, George H. Dunbar, and F.B. Dunbar. This private educational institution was situated about 500 feet west of the Biloxi Lighthouse. It opened in September 1893 with Dr. George S. Roudebush (1829-1921), a Presbyterian minister, in charge.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chattel Deed Bk. 1, p. 6 and The Biloxi Herald, July 1, 1893, p. 8)\n\nBiloxi Sanatorium\n\nThe Biloxi Sanatorium was chartered in Mississippi in June 1902 by Dr. H.M. Folkes, Laz Lopez, W.K.M. Dukate, Harry T. Howard (1856-1930), Judge James H. Nevlle (1852-1919), and Dr. M. Lyle. Talbot (1874-1937). Its purpose was the treatment and care of the sick and disabled. The Biloxi Sanatorium proposed to have a department for marine patients as well as regular patients. The charter for the Biloxi Sanatorium was amended in January 1903 in order “to have the power and authority to open and maintain a school for training nurses and awarding diplomas.”(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chattel Deed Bk. 5, p. 73 and Bk. 419 and The Biloxi Herald, June 22,1902, p. 8)\n\nThe Biloxi Sanatorium was situated on the beach front site of the former Seashore Academy which had been instituted in June 1893 by Laz Lopez, F.W. Elmer, S. Picard, John Walker, E.J. Buck, H.T. Graves, E.W. Morrill, H. Otto, J.R. Harkness, George H. Dunbar, and F.B. Dunbar. This private educational institution was situated about 500 feet west of the Biloxi Lighthouse. It opened in September 1893 with Dr. George S. Roudebush (1829-1921), a Presbyterian minister, in charge.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chattel Deed Bk. 1, p. 6 and The Biloxi Herald, July 1, 1893, p. 8)\n\nMiss Mary H. Trigg\n\nMary H. Trigg (1874-1930+), who had worked in Manhattan as a nurse at the New York Hospital before 1900, came to the Biloxi Sanatorium from Greenville, Mississippi in November 1904. She was a Mississippi native and daughter of Wyndham Trigg (1834-pre- 1910), a lawyer, and Nannie S. Trigg (1837-1910+), natives of Virginia and Mississippi respectively. In 1906, Miss Trigg left Biloxi for the Greenville Sanatorium which she had acquired. Miss Trigg was a guest of the Dr. and Mrs. Folkes at Gunston Hall in late October 1922. By 1930, Miss Trigg was Superintendent of the King’s Daughters Hospital in Greenville.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, November 21, 1904, p. 5, The Daily Herald, October 31, 1922, p. 3 and 1900 New York, Co. New York Federal Census T623_111, p. 3A, ED 1066 and 1930 Washington Co., Mississippi Federal Census R 1156, p. 27A, ED 9)\n\nSusie Trigg (1870-1930+), a sister of Nurse Mary H. Trigg, taught school at Greenville, Mississippi for many years and was honored by having an elementary school named in her honor in that Delta city. Thomas K. Trigg (1878-1910+), her brother, worked for the Marine Hospital Service as a quarantine guard for trains entering and departing Biloxi was stricken with yellow fever in October 1905.(1910 and 1930 Washington Co., Mississippi T624_763, p. 13A, Ed 117 and R 1171, p. 3A, ED 8 and The Biloxi Herald, October 7, 1905, p. 4)\n\nFolkes & Talbot\n\nIn August 1902, Dr. M. Lyle Talbot (1874-1937), the brother of Dr. William O. Talbot (1873-1952), a Biloxi dentist and politician, joined with Dr. H.M. Folkes to form a co-partnership. Dr. M.L. Talbot was born in Scott County, Mississippi in September 1873 to Green W. Talbot (1848-1900+), a farmer, and Fannie Talbot (1852-1903), both natives of Alabama. In 1900, Dr. Talbot was stationed at Ship Island, probably as the Quarantine Officer. Peter Clarisse (1845-1932) was the lighthouse keeper on Ship Island at this time. (The Biloxi Herald, February 20, 1903, p. 6, 1900 Harrison Co., Mississippi Federal Census T623_808, p. 10A, ED 29 and 1880 Scott Co., Mississippi Federal Census T9_663, p. 15, Beat 4)\n\nPavilion\n\nJohn Liddie, designer and builder, was hired by the Biloxi Sanatarium to erect a three-decked pavilion at the end of their pier. The upper story had a glass enclosed room that was conducive for patients to sun bathe out of the elements. The second floor featured lounge chairs and hammocks, while the pier level was conducive for children to crab and fish. The pavilion was built with creosoted pilings and iron bars.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, September 18,1903, p. 6)\n\nBiloxi Marine Hospital\n\nDr. Folkes advertised in the Biloxi Daily Herald that he contacted to take vessels and that surgery was his specialty.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, April 9, 1903, p. 6)\n\nThe April 1904 conflagration\n\nThe Biloxi Sanatarium of Dr. Hyman M.

The Laz Lopez medical and surgical clinic for the poor would be maintained here.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, November 17, 1904, p. 5)\n\nGunston Hall\n\nJulia Dulion Lopez (1857-1918) died at Biloxi, Mississippi on June 30, 1918. Before her demise, she had appointed Erena Lopez Brady, as executrix, of her estate without bonding. Her bequests to Teresa Lopez Folkes was the Rodenberg Survey lot. In February 1906, Julia Dulion Lopez had acquired for $3250 from the Heirs of John Henry Rodenberg, a large lot, 142 feet in width and 600 feet deep, measured from the southeast corner of in Lot 1-Block 1 of the Maunsel White Survey.

In addition, a 45-foot road was to be left open on the west side of the tract and a 50-foot wide street to be left open on the north end of the lot.(Harrison Co., Mississippi Chancery Court Land Deed Bk.71 or 73, p. 373 and Harrison Co. , Mississippi Chancery Court Cause No. 1663, “The Estate of Julia Dulion Lopez”-1918 )\n\nAs early as September 1919, the Folkes were planning a home for the Rodenberg Lot. At this time, H.H. Roof, local architect, was making architectural drawings for their structure on the corner of West Beach and Rodenberg Avenue.(The Daily Herald, September 19, 1919, p. 2 and\n\nWest Beach lot\n\nIn January 1905, Octavie Tricou Weysham (1835-1910) conveyed to Teresa Lopez Folkes a large tract of land on West Beach. The consideration was $4000 and the Weysham parcel had a front of 100 feet on the Gulf and ran north to Pass Christian Road.

Harrison (1831-1905), local agent, and the father of Charles T. Harrison (1863-1948), who would develop a 20th Century real estate empire in Biloxi. The Weysham place had been on the market for several years and had two houses situated on it.(The Biloxi Daily Herald, October 21, 1902, p. 3 and December 10, 1904, p. 4)\n\nMrs. Octavie T.
