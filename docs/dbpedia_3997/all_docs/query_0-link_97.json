The Kendallville News-Sun of October 4th (1915), published the following account of the death of Mrs. Sarah A. Gilbert Ford, who at one time lived in Mankato in the early days during the Indian massacre, and will no doubt be remembered by some of our early settlers: \"Sarah A. Gilbert Ford was born in Adams County, Pennsylvania, September 25, 1830. She was the daughter of Jacob and Frances Gilbert. When quite young she moved with her parents to Portage County, Ohio and later they went to Wood County, Ohio. In 1849 she was married to John V. Ford in Seneca County, Ohio. After two (sic) years they moved to Iowa and made the trip in a two-horse wagon. Exposure on this journey caused a long spell of sickness for the husband and after braving the rigors of the far western frontier for two years, they returned to Bettsville, Ohio. In 1858 they again went west and this time settled in Mankato, Minn. Here they were surrounded by Sioux Indians who were frequently hostile and caused the white settlers great anxiety and much trouble. Sister Ford was the mother of five children - four boys and one girl. The family remained unbroken until 1880, when diphtheria invaded the home and death claimed the two youngest children in a single day. The same messenger made similar claims in 90, 96, and 99, when the last son was taken and she was left childless. In 1900 her husband was stricken with paralysis and after a lingering illness of more than two years, died. In 1904, after forty years of comfortable and prosperous home life in the city of her adoption and after laying to rest all of her immediate family, she came to Kendallville and from that time made her home with her brother, George W. Gilbert. When a girl of sixteen she became identified with the Methodist Episcopal church and for sixty-one years was a member of the same. In a little biography which she wrote of herself on New Year's Day of this year, she says: I am now in my eighty-fifth year. When I was sixteen I became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which I remain yet. My life was not the happiest; but I always found a friend in Jesus - one who was ready to lend a helping hand in all my troubles. For some months she was in failing health incident to old age and other complications. She offered a good deal and gradually sank until a little before twelve oclock last Tuesday night. While she quietly slept, her soul went home. She was aged eighty-five years and three days. Three members of her childhood home survive her - George W., and W. C. Gilbert of this city, and D. M. Gilbert of Chicago.\" Mankato Review (Mankato, Minnesota), October 8, 1915, page 4, column 4.
