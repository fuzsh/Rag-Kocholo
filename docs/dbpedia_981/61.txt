Hark! Hark! Glad tidings charm our ears is a setting of words from a Southern Harmony hymn combined with verses from a metrical version of the Benedicite, with a refrain ‘Our God is born’. It is a joyous, dancing piece, easy to learn and effective in performance.

Stephen Patterson (Church Music Quarterly)

Hark! Hark! Glad Tidings Charm Our Ears [is] a Christmas piece in which the composer sets a pleasing mash-up of an early American hymn with the Benedicite. It’s very jolly, with sparkling trumpety organ passages and fun dialogue between choir and accompaniment. Its energetic 6-8 dances everyone along and listeners will be beguiled and impressed without realising that it’s easier than it sounds.
