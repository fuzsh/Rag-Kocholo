Hello, folks.

What would be the best or quite closer synonym for to give glad tidings ?

The context, if needed:

A farmer's son run to his dad telling him:" Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf"

Father:" May God give you glad tidings "

Thanks for all

Where did you see or hear this conversation?

'Glad tidings' means 'good news', which doesn't make much sense in this context.

Pretty much the only place I've ever heard 'glad tidings' is in the Christmas carol 'While Shepherds Watch:

[ . . . ]

Glad tidings of great joy I bring

To you and all mankind.

What would be the best or quite closer synonym for to give glad tidings ?

"Glad tidings" is archaic English (no longer used) for "good news".

So "to give someone glad tidings" means "to tell someone good news".

A farmer's son run to his dad telling him:" Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf"

Father:" May God give you glad tidings "

This is incorrect. Where did you see this? What is your source?

As has been said, it means "good news. Therefore your story would be as follows:

A farmer's son runs to his dad telling him:" Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf" (This is good tidings/good news)

Father:" May God give you good news." (This doesn't make sense. The son has already given good news to his father)

"May God give you X" is a wish for the future. It does not relate to things that have already happened.

[The scene is England 400 years ago, a messenger is brought before the King]

King: "What tidings of Lancaster bringest thou?" Modern English = What news have you got about the Duke of Lancaster?

Messenger "I bring glad tidings - The French are at his hands defeated" Modern English = "I have good news, he has beaten the French."

Chasint. In the Arabic text, the father's response is:" May God please/give you glad tidings/good news".

PaulQ. The son came telling his father immediately :" Our cow has just given birth to a calf". That is why is has father responded " May God ..."though I do know this sounds strange to you.

Again, thanks for all

It may be a cultural difference.

Could you explain in a longer paragraph, what the father is asking God to do? The good news has already been given - there is a new calf. Do they want God to provide even more good news? It doesn't make sense in English.

This is idiomatically said in Arabic. It might be the verb tense or mood that throws you off

May God give you good news

I beseech God to bless you with

{...}

I beseech God to bless you with

That's what I'm asking. "I beseech God to bless you with ... what?" Some more good news that is different from the news you have just given me?

Or is it just a general wish that God will continue to bring good news?

Exactly so, Chasint

So, the final answer is this

Father's response" God will give you good news" or still is clumsy?

I think I've got it now. It means that God has brought good news by allowing the successful birth of a calf and the father is asking God always to bring good news. In doing so he acknowledges that God is the source of all good news.

My version (correct me if I'm wrong)

A farmer's son runs to his dad telling him:" Good news Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf!"

Father:" May God always give you good news my son."

Does that look right?
