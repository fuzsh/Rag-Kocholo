        "text": "It’s December 1997.\n\nI find myself sitting in a Christmas Grotto at the most expensive end of Oxford Street wearing a very famous red and white suit. It’s my first time but there are no nerves. I have worked in children’s entertainment for over a decade. So how hard can this be? I make myself comfortable, straighten my spectacles, tidy my beard, check my moustache, adjust my tummy and prepare for certain glory. I hear the sound of excited little footsteps approaching outside. There is a bit of animated chit-chat on the other side of the door … and then it slowly opens. In a joyous flash, a little boy, about six years-old, runs into the Grotto. It’s showtime! I expect my young visitor to say something. But he doesn’t. Instead, a quite amazing thing happens. Rather than smiling, saying hello, shaking my hand or running over to give me a hug, he stops in his tracks and gasps. His jaw drops to the floor. He freezes. He looks at me with eyes so wide that I think they might burst. I can see that he isn’t frightened. No this is something entirely new to me. The little boy is in total awe … and, at that moment, I realise something huge:\n\nI am Father Christmas.\n\nTwenty years on, I am still occasionally Father Christmas. What’s more, I spend a lot of time training other people to do the same at The Ministry of Fun Santa School.\n\nThere is still a pretty common perception within the acting world that being Santa is something one reluctantly does at Christmas in the absence of a proper theatre job. Actors of a certain age tend to look down on the role in the same way that younger performers might look down at leafleting work. Working as Father Christmas is perceived by many professionals as bargain basement stuff. It’s not as hi-profile as pantomime. It’s certainly not as lauded as Shakespeare. It’s generally treated as something you quietly do in November and December to pay the bills. The attitude of many is that you’re not in a ‘proper theatre’ so you shouldn’t take it that seriously, should you?\n\nWell actually yes, you should.\n\nFrom a purely dramatic perspective, it is hard to think of any role that puts you so close to your audience. What other acting part requires you to sit in a chair just a few feet away from a spellbound congregation of one? Where else would you be placed under such intense and intimate scrutiny? As Santa, a performer is required to improvise with complete authority whilst at the same time remaining fully in character. I challenge you to name a part that requires an artist to so convincingly be a real person - and not just any real person: Father Christmas, one of the most famous real persons in the history of entertainment EVER – and simultaneously create magic for everyone he meets.\n\nThere is more than a slender argument to suggest that being Father Christmas is a challenging job, even for the most experienced professional.\n\nSo smitten was I by this challenge that, in 1998 - a year after I made my own grotto debut - I created a Santa School. The primary purpose was to ensure that my fledgling entertainment company provided the most magical Father Christmases anywhere on the planet. But, based on my own experiences, I also wanted to make performers understand that being a good Santa requires a bit of thought … and I wanted to demonstrate that anyone wearing the suit has a responsibility to do it brilliantly.\n\nAt this point I feel an overpowering need to remind you that the Real Santa does exist. I’m only helping him out on those very, very rare occasions that he cannot be in two places at once. This is really important.\n\nSo …\n\nThe Ministry of Fun Santa School covers all aspects of being Father Christmas and every year we teach students of different ages, shapes and backgrounds how to recreate the magic of the Real Santa in every way. It is a rehearsal for the role of a lifetime and training usually begins with the question: Who is Santa Claus?\n\nSt Nicholas is actually one of the most popular saints in Christendom. His varied areas of saintly responsibility include Russia, parish clerks, scholars, pawnbrokers, children and Aberdeen. Whilst his story has no political significance or historical importance, at its heart there is a universal message of kindness. He has, over thousands of years, made an epic journey from his birthplace in Asia Minor in AD280 to the North Pole of the 21st Century. His tale tells us of how one good man’s deeds have inspired a global spirit of giving every Christmas time.\n\nBut still, despite this lofty introduction, a very common belief lingers: that being Santa is simply a matter of putting on a costume and beard, saying a half-decent “Ho Ho Ho!” and asking children what they want for Christmas.\n\nAlready we’re in trouble here.\n\nRemember: most of the children who Santa meets have written him a letter, So, by asking the question “What do you want for Christmas?”, you are basically telling a child that you haven’t read their letter. And that is unforgivable. If you’re the Real Santa - and, to a child, you most definitely are - then you have not only RECEIVED the letter, but you have READ the letter. In fact it’s the BEST letter you have ever read!\n\nYou also need to look good. Keeping up appearances is vital to portraying the Great Man. Father Christmas is an immaculate dresser. Anyone looking remotely shoddy in a Santa suit should be rounded-up and locked-away till January. Santa wears a dazzling red costume with clean white fur trim and a fluffy white beard (optimum length by the way is around 7.5 inches - and, for those that don’t have their own natural bristles, ours cost about £1,000 each). Santa needs a good tummy - natural or padded - and a quality pair of heavy boots (plastic boot covers worn over shoes are an absolute aberration). His belt buckle is always in line with the buttons down the front of his tunic. Santa should always wear a clean pair of white gloves with his half-moon glasses perched on the end of his nose. Watches (and tattoos!) must be out of sight. Finally, he maintains a very high level of personal hygiene at all times with his breath minty and fresh.\n\nBut no amount of costume, beard or fake tummy will fool a child of your authenticity - character is everything! A child wants truth and you have to be able to deliver it.\n\nIn conversation, anyone portraying Santa should be fully prepared to discuss - often in great in detail - essential matters such as the existence (or not) of a child’s chimney, the names of the reindeer (there are nine) and the location at which to leave the presents in each home.\n\nAs patron Saint of children all over the world, Santa should be able to say Merry Christmas in lots of languages and he should know what toys are going to popular this year (remember: his elves make them ALL).\n\nChildren are like sticks of festive dynamite ready to pulverise Santa’s cover at any moment. Funny and unexpected things are always going to happen. Beards occasionally get lunged-at. Moustaches come loose. You must nevertheless remain calm and in control at all times.\n\nDesperate grown-ups go white with terror if their child asks for something unfeasibly-expensive (or worse: a puppy). It is therefore important to never promise anything - at the same time warmly communicating reassurances that, whatever you do bring on Christmas Eve, it will be something wonderful, brought with all the love in the world. Interestingly, there is also a slightly sadistic breed of grown-up that gets a perverse pleasure from watching Santa try to answer tricky questions such as: “Are you the Real Santa?” … “What’s my address?” … “Do remember my dog’s name?”\n\nDon’t expect any help here - you’re on your own.\n\nAnd then there are genuinely sad moments, such as when a child touches your heart by asking “Can you bring my Daddy back home?” or “Can you make my little brother get better?” These requests are heart-breaking; but, no matter what, you have to keep things as positive as possible. You must reassure any child with troubles or worries that you are FATHER CHRISTMAS and you are going to do your very best to make sure that he or she has a happy time at Christmas this year.\n\nFather Christmas really does need to be ready for anything.\n\nSince that morning on Oxford Street 21-Decembers ago, I have trained 817 Santa performers and introduced them to many thousands of children. I am still wondering at the magic of it all. I am still pouring my heart and all my extraordinary experiences into Santa School. I am still looking to create the required levels of magic and fun for all who encounter the Great Man. The experience of meeting Father Christmas is something that all children should remember fondly for the rest of their lives. It simply has to be brilliant.\n\nBeing Father Christmas is a joy. It presents many unique and unexpected acting challenges but, if you do it well, then you will enrich many childhoods. Everyone deserves a little bit of magic in their lives. That’s what Santa delivers … and, when you’re wearing the red and white suit, it’s YOU that’s doing the delivering.\n\nIt really is the best job in the world."
