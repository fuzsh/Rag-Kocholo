        "text": "The 2010 Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas Concert beat all records for ticket requests, and crowds. Adorning fans queued up to the Conference Center hours beforehand hoping for standby seating. The excitement and energy of the crowd was truly epic.\n\nSinger David Archuleta made history as the youngest guest artist to ever grace the Conference Center Christmas stage. At his young age, Archuleta had already faced tremendous personal challenges both in his family life with the pending divorce of his parents, and the harsh artistic spotlight as a finalist on the popular TV talent competition ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô. To be headlining 4 major concerts performed to a 21,000+ audience daily, plus knowing it was being filming for later release as a PBS Television Special to be broadcast to over 4 million, the pressure and expectations must have been especially intense for the 18-year-old idol (his 19th birthday still 2 weeks away). Despite it all, David charmed the audience with his radiant smile, solid vocals and genuine sweetness. [I honestly don‚Äôt think the Conference Center has ever had a more enthusiastic throng].\n\n2010 David Archuleta Highlights from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas Concert\n\nJoining ‚Äúthe voice‚Äù was veteran actor of stage and screen Sir Michael York as our Narrator. I have to admit, I‚Äôve personally harbored a crush on York since I was 10 years old. One of my favorite movies growing up was the sci-fi dystopian Logan‚Äôs Run. Hey, don‚Äôt laugh. The special effects were very cool for it‚Äôs day (it was also the first time to use Dolby Sound), and the entire film totally captured my young imagination. Of course, York‚Äôs 50-year distinguished career includes being an Emmy-winning Broadway performer, recording over 100 audio books, a highly sought-after Shakespearean actor, an acclaimed regular on BBC, and knighted by the Queen. (But, I‚Äôll always think of him as Logan-5) York is also admired for his enduring romance with his wife Pat. they celebrated 45 years of marriage this year. Pat joined Sir York in Salt Lake City during our concert week.\n\nGetting the chance to perform on the same stage of this great actor and loyal husband was as much a thrill for me as I‚Äôm sure seeing & hearing heart-throb Archuleta was for the majority of our audience. üôÇ\n\nDuring his performance week, Michael York was waging a battle with a rare and mysterious disorder that was affecting his eyesight (which required him to wear tinted lenses), and altering his iconic mellow voice. One can only imagine how distressed he was! Originally thought to be a form of cancer and then several other medical anomalies, his condition was finally diagnosed in 2013 and treated at Mayo Clinic as the rare and potentially fatal condition of Amyloidosis.\n\nThe Special Music and the Spoken Word Broadcast entitled ‚ÄúSing Choir‚Äôs of Angels‚Äù aired Sunday December 19th, 2010 featuring Michael York‚Äôs Narration from the 2010 Christmas Concert, which tells the story of Welsh pioneer John Perry, and the origin of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\nSing Choir of Angels ‚Äì Music and the Spoken Word ‚Äì December 19, 2010 with Michael York\n\nIf you‚Äôve been following my series of Christmas Concert recaps, then you may be recognizing a pattern. Each one of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir special guest artists have arrived with unique challenges and trials they are personally enduring ‚Äì and yet each one of them have risen above their challenges, giving 100% of their talents to provide inspirational performances that literally bless millions for generations to come. How inspiring they all are! In 2010, we were blessed to have David Archuleta, and Michael York! ‚Äì MoSop\n\nWANT MORE?\n\nWATCH: Mormon Newsroom 2010 Christmas Concert Spotlight\n\nGET A COPY: ‚ÄúGlad Tidings of Christmas‚Äù Live Performance on CD or DVD\n\nRelated articles"
