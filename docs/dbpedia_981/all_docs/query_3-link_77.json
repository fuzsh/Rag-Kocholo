        "text": "Editor's note: The community was devastated as news quickly spread from Massillon to the rest of the world when fire ravaged the St. Dymphna Shrine and baptistery area, and smoke left soot throughout St. Mary Catholic Church on Aug. 4, 2015.\n\nParishioners feared they had lost their beloved church — a historic structure and local landmark at 206 Cherry Road NE.\n\nThe cause of the fire was never determined. Restoring the church became an enormous undertaking.\n\nThe new year — 2016 — brought renewed hope that the task was not impossible, and work began in January. Crews cleaned, fixed and rebuilt as needed. Subcontractors were still in the church this week putting on the finishing touches.\n\nAnd through it all, the community pulled together.\n\nSt. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church became the temporary new home for St. Mary's church members who went across the street for weekly Mass, as well as funerals, weddings and other sacraments. St. Paul's also hosted the music and candlelighting ceremonies last month for the Community Candlelight Walk.\n\nOn Saturday, St. Mary once again opens its doors, just in time for Christmas Eve Mass.\n\nThe Independent has followed the story from the start, capturing the news in photos and reporting on the progress.\n\nMASSILLON \"When is St. Mary going to reopen?\"\n\nFor more than a year, residents, church members, those who grew up here but have since moved, and anyone who walks or drives past one of the most impressive structures in the city have asked that question.\n\nHere's the answer: Today.\n\nAnd the Rev. Ed Gretchko, parishioners, and others close to the church are excited about it. They have every reason to be.\n\n\"There will be great gladness,\" Gretchko said.\n\nGretchko expects folks will react with emotion as they open the new wooden doors for the first time, walk into the expanded vestibule, and view the cleaner brighter nave, or body, of the church. Some might cry, but they will be \"tears of gladness,\" he said.\n\nAfter all, it's been a long time coming since the Aug. 4, 2015 fire left St. Mary's parishioners without a church. Gretchko said he is thankful to St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church across the street for allowing St. Mary's members to have their church services there. Children at the parish school have had most of their Wednesday morning Masses in the school's gymnasium.\n\nFor nearly a year, Coon Restoration & Sealants of Louisville, Abbott Electric, Studio Arts and Glass, SE Johnson Painting, Kauffman Plumbing, Performance Concrete Solutions and numerous other subcontractors have worked tirelessly cleaning, rebuilding and restoring the beloved 140-year-old structure.\n\nIt was a massive project. The entire interior of the church was covered in black soot from smoke. The pews had to be taken out and the organ removed to be cleaned. Now the pews with new cushions and kneelers have returned, and the organ has been reinstalled. Every corner of the church has a story, Gretchko said. Among highlights are stained-glass windows that were able to be used from the St. Dymphna shrine at the old Massillon State Hospital. As well as other glass that had recently been discovered hidden between walls in the church.\n\n\"The shrine is as important as the church,\" said Paula Gretchko, the priest's sister and a longtime sacristan.\n\nAfter this weekend, other special days this year also are expected to draw a crowd. On May 15, which is the feast day of St. Dymphna, many people are expected to visit St. Mary, Paula Gretchko said. A tour bus is expected to arrive along with a priest to honor the patron saint of those suffering from nervous diseases and mental and emotional disorders.\n\nWorkers were still in the church this week finishing up the last details before St. Mary's reopens for its first services in more than a year.\n\nDon Zwick of Zwick's Painting and Drywall in North Canton was among workers trying to get things ready for today's service. He spent 24-hour stretches, at times, working on arches throughout the church, he said.\n\nGretchko is anticipating a full house at each of the five masses this weekend. The church holds 800 people.\n\nThe rededication of the church will be at the 10:30 a.m. Mass on Jan. 1. Bishop George V. Murry as well as priests such as Monsignor James R. Kolp, a former pastor at St. Mary Catholic Church, are expected to participate in the Mass.\n\n\"It's such a beautiful church,\" Kolp said.\n\nJust in time for Christmas.\n\nReach Christina at 330-775-1133 or christina.mccune@indeonline.com.\n\nOn Twitter: @cmccuneINDE\n\nWho: St. Mary Catholic Church\n\nWhere: 206 Cherry Road NE, Massillon\n\nWhat: Christmas Masses this weekend\n\nWhen: 5 p.m. today with contemporary music; 7 p.m. today with choir; 10 p.m. today with organ music; 8 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. Sunday for Christmas Day Masses\n\nWhat else: Rededication will be at 10:30 a.m. Jan. 1."
