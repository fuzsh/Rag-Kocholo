        "text": "Product Description\n\nGlad Tidings! is a ready-to-go resource perfect for schools and churches comprising of narration, readings, poems and seven beautifully-arranged carols.\n\nWith new arrangements of O Little Town Of Bethlehem, Ding Dong Merrily On High, The First Noel, We Three Kings and Hark The Herald Angels Sing, two brand new carols, pre-chosen readings, a beautifully written narration, two charming new poems and guidance on staging and resourcing, this really is a complete carol service.\n\nThe carol service is a much-loved and important tradition within the Christian calendar, and on the face of it appears pretty straightforward to put together: choose some carols, select some readings, and youâ€™re done. However, those people within schools and churches who have been given the responsibility for the carol service know that this could not be further from the truth. Which carols? What sequence? How many verses? Which verses? Which musical arrangement? How do you get the arrangement? Which readings? Biblical or other? Where do you get them? What links everything together? What is the tone of the service? What is the purpose of the service?\n\nA carol service is surprisingly time-consuming to organise and time is a luxury that most teachers simply do not have. We hope, therefore, with this book that we can make the job a little simpler by providing you with a ready-to-go, all-inclusive version.\n\nWe have also included plenty of guidance on staging and suggestions on how to adapt should you wish to lengthen or shorten the service to fit your needs.\n\nSuitable for ages 7 to 11, this complete carol service has speaking roles for 16+ people and a cast size of between 20-100 (ideal cast size 35).\n\nThe Director's Book contains everything you need to put on a successful concert including the Director's Book with narration, readings, poems, lyrics, piano/vocal scores and performance licence application form. The accompanying CD contains full vocal demonstrations of the songs for the children to learn and separate instrumental backing tracks for performance use (no pianist required!)."
