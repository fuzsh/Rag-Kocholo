        "text": "Things are going to be different this holiday, no question. But different doesn’t have to mean worse; in fact, you might find yourself having the best Christmas in memory. How? By returning to what the holidays were always supposed to be about: kindness, love, good works, stillness, patience, giving. And there are still plenty of options that will allow you to have a little fun while keeping your family safe this season. Here, we list some of our favorite suggestions for holiday fun – and some great options for ways that you can safely give back to community, in a year when everyone could use a little holiday spirit.\n\nCelebrate the Season\n\nWe see this year as a chance to create new traditions, to think creatively, and to remember what matters most. Whether you’re strolling through the wonderland of lights at the Amarillo Botanical Gardens or watching balloons light up the night sky in the canyon, this year, let’s all remember to look for the light that shines within us.\n\nAmarillo Botanical Gardens\n\nIf you’re looking for traditional fun this holiday season, look no further than the Amarillo Botanical Gardens. The elegant site will host its annual Christmas in the Gardens, which features more than 350,000 Christmas Lights, through Dec. 20, 6-8:30 p.m. (9 p.m. on Saturdays). Marvel at the lights and the beauty of nature, as you sip on hot chocolate, munch popcorn and cotton candy, and get your picture taken with Santa. 1400 Streit Drive, 352.6513, amarillobotanicalgardens.org\n\nALT Academy\n\nThe Amarillo Little Theatre Academy and Sparkman Orthodontics will present a holiday production of “It’s a Wonderful Life,” based on Frank Capra’s classic film. The show will feature 25 talented Academy students, onstage Dec. 11-13. Director Jason Crespin says of the production, “With everything our world has gone through this past year, this show is a great reminder that with the help of friends and family, we all still have a wonderful life to live. I’m proud that we’ll be able to still provide theater safely to our community through our COVID safety protocols, and I hope our patrons understand how important it is to support the arts now more than ever.” Performances will take place at the ALT Adventure Space, 2751 Civic Circle, and all audience members will be required to wear face coverings while at the theater and during the performance. In addition, patrons will be tested for fever with a no-touch forehead thermometer, and hand sanitizer will be placed throughout the theater. For tickets and information, visit amarillolittletheatre.org or call the ALT Box Office, 355.9991.\n\nALT Main Stage\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun family musical, the “Winter Wonderettes” are here for you! This year’s show has the Wonderettes entertaining at the annual Harper’s Hardware Holiday Party – until Santa turns up missing. Using their talent and ingenuity, the girls set out to save the holiday party. The show will feature sixties versions of holiday classics such as “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town,” “Jingle Bell Rock,” “Run, Rudolph, Run,” and “Winter Wonderland.” Numerous protocols are in place to keep patrons safe; mainstage visitors will enter through assigned doors based on their seat number. Upon entering the building, theatergoers will be tested for fever with a no-touch forehead thermometer. The show will run through Dec. 20. For tickets and information, visit amarillolittletheatre.org or call the ALT Box Office, 355.9991.\n\nMaxwell’s Pumpkin Farm\n\nSince 2007, Maxwell’s Pumpkin Farm has been known as THE place to be when the leaves start to change. This year, given the unique nature of this holiday season, Maxwell’s will host winter festivities as well. Santa will make a grand entrance every day that the farm is open, at 6 p.m. The farm will feature a trail of lights, Christmas movies, and more than 20 attractions, including giant slides, pedal carts, snacks and paintball. Open Dec. 13-23, 5-9 p.m. 12908 Bell St., 373.9600, maxwellspumpkinfarm.com/christmas\n\nStarlight Canyon\n\nThis stunning outdoor event area, tucked away near Timbercreek, provides a delightful and safe holiday setting. Owner Nate Green says Starlight will be hosting “Build an Ornament and Have a Cookie with Santa” on Dec. 19, from 3-6 p.m. The event will feature live Christmas music and a holiday marketplace. 100 Brentwood Road, 622.2382, starlightcanyon.com\n\nWest Texas A&M University\n\nThe orchestra and university choirs are rehearsing pieces for the annual University Christmas concert. The show will be pre-recorded for a broadcast in December on Panhandle PBS (broadcast time TBA).\n\nLend a Helping Hand\n\nThis year offers an opportunity for our community to return to a Christmas spirit of giving, loving and volunteering. To that end, we’ve compiled a list of opportunities for Amarilloans of all ages to give back, so that we can all get through this crisis together – and come out on the other side stronger than ever.\n\nAmarillo Candle Company\n\nThis family-owned and -operated popular local business is undertaking a giving tree this year, to benefit The Pearl Longbine Emergency Youth Shelter – a local shelter for children who are in between foster homes. Every person that participates in the giving tree (by bringing a gift and ensuring that a child won’t be forgotten this holiday) will be entered into a drawing for a $100 gift card to the Candle Company shop, 2300 SW Sixth Ave., between Georgia and Washington. Hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m..\n\nAmarillo Housing First\n\nSince the beginning of this year, Amarillo Housing First has assisted dozens of formerly homeless households in signing permanent leases for housing. Currently, AHF is helping to keep 42 households safe, warm and housed. The organization is always seeking volunteers – to help in the office or to aid in its furniture program, helping to furnish the homes of clients. AHF also administrates a “Code Blue” warming station – along with more than a dozen other local organizations – ensuring that Amarillo’s homeless have a warm place to go when the weather turns bad. Volunteers are needed to help with the warming station, along with donations of warming supplies, coffee, snacks and pantry items. And of course, financial help is always needed. Donations can be delivered to AHF at 207 N. Tyler St., weekdays between 9 a.m. and\n\n4 p.m. Call 414.2243 or visit amarillohousingfirst.org for more information, or contact AHF on Facebook.\n\nBlue Santa\n\nStand 4 LEOs, an organization dedicated to improving community relations between police officers and citizens, will host its third Blue Santa drive this year. The group has selected several families to help directly this Christmas; in addition, the organization needs cold weather gear (gloves, hats) for children it encounters on delivery day. Donation areas for the miscellaneous toy and cold weather gear drop-off can be found at: Amarillo Police Department (200 SE Third Ave.), Lovett Chiropractic, (2230 Paramount Blvd.), and the Potter County Sheriff’s Office (608 S. Pierce St.). Delivery day is Dec. 16 at 1 p.m.\n\nADVO\n\nADVO provides a variety of services for a community of 150 individuals in Amarillo, including offering 22 group homes in the Amarillo area. The organization also offers vocational training and workshops, teaching Amarilloans real skills to help them move forward in life. ADVO has Giving Trees set up in three local businesses, in order to ensure their clients have the best Christmas possible. The trees contain cards listing items clients need to help make day-to-day living possible. Giving trees for ADVO are located in Raffkind’s (now in its sixth year of partnering with ADVO), Wyn’s Boutique and Texas Trio.\n\nCatholic Charities of the Texas Panhandle\n\nFounded in 1932 by Bishop Rudolph A. Gerken, the first Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Amarillo, Catholic Charities has grown into a powerhouse of caring and giving. This year alone, the organization has helped to feed more than 7,000 Panhandle residents. Since the start of the pandemic, Catholic Charities has been helping supply low-income and struggling families with groceries. Financial resources are always needed, and they’re always looking for volunteers for the Hunger Project, Bags of Hope, ESL and other programs. To learn more, call 376.4571 or visit cctxp.org.\n\nEveline Rivers Christmas Project\n\nSince its inception in 1979, the Eveline Rivers Christmas Project has grown from serving 43 children in 1979 to providing more than 6,300 children and adolescents with Christmas gifts and more than 2,300 children with warm coats each year. During the Christmas season, the Eveline Rivers Christmas Project places more than 14,000 books into homes where books are considered a luxury. And, through the work of the Eveline Rivers Christmas Project, children wake up on Christmas morning with a special gift just for them. It’s important work – and it wouldn’t be possible without volunteers. Each year, members of the Amarillo community join in to ensure that each child is guaranteed a warm and welcome winter holiday. In addition, monetary donations are always needed. This year’s “delivery day” will be Dec. 14. To help out, visit evelineriversproject.org or call 372.3985.\n\nFaith City Mission\n\nThe tireless homeless shelter staff will be hosting their annual Christmas Outreach for those in the community this year, featuring a guest speaker, a candlelight Christmas service, and a hot holiday meal. Historically, Faith City has served more than 300 guests and about 100 volunteers each Christmas – all due to generous donations. In addition, the Mission will give out new winter items to all guests, including coats, thermals, gloves, socks, scarves, backpacks, and hygiene bags. Donor Relations Coordinator Maddie Gatlin says Faith City “gratefully accepts” volunteers for Christmas Outreach. Volunteers will have the opportunity to greet and host, help serve the Christmas meal to guests in the dining room, and serve in the winter outreach giveaway. “We’ve been so overwhelmed by the support of the community over the years,” says Gatlin, “and the people who have gathered from near and far to be a part of this event. For all volunteer inquiries, call 373.6402 or visit faithcity.org.\n\nFamily Support Services\n\nFSS has long been a source of hope on the High Plains, performing a stunning array of services to a wide range of groups and individuals in need – from counseling services to veteran resources to running a safe house for those in need of protection from domestic abuse. Brandi Reed, Director of Education at Family Support Services, says, “Our biggest request this year is for people to adopt a family to help in areas such as gifts and a holiday meal. We’ll be organizing some holiday drive thru/pick-up donation days, so if anyone would like to adopt a family at our safe house, a HOPES family, or a family in our Strengthening Families Program – [or they can] volunteer to deliver donated food and other items.” To help, call 342.2530 or visit fss-ama.org.\n\nHigh Plains Food Bank\n\nDue to the COVID pandemic, the High Plains Food Bank is currently closed to all volunteers and community service. However, the pandemic continues to impact those struggling with hunger, and the Food Bank has faced a sharp increase in demand. And there’s good news: Due to the way the food bank accesses food, it’s able to stretch a one-dollar donation 10 times further. That means a $50 donation has a $500 impact. In addition, food donations may be left in the cart located in the HPFB foyer at 815 Ross St., Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. For retail and other large/bulk donations, call 374.8562.\n\nMeals on Wheels\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, Meals on Wheels has become vital to its clients – safely delivering meals to the homebound elderly and severely disabled, providing them with nourishment and a bit of socialization and comfort during difficult times.\n\nThe storied organization is always looking for volunteers, especially during the holiday season. Call 374.1451 or visit amarillomealsonwheels.org for more information.\n\nThe Salvation Army\n\nOnce again, Amarillo’s Salvation Army will be accepting Angel Tree gifts this holiday season, which will help provide Christmas gifts to more than 2,000 children in the Panhandle. All donations must be made before Dec. 17. For more information about The Salvation Army programs, services, or to volunteer, call the main office at 373.6631. Secure donations can be made online at salvationarmytexas.org/amarillo or by calling 1-800-SAL-ARMY (specify Amarillo).\n\nTexas Panhandle 100 Club\n\nAn organization that benefits city, county, state and federal law enforcement officers, firefighters and certified peace officers operating within the top 26 counties of the Texas Panhandle, the 100 Club responds immediately to the financial aid of families of public safety personnel who are seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. This holiday, you can make a donation or honor a loved one with a membership in their name. Call 331.4100 or visit texaspanhandle100club.org.\n\nUnited Way of Amarillo and Canyon"
