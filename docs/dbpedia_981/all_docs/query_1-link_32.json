The front side of each attractive family photo holiday card features a large holiday greeting to the entire world from your family. On the back side, multiple photo spots are available for you to fill up with your happiest and favorite memories of the past year. Below that, you have space to write a personal message of hope and inspiration. We do provide a wide number of alternate back design templates for you to choose from that can be swapped out to create a whole new family photo Christmas card design. We always plant a tree with each order."
