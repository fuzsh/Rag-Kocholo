        "text": "The Glad Tidings Wrap was designed as the Advent project for Jimmy Beans Wool in December 2021.\n\nThe original design used 16 mini skeins of yarn, with a new shade added to the design each day in the lead up to Christmas.\n\nThe design is a great stash-buster if you have lots ​of little bits of left over 4-ply yarn, or you could use a curated collection of mini skeins.\n\nThe wrap is made by working a central crochet band which is added to daily.\n\nIn the Jimmy Beans version the colours used on each side of the ​central band pretty much matched each other in terms of\n\ncolour and we have made a version using Scheepjes Whirl, which does the same. ​You could create a quite different\n\neffect by using random shades or treating the wrap like a 'temperature' project where you assign colours\n\n​to different temperatures and select your yarn according to the warmth of the weather that day.\n\nHowever you choose to approach making the wrap, I hope you will enjoy creating this project.\n\nThis project was originally designed for Jimmy Beans in the US and was released in December 2021.\n\nWhen the pattern reverted to me in 2022 we ran the project as our own Advent CAL.\n\n​\n\n​The pattern has now been amended so that it is not in a crochet along style.\n\nYou can purchase the paper brochure pattern (in UK or US terms) by following this link,\n\nor you can find download versions on Etsy and Ravelry."
