        "text": "Let’s look at it this way: If I run across someone I know is Christian this time of year, the sentiment is going to be “Merry Christmas,” not the more-denatured “Happy Holidays.” For Christians of any flavor, the season holds special promise and meaning, so the greeting is appropriate. Very much as I used to greet my Muslim colleagues with “Ramadan Kareem,” or “‘Eid Mubarak,” as called for – or speak the occasional “Blessed Hanukkah” to those Children of Israel I knew. Tellingly for those who notice, that ancient “Festival of Light” falls in the same part of the calendar as does Christmas.\n\n“Happy Holidays” for the rest, although if one is out and about engaging in the hustle, bustle, happiness and festive activities of the Christmas season, it seems a little Scrooge-like to take umbrage at the statistically most appropriate greeting for the time of the year. Perhaps those inclined to take offense at the joyous hello should eschew the accompanying short schedule and fun for longer hours in the office. Less chance of being offended that way…\n\nToday’s greeting conundrum is a recent phenomenon, but also part of the continuing evolution of the celebration with which we Christians mark the birth of the Redeemer of Mankind and the bringer of glad tidings. In the third century of our era in Rome, greetings would have been much different, and probably sub rosa; Christianity was still outlawed as a dangerously radical cult. In 17th-century England no one would have had a problem with “Merry Christmas” to all, but Cromwell’s Puritans had a real animus toward decorated trees, “holiday” or not. Office parties were also right out. And Saint Nicholas was still a bit nebulous in concept; in most of Europe he was as likely to hand out a switch as a toy.\n\nToday’s world, drenched as it is in political correctness and moral relativism, there would seem to be little scope for messages of joy or good news. For my fellow Christians, however, joy and good news there are, in abundance. Those who cannot grasp the why of it could do worse than ask. We’ll share the reasons.\n\nOr, for those permanently divorced from the “spirit of the season” – by which I do not, incidentally, mean Jack Daniels – perhaps this would be a good time to take stock of the progress man has made in the past 2,000-odd years, and at least give thanks for our industry and apparent good fortune – without spending too much time speculating about the source of the latter. Wouldn’t want to make anyone uneasy.\n\nFor myself, I think I’ll channel that 17th-century Santa and pass out a few prezzies. Just remember, some of them might sting – as appropriate.\n\nFor the leadership of Colorado’s Republican Party, the ability to get over yourselves. Remember, more people vote than you know personally, so if might be important to listen to what they have to say once in awhile.\n\nFor Colorado’s students, an easier replacement for the CSAP test. It emphasizes those “higher order thinking skills,” so don’t worry. Pretty soon, no one will care if you don’t know who fought in the Civil War, or what the capital of Vermont is (it’s Montpelier, by the way).\n\nFor Xcel, another year of the current Colorado Public Utilities Commission. I don’t think you could ask for anything better.\n\nFor the Silverthorne Town Council, a skunk eye. You’ve probably used up your supply on Home Depot.\n\nFor the Summit County Sheriff’s office, a Breckenridge New Year’s convention of the New Women’s Christian Temperance Union.\n\nFor the Governor, a copy of Friedrich von Hayek’s “The Road to Serfdom.” You may not get it, but at least you’ll know what the other side is talking about.\n\nFor Stephanie Villafuerte, a hearty handclasp for realizing at last that the jig is up.\n\nFor all the folks in the Colorado State Legislature, a few sessions with Mary Breur, an “organizational change consultant” and executive headhunter. That last part should come in handy in about a year.\n\nFor Scott McInnis, a little fire in the belly. “Because it’s my turn,” isn’t a very good reason to vote for you for governor.\n\nFor Josh Penry, a gold star for being the adult in the room. God knows, somebody had to be …\n\nFor Rob Katz, a big box of snow. I hear that’s all he wants for Christmas.\n\nAnd for the rest of you, the best and merriest Christmas ever.\n\nYeah, OK. Happy Holidays too. Have it your way."
