        "text": "Dear Village Families,\n\nA still small voice, a silent night, Emmanuel.\n\nAs Christmas enters our world, we pause. The sounds fade, the lights dim, and our eyes are opened; God with us, in our midst, seeking, serving, saving.\n\nWe look through the God-created faces of our Village and find the fullness of God in the richness of each other. It is in our learning community that we together find the joy in service, the beauty of reaching out to others from 192 to Kenya to Ukraine, finding who we are through caring for God’s creation. Caring, as we teach in the IB Learner Profile, to show empathy, compassion, and respect…a commitment to service and to make a positive difference in the lives of others and the world around us.\n\nCaring, serving, loving. Loving, the culmination of our calling, the essence of God.\n\nBehold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. And unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. God did this because He so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For the greatest of these is love. (Luke 2:10-11, Isaiah 9:6, John 3:16-17, I Corinthians 13:13)\n\nSo Joy to World, the Lord has come, repeat, repeat the sounding joy!\n\nMerry Christmas,"
