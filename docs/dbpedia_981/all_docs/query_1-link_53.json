        "text": "Tidings means news, or information. Glad tidings is happy news.\n\nI'm not sure I'd use the phrase glad tidings in your example at all, to be honest. I wouldn't be giving good news to people who strive, but some kind of reward or praise.\n\nSo, for equivalents to give glad tidings I would offer:\n\nSend good (or happy) news\n\nFor an equivalent to give glad tidings as it was used in your example I would offer:\n\nGive praise\n\nOr, the ever popular:\n\nOffer large sums of cash\n\nAn interesting way to get synonyms for that expression is to look for it in a book known to have many translations (here, the Bible) and then to work your way through said translations. Here, Isaiah 52:7 has (New International Version):\n\nHow beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news,\n\nwho proclaim peace, who bring good tidings,\n\nwho proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!”\n\nOther version include “bring good news of happiness”, “break the news that all's well”, “bring good news”, “bring good tidings of good” (King James; sounds weird), and “bring glad tidings of good things” (New King James)."
