        "text": "Aaron Shows provides vibrant and colorful music in this Christmas collection for organ. The setting of “Angels We Have Heard on High” calls for 4’ flutes and is marked “twinkling, starry,” while the “Sans Day Carol” calls for an “Irish whistle-like” sound. Included are settings of “Patapan,” “Masters in This Hall,” and “Ding Dong, Merrily on High,” along with several other familiar carols. A joyful and welcomed addition to holiday services, concerts, and festivals.\n\nJesus says that the bread he gives for the life of the world is his flesh, and whoever eats this bread has eternal life now and will be raised on the last day. In Ephesians Paul tells us what this life Jesus gives us looks like, this life we live as those marked with the seal of the Holy Spirit in baptism. We live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us. The whole purpose of life is giving yourself for the other."
