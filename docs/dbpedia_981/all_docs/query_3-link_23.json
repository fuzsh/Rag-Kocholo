        "text": "Heard any good Christmas songs lately?\n\nNo, that isn’t an entirely stupid question.\n\nWhile I realize that during this time of year, every form of media is inundated with holiday tunes, the key word in the above question is “good” Christmas songs.\n\nThe way I see it, Christmas songs can be divided into three basic categories; cute, touching and spiritual.\n\nThe first category has, as its hallmark, the idea of not taking the holiday too seriously. There’s “Frosty the Snowman,” “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” and “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” to name just a few.\n\nThe other morning on our way to work, my husband, Bob, and I heard something entitled “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas” on the all-holiday radio station we were listening to.\n\nNeither one of us had heard this before, and even though the song was patently ridiculous, we both had broad smiles on our faces as we listened to the words.\n\nI guess you could say that’s the beauty of cute Christmas songs; they serve to remind us of the fun we used to associate with the season.\n\nTouching Christmas songs, on the other hand, place more emphasis on feelings than on fun.\n\nThese are the songs that remind us of the folks we love, both near and far, and our longing to be with them during this special time.\n\n“I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” “There’s no Place Like Home for the Holidays” and “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” are excellent examples of this second category.\n\nLast, but never least, are the spiritual Christmas songs.\n\nThese hail the miraculous joy and wonder of Jesus’ birth.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I used to love singing these carols, even though I rarely knew the words.\n\nFor example, I thought it was “We Three Kings of ‘Orientar'” not “Orient are.” As a huge fan of the original Star Trek TV show, I assumed the three kings must have come from some far away planet, which, I must admit, made the whole thing extra cool for me.\n\nThen there was “Silent Night,” which noted the “round young virgin” (‘Round yon virgin). For years I though Mary must have had a weight problem. I also thought it was pretty rude of the song writer to mention the fact.\n\nOf course, there were several other puzzling aspects of carols.\n\n“Deck the Halls” had me scratching my head and wondering two things — who was Holly and why had she gotten herself disemboweled? And I could never figure out why the singing angels were all named Harold.\n\nNow that I’m an adult, I understand the words of my favorite Christmas carols.\n\nEven more importantly, I understand their meaning.\n\nWe often become so used to singing songs that we fail to pay attention to the words. How sad.\n\nThe next time you sing “Away in a Manger” or “It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,” I hope you really listen. The writers of these beautiful old songs poured out their hearts and faith into each stanza.\n\nI know you’ll be blessed. Merry Christmas!"
