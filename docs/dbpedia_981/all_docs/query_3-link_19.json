        "text": "Celebrate Christmas this year with the enchanting sounds of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, featuring David Archuleta, on their new holiday album, “Glad Christmas ­Tidings.”\n\nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir alone is uplifting and full of holiday spirit in tracks such as “Three Dancing Carols” and “A Christmas Roundelay.” But if that's not enough, Archuleta lends his voice to half the songs on the album, and some have said his voice was made for Christmas music.\n\nAlready having released his own Christmas album, Archuleta takes on some different holiday tunes like “The Cat and the Mouse Carol” and “Los Pastores a Belen” (in Spanish), along with classics like “Joy to the World” and “Silent Night.” Archuleta always has a majestic yet joyful sound to his voice when singing holiday songs, and there's just something about him singing with the choir that's simply magical.\n\nThis album will captivate you and get you right in the holiday spirit."
