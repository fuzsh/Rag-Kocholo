I hope you know how much I look forward to sharing this time with you every other Wednesday. Today, I thought I’d share a glimpse of our pre-Christmas fun, along with how the McKenna family from my Alaskan Courage series celebrates.\n\nWe’ve been busy trimming our trees, getting our winter exercising in, and lots of time with the kids (who are way too old to be called kids, but they’ll always be my girls) and grandkids!\n\nA friend shared this delicious and highly addictive recipe with me years ago and we still make it as often as we can.\n\nSpeaking of recipes, here are a couple of the McKenna family favorites:\n\nGage loves all things peppermint so he’s especially excited at Christmas when peppermint comes out in spades. My daughters love it equally as well.\n\nThis is my favorite McKenna wintry drink. Brew up a cup, grab a good book and curl up by the fire.\n\nDespite all that is going on in the world and in many of our homes, those in Christ have hope–always. He is our hope. Hold tight to Him.\n\nI pray you all have a wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year!\n\nReader Question: I’d love to hear how you’ve been preparing to celebrate Christmas and would absolutely love to see some pictures.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n~Dani"
