        "text": "MERRY TWO DAYS before Christmas. You’re probably all out shopping or thawing turkeys or going a’ wassailing or trying to get your partridges to stay in those darned pear trees. (Try a pneumatic 18-gauge brad nailer. Works every time.)\n\nWhilst shopping, thawing or nailing, please accept my veritable grab bag of holiday-related information that you’re gonna get whether you like it or not, kind of like that boomerang fruitcake from Aunt Hazel in Florida that you regifted to your brother in Chicago who regifted it to your cousin in Kentucky who gave it back to Aunt Hazel in Florida who sent it you again. Ah, circle of life.\n\n1. Haven’t heard from that special someone yet this year? Not even Aunt Hazel? C’mon, don’t rush the postal service. Allow them another day, give or take a century.\n\nAccording to news reports, a postcard mailed from the remote realms of Alma, Neb., on Dec. 23, 1914, featuring an adorable color drawing of Santa Claus and a bright-eyed young girl, just arrived at its intended destination in Oberlin, Kansas — just this month!\n\nAn intrepid postal worker found the venerable card in some nook and/or cranny at a post office in Illinois, popped it in an envelope with a 41-cent stamp (the 1-center of the early 1900s wouldn’t have gotten it as far as the post office lunch room) and mailed it again. The addressee, Ethel Martin, long ago gave up waiting to get the note from her Nebraska cousins, and died. But her sister-in-law, Bernice Martin, remains alive and received it.\n\n“It is kind of curious,” Bernice said. “We’d like to know how it got (in Illinois). But wherever they kept it, it was in perfect shape.”\n\nPoor Ethel. All that time, she probably felt slighted by her cheeky Nebraska cousins. This kind of thing might have caused a family rift. It might be how wars get started. Hang on, Hatfields! You might still get a letter of apology from the McCoys.\n\n2. People are nice. Well, I dunno about the Hatfields and the McCoys, but David Castleberry of Oakland sure is. And he’s a man of his word.\n\nCastleberry, a retired AC Transit bus driver, was at Cache Creek Casino & Resort back in October, and won\n\n$1,095,457 on a slot machine — the biggest lump-sum ever paid out by a casino in Northern California.\n\nAmid the warm glow of success, he said he planned to help his family and the folks at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in East Oakland, who put on an annual holiday dinner for those in need.\n\nAnd he did! The glow stayed! Castleberry provided much of the food for nearly 150 hungry people at the church feast last Sunday. But he didn’t stop there. He found out the church’s heater had been broken for four months and\n\nmembers couldn’t afford to fix it. So he gave them a $10,000 donation for a new heating system. “It felt real good to do that,” he said.\n\n3. It’ll be a Jamaica Blue Mountain Christmas. That’s just the best coffee ever. My husband and I love it so much, we make it a Christmas present to ourselves because it only comes out this time of year and it’s $39.95 for a half pound. A HALF POUND!\n\nIt’s so precious that we French press only a little taste at a time — just a trace, letting it cascade gracefully into the special green ceramic mugs that we only use for the JBM, the aroma causing spontaneous celebration with smiles curving on our lips like happy, sappy little Whos in Whoville, then we sip, our mouths caressing the precious liquid gently, tenderly, slowly, as if we’re Will Smith and it’s the last drop of coffee on this planet — but only on weekends and Christmas and maybe New Year’s if there’s any left by then.\n\nLast year, we had none. NONE! Thanks to hurricanes ravaging crops in the Caribbean, Peet’s only had a small batch, and it never made it to the stores. They only offered it to online customers and it sold out in minutes, before we even heard about it, which I thought was totally unfair until I became an online customer this year and got early dibs on the JBM and now have some in my hot little hands. BWAHhahahaha! Store-going fools, bow down to my supremacy!\n\nSorry, sorry. It must be the caffeine.\n\n4. Don’t forget Boxing Day. No, it’s nothing to do with fists or shadows or the greatest Cassius Clay. The traditional Dec. 26 custom has long been observed in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, so the Brits, Aussies, Kiwis and Canucks always get an extra day off after Christmas. Lucky Brits, Aussies, Kiwis and Canucks.\n\nIt’s a customary day of giving and therefore much less violent than its name would indicate, unless of course the gift is thrown at its recipient, which would be wrong.\n\nIt’s a day of giving. Yes, I know, that’s what Christmas was for. But this is something more. It may have started when lords and ladies in the Middle Ages would “box” up their holiday dinner leftovers — maybe even some fruitcake — as gifts for the household staff who had given up their own holiday to cook and serve.\n\nAnother version says members of the merchant class gave boxes of fruit and food to tradespeople and servants that day in an ancient form of a Yuletide tip. Others say it began when the priests opened up church alms boxes and distributed the contents to the poor.\n\nRegardless, it’s a good day to give some more, and maybe have some fun in return. “These days, there’s still the passing on of food goodies and’elping people out, but now the main tradition is to go down to the pub,’ang out with friends and family and’ave a couple of pints,” said Mari Kennard, a Brit’erself and one of the owners of The Crown, a British pub and restaurant in Danville where they always honor the day with some scrummy shepherd’s pie, or some bubble and squeak. Horses for courses, you know. So have a happy Boxing Day, be generally chuffed to bits, have a luvvly-jubbly good time and Bob’s your uncle!\n\n5. Christmas letters — those long, printed notes that come inside cards from relatives, detailing events of the past year. I always eagerly await the one from my friend’s aunt in the Midwest, which usually contains descriptions of horrifying physical ailments, such as overzealous ear wax.\n\nThis year, no ear news, but word of high corn and bean prices, and a downturn in pig prices. Guess there’s no living high on the hog these days. The aunt also wrote about going to a Baptist women’s convention with their minister. “We had Bible school right after getting back with a record number of children.” Oh my gosh! They stole a record number of children from the convention! Put those children back!\n\nMy own Iowa in-laws also always offer delightful info from the farm. They had a big ice storm last week, and my sister-in-law had to drive 25 mph on old Hwy. 18 for fear of sliding into a ditch and being forced to call her brother for a tow. “Pulling people out of ditches isn’t as much fun as it used to be,” she said.\n\n6. For some last-minute, inexpensive, one-of-a-kind and sometimes prickly gifts, check out the “Free” section on Craigslist. Here are some I useful items I found just the other day:\n\n– Free good clean dirt. (With photos.)\n\n– Rabbit food.\n\n– Didgeridoos, handmade of PVC pipe.\n\n– Cactus, 36-inches high. “Come get it. Don’t be shy!” the post read.\n\n– Broken electric space heater. “It stopped working and now just blows cold air.” (With photos.)\n\n– Set of four “Lord of the Rings” goblets with light-up bases. Frodo, Gandalf, Arwen and Strider.\n\n– Items from a “Deal or No Deal” float that was in the Los Gatos Holiday Parade. “It doesn’t include the Christmas tree, the woman or the truck and trailer in the photo.”\n\n– “Free shirts from a girl I never want to see again,” the post read. “She was medium build, a little top-heavy. Let me know if anyone wants them or else they will end up as oil rags.”\n\nAnd my personal fave — not a free item, and I’m not sure if it was a joke, but this was actually posted on the general community page and it’s hilarious:\n\n“Need help writing Craigslist posting. Hi, I’m new at doing Craigslist postings. Any assistance would be appreciated.”\n\nBut… you posted it, brainiac. Dude, I’ve got a fruitcake in Florida for sale."
