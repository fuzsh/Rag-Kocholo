        "text": "1970 song by Van Morrison\n\n\"Glad Tidings\"Song by Van Morrisonfrom the album Moondance ReleasedFebruary 1970RecordedSeptember–November 1969, A&R Recording Studios, New York CityGenre\n\nR&B\n\njazz\n\nsoul[1]\n\nLength3:42LabelWarner Bros. RecordsSongwriter(s)Van MorrisonProducer(s)Van Morrison and Lewis MerensteinMoondance track listing\n\n\"Glad Tidings\" is the tenth and final song on Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison's 1970 album Moondance.\n\nRecording and composition\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Glad Tidings\" was the final song recorded on the Moondance sessions from September to November 1969 at the A&R Recording Studios in New York City with Elliott Scheiner as engineer.[2]\n\nVan Morrison gave the origins of the song's composition, remarking that \"Glad Tidings\" is about a period of time in which he was living in New York City. A friend of his wrote him a letter from London and he'd written on the envelope 'Glad Tidings from London'. He wrote 'Glad Tidings' from New York back – and that's where he got the idea.[3]\n\nAllmusic describes it as a \"brisk shot of R&B, worthy of any Stax artist or sounds that were emanating from Muscle Shoals during the mid '60s, with a bopping bass line, lively horn section, and rock-steady groove.\" The review goes on to say that \"The horn section delivers the song's main melodic hook, punching up the chorus with accent lines supporting Morrison's infectious harmonies.\"[4]\n\nBrian Hinton, in reviewing the song notes that \"Glad Tidings\" seemed to be addressing some of the issues that Morrison had experienced a few years before with Bert Berns and the record label Bang Records: \"businessmen talking in numbers, people who interrupt 'when you're in trances', strangers who 'make demands'.... even the opening line and closing line, 'and they'll lay you down low and easy' , could be either about murder or an act of love.\"[5]\n\nIn the media\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Glad Tidings\" was used on \"All Due Respect\", the final episode of the fifth season of The Sopranos. In a review of that last episode, The Star Ledger states: \"The episode's use of Van Morrison's \"Glad Tidings\" as a recurring motif was a classic example of the show's attention to detail. Moments before buckshot fired by cousin Anthony \"Tony\" Soprano hit Anthony \"Tony B\" Blundetto, we heard the verse that opened with \"And we'll send you glad tidings from New York\" and closed with \"Hope that you will come right in on time.\"[6]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nVan Morrison – vocals, guitar\n\nJohn Klingberg – bass guitar\n\nJef Labes – organ\n\nGary Mallaber – drums\n\nJohn Platania – guitar\n\nJack Schroer – alto saxophone\n\nCollin Tilton – tenor saxophone\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nHinton, Brian (1997).
