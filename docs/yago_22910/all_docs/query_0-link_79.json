        "text": "MEDIA: What attracted you to this project?\n\nGINA: I loved and wanted the opportunity to play something other than the badass capable woman with a gun. It was incredibly intriguing, and also sort of timely for me--to be somebody's wife, to be somebody's mother, to show a different side, you know? A softer side. And a woman who doesn't always have all the answers. So that was the biggest draw for me.\n\nIn spite of playing so many \"badass capable women,\" I don't think I've ever been more scared of you onscreen than when your character threatens Chris' with what she'll do if she catches him cheating on her...\n\n[laughs] Oh, really? I didn't say she was weak! [laughs]\n\nWhat kind of rage is going through your mind when you're delivering a scene like that?\n\nI think it's pretty obvious. [laughs] You know, betrayal is a very painful thing. Nobody wants to feel betrayed, nobody wants to feel like the person that they have committed heart, soul, and psyche to has \"pillaged\" all that love and commitment. [laughs] So yeah, to kind of try to wrap your brain around what that is hard, and it's painful, and it's angering, and it's frustrating, and it's infuriating.\n\nDo you think your character Brenda was aware of what was going on with her husband?\n\nI think she suspected. I think you can't be married and share a life with somebody and not know that something's off--that something's not quite right. As we know, she goes looking for proof and doesn't find any, but clearly she knows that, \"Hmmm...\" [laughs] She smelled something.\n\nWould Richard and Nikki's relationship be considered an affair in the absence of sex?\n\nIt's an emotional affair. It's absolutely an emotional affair. Whether there's a bodily fluid exchange, at that stage in the game, does it matter? [laughs] Because he's spending all this emotional energy and time with--and investing time and energy with--this one person. You know, I remember talking to somebody once a long time ago, and the definition of cheating was definitely \"who are you sharing the stuff that makes a marriage special and intimate with?\" If you are compromising that, if you are sort of infiltrating that area of your life with somebody, then yes, then absolutely it's cheating.\n\nWhat was your experience of working with the kids like?\n\nWe have quite a few scenes with them. Milan, who plays the little girl...She was a doll. She was an absolute doll. Very professional. Gotta look out for Milan in the next few years. She's definitely a natural actress. And she was very cute. She was very funny. She really was open to improvising, which is shocking from a five year old. [laughs] And the kids who were younger, we had a more difficult time with them. I think 18-month olds are much more aware than maybe a younger child would be, so they miss their parents a little more. They're a little more intrigued by everything that's going on and overwhelmed by everything that's going on. So it was hard to kind of get a fresh one. We worked with twins. [laughs]\n\nWhat were some of your favorite scenes to shoot?\n\nWell, I love the ambulance scene. I love the Viagra scene. I thought that actually turned out really well. And that was funny. It was sort of our bit of \"big comedy.\" I do love Kerry's scene where she's basically delivering her \"old girl in the club\" monologue, which I thought gave such lovely insight into who this character was, because up until that moment, you just want to hate her so much. You're just, \"What are you doing? You're a ho, you're after this [woman's] husband, what's wrong with you?\" And then you see that she's just this insecure, sad person that's made a lot of bad choices. And then I love my scene with Chris after he's been out and being naughty and he comes home late and I'm on the stairs and I'm like, \"Don't ever do that to me again.\"\n\nYou also have a scene where you and Chris suddenly break out into song...\n\nHappens every day in my life. [laughs] \"Break out into song.\" I love that scene. And I think it's a great payoff, because we've taken this journey with these people, and you think it's just going to go so terribly wrong. Up until that last moment, we're back and forth, and \"is he going to do the right thing or isn't he?\" And then it's such a wonderful sort of joyous release at the end of this movie that these people have come together, and they've come together in song. I mean, how much more can you ask for?\n\nYou've trained professionally as a singer. Was this scene added specifically to use that talent?\n\nNo. That was already in the script. That was written in the script. Actually, Chris had no idea whether or not I could sing when he hired me. [laughs] I was asking about that scene, and he's like, \"Oh, can you sing?\" I was like, \"Yeah, yeah, I can sing.\" And then they gave me the recording of it, and it was pitched so high out of my range, I was like, [coughs] \"Okay, I'm going to do my best, but it's comedy...So let's just roll with it.\" [laughs] But yeah, it was great fun to do.\n\nWere you concerned about Chris' singing abilities?\n\nI knew that it was comedy. [laughs] And so it didn't matter. And it would actually work better if he couldn't. But I was shocked that he actually hit the kind of notes that he did. [laughs] I was like, \"All right! Good going!\"\n\nWhat was Chris like as a director?\n\nI was pleasantly surprised. I really was. I did not expect him to be as prepared and as focused as he was. He is generous, and I had certainly expected him to be funny. The script was in such good shape that there weren't any disagreements about [how things should play out]. He had such respect for us as actors that he was really quite open as a director to have us bring our best game, and to bring whatever rang true for us. And so as an actor, to have a director like that is a godsend, really. And he trusted everybody. He trusted everybody that he hired to be their best and do their best. And so he stayed out of their way as well. So really, great atmosphere to work in. I'd work with him again!\n\nDo you have a preference between film and television work?\n\nNo, as long as the material is good. My preference is good material. [laughs]\n\nYou said your baby is due in June. Do you plan to take time off after that?\n\nWell, right now, there's nothing on my schedule, so I will be taking time off. [laughs] You know, when you're an actor and you're used to \"working freelance\" as it were, the term \"take time off\" doesn't really make any sense. You kind of roll with it and you hope that the projects come along that you want to spend time on, and that you want to give your time to. I plan to give quite a bit of my time to this project right here, and look forward to what the future holds.\n\nAny concerns about your child wanting to follow in the acting footsteps of its parents?\n\nYou know, it's been great for me. I can only hope that if the child decides that that's what it wants to do, that it does so with the knowledge that it's not easy. [laughs] And it has its parents to reiterate that at every given turn. But yeah, who knows? That question is a long way away.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThanks, guys! Have a great remainder of your day."
