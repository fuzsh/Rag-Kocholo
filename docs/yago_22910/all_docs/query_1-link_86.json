        "text": "Saw this Friday and my wife and I really enjoyed it. He wrote this with Louis CK and the talent of both shows through. I think married couples may enjoy this more but its pretty good.\n\nRecommended, probably 3/5 stars.\n\nDid anyone else see it?\n\nNot quite.\n\n\"I Think I Love My Wife\"\n\nPersonally I think the title is awful. It's not a strong sounding statement. Is it meant to be a realization in the uplifting sense of the phrase? Or to show a sense of doubt...as in \"I THINK I love my wife.\"\n\nIf the film is about a guy who is going through the questions of fidelity in his marriage why not just call it...\n\n\"I Hate My Wife\". Stronger title, more declaritive, sounds more fun for an audience, etc. The \"I Think\" part sounds too wishy washy for a title of a film. It's like saying \"The Empire MIGHT Strike Back\".\n\nPS - Not that this could save the movie in any way. It opened at #5 and personally it looks awful.\n\nConsidering what it was, and not looking for some fine cinematic achievement, I still thought it was horrible. Really low grade and so many played jokes. I understand Chris Rock's humor is crude, and some of the time (not most) I do find him funny, but I thought this was awful.\n\nAnybody else pick up on the name of the firm, Pupkin & Langford?\n\nOn Howard Stern, HS asked Chris why he directed the film?\n\nChris said that it either it would have been a B-Talent director or him....so he figured he couldn't be much worse....plus Spielberg gave him a complement on his last film....said he should keep directing.\n\nI thought he wasn't \"on\" and seemed kind of preoccupied, and not sharp at all, but I didn't think it was too strange - except for the part when he tried to joke about Richard Jeni, a fellow comedian who he had been friends with. As I remember it, he said Jeni's last words were that everyone should go see Chris' new movie. Letterman didn't seem to know how to react, and laughed out of nervousness as much as anything, as did the audience. I thought the whole thing was just \"off\" but I didn't make too much of it.\n\nYou wouldn't think so from Stern's Sirrus interview.... Was literally the best interview in years. Beat the heck out of his \"In The Actors Studio\" and I thought that was good...."
