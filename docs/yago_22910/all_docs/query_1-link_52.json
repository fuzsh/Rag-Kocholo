        "text": "This event will be a device-free experience. Use of all phone, smart, and/or recording devices will not be permitted in the performance space.\n\nUpon arrival, small devices will be secured in Yondr pouches that will be unlocked at the end of the event. Guests will maintain possession of their Yondr pouches throughout the night, and if needed, may access their devices at designated Yondr unlocking stations in the lobby.\n\nAll pouches and equipment are routinely sanitized. The Yondr staff is trained and required to follow safety guidelines and hygiene protocols to practice social distancing, minimal contact and wear required personal protective equipment.\"\n\nFrequent FAQs\n\nQ: Do I maintain possession of my phone at all times?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Will the case affect my phone in any way?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: My ticket is on my phone. What do I do?\n\nA: Printed tickets are preferred for entry, but Yondr staff will be standing by to unlock your phone so you can access your mobile ticket in order to enter the venue.\n\nQ: I have a babysitter at home OR I am on-call for work — Where can I check my phone?\n\nA: Set your phone to vibrate as you enter the venue. You’ll be able to feel your phone vibrate through the Yondr case when you receive calls or texts. You may use your phone throughout the night at designated Phone Use Areas in the lobby of the venue.\n\nQ: What is a Phone Use Area?\n\nA: Guests are able to use their phones at designated Phone Use Areas in the venue. All phones must be secured in a Yondr case before guests re-enter the performance space.\n\nQ: How do I unlock my phone after the show?\n\nA: Yondr staff will be stationed at all exits to unlock your phone at the end of the show.\n\nQ: Does it take long to unlock the cases and leave the venue?\n\nA: No. Yondr staff are located at each exit to unlock cases. We find that leaving is consistently faster at a phone-free show.\n\nQ: I didn’t know about the phone policy. What if I don’t want to do this?\n\nA: This is the show policy, and as a result we cannot allow entry to any guests with cell phones or smart devices if they are not secured in a Yondr case.\n\nQ: What happens if there is an emergency in the venue and I can’t access my phone?\n\nA: All venue staff and security have cell phones and radios. Should an emergency occur, they are trained to implement and execute safety and emergency procedures. Guests should follow all venue instructions and evacuate immediately in the case of an emergency. Yondr Venue Staff will have hand-held unlocking devices outside at a safe distance from the venue.\n\nASM Richmond is committed to the health and safety of our patrons, guests, artists, performers, crew, and staff and we will continue to follow the latest health guidance and protocols. In light of the changing conditions with COVID-19 and the Delta variant, we are working closely with all of our promoters to ensure the health and safety of our patrons, staff, and guests.\n\nCurrently, Altria Theater is operating at 100% capacity and is strongly encouraging all patrons, whether vaccinated or not, to mask while at the venue. We do not have a vaccination or negative test requirement in place as a venue, although promoters of our upcoming shows are considering multiple options, including the possibility of masks, vaccines, and COVID-19 tests.\n\nAt this time, this show does not have any additional requirements in place for patrons outside of the standing venue policies. If there are any changes to the requirements prior to the show, patrons will be notified by email and the event page on the venue website will be updated.\n\nFor more information on other actions taken for your safety, please visit https://www.altriatheater.com/visit/health-and-safety.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you back to our venues, and to providing a safe and enjoyable experience!\n\nChris Rock - Ego Death VIP Package\n\nOne premium seat located in the first 10 rows\n\nSpecially designed Chris Rock long sleeve tour shirt (exclusive to VIP only!)\n\nCollectible Chris Rock tour poster\n\nExclusive Chris Rock merchandise item\n\nEgo Death tour laminate\n\nCommemorative ticket\n\nLimited availability\n\nPlease note: all merchandise will be mailed.
