        "text": "Chris Rock says his latest film, \"I Think I Love My Wife,\" is a more accurate reflection of who he is. It's more realistic, more introspective, more subdued.\n\nAs director, co-writer and star, he's drawn his inspiration from French director Eric Rohmer's 1972 film \"Chloe in the Afternoon,\" which is unexpected in itself.\n\nSo you have to at least appreciate that the Brooklyn-born comic is trying to do something different. Trouble is: His movie isn't all that funny.\n\nDirecting for just the second time following 2003's \"Head of State,\" Rock is still too stiff and clunky as a filmmaker. Writing alongside longtime friend and fellow comedian Louis C.K., he definitely has something to say about marriage, race and the black upper-middle class. He just doesn't say it with much finesse.\n\nRock stars as New York investment banker Richard Cooper. He's slightly nerdy, married with two kids and bored with the routine of his life in suburbia, where he fears his family doesn't associate enough with other black people.\n\nRichard and his smart, beautiful wife, Brenda (Gina Torres), have fallen into the same rut so many longtime married couples find themselves in: They don't have sex that much anymore. No particular reason - they're still in love.\n\nThe lack of physical satisfaction becomes acutely obvious to Richard upon the arrival of Nikki (Kerry Washington as a va-va-va-voomy femme fatale), the sexy ex of an old friend.\n\nNikki is classically needy and troubled and repeatedly runs to Richard to rescue her from various jams. He knows it's probably wrong but he likes the attention and is drawn to the fact that she's dangerous.\n\nThey go to lunch, run errands and play hooky from work. The most ridiculous of these interludes involves her tricking him into flying to Washington with her to clear some clothes out of an ex-boyfriend's apartment. And while she tempts him to stray, nothing ever happens.\n\nNevertheless, his work begins to suffer, and colleagues become suspicious of Nikki constantly hanging around. (Except for one, a habitual philanderer played by an underused Steve Buscemi in a refreshingly different role.) Although the relationship is chaste, Richard naturally can't tell his wife.\n\nWhen the inevitable will-he-or-won't-he moment comes, there's some genuine suspense. But since this is the serious, mature side of Rock, you can probably figure it out for yourself.\n\nI THINK I LOVE MY WIFE"
