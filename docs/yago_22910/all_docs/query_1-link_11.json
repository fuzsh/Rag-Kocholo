Some of the material is a little too crude, but it also feels very honest, and Rock &#8211; free from the formulaic PG-13 movies and cartoons he's been doing lately &#8211; looks liberated.",

        "text": "Welcome back, Chris Rock.\n\nThe man hasn't been exactly hiding; in fact, he's been anything but. Doing the voice for an antic zebra named Marty in the \"Madagascar\" cartoons brought him a lot of money; he also showed up in the two \"Grown Ups\" movies.\n\nBut the Chris Rock you may have first loved – the one who told painfully funny, bracingly blunt jokes and then, after a briefly shocked, man-did-I-just-say-that grin, went on to the next – has been harder to find on screen.\n\n\"Top Five\" is his return.\n\nIt's also sort of about that guy, here called Andre Allen. Like Rock, he's a kid from the New York projects who hit as a stand-up, then a Hollywood comedian, but soon started churning out formulaic comedies. Unlike Rock, his career is now on life support, his desperate bid for seriousness – a revolutionary slave epic – dying in the theaters.\n\nOK, what's next, he asks his agent. \"Dancing With the Stars,\" the man replies.\n\nSo partly out of desperation and partly out of guilt, Andre has agreed to turn his wedding to a reality star named Erica into its own Bravo TV show instead. First though, he has a day-in-the-life interview scheduled with a reporter from the New York Times.\n\nAnd – luckily for her, unluckily for him – this turns out to be the worst day in his life in years.\n\nRock – who also wrote and directed – is very good as Andre, and the filmmaking is fine. Done in real New York locations (and with an honest sense of New York geography) it follows him and reporter Rosario Dawson as they dash from junket interviews to bachelor party, with a quick stop back at the old neighborhood in between.\n\nThat's a particularly well-staged scene, shot in a too-small apartment full of too-large people, all shouting and laughing at once; it's tumultuous but, apart from a few moments in a comedy club, it's the one time we see Andre at ease. Because it's the one time he's having a real, human interaction, instead of strategizing, hyping, lying.\n\nRock has filled the film with good actors, too (and a few surprise guest stars) but it's especially nice to see Dawson, a spirited performer with a great, expressive face, finally get a good part. (No good actress has made more bad films.) And both Kevin Hart and Cedric the Entertainer steal their brief scenes as Rock's agent and promoter.\n\nSometime the sexual material (mostly done in flashback) gets overly crude without being particularly funny. One of Rock's love scenes goes on a little too long, and Dawson's is just kind of juvenile. There's also a major plot twist that depends on really misunderstanding how newspapers, and critics, do their jobs.\n\nBut Rock (who may have been inspired by \"2 Days in New York,\" his indie relationship movie with Julie Delpy) delivers a spirited, fast-paced comedy that isn't afraid to spotlight its characters' flaws, or to avoid obvious choices – like making the reality-fiance, Gabrielle Union, a shallow villain, or providing the audience with a spelled-out ending.\n\nIn fact, with its hand-held camera, very human characters and rough edges, the whole movie is about as far from \"Grown Ups\" (and \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" and \"I Think I Love My Wife\") as you can get. And brings Chris Rock a lot closer to where he started – which, in this case, is the best progress of all.\n\n— Stephen Whitty, Newark Star-Ledger/NJ.com\n\n***\n\n\"TOP FIVE\"\n\nGrade: B\n\nRating: R\n\nRunning time: 101 minutes\n\nPlaying at: Opens Friday, Dec. 12 at multiple locations\n\nCast and crew: Chris Rock, Rosario Dawson, Gabrielle Union, Kevin Hart, Cedric the Entertainer; directed by Rock."
