        "text": "Comedian Chris Rock has officially been announced as the host for the 88th Academy Awards.\n\n\"Chris Rock is truly the MVP of the entertainment industry,\" said producers David Hill and Reginald Hudlin in a press release Wednesday. \"Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, documentarian -- he's done it all. He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\"\n\nRock previously hosted the Oscars in 2005.\n\n\"I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars,\" said Rock in the press release. \"It's great to be back.\"\n\nNeil Patrick Harris, who hosted the Oscars last year, tweeted his support for Rock, saying he thinks he'll be \"awesome.\"\n\nRock has won four Emmy Awards for his television comedy series and specials and three Grammy Awards for his comedy albums, in addition to being an accomplished actor, writer, producer and director. He wrote, directed and starred in I Think I Love My Wife and voiced the character of Marty in the first three films in the popular Madagascar series. His own childhood provided the inspiration for his 2005-2009 TV series Everybody Hates Chris which he created, executive produced and narrated. He was also a cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1990 to 1993."
