        "text": "Funny dude, Chris Rock is a very prominent Hollywood figure and even people who don’t watch stand up comedy have encountered him in various film roles over the years, often with a hilarious personality that makes for great comic relief. He has had a terrific comedy career that has made him a fan favorite and ranked him the 5th greatest stand-up comedian in a poll conducted by Comedy Central.\n\nChris rock biography\n\nChris Rock was born Christopher Julius Rock III on February 7, 1965. His parents Rosalie (née Tingman) and Christopher Julius Rock Jr. had their son in Andrews, South Carolina. However, they soon relocated to Brooklyn, New York, settling in the Crown Heights neighborhood. After that they moved into the working class of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Chris Rock went to school in the mostly white neighborhoods of Brooklyn. He was so bullied and beaten by white students that he had to change schools and later dropped out of high school. He later earned a GED but began working menial jobs at various fast food restaurants.\n\nHe entered stand-up comedy in New York in 1984. His rise in comedy was slow but steady and he soon began playing roles in films and on television (the film I’ll Bug You and the series Miami Vice were some of his earliest on-screen work). Eddie Murphy, one of Chris Rock’s comedy influences, saw his performance at a nightclub and befriended him. It was Eddie Murphy who was also Rock’s mentor at the time and gave Chris Rock his first film role in Beverly Hills Cop II.\n\nChris Rock’s other comedy influences are FlipWilson, Bill Cosby and Woody Allen. His career has grown to the point that he is now considered a comedic influence on comedians such as Trevor Noah and Kevin Hart. He became more popular when he became a member of the cast of Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s. His film credits continued to grow as he appeared in the Madagascar film series (2005–2012) and both Grown Ups along with many other successful films. He has also worked behind the scenes, writing and directing films such as Head of State and I Think I Love My Wife while also starring in the lead role.\n\nIn 2005, Chris Rock developed the sitcom Everyone Hates Chris, a sitcom based on his early life that he also wrote and narrated. Rock has received numerous awards throughout his career, including four Emmy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He has twice hosted the Academy Awards, in 2005 and 2016."
