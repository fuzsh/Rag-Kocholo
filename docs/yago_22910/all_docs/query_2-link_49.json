        "text": "I Think I Love My Wife Movie Synopsis & Plot\n\n\"I Think I Love My Wife,\" written, directed by and starring Chris Rock, is a sophisticated comedy about marriage and the lure of a new love. Nikki (Kerry Washington) is the exciting free spirit who makes Richard's (Chris Rock) daydreams come true while Richard's wife Brenda (Gina Torres) is so preoccupied with her own career and raising their two children that she has little time for her husband.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW\n\nGive Chris Rock props for trying something new. Sort of new. Almost. I Think I Love My Wife is a comedy and almost-drama about a man who meets a crossroads in his marriage when he suddenly finds himself so unsatisfied with his sex-depriving wife that he starts to consider an affair with an attractive friend. And by attractive friend, I mean the scorching hot Kerry Washington.\n\nRead our I Think I Love My Wife movie review Â»"
