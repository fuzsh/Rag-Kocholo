        "text": "Last October, Chris Rock drove from his New Jersey home to Greenwich Village’s Comedy Cellar and slipped inside undetected. The Comedy Cellar charges patrons $24 to see anonymous comics, with the unspoken tease that you might see Louis C.K. or Amy Schumer working on new material. Tonight was no different. The patrons sipped away their drink minimums and endured unknowns sprinkled with knowns – both Judd Apatow and Dave Attell did sets. Then the MC announced Rock. The audience went silent for a moment before jumping up in a roar as Rock, in jeans and a T-shirt, took the stage.\n\nHe hadn’t been seen much on the stand-up scene in a while; he’d spent his past few years starring in movies both sky-high (Top Five, which he wrote and directed) and crawl-space low (co-starring in Adam Sandler’s Grown Ups). There had been a turn as Oscar host in 2016 – the year of no black nominees. In fact, much of what the Comedy Cellar crowd had recently read about Rock was regarding his divorce from Malaak Compton-Rock after 18 years of marriage. Every divorce is unhappy in its own specific way, and Rock’s was no different. There were claims that Malaak kept Chris from their two daughters, Lola and Zahra, a charge she vehemently denied. After a tense two years of negotiations, the divorce became final in August.\n\nThat night, Chris Rock was still a wound that had not been cauterized. At 52, he somehow doesn’t look much different from when he played crack-addled Pookie in New Jack City exactly half his life ago. Still reed-thin, he smiled with perfect teeth – the one cosmetic change from his early days – and paced the claustrophobic stage for a few seconds. He then began describing how much his ex now hated him.\n\n“If someone wants 52 percent custody, you know they want to kill you,” he said.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThere were some knowing giggles, but the response was muted. The audience was eavesdropping on a therapy session. Rock mentioned that he had slept with only three women on his last tour. Some of the women hissed, and many of the men stared into their drinks. Rock smiled. “Men, it’s a lot easier to be faithful when no one wants to fuck you.”\n\nThere was uneasy laughter. Someone whispered he was glad he hadn’t brought his wife. Rock spoke about Donald Trump for a minute, predicting his victory. In October in New York, this made the crowd pity him like a sad clown. He quickly returned to his own life, occasionally glancing at some notes he kept on a stool. He mentioned he might have to take on some shitty TV work to make his alimony payments. He then went into a bit about being in court and realizing he was paying for everyone – his lawyers, her lawyer, the court reporter: “Everyone woke up today and said, ‘I’m billing Chris Rock.'” There was more unsure laughter. Then he ended his set with a rhetorical question.\n\n“Would I ever get married again?” He paused. His voice raised an octave. “Not if it would cure AIDS.”\n\nThe crowd clapped, because Chris Rock is one of the greatest comedians of our lifetime, but they wondered what the hell they had just witnessed.\n\nRock was at the bar about an hour later watching the Los Angeles Dodgers try to stay alive in the playoffs against the Washington Nationals. Desperate for a win, the Dodgers brought in Clayton Kershaw, the Chris Rock of pitching, to make his first relief appearance of the year. Kershaw had pitched just two days earlier, and the bar speculated whether he would have his good stuff. He did, getting a pop-up followed by a strikeout with high heat. Rock watched with wonderment. “Man, he still has his fastball,” he said. “After all that, he still has his fucking fastball.”\n\nA few months later, Chris Rock headed out on the road for the first time in nine years, openly wondering “if I still have my fastball.” He had just signed a two-special, reportedly $40 million deal with Netflix and was adjusting to sharing custody of his girls. The stakes had never been higher.\n\nBy March, the world has changed. Rock is in Denver on an early leg of his Total Blackout tour that will lead to the taping of the first special, in December. “I can’t tape it now,” jokes Rock. “It’s the alimony tour. I’ve got to make some money first.”\n\nTonight, Rock is riding over to do a soundcheck at Denver’s Bellco Theatre with opening comedian Ali Wong and a longtime friend, the writer Nelson George. Few comedians do a soundcheck, but Rock is a self-described “anal little bitch when I’ve got to do a gig. Meanwhile, Dave Chappelle can get off the plane and, like, tumble into 30,000 seats and blow everybody off the stage.”\n\nRelated\n\nHis Trump prediction came true. The talk turns to how Trump stole Rock’s nine-year-old joke about how could John McCain be a hero if he got captured. “He messed it up,” says Rock. “The man can’t tell a joke.” Someone asks how he knew Trump could win, and Rock delivers a well-reasoned argument about how “of the moment” candidates like Barack Obama and Trump always beat the “it’s my turn” candidates like McCain and Hillary Clinton. “Presidential politics is like show business, it doesn’t give a fuck – ‘Whoever’s hot,'” says Rock in a mocking tone. “‘Ooh, you paid your dues. We don’t give a fuck. Migos has the Number One record, fuck you.'” Rock gets out of the van, and someone mumbles props about the Trump pick but whispers sotto voce that Rock also keeps predicting the L.A. Clippers will win the NBA title.\n\nRock looks out at the 5,000-seat theater and tries to remember if he’s been here before. He steps to the mic and checks his level with an old-school rap.\n\n“He is DJ Run, and I am DMC, funky-fresh for 1983.”\n\nFrom predicting Donald Trump’s presidency to where he draws his comedy inspiration from, here are the five things we learned hanging out with Chris Rock.\n\nRock was raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and was bused to a school where he was the only black kid in his grade; the white kids threw bags of piss at him. (Those memories provided the inspiration for his sitcom Everybody Hates Chris.) Despite the hazing and abuse he suffered, Rock doesn’t reflexively reject white culture. His tastes are expansive, and his fandom runs deep. On the day of his father’s wake, Rock, the eldest of seven, had to decide if the casket would be open or closed, yet still found the time to run to the record store and buy U2’s Rattle and Hum, which had been released that day. “I love Bono,” he declares.\n\nRock dismisses the pigeonholing of black acts, whether in comedy or music, as only commercially viable to American audiences, and he’s proud of his global reach. “I mean, if Simply Red can play Wembley Stadium in London and then the Beacon in New York, I can do that,” he says. After soundcheck, he lets me in on a secret. “The great thing about comedy is the low overhead,” Rock says. “I don’t have to split the money with a band. I make more money per gig than the drummer in Metallica.”\n\nIn his dressing room, a few candles burn next to a framed portrait of Prince. Rock’s crew is responsible at each stop for putting a new photo of the legend in a place of honor. Rock won’t say he and Prince were close, but they talked, and Rock loved his music. He saw Prince do one of his final shows, at a New Year’s Eve party in 2015 on St. Barts with Paul McCartney and Leonardo DiCaprio in the audience. He was distressed that his hero seemed to be surrounded by new people. Prince didn’t appear to have brought a girlfriend or a buddy along. “He just seemed all alone,” Rock says.\n\nWhat’s left unsaid is that, like Prince, Rock is divorced and in his fifties, as he heads out on a yearlong tour filled with lonely hotel rooms and FaceTime with his daughters.\n\nRock took another thing from Prince: He makes his audience hear the new stuff. He starts every tour with nothing, and doesn’t sprinkle in a greatest-hits package like many comedians do; even Jerry Seinfeld adds only 20 minutes of fresh material a year.\n\n“Would I ever get married again?” His voice raises an octave. “Not if it would cure AIDS.”\n\n“He has an incredibly high pain tolerance because it is difficult to go out there with material that you’re not sure of,” Seinfeld says. “To constantly go back and start over is very impressive, and a little insane.”\n\nRock may be comedy-neurotic, but he isn’t a performer who needs to sequester himself away before a show. It’s 15 minutes until he goes on, and he talks about the old days versus the new days like anyone over 40 tends to do. He grouses about young comics asking for favors and selfies: “In my day, you didn’t fucking walk up to Eddie Murphy – are you kidding me? No, you shut the fuck up and watched and waited.”\n\nThat’s precisely what happened to Rock. Murphy saw him at a New York club in 1986 when Rock was 21, told him he liked his set and invited him to see She’s Gotta Have It the next day and meet then-first-time director Spike Lee. That night, Murphy invited Rock to fly to Los Angeles with him the next morning. Rock said his dad would have never given him permission, but he was working late that night. In the morning, Rock was on a plane for his first time.\n\n“I got to hang around the real Eddie Murphy,” says Rock. “Not Dr. Dolittle. Leather-suits-every-day Eddie. Elvis.”\n\nSomeone gives Rock the two-minute warning. He paces a bit and then heads onstage to the sound of Jay Z’s “You Don’t Know.” A large “CR” lights up. The crowd rises to its feet and gives him a long ovation. There are no smartphones flashing; Rock has insisted all concertgoers lock them in a sleeve that can only be unlocked when you leave the show. He grins with a scrunched, devilish face, a look you only see Rock give onstage.\n\nHe then launches into 90\n\nminutes of controlled comic\n\nrage. Rock has always been\n\na mix of Lenny Bruce social\n\ncommentary and his dad Julius Rock’s fierce sense of personal\n\naccountability. Julius was a longtime New\n\nYork Daily News truck driver, and he did\n\nnot suffer those who did not shoulder their\n\nburden. His father’s teachings could be seen\n\nat the root of one of his son’s most famous\n\nbits, “black people versus niggas,” from his\n\n1996 Bring the Pain tour. It’s a routine,\n\nRock says, that he couldn’t do now. “The\n\njoke wouldn’t work because there would be\n\nso much freaking backlash,” he says. “Too\n\nmuch politically correct backlash.”\n\nThis is a different Rock than the one I\n\nsaw at the Comedy Cellar. He waits until\n\nabout two-thirds through the show before\n\nhitting his divorce. He is more introspective. “I was a piece of shit,” says Rock as\n\nthe crowd goes quiet. He segues into his\n\ninfidelities and gets disarmingly specific,\n\ndescribing three women: one famous, one semifamous, and one a member of the retail\n\nclass. Nelson George warns me that “the ‘I’\n\nonstage is not the ‘I’ of Chris. He’s trying to\n\ncreate that persona of the new Chris and\n\nkeep some separation for the real Chris.”\n\nStill, this doesn’t seem like persona, particularly\n\nwhen he urges his audience that if\n\nthey love someone to hold on tightly. (And\n\ntravel a lot, and fuck when you’re angry.)\n\nLater, Rock will describe the current set\n\nas less rap-influenced than his earlier material\n\nand more of a Mary J. Blige record. “This is all ‘hold tight, fight through it,'” he\n\nsays. “This is all R&B shit.”\n\nHe ends the set with the story from the\n\nNew Jersey courthouse where he is footing\n\nthe bill for everyone. But this time he slyly turns it around.\n\nNow Rock sees it as a\n\nsign of success. He exits\n\nthe stage to rapturous\n\napplause and beelines\n\nit back to the dressing\n\nroom, where George\n\nand Wong tell him it\n\nwas the best show of\n\nthe tour so far.\n\n“Tomorrow will be\n\nbetter,” says Rock. “Tonight’s\n\nshow went on\n\nsale first. Tomorrow\n\nthere will be more black\n\npeople.” He smiles. “Black people don’t like\n\nto tie their money up\n\nfor six weeks.” Rock hasn’t chosen a spot, but he will\n\nrecord his special before a predominantly\n\nblack crowd. Someone asked him what\n\nhe thought of a special from SNL‘s Michael\n\nChe. “I liked it,” he says, “but it’s too\n\nmany white people in the audience. You do\n\ncutting-edge humor about race and you\n\ncut to white people – it does not have the\n\nsame effect.”\n\nRock’s stand-up hero is Richard Pryor.\n\nHe mentions Pryor’s famous routine about\n\nAfrica: “Pryor does the Africa bit, about ‘there’s no niggas here,’ but it’s a bullshit\n\nbit if it’s done in front of a bunch of white\n\npeople. When black people laugh, there’s a\n\nrumble.” Rock pauses for a second before\n\ngoing back to his favorite metal band. “You\n\nwatch Metallica – I want to see them in\n\nfront of fucking metalheads. I don’t want\n\nto see them in front of guys in suits.”\n\nA little later, Rock sits in the corner of\n\nthe lounge at Denver’s Four Seasons with\n\nGeorge, Wong and Matthew Claybrooks,\n\na comedian and former Everybody Hates\n\nChris writer who is helping Rock decide\n\nwhat is working and not working in the set.\n\nRock nurses a mojito.\n\nHis three decades of material suggest\n\nthat his ambivalence about marriage has\n\nalways been there. He made a movie called\n\nI Think I Love My Wife, and he did a bit about Nelson Mandela splitting from Winnie\n\nMandela: “Marriage is so tough, Nelson\n\nMandela got divorced. … He got out\n\nof jail after 27 years of torture, spent six\n\nmonths with his wife and said, ‘I can’t take\n\nthis shit no more.'”\n\nReminded of that, Rock half-grimaces,\n\nhalf-laughs.\n\n“Some of it was a prophecy,” he says. “I\n\nwasn’t a good husband a lot of the times.”\n\nPerhaps trying to deflect, he asks me if\n\nI am married. I tell him I am, for a second\n\ntime. I joke that my first relationship lasted\n\nnine years and I was seeing if I could\n\nbreak the nine-year barrier. He asks if we\n\nhave kids, and I tell him we have a toddler.\n\nRock insists it will work out.\n\n“You got a kid now,” he says. “You’ll be\n\nfine. You need each other. Need is big.\n\nA woman breaks up with you, the first\n\nthing she says is ‘I don’t need this shit.’ She\n\ndoesn’t say, ‘I don’t love you,’ she says she\n\ndoesn’t need you.”\n\nHe doesn’t mention whether this wisdom\n\ncomes from hard-won personal experience. A few minutes later, Rock looks at\n\nhis phone. He shakes his head and laughs. “My own daughter has blocked me on Instagram.”\n\nHe stands up and heads to his\n\nhotel room. “They grow up so quick.”\n\nThere are two kinds of\n\ntalent in the world: the guy\n\nwho shows up hungover 10\n\nminutes before the game/gig (think Keith Richards\n\nor Yankees legend Mickey\n\nMantle) and coasts by on\n\nnatural charisma; and the\n\ngrinders (think Seinfeld or\n\nTom Brady), who hijack their talent to another\n\nlevel solely on their obsessive work\n\nethic. Rock is firmly in the second camp,\n\nand owns it.\n\nRock and Louis C.K. have been friends\n\nfor 20 years, and C.K. told Rock a story\n\nabout his early days in Boston when he\n\nwould pester older comedians for advice\n\nand beg clubs to put him onstage when he\n\nwasn’t on the schedule.\n\n“All those comedians kind of hated\n\nme,” remembers C.K. “They would write\n\nmean graffiti about me on comedy-club\n\nwalls. I told Chris about that and how I\n\nwas ashamed I was such a pain in everybody’s\n\nasses. Chris just yelled at me, ‘No,\n\nyou’re wrong. They’re wrong. That’s what it\n\ntakes.'” Rock even threatened to break off\n\ntheir friendship if C.K. didn’t stop writing\n\nfor other people and write for himself.\n\nRock never lacked confidence, but, sometimes,\n\nit didn’t stick around. He has always\n\ntoggled between Muhammad Ali’s “I am\n\nthe greatest” and Rodney Dangerfield’s “I\n\nget no respect.” His stand-up career rose\n\nand fell meteorically. According to Rock, he\n\nwas around 19 years old when he stepped\n\nout of a line buying tickets for an Eddie\n\nMurphy show at Radio City Music Hall,\n\nwandered over to a Manhattan club and\n\nkilled in his debut performance. The next\n\nhalf-dozen times out, he killed some more.\n\nThen he bombed, and, the way Rock describes\n\nit, bombed for the next three years.\n\nMurphy’s first comedy album came out\n\nwhen Rock was 16. He wasn’t overly impressed: “I thought it was\n\nOK; I was that much of an\n\nasshole. I was like, ‘I can\n\ndo that.'” But then Delirious\n\nwas released, and Rock\n\nwas properly cowed. During\n\nthe Nineties, Rock was\n\nplaying a theater in Chicago\n\nwith Martin Lawrence\n\nopening for him. He heard\n\nwhat he thought was a fight\n\nin the audience and looked\n\nout from the wings: It was\n\njust people losing their\n\nminds over Lawrence’s set.\n\nRock wasn’t even 30, but he\n\nfeared the game had already\n\npassed him by. So he worked\n\nharder. A few years later,\n\nRock and his brother went\n\nto a Lawrence show in New\n\nYork. As they were leaving,\n\nhis brother told him, “You’re\n\nbetter than that.”\n\n“It never occurred to me,”\n\nrecalls Rock. “But it was a\n\nkey moment in my life. A\n\nyear later, I did Bring the\n\nPain and realized I didn’t\n\nhave to wait in line.”\n\nBesides work ethic and\n\ntalent, Rock has his shit together.\n\nThere was nothing like Pryor setting\n\nhimself on fire, Lawrence disoriented\n\nand wandering in traffic, or Chappelle\n\ndisappearing into Ohio. Sure, Rock once\n\nowned a gun, and it once went off, putting\n\na hole in his mattress, but those things\n\nhappen. He has joked onstage about the\n\nbenefits of a breakdown: the ability to start\n\nagain. But it hasn’t happened.\n\n“I never had one,” says Rock. “Getting divorced,\n\nyou have to fucking start over. You\n\nget to reset. It’s not a breakdown, but something\n\nin your life broke down.”\n\nRock spends the day after his first\n\nDenver show holed up at the Four Seasons\n\nwith George working on a script that he will\n\nonly say is centered on pundits. He’s worked\n\nwith George for 25 years, since they collaborated\n\non the Spinal Tap-ish rap-spoof\n\nmovie CB4, which was pilloried upon its release\n\nbut has aged well. (That night, a fan\n\noutside the hotel asked Rock to sign some\n\nCB4 material. “Damn, there’s, like, a cult of\n\nCB4,” Rock says with amazement.)\n\nEvery artist wants to be good at something\n\nelse; musicians want to be actors\n\nand actors want to be musicians. Rock is\n\nno different, but much of his film career\n\nhas lurched from forgettable to forgettable.\n\n(Rock defends the Sandler stuff as “good hangs.”) It wasn’t until the Julie\n\nDelpy-directed 2 Days in New York and\n\nRock’s own Top Five that he began receiving\n\nrespect from critics. Not coincidentally,\n\nboth were released after\n\nRock spent six days a week\n\non Broadway working on his\n\nacting in The Motherfucker\n\nWith the Hat. And yet, the\n\nmuch-sought roles haven’t\n\nbeen rolling in.\n\n“Maybe I’m like an alcoholic\n\n– I have to show I’m\n\nsober, make a series of good\n\nmovies,” jokes Rock. “I’m\n\nnever gonna get the Chiwetel\n\nEjiofor part, so I have to\n\nwrite my own stuff.”\n\n“I asked myself, ‘Do I want to be\n\nangry for a year?’ It’s not healthy. I’m not Sam Kinison – I\n\nloved Kinison, but that’s not where I want\n\nto hang out every night.”\n\nOffstage, Rock is quiet, almost\n\nreticent. He’s not a comedian\n\nwith an insatiable\n\nneed for endless yuks. He is\n\na fan of authenticity and even\n\ngives Donald Trump a little\n\ncredit on that front (at least\n\nthe Trump of ancient times).\n\nRock did a stint at Saturday\n\nNight Live in the early Nineties\n\nand would sometimes\n\nrun into Trump at the China Club, a New York hot spot.\n\n“Trump would walk in\n\nand women would be all over\n\nhim,” says Rock. “And you’d\n\nsay, ‘That’s Donald motherfucking\n\nTrump.’ I give him\n\nthis, too: He just never really gave a fuck.\n\nYou’d see him out all the time, but he’d have\n\nhis suit on, his red tie. He was never trying\n\nto be someone else.”\n\nThat minor key of admiration doesn’t\n\nprevent Rock from ripping Trump in his\n\nnew show. His main point is that the President is a\n\nclassic bully, and in sissified modern America\n\nwe have no clue how to deal with a bully. Rock’s set is surprisingly pro-bully; his reasoning\n\nis that being bullied toughens you\n\nup and gets you ready for the real world,\n\nwhich is filled with assholes. There’s more\n\nthan a little self-reference here: Rock’s\n\ndrive to succeed began with those school\n\ndays in Brooklyn, with the grandsons of\n\nIrish and Italian immigrants stealing his\n\nlunch money. Onstage, he wonders why\n\ncops don’t occasionally shoot a white kid\n\njust to make it look better when they mow\n\ndown black kids. Speaking of black kids,\n\nRock half-jokes during his set that any responsible\n\nAfrican-American father should\n\nbegin his son’s day with a punch to the face.\n\nOn the second night in Denver, the significantly\n\nblacker crowd stamps and howls.\n\nRock was right. The theater rumbles all\n\nnight long.\n\nRock and his small crew\n\npile into a rented Gulfstream\n\nafter the show for a red-eye flight\n\nacross two time zones for tomorrow’s\n\nshow in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe jet isn’t exactly a party\n\nplane. Rock and I order PB&J\n\nsandwiches, and the flight attendant\n\napologizes that there are no\n\nlemons on board for Rock’s tea. Everyone\n\nelse dozes off. “I told you this was the alimony\n\ntour,” says Rock, munching his sandwich\n\nand explaining the overnight country-crisscross. “I can’t waste time.”\n\nWe settle in as the plane sails over the\n\nMidwest and talk for the duration of the\n\nthree-and-a-half-hour flight. I tell him that\n\nI saw him at the Comedy Cellar and noticed\n\nthat the current show has less pure anger\n\nthan the October set.\n\n“You might have caught me just coming\n\nout of court,” says Rock. He pauses for\n\na minute and looks out the window into\n\nthe night. “I asked myself, ‘Do I want to be\n\nangry for a year?’ It’s not a cool place to be.\n\nIt’s not healthy. I’m not Sam Kinison – I\n\nloved Kinison, but that’s not where I want\n\nto hang out every night.”\n\nRock mentions in his act that he thought\n\nhe could get away with bad behavior in\n\nhis marriage because he was the famous\n\nbreadwinner. He now knows the opposite\n\nis true. “That’s bullshit,” he says, rolling his eyes. “That actually goes the other way. My faults\n\nare magnified. Your significant other, if\n\nthey really love you, has a high opinion of\n\nyou. And you let them down.”\n\nRock admits that he has toned down the\n\nmarriage part to keep the peace and not be\n\na dick. “It’s not fair,” he says. “I have a mic,\n\nshe doesn’t. God forbid people are bugging\n\nher in the supermarket. That’s not cool. I’m\n\ngoing to have to see her at weddings and\n\ngraduations.”\n\nStill, it hasn’t been an easy time. His\n\nmother came down with cancer during his divorce. She was treated at Sloan Kettering\n\nin New York, which happens to be on the\n\nsame street as his divorce lawyer. “I thought\n\nthat was the most evil street in the world,”\n\nsays Rock with a wan smile.\n\nRock cared for his mother at the New\n\nJersey home he bought in the same neighborhood\n\nas his ex-wife. “There was days\n\nwhere I just prayed she would die when\n\nthe girls were at their mother’s,” he says. “I\n\ndidn’t want them to see that.”\n\nBut happily she recovered. Rock began\n\nto see some slight benefits of having shared\n\ncustody. He got out to see more comedy\n\nand could slip over to Brooklyn and check\n\nout an art gallery at his leisure during his\n\nnoncustody nights. But Rock is the son of\n\nJulius Rock, the eldest of 14. I get the sense\n\nRock felt his divorce set a bad example for\n\na family that he proudly attests has had no\n\nout-of-wedlock births and no one in jail. He\n\nsays being the oldest has its burdens, but it\n\nhas gotten easier over the years.\n\n“It’s not so much a job now,” says Rock. “Well, I gotta find my brother Brian a job.\n\nLike, that’s a literal thing I have to do. It\n\nonly comes into play during emergencies.\n\nThen your rank matters.”\n\nRock orders a Coke, a dietary splurge\n\nrare for him. He nearly jumps out of his seat\n\nwhen I suggest he couldn’t be serious about\n\nhis bit advocating that black fathers start\n\nthe day by punching their sons in the face.\n\n“You have to physically show them – the\n\nconsequences of not listening to your parents\n\nare death,” he says. “It’s death. This is\n\nnot a joke. I was in Bed-motherfuckingStuy.”\n\nRock gives me a name to look up on\n\nmy computer. “He is in jail for rape and\n\nmurder. That guy used to take me to the\n\nfucking baseball games. What’s the only\n\ndifference? We were on the same block. I\n\ngot a father that did not play that shit.”\n\nHe sips some Coke and clenches a fist.\n\n“Maybe I don’t have to punch a kid in the\n\nface, ’cause I have fucking time up the ass.\n\nBut if I’m working 12 hours a day, you tell\n\nme how I’m gonna do this, how I’m gonna\n\nkeep this black boy alive.”\n\nRock dropped out of high school, but\n\nGeorge describes him as an autodidact\n\nwho is well-read and devoured the Bible\n\nand the Koran. George insists Rock could\n\nhave been a great music critic if he’d chosen\n\nthat path. It is the critic’s cold-eyed approach\n\nthat made him certain that Trump\n\nwould defeat Clinton. He shut up around\n\nhis teenage girls as they celebrated Clinton’s\n\nimpending victory, and he was there\n\nto comfort them after the loss. As Rock is\n\ntelling me this, George wakes up.\n\n“There’s white and gray,” says George\n\nsleepily. “He veers toward the gray.” Rock doesn’t disagree. “I have no trust in\n\nmankind,” he says.\n\nRock later tells me where that comes\n\nfrom. Partially, it’s the loss of his beloved father when Rock was 23. His dad died on\n\nElection Day in 1988, and Rock dreaded\n\nthat day until President Obama’s victory in\n\n2008. He cites a stat that a high percentage\n\nof U.S. presidents lost a parent early. “You\n\nhave to succeed because you have no lifeguard,”\n\nhe says. “With a lifeguard, you can\n\ndo flips and shit. But without one, you’ve\n\ngotta go, ‘Shit, how long is it going to take\n\nme to reach shore?'”\n\nThe other grind on Rock is simply being\n\nblack in America. Fame doesn’t get him\n\na free pass. Rock doesn’t travel with an\n\nentourage and knows the\n\nstares he will get when he\n\nwalks alone into a strange\n\nplace, like another school\n\nwhere his daughter is playing\n\na game, until everyone\n\nrealizes it’s Chris Rock.\n\n“I see the looks: ‘What\n\nare you doing here?’ Shit\n\nthat white people, especially\n\nwhite men, don’t have\n\nto deal with. I literally get\n\ntreated like a nigger a few\n\ntimes a day.” He pauses. “I\n\ncan’t imagine what it is like\n\nfor my brothers and what\n\nthey go through every day.”\n\nSo Rock looks for some serenity\n\nin a familiar place. He\n\ntalks in his set about finding\n\nGod before God finds\n\nhim. That is not persona\n\nRock. “I wanna find some\n\npeace, ’cause people usually\n\nfind that peace in a horrible\n\ntime,” says Rock. It’s now 4\n\na.m. somewhere, and Rock\n\nlooks more vulnerable than\n\nbefore. He talks in a small voice. “Why does\n\nthat have to be? Maybe I can find God without\n\nbeing in shambles. Maybe I can reach a\n\nhigher plain spiritually without being in a\n\nnear-death experience.”\n\nThe pilot announces that we’re approaching\n\nRichmond. We talk about the\n\nstereotype that the only way to create art,\n\nwhether you’re a comic or Picasso, is by\n\nbeing irresponsible and an asshole.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be that way,” says\n\nRock, rubbing his red eyes. “You can be\n\nfucking nice.”\n\nAt the Altria Theater in\n\nRichmond, tonight’s Prince picture\n\nfeatures the artist scowling.\n\n“There’s so many shows that I\n\ngot to stand right at the side and\n\nwatch him get mad at motherfuckers,”\n\nsays Rock. He impersonates\n\nhis hero for a moment: “That\n\nwas a B-flat, motherfucker.”\n\nRock and Claybrooks, the Everybody\n\nHates Chris writer, are in Rock’s dressing\n\nroom to go over the Denver shows and see what worked and didn’t work. Rock\n\nbrings up his bullying bit. He worries it’s\n\ntoo preachy. “I used to do ‘I wouldn’t be\n\nhere right now if it wasn’t for bullying. I’d\n\nbe, like, a Fed Ex guy – don’t get me wrong,\n\nI’d be the funny Fed Ex guy.'”\n\n“You should do it,” says Claybrooks. “Especially\n\nin a town like this.”\n\n“It brings it back to me,” says Rock. “Makes it less preachy.”\n\n“I see the looks: ‘What\n\nare you doing here?’ Shit\n\nthat white people don’t have\n\nto deal with. I get\n\ntreated like a n–ger a few\n\ntimes a day.”\n\nIt’s a common concern for Rock. His\n\ngrandfather was a Southern preacher, and\n\nyou can hear the cadence and repeating\n\nof lines like in a sermon.\n\nRock occasionally tunes in\n\nto preachers like T.D. Jakes\n\nor Joel Osteen. “I can watch\n\nthem like I watch George\n\nCarlin,” he says. He fantasizes\n\nabout collaborating with\n\na preacher on a set. “You’d\n\ngotta get a preacher who\n\nis down,” says Rock. “Do a\n\nremix.”\n\nClaybrooks and Rock\n\nmove on. Claybrooks asks\n\nhim if he wants to do his bit\n\non the reality show Basketball\n\nWives.\n\nThe gist of the material\n\nis that women on TV used\n\nto be known for their independence,\n\nlike on The Mary\n\nTyler Moore Show, and now,\n\naccording to Rock, “Women\n\njust want to be known for\n\nguys they used to fuck. Half\n\nof them aren’t even wives.\n\nThey should just call it ‘Ho’s\n\nof the Pros.'”\n\nRock decides to table the\n\nbit for tonight, but it touches on the third\n\nrail of Chris Rock scholarship: Onstage,\n\nhe is an essentialist; Rock sees women as\n\none way – not always kindly – and men\n\nanother way, two species with very little\n\nin common.\n\nI ask him about it. For the only time,\n\nRock gets a little defensive. “Most singers\n\nhave, like, three songs, four songs that they\n\nkeep writing over and over again,” he says. “If you’re Prince, you might have five or six.\n\nSo I have four or five jokes.”\n\nIn the end, Rock argues that the material\n\nworks because people laugh, the surest\n\nsign that comedy has the ring of truth.\n\nBut it doesn’t come without a cost. His\n\ndaughters are now at an age where they\n\noccasionally voice their displeasure. Rock\n\nshrugs it off – “That’s how we eat,” he says. “I would love it to be different.” For the\n\nfirst time, Rock makes reference to Megalyn\n\nEchikunwoke, his girlfriend. Echikunwoke\n\nis an actress who has starred on CSI:\n\nMiami and Arrow. The two have been seen\n\ncanoodling at Knicks games. “Actually\n\nI’m dating a girl now,” he says. “She’s got her own\n\ndough, it’s amazing.”\n\nThe set review continues. Rock decides\n\nto add a bit about how after a black funeral\n\neveryone serves soul food: “It’s the same\n\nfood that killed the guy!”\n\nRock cracks himself up, a rarity. The session\n\nends when a familiar Afro pokes into\n\nRock’s dressing room. It’s Questlove of the\n\nRoots. He was in D.C. and decided to pop\n\ndown for the show. “It’s Ahmir Questlove,\n\nladies and gentlemen,” announces Rock.\n\nRock is clearly happy to see his friend.\n\nQuestlove has a nice surprise for Rock. He\n\ngives him his headphones and whispers\n\nhe’s cueing up an unreleased Prince song\n\nfew have heard. Rock is a Prince completist\n\nwho owns nine versions of Computer\n\nBlue. He goes wide-eyed. The music plays,\n\nand Rock does a rubbery-leg dance around\n\nbackstage. The song is the adrenaline shot\n\nthat the jet-lagged/missing-his-kids Rock\n\nneeds. Soon, it’s time for him to take the\n\nstage. He’s still grinning ear-to-ear. “Damn,” he says. “I think this is gonna be\n\na good show.”\n\nA few weeks after Denver and\n\nRichmond, Chris Rock did three\n\nshows in New Orleans. That Saturday\n\nnight, the “CR” was illuminated, but Rock didn’t come out. Instead, it was\n\nDave Chappelle. He did a half-hour before\n\nRock appeared and the two icons traded\n\nriffs, to the crowd’s delight. Chappelle\n\ndoes not give a fuck about propriety and\n\nasked Rock what kind of shitty lawyer he\n\nhad that made him lose his home to his ex-wife.\n\nThen Chappelle turned shrink and\n\nasked Rock if he cried during the divorce\n\nprocess. Rock said he cried once: “During\n\nthe custody battle.”\n\nAfterward, Rock says it was a revelatory\n\nmoment. “No one’s ever asked me that,”\n\nhe says. “I don’t even know if a shrink has\n\nasked me that. We live in a world where\n\nmen are assumed to not have feelings.” He\n\ngives an example. “All my friends assume I\n\nmoved into the city after my divorce, away\n\nfrom my girls. When I say I bought a house\n\naround the corner, it blows their minds.”\n\nThree days after the Chappelle catharsis,\n\nRock is at Madison Square Garden\n\nfor Garden of Laughs, a children’s charity\n\nevent affiliated with New York Knicks\n\nowner James Dolan.\n\nIt is, as they would say in the old days,\n\na cavalcade of stars. John Oliver; Leslie\n\nJones; Seinfeld makes a surprise appearance,\n\ndoing a droll piece on why bathroom\n\nstall doors don’t go all the way to the floor.\n\nAnd then Rock closes the show. He looks\n\nexhausted, having flown in a few hours\n\nearlier. He does a compressed version of his set and ends on his divorce. Where he\n\nusually says, “It was my fault, I was a piece\n\nof shit,” Rock pauses and improvises. “Was\n\nit my fault?” He lets it hang in the air for\n\na moment. Then he mumbles, “Who the\n\nfuck knows.”\n\nTrending\n\nI ask Rock a few days after the show\n\nif this marked a new step in the divorce\n\nspectrum, from denial to guilt to ambiguity.\n\nHe is sitting at the counter of a diner in\n\nTenafly, New Jersey, with SportsCenter on\n\nmute on the TV. Rock maintains that was\n\njust an exit line. He says the current set is\n\neven more angst-filled and self-reflective\n\nthan when I saw it. He’s even eliminated\n\nsome of the more Rock-ian bits, including “pussy costs money, dick is free.”\n\nHe grimaces. “You go back and you’re\n\nlike, ‘Why the fuck did I ever say that?'”\n\nRock knows that most will focus on the\n\nbreakup part of the set, but to him the crucial\n\ncomponent is his quest for serenity.\n\n“I’ve been thinking about that stuff for\n\nyears, I just didn’t have the gravitas,” he\n\nsays. He hesitates. “Is that the right word”\n\nHe then makes a final analogy before finishing\n\nhis meal.\n\n“It’s like a kid singing the blues. Justin\n\nBieber can’t sing the blues. You gotta go\n\nthrough some shit. That’s me talking about\n\nfinding God, but then God finds me.”\n\nHe pauses for a moment. “That’s my\n\nfucking U2 song.”"
