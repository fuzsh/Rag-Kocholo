Richard Cooper (Chris Rock), a successful investment banker with a beautiful, intelligent wife and two gorgeous kids at home, would seem to have it all. However, between the daily commutes from the suburbs to New York City, the endless business meetings, the kids’ diapers, and the Wiggles on TV, there’s only one thing on Richard’s mind: women.",

        "text": "A laugh-less comedy, an unmoving drama, and a ragtag assemblage of feeble characters spouting pathetic dialogue.\n\nNovember 24, 2020\n\nRock tries to add some humorous moments, but most come off as either crass and crude or just plain weird.\n\nNovember 21, 2019\n\nJust imagine how much more authentic, topical and engaging this would be if Rock made this film in 2015 instead of eight years earlier.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nA roly-poly CBS sitcom, only with more liberal use of the f-word.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nI Think I Love My Wife doesn't seem to know which choice to embrace (comedy or drama) and ends up being a hit-and-miss affair.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nRock's breakthrough as a director -- a chance for him to grapple openly with his status as a maturing (but still ostensibly immature) comedian.\n\nMarch 3, 2019"
