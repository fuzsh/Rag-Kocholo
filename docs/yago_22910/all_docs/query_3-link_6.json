        "text": "RYAN: I think I love movies more than you do.\n\nCAROLINE: I beg to differ. But I know we both liked this movie: “I Think I Love My Wife.”\n\nRYAN: It’s Chris Rock’s second venture as a director. And I have to say, as a director, he’s fair. The pacing of this movie was off and it dragged in parts; even his voice-over was a little awkward in its timing.\n\nCAROLINE: Let’s be honest, he’s no great actor either. He’s better as a stand-up comedian. But this movie is thoughtful and very relatable to anyone who’s either been married or has married friends.\n\nRYAN: The screenplay is great. The relatability factor is outstanding. But am I crazy, or does Chris Rock always talk out of the side of his mouth? It’s lopsided or something.\n\nCAROLINE: Yes, he does do that. I don’t think he’s so attractive and he was definitely not put on this earth to act. But he’s a very talented guy in other ways and I enjoyed this film. I know you thought it dragged a little but I didn’t feel that way. It was a tight ninety minutes.\n\nRYAN: Who do you think would have been better in the Chris Rock role?\n\nCAROLINE: Hmm. It’s definitely too small a film for a Denzel or a Will Smith. Maybe Taye Diggs? Or that hot Shawn Wayans.\n\nRYAN: Either one of them would have made this a better movie.\n\nCAROLINE: I really liked Kerry Washington as his adulterous love interest. She’s quite hot.\n\nRYAN: Didn’t you say she had to put on weight for this role?\n\nCAROLINE: Yes, I heard that Chris Rock asked her to put on a few lbs. because he wanted her to be curvy and sexy, which she is.\n\nRYAN: She certainly was.\n\nCAROLINE: I think the movie is somewhat autobiographical in that Chris Rock has been married for several years and has two kids. And overall, it’s just an interesting look at marriage and what happens when you move to the ‘burbs and things get boring.\n\nRYAN: The music in the movie is terrif.\n\nCAROLINE: I loved the music! There were several songs that I was like, “Ooh, what’s this called? I have to buy it!”\n\nRYAN: I also liked the gal who played his wife.\n\nCAROLINE: Of course we love her, she was on “Alias.”\n\nRYAN: Bottom line?\n\nCAROLINE: This was a cute flick but it could definitely be a rental. I enjoyed it and there are some great laugh-out-loud funny moments. Especially the last two minutes of the film, which I won’t give away, but are unexpectedly hilarious.\n\nRYAN: It’s one of the best endings of a movie ever. But overall, it’s a good, not great, movie. It’s worth seeing if you’re in the mood for a romantic comedy, and it provides interesting commentary about single life versus married life."
