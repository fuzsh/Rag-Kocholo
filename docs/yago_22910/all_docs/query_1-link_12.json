        "text": "Critically hailed for his forceful, militant, authoritative figures and one of Hollywood's most talented and versatile performers, Laurence (John) Fishburne III has been the recipient of numerous awards, including a number of NAACP Image honors.\n\nBorn in Augusta, Georgia on July 30, 1961, to Hattie Bell (Crawford), a teacher, and Laurence John Fishburne, Jr., a juvenile corrections officer. His mother transplanted her family to Brooklyn after his parents divorced. At the age of 10, the young boy appeared in his first play, \"In My Many Names and Days,\" at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting.\n\nIn 1973, at the age of 12, young Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) that lasted three seasons. He subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). At 14 Francis Ford Coppola cast him in Apocalypse Now (1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn't work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in Rumble Fish (1983), Cotton Club (1984) and Der Steinerne Garten (1987).\n\nThroughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. TV guest appearances at this time included \"Trapper John,\" \"M*A*S*H*,\" \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Miami Vice,\" \"Spenser: For Hire\" and \"The Equalizer.\"\n\nWith the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in John Singleton's urban tale Boyz n the Hood - Jungs im Viertel (1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA's turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film.\n\nOn stage, Laurence would become invariably linked to playwright August Wilson and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in \"Two Training Running.\" For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as \"Laurence\" instead of \"Larry.\" More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series \"Tribeca,\" he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies Die Ehre zu fliegen - Tuskegee Airmen (1995) and Miss Evers' Boys - Die Gerechtigkeit siegt (1997).\n\nOn the larger screen, both Laurence and Angela Bassett were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the film What's Love Got to Do with It? (1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, Keanu Reeves' mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi Matrix (1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels.\n\nInto the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in Mit aller Härte (2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play \"Riff Raff,\" which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of \"The Lion in Winter\" as Henry II opposite Stockard Channing's Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in Das Königsspiel (1993); a military prisoner in Ein fremder Klang (1990); a college professor in Singleton's Die Rebellen (1995); a CIA operative in Bad Company (1995); the title role in Othello (1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror Event Horizon - Am Rande des Universums (1997); a Depression-era gangster in Hoodlum (1997); a dogged police sergeant in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003); a spelling bee coach in Akeelah ist die Größte (2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream films Predators (2010) and Contagion (2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show \"Thurgood\" and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later transferred to the TV screen and earned an Emmy nomination.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, Fishburne replaced William Petersen as the male lead investigator on the popular CBS drama CSI: Vegas (2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced by Ted Danson. Having since had a regular role as \"Pops\" in the comedy Black-ish (2014), he has also been seen on the bigger screen in the Superman movies Man of Steel (2013) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) as Daily Planet chief Perry White; played a hired assassin in the thriller Standoff - Die einzige Zeugin (2016); portrayed a minister and former Vietnam War vet in Last Flag Flying (2017); and essayed the role of a revengeful prison warden in Imprisoned (2018).\n\nFishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress Hajna O. Moss. In September 2002, Fishburne married Cuban-American actress Gina Torres.\n\nMario Van Peebles is a highly regarded director, actor, producer and writer. His directorial skills can be seen in the retelling of the epic mini-series \"Roots\" starring Forest Whitaker and Matthew Goode. Van Peebles has directed award-winning shows such as the recent hit \"Empire\" and \"The Last Ship,\" as well as \"Sons of Anarchy,\" \"Lost,\" \"Damages,\" and \"Boss.\" As an actor Van Peebles has credits are as equally impressive.\n\nAn independent filmmaker to his core, Van Pebbles grew up watching Melvin Van Peebles, his maverick filmmaker father. A true master craftsman in his own right, Van Peebles is defined as a director, screenwriter, playwright, novelist and composer; known for funding his own work.\n\nHis many talents can be seen in films like his directorial breakout hit \"New Jack City,\" \"Posse\" and \"Panther;\" plus Michael Mann's Oscar® nominated \"Ali,\" in which he received critical acclaim for his role as real life minister and human rights activist Malcom X; the multi-award-winning \"Cotton Club\" written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Clint Eastwood's \"Heartbreak Ridge;\" and several projects with Ava DuVernay.\n\nThroughout his career, Van Peebles has brought challenging, compelling material to the screen, including his hip hop coming-of-age film \"We the Party,\" for which he wrote, directed and produced; his documentary short \"Bring You're a Game;\" and, of course, \"Baadasssss!\" This was Van Peebles' odyssey about the making of his father's groundbreaking film \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" and was one of Ebert and Roeper's ten best movies of the year for 2004.\n\nAs a director, Van Pebbles has affected unusually strong performances from his fellow actors. They often remark that he creates a collaborative climate where they feel free to do their best work. He believes his background as an actor helps him approach the actor's character development process internally. Conversely, he believes being a director has made him a more trusting, nuanced actor. Being able to do both is like creative crop rotation for Van Peebles. Not many directors get the privilege of being directed by other strong filmmakers. Acting for others is still \"super exciting\" to him.\n\nIn 1994, Hofstra University awarded Van Peebles an honorary doctorate of humane letters. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, Van Peebles spent two years working at New York's Department of Environmental Protection before moving to Hollywood to try his hand at acting writing and directing.\n\nIn addition to directing and acting in features, Van Peebles is passionate about supporting education and eco-consciousness through media. With his reality show, Mario's Green House, he teamed up with his five children and his father to chronicle the Van Peebles family's often-humorous attempts to raise their eco-consciousness as they try to go green in Hollywood. Green \"We never got to the full green, more like Olive green,\" jokes Van Peebles.\n\nAdept at playing comic brat extraordinaires both on film and TV, David Spade was born on July 22, 1964, in Birmingham, Michigan, the youngest of three brothers. He is the son of Judith J. (Meek), a writer and editor, and Wayne M. Spade, a sales rep, and is of German, English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Raised in both Scottsdale (from age four) and Casa Grande, Arizona, he graduated with a degree in business from Arizona State University in 1986. A natural prankster most of his life, Spade was pushed immediately into stand-up comedy by friends and appeared in nightclubs and college campuses all over the country.\n\nA casting agent saw his routine at \"The Improv\" in Los Angeles and offered him a mischievous role in the film Police Academy 4 - Und jetzt geht's rund (1987). In 1990, the diminutive, flaxen-haired comedian finally hit the big time as a regular cast member and writer on Saturday Night Live (1975). Slow at first in gaining acceptance on the show, his razor-sharp sarcasm eventually caught on by his second season, when he played a number of smart-aleck characters in a variety of sketches, including a highly disinterested airline steward who bids each passenger adieu with a very sardonic \"buh-bye\" and an irritating receptionist for Dick Clark Productions who greets each huge celebrity with an unknowing \"And you are . . . ?\" A master of the putdown, Spade's \"Hollywood Minute\" reporter also took cynical advantage of tabloid-worthy stars. Spade impersonated such luminaries as Michael J. Fox, Kurt Cobain and Tom Petty during his tenure.\n\nFollowing his SNL departure after six years, he spun off into a slapstick movie career, most noticeably as the scrawny, taciturn foil to SNL's wild and crazy big boy Chris Farley in Tommy Boy - Durch dick und dünn (1995) and Black Sheep (1996). The teaming of this unlikely but funny pair ended with Farley's death from a 1997 drug overdose. Since then, Spade has appeared in his own lukewarm vehicles, including Joe Dreck (2001) and Dickie Roberts: Kinderstar (2003). More recently he teamed with former SNL member Rob Schneider on the film Die Bankdrücker (2006). Television has been more accepting over the years, with Spade earning an Emmy nomination as the droll, skirt-chasing secretary Dennis Finch on Just Shoot Me - Redaktion durchgeknipst (1997) and filling in after the untimely death of John Ritter on ABC's Meine wilden Töchter (2002) as Katey Sagal's unprincipled nephew.\n\nInto the millennium, David was the star of the Comedy Central show The Showbiz Show with David Spade (2005) in 2005 wherein he more or less resurrected his obnoxious, razor-tongued gossipmonger from the old \"Hollywood Minute\" put-down segment on SNL, as well as co-starring in the adult-oriented ensemble sitcom Rules of Engagement (2007).\n\nMore recent comic film vehicles include Die Bankdrücker (2006), The Do-Over (2016) alongside Adam Sandler; Vater des Jahres (2018); and The Wrong Missy (2020), along with cocky supporting roles in Entourage (2015) (as himself); the Adam Sandler vehicles Jack und Jill (2011), Kindsköpfe (2010), Kindsköpfe 2 (2013) and Die lächerlichen Sechs (2015); Sandy Wexler (2017); a voice in the animated feature Hotel Transsilvanien (2012) and its sequel Hotel Transsilvanien 3 - Ein Monster Urlaub (2018); Mad Families (2017) (also-co-wrote); and the rare dramatic thriller Warning Shot (2018). He also played recurring parts on the TV programs Carpet Bros (2008), Love (2016) and The Mayor (2017).\n\nGuy Oseary's entrepreneurial leadership and global vision includes the development and innovative business management of artist brands, (Madonna), producing films (vampire film trilogy Twilight), concert tours (Madonna's \"Sticky & Sweet Tour\" grossed 408 million dollars), management of three-time American League MVP Alex Rodriguez, advisor to the leading coconut water brand company (Vita Coco), and a joint venture partnership with Iconix Brand Group in the apparel industry.\n\nAt the age of 15, Guy Oseary began searching for and developing talent in Los Angeles while still in high school. Two years later, he joined what was to become Maverick Records as an A&R man and quickly rose through the ranks to become Chairman of the label. During Oseary's tenure, he guided Maverick to sales of over l00 million units globally including 33 million copies of the debut album of his young discovery Alanis Morrisette. Her \"Jagged Little Pill\" album would take home four Grammy Awards in l996, including Album of the Year, securing a spot for Maverick Records as one of the industry's leading boutique labels. During Oseary's tenure the label also released albums by Michelle Branch, Prodigy, Deftones and The Wreckers as well as soundtracks to \"The Wedding Singer,\" \"The Matrix,\" \"Austin Powers,\" and Quentin Tarantino's films \"Jackie Brown\" and \"Kill Bill.\"\n\nIn 2005, Oseary became Madonna's manager following several years as the artist's business partner. Their collaboration in all aspects of Madonna's career included the release of multi platinum CDs and two recent worldwide concert tours. The 2006 \"Confessions Tour\" grossed $195 million and her 2008-2009 \"Sticky & Sweet\" Tour was the most successful tour by a solo artist in history with gross revenue of 408 million dollars. In 2007, Oseary negotiated a groundbreaking deal by partnering Madonna with Live Nation, the number one touring promotion company in the world. The unprecedented deal is valued at 120 million dollars.\n\nAs part of Maverick Films, Oseary executive produced the stunningly successful Twilight series. The latest installment, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse set a new record for the biggest midnight domestic opening in box office history. The three movies to date have grossed over l.7 billion dollars.\n\nIn 2009, his client, three-time American League MVP, NY Yankees third baseman, and baseball giant, Alex Rodriguez, won his first World Series Championship.\n\nOseary co-manages YouTube singing sensation, 13 year-old Greyson Michael Chance. Chance's performance of Lady Gaga's \"Paparazzi\" has had 50 million views on YouTube with no signs of slowing down. He is currently recording his debut CD for Ellen Degeneres' new record label ElevenEleven.\n\nNBC's Last Call with Carson Daly, now in its tenth year, is executive produced by Oseary along with NBC's New Year's Eve - also hosted by Daly.\n\nSince 2004, Oseary has been a principal at the top entertainment management company, Untitled Entertainment (in partnership with Jason Weinberg and Stephanie Simon). The firm oversees a roster of clients including Hilary Swank, David Caruso, Penelope Cruz, Naomi Watts, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lucy Liu, and Blake Lively amongst others.\n\nIn early 2010, Oseary became an adviser to Vita Coco, the coconut water brand company. He brought on board an investment group including Madonna, Demi Moore, Anthony Kiedis and Matthew McCounaghey. Vita Coco currently has a 70 percent market share for coconut water in the US with sales continuing to surge monthly.\n\nOseary has signed on as an advisor to Groupon.com. Forbes proclaimed the company as \"the fastest-growing company in web history.\" In April 2010, at just 17 months old, Groupon's valuation was l.35 billion dollars.\n\nIn partnership with Madonna, Oseary formed MDG Icon, a joint venture with Iconix Brand Group which focuses on fashion and apparel projects. The first collection under MDG is a sunglass collection designed by Madonna in collaboration with designer duo Dolce and Gabanna. The first apparel collection, Material Girl, is a fast fashion junior line designed by Madonna and her daughter sold exclusively in all Macy's stores.\n\nOseary has written two books and has had two photography books published."
