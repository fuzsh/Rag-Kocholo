        "text": "Everybody Hates the Guidance Counselor\n\nAfter Chris tests poorly on a standard exam, his teacher, Ms. Morello, refers him to the school's guidance counselor, Mr. Abbott. Although Chris tries to explain that the whole situation is a big mistake and he didn't understand the importance of the test, Mr. Abbott puts him through a series of mental evaluations and eventually determines that Chris must attend a remedial class.\n\nThe Devils Are Here\n\nSeason Two picks up three months after the shocking arrest and incarceration of Empire Entertainment head LUCIOUS LYON. Still in federal lockup, Lucious is trying to run Empire from inside, while a headline-grabbing state prosecutor hangs her political ambitions on bringing him down â no matter what it takes. Meanwhile, Cookie stages a star-studded #FreeLucious concert in his support, while scheming with Andre, Hakeem, Anika and the business savvy Mimi Whiteman to finalize the hostile takeover of Empire.\n\nTraffic Jam\n\nInspired by an African-American comic who teaches at the traffic school Hank is attending, Bobby takes his own White Nationalist comedy to a downtown comedy club.\n\nMochalatta Chills\n\nAbbi finally gets the opportunity to train someone at Soulstice, and Ilana hires a group of interns to make a sale for her at Deals Deals Deals."
