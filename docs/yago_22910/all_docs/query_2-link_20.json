        "text": "I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE is the story of Richard (Chris Rock) and his wife Brenda (Gina Torres), a career minded couple whose marriage is threatened by the husband renewing a friendship with Nikki (Kerry Washington), a woman more beautiful and exciting than his wife. The movie contrasts the boredom that can occur in marriage against the excitement available in relationships where responsibility is not considered important.\n\nThe movie rightly shows that brief irresponsible behavior can threaten the rewards earned through years of responsible behavior. Sadly, almost all of the characters in the movie are exceedingly foul mouthed, and one, who supposedly has a “solid marriage,” is grossly unfaithful.\n\nThe movie places a primary emphasis on sexual desires and is marred by 96 obscenities, most being the “f” word used in discussions about sex. It also contains smoking, drug and alcohol use, and dishonest speech and behavior.\n\nLove is not just a warm, happy feeling. It is a commitment. The warm happy aspects of love are more likely to be evidenced if the underlying commitment is rock solid. One scene in I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE makes this point well. When Brenda suspects Richard of having had an affair, this otherwise attractive woman’s countenance changes. A wild boar with teeth protruding up from the jawbone would look more attractive than this woman who thinks she’s been two-timed. Bad behavior turns love into VERY hard work.\n\nBy living up to the commitments of marriage and putting your spouse before yourself, love can flourish like seeds in good moist soil. Selfishness, anger and distrust are like poison to a marriage. Trust is earned. If lost, it takes time to earn it back. When you are watching movies, surfing the Internet, at the office or looking through magazines, ask yourself, “What would my spouse think of what I’m doing?” Better yet, ask yourself, “What does God think of what I’m doing?” Your spouse is not with you every minute of your life, but God is.\n\nThe ultimate way to love your spouse is to love and obey God. God, who witnessed your marriage commitment, will lead you to love your spouse is ways that make for the happiest of marriages. Obey God and you will stay out of debt (a big problem in many marriages). Obey God and infidelity will not even be a temptation. Obey God and He will teach you how best to show love, after all, He’s the author of love.\n\nDon’t bother seeing I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE. Spend some time alone with God and ask Him to help you KNOW you love your wife. He’ll give you great insights without all the nasty gutter talk."
