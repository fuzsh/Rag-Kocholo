        "text": "Chris Rock will star in and co-write a \"re-imagining\" of the British comedy Death at a Funeral that hit theaters last year. For those who've never heard anything about the film, not only was it my favorite comedy of last year, but it was one of the films featured on my controversial Best 19 Movies You Didn't See in 2007 list. Instead of a direct remake (thankfully!), Rock and company are planning to simply steal the concept - an ensemble comedy about a funeral ceremony that leads to the digging up of shocking family secrets, as well as misplaced cadavers and indecent exposure. How's that for originality in Hollywood - instead of a remake, they just steal the concept and \"honor\" the original by crediting it as the inspiration.\n\nCo-writing with Rock is fellow \"Everybody Hates Chris\" writer Aeysha Carr. The same production company that made the original, Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, is back again producing this version. They're currently looking for a director and are hoping to start up production next spring. Even if they find a good director, I'm seriously opposed to this. It's very rare that I instantly have a negative opinion towards a new project, but this time I'll make an exception. Death at a Funeral is an incredibly underrated comedy classic and to see it only get exposure in a re-imagining isn't too exciting. I'd rather suggest people forget about this news (for now) and take a moment to rent or buy Death at a Funeral as soon as they can - it's worth it!"
