        "text": "A movie review by Mike Moreau\n\nChris Rock’s “I Think I Love My Wife” is a film in which you don’t gain anything by seeing it and don’t lose anything by skipping it. While that might not sound good, this combination may be what makes this film work, to a certain extent.\n\nThe fact is that “Wife” is a breezy, not -good-but-not-bad type of movie. You’ve probably seen movies like this before. It is a rare beast posing a strange dilemma: There is no reason to rag on it but there’s also no reason to really recommend it.\n\n“Wife” isn’t a movie that sticks. You’ll probably brush the experience off without guilt, without remorse and without losing any sense of dignity right after leaving the theater. Okay, maybe the Viagra scene will stick but I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nRichard Cooper (Rock) is a married man. He has a beautiful wife (Gina Torres), cute kids and a picture-perfect house; his life seems picture-perfect. However, within the first five minutes we find out it’s not. I’m bored out of my f***ing mind Cooper says.\n\nThe problem is simple: Cooper is in desperate need of sex and his wife just won’t give in. Plus, their life is somewhat uninspired. I guess the same can be said about the movie as a whole; it’s devoid of any real spark or pizzazz. Anyway, a hot little number pops into Cooper’s office one day and the story goes from there.\n\nIn this post-“Borat” and “Jackass” world, it feels like comedies will only reach higher into the most extreme regions of outrageousness. Gross-out comedies are what people want these days; the movie companies know about people’s fascination with the wild and grotesque.\n\nRock is known for his racial-tinged commentary and “I don’t care what you think” mentality so it seemed like he might lean towards the gross-out factor for this movie. There are some traces of his stand-up here but is Rock starting to care about what people think? I wanted more shock and ugliness (in a good way) in this movie. Maybe I’ve become too accustomed to offensive (also in a good way) comedies like “Borat” and “40 Year-Old Virgin.” I just thought Rock would bring more of that formula to “Wife.” Oh well.\n\n“Wife” is Rock’s baby. He co-writes, directs and stars in it. Why does it feel so tame then? Yes, the movie is about sex, and there are a couple racy scenes but there should be more.\n\nOkay, I lied. It seems like I am ragging on the film even though I said there was no reason to. To make up for that, I’ll point out the good stuff. There are some gross-out funny moments that audiences want and have come to expect like the aforementioned Viagra scene. Other, tamer funny moments include dialogue focusing on the king of pop Michael Jackson and a slightly odd singing scene.\n\nUnlike Cooper, you won’t be bored out of your mind while watching the movie. There will be no checking of the time or closing of the eyes. It’s nice to see Rock playing a sort-of smart and normal person in the movie. This isn’t the same Rock we’ve come to know. He has, dare I say it, matured. The grown up feeling might be what keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Or it might put some people off expecting the old Rock. This is a rare side of Rock; he’s a different animal.\n\nIf you don’t like the movie, you probably won’t go as far as saying you hate it. Why? It has a warm and fuzzy feel-good vibe to it. Who wants to pick on something warm and fuzzy? The flaws are there but so is a feeling of sincerity and harmlessness that grabs you.\n\nSo maybe I was wrong with what I said earlier. You just might gain something from the film. It could be that toasty feeling you get when sitting by a warm fire with family or some extra calories from that big tub ‘o buttery popcorn. My guess is the last one."
