While at SNL he appeared in films New Jack City, Boomerang and CB4, which he also wrote and produced.

He developed, wrote, produced and narrated the sitcom Everybody Hates Chris (2005-2009), which was based on his early life. From 1997 to 2000 HBO aired his talk show, The Chris Rock Show, which gained critical acclaim for Rock's interviews with celebrities and politicians.\n\nRock was cast in starring film roles in Nurse Betty (1999), Down to Earth, Pootie Tang (both 2001), Head of State (2003), The Longest Yard (2005), the Madagascar film series (2005–2012), I Think I Love My Wife (2007), Death at a Funeral, Grown Ups (both 2010), its sequel Grown Ups 2 (2013), Top Five (2014) and Spiral (2021).

He hosted the Academy Awards twice; in 2005 and 2016, and was involved in an incident on stage at the 2022 Awards.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nChristopher Julius Rock was born in Andrews, South Carolina on February 7, 1965.[3][4] Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. A few years later, they relocated and settled in the working class area of Bedford–Stuyvesant.[5] His mother, Rosalie (née Tingman), was a teacher and social worker for the mentally handicapped; his father, Julius Rock, was a truck driver and newspaper deliveryman.[6] Julius died in 1988 after ulcer surgery.[3]\n\nRock is the eldest of his parents' seven children (six boys and one girl),[7] and he had an older paternal half-brother, Charles Ledell Rock, who died in 2006 after suffering from alcoholism.[8][9] Rock's younger brothers Tony,[10] Kenny,[11] and Jordan[12] are also in the entertainment business.\n\nRock's family history was profiled on the PBS series African American Lives 2 in 2008. A DNA test showed that he is of Cameroonian descent, specifically from the Udeme (Ouldémé) people of northern Cameroon.[13] Rock's great-great-grandfather, Julius Caesar Tingman, was enslaved for 21 years before serving in the American Civil War as part of the United States Colored Troops. During the 1940s, Rock's paternal grandfather moved from South Carolina to New York City to become a taxicab driver and preacher.[14]\n\nRock was bused to schools in predominantly white neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where he endured bullying and beatings from white students.[15][16][17] As he grew older, the bullying worsened and Rock's parents pulled him out of James Madison High School.[17] He dropped out of high school altogether, but he later earned a General Educational Development (GED). Rock then worked various jobs at fast-food restaurants.[15][16]\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly work[]\n\nRock began working as a stand-up comic during 1984 in New York City's Catch a Rising Star.[15] Upon seeing his act at a nightclub, Eddie Murphy befriended and mentored the aspiring comic. Murphy gave Rock his first film role and big break in Beverly Hills Cop II.[18] Rock rose up the ranks of the comedy circuit in addition to earning bit roles in the film I'm Gonna Git You Sucka and the TV series Miami Vice.\n\nSaturday Night Live and stand-up success[]\n\nFilm[]\n\n1990s[]\n\n2000s[]\n\n2010s[]\n\nEverybody Hates Chris (2005–2009)[]\n\nAcademy Awards[]\n\n2005 ceremony[]\n\n2016 ceremony[]\n\n2022 ceremony[]\n\nMusic videos[]\n\nStage play[]\n\nComedic style and views[]\n\nRock's subject matter typically involves family, politics, romance, music, celebrities, and race relations in the United States. Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in Bensonhurst. In his memoir Rock This, he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"[19]\n\nRock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 Roll With The New show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculousTemplate:Tsp[[[:Template:Hsp]].Template:Hsp.Template:Hsp. of] course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling Jerry Seinfeld he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselvesTemplate:Tsp[[[:Template:Hsp]].Template:Hsp.Template:Hsp. nowadays,] you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\"[20] Often the subject of tabloids, when asked about paparazzi and the other negative aspects of fame, Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: \"You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips.\"[21]\n\nAt the London Live Earth concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the BBC, before introducing the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rock called the crowd \"motherfuckers\" and said \"shit\", and after a brief pause said he was joking. Due to the broadcast being at 5:45Template:Nbspp.m., Rock was immediately cut off, and the BBC made several apologies for his use of the word \"motherfucker\".[22]\n\nChris Rock has been an avid fan of the New York Mets baseball team since childhood. He complained that his team \"had no money\" during a 2011 interview with David Letterman.[23]\n\nDuring a 2008 rant on his Kill the Messenger tour, Rock labeled George W. Bush as \"the worst president ever\".[24]\n\nIn May 2021, Rock voiced opposition to cancel culture.[25][26][27][28][29] He said that it has led to \"boring\" and \"unfunny\" material from comedians.[25][26][27] He also commented that there is an existing built-in mechanism for audiences informing comedians that their content does not work, like the audience not laughing at their jokes.[25][26][27] Rock went on to say \"Everybody's scared to make a move. That's not a place to be. You know, we should have the right to fail because failureTemplate:Tsp.Template:Hsp.Template:Hsp. failure is a part of art.\"[25]\n\nRock has said that he was influenced by the performing style of his paternal grandfather, Allen Rock, a preacher. Rock's comedy influences are Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, Flip Wilson, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Pigmeat Markham, Woody Allen, Bill Maher, Eddie Murphy,[30] Sam Kinison, George Carlin, Mort Sahl,[31] and Rodney Dangerfield.[32]\n\nComedians who have cited Rock as an influence include Dave Chappelle,[31] Christian Finnegan,[33] George Lopez,[34] Kevin Hart,[35] and Trevor Noah.[36]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nRock married Malaak Compton-Rock on November 23, 1996.[37] Compton-Rock is the founder and executive director of StyleWorks, a non-profit, full-service hair salon that provides free services for women leaving welfare and entering the workforce.[37] The couple lived in Alpine, New Jersey[38][39] with their two daughters.[3] In December 2014, Rock filed for divorce from Compton-Rock.[40] Rock admitted to infidelity in the marriage, as well as struggling with a pornography addiction.[41] The divorce was finalized on August 22, 2016.[42]\n\nRock has campaigned against the racial profiling of African-Americans, and often speaks of the everyday racism he experiences “despite being famous”.[43][44] In a 2013 episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld, Rock and Seinfeld are pulled over by the police for speeding while Seinfeld was driving. In the episode Rock admits to Seinfeld that \"If you weren't here, I'd be scared. Yeah, I'm famous – still black.\"[45] In 2015, Rock was pulled over three times in the first three months of the year. Each time Rock posted a selfie of the incident, without further comment as to the reason for the stops or whether he was issued a citation.[46]\n\nOn August 20, 2019, Rock, along with several other celebrities, invested in a funding round for Lowell Herb Co, a California cannabis brand. He is known to be \"a dedicated cannabis consumer\".[47]\n\nOn September 18, 2020, Rock said that he was diagnosed with a non-verbal learning disorder, a neurological condition that makes it difficult for him to understand non-verbal social cues.[48][49][50]\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Rock announced on Twitter that he had been tested positive for COVID-19. He strongly advocated getting vaccinated to his followers.[51]\n\nOn July 7, 2022 it was reported that Rock had started dating actress, screenwriter and director Lake Bell.[52]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nMain article(s): Chris Rock filmography\n\nDiscography[]\n\nComedy albums\n\nBorn Suspect (Atlantic Records, 1991)\n\nRoll with the New (DreamWorks Records, 1997)\n\nBigger & Blacker (DreamWorks Records, 1999)\n\nNever Scared (DreamWorks Records/Geffen Records, 2004)\n\nTamborine (Netflix Studios, LLC., 2018)\n\nStandup specials\n\nChris Rock: Big Ass Jokes (released on HBO, 1994)\n\nChris Rock: Bring the Pain (released on HBO, 1996)\n\nChris Rock: Bigger & Blacker (released on HBO, 1999)\n\nChris Rock: Never Scared (released on HBO, 2004)\n\nChris Rock: Kill the Messenger (released on HBO, 2008)\n\nChris Rock: Tamborine (released on Netflix 2018)\n\nAwards and nominations[]\n\nMain article(s): List of awards and nominations received by Chris Rock\n\nBook[]\n\nRock This!
