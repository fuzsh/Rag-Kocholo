And former “Weekend Update” hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers have brought their skills poking fun at current events to their roles as hosts of The Tonight Show and Late Night, respectively.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter takes a look back at 32 former SNL castmembers that have become household names, parlaying their time on the long-running variety show into film and TV stardom."
