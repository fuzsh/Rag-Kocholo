        "text": "Is there any genre that has aged worse than late 60s early 70s studio sex comedies? Caught between old Hollywood and the new freedom they come across like smutty episodes of Love American Style. This is a film that has been on my wish list forever - I worship Gould and love Mel Stuart. Willy Wonka and Wattstax are masterpieces. But this falls flat. What was hip masculinity back in the day now seems piggish... although by the end of the film the movie seems to realize this. The last scene is powerful. And love the throwaway moment of newly separated Brenda Vaccaro briefly appearing as a blonde... just a small change that makes you feel her underwritten character attempting to find her way in a new world. Supporting characters pop - Angel Tompkins and Dabney Coleman make strong impressions.\n\n13th Marlboro Film\n\n(Happy Belated Birthday)\n\nFor some reason, this film sounded rather interesting. Oh it sounded like a Marlboro sorta thing, and with a little help from FilmStreet, I bagged the film just in time for his birthday, well tried to.\n\nThe film says it's a comedy, oh it's so funny, I forgot to laugh. My skin almost crawled too much during it, and I really wasn't liking that fact of being reminded of Second marriages, and why they exist. Although I did seem to have a fun time accepting some cannon ideas for Marlboro himself, before coming to the conclusion of. This really was your typical Marlboro behavior, and I'm like, well, I liked some really strange men at times.\n\n2/5, I think I know why Sterling Hayden was the right man to introduce this man.\n\n\"Crazy Lady! Crazy Lady!\" Says Marlboro"
