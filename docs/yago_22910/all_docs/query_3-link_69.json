        "text": "First off allow me to take this moment to shout out Shonda Rhimes. This is a well written show with a great cast. Chicago is proud of you!!\n\nNow..For the past 2 months or so Thursday has been a busy day on social networks. Scandal hash-tags fill my timelines. My original intent was not to watch this show. However, my curiosity got the best of me. I was able to catch up on the first and second season up to the part where Fitz (President) is shot.\n\nI admit I have my reservations about this show. The love triangle in its most basic sense concerns me. I also have issue with this ‚Äújob‚Äù that Mellie (First Lady) thinks that Liv (Fixer) does with respect to the presidency‚Ä¶‚Ä¶anyway‚Ä¶Im not going to get all hyper historical and political and righteous..lets get to the real subject at hand‚Ä¶\n\n***SPOILER ALERT****\n\nHuck DID NOT shoot Fitz.\n\nThe final scene ends with Huck (Ex Cia Spy/Hacker) scooping up bullets off of a chair with gun in hand to give the viewer the impression that he just shot Fitz. IM NOT GOIN!!\n\nThis show does a great job at moving around a lot of pieces. Sometimes information can get lost in the shuffle. The one thing I notice is that the main characters stay consistent with respect to who they are.\n\nClearly Huck is a spy who has committed heinous crimes in the name of the government. He has a very particular set of skills; skills that he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that will make a nightmare for most people. HA!‚Ä¶ Shout Out To Liam Neeson and ‚ÄúTaken‚Äù\n\nHuck is on the road to redemption. He finds enjoyment in his work. He understands that there is something wrong with it. He joins Alcohol Anonymous to work on his addiction to ‚ÄúWhiskey‚Äù. He meets a girl‚Ä¶she doesn‚Äôt mind that hes a weirdo. He made an impassioned speech to save the life of a fellow spy (It didn‚Äôt work). He turned a corner.\n\nThe one murder he should have committed he didn‚Äôt do. These ex CIA spies have some type of keen sixth sense. Huck knew something was going to happen after listening to the static on the radio and went there to stop it. He got there too late and had to rush out before he was spotted.\n\n‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the episode previous to this one Charlie (Ex CIA Spy) comes back into town after being ‚Äúinstructed‚Äù to leave by Huck. Charlie makes a call to one of his many clients and mentions he is ready to get back to work (killing people).\n\nI know who shot Fitz.\n\nCharlie shot Fitz for Hollis Doyle (Rich Guy) in order for him to regain his influence in the White House. Sally Langston (Vice President) and Quinn were in on it.\n\nWhat do you think?

How do you know when you have found yours? Have you found yours?‚Äù What I love about doing this blog aside from being able to promote the release of my Ep ‚ÄúLadies Love Mixtapes‚Äù is that so many of the responses I get are so honest and no one is pulling any punches. I never knew that there were so many different perspectives to the idea of a soulmate. Who knew that you could have met your soulmate and it does not have to be romantic. Thank you to all of you who took time to answer last weeks question.\n\nThis weeks question was presented to me by Ashley Webb. Here it is‚Ä¶..\n\nQuestion\n\nHow do you know when the person you are with is the one?\n\nAshley is either looking for the one, or she has found the one. AWESOME either way. Check out a few comments below. Post comments. Im curious as to what you may think. üôÇ\n\nYolanda said: ‚ÄúWhen you love them for their perfections and flaws. They become your best friend and you can‚Äôt go a day without thinking about them and hearing their voice. You just know‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n\nFabian said: ‚ÄúWhen that person fills in every part of you life that was empty and makes you better than before.‚Äù\n\nCamrin said: ‚ÄúHmmm, I believe I will know if the person is the one by the way they treat me not only while I am in their presence but also when we are not together. Is he just as attentive as he was when we first met? Is he selfless and appreciative in the relationship. Will he make me smile more than he would make me cry. I believe ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for me is not perfect but he would be the perfect one for me.‚Äù\n\nTanisha said: ‚ÄúSo my disclaimer is that the answer to this question is currently still being defined and I know many may find too esoteric. However, ‚Äúthe one‚Äù? Im not even sure there is One. My simple answer is you cant know the one until you know who you really are. True love is not selective or exclusive. Exclusivity is not the love of God but ego. I think there is a perfect and divine mate for everyone and for me, you will know your true mate when you stop seeking. Seeking is the antitheses to happiness but most important when he reveals himself you instantly recognize yourself in the other. This is a big statement because so many of us don‚Äôt really know who we are? Everything I covet, love, trust, security and 100 other things I have to realize reside in me. You allow ‚Äúthe one‚Äù to come into your life because there is no ego, desire and wanting. The one will give me joy which arises within me vs. pure pleasure that can only be obtained in some seeking outside of me or through someone else.‚Äù\n\nPam said: ‚ÄúMy Guy has my back , through good times and bad I know he is the One!!!!‚Äù\n\nFrom my perspective I would say the person who accepts you for who you are totally is the one. I would venture to say that we have all entered into relationships with our ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù painting the best possible picture of who we are. However we all have quirks and imperfections. Im all about building a partnership and a team. We have to know who we are inside and out. Only the ONE will be able understand this. Thats just a bit of my 2 cents. I am more interested in what you think.

How do you do it?‚Äù I can tell by many of the responses and the comments that I read that our children are paramount in our lives. We should take precaution when involving them in our relationships. Many of the choices we make for our own lives affect our children deeply. Thank you to all of you who took the time to answer last weeks question.\n\nThis weeks question comes from my cousin Cool V. I think thats awesome because the ladies have been asking fo some input by the gentleman. So‚Ä¶Here it is!!‚Ä¶..\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat is your idea of a soulmate? How do you know when you have found them? Have you found your soulmate?\n\nCool V has had the privilege of finding his soulmate. WAY TO GO CUZ!!! Check out a few comments below. Leave comments. Im curious to read what you think. üôÇ\n\nEbonie said: ‚ÄúTo me I think people misconstrue what a real soul mate is. To me it‚Äôs not a perfect person it‚Äôs not the perfect man is the person who takes all of your fault and looks at you for who you are and said I still want to be with that person I can be with that person forever no matter what if they‚Äôd never changed from this day forth that is the person for me. And vise versa. Everything in your being attractions to this person no matter if they make you mad one day piss you off to next that person is forever connected to you by some type of force and if it‚Äôs not something that you can let go. You will fight to the ends of the earth to stay with this person. And that person will also fight for you. What you lack they make up and vise versa. That‚Äôs my take on it.‚Äù\n\nDanita said: ‚ÄúMy idea of a soul mate is someone who you honestly are not seeking out but someone who lives you for who you are. The love that is shared may be unknown to the woman but as it says in the Bible‚Ä¶a man is suppose to seek his wife and not the other way around. You have to be patient and wait. You can not rush or try to make someone your soul mate. It‚Äôs natural!!‚Äù\n\nCharlene said: ‚ÄúGood question. I believe you will just know. It is something I can‚Äôt put into words. I believe in soul mates only because I have seen people so connected to each other they must be soul mates.‚Äù\n\nGwen said: ‚ÄúA soulmate is someone who is totally connected to you mentally physically and emotionally. You know you have found that person when they instinctively know what and how you are feeling as do you there is an ease of communication..and yes i have found mine.‚Äù\n\nCarmella said: ‚ÄúOur souls must be connected to God in order to be directed to our Soulmate. You must both put God first in order to Love each other! Remember God Is Love! I knew I found mine when his love for God was as deep as mine! I also believe the eyes are the key to our souls and the truth. No matter our differences our flaws we will stay strong as long as our foundation (Which is God) can not be destroyed. What God put together may no man tear under! So stop looking for perfect love in imperfect people and let him lead the way!‚Äù\n\nI love that these ladies are being so honest. As for me, at one time I thought that I did find my soulmate.However I was mistaken. I still believe they do exist. Sometimes I think I forced the issue as if I wanted this person to be ment for me so bad that they had to be my soulmate. I must admit I am kind of a romantic at heart. What I think is important is that the idea of the search has to be eliminated. I feel as though we are always connected to the people that we should be connected to. The moment that we come across the one who is the mate for our souls, our soul will tell us. I get excited just thinking about that moment.

The number one deal breaker is LYING. To be honest I was surprised I didn‚Äôt see anyone mention money. Im learning more and more each week. Sometimes are expectations maybe totally different from what people are actually thinking.\n\nI sent out a few messages asking for a good question for this week and I got flooded with great ones. I could only choose one. Dont worry‚Ä¶Ill be using the others for the coming weeks.\n\nThis weeks question comes from Sondra. She asks ‚ÄúWhen is it the right time to introduce your mate to your children? How do you do it?‚Äù\n\nI cant wait to see the answers for this one. Children are always a sensitive subject. By the way Ladies, invite the men over to participate. Share this blog on your FB, Twitter and Google +. Lets build this dialogue.\n\nQuestion\n\nWhen is the right time to introduce your mate to your children? How do you do it?\n\nThis one is going to be interesting‚Ä¶.check out a few comments below. Leave comments. Im curious to read what you think. üôÇ\n\nRachel said: ‚ÄúBeing a single mom and their sole provider its hard not to introduce your kids to someone especially since they‚Äôd be at your home. However I don‚Äôt allow them to see any sort of affection or spend time with that person. Does that make sense? I don‚Äôt want a bond to develop or them to see lots of guys hugging or kissing their mom.‚Äù\n\nRhonda said: ‚ÄúThe right time to introduce your mate to your children is when the two of you have been dating for a while depending on how the relationship is going I would say 6 mths. If you have small children try a public place to see how they interact with the kids and if your children are older maybe over dinner‚Äù\n\nMaria said: ‚ÄúThat all depends on the children ages. If you have very small children/ toddlers, I would only bring my mate around when they‚Äôre not present. I would only have male company when they were asleep or visiting their dad for the weekend. If you have older kids/ grade school age, I would first introduce them in a group setting, fam function, family outing, something like that where there‚Äôs already a lot of other people around so its not so intimate and obvious. If you have teenagers/ high schoolers, it is what it is, I would say: ‚Äúthis is such and such, we‚Äôre going to dinner, be right back‚Äù (no explanation really needed).‚Äù\n\nFaith said: ‚ÄúThis is a toughy. U shouldn‚Äôt introduce your mate to your children unless you are certain that you want your mate to be a permanent part of your life. I think You should gradually acclimate your mate to your kids. No forced bonding. A little time here, a little time there.‚Äù\n\nI know there are going to be some interesting answers to this.

Once you are blessed to meet the person who can meet a majority of what you seek and can add joy to your life you must cherish them. I know Im not the only one who has been on this ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for a while. I have been in a few relationships and we have parted ways for a number of reasons. Most times we separate is because of something that either of us could not tolerate. A #DealBreaker.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat do you consider a deal breaker in a relationship?\n\nIm anticipating some great answers to this‚Ä¶check out a few below. Leave comments. Im curious to read what you think? üôÇ\n\nNakisha said: ‚ÄúThe deal breaker for me is allowing me to be with u and u never really wanted to be with me, and lying not giving me a choice.\n\nCarita said: ‚ÄúNo comprise and not wanting children.‚Äù\n\nShaquira said: ‚ÄúThis could be a good or bad thing but truthfully, a deal breaker would be the fact that the attraction is not there anymore, and this maybe selfish but maybe the relationship is just not what you want anymore.‚Äù\n\nThe Pr Guru said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt date man with kids, who smokes,gambles and drinks excessively! My type of man is a manly man sort of speak! Lol he takes charge and wears the pants and goes beyond to make me feel loved and safe!‚Äù\n\nI know there are going to be some interesting answers to this.

His smell and dress excite me to look even more forward to who walks beyond this presentation. He opens doors, has me walk on the inside, everything done as a gentleman would. Upon driving away, immediately he lets me know that he knows his music because the sounds of Eric Roberson and Frank McComb are the background to our conversation to dinner. We eat over live jazz. He‚Äôs attentive, he listens, then responds accordingly. Steppin‚Äô our little 2-step afterward could reveal physical chemistry that compliments our comfort and conversation thus far. And at this point he has referenced several things he‚Äôs noticed about me, but have never left my lips to his ears. We then leave to to walk the lakefront to just enjoy each others company. We talk music, politics, God, and a few ‚ÄúWhen I was little‚Ä¶‚Äù stories. He brings me home, showing that he expects nothing in return, but expresses how we must do this again. We hug just before I go inside. :-)‚Äù\n\nShyi said:\n\n‚ÄúA man that knocks on the door when he picks me up. Looking nice with a rose be it white or red. Dinner at a nice restaurant. Dancing. Something like reggae or romantic like salsa. Or see sum belly dancing or a belly dancing class where she can show a sexy side. A walk in the park. Then talking on the way home as he walks me to the door. Gives me a kiss on the cheek or forehead.‚Äù\n\nOpinions vary on this one. I would love to hear what you think.\n\nFeel free to answer in the comments.\n\nCheck out the single from ‚ÄúLadies Love Mixtapes the Ep‚Äù called ‚ÄúTake Our Time (Right Away) below"
