        "text": "DinkyDev\n\nThe Movie Critic\n\nFeb 5, 2021\n\n6,494\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#1\n\nUniversal Pictures is gearing up to tell a definitive cinematic biopic about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. The studio has optioned the rights to adapt Jonathan Eig's critically acclaimed biography King: A Life. Chris Rock is in final talks to direct and produce, and Steven Spielberg will be executive producer.\n\nThe film will be produced by Amblin Partners, with Kristie Macosko Krieger serving as producer along with Rock. King: A Life has been a big bestseller, and is nominated for the National Book Award. It has been hailed as a definitive biography of the civil rights icon Dr. King, for its use of previously untapped sources that include newly declassified FBI information. The book sketches out the courageous man who demanded peaceful protests in the segregationist south, all the while grappling with his own frailties and a federal government that haunted his every step instead of treating him like the hero history shows him to be.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for the talented Rock to put being the recipient of \"the Oscar slap\" squarely in the rearview mirror. Rock co-stars in the George C. Wolfe-directed Rustin, which stars Colman Domingo as Bayard Rustin, the man who organized the 1963 march on Washington, where Dr. King made his iconic \"I have a dream\" speech that galvanized the battle to desegregate the south. In Rustin, Rock plays the pivotal role of Roy Wilkins, the NAACP leader who reluctantly embraced Rustin's efforts and made the march possible. That film's produced by Higher Ground for Netflix.\n\nUniversal Sets Martin Luther King Jr Movie For Chris Rock To Direct & Steven Spielberg Executive Produce; Uni Acquires Jonathan Eig’s ‘King: A Life’\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Universal Pictures is gearing up to tell a definitive cinematic biopic about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. The studio has optioned the rights to adapt Jonathan Eig’s critically accl…\n\nHollywood Duo\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n45,434\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#3\n\nRock gonna go from doing cornball shit like the paw patrol movie to directing an MLK movie.

It would have been an outright scandal if anyone other than a Black person directed the project, so I can't really knock him too much for doing just that in the end. That said, considering the sheer gravitas of the subject matter, I would have loved to see Steve McQueen get the chance to tackle the material as I'd know he wouldn't skimp on the more radical elements of King's messaging, but I also imagine that he and Spielberg would get on like oil and water in terms of how wildly opposed their sensibilities are and I can't imagine that relationship working at all. There's nothing in Rock's output that suggests he's got something special in him for a project like this to really shine, but I fear that may in fact be the point of why he got hired for the gig, since he's not going to do anything too wild with bringing this story to life.\n\nLumination\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n13,390\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#31\n\nHaving Chris Rock direct this feels like, \"We need a Black person here, who knows somebody?\" vibes.\n\nFlame Lord\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n2,884\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#32\n\nNot so much in the traditional sense but take his character in Madagascar.

I don't doubt his intentions were good and pure, the final product being very clear on that, but that film is way too glossy and pristine for the story that he's trying to tell and he had a particularly bad instinct to try and have a \"look on the bright side\" kind of approach to contrasting the drama that gets into the ugly side of domestic life for Blacks in that time that winds up undermining a lot of that drama. And that's not even getting into how much the film whitewashes the fuck out of the queerness at the heart of the relationship between Celie and Shug, which even he has admitted to being ill-equipped to telling in the years since. It is undeniably a well-made film, Spielberg had amazing instincts for casting both Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey before anyone knew who they were, and it is absolutely a milestone for Black representation on film since it was a major drama that got all the resources it needed, but it's also a flawed adaptation on an inherent level simply because of who made it.\n\nSanjuro\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n32,321\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#49\n\nThe real question is why do people like Chris Rock?\n\nHe's one of the most iconic comedians of our lifetime?"
