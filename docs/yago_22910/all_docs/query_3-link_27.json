        "text": "This review was written for the theatrical release of “I Think I Love My Wife.”\n\nIn “I Think I Love My Wife,” Chris Rock does something entirely unexpected. He isn’t funny.\n\nNo doubt Rock — who directed, co-wrote, co-produced and stars in the comedy — is trying to stretch. He is not thoroughly convincing as a buppie, married with children, but you would feel much better about the role if his mischievous sense of humor had come along. When Edward Herrmann has the most amusing line, something is seriously wrong.\n\nPlaying a henpecked, straightforward investment banker unable to make any move whatsoever with a gorgeous and willing dream girl is not what Chris Rock’s fan base will expect. Again, if he were funny, that might not matter. Because he is not, boxoffice for this Fox Searchlight release might suffer.\n\nRock insists that his film is based on the last film of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales, “Chloe in the Afternoon,” a French New Wave film made 35 years ago. Actually all he borrows is the premise: A happily married, bourgeois businessman daydreams about other women but has no intention of following through on any of these afternoon delights. Then an old friend, a former girlfriend of a buddy from the past, drops by his office with seduction on her mind.\n\nThere are a couple of odds things even about how the premise develops in this movie, however. For one, if Rock’s Richard Cooper is as happily married as he says he is, why does wife Brenda (Gina Torres) refuse to have sex with him, and why is the couple in therapy? Also, what kind of “old friend” is Kerry Washington’s Nikki? When Richard was sowing his wild oats as a young man in his 20s, Nikki would have been in junior high.\n\nBut never mind the details; let’s go looking for laughs.\n\nAfter re-entering his life, Nikki appears at Richard’s office at all hours in outfits more appropriate for nightclubbing. Before you know it, he goes AWOL on clients and associates as Nikki leads him around town by his, um, nose. But they remain just friends. So far, all situation no comedy.\n\nOne night, Nikki persuades Richard to slip away from home for a rendezvous at a nightclub. She never turns up, and he gets stoned with a couple of salesgirls. No yucks here.\n\nAnother time, Nikki forces Richard to accompany her on a shuttle flight to D.C. to sneak her things out of the apartment of a soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend. The boyfriend arrives home unexpectedly, smacks Richard around, the police arrive, and shots are fired. No laughs here. Worse, there are no repercussions: Richard and Nikki slip out the door without the police noticing they fled the scene.\n\nThe sole dramatic tension in the story stems from the will-they-or-won’t-they question that hovers over the Richard-Nikki relationship. Few are going to care as character motivation is seriously lacking in a script Rock wrote with Louis C.K.\n\nWhy don’t the married couple have sex? Brenda seems to love her man, and she certainly fights to keep him. Why after all these years does Nikki turn up? She seems to have nothing more on her mind than playing him for all he’s worth. For that matter, why does Richard seem terrified of all women, even his secretary?\n\nThe script could have developed genuine inner conflict in its hero — a family man devoted to his young children but with a frigid wife and possibly a hot mistress — but never does. All of which leaves the three main actors playing very tentative characters. There is clarity with two of Rock’s office comrades: Steve Buscemi as a womanizing married man and Herrmann as a stuffy boss. But these fine character actors are wasted on such lightweight roles.\n\nAs a director, Rock has little visual flair, so the film looks clumsy and stilted. Solid location work in and around New York does give designer Sharon Lomofsky something to work with while Suzanne McCabe has fun with all the revealing and stylish costumes for Washington."
