        "text": "With decidedly mixed results. The equation of “I Think I Love My Wife” is familiar: Richard Cooper (Chris Rock, “Head of State”) is an investment banker who works in Manhattan and lives in the suburbs. He has a beautiful wife and two children, but his marriage has completely ceased to satisfy him. He spends his train rides and lunch breaks fantasizing about other women he sees around town – but even when Richard dreams about these women his pretend relationships end in marriage and the same ensuing boredom. What’s the message here? Marriage blows.\n\nAnd women suffer the brunt of it. Cooper’s wife, Brenda (Gina Torres, “Five Fingers”) is gorgeous but exhausted from raising two kids and working. To escape his boredom, Richard begins hanging out with an old friend’s flame who shows up at his office one day, Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington, “The Last King of Scotland”), a seductress without the sex.\n\nShe lets her outfits do a lot of the talking. Sexy, confident and subtle, Nikki is every guy’s dream; the first day Richard sees her she looks like she might be headed to the runway. She has the laughs to go along with the looks – we never cease to wonder whether or not they’ll do that other thing that’s been lacking in Cooper’s marriage.\n\nBrenda, on the other hand, epitomizes the boring wife. When Richard takes her to a car show on one of their weekend trips into Manhattan, she has a special moment (music, slow-mo shots and all) fantasizing about a minivan.\n\nUltimately, Richard’s struggle between these two women is borderline mind-boggling, considering that Chris Rock isn’t exactly dreamy. Unfortunately, after 90 minutes you don’t even really care who he ends up with.\n\n“I Think I Love My Wife” is Rock’s second effort as director, and he tries some new things – slow-motion shots, fantasy scenes, an eclectic soundtrack and a surprisingly pleasant, small role for Steve Buscemi as his sleazy friend. Rock tackles his trademark social issues – stereotypes and race in upper-class white society – with his usual blatant style, which he infuses throughout the film via his own voiceover narration. His signature style finally gets in the way, however. Rock can’t seem to accept that the film is in fact a drama.\n\nI Think I Love My Wife\n\nAt Quality 16 and Showcase\n\nFox Searchlight\n\nRating: 2 out of 5 stars"
