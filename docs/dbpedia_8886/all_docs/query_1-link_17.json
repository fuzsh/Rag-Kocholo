        "text": "Dallon James Weekes (born May 4, 1981) is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is best known for his roles as bassist, backing vocalist, and secondary songwriter/lyricist for Panic! at the Disco.\n\nWeekes was born in a small town in Verona, Missouri near a large Amish community. He is the second of four children and was raised in a Mormon family in Clearfield, Utah, where his parents moved shortly after he was born. Weekes attended Clearfield High School, where he met most of his former Brobecks bandmates. After graduating with honors in 1999, Weekes served as a full-time Mormon Missionary in Oklahoma for two years. After returning home he shortly attended Weber State University before dropping out to pursue music full-time.\n\nIn 2009, Weekes was hired to provide bass, synthesizer and back-up vocals for Panic! at the Disco on a temporary, touring basis. His ‘touring only’ status changed in mid-2010, while on tour with the band in China. It was then that he was asked by Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith to join them indefinitely. However, his permanent status within the band remained publicly unknown until Weekes confirmed in mid-2012 via Twitter his involvement with the band as a full-time member. During his tenure as a member of Panic! At The Disco Weekes was responsible for the conceptualization of the cover art for Vices And Virtues as well as being credited with writing on all but two songs on the bands fourth studio album Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die. In October 2015 Weekes tweeted that he will no longer be contributing to Panic! creatively."
