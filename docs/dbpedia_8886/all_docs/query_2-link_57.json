        "text": "Imagine you spend two years building up to your debut album. You spend that time touring, playing with the likes of Billie Eilish, the National, Twenty One Pilots and more, releasing songs, building buzz and excitement, only to have a worldwide pandemic completely revamp how the music industry has to work.\n\nThat is exactly the situation Dallon Weekes, frontman of iDHOW (I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME) finds himself in as his band get set to release their debut album, Razzamatazz, October 16.\n\nTrust me, Weekes isn't feeling sorry for himself as I found when we spoke by Zoom this past weekend. He is very much enjoying the down time in Salt Lake City with his family. But when it came time to film the band's new video, for the infectious, \"Leave Me Alone,\" they definitely had to take the travails of 2020 into account, down to a Covid Compliance Officer on set, as he explained.\n\nI spoke with Weekes about the new record, why he and band mate Ryan Seaman (ex of Falling In Reverse) originally tried to keep the band a secret, the Elvis Costello song he wishes he had written and more.\n\nSteve Baltin: Your debut record is kind of a conceptual record, yes?\n\nDallon Weekes: That's kind of how we came out of the gate swinging. That idea sort of developed while we were in the studio. I would fall into these weird rabbit holes on YouTube of talent shows, like cable access talent shows from the early '80s that were broadcast in New York and New Jersey. And it was this bizarre parade of people who were all just so sure that they were going to make it tap- dancing or doing their stand-up comedy or singing or whatever it was. The one in particular I'm talking about is called Stairway To Stardom. And it's just so fascinating, it's almost like a human zoo. I wanted to be on that show, but couldn't without being from that time period. So that's kind of where the concept came from. But it's a loose concept cause when we're onstage we're still us and when we do interviews we're still us. We're not like playing characters or anything. It's more of just another level of entertainment to present our art with, kind of like the way [David] Bowie did Ziggy Stardust [And The Spiders From Mars] or the Beatles did Sgt. Pepper's [Lonely Hearts Club Band]. I am a big fan of those. And not just the record and the artists but the way they presented those songs with a fictitious story. It was just always so fascinating to me because I remember being young and poring over that artwork and trying to dive into these fictional narratives they created around their albums. It was always really fun. So I wanted to do something similar.\n\nBaltin: \"Leave Me Alone\" is the perfect video for 2020 and dealing with Covid. Was it always intended that way or did you film the video to work around what is safe in 2020 with the plastic bubbles ala the Flaming Lips?\n\nWeekes: I'm a huge Flaming Lips fan too. We played a festival with them in Chicago I think last year and I cried like three or four times watching that set. It was incredible. But filming that video was sort of born out of the situation that we're in right now. If you consider yourself an artist, the art you make should probably reflect your environment or the times that you're living in or something. And we finished this record and we had to go make videos, but how do you do that in the middle of a pandemic? So we decided to incorporate things like masks and social distancing and quarantining into the video. And the shoot itself ended up taking twice as long as usual because safety was our biggest concern while making it. We had a Covid Compliance Officer onsite, who would take everyone's temperature and everyone had to get Covid tests before showing up. We went to great lengths to make sure safety was the number one priority and the filming a music video and making some art was number two. As important as making art is for me I don't want to do it at the expense of anybody's health. So we kind of married those two ideas, making a video and living in the current state of affairs we're in right now.\n\nBaltin: How has the thought of releasing a debut album during this time changed for you as this quarantine and pandemic rolled on?\n\nWeekes: It's strange, man. It's made me a realize a few things. One is how important playing live has been for my life and my mental health and how much I need to have that in my life. It's made me appreciate it a lot more, hindsight being 20/20. The other positive thing I can pull out of it is I get to be home a lot more with my family. In the past decade or so I've never been home this long with them. So I've been really appreciative of that fact, trying to find the silver lining in this big black cloud that's hanging over everything that we do. Cause I feel the strangest part of living in this whole pandemic is the sort of atmosphere and horror of stress and paranoia that surround everything that you do when you go someplace. But as far as it relates to music it's tough and it's certainly not ideal. I feel like everyone is just grabbing at straws and figuring out what works and what doesn't. But, for us, just to be able to get music out there at all was hugely important because we started this project a few years ago. We had our own timeline we wanted to have an album by. And we started this whole project in secret. For the first year of so we totally even denied we existed at all. But word started getting out, fans started coming around. Eventually Fearless Records stepped in and provided us with an opportunity to do a lot of touring, which was really beneficial to getting this thing built from the ground up.\n\nBaltin: What was the impetus for keeping things secret? And obviously coming from Panic! At The Disco there was going to be interest.\n\nWeekes: We knew that would be the case when we started. And it would've certainly been easy to come out of the gate waving a big flag that said formerly of Panic! At The Disco, but doing it that felt really disingenuous to me. I wanted to keep those worlds as separate as possible respectfully so. So the way for us to sort of circumvent that idea was to start in secret and build from the ground up as best as we could.\n\nBaltin: As an Elvis Costello fan what is the one song you wish you had written and why?\n\nWeekes: \"Lipstick Vogue\" for a couple of reasons. One, Bruce Thomas' bass playing on that track is off the charts. And it's something even on my best day I don't think I could touch. But even more so than that his natural ability when it comes to lyrics, double meanings and sarcasm, are just unmatched. He set the bar for me I think as a writer, something to aspire to. I'd say it would be Elvis Costello and the Mael brothers in Sparks."
