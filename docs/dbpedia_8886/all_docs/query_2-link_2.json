        "text": "Dallon James Weekes (born May 4, 1981), is an American musician, record producer, singer and songwriter who served as the third bassist for American rock band Panic! at the Disco from 2009 to 2017.\n\nRelation to Panic! at the Disco[]\n\nOn July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced their departure from the band.[1] On the Blink-182 in Concert Tour, the band hired Weekes to fill in for Walker. Weekes wrote the following post on MySpace: \"Hey everyone, I have been invited to play bass for some nice gentlemen that will be making a big name for themselves someday. Panic At The Disco. They are a brand new band that nobody has heard of. Ever. Alright, in all seriousness they are one of the biggest bands out there right now and I am really honored to have the opportunity to be on the tour. Misters Smith and Urie are two of the nicest dudes you could meet. Wish me luck! Or dont. But do though. -Dallon\"[2]\n\nAlthough Weekes didn't become an official member of Panic! at the Disco until after the completion of the band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues, Weekes is known to be responsible for conceptualizing the album’s cover.[3] Weekes can be seen towards the right of the cover, looming over Spencer Smith and Brendon Urie.\n\nFollowing the Vices & Virtues Tour, the band began working on their fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!. Weekes played a huge part in the creation of the album, with the majority of its tracks being co-written with him. The song \"Far Too Young to Die\" is a re-worked version of a scrapped demo from Weekes' previous band, The Brobecks.[4] “All the Boys”, a bonus track on the Target edition of the album, is known for being written by him.[5]\n\nIn October 2015, Weekes declared he would no longer be a part of the band’s official lineup, stating that he had no longer been “contributing creatively”. With that being said, Weekes is present on the band’s 2017 live album, All My Friends, We’re Glorious: Death of a Bachelor Tour Live. On December 27, 2017, Weekes announced that he would be leaving the band: \"For the last eight years I've had the incredible opportunity to perform in Panic! At The Disco. While I'm sad to announce that my time with Panic! has come to an end, I'm excited to continue making music with my new project, @idkhow. I'm grateful for the chance I've had to be part of Panic! At The Disco for nearly a decade. I will always consider myself indebted to those who made me feel welcome to be a part of P!ATD. You changed my life. Thank you all.\"[6]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nOn March 18, 2006, Weekes married Breezy Dawn Douglas.[7] They have two children; a daughter, Amelie Olivia Weekes, born June 1, 2008; and son, Knox Oliver Weekes, born June 23, 2010. They now reside in Southern California.\n\nCoincidentally, Weekes, like Brendon Urie, is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Weekes has ADHD and autism.[8]\n\nWork with Panic! at the Disco[]\n\nSongs from Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!
