        "text": "I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME (iDKHOW), the musical project of Salt Lake City-based singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Dallon Weekes, releases “GLOOMTOWN BRATS,” the second single off his forthcoming sophomore album, GLOOM DIVISION, out February 23 on Concord Records.\n\nFor Weekes, the Joe DiMaggio quote “rich boys don’t make it to the majors,” became his guiding light growing up poor while trying to find his footing as a musician. The mantra shines through in the theatrical, bass-heavy new anthemic single that centres on an apocalypse of vanities – the nepotistic lifestyles that are rarely earned and always flaunted.\n\nThe track is accompanied by the announcement of the 2024 GLOOMTOWN TOUR, with 27 dates across North America kicking off March 15, including stops in Toronto and Vancouver in April. Tickets are available for pre-sale with code GLOOMTOWN and general on-sale Friday, December 7 at 10:00 a.m. local time. Additionally, iDKHOW has confirmed a hometown New Year’s celebration that will take place on December 30 at The Depot in Salt Lake City.\n\nTour Dates:"
