        "text": "We’re back to bring you Part 2 of our Most Anticipated Album Releases Of 2024! In typical fashion here at idobi Radio, we admire far too many artists and far too much music to seemingly ever be able to fit things into one list. A good problem to have, eh?\n\nOur first installment held records like Green Day‘s upcoming Saviors album, Neck Deep‘s upcoming self-titled album, Ghost Atlas‘ Dust Of The Human Shape, and many more. If you missed it, make sure to check it out here. As we get excited and gear up for new music in 2024, we are only including confirmed albums on this list. Some may not have a release date quite yet, but the band or artist themselves have confirmed their respective album releases for this year. So, no speculations in this list! (Perhaps we’ll save those for another day *wink*.)\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump into Part 2 of our Most Anticipated Album Releases Of 2024! Let us know on socials which album you are most looking forward to!\n\nVocalist and multi-instrumentalist Dallon Weekes is a true mastermind and the leading man behind I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME. Beginning his iDKHOW career with debut single “Choke” and continuing on with debut album Razzmatazz, he is taking the alternative world by storm as the sole member of the project with a new sound that listeners are already head over heels for.\n\nWith 2023 hit singles “WHAT LOVE?” and “GLOOMTOWN BRATS,” GLOOM DIVISION will surely be a treat across its 12 songs. We are beyond excited to see Weekes’ evolution as he shifts into a glowing ‘70s vibe. He detailed “spoilers” for the album on X/Twitter, but really, he just explained how his writing process shifted. “[The album] sounds like ADHD. I didn’t know that while I was making it. I just made it sound the way it did in my brain. After meds, & experiencing what I call ‘Quiet Brain’ for the first time in my life, I came to realize what I’d made. I wonder what will happen…” his social media post reads.\n\nWith a fresh sonic lens featuring more groovy bass and bright riffs than ever before and gripping, tongue-in-cheek lyrics that fans have come to love, this rock band is poised to make one of the best records of 2024. Notably, Weekes reached out to myriad friends to get their input on his forthcoming solo album and collaborated with Miniature Tigers and Will Joseph Cook.\n\nBeginning in mid-March, iDKHOW is set to tour across the U.S. with support from benches. Spoiler alert: some of the shows have already sold out, so if you haven’t grabbed tickets, consider it a New Year’s Resolution. Who knows, there may be an appearance from Uncanny Valley Dallon onstage, too! —Maria Serra\n\nGen And The Degenerates are what modern British rock and roll is all about. They are unapologetic, self-aware, and brimming with heart and soul. Their rise from the pubs of Merseyside to the national stage has been one to behold. 2022 saw the release of their debut EP, Only Alive When In Motion, which took calls from as much seething classic rock as pummelling post-punk; it cemented all of the promise they have shown.\n\nNow, with their full-length debut set to define their 2024, they are upping the ante on everything that makes them tick. Look at “BIG HIT SINGLE,” a track that pokes fun at the pursuit of writing something that takes over the world for the Summer. “Famous,” looks at how people only give you the time of day if you have something to offer them.\n\nWith their tongue planted firmly in their cheeks and all the energy and exuberance of a small army, there is plenty to be excited about regarding ANTI-FUN PROPAGANDA. So, do you wanna be a degenerate too? —Jack Rogers\n\nDeathcore and death metal have been on the rise in recent years. From Lorna Shore to Angelmaker to Signs Of The Swarm, these subgenres have started to ascend into the mainstream. After a seven-year hiatus, juggernauts Job For A Cowboy made their return to the stage. They also released their first music in nine long years with the single “The Agony Seeping Storm.”\n\nMixing Myspace nostalgia deathcore with modern death metal technicality, the band is set to drop their fifth studio album via Metal Blade Records. With their second single, “The Forever Rot,” which dropped in October, the band further proved that they hadn’t missed a step in their nearly decade-long absence. This February Job For A Cowboy looks further to cement themselves as a foundation of heavy music. —Sean Mott\n\n24-year-old Noah Adams found massive success on YouTube way back in 2015. The British lad was still in school at the time, navigating his gender identity and trying to find his place in the world. He explored pushing content to the masses in the form of music covers at first but quickly moved into vlog-style videos surrounding the LGBTQIA+ community. While his mates at school weren’t entirely aware of his online popularity, he built an impressive community on the internet and grounded himself in like-minded individuals. (For the most part.) He debuted his solo music career with his ukulele-driven single, “Asthma Attack,” and the alias NOAHFINNCE was born.\n\nThe singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist grew rapidly and eventually inked a record deal with the US-based indie label, Hopeless Records. This collaboration brought fans two EPs: STUFF FROM MY BRAIN and MY BRAIN AFTER THERAPY. His whimsical and pop-punk-inspired nature cemented his fanbase worldwide. This was only the beginning of NOAHFINNCE.\n\nAfter maturing and reflecting on his early online presence as a young teenager, he realized it had a lasting effect – both good and bad. NOAHFINNCE announced the release of his debut album, GROWING UP ON THE INTERNET, dropping on March 8, 2024. The lead and titular single, “GROWING UP ON THE INTERNET,” is out now. Noah holds no hesitation when it comes to sharing his inner thoughts and perceptions of life; his debut album will be no different. If anything, this might be the most vulnerable and honest version of NOAHFINNCE yet. Check out the headlining tour dates for the album here. —Tate Logan\n\nTo chart the career of While She Sleeps is to watch a band find their calling repeatedly. From defiant keepers of the faith to documenting the societal ups and downs that mold and change us, they have conquered every voyage they have set sail on.\n\nWith SELF HELL, though, it feels like they are taking things up another notch. More vast, vicious, and vibrant than ever before, their repertoire now includes splatters of ‘90s pop and breezy alt-rock thrown on top of their chaotic foundations.\n\nYou only have to listen to the recently released title track to see how far they are pushing the boundaries they are always vaulting. Insatiable, introverted, and intelligent, it’s a look at what it means to stop your brain from bursting into flames in a world always holding a match close to you. They’ve also shared the crushing “DOWN,” which features an appearance from the unstoppable Alex Taylor of Malevolence. Basically, it is set to be an absolute riot. —Jack Rogers\n\nDon’t go “Screaming Bloody Murder” that Sum41 is ending their time as a band next year. But do be excited for their final album, Heaven :x: Hell, to play them out on a high note. The album is meant to blend the traditional, aggressive pop-punk fans grew up on with their newer, hard-metal rock sound.\n\nThe most recent single off the forthcoming LP, “Rise Up,” lends that harder edge that fans heard in their 2019 release Order In Decline. While the viral “Landmines” is an homage to their original All Killer, No Filler upbringing. As the countdown begins to the finale of the iconic band, listeners can bet that they’ll go out with a bang, and will never fade away. —Lizzie Baumgartner\n\nAfter performing on 2023’s When We Were Young Fest stage and debuting their brand-new track “Perfect,” we didn’t think that The Veronicas could top that surprise. Of course, the twin duo then surprised new fans and elder emos alike as they announced their forthcoming album, Gothic Summer, which is set to arrive in March via Big Noise.\n\nThe sisters arrived back on the scene with skate-punk-infused “Detox,” serving as their second single ahead of the LP’s release. With a new lease on life, a Travis Barker feature, and a refreshing modern punk sound brimming from their recent offerings, it’s fair to say we are welcoming this new era of The Veronicas with open arms. Plus, the duo will be heading out on an expansive North American tour in the spring, and you better believe we will go as hard for the new LP’s tracks as we will for “Untouched” and other iconic hits. —Maria Serra\n\nHello? It’s Bimbocore calling, and they’re saying Hot Singles In Your Area is legit. Hopeless Records Scene Queen’s first LP is set to release in Spring 2024. Her recent single “MILF” is a bit of hoedown throwdown mixed with hardcore guitar riffs that caused a lot of conversation on the internet.\n\nWith pink and glitter being her M.O., Scene Queen has made a mark in the emo/pop-punk scene with her risque lyrics, femme-power energy, and unapologetic music. Her collaborations with Mothica and Set It Off leave some speculation as to who, if anyone, will be featured on the anticipated album.\n\nLove or hate her, there’s no denying that Scene Queen will leave a stamp on the wrist of the scene. —Lizzie Baumgartner\n\nChicago and pop-punk go together like a shot of Malort and Old Style, iconic and invigorating. That’s exactly what Rematch is doing with their debut LP Nothing Like You Wanted. With an unspecified release date, the band has released one single from the upcoming album, “Retrograde.” They even had a First Listen with idobi for it.\n\nThe impending release was recorded and produced by Sam Guaiana, who’s worked with Silverstein, Bayside, and Neck Deep on previous records. Rematch has previously played with Driveways, Every Avenue, and Stop.Drop.Rewind. The No Coast pop-punkers previously dropped an EP, Do It All Again, in 2020, along with other singles in 2021. It’s safe to say that they won’t need to worry about any rematches for being “ones to watch” in the new year. ​​—Lizzie Baumgartner\n\nSay Anything has reunited in full force with the announcement of a brand new record, …Is Committed coming this year. They returned last year with their first single since 2019, “Psyche!”. The five-and-a-half-minute-long musical odyssey was reminiscent in sound to tracks from their debut record, …Is A Real Boy, such as “Admit It!!” or “I Will Never Write An Obligatory Song About Being On The Road And Missing Someone.” Fans were ecstatic for this sonic palette, something they have somewhat strayed from in the last few albums. The track felt aligned with their early music, but oozes modernity and growth at the same time.\n\nFollowing “Psyche!”, Say Anything released two other singles, “Are You (In) There?” and “Carrie & Lowell & Cody (Pendent).” Both were in time for their appearance at When We Were Young Fest. Although we don’t have an official release date yet, the band has promised the new album is coming in 2024. They are set to embark on an extensive headline run to celebrate the 20th anniversary of …Is A Real Boy this spring. We hope after that wraps, they will dive into promotion and releases for …Is Committed. We are grateful for the upcoming trip down memory lane but can’t wait for the new chapter of Say Anything to follow. —Tate Logan\n\nIt’s hard to have a most anticipated list without including Bring Me The Horizon, especially when their new album was supposed to drop in 2023. With recent news of the departure of keyboardist and backup vocalist Jordan Fish after being in the band for eleven years it brings a lot of intrigue to their upcoming album.\n\nFish was integral to helping form the sound the band has crafted throughout their last three records, so this may be a sonic change for the group as well. If their latest singles are any indication, there are a few paths this could go down. “LosT” is an infectious pop banger, while “AmEN!” is a chaotic sprint, somehow culminating the diverse sounds of the band throughout the years.\n\nIt’s been a long four-year wait for this album, and the next entry in the Post Human series having the subtitle NeX Gen feels very timely. —Sean Mott\n\nAs confirmed on idobi Radio’s Rock The Walls and social media posts from the band, their follow-up to 2021’s standout record Heaven In Hiding was completed back in October. However, it has yet to have a release date announced.\n\nFrom Sweden with love, Imminence has crafted its own unique band of metalcore. Dubbed “Violincore,” this Swedish quintet has always made music that can only be described as epic. It’s as if a metal band was scoring a billion-dollar film for a major studio. No greater examples are seen in their latest singles, “Death By A Thousand Cuts” and “Heaven Shall Burn,” which will be a part of their upcoming album.\n\nEqual parts beautifully melodic and brutally heavy, Imminence has a one-of-a-kind sound that has been making waves throughout the last decade in Europe, and the ripples have only begun to start here in North America after a completely sold-out debut tour overseas.\n\nRead more: Matt Skiba Shares His Least Favorite Alkaline Trio Album And Why\n\n“If you think these songs have been wild so far, You haven’t heard anything yet,” said guitarist Harald Barrett with a smile in response to some of the more eye-popping heavy parts of the 2023 singles that will appear on their upcoming album.\n\nThe band made their way to North America in November 2023 for the first time with all-sold-out shows on the East Coast. This included their biggest headlining show in their careers at the Palladium in Worcester, MA. They upgraded many of the venues and sold them out a second time. Their second North American headlining run has shows that are already sold out…nearly 5 months in advance! It also covers pretty much every city they didn’t get to play this November. This tour includes festival sets at Welcome To Rockville and Sonic Temple. It would seem that around the time of that tour would be the perfect time to drop the album."
