They released their debut album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, the following year, with their hit single \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\" helping to propel the album to triple platinum status in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was replaced by Jon Walker, prompting Ross and Walker to leave the group for a new venture, the Young Veins. The remaining two members, Urie and Smith, continued on by releasing the single \"New Perspective\", leading up to Pretty. Odd. (2008). Two years later they welcomed bassist Dallon Weekes as a full-time member, and released Vices & Virtues (2011). The trio released Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! (2013) with guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich joining them on tour. Unfortunately, Smith left the band the same year due to health problems, leaving Urie and Weekes as the last remaining core members. After Weekes stepped back to being a touring member, Urie transformed the group into his solo project. In 2015, he released the first single from fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016), before Weekes' official departure from the band in 2017. In 2018, Panic at the Disco announced Pray for the Wicked, their sixth studio album, with \"Say Amen (Saturday Night)\" serving as its lead single, and the seventh album Viva Las Vengeance out on August 19, 2022."
