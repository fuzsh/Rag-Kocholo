Note the inner planets refer to Sun to Jupiter, as well as the Ascendant and MC, and represent the core parts of the personality.\n\nParallels occur when two planets are at the same declination, both in the north or south. They are considered to have the same effect as conjunctions. Contraparallels are when one star in the north and another in the south are at the same declination. They are considered to have the same effect as oppositions.\n\nDaylight Savings Time:\n\nOur system detects whether DST was applied using the Olson timezone database. However, DST was not applied consistently before the 70s. Manually set DST if you believe it is not applied correctly.\n\nAuto-detect Apply Don't Apply"
