        "text": "So! I figure that posting pictures of Dallon is all well and (very) good but also that you should learn a bit. With words. So. A very quick and hopefully not creepy Dallon Weekes primer.\n\nDallon Weekes was born in Missouri on May 4, 1981. When he was young his family moved to Utah.\n\nDallon was born into a Mormon family and all Mormon males especially are encouraged to go on a \"mission\" where they attempt to spread their faith. My only experience with Mormons has admittedly been them knocking on the door of my family's vacation house. Dallon was sent to to Oklahoma. I just want to note this because this along with other things indicates that Dallon is a believer in the Mormon faith unlike Brendon Urie, of Panic! At The Disco, who is a lapsed Mormon. While I'm sure Urie and Dallon get along splendidly and that this probably causes zero conflict it just seems like something people would be interested in\n\nDallon says he was always interested in music but was never encouraged to pursue it as a child:\n\n\"At about 5 years old I knew I wanted to play guitar. I didnt really know any bands or anything. I just knew I wanted to play. I was never allowed to pursue that interest I had, but when I turned 15 I bought a guitar from a pawn shop and learned to play on my own.\"\n\nAt 26 Dallon decided to move to LA to pursue music professionally. He considers it one of the most produce things he's done and with good reason! In 2009 after Jon Walker and Ryan Ross left Panic! At The Disco due to creative differences Dallon was asked to tour with Panic! At The Disco. He fit in very quickly when he met Spencer Smith and Brendon Urie.\n\n\"I got an email from John Janick at Fueled By Ramen about trying out. I actually had never met them until I went to their house to audition for the Blink 182 tour. I think we ended up playing for like 5 minutes and then just hanging out watching youtube videos and Tim and Eric stuff. Good times.\"\n\nDallon is married! This is Dallon and his wife, Breezy Weekes, on their wedding day. According to neonglass.tumblr.com he met his wife through Myspace and proceeded to write songs about and for her. What a charming fellow this Dallon.\n\nThey are adorable! He tweets at and about her a lot and it mostly consists of him saying how Breezy is this supermom and fantastic and he loves and appreciates her. It is so. so. cute. Breezy seems very nice!\n\nBreezy and Dallon have two children, a daughter and a son. They're precious.\n\nDallon is the frontman for The Brobecks and the only permanent member of it. The Brobecks are an unsigned indie-pop band. They've been described as eighteenth century pop. This confuses me but. They're a fantastic band and Dallon is always joined by great musicians and writes fantastic songs. The Brobecks have released three albums and an EP (all of which I own and are fantastic. Also BUY INDIE ALBUMS LEGALLY. There's no excuse here folks, no giant record label gobbling up the profits. I feel very strongly about this.)\n\nDallon is also the touring bassist for Panic! At The Disco and has been for a while. This is good news! Jon Walker is happier raising cats with Cassie and doing his solo stuff so no hating Dallon because he isn't Jon Walker! That is not nice!\n\nDallon also contributed a little bit to Vices & Virtues but has emphatically stated that V&V is Spencer Smith and Brendon Urie's album, not his.\n\nWhile there is speculation that Dallon may eventually become the permanent bassist for Panic! there is no evidence that he will be or that he won't be. It does seem likely that he's Panic's! regular touring bassist and will continue to be so during the promotion of Vices & Virtues.\n\nDallon has a twitter (twitter.com/dallonbrobecks) which he mostly uses to send googly eyes at Breezy or make oral sex jokes and post weird links. He once tweeted at me when I mentioned The Brobecks in a tweet (not even at him) and I couldn't look at my computer for two hours. I like to pretend that this is a fandom with a fourth wall and hate when that illusion is ruined.\n\nBesides playing for Panic! and making his own albums (what a busy fellow!) Dallon used to work for a carpet cleaning company. I don't think this helped with making oral sex jokes. He also does Broadway covers, one of which is a fantastically dramatic cover from Little Shop of Horrors \"Skid Row\" featuring Brendon Urie on vocals, Matt Glass on drums, and Ian Crawford on guitar. And made it for free! Go, go to doesithavetobehuman.com\n\nHe's also weirdly charming. And sometimes just weird.\n\nThere isn't a lot of information about Dallon online. I really expect that to change in the next few months but until then just add to this post until we figure Dallon out, okay?"
