Genre-wise, the album will wander around a bit,” Weekes said. “There is one song, which I am really fond of, that was inspired by (nineteen-forties vocal group) The Ink Spots. I love them so much and I have for years.”\n\n“So, I wrote a song using their formula. We are not concerned with sticking to genres. I just want to write and record music I want to listen to. The music is all over the place and yet cohesive,” he continued. We’ll just have to wait to hear it to know what he’s talking about.\n\niDKHOW will be in the U.K. next month for Reading & Leeds.
