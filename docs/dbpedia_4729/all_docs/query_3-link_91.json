        "text": "Post by Kat on\n\nI was looking at the Encyclopedia and I was like OMG!! DAPHNE AND CELESTE AND FROGGY MIX AND LUCKY TWICE ARE BUBBLEGUM??? YEAY!\n\nSo here's some info becuase it looks like the pages are not up (please Mitch, put their pages up! I beg of you!!)\n\nOkay!\n\nDaphne and Celeste were active for 2 years (200-2002). The members: Daphne is Karen DiConcetto (born 1 December 1980) and Celeste is Celeste Cruz (born 24 September 1983). Their singles \"ooh stick you!\" and \"U.G.L.Y.\" were popular but rejected for their mean nature. They released one CD-\"We didn't say that!\"-But their career ended when they went to the Reading and Leeds Festival of 2000, when bottles were thrown at them. They reunited in 2005 with Lolly for a \"mini tour\".\n\nDaphne has appeared in some movies like The house is Burning.\n\nFroggy Mix info:\n\nKnown for their hit single \"No nagging Anymore\". Featured on Cardcaptor Sakura. No nagging was num. 12 on the charts in Europe.\n\nFroggy Mix fell out of the public eye after their release of their CD \"No Nagging Anymore\".\n\nFroggy Mix was born in Poland and moved to France... So, she is a Polish/French singer, singing music for a japanese anime! She loves sporting kimonos and japanese culture.\n\nAs seen and heard off of the Card Captor Sakura the Movie soundtrack and/or the video which she made, other than that, little is known about Froggy Mix...\n\nLucky Twice info:\n\nLucky Twice is a swedish bubblegum dance group.\n\nLucky Twice was formed in 2006 with two members-Hannah Reynold and Sofie (last name unknown), both 17 when the project started. Now the group has Hannah and Emelie Schytz.\n\nTheir first single \"Lucky\", was released in Spain on July 20, 2006 through Vale Music. It went to number 1 in the singles chart and was certified double platinum. Their album Young & Clever was released in June 2007 and was followed on July 23 by the single \"Hop Non Stop\".\n\nIn 2007 they released their CD \"young and clever\". A new CD is rumoured to come out this year, entitled \"TBA\".\n\nLucky Twice turned down association with Brittney Spears in fear that their clean-cut image would be damaged.\n\nTheir Myspace page is\n\nwww.myspace.com/luckytwice\n\nThe article conserning their turn-down is\n\nwebbeta.sov.uk.vvhp.net/~universal/UMTV/lucky1.gif\n\nPS first post!\n\nPost by Kat on\n\nIt wasn't a guest post - he/she was a member, made a few posts, really seemed to be fitting in nicely, I thought we had a new regular on our hands... and then the account faded out of existence. o.o\n\nI'm so sorry! I accidently deleted my account, but I'm BAA-AACK! ><\n\nI've updated the stuff, so there's tons more info. I'm on the laptop and the info's not on here, though, so I'lll have to post it later on.\n\nI'm very sorry, Irksplee! I didn't know I was that popular, though. XD"
