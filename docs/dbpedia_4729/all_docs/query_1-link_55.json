        "text": "1931 The community is in an uproar: Princess Alice breaks free of her enclosure too frequently and is repeatedly seen wandering 7th East – often “wearing” on her back an assortment of clothing from the neighborhood clotheslines. Community leaders begin talking about a new location for the zoo – and a new compound for Princess Alice.\n\nMr. and Mrs. James Hogle donate a parcel of land at the mouth of Emigration Canyon – which is where Utah’s Hogle Zoo is located today.\n\nIn February, the Salt Lake Zoological Society is formed to “provide direction and funding,” to assist in the acquisition of animals and the general development of the zoo’s grounds. All work of beautification, preparing fences, moats, ponds, and animal houses donated or paid for by donation. During the Great Depression, the Zoological Society sold flowers to raise money to feed the animal collection. On July 31, the zoo’s “Main Building”, the old Elephant Building now the location of our Lion exhibit, is dedicated to the children of Salt Lake. On August 1, the zoo opens to a whopping crowd of 14,000 people, many of whom arrived by public bus. Later that year, the first Monkey Island is constructed – near the site of the current Primate Forest exhibit.\n\n1932 On August 14, a stone carving of Princess Alice on the front of the “Main Building” is unveiled and dedicated (see the carving in the Historical Photos section). Local sculptor J.R. Fox donates the carving. Building materials are contributed by the Zoological Society and area businesses.\n\n1934 The water supply at the zoo is cut off for failure to pay a $195 bill. The Zoo’s flamboyant superintendent threatens to turn all the animals loose if the water is not turned back on. (The water was restored and the animals remained in their exhibits.)\n\n1941 By 1941, the zoo was in dismal repair. Both the Depression and the financial resources needed to enter World War II had seriously affected the zoo’s financial stability. Few people – only those unfamiliar with the zoo’s condition – visit. In June, the Salt Lake Tribune publishes news articles about the zoo’s deplorable conditions. One article’s headline, published June 19, sums it up: “Bad Odor, Old Cages, Garbage – That’s Salt Lake City’s Zoo.” Salt Lake City commits to clean up and repair the grounds and facilities.\n\n1942 Within the year, Salt Lake City improves the zoo, prompting a newspaper article that suggests that Duke, the zoo’s oldest lion, passed away “due to the shock of living in new, clean, comfortable quarters.” The zoo appeals to the public to donate unwanted pets.\n\n1943 World War II rationing prompts the zoo to grow vegetables, wheat, and oats to feed the animals. Acreage at Salt Lake City’s Jordan Park is also used to raise vegetables for the animals.\n\n1944 Mid-December, it is reported that Princess Alice has a “stomach ache.” Within days, the much-loved elephant suffers from a “nervous infection” which leaves her partially blind, but by the end of December, the elephant completely recovered.\n\n1945 The zoo builds pathways, bridges, and new exhibits. For the first time, murals are painted on display walls. The “Main Building” is renovated inside.\n\n1946 The zoo is visited by experts and acclaimed “a fine zoo.” In November, “Blizzard,” the zoo’s 8-yr-old polar bear, is non-fatally shot by an unknown guest. The culprit is never caught. The zoo’s superintendent announces that hereafter, firearms found on zoo visitors will be confiscated and punitive measures will be taken against people who throw sticks or stones at the animals. (The bullet wound, between the bear’s eye and ear, was not fatal and the bear lived another five or six years following the incident.)\n\n1947 Renowned Utah sculptor Dr. Avard Fairbanks sculpts two mountain lions atop 18-foot granite columns and the zoo’s old entrance is erected. These same statues can still be seen today in the entrance fountain. Princess Alice escapes yet again, forcing her building’s doors open and running through a fence and the gardens. The elephant rips up a concrete and steel drinking fountain and uproots a Chinese Elm tree. Later, the elephant calmly returns to her quarters.\n\n1948 On May 14, a female “Liger,” sired by a father lion and mother tiger, is born. Eventually, the liger is famously named Shasta.\n\n1982 Salt Lake County, agrees to help fund the operating expenses of the zoo. The Utah Zoological Society recommits to providing revenues for management and capital improvements. Society members and other donors fund the construction of the red kangaroo exhibit, the colobus and spider monkey displays, and the pronghorn antelope area.\n\n1983 – 1985 The last of the old cage-like exhibits, constructed in the 1930’s, are demolished. The zoo completes new exhibits for endangered snow leopards, primates, and great apes. The Utah State Legislature recognizes the zoo as a state revenue-enhancing attraction and commits an annual grant to the zoo’s operating expenses. The zoo officially becomes Utah’s Hogle Zoo.\n\n1986 – 1989 Through private donations and memberships, the zoo opens the old African Savanna exhibit and a gazelle exhibit at the far west end of the zoo (currently where the Rocky Shores Bear enclosures are located), renovated primate areas, and the first three phases of the kid-friendly Discovery Land playground at the east end of the zoo. Attendance tops 600,000 and in 1989, over 652,000 people visit Utah’s Hogle Zoo.\n\n1990 Three more phases of Discovery Land open: Prairie & the Predator, Knoll & Burrow, and Marsh Aviary. Gorgeous, the zoo’s 41-yr-old gorilla has a cataract removed and a lens implanted by Dr. Allan Crandall, an ophthalmologist at the University of Utah Medical School. The surgery and lens are donated. Gorgeous can see, is more active, and adjusts well to her new life. The zoo’s oldest resident, Kali, a 46-yr-old Asian elephant, suffers from a continuous foot ailment and has an orthopedic shoe custom made. Kali rips it up in no time and her paddock is remodeled with a cement floor to keep dirt and pebbles out of her foot pads.\n\n1991 The zoo kicks off its’ 60th anniversary celebration on July 31 with the unveiling and dedication of the Hogle Monument, a bronze elephant bust sculpted by Salt Lake artist John Mortensen. This statue can still be seen today across from the Rendezoo Room. Fellow trustees of the Utah Zoological Society, Zoo staff, friends and four generations of Hogles recognize James E. Hogle, Sr.. A time capsule is buried by Director LaMar Farnsworth, Governor Norman Bangerter and James E. Hogle, Jr., and the month long celebration continues through August. The Utah State Legislature recognizes the zoo’s 60 years of service to Utah communities by passing a resolution commemorating the zoo’s 60th anniversary. Elaine, one of the zoo’s first gorillas, moves to the Toledo Zoo, where she is placed with males who can produce offspring, since attempts to breed her with two other gorillas at Hogle Zoo were unsuccessful. Attendance tops 716,000. Admission is $4.00 for adults, $2 for children 5-14 and seniors, and children under 5 are free.\n\n1992 The fifth and final phase of Discovery Land, the Desert, is completed marking the completion of the $2.5 million development at the east end of the zoo. Zoo attendance tops 750,0000.\n\n1993 Utah’s Hogle Zoo opens a temporary exhibit, “Dinosaurs Alive!” featuring 17 life-sized robotic dinosaurs. Attendance to the exhibit reaches 266,751 and total attendance to the zoo is a new record of 789,000. The zoo increases admission prices to $5.00 for adults and $3.00 for children.\n\n1994 Utah’s Hogle Zoo opens its new gift shop, “The Flamingo Zootique” in April. The zoo’s summer attraction, a rare white alligator, is displayed from July – September. Unseasonably hot weather dramatically reduces attendance to Utah’s Hogle Zoo by 21%. First annual Art Show hosted, featuring local artists and works on the natural world.\n\n1995 The AZA Western Regional Conference is hosted by Utah’s Hogle Zoo. “World of Flight” bird show, hosted by Steve Chindgren, makes its debut, running from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Butterfly World, a green house housing butterflies, emerging boxes, and chrysalids opens to the public. Remodeling begins on the small feline exhibits in the Feline Building.\n\n1996 Remodeling is finished on the small feline exhibits, which now include murals. Phase I of the “A. LaMar Farnsworth Primate Forest” opens to the public, housing the colobus monkeys. Monkey Island is torn down to make way for phases II and III of Primate Forest. Warthogs are on display from Memorial Day to Labor Day; black-footed ferrets and zebras arrive; the sea lion exhibit is remodeled to become the Penguin Cove.\n\n1997 After 43 years as director, A. LaMar Farnsworth retires, and Craig Dinsmore becomes Executive Director. Phases II and III are completed on the Primate Forest. Dinosaurs are back, with “Zoorassic Jungle,” which, along with the birth of twin polar bear cubs Koluk and Kiska, gives the zoo record attendance of 821,458. New offices are built for Marketing, Graphics, and Development. The zoo hires its first Development Director. Gorgeous, a 48 yr.-old gorilla, becomes the oldest gorilla living in human care. Fourth year of the art show and third year of the “World of Flight” bird show.\n\n1998 The main concession stand is remodeled to be more time and cost efficient. It is now a walk-in, self-serve stand called “The Beastro,” (now the current Education building). Work starts on a new parking lot, which will include a stone wall and planters, and the main restrooms are enlarged. Unseasonably cool weather brings a slow spring and summer. The first gala, “Rendezvous In The Zoo” raises over $100,000 for the zoo, and brings fund-raising in Utah to new heights. Strategic Planning and Master Planning are now under way, which gives the zoo a 10-year plan for remodeling.\n\n1999 Admission prices are changed to Adults (13 – 64) $6.00, Children (3 – 12) and seniors $4.00, and children 2 and younger are Free. The 6th annual art show is a tremendous success, and the perennial favorite, The World of Flight Bird Show, returns as well. Twin polar bear cubs, born on Thanksgiving of 1998, debut in mid-April. A Komodo Dragon is on display from Memorial Day to Labor Day, housed in the Tropical Gardens.\n\n2000 On July 17, 2000, the zoo officially broke ground for a new Entry Complex, the first project of the new Master Plan. Two koalas are on loan from San Diego Zoo through the summer.\n\n2001 “Butterflies!” debuts in Tropical Gardens and Utah’s Hogle Zoo opens a much-anticipated new Entry Plaza. The Entry Plaza is made up of a new Wild Zootique gift shop, Membership and Guest Services, a new train station and an Events Pavilion. Anana, a female polar bear, born on December 12, 2000, makes her public debut in April. Admission prices increase to $7 for adults and $5 for children 3 – 12 and senior citizens.\n\n2002 The year started off with a bang, as the 2002 Winter Olympic celebration concluded with the state’s largest ever firework display just across the street. The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) recognized the “Wild Zootique” gift shop with the runner up award for “Best Merchandising Display.” The American Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK) awarded the zoo’s behavioral enrichment co-coordinator with their first ever Environmental Enrichment Award. The award recognizes outstanding keeper-initiated contributions to the art and science of environmental enrichment. “Outback Adventure” opened in May. The exhibit, featuring over 300 free flight birds from Australia, gave guests the chance to feed and interact with the birds. This is the most interactive exhibit the zoo has ever presented. Two black bear cubs, orphaned in the wilds of Minnesota, debuted in July. A golden lion tamarin and a giraffe were born in September. Two female red pandas made their debut in December. In October, the zoo conducted its first “Request for Proposal” to find an outside vendor for the food and retail services. This would later begin our long term partnership with Service Systems Associates (SSA).\n\n2003 Amur (Siberian) tiger cubs were born in February. Salt Lake City voters pass Proposition #1, “Redo the Zoo” campaign in November, giving the zoo $10.2 million to refurbish the elephant and feline habitats. The World of the Wild Art Show celebrates its 10th year. Outback Adventure returns for a second year. The zoo announced the tragic passing of the zoo’s only polar bear, Andy. He died Wednesday, November 26, 2003 after ingesting a guest’s adult size glove.\n\n2004 Kali, the zoo’s only Asian elephant, dies. At 59 years of age, Kali was the third oldest Asian elephant in North America and had been at Utah’s Hogle Zoo since 1954. A groundbreaking ceremony for the “Elephant Encounter” exhibit happens in June. It is the first project of the “Redo the Zoo” campaign. A new “Wildlife Theatre,” a 450-seat outdoor theater, opens in June. The theater hosted the ever-popular bird show, as well as several evening concerts. Four Chacoan peccaries arrive in July. The endangered animals make their home in a newly refurbished exhibit next to the Bear Grotto. The zoo again receives accreditation from the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) in September. Accreditation is granted for a five-year period and is awarded following an extensive application process. The “Outback Adventure” exhibit closes in September after a successful three year run. Salt Lake County residents face re-authorization of the Zoo, Arts, and Parks (ZAP) tax. Utah’s Hogle Zoo, along with the ZAP re-authorization committee, hosts ZAP Appreciation Day at the zoo. The day is highlighted with performances, demonstrations, exhibits, and arts from various ZAP recipients. ZAP is overwhelmingly approved, receiving 71 percent of the vote.\n\n2005 In March, the Board of Directors approved an increase in admission prices and membership prices. Admission increased to $8 for adults, $6 for children (ages 3-12) and seniors 65 and older. Children 2 and younger receive free admission. Membership fees increase for the first time in 12 years. On Mother’s Day, May 8, a baby orangutan is born via c-section. Since her mother does not recognize the baby as hers, staff and volunteers take on the around-the-clock duties of caring for the baby. Staff works tirelessly throughout the year to reintroduce the baby to her mother. The current Elephant Encounter, the largest, new animal exhibit in 25 years, opens to rave reviews in June. The exhibit, featuring three female African elephants and two white rhinoceros, provides a stimulating, updated environment for the animals by enhancing and increasing the habitats, activities and surrounding areas while providing better viewing areas and educational opportunities for the guests. Convergys Corporation pledges $200,000 to become the title sponsor of the African Lodge at the Elephant Encounter exhibit. “Butterflies!” returns in Tropical Gardens as the summer special exhibit. Construction begins on the current Asian Highlands exhibit. This is the second project funded by the 2003 Salt Lake City General Obligation bond. The exhibit is scheduled to open in the summer of 2006. The zoo receives the 2005 Thomas A. Martin Utah Recycler of the Year Award from the Recycling Coalition of Utah. The award recognizes the zoo for being environmentally conscious, caring about recycling and helping to make a difference in our community and environment. The second highest attendance in zoo history is recorded with 800,521 visitors enjoying the zoo.\n\n2006 The zoo instituted a marketing plan in January to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the zoo at its current location. Monthly activities and discounts were held. After several delays in scheduling a grand opening due to construction delays, on June 29, Asian Highlands opened to rave reviews. Asian Highlands is phase three of the master plan and the second of two projects funded by the 2003 Salt Lake City General Obligation bond. On July 10, a retrospective of the zoo’s history as part of its 75th anniversary celebration opened in the auditorium. A highlight was the return of the taxidermied Shasta the liger, on loan from BYU. The retrospective was popular with members and guests and three “memory books” were filled with guest memories of the zoo. Butterflies! returned for the second consecutive year in the Tropical Gardens building. Acara the baby orangutan celebrated her first birthday on May 14. A female grey wolf escaped on Mother’s Day, May 14. The Zoo had to be evacuated late in the afternoon. The wolf was humanely darted shortly after and returned to her exhibit with no incidents. Zoo Rendezvous achieves fundraises a record revenue in September. Abby the lion dies of complications of old age in late December. Intermountain Contractor magazine’s “Best of 2006” issue honored Hogle Zoo with it’s award for “Best Public Project Under $5 million” for the zoo’s newest addition, Asian Highlands. Hogle Zoo achieves record attendance with 847,831.\n\n2007 The zoo debuts the “Ghost of the Bayou” in early May – a white alligator exhibit inside the Tropical Gardens greenhouse. A successful artificial insemination procedure was completed on Christy, the African elephant in the spring by the team from Germany. A Disneymania! Concert for Conservation took place on July 11 to raise money for Utah’s Hogle Zoo and AZA conservation efforts. Utah’s Hogle Zoo is one of only 10 zoos nationwide selected via submitted proposals to participate. Two cheetahs make their debut in late June. A campaign was initiated to put a $65 million bond on the county ballot. ZooLights, a new holiday-themed lighting event debuts in December, pulling record attendance.\n\n2008 Christy, one of the Zoo’s elephants, is determined to be pregnant in February. This was the third of three attempts to artificially inseminate by the team from Germany.
