        "text": "So, celebrating 50 years from amalgamation, from 1967 last year, but we are carrying on because itâs quite a job to interview on a one-to-one basis. I think we are up to about 25 now, but having you lovely ladies here will actually add quite a few more numbers into the 50 because we can include these too. I have the slide up with the photograph I sent round of the article in the Western Morning News from 1937 where Chief Constable Lowe, at the time, was pressuring the Watch Committee demanding a trained policewoman for the Plymouth force. The Watch Committee refused to allow him to have a trained policewoman. I think they had had two before, but they somehow had been âdisposed ofâ. There was some mention that they were too expensive to keep in the force. Nobody, I think, knows the real reasons. So, that was kind of the banner that Plymouth women demanded women police. Lady Astor proposed a march to try and put pressure on the Watch Committee, and also local suffragist Dr Mabel Ramsay was a prime mover behind promoting and trying to get policewomen into the city department. This is timely because itâs the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act and Mabel Ramsay was very much an activist in Plymouth. Judith has been looking at some of the work that she had done as well. It seemed quite an achievement when finally, the first policewomen were set on. I had the pleasure of meeting Eileen Normington about a year ago. Sadly she is no longer with us, and she was the first interview I did for the â50 Years 50 Voicesâ project. Some of the images on the overhead here are from Eileen and also Daphne has provided a wonderful record with some of the pictures she brought in this morning. Iâm going to hand over to Judith who is going to say a little bit more about how the actual seminar operates. So please, everybody, get involved. Judith is going to encourage you all. We also have David Rees, Chair of the South West Police Heritage Trust who are responsible for all the material kept at Okehampton in the police store. The rest of us are from the university. So, over to you, Judith.\n\nThe thing about the history that I originally did in the 19th Century, the early 20th Century, was thereâs almost too much in the way of a paper record, but increasingly with the development of telephones, then eventually email, and the internet, less and less is kept on record and you have the official headlines of what happens, but for institutions, including the police, you donât get the social history. You donât get the sources unless you do something like have a witness seminar where you get a group of people talking together. The whole point and purpose of a witness seminar is to encourage people to talk, to let conversations spark off things that you may not even have thought of or remembered, and to bring them out and put them on record. Itâs not to embarrass, itâs not to go in for any kind of sensationalism, itâs simply to get a record of what it was like to be involved in certain periods of Plymouth, Devon and Cornwallâs history as a policewoman â¦ what happened that you remember, what stands out, what did you like, what did you not like, what did you enjoy, what did you not enjoy, the silly little things. So, I think the most important thing to stress is that itâs the minor details that are often the things that actually make a witness seminar particularly important because it flashes out what is actually going on. So, please donât think âI canât say something like that because itâs so small and so trivialâ, those are the things that this is the opportunity to bring out and it's surprising what it can spark off in the way of other memories to show things that were in common and things that were different. I remember when we did a seminar here on PACE, we had Kim and Kim, of course, trained in the Nottingham police and she kept saying âit wasnât like that in Nottinghamâ and this is something which is hugely important because those kinds of minor details, itâs often assumed that everything was the same and itâs not. Even when the theory is supposed to have been the same, the nuances are different. So, that again, is what we want to try to find out and thank you, all of you, for agreeing to come and talk. Sometimes when itâs a smaller panel what I do is go around and ask everybody to explain something about themselves, but I think in some ways it would be easier to get a short biography from each of you, almost as a written biography, later, but to plunge straight into the questions. So, I think one of the things that is so often overlooked, but is actually â¦ I grew up a military brat. So I remember the issues of my fatherâs uniform, and I remember one day when my brother managed to splatter my father with soapy water just before he was due on parade, and the frantic stripping of my father, putting him in fresh uniform and everything like that because he had to look the part. What is your memory of uniform? Were you proud of your uniform when you got it? Were you horrified? One thing could I say, when you speak, can you just identify who you are, soâ¦ this has been Judith Rowbotham talking and Iâm now throwing it open. So, you are?\n\nMargaret Vickery. Yes, our sergeant kept us in order with our uniform. Even our hair was not allowed to touch the collar or eyebrows, but she used to tell us in a subtle way. She used to look at you and say âoh, I must get my hair cutâ, knowing that we would take the hint. Yes, we were very proud of our uniform and we always did look smart. We never went out without our hat on. Iâm comparing the way it is now. If we were in a car, one of the police cars, we had to take our hat off then. When we got out of the car we had to put our hat on before we did anything else. Iâm afraid itâs not as smart nowadays. We had three pairs of black nylons issued, which never lasted because they used to ladder so easily, so we were always having to buy them. We had to âspit and polishâ our shoes, which we had been taught to do at training school. Yes, we were proud of our uniform in those days.\n\nThe skirts at that time were nice because they had a double pleat in the front and the pockets used to go right down into your groin. I can remember that very well because I think Iâm before some of these, and at that time, if you were standing on a traffic point doing your traffic duty and an exhaust happened to whiz your stocking, youâd have to go to the nearest toilet and change the stocking because in those days it was stockings, and the stockings Iâve changed in Sherwellâs toilet â¦ well itâs amazing. We used to do that because in those days there was no nylon and consequently your stockings would just zip if the fuel had touched your legs. It was quite a different age to today and as Margaret has said, nobody ever had to come in with their hair showing at the back, your hat had to come down. There was no nail-polish, no ear-rings. It was very plain, but very, very smart, and I was terribly proud of mine because I got to the age of 20 and my mother had brought us up after the War, and I really needed to get a good job. I didnât have the qualifications either because I had rather a rough upbringing in school. I loved mine and I was thrilled when I got in. Unfortunately, my life expectancy in the force wasnât very long because I decided to get married. I married a policeman and, in those days, when you married a policeman, you automatically left. He was in the Cornish force at the time and they did their absolute best and utmost to separate us, right from the very start. They threatened to send him to the Scilly Isles when we got engaged and he said âIâm not going, Iâm going to join Plymouthâ. When we got married, we were like ships in the night. He was going out on night duty and I was coming in, so, it didnât work for us. I think nowadays theyâve got much more freedom in that field.\n\nAnne Lockwood. I was Kent. I was a transferee from Halifax Borough. I joined Halifax Borough in January 1962 and transferred to Plymouth in April 1966. It was a bit of a shock joining Plymouth because ______, the woman inspector that was, was really, really strict and my first encounter with her was, she looked at me and said âthatâll have to come offâ, and she meant my hair and I said âno wayâ, but we were made to tuck every little bit of hair we had and keep it under control, very tightly, under our hats. The other thing was, she didnât like you to wear makeup. There were one or two girls who rather pasted it on and she would make them go and wash it off. The other thing she did was she kept nail varnish remover in her drawer, so, that was something else, but she was very, very strict with the uniform. When I came down I was taken to this place in Ebrington Street and fitted with my uniform. Because I was very tall, some of it had to be specially done. I still have my overcoat, which actually I do still wear. Itâs my best funeral coat. [laughter] Itâs very in vogue at the moment. Iâve also got my cape. I think thatâs about the only thing Iâve ever got. I stayed under ______âs regime for two years when I sort of got to know my way around the city and obviously got to know what was going on. Then I was moved out to Plympton and we covered the South Hams and Tavistock, right out to the moor [Dartmoor] area. All I did was travel around dealing with serious offences against women and girls and court duty, things like that. I actually stayed at Plympton until 1977, when I came back into the city again as schoolâs liaison. So, yes, it was rather an awakening meeting _____ who had a great character. I think really, she had a great effect on all our lives. I think we can all say that. She brought us up to be very respectful and smart. She even inspected our shoes and made sure our shoes were the right type.\n\nWe looked after a school crossing at Mannamead and this was before school crossing patrols, lollipop-ladies. We looked after ours. The men had certain ones. I remember being â¦ well, I was just going to say, because there were just a few of us, we were well known all over the city. All the bus drivers knew us and all the taxi drivers. So, Iâm up there early in the morning and Iâm standing in the middle of the road with the traffic stopped and the usual commuters knew us as well. So, I had all this traffic stopped and suddenly something touched the back of me and the back of my hand and they all started laughing because I jumped and it was the bus driver of a double-decker bus. He had driven the bus right up and touched my hand. [laughter] We used to have fun in those days. Another day, I had a Lambretta scooter in those days and I was off duty, and I happened to touch the brake coming down towards Mutley Plain on one of those white arrows, I was right over the top and the bus driver stopped the bus because he knew me. The bus was full of people and I was so embarrassed, but he got out of the bus and picked me up off the road and off I went again. It was so embarrassing, but lovely to think that he did that because he knew who I was.\n\nWhen I moved to Plymouth, at first, I lived in a friendâs flat on West Hoe and shortly after I moved, my then to be husband was moving as well from Yorkshire, but they wouldnât let him share the same accommodation as me at West Hoe. We had to have separate accommodation. So, I moved to a flat at North Hill and he was able to get a room, not in the same place as I was, but in the same block with a lady who had a spare room. They used to vet your accommodation and there was no cohabiting or anything like that because they used to check up. The other thing they used to check up on is, if you went sick, they would check up on that as well, or at least they did in the policewomenâs department. They always vetted the accommodation. When you wanted to move and buy a property, they vetted that as well because you got a rent allowance and obviously they had to make sure that it was suitable.\n\nI have to say, we were there for the purpose of looking after children and women mostly, in those days, and we certainly did that. I think today, in todayâs society, I would like to see that still the case, to be truthful because I think we had a lot more satisfaction and good endings to things with women, whereas now, everybody seems to be treated equally. For example, in our day, if you attempted suicide and somebody rescued you and you were in hospital all night, we used to have to sit all night. We used to have to sit to see whether they came out of it and if you were sitting with somebody who had tried to take their life and is trying to get back into life, the sounds of that in the middle of the night at 1 oâclock in the morning, is not the nicest sound, but we used to do that. I think women should still be dealing with women. Thatâs my honest opinion.\n\nWhen children went missing, we used to have to go and bring them back. Somebody from the office would arrange a carriage for you to go and collect these children from whichever constabulary had the child. I know on one occasion I had to go as far as Scotland to pick somebody up. The carriage was booked for you and the guard would lock the door. Youâd pick up the child, bring the child back, but the parents would have to pick them up from the station, and they would have to pay the cost of the rail fare of us having to go and pick them up. Another thing we used to do was trips to Exeter with prisoners from the dayâs magistrates court - any women that were given a sentence. I think the thing I used to hate, and I have always remembered, is when you went in the gate to the jail the babies were out in the garden, babies that had been born in the prison. The men in the prison used to make these little wooden cots with little canopies over. If you happened to be the prisoner and had your baby in there, theyâd stay with the mother, of course, for the first few days. That really used to upset me because it was a poor start for a child to say they were born in prison. Another thing we used to do was, we used to do observations on brothels. Youâd sit in the back of a car, an unmarked car, with your superintendent and heâd say âright, nowâ and youâd charge in and youâd get these men that were half dressed. I remember one day there was a chap doing up his â¦ âyouâre not going to tell my wife, are you?â. I think we had quite a lot of fun with that. Well, you had to take it as fun, otherwise, you would never have worked with it.\n\nAs I said earlier, my mother brought us two girls up. I lived in Liskeard at that time, and actually the local policemen were always very important to my mother because when you went to dances and things locally, she got to know the policemen quite well and in the darkness, youâd have this voice saying to you âyouâre going straight home arenât you Miss Milne?â And of course, this would probably be the PC that was on parade, and I used to be fascinated by these policemen to think that they had such control and I just had a thirst to do it. I know that I went to this police station and asked for a form to apply, and I went home and told my mother I had done that and I was 20. She said that I would never manage that, but however, I did. The nearest force to take women at that time was Plymouth. In Cornwall, I think, there was Sergeant Adcock and she was the only policewoman and she was stationed in Truro, so Cornwall didnât have any spaces at that time. Plymouth was just coming into its own, which was why, at the beginning, there were only the five of us and that was one to do each shift and one spare. Further on, in my service, they had all the trouble in Cyprus and we had secondments then to Cyprus. They were gone for two years and they had to be single.\n\nWhen I was at school, they used to take us to look at different jobs and they used to take us to the courts and things like that, so, from my early teens I was interested. You could join as a cadet, but in those days, you had to have permission, written permission, from both of your parents and my mother wouldnât give her permission. So, I was put to do something that I didnât particularly want to do and I did that and then when I was 20, I decided Iâd had enough of it, I still wanted to go into the police force. I was living away from home at the time, at a college, and I arrived home for the Christmas holidays with all my gear and my mother said âwhy have you brought all that stuff with you?â and I said âbecause Iâm not going backâ, so she said âhave they thrown you out?â, I said ânoâ â âare you pregnant?â â ânoâ. [laughter] I then said âIâm going into the police forceâ â âoh no youâre notâ â âitâs too late, Iâve passed to go in and I am starting on the 7th Januaryâ. She never spoke to me for about six months afterwards and I think all the way through my service and I retired in â91, she never really during her lifetime accepted that that was my job, although I used to keep reminding her. I used to say âthis pays the mortgage and keeps the roof over your headâ. She still never really accepted it. Obviously, my circumstances had changed and thatâs what I had to do.\n\nSimilar really. To this day I donât really know what it was that triggered me to want to join. I just remember joining the cadets at 16. I do remember my grandfather instilled a very strong sense of right and wrong and justice, so I was interested in wanting to right the wrongs of the world and put those that do the wrong things away. I was just looking, I think, and ended up falling into the cadets, but with hindsight, you were given the right advice Anne, because at 16 or 18, starting â¦ you were talking earlier about women police officers only dealing with women and children. At 18, I wasnât equipped to deal with children. I had no knowledge of how to look after children. Iâd never done that. I had no younger siblings that I had to look after. I had no real understanding of taking statements of incest. The first ones I did on rape I really didnât know what I was doing because I really didnât understand. From a 1960s closeted background, which we all had, we didnât talk about such things. So, being thrown in and having to deal with those sort of statements, with language and words youâd never heard of, you didnât know what the meanings were. I donât think that I was an effective officer at that age. I think you need life experience first, but then I wouldnât be where I am now if I hadnât done that. Like you all said, I donât regret one minute of it. I chose to leave rather than being forced out, thatâs the difference, but great experience. Brendan, why did you join?\n\nOh right. I did a biochemistry degree and in my last year at Kingston in London, I was thinking âoh my god, Iâve got to earn a living at some point, what am I going to do?â I had jobs with Pfizer and other big chemical companies all lined up, and I just had this horrific sense that I was going to be stuck in a lab for the rest of my life. It just didnât seem to fit with me, so I thought what can I do where Iâm going to be a force for good in society. It sounds very trite now, but I wanted to do something good and also, I wanted to work with people. I realised that everything I did â¦ if I was in the rugby club, I was captain, whatever I was in I was either the captain or the chair and I thought Iâd like to have the influence and lead people. I never wanted to join the military because I thought I didnât want to get shot at. I come from Plymouth and Iâve loads of military friends. Then it suddenly popped into my head, I thought Iâd join the police. Iâve got 42 first cousins on my dadâs side and Iâve no police relatives at all. There were a few that I booked in when I was a custody sergeant, but no police relative at all, so I just applied and joined the Devon & Cornwall Police. Thereâs a real strong theme because when I went and told my parents that I was joining the police, they went absolutely mad. They were horrified, and even to this day, my mum, she never tells anybody that Iâm a police officer. She says âmy sonâs a chief inspectorâ. [laughter] They didnât like it at all. My dad said âwhy do you want to join that bloody bunch of thugs?â.\n\nI donât think I would like to deal with the violent attitude towards the police now. It was just beginning to change as I left. I was out on patrol in Mayflower Street with one of my male colleagues just before I left, and that was my first experience of having stones thrown at me. That was very disquieting. I think he, as well as myself, were a little bit concerned about this because although we didnât retaliate and engage with them, we just walked away, they followed us and continued throwing stones. That was my very first experience of it and I wouldnât relish that in todayâs climate. Having said that, I think itâs like everything, the youth of today know how to deal with this because theyâve been brought up with it. To us, itâs foreign and it was foreign all those years ago to us. I think the youth of today, theyâre used to going to clubs, theyâre used to the drugs, theyâre used to the fights and everything that goes with it, and theyâre better equipped to deal with it than we are or am I wrong?\n\nWell, I went to [inaudible] for my initial training course and like Pauline said. We trained with the men. We did civil defence, self-defence, and someone broke their arm - everything. Traffic - there were roads in the camp where we were, and they used to set up accidents for us to deal with. There was a courtroom and we had to give evidence. We had very good training. It was strict training and it stood us in good stead. Our intermediary, after a year, we did that at Greenbank and then we went to Ryton for our end of two-year probation. There again, by then we were all from different forces anyway and we were re-meeting people that we did our initial course with. Some had done jolly well. I do remember two of the men fainting when we went to Stafford police station, and they showed us some pictures of a woman whose husband had literally buried an axe in her head. One fell over the flight of stairs, he was stood at the top of the stairs, and the other one slid down a filing-cabinet and banged his head on an open drawer on the way down. [laughter] Apart from that, it was uneventful.\n\nI did my initial training at Bruche in Warrington. At the time there were six of us. Six females started out and about 400 men from forces which were mostly Liverpool and Manchester, that sort of area. They were really quite rough diamonds. I think in the end we were left with four women. I went back there for my initial refresher and then for my final refresher, I went back there as well. It was hard. It was an old RAF camp, and we were living in Nissen hut type places. The food was absolutely disgusting, and we complained. I always remember the commandant told us that if we had any complaints about the food he wanted to know at the time. One day I actually found a live worm in my fish. I marched from the back of the dining-hall to the front and said, âsir, I have found a worm in my fishâ and he looked at me and he said âshush, donât say it too loud, theyâll all want one,â [laughter] and I went and sat down and that was the end of it. But, the food still continued to be bad.\n\nRight, Iâll tell you a little story about ____ ____. He was a right giggler. I had to accompany him to a place in North Road with the medical officer of health and he had to go and certify a lady who, sadly, had lost her marbles. We go to the top of this house and right at the top she had a room and when we got in this room she was in bed, fully covered up. When we arrived, she sat up, she was fully clothed, saw me, grabbed my hand, stood on the bed, walked to the end of the bed and sheâs standing there saying âwhat are you doing here? get out of my room, this is my land, my empireâ. _____ started to giggle and she saw this giggle, but I was in line with the smack that went out and that was the only time I ever got hit. When that happened, the medical officer of health grabbed hold of her and off she went. It was sad, but that was ____ ____. He was always up to tricks. There were so many tricks they used to play on people. I remember they had some new policemen recruits in the traffic department and they let the story go around that royalty was coming and that they had to be on duty down through Royal Parade. In those days all the police cars were black. _____ and some of his colleagues drove down through the Parade, stuck a flag on the front and made out that that was the royal car and these young recruits were standing there saluting. Again, _____ _____.\n\nI was going to say, I think my generation is in the middle because we did have sexual harassment. It was completely different. There were colleagues that were inappropriate in what they said, in things they tried to do, in things that they would show you, and itâs just occurring to me, because you were almost like this separateâ¦ but also that must have meant that the senior officers had real respect for you as well. In my experience, which isnât that much later, so 1977 is only two years after the Sexual Discrimination Act came in or thereabouts, was actually quite different. Today, the policewomen that were subjected to the kind of things or the things that we saw, would know exactly what to do because itâs people like Brendan that have set up proper systems that are accessible to go and complain to. We had nothing like that. You couldnât complain. You just had to ignore it or make sure that how you operated you were better than â¦ you had to be as good as the guys, if not better, to be accepted in the first place. Thatâs what equality kind of brought in, the Discrimination Act. You had to handle it in your own way because in those days, those sorts of things wouldnât have been taken seriously. I was young and naive as well, often not even to know that what was happening was inappropriate. When you look back with hindsight and you look back now with all the #Metoo campaigns and everything else, you realise that actually a lot of what was going on, was not, in any way, acceptable.\n\nYes. I remember being grilled in the magistrateâs court with one job. I think it was a shoplifting job I had which went on for weeks and weeks. There were children involved and it just escalated because this one child was caught shoplifting, and bearing in mind we used to do patrolling in plain clothes in the stores in those days, now they have their own. I must have caught the child and then with questioning, she told me that she had given lots to this friend and that friend, she couldnât remember what shop she had stolen it all from. We had to round up all this stuff from all her friendâs homes. I had so much stuff, I didnât know where it had all come from and I had a long table, like this, in the city centre police station, all laid out with all this stuff and I invited all the managers from all the stores to identify their own stuff. So, in court, this took an awful long time and I remember I just relished the job of answering the questions and standing up to this clerk who kept on and on and on, but I gave it back to him. I remember, whoever it was, a chief inspector probably, saying at the end âwell done youâ.\n\nThey always used to let us know the results of our cases. I donât know if anybody else can remember, but there was always a newspaper man who used to sell the papers outside the Hyde Park Hotel on Mutley Plain and one morning I went up to do the point and there had been a baby dropped on the doorstep where this newspaper man always sold his newspapers. We had to get the police car down and then they traced the woman, eventually. We also used to accompany them at their medical examinations. You always had to be present for that. Then the job went onto CID and I didnât hear any more about it, except to say, they kept me informed that the baby was fine. It transpired that it was a married manâs baby and obviously they had deposited it as soon as it was born. To save its life was wonderful, but I do remember, distinctly, being on the point sometime later, and I couldnât say now how long, but two lades came up from Thorn Park and Thorn Park was a remand home. Anyway, she came up and she got to me and said, âyouâre the lady I spoke to when I had my babyâ and I didnât know who she was. She said, âIâm the lady who dropped the baby on the doorstep of the Hyde Park Hotel and I want to thank you for all you didâ. That must have been 18 months or more after. So, I said, âmore to the point, whereâs your child?â, she said, âheâs wonderfulâ and she still had him. I thought that was one of the loveliest stories, but it was wonderful that she recognised me. I didnât know who she was because it was quite a while after. It was a happy ending to a very sad story. Now, it happens all the time. I think they always kept us well informed, and they were always there for us.\n\nI remember a naval wife and her husband was away and she had a very disabled child. It mustâve been when we were Devon & Cornwall because I think they lived at Wembury. The child was very disabled and had become strong enough to hurt her and she was on her own with this very, very disabled child and in the end, she suffocated it. She went into hospital, and I was on suicide watch with her, sat in the hospital, and I think that was one of saddest things because she dearly loved this boy. Heâd just got that he was stronger than her and she could see that she either had to let him go into a home because she couldnât cope with him anymore and she actually put a pillow over his face. I did suicide watch with her in Devonport Hospital. I always remember and think thatâs one of the saddest things I ever dealt with because she was so distraught to what she had to do. Her husband was aboard ship and away and he was an officer. It was quite a nice family, but â¦\n\nI had a very sad experience with a lady whose husband was in prison charged with murder and serving a sentence. She had two daughters, and they were in the welfare accommodation and she stole a hand of bananas and a packet of sweets because she had no money. This was to buy her daughterâs friends at school. They would take them to school and pass them around. She got done for shoplifting, obviously, and prosecuted and the welfare got involved, but she kept the two children. This woman was so distraught because she had no money, no home, her husband in prison and she was struggling to bring up the two daughters. She actually committed suicide. She took some tablets and she wrote a note to the policewomen and it was directed to the policewomen at every stage as she was fading away, having taken these tablets, having committed suicide. The eldest daughter subsequently became a prostitute. I donât know what happened to the other daughter. That was the saddest thing I had to deal with and it upset me for quite a long time.\n\nI think the saddest thing was it was one Christmas and it was whilst I was at Plympton and there was an accident at Yelverton. This guy who was in the Navy was coming home on leave to his wife at Plympton and he gave a lift to a friend, somewhere at Yelverton. I donât know what happened, but somehow, he skidded off the road and hit a boulder and was killed outright. I had to go around with a policeman who actually knew the family and tell her. It was his second wife and at the time she had a small little girl, and she was very, very pregnant and we had to break the news to her that heâd been killed. When we went first to the house, she opened the door and said to the policeman, who she knew, âcome in, George wonât be very long, Iâm expecting him homeâ. We could actually smell the dinner cooking and that always sticks in my mind, even at Christmas and when I ever go to that area of Plympton, and thatâs many, many years ago, when I first went to Plympton, so, weâre talking about â68-ish."
