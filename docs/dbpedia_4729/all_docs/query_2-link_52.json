        "text": "Background\n\nDaphne Diana Joan Susanna Guinness, popularly known as Daphne Guinness, was born on November 9, 1967. She grew up in country houses owned by her family in England and Ireland. Her father is Jonathan Guinness, third Baron Moyne, the eldest son of Diana Mitford and Bryan Guinness. Mitford was the daughter of David Freeman-Mitford, second Baron Redesdale, the father of the Mitford sisters. Mitford divorced Guinness and married the leader of the British Union of Fascists, Sir Oswald Mosley, sixth Baronet of Ancoats. Daphne Guinness stated she did not know of Mosley’s political affiliations before she heard in 1980 on “B.B.C. News” that he had died.\n\nGuinness’s first work in fashion was with Isabella Blow. She has worked with Karl Lagerfeld, NARS, MAC, Akris, Gareth Pugh, and Philip Treacy, artistically, as a model or both. She was a friend of the late fashion designer, Alexander McQueen. Scheduled to model for charity on the runway the day his suicide was announced, Guinness veiled herself in mourning.\n\nShe designs clothes, jewelry, and perfume. Since 1994, Guinness has been on the International Best Dressed List. In 2010, she was named in Tatler’s top 10 best-dressed list. And in 2011, Guinness created a make-up line for MAC cosmetics. Guinness was photographed by photographer Bryan Adams and featured on the cover of “Zoo Magazine” in 2011. She has walked in two of “Naomi Campbell’s Fashion for Relief” shows to raise funds for disaster victims. In the same vein, in April 2008, she auctioned off part of her wardrobe, with the proceeds going to a struggling British charity called Womankind Worldwide, which deals with women’s issues at home and abroad, such as domestic violence."
