Dante has acquired a new talent who is spectacular in song, personality and stage. Her name is Daphne Cooper. The COO of Dante (Chauncey Dunham) met Daphne at a restaurant where she was a hostess, and she caught his eye based on her ability to handle both the guest during a sold-out situation for seating and her unique look. The poise and grace that Daphne had really got his interest. When things calmed down, Chauncey asked her some questions and found out she could sing. Chauncey then did something he had NEVER done before…he hired her to sing at one of his company’s shows without hearing her sing. That’s right. She did not have to audition. Something just told him that she could sing and that she would NOT disappoint.\n\nThe day of the show Chauncey was nervous. He started thinking, “What have I done?” I hired a woman to sing and I have no idea if she can sing. Moments later, Daphne Cooper stepped on stage and started singing and something special started to happen. Daphne Cooper captivated Chauncey with her pitch perfect voice, and at the same time, she started casting a spell over the entire audience.\n\nShe also held and not only did she captivate Chauncey she had the audience spell bound.

Johnson, Publisher – Black Men In America.com\n\nAfter reading this article, I had to see for myself. I was in Florida on vacation and wanted to see if Daphne Cooper was on stage anywhere. Sure enough she was performing in Maitland, Florida at the Jazz Tasting Nightclub and Restaurant. I put the word out that I was coming to see her show. I got some friends together and off we went on a very rainy night. We were not disappointed. The food was great and Daphne Cooper was EVERYTHING that she was hyped up to be and more. Daphne Cooper is a delightful person and performer. She sat down at our table before and after the show. She wanted to make sure that we had a GREAT time, and we did.\n\nDaphne Cooper and Gary Johnson after Daphne’s Show\n\nClick Here To Visit Daphne’s Facebook Page"
