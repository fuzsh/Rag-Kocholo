Through our nonprofit My Brother Rocks The Spectrum Foundation, we provide social skills groups and activities for children across the spectrum.\n\nWe Rock the Spectrum Daphne provides children with a fun and motivational environment to help them in the areas of strength, movement, sensory processing, communication, positive behavior modification, social interactions, and self-care skills. Our unique equipment assists all children in their neurological growth and development.\n\nOur activities, programs and retail location “The Rock Shop” make it possible for us to provide social and physical opportunities through state funded programs. As a result WRTS is an amazing example of how we can help all children grow and develop by providing an all inclusive environment.\n\nMelissa Miller, LMFT / Program Director of Project SAFE, The Help Group Dina, I wanted to thank you for opening your facility in Tarzana to our program and to our families. They had a great time! The families in our program have so few opportunities to experience places like yours and have the chance to interact with their child in a safe, positive environment. I look forward to having more events at your gyms in the future and being able to give more families the opportunity to have positive, fun interactions with their children, in addition to helping parents learn about various child development and relationship focused information. What Parents Say Ken and Monique F. – Tarzana BEST PLACE!… My kids go here every time school is out for winter or spring break. Dina is amazing, place is clean, she brings in all sorts of people to make it interesting for the kids. My kids love Coach K who show up all the time. All the mats are new and everything is kept tidy there. It is safe as Dina always has staff members watching the kids all the time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Kids Gym. And its across the street from CPK!.. U guys are great!… What Parents Say Jim M. – Tarzana This place is amazing! My wife and I had been looking for a good place to bring our 4 year old son for a while and heard about “We Rock the Spectrum Kids Gym” from a good friend. Our son is on the Autism spectrum and we have had a hard time at some of the other places we have visited. We walked in, and the owner was very helpful. Our son warmed up to her right away – not something he usually does. He then had a great time on the various swings and the trampoline, even interacted with some of the other kids there. We will be heading back there again this weekend (maybe he will even try out the zip line this time), and hope to be bringing some more friends with. GREAT FIND!!!!!! What Parents Say Shelley B. – Studio City I absolutely can not say enough good things about Dina Kimmel and this wonderful place she has made for all the children!!! My son, who is 5, is constantly requesting to go to We Rock the Spectrum – It is above all (even Chuckie Cheese!) his favorite place. The staff is warm, helpful, knowledgeable, professional, fun and caring. Dina, (Owner) is so amazing as a person, that her passion and love for all is so reflect in the work she does. Guys, this is SO MUCH more than just a gym for kids. It is a healing center,.. a place to let go and be free, ..a place to be happy, a place to make friends and, a place for children to just be. You name it, they’ve got it! My son’s favorite is the “Zip Line” into the huge pile of foam! Also, a great place for Birthday Parties. I could go on! Its a MUST go, you will see, your kids will love it there!!! What Parents Say Karen V. – Burbank My son is almost 3 and has recently been diagnosed with autism. I am constantly looking for places to bring him that aren’t too crowded and that have things that he likes to do. ?We were greeted by the owner when we arrived and she was extremely warm, helpful and hospitable. She has a child on the spectrum- and she is passionate about the gym and how it helps kids with sensory issues,etc. It is really nice to talk to someone who loves what they are doing and are making a difference for kids like ours. The place has E V E R Y T H I N G. There are swings and slides and things I’d never seen or heard of. There’s a big trampoline and lots of balls of all sizes. There is even a zipline! The staff walk around suggesting things they think you might like and are very accessible and attentive. I was in love the minute we arrived. My son had one of the best times of his whole little life. We can’t wait to go back again! What Parents Say Deborah S. – North Hollywood We love this place. My son is 5 and his dad feels like this is one of the few places they cay really play full-out INSIDE! The zip line, trampoline and crafts room are a huge hit with my son. What Parents Say Anne M. – Valley Village Just love this place!! it is not only a perfect environment for children on the spectrum, but also for regular kids who just want to have a fun time. My boy loves to be there and enjoy all it has to offer! Dina, the owner, is a wonderful person and really cares about children. Her personality can be seen throughout the gym and for me it is my “happy place.” Thank you for creating this magical space! What Parents Say Lisa K. – Porter Ranch This place is a dream! I have 2 1/2 year old twins who are both on the spectrum. This place is perfect for them, they love it and ask to go to “the gym” Dina, the owner, knows my children by name and always gives them a warm greeting. So much to do, lots of fun! The weekly support group has been awesome for us to meet other parents for support and information. What Parents Say Danielle P. – Valley Glen This is a great new place to come and play with your kids! They have different equipment than what you can find in normal places, so it keeps my kids interested. Also, there is so much to do there, but the space is not too big, so it’s not overwhelming, and i can easily keep an eye on my little ones. I also love the arts and crafts corner in addition to all of the gym space. This place is really a gem. I also went to a birthday party here just a few weeks ago and I’ve never seen kids have as much fun at any other gym-type birthday. They were having an absolute blast! This is not just a gym for kids with special needs… it really is for everyone, and such a special place because of that! Very very cool new spot. What Parents Say Jenny R. – Winnetka My hyper child and my younger child both LOVED this place. Clean, fun and is super equipped with sensory stimulation. Thanks DINA!!! What Parents Say Kim W. – Woodland Hills We recently had my daughter’s 3rd birthday party at this gym and it was a blast! The staff was so helpful and professional. You could see the joy on all the kids faces all afternoon! My 6 year old attended the “camp” during the Thanksgiving holiday. One day was “rock ‘n roll” themed. She came home so musically inspired that she pulled out an old box of instruments and got her little sister and I to join her band! We spent the rest of the day creating our own rhythms in her bedroom!
