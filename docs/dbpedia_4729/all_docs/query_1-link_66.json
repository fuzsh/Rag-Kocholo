        "text": "I’m looking for lyrical novels with propulsive plotting, grounded in reality, which weave in a fantastical element–especially if that element is used as another perspective with which to explore the emotions, connections, and humanity of a novel’s characters (so, equally if not primarily compelled by human stakes, rather than magical ones–though if they’re entwined, that’s gold!). I am riveted by cross-genre books like THE HUSBANDS, BOOK OF NIGHT, NINTH HOUSE, THE MINISTRY OF TIME and beyond: I’m so curious what authors like Artemis Fowl would be for adults; or Leigh Bardugo’s SIX OF CROWS duology, but adult and grounded in our world (so heist + magic!); witches or the supernatural + thriller/mystery/Gillian Flynn; books like THE NIGHT CIRCUS, affixing romance to magical competition. I’m currently obsessing over monsters, especially from around the world or steeped, somehow, in history–think THE VAMPIRES OF EL NORTE.\n\nI also love magical realism (like Aimee Bender), especially those that lean a little dark/darkly whimsical (Pushing Daisies), and anything that makes me feel. My absolute sweet spot is myth-retellings, like Madeline Miller or if Rick Riordan wrote for adults–particularly those that explore BIPOC cultures, like KAIKEYI and anything written by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. Dark academia is my absolute jam, from boarding schools to secret libraries that have persisted through the ages (THE ATLAS SIX)–and if there’s a dark generational curse or prophecy involved, I’m invested (from the whimsy of Penelope to the darkly destructive, like Juno Dawson’s series). Is your novel about a haunting, whether of a person or of a place? Would you comp it to Shirley Jackson? I want to read it.\n\nOutside of the SFF etc, space: I’d love a complex and character-driven murderous novel (THE BANDIT QUEENS, the perfect blend of punchy, funny, and dark), a fast-paced and snarky thriller (PORTRAIT OF A THIEF, which I devoured instantly), a haunting and devastating suspense novel. I particularly am drawn to novels in these genres with multicultural casts that are not written for a white gaze–something that I felt PORTRAIT OF A THIEF and THE BANDIT QUEENS had beautifully in common. I’m also always on the look out for some psychological, gothic horror in the vein of REBECCA–if you have the next Daphne du Maurier, I’m your girl.\n\nOutside of genre fiction, warm, ultimately uplifting stories about human connection with friendship, familial, or romantic love at its core (particularly LGBTQ+) will always pull me in. If the writing melts like butter, and your characters leap of the page, don’t consider any genre a barrier.\n\nIn terms of nonfiction, I would love philosophical self-help books (think HOW TO DO NOTHING, my own personal religious text) that are not prescriptive, as well as thoughtful and considered writers that can take any topic and make it both interesting and fun (Emily Nussbaum, Olivia Laing, among others). I love a narrative that offers a fresh perspective on an old story, as well as books written by passionate, qualified writers who will make me feel absolutely geeky about their topic, even if I’ve never heard of it before. I want to learn–but I’d love to not feel like I am.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, any book that makes me hungry–fiction or non-fiction. I love food as the center of the story, especially as a way to enter culture, family history, a nation’s history–truly, any way you write it, I want to read it. In nonfiction, I would love to see how food culture intersects with other dimensions of life i.e. social justice, climate change/justice, war, media, and so on.\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nUnfortunately, PRH only accepts agented submissions at this time."
