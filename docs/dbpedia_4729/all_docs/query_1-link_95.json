        "text": "Maybe Daphne is due a come back at some point like other names of that era.\n\nFor me, I associate it with a chain smoking woman in her 70's/80's. I also don't like the sound- Daph, like Daffy Duck.\n\nNot a fan at all, but if you like it, that is all that matters.\n\nAbsolutely gorgeous names, both of them.\n\nI'd choose Daphne. I just adore it.\n\nIn reality I'd never have got either of them past DH, and we had boys anyway.\n\nDaphne is better but not by much. I automatically think of Scooby Doo or Frasier when I hear the name.\n\nI know two Daphnes. One in her 40s and one in her early 50s. I think there is a good reason why the name isn't heard much anymore.\n\nUnusual. I like it.\n\n(As a teacher, I am judgey about names. I think I‚Äôd like to have a Daphne in my class. She sounds kind and clever).\n\nI know a toddler Daphne and have really warmed to the name, it really suits her.\n\nI love it. I'd go for Daphne over Delphine but they're both beautiful names. Daphne is due a comeback!\n\nI love Daphne and don‚Äôt think of Scooby Doo at all - first thought is the Malory Towers character, or was it St Clare‚Äôs? Second thought the flower\n\nI have a little Daphne and we get compliments on her name all the time ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDaphne is a very 80s name to me, in my mind I see a woman with big hair and high heels. Definitely not a baby name! Wasn't that the name of the woman in Neighbours who gave birth with her tights on? üòÇ\n\nDelphine is very pretty, and doesn't sound anything like dolphin üôÑ\n\nI think of Des and Daphne from Neighbours, but that probably shows I‚Äôm too old to be naming babies.\n\nDaphne is in Bridgeton I believe, and it's increasing in popularity. It's broken the top 200 now and I think will keep rising. It fits in well with current baby names, and wouldn't be surprised if it cracks the top hundred in a couple of years. I feel I hear it all the time on name forums."
