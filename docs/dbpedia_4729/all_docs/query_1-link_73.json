        "text": "In the course of my work, I read many farming magazines. How different is the farming scene from that I faced in 1939 when I joined the newly-formed Women’s Land Army. The recruiting office was in Portland Terrace, Southampton. I really had little idea of farming, only enthusiasm inspired by romantic pictures such as ‘The Gleaners’. Poor farmers, I can imagine their horror at the idea of employing girls like me.\n\nI mostly thoroughly enjoyed my farming years, though sometimes extreme tiredness led to boredom and a desire for fresh surroundings and I would go to fresh fields and pastures new.\n\nFirstly, though, I spent two weeks at Stockbridge. Faint, derisive smiles appeared on my colleagues’ faces when I arranged this August’, ’39 holiday. However, the weather was glorious, and I returned to my desk with a gorgeous tan.\n\nTwo months later I was ‘called up’, this time to a farm in Farringdon, near Alton.\n\nThe first winter of the war was fantastic. I remember a thaw that was stopped in its tracks by a sudden massive freeze. I should have had a camera, that day. Icicles hung from just about everywhere, and the roads were lethal. Getting the cows to and from the milking sheds was almost impossible. We tied sacking over our boots so we could stay upright. Visually, though it was a beautiful a sight as I shall ever see.\n\nI have a shocking memory for names, but two other girls I remember there were Gussie and Paddy, the latter last heard of in Lasham.\n\nThen there was a spell in the New Forest at Minstead, where I was taught by my landlady’s husband to shoot and was introduced to poaching. This wasn’t successful, as whereas I excelled at hitting tins in the back garden, I just couldn’t kill a rabbit or anything else that moved, nor did I really want to. The fields at that farm were covered in wild daffodils in spring, an unforgettable sight.\n\nHurstbourne Priors, Martyr Worthy and Longparish, all such lovely villages, where we milked by hand, spread muck with horse and cart, hand-trimmed hedges and built hay and corn ricks; few combines about then.\n\nI have such treasured memories; of fetching the cows at 5:30 on a misty morning, standing by the gate hollering until the lumbering shapes appeared out of the mist, each one known by name. Of bread and cheese lunches in the hayfields and hedgerows, keeping ourselves mentally alert with the Daily Telegraph crossword. Of a steamy hot day during a bad harvest rescuing sheaves, green with shoots and disturbing a wasps’ nest, a 100 yds. sprint to the nearest tree and quick strip-off saving me from hysterics.\n\nAt Martyr Worthy, my landlady took me to a nearby copse one April evening to hear the nightingales; unforgettable. I wonder if they still sing there?\n\nMore names come to mind. Delphine (Stockbridge), Dorothy (Alton), Elizabeth (Longparish). Ah, Longparish; I met my husband there. He is a Londoner, loves towns and all their amenities, and thinks the countryside is only for visiting.\n\nWe made our home in Buckinghamshire, then Oxfordshire. Only recently have we come back to Hampshire to live. It is till a lovely county, but it was as a land girl during the war years that I saw it at its best.\n\nPublished in Hampshire Life, April 1979, pp. 5-6.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nFirst Name(s): Daphne Mary\n\nUnmarried Surname: Webb\n\nMarried Surname: Banks (widowed 1989).
