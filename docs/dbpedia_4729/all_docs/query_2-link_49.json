        "text": "Self-limiting beliefs can wreak havoc on your career advancement. But, you probably don't even realize you have one. Or more than one. Because they are beliefs you've accepted as true. Fun fact though - They are usually the farthest thing from truth. Here's how one of my favorite ones - \"𝘐'𝘮 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘦𝘯𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩,\" showed up a few years back. I was at an all-company event, and a newer colleague approached me to introduce themselves. The introduction was friendly, but it included one sentence that triggered all the emotions in me. \"[So-and-So] said, 'Jill knows how to get what she wants'.\" UGH. My stomach turned. I laughed it off: \"Yeah, I am good at navigating around.\" After they walked away, I immediately wondered what was behind those words when they were said to my colleague, largely because the person who said it was someone influential to me. \"They think I'm not good enough at my job, so I have to use other means (manipulation?) to get what I want.\" Why was that my first thought? Over the next few weeks, I began reflecting on how I routinely reverted to a negative story when given feedback or commentary about a skill or quality of mine. And the problem with that, is that those stories were impacting how I showed up. Quiet...less confident...Uncertain. Not exactly the qualities that scream \"THIS lady is meant for leadership!\" After I exhausted myself thinking about it, I finally had a moment where I asked myself, \"What if that statement had been slightly different?\" \"Jill knows how to get what she wants, making her an effective problem solver and someone who can get stuff done.\" Well, I know I never would have blinked. \"Yup, that's true!\" Because I 𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘸 it was my strength. I would have been proud to hear that. So why was I creating a different story that only served to weaken my confidence? What I finally embraced is the fact that there is immense power in knowing how to navigate toward your goals with determination and grace. It is a fantastic skill to own. But it IS a skill. And some are better at it than others. So 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 if someone had meant that sentence to be a dig on me, it likely had nothing to do with me and everything to do with them. 💡 Self-limiting beliefs are silent and we are often unaware of their presence. But they will stifle your career growth. Know your worth, your expertise, and your skills. And 𝗼𝘄𝗻 them if you want to advance your career. 💪🏼\n\n#SelfDiscovery Have you ever found yourself lying awake at night, replying social interactions and worrying about what others think about you? We live in a world where the opinions of others can seem like the ultimate measure of our worth.This constant worry about others' opinions can lead to a false view of ourselves and can trigger unnecessary social and societal anxiety that has insatiable desire in dictating our lives and careers. Think about the times you've changed your behavior just to conform, to meet what you perceive as societal standards.It's like wearing a mask!The more we seek external validation, the more we wander away from our true selves, leading to feelings of low self-esteem and loss of personal identity.The question is, are we living our lives for ourselves or for the approval of others? In the quietness of your own thoughts, find the courage to remove the mask of societal expectations and embrace the authentic, radiant you.#Assertyourselfworth Now, imagine a life where your decisions are guided by your personal values, not by societal expectations.Prioritizing self-compassion over societal approval is the first step towards true personal growth. It's about understanding what truly matters to you, what makes you, you.It should be you, you and NOT them,you.This self-awareness is a powerful tool for defining your unique self and career path in your life. #Emotions. Often, we blame external events for how we feel, but what if I told you that our emotions are more about our interpretations than the events themselves? Owning our emotional responses means recognizing that we have the power to choose how we react to life's challenges.This empowerment is a crucial step in taking control of our happiness. So, how can we develop a healthier self-perception? Start by understanding your core values.What are the principles that define you regardless of others' opinions? Focus on your personal journey, and accept that making mistakes is part and parcel personal and career growth.Remember, every step you take towards being true to yourself is a step towards genuine career fulfillment. Can you think of a time when you felt truly happy and at peace?What were you doing? Were you living by someone else's standards, or were you being authentically you? Personal stories like these, our own and others', remind us that our most fulfilling moments often come from being true to ourselves, not from seeking approval.Decide and defend your decisions.Be assertive!

For me, that \"thing\" was having an emotional breakdown in 2019 that changed the course of my entire life... I was sitting in a run of the mill meeting at work & as it came round to my turn to speak, my throat started closing up & my vision went blurry. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I was having a panic attack. I left the office and didn’t come back for 5 months after my GP signed me off. Back then, people thought my burnout was all to do with the stress of being promoted. 🪜But I now know that it was actually about being promoted into a job that I realised I’d never actually wanted in the first place. ⛓When I should’ve felt happy, I just felt completely trapped. 🙉And in hindsight, I can see there’d been a voice whispering to me for years about being in the wrong career. But I’d been ignoring it, hoping it would go away. It said things like: 🗣WTF are you still doing in this corporate job?? 🗣You KNOW you’re better than this. 🗣Why the hell are you tryna get promoted when you know you're meant to be working for yourself?? But I kept on ignoring it coz I thought it was too late to change career. It seemed completely impossible for someone like me. But in the end, my body & mind took matters into their own hands and gave me a full on breakdown to make me finally listen. And I did. The coaching I had to get me back to work gave me a lightbulb moment that changed my life. 💡What if I could become a coach and help other women going through what I was? So I studied my ass off on the side of my 9-5, set up my side business & the rest, as they say is history 🙌🏼 Which is why I'm so chuffing passionate about helping women like you escape the corporate rat race like I did. So, if that voice is whispering to you, please for the love of f*ck don;t ignore it like I did. Listen to it and do something about it. You have the chance to wake up every day feeling F*CKING ALIVE. Message me the word 'ESCAPE' to find out how I can help you do just that.\n\nUnpopular opinion: People who work in industries with a negative public perception aren't sell outs. This post by Daniel Mendez Arostica, MBA really got me thinking about the employers and clients I've worked with throughout my career. I've worked for some industries that probably made my friends raise an eyebrow. On the surface, the work that is done in the industry or the company itself might not seem like it aligns with my values. But what they don’t see is the reason why I’ve been hired. Communication is a key driver of change. All the organizations I have been a part of were working to be better tomorrow than they were today. The leaders have a vision for the direction of the company and they lead by modeling the values that will help them achieve the vision. As a communicator, I get to be a part of helping create a better experience for their employees and I get to find solutions to address any negative perceptions that the public might have about them. It’s exciting to see the work I do have a direct impact on the organization. I sleep well at night knowing the work I’m doing is making it easier for a colleague to feel comfortable at work when they haven’t felt accepted before or helping a disgruntled customer understand what the company is sincerely doing to address the problem that caused them to gain the negative reputation. An organization with the most pristine reputation in the world would be boring to work for because there is no room for improvement. Also, if I had turned down some of the opportunities because I didn’t take the time to look deeper at what the company needed, I would have missed out on some career defining opportunities. How do you pick the companies and clients you work for? #InternalCommunication #CorporateCommunication #ChangeCommunication #StrategicCommunication #SwingCommInsights\n\nAs we begin the journey through 2024 moving with purpose and courage in the new year we navigate the complexities of everyday life with boldness and resolve. It's crucial to recognize how the world has evolved over recent years, making it imperative to seize the moment amidst these uncertainties. This period presents an unparalleled opportunity to maximize our professional lives - whether that's by launching a new venture, confidently requesting a raise, or making bold career moves. Reflecting on a personal experience from 15 years ago, I recall being rejected for the position as local sales manager at a radio station where I worked. This moment in time became a pivotal moment, driving me to take control of my future. Embracing the mindset that the worst outcome could only be failure; I coined the phrase ‘Keep Moving’ to keep me focused. This journey of self-discovery and embracing my worth eventually led me to be today known as a Champion of Brands looking to expand into US on platforms like Amazon as the Visionary Leader of The Machine Agency. The lesson here is clear: Know Your Worth! The power of self-worth extends far beyond professional endeavors. It's a foundational element in developing a healthy self-esteem and a robust self-identity. Without recognizing our own value, it's nearly impossible to believe we're deserving of the respect and acceptance from others. The absence of self-worth can lead people into stay in negative work place, toxic relationships, self-defeating behaviors, and a cycle of negative self-talk. These patterns often stem from a deep-seated feeling of being undeserving of healthy, fulfilling relationships, and can get exacerbated in abusive situations, reinforcing self-doubt and perpetuating a sense of worthlessness. Having had a chance to meet folks who experienced neglect or abuse during childhood often faced challenges in forming secure attachments and maintaining a healthy sense of self-worth. This can lead to a range of emotional struggles, including depression and anxiety, and a tendency to engage in unhealthy relationship dynamics. It's also common for individuals raised in environments that didn't acknowledge their skills and competencies to struggle with feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem throughout their lives. As we navigate the complexities of our world today, it's more important than ever to recognize and embrace our worth. This understanding not only shapes our professional journey but also profoundly impacts our personal lives and relationships.

Our spouses and partners know, our kids know, our friends know, as do our colleagues who experience the manifestation of stress related illnesses. What’s missing is from this article is how do we change the narrative? In today’s fast-paced, achievement-oriented world, our careers often become the centerpieces of our identity. We chase after job titles and professional milestones with fervor, believing they are the ultimate markers of success. But what happens when we find ourselves lost in the race, disconnected from who we are outside of our work? The realization that our work has overshadowed our true selves can prompt a profound identity crisis, further complicated by societal perceptions of success and the value of stepping back followed by personal judgement in taking a role with less responsibility or merit. Society often heralds relentless hard work and climbing the professional ladder as the only paths to success, casting a shadow over the equally important journey of personal growth and self-discovery. The decision to pause one's career - to rediscover and redefine one's identity can seem counterintuitive, even rebellious, to societal norms. It's viewed through a lens of skepticism and, at times, pity, as if taking a moment to breathe and recalibrate one's priorities is a step backward rather than a strategic pivot forward. This perception can make the journey of finding oneself both inside and outside of work seem daunting. Stepping back isn't about giving up; it's about taking control of your life narrative, valuing quality over quantity, and understanding that you are more than your professional achievements and ultimately makes you more resilient. I've experienced firsthand the difficulty of untangling my identity from my career, especially under the weight of societal expectations. The process of stepping back to understand my values, passions, and what truly fulfills me has been a challenging but ultimately rewarding journey. #leadership #careerpath #redefinesuccess\n\nReflecting on 2023, a theme for me personally and others I know who look like me is the difficulty finding work as an older white male. While there may be no statistical validation to this theme, it appears real. I admit that I have gone through the stages of grief to land where I am today, with the realization that I do not get to complain about anything. Throughout my career, I benefitted from the unearned privilege that comes with being an educated, straight white guy. I was the lottery winner. I do not recall ever feeling like I was on the receiving end of bias, whether in a status meeting or an interview. It literally never crossed my mind. I just went to work. But did I ever have a bias towards others? Yes. Even in my best moments, I did not escape bias because it showed up in ways I wasn't even aware. An embarrassing admission. Today, real or perceived, I am self-conscious about my demographic and the negative thoughts others may have about me as a result. I say this fully realizing others, with years of experiencing bias, are likely shaking their heads at my quaint observation. Poor baby. What now? First, I say this out loud. Next, I live life in the real world like everyone else. Lastly, I try to effect change by helping companies, especially those with the best intentions, acknowledge and address their biases. Bias is a survivor because, like a cancer, it morphs to remain invisible. Those of us who represent the traditional power structure have a responsibility to make change. #DEI #changeagents #equity #organizationalchange\n\nHave you ever been called a \"sellout\" because you've worked with \"the bad guys\"? I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Throughout my career, I’ve faced the challenge of aligning my personal beliefs with industries that, unfortunately, have negative public perceptions. However, those industries also share a common denominator: they allow progress for humanity. It's tough to hear the criticism, but I try to understand where those people are coming from. It's a tricky balance, but here's how I manage it. First, staying true to yourself is crucial. If you work in #commsjobs, you know it's tough to tell a story you don't believe in. Of course, we all have basic needs to consider – bills to pay, families to support – so it's not always feasible to work only in sectors that perfectly align with our values. But I've found that focusing on what I can control helps me navigate this balance. I try to find areas where I can make a positive impact, even if small, and focus on those opportunities to shift perceptions. I've always thought that driving change from within is the best and most effective form of activism. Also, it's important to note that as science and technology progress, we become aware of more things that we didn't know in the past. Industries evolve, and staying informed about the latest trends and ethical practices helps me understand the root of the issues and push for necessary changes, when possible. Last but not least, I aim to align my work with my well-being. Working in an environment that conflicts with my values isn't sustainable. If I'm losing sleep and feeling the impact of my job in my personal life, then it's time to move on. How do you navigate these challenges? I would love to read your comments.\n\nIs Your Job Crushing Your Joy? Why People Don't Leave and What to Do if You Want to Move On. Over the years I have coached executives who clearly were in a role or environment that didn't match their values, purpose or goals anymore. The biggest barrier to them leaving? Fear. Maybe not fully conscious fear, but the little micro messages running through their heads. Messages like: \"I'm not qualified for anything else.\" \"Maybe it will get better.\" \"I'll just wait until my toxic boss quits.\" \"What I really want to do isn't possible.\" \"I know this job, so it's safer to stay.\" Sound familiar? Of course there are other reasons people don't go (sole breadwinner, shortage of jobs, etc..) but the narrative people create around leaving is typically the biggest barrier. Because those other situations can often be solved. So how do you know if it's time to go? As someone who made the leap 20 years ago, there wasn't one perfect crystal moment of clarity. But there was a huge amount of tension inside of me pushing me forward. Some things to pay attention to: 🔹 Are you stressed most of the time? 🔹 Are you not sleeping well at night? 🔹 Do you have a dream of something else you want to do that keeps surfacing, even after you push it away? 🔹 Do you feel valued? 🔹 Do you feel like you are using your talents and gifts? 🔹 Do you feel JOY? Your job may be a great job for someone, but may not be the right job for you. I recently watched America's Sweethearts on Netflix (the show about the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders). I tend to watch most reality shows through the lens of my work (noticing strong leaders and how people behave at work). One DCC, Victoria, was a 4 year veteran. All of these women have incredible careers, the DCC is a side job. Victoria in her full time work, teaches dance, is a strong leader and connector and you can see her joy and confidence. In the DCC, something happens to her. She is less confident, less happy. And even though it's a dream job for so many, you can plainly see that while she is amazingly talented, it's not the space that feeds her soul. In fact, it has been in some ways detrimental to her health (both mental and physical). I was so happy to see she made the courageous decision to leave and pursue her full time career. Because it does take courage, and hope and the belief in what's possible. We are told from a young age, we have to take a certain path. But there are SO many paths we can take. Ways we can use all of our transferable skills in new arenas. Ways we can continue to expand our capabilities and our joy. If this resonates for you, take some time to think about what's possible vs. what's hard and don't be afraid to take the leap. 20 years later, it was the best thing I ever did for myself! If you find yourself stuck, I work with clients to help them find their sweet spot between capabilities, passions and opportunities. Let's talk! www.envisionleaders.com\n\n“Who will I be in 10 years?” Someone else. In a world where change is the only constant, professionals often find themselves at the crossroads of personal and professional identity. Whether transitioning from a medium to a large organization, shifting careers, or returning to work after a significant life event like maternity leave, the question of 'Who am I?' becomes more pronounced. Recently, while coaching a client transitioning from a high-powered finance role to the realm of life coaching, a profound moment of realization occurred. As they voiced their fears and aspirations, it dawned on us both that this journey was less about changing careers and more about discovering a truer self. What was interesting was their comment ‘I realise that as a human being, I am a constant ‘work in progress’. As an adult, especially, I mistakenly thought to be finished but I now realise that my current mental model, values and principles are fundamentally different from the ones that informed my past career choice’. So, what are the advantages of recognising that that you’re not the same person you were in the past and that your future self will also be a different person that who you currently are? Research indicates that actually perceiving your future self as a different person is helpful for decision-making as it enables you to have greater empathy for your future self, to understand what will matter to that person and to utilize that perspective to make better decisions today. Have you found yourself pondering your professional identity lately? What would change if you explored your professional identity from the standing point that in 10 years’ time you will be someone else compared to today? #ProfessionalGrowth #Identity #PersonalDevelopment"
