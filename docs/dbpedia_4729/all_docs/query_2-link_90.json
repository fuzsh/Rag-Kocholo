As a kid, I had watched this actress on the telly in her supporting role in the sitcom, To The Manor Born (1979-81). Decades later, I discovered her in a surprising cameo in one of my movie watches with Darlin Husband. These roles appear to have been serendipitously filmed at the same time and both the sitcom and this movie add much to our understanding of the leading characters.\n\nThere is more on that cameo revealed later. I’ve written about it after a little about her comic character… just in case you want to look away now and find this cameo for yourself…\n\nTo The Manor Born (1979-81)…\n\nTo the Manor Born: Mr Convenient, surefinewhatever\n\nI remembered Angela primarily from To The Manor Born (1979-2007) in this supporting role as the middle aged (and quite frumpily dressed), Marjory Frobisher. In this very British sitcom, Marjory Frobisher (Angela Thorne) is the main character, Audrey fforbes-Hamilton’s best buddy and they are lifelong friends from their school days.\n\nIn the first episode, Grantleigh we are introduced to both these women as they attend Audrey’s late husband Marton’s funeral. Cue canned laughter as she screams with delight at his funeral in a surprising reaction when she is alone with Marjory. Audrey discovers that she has to sell his ancestral home, Grantleigh Manor for financial reasons. Naturally, this peeves this recent widow who was minutes before literally a merry widow who was looking forward to swanning about as lady of the manor.\n\nAt Marton’s funeral, she meets the entrepreneur and owner of Cavendish Foods, Richard de Vere (Peter Bowles) and she mistakes him for the caterer. Richard is a handsome and single divorcee and he later buys her former home after he outbids her when Grantleigh Manor is auctioned.\n\nAudrey discovers to her horror, that Richard is a nouveau riche, self-made millionaire supermarket owner and of Czechoslovakian and Polish descent. All these reasons irk the upper class and terribly patriotic English, Audrey making this a now quite dated and “of its time” comedy. Audrey has to now move to the Manor’s lodge and yet still has a butler and Rolls Royce.\n\nAngela’s character, Marjory Frobisher quite fancies Richard from the first moment she spots him at Marton’s funeral. Throughout the series, poor Marjory is always on the receiving end having to listen to the snobbish, Audrey’s constant gripes about this entrepreneur, to whom both women are more than obviously attracted.\n\nMarjory also seems genuinely in love with Peter Bowles’ charismatic and charming character. She always seems quite besotted with him, yet it’s her best friend that he has the will they, won’t they relationship with. I always found Marjory the nicer, gentler, less judgemental and more genuine character. Looking back at this series, I couldn’t believe she’d stayed friends with for Audrey so long. This is as Audrey seems to think of herself as superior to her friend, and he puts her down (with the worst possible use of canned laughter) and seems quite snippy with her.\n\nMarjory is – as she would probably describe herself – a great sport in putting up with this friend. But luckily at times, Audrey’s flaws and personality bounce off Marjory. The series shows Audrey as quite a horrible, snobby and direct woman, with her softer side seen later in the series. The British Comedy Guide HERE adds this amusing and very telling quote of their thoughts about Richard in a scene where they discuss this man.\n\nAudrey: “Don’t be fooled by the suntan, and the hair attractively greying at the temples, and that mysterious aura of power.”\n\nMarjory: “You see! You do find him attractive!”\n\nAudrey: “I am simply saying that he looks as if he’s stepped straight out of Barbara Cartland. It all comes out of bottles, you know.”\n\nMarjory: “I just adore that twinkle in his eye when he looks at one!”\n\nAudrey: “Twinkle? That’s a nervous tic!”\n\nMarjory: “Well I suppose it might be when he looks at you.”\n\nThis was then a must watch comedy series, and it was usually aired in the pre-watershed TV spot. To The Manor Born lasted three seasons and Angela starred in each of the 22 episodes, yet it felt like more (in a good way, back then). Years later in 2007, she joined many of the original cast as they reunited for a one off Christmas special.\n\nIt’s clear from the start that Richard and Audrey will be embroiled in a will they, won’t they relationship throughout the series run. Although Marjory lost out to Richard’s affections, Angela’s off screen love was more fruitful after Peter Penry-Jones – Angela’s off-screen husband – was seen in a role for two episodes as Richard’s business rival. Other supporting characters seen throughout the series included Gerald Sim who played the Vicar, and Daphne Heard who played Richard’s elderly mother, Mrs Polouvicka otherwise known as Mrs Poo.\n\nand the moment you’ve been waiting for…\n\nA cameo in the action film, North Sea Hijack / ffolkes (1980)…\n\nMore recently I spotted Angela Thorne in a small cameo in a now much loved Roger Moore action movie from 1980. In her role as “Woman on Train”, Angela bizarrely continues her appearances with the leading characters with a double small “ff” in their surname. This is as she appears in the action film with a titular title in ffolkes – or as it’s more remembered as North Sea Hijack (1980). This movie, in one (review) I did earlier tells of,\n\nA cat loving, whisky drinking, bearded misogynist (Roger Moore) and his frogmen take on some terrorists (led by Anthony Perkins) in a North Sea oil rig.\n\nThis titular role is one that Roger Moore took earnestly, believing that his leading character did not show any of James Bond’s attributes. As did Perkins in his role, who took his part as he wanted a break from evil characters, yet here he is a crazed ringleader of the bad guys. But you’ll see that they kinda did these roles they tried to avoid.\n\nJoining them is James Mason doing what he does best. Mason is cast as a stuffy British Admiral who visits ffolkes in his “Scottish” castle (filmed in Ireland). He then enlists ffolkes and his band of ffrogmen ffusiliers for this mission in overcoming these bad guys…\n\nAngela appears in a credited cameo and is seen 5 minutes in. The scene shows ffolkes taking a train to London. He niggles her and she irritates him after he takes a seat in the same carriage. He clearly horrifies her as he drinks whisky straight from the bottle, then settles down to do his needlework of a cat (as he does). She smokes and this annoys him in this first class non-smoking carriage where he mansplains in no uncertain terms what this means.\n\nHer appearance is a one off and only seen early on in this movie. It is an important scene as it introduces and establishes his ffolkes character’s attributes and flaws in all their wonder. In this scene, Moore’s performance sums up this action man character in this short scene as it shows his love of cats, needlework and whisky, his British eccentricity and dress and his hatred of the fairer sex.\n\nInterestingly, later on in this same film – and probably, much to ffolkes’ dismay – the Prime Minister in this film is also a woman. Just 2 years later, Angela took the leading role of the one-time, British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. This was in the TV Movie satire and comedy, Anyone for Denis? (1982).\n\nSo do keep your eyes peeled next time you see North Sea Hijack. Angela’s nameless character is clearly another upper class and snobbish character. Her performance in this role reminded me of To the Manor Born’s Audrey. As you see “Woman on Train” looking down her nose at ffolkes, you could believe in this scene that she would also be to the manor born. Had she later been revealed as the fictional Prime Minister or even Margaret Thatcher, this would have been a fabulous twist on Angela’s character in North Sea Hijack, and certainly stopped ffolkes in his tracks."
