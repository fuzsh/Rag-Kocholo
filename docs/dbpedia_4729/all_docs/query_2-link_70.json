        "text": "May 24, 1924 – July 23, 2015\n\nDaphne died peacefully early Thursday morning following a brief stay at Victoria Hospice. She was predeceased in 1987 by her husband of 33 years, George Walter Baldwin (1928-1987), and is survived by her children Andrew (Karli), Elizabeth (Anthony), Matthew (Susan) and Jennifer (Michael); grandchildren Anastasia, Luke, Samuel, Ewan, Eleanor and Thomas; and cat Pepper.\n\nMum was born and raised in Oak Bay, graduated from Norfolk House (1941) in a class of 6 girls, attended Victoria College in Craigdarroch Castle (1941-1943) and, after a hiatus of five years, completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in History and English at UBC, where she met George. They were married in 1954 and moved to Prince George “for two years” – which became 47. Her time in Prince George was spent raising her family, to whom she was devoted, and caring for the many family pets over the years. She had a wide circle of friends, and maintained contact, by her indefatigable letter-writing, with relatives and childhood friends all over the world. Despite being, she alleged, shy and reserved, she was involved in a number of local activities, serving as chairman of the library board, Girl Guide commissioner, and in various capacities with the Alaska Music Trail, the Prince George Symphony Orchestra, the Concert Society, and St. Michael’s Anglican Church. She also served provincially on the Library Development Commission and the Heritage Trust, and was a judge for the Lieutenant-Governor’s Award for books on local history. She and George were also involved with the grassroots movement that led to establishment of the University of Northern British Columbia, and she was a loyal supporter of the university even after she left Prince George. In 2001, Mum moved back to Oak Bay, to the address of her childhood home, though she rebuilt the house. She enjoyed the intellectual and cultural activities in Victoria, and was a strong supporter of the Victoria Symphony, Pacific Opera Victoria, the Royal B.C. Museum, among many others, and a steadfast member of St. Mary’s Anglican Church (Oak Bay), which she had attended as a child. Throughout our lives, all of us received the benefit of her patience, her unstinting and unconditional love, her gently-expressed disapproval, her support, her impeccable manners and her wonderfully gentle sense of humour and fun. It seemed the kettle was always on in Mum’s kitchen, and the tins full of home baking for all who visited. She exemplified grace, dignity, and loving kindness.\n\nWe would like to thank the Royal Jubilee Hospital and Victoria Hospice staff.\n\nA funeral service will be held at St. Mary’s Anglican Church in Oak Bay (Elgin Road) at 10 a.m. on Friday, July 31, 2015.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to St. Mary’s Anglican Church, the BCSPCA, Knowledge Network, or Pacific Opera Victoria.\n\nCondolences may be offered to the family below."
