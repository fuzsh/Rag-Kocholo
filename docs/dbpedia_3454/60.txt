Piamenta was born in Jerusalem in 1951 to Yehuda and Genia Piamenta. In 1962, when he was 12 years old, Piamenta moved with his family to Tel Aviv. There, he received his first guitar from his uncle, Albert Piamenta, an Israeli saxophonist. Growing up, he practiced traditional Judaism.

In his 20s, Piamenta moved to New York together with his brother, Avi Piamenta, with the intention of working on a joint album with American saxophone player Stan Getz. The album was a success, but Piamenta disapproved of the entertainment industry lifestyle and turned to religion, joining the Orthodox Jewish community.

Piamenta lived in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for over 20 years before moving back to Israel to reside near his father. Piamenta said that he moved back to Israel permanently. He said, “My father, who is 80, called me in New York and said, ‘Come back to Israel, be with me a little’. He never talked in that tone before, and I decided to come back.

In August 2014, Piamenta, together with Avi Piamenta and Naftali Kalfa, released a single, “Yaancha,” calling it a “prayer for Piamenta’s recovery”. On 14 April 2015, Piamenta’s Facebook page disclosed that “Yosi is not doing well” and asked fans to “Please pray your hearts out”. On 17 April 2015 Piamenta fell into a coma; he woke up from the coma two days later. Piamenta underwent surgery for cancer at the Sheba Medical Center. He passed away in New York on August 23rd, 2015.

Piamenta’s inspiration lives on through his music, dedication and warmth. May his Neshama have an Aliyah.
