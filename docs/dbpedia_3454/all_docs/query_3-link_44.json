        "text": "Pioneers For A Cure - Songs To Fight Cancer was started in 2008 to raise funds in support of organizations pioneering new methods of cancer treatment and research. Pioneers For A Cure is the largest showcase of cancer charities on the web. Called '[A] stellar model of artist-driven grassroots philanthropy' by National Geographic, the non-profit project records public domain songs, reinterpreted by contemporary artists and made available on the organization's website. for downloading for a modest donation. Over 100 songs have been recorded by dozens of artists from around the world including Suzanne Vega, Ben E. King, Tom Chapin, Tom Verlaine, Matt White and David Broza. Proceeds from song downloads are donated to artist-selected cancer charities such as the American Cancer Society, St. Jude Children's Hospital, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Pioneers For A Cure is sponsored by Joodayoh, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe organization began with ‘The Postcard Project,’[1] gathering many Jewish musical artists to record the music of the pioneers of Israel (The Chalutzim).[2][3] The songs were then posted on the Pioneers For A Cure website, where users make micro-donations[4] to artist-selected cancer charities and receive song downloads in return.\n\n‘The Postcard Project’ was inspired by the postcards used to disseminate the music of the Chalutzim in the years preceding the creation of the modern state of Israel.[5] In an attempt to create a cultural base, composers were commissioned by the Keren Kayemet (now also known as The Jewish National Fund) to write new folk music, a soundtrack to the formation of the nation. The words and melodies were printed on postcards, which were mailed across Palestine, Europe, and Asia Minor.[6]\n\n‘The Israel Sessions’ is a more recent project of PFAC, featuring 16 songs recorded in Israel by producer Greg Wall and engineer Dave Richards in August, 2009.[7] In addition, several songs have been recorded for the forthcoming ‘American Sessions,’ featuring classic American songs by popular artists.\n\nIn 2009, Pioneers released the single “Am Yisrael Chai,”[1] featuring over 40 performers, edited by Keith Olsen and mixed by Bob Clearmountain.\n\nThe Pioneers For A Cure organization includes Music Producer Greg Wall, Executive Producer Beth Ravin, Chief Recording Engineer Dave Richards, artist Mira Sasson and Joodayoh, Inc. Executive Director Ricky Orbach.\n\nIn January 2011 Pioneers For A cure launched its new website,[8] enabling donations to cancer charities. Website design and development by WhiteLabel.[9]\n\nOn October 17, 2011, The Huffington Post featured an interview with Suzanne Vega in which the singer discusses her work with Pioneers For A Cure.[10]\n\nThe Pioneer Portraits\n\n[edit]\n\nIsraeli artist Mira Sasson has painted portraits of dozens of the Pioneers For A Cure artists, including Ben E. King, Lorin Sklamberg, David Broza, Basya Schechter, Neshama Carlebach, Noah Solomon, Tovah Feldshuh, and Dudu Fisher.\n\nSasson was born in 1965 in Bnei-Brak, Israel, and began drawing and painting as a child. In addition to other work, Sasson has illustrated and authored several children's books published in Israel. The books are currently being translated for publishing in the United States.[11]\n\nPioneers For A Cure Award Gala\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 22, 2009, Pioneers For A Cure celebrated its first \"Pioneer Of The Year Award\" with a gala event at the Salmagundi Club in New York City with more than 250 friends and supporters.
