Psachya started playing piano \"by ear\" when he was four years old, and started formal lessons with his mother, a piano teacher of some note (no pun intended,) when he was six years old, and then continued his music lessons with Mrs. Jenny Glickman, the greatest piano teacher in the world. (Her other students would surely agree.)\n\nPsachya’s love for music, came from his parents, who instilled in him not only a love for music, but a love for Yiddishkeit as well. Psachya’s siblings, Shalom and Channie (Levoritz) also helped out by not complaining about Psachya’s endless hours of practicing.\n\nFor High school, Psachya attended the old “Mesivta And Yeshiva Toras Emes Kaminetz.” (There were these two twins - the Radin Twins, in the grade below him, but that's a whole other story.) The yeshiva had a band before Psachya joined them, and that band consisted of two future members of “Kabbalah,” (- the band, not the Madonna cult). For Psachya’s junior and senior year in Kaminetz High School, Psachya was the bandleader of the Kaminetz Yeshiva High School Band. (The other member of the band was a drummer named Chaim Snow, who also made important, if extramusical, contributions to this album. Again, a whole ‘nother story.)\n\nPsachya then went on to continue his Yeshiva learning for two more years in Beis Hamedrash, at Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Jerusalem, Israel (along with those same Radin Twins again!) and got used to playing at many simchas in Jerusalem. When Psachya came back to the States, he discovered that one can actually get paid to play simchas. (!!!) So after majoring in music at Brooklyn College, Psachya leaped recklessly into the Jewish Music “Simcha” scene. By now, Psachya has already played at thousands of simchas for over 100 different orchestras and bands (and at least one ensemble.) To quote, “In all seriousness, I have tried my hardest to make each simcha unique and special, as it is to each Baal Simcha. I try to, as they say, ‘leave it all on the floor.’”\n\nIn addition to the simchas, Psachya has also played at numerous shows. Psachya is the accordionist for The Kleztraphobix, one of the most innovative bands on the Klezmer scene today (plug plug!) with two albums out - The Kleztraphobix and Another Bottle of Vodka. Psachya was also, for many years, the first call as pianist/keyboardist in the Homowack Hotel house band, and have thus had the privilege of backing up some of the better-known names in Jewish music. Psachya’s CD album appearances, include the two Kleztraphobix albums, a guest appearance (on accordion) on the Soulfarm album “Unwind,” keys on Michuel Schnitzler's “Simcha Chassidi,” (Rav) Shmuel Skaist’s “B’yameinu”, and Yaakov Shwekey’s “L’shem Shomayim”, among others. Anyway, after many years of playing other people's music, Psachya has finally decided to allow himself to be pushed by those ever always – there, “Radin twins” – thank G-d for them, - into finally releasing a CD album of his own original compositions, called “Shattered Glass.” Now, Psachya is being produced and managed by those same Radin twins, known as Shirei Achim Productions, Inc. – the most talented production company in the Jewish entertainment business. (See how things come full circle?)\n\nOn a much more serious note, Psachya has said, “I write from my heart, and I think it shows in my compositions and in my performances - at least I hope so. I sincerely hope that you will all enjoy my music.”\n\nOn a more personal note (again, no pun intended!), Psachya presently lives with his lovely family including his amazing wife Mira, and his sweet children Aryeh Leib, Motty, and Devorah Gitty, in beautiful Highland Park, New Jersey. ”They are the most wonderful family I could ever ask for, and they are the inspiration for my ‘Shattered Glass’ CD album. You guys are the greatest!”\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:\n\nThe Making of\n\nPSACHYA - “SHATTERED GLASS”\n\nBy: Yaakov (Jay) Radin, Executive Producer, and Co-Chairman of Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\n© ® 2012, Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nIt is time once again to hop on to the way-back machine. Let’s turn the way-back dial to the end of the summer of 1984. Ah, the good ol’ days! I, and my twin brother, Yisroel “Yissi” (Stuart) Radin, have just arrived for our first year of learning in Yeshiva (Beis Hamedrash,) in Yerushalayim, Eretz Yisroel. We were learning in Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Sanhedria Mochevet in Jerusalem. We came from 4 years of high school at Mesivta And Yeshiva Toras Emes Kaminetz, Joseph S. Gruss Yeshiva High School, in Boro Park, Brooklyn, New York. We were told that there would still be some second year Beis Hamedrash students returning, who attended our high school one year ahead of us. Well, one of those Talmidim was none other than Psachya Septimus. We had been very close with Psachya for the first three years that we were in high school, and now to be reunited with him once again, was a fabulous treat! Psachya was a member of the band in our high school, but now, he had started his own ensemble, in the Miklat – the “Bomb Shelter,” under the basement of the Yeshiva, in Israel. It was there that I started seriously watching Psachya play daily during lunch, and every other break from learning that there was. Psachya played at every Mesibah and Chagigah for the Yeshiva, and then he discovered that he could make money playing outside the Yeshiva, for weddings and for Bar Mitzvahs etc. It was later that year, that I had the opportunity to produce and to put together a small concert for the Yeshiva students there, and I used Psachya as the keyboardist, and as the band leader. We videotaped a few rehearsals, and some joking around before the show, and it was there, on that videotape, that Psachya and I jokingly discussed the possible future of my becoming his producer, with Psachya becoming the serious artist. And that one day, maybe, instead of my producing some obscure Shlock performance for a bunch of local yeshiva guys, I would produce the newly established artist, known as “Psachya.” Well, after some twenty eight years have quickly passed, now our friendly banter for the video camera, has finally become a fulfilled prophecy. However, you should know that making this CD Album has not been in the works for those full twenty eight years. You see, Psachya left the Yeshiva in the summer of 1985. My brother and I stayed in Israel through 1986 and then returned to the Diaspora, and attended the Yeshiva in Queens, NY and graduated from Touro College. Although we opened our own small record label, known as, “Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.” in 1987, we hadn’t seen Psachya until many years later, when Psachya was playing as the one man band for our cousin’s Bar Mitzvah. Wow! After all of these years, our original keyboardist had actually successfully made it into the mainstream Jewish music “Simcha” business. I must add that Psachya had been keeping an eye on us, for all of that time, as well. He knew about our other productions, and about our successful careers as well. We exchanged business cards, and I told Psachya, that if he is ever ready to make an album, he should give me a call. With some hesitation, Psachya revealed that he indeed has a few songs already, and he will think about it, and when he finally comes to a decision, he will let me know. Well, years passed, and we have been bumping into each other on and off over the years. But it was a weekend retreat in late December 2001, that made things get real interesting. Psachya was the keyboardist for the Motzei Shabbos entertainment for that weekend retreat with Rabbi Dovid Goldwasser, who is my Rav, and who was hosting that Shabbos retreat in New Jersey, at the time. After the show, Psachya and I went reminiscing again for a few hours, and I once again urged Psachya to call me when he was ready to record his own CD Album. A few months passed, and in the Summer of 2002, I bumped into Psachya again, this time, at the Homowack Hotel, where Psachya had become the pianist and keyboard player of the Homowack Hotel House Band. It was then that Psachya asked me, once again, for my business card. Within a few days, Psachya faxed me a note of interest and a letter of intent for me to listen to his new demo CD, and he expressed interest in my producing his first CD Album. Wow! I listened to the demo CD, and I was fascinated by what I heard! The songs, “Melech Rachaman,” and “Hashem Ori,” (which, of course, appear on this CD Album,) were my immediate favorites, and I began working on how I would produce those tunes. I called Psachya back, and I told him that all that we needed now was just a few more songs to complete the CD Album. Psachya told me that he will get back to me, as soon as the other songs were to be ready. I didn’t bother telling Psachya that I had not really produced anything since 1990, or about my utter disappointment in the way Jewish music was “musically” going. In fact, I felt that his new CD Album would be wasted on the Jewish music scene the way things currently were, at the time, so I held off from chasing Psachya. Psachya himself got very busy working every night with Neginah and Shelly Lang Orchestras. Then in December 2004, at another cousin’s Bar Mitzvah, Psachya was the one-man keyboardist again. We hung out together, just like old times, and we even experimented on some new sounds and styles on certain old songs that was part of that evening’s repertoire. I then told Psachya that I was leaving to Israel in a few weeks to produce a new CD Album for Meir Simcha. I could tell from Psachya’s face that he was thinking that it should have been him that I was producing instead. So I assured him that when I was done working on Meir Simcha’s CD Album, I would then jump into working on Psachya’s CD Album. Hey, I’ve gone with a dry spell for fifteen years, so I deserve to produce two albums in a row. Why not? Well believe it or not, the “Can You Hear Us Now?” CD Album from Meir Simcha took a lot longer to produce than originally thought, and by now, - it was Pesach, 2005, and Meir Simcha’s CD Album still had not been released yet. Producing Psachya’s CD Album had still not become a real reality, at least, not yet.\n\nBecause my wife, Judy, gave birth to my third child, Yosef Meir, earlier in the year of 2005, (actually Judy gave birth to Yosef Meir just as I arrived back from Israel, from producing Meir Simcha’s new CD Album,) I decided that we would go away for Pesach. So off to the Homowack Hotel we went, where once again, there was Psachya as a member of the Homowack House Band. Psachya and I hung out back stage together, every day of Chol Hamoed Peasch, dabbling on some music stuff; and then, suddenly, and purely out of the blue, when there was nobody else around; Psachya tells me that I must hear his latest song. “Oh! You gotta hear this one!” That was all he said. He then started playing the piano, for my own personal performance. He played for me, “Shattered Glass.”\n\nThat was it!\n\nI was now ready!\n\nI looked at Psachya, and with every ounce of seriousness in my face I asked him, “Will you come to Israel with me this summer?”\n\nAnd the rest is history!\n\nPsachya and I left for Israel on a very early Sunday morning on July 31, 2005. On that Monday morning we arrived in Jerusalem and went straight to the studio. We spent every waking minute in the studio, only to stop for Shabbos and for Tisha B’Av itself. Otherwise, every moment was spent on this album. (Well, we did take a few hours off, to go pray at the Kever of the Babaa Salli, and to go to Chevron, and to visit David Hamelech himself, not to mention going to the Kotel daily for davenning Shacharis, and Maariv at 2:00 A.M. in the morning.) We didn’t do much sleeping, even though we did have the Presidential Suite in Jerusalem’s luxurious Jerusalem Pearl Hotel, A”H. Every morning we had a quick breakfast with Nachum Segal and his family, and with Yossi Piamenta, who tried so hard to get to the studio for some guitar overdubs for this CD Album, but to no avail. And we even bumped into Avraham Fried with his son. So every day, we were asked by everyone, “Nu! How is it going?” With only a few days to complete everything, (and by the way,) nobody thought that we could possibly pull it off in time – before we were scheduled to leave Israel, to head back to the United States; but we did. We even had enough time to video shoot some segments of the soon – to – be – released - music video of “Shattered Glass,” in the Hillel Café in Jerusalem, where the tragedy of the song actually took place. And we also had the opportunity of recording the song, “Shattered Glass” live in the recording studio, in front of Mrs. Applebaum, herself. That was an experience that neither I nor Psachya will ever forget! In fact, that recording studio event was also filmed for a soon – to – be – released – video DVD documentary on the making of the song, the song itself, and of the actual tragic story, as well.\n\nWe ended our last recording session, just in the nick of time, because the recording studio was then rented to another group, and we were forced at that time to call it quits, and besides we had to catch our flight back to our families in the United States. Just as I left the studio, I was told via my cell phone, that there were still some things that I would still have to sit over, to go through for final editing, that can not be completed without me actually sitting there in the recording studio. So as soon as I got back to Flatbush, I said hello to my wife and to my kids, I spent Shabbos at home, and then I immediately turned around and flew alone, right back to Israel to finish up this CD Album. Psachya was now too busy playing the Homowack Hotel for Shabbos Nachamu, and getting back into things performing for the many many Simchas in the Jewish Music Simcha scene. I, in the meantime was back in the Holy Land, in Jerusalem, Israel, finishing up the job. Everyone thought that I was nuts! I didn’t even get a chance to unpack! I was back in Israel, and back in the studio, and back to work!\n\nAfter fixing everything up, and let me tell you, doing a lot of final “fixing and editing,” (and doing it all without Psachya himself being there in the recording studio with us, which turned out to be am incredible feat – a feat that that for that alone, I should win the “Producer of the Year” award;) the CD Album was now finally ready for the final mixing and mastering.\n\nTwenty one years of waiting (from 1984,) has finally been completed!\n\nThat was in 2005.\n\nNow, in 2012, 7 more years have gone by, (making it 28 years now in total,) and this beautiful CD Master has sat on my shelf for close to 7 years, waiting for the “Right Moment” to bring this CD to the Jewish Music public. And I have been told that NOW is the “Right Moment!”\n\nSo it is with my deepest and heartfelt pleasure, that I am now able to finally present to you: PSACHYA – “Shattered Glass.”\n\nA Shirei Achim Producrion!\n\nPsachya: We have made the journey all this way together. And I’m not yet ready to get off this ride, just right now! Let’s see how far we can take this thing!”\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nYaakov (Jay) Radin\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nCo-Chairman of Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nNovember, 2012\n\nPSACHYA’S SPECIAL THANKS:\n\nTHANK YOU, HASHEM\n\nShehecheyanu V’kimanu V’higianu Lazman Hazeh!\n\nDEDICATION: This album is dedicated to the loving memory of my Zeidy, LOUIS LIPPMAN\n\n(Alter Yom Tov Lipa Ben Aleksander, A”H).

MELECH RACHAMAN\n\nThe song says it all. Our yearning goes on… – Psachya\n\nThis prayer is recited on the 3 Festival (Pilgrimage) Holidays - (“Shalosh Regalim.”) During the actual Holiday Days, (Yom Tov – the “Chagim,”) and during the Intermediate Days of that holiday season, this prayer is recited in The Musaf Amidah – Shemoneh Esrei. Right before concluding the central portion of this Musaf Amidah – Shemoneh Esrei, we ask Hashem to have mercy on us, and to return to us, and to rebuild the Holy Temple in its designated spot.\n\nThe Iyun Tefilah explains the meaning of describing Hashem as “…O Good And Beneficent One…” In the case of human beings, someone may be good, but not have the resources to benefit others. On the other hand, someone may benefit others by helping them do good deeds, but for himself he may prefer to indulge his sinful nature. G-D however, is perfect – He is both - Good And Beneficent.\n\nMusic Composed by: Psachya Septimus\n\nLyrics: (Musaf Amidah – Shemoneh Esrei For The “Shalosh Regalim.”)\n\nArranged by: Jeff Horvitz, Creative Audio, Israel\n\nEngineered by: Amit Golan & Eli Yonah – Creative Audio, Israel\n\nProduced by: Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nYaakov (Jay) Radin, Executive Producer\n\nYissi (Stuart) Radin, Producer\n\n© ® 2012, Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nO merciful King, have mercy on us,\n\nO good and beneficent One,\n\nLet Yourself be sought out by us;\n\nReturn to us in Your yearning mercy,\n\nFor the sake of the forefathers who did Your will.\n\nRebuild Your house as it was at first,\n\nAnd establish Your Sanctuary on its prepared site;\n\nShow us its rebuilding,\n\nAnd gladden us in its perfection.\n\n(Musaf Amidah – Shemoneh Esrei For The “Shalosh Regalim.”)\n\n2.) Al Tivt’chu\n\nThe last word on politics, written by Dovid Hamelech, an expert in the field. – Psachya\n\n“Hashem is the One Who cares for the underprivileged and oppressed, despite the current ascendancy of our enemies.” This is the topic of Psalms, Chapter 146. Although this Psalm is better known as the first of the 5 “Hallelukah” Paragraphs recited in every day’s Shacaharis (during the “Pesukei Dezimrah,” portion of the prayer, right after the “Ashrei” prayer is recited.) This prayer, (“Praise Hashem O’ my soul!”) as is explained and interpreted by The RADAK, is a psalm written as a hymn of encouragement for the Jews who are in exile. It begins with the Psalmist insisting “Hallelukah! Praise Hashem, O’ my soul! I will praise Hashem while I live, and I will make music to my G-D while I exist…” Then the Psalmist also warns his fellow Jews not to rely on human beings. After praising Hashem as “The One Who cares for the underprivileged and oppressed,” the Psalmist concludes that “Hashem will reign forever – despite the current ascendancy of our enemies.”\n\nThe RADAK further explains that when the Psalmist writes, “Do not rely on nobles, nor on a human being…” this is even when rulers help Israel. For when it is that rulers are helping Israel, it is only because Hashem has influenced them to do so. So it will be when the nations seem to have a hand in the Messianic redemption.\n\n(Psalms: Chapter 146. Verses 3 – 5.)\n\nMusic Composed by: Psachya Septimus\n\nLyrics: (Psalms: Chapter 146.

Verses 3 – 5.)\n\n3.) Ani L’Dodi\n\nThis one is for Mira. (Actually, they’re all for Mira.) – Psachya\n\nThese Verses are from the famous Book known as Shir Hashirim. (“Shir Hashirim: Song Of Songs:” - The song that excels all songs dedicated to G-D, Him to Whom peace belongs. - Chapter 6: Verse 3, and Chapter 2: Verse 8 and the end of Verse 14.) It is worthy to note that the “Shir Hashirim,” among the twenty four books of prophecy and sacred spirit, it is one of the most difficult books of Scripture, - not because it is so hard to understand, but because it is so easy to misunderstand.\n\nThe Shir Hashirim is read on the Shabbos of Pesach. (If outside of Israel the last – eighth day of Pesach falls out on Shabbos, then Shir Hashirim is read on that day outside of Israel, and it is only read on the Shabbos of the first day of Pesach, inside of Israel. If the Shabbos during the Pesach holiday falls out on any other day of Pesach, then Shir Hashirim is read on that same Shabbos, both outside of Israel, and inside of Israel.) It is also customary to recite the entire Shir Hashirim on Fridays, Erev Shabbos Kodesh, before Shabbos. In some congregations, Shir Hashirim is recited on Friday afternoon before the “Mincha” Afternoon Prayer Service.\n\nMusic Composed by: Psachya Septimus\n\nLyrics: (“Shir Hashirim: Song Of Songs:” - The song that excels all songs dedicated to G-D, Him to Whom peace belongs. - Chapter 6: Verse 3, and Chapter 2: Verse 8 and the end of Verse 14.)\n\nWords Written by: Shlomo Hamelech (King Solomon)\n\nArranged by: Jeff Horvitz, Creative Audio, Israel\n\nEngineered by: Amit Golan & Eli Yonah – Creative Audio, Israel\n\nProduced by: Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nYaakov (Jay) Radin, Executive Producer\n\nYissi (Stuart) Radin, Producer\n\n© ® 2012, Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nAlone am my Beloved’s\n\nand my Beloved is Mine\n\nHe who grazes me (his sheep)\n\nin roselike bounty (pastures.)\n\n(Chapter 6, Verse 3.)\n\nThe voice of my Beloved!\n\nBehold – it came suddenly\n\nTo redeem me,\n\nAs if leaping over mountains,\n\nSkipping over hills.\n\n(Chapter 2, Verse 8.)\n\nShow me your prayerful gaze,\n\nLet Me hear your supplicating voice,\n\nFor your voice is sweet\n\nAnd your countenance comely.\n\n(Chapter 2, The End Of Verse 14.)\n\n(“Shir Hashirim: Song Of Songs:” - The song that excels all songs dedicated to G-D, Him to Whom peace belongs. - Chapter 6: Verse 3, and Chapter 2: Verse 8 and the end of Verse 14.)\n\n4.) Ad Matai\n\nI don’t remember which terrorist outrage sparked this song. Maybe it was all of them. And it’s also a reaction to the world’s smug self-righteousness. How much longer will Hashem allow this? – Psachya\n\nThese verses are from Psalms, Chapter 94: Verses 1 – 3. This particular chapter is mostly well known from Wednesday’s daily morning prayers. Every day of the week, near the conclusion of the daily morning prayers, we recite verses of the Psalms – taken from which verses the actual Levites would sing and recite on that particular day in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, while it was still standing, may it be speedily rebuilt in our days. On the fourth day of the week of the Shabbat – which we call Wednesday, these verses were the first 3 verses recited as part of that daily chant by the Levites. These verse were chosen to be recited on this day, because on the fourth day of creation, Hashem created the sun, the moon, and the stars, but instead of recognizing them as G-D’s servants, man eventually came to regard the luminaries as independent gods that should be worshipped. Because of this idolatry, Hashem showed himself to be, as this Psalm describes Him, “The G-D Of Vengeance.” – For despite Hashem’s almost endless patience and mercy, Hashem does not tolerate evil forever. Eventually, goodness will prevail and evil will be punished; and Hashem will champion Israel’s cause and deliver Israel from its enemies.\n\n(Psalms: Chapter 94.

Verses 1 – 3.)\n\n5.) Hashem Ori\n\nI wrote this song on September 12, 2001. - Psachya\n\nFrom Rosh Chodesh Elul through Shemini Atzeres (the last day of Yom Tov during the Succos Holiday Season – but before Simchas Torah in Chutz La’Aretz,) this famous Psalm, from Psalms Chapter 27,) is recited. (During that special period this Psalm is recited twice a day. Once, at the conclusion of the daily morning “Shacharis” prayer service. And as for when the second time of the day it is supposed to be recited is the topic of a “Machlokes” a “dispute” as to when it is to be recited. The Askenazik – European Culture custom is to recite it in the evenings at the conclusion of the “Maariv” evening prayer service. And according to the Sefardik – African, Spain and Moroccan cultures custom – is to recite it again at the conclusion of the “Minchah” afternoon prayer service. Either way, this Psalm is recited twice daily during that special period of time.) (At the conclusion of the daily morning “Shacharis” prayer service, during the month of Elul, except for those days of Shabbat, and the day before Rosh Hashanah itself; the Shofar is blown briefly, and then this prayer – Psalms 27, is recited afterwards.)\n\nThe custom to recite this Psalm (Psalms Chapter 27,) during the period of repentance, is based on the Midrash. It expounds: “Hashem is my light,” alluding to Rosh Hashanah. Hashem helps us see the light and repent; “…And my salvation,” – for on Yom Kippur Hashem provides us salvation by forgiving our sins; And once we are forgiven, “He will hide me in His shelter,” meaning the allusion to Succos. Hashem shelters us from all foes and dangers, just as He sheltered our ancestors in the wilderness. Because of the illusion to the preparation for repentance and its aftermath, the custom was adopted to recite this Psalm during the entire repentance period from Rosh Chodesh Elul through Shemini Atzeres.\n\n(Psalms: Chapter 27.

I know that Hashem himself has\n\nProvided this salvation and that it is\n\nHis shelter. – R’ A. Ch. Feuer.)\n\nOn the day of evil,\n\nHe will conceal me in the concealment of His tent,\n\nHe will lift me upon a rock.\n\nNow my head is raised and elevated\n\nAbove my enemies around me,\n\nAnd I will slaughter offerings in His tent,\n\nAccompanied by joyous song;\n\nI will sing and make music\n\nAnd chant praise to Hashem.\n\n(Psalms: Chapter 27. Verses 1 - 6.)\n\n6.) Eretz Tova\n\nI wrote this song many years ago on the beach in Netanya. I was struck by the beauty of Eretz Yisroel, which I was about to leave for a very long time. – Psachya\n\nThese verses (Deuteronomy: Chapter 8. Verses 7 – 8 And Verse 10,) contain the commandment to recite the “Grace After Meals,” which applies whenever one eats a meal with bread and is sated. (Tractate Berachos Page 48b.)\n\nIn this commandment, the Torah Verses lists the seven foods for which the land was praised. (From this we are taught that a different “Abridged Version” of the “Grace After Meals” is recited - when any of these species are eaten as well.)\n\nRashi in Tractate Succah Page 6a explains what “date-honey” is referring to. Rashi explains that when dates are left in the sun, their honey-like juice oozes from them. “Honey” is used to refer not only to bees’ honey, but to every manner of very sweet food, such as dates.\n\nThe Talmud in Tractate Berachos, on Page 20b, states that Rabbi Avira taught that ministering angels asked Hashem how it is proper for Him to show favoritism to the Jewish people. Hashem answered to the ministering angel, “Should I not show them favoritism? I have commanded them to recite the “Grace After Meals” only if they are “SATISFIED,” i.e. “SATED,” but they have chosen to bless Me even if they eat only a piece of bread as small as the volume of an egg or even an olive.”\n\nMusic Composed by: Psachya Septimus\n\nLyrics: (Deuteronomy: Chapter 8.

HINEI LO YANUM\n\nDedicated to my children, for whom I wrote this lullaby. – Psachya\n\nThis lullaby song is partly taken from “The Bedtime Shema,” however, it is actually a quote from Psalms Chapter 121, Verses 4 – 5, and Verses 7 - 8. Rabbi Shamshon Raphael Hirsch explains these verses to mean that since “The Guardian Of Israel,” Hashem, neither slumbers nor sleeps, therefore, one should be able to sleep at night without any fear of harm.\n\nMusic Composed by: Psachya Septimus\n\nLyrics: (Psalms: Chapter 121.

L’Chu Vanim\n\nGood advice. If only more people followed it. - Psachya\n\nEverything in creation has its place. Here we see how Hashem’s greatness can be perceived even in the most painful depths. King David once said to Hashem, “All that You created is beautiful, and wisdom is the most beautiful of all. However, I fail to understand or to appreciate the value of madness. What satisfaction can You derive from having created a lunatic who walks about ripping his clothing, is chased by little children and is mocked by all?” Hashem replied, “David, you will some day need this madness which you now criticize. Furthermore, you will even pray that I give this madness to you.” A short time later, King David was forced to flee for his life from King Shaul. Only among the Philistines, Israel’s sworn enemies, did King David find safety. But even there he was recognized as Israel’s greatest warrior, and once again King David became threatened with death. So, King David pretended to be insane, which King Abimelech became disgusted at King David’s lunatic behavior, and therefore, King Abimelech threw out King David. (See Samuel 1, Chapter 21, Verses 11 – 16.) Instead of feeling despair, King David conquered his despair by composing this beautiful and profound alphabetical hymn found in Psalms 34. The chapter was written by King David in alphabetical form to show that we are to praise Hashem with our every faculty, from “Aleph” to “Tav,” and that we are to acknowledge that whatever Hashem created – from “Aleph” to “Tav” is all always for the good. (This chapter is recited every Shabbat and Yom Tov morning “Shacharis” Davenning between Hodu and Ashrei.)\n\n(Psalms: Chapter 34.

David was the victim of constant slander and his generation suffered defeats in battle because they were not careful in their speech. – YERUSHALMI PEAH 1:1, & R’ A. CH. FEUER.)\n\n(The Baal Shem Tov taught that every person is allotted a given number of words during his lifetime. When he has used up his quota – of words spoken, he dies. Thus, by guarding his tongue, one assures himself of greater longevity.)\n\nAnd your lips from speaking deceit.\n\n(Deceit, slander, false testimony, and cursing.

Verses 12 - 15.)\n\n9.) YAALEH V’YAVO\n\nAn old Klezmer piece written by the legendary Naftule Brandwein. I had a lot of fun with this one. - Incidentally, regarding the title name of the song, \"Ya'aleh V'Yavo,\" (which was composed by Naftule Brandwein,) - no one knows the real reasons for any of Naftule's song titles. The man was basically, very eccentric, - no doubt, a musical genius, but still very very eccentric. (By the way, the real ORIGINAL full title, was \"Der Terkishe Yale-V'Yove Tantz,\" and in “Klez” circles, it's mostly known as Naftule's Terkishe.) I don't think it has anything to do with the actual tefilah. But it sure was a lot of fun playing it, especially since it is recorded LIVE!!!! - Psachya\n\nProducer’s Note: - Psachya has been playing the accordion since before he was born. What better way than to show off his finger’s incredible speed and precision, than by floating across both sides of the accordion at superfast speed playing this little ditty. Besides, Psachya would never let his CD Album be produced without throwing in at least one Klezmer song. “Yaaleh V’yavo” is the perfect piece to make a Klezmer lover out of anyone.\n\nOn a personal production note: This song was recorded LIVE - in one take in its entirety. So this song is as “LIVE” as you can get in a studio. Furthermore, this song was recorded without a “Click-Track” and with nothing more than Psachya nodding his head, or myself waving my arms, to the proposed beat, which changes every few moments. Talk about a “Producer’s nightmare!” But, with the hand of Hashem, we all pulled it off – to perfection. Not to mention the fact, that Psachya was playing an accordion that was not his own. Since we were in Jerusalem, and not in Brooklyn, New York, Psachya had to borrow an accordion. This borrowed accordion was much smaller than the one that Psachya has been used to playing for twenty years, so when we first set out to record this song, I thought that we would never get past the first few bars. Nowadays, Psachya performs this song live on stage, and it sounds exactly as exhilarating on stage, as it does here on the CD. That is because both versions are performed “LIVE” where anything can happen. I have never attempted to produce a live song before, and I must say, that I probably will not attempt to do it ever again! But, after all is said and done, I must tell you, that finally being able to produce such a fantastic and challenging feat has made my career seem more fuller and more accomplished. Not to mention the fact that I now have a few more grey hairs than from before we started recording this song. This song is phenomenal in every sense, and I am sure that now that you know the conditions and the circumstances that this song was recorded with, will make you appreciate it even more. Yet, still, every time that I play this song, I cringe, waiting for the mistake of the drummer, or the percussionist, or the guitar section, but nothing! No errors, no mistakes, just perfection. Perfection on the fly – “LIVE!” Wow! What a production! – Yaakov.\n\nYaaleh V’yavo is the extra paragraph added in every Shemoneh Esrei Amidah and in the Blessing After Meals (Bentching) on every Festival Holiday and on every Rosh Chodesh. Exactly how the words fit the tune is a mystery to me, but maybe if you are lucky, you can get Psachya to actually sing it to you. However, watching him play it, was fascinating enough! Wow! His fingers were really moving! I couldn’t tell if they were coming or going! Maybe that’s why this tune is called “Yaaleh V’yavo!”\n\nOn Festivals and on Rosh Chodesh, we add this “Yaaleh V’yavo” prayer that Hashem should remember us for good and for blessing. The logical place for this prayer is the “Be Favorable” blessing in the Shemoneh Esrei Amidah, which asks for the return of the Temple Service and the Temple itself, where once again Rosh Chodesh and festivals will be marked by special offerings. This call for a remembrance on just these days is based on a verse in Numbers: Chapter 10, Verse 10. – Levush & Orach Chaim – 487.\n\nThis “Yaaleh V’yavo” prayer contains eight words expressing similar general ideas, - that our remembrance rise before Hashem and be favorably received. Rabbi Shamshon Raphael Hirsch offers the following interpretations of the eight expressions: “May our personal behavior and fortune RISE above ordinary human existence; and COME before G-D to merit His interest; may nothing prevent them from REACHINNG G-D and gaining His acceptance; may they be NOTED in the best possible light; may they be WORTHY of G-D’s favor; may G-D HEAR the impact these remembrances have on our lives; may G-D CONSIDER our needs; and may He REMEMBER us and our relationship to Him.”\n\nMusic Composed by: Naftule Brandwein\n\nArranged by: Jeff Horvitz, Creative Audio, Israel, and Psachya Septimus.\n\nEngineered by: Amit Golan & Eli Yonah – Creative Audio, Israel\n\nProduced by: Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nYaakov (Jay) Radin, Executive Producer\n\nYissi (Stuart) Radin, Producer\n\n© ® 2012, Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\n10.) V’erastich\n\nThis was my wedding present to Shalom & Zisi. May your “Erusin” be as strong as the one between Hashem and Klal Yisroel. – Psachya\n\n“I will; betroth you to Me.” Hashem declares that Israel eternally remains His betrothed. This is symbolized by the wrapping of the Tefillin (Phylactery) Strap around one’s fingers in the manner of a groom putting the betrothal ring on his bride’s finger.\n\nThis paragraph is usually recited by men (above the age of 13,) when donning their Tefillin (Phylacteries) in the morning before the morning Shacharis prayers actually begins. It is recited after the “Head – Tefillin” is securely in place, just as one is about to wind the remainder of his “Hand – Tefillin” strap around his middle fingers and then the rest of his hand – each person according to their “Mesorah” (Traditional Custom that is carried down from father to son.) While one winds the Tefillin strap around his middle fingers, symbolizing his wearing the ring of betrothal to Hashem, he recites this paragraph, exclaiming Hashem’s eternal betrothal to us and to every Jew.\n\n(Hoshea: Chapter 2.

May Rachel’s tears (and ours) be dried speedily in our days. – Psachya\n\nIn the Book of “Yirmiyah:” Chapter 31, Verses 14 – 16, we read the very moving passages of our foremother Rachel, weeping for her children. These verses are also read as part of the Haftarah on the Second Day of the Holiday of Rosh Hashanah. These verses are also displayed on the curtain that hangs above the grave of Rachel in Bethlehem at Kever Rachel.\n\nTo fully understand and appreciate the meaning as to why Yirmiyah was telling over in a prophesy that Hashem said that, “…A voice was heard on high – wailing, bitter weeping – Rachel weeps for her children, she refuses to be consoled for her children, for they are gone,” we must first understand the simple interpretation of this verse. The RADAK explains the verse in its simple interpretation to mean, that “Rachel,” here means the entire Ten Tribes, because at the time, their leader was Rachel’s grandson, the tribe of Ephraim. Before the redemption occurs, the tribes represented by Rachel will weep bitterly over their prolonged and painful exile, because – whereas Judah and Benjamin returned to build the Second Temple, – the Ten Tribes remained in exile. Therefore “Rachel” is weeping for her children who suffered bitterly while remaining in exile.\n\nRashi, however cites a Midrash Aggadah which is an enduring source of inspiration for Israel: When King Menasheh of Judah set up an idol in the Temple, G-D made the decision that the Temple would be destroyed and the Jewish people sent into exile. The souls of our Patriarchs and of our Matriarchs pleaded with G-D to rescind His decree, but He rejected their pleas. Then Rachel stepped up and began weeping personally before Hashem. She said, “Surely Your mercy is greater than the mercy of a mortal human being! Nevertheless, look at the mercy that I displayed. Yaakov labored seven full years only for the right to marry me. Still, when my father, Lavan, substituted in marriage, my sister Leah for me – under the Chupah, not only did I remain silent, I even gave over to my sister Leah the passwords that Yaakov and I had devised, just in case this kind of situation were to actually happen. Thus I allowed a rival (my sister, Leah,) to come into my (future) household. You, O G-D should do the same. Although Your children have brought a rival (i.e. King Menasheh’s idol,) into Your Temple, may You be silent.”\n\nHashem then told her, “You have defended them well.” As the next two verses continue, Hashem promised Rachel that the Jewish exile would eventually end and that the entire Jewish people will be returned to their holy land.\n\nMusic Composed by: Psachya Septimus\n\nLyrics: (Book Of Yermiyah: Chapter 31, Verses 14 – 16.)\n\nArranged by: Jeff Horvitz, Creative Audio, Israel\n\nEngineered by: Amit Golan & Eli Yonah – Creative Audio, Israel\n\nProduced by: Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nYaakov (Jay) Radin, Executive Producer\n\nYissi (Stuart) Radin, Producer\n\n© ® 2012, Shirei Achim Productions, Inc.\n\nA voice was heard on high,\n\nWailing, bitter weeping,\n\nRachel weeps for her children;\n\nShe refuses to be consoled for her children,\n\nFor they are gone.\n\n(So said Hashem To Rachel:)\n\nRestrain your voice from weeping\n\nAnd your eyes from tears;\n\nFor there is a reward for your accomplishment\n\nThe words of Hashem.\n\nAnd they shall return from the enemy’s land.\n\n(Out of exile.)\n\nThere is hope for you ultimately\n\nThe words of Hashem\n\nAnd your children shall return to their border.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPSACHYA’S LIVE BAND - THE SHIREI ACHIM BAND:\n\nPsachya Septimus – Piano, Accordian, Keyboards, & Lead Vocalist\n\nNorman Madnick – Bass Guitar - (All Of Them!)\n\nAvi Bernstein – Drums\n\nYaakov (Jay) Radin – Percussions, & Back-Up Vocals\n\nAvi (Jammin’) Jaman – Guitar\n\nAvi Hassan – Guitar, & Flute\n\nYitz Fuchs – Keyboards, & Piano\n\n:-)"
