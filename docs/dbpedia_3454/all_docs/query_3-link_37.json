The show will be streamed and usually there's a 7 day listen-again feature.\n\nVideo: Patti Smith - Because The Night\n\n(live on Later with Jools Holland)\n\n» bbc.co.uk\n\nMorrissey is the undisputed champion of saying something nasty in a soft voice. His new album Years of Refusal suffers from his youngish backing band, who all go \"look, mum, I am playing with Moz and you said that there was no future in music and I should get a real job\". They are too loud and ruin the nuances on the bulk of the tracks. Still, Morrissey puts up a fight and you can hear him despite all the mayhem. But it would have hurt if had slammed the band members heads together and told them a few thing of the art of leaning back.\n\nThey can do it on some tracks - the Spanish flavored When Last I Spoke to Carol, the popyy tune I'm Throwing My Arms Around Paris, and the best track It’s Not Your Birthday Anymore, in which Moz explains that \"there is no need to be kind to you\" and rages about the \"syrupee things that we said\". No, he doesn't get softer as he gets older. And nobody want hims to.\n\nTracks:\n\nSomething Is Squeezing My Skull\n\nMama Lay Softly On The Riverbed\n\nBlack Cloud\n\nI’m Throwing My Arms Around Paris\n\nAll You Need Is Me\n\nWhen Last I Spoke to Carol\n\nThat’s How People Grow Up\n\nOne Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell\n\nIt’s Not Your Birthday Anymore\n\nYou Were Good In Your Time\n\nSorry Doesn’t Help\n\nI’m OK By Myself\n\n» itsmorrisseysworld.com\n\nEscape from MySpace\n\nWant to get out of the hell called MySpace?

Staring Down The Barrel is in touch with the times lyrically, the music is vintage Blockheads courtesy of founding member Chaz Jankel.

He has a relaxed delivery, halfway speaking and singing, and the accent that might remind you of the lamented Ian Dury.\n\nWith Staring Down The Barrel The Blockheads proof that they are not a nostalgia act. They are angry old men now, but they want their audience to dance too, using their trademark inimitable funky ska. The credit crunch looms large, but these men have survived Maggie Thatcher. Try to knock them down and they are back on their feet before you can so much as blink your eyes.\n\nStaring Down The Barrel is released via EMI.

Snubbed by the UK press the band had soldiered on, reaching slowly decreasing audiences after being really big in the late eighties. The Mission first called it quits in 1996 only to be resurrected in 1999, but now it's final. Frontman Wayne Hussey is touring the world as an acoustic solo act, a totally different field compared to the wall-to-wall guitars gothic rock, a genre he co-invented when he was member of the Sisters of Mercy.\n\nLive & Last captures the final night in London, the bonus disc has four tracks form a show in Köln, Germany - a country where they remained popular throughout the years - and a longish interview that finds Wayne Hussey in a relaxed mode, conducting the interview from Brasil where he is a happily married man - although the Janice Long can not resist bringing up the story about a very drunk Hussey who passed out while she tried to tie a ribbon to his dick. Very rock 'n' roll, but only mildly entertaining.\n\nThe music on this album lacks a bit of urgency - the band knows it's all over and they don't seem to care that much. Hussey is doing his best, realising that this the final hurray for being in the spotlights as the frontman he never really wanted to be. He just wants to play guitar and a bit of keyboards now. Mission completed.\n\nThe Mission:\n\nWayne Hussey: vocals, guitar\n\nMark Gemini-Thwaite: lead guitar\n\nRitchie Vernon: bass\n\nSteve Spring: drums\n\nLive & Last is released on Eyes Wide Shut Recordings.

Improvisation rules on all six lengthy tracks, four of them written by Yosi Piamenta, one by Deadric Malone, and a 11st Century piece by Rabbi Abrahma Ibn Ezra (Agadelcha) that is transported with ease a thousand years to wrap up an album that for lack of better world might be filed as \"world music\".\n\nBridging the Gap...

No tickets for tapers.\n\nTrey Anastasio will join Music Director Marin Alsop and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra for orchestrations of classic Phish tunes and the East Coast premiere of his composition Time Turns Elastic at 8p.m. on Thursday, May 21, 2009 at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall. Tickets will be available through a real time pre sale beginning Thursday, February 19th at 5pm (EST) and ending Friday, February 27th at Noon (EST) at treytickets.rlc.net Tickets go on-sale to the public Saturday, February 28th at noon (EST). Audio taping tickets will not be sold for this event.\n\nThe first half of the program features classic Phish songs and solo Trey compositions, while second half of the program features the East Coast premiere of Time Turns Elastic, co-composed by Anastasio and long-time collaborator Don Hart. Time Turns Elastic is a groundbreaking work for vocals, electric guitar and orchestra with long, orchestral passages intertwined with epic guitar lines and vocals in the vein of such classic Anastasio compositions as The Divided Sky, Guyute and Fluffhead. With Anastasio's electric guitar at the forefront, Time Turns Elastic pushes the limits of orchestral music and delivers a complete articulation of the Baltimore Symphony's mission to present new musical collaborations that challenge and inspire audiences. \"Most of the time when people use an electric instrument with an orchestra, they destroy the capability to blend,\" notes Anastasio. \"Our approach is to handle it as any other solo instrument. I play at the volume of say, an oboe, so Don can orchestrate around the guitar.\"\n\n» treyanastasio.com\n\nThree more Mule shows for you.\n\nGov't Mule\n\n2009/02/13\n\nPhilmore Auditorium\n\nDenver, CO, USA\n\n» Grab your torrent\n\nGov't Mule\n\n2009/02/14\n\nDobson Arena\n\nVail, CO, USA\n\n» Grab your torrent\n\nGov't Mule\n\n2009/02/15\n\nThe Belly Up\n\nAspen, CO, USA\n\n» Grab your torrent\n\nTry finding a better finger picking acoustic guitar player than Jorma Kaukonen. You might as well give up and pop his new album River of Time in the player instead. Though most people will associate Kaukonen with the Jefferson Airplane his first love was acoustic blues and country. Some of the songs were regulars in the live shows of Hot Tuna, the band he co-founded with Jack Cassady after the duo had left the Airplane. Been So Long and Operator are revisited and have been giving a downhome acoustic make-over. Kaukonen wrote about half of the songs on the album, the other tracks are favourites from the Americana and country songbook, by luminaries such as Merle Haggard and Mississippi John Hurt.\n\nRiver of Timewas recorded at Levon Helm's studio in Woodstock. The drummer ended up playing on most of the songs of album. Further notable collaborators are mandolin ace Barry Mitterhoff and multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell who also produced.\n\nJorma Kaukonen has been playing for more than fifty years and he still finds new ways to improve his style and tone. With River of Time he proofs once again that age doesn't matter. Musicianship does. Bring on the next album.\n\nRiver Of Time is released on Red House Records.\n\nTracks:\n\nBeen So Long\n\nThere's A Bright Side Somewhere\n\nCracks In The Finish\n\nAnother Man Done A Full Go Round\n\nTrouble In Mind\n\nIzze's Lullaby\n\nMore Than My Old Guitar\n\nNashville Blues\n\nA Walk With Friends\n\nOperator\n\nPreachin' On The Old Camp Ground\n\nRiver Of Time\n\nSimpler Than I Thought\n\nWant to play like Jorma?

Founded in 2002 by Matthew Tow the band became good friends with USA band the Brian Jonestown Massacre, who they supported in 2003 on their first North American tour.\n\nDimensions is their fourth full-length, and it sounds like a ocean gently kissing the beach. With a mellotron taking care of most of the string parts there's a definite late sixties vibe to this album, but thankfully the band have sidestepped candy-colored lyricism. The band employed the services of a handful guest musicians with Robert Campanella (Mellotron) and Gabriel Cohen (flute) featuring as the most prominent players. Dimensions is a sonic gem that can serve as a blueprint for aspiring melodic bands without putting the fear of the musicals gods into them.\n\nThe Lovetones:\n\nMatthew Tow: vocals, guitars\n\nMatthew Sigley: bass, keys, vocals\n\nSerge Luca: guitars\n\nChris Cobb: drums & percussion\n\nDimensions is released in the USA on Planting Seeds Records.

The trio from Harrisonburg, VA, consists of the couple Ben and Melanie Schlabach, who share vocal duties, and Nick Combs as the one man rhythm section.\n\nPostcards and Letters is a concept album of sorts - the lyrics of the songs ar printed on the back of 10 full-colour postcards that come with the album, showing photos shot in the Baltic States, Poland and the USA. The croaky lead vocals of Mr. Schlabach are mellowed down a bit by the professional trained pipes of Mrs. Schlabach. It's never smooth but it fits with the sparse instrumentation. This is a homemade album in every sense of the word. The first run of the CD is limited to 100 copies, making it an instant collectors item for Americanaphiles.

North Elementary from Chapel Hill, NC, has one constant: songwriter John Harrison. When he started putting assembling the songs for Not for Everyone, Just for You with producer Alan Weatherhead in 2006 and 2007 at Weatherhead's Richmond, VA studio the project got sidetracked and was shelved for a little over two years. Harrison moved on, releasing another album under the North Elementary banner before returning to the songs.\n\nWas it worth the wait? Yes, it was. Choosing his words and music with care Harrison can conjure up musical landscapes, where a host of characters wander about, meet and drift apart again. Think Jesus and The Mary Chain captured in an acoustic environment (Decade Stylin') and the poppier side of Bob Mould's Sugar (You Have A Heart) . Producer Weatherhead rides shotgun on pedal steel and with three different guitar players in this incarnation of the band there are plenty of layers to unravel.
