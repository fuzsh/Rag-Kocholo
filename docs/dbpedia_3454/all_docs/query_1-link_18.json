        "text": "Jewish teen-agers with yarmulkes stuck firmly to their heads were diving off the stage in the Ali Baba room at the Aladdin Hotel, their fringes flying and their fists raised in joy.\n\n''Awesome!'' shouted one, falling into the melee of dancers below.\n\nOnstage, Yosi Piamenta and the Mizrahi Rockers were ripping through what they billed as their first ''all-night rave,'' a marathon self-promoted concert for which they charged $12 a head. It drove hundreds of their fans into a frenzy of whooping, stomping, Jewish rock-and-roll ecstasy that lasted until 5 A.M.\n\nOutsiders -- and plenty of older-generation insiders -- might well be puzzled at the partying in the heart of this Orthodox Jewish community in the Catskill Mountains. But for those familiar with Mr. Piamenta's heavy metal Hebrew jams, the music is a natural outgrowth of their religious exuberance.\n\n''My father's a rabbi in Denver, and he's cool with this,'' said Basi Twerski, 25, an elementary-school teacher in Brooklyn. ''Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but most of the people here probably listen to rock radio and everything. This is just a way to do it that's kosher.''\n\nMr. Piamenta, an Israeli-born rock guitarist who became a Hasid, shrugged at the notion of a conflict between an all-night rave and his Orthodox faith, which prohibits women from joining their boyfriends on the dance floor or even from moving to the music by themselves.\n\nThis was, he said, not a rave in the typical drug-induced, dance-party sense. There were no blinding strobe lights or bumping and grinding couples.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
