        "text": "His story is truly something out a movie: He has spent the last six months fighting alongside the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) against ISIS in Syria. He has tagged every house he has liberated with the Hasidic saying Na Nach Nachman, in order to – as he calls it – \"Bring some light into the darkness.\"\n\nIn one of his more popular posts on social media, he posted a picture of a building he and his comrades had liberated, saying: \"ISIS turned this school, 50 km from their capital in Raqqa, into a prison. I was part of horrible fighting in the area, my friends and I fended ISIS off when they tried to recapture the prison from the next village.\"\n\nThe post continued, \"ISIS left women's clothes and underwear on the floors of the cells, a lot of it, evidence of unholy crimes. I wrote Rabbi Nachman's name here to bring some light in to this black sink hole of torture, rape, murder and savage war. Amen.\"\n\nBut Jacobs-Wordsworth's story did not start in Syria. The 37-year-old is a British citizen, and the grandson of a holocaust survivor who made it out of Dachau after losing his mother in Auschwitz, and his father at Theresienstadt. \"My grandfather converted to Christianity, and I grew up as a Christian,\" he says.\n\nAlthough his grandfather passed at the age of 96, Jacobs says he \"always knew he was from a Jewish family, and heard stories about my holocaust survivor grandfather. My mom is a Zionist, and she taught me to love Israel and hate cruelty. She always told me the due to the suffering incurred by the Jews and my family during the Holocaust, made me feel physically ill.\"\n\nJacobs Wordsworth did two central things with the education he received growing up: He joined the British army in order to fight against evil, and travelled to Israel with the goal of live here.\n\n\"I wanted to help the people of Bosnia, whom I saw as undergoing another sort of holocaust and genocide,\" he says. \"That's why I joined the British army in 1996, and served several years in the British forces under NATO in Bosnia and Kosovo.\"\n\n10 years ago he made his dream a reality and visited Israel, believing he could become an Israeli citizen without too much fuss, however things didn't work out like he planned: \"I asked for Israeli citizenship, but I was deported from Israel in 2005 because my visa had expired,\" he says. \"Because I grew up as a Christian in a Christian family, I couldn't make aliyah through the law of return, although with god's blessing I will be able to return to Israel this year, because my 10 year entrance ban expires soon.\"\n\nDuring his stay in Israel, he was exposed to Breslov Hasidism – and immediately fell in love. \"I saw Nachman Hassids dancing in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but it was an Orthodox friend in London who convinced me to travel with him to Uman. It was during Rosh Hashana in 2012, and since then I have been to Uman three times.\"\n\nIn the meantime he got married, and joined the Kurdish forces battling against ISIS in Syria. \"I got to them through a Facebook page called the 'Lions of Rojava,' which helps smuggle international volunteers into Syria, most of whom are former soldiers from the Kurdish forces in northern Iraq,\" he says.\n\n\"I fought in Syria for six months, and I wrote Rabbi Nachman's name in a bunch of places where we beat ISIS,\" he added. \"I have met Jewish soldiers with strong Jewish roots from around the world among us here.\"\n\nJacobs-Wordsworth tends to close every sentence with \"Am Israel Chai,\" and Rabbi Nachman from Uman stars in many of his Facebook posts. But he does admit that his beliefs are somewhat complex: \"I believe that there were two messiahs, as it is written in the Talmud: The messiah Ben Yossef, and the messiah Ben David. I believe that Ben Yossef was already here, and his name was Jesus. I believe that the messiah Ben David will come soon.\n\n\"I plan on filling a request to make Aliyah again,\" Jacobs-Wordsworth says, and adds that he has undergone a Reform Judaism conversion in London a few years ago. \"I am a member of the North Western Reform Synagogue in London,\" he said.\n\nIn November of last year, Gill Rosenberg , who made aliyah from Canada in 2006, made her way to fight with the YPG in Syria. She returned safely to Israel earlier this year, but it was reported that she was in Iraq this week.\n\nIn recent years, several memoirs have been written by those who have left haredi Orthodox Judaism. Books by Shulem Deen (\"All Who Go Do Not Return\"), Deborah Feldman (\"Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots\") and Leah Vincent (\"Cut Me Loose: Sin and Salvation After My Ultra-Orthodox Girlhood\") all have had mainstream publishing success.\n\nInterest in the ex-frum memoir continues, as demonstrated by the release of three new titles. Leah Lax's \"Uncovered: How I Left Hasidic Life and Finally Came Home\" (She Writes Press), Judy Brown's \"This Is Not a Love Story\" (Little, Brown) and Chaya Dietsch's forthcoming \"Here and There: Leaving Hasidism and Keeping My Family\" (Schocken) are introspective tales of survival and, ultimately, triumph.\n\nCollectively, these books could be described as \"off the derech\" literature. In Hebrew, \"derech\" means \"path\"; the phrase \"off the derech,\" or OTD — once a derogatory term used to describe Orthodox youth who experimented with secularism — has been reclaimed recently by some ex-acolytes who have forged their own path in the world.\n\nThe OTD experience is undergoing intense scrutiny since the suicide of Faigy Mayer, an ex-Hassid who jumped 20 stories to her death in Manhattan last month. Mayer left the Belz Hassidim when she was 23 and had been on her own for five years. Media reports speculated that she was mentally ill, estranged from her family and struggling to survive in the secular world.\n\nFor some, Mayer's death may appear to be a cautionary tale about those seeking to leave their haredi Orthodox sects. For others, the media spotlight may have generated intrigue about these secretive communities. Whatever the perspective, the new OTD memoirs provide a compassionate and compelling way to understand the tragedy beyond the headlines.\n\n\"Uncovered\" captures the irony and pain of how prescriptive yet predictably comfortable a haredi life can be. Lax offers a front-row seat to the joys, perils and overall hardship of Hassidic life, where running a large, busy household and undertaking the scrupulous observance of labor-intensive holidays always fall to the mother.\n\nBut as the subtitle implies, her story is distinct from the pack of recent OTD memoirs. Lax grew up secular in Houston in the 1960s and '70s, discovering Lubavitch Hassidism when she was 15. The Hassidic life presented an attractive alternative to her chaotic household in which her mother was a hoarder and her father was mentally ill.\n\nHowever, the religious life was one in which she was forced to suppress her sexuality. \"My greatest secret for over 30 years was being a lesbian,\" Lax said in an interview.\n\nLax entered an arranged marriage when she was just 19. In the book, she captures the complexity of her relationship with her husband, Levi, as well as the intense friendships she formed with other women around motherhood, observance and the mikvah.\n\nOver the years, Lax recognized and eventually accepted her burgeoning lesbian identity through rituals associated with the ancient ritual bath.\n\n\"I slip my head under again, again to raise my feet to sink beneath the surface,\" she writes in her memoir. \"I die here. I become a single drop in the greater pool of women, of history, of God. Under water, I am surrounded by floating female figures from my people's past, praying, drifting, hoping. I am at the vortex of a vast funnel; I see I'm not alone.\"\n\nIn the interview, she said, \"I accepted my physical self in the mikvah. It was a place where all of me was not hidden.\"\n\nHiding is one of the book's strong through-lines. As a married woman, Lax hid herself in modest clothing and headscarves. Only in the deepest night — while her husband and seven children slept — did she gradually dare to reveal herself by recording her life in journals and fictionalizing it in stories.\n\nHer writing life became public when she entered a master's degree program in creative writing at the University of Houston. During that pivotal change, she \"uncovered\" again and again as she removed her head covering and changed into jeans in her car just before attending class.\n\nLax and her husband inevitably divorced. She has been with her partner, Susan, for a decade, and the couple married in April. Susan converted to Judaism before she met Lax; they now belong to the Reform synagogue where Susan began her Jewish journey.\n\n\"There's so much community there,\" said Lax, who remains close to all her children, four of whom also left Hassidim.\n\nThe complicated, sometimes ferocious role of community in Hassidic life is something Brown explores in \"This Is Not a Love Story.\" The book — her second following the much-acclaimed young adult novel \"Hush,\" which tackled sexual abuse in the haredi community — chronicles growing up with her autistic older brother, Nachum.\n\nBrown and her family were often ostracized in their Brooklyn community because of Nachum's unpredictable behavior.\n\n\"Having an autistic brother was very isolating in the [Hassidic] community,\" Brown said. \"Autism was not part of the communal conversation.\"\n\nAdding to the feeling of otherness, Brown's parents fell in love outside the structure of an arranged marriage. Their lack of a proper shidduch, or matchmaking, spurred gossip that the family was cursed.\n\n\"The rumor that my parents fell in love became intertwined with the fact that I was the only one who had this [autistic] brother,\" Brown said. \"But I think my parents' love helped them get through the situation without falling apart.\"\n\nTo share her story, Brown, 35, brilliantly conveys the magical thinking that distinguishes a child's inner voice. Amid the family's crisis with her brother, Brown promised God to fast for 40 days and 40 nights in return for heart-shaped earrings.\n\n\"I figured if the saints could get Hashem to listen when they asked for rain after a long drought, or for an end to a terrible plague, it would certainly work for me,\" she writes. \"Earrings were a simple miracle.\"\n\nLike Lax, Brown's writing aspirations began slowly and methodically. As one of the few women in her Hassidic community to attend college, Brown notes that she didn't grow up reading English literary classics.\n\n\"I found myself in a void, lacking basic words because growing up I spoke Yiddish, Hebrew and English,\" she said. \"My college professors thought I was an immigrant. Reading books by Mark Twain, Elie Wiesel and Toni Morrison was a huge milestone in my life.\"\n\nDespite her educational evolution, Brown, who considers herself Modern Orthodox, is quick to point out that her story is not about leaving observant Judaism.\n\n\"People make certain assumptions about the Hassidic lifestyle, and that's not really my story,\" she said. \"My story is not about leaving. It is about the larger issue of embracing my brother.\"\n\nTo that end, Brown points out that her former community has made a \"U-turn\" in many ways.\n\n\"There are now resources, and [special needs] children are fully embraced as special with higher souls,\" she said.\n\nAnd yet, acceptance may be slower in coming for those, like Faigy Mayer, who have stepped off the path of haredi Orthodoxy.\n\n\"For Hassidim, group identity is core,\" Lax said. \"When they leave the fold, finding themselves without community is sudden and shocking. At first you don't know who you are. Writing helped me in a lot of ways.\""
