There has been slow and steady progress in his condition, and noticeable improvement in his breathing and awareness. However, the condition is still very serious - he recently developed a high fever.\n\nOur tefillos [prayers] are still needed urgently. Please continue to daven [pray] for his full and speedy refua shleima [recovery]. Please daven for Rebbe Yisrael Dan ben Rivka Zlata\n\nישראל דן בן רבקה זלאטא\n\nalong with all other Jews who are in poor health, and may each one merit a speedy and complete recovery.\n\n2. The Hirhurim piece on \"Yankel Radio\" is up to 30 comments, including another one from yours truly.\n\n3. Thanks again to Blog in Dm and Hirhurim, I found this link page for Niggunim, including those of Bobov, Breslov, Chabad and Modzitz. Especially interesting is the link for Chabad online streaming radio. Try it, you might find it better than JM in the AM or Five Towns Radio!\n\n[Note: I do not necessarily endorse the rest of the website that has the links...]\n\nThursday, November 17, 2005\n\nSHLOMO'S SONG - A GUEST POST\n\nThe following is from Daniel Nakonechny, a friend and fellow devotee of Reb Shlomo Carlebach. He was gracious enough to allow me to post this on my blog in honor of Reb Shlomo’s yahrzeit, which is beginning right now.\n\nOne word of clarification: Some of us refer to Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach as Reb Shlomo, others as Shlomo. In speaking about him, I use them interchangeably, depending also on whom I’m speaking with. However, when writing of him, especially before an unknown audience, I try to give him the respect by calling him Reb Shlomo.\n\nDaniel refers to him as Shlomo, with the following reasoning:\n\nFrom the very beginning I was never comfortable with 'Reb Shlomo'. It was too artificial. In his own eyes he was 'Shlomo' and only 'Shlomo', and that is how he was known to the world. In my later writings, I very quickly switched to 'Shlomo', and that is how I refer to him to this day…Understand, of course, that many are those who are greater than Shlomo, and no one dreams of calling them Rav or Rebbe or HaGaon, etc. We all throw around Moshe and Aaron, David and Shlomo, Hillel and Shamai, Rava and Abayei, and etc. without the slightest sense of disrespect or diminishing of their stature. That's who they are and how they were known to the world. And so, too, is it with Shlomo.\n\nI fully accept his reasoning.\n\nFinally, before getting to the actual post, I want to share some of Daniel’s blessings to me:\n\nMusic is such a blessing. In the face of all the difficulties here [in Eretz Yisrael], it often requires almost superhuman effort to lift people's spirits. Words just don't do it. That is why music is so important. It just goes in. It penetrates as if there were no barriers at all. The purer the music the deeper it goes. This is why [Shlomo], of sacred and blessed memory, and his music … [is] so needed. [It] touches the most neglected and forgotten places in the most gentle and loving way. [It] open[s] people's hearts and give[s] them back life and themselves.\n\nWhat a precious gift to bring out the beauty and sweetness and cause them simply to glow. It is the deepest of blessings and today the deepest of needs…I bless you, Yitzchak, that you should continue to open hearts. The sweetness of music restores so many who have wandered so far from who and what they really and truly are.\n\nB'Shalom, Daniel - 15 Ram Cheshvan 5766\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\n\"Shlomo's Song\"\n\nwritten to and for all of us whom Shlomo's light and love continue to touch\n\nby Daniel Nakonechny, Beit El, Israel\n\ndnako@actcom.net.il\n\nIn a sense Rebbes are simply messengers, albeit Holy messengers. Each and every one of them is only bringing us G-d's message, G-d's eternal love call - come back, come home, return to me. From the immortal moment that the Torah came into the world that is the message that the Torah has been calling to us - return. Each Rebbe in his own unique fashion gives us the means to hear G-d's Holy message. Each Rebbe grapples with his share of Divine Light and struggles with how to get it to and share it with as many of us as possible. While each understands that he is blessed to be a conduit, above everything else each accepts upon himself the awesome responsibility of making sure that the G-d's Holy message gets distributed as far and wide as possible.\n\nShlomo's uniqueness, like every other Rebbe's, is that of timing. He came into the world exactly at the moment when he was most needed. Unlike the other great Rebbes, Shlomo had the great blessing of learning and living Torah both before and after we returned to our homeland, Eretz Israel, and the great merit of teaching our generation. We, the generation of return - to ourselves, to our faith, and to our homeland - are influenced by Rav Kook who sees the lights of our returning as the light for the rebuilding of Jews, Judaism, and Israel. He teaches that everything - inside and out - is G-dly, that we must return everything to its G-dliness, and that we must do it now. That G-dliness, our Holiness, is our reason for existence - Rebbes and Hasidim and world alike. That search for and return of everything to G-dliness is Shlomo. As a Rebbe he was blessed with both the insight to see our true Holiness and the ability to make us see it as well.\n\nWhat Shlomo had in common with all the great Rebbes was the uncanny ability of making G-d personal to each and every person. He literally opened up our hearts and souls to that special dwelling place where G-d's Holiness resides. He showed each of us how we are uniquely connected to G-d and he welcomed each of us into G-d's Divine and Magnificent Kingdom. For some of us he opened up the Holy scholar that is inside, for others he opened up the Holy musician, for others the Holy teacher, and for others the Holy listener and friend. Whatever kind of Holiness we possess Shlomo brought it to life. When Shlomo reached out and taught us and cherished us he was giving us G-d's Holy message. Like every great teacher of Torah and every great Rebbe, he fervently hoped that we, too, would reach out and teach and cherish and give G-d's Holy message.\n\nShlomo gave so much, brought into the world so much, and shared so much. He left us with things that had we not crossed his path almost assuredly we would never have received them. Of all his teachings what Shlomo most bequeathed us was to hear song - to want to hear song - to ache to hear song - to know that song is in everything. He taught us to listen to the song of the broken heart and the falling tears, the song of the setting sun and the rising moon, the song of the children and parents, the song of Jews and Jerusalem, the song of husband and wife, the song of Israel and the Holy Temple, the song of brothers and sisters, the song of love and G-d, the song of You and Me, the song of Shabbat and Yom Tov, the song of G-d and Torah, the song of Creator and Creation. He taught us his songs and the music he sang is his Torah, the Torah that he used to connect us to the Holiest Song of all - the Song of the Holiness of Being and Oneness.\n\nShlomo was so connected that he was capable of connecting us, also. For many he was the most connected person any of us ever met. Perhaps what we miss the most about him is just how much he so connected everything and everyone. Perhaps what we search the most for, what we long and ache the most for is the kind of connection that Shlomo had and gave us. Perhaps, just perhaps, one of our most fervent prayers and wishes is that somehow some way we can grasp a little bit of him and become connected ourselves. Let it be a story, Torah, or song. Let it be a blessing, kind word or other mitzvah - whatever, just as long as it lets us be connected. Let it be that I am imitating what I think Shlomo would do, it really doesn't matter. I only want to be connected.\n\nIt's Gevald! There are people who didn't know Shlomo, who never met him, and who never even heard him perform, yet they are all thirsting for his help to make the connection. Where does it come from?! There aren't that many books about Shlomo, or that many books of his teachings, and he didn't leave a yeshiva or other formal organization. The answer is that he left two things that would let him come to Jews who couldn't come to him. He left as many sweet and Holy Yidden as he could possibly find and connect and he left his music. And he left each for the other. Where one couldn't get to or reach the other one would, and when one started stumbling the other would pick him up - the song the Jew and the Jew the song.\n\nMore than anything Shlomo wants us to hear the song and to know that the song of Shlomo is G-d's Holy song and that G-d's Holy song is the Torah. More than it was given at Sinai we, the Holy Jewish people, brought it into the world because we want the world to have G-d's love. We want the world to have it and we want it for G-d's sake. G-d's Torah is a Holy love song, one song of eternal longing for eternal connection one song of G-d and the Jewish people one song of eternal love of eternal lovers. Shlomo sang G-d's love song and he taught us to hear it and sing it. With the help of our Holy Rebbe we are continually bringing G-d's Holy song into the world and once a year we return to sit at G-d's feet and listen as the Master of the Universe sings His Holy song again.\n\nwritten in Beit El on Rosh Chodesh Sivan 5761\n\nUPDATES AND BLOGWATCH\n\n1.

The Carlebach Shul, as well as other venues, will be used for the davening, meals and special events. This year’s theme, ‘The Power of Music’ is something that is close to the hearts of those on the Carlebach derech. We know Reb Shlomo inspired many with his heavenly niggunim. These niggunim opened up gates in the powerful places in one’s soul to experience emotions that called forth yearning, sadness, and hope. Reb Shlomo's music is not just about the music; like him it is larger than life, calling out for us to be better, to dream, and to love.\n\nMusic has power. It is often misunderstood, often abused and has often become a handmaiden to a culture of drugs, and even violence. Because music is not just a soul, it is also a garment, an instrument that can be directed for the good and for the bad of humanity. We want to bring peace to our land and the sense of the spiritual to our youth. Reb Shlomo’s music is that portal. Join the leading teachers, musicians, Rabbis, Rebbitzens and Chevra in helping to create this reality.\"\n\nAmong the many stars featured [and some \"topics\" in brackets] are Rabbi Naftali Citron, Rabbi Avi Weiss, Ben Zion Solomon [\"How to Lead a Carlebach Minyan\"] and Sons, the Moshav Band, Hasidic New Wave with Yakar Rhythms, Yehuda Green, Yitzchak Buxbaum, Rabbi Avraham Arieh [\"Finding Your Own Song\"] and Rebbetzin Rachel Trugman, David Zeller, Rabbi Dr. Nechemia Polen [\"Music and Melody in the Chassidic path of the Piaseczno Rebbe\"], Mindy Ribner, Noach Solomon Chase [\"Anatomy of a Niggun\"], Rabbi Avraham Sutton, and Rabbi Yehoshua Eliovson [\"Applied Shlomo - Distilling his Pioneering Methods for New Programs\"].\n\nTEANECK, NJ\n\nOn December 3, 2005 the largest ever mega-concert of Carlebach music, The 11th Annual Carlebach Yahrzeit Concert, will be held in Teaneck. This year, as part of the inauguration of the new Carlebach Congregation of Teaneck, the Carlebach Shul in Manhattan has joined the Teaneck Congregation to bring this one and only official concert to Teaneck.

We have the feeling that it is the first time that Reb Shlomo's friends and \"followers\" are coming here since the last time he was here at 1989. The Jewish communities here never learned Torah the way Reb Shlomo was teaching it. So even though we don't really know how to do it so well, it appears to be a great chiddush [innovation] here. Last Shabbos we had a Shabbaton outside of Moscow, and we got very good responses. Next Shabbaton is [Parshat] Chayei Sarah. --Yacov and Miral'e Drori.\n\nThursday, November 10, 2005\n\nTuesday, November 08, 2005\n\nSunday, November 06, 2005\n\nFriday, November 04, 2005\n\nTuesday, November 01, 2005"
