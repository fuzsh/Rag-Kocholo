        "text": "ANDY Summers is just one of 16 guitarists slated to strum at the New York Guitar Festival’s All-Star Guitar Marathon tomorrow.But don’t expect the Police man to break out “Roxanne” – Summers will be appearing with his jazz trio.\n\nAlthough rock will be represented at the fret-full event at the 92nd Street Y’s Kaufman Concert Hall, many of the international musicians will be showing another side of guitar music – a blend of folk, classical, jazz and world music.\n\nSome don’t even play your ordinary six-string.\n\nMin Xiao Fen plays a pipa, a Chinese four-stringed lute-like instrument; Palestinian-born Simon Shaheen plays the oud, a Middle Eastern precursor to the lute; and Keba “Bobo” Cissoka, from West Africa, plays a kora, a 21-string harp/lute made of out a cowhide-covered gourd.\n\nThe marathon is an offshoot of the New York Guitar Festival. Its third season, originally scheduled for the week after the World Trade Center attack, was postponed until next fall.\n\nCo-producer David Spelman, who owns a p.r. agency and is also a musician, founded the festival to help raise funds to teach children to play guitar.\n\nTomorrow’s marathon will also feature performances by jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli; Bill Frisell, who blends jazz with everything from rock to bluegrass and blues; and Brazilian brothers Sergio and Odair Assad.\n\nPerformer Alex de Grassi calls the marathon “a wonderful idea.”\n\n“People seem to have a hard time when there’s only one of you out there classifying what you do musically,” says De Grassi, a steel-string acoustic player who will interpret pieces by Thelonious Monk, Jimi Hendrix and George Gershwin.\n\n“The most amazing thing is that you’ll have heard music from different continents; from artists playing jazz, avant-garde, standards -all these different things that on paper shouldn’t work together,” says emcee and co-producer John Schaeffer, who also hosts WNYC’s “New Sounds.”\n\nConcerts leading up to the marathon have been held all week at the Y’s Makor/Steinhardt Center.\n\nTonight’s features the “Hasidic Hendrix” Yosi Piamenta, who plays sacred blues-driven rock ‘n’ roll.\n\n“The point here was to surprise people,” Schaeffer says, “and give them an idea of what the guitar can do.”\n\nThe All-Star Guitar Marathon will be held tomorrow, from noon to 10 p.m., at the 92nd Street Y Kaufman Concert Hall (92nd Street and Lexington Avenue). Tickets are $40 and $60.\n\nThe 92nd Street Y Makor/Steinhardt Center, is at 35 W. 67th St. Tickets for tonight’s show are $15. Call (212) 415-5500.\n\nString yourself along\n\nWHETHER you want to be Slash or a classical virtuoso, it’s easy to get started on the six-string.Books like “Guitar for Dummies” and “Rock Guitar for Dummies” can guide you. So can CD-ROMs, such as the “eMedia Guitar Method.”\n\nBut it’s more fun to learn your chords from a real guitarist.\n\nConsider the New School (www.nsu.newschool.edu), which offers group lessons ($400 for 12 lessons) in rock/blues, jazz, bass or contemporary acoustic guitar.\n\nAfter the first semester, go for private lessons. They usually cost $35 to $60 an hour.\n\nFinding the right guitar teacher is like finding a good shrink – you need the right chemistry. Ask everybody you know for recommendations, including local rockers when they’re hanging out at the bar after a set.\n\nThen decide what your needs are. Want to play acoustic or electric? Write your own music or just play covers?\n\nIf you have no idea, discuss it with the teacher. Then take a lesson. You’ll know right away if you’re in sync."
