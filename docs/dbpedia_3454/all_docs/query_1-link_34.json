For the surname Example you type in\n\nhttps://sortedbyname.com/letter_e/example.html\n\nYou must change the directory /letter_e if the surname you seek starts with a different letter. You figured that out, right? Use lower case, no spaces, hyphens, apostrophes or other stuff.\n\nRemember, names are sorted the correct way: by surnames, then given names, not by word. La Forest is sorted as Laforest and Rose Mary is sorted as Rosemary. This also means Josephine is between Joseph I and Joseph J.\n\nPregnant? Need help? Call Birthright 24/7\n\n1-800-550-4900\n\nWe encourage you to open a free account at FamilySearch.org, where you can connect lines with other researchers and add your tree, and sources. It is owned and operated by the Mormon Church. Also check out Cyndis List for tons of genealogy websites.\n\nAs the song goes, too many broken hearts have fallen in the river. Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea. Maybe you can help persuade Facebook to do something.\n\nThis page was generated Wednesday 31 July 2024 20:56:25 UTC"
