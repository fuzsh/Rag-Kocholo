        "text": "On Tuesday of Chol Hamoed, October 14th, 400 young adults gathered at the upstairs of Chovevei Torah for the Shloshim of Kasriel Benjamin OBM, or ‘Kazi,’ as he was affectionately known by his friends.\n\nThe evening was called ‘Unite for Kazi: A Tribute Concert’ – an event, the organizers explain, that combined two of Kazi’s greatest passions: music and bringing people together.\n\nFamily, friends and local musical artists turned out to share their favorite memories of Kazi, and enjoy musical performances by Issac Bitton, Aaron Einhorn, Avinoam, Shmuely Liberman, Yoni Lorber, Avi & Yuda Meer, Yehuda Piamenta, Yossi Blunts, Shaya Lieberman, Shlomo Recu, S Sebaoun, Moshe Okunov, Menachem Reich, YMBee, Yehuda Rosenberger, Moshe Hecht, Yellow Red Sky, Shevach Tamir, Moshe Katzen, Beryl Teitelbaum, Shmully Lowenstein, Getzy Edelman, Yechezkel Denebeim and Yitzy Bruck.\n\nKazi, a talented writer, (a contributor to the Algemeiner), and gifted musician is most known for his intrinsic kindness – he was a great friend who always knew just the right thing to say.\n\n“His humor and smile was so telling of the person he was,” said one friend, “A kind sweet soul that never judged or got angry. Kazi took the initiative to always make one feel worth something by giving anything he had, that’s the type of person he was.”\n\nKazi’s father, echoed the sentiment: “It’s amazing to see just how many friends Kazi has, how many lives he touched, how loved he was. We have friends that drove in from Florida, who flew in from California. This night is exactly what Kazi would have wanted.”\n\n“With all these feelings of grief and disbelief, we wanted to do something positive that celebrates his life and the good that he’s done.” explained Menachem Reich, event organizer and a friend of Kazi. “You could always rely on Kazi for a good hug and a smile.”\n\nFunds raised at the event will go towards the writing of a Sefer Torah in Kazi’s memory. Going forward, the group aims to build a Young Adult community and support network. It will include a music lounge, Friday night meals and events centered on art and music.\n\n“The turnout was amazing,” Avinoam Mizrachi, a close friend of Kazi and event organizer, said. “A lot of people who came got to meet Kazi for the first time tonight, people who didn’t even know him. He’s still with us, you can feel him with us.”\n\nVIDEO:\n\nIf you would like more information on how to be a part of this or to make a donation to the cause, contact Menachem at 917-291-2312."
