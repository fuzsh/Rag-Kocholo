If you do not like this, you'll probably want?to trade elsewhere; maybe we can make alternative arrangements.? I?currently have a stash of TY Fujis, and use those for trades.? Personally, I don't have a huge problem with most brand name discs.? Just let me know what you're using so we're fair to each other.?\n\nI use EAC to extract, and NERO to burn.? I have a proper combined read/write offset for shows I extract from disc.? Because I have a combined read/write offset, and I also download shows via broadband, I cannot guarantee that all shows I trade have proper offsets. For that matter, I do not know whether everyone I've traded with has properly configured offsets."
