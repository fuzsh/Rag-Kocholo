My mother also loved music, so much so that the first piece of furniture she bought for our house in Tel Aviv was a piano. And my older brother, Yosi, was a guitar player who, in the course of his career, created a whole new style – a blend of rock and Israeli compositions, which had a major influence on Jewish music.\n\nI grew up playing piano but, after a time, I discovered the magical sound of the flute and that became my instrument of choice. At age seventeen, I started performing with Yosi, who was then a soldier and playing in an IDF band. I vividly remember joining him for a concert just when the Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973. We performed for the soldiers on the front lines with bombs flying over continue\n\nParshah Vayishlach\n\nBe Happier than a Billionaire\n\nBy Stacey Goldman\n\n“Why do you have such a big house with so few children?”\n\nWhenever I feel deprived, unsatisfied with what I own, I remind myself of this question. A young Israeli girl was visiting America with her mother. When she saw my friend’s tiny (by American standards) duplex with four (quite a brood in America) young children running about, she was so confused! How could such a huge house (by Israeli standards) be the shelter for this tiny (again, by Israeli standards) family? Imagine feeling perplexed at the notion of taking up more space than one needs.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, my husband works in the world of high finance, where some of the most fortunate people have made millions, and occasionally, even billions. Unfortunately, they rarely gain satisfaction through their wealth. The millionaires complain of the expense of owning a second home. A man with tens of millions, the owner of several homes around the world and a private jet, related wistfully of a colleague who built his own landing strip to more efficiently reach his island home. This man, in turn, lamented his continue\n\nParshah in a nutshell\n\nGenesis 32:4 - 36:43\n\nJacob returns to the Holy Land after a 20-year stay in Charan, and sends angel-emissaries to Esau in hope of a reconciliation, but his messengers report that his brother is on the warpath with 400 armed men. Jacob prepares for war, prays, and sends Esau a large gift (consisting of hundreds of heads of livestock) to appease him.\n\nThat night, Jacob ferries his family and possessions across the Jabbok River; he, however, remains behind and encounters the angel that embodies the spirit of Esau, with whom he wrestles until daybreak. Jacob suffers a dislocated hip but vanquishes the supernal creature, who bestows on him the name Israel, which means “he who prevails over the divine.”\n\nJacob and Esau meet, embrace and kiss, but part ways. Jacob purchases a plot of land near Shechem, whose crown prince—also called Shechem— abducts and rapes Jacob’s daughter Dinah. Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi avenge the deed by killing all male inhabitants of the city , after rendering them vulnerable by convincing them to circumcise themselves.\n\nJacob journeys on. Rachel dies while giving birth to her second son, Benjamin, and is buried in a roadside grave near Bethlehem. Reuben loses the birthright because he interferes with his father’s marital life. Jacob arrives in Hebron, to his father Isaac, who later dies at age 180. (Rebecca has passed away before Jacob’s arrival.)\n\nOur Parshah concludes with a detailed account of Esau’s wives, children and grandchildren; the family histories of the people of Seir, among whom Esau settled; and a list of the eight kings who ruled Edom, the land of Esau’s and Seir’s descendants.\n\nFor further Parsah studies click here"
