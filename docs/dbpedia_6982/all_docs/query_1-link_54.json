        "text": "Scope and Contents of the Collection\n\nThe Margaret Bourke-White Papers, spanning 1863 through 1984, comprise biographical material, correspondence, photographs (prints, negatives, color transparencies, slides, etc.), writings, and memorabilia of the American industrial photographer, photojournalist, war correspondent and author (1904-1971). The collection not only reflects her personal life, but also illuminates the chaotic historical times (life in the United States during the Depression; World War II Africa, Germany, Italy and Russia; the partition of India; Korea's guerilla war) Bourke-White chronicled as a photographer for Henry Luce's Time, Inc. (first for Fortune (1930-1936) and then, from its inaugural issue in 1936, Life).\n\nBiographical material contains autobiographical documents including data Bourke-White supplied for biographical reference books, chronologically arranged biographical items, and awards. Biographical materials include a birth certificate, marriage and divorce papers from the 1920s, a 1919 character analysis, mementos from her youth, and her mother's notes on Bourke-White's childhood. Also included here is a complete list of all Bourke-White's Life magazine assignments, compiled by Special Collections staff for reference purposes.\n\nCorrespondence-subject files are subdivided into Family and General. Arranged chronologically, Family correspondence begins with letters dated 1863 of Bourke-White's maternal grandparents, Joseph and \"Bella\" Bourke, and also includes those of parents Minnie and Joseph White, sister Ruth, brother Roger, and several other aunts, uncles, and cousins. General correspondence-subject files follow, arranged alphabetically, and extend to Bourke-White's death in 1971. Through the mid-1950s, correspondence of most depth and duration includes that of advertising agency Meldrum & Fewsmith, Inc., friend M. Jerry Papurt, publishers Simon & Schuster, secretary Margaret Smith, and Time, Inc. Reflecting the scope of her influence and career, Bourke-White's correspondence includes that of artists (Boris Artzybasheff, Rockwell Kent, Georgia O'Keeffe, Lee Simonson, John Vassos, Gluyas Williams); authors (Sherwood Anderson, Pearl Buck, Stanley Burnshaw, Norman Cousins, Theodore Dreiser, Joseph Freeman, John Gunther, Lillian Hellman, Maurice G. Hindus, Joseph North, Robb Sagendorff, Stefansson Vilhjalmur); entertainers (Pablo Casals, Maurice Chevalier, Burl Ives, Andre Kostelanetz, Alexander (Abrasha) Schneider); industrial clients (Aluminum Company of America, American Iron and Steel Institute, Atlantic Refining Company, Bethlehem Steel Company, Congoleum-Nairn Corporation, Flintkote Company, Ford Motor Company, Gulf Oil Corporation, International Harvester Company, International Paper Company, Lehigh Portland Cement Company, National Engraving Company, Otis Steel Company, Oxford Paper Company, Swift and Company); journalists (Robert Cromie, Irv Kupcinet, Frank Moraes, Edward R.

Scrapbooks contain a variety of clippings about Bourke-White. Miscellany contains various mementos (memberships and identifications, theater programs, stenographers' notebooks, photography studio plans, war bonds posters); items about Bourke-White; and items from other people (writings by others, including the diary of her physical therapist, music, and a pencil portrait).\n\nPhotographic equipment consists of Bourke-White's cameras, camera cases, accessories, and other tools of her trade. Reflecting both technological growth and the rigorous demands Bourke-White placed upon her equipment (and herself), these range from a simple pocket box camera to a large camera specifically designed for aerial photography, and also include a wooden view camera, 35mm cameras, and optically complex German lenses. Some are in near-perfect condition; other show the effects of hard use, include mold, rust and physical damage.\n\nPhotographs, personal contains photographs of family, friends, animals, landscapes, etc. There are a number of candid photographs of Bourke-White herself, alone and with others, some taken while she was on location for various jobs. The items are a mixture of color and various types of black and white prints, and a few negatives. Some items have accompanying letters, captions, notes, etc. An item-level inventory of this material is available in Excel form.\n\nPhotographs, professional consist of photographs taken by Bourke-White for clients, both corporate (airlines, factories, magazines, railroads, steel mills, universities, etc.) and individual.
