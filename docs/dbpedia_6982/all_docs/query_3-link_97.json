        "text": "The status of German High Culture and that of German National identity have historically been bound up with each other in a unique way setting the German National project apart in Europe as what Friedrich Meinecke described in 1907 as a Kulturnation.[2] With the appearance of his work Die deutsche Katastrophe in 1946,[3] he sought to revisit his discussion of Germany as a nation defined by his earlier conception of cultural value as a means to recover moral standing for a defeated and shamed nation, now defined by barbarism and folly by the Allied powers occupying it. In examining two films, Georg Klaren’s 1947 Soviet Zone adaptation of Georg Büchner’s Woyzeck,[4] and Karl-Heinz Stroux’s 1949 filming of Goethe’s Werther[5], released in the Tri-Zone just before the founding of the Federal Republic my paper will cast new light on this dilemma through the popular medium of Cinema. Both films feature the authors themselves as diegetic mediators for the adaptations of their work. I shall examine the choices of Büchner and Goethe as authors for the screen and look at what role they fulfil in a recuperative project of German cultural and national identity under Allied occupation.\n\nThis paper focuses on two cultural developments in Germany and their intersection in the period from 1880 to 1935. One of these developments is the robust reception of the Arabian Nights in print. The other is the emergence of visual culture in the form of motion pictures. The paper shows how the literary reception of the Arabian Nights as a visual experience can help explain why filmmakers like Ernst Lubitsch (Sumurun, 1920), Fritz Lang (Der müde Tod, 1921), and Paul Leni (Das Wachsfigurenkabinett, 1924) adapted the content and narrative structure of the Arabian Nights in their cinematic work.\n\nAs a rising field within Germanistik, Asian-German Studies has been a hotspot for recent scholarship on postcolonialism, orientalism, gender and sexuality studies, area studies, migration studies, and more. Asian-German films, along with literature, television series, and new media, have increasingly become desirable teaching materials for courses that explore transnational aspects of German culture, history, and society. This concise Asian-German filmography, compiled by Qingyang Zhou (UC Berkeley), Zach Ramon Fitzpatrick (UIC), and Qinna Shen (Bryn Mawr), aims to provide a teaching guide not only to Germanists, but also to scholars in neighboring academic disciplines. This filmography includes fifty critically acclaimed, aesthetically creative, and/or thematically interesting Asian-German films produced by filmmakers in both the larger German-speaking world and in Asia, focusing mainly on East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. The list is organized geographically and chronologically. The countries represented are listed in descending order based on the size of the corresponding immigrant groups in Germany (see the figure below for exact numbers). Each entry includes both a short description that highlights unique features of the film and selected works of secondary literature-listed chronologically-that may be assigned as course readings.\n\n\"[T]he carefully constructed essays in [this volume] contribute to elevating this reference book so much more than its component parts could have achieved - much like German cinema itself. It is a volume that contributes significantly to reference works on German cinema, European cinema, and cinematic history. Any academic library that has students that might get the merest whiff of cinema as part of their curriculum should ensure this work is available to them.\" -- Matt Borg, Sheffield Hallam University, REFERENCE REVIEWS “A Companion to German Cinema represents the cutting edge of German cinema studies that will force scholars to rethink their approach to the subject. Conceptually innovative and theoretically rigorous, the collection convincingly claims that the renewal of the field must occur from its margins.” -- Roy Grundmann, Boston University “This book is meant to re-envision what has been little seen, unsettle your thinking about German cinema and visual culture, and examine German cinema’s socially transformative potential.” -- Dora Apel, Wayne State University “Combining a path-breaking exploration of German cinema beyond the canon with a serious contribution to theories of nation and transnationalism, this collection is a much-needed addition to European film scholarship.” -- Rosalind Galt, University of Sussex A COMPANION TO GERMAN CINEMA offers a wide-ranging collection of essays demonstrating state-of-play scholarship on German cinema at a time during which cinema studies as well as German cinema have once again begun to flourish. * Offers a careful combination of theoretical rigor, conceptual accessibility, and intellectual inclusiveness * Includes essays by well-known writers as well as up-and-coming scholars who take innovative critical approaches to both time-honored and emergent areas in the field, especially regarding race, gender, sexuality, and (trans)nationalism * Distinctive for its contemporary relevance, reorienting the field to the global twenty-first century * Fills critical gaps in the extant scholarship, opening the field onto new terrains of critical engagement\n\nAs a rising field within Germanistik, Asian-German Studies has been a hotspot for recent scholarship on postcolonialism, orientalism, gender and sexuality studies, area studies, migration studies, and more. Asian-German films, along with literature, television series, and new media, have increasingly become desirable teaching materials for courses that explore transnational aspects of German culture, history, and society.

The list is organized geographically and chronologically. Each entry includes both a short description and selected works of secondary criticism. The filmography also has a link to a long list with hundreds of titles.\n\nOrientalism which studies the point of view of West to East is discussed throughout history. Many books, papers and lectures have produced about this concept. But orientalism has gained a worldwide fame in a short time with the masterpiece \"Orientalism\" penned by Edward Said in 1978. Said argued that Europe and USA looked down Eastern societies and they systematically worked for placing this perception all minds. Edward Said said that orientalist images are produced systematically and organized in all areas; from novels to story books, from scientific papers to discussion texts and pictures. Starting with the image in the visual field, orientalism is adapted technological developments and started to appear in the mass media in the 21st century. Especially European and American film directors have filmed many movies in which orientalist images are heavily used. This study aims to put forth the reflection of orientalism at the cinema through a cine film. In the first part of the study; the concept \" orientalism \" and history of orientalism, orient, other, east-west separation will be explained. In the second part of study; some orientalist cinema movies filmed at the past and some examples of the status of orientalism in the cinema will be taken in hand. In the last part, analysis of the movie will be displayed. In this content, orientalist images in Taken 2 movie which released in 2012 were examined. By analyzing the indicators and the dialogues of the movie, some information has been reached about Turkey's position and loaded adjectives about Muslims."
