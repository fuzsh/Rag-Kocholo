        "text": "BARDELYS THE MAGNIFICENT\n\nU.S. 1926, dir. King Vidor.\n\nBardelys the Magnificent (1926) was a long sought-after lost film, until an original nitrate print was discovered in France in 2006. This lavish John Gilbert vehicle is based upon the novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by King Vidor, who just one year before had directed Gilbert in the smash hit The Big Parade. In France âin an age of light loves and lively scandals,â the Marquis de Bardelys (Gilbert), casual womanizer and accomplished swashbuckler, makes a rash wager that he can woo and win the virtuous Roxalanne de Lavedan (Eleanor Boardman); and against a background of intrigue and hidden identities, he sets out to court her. Lavishly mounted and superbly directed with spectacular action scenes, Bardelys is a hugely entertaining action romance given an A-plus MGM production. The sole surviving print was found in France in 2006; the English titles are restored according to the original script. A gap in the recovered footage is bridged with stills, titles, and footage from the original trailer so the story is complete. The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra provides a lovely score of period photoplay music; Antonio Coppola provides an alternate musical score on piano. This release is possible through the graciousness of Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures.\n\nA second DVD contains the earlier John Gilbert feature Monte Cristo (1922), in which Gilbert plays the Alexander Dumas prisoner who escapes and exacts a careful revenge on his persecutors.\n\n\"Another great set piece concludes the film: a duel of rapiers between Bardelys and the principal villain (Roy DâArcy) in which Vidorâs rapid, razor-sharp cutting, mobile camera and compositional brilliance (with an emphasis on long, straight lines that seem to multiply the presence and power of the swords) easily makes up for what Gilbert lacks in the Douglas Fairbanks department of sheer athleticism. Dazzling technical displays like this one were what made Vidor perhaps the best known director of the day; for all of the inventiveness he never loses the continuity and clarity of the action.\n\n\"This excellent edition from Flicker Alley offers a crystalline transfer of what was apparently an original nitrate print in very good condition; a few missing scenes are bridged with the use of stills and one brief piece of film â of another duel â that survived from the movieâs trailer. The score, compiled from period music by Rodney Sauer and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, provides glittering support.\"\n\n-- Dave Kehr, The New York Times\n\n\"An outstanding and perfectly-suited orchestral musical score by Rodney Sauer and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra enhances the quality of this already very satisfying Hollywood-style escape.\" -- Barbara Burkowski, at amazon.com.\n\n\"The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra accompanied the SFSFF screening with a compilation score by pianist/leader Rodney Sauer for the filmâs resurrection, and itâs a perfect fit with the sly humor and sassy approach of swashbuckling action.\" -- Sean Axmaker, Parallax View.\n\nHere are some themes:\n\nSerenade de Pierrot Ã Pierrette, by Burgmein, a cute novelette for a scene of light court intrigue.\n\nIn St Malo, part of the suite \"In Brittany\" by Christiaan Kriens, a love theme for the weeping-willow boating sequence that can be glimpsed in King Vidor's Show People.\n\nDesperation, by Walter Schad, for Eleanor Boardman in distress.\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE SEXES\n\nU.S. 1928. B&W. 88 mins. dir. D.W. Griffith.\n\nThis title is one of D.W. Griffith's last silent films, and is a mixture of comedy and melodrama. Phyllis Haver in particular is perfect as the gold-digging blonde. We chose music by Gaston Borch, J.S. Zamecnik, and others to make a score that follows the film from comedy to tragedy and back again. The DVD version includes a \"hidden\" track that identifies each of the pieces in the compiled score by title and composer.\n\n\"Visually and aurally, it's an astonishing transfer boasting probably the best video of any silent film presently available on DVD, thanks to a well-preserved negative. The soundtrack, recorded in Dolby Digital and beautifully performed by the Mont Alto Orchestra, is an even greater treat. \" --Wade Major, DVDFile.com\n\n\"...beautifully restored and awarded a highly appropriate new score by Rodney Sauer and Susan Hall of the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, this once so maligned failure emerges as perhaps the legendary director's most approachable work.\" -- Hans J. Wollstein, allmovie.com\n\n\"This is perhaps the most elegant film D.W. Griffith directed in his legendary career... Although the characters and even the plot may seem very stereotyped, it is still a very entertaining film made even more enjoyable due to perfect picture quality and a most exceptional musical score. In fact, the music is one of the best silent film accompaniments I've ever heard, and is a highlight of this DVD.... While the original soundtrack to this film is lost, this beautiful new recording by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is a real pleasure to listen to, and anyone who appreciates fine, quality music surely won't be disappointed. Whether interested in D.W. Griffith's work or not, this film is simply a pleasure to watch, and is also a fine example of cinema styles of 1928.\" -- Barbara Burkowski, amazon.com\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A NATION\n\nUSA 1915, Directed by D.W. Griffith\n\nAlmost a century after its release, The Birth of a Nation remains one of the most controversial films ever made... a landmark achievement that continues to fascinate and enrage audiences. It is the epic story of two families, one northern and one southern, during and after the Civil War. D.W. Griffith's masterful direction combines brilliant battle scenes and tender romance with a vicious portrayal of African Americans. It was the greatest feature-length blockbuster yet to be produced in the United States, and the first to be shown in the White House. After seeing the film, President Woodrow Wilson declared it was \"like writing history with lightning!\" In cities and states across the country, the film energized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which tried to have the film banned, or at least the most gruesome scenes censored. The film also inspired African Americans to move into filmmaking as a way to offer alternative images and stories.\n\n\"If you're new to the world of silent film, D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) doubles as the best and worst introduction. This 187-minute American epic paints a racially-charged, largely fictional tale with a suspicious historical backdrop...and in today's world, no studio would touch it with a ten-foot pole. 96 years ago, the film's nationwide release caused quite a controversy, bolstering the relatively-new NAACP while leading to violent protests and canceled screenings.... Any way you slice it, Griffith's film is a technical marvel and a true epic...\n\n\"...this silent film is paired with an impressive DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track featuring a soundtrack rendition by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, which is also available in a PCM Stereo mix. It's a fantastic effort and provides a nice accompaniment to the film, even if the crispness of the audio stands in contrast to the visuals.\" -- Randy Miller III, dvdtalk.com.\n\nAn essay about the new Mont Alto score.\n\nAudio excerpts:\n\nDance of the Amazons, by Anatole Liadow\n\nMisterioso e Lamentoso, by J.C. Breil.\n\nTHE BLUE BIRD\n\ndir. Maurice Tourneur U.S. 1918\n\nBased on the \"symbolist\" play by Nobel-prize winning poet Maurice Maeterlinck, The Blue Bird is a fantasy that was long popular as a children's play, despite it's sometimes dark bent. A brother and sister travel through a dream-world looking for the blue bird of happiness, and encounter characters representing human emotions and frailties. The special effects, imaginative costumes, and symbolic scenic design show that the following year's Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was not so far ahead of its time after all. As usual, our score is compiled from period silent film music, and this time leans towards avant garde and dream-like compositions by Gaston Borch, Henry Hadley, Rubinstein, and Edward MacDowell; among others.\n\n\"The Tourneur version features a brilliant new score by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra that is one of the best silent film scores Iâve ever heard, bringing drama, humor, and mystery in just the right amounts, and featuring sound effects that add to the pleasure of viewing the film.\"\n\nMarilyn Ferdinand, Ferdyonfilms.com.\n\n\"The esteemed Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra provides a compilation score that's quite appropriate without Mickey-Mousing the film to death. The moods follow quite well, and the only sound effects supplied are a few raps at the door. There's a broad soundstage that gives depth and spacing to the instruments of the small orchestra, giving the sensation that they're in the pit before you. The recording quality is first rate and there's nothing at all to complain about here.\"\n\nThe Palace of Happiness music, \"The Atonement of Pan,\" by Henry Hadley\n\nThe old widow, and the happiness of home theme, \"Rest\" by Gaston Borch.\n\nSee Mont Alto's cue sheet for The Blue Bird.\n\nCHICAGO\n\ndir. Frank Urson, Cecil B. DeMille\n\nLike the musical Chicago that won the Best Picture Academy Award and five other Oscars in 2002, this original 1927 version descends from a 1926 hit Broadway play by Maurine Watkins. It's a terrifically entertaining mix of humor and melodrama as well as a pungent critique of trash journalism. Frank Urson signed Chicago as director, although it is substantially the work of Cecil B. DeMille and his A-list technical staff. (DeMille apparently judged it unseemly to take full credit for this cynical and secular story while his religious spectacle The King of Kings was still in theatres!) Chicago is silent filmmaking at its peak, with an outstanding score for this edition by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. The 1927 Chicago was long believed a lost film, but a perfect print survived in Cecil B. DeMille's private collection. Restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive in 2006, it has since been widely performed to rapturous audiences.\n\nThis deluxe 2-DVD set also includes two excellent bonus films: The Golden Twenties (1950), a compilation documentary feature produced by The March of Time from authentic footage of the era; and Oscar-winning Lauren Lazin's The Flapper Story (1985), in which several self-declared children of the roaring twenties look back across the decades on their youthful lives.\n\n\"For an example of formally closed, classical filmmaking, you can't do much better than Chicago, the original 1927 film of the Broadway hit (by Maurine Watkins) that eventually yielded the eternal musical. Nominally directed by Frank Urson, though said to be largely the work of its producer, Cecil B. DeMille, it's a film in which each small detail (the brand of a pocket watch, for example) seems to contribute to the unfolding of the plot, and every scene has its place in a rigorous, unbroken chain of cause and effect. DeMille is often criticized for the campy excess of his biblical spectacles, but at heart he is the most severe of logicians â a Protestant posing as a revivalist preacher.\n\nLong thought lost, \"Chicago\" was discovered in a near-perfect print in the DeMille archive and positively glows in this gorgeous disc from Flicker Alley. Phyllis Haver is all rolled stockings and peroxide as the accused murderess Roxie Hart; Robert Edeson is the tweedy embodiment of civic corruption as her lawyer; and Victor Varconi exudes moral probity as Roxie's luckless husband. There's an excellent score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, as well as a supplementary disc of documentaries on the 1920s. (Flicker Alley, $39.95, not rated)\n\n-- Dave Kehr, 7/11/10, The New York Times\n\n\"...An article in the liner notes makes a strong case for this show actually being helmed by producer Cecil B. De Mille, who, thinking it negative publicity to have his name emblazoned under the tawdry Chicago while his reverential King of Kings still played in the theaters, gave directing credit to his assistant director, Frank Urson. The proof of De Mille's direct involvement is in the pudding, I think. Chicago is an astonishingly well-made entertainment, especially in how it negotiates wild swings in tone. Much of Roxie's rise and fall is played as rambunctious comedy â nestled securely within a slick satire of the news media's ability to affect and degrade the process of criminal justice â but the mood can segue instantly into edgy melodrama, especially when it details Amos' slow crawl to self-awareness.\n\n\"In an article in Flicker Alley's accompanying booklet, Rodney Sauer, the leader of The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, discusses the challenges of arranging a score for such a mercurial film, but he's crafted a beauty. The story's lighter moments often carry a sweetly swinging period pop tune, and here Sauer's crack eight-piece ensemble sounds like a pit band for a twenties Jerome Kern musical. Sauer also expertly arranged a few well-judged sound effects; never have I heard a more convincing jangle from a garter rimmed with little bells.\n\n\"Flicker Alley's release is a two-disc set, with the second disc containing a pair of unusual documentaries: The Golden Twenties, a 64-minute look at the decade from 1950, and The Flapper Story (1985), a short (29-minute) but fascinating analysis of women's newfound freedom in the '20s, featuring interviews with several octogenarian gals who were there.\"\n\n-- Gordon Thomas, Bright Lights Film Journal, August, 2010\n\n\"The Flicker Alley re-presentation of this once-thought-lost film is topnotch. Chicago benefits immensely from the jaunty musical track performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, an effective \"period\" re-creation that is faithful to its pop roots without swinging too slavishly down Tin Pan Alley. Drawing on the original cue sheets, conductor Rodney Sauer strove for \"an example of a score that could have been heard in a theater when this film was first released.\" Though silent film purists will grouse at the addition of sonic effects for aural sweetening (a ringing alarm, the clang of bells, a pistol shot), the postproduction soundtrack is welcome sweetening, with none of the brassy intrusiveness of so many retrospective scores.\"\n\n-- Thomas Dsoherty, Cineaste, 2010\n\n\"The film is accompanied by a music score compiled by Rodney Sauer and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, leading practioners of the art of silent film accompaniment. As usual, we were impressed and entertained by the quality of the musical arrangement and ensemble performance.\"\n\n-- Carl Bennett, www.silentera.com\n\nExcerpts from the score:\n\nA jazzy foxtrot, Stealing by Dan Sullivan.\n\nA lively one-step, Too Much Ginger, by Jos. M.

Mae Murray stars as a poor Irish girl who -- to get a job as a cabaret dancer -- assumes the identity of a scandalous woman of the world. She falls in love with millionaire Rudolph Valentino, whose father worries about her assumed bad reputation -- but it's even harder to establish her innocence! A lively ragtime-era score is based on the original cue sheet, and includes several dance numbers.\n\n\"I was also very pleased with the second film on this DVD, namely The Delicious Little Devil from 1919 in which Valentino stars opposite Mae Murray; another popular star of the silent era. While Valentino plays the usual appealing role of the lover, it is Mae Murray, in my opinion, who steals the show in this surprisingly entertaining film with her vibrant, energetic and expressive manner. The musical accompaniment chosen for each film is of a very high standard...\" -- Barbara Burkowski, amazon.com\n\n\"The [Beyond the Rocks] disc offers another feature from the Filmmuseum archive: Mae Murray stars in A Delicious Little Devil (1919), with Valentino in a small supporting role....This spry, working-class comedy is a real charmer, and while it hasnât undergone the kind of careful restoration given Beyond the Rocks itâs very watchable, all the more so because of a score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra thatâs brimming with period flavor.\" -- Leonard Maltin, leonardmaltin.com/picks.htm\n\n\"The film is accompanied by an excellent small orchestra stereo music score, compiled by Rodney Sauer based on cue sheets from 1922, performed by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.\" -- SilentEra.com\n\nListen to the Peacock Dance music, the oriental foxtrot Suez by Ferdie Grofe.\n\nDESTINY\n\nGermany 1921, dir. Fritz Lang.\n\nA great feat of imagination, this is an early collaboration by Fritz Lang and writer Thea von Harbou, the team who later created the science fiction masterpiece Metropolis. A young couple is travelling through medieval Germany. They st op in a village where Death has recently bought a small garden. When Death takes the young man, the maiden pursues Death to his chapel, and demands that he return her lover. Death, tired of the grief he is required to inflict on humankind, gives the maiden a challenge -- she may have her lover back if she is able to defeat Death by saving one of three doomed lives in Arabia, in Venice, and in China. The combination of Faust-like allegory, extravagant sets and costumes, and exotic swash-buckling adventure makes this an irresistably entertaining and thought-provoking film.\n\n\"I do think that Mont Alto's score, including not only the beautiful individual selections and the wonderful performances of them but most particularly Susan's and your keen analysis and breakdown of the film, selection and editing of the perfect piece to accompany each segment, is fully the equal of Destiny itself; which is to say, it is a masterpiece.\"\n\n-- David Shepard, Film Preservation Associates\n\n\"The film presentation is enhanced by a small orchestra musicial accompaniment by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. The music is comprised of adaptations of traditional German melodies and other authentically arranged scores to compile a very welcome and very pleasing film score. We have taken to playing the DVD while we work just to listen to the musical performance.\"\n\n-- Carl Bennett, www.silentera.com\n\nOrder the score from Destiny on CD\n\nSee Mont Alto's cue sheet for Destiny\n\nDON'T CHANGE YOUR HUSBAND (1919) plus THE GOLDEN CHANCE (1915)\n\nU.S. 1915, dir. Cecil B. DeMille\n\nIn Don't Change Your Husband, Cecil B. DeMille's first film with Gloria Swanson, Leila Porter (Swanson) tires of her dull nouveau-riche husband (Elliot Dexter) who is inattentive, sloppy, and an eater of green onions. She trades him for Schuyler Van Sutphen, a suave but two-timing playboy (Lew Cody), but when she learns Van Sutphen is having an affair with Toodles (Julia Faye), she encourages her now-reformed husband to pursue and remarry her. This edition is digitally mastered from the 35mm preservation negative, tinted according to the original instructions, and features authentic photoplay music performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. The drama of a woman who should have changed husbands long before she did, The Golden Chance, almost forgotten today, is one of Cecil B. DeMille's superlative early efforts. Against her family's wishes, beautiful and well-bred Mary (Cleo Ridgeley) has married Steve Denby (H. B. Carpenter), a criminal lout whose alcoholism has reduced the couple to destitution in a one-room slum apartment. Mary finds work pretending to be an attractive single woman, as part of a snare to entrap an eligible millionaire (Wallace Reid). This edition is digitally mastered from the 35mm preservation negative, tinted according to the original instructions, and scored with authentic photoplay music compiled and performed by Rodney Sauer.\n\n\"The score [for Don't Change Your Husband], performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, is adapted from musical themes that were popular among theatre accompanists of the period (compiled by Rodney Sauer and Susan Hall). Crisp and concise, Mont Alto's score beautifully enhances the formal nature of this comedy of manners, occasionally indulging in musical whimsy to flavor the moments of subtle comedy that might go unnoticed behind a more rambling score. Most memorable is a scene in which Mrs. Porter compares her suitor's impeccable attire to her husband's slovenly appearance, while strumming on a ukelele. Mont Alto deftly bounces between the playful uke (tightly synched to Swanson's fingerwork) and a series of dour musical responses (that provides a reminder of the grim reality of her marital situation). This coalesces beautifully with DeMille's careful editing of the scene, yielding a taste of silent cinematic expressiveness in its purest form.\" â www.turnerclassicmovies.com.\n\nFAUST (1925)\n\nGermany, dir. F.W. Murnau\n\nMobilizing the full resources of the Ufa Studios, F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu, Sunrise) orchestrated a colossal adaptation of Goetheâs Faust that ranks alongside Fritz Langâs Metropolis as the greatest achievement of the German silent cinema. GÃ¶sta Ekman stars as the titular alchemist who, struggling with his faith amidst a devastating plague, is offered the power to cure and the gift of youth...in exchange for his soul. As the diabolical Mephisto, Emil Jannings (The Last Laugh) delivers a performance of operatic scale and intensity, by turns charming, comical, and horrific. This special Kino edition contains the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundationâs meticulous restoration of the original German version of the film (with unique hand-painted intertitles), as well as a lengthier alternate cut prepared by the Ufa Studios in 1930.\n\nThe melodrama of the story allows Mont Alto to record some of the most interesting and emotional music from the silent film repertoire, from demonic summonings to highly emotional agitatos.\n\n\"Faust has two audio options. First, the 5.1/2.0 treatment is given to a new recording by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra working from materials \"compiled from historic photoplay music.\" I enjoyed this soundtrack. It was full of the proper bombast and intense emotions fitting the images.\" -- DVDTalk.com\n\n\"...The image quality is far superior to any print available before. And it is also a substantially different film, with superior compositions, performances and special effects, reflecting Murnauâs final choices from the vast amount of material he created during production.\n\n\"This amazing piece of scholarship is the work of Luciano BerriatÃºa of the Filmoteca EspaÃ±ola, who has also assembled a documentary, included on the Kino disc, comparing sequences from the various surviving versions side by side.\n\n\"With Emil Jannings, Germanyâs leading star of the 1920s, as a shape-shifting Mephisto, the Swedish actor Gosta Ekman as a neurasthenic Faust and the dancer Camilla Horn as Marguerite (a role intended for Lillian Gish), Faust is both a great work of art and a bravura piece of showmanship. Visually, Murnau draws on sources that range from medieval tapestry through Rembrandt etchings to Expressionist paintings and sculpture, constantly varying the look of the film according to its tone. The loftiest poetic sentiments are blended with extravagant spectacle that rivals Cecil B. DeMille (an Italian court that somehow includes animatronic elephants) and Steven Spielberg (when Mephisto whisks Faust away on a night flight across Europe).\" -- Dave Kehr, The New York Times\n\n\"Three scores are available: the majestic Olympia Chamber Orchestra one included in the film's 1995 revival, a fierce new one by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra (in 5.1 surround), and a piano recreation of the original 1926 arrangement. All three are outstanding... A masterpiece gets the deluxe DVD treatment it deserves. -- Fernando Croce, Slant Magazine.\n\n\"Amazingly, F. W. Murnauâs 1926 adaptation of Goetheâs âFaustâ (available in a new restoration from Kino) uses no speech at all: itâs a silent film, and Murnau extracts the essence of Goetheâs poetic masterwork through the strength of his images. The movie tinkers a bit with the story in order to favor the directorâs own visions; Goetheâs wide-ranging imagination sets in motion a teeming world, whereas Murnau suggests medieval villages with expressive set design (narrow alleys, steep stairways, sharply sloping roofs, and slashing shadows). If the human element is reduced in scale (Faust himself is stripped of metaphysical rhapsody and becomes merely frustrated), Goetheâs cosmic element is Murnauâs triumph: the director conjures grand-scale conceits that set the drama firmly between Heaven and Hell. Such astonishingly vast visual conceits as the Devil covering a town with his wings and spewing gas to spread the plague, or the final transfiguration of the martyred lovers, suggest an artistic imagination that isnât merely adaptive but even rivals Goetheâs own.\" -- Richard Brody, The New Yorker.\n\n\"German director F.W. Murnau concocted two of the most visually intoxicating films of the silent era, Nosferatu and Sunrise. Now his third indisputable masterpiece, a morally thunderous adaptation of Goethe's Faust, has gotten a ravishing face-lift for a two-disc set. If you're a fan of silent films (or, frankly, even if you're not), you'll be knocked out cold by Murnau's indelible images, haunting use of shadows, and trippy, dreamlike expressionist sets. EXTRAS include a longer version of the film originally shown in the U.S. and a wunderbar making-of doc.

Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman\n\nBuster Keaton's most well-known film, here presented with a score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Railroad engineer Buster Keaton is rejected by the Confederate Army and by his sweetheart, Annabelle (Marion Mack). But when Northern spies kidnap both Annabelle and The General (his beloved train engine), it sets in motion cinemaâs most perfectly structured comic epic.\n\nThis 1927 silent film is presented here in a beautiful transfer from an archival print. The five-piece Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra uses historic âphotoplay musicâ to create an authentic, exciting, and compelling score of the kind heard in movie theaters in the 1920s.\n\nExtras include a commentary track by Howie Movshovitz and Rodney Sauer and a mini-feature about silent film music repertoire and performance.\n\nHere's a trailer in QuickTime format.

Pianist Rodney Sauer uses an authentic silent era music 'library' to create the music that is played during the film and he has made some very good selections. The music really accents the film without going overboard. This group doesn't try to add feeling that isn't there; they don't try to make a slow moment in between gags funny by playing some goofy music. Instead they let the movie speak for itself; their music accents the emotions and attitude already present of the film.\n\n\"The General is one of my favorite films, and I've seen it many times and with many different accompaniments. I can confidently say that this Mont Alto score is my favorite so far. They did a wonderful job accompanying a fantastic film.\n\n\"...This is a great, great movie. Funny, touching, and, well, funny; it is one of those productions where everything just comes together perfectly. The new soundtrack by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is wonderful to listen to and fits the movie very well.

RenÃ© Clair\n\nRenÃ© Clairâs sparkling comedy of manners is a witty, delicate, inspired satire on propriety and behavior in the bourgeois mind-set. Transposing the action of the perennial stage farce from 1851 to a summer wedding day in 1895 â the birth of cinema â Clair recalls detail, costume and design captured by the first movies. The Italian Straw Hat â Un Chapeau de paille dâItalie â triumphantly survives its 1927 journey from stage to screen; a dozen eccentric characters, superbly acted, try desperately to keep up appearances in the face of disaster, their attitudes, concerns and gestures exquisitely stylized under Clairâs deft orchestration. The sets and costumes, too are a charming combination of the suffocating and the exact.\n\n\"Made in 1927, as the silent era was drawing to a close, the film is a highly kinetic farce that contains some residual surrealist elements, including a fantasy sequence with sinister men in silk hats, a bed that scoots around by itself, and a general delight in that favorite surrealist trope, furniture being flung out of windows. But this is an audience-friendly film, not meant to scandalize and provoke but to comfort and amuse while evoking a warm nostalgia for a recent past...\n\n\"...Like all great farces, \"The Italian Straw Hat\" is as much concerned with order as disorder; Fadinard's world spins around furiously but never topples. The loveliest part of the film may be its slow denouement, as the chaos dissipates and the underlying patterns emerge.\n\n\"This new edition from Flicker Alley presents \"The Italian Straw Hat\" in its complete version for the first time in America, drawing on a negative made for a British release in 1930, with some missing shots taken from an original French print. For musical accompaniment, the viewer is given a choice of two soundtracks: a graceful arrangement of period themes from Rodney Sauer's Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra and a rollicking piano score by Philip Carli.\"\n\n-- Dave Kehr, The New York Times (full review here).\n\n\"If you've never seen this before (and I must admit, with embarassment, that I hadn't before the DVD arrived) you're in for a real treat -- this is, as Pauline Kael accurately observed, one of the funniest films ever made....\n\n\"As you'll see, Flicker Alley's disc version derives from a brand new restoration (in high def from a 1930 English negative, with missing scenes filled in from a European print) and it looks amazing. You can also chose between two excellent new stereo music tracks; I prefer the chamber score by the Mont Alto Orchestra (which is based on opera/operetta music of the period called for in the original cue sheets from when the film played back in the day), but the piano accompaniment by Philip Carli has a certain zip that's appealing as well. The set also includes Clair's wonderful 1928 short La Tour (The Eiffel Tower), which is a nicely avant-garde tribute to the Parisien landmark, and you can access an English translation of the complete 1851 farce Straw Hat is based on as a DVD-ROM extra.\"\n\n-- Boxoffice, April 2 2010.\n\n\"How can a film that's more than eighty years old seem fresh and modern? That's the marvel of Rene Clair's silent gem The Italian Straw Hat (1927), which has been lovingly restored by producer David Shepard for DVD release through Jeffery Masino's Flicker Alley. If you've never seen the picture, you owe it to yourself to experience its wit and charm, which is comparable to the finest work of Ernst Lubitschâ¦yet it is distinctly, unmistakably French....\n\n\"Flicker Alley's superb presentation does the movie proud...

Fred Niblo\n\nDouglas Fairbanks pioneered the double role of Zorro and the foppish Don Diego, combining action and comedy in a delightful romp that established the tradition of the masked superhero. The success of this film changed Fairbanks from a successful light comedian to Americaâs top action star.\n\nThis 1920 silent film, newly transferred from a fine-grain safety print of the original negative, is accompanied by the five-piece Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra using historic âphotoplay musicâ to create an authentic, exciting, and compelling score of the kind heard in movie theaters in the 1920s.\n\nExtras include:\n\nAn optional commentary track with John Tibbetts, Denise Morrison, and Rodney Sauer\n\nA gallery of John Tibbettsâ Fairbanks artwork\n\nSubtitles identifying the musical pieces used\n\nA short video about âcompiledâ silent film scores\n\nThis is Mont Alto's second self-released DVD in our \"Private Reserve\" series and is only available directly from Mont Alto. The film and score also appear in the boxed set A Modern Musketeer, in a digitally stabilized version of the same transfer, but without the commentary and extras. Although self-released, it is not a DVD-R; it is a pressed region-free DVD-5.

This score fits the film beautifully, from Don Diego's introduction where the silence of a stranger entering a bar obscured by an umbrella is broken with some frivolous sounding music to the fast-paced songs used for the exciting chase at the end. The music always compliments the action on screen, but never overpowers it or distracts from the visuals. Needless to say, the members of Mont Alto are excellent musicians which makes this score all the more enjoyable to hear....\n\n\"This is a great Fairbanks film, full of excitement, comedy, and just the right amount of drama. This charming film is wonderfully accentuated by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra's score. Though the disc is only available through their web site, it's worth picking up as it's a quality production all the way around. Highly Recommended.\" --- John Sinnott, DVDTalk.com\n\n\"Revisiting this costume drama, one is struck by how thoroughly enjoyable it is from start to finish. Fairbanks and director Fred Niblo expertly combine action, adventure, suspense, and comic relief, with none of the elements overwhelming the others... this is probably the best presentation of this classic to date.\n\n\"Most discs that feature Mont Alto scores have excellent recording quality, and this compilation score is no exception. The music is firmly placed in the soundstage, with vivid immediacy. The trumpet in particular comes across beautifully here, though the violin is also frequently striking. No noise or hiss interferes. Although there are a few moments that get a shade repetitive, on the whole the compilation is very effective indeed and supports the action very well; more than once I forgot that I was listening to a score and had become totally absorbed in the film. A wonderful sonic experience that should serve as a model.\n\n\"I've previously complained that prior releases of Fairbanks' movies, especially this one, have been released without commentaries or suitable supporting materials. I need complain no more. This disc offers an excellent commentary from author John Tibbets, film festival organizer Denise Morrisson, and Rodney Sauer, who is pianist for the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra and also compiled the score for this version. They have a lively chat that offers plenty of history, details, and thematic and musical analysis without ever becoming dry or pedantic. The threesome obviously love the movie, and it shows.\n\n\"...Sauer also hosts a featurette, A Practical Guide to Film Scoring (3m:58s), which gives a look at the process. It's only regrettable in its brevity. A gallery offers a look at various pieces of striking period-style Fairbanks artwork by Tibbetts, and there's a trailer for Mont Alto's release of The General, a similarly excellent release.\" -- Mark Zimmer, DigitallyObsessed.com.\n\nHere are some audio samples from the DVD score:\n\nBallet Barbarian, by J.S. Zamecnik, used for a horseback chase through the mountains.\n\nMelancolie, by Rachmaninoff, for scenes of cruel oppression.\n\nSillhouettes (Spanish), by Henry Hadley, for local Mexican color.\n\nHere is a screen capture from the video:\n\nA MODERN MUSKETEER\n\nBoxed Set of Early Douglas Fairbanks Films\n\nNote: Mont Alto's contributions are the score for A Modern Musketeer and The Mark of Zorro.\n\n\"...an extraordinary, well-produced set of 10 features and one short film arrives on Tuesday from Flicker Alley. These arenât the more familiar costume epics from Fairbanksâs later career â several of which have been issued in fine editions by Kino International â but rather the modern-day comedies that first established his screen personality...\n\n\"...This pattern reaches one of its high points in âA Modern Musketeer,â a 1917 feature that was one of 11 films Fairbanks made with Allan Dwan, the great master of early film form. Long available only in an incomplete print, the movie was restored in 2006 with footage found by the Danish Film Institute and makes its first appearance on DVD with this set.\n\n\"In it Fairbanks plays a Kansas go-getter whose obsession with Alexandre Dumas drives him to ever more preposterous acts of romantic gallantry. In the end he is able to unleash his inner swashbuckler when, during a visit to the Grand Canyon, he is called on to rescue a young woman (Marjorie Daw) from the clutches of an outlaw gang.\n\n\"Dwanâs early command of match-cut editing â the apparently seamless presentation of action across a series of shots â is shown off to tremendous advantage here: Fairbanks seems to cut through space like an arrow in flight, a pure line of strength and beauty.\n\n\"A Modern Musketeerâ begins with a winking prologue in which Fairbanks presents himself in full costume as DâArtagnan, tugging at his false mustache and adjusting his wig to assure his audience that Doug could indeed be found somewhere beneath the shrubbery. Fairbanks was testing the waters for what would be the next development in his career, the transition to period adventure films that began with âThe Mark of Zorroâ in 1920.\n\nThe Flicker Alley set offers âZorroâ in a glisteningly sharp print made from a source close to the camera negative, and the other titles in the box have been mastered with consummate care, even when the source material is not perfect. The movies are presented with period-accurate color tinting and accompanied by appropriate scores performed by some of the leading figures in silent-film music, including Philip Carli, Robert Israel and Rodney Sauer, the leader of the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.\" --Dave Kehr, The New York Times\n\nListen to Romance (by GrÃ¼nfeld) from the score.\n\nOLD IRONSIDES\n\nThis grand production from Paramount tells the story of the Barbary War, in which America defeated the pirates of the Mediterranean (as the Marines hymn tells, at the \"shores of Tripoli.\" The film starts with a rousing session of congress in Philadelphia, where it is decided to build a navy rather than pay tribute for safe passage.\n\nCharles Farrell and Esther Ralston are the romantic leads, and Wallace Beery and George Bancroft have a ball serving up comic relief as crusty sailors. But the star of the film are the tall ships and the vast naval battle scenes, during one of which a full-sized sailing ship was sunk near the isthmus of Catalina Island.\n\nThe score of this edition is Rodney Sauer's piano-solo rendition of the original New York premiere score, part composed (and part compiled) by Hugo Riesenfeld and J.S. Zamecnik, and preserved at the Library of Congress. Like the later score for Wings, It is a fascinating example of the use of \"character themes\" in early film scores, as themes were composed for the major characters. In those portions of the score that were composed for the film, these themes are woven in and out of the action as the characters appear on the screen (note especially the New England dock scenes and the first squall on shipboard). But in those portions of the score that were compiled from pre-written music, such as the battle sequences, those character themes are of course completely absent.\n\nTo the piano score I also added Foley percussion effects, since this film is full of explosions, cannonfire, and other effects that benefit from the involvement of a busy percussionist.\n\nOld Ironsides was originally intended to be shown in \"Magnascope,\" which is a fancy way of saying that the picture was left smaller than necessary but then expanded to the full size of the screen at dramatic points (referred to as \"large picture\" in the follwing excerpt). The score also called for the film speed to be changed as the film progressed according to the table below (expressed in feet-per-minute, which was the most common gauge on movie projectors of the time). As you'll note, the composers felt that the singing of \"Hail Columbia\" was filmed too fast, hence the film is slowed down to allow the audience to better sing along.\n\nKudos to Rodney Sauer, who has beautifully adapted the score from the film’s New York premiere, and performs it on piano. There is nothing more disconcerting than inappropriate music tacked on to a silent film, but Sauer is an expert accompanist and hits all the right notes in support of this feature. His music augments the film perfectly and is among the real highlights of this blu ray release.\" -- Jim Neibaur's Silent Cinema review site\n\nTHE PENALTY (1920)\n\nIn a role that established him as one of the most dynamically terrifying performers of the silent screen, Lon Chaney stars in The Penalty, a grotesque thriller from director Wallace Worsley (The Hunchback of Notre Dame).\n\nWhen an incompetent doctor amputates the legs of a young boy, he has no idea that the youth will grow up to be the immoral and embittered Blizzard, a criminal mastermind who orchestrates a bizarre and heinous plot to avenge himself upon his malefactor. The Penalty teems with irony and sexual menace as Blizzard befriends the surgeon's daughter and serves as an artist's model for her sculptural rendition of Satan, waiting for his moment to show the depth of his demonic desires.\n\nIn playing the devious Blizzard, Chaney tightly harnessed his legs within a pair of leather stumps, flawlessly rendering the physical disfigurement that so profoundly echoes the misshapen mind that drives this sadistic character toward his violent destiny. As Chaney biographer Michael Blake says, \"One has to wonder if the intensity Lon brought to this role might have been due in part to the pain produced by his harness.\"\n\n\"The accompanying music score compiled by Rodney Sauer and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is excellent and a vast improvement over the synthesizer score of the Kino DVD edition noted below. The score is appropriate to the filmâs action, mood-settting, entertaining and historically respectful of the film. The music is well-recorded and excellent listening in both surround and stereo sound.\"\n\n- Carl Bennett, www.silent-era.com.\n\n\"The audio on 'The Penalty' comes in two flavors, The Mont Alto Orchestra DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and The Mont Alto Orchestra 2.0 LPCM. For the purpose of this review, the DTS-HD track was chosen and it certainly doesn't disappoint. A subtly layered effort, the new musical mix envelops the listener with a sound quality that belies the age of the film â but in only the best possible way. While most of the orchestral sound and piano elements are pushed through the front channels, the lossless track will occasionally send certain elements through to the rear channels for added effect. The result is astonishing musical clarity that accompanies the onscreen images and action quite well.\"\n\nKevin Yeoman, High Def Digest\n\nListen to Maurice Baron's Valse Pathetique from the score.\n\nPEOPLE ON SUNDAY (Menschen am Sonntag, 1930)\n\nOn DVD and Blu-Ray, from the Criterion Collection\n\nPeople on Sunday (Menschen am Sonntag) represents an astonishing confluence of talentâan early collaboration by a group of German filmmakers who would all go on to become major Hollywood players, including eventual noir masters Robert Siodmak (The Killers, Criss Cross) and Edgar G. Ulmer (Detour, Bluebeard) and future Oscar winners Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard, Ace in the Hole) and Fred Zinneman (High Noon, A Man for All Seasons). This effervescent, sunlit silent film, about a handful of city dwellers enjoying a weekend outing (a charming cast of nonprofessionals), offers a rare glimpse of Weimar-era Berlin. A unique hybrid of documentary and fictional storytelling, People on Sunday was both an experiment and a mainstream hit that would influence generations of film artists around the world.\n\n\"...the movie captures the vicissitudes of courtship with time-lapse acuity: the switched allegiances (Wolfgang, you cad!), the nervous etiquette (Christl and Wolf shake hands three separate times at the end of their first meeting), the seismographic spikes and plunges of moment-to-moment attraction. People on Sunday is timelessly perceptive about the intermingling of lust, hostility, and boredom that happens when a romantic chemical equation has some trouble finding its balance.\" -- Jessica Winter, Believer Magazine\n\n\"It really can't be emphasized enough how much of a delight it is to watch People on Sunday. The mood is buoyant, but laced with a hint of underlying cynicism, the camerawork graceful and accomplished, the performances unassuming. It's an auspicious, if ultimately atypical, work from a collaborative group of future filmmaking stars... People on Sunday certainly sounds interesting from an academic standpoint, but it's also a totally enchanting film experienceâa quality that will likely catch a number of viewers by surprise.\" -- Dusty Somers, Blog Critics\n\n\"There are two choices of scores, the first is a sort of generic orchestration that was typical of the era, and an original modern version composed by Elena Kats-Chernin. Both alternatives are fairly recent recordings and are offered in stereo. Much to my surprise, I preferred the breezy, bluesy qualities of the first [Mont Alto] track. The Kats-Chernin chart was excessively busy and overly cued for my taste - with brief segments reminiscent of Phillip Glass at his most hyper - and ultimately more distracting than supportive.\" -- IonCinema\n\n\"Each of the disc's two scores is presented as a bright and clear uncompressed PCM soundtrack. The first--and the one that the disc, I think rightly, defaults to--is the most recent, composed and performed by the Mont Alto Orchestra live for the film's showing at the 2009 Telluride Film Festival, and now recorded especially for Criterion's release. This score is closer in tempo and melody to what one more readily associates with the musical accompaniment for a silent film. The second soundtrack is a score conceived and performed by the Czech Film Orchestra in 2000; it is notably slower and more contemplative, and using the audio key on my remote to alternate from one soundtrack to the next reminded me of just how powerful an ingredient film music is, as the Mont Alto soundtrack makes many scenes feel lighter, more buoyant and carefree; whereas the Czech Film Orchestra soundtrack (which even includes some operatic vocals) adds a somewhat weightier, more tender aspect to some of the same scenes. As usual for Criterion, this is an embarrassment of riches; over time, it would not seem at all unreasonable to give each of the scores at least one go.\" -- Christopher McQuain, DVDTalk.com\n\nHere are some samples of music from the score:\n\nCanzonetta, by Victor Herbert\n\nAce of Clubs, by Ted Fiorito\n\nOctober Twilight, by Henry Hadley\n\nSerenade, by Saint-SaÃ«ns\n\nPERILS OF THE NEW LAND\n\n(The Italian, 1914).\n\nThis collection of early films includes the 1914 film The Italian, the 1913 Traffic in Souls, and three Edison short features: Police Force, New York City (1910), McQuade of the Traffic Squad (1915), and The Call of the City (1915). The Italian is about the experiences of Beppo, who emigrates to New York City in order to earn enough money to please his fiancee's father.\n\n\"With excellent musical accompaniment by Rodney Sauerâs Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra (for The Italian) and the pianist Philip Carli (for Traffic in Souls), this is one of the summerâs most outstanding releases.\" --Dave Kehr, The New York Times.\n\n\"The Italian has a score compiled and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra who, as usual, are wonderful.

Often compared to Citizen Kane in terms of audacious directorial debuts, STRIKE embodies the revolutionary spirit of the Soviet people of the 1920s, cresting the waves of artistic and political idealism.\n\nThis edition of STRIKE was mastered in HD from a 35mm film element restored by the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que de Toulouse, with a newly-recorded score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, adapted largely from the works of traditional Russian composers.\n\n\"This edition has been transferred in high-definition from the 35mm restored version by La CinÃ©mathÃ¨que de Toulouse. As would be expected from older print materials, there is a noticable amount of film grain that is fully reproduced in HD here. However, the edition is quite pleasing with its high-definition transfer that well-balanced but a little dark across the grayscale range, nonetheless holding open shadow areas in the picture that were previously plugged-up in older video transfers. A few shots are distractingly jittery, with the picture jumping about in the frame. We wish that picture stabilization had been performed on the preservation materials or on the video transfer. The edition is presented with new video-based English language intertitles.\n\n\"Excellent musical accompaniment has been arranged from traditional Russian music by Rodney Sauer and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.

Stuck in a hopeless job, she builds a fantasy life around a mysterious customer who left a shirt at the laundry, and who she comes to believe will return for the shirt -- and for her. Despite some lovely comic sequences involving caring for a horse in her upstairs apartment, and her fantasy of how she fell from being the daughter of a duke to be a laundry drudge, Mary wanted it to end with Amanda being left alone, her dreams dissolved. When audiences reacted badly to this tragic, Chaplinesque ending, Mary filmed several \"happy\" endings -- two of which appear on this disc.\n\nThis DVD contains two complete versions of the film. The print used in foreign releases was composed completely of different takes from the print released in the U.S. The American print has a score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, while the European release has a score by the organist Gaylord Carter.\n\n\"This movie comes with a stereo score that was arranged and performed by the Mont Alto Orchestra. The audio was very good, sounding clean and clear and creating a nice atmosphere for the film. I really enjoy orchestral tracks, even from a small five piece group like Mont Alto. They just seem to breathe life into silent films and make them more enjoyable to watch.\n\n\"This audio track did a good job of complimenting the action on screen. They managed to accent the drama without becoming over bearing like many scores in current movies do. A good example of this is when Amanda comes to a bitter realization at the end of the film. Instead of having the string section swell up with sad music (if I have to listen to that one more time I think Iâll scream) they have a clarinet come to the forefront, followed by a violin and piano. They followed the mood of the scene instead of trying to take the lead. A very fine score, especially when you compare it to Gaylord Carterâs organ soundtrack to the foreign release cut of the film.\"\n\n--DVDTalk.com\n\nTHE THIEF OF BAGDAD\n\nU.S. 1924, Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nMont Alto has compiled and recorded a score based loosely on the original cue sheet by James Bradford.\n\nA spectacular accomplishment in production design and special effects, Raoul Walsh's THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is a bold Arabian adventure starring Douglas Fairbanks as a carefree pickpocket who turns his appealing brand of mischievous thievery toward the attainment of happiness... and an exotic Princess (Julanne Johnston). The only way he can win either is by retrieving the rarest treasures hidden within the mysterious Orient, a quest that grows more fantastic with every passing thrill, as the tenacious thief rises high above the city on a magic carpet, battles a fire-breathing dragon in caverns of flame and soars into the clouds on the back of a winged steed via innovative special effects.\n\nThis special Kino on Video DVD is the definitive edition of Fairbankss classic, digitally mastered from a 35mm archive negative, with 19 minutes of rare outtakes and special effects footage.\n\nReview from DVDTalk.com\n\n\"...The sound track is provided by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra based on the original 1924 cue sheets. Mont Alto has been around for around for about ten years specializing in live accompaniments to silent movies. This is the tenth movie that they have recorded a music track for. Though I have heard of them before, this is disc is the first time I have heard their music. I was very impressed. The score worked very well, accenting the mood, and complimenting the action, but never becoming intrusive. This five piece ensembles thoughtful arrangement added another dimension to the picture. I can only hope that they crop up on more DVDs in the future. The sound quality was very good. The stereo mix sounded full and clear. There was no hiss or tape noise that sometime accompanies older soundtracks. One of the best sounding silent era DVDs I have had the pleasure to screen.\n\n...A very impressive looking disc, one of the best silent era DVDs Ive seen.... The musical score added a lot to the film, illustrating how important the musical selection can be. All this is on top of an excellent movie that is full of spectacle and grandeur. A delightful romp through a Bagdad that never existed, but we all wish did. If only all silent era DVDs could live up to the high standards set by this disc. \"\n\n\"The exception, again, is The Thief Of Bagdad, an all-around winner. Its lavish and evocative orchestral score matches Raoul Walsh's vigorous direction and the eye-poppingly inventive matte effects, which pack nearly every frame with incidental wonder.\"\n\n-- The Onion\n\nListen to the Opening Title music for the Thief of Bagdad -- a medley of Azora: Prelude to Act III (Henry Hadley) and Priere Hindoue (Irenee Berge).\n\nListen to Orientale, by Nicolas Amani, the music we use for the scene at the giant statues of Kandahar.\n\nRead Mont Alto's cue sheet for The Thief of Bagdad.\n\nTRUE HEART SUSIE / HOODOO ANN\n\ndir. D.W. Griffith U.S. 1919 / 1916. 86 min.\n\nIn 1918-1919, D. W. Griffith turned from spectacles such as The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, and Hearts of the World to smaller films, which he called his \"short story series.\" Among these is True Heart Susie. \"There are those of us who consider True Heart Susie to be Griffith's masterpiece,\" writes Tom Gunning in his notes for a 2006 screening at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. He goes on to praise the \"narrative structure and point of view, as well as the fine details of performance, framing, and even the use of intertitles that makes a seemingly modest film such as this appear nearly incandescent in its confessional and emotional power.\" In an almost mythical American arcadia, Lillian Gish portrays a pure, prim girl who so loves her childhood sweetheart (Griffith's most charming boyish hero, Robert Harron) that she sells the family cow to anonymously finance his higher education, only to lose him to a more \"modern\" woman (Clarine Seymour) when he comes home. Gish's performance is among her best, her face what Gunning calls a \"battleground of emotions, staging complete and progressive dramas of realization, recognition and despair.\"\n\nAs a bonus feature we offer Hoodoo Ann. This light comedy is Griffith-supervised and scripted (using the pseudonym Granville Warwick), although the actual direction is by Lloyd Ingraham. Mae Marsh is paired with Robert Harron; the actors had been often partnered since Biograph days, concurrently were in the modern story of Intolerance and continued to play leads together until Miss Marsh left the company at the end of 1916. Although the plot is a tangle of unlikely coincidence, the performers make it work, and \"it is filled with those little touches for which Fine Arts pictures are famous,\" in the words of an original review.\n\n\"... a new score, performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, ... perfectly captures the filmâs knowing naÃ¯vetÃ©.\" -- David Kehr, The New York Times. (See complete review).\n\n\"The score for the feature film was performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra from a score compiled by the group's pianist, Rodney Sauer. They do their usual excellent job, both musically and having the music fit the tone of the movie. Hoodoo Ann is presented with a piano score that Mr. Sauer compiled and plays. This too was very good and the solo piano fit the simple feeling of the movie. Mr. Sauer also realizes that less can be more and in some scenes has very minimal music. The section where Ann breaks a doll that she's 'borrowed' is like that, and the lack of energetic playing accented the scene well. Since these are recent recordings there are no audio defects. The sound is strong and clear.\" -- John Sinnott, dvdtalk.com.\n\n\"The presentation is buoyed by a pleasant small-orchestra music score compiled from contemporary theatrical sheet music by Rodney Sauer and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, one of the best practioners of silent film accompaniment.\" -- Carl Bennett, silentera.com.\n\nListen to Henry Hadley's piece Lily of the Valley from the score.\n\nListen to Henry Hadley's Silhouette: American from the score.\n\nListen to Irenee Berge's Serenade Lointaine from the score.\n\nRead Mont Alto's cue sheet for True Heart Susie.\n\nLES VAMPIRES\n\ndir. Louis Feuillade, 1915-1916. 6.5 hours.\n\nThe undisputed master of the espionage serial, Louis Feuillade (FantÃ´mas) crafted films with labyrinthine plots and unforgettable characters that influenced multiple generations of filmmakers. Comprised of ten episodes, and clocking in at nearly seven hours in duration, Les Vampires is an unqualified masterpiece. It follows journalist Philippe GuÃ©rande (Ãdouard MathÃ©) in his efforts to expose a vast criminal organization known as the Vampires. Joined by a comical sidekick, Mazamette (Marcel LÃ©vesque), and often competing against a rival gang lord (Fernand Herrmann), GuÃ©rande dethrones a succession of the Vampires' Grand Masters. But most evasive of all is the Vampires' muse, a seductive assassin who performs her job with deadly grace: Irma Vep (Musidora).\n\nAuthorized by the Gaumont Studios, this edition was mastered in HD from the 35mm restoration produced in 1996 by the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que FranÃ§aise, under the supervision of Feuillade's grandson, Jacques Champreux.\n\n\"This presentation is accompanied by a wonderful music score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Well arranged and performed, the music adds texture and pacing to this atmospheric thriller. We now prefer this music score and performance to others for Les Vampires released on home video.\" -- Carl Bennett, Silent Era\n\n\"Though obviously a silent film and thus not needing a soundtrack restoration, Les Vampires is presented with a stunning â and I mean stunning â score by the Mont Alto Picture Orchestra. Theyâve crafted a very definite, iconic theme to accompany the film that recurs often, though not so much as to feel this was merely put on a loop. Scene-specific scoring, as with a rousing party or a particular moment of suspense, feels perfectly attuned to the film. They do throw in a few instrumental sound effects, like a clock ticking or a doorbell buzzing, but anyone whoâs seen a silent film with orchestral accompaniment can attest this is a fairly common practice, one almost inherent to the form. Anyway, it is wonderful, and Iâve been humming the theme for days.\" -- Scott Nye, Battleship Pretension\n\nHere is the complete recording of Fourteen Fathoms Deep: An Undersea Tragedy, by M.L. Lake. This is the \"Main Theme\" that I selected for the serial, particularly because it starts with a distinctive four-note musical phrase that I could quote whenever the Vampires do something nasty or surprising. I also recorded those four notes on each solo instrument in the Mont Alto quintet, so that I could vary the statement depending on the mood of the scene. After that introduction, the piece has six repeated sections, many of which quote that four-note theme. By using different sections at different points in the seven-hour score, I could avoid over-using the main theme, while still giving the score some cohesiveness.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nHere's a recording of Danse Exotique, by Wilson Smith, from the score.

DeMille, U.S. 1920\n\n\"At a time, in the teens and early 20's, when divorce was becoming increasingly common but still considered scandalous, DeMille took it as the subject of a series of films. Two, Don't Change Your Husband (1919) and Why Change Your Wife? (1920), have recently been released in fine, tinted versions with excellent scores by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra.\n\n\"Both feature DeMille's first muse, Gloria Swanson (who 30 years later in \"Sunset Boulevard\" would finally advise him that she was ready for her close-up). In \"Don't Change Your Husband,\" she's a jazz baby married to a boorish businessman (Elliott Dexter) and leaves him for a society fop (Lew Cody). \"Why Change Your Wife?\" reverses the roles, with Swanson as a housebound prude whose husband (the major silent era star Thomas Meighan) leaves her to marry a flapper (Bebe Daniels).\n\n\"The films are early examples of the subgenre the philosopher Stanley Cavell called \"the comedy of remarriage.\" DeMille, as he did in his biblical spectacles, shrewdly manages to have things both ways, suggesting that there's nothing like a good divorce to teach you to understand and appreciate your spouse.\n\n\"Husband is the more extravagantly entertaining of the two, replete with the lavish historical flashbacks and wild party scenes that were becoming DeMille's trademark. But the more restrained Wife has its pleasures as well, as when Swanson steps out for a flapper makeover that leaves her looking like a spider with a cocaine dependency.\"\n\n--Dave Kehr, The New York Times\n\n\"The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra (led by Rodney Sauer) can always be counted upon to provide flavorful and historically accurate scores for silent film, and this DVD is no exception. When Mr. and Mrs. Gordon disagree over their musical tastes alongside the Victrola, it becomes an opportunity for Mont Alto to provide a playful added layer of comedy and meaning to the film. Their concisely orchestrated arrangements make Why Change Your Wife (and its co-feature) an aurally rich viewing experience.\"\n\n-- Asa Kendall Jr., Turner Classic Movies (www.tcm.com)\n\nBoth of these films are accompanied by the Mont Alto Orchestra and they do a wonderful job, as always. This five piece group compiles their own scores from music of the time giving the films an authentic feel. The music is scene specific, of course, and played with much precision. This music really brings the films to life and adds a lot to the enjoyment of the film. (I especially liked the way they matched the child playing the piano in Miss Lulu Bett. The music itself made me laugh.)\n\n-- John Sinnott, www.dvdtalk.com.\n\nThe waltz \"Persian Princess\" from the score to Why Change Your Wife.\n\nTHE WISHING RING\n\nU.S. 1914, dir. Maurice Tourneur.\n\nThe Image DVD \"Before Hollywood, There Was Fort Lee, N.J.\" features several short films scored by different musical ensembles. Mont Alto contributed the score to the longest feature on the DVD: Maurice Tourneur's The Wishing Ring.\n\n\"The film which makes this DVD worthwhile is The Wishing Ring (1914). Directed by the great Maurice Tourneur, it is set in early 19th century England, telling the story of the son of an earl who after getting himself kicked out of school and falling out with his father, finds himself working as a lowly gardener. Here he meets and falls in love with the parson's daughter. This is an accomplished film, sweet and romantic, with good acting and production values. The tinted print is very good, clear and sharp with hardly any damage. The Mont Alto Orchestra score is full of tunes associated with England. The score and the playing of Mont Alto really fits the action. At times they even deliberately play excruciatingly badly when, for instance, the action includes a character who can't play the piano. This musical effect is well done and makes for an unusual experiment, which for the most part works very well.\"\n\nMr. Peter G. George, on amazon.com.\n\n\"The end result is absolutely enchanting and I feel we can share real pride at bringing this forgotten film back to glowing life.... Beyond the lovely music I thought the donkey and dog effects and the deliberately awful intoxication and hymn music were in complete accord with the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the whole thing. A big tip of the hat. It's BEAUTIFUL.\"\n\nDavid Shepard's comments on delivery of the final score\n\nListen to Herbert Haines composition \"A Simple Love Episode\" from Mont Alto's The Wishing Ring score\n\nSee Mont Alto's cue sheet for The Wishing Ring."
