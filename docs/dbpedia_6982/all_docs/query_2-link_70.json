        "text": "TVING’s upcoming historical drama “Queen Woo” (literal translation) has shared stills of Jeon Jong Seo!\n\n“Queen Woo” is a historical action drama that follows the story of Queen Woo, who becomes the target of five tribes seeking to gain authority and princes who are after the throne following the sudden passing of the king.\n\nJeon Jong Seo plays the role of Woo Hee, the queen of Goguryeo, who struggles to find a new king within 24 hours. Woo Hee, who is known as the most beautiful woman in Goguryeo, belongs to the Woo clan, which has produced queens for generations. Despite her intelligence and strength, she lives as a pawn for her clan because she is a woman.\n\nHowever, with the sudden death of the king, the throne is left vacant, and Woo Hee finds herself in the middle of a power struggle among the tribes. In order to survive on her own, Woo Hee reveals her true self, which she had been hiding beneath the facade of a queen.\n\nThe newly released photos from the drama reveal Woo Hee’s dramatic transformation. She radiates the grace and charisma of a true queen as she commands the palace with both elegance and dignity. Her intelligent aura is evident in her eyes, which shine brightly even in the dark.\n\nCaptured wearing armor and drawing a bow, Woo Hee perfectly transforms into a battlefield warrior, showcasing a different kind of charisma from her palace persona. It remains to be seen if Woo Hee can protect herself and her clan amidst the power struggle.\n\n“Queen Woo” is set to premiere on August 29.\n\nWhile you wait, watch Jeon Jong Seo in “Wedding Impossible” below:\n\nWatch Now\n\nSource (1)\n\nWhat are Cookies?\n\nWhen you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
