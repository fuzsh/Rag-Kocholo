        "text": "CHRONOLOGY\n\n14 Jun 1775 The Second Continental Congress authorized the Continental Army which later became the United States Army. Shortly thereafter, Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates on the northern frontier reported to Commander in Chief George Washington that \"the sick suffered much for Want of good female Nurses.\" General Washington then asked the Congress for \"a matron to supervise the nurses, bedding, etc.,\" and for nurses \"to attend the sick and obey the matron's orders.\"\n\n27 Jul 1775 The Second Continental Congress authorized medical support for a Continental Army of 20,000 men, and submitted a plan to General Washington for creating \"an Hospital\" (a Medical Department). This plan provided one nurse for every ten patients and \"that a matron be allotted to every hundred sick or wounded, who shall take care that the provisions are properly prepared; that the wards, beds, and utensils be kept in neat order; and that the most exact economy be observed in her department.\"\n\nAlthough the women who tended the sick and wounded during the Revolutionary War were not nurses as known in the modern sense, they helped blaze the trail for another generation nearly one hundred years later, in 1873, when civilian hospitals in America began operating recognized schools of nursing.\n\n7 Apr 1777 The pay of the nurse, originally $2 a month and one ration per day, was increased to $8 per month and one ration per day. The matron received $15 per month and a daily ration.\n\n1783­1817 After the Revolutionary War (1775­1783), the Congress drastically reduced the size of the military establishment. Medical service was provided at regimental level for the separate garrisons of a small, scattered Army during this period. Patient care was performed by soldiers detailed from the companies. There was no centralized medical direction by a formally organized medical department until the War of 1812.\n\n3\n\n14 Apr 1818 The Medical Department was reestablished by the Congress as a continuing staff agency under the direction of a Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Lovell. The passage of the Army Reorganization Act of 1818 marked the beginning of the modern Medical Department of the United States Army.\n\nAug 1856 The Secretary of War was authorized to appoint enlisted men as hospital stewards, equivalent to noncommissioned officers.\n\n10 Jun 1861 Two months after the Civil War began on 12 April 1861, the Secretary of War appointed Dorothea Lynde Dix, famed for her work on behalf of the mentally ill, as Superintendent of Women Nurses for the Union Army. Despite the impressive title, Miss Dix's authority was vague and limited: \"to select and assign women nurses to general or permanent military hospitals, they not to be employed in such hospitals without her sanction and approval except in cases of urgent need.\" Miss Dix headed the list of about six thousand women who served the federal forces. Some of the women, before reporting for assignment, received a short course in nursing under the dedicated direction of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States.\n\n3 Aug 1861 The Congress authorized the Surgeon General to employ women as nurses for Army hospitals at a salary of $12 per month plus one ration.\n\n1861­1865 During the Civil War (12 April 1861­26 May 1865), many women served as nurses in the hospitals of both the Union and the Confederate Armies, among them a large number of Catholic sisters of several religious orders. Some of the women who served in the Union hospitals were not on the Army payroll but were sponsored by the United States Sanitary Commission or by volunteer agencies. Women served as nurses in many hospitals, but the work was largely limited to preparing diets, supervising the distribution of supplies furnished by volunteer groups, and housekeeping details. Nonetheless, nearly one hundred years before development of the mid-twentieth century concept of progressive patient care, one nurse wrote of separating patients according to their needs:\n\n\"My ward was now divided into three rooms; and, under favor of the matron, had managed to sort out the patients in such a way that I had what I called my 'duty room,' my 'pleasure room,' and my 'pathetic room,' and worked for each in a different way. One, I visited with a dressing tray full of rollers, plasters, and pins; another, with books, flowers, games, and gossips; a third, with teapots, lullabies, consolation and-sometimes-a shroud.\"\n\nLouisa May Alcott\n\nHospital Sketches, 1863\n\n4\n\n1865­1898 Following the Civil War, soldiers continued to perform patient care duties in Army hospitals. On 1 March 1887, the Congress established a Hospital Corps (24 Stat. 435) consisting of enlisted hospital stewards and privates as a part of the Army Medical Department. Since these soldiers were permanently assigned to the Medical Department, training programs were developed in the various needed skills, including nursing functions. Thus began the formal establishment of a career for enlisted personnel in the Medical Department. In 1891, Capt. John Van Renssalaer Hoff, MC, organized the first company of instruction for members of the Hospital Corps at Fort Riley, Kansas.\n\n28 Apr 1898 At the onset of the Spanish-American War, the Surgeon General requested and promptly received congressional authority to appoint women nurses under contract at the rate of $30 per month and a daily ration.\n\nDr. Anita Newcomb McGee, Vice President of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), was placed in charge of selecting graduate nurses for the Army. Military nursing had been almost dormant since the Civil War. Dr. McGee suggested that the DAR act as an application review board for military nursing services. Thus the DAR Hospital Corps was founded, with Dr. McGee as its director. Civilian hospitals had been operating schools of nursing since 1873. Dr. McGee set high standards for volunteer applicants. For the most part, only graduates certified by approval of nursing school directors were accepted for appointment under contract to the Army. Many of the nurses were of the religious orders Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Mercy, and Sisters of the Holy Cross. Other nurses were obtained through the assistance of the Red Cross Society for the Maintenance of Trained Nurses in New York. Military nursing achieved a high level of professional competence. These military nurses became known as \"contract nurses\" of the Army.\n\nJul 1898 Between May and July, almost twelve hundred nurses had volunteered. The emergency which made the nursing services of women acceptable resulted from the inability of the Army Medical Department to enlist within a few weeks six thousand or more men qualified by previous experience to perform important patient care duties and from the epidemic prevalence of typhoid fever in the Army's camps. One nurse in a field hospital in Coamo, Puerto Rico, wrote:\n\n\"The nurses quartered in an old Spanish house in Coamo, located in a banana grove. We drove to camp in mule ambulances. Put in long hours. . . . Sick men from 3rd Wisconsin, 16th Pennsylvania, and 3rd Kentucky Regiments cared for by Army Nurses. All water for any purpose hauled in barrels from a spring more\n\n5\n\nthan a mile away. Tents crowded, typhoid fever, dysentery and diarrhea, conditions bad, no ice, no diet kitchen.\"\n\n1898­1901 Slightly more than fifteen hundred women nurses signed governmental contracts. Contract nurses served in the United States, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippine Islands, Hawaii, China, briefly in Japan, and on the hospital ship Relief. The maximum number on duty was 1,563 on 15 September 1898.\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War ended with the signing of the Peace Protocol on 12 August 1898, and as soon as the typhoid epidemic in the United States was brought under control in 1899, the number of women nurses was reduced to 700. By June 1900, there were 210 nurses serving under contract with the Army.\n\nDuring and following the Spanish-American War, fifteen nurses died of typhoid fever. Another, Clara Louise Maass of New Jersey, died of yellow fever on 24 August 1901. A former contract nurse, Miss Maass was not connected with the experiments of the Yellow Fever Commission (a board headed by Maj. Walter Reed, MC), but volunteered as a subject in the research on modes of transmission of the disease while she was employed in Cuba at the Las Animas Hospital, Havana. In 1904, William C. Gorgas, MC (later the Surgeon General, 1914­1918), who put the U.S. Army research findings to practical use in Cuba and later in Panama, stated that Miss Maass' death was a contributing factor in convincing physicians and the public that yellow fever was in fact transmitted by a mosquito vector.\n\n29 Aug 1898 The Surgeon General established a Nurse Corps Division in his office to direct and coordinate the efforts of military nursing. Dr. McGee was appointed Acting Assistant Surgeon and placed in charge. She immediately set about to make military nursing an attractive career.\n\n20 Jun 1899 The first Army regulations governing the Nurse Corps were published as a circular, approved by the Secretary of War and issued from the Surgeon General's Office. These regulations governed the appointment of nurses and defined their duties, pay, and privileges. Quarters and rations, transportation expenses, leave of absence in the proportion of thirty days for each year of past service, care when sick, a uniform, and a badge were authorized for the nurse. The pay was increased to $40 a month in the United States and to $50 in overseas areas. The regulations were reissued on 9 March 1900, with but two important changes: appointments were limited to citizens of the United States; and the annual leave was changed to thirty days authorized in each calendar year, regardless of length of service.\n\n6\n\n1901 A bill came before the Congress to establish a permanent Nurse Corps. While most contract nurses had been subject to Army control and regulations, others had been paid by private sources and were thus under the control of private individuals and voluntary organizations, such as the DAR and the Red Cross Societies. Such an arrangement created difficult administrative problems. This, coupled with the recognized need for women nurses, made it imperative that the status of the Army nurse be clarified and officially regulated. Earlier, Surgeon General George M. Sternberg had not been fully convinced that a permanent Nurse Corps should be established. He had been reluctant to have women serve with the troops in the field; he had commented on the added expense of \"luxuries\" for the women such as bureaus, rocking chairs, and other special items not previously requisitioned for the men; and many of his senior medical officers had disapproved of the idea. However, the record of service of the women nurses who served during the Spanish-American War was the convincing factor and paved the way for establishment of a permanent Nurse Corps. The Surgeon General, in his annual report of 1899, said:\n\n\"American women may well feel proud of the record made by these nurses in 1898­99, for every medical officer with whom they served has testified to their intelligence, and skill, their earnestness, devotion and self-sacrifice.\"\n\nAt the request of Surgeon General Sternberg, Dr. McGee wrote a bill to establish a Nurse Corps (female). What she wrote eventually became Section 19 of the Army Reorganization Act of 1901. Congress passed the bill after Dr. McGee left office on 31 December 1900, but she became known as the \"Founder of the Army Nurse Corps.\"\n\n2 Feb 1901 The Nurse Corps (female) became a permanent corps of the Medical Department under the Army Reorganization Act (31 Stat. 753) passed by the Congress. Nurses were appointed in the Regular Army for a three-year period, although nurses were not actually commissioned as officers in the Regular Army until forty-six years later-on 16 April 1947. The appointment could be renewed provided the applicant had a \"satisfactory record for efficiency, conduct and health.\" (The application for continuance of service every three years was discontinued in 1934.) The law directed the Surgeon General to maintain a list of qualified nurses who were willing to serve in an emergency. Therefore, provision was made to appoint a certain number of nurses with at least six months of satisfactory service in the Army on a reserve status. This was the first Reserve Corps authorized in the Army Medical Department. (The Army Medical Reserve Corps for medical officers only, 35 Stat. 66, forerunner of today's reserve component, was established by the Congress on 23 April 1908.) Each reserve nurse signed an agreement to enter active service whenever required and to report by letter to the Surgeon General every six months. There were thirty-seven reserve nurses who wore the badge of the Army nurse.\n\n28 Feb 1901 The number of \"charter\" members of the Nurse Corps as of this date was generally considered to be 202. There were actually 220 nurses on active duty, but this number included those at home awaiting discharge. By 1 July, 176 nurses remained in the Corps.\n\n15 Mar 1901 Dita H. Kinney, a former contract nurse, was officially appointed the first Superintendent of the Corps, a position she had held since 1 January 1901. Mrs. Kinney served as Superintendent of the Corps until she resigned on 31 July 1909.\n\n1902 The authorized strength of the Nurse Corps was fixed at 100 nurses and remained unchanged for ten years.\n\n12 Aug 1909 Jane A. Delano, a graduate nurse and active Red Cross worker, was appointed Superintendent of the Corps. She resigned on 31 March 1912 to serve as Chairman of the American Red Cross Nursing Service. In 1911, during Miss Delano's tenure as Superintendent of the Corps, the enrolled nurses of the American Red Cross were designated as the primary source of reserve nurses for the Army. The \"reserve list\" provision in the basic law had attracted few nurses in a decade of effort, but by 30 June 1913, there were 4,000 nurses eligible, by their consent, for active military duty assignment.\n\n1912­1914 The authorized strength of the Nurse Corps was increased to 125 in 1912 and to 150 in 1914.\n\n1 Apr 1912 Isabel McIsaac was appointed Superintendent of the Corps and served until her death on 21 September 1914.\n\n22 Sep 1914 Dora E. Thompson was appointed the fourth Superintendent of the Corps. Miss Thompson was the first Regular Army nurse to serve as Superintendent.\n\n6 Apr 1917 The United States entered World War I. There were 403 nurses on active duty, including 170 reserve nurses who had been ordered to duty (as a result of incidents on the Mexican border) in twelve Army hospitals in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. By 30 June 1917, there were 1,176 nurses on duty. One year later, 12,186 nurses (2,000 Regular Army and 10,186 reserve) were on active duty serving at 198 stations worldwide.\n\nMay 1917 Six base (general) hospitals, with more than four hundred nurses, sailed for France for service with the British Expeditionary Forces. Two\n\n8\n\nnurses with Base Hospital No. 12, Mercy and Wesley Memorial Hospitals, Chicago, Illinois, were killed en route by brass fragments caused by the faulty discharge of a gun. These hospitals were the first organized Army forces to serve in France in World War I. On 2 October 1917, General John J. Pershing sent a cabled request \"for a competent member of the Nurse Corps\" to supervise nursing activities in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). Bessie S. Bell, then Chief Nurse of Walter Reed General Hospital, reported to serve on 13 November 1917.\n\n25 May 1918 The Army School of Nursing was authorized by the Secretary of War as an alternative to utilizing nurses' aides in Army hospitals. Courses of instruction opened at several Army hospitals in July 1918. Annie W. Goodrich, who had been appointed under contract as Chief Inspector Nurse for the Army, became the first Dean of the Army School of Nursing. (On 23 March 1923, she was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.) Although the Adjutant General authorized a military uniform and an insignia consisting of a bronze lamp superimposed on the caduceus, the students in the Army School of Nursing retained civilian status. In December 1918 there were 1,578 students in the school. No decision had been made concerning the continuance of the school after the war. In February 1919 the Surgeon General gave assurance that the school would be continued. Of the students who elected to continue, 508 completed the course. By 1923, the school had been consolidated at Walter Reed General Hospital. It was discontinued by the Secretary of War on 12 August 1931 as an economy measure. A total of 937 young women completed the course in nursing and received the diploma of the school. Among its many illustrious graduates were Mary G. Phillips and Ruby F. Bryant, who later became Chiefs of the Army Nurse Corps. Other well-known graduates include Margaret Tracy '21, Lulu Wolf Hassenplug '24, Virginia Henderson '21, Myrtle Hodgkins Coe '27, Marion Kalkman '31, Edith Haydon '21, Laura Wood Fitzsimmons '26, Laura Louise Baker '21, Ruth Hubbard '21, Gertrude Wahl Small '21, Ann Louise Finch '21, Bessie Bell Randle '21, Eleanor L. Kennedy Berchtold '21, and Portia Irick '26. The list of achievers is extensive; many others directed nursing services in hospitals or agencies or were university faculty members. The Lamp and the Caduceus, written by Marlette Conde and published by the Army School of Nursing Alumnae Association in 1975, is a very interesting and authentic account of the beginning, progress, and closing of the Army School of Nursing.\n\n30 Jun 1918 Of the 12,186 nurses on active duty, 5,350 were serving overseas.\n\n9 Jul 1918 The Nurse Corps (female) was redesignated the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) by the Army Reorganization Act of 1918. The 1918 act (40 Stat. 879) restricted appointments to women nurses. Base pay was increased to $60 per month.\n\n9\n\n11 Nov 1918 Armistice Day. During World War I, the peak strength of the Army Nurse Corps reached 21,480 on 11 November 1918. More than ten thousand nurses had served in overseas areas in France, Belgium, England, Italy, and Serbia, as well as in Siberia, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Included were ten Sisters of Charity who served with Base Hospital No. 102 in Vicenza, Italy. Army nurses were assigned to casualty clearing stations and surgical teams in field hospitals as well as to mobile, evacuation, base, camp, and convalescent hospitals. They also served on hospital trains and transport ships. (Following the Armistice, nurses served with the occupation forces in Germany until the American forces were returned in 1923.)\n\nSeveral nurses were wounded, but none died as a result of enemy action. There were, however, more than two hundred deaths largely caused by influenza and pneumonia. The Distinguished Service Cross (second in rank only to the Medal of Honor, the highest decoration in combat) was awarded to 3 Army nurses. The Distinguished Service Medal (highest decoration in noncombat) was awarded to 23 Army nurses. In addition to other United States Army decorations, 28 Army nurses were awarded the French Croix de Guerre, 69 the British Royal Red Cross, and 2 the British Military Medal. Many Army nurses were named in British Army dispatches for their meritorious service.\n\nNurses who remained in the United States served with distinction in busy cantonment and general hospitals, at ports of embarkation, and at other military outposts. Many were cited for meritorious service.\n\n13 Nov 1918 Eighteen African American nurses were assigned to duty in the ANC following the influenza epidemic. Nine were assigned to Camp Grant, Illinois, and nine to Camp Sherman, Ohio. Their living quarters were separate, but they were assigned to duties in an integrated hospital. By August 1919 the reduction in force necessitated their release.\n\n15 Apr 1919 Jane A. Delano, Chairman of the Red Cross Nursing Service and former Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps, died in an Army hospital in France (Base Hospital No. 69 at Savenay). She had been making an official visit to review the activities of the American Red Cross. Miss Delano was buried at Loire, France, with military honors and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal posthumously. Her body was reinterred in the nurses' plot in Arlington National Cemetery in 1920, and Delano Hall, until recently a residence for nurses and nursing students at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, was named in her honor.\n\n29 Dec 1919 Dora E. Thompson, a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal for her leadership of the Corps during World War I, resigned as Superinten-\n\n10\n\ndent of the Army Nurse Corps, but accepted reappointment as Assistant Superintendent. Miss Thompson held the relative rank of captain after July 1920 and served with distinction until she retired on 31 August 1932, after more than thirty years of active service.\n\n30 Dec 1919 Julia C. Stimson, a graduate of Vassar College and New York Hospital School of Nursing, became the fifth Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps. Miss Stimson had been Chief Nurse of one of the base hospitals that served the British Expeditionary Forces. In March 1918, she became Chief of the Red Cross Nursing Service in France and, on 15 November 1918, the Director of Nursing Service, American Expeditionary Forces, France. In July 1919, she succeeded Annie W. Goodrich as Dean, Army School of Nursing. After appointment as Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps, Miss Stimson held both positions until the Army School of Nursing closed on 31 January 1933. In 1921, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Mount Holyoke College.\n\n4 Jun 1920 An Army Reorganization Act authorized relative rank for Army nurses. The act was passed by the Congress in recognition of the outstanding services of more than twenty thousand Army nurses during World War I. It authorized granting of the status of an officer with relative rank to Army nurses from second lieutenant through major:\n\n\"and as regards medical and sanitary matters and all other work within the line of their professional duties [they] shall have authority in and about military hospitals next after officers of the Medical Department. The Secretary of War shall make the necessary regulations prescribing the rights and privileges conferred by such relative rank.\"\n\nAlthough the act allowed Army nurses to wear the insignia of the relative rank, the Secretary of War did not prescribe full rights and privileges, such as base pay, for nurses equal to that of an officer of comparable grade.\n\n30 Jun 1921 Demobilization had reduced the Army Nurse Corps to 851 nurses with the following relative ranks: 1 major, 4 captains, 74 first lieutenants, and 772 second lieutenants.\n\nApr 1923 Annie W. Goodrich, former Chief Inspecting Nurse for the Army and the first Dean of the Army School of Nursing, was appointed Dean of the Yale School of Nursing-the first university-based undergraduate school of nursing.\n\n13 May 1926 Nurses were authorized retirement on length of service.\n\n11\n\nJul 1929 Maj. Julia C. Stimson was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in recognition of her service as Chief of the Red Cross Nursing Service in France and her service in the American Expeditionary Forces. This medal is a memorial to Miss Nightingale and is awarded by the International Committee of the Red Cross to honor those who have given distinguished and devoted service to the sick and wounded in times of war and peace and in disasters through service or education.\n\n20 Jun 1930 Retirement for disability incurred in the line of duty with no minimum length of service requirement was authorized for nurses.\n\n1937 Reid Hall, a residence for members of the Army Nurse Corps at the Station Hospital, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, was named in memory of Capt. Elizabeth D. Reid, ANC. Captain Reid had served in the Army with conspicuous distinction for twenty-nine years before her retirement in 1935. Captain Reid died in 1936.\n\n31 May 1937 Maj. Julia C. Stimson retired after twenty years of service-seventeen as Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps. She served as President of the American Nurses' Association from 1938 to 1944 and as Chairman of the Nursing Council on National Defense, which was later renamed National Nursing Council for War Service, from July 1940 to July 1942, and as a member thereafter. Major Stimson served on active duty from 7 October 1942 to 14 April 1943 to publicize the need for nurses in the armed services. Based on her service during World War II, she was advanced to the grade of colonel on the retired list on 13 August 1948 as a result of Public Law 810, 80th Congress. Colonel Stimson died a few weeks later on 30 September 1948.\n\n1 Jun 1937 Maj. Julia O. Flikke became the sixth Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps.\n\n8 Nov 1938 The \"Spirit of Nursing\" monument, a symbolic figure carved from Tennessee marble by Miss Frances Rich, was dedicated. This monument marks the plot reserved for military nurses in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n8 Sep 1939 A State of Limited Emergency was declared because of the war in Europe. There were 625 Regular Army nurses on active duty. The authorized strength of the Army Nurse Corps (Regular) was immediately increased to 949.\n\n30 Jun 1940 There were 942 Regular Army nurses in the Corps. An additional 15,770 nurses, enrolled in the First Reserve of the American Red Cross Nursing Service, were presumably available for service if needed.\n\n12\n\n27 May 1941 A State of National Emergency was declared because of the threat of global war. Once again, it became necessary to activate reserve nurses.\n\n7 Dec 1941 Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Within forty-eight hours, the United States was formally at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. There were fewer than seven thousand Army nurses on active duty when the United States entered World War II. Six months later, there were more than twelve thousand nurses on active duty.\n\n1942 Lt. Della Raney was selected as the first African American Chief Nurse in the ANC while serving at Tuskegee Air Field, Alabama. Approximately five hundred black nurses served in the Army Nurse Corps during World War II. They served in segregated units in the United States as well as overseas. First Lt. Susan Freeman was chief of the thirty nurses of the 25th Station Hospital that arrived at Roberts Field, Liberia, in March 1943. Lieutenant Freeman was awarded the Ribbon of the Knight Official, Liberian Order of African Redemption, when her tour of duty ended. In 1944, she was promoted to the rank of captain and presented the Mary Mahoney Award by the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses for her service during the Ohio flood disaster and in recognition of being the first black nurse to command an overseas unit in the ANC. First Lt. Agnes B. Glass was the Chief Nurse of the 335th Station Hospital at Tagap, Burma, that opened in late December 1944. During World War II, a total of 512 African American nurses were in the Army Nurse Corps: 9 were in the grade of captain, 115 were first lieutenants, and 388 were second lieutenants.\n\n13 Mar 1942 Maj. Julia O. Flikke, Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps, received a temporary commission as a colonel in the AUS (Army of the United States). Her assistant, Capt. Florence A. Blanchfield, received a temporary commission in the grade of lieutenant colonel, AUS. Although they wore the insignia of their grade, they were denied the pay of that grade, a decision of the Comptroller General which stated that these women were not \"persons\" in the sense of the law under which they were promoted. (In 1952, the 82d Congress in Private Law 716 reversed the decision and they, then retired, received the pay which had been withheld for ten years.)\n\n9 Apr 1942 The fall of Bataan. From December until early April, the fighting forces, including doctors, nurses, and corpsmen alike, had endured relentless hardships. On the night of 8 April, the remaining forces were ordered to withdraw to Corregidor as Bataan was falling. At Corregidor, Lt. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright and his forces fought on until 6 May, when he surrendered to the Japanese with some 11,500 troops. Twenty-one Army nurses escaped from Corregidor before it fell to the Japanese. Under cover of darkness, 10 of the 21 Army nurses made the trip safely to Australia in a PBY Catalina aircraft with approximately 25 other Army and Navy officers, crew members, and a few civilians. The other 11 Army nurses who escaped were evacuated by submarine.\n\n13\n\n6 May 1942 With the fall of Corregidor, 66 Army nurses remained in the Philippines as prisoners of war of the Japanese. The 54 Army nurses and a former Army nurse captured on Corregidor cared for American military patients there until 25 June 1942. In August, they were moved to the Santo Tomas Internment Camp for civilians. In September, they were joined by 10 Army nurses captured earlier on Mindanao. The first of two nurses captured at Baguio arrived a year later; the second nurse arrived from another prison camp on 4 February 1945, one day after their liberation. Although denied the privilege of caring for military patients at Santo Tomas, except for the few wounded during the liberation of the camp, they continued to care for the sick in a camp hospital under the able leadership of Capt. Maude C. Davison during their entire internment until relieved by Army nurses who arrived on 9 February 1945. The former Army nurse joined the Army Nurse Corps upon liberation, to make 67 who had been prisoners of the Japanese. On 18 February 1945, each of the Army nurse prisoners of war received the Bronze Star Medal and a promotion of one grade in ceremonies on Leyte before departing for the United States. The last nurse prisoner of war to remain on active duty with the Army Nurse Corps was Lt. Col. Hattie R. Brantley, who retired on 1 February 1969.\n\n30 Jun 1942 There were 12,475 Army nurses on active duty.\n\n8 Nov 1942 Nurses landed in North Africa on the day of the invasion. They were members of the staff of the 48th Surgical Hospital, later reorganized as the 128th Evacuation Hospital.\n\n22 Dec 1942 Public Law 828, 77th Congress, authorized the relative rank of Army Nurse Corps officers from second lieutenant through colonel. It also provided for pay and allowances approximately equal to those granted commissioned officers without dependents.\n\n17 Jan 1943 The first nurse to receive an Air Medal for meritorious service was 2d Lt. Elsie Ott. Lieutenant Ott served as a nurse for five patients who were being evacuated from India to Washington, D.C. This was the first aerial evacuation flight in nursing history and the pioneer movement of transporting wounded soldiers by air over such a great distance (11,000 miles).\n\n10 Feb 1943 Lt. Col. Florence A. Blanchfield became Acting Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps due to the illness of Col. Julia O. Flikke, the incumbent Superintendent.\n\n14\n\n18 Feb 1943 The first class of Army Nurse Corps flight nurses was graduated by the School of Air Evacuation at Bowman Field, Kentucky. The honor graduate who received the first flight wings was 2d Lt. Geraldine Dishroom. Since there was no official insignia, Brig. Gen. David Grant, Air Surgeon and guest speaker, unpinned his insignia and pinned it to her uniform. Lieutenant Dishroom was with the first air evacuation team to land on Omaha Beach after the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944. Second Lt. Dorothy Shikoski, the second Army nurse to receive the Air Medal and the first woman to receive the award in the South Pacific, was decorated for displaying heroism following a crash landing at sea during a severe storm in the South Pacific theater.\n\n30 Jun 1943 Col. Julia O. Flikke retired. Among her many contributions to Army nursing was the publication of her well-known book, Nurses in Action. Colonel Flikke was awarded an honorary degree as Doctor of Science by Wittenberg College in 1944.\n\n30 Jun 1943 There were 36,607 Army nurses on active duty.\n\n1 Jul 1943 Col. Florence A. Blanchfield became the seventh Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps.\n\n1 Jul 1943 Public Law 74, 78th Congress, established the United States Cadet Nurse Corps under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. After entering World War II, the United States was faced with a critical shortage of registered nurses nationwide. It was deemed more expedient and economical to strengthen the instructional staff and the facilities of existing civilian schools of nursing than to reinstitute the Army School of Nursing or start similar military hospital­based schools. Although the act was a defense measure, a precedent had been established-schools of nursing were given recognition as essential agencies in the protection of the nation's health. The total number who joined the Cadet Nurse Corps was 169,443. Of these, 124,065 were graduated from 1,125 of the nation's 1,300 schools of nursing. Senior Cadets served in federal or nonfederal hospitals or in other health agencies. By the end of the program, 17,475 Senior Cadets had served the federal government during the last six months of the program. The greatest number to graduate from a single school was 1,600 cadets from the University of Minnesota School of Nursing. Recruitment terminated on 15 October 1945, and the last cadets graduated in 1948. Federal funds provided for maintenance of the students the first 9 months, for tuition fees throughout the program, and for necessary expansion of educational and residential facilities. Cadets were provided free uniforms and a monthly stipend which ranged from $15 a month for the first 9 months as a pre-Cadet, $30 a month for the next 21 months as a Junior Cadet, and from $30 to $60 a month during the last 6 months as a Senior Cadet.\n\n15\n\nThe Cadet Nurse Corps was composed of student trainees and was not a branch of the armed forces or of the civilian personnel force of the United States government. The training and experience did not constitute federal service, and therefore no veterans' benefits accrued. The Corps pledge was a statement of good intentions rather than a legal contract:\n\n\"In consideration of the training, payments, and other benefits which are provided me as a member of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, I agree that I will be available for military or other Federal, governmental, or essential civilian services for the duration of the present war.\"\n\nThe service of thousands of cadets is still on the record as an exceptionally valuable contribution to the United States during and following World War II.\n\n19 Jul 1943 The first basic training centers, established to provide military orientation for Army nurses before their first duty assignment, were formally opened at Fort Devens, Massachusetts; Fort Sam Houston, Texas; and Camp McCoy, Wisconsin. The nurses were oriented to military nursing and other subjects, such as how to prepare for gas injuries, bivouac in the field, seek foxholes for cover, and purify water. In 1946, an eight-week orientation program for all newly commissioned officers was established at the Medical Field Service School, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The nurses were oriented to military customs and other subjects, such as military medical, surgical, and psychiatric techniques; preventive medicine; supply and tactical information; and administration, including ward management.\n\n8 Nov 1943 A plane carrying thirteen nurses and seventeen others crash landed in Albania. After more than six weeks behind German lines, courageous underground partisans helped all thirty Americans escape from Nazi-held territory.\n\n27 Jan 1944 Army nurses waded ashore on Anzio beachhead in Italy five days after troop landings on 22 January 1944. Six Army nurses lost their lives during enemy bombing attacks in early February.\n\n10 Jun 1944 Four days after the Normandy invasion, nurses of the 42d and 45th Field Hospitals and the 91st and 128th Evacuation Hospitals arrived in Normandy.\n\n22 Jun 1944 Public Law 350, 78th Congress, granted Army nurses temporary commissions in the Army of the United States, with full pay and privileges of the grades from second lieutenant through colonel, for the duration of the emergency plus six months.\n\n16\n\n9 Jul 1944 Gardiner General Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, was dedicated to the memory of 2d Lt. Ruth M. Gardiner, the first Army nurse to be killed in a theater of operations during World War II. Lieutenant Gardiner, a flight nurse, was killed in a plane crash near Naknek, Alaska, on 27 July 1943, while on an air evacuation mission.\n\n27 Sep 1944 Lt. Reba Z. Whittle of the 813th Medical Air Evacuation Transport Squadron became a prisoner of the Germans after the plane in which she was flying during an evacuation mission was shot down over Aachen.\n\n6 Jan 1945 Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson recommended to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that women nurses be drafted for the armed forces. The President proposed such legislation in his State of the Union Message. The House of Representatives passed a draft bill on 7 March 1945, but the Senate had not acted upon it before victory in Europe on 8 May 1945. The War Department notified the Senate on 24 May 1945 that legislation would not be necessary since an adequate number of nurses had volunteered to meet the anticipated needs of the war in the Pacific. No further action was taken.\n\n28 Apr 1945 Six Army nurses and five Army medical officers were among some twenty-nine people killed when the hospital ship Comfort, loaded to capacity with wounded being evacuated from Okinawa, was attacked by a Japanese \"suicide\" plane.\n\n8 May 1945 Victory in Europe. V­E Day was proclaimed on 8 May after the enemy forces surrendered on 7 May 1945. When the war in Europe ended there were more than fifty-two thousand Army nurses on active duty serving in 605 hospitals overseas and 454 hospitals in the United States.\n\nSep 1945 Following World War II, Army nurses became eligible for all veterans' benefits. Many former Army nurses attended colleges and universities in the postwar period under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the \"G.I. Bill of Rights.\"\n\n2 Sep 1945 Victory in Japan. V­J Day was proclaimed on 2 September to celebrate Japan's acceptance of unconditional surrender terms on 14 August 1945. The Army Nurse Corps had reached a peak strength of more than fifty-seven thousand in August 1945.\n\nIn World War II, 201 Army nurses died, 16 as a result of enemy action. More than sixteen hundred nurses were decorated for meritorious service and bravery under fire. Decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, Soldier's Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, Legion of Merit, Army Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n\n17\n\nFive hospital ships and one general hospital used during the war were named after Army nurses who lost their lives in service during World War II. Army nurses served at station and general hospitals throughout the continental United States. Overseas, they were assigned to hospital ships, flying ambulances, and hospital trains; to clearing stations; and to field, evacuation, and general hospitals. They served on beachheads from North Africa to Normandy and Anzio, in the Aleutians, Wales, Australia, Trinidad, India, Ireland, England, the Solomons, Newfoundland, Guam, Hawaii, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Puerto Rico, Panama, Iceland, Bataan, and Corregidor-wherever the American soldier could be found. They traveled in close support of the fighting men, endured relentless bombing and strafing on land, torpedoing at sea, and antiaircraft fire while evacuating the wounded by air. In Europe, during the major battle offensives, Army nurses assisted in developing the concept of recovery wards for immediate postoperative nursing care of patients. The flight nurses helped to establish the incredible record of only five deaths in flight per 100,000 patients transported.\n\nLt. Frances Y. Slanger, in her tent in Belgium, far from home in Roxbury, Massachusetts, was one of the Army nurses who signed a letter written to Stars and Stripes:\n\n\"Sure we rough it. But compared to the way you men are taking it we can't complain, nor do we feel that bouquets are due us . . . it is to you we doff our helmets. To every G.I. wearing the American uniform-for you we have the greatest admiration and\n\nrespect.\"\n\nSeventeen days later, on 21 October 1944, Lieutenant Slanger died of wounds caused by the shelling of her tented hospital area. Through the same newspaper, hundreds of soldiers replied:\n\n\"To all Army nurses overseas: We men were not given the choice of working in the battlefield or the home front. We cannot take any credit for being here. We are here because we have to be. You are here because you felt you were needed. So, when an injured man opens his eyes to see one of you . . . concerned with his welfare, he can't but be overcome by the very thought that you are doing it because you want to . . . you endure whatever hardships you must to be where you can do us the most good.\"\n\n31 Dec 1945 There were 27,850 Army nurses on active duty.\n\n1946 During the occupation of Japan, Maj. Grace E. Alt organized a Nursing Education Council in Japan. Army nurses offered refresher courses to nurses\n\n18\n\nand to nurse instructors of Japanese schools of nursing. Major Alt also helped to train Japanese nurses for public health work during the postwar period.\n\n15 Jun 1946 A 26-week course in psychiatric nursing was introduced at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. This course marked the beginning of Army-wide education in clinical nursing practice. Training in clinical nursing procedures had been conducted to meet the Army's needs during World War II, but this 26-week course included 230 hours of formal classroom instruction at the Medical Field Service School and 580 hours of practicum with clinical demonstration at Brooke General Hospital. Several Army nurses were also selected to attend a similar course in psychiatric nursing at the St. Elizabeth Hospital, Washington, D.C.\n\n30 Sep 1946 A year after the end of World War II, approximately eighty-five hundred nurses remained in the Army Nurse Corps.\n\n16 Apr 1947 Public Law 36, 80th Congress, established the Army Nurse Corps in the Medical Department of the Regular Army and authorized a strength of not less than 2,558 nurses. The Army-Navy Nurse Act of 1947 also provided permanent commissioned officer status for members of the Army Nurse Corps in the grades of second lieutenant through lieutenant colonel, and for the Chief of the Army Nurse Corps to serve in the temporary grade of colonel. The act also established the Army Nurse Corps Section of the Officers' Reserve Corps.\n\nArmy nurses on active duty who held Regular relative rank in the Army Nurse Corps as well as a temporary commission were appointed in an appropriate permanent grade but continued to serve in their temporary grade if the latter was higher. Reserve nurses, on either active or inactive status, who met the qualifications for Regular Army appointment were given the opportunity to apply. A total of 894 Army Nurse Corps officers were integrated into the Regular Army.\n\n11 Jun 1947 Lt. Col. Ida W. Danielson was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal by the International Red Cross in recognition of her work as Director of Nurses, European Theater of Operations, from February 1944 through October 1945.\n\n19 Jun 1947 Col. Florence A. Blanchfield, Chief of the Army Nurse Corps, was given United States Army serial number N­1 and commissioned in the permanent grade of lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army. She thus became the first woman to hold a permanent commission in the United States Army. As Chief of the Army Nurse Corps, she continued to serve in the temporary grade of colonel.\n\n19\n\n1 Jul 1947 A 56-week course in anesthesiology for nurses was started at four hospitals: Brooke General Hospital, Fort Sam Houston, Texas; Fitzsimons General Hospital, Denver, Colorado; Letterman General Hospital, San Francisco, California; and Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington, D.C. Forty weeks of this 56-week course were spent in an Army hospital and eight weeks in an approved civilian hospital for clinical experience with types of anesthesia not commonly used in Army hospitals. The first course included 359 hours of lecture, not less than 375 cases, and not less than 375 hours of actual administration of anesthesia. Upon graduation, the nurse was qualified to take the examination prepared by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. Certification was granted upon successful completion of the examination.\n\n21 Jul 1947 The first course in operating room technique and management for nurses (later changed to operating room nursing and administration) to prepare for Army certification as an operating room specialist was introduced at two hospitals: Letterman General Hospital, San Francisco, California, and Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington, D.C. The course at Walter Reed was affiliated with the School of Nursing, The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. This 24-week course included 155 hours of classroom instruction and 668 hours of supervised clinical practice.\n\n30 Sep 1947 Col. Florence A. Blanchfield, Chief of the Army Nurse Corps, retired after more than twenty-nine years of active service. The Army awarded her the Distinguished Service Medal on 14 June 1945 for her leadership of the Corps during World War II. Colonel Blanchfield received many honors including the Florence Nightingale Medal, awarded by the International Red Cross on 12 May 1951, and the Distinguished Service Medal from her native state of West Virginia on 19 July 1963.\n\n1 Oct 1947 Col. Mary G. Phillips became the eighth Chief of the Army Nurse Corps. Colonel Phillips was the first graduate of the Army School of Nursing to serve as Chief of the Corps.\n\n10 Nov 1947 For the first time, Army nurses attended the course in hospital administration at the Army Medical Field Service School. A graduate-level program was started in 1951. Through an affiliation with Baylor University, the first master of hospital administration degrees were awarded to Army Medical Department officers in 1953. The program has since become the U.S. Army­Baylor University graduate program in health care administration. The two-year program includes a didactic year at the Academy of Health Sciences, U.S. Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, followed by a residency year, under the direction of an approved preceptor, at an Army hospital. Upon successful completion of the program, a master of hospital administration degree is conferred by Baylor University, Waco, Texas.\n\n20\n\n31 Dec 1947 Army Nurse Corps strength was 4,859: Regular Army, 925; reserve officers on active duty, 3,934.\n\n9 Jun 1948 The first civilian nursing leaders were appointed as consultants to the Surgeon General for matters pertaining to Army nursing. They were: Katharine Densford (later Mrs. Dreves), Director, School of Nursing, University of Minnesota; Agnes Gelinas, Chairman, Department of Nursing, Skidmore College; Ella Best, Executive Secretary of the American Nurses' Association (ANA); and Lulu St. Clair Blaine, Executive Secretary, Michigan Nursing Center Association.\n\n28 Aug 1948 The five Army Nurse Corps officers to attend the first Medical Department Officers Advanced Course, Medical Field Service School, were Lt. Col. Ruby F. Bryant, Lt. Col. Pauline Kirby, Maj. Inez Haynes, Maj. Margaret Harper, and Capt. Harriet A. Dawley (Wells). Lieutenant Colonel Bryant, Major Haynes, and Major Harper later became Chiefs of the Army Nurse Corps. Captain Dawley (Wells) later became Assistant Chief of the Corps. In 1956, Lieutenant Colonel Kirby was promoted to the temporary grade of colonel. She was one of the first two Army Nurse Corps officers, other than the Chief of the Corps, to serve in the temporary grade of colonel.\n\n1949 Reserve nurses on active or inactive duty were authorized and encouraged to take extension courses, on their own time, in technical or administrative procedures. Reserve nurses not on active duty could request assignment for training purposes to reserve units near their homes to maintain proficiency in nursing practice related to the latest advances in military medicine.\n\n1 Feb 1949 The first Army Health Nurse Program was established at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, to provide public health nursing services to the military community.\n\nJul 1949 The role of the Nursing Methods Analyst in Army hospitals began to evolve after Executive Order 10072 was issued in July 1949. Following World War II, the Hoover Commission was appointed to study the organization and administration of the various federal agencies. In its report to Congress, the commission outlined the need for all agencies to study their efficiency and economy of operation. By Executive Order 10072, the President of the United States directed all departmental and agency heads to give attention to the organization and administration of their departments.\n\nIn October 1949, Congress passed Public Law 429. This law established in all the federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the legal basis for a comprehensive and continuing program of management improvement.\n\n21\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget was charged with the responsibility of coordinating the program. The Secretary of the Army established the management program at the Department of the Army level.\n\nIn the Office of the Surgeon General, the program was developed in the Medical Plans and Operations Division and was called the Management Research and Planning Branch. As early as 1946, a management research group had already been appointed in the Office of the Surgeon General and assigned to do research in the field of hospital operations.\n\nIn 1949, Valley Forge General Hospital was selected as the Army hospital where pilot projects to improve hospital organization and administration would be conducted. Lt. Col. Daisy M. McCommons was Chief Nurse. (In 1950, she was assigned to the Management Research and Planning Branch, Office of the Surgeon General.) Lt. Col. Arthur Stout, MSC, was Chief of the Management Office at Valley Forge Hospital. The first Army nurses assigned to the hospital management program were Capt. Robena Anderson and 1st Lt. Eileen L. McCarthy. They were joined a few months later by Capt. Ann Witczak.\n\nThe objective of the first survey was to determine standards of staffing for nursing service in Army hospitals through use of the nursing team. The initial study, formally conducted from January to June 1950, was interrupted because the Secretary of Defense ordered the hospital closed by 30 June 1950 as an economy measure. The hospital was reopened during the Korean War, and management nurses were assigned to resume management studies at Valley Forge and to continue at other Army hospitals.\n\nIn 1950, the management office in Army hospitals was established as a fact-finding, planning, advisory, and control agency, on the authority of Surgeon General's Office Circular 119 and Special Regulations (SR) No. 40­610­5. The management nurse was included in the management office. The title changed variously until 1959 from Management Nurse, to Nursing Management Nurse, to Nursing Methods Analyst (NMA).\n\nBy mid-1975, nursing methods analysts were assigned to Army medical centers and general hospitals throughout the Health Services Command. For more than twenty-five years, nursing methods analysts have been a part of the Army medical team charged with the responsibility for patient care planning, manpower utilization, facilities planning, and supplies and equipment requirements. They have made many lasting contributions to the Army Medical Department. For example, centralization of the food service in Army hospitals came into being as a result of one of the utilization studies conducted by nursing methods analysts. Another significant contribution, resulting from a study conducted from 1951 to 1955 in eight Army hospitals, was \"categori-\n\n22\n\nzation of patients according to nursing care needs\"-a standard for determining staffing requirements for nursing personnel in Army hospitals and a forerunner of the progressive patient care concept of intensive, moderate, minimal, and supportive care.\n\n1 Jul 1949 The Air Force Nurse Corps was established. A total of 1,199 Army nurses on active duty (307 regular and 892 reserve officers) transferred from the Army to the Air Force and formed the nucleus of its Nurse Corps.\n\n17 Oct 1949 A 48-week pilot course of instruction for enlisted personnel on the practical nurse level was started at the Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C. (later renamed the Walter Reed Army Medical Center). The program was similar to the one-year program for practical nurses at the University of Minnesota. The Army program was the forerunner of the Medical Technician Procedure Advanced Course. The director and faculty members were Army Nurse Corps officers. Additional schools, under the direction of Army Nurse Corps officers, were established as required to meet patient care needs of the Army Medical Service. The course was retitled the Medical Specialist (Advanced) Course and, later, the Clinical Specialist Course.\n\n25 Jun 1950 Capt. Viola B. McConnell was the only Army nurse on duty in Korea at the start of hostilities. Assigned to the United States Military Advisory Group to the Republic of Korea, Captain McConnell escorted nearly seven hundred American evacuees, mostly women and children, from besieged Seoul to Japan aboard the Norwegian freighter Rheinhold, a ship which normally had accommodations for only twelve passengers. The crew members gave up their quarters for the infants and children. Captain McConnell assessed priorities for care of the evacuees and worked with a medical team organized from the passengers, including one United Nations nurse, one Army wife (a registered nurse), six missionary nurses, and one medical missionary (a woman doctor described by Captain McConnell as \"magnificent-and she worked long hours. . . we will be ever grateful to her for her assistance\"). Captain McConnell requested assignment back to Korea from Japan. She later returned to Taejon to aid in the care and evacuation of the wounded men of the 24th Division. Captain McConnell was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for her heroic performance of duty in assisting with the evacuation of Americans from Seoul and, later, the Oak Leaf Cluster to the Bronze Star Medal for her outstanding service in Korea.\n\n27 Jun 1950 President Harry S. Truman ordered U.S. air and naval forces into the Republic of Korea (South Korea).\n\n1 Jul 1950 The first U.S. Army combat units landed in Korea after U.S. ground forces were ordered into the fighting in South Korea on 30 June 1950.\n\n23\n\n5 Jul 1950 Fifty-seven Army nurses arrived in Pusan, Korea. They helped set up a hospital and were caring for patients by the following day. Two days later, on 8 July 1950, twelve Army nurses moved forward with a mobile Army surgical hospital (MASH) to Taejon on the perimeter. By August, more than one hundred Army nurses were on duty in South Korea in support of United Nations troops. During the first year of the Korean conflict, the strength of the Army Nurse Corps increased from 3,460 on 15 July 1950 to 5,397 in July 1951.\n\nThroughout the ground fighting until 1951, and during the prolonged peace negotiations that lasted until 27 July 1953, approximately 540 Army Nurse Corps officers served throughout the Korean peninsula. They served in twenty-five medical treatment facilities, such as mobile Army surgical hospitals; evacuation, field, and station hospitals; and hospital trains.\n\nArmy nurses supported combat troops during the amphibious attack and landing on Inchon in western Korea, well behind the Pusan beachhead line; the advance across the 38th Parallel toward North Korea in the west; the amphibious landing on the east coast of Korea pushing toward the Yalu River, the northern boundary of Korea; and the disastrous defeat when they were forced to retreat well below the 38th Parallel. Their support continued as allied forces pushed back the Chinese, regaining practically all of South Korea plus a few hundred square miles north of the parallel. Maj. Gen. Edgar Erskine Hume, Surgeon, United Nations Command and Far East Command, paid tribute to Army nurses in Korea:\n\n\"Members of the Army Nurse Corps have all distinguished themselves by their devotion to duty, their utter disregard of working hours, and their willingness to do anything that needs to be done at any time. They have displayed courage, stamina and determination. They have completed every task with which they have been confronted in a superior manner.\"\n\nNo Army nurse was killed due to enemy action in Korea, but the story of the Army Nurse Corps in the Korean War would not be complete without mention of the tragic and untimely death of Maj. Genevieve Smith of Epworth, Iowa. Major Smith, a veteran of World War II, was among the victims of a C­47 crash while en route to her duty assignment as Chief Nurse in Korea.\n\nAug 1950 The Army Nurse Corps was exempted from the Army-wide requirement that all commissioned officers hold or achieve a baccalaureate degree. The majority of registered nurses nationwide were graduates of a three-year hospital (diploma) program. By August 1950, only two years had passed\n\nsince the last of 124,065 Cadet Nurse Corps participants had graduated.\n\n24\n\nRelatively few degree-completion programs were available for diploma graduates. Nonetheless, the goal set in 1950 was for Army Nurse Corps officers to complete an accredited program leading to an undergraduate degree, preferably in nursing.\n\n5 Sep 1950 The first course in nursing administration, which later became the Military Nursing Advanced Course, was established at the U.S. Army Medical Field Service School, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The twenty-week course included principles of nursing administration, current trends in nursing, principles of supervision and teaching, hospital organization and functions, personnel administration, psychology of leadership, and orientation to all departments of an Army hospital.\n\n1951 Maj. Elizabeth Pagels became the first Army Health Nurse to be assigned to the Preventive Medicine Division, Professional Service Directorate, Office of the Surgeon General, to assist with issues related to the practice of Army health nursing.\n\n2 Feb 1951 The fiftieth anniversary of the Army Nurse Corps was observed throughout the world.\n\n26 Jun 1951 The American Red Cross awarded the cherished Florence Nightingale Medal to Col. Florence A. Blanchfield (Ret.), seventh Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps, \"for exceptional service on behalf of humanity rendered through the Red Cross.\"\n\n29 Jun 1951 Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 750.04­1 (renumbered 1125.1) established a definitive policy on the utilization of registered nurses in the military services. Registered nurses were to be relieved of custodial and housekeeping duties and clerical, food service, and other nonnursing functions in patient care areas. The DOD directive also instructed the various military medical services to institute programs to train and utilize more practical nurses and other nonprofessional nursing service personnel in staffing for patient care.\n\nEven before the Department of Defense policy was established, plans were being developed and projects had been initiated under the aegis of management improvement which would work toward solving the problems of defining and staffing the nursing service. The studies ultimately resulted in the reorganization of nursing service in Army hospitals. Duties and functions of registered nurses were defined. A 48-week pilot course of instruction for enlisted personnel on the practical nurse level had already been instituted in 1949. On-the-job training programs were developed for both professional and nonprofessional nursing personnel. As a result of concerted efforts to comply with the DOD directive, Army Nurse Corps officers were authorized,\n\n25\n\nafter 8 September 1953, technical control of enlisted personnel assigned to nursing service.\n\n11 Aug 1951 The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) was established by the Secretary of Defense to interpret to the public the role of women in the services and to promote acceptance of military service as a career for women.\n\n30 Sep 1951 Col. Mary G. Phillips retired. Colonel Phillips was the first Chief of the Army Nurse Corps to complete the statutory four-year appointment as Chief of the Corps. Among the honors received by Colonel Phillips was the Legion of Merit on 23 October 1945 for her outstanding service as First Assistant to the Superintendent, Army Nurse Corps.\n\n1 Oct 1951 Col. Ruby F. Bryant became the ninth Chief of the Army Nurse Corps. Colonel Bryant was the second graduate of the Army School of Nursing to serve as Chief of the Corps.\n\nJun 1952 A career guidance program for Army Nurse Corps officers was established in the Office of the Surgeon General. Capt. Harriet H. Werley was assigned as the first career guidance counselor.\n\n30 Dec 1953 The Registered Nurse Student Program (RNSP) was established to recruit registered nurses for the Army Nurse Corps. The program provided financial assistance, pay, and allowances of grade in which commissioned to registered nurses in their final year of study for a bachelor's or master's degree in a field of nursing. Upon graduation, they were obligated to serve as reserve officers on active duty for two years. Grade in which commissioned, from second lieutenant through captain, depended on qualifications by education and experience. Authorization for men to apply for the program was approved on 20 November 1962.\n\n13 Feb 1954 The first two professional postgraduate short courses were\n\nestablished for nurses: one in operating room nursing at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C.; and one in nursing service administration at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\n31 Mar 1954 A Medical Training Center was established at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, to replace the training center for enlisted personnel of the Army Medical Service at Camp Pickett, Virginia, which was scheduled for closing in June 1954. Army nurses continued to serve on the faculty as full-time instructors.\n\n26\n\n14 Jan 1955 The Stimson Library at the U.S. Army Medical Field Service School, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, was dedicated to the memory of Col. Julia C. Stimson, fifth Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps. In January 1973, the Stimson Library was moved from the former Medical Field Service School to the new Academy of Health Sciences, U.S. Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nFeb 1955 A 22-week course in obstetrical nursing was started at Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington, D.C. The course was transferred to William Beaumont General Hospital, El Paso, Texas, in March 1959. It was expanded to include the concept of child health and retitled Maternal and Child Health Nursing. This course was discontinued in 1971.\n\n14 Feb 1955 Closed-circuit color television was used for the first time in Army nursing instruction when surgical procedures in the operating room at Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington, D.C., were transmitted to the Military Operating Room Workshop at the Army Medical Service Graduate School (later renamed the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C.\n\n12 May 1955 Thompson Hall was dedicated at Letterman General Hospital, San Francisco, California, in memory of Capt. Dora E. Thompson, fourth Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps. Miss Thompson had served as Chief Nurse at Letterman at the time of the 1906 earthquake and fire and, again, before her retirement in 1942.\n\n15 Jun 1955 Lt. Col. Ruby G. Bradley was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal by the International Red Cross for outstanding service when she was a prisoner of war of the Japanese during World War II and for her service in Korea. When she retired on 31 March 1963, Colonel Bradley received the third Oak Leaf Cluster to the Legion of Merit. She held the distinction of being the most decorated woman in the history of the United States Army. On 1 June 1964, Colonel Bradley was awarded an honorary degree as Doctor of Science by the University of West Virginia.\n\n9 Aug 1955 Public Law 294, 84th Congress, introduced by Mrs. Frances P. Bolton, Representative from Ohio, and signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, authorized commissions for male nurses in the U.S. Army Reserve for assignment to the Army Nurse Corps Branch. Mrs. Bolton had earlier introduced H.R. 911 on 4 January 1951 in an attempt to provide for the appointment of men as nurses in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.\n\n19 Aug 1955 Capt. Ruth Dickson was awarded the Associate Royal Red Cross by Her Britannic Majesty's government. The decoration, comparable to the\n\n27\n\nAmerican Distinguished Service Cross, was awarded to Captain Dickson for her service to British Commonwealth Forces in Korea while she served as Chief Nurse of the 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH).\n\n30 Sep 1955 Col. Ruby F. Bryant, upon completion of the statutory four-year term as Chief of the Army Nurse Corps, reverted, by law, to her permanent grade of lieutenant colonel (until after Public Law 85­155 was passed by Congress on 13 August 1957) and was assigned as Chief, Nursing Service, Medical Division, Europe. She later served as Director, Nursing Activities, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, until she retired on 30 June 1961. Colonel Bryant was the recipient of many honors, including the Legion of Merit awarded upon retirement.
