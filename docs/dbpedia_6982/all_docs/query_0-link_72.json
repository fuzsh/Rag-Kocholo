        "text": "The 62nd Berlin International Film Festival\n\nBy Leslie Weisman, DC Film Society Member\n\nFriedrichstadt-Palast. Photo from the Berlin International Film Festival website.\n\nWhere do shrieking, star-seeking, teeny-bopper (and middle-aged) film fans; sober, quality-seeking cinephiles, and movie lovers of all stripes flock by the hundreds of thousands on one of the coldest months of the year, in one of the coldest cities on the continent? If its February, it must be the Berlinale, shorthand for the Berlin International Film Festival, which this year saw 24-hour campouts on the frigid streets of Potsdamer Platz as anxious, red-cheeked, thermos-clutching admirers awaited the arrival of their Twilight star.\n\nAnd they were not alone. A hardy contingent in the hundreds braved the Arctic chill to line up hours before opening to pack the opulent 1,750-seat Friedrichstadt-Palast almost past capacity, where a Bollywood giant had braved a chill (and fever) of his own to be there for them  and to challenge the fests grey-haired and -mustachioed director to a few Indian dance steps complete with headstands as they cheered.\n\nAnd superstar actresses? Never let it be said that said director, Dieter Kosslick, who in his nine years in the position (and counting; during the fest, it was announced that his contract has been extended to 2016) has hosted the most acclaimed and talented with a blend of disarming artlessness, astuteness and charm, isnt also prescient. Just days after squiring one of them around town with conspicuous delight and honoring her with the fests most prestigious award, for Lifetime Achievement, he must have noted with special satisfaction as, across the ocean before a viewership of nearly 40 million, she received Hollywoods highest acting honor  and with the same honesty, grace and humor that endeared her to Berlin.\n\nBut back to the festival, where a glittering present and future joined hands with a distant past as the fest paid tribute to a lost  and now rediscovered  film studio, with screenings of dozens of its films. And celebrated the 100th birthday of another, the worlds oldest large-scale film studio complex, where Kosslick would award it the coveted Berlinale Camera (its name both figurative and literal, with 128 individual silver and titanium parts, many of them moveable), in a special ceremony attended by the citys political and cultural elite and hundreds of invited guests.\n\nThe cinematic glory of both of these studios sometimes stood in sharp contrast to the mortal darkness of the regimes that, for all or just a small, but indelible part of their respective histories, ruled the people and lands that seeded and nourished their dreams. Lest this thought occasion among viewers a sense of superiority over our ignorant or ignoble (take your pick) forbears, they didnt have to go far to find among the fests offerings films portraying a host of contemporary examples of mans senseless determination to destroy the other. Including one whose raven-haired director/screenwriter (and one of Hollywoods most beauteous and glamorous screen sirens and committed peace activists) found herself the object of fan frenzy, her film the subject of alternately admiring, questioning, dismissive or angrily challenging commentary.\n\nNot to worry: My film is rough, its difficult, she told a local paper. Moviegoers want to have a good time. [Note: Translations from German or French are this writers. In cases such as this, where the speakers words were translated from English for publication in the local media, they reflect her best guess as to the original wording.] And showing she knows what that means for the smaller set (and leaving the locals agog), took three of her kids shopping for toys at the local Legoland, just steps from the towering enameled giraffe smiling down from Potsdamer Straße. Recalling for at least this filmgoer  who on occasion over the years, in her rush to get to the next screening, couldnt resist returning a quick grin  the flesh-and-blood giraffes featured in both a Forum film and a Competition film. The formers fate recalled the aforementioned darkness; the latters, by comparison, suggested a gentle, melancholy dimness, tempered by human warmth and companionship.\n\nWhich were sometimes  human nature being what it is  in conspicuously short supply for humans, at least onscreen. On the streets the crowds, which this year again broke previous records, surpassing the 300,000-tickets-sold mark and selling out many of the fests complement of some 400 films (including a record-setting 18 world premieres) were on the whole conspicuously well behaved. When they werent, their lapses were wryly addressed with okay-folks-you-know-better reminders, as when the Tagesspiegel (Daily Mirror) felt obliged to offer a 2\" x 3\", bottom-center, cherry-red illustrated lexicon for filmgoers who hadnt gotten the memo:\n\ncough|drops (n)\n\nCough- and irritation-soothing drops with phlegm-relieving substances.\n\nIndispensable for all festival visitors.\n\nPlease unwrap quietly.\n\nIt closed with a familiar phrase that as used here, could be an expression of either impatience or appeasement:\n\nGet well soon!\n\nA command that could have brought a wry smile to the frozen faces of dedicated journos lining up each morning in the frigid February air for their required daily dose of early morning screenings. But how we warmed up once inside, having snagged a prime location in the Berlinale Palast with its 1,800 cushioned fire-engine-red seats, where we settled in for a few hours of fiction, fantasy, or fantastical  or formidable  reality.\n\nOf course, for better or for worse, coughs and colds are no more amenable to orders or appeals than the people who have them  indeed, if historys any guide, when an appeal is to reason or to our better nature, for worse appears to have a better, or at least more successful appeal. A sobering thought, because at least in theory, unlike with those intractable infections, people have some control over their choices. And this years Berlinale  true to its own history and reputation as the most political of international film festivals  explored the ways in which those choices can not just change individual lives, but challenge the pernicious political regimes that seek to subjugate them.\n\nFrom todays Arab Spring, to the Communist East of the eighties; from seasoned and sophisticated works from the masters posing some of todays most compelling questions, to vibrant new voices of the Talents seeking to at once learn from them and take them on; from Dieter Kosslicks climate-conscious (and detailed) description of how this year, the fests CO2 balance would be even better, to the Forum section directors declaration that whats known as the most daring section of the Berlinale had redefined itself as even more radical, Berlinale 2012 wrote a new script for political engagement while dexterously maintaining the fests signature balance between art and commerce.\n\nWhere to begin? Perhaps with the most immediate: the Arab Spring, represented this year by 10 feature films and documentaries (with an additional 10 at the fests business center, the European Film Market), plus absorbing panel discussions with journalists, activists and filmmakers. At the Talent Campus, the focus was on contemporary video art from Lebanon, the Arab world defining its future, and the city of Cairo, its images and archives. And World Cinema Fund Day, at the multifunctional, capacious Filmhaus at Potsdamer Platz, offered a penetrating dialogue on the situation in Syria and what its like to be on the ground documenting revolution in Arab lands.\n\nIntroducing the seminar in his well-intentioned, inimitably fractured English, Kosslick lauded the Fund (We would have invented the World Cinema Fund if we wouldnt havent had it), immediately endearing him to any who have struggled with German grammar. He then expressed regret that the foreign minister could not be there because he was with Meryl Streep last night. No, not alone, he added quickly, with a laugh. I was there, too.\n\nFestival director Dieter Kosslick with film crew. Photo from the Berlin International Film Festival website.\n\nThen he grew serious. The poor people have to fight against the rich guys because the rich become more and more rich and the poor become more and more poor, he told the packed room, adding that Europeans need to stop the name-calling and work together for the common good. We need to make sure the banks dont run the world. Culture must prevail, he told us, a quiet sense of urgency informing his words. And you and I must help it happen.\n\nYes, but how? On the Focus Syria panel, filmmaker/journalist Mohamed Ali Atassi (Syria/Lebanon) sounded a guardedly optimistic note. The Syrian people will not give up, he told us; their revolt will result in freedom. But the celebrated man-with-a cellphone news coverage, instead of helping gain international sympathy, may be having an unintended distancing effect. Because theres no BBC or CNN, he continued, the activists documenting the events are a part of them and sometimes victims of them, thereby losing the objectivity at the heart of convincing, believable news coverage. He also hypothesized that a largely white audience would fail to identify with non-white narrators and tend to see the horrors as something happening to people who have no connection to them without a white reporter to act as conduit.\n\nHe was especially dismissive of what he saw as the deceptive so-called power of YouTube, in which people watching slaughter unfold before their eyes believe that as they are watching, so is the world, and so something will surely be done. (It was hard for this reporter to keep from raising her hand to remind him of historys hard lessons: The world can know, and not care; can look, and not see. Perhaps he knows, and is hoping  as they all did  that this time will be different.)\n\nFilm journalist Alaa Karkouti (Syria/Egypt) noted that in the tinderbox that is the Middle East, Western governments have come to see Syria as the good guy because its relations with Israel have not been as unrelievedly hostile as have those of other Arab states. Its people believing in the [Assad] regime, and thats the scary part, he said. The only anti-regime broadcast channel is owned by Assads brother, who is in exile. Karkouti closed with a chilling observation. Im scared and Im out of the country, so imagine how the people there feel.\n\nFilmmaker, producer and film activist Hala Al Alabdallah (Syria/France) emphasized the historic uniqueness of the Arab Spring, which in any event is a misnomer, at least when applied to Syria: Its true there was an Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen  but in Syria there was a revolution. Its something thats never happened before in history. And the films that have resulted, whatever they may be for anyone else, for her are first and foremost auteur films. Its the author who transmits what hes seen, what hes felt, what hes lived, using YouTube as a vehicle. Calling the result jewels, Al Alabdallah told us: These people risk their lives to shoot these films.\n\nPeople think of Syria as having slept for more than 40 years and never expected it to awaken, the desert to bloom, she continued, using visual imagery to make the passion she so clearly felt come to life for her listeners. All these years of waiting ... its like a volcano erupting, with new means of communicating, of creating, of meeting with people from everywhere. Shifting paradigms, she said: Its poetry, adding: For me, a poetic film is one that shows the strength of freedom.\n\nAtassi, perhaps renewed by Al Alabdallahs emotional testimony, recalled the day when, As a political journalist, I felt that suddenly, writing wasnt enough. So I enlisted Hala to document a resister who was in prison for 17 years, which became the linchpin for his own filmmaking career. Putting a different spin on the question of authorship, Atassi said that today, Syrian filmmakers are making their own documentaries inside the revolution, finding a new way of making documentaries without an author, because we dont know who made them.\n\nFilmmakers such as himself are trying to show not the demonstrations, but the background of the revolution, much of it without financial support. Unlike in the case of the YouTube films, here the filmmaker is not risking his life; he wants to make a film that he can take back and develop. The images are much better, too, he noted.\n\nThe development of a film culture in Syria is singular in other ways, said Karkouti. There was never a film culture in Syria, but only corrupt regimes throughout the Arab world supported by the United States and Europe, their acts of injustice and violence against minorities largely ignored. Karkouti urged us to not lose sight of the bigger picture. Every case is different, but its all related to human justice. In Yemen, there was an agora, or public forum; this never happened in Syria, because the Army moved in to crush the first sign of resistance. Today, people are trying to create their own collective spirit to face their own collective fear, turning events such as public funerals into acts of resistance.\n\nAl Abdallah recalled offering to make a film about the art of caricature in the Arab world  what many might call a curious choice after the attempted murder of a Danish cartoonist who drew caricatures of the prophet Mohammed, and the conviction a few years later of a man involved in a plot to kill another; but one thing these filmmakers do not lack is courage  and being told upon submitting her screenplay that there was a problem. No, it wasnt the Mohammed issue; rather, there was a law prohibiting the publication of drawings without captions. Why? Because people might write their own. It may be here, in this quickly interjected sidebar, that the core of the argument lay. It is not military might that dictators fear most, but the power of the imagination, the ability of people to think for themselves.\n\nAnd now, the questions. How do you see the future? Karkouti was unequivocal: Scary. While theres the Internet, the paradox is that its very freedom makes it subject to manipulation. Karkouti was more sanguine about Tunisia (which has more open-minded people) than Egypt, where just the day before there had been a call in a local paper for the head of the leader of the Moslem Brotherhood, where free elections didnt necessarily mean clean elections, and where Western support in the past has meant the survival of dirty regimes and dictatorships.\n\nAl Abdallah was encouraged by a short video on YouTube by the Alawite actress Fadwa Soleiman, in which she makes inventive use of the religious extremists own words to create a secular vow. In the name of God almighty, she proclaims, I hereby declare that Syria will unite, and we will rebuild our secular democratic state of Syria.\n\nAsked about the danger of extremist Islamist parties recent electoral successes, Atassi said he wasnt worried. People are demanding dignity and liberty, and if [these parties] dont bring it, they will be thrown out, too. The people, he said, will no longer accept what they risked their lives to get rid of. Karkouti was more wary, saying he has already observed signs of repression. For Al Abdallah, what we need is not bombs or arms, but more communication and more solidarity with the normal people  who are living through it in Syria.\n\nResponding to a Palestinian journalist who expressed strong doubts about the future of Arab film, Al Abdallah suggested Skype as a viable alternative when other forms of communication are being suppressed. We call the cinema revolution the Skype revolution. With Skype they vote, they communicate.\n\nBreak time came accompanied by a scrumptious buffet of Arabic and international delicacies, including trays of strawberries on steroids, each a rich, vibrant red and measuring, on average, approximately 2\" x 4\". Seeking to be able to inform DCFS readers of the name of the exquisite coffee, appearing in small white bowls on the tables in powder form but looking like the most decadent fudge, I inquired of the handsome olive-skinned young man serving it and handed him my notebook, sure that I would never be able to adequately approximate even a transliterated spelling. Agreeably taking my pen, he wrote slowly in a firm, elegant hand, which I noted as I took the pad back, laughing as I read: Arabic Koffee. Musing on the ever-shifting tides of cultural identification in countries where choice does not come at a deadly cost, I sat down for the next panel.\n\nDocumenting Revolution featured producer and festival organizer Hania Mroué (Lebanon); filmmaker Nadia El Fani (Tunisia/France); filmmaker and producer Hala Galal (Egypt); and journalist, activist and blogger Nora Younis (Egypt). Galal (whose documentary films, according to the European Cultural Foundation, have marked the Egyptian audiovisual landscape) explained that she has been too deeply affected by whats happened in her country to make her own film, but others who can, must. We dont want to rest in peace, she told us, because we want the world to be able to rest in peace. Galal is working on a film, but does not know if shell ever be able to shoot it. What I saw was more than terrible, perhaps more than she would be able to manage emotionally.\n\nFor Galal, the YouTube and Twitter postings not only attest to a very underground movement but prove that everybody who has a mobile can document some small part of the revolution, their postings constituting an open invitation to everybody to make films. Galal dislikes labels  activist, revolution, Arab Spring  Its more like winter, like International Winter. And the protests and protesters wont go away. Its a style of life now; its a choice to be against every injustice, now and forever. Its not about nationalism, she said. Its about justice everywhere.\n\nYouniss remarks opened a new window on the obstacles facing young filmmakers in Egypt, and in so doing, opened her listeners eyes to a world in which the obverse of what the Berlinale celebrates each year was the formers unhappy lot: not artistic expression, but artistic repression. And on every level: You felt that you were rejected by the society. But the success of the demonstrators has had an unexpected benefit, opening their fellow countrymens hearts and minds to the possibility of change. Now, everyone was accepted. The average Egyptian citizen, veiled women, were standing against the Moslem Brotherhood, Younis told us proudly. Egyptian society today is very alive.\n\nEl Fani, whose Neither Allah, nor Master (Ni Allah Ni Maître) was both honored by the International Federation for Human Rights and denounced by demonstrators infuriated by the films criticism and unequivocal renunciation of religion, was encouraged by Tunisias tradition of secularism, but still had to lie about the title and subject of her film to get it made. As quite an active activist a half-year before President Ben Ali was forced to leave, El Fani had already been uploading films to the Web.\n\nMroué, like Galal, told us that she was still too emotional about events in her country to make a film about them; that she doesnt yet have the distance. We need time to ourselves to process what happened, what in fact is happening as we speak. More comfortable with the word than Galal, Mroué declared that there are several revolutions, each unique to its country. She also was reluctant to call the YouTube uploads films. They are important documentations, but Im not sure theyre films.\n\nFor her part, your reviewer was reluctant to leave, but a film beckoned. And not just any film but one for which, as it turned out, the line wound down the long hallway and was still filling with hopeful ticket holders 15 minutes before its scheduled start, despite there being two additional screenings. What was this apparent box office bonanza?\n\nLets just say that if anyone is skeptical that the fests signature political engagement reflects that of its audiences, the enthusiasm for Democracy Under Attack - An Intervention (Angriff auf die Demokratie  eine Intervention; Romuald Karmakar, Germany 2012) would erase any doubts. On the surface the driest of documentaries, what it is, is not even that. What it is, is 102 minutes of talking heads in business suits (with occasional colorful interruptions of goats on the green, inspiring the Tagesspiegel to title its review Of Goals and Goats  whose alliteration and rhyming first syllables work in the original German too: Von Zielen und Ziegen). Each takes his or her ten-minute turn at the podium to deplore the current state of Western democracy in the wake of, and for some, in no small part because of, the financial crisis and the failure of the Western democracies to either prevent it or, once it hit, to protect the poor and the middle class rather than what has come to be called the 1 percent.\n\nComing on the heels of the previous sessions panelists moving testimonies to democracy, its importance and power, and to the high cost so many have paid and continue to pay to achieve it for themselves and their fellow countrymen and -women, Democracy Under Attack hit like an unwelcome, but perhaps needed, splash of cold water. Filmed (the lecture part) at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, or House of World Cultures, just weeks before the festival, calling it a film may be something of an exaggeration.\n\nKarmakars montage film (his preferred term) employs found footage from the symposium and combines it with an insert of his own: the pastoral goats who, one by one, slowly meander up the grassy hillside, eventually gathering in what Karmakar calls Elliott Waves, after the Elliott Wave Principle used by traders to analyze market cycles and predict trends. The speakers, German intellectuals from various disciplines, including a journalist and political theorist, a broadcasting and newspaper editor, a novelist and short-story writer, and others in the teaching and writing professions, approach the crisis with varying degrees of anger, humor, or attempts at neutral analysis.\n\nThe first two speakers are bitter because the EU was created without consulting its citizens, resulting in parliaments that are little more than ciphers. Merkel put the power in the hands of the banks, asserts one, and the banks, through their financial shenanigans, destroyed people who depended on the money invested in them. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer, with the poorer nations spending their hard-earned euros to purchase expensive goods from the richer ones.\n\nAnd some of those goods arent even any good, says the next speaker. One day there will probably be a course on marketing yourself as a politician, observes the next. Sloganeering has taken over everything. Like the politician, he added with some bitterness, who told his constituents after 9/11, Show them youre not afraid. Go shopping. Go to restaurants. Meanwhile, ads became political, urging consumers to seize the moment. The time is now. And pushing a product that would help you do it.\n\nAnd democracy? Sacrificed, is the general consensus, on the altar of political expediency.\n\nYou need to be for something, the next speaker quotes President Clinton telling David Letterman, referring to the Occupy Wall Street protesters, not just against something. Karmakar arguably agrees, and his film, in the voices of nine thinkers, writers and philosophers, makes an appeal for an intervention. But how? And by whom?\n\nFor the Tagesspiegels dependably irrepressible Martenstein, the answer was clear. In the course of the fest, he has come to three realizations. In the anti-intellectual film Democracy Under Attack by Romuald Karmakar we see, one after the other, nine intellectuals ... For exactly ten minutes each intellectual criticizes society on the subject of the euro crisis. They all say, this has to stop, we have to do something. In the middle of the film, for six minutes we see goats, silently eating grass. Third realization: Goats dont talk. Goats do something.\n\nSo do people, of course, and at the Cinema for Peace 10th anniversary gala, held at Berlins classic Gendarmenmarkt concert hall, Hollywood again came out in force, raising desperately needed funds for the foundations work to further peace and understanding worldwide through involvement in the production and dissemination of films about the prevention of disease, violence, genocide, war, poverty and violation of human rights.\n\nThis years honorees included people and films from and about Burma, with French director Luc Bessons latest film The Lady (which screened here in DC at the MPAA on April 9, with an introduction by Secretary of State Hilary Clinton), about political and human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyis unceasing struggles against Burmas military dictatorship, receiving the International Human Rights Film Award. Cinema for Peace was also behind the 2010 documentary film about the Burmese comedian and human rights activist Zarganar, This Prison Where I Live; and in October 2011, after Aung San Suu Kyis urgent appeal to support Burmese activists, Zarganar, who had been imprisoned shortly after the shooting of the film, was released with 200 other prisoners. (For more on that film, see this reporters September 2010 Storyboard article about the Munich Film Festival.)\n\nAngelina Jolie, in a soft, clinging silvery gown, nestled in the arms of Brad Pitt as she awaited her turn to speak: In the Land of Blood and Honey, Jolies directorial debut film about the Bosnian war, was receiving the foundations Honorary Award for Opposing War and Genocide. The film had its European premiere at the modernist, glass-paned Haus der Berliner Festspieles new cinema, a new venue for the Berlinale (making a grand total of 22, some with several theaters) the night before. The people in that region mean a lot to me, she told the glittering audience. They have suffered so much and have still survived. They are simply astonishing and immensely worthy.\n\nAs was the gala, which in previous years has raised close to $4,000,000 for humanitarian efforts. Fame is a currency you can use like money, said singer, songwriter and fellow activist, Live Aids Bob Geldof, in his opening remarks. For the stars who came out on a cold winters night  among them Jolie who stood coatless, signing autographs for countless shivering, eager fans warmed by her smile  it is a currency that can, in turn, earn money for worthy causes.\n\nFor Brad Pitt, turning name and fame into other peoples (much needed) currency wasnt enough: he added a nice chunk of his own, outbidding the well-heeled crowd for a meeting with boxing legend Mohammed Ali at the Olympic games in London. Perhaps he took to heart Geldofs threat that if the guests didnt bid enough at the auction, Im gonna come over there personally and beat you up. Then again, given what hed just gotten, he may have covered his bases.\n\nOr not: That meeting may not come soon enough if he wants to take on some of the critics of his wifes film. (Although, as a Berliner Zeitung critic noted, Angelina Jolie could make a 10-hour film about dust whirls in an otherwise empty room and the attention of the international press would be hers.) There were few at the SRO press conference earlier that day  most of the lukewarm assessments have come from published reviews  but in the midst of the Hyatt love fest, an Iranian journalist contested what he saw as the films one-sidedness.\n\nSeated at the podium in the large room reserved for press conferences at the Grand Hyatt Berlin, clad simply in a classic black cocktail dress and surrounded by eight of her actors, her brown hair flowing down her shoulders, Jolie listened intently as each answered a question, her eyes not leaving the actors face. When it came her turn, the first question a direct challenge, she responded with poise and quiet determination  straight as an arrow, noted the Tagesspiegel, allowing no one to make her feel subordinate  and, this reporter would add, her lips smiling demurely, while her wide, penetrating blue eyes spoke a language of their own.\n\nJolie, who in addition to writing and directing a film about human rights issues, for the last 10 years has been a very active ambassador with the U.N. Refugee Agency, and currently serves as U.N. goodwill ambassador to the High Commissioner for Refugees. Even through all my years of working with the United Nations and talking to people at the State Department, she told Screen International, I still couldnt get anyone to explain to me what happened and why ...at that time in the 1990s, when everyone was talking about Schindlers List and we were very focused on mass atrocities, we could go on ignoring this situation for so long and not assist these people. How did that happen?\n\nHer film, as it turned out, would seek to answer not that question, but the deeper one underlying it: How could neighbors turn against neighbors in a modern European country in the 1990s? In the Land of Blood and Honey had not answered, but had explored that question as best she could. Now, she was ready to meet the hundreds of members of the international press who had managed to squeeze into the large room.\n\nThe first questioner was an Iranian reporter who accused her of making a one-sided film that ignored the reasons for the war. Jolie responded evenly. You have every right to write a review and speak to whatever way you see the film, she said, as all people have a right to do based on their own background, their own personal view of art and relationships and story, and so thats how you see it. Clearly, and here her smile broadened, thats not the way it was intended. And I think that many people do not see it that way; in fact I know that most people dont see it that way.\n\nCertainly the actors didnt. Locked in a room for two to three hours to read the script, Sarajevo native Goran Kostic (Danijel) begged for more time: Having read it twice  it was so obvious that the script was so complex, and it had a depth which required further readings  he realized that the more I was reading, the deeper I was getting into the complexity of the story. Wondering who had written it, he was  well, amazed is too mild a word to describe his reaction when he learned not only who it was, but that it was someone who had no direct experience of the war. (But then, as the Tagesspiegels Martenstein could have told him, eyewitnesses to historic events, be they perpetrators, victims or witnesses, are bad judges of them. Just imagine the Nazi period with films made just by German directors, and nothing by Spielberg, Tarantino, Benigni or Lanzmann.)\n\nLiving in Sarajevo, surrounded by women who are victims of war, said Zana Marjanovic, who plays the key role of Ajla, the Muslim artist who falls in love with the Serbian soldier Danijel, I see that day by day their stories are being forgotten. Which is why its so important that I had the opportunity to represent these women. And I can only hope I did a good job. Vanesa Glodjo (Lejla) said it took her three times as long to read the script because it was very painful for me, each page, clearing her throat and blinking quickly. She gave me the words and opportunity to express what I lived during the war. And Im deeply, deeply grateful to her. Another actor said he couldnt believe it that it was written by a woman who did not live through this war.\n\nRade erbedija (Danijels father) praised Jolie and the film, saying its not a film about war, but about the love of two young people who would probably be happy parents in a few years if this war didnt happen to this country. Thank you very much, he concluded sincerely, as he and Jolie exchanged knowing glances. Nikola Djuric'ko, who plays Danijels best friend, said he was really hoping for the lead role, but found that it had gone to Goran. But she likes you, he was told.  She? Who, she? I asked them. Angelina Jolie. I thought it was a joke. Yeah, right, and maybe Robert De Niro, I told them, as laughter rippled across the room. He went on to praise both Jolie and the rest of the cast, who through the experience of the film had become not only colleagues, but friends.\n\nBranko Djuric, a self-described Sarajevan of mixed breed with Muslim mother and Serb father, had played a Bosnian soldier a decade before in Danis Tanovics No Mans Land. Offered this role, he amiably allowed, he thought that maybe it was time [to even the score] of mother-father, 1-1. Boris Ler, like Goran Kostic, was disbelieving that an actress like Jolie had written the script he was given, so deeply did it explore every aspect of what was happening in the region, and echoed his fellow actors praise for it and for her. As he was only a child during the war years, his direct experience of the period was limited, but watching them as they struggled with their emotions during the shooting gave him a window into their depth and complexity.\n\nAs to the controversy the film has stirred in Bosnia, for me that is one of the greatest things that is happening, because  I dont know if its rude that Im saying this, but our region is a slave to their history, and we are stuck in one place. And until we start not being stuck in one place, we cannot move forward. And so, thank you  with a nod to Jolie  for doing this story.\n\nAlma Terzic recalled meeting Jolie for the first time, convinced that shed bowl the actress, now screenwriter and director, over with her comedic chops within seconds  only to become bowled over herself upon being introduced. And I said  her huge, pale blue eyes suddenly expressionless, her mouth frozen in a shell-shocked smile   Hi.  As she got to know Jolie and work with her, Terzic began to learn what it meant to Jolie, that this is bigger than this film, its bigger than us. Raped women in a war  its bigger than Bosnia Herzegovina; its a universal story, she continued, that is happening in parts of the world now, and has been part of wars throughout history. Jolie herself was like [a] mother to us, letting her actors determine their own comfort level, postponing scenes until they felt ready to shoot them, giving them a little push when necessary.\n\nResponding to a reporter (the same one who had challenged Jolie) who had difficulty sorting out the relationship between the two leads  was it true love, or simply sex, a hostage situation, with Danijel taking advantage of the situation?  Marjanovic replied that this was one of the things that made working with Jolie such a rarity. You dont often get the opportunity to work with a director who understands and appreciates this form of art, where the audience isnt given the answers, but has to develop its own.\n\nI have my own version, of course; I have my truth. I would say its a love that would have been beautiful, and could have been beautiful, but it didnt happen, because the war and here her tone grew deliberate, as she enunciated every word, did change everything... And thats the story we wanted to tell. Kostic agreed.\n\nWhy did the film have to show the killing of children in such awful detail, a young woman reporter wanted to know. You yourself are a mother of six children  And thats exactly why, Jolie replied, thanking her for the question. Theres always a question in art, when you do a film about war, what you need to show, what you should show ...Everyone who sees this film who lived through this war knows it only shows a small piece of how horrible it was. There is no film that could create the true horrors of war. But we do have a responsibility ... It should be hard to watch. It should linger ...\n\nWith the child, being a mother, it was my worst nightmare. But in fact you never see the child dead. You never see blood, or a body. You just think you do. And thats part of film. Perhaps; but it wasnt as easy for Jolie as her dispassionate demeanor may have suggested. In an interview with the Berliner Kurier, Jolie confessed that directing such scenes affected her so strongly she sometimes collapsed in tears. I often couldnt fall asleep at night. I couldnt eat. How did you get through it? I had a duty to fulfill. I reveal things that a lot of people are unaware of. I want to be part of the solution.\n\nWhy did she choose such a difficult theme for her first film? To find an answer to the question that kept nagging at her as she traveled throughout the world and saw cultivated people become monsters, asking herself how men could abuse women without batting an eyelash. And how did she manage to write such a film, with all that she has on her plate? By simply utilizing every minute. I can still remember writing some of the most intense scenes during [daughter] Shilohs art lessons. That was really weird.\n\nBack at the Hyatt, agreeing with a Serbian journalist that the film focuses on the war largely from a Bosnian Muslim perspective, Jolie invited other filmmakers to portray it from all different sides, and tell many different stories. Asked what the greatest difficulty for her was, Jolie admitted that was it: finding a balance that would be truthful in all respects, and yet be sensitive to the people and politics of the region. Jolie believes she found that balance. We didnt want to point fingers  well, maybe at the international community  but to learn from each other and explore how societies are changed after years of war. And the women, both the actresses and those in the region, taught me so much and enriched my life. And I hope you can feel that in the film.\n\nNext up? A lighter touch: A Disney movie  for my children. Which, for this devoted mother of six  who, in addition to managing one of the most difficult of cultural and cinematic balancing acts, in her rare free moments enjoys taking the kids to Legoland  brings us full circle. Oh  and where did she go for advice as she was making the film, asked the Kurier. My single and most important advisor is Brad. I discussed my ideas with him and he gave me critical tips. Even, she added, when I didnt always want to hear them.\n\nBut she probably gave them a listen. Which is more than one would say for Mavis, the antiheroine of Jason Reitman and Diablo Codys Young Adult (USA 2011), which intrigued DCFS viewers at Decembers Coming Attractions Trailer Night. Young Adult shows yet another side of the uber-versatile Charlize Theron, who has played everything from the serial-killing Monster Aileen Wuornos, for which she won an Oscar (as well as a Silver Bear in Berlin); to a dedicated city police detective, in Paul Haggiss In the Valley of Elah (2007); to the sex kitten Britt Ekland, in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004).\n\nMavis, by contrast, is a thirtyish one-time high school prom queen (in her case, both figurative and literal): snotty, self-absorbed, and simultaneously detested and envied by all who wanted to be her. Although highly (if anonymously) successful in her career as a ghost writer for the hugely popular Young Adult book series, Mavis suddenly decides she deserves to have the one thing that eluded her back then: the eternal love of (in the form of marriage to) her now happily married high school sweetheart Buddy  who has just become a father. A mere technicality, easily surmountable.\n\nFor Mavis, whose emotional depth seems to match that of her both sadly and hilariously lightweight literary creations  Reitman and Cody show us Mavis in the height  depth?  of the creative process  its a natural progression. She will lure Buddy to their favorite high school hangout for a few drinks, and as soon as he sees her in her slinky, low-cut black dress, whose décolletage she attempts to enhance (well, we know what happens with that) and she looks deep into his eyes, he will sweep her off her feet, their love will burst into flame, their throbbing passion reignite  and for eternity.\n\nBut life isnt a romance novel, and since this is a film by Jason Reitman (Juno, Thank You for Smoking, The Office) and Diablo Cody (Juno, United States of Tara), it is not aimed at teens, although they would probably see themselves and their friends (and if theyre lucky, as the film progresses, their parents and teachers) in its characters. Briefly, Mavis convinces herself that Buddy still has the hots for her, despite his very obvious happiness and sense of completeness with his attractive, intelligent, warm, funny, talented wife and their new baby. Even the impartial but caring voice of reason, represented by former classmate Matt (Patton Oswalt), who like every non-jock at school dreamed of making love to/having sex with (depending on how they looked at the world) Mavis, falls on deaf ears.\n\nThere will be a reckoning: demeaning, demoralizing, devastating. But because this is a movie for grown-ups its not didactic, nor does it tack on a phony Hollywood-ever-after ending. And while this all may sound deadly serious, because its a film by Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman, the side-splittingly spot-on dialogue and sophisticated directing and acting leave us alternately rolling our eyes and rolling in the aisles. And  something we never expected  with an underlying sympathy for Mavis, as we realize that her passive aggressiveness, her meanness is really a key to her vulnerability, as Cody said in an interview. That in watching people she traditionally pities pity her back, we gain some insight into how fragile she actually is.\n\nAt the press conference, Jason Reitman gave us some insight into how central and how natural his collaboration with Cody is. Diablo is like a sister to me, he told the small group of journalists. And the truth is, she writes on her own, and exceptionally fast, letting him know when she has something for him. And the collaboration [for Young Adult] only lasted about a week or two. Im really just grateful that shes in my life. By virtue of her writing, my filmography is infinitely more complex.\n\nPatton Oswalt approached the absent Cody from another, if no less affectionate (but somewhat more curious) perspective. Diablo is like a transgendered brother to me, he told us, then went on to explain that she is such a nonjudgmental listener, skilled at portraying how people fail to communicate with each other, especially when they most need to.\n\nHow do you cast your films? The key element, said Reitman, is that the actor contain some sort of DNA that they share with the character,. And Mavis? Have you met people as monstrous  or as tragic  as she is? Reitman rejected the first characterization. To label Mavis a monster is really to identify her by her symptoms, and not what they are symptoms of. Mavis is someone who just desperately wants to be loved, and is just going about it all the wrong way.\n\nFor that reason I dont judge her, and makes it very easy for me to sympathize with her. Hopefully, when you watch a movie, youre identifying with a character through the filmmakers eyes. I think thats why its been possible for me to make a movie about the lobbyists for big tobacco, a movie about a guy who fires people for a living, and now this film. I dont cast them in a negative light, because I just dont see them that way.\n\nIt was important for Reitman that the characters be seen as hyper-real, to an extent beyond any of his previous films, from the digital hand-held style of shooting to the costumes, which he got from second-hand stores. The challenge was making Charlize look slobby. I mean, shes built as God designed, so that even when you try to make her look like a slob, it looks like slobby chic. He solved the problem by fitting her with clothes a size too big.\n\nWhat is Maviss problem? Is it psychological, or societal? Reitman considered. Were living in a time when people are given the luxury of not growing up, he said, and so continue to dress and behave like children long past the traditional expiration date of childhood. And this character kind of falls into every trap. And behind it is  and I dont want to sound repetitive  a need to be loved. There is this need to be understood that seems to be universal, and that I never see onscreen. How many people like this do you know personally? Oswalt didnt hesitate. Hollywood is the world capital of people that have decided, I want to be 19 forever.  For Reitman, his admitted fascination with older, complicated women, whom he has portrayed insightfully in all of his films, dates back to his teen years, and resides in part in his appreciation of the conflicts of the post-feminist generation, whose members theoretically can have it all, but at a high cost. Theres a ticking clock on them that doesnt apply to men, and I think that confrontation is fascinating.\n\nTheres a ticking clock of another kind on artist and activist Ai Weiwei, whose continuing confrontation with Chinese authorities is the subject of a fascinating documentary by the young Philadelphia-born director Alison Klayman. Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry (USA 2012), which won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance, began its life in 2008, when Klayman started filming Ai shortly after he completed work on Beijings Birds Nest Olympic stadium, only to later boycott the Games when he realized they were to be used for party propaganda.\n\nBut there was worse to come. Ai found evidence that poorly constructed schools were responsible for the high death toll in the May 2008 earthquake that struck Sichuan Province in which thousands of children perished. To counter the authorities attempted cover-up, Ai began researching the childrens names, which he published. Now under surveillance, Ai becomes a victim himself when he is assaulted during a police raid and undergoes emergency brain surgery in Munich. He later creates an installation of 9,000 backpacks on the Haus der Kunsts façade called Remembering, along with a retrospective exhibition titled So Sorry to memorialize the victims  a reference to the thousands of apologies made by government officials and corporations worldwide, without concomitant actions to right the wrongs.\n\nIn an even larger and more ambitious installation, Ai pours 100 million hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds into Londons Tate Moderns Turbine Hall, symbolizing the sum of his past efforts and the power of mass connection and mass communication. (The exhibition, which was a tactile sensation, with people shown in the film strolling through and even blissfully burying themselves in the seeds, was shut down from public access after it was discovered, according to the New York Times, that the dust they [stirred] up posed a health hazard.)\n\nIn an interview before a large audience at the Haus der Berliner Festspiele that had just seen her film, Klayman described how this remarkable journey began for her. Having moved to China in 2006 for no good reason, to have adventures, to learn a new language, and maybe make a documentary one day, Klayman first met Ai through her roommate, who was curating an exhibit of his 10,000 or so photographs  Ai is an inveterate photographer  and asked if she might like to make a video to accompany it. As I was underemployed at the time and up for anything, Klayman went along  and wound up following and filming Ai for three years. Until his Shanghai studio was demolished, and Ai was unlawfully detained for 81 days, charged with tax evasion.\n\nA persistent gadfly in a country that swiftly and reflexively swats them down, Ai started photographing his interrogators when he was brought in for questioning, for posting on his Twitter account, explaining that he was only doing what they were doing (apparently these sorts of interrogations are routinely filmed). What they may not have realized, said Klayman, is that these things were going to be seen all over the world.\n\nWhile Klayman has no expectation that the film will be publicly screened in China, she has no doubt that it will be downloaded there, as Ais own films and blog have been. There are a lot of like-minded people in China, and thats one of the things conveyed in the film, something that was important to Ai, although most of them have not fared as well  if it can be called well  as he. Still, Ais visibility and international renown, as well as his heritage as the son of a dissident poet, have no doubt mitigated the consequences of his refusal to be muzzled. And yet ...\n\nHe looked different upon his release, noted a questioner. Do you think theyve succeeded in silencing him? Klayman was hesitant, but seemed hopeful; while he still posts on Twitter, his statements have been less political. His spirit is intact, but he has to be a lot more careful than he was before. But not silenced, by any means. Just days before, Agence France-Presse announced that Ai is reuniting with the Swiss architects with whom he created Beijings spectacular Birds Nest Stadium, to build a pavilion for this years London Olympics.\n\nIn a press interview, Ai Weiwei was asked what he would like people to do after seeing the film. I think they should really think that freedom of expression is very valuable, and they should treasure this right. In many areas and locations around the world, you can completely lose your freedom simply because you are asking for freedom...\n\nWhat made me a recognizable figure is only because I do have an issue, and also because I successfully use the Internet, to a degree... [T]oday we do have new possibilities, and we can make the world into a better place for everybody.\n\nA noble charge, one worthy of a man such as Ai Weiwei, who thinks  and acts  globally, often through acts whose immediate impact is imperatively local. But for most of us, think globally, act locally is more easily achieved in the abstract: we recycle, conscious that were somehow helping save the planet. Yet it wasnt so long ago that, in places much closer than China  in fact, places just a hairs breadth away geographically from where we sat and watched these films  acting locally, or simply asking for freedom, meant risking your freedom, and in extreme cases your life, and that of your loved ones.\n\nIn Barbara (Germany 2012), which won Christian Petzold this years Silver Bear for Best Director (as well as the Berliner Morgenpost Readers Prize), the eponymous protagonist is a doctor in 1980 East Berlin who has applied for an exit visa  and found herself exited to a provincial hospital as punishment for her audacity and disloyalty. At first feeling much the fish out of water, now even farther away from her West German lover, who is planning her escape, Barbara must find a way to adjust to this strange new world, as its inhabitants must to her. Is the handsome and personable colleague, for whom there is a mutual but unspoken attraction, sincere? Or is his attention a sign hes been assigned to keep an eye on her?\n\nAnd then there are the supporting characters, one of whom will figure prominently in the films surprising conclusion. Barbara is drawn to a young woman from Torgau, the first patient she was given to treat because she was the only one who could calm the screaming girl. The girl tells her shes pregnant, and begs Barbara to help her escape: she know shell be sent back to the workhouse, which André tells Barbara is what she already suspects: Torgau is an extermination camp. And he has exhausted all legal means of keeping the girl at the hospital.\n\nThe more we observe, the less certain we become. Petzold has us placed us in the uncomfortable position of complete outsiders, giving us plenty of POV shots, but so generously distributed among the characters, there is no overarching point of view. Barbara herself, played by Petzolds muse Nina Hoss in their fourth filmic collaboration, is encased in the protective shell she must needs have developed to survive in the unforgiving world of the communist East. There was a great deal of mistrust everywhere, said Petzold, whose impressions were gained through occasional visits, so the atmosphere must have been pervasive, not only because you felt the government is everywhere [but] also because there was a kind of barter economy: If I give him something, I will get something in return. \n\nRonald Zehrfeld, who plays André and grew up in East Germany, confirmed Petzolds read, recalling all the sublevels between the people that so constricted the space between them: Can I trust someone? Is he doing this just for his own benefit, or does he really mean it?  For all that, Ostalgie (nostalgia for the East) is very real, even for those who hated everything the repressive state stood for. There was that special social interaction that was so much more common back then, said Zehrfeld, that people miss today. Hoss agreed. In this atmosphere there is always an underlying mistrust. And yet [there was] great warmth ... This film passes no moral judgments, but rather offers possibilities.\n\nPerhaps. Contemplating the films seemingly intractable contradictions, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung noted the sudden trust in the eyes of a young girl who desperately wants to leave the country, and who is treated by Barbara when she enters the clinic.\n\nWhat is possible between people who do not dare to show who they are? What does lying to protect oneself make of these possibilities? Can feeling exist without candor, can candor exist where there is fear? Barbara doesnt ask, but rather tells it, densely, closely; able, again and again, to open peoples eyes.\n\nThe critics eyes were certainly open  not a single paper missed reviewing Barbara  and came up with strikingly different appraisals. While the Tagesspiegels six- and the Berliner Zeitungs seven-critic panel consistently rated Barbara head and shoulders above the competition among the Competition films (a judgmental unity that would remain virtually unique for both groups as they viewed subsequent festival films), the non-panel reporter who reviewed the film for the first paper saw things differently.\n\nCalling it beautiful but hardly great, and failing to measure up to Petzolds Ghosts or Yella (nominated for Golden Bears in 2005 and 2007 respectively), he decried what he described as a clear-cutness that informs not only the way the actors are directed, but the story itself. For him, the story lacked a sense of urgency, a feeling [by the characters] of having to flee because the ground is being pulled out from under your feet. Its novella-like completeness might be a win for its political-historical subject matter, he concluded, but was a loss  if a small one  for Petzold as a filmmaker.\n\nNot so the critic who reviewed Barbara for the Berliner Zeitung (and who did sit on their panel). Indeed, he saw the films completeness as a telling aspect of its excellence. For him, Barbara was a genuine masterpiece ... the most perfectly realized film of [Petzolds] career. The Berlinale jury  a jury even Cannes would be proud of, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung noted approvingly  seems to have agreed with him. Its president Mike Leigh, one of the most important directors of the New British Cinema who according to IMDb has won 57 international awards and been nominated for another 54, including 7 Oscars noms  Above all, added the FAZ, in an observation that might offer an insight into his judging style, he is the man in whose films no one is condemned  was joined by an equally distinguished panel:\n\nDutch photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn, whose Control (2007) won 16 international awards, including 3 at Cannes;\n\nIranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin) was preceded by four awards, including the Golden Bear for Best Film, at last years Berlinale;\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, perhaps best known for his Oscar-nominated turn as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain (2005);\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg, whose performance in Lars von Triers controversial Antichrist (2009) won several awards; including Best Actress at Cannes;\n\nFrench filmmaker François Ozon, whose Ricky (2009) and Angel (2007) were nominated for Golden Bears and whose Swimming Pool (2003) was nominated for the Palme dOr;\n\nAlgerian author Boualem Sansal, whose woks have been internationally acclaimed and have won top literary awards in France; and\n\nGerman actress Barbara Sukowa, onetime protégée of Rainer Werner Fassbinder whose most recent award was for her role as Hildegard von Bingen in Margarethe von Trottas Vision (2009), which screened at E Street Cinema a few months ago.\n\nWith such a diverse and gifted group of creative types, how did the negotiations go? Weve all got a great sense of humor, said Leigh, who a week before had told us with delightful dryness, Theyre a very well-behaved jury, if I may say so. (The Tagesspiegel saw him, while a good head shorter than his fellow jurors, as at once guiding spirit, Big Daddy and commander in chief of a family, with Ozon recognizing [Leighs] authority as benevolent patriarch, Sukowa as the wise female family head, and Gainsbourg as the dreamy sister, eyeing her simultaneous translator as if he were a mini UFO.) This is one festival that I really enjoy and celebrate for its joie de vivre. The cold informs the spirit; it brings people together, Leigh had assured us.\n\nNow, in the Berlinale Palast, Leigh sat surrounded by his fellow jurors as the awards ceremony was about to begin, pronouncing the whole experience a great celebration of film. The cinemas festive elegance, with guests variously glittering, satiny, and embroidered evening wear in the darkened cinema and richly hued LED lighting illuminating the proceedings onstage, contrasted sharply with our daily experience there, viewing the contenders in the sometimes literal rough and tumble of the early morning rush to snag that favorite seat.\n\nI hope, added Leigh, eyebrow raised, as the last audience members were settling in, that weve arrived at some interesting decisions.\n\nAlways interesting, that word interesting, when used by people with a hundred other words at their ready disposal. It would be an accurate description, in that less common sense, as we would learn in the ensuing hour. But first: more about some of those contenders, and other films, filmmakers and actors that made their mark at this years Berlinale.\n\nWhere to begin? Well ... why not at the top? All too apt, too, because the Golden Bear for Best Film (as well as the Competition Prize of the Ecumenical Jury) went to a most interesting choice, a film that plays more like a play. In fact, it is a play, framed by the director brothers fly-on-the-wall observational construct filming inmates at the Roman maximum-security prison Rebibbia who stage Shakespeares Julius Caesar, Caesar Must Die (Cesare Deve Morire, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Italy 2011).\n\nThe first few minutes of the film are deceptively snooze-inducing: a production of Julius Caesar in Italian, its audience of mostly middle-class, middle-aged theatergoers watching from red velour seats much like those from which we were watching them. Suddenly the palette shifts to a sharp black and white. It is six months earlier; a prison warden explains to a group of inmates that they have been chosen to audition for a play. Auditions consist of each actor telling his personal details  name, date of birth, previous place of residence, etc.  in three different ways: in a detached manner, as if he were responding to a customs official; as if hes saying farewell to a loved one; and as if hes saying farewell, but is angry at that loved one.\n\nSome of these hardened criminals display impressive dramatic and comedic chops. One wants to know what dialect the directors want, offering a choice of (if memory serves) Sicilian, Roman, and Neapolitan, declaiming forcefully in each; another smoothly advises that hes international, and breaks into a decent rendition of Ive Got You Under My Skin, à la Frank Sinatra. A third asks if he can play the Soothsayer as kind of loopy, explaining that theyre all loopy where I come from.\n\nRome, you city with no shame. Naples, you city with no shame,  proclaims another, adding in an aside to a guard, Sounds like this Shakespeare lived in my city. In a film whose fundamental good faith cannot be questioned, the line exemplifies the occasional awkward moments that virtually every review will mention (Screen International: ... feels a little scripted; Variety: every line appears carefully rehearsed, even the asides; The Hollywood Reporter: A tendency toward overwritten dialogue ...; two or three winced at the line, Since I came to know art, this cell has become a prison).\n\nThat said, theatricality is no stranger in a world where artistic or interpretive disagreements can end in violent fist fights or death threats. (At one point, Caesar and Cassio go outside to settle it.) And in a larger sense, Shakespeare did live in their city: we see how the concept of honor (And Brutus is an honorable man) strikes a chord with men for whom omertá has defined their lives, and in many cases, landed them in Rebibbia.\n\nWe see the inmate who plays Brutus (Salvatore Striano) force his weary cellmate to rehearse with him when hed rather catch a few needed zzzs, then go off to rehearse his own lines as he goes about his work duties mopping the floor, repeating them till he gets them right or understands their layers of meaning. He suddenly stops when he has to recite the line: If only we could stop Caesar without tearing open his chest. (The translations reflect the modern, simplified wording of the screenplay. As the Tavianis told an interviewer, We have taken over [Shakespeares] Julius Caesar, dismembered and rebuilt it.) He later explains that a friend of his had said the same thing to him once.\n\nThe Tavianis see Shakespeare as a father, brother and son, said Paolo Taviani at the press conference. Explaining that we knew prison from American films, Vittorio, who spoke excitedly, with an almost stream-of-consciousness rapidity that threatened to go off the rails but always circled back, described the ambivalence he felt working with actors who are prison inmates: You become sort of an accomplice as you try to understand them and find yourself almost becoming friends with them, knowing that they suffer in prison, they suffer for what they have done... Prison is a terrible experience.\n\nBoth brothers felt that Julius Caesar was a good choice for the prison play, then got the idea to incorporate the prisoners own reality into it to express ourselves through this film, directly through these people who meet Shakespeares characters. The prisoners were able to put themselves in the shoes of the characters, because it reminded them of events in their own lives. The prisoners were given the chance to use stage names, but they all refused, said Paolo. They wanted to be remembered.\n\nWhen Brutus says, I killed Caesar, you can feel that genuine pain that real actors dont have; you can feel his suffering, because its real. Real indeed, and distressful for Striano, we would learn, whose search for layers of meaning may have had its roots in the almost Shakespearean circumstances surrounding his appearance in the play: Striano had been released from Rebibbia five years before, and had agreed to return to shoot the film with his still imprisoned former cellmates.\n\nReading the script, I realized that Shakespeare had messages for me. I realized that we are stupid, Striano told us, because this happened 2,000 years ago and Shakespeare wrote about it 500 years ago... and were still doing the same stupid things. The men in prison are all guilty, he said, but they kind of ask for pardon through this play.\n\nWhy did you shoot in black and white, which has an aesthetic beauty? the directors were asked. Color is more natural,  said Vittorio. We wanted to show how something comes into being inside the souls of these people, of beautiful scenes being born inside their souls. This is why we wanted to use something unrealistic. (The Tavianis had dealt with the darker side of life in a quasi-documentary fashion in Eastmancolor some 35 years before in their Palme dOr-winning Padre padrone, whose abused young protagonist, had he not escaped, could well have been one of the inmates we see here.)\n\nHow did the translation work? The translation was difficult, responded co-screenwriter Fabio Cavalli, the director of theater programs in several prisons whose production of Dantes Inferno at Rebibbia was the spark that inspired the Tavianis Caesar project. And not just inherently: After the directors found several of the actor-inmates translating the screenplay into their own regional dialects, We realized that the dialectical mispronunciation of the lines did not belittle the high tone of the tragedy, the Tavianis told an interviewer, but on the contrary lent those lines a new truth. The convict-actor and his character found a deeper connection through a common language. As did the film with the international market: Two days later, Screen Daily reported its having been sold to France, Brazil, Australia, Spain, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, with U.S. buyers circling.\n\nAs they may be for Danish filmmaker Nikolaj Arcels A Royal Affair (En Kongelig Affære, Denmark/Czech Republic/Germany/Sweden 2012), In theaters March 29 per its IMDb home page. A recipient of two Silver Bears, for Best Actor and Best Screenplay, this dramatic, lush period film, whose story of insanity, enlightenment, revolution, passion and treachery has been the subject of more than 15 books, an opera and a ballet, could not otherwise be more different from the Tavianis  although their Elizabethan father, brother and son might have seen it as confirmation that theres something rotten in the state of Denmark.\n\nAs the film opens, a young woman, her blond hair in a chignon, pensively strokes a chestnut-colored horse as we hear her read, in voice-over, the letter she is writing to her children. Nine years earlier, in 1766, she, Princess Caroline Mathilda, sister of Great Britains King George III (yes, the one we had all that trouble with) was sent to Denmark to be married to the 17-year-old King Christian VII of Denmark and Norway, a role for which she had been prepared from childhood.\n\nThough Caroline is every inch a princess, King Christian is no Prince Charming. Our first glance is of a giggling half-wit. Getting down on his knees, barking boisterously as he alternatingly roughhouses with and baby-talks his beloved hound  which might be unobjectionable, and even endearing, under other circumstances  the young king completely disregards his bride-to-be as she is presented to him. Worse, he becomes jealous of the beautiful and cultivated young woman, insulting her coarsely when hes not ignoring her, having flagrant affairs with every flattered or willing piece of flesh. Dont steal my light, he warns her on their honeymoon night, as he pulls her into the bedchamber and rapes her.\n\nBut she will, and not out of will, but out of necessity  and love, for a man of the Enlightenment who becomes the kings physician and advisor. Johann Struensee (played by Danish dreamboat Mads Mikkelsen) gradually wins the king over to his Voltairean principles of freedom and equality, and we realize that Christian on the whole is not a bad sort, but was brutalized by those charged with his education, is ill-served by his self-serving, mercenary council, and may be manic-depressive.\n\nAs Struensees influence gains sway and the seeds of revolution begin to germinate in town and countryside, there is a fragile equilibrium in the kings actions and reactions, and a dangerous one in the tightrope Caroline and Struensee are walking, which we sense  thanks not only to Arcels astute direction, but to equally skillful acting, editing and camera work  cannot, indeed will not hold. Or, as the Tagesspiegel succinctly put it: With the first scene, director Nikolai Arcel makes it clear: This story must end badly. As it did in reality. And as indiewire cogently summed up the meaty moral quandaries facing Struensee: Should you sacrifice your ideals to gain and retain the power to act on them? Can a belief in your own idealism blind you to the possibility that you are pursuing power for its own sake? How can you be sure your motivation is principle, and not pride?\n\nAt the packed press conference (panel included: there would be eight of them up there), we listened and looked at each other as screams could be heard from outside the room, as if a pop star had exploded. Indeed, theyre mad for Mads in Berlin, who also has a few fans over here (Casino Royales Le Chiffre, anyone?) who might give a costume drama a shot, especially if it contains classically framed shots in which, as the Tageszeitung tells us, Mads Mikkelsen heroically stares straight ahead, into the distance, as well as one caught by indiewire that feels momentarily avant-garde but is so beautifully rendered, they should use the scene in acting classes According to The Hollywood Reporter, Magnolia Pictures has picked up A Royal Affair for U.S. distribution.\n\nThe story of King Christian VII is so well known in Denmark  children grow up with it, Director Nikolaj Arcel told us  that he was surprised no one had made it yet. Mikkelsen, meanwhile, told us frankly that he had rarely seen a costume or period film that awakened feelings in him, but was deeply moved when he read the screenplay.\n\nAn Israeli journo was surprised to see Lars von Trier listed as executive producer in the closing credits, having heard him say with my own ears ... very negative things about the Danish royal family. How did he get involved with this movie, and what does he think of it? Arcel assured us that Lars loves the film, adding that he felt very fortunate, because hes seen a lot of my films and sometimes he doesnt like them. But this one he really liked. Maybe, Arcel grinned, because he helped us work on the script? In fact, von Trier served as sort of a script consultant and was very helpful during preproduction; the same for a historian who was with them. To a reporter who questioned the drama of the film (another had told Arcel he was still shaking, it had affected him so) and whether it was at the expense of historical accuracy, the director smiled and shrugged: Oh yes, always dramatize. Im a storyteller, Im not a dry documentarian.\n\nTo Mikkelsen: How is Struensee seen today in Denmark: hero, villain? And how do you see him? History has looked at Struensee in different ways through the years, Mikkelsen replied. In my eyes, hes an idealist, but as a physician, one who can be more of an armchair idealist without feeling the need to go out and change the world. But then he gets a chance to go out and climb the social ladder a little, and becomes one of many people who starts out like an idealist, and it takes over, and all of a sudden hes behaving like the people he was fighting before. Its a very human development of the story; its what all good dictators do, and what all good idealists do. But basically, hes a very human character, and his weaknesses are very clear. And I really like him for that.\n\nIts not what the idealistic, although quite human (and like Struensee, real) character in Volker Schlöndorffs Calm at Sea (La mer à laube, France/Germany 2011) did, perhaps because his untimely death at the age of 17 precluded it. In fact, it was his actions against and execution by soldiers of one of the 20th centurys most ruthless and demonic dictators that earned him his place in the pantheon of French heroes, one whose story, like that of the Danish king and queen, is taught to his nations schoolchildren.\n\nBut there are critical differences: The story of Guy Môquet, who much like his German counterpart Sophie Scholl distributed anti-Nazi pamphlets and was caught and executed for it, is based in part on recently discovered contemporaneous writings. And he was killed not specifically for that act, but as part of a gratuitous escalation of retribution by Hitler who, enraged by the assassination of a Nazi officer in Nantes, ordered 150 people imprisoned for what were deemed acts against the occupation forces to die by firing squad. (We would learn at the press conference that the order was warped on yet another level: the man who actually shot the Nazi officer not only escaped their fate; he wrote his memoirs after the war.) The shock of the injustice reverberated throughout the land, and led to the creation of the French Resistance.\n\nTold from three perspectives  the Nazi command in Paris, the prisoners held in Brittany and German soldiers stationed at the Atlantic Wall along the coast  while never leaving a doubt who the hero is, Calm at Sea, written and directed by a German who was educated in France and began his career there, purposefully seeks not to pander to the oversimplified good-guy, bad-guy character tropes of most World War II films. I didnt want to create bad and good figures, said Schlöndorff. This is a polyphony of voices. Variety agreed, calling it a scrupulously even-handed ensemble piece. (The Tageszeitung was of another mind, denoting most of the film standard operating procedure for films about the Nazi time whose ambivalently pleasant perpetrators are reduced to simple cowards.)\n\nThe story itself is a complex one and Schlöndorff has drawn from several sources to build his narrative, including a little-known memorandum by Ernst Jünger, whose novels, diaries and memoirs are widely read in Germany. On the Hostage Question details the negotiations leading up to the executions and includes Jüngers personal observations, including the high regard for the courage and dignity of the executed with which everyone speaks.\n\nThe director was drawn to the story when a French journalist presented him with a small book hed written recounting the events leading up to that fateful October day in 1941. In it was noted that Jünger had written extensively on the situation in his memorandum, and that he had translated the farewell letter written by Guy Môquet, which French president Nicolas Sarkozy has instructed to be read aloud in schools on the anniversary of Môquets death, into German. For the German filmmaker who felt himself to be half French, who wanted to be a young Frenchman and tried desperately to fit in as a boy, only to be told, as he recalled with a laugh, that his determination was typically German, the pieces began to fall into place.\n\nToday, as the European Union faces new and continued political and economic challenges and social change, Schlöndorff sees this German-French co-production as a reminder of the foundation of our common culture, the foundation out of which Europe has been shaped, developed. This is not just about coming to terms with the past, he declared. This is also a way of dealing with present-day reality.\n\nAs is Hungarian director Bence Fliegaufs triple-award-winning Just the Wind (Czak a szél, Hungary/Germany/France 2011), which was nominated for the Golden Bear and walked away with the Amnesty International Film Prize, the Peace Film Award, and the Jury Grand Prize Silver Bear. Although your reporter did not get to see this film, because of its overwhelmingly positive critical reception (an exceptional rarity) and its achievement on so many levels, DC Film Society readers deserve to have sufficient information to enable them to appreciate the awards it received.\n\nThe past is ever present for Roma, or gypsies, living in present-day Hungary, where they have been seen (as throughout Western Europe) almost since their first appearance there more than half a millennium ago as unwelcome intruders, and consistently, forcibly, and often brutally expelled. Those who have remained fare no better today than their ancestors, and in recent months have found the situation worsening, with no recourse to civil remedy; according to Wikipedia, open discrimination and abuse by government officials appears to be part of a broad social pattern of discrimination and marginalization that increases in times of economic hardship. In other words, now.\n\nJust the Wind is a fictional rendering of a recent series of unsolved murders of Hungarian gypsies  eight, over a period of a year  that draws us deep inside the Roma community. An entire family has been killed, the perpetrators unidentified; an ominous, almost perceptible threat hangs over the rest of the inhabitants. The film follows the members of one of these families  a woman, her invalid father, her teenage daughter and preteen son  over a 24-hour period as the impending horror, building to its inexorable climax, closes in on them.\n\nCritics praised this spare, naturalistic drama that puts a face on the victims of racially motivated violence while [c]reating an atmosphere of mounting threat without ever resorting to histrionics (Variety), mix[ing] the foreboding back story of [Gus Van Sants Elephant] with the handheld, documentary intensity of [Cristi Puius The Death of Mr. Lazarescu] to create an atmosphere thats consistently menacing and strikingly realistic (The Hollywood Reporter), imprisoning the audience in their insular community ... [the familys] sense of heightened paranoia ... amplified by the films ominous score which instills a palpable sense of foreboding doom. Steadily building to a nerve-shattering conclusion, Just the Wind is a pressure cooker of social criticism which deceptively hooks you early on, before slowly reeling you in for the kill (cine-vue.com).\n\nAt the press conference, director Bence Fliegauf said that hed had some connection with the Romanies as a boy, then lost contact as he grew older. Deciding to make this film, he realized that as set designer and casting director in addition to being the films director (he was also the screenwriter and wrote the score), he would have to get to know these families on their home turf.\n\nFliegauf said he was very glad to live in a country where such a film can be made, and that he was surprised that some people would think that [the film] would [present] a bad image of Hungary. If a country has a bad image, it is even more important that movies can be made that are critical of society, and that shows that artists are free to criticize [the society] ... I hope that my movie will do something for the image of Hungary. At the same time, responding to another question, Fliegauf acknowledged that when a gypsy applies for a job, he first calls to verify that he meets the qualifications, then finds upon arriving for an interview  when his ethnicity is evident  that the job has already been taken.\n\nA journalist asked what Fliegauf thought of a government leaflet that relativizes the attacks on gypsies and regrets them with crocodile tears. The director said he was unfamiliar with the document  his producer at the other end of the podium insisting that the government had fully supported the film  and asked that it be brought to him. Upon reading it, he blanched. Oh my God. Amid other tangential (and seemingly oblivious) chatter on the podium and in the audience of journalists, the Q&A resumed.\n\nTangential chatter abounds as well when people want to ignore the elephant in the room. In Hans-Christian Schmids Home for the Weekend (Was bleibt, Germany 2012), the pachyderm in the suburban upper-middle-class home where Berlin author Markos mom and dad live, is his mothers longtime mental instability. Having gone off the meds that have keep her on track for 30 years, thanks to homeopathy shes feeling healthier and happier than shes ever felt before, but keenly aware that her husband and younger son, a dentist, are waiting for the other shoe to drop while unconvincingly pretending to believe the change is permanent and real.\n\nInto this simmering storm walk Marko and his little boy on one of their regular, intentionally infrequent (which he tries to pass off as due to busyness) visits. This time he has news to share  hes just published his first book  and news hed rather not share: he and his wife separated six months ago. The good news is accepted with less enthusiasm than Marko had hoped. Jakob is preoccupied with his own issues, deep in debt from setting up his new practice and building a house, and none too happy that Gitte (both sons, reflecting her and Günters sixties-style parenting, call them by their first names) has discontinued, at least temporarily, her prescription medication. And Günter, whos helping bail out his son and has just sold his publishing house for a sizable sum, beating its inevitable demise as yet another victim of e-books, has plans that his wifes sudden wellness may throw a wrench in.\n\nOur first glimpses of Gitte form an adept introduction, and foreground the subtext of the conflicts to come. Lying on a white-sheeted table with acupuncture needles sticking out of her head and face, she looks like a death mask. Cut to Gitte out in the garden with her grandson, on her knees, beaming with joy as she chases and teases him and he shrieks with delight. As we meet the rest of the family, with their insecurities and secretive glances, we cant help but think she has to be the healthiest one there, and push the opening shot out of our minds.\n\nSlowly and at first unobtrusively, we learn that in her previous state she was irrational, given to screaming fits and sudden silences  in short, what we have come to learn of manic-depression. Growing up in that household could not have been easy. The Gitte we see now feels like a new person, and simply wants those she loves to join her in the world of naturalness shes now a part of. But they cant  at one point, she accuses them of treating her like furniture  with the exception of her grandson. In an exquisitely tender scene, seeing Marko and Zowie (pronounced with a long o, perhaps a hangover from, or unconscious tribute to, that generations Salinger obsession) and sensing theyve had a rough day, Gitte silently, lovingly lays them down on the sofa for a midday nap on the sofa downstairs; her famous author son in this moment, too tired to resist, again a child. So weary they dont even notice the brightness of the sun streaming through the open blinds, they fall fast asleep, oblivious to the sound of the cars engine outside the window.\n\nThe reviews hit highs so high and lows so low, one could reasonably have been tempted to recommend meds to the press corps. While The Hollywood Reporter lauded This extended gaze beyond the traumatic events of the weekend and into the broader emotional fabric of the familys lives, adding, You never question that this is a group bound by blood ties and love, however difficult it may be to maintain those connections, Neues Deutschlands critic must have dipped his pen in poison ink, asserting that it was, instead, a family sprung out of the craft book for plot parts  every sentence, every picture, every gesture, adding: I dont believe a single word in this film. (The end of the review is too painful to print.)\n\nThe rest of the press more than made up for it. Variety praised A credible, professionally executed chamber piece and Tagesspiegel A finely drawn, minimalist film, while Screen International assured that ... this delicately executed miniature ... will yield complexity and depth for viewers who care to delve beneath its deceptively smooth surface.\n\nIn a press interview Schmid and screenwriter Bernard Lange talked about what went into the making of the film and how closely they themselves identified with the situation in which their lead character finds himself. For me Home for the Weekend is an inventory of personal issues that have accumulated over the years, said Lange. ... exploring the fact that we belong to a generation that are having children but are still caught up in the role of being children to our parents. Both of them had a great desire to tell a story that personally had something to do with us, if not directly, after previously collaborating on Requiem (2006), about a student whose emotional breakdown leads her parents to summon an exorcist, and Storm (2009), which dealt with the International Tribunals prosecution of Serbian war criminals.\n\nWhile Gittes manic-depression is the catalyst for the story, for Schmid, this film is more about how women get the short end in relationships, the downsides suffered from living an unfulfilled life that are amplified when children are out of the house. Lange is not even sure if Gitte is really sick. It is a state of unhappiness and discontent that you simply cant fix with drugs.\n\nIf any woman should be in a state of unhappiness and discontent you cant fix with drugs, it is the oppressed, but not depressed protagonist of Rodrigo Plás The Delay (La demora, Uruguay/Mexico/France 2012), who in any event wouldnt be able to afford them. Living from one meager paycheck to the next with an elderly father on the edge of Alzheimers who has a tendency to wander off in search of his past (and whom she has to bathe every day, shown in gritty detail in the starkly cinéma vérité opening scene) and three kids who always need school money and cant help but want the latest must-have, Maria learns that there are layoffs at the factory where she works. While the bosses, conveniently, are getting big fat bonuses. And in what seems another inevitability in a life increasingly becoming as cramped as her small Montivideo apartment, that she earns just enough to put her above the poverty threshold that would allow her to place papa in a state-run nursing facility.\n\nThe Delay, which won both the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury for Best Film in the Forum section and the Tagesspiegel Readers Prize, chronicles the day Maria makes a desperate decision that she almost immediately regrets: After yet another rejection, she takes her father to a bench outside the facility and tells him shell be back, telling herself someone will surely take him to a shelter where hell be cared for. Wishful, and as she soon realizes delusional thinking: While one or two people stop to ask if hes OK as night falls and the temperatures drop (something we could all ruefully appreciate in Berlins sub-freezing February chill), they leave when he tells them insistently that hes waiting for his daughter; shell be right back.\n\nThe specifics may be fictional but the phenomenon is all too real, and in todays worsening economy none too rare, said Plá at a post-screening Q&A, explaining that the idea for the film came from a newspaper article hed read about the problem. While hes under no illusions that his film will be the catalyst for change  the issue is too complex for simple solutions  he nonetheless hopes it will get people thinking and talking about it. The Berliner Zeitung got the message, loud and clear: More and more people, above all single mothers with several children, are caught in a vicious circle of overwork and exhaustion. Its all about personal responsibility, is the popular philosophy, but at the end of the day, [it all comes down to] pure, naked exploitation. [In this film], lifes work also means working your life away.\n\nThe message, and the film, hit home not just in Berlin but elsewhere. Closer to home, at the Guadalajara International Film Festival, chicanafromchicago.com reported that Everyone is talking about La demora down here ... [f]resh off its Berlin world premiere, and evocatively described up its impact: The character-driven film is remarkable for its indelible performances and understated, moody and immersive atmosphere.\n\nAnd it was not alone. For first-time feature film director Umut Dag, whose Kuma (Austria 2011) screened simultaneously in four theaters to accommodate the enormous interest, characters and atmosphere combine to create an absorbing depiction of the age-old struggle between tradition and today in the lives of immigrant families, where the stakes are significantly higher and the clash of generations more acute than it will be for their children and grandchildren.\n\nThe conflict plays out among members of a Turkish immigrant family in rural Austria. As in The Delay, the needs of an older man are the engine driving the dramatic action, and their impact on a younger woman propels the story that unfolds. Here, though, the needs are of a very different kind. Far from being ready for the rest home, Ahmet is looking to take on a second wife, or kuma, to live with him, his children  and his current wife.\n\nKuma is a powerful, disconcerting and at times disorienting film, shifting swiftly from scene to scene so that the viewer loses track of time and place, a confusion that, when he thinks about it afterward, is true to the way young Ayse sees the new world she has been thrown into. It is also spiked with unexpected humor, which while adding to the disorientation is also a not unwelcome distraction from the intensity of the drama.\n\nIt begins quietly. A pale, drawn, fiftyish woman  we later learn that this is Ahmets wife, Fatma  reassures her concerned twenty-something daughters that shell be OK. She steps outside, and for several seconds, in a shot that is masterfully framed, acted and directed, stands silently on the porch, pensive against the daily ordinariness of the street below that has begun to look foreign to her.\n\nExpecting further narrative in that vein, we are blown out of our seats by a deafening drumbeat competing with the equally deafening shrieks of small children at play, dressed in their finest but racing around chasing each other in the sunshine as adults enjoy the celebration in relaxed conversation. It takes a while before we realize the scene has shifted not only to a different place, but to a different country: The woman was in Austria; the party is in Turkey. Im sure well be celebrating your wedding next, a middle-aged woman gushes to a younger one. Id rather chew glass, replies the latter, straight-faced as Buster Keaton, staring ahead.\n\nArriving at her new home in Austria, Ayse, who was conned into marriage thinking that the handsome young man who stood beside her was to be her husband and would take her to a Western country at least as liberal as the community she grew up in, meets the family (Mehmet, clear away your shit or Ill beat you to death with it, one of the women greets a small boy as the wedding party enters the house)  and the real groom, a man old enough to be her grandfather. Fatma, his wife, gently takes the young bride aside and explains that she has been brought there to serve as a sort of back-up: Fatma has cancer, and fears she may not survive the surgery she is to undergo.\n\nOn a practical level the children, most of them adults, understand what the father is doing, and that their mother fully supports it. But not all of them are able to accept it on a gut level. Ayse is made to feel excluded  the young women either insult her or ignore her, conversing in German, which she does not yet understand, glancing at each other conspiratorially, then disdainfully over at her like overgrown eighth-graders.\n\nAyse may be innocent but shes not stupid, and soon decides to make a life for herself outside the confined spaces expertly conveyed by Carsten Thieles intimate camera. Exploring the city, she finds a job in a convenience store and, having been deflowered by her tyrannical husband like a noxious weed, finds refuge under cover of darkness in the awkward but willing arms of the stock boy. As luck would have it, Fatma and the evil stepsisters need a seasoning for a dinner dish and make a hasty trip to the closed store, hoping they can convince the proprietor to open up for them. Lets just say that what they see offers them more than enough spice  and that Ayse winds up ... well, pick your favorite food analogy.\n\nYou can bet it would be a colorful one if the Caldwells of Morrison, Alabama were to pick it. In the Golden Bear-nominated Jayne Mansfields Car (USA/Russian Federation 2012), an all-star cast delivers Southern-fried one-liners with spunk and sass in a story whose raucous humor is never far from the pain derived from the directors personal recollections.\n\nOne, two, three, four, we dont want your fuckin war!\n\nMorrison, Alabama, 1969. A ragged but gung-ho troop of Vietnam war protesters march down main street, chanting their mantra and carrying the signs weve all seen on TV, or remember from being there, or reading or hearing about it. Leading them: the long-haired, mustachioed Korean War veteran son of the towns good ole boy sheriff, a wealthy cattle farmer whose antipathy for all son Carroll stands  and to his rage, publicly marches  for, results in a (decidedly one-sidedly) violent confrontation. Jim Caldwell dont take kindly to cowards.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, hed probably take even less kindly to his ex-wifes English husband; but this is different: Naomi has died, and her last wish was be buried back home in Morrison. Having heard many a tale over the years from Naomi about Jims terrifying temper, Kingsley Bedford is still willing, but wary.\n\nAnd Jim? When he gets that phone call from that place he last saw in uniform a quarter of a century ago, his inner Southern gentleman (eventually) comes to the fore, and he agrees to host the family. The humor lies in the attempts of the ex and his two adult children from a previous marriage to accommodate themselves not just to the American way, the Southern way, the Alabama way  but to the uncompromising Jim Caldwell way of life.\n\nThe director clearly had a ball making this film, but it also must have cost him dearly in emotional capital, not least because the character of Carroll, whose relationship with his father is so tormented, represents the director himself. In one scene, Carroll asks Jim why he never answered the letter Carroll sent him from Vietnam telling him how much he loved and admired him, and how proud he was to be his son. Not even looking up from his paperwork, Caldwell denies ever having received it. But my sister says she saw you reading it, Carroll insists. She lied, says Jim. But it is he who is lying.\n\nOlder brother Skip, a World War II pilot played by Thornton, not only seems spaced out, but is: Hes being regularly supplied with hard drugs by Carroll, who wants to help assuage both the physical pain his brother has suffered since his plane exploded in the sky, burning some 90 percent of his body, and the emotional drubbing he gets from the snide carping of the only Caldwell brother who never served in uniform.\n\nThe humor? Aside from the script being threaded with witticisms, some of which are funny precisely because the characters are unaware of it, as the film approaches its dénouement, one of the grandkids slips some acid into Caldwells drink. Blissfully wigged out, he and the drunk-as-a-skunk Kingsley go off hunting, becoming bona fide space cadets as the hallucinations intensify. Ironically, it is this wildly uncharacteristic episode, experienced with a stranger from across the ocean, that will result in the revelation of a profound truth to one close to him whom he has tried to push away.\n\nLike his films three-word title, the triple-threat director and screenwriter of Jayne Mansfields Car (the title comes from a traveling exhibit of the car that actress Jayne Mansfield drowned in that Caldwell takes his boys to see) also acted in it, and is also triple-named. In a wide-ranging exchange, Billy Bob Thornton spoke with surprising frankness about his film, the movie business, and his relationship with his own father, the model for the character of Jim Caldwell. Thornton told the packed press conference that his motivation for making this movie was his disillusionment with the current situation in Hollywood: to get financed, American films have to contain models in gladiator uniforms or be wacky comedies with kids who get caught with sheep in hotel rooms.\n\nSo instead of complaining, I decided to write a film and direct it, which Russian financing allowed him to do. Thornton skipped Sundance in favor of Berlin because Berlin is known as a place where the quality of the movies is paramount. Not, he added, the studio. In fact, Its the only [festival] we tried to get into, and were very honored to have been accepted. Perhaps that is why he felt comfortable speaking so openly about the experiences that served as inspiration for the film.\n\nMy father was a very violent Irishman, he began slowly. So there was abuse, both verbally and physically, in our household. His father, like Carroll, was a Korean War veteran, a very intense guy who I dont think I ever had a conversation with.\n\nTheres a scene in the movie where I ask him if he has any memories of me as a kid. To which he doesnt reply. And honestly, I dont remember ever having a conversation with my father  his words now poured out  and hed take my brother and me to car wrecks, and hed stand there and smoke Lucky Strikes for like two hours, and my brother and I were like, Why are we here? This is horrible  and that was how he connected with us. Thornton played baseball, which his father said was for weaklings  with the consequence that Ive spent my entire life trying to get the acceptance and approval of older men, including Robert Duvall and John Hurt. To this day.\n\nIf the remarks of the panel were any indication, he has certainly achieved it. His honesty was returned in the warmest way by his actors, including the 72-year-old John Hurt, who took turns extolling his directorial skill, sensitivity, patience and insight.\n\nIf you were to sum up in one sentence what this movie is about, said Thornton, its about the romanticism of tragedy, in a dramatic way, as well as the impact of war on those who serve and on their families. The movies bottom line is how we dont learn the lessons of the past, and how family members dont communicate; and if we dont communicate, we dont learn. Thorntons father died when he was 17; despite the beatings, the lack of communication, he loved him, and learned to understand him. What I finally realized, is that he did not have the capacity to express anything. So it came out the way it did. And that was a big driving force behind making the movie.\n\nProducer Alexander Rodnyansky recalled John Hurts telling him why he (Rodnyansky) liked the script so much: Because its like a Chekhov play. And he agreed. From the U.S. side, said producer Geyer Kosinski, Its all about storytelling. It was Chekhov for him. It was Tennessee Williams for us. What was essential was that everyone shared the same creative vision.\n\nAnd now, for the question that just had to be asked: With Thorntons ex-wife Angelina Jolie also screening a film here, Did you meet her here in Berlin?\n\nThorntons reply came so swiftly the exchange could have been scripted. Taking the question literally  it was asked by a non-native English speaker  Oh no, he assured the unsuspecting repo"
