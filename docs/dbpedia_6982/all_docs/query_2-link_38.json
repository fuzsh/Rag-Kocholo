        "text": "The Horse Whisperer Screenplay by Eric Roth Revised by Richard LaGravenese Screenplay by Erich Roth Based on the Novel by Nicholas Evans Revised by Richard LaGravenese Second Draft 1/21/97 FADE IN: A DREAM: INT. STABLES; PILGRIM'S STALL - MORNING Sunlit illuminates the darkened stable, highlighting the contours of a magnificent HORSE (PILGRIM) in surreal, dream- like imagery: his legs, his muscles, his sheen, his mane... his eyes. He shakes his head and stamps his feet. He seems confined. Eager to run. INT. STABLES - MORNING Pilgrim bursts through the stall and runs out the stables into a blinding white morning. EXT. AN OPEN FIELD LEADING TO WOODS - BRIGHT MORNING Whiteness. Snow and sky without any discernible line between. Camera is POV, as if on the horse, riding through the whiteness. Snow kicks up from the side. We hear the breathing of the horse. As we travel on hills, through trees, we experience of sense of wild, exhilarating freedom. We hear the giggles of a GIRL (GRACE) on the horse. An occasional line; GRACE (O.S.) Yeah, fly boy... that's it... go... go... go... END OF DREAM as we CUT TO: INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - MORNING Grace awakens, calmly. Takes a breath. Slides out of bed and stands before a window, overlooking a beautiful Connecticut country house. We see a snow-covered field and distant woods. Grace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window eager to get out. INT. MACLEAN NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING Alarm rings, ANNIE MACLEAN awakens. She shuts the alarm and scoots up in bed. She waits. Seconds later the television across the foot of her bed turns on from a timer -- to a CNN 24 NEWS channel. INT. HALLWAY/ANNIE & ROBERT'S BEDROOM - MORNING Grace, fully dressed except for her boots, tiptoes past a partially opened bedroom door. Her father ROBERT is asleep, alone, on his huge king size bed. INT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING Grace is putting on her boots on a bench beside a back door. She is wearing her mother's outfit. As she slides the boot on, we see behind her a row of framed photos -- Robert, Grace and Annie in happy times. She slaps a note on the refrigerator, with a magnet -- \"Gone riding. Back around 10. Love, G.\" EXT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE, BACK ENTRANCE - MORNING Grace slips on her jacket and hat as she comes down the steps, her feet hitting the walk... EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING Annie's feet hit the ground, running -- her breath showing in the cold air. She passes other joggers with ease. She crosses the street and heads for an elegant CPW building. INT. MACLEAN'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING Dressed in running clothes, Annie opens the door and picks up several newspapers that were delivered. She carries them into the kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications, magazines, papers, etc... Knowing she must read all of them at some point, she breathes a disgusted sign. She thumbs through the POST as she pours herself a cup of coffee. Something catches her eyes and she snarls: ANNIE That little shit! She dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as she talks: ANNIE Hi Lucy?... Did I wake you?... Have you read the Post?... They've got a little item about me and Fiske. He's saying I fired him and that I faked the new circulation figures.. Ha, ha... Oh, please... It's the last act of a desperate gnome... Set up a phone call with Don Farlow for 9:30... Throughout the phone call, Annie is selecting clothes, turning on the shower, undressing... EXT. DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING The snow has stopped falling. Grace walks along a hill, hands in pocket. Spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse farm, standing like statues in the white covered fields. As Grace comes along the hill, we see another GIRL (JUDITH) coming from the opposite direction. She doesn't have Grace's lean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her face. Upon reaching her, Grace returns the smile with a hug. JUDITH It's warmer than I thought. GRACE You want to go to a movie tonight? JUDITH I thought your mom's coming up? GRACE (prickly) So? Judith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, as they begin walking away from Camera... JUDITH My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger. GRACE Can I come? I'll start a fire... Judith laughs as they continue talking, their voices trailing off, as the girls head for the stables. INT. STABLES, THE DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING There are several horses in their stalls. Grace and Judith enter, talking, carrying their English saddles. Judith stops at a stall, disappearing into it as she says \"Hello?\"..., Grace continues to the end stall. Pilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her. GRACE Hello, beautiful boy. He's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition. She enters, touching his muzzle. He plays with her by nudging her back. GRACE Stop... Will you stop! EXT. DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING They lead their horses, now saddled and ready, from the barn. Pilgrim tosses his head, prancing, playing with the snow. GRACE Show-off. The girls mount the horses and ride off together. INT. ANNIE'S MAGAZINE OFFICE - MID-MORNING Annie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her magazine. She turns on the light, revealing a large row of stalls and glassed in private offices. Everywhere we look, we see indications of the kind of magazine she edits. She strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by windows. The office walls are covered with photos, most of which are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE. (One photo is of Annie's father MARTIN. A BRITISH AMBASSADOR with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately around his neck. Her mother stands right behind them, posing like a member of the royal family.) Annie sits and takes a breath. The only photo on her desk is a family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal Award -- Robert, Grace, herself and the Award. She checks her watch -- it is almost 9:30. INT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM/CLOSET - MID-MORNING A WALK-IN CLOSET of the master bedroom; one side is Annie's, one side is Robert's. Robert stands before his bureau in the closet -- he has just showered and is putting on his watch and ring which lay beside his cologne assortment. A FRAMED PHOTO OF HE AND ANNIE in India -- younger, vibrant, in love... when they first met. THE PHONE RINGS. Robert enters into the bedroom to pick up. ROBERT Hello? INSERT ANNIE: They speak in dulled, emotionless voices: ANNIE It's me. ROBERT Hi. ANNIE Hi. Awkward pause. ROBERT So, what, uh, what train are you taking? ANNIE I should be in by two. ROBERT Okay. You want me to pick you up? ANNIE Sure... What's Grace up to? ROBERT Riding with Judith. Beat. ANNIE I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone. ROBERT That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it. (beat) What do you want to do about dinner? ANNIE I don't know. We'll figure it out. Pause. There is a lot unspoken but understood between them. Annie's other phone line rings. Robert hears it as well. ROBERT Okay. We'll see you later then. ANNIE Yeah. Bye. Annie picks up the other line and her manner brightens, her energy boosts... ANNIE DON! My love, how are you? Did you hear about Fiske?... No, suing is too civilized. Can't we get your friend at Le Cirque to serve him a fatal piece of poached salmon?... Ha, ha... That's even better... EXT. CONNECTICUT COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING Long Shot of the girls riding at an easy pacing, talking all the time. Grace is an elegant rider, quite self-assured for a 13-year-old... We come into the scene at the moment the girls have just shared a secret or a fantasy. Judith is giggling uncontrollably. Grace laughs as she says: GRACE ...Oh, come on! You think the same thing! JUDITH I just could never say it! They stop at the end of the field, facing the woods. GRACE Do you want to go around by the old road? JUDITH Why don't we just cut through the woods? Grace nods. They ride into the woods, continuing their talk. EXT. WOODS - MORNING The girls ride down, along a stand of hickories and poplars to a RIVER. They stop the horses and their conversation, to listen to the sound of the water. Below them, off in the distance, they can just make out a two-lane country road. GRACE You want to go down or stay along the river? JUDITH We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back. They begin to make their way. INT. ANNIE'S OFFICE - MORNING Annie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees; sitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of chairs, against the walls... Paper bag emptied of bagels, cream cheese, orange juice, paper plates... Hand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it follows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how casual it all seems, Annie is very much at the center of control... We enter the scene of LAUGHTER, as Annie asks KEVIN, a feature writer: ANNIE ... So what did you say to her? KEVIN I said, thank you very much... (LAUGHTER, AD LIBS) I really should do the interview... But perhaps if you'd like to have dinner... LAUGHTER... Everyone starts Ad Libbing... VARIOUS CHARACTERS Dinner!!... He's so cute.... Why don't I get those kind of interviews?... Look, he has husband number eight written on his forehead... ANNIE All right, all right, all right... Kevin, good job. Write the interview. If I don't like it, you may have to sleep with her for a follow-up! (laughter) Now... I'm thinking about another fashion designer spread... Who's news out there? Characters shout out designer names and comments as the phone rings and LUCY picks up... speaking amdist the talking... LUCY Hold on. (presses hold) Gottschalk. The room goes dead quiet, instantly. Then erupts in laughter as everyone realizes it. Annie, however, waves her hand as she takes the phone... ANNIE Quiet... Quiet! Everyone obeys. Annie presses SPEAKER PHONE. ANNIE David? DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Who's there? ANNIE Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you. DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Did you speak to Farlow? ANNIE Yes. We're suing. DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story. ANNIE David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you? Silence. Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. Everyone waits. Covert looks between characters suggest this is interesting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the magazine's owner? Annie waits without a shred of anxiety -- even though she might have some. Finally: DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud... ANNIE Exactly... Everyone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING It's perfectly still. We are looking down an empty TWO-LANE ROAD covered with fresh snow. We see the girls slowly riding out of the woods, talking. They cross the road and start up into the woods on the other side... They are trying to sing a LIZ PHAIR song, \"CHOPSTICKS\" GRACE/JUDITH (singing) \"I met him at a party and he told me how he like to drive me home... He said he liked to do it backwards...\" GRACE (singing) \"... I said it--\" JUDITH (singing) \"... and I said that\"... GRACE (stops singing) No, wait, it just goes... \"he said he liked to do-\"... Suddenly there's the SOUND OF THE METAL OF JUDITH'S HORSE scraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow. Judith notices first... JUDITH What was -- The horse staggers... Judith looks to Grace -- JUDITH Grace! The horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet, kicking up sprays of snow and ice shards. The horse suddenly falls on the ice and goes down hard on its knees... GRACE JUDITH! The horse stumbles to get back on its feet, slipping again. Frightened, it rears and Judith, caught off balance, is thrown, her foot catching in the stirrup... JUDITH GRAAACE! Her horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward down the incline. GRACE PILGRIM, COME ON! MOVE! Grace, directly behind Judith, tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid being hit by the errant horse. What follows, we see from Grace's perspective. The details that form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast, disembodies, almost surreal as -- Judith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy slope. Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck. Judith, her leg helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head bouncing on the frozen ground. They slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD. Pilgrim is the first to find his legs and stand. Grace manages to sit up in the saddle. She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup. GRACE (frightened) Jude, you okay? JUDITH (softly, crying) I'm okay... I'm okay. She tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup. Grace sees it before she hears it. A GLINT off of steel. We then hear the rumbling SOUND of a TRUCK coming around the bend... The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road... The Truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes around the turn... Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get Judith's horse out of the road... The driver, seeing them, lays on the air horn. The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle slipping out of Grace's hand... GRACE JUUDE!!! ... The horses turn apart. The Driver starts furiously downshifting, trying to brake... He seems to get it under control when suddenly THE TRUCK SKIDS on some ice. It begins to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack- knifing. The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith and her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith disappearing under him. The truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim... Grace looks right into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly, Pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck. Pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his hooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some grotesque ornament. His head and chest slams into the window, shattering through the glass. And then it is still. The truck has stopped halfway in the road. Judith's horse lies in the road, motionless. Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. He shrieks, struggling to get to his feet. He manages to free his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods... The Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in shock. He sits on the ground. All we hear is the sound of the river and the wind in the trees. Grace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the beautiful morning sky. WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER... INT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER MORNING ANGLE ON GRACE'S NOTE on the refrigerator as Robert enters from the outside with two bags of groceries. He places them on the counter near the PHONE MACHINE. He sees ONE MESSAGE is there. He presses PLAY as he puts away the groceries. A BEAT LATER the PHONE RINGS and he picks up, with the machine still playing... ROBERT (on phone) Hello? Paul, hi -- are you guys back? How was it? Oh that sounds great. Oh Paul.. hold on... LIZ (on machine) Robert! Are you there?... Robert! It's Liz!... Look, there's... there's been an accident... Uh... Jesus... uh... As Robert listens, the voice of Liz's on the machine from inside, pulls his attention. On hearing \"accident,\" Robert lowers the receiver, frozen, as he listens to Liz... LIZ (on machine) Robert, just call me on my call phone... 1-917-449-7805... EXT. THE WOODS - LATE MORNING Pilgrim is hiding in the shadows under an old railroad bridge, standing up to his knees in the river. His chest is cut open, bleeding. His face cut, contorted and swollen. LIZ HAMMOND, the local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her jacket, quietly walking into the water. A Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water. He watches Liz. She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts, running upstream. The Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm. Frightened, Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo in his neck. He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of the river, the hypo still in his neck. He runs for the sanctuary of the woods. INT. TRAIN - LATE MORNING Annie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her, her cellular phone, ever-ready. The train passes through beautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial she's writing. The train pulls into a station and stops, causing Annie to take a break and stretch her arms and neck. She looks out the window for the first time and sees: A MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young children, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm around his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the father listens to every word. Annie doesn't even realize she is staring. As they leave the platform, she turns back to her laptop. As the train begins to move again, Annie returns to work. HER CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. She answers. ANNIE Yeah?... Hi. I made the 1:00 so... The expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic. INT. HOSPITAL, CONNECTICUT - DAY Annie is running through the corridors, her bags in tow. She sees Robert standing in the corridor talking to a DOCTOR. She runs for them. When she appears, Robert and the Doctor stop their conversation. Robert looks to Annie, who is waiting for news. ANNIE WHAT!? Robert is teary eyed, beaten down. ROBERT Judith's dead. Annie's horrified, waiting for news of Grace. ANNIE What about Grace? ROBERT She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging... DOCTOR But nothing we can't handle... ANNIE (impatient) Where is she now? DOCTOR Surgery. ANNIE Surgery! For what-? ROBERT (interrupting) Annie, her leg was shattered -- what they call the distal epi.. epi.. DOCTOR Distal epicondyle of the femur... ROBERT (quietly, crying) They have to take the leg off. Annie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet shock. We can tell her mind is racing, trying to process the information, until finally she asks: ANNIE Which leg? The Doctor and Robert are surprised by the question. ROBERT What difference does it make? Annie stares for a beat, then nods apologetically. EXT. WOODS - DAY Pilgrim is sedated, lying in his own blood in the snow, surrounded by Police and trackers. He is being attended to by LIZ HAMMOND, who is dictating to her assistant: LIZ ... His skull, cheek, and nose are severely fractured. He has a deep chest wound. I'm not even sure it can be closed. LOCAL TRACKER (deadpan, local accent) Animal should be put down -- anybody can see that. Liz looks up to him, resentfully, but knows he's right. INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Camera moves from Grace's face down her body to Robert's hand, which rubs her good leg. He looks at her lovingly, pushing the hair from her forehead. Annie, needing to do something, tenderly straightens Grace's blankets. It is plain to see where her leg had once been. Robert can't look. Annie, one to face her fears, bravely looks at it head on. She notices the I.V. Bag and rises on: ANNIE That bag's almost empty. ROBERT (looking) No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it. ANNIE (as she exits) Robert, you leave it up these people...! Robert is about to respond but Annie is already out the door. We hear the O.S. DIALOGUE as Robert listens. ANNIE (O.S.) Excuse me, my daughter needs a new I.V. NURSE (O.S.) We have her down, we'll be right in. ANNIE (O.S.) I'd like it taken care of now please. Annie enters first. ANNIE You have to keep on top of these people or else they just sit on their -- But Robert is ignoring her. Facing Grace, smoothing away her hair. He's giving her the silent treatment. Annie knows this means Robert doesn't approve of her dictatorial behavior. Annoyed, she turns away as well. The Nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old one as Robert backs away. ROBERT I'm sorry. ANNIE Tch. What are you -- Annie, about to respond to his inappropriate politeness, is stopped by Robert, who finally looks at her. It's a powerful look that tells her to calm down and shut up. It's a look that, for all of Robert's sensitivity, affects Annie. She gets the message and stays calm. As the nurse leaves, Annie is about to say thank you, but Robert beats her to it. ROBERT Thank you. Annie and Robert stand facing each other, when the PHONE RINGS. Annie picks up. INTERCUT EXT. WOODS - DAY LIZ HAMMOND on a cellular, walking away from the crowd. LIZ Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace? ANNIE (journalistic) Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control. LIZ Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim. Annie hears the name as if it's some distant echo she can't quite identify; Liz speaks quickly as Annie watches Grace breathing in her sleep -- LIZ It's not good. I've never seen an animal with these injuries still breathing. I know this is difficult to hear right now I'd like your permission to put him down. It's the really best thing we can do for -- That was too much information for Annie; ANNIE Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive... LIZ Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain... ANNIE Well, of course, right... ROBERT What is it? LIZ (overlapping) We really shouldn't wait... ANNIE (overlapping) Hold on, Liz... (to Robert) Something about Pilgrim... The Doctor pokes his head in. DOCTOR (overlapping) Mr. and Mrs. MacLean... ANNIE (overlapping) -- put him down. She says... ROBERT (overlapping, to Doctor) Yes. Hi. (to Annie) Tell her you'll call her back. He exits with the Doctor. ANNIE Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so -- LIZ (interrupting) I understand, but Annie, please... ANNIE (overlapping) - See, what you can do for him --... LIZ (overlapping) Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same. ANNIE ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- LIZ It isn't right to make him suffer... ANNIE And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! (Liz is quiet) I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? (softer) Please. Liz is stopped by Annie's almost pleading tone. LIZ All right... They hang up. Annie takes a breath. Robert re-enters. ANNIE What did he say? ROBERT Nothing new. He's just going off duty. Beat. Silence. ANNIE I'm going to get all the nurses' names... It's good to know all their names. Robert nods. But neither of them moves. They stand motionless for a beat, then Annie begins to break down and eases herself into Robert's arms. Robert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly comfort. His expression tells us it's the moment he's been expecting... and wanting. Now she'll be all right, in his arms. Whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment -- for Robert -- gone. But Annie's expression tells us something different. Her instinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the same anymore. Something doesn't feel right. Something isn't working anymore about his comforting embrace. ANNIE I should go get some of her things. ROBERT No, let me go. ANNIE (gently pushing away) No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up. INT. THE UNIVERSITY ANIMAL HOSPITAL, RECOVERY STALLS - NIGHT A line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals. Liz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall. There's a slight scratching sound. A hoof against the stall. It gets louder, awakening Liz. She gets up and looks inside the paddled stall: Pilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged. He is waking up. His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls. He looks at Liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to still be alive. INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM IN FARMHOUSE - NIGHT Annie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light. Camera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the bed and opens it. She begins her task with cool efficiency. Opening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken, what isn't necessary. Suddenly, she stops. She feels disoriented for a moment. She can't remember the last time she was inside this room. She takes a moment to pause and actually look around. In the light, we now see more of Grace's inner sanctum. Horse riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls. Books. A girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching towards adulthood. Annie examines some items, affectionately. A GOOD LUCK CHARM from India sits among her things. Annie takes it to pack in the suitcase. She notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop Pilgrim with Judith at her heel. She then notices the edge of another picture behind this one, in the frame. She pulls the Pilgrim photo out to reveal: An old 8X10 of Annie hugging Grace as a toddler. With her back to Camera, Annie remembers: MEMORY: INT. GRACE'S ROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED Annie is playing with toddler Grace. Chasing her around the room. Picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed. Blowing into her stomach. Grace is laughing uncontrollably. END OF MEMORY Annie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame, then returns to her task of packing. INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT Annie enters. No one else is there. She places the suitcase on a chair and opens it. She takes out the INDIAN LUCKY CHARM and some horse books, and places them on her bedside table. She takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm. She wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently wipes Grace's sweaty brow... INSERT VISUAL FLASHBACK HERE, instead of in Country House. Annie then continues unpacking the suitcase. She opens Grace's closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Grace's clothes at the time of the accident. Annie examines them and discovers they are hers. Annie shoves the clothes into a bag and starts unpacking. INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN The Clock is ticking on the wall. The cafeteria is empty except for one tired Intern, drinking coffee on a break. Robert and Annie are having a cup of coffee. In the silence, they search for things to say. Until: ROBERT I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... (Annie listens) I wanted to say something... (beat) But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter. ANNIE We're very lucky. ROBERT (nods) The funeral's on Friday. He rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he continues... ROBERT Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over... ANNIE Okay. ROBERT It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him... (returns to table, sits) ... Whether or not we were... (beat) ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch. Annie just nods. She senses Robert is looking for some kind of reassurance, but she can't give it to him. He continues; ROBERT ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria? ANNIE Oh. Right. I'll call him. Pause. Annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the side, deep in his thoughts. She can sense he's sinking as he fidgets with the napkins. She remembers: MEMORY: INT. A SMALLER APARTMENT, KITCHEN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED A younger Annie stands in a bathrobe, noticeably pregnant, cooking at a stove -- reading instructions from a propped up cookbook. FRANK SINATRA IS BLASTING as she sings along, in full voice, without inhibitions; ANNIE \"SHE'S LOVES THE THEATRE BUT NEVER COMES LATE... SHE NEVER BOTHERS WITH PEOPLE SHE HATES... THAT'S WHY THE LADY IS A TRAMP!...\" A younger Robert, wearing a suit, arrives home from work. Seeing her, he smiles affectionately. He puts down his briefcase and bursts into his own playful Sinatra impersonation: ROBERT \"She loves the free...\" Startled, Annie turns around and smiles: ROBERT (sexily undoing his tie) \"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'... ANNIE (a la fan) Sing it to me, Frankie! ROBERT (a la Sinatra cool) How's my pregnant chick! She moves to him and they embrace... He wraps his arms around her. They kiss. Annie laughs. ANNIE You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early. ROBERT I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs. ANNIE (loving it) Aw... that's so sweet. ROBERT I love you. ANNIE Do you? Do you really? They turn to each other and kiss. END OF MEMORY. INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN Annie and Robert sit silently at the table in an empty hospital cafeteria, a lifetime later. INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYBREAK The room's lights are dimmed. Dawn is being to break through. Grace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation. She takes a moment to figure out where she is... to remember. She uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady and knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the Good Luck Charm from India off the table. It rolls under the bed, with a water tumbler. Grace never sees the Charm. Grace looks where her leg once was. She feels the blanket, the empty space where her leg once was... just like her mother did (did her father couldn't). Instead of self-pity, she's oddly fascinated. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY Daylight pours in. Robert and Annie enter. Robert, loaded with gifts, immediately crosses to Grace, on the side of her good leg. Annie takes her position beside the lost leg. Robert kisses his daughter; ROBERT Hi, sweetheart... Annie's hand finds Grace's hand, and holds one of her fingers tightly. Grace responds by wrapping her hand around her mother's. They exchange a look of respect and gratitude. GRACE Have you heard from Judith's parents? ROBERT No, not yet. GRACE How's Pilgrim doing? ANNIE Liz is taking care of him. (to change the subject) The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can -- GRACE I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!! Annie, slightly hurt, drops it as Robert takes over: ROBERT The doctor said whenever you're ready. Take your time. You tell us... But he thinks it'll only be a few months, then -- As Robert continues talking, Annie drifts to the Nurse. Needing to manage something, she asks: ANNIE Did you get her fresh towels? SOME TIME LATER: EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY A limousine drives up as the Doorman gets the car door. The weather is slightly warmer. People's clothing looks as if spring is coming nearer. Annie exits first, carrying a jacket for Grace. She is followed by Robert, who immediately turns to help Grace. We hear her O.S. GRACE (O.S.) Dad! I can do it, OK?! ROBERT OK, OK. Annie shoots him a disapproving look. We see Grace's good leg exit first... then two crutches, followed by... a PROSTHETIC LEG. Grace scoots into view, and takes a breath. GRACE You all go ahead. I'll be up by Christmas. INT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT The three sit at a dinner table, eating dinner. Grace picks at her food. Robert can't help staring at her. Annie eats, watching them both. ROBERT Do you want something else, honey? We order something else? GRACE No, I'm just not that hungry. ANNIE Why don't you go lie down? GRACE I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough. ROBERT You want to watch some television? GRACE (edgy) Maybe... look -- just... Robert and Annie wait. She doesn't continue. She rises, reaching for her crutches. Robert moves to help. GRACE I got it! I got it! She exits into her room. Annie looks at him disapprovingly. INT. ANNIE AND ROBERT'S BATHROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT Annie and Robert stand before their separate sinks, talking to each other through their separate mirrors, as they wash up for bed. ANNIE You've got to stop doing that? ROBERT Doing what? ANNIE Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time. Robert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word. He exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed. For a beat, he stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly. ROBERT You know, Annie, this didn't just happen to you. Annie is applying moisturizer when she hears this. As it sinks in, she doesn't like it. INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Grace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled, tense voices. Annie is angry at his complacency. Robert just wants what's best for Grace. She closes the door. Silence. She puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk towards her bureau without them. It is a struggle, but she does... almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time. The 8X10 of her and Pilgrim, falls face down. She props it up and looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on Judith. Suddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the floor... ROBERT (O.S.) Honey, you all right? Did something fall? GRACE (angrily shouts) NO! EXT. GRACE'S PRIVATE SCHOOL - MORNING Annie pulls up in a Range Rover and stops. Grace moves for the door. Annie asks respectfully; ANNIE Do you want any help? Grace doesn't even bother to answer. She manages to get onto the pavements, then turns for her bag... Annie notices other kids looking at Grace from behind, as they enter the school. ANNIE Dad'll pick you up today, all right? GRACE Okay. Grace looks up to her mother. What is unspoken between them is the understanding that today will be difficult and there's nothing either one can do about it. ANNIE You'll be fine. Grace nods and turns to the school. Annie watches her go. INT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - MORNING Grace makes her way through the hall. It is the first time she has had to maneuver through a crowd. Some of the younger children are especially unconscious. Grace sweats her way through, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity. As Grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had that she could get through this day, begins to diminish. INT. ANNIE'S OFFICE - DAY Annie moves about the office, hands in pocket, in front of her wall of windows. LUCY and her staff sitting around the office. Annie is speaking to a YOUNG WOMAN staff member; ANNIE I don't care what he told you! The man's a liar! The man's an actor, for Christ's sake. They're all liars! They'll say anything to get a cover... The Young Woman looks insulted. AN ASSISTANT comes in to give Annie a note; EXT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - DAY Annie is crossing an empty school yard. Grace is sitting on the ground, her back against a wall, her \"legs\" in front of her. She has been crying. She looks up to her mother. GRACE It's too hard. Annie kneels before her sympathetically brushing her hair away: ANNIE Oh, honey... What happened? GRACE Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all. ANNIE (softly) Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what -- GRACE (snaps) I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home! ANNIE Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well... GRACE Is that your version of a pep talk? ANNIE You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. GRACE (snotty) Fine! ANNIE It's still early. What's your next class? With secret delight, Grace viciously utters the word: GRACE Gym! INT. ANNIE AND ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Annie is at her desk studying Grace's book on Horse Whisperers. Robert is on his bed with briefs laid out before him. INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT The door is closed. A SONG blares on her stereo. Grace is in her bed watching a video of her and Pilgrim... riding at a horse show. There's a shot of Annie standing proudly, watching her ride. Another shot of her and Judith, both of them on their horses, waving to camera. INT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT Grace enters. GRACE Dad? Both Robert and Annie look up. ROBERT What, sweetheart? GRACE (beat) I want to see Pilgrim. Robert and Annie exchange an anxious look. EXT. DYER HORSE FARM, CONNECTICUT - DAY It's raining. The MacLean car is parked by the barn. They are walking towards the stables under their umbrellas as Liz runs to greet them. LIZ Hello... (to Grace) It's so good to see you. How ya doing? ROBERT She's doing just grea. Aren't you kiddo? GRACE I'm fine. LIZ Well, come on. He's out back now... (leads them) Mind how you go. It's pretty muddy back there. GRACE Why is he in the back? Why isn't he in the barn with the other horses? Liz stops, causing everyone to stop. She turns to face Grace, realizing she doesn't know. She looks at Robert and Annie, accusingly. She tries to explain: LIZ Well, Grace, you see... Pilgrim just... isn't the same horse he used to be. (to the parents) As a matter of fact, maybe now's not the best time to -- GRACE I really want to see him. Liz looks at Annie. Annie nods. Liz leads them on. They reach a row of empty old stalls. They cross to one of the stalls -- its doors are closed. Liz draws back the bolt on top half of the door. There is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall, the sound of fear, startling them. Then it's still. Liz slowly opens the door. Grace, with the aide of her cane, walks to the stall. She hesitates, then looks in. It takes a moment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark. She sees Pilgrim with his head down in the shadows... GRACE Hello, beautiful boy... He lifts his head at the sound of her voice. Grace, and the audience, see him for the first time -- His mad eyes, his terrible disfigurement... Grace cries out, stepping backwards, nearly stumbling in the mud... What is left of her horse are gone. Annie realizes what's happened and, together with Robert, rush to her... They too see the monster Pilgrim has become and are horrified. Grace angrily pushes away from them and \"runs\" off. Robert goes after her. Annie is standing in the rain with Liz -- her eyes unable to move away from the sight of Pilgrim. LIZ (O.S.) You should have told her, Annie. I tried to explain to you how bad it was... I guess you had to see it. But, there's nothing to be done. This animal's beyond help. Annie, can I have your permission now to put him down? Annie stands in the rain, hands in pocket, fixed on Pilgrim and more determined than ever; ANNIE No. EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT Alone in her study, Annie sits before her computer searching the Internet for information on HORSES -- Veterinarian Journals, Therapies, Accidents, Eistories... We sense she's been at it a while... She locates an ITEM TITLE -- HORSE WHISPERERS. Interested, she brings it up on the screen. INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT Annie sits in the huge reading room, books spread out before her, under a green reading lamp. Her voice tells us what she's reading: ANNIE (V.O.) \"It was in America that horses first roamed...\" In the books, we see pictures, lithographs, paintings and drawings... ANNIE (V.O.) \"A million years before the birth of man, they grazed the vast empty plains of grass and crossed to other continents over bridges of rocks... They first knew man as the hunted knows the hunter, for long before man saw horses as a means to killing other beasts, man killed them for meat...\" ANNIE'S V.O. CONTINUES OVER; INT. PILGRIM'S STALL - NIGHT ANNIE (V.O.) \"...The alliance with man would forever be fragile -- for the fear he'd struck into their hearts was too deep to be dislodged... Since that Neolithic moment when a horse was first haltered, there were those among men who understood this...\" INT. GRACE'S ROOM - NIGHT Grace sits alone in her darkened room, staring out the window but not looking at anything. There's a discomforting distance in her expression. ANNIE (V.O.) \"... They could see into the creature's soul and soothe the wounds they found there...\" DISSOLVE TO: EXT. A FAIRGROUNDS PARKING LOT, CALIFORNIA - DAY A hot, dusty fairgrounds horse arena. The worn wooden bleachers, crowded. Lines of cars and pick-up trucks. ANNIE (V.O.) \"...For secrets uttered softly into troubled ears, these men were known as The Whisperers...\" One particular pick-up truck has its back door opened. A MAN'S LEG is sticking out, putting on a pair of boots. A moment later the Man gets out of the car. Holding a cowboy hat, he has a certain quality, a self-respect, that men who know themselves seem to have. TOM BOOKER. A weathered redheaded woman named RONA -- late forties, strong, wiry horsewoman's build -- is walking towards him. RONA Hey, darlin'. TOM Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late. RONA I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time. They walk together towards the fairgrounds. TOM You're looking fit. RONA Fit? You want to check my teeth. (Tom laughs) Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? TOM If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might. RONA (playful) Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for. TOM Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck. Rona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena. EXT. HORSE ARENA, CALIFORNIA - DAY Inside the corral, a small black thoroughbred is being worked by Tom. As he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to the crowd, we sense this is a man of good humor and great skill -- guileless, sensible, of the earth. TOM ... It's always kind of interesting to hear the horse's side of the story... The crowd laughs warmly. He directs his comments to a WOMAN wearing an expensive Ralph Lauren western outfit, standing outside the corral... TOM Now if he was cranky or lazy, like you say he is, we'd be seeing his tail twitching there and his ears back, maybe. But this isn't a cranky horse, it's a scared horse. You see how braced he is up around the neck back there. He just doesn't know which way to turn... The Woman nods. Tom turns the horse on a dime so that he always stays facing the circling thoroughbred... TOM You see how he keeps pointing his hindquarters in at me? Well, I'd guess the reason he seems reluctant to move out is because when he does, he gets in trouble for it. THE WOMAN He's not good at transitions, you know? When I want him to move from a trot to a lope, say... TOM (smiles) Well, I'm sure that's what you think but that's not what I'm seeing. You may think you're asking for a lope, but your body may be saying something else altogether. You might be putting too many conditions on him. For instance, you might be saying \"GO, but, hey, don't go too fast.\" He can tell that from the way you feel. Your body can't lie. You ever give him a kick to make him move out? THE WOMAN He won't go unless I do. TOM And then he goes and you feel like he's going too fast, so you yank him back? (she nods) And next thing you know, he's bucking. (she nods again) Well, if someone told you to go, stop, go, stop -- you'd buck too. The people laugh. The Woman smiles self-consciously. TOM It's a dance, see... Somebody has to lead and somebody has to follow. Tom gracefully moves his horse around the ring, \"dancing\". He then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the coils slap against the black horse's flank, making it burst into a lope. And again... Making the animal go from a trot to a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again. TOM I want him to get so he can leave real soft. He's getting the idea now. He's not all braced up and tense like he was at the start. He's finding out it's okay. He throws the rope again and this time the transition to the lope is a smooth one. TOM You see that? He's getting better already. Pretty soon, if you work at it, you'll be able to make all these transitions easy on a loose rein. (sotto voce, wry) Yeah, and pigs'll fly. (to Woman) He's going to be okay -- so long as you don't go yanking on him. She nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish. He walks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and speaks sympathetically: TOM Look, the truth is it's all about self- preservation. These animals. (with great affection) ... well, they just have such big hearts, you know? There's nothing they want more than to do what you want them to do. But when the messages get all confused, the only thing they know to do is try and save themselves... Now, why don't you go saddle up and see what happens. Feeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfelt man's man, the Woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb over the rail. Her horse lets her come right up to him and stroke his neck. Tom comments; TOM They won't ever hold a thing against you. They're the most forgiving creatures God ever made. Turning on his mike and turning back to the crowd, he says: TOM Okay, who's next? A Young Boy leads a mule into the ring. Tom smiles: TOM Now God has another idea entirely with the mule. EXT. THE FAIRGROUNDS - LATER THAT DAY Tom has finished his \"show.\" People are shaking his hand, thanking him, as he walks away from the corral, towards a trailer. The Woman in the Ralph Lauren approaches: WOMAN Excuse me. He faces the Woman: WOMAN Hi. I'm Dale. I just wanted to -- I can't get over the way he felt under me after you'd finish with him. Everything had just, I don't know, freed up or something. The Woman is flirting. Tom shrugs, uncomfortably; TOM Well, that'll happen. WOMAN Where did you learn all this stuff? TOM What stuff is that? WOMAN About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders? TOM (getting the message) Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts. WOMAN What do you mean? TOM Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. (smiles) That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up. He leaves her, entering the trailer. INT. RONA'S TRAILER - NIGHT A small, well-used trailer. Tom and Rona are finishing dinner like comfortable old friends. Rona rises, taking the plates into the kitchen and starts rinsing them: RONA Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up. TOM I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up. RONA The number's by the phone. He nods but doesn't move. He just looks at Rona and smiles. She's a good woman. But Tom hopes she doesn't want anymore than what they have together. Rona notices him looking and smiles: RONA What are you looking at, young man? TOM How long were you married? RONA Long enough. TOM You ever miss it? RONA Does a horse miss a saddle? TOM Sometimes. She chuckles, shuts the water off and crosses back to him, sitting beside him. RONA Well as a matter of fact, I don't... most of the time. She starts unbuttoning his shirt. TOM You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together. RONA Honey... I was always good. Tom smiles as Rona leans in. They kiss. INT. ANNIE'S OFFICE, N.Y.C. - MORNING Annie is looking over a magazine cover with Lucy and her staffers. She is unhappy. ANNIE You know it's perfectly shot, it's perfectly cropped, it's perfectly laid out and I'm so bloody bored, I'd rather buy a Motor Racing magazine -- Start over. Some general whines and groans as her assistant hands her a note. ANNIE Uh, would you all excuse me a moment? She waits for them to leave as she sits before the phone. One of her lines is lit: EXT. A ROADSIDE SERVICE STATION SOMEWHERE IN UTAH - DAY An endless sky. An empty ribbon of two-lane highway in Utah. A small roadside station. Tom's pick-up truck, his horse trailer hitched to it, getting gas. Tom is on the pay phone. We hear Annie's voice: ANNIE (O.S.) This is Annie MacLean. TOM Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called. INTERCUT ANNIE in her office: ANNIE (efficient, expeditiously) Oh! Yes. Thank you for calling back. Uh, all right, let me try to explain my situation as briefly as possible... You see, my daughter had an accident with her horse... They were both injured and she, my daughter, she hasn't been able to... fully... uh... It was an extremely traumatic experience... and uh... Tom, sensing her turmoil, listening compassionately. ANNIE I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized -- TOM Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems. ANNIE Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. (trying to be charming) I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly -- TOM Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing. ANNIE Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner... TOM Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of... ANNIE (interrupts, abruptly) I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class. TOM (getting impatient) Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City? Annie is taken aback. Tom feels badly. TOM I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them. ANNIE Mr. Booker, if I could just ex -- TOM I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now. He hangs up before Annie can continue. INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Annie reaches for Grace's bedroom door, then pauses. She realizes she should knock. She does and whispers: ANNIE Grace? (knocks again) Grace, it's mom. Annie slowly opens the door. She finds Grace's bed empty. She looks over to the window to find Grace sitting in a chair, in the dark, looking out the window. ANNIE Grace. What are you doing? Not looking up, Grace speaks in a hollow voice. GRACE I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India. ANNIE I brought it to you in the hospital. GRACE No, you didn't. ANNIE Grace, I put it on the table near your -- GRACE (apathetic) Doesn't matter. Beat. ANNIE Have you decided about Pilgrim? GRACE What about him? ANNIE Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down... GRACE I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that. ANNIE I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it. GRACE Mom? ANNIE Yeah? GRACE Maybe they should put me down too. ANNIE What? GRACE I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me? What frightens Annie most is the calm and apathy in Grace's voice. She's surrendering... Annie, for the first time in a long time, feels she's losing control. INT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT Annie sits alone at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of wine. Robert enters and sits opposite her, wearing a tuxedo -- his tie and collar undone. ANNIE How was the dinner? ROBERT (wry) All our \"favorite\" people were there saying all their \"favorite\" things about their \"favorite\" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with. ANNIE Why did you go? ROBERT (surprised) They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there. He drinks Annie's wine as she looks at him. ROBERT Did you get a hold of that horse guy? ANNIE Yeah. ROBERT What did he say? ANNIE No. Robert nods. Accepting. Silence. Annie sips her wine. Then: ROBERT I was thinking... Maybe we should think about the three of us going someplace warm... Remember that house we rented in Bermuda... The pink one with the -- His arm accidentally spills the wine. ROBERT Shit. As he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, Annie watches Robert clean the spill. Something about his movements, his posture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having the inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing over the rough sports -- strikes her hard. Annie realizes the love she feels for Robert isn't fading. It's gone. He finishes cleaning and sits. ROBERT What was I saying? ANNIE About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses... Robert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea. He nods, again, getting the message. Silence. In that silence, Annie looks at him... and makes a decision: ANNIE Robert, I want to take Pilgrim out to Mr. Booker. Drive him out to Montana... With Grace. Robert is confused... and a little worried. ROBERT I don't understand. You just said he said no. ANNIE He did, but... I think I can change his mind. ROBERT That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not. ANNIE Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her. ROBERT (at a loss) NO! What are you -- you're serious about this? ANNIE I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way... ROBERT (overlapping) You've already made arrangements!? ANNIE No. I was just researching. Calm down. ROBERT I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave... ANNIE I'm not asking you to. I'll do it. ROBERT You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the -- ANNIE He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride. ROBERT (overlapping) What... Bo-... What about the magazine? ANNIE I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer... Beat. Robert fears this is about the marriage. Yet -- ROBERT No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea ANNIE Why?! ROBERT (searching) Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability... ANNIE I can't say he's been all that effective with her. ROBERT Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time. ANNIE I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will. ROBERT I'm not pretending anything! Beat. Robert just stares at her. He looks concerned... almost worried. Annie gets uncomfortable. ANNIE What? It is very difficult for Robert to say; ROBERT I thought... well, ever since the accident, I just thought we... He stops. Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he doesn't continue. He doesn't. A thick silence hangs between them. ROBERT I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary. ANNIE (frustrated) Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. (he listens) I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it! Robert can feel the strength of her will. He can find no way around it. ROBERT What if she doesn't want to go? ANNIE She will if you think she should. ROBERT And you think it's best if I don't come. ANNIE (hesitates) No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right. At some moment, they realize Grace is standing at the entrance to the kitchen. They are surprised. GRACE I'm not going! I don't care what she says! Annie lowers her head. Robert stares at Grace as she walks to him. GRACE Daddy?... I don't want to go. Grace stands next to Robert. He holds her hands. Annie looks at him, without sympathy. Robert looks back. In his face is the total acceptance of what must be. As well as the sadness of it's inevitability. He looks back at his daughter, whose eyes have never left him. EXT. JOAN DYER STABLE - DAY Pilgrim is being loaded into the trailer by four strong stable men, violently kicking and pulling all the way. Annie watches with anxiety -- an almost giddy Liz by her side. ANNIE Maybe we should give him another sedative. LIZ Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case? ANNIE Of course not. LIZ Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio. In the back seat of ANNIE'S SUBURBAN sits Grace -- her back to the action. Hearing Pilgrim's struggle. Putting her walkman on her ears and raising the volume... We hear -- GRACE'S MUSIC, ON THE SOUNDTRACK, bringing us to: EXT. A HIGHWAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA - DAY Annie's Suburban drives along Route 80, pulling the horse trailer behind. INT. SUBURBAN - DAY Grace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to her music (maybe LIZ PHAIR OR HOLLY COLE). Detached. Non- committal. As trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement, she reacts and turns to the other window. Annie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road and her rear-view mirror -- checking on Grace. EXT. HIGHWAY IN - EARLY MORNING The Suburban drives as the sun begins to set. EXT. MOTEL IN OHIO - NIGHT The Suburban and Horse Trailer are parked in the lot. INT. MOTEL ROOM, OHIO - NIGHT A small furnished motel room with two twin beds. Grace sits up in bed watching TV, with no expression. A sitcom with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug. Annie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her hair. Grace doesn't bother to look up. ANNIE You want to take your bath? (Grace shakes her head) We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to -- GRACE Fine -- I'll take my bath. She begins moving off the bed. ANNIE No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough -- GRACE -- enough time tomorrow. I know. ANNIE Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine. GRACE (interrupts on \"fine\") I don't care. Annie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also realizes there's no talking to Grace now. So, she achieves her goal -- JANNIE Take it now. Grace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the door. INT. MOTEL ROOM IN OHIO - NIGHT The lights are off. Annie lays in bed, wide awake. It is the middle of the night. Grace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering. She's having a bad dream. Annie rises -- considering whether or not to intercede... Finally, Grace begins to cry out... softly at first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in fear... Annie appears right by her side. ANNIE What, sweetheart? What? Shaken, Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at that moment. She wraps her arms around her, tightly, and tries to catch her breath. ANNIE It's sleeping in a strange bed, that's all. Happens sometimes. It's Ok. It's OK. EXT. ANOTHER ROAD, MID-WEST - DAY The Suburban continues its journey. Once again -- Annie, in the front, and Grace, in the rear, drive without a word between them. INT. SUBURBAN - DAY Grace and Annie occupy their same positions. Annie is on the car phone with her office. ANNIE Okay, listen -- let's do this. When I get to the next motel, I'll see if they have a fax. If not, I'll call you tomorrow to -- Annie continues O.S. when we hear a shifting, a rocking in the trailer behind them. As if Pilgrim made a sudden move. Grace quickly turns her head. Annie looks in the rear view at Grace. ANNIE Uh Lucy, look, I have to go. OK... Later. Annie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror. Grace reaches for her walkman and headphones. Annie offers; ANNIE Grace! GRACE! Grace lowers one side of her headphones; ANNIE Would you like to put your music on up here? Grace shrugs. Annie shrugs it off as well. Grace replaces the headphone. Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or gospel or religious talk shows... She shuts it off. Frustrated, Annie looks up ahead and sees: A TRUCK STOP DINER Annie yells to be heard through the headphones; ANNIE IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!? GRACE (shrugs) Whatever you want. ANNIE Fine! GRACE Fine. Annoyed, Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to herself -- ANNIE Fine! She exits the car, banging the door. As she walks acrund the car to help Grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper: ANNIE \"Whatever you want!\" Well, this is what I want. I want to eat lunch and I want to smoke a cigarette and I want to keep talking to myself for the next two thousand fucking miles...\"! She opens Grace's door. Grace senses her mother's anger. INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - DAY Annie and Grace enter. They look around: Formica floors, truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed into booths or at the counter. There is not a single space available. Annie and Grace stand near the entrance. Another Trucker enters and they step aside, huddled together in this foreign land. INT. MOTEL IN IOWA - NIGHT Grace and Annie enter the room to find A DOUBLE BED instead of two twins. Neither comments. Annie exits O.S., carrying the bags inside, as she says: DISSOLVE TO: ANNIE You should call your dad before it gets too late. GRACE I already did. (Annie's surprised) This morning. When you went running. ANNIE Oh. You didn't tell me. GRACE I didn't know I had to. ANNIE (stares angrily, speaks softly) You don't. Silence. Annie exits past her to the car. DISSOLVE TO: LATER Grace is asleep in her twin bed. Once again, Annie is wide awake. The clock reads: 4:55 AM. But Annie can not sleep. Camera moves away from Annie, past her side of the bed, to the other side of the room. WE SEE THE SHADOW OF A WOMAN coming towards the bed. She comes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed, which has now transformed into -- A BED FROM THE PAST, IN WHICH A TEN-YEAR-OLD ANNIE IS SLEEPING WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER GEORGE. WE ARE IN MEMORY. The Woman gently shakes little Annie awaken. WOMAN Annie... Annie, sweetheart... wake up. The little girl, with sleep in her eyes, turns and sees her. WOMAN Bad news I'm afraid. Your Daddy's gone. END OF MEMORY. Annie, in present time next to Grace, thinks of this as she stays awake. Putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown, she goes outside. EXT. IOWA MOTEL - NIGHT She crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer. She looks in through the siding at Pilgrim, checking on him. She sees he is caught his halter on the side of the van. She crosses to the trailer door, hesitates, then opens it. Pilgrim looks at her. Gathering her courage, she climbs inside. He is still, looking at her. She carefully frees his halter. And suddenly he bares his teeth, biting at her. She stumbles back out of the trailer, slamming the door shut. She stands leaning against the trailer -- wondering if she's out of her mind for attempting this. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. IOWA MOTEL - LATER THAT SAME MORNING Annie is returning from her jog, sweating. As she crosses to her motel room, she stops by the window, looking in to see: Grace, on the floor, straining to do her exercises. Annie fills with compassion for her girl -- reminded of the struggle she faces everyday. EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY In the distance, the Suburban and horse trailer look like a dot on the horizon, moving across the Badlands. INT. THE SUBURBAN - ANOTHER TIME, DUSK Grace leans against the window in the back, in one of her darker moods. Annie switches radio stations, from Bible thumping to Farm reports. She shuts it off. Silence. She sees a ROAD SIGH: \"LITTLE BIGHORN NATIONAL MONUMENT\". ANNIE Grace, look! Grace reads the sign. ANNIE Would you like to see that? GRACE I don't care. ANNIE (overlapping) I don't care. Annie's comic mimicking, throws Grace off center. Annie turns off onto the exit. They drive by a massive casino -- it's neon sign flickering. They drive up a hill past a cafe, two Indians in high crowned Cowboy hats standing outside of the cafe. She drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the Monument... ANNIE This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this. GRACE You were never thirteen, Mom. Annie laughs, taking it as a joke. Grace almost smiles. But, Annie drives up to sign only to find a CLOSED SIGN. The park was closed at six. Annie stops the car. She's hit a brick wall once more. Silence. Finally, Grace speaks with her usual sarcasm; GRACE Great idea. So now what? Beat. Annie's patience snaps; ANNIE How long is this going to go on? GRACE What? ANNIE You know what I mean? (turns to the back seat) Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on? Ignoring her, Grace edges to the passenger side and exits the car. Annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as she speaks: ANNIE Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you? GRACE What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it! She begins to turn away. Annie grabs her arm. ANNIE Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you! GRACE Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something! ANNIE I don't believe this! GRACE You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it! ANNIE That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this. GRACE You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! (Annie is stopped) You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to. ANNIE Did he tell you that? GRACE He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him. ANNIE That's not true! GRACE Then why do you want to leave? ANNIE It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers. GRACE No, you just act like you do. Annie is choked with fury. She doesn't know whether to scream, cry or strangle Grace. She turns away and begins walking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees. She comes to a CEMETERY enclosed by a black railing. At the crest of the hill there's a stone monument \"The Little Bighorn Cemetery.\" In the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides below her, white tombstones. A place of sorrow. A cool breeze ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets. Frustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what action to take -- Annie, for the first time in frozen, standing still -- and with her, comes a rush of emotion. She sits with her back against the monument and begins to weep. For Grace, for Robert, herself, for the tombstones, for everyone. A FLASHLIGHT shines on her face. It is a PARK RANGER. PARK RANGER You okay, ma'am? ANNIE (wipes face) Yes. Fine. PARK RANGER That young lady is getting a little worried. Annie realizes she left Grace alone as it got darker. ANNIE I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Annie rises and is escorted back to the Suburban by the Ranger. She sees: Grace is sitting in the front seat now, waiting for her -- like a little girl lost. INT. SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS Annie gets into the driver's seat. Buckles up. Grace holds back tears. ANNIE You buckled up? (Grace nods) You cold? GRACE Little. Annie reaches into the back seat and pulls a blanket out, handing it to Grace, making sure it covers her. Grace turns towards the window and closes her eyes. Annie starts the car. EXT. MONTANA, BACK ROAD - MORNING C.U. on Pilgrim's head in the trailer as we PULL BACK to reveal the Suburban coming down an empty, seemingly infinite stretch of two-lane road in Montana. INT. SUBURBAN - MORNING Annie and Grace, both in front seats, eating doughnuts and coffee. They stop. POV -- Through the windshield is an endless sky and a rolling sea of land. GRACE Gee, this looks like a fun place. ANNIE Don't they believe in signs here? GRACE What would they say? \"Ten miles to big rock.\" \"Twenty miles to bigger rock.\" ANNIE There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it? GRACE I didn't see it. Their Suburban is the only vehicle on what seems like miles of road. Annie sighs and puts the Suburban in drive. EXT. PETERSON'S MOTEL & STABLES, RED FORK MONTANA - DAY The Suburban and the horse trailer, pulls into Peterson's -- a collection of motel cottage adjacent to an expanse of land that includes stable, corral, a main house and various riding trails into the mountains. Mr. Peterson runs out from the main house to greet Annie as she gets out of the car. INT. SUBURBAN, ON ANOTHER MONTANA BACK ROAD - LATER THAT DAY Annie, showered and changed, is trying to follow Mr. Peterson's directions to Tom's ranch -- written on Peterson motel stationary. She is lost once again. ANNIE (reading) ... after left, stay on main road until rise, then... (frustrated) What bloody rise?!? What main road!? She stops the Suburban (no longer carrying the trailer). EXT. ANOTHER MONTANA BACK ROAD - CONTINUOUS From outside the Suburban, we see, but cannot hear, Annie hitting the steering and cursing in frustration. INT. SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS Annie, panting, looks ahead and sees nothing but empty space, above and below -- as if the earth and sky met with nothing in between. She sighs and starts the car again. As she moves forward, she senses an almost indistinguishable rise in the road -- as we follow her POV up the road through the windshield to reveal: POV -- A BREATHTAKING VALLEY just beyond the rise, hidden from view only a few yards before. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH sits nestled in the valley, a few miles away. Annie is impressed. EXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANGE - DAY Men are working in the corral, saddle horses standing nearby, trying to get a sick calf to suckle a cow. One of the men is Tom Booker, working along side his brother FRANK, and his nephew, JOE. Frank is a good man -- solid work ethic, Christian fearing, wry sense of humor. With the build of a football player, his strength never overwhelms his boyish, good-natured heart. Joe is eleven, wearing his cowboy hat like a badge of honor. The three men seem as inseparable to each other, as they are to the land. As they work: JOE Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad? FRANK Sure. As long as she don't mind. JOE There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him. Tom and Frank don't say anything. Just nod, knowingly. JOE He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on. FRANK That's what some folks say. JOE There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow. (to Tom) You hear 'bout that, Uncle T? TOM Yeah, I hear about that. JOE Well, what do you think about that stuff? TOM Well, Joe, I'll tell ya -- I don't know a whole lot about geese. Maybe it's okay for them to grow up thinking they're airplanes. But horses, as far as I can tell, can't fly. Frank laughs. Joe smirks as Tom messes his hat up. There's the sound of a car. They turn. The Suburban is coming over the ridge, heading down the driveway in a cloud of dust. JOE We expecting company? Frank shakes his head. As the Suburban slows down, Tom recognizes the driver. TOM I don't believe it. FRANK You know her? Annie, out of her element, hiding behind sunglasses, gets out as Tom approaches her by himself. Annie girds herself for the confrontation. ANNIE Hello, Mr. Booker. Annie MacLean. From New York. We talked on the phone. She extends her hand. TOM shakes it, nodding, staring at her curiously. ANNIE It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs. TOM Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through! ANNIE Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel... TOM Were you thinking of personally driving me back East? ANNIE Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's... TOM You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that? ANNIE (slightly taken aback) Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car. TOM All by yourself? She nods. Tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and fortitude. Camera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house, through which DIANE -- Frank's fiery, loyal pioneer wife -- looks at the duo with suspicion. TOM I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to -- ANNIE Look! Please! Don't do the \"shucks, ma'am\" thing again! (Tom, surprised, listens) I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the... (seeing no woods) -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal? Tom tries to hide a smile of respect. Annie, thinking she may have him, starts backing away towards her car -- as one would a dangerous animal they think they might have tamed... ANNIE We're at Peterson's. Whenever you're free. You don't even have to call. She gets into the Suburban. Tom watches her drive off. EXT. ANNIE AND GRACE'S COTTAGE - DAY Tom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks. He hears a TV on inside. And Grace's Voice: GRACE (O.S.) MOM! The door! He hears Annie's muffled reply from O.S. He hears some banging as Grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door. She opens it only so far as to reveal her upper body: GRACE Yeah? TOM Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around? Grace hops to the side as Tom walks by her, into the room. Grace is closing the door as he turns to see, for the first time, that Grace is one leg. GRACE She'll be right out. She's on the phone. Grace hops back to the bed in front of the TV. Tom nods and puts his hat down -- noticing the prosthetic leaning against the window, near her bed. He hears Annie on the phone and looks to the other room, the door ajar -- seeing only her legs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks. Her foot taps impatiently. TOM First time in Montana? Grace, rudely nods, still looking at the TV. Beat. Tom doesn't like her manner, but can easily see through it. He sits. TOM She gonna be long? GRACE Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day. TOM What does she do? GRACE She's an editor. TOM Mmm. An editor. GRACE Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK? Tom just sort of nods. A beat or two later, Annie enters. ANNIE Sorry about that. Hi. Grace, this is Mr. Booker... Have you looked at Pilgrim? Tom sees Grace turn away, just as Annie enters. He takes a moment. He could say no right there, but something stops him. TOM Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now. ANNIE You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check. TOM Doesn't matter. ANNIE Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim? Grace keeps looking at the TV. No reply. Tom is half way out the door when he says to Annie -- making sure Grace can hear -- TOM Probably best she stays behind, anyway. He disappears. Annie gives Grace a final look and exits, closing the door. Alone, Grace flings her body across the bed, reaching for her prosthetic -- putting it on feverishly. She is completely intrigued by Tom. EXT. PETERSON'S STABLES - DAY Tom stands alone at the stable. Opening the bottom door, ducking under the stall, he goes inside. TOM Okay now... Okay now... Walking towards him, Tom raises his hand, showing Pilgrim a sign of respect, of trust... He quietly makes his way along Pilgrim's side, along his flank, prompting Pilgrim to move out from the shadows, into the light. Tom moves to look at him. And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him. Tom, not cowed, stands his ground. He bends, looking at Pilgrim's withered legs. He looks up at his scarred head. He looks into the pools of the horse's tortured eyes. Pilgrim stands still -- allowing Tom this brief intimacy. As Grace walks towards the stable, she realizes that the door is open and Tom must be inside. She is amazed. Annie, appearing behind her, is also impressed. Tom exits the stable and sees them, as he closes the doors. ANNIE Well... You're closest anyone's gotten. He walks straight towards them -- veering more to Grace. He stops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes -- in a way that reminds us of how Tom looked at Pilgrim. Except, Grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy. She turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post -- as if she doesn't care. Tom turns to Annie. TOM I have to be honest. I still feel you made a long trip for nothing. He looks at Annie. Annie has no more words -- just an ever- present pleading in her face. Tom watches as Grace makes a small, naked movement -- putting her hand on her cheek, like a hurt child. He can't help but see these three being connected by one wound. TOM But before I even think about it, I need to know something here and now. It's a question for Grace here. Grace stiffens. TOM When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too. ANNIE Well, that'll be a little complicated -- TOM You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go -- (to Grace) -- if you'll help. (Grace gives a bitter laugh) You have a problem with that? GRACE Isn't it like, obvious? TOM Not to me. Either you want to or you don't. ANNIE Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later-- TOM Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine. Grace reacts anew to Tom's remark. She likes her mother being dis-empowered. Annie keenly understands the importance of Tom putting it this way to Grace. Grace has all eyes on her -- just what she wants. All waiting for her response. She turns away, flicks her head and says: GRACE Well, there's nothing else to do around here. Annie smiles in relief. But Tom isn't satisfied. TOM Not good enough. I can't help you. He starts walking away. Annie doesn't know what to do. Grace mumbles. GRACE What do I have to do? Tom keeps walking out... Grace says it louder. GRACE I said, what do I have to do?! Tom stops and looks at her. Annie holds her breath. INT. THE RANCH HOUSE, DOUBLE DIVIDE - NIGHT Frank, Tom, Joe and TOM TWIN BOYS, 6 years old, sit at a dining table eating dinner, as Diane serves. We parachute into the middle of the conversation: DIANE ... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way... (TO ONE OF THE TWINS) You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen! (the boy cowers) Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve? FRANK Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it. DIANE (sits down) I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long. TOM I don't believe they'll expect that. DIANE What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger. FRANK Mixed salad. DIANE What? FRANK (slyly) I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom? Tom hides a grin -- he knows Frank into teasing her now. TOM I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once. DIANE Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York. Everyone eats. Beat. JOE When you figure on branding? FRANK Weekend after next... TOM If the weather holds. Frank nods. Silence again. Everyone eats. Beat. JOE What's an editor do anyway? DIANE (playing) We're not sure, sweetheart, but they eat like rabbits. Tom and Frank chuckle. Diane smiles -- in on the joke with them. The children are curiously confused. INT. ANNIE AND GRACE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Camera moves to reveal Annie on the phone in front of her computer and fax... plugging in extension cords as she talks: ANNIE ... the phone company's putting in extra lines. I'll call back with the numbers. Oh, and I want you to get in touch with this lady in town here -- they say she's sort of a physical therapist for the rodeo boys but keep the one at the hospital we already contacted on call... Grace sits alone in the living room. Watching TV, but anxious and disturbed about what she's committed herself to. INT. DOUBLE DIVIDE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT Diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as she listens to a BOOK OF TAPE. Her hand on her forehead, her other hand writing. Tom enters to take his hat off the sideboard. He moves to the table and reaches over for a cookie from a plate of cookies. Without looking up, Diane slaps his hand. Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee... then swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie. Diane smiles. Tom exits. It is only then that Diane looks up after him. INT. UPPER FLOOR OF RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT Camera follows Tom towards his bedroom -- passing the others. Perhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his underwear. We might see the Twins in their bunks. One of the Twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket. He casually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and continues to his room. INT. TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Tom enters and closes the door. Turns on a stereo which plays a cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma. Books fills his room. He sits at his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork. Suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. A thought passes by. We don't know what. FADE OUT: EXT. THE RANCH, A CORRAL - DAYBREAK First light of day. Pilgrim stands stock still in the middle of the corral. Tom, motionless, is crouched on his haunches in the corral -- watching him. TOM'S POV: As Pilgrim moves, he can see that the horse is stove up. He softly tosses a handful of dirt at Pilgrim's withered legs... Pilgrim, sensitive to the slightest provocation, bucks, wheeling away from him. Then stops. Tom sits on his haunches again... and watches him. Frank appears, exiting from the barn (perhaps). FRANK Tom? TOM Yeah. Tom leaves Pilgrim, hooking up with Frank -- the two brothers go off, discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY Annie and Grace arrive in the Suburban. They exit. As they head towards the ranch, they see in the distance: Pilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen. Tom stands in the pen, holding a rope, looking at Pilgrim. EXT. THE ROUND PEN - DAY Tom stands in the pen with Pilgrim. He looks to see Annie and Grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement. He turns his focus back to Pilgrim. Annie and Grace appear. Grace takes a position (that is to become her regular spot) a distance away from the pen. Annie moves in closer, beside SMOKEY (a ranch hand) with one leg up on the pen fence. SMOKEY Howdy... (sees Grace) Howdy. He and Annie watch as Tom stands before Pilgrim -- turning sideways... then standing... ANNIE What's he doing? SMOKEY Trying to get his eye. ANNIE How's it going? Smokey doesn't respond -- how it's going is exactly how it looks. Tom takes a few steps, stops and stands still again. We sense the process is long and requires great patience. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ROUND PEN - DAY Two hours later. Grace is in the same spot. Smokey is gone, doing his work. Annie has taken a different position, looking over SEVERAL PAGES OF FAXES on her lap. Tom is still standing in the pen trying to get Pilgrim's eyes. Joe has joined the proceedings, sitting on the pen rail. Tom deftly throws a hoolihan, gently lassoing Pilgrim around the neck. And Pilgrim, at the touch of the rope, crazed, resists, pulling back, striking at the rope... The rope cutting into Tom's hands. Tom gives him some slack, giving his head, letting him relax... then gently heads him by the rope, walking him around the pen, getting his feet to moving. Grace's eyes never leave Tom. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY Tom, off in the distance -- against a sky that seems to be touching the land -- is riding along a creek. Closer up, we see he's rustling the bushes with a stick. Some stray cows run out of the bushes. Tom races after them. His horse shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside. At the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly before him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays. Tom whistles. Frank waves back. In the near distance, a pickup truck is parked on the range. Joe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back of the truck. Cattle come from across the range for the food. What begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then hundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them. Tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. Far off in the distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road to the ranch. He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out of the car with Grace. Annie instinctively turns and looks across the land. Even though there is such a distance, there's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other. Tom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the range -- the Twins in the back, the cattle following. Tom sits on his horse atop the hill. EXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - ANOTHER DAY Pilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd sycopation, swimming. We discover he is in a pond, tethered to a pole... Except for the sound of his legs in the water, everything is quiet and focused on Pilgrim. SMOKEY, holds the pole, walking on the outside of the pond, leading Pilgrim back and forth as he swims. Tom, crouched by the pond, silently concentrating on Pilgrim... Grace watches, off by herself... Annie stands beside Joe. She can't help but be intrigued by the sight. She asks Joe; ANNIE I though horses were afraid of water? Joe doesn't answer her. Grace likes that. Annie, frustrated, feels she has the right to simple shout out to Tom. ANNIE Is that to get his strength back? Tom pays her no mind -- concentrating on Pilgrim. Suddenly, Annie's CELL PHONE rings, jarring the proceedings. Tom turns to Annie. She hides her embarrassment by answering it, walking away. Tom gives her a look. Grace is loving this. Tom turns back to Pilgrim. After a few moments -- Tom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. He starts to lead Pilgrim out of the water. Pilgrim, fearful, fights him. He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out of the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he is concerned too, though he stands quietly. Annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes her call to return to the pond. Tom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab Pilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope again. Pilgrim rears again. Tom stumbles backwards from his hooves. Annie gasps. Grace turns to walk away from the pond. She can't watch -- it brings back too much. But as she does, she is stopped by the sight of -- Tom, righting himself, unphased, calmly walks back to Pilgrim. The horse, baffled by this man's lack of fear, lets him take the rope and walk him out of the pond. Grace can't help but be impressed. Joe nods. Annie is shaken. ANNIE Mr. Booker, I'm not at all comfortable with you taking those kinds of chances... As Tom leads Pilgrim out, the horse suddenly whirls, bolting, knocking Tom down... ANNIE Oh, God! Pilgrim runs off, pulling the wet rope behind him. Joe runs over and grabs for the rope. TOM NO... LET HIM GO! Joe obeys. Pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill out onto a pasture, He keeps on running into the distance -- running across the pasture, not knowing where he is going... Tom, arms folded across his chest, watches him run. A concerned Annie approaches. ANNIE She's running away! How are you going to get him back? Tom doesn't respond. He walks off down the hill out onto the pasture, stops, arms folded and watches Pilgrim. Annie turns when she hears Smokey, who appears behind her: SMOKEY He don't really want to run. Don't know where he's going. All this open space scares the daylight out of him. Confused, Pilgrim stops running and walks, in no particular direction. SMOKEY My guess is he's spent his life in a six-by-eight stall... He's forgot what it's like to be a horse... Smokey ambles off and she turns back to see Tom crouching on his haunches, sitting in the grass, just waiting. Pilgrim walks back towards the ranch, stops a distance from Tom, looks at him... Annie, needing to know exactly what's going on, crosses down the hill to him. ANNIE So what now? Should we leave? Tom continues watching Pilgrim. Annie looks at him, sitting there motionless and feels like an idiot. Clearly she doesn't understand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the time to explain to her. ANNIE Well, we're going to go then... Without looking at her, Tom just nods. Annie, awkwardly, walks back up the hill to where Grace is... ON THE GRASSY HILLSIDE, Grace is watching the scene by herself as Joe appears, staring at her leg... It makes her uncomfortable. She turns to him with a curt, impatient tone; GRACE What? Their eyes meet. Joe is so guileless, Grace is taken off guard when he asks in such a compassionate voice; JOE Does that hurt you? Grace tries to think of an answer -- and of how to say it: GRACE Only when I kick somebody. Her gentle delivery makes him smile. She smiles, then: GRACE Don't you go to school? JOE Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch. He tips his hat down as he looks out to Pilgrim with respect; JOE Look at him out in the pasture -- Yeah, he must've been a big, beautiful looking horse. How was he to ride? Grace is uncomfortable again. She looks away, just struggling. Joe senses she's done talking; JOE Excuse me. I got chores to look after. He tips his hat and walks off, passing Annie as she arrives. ANNIE You ready to go? Grace hesitates. Then mother and daughter take one more look -- POV -- Pilgrim standing in the pasture with Tom crouching in the grass waiting for him. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. PASTURE - LATER THAT DAY Tom is still sitting in the grass, just where we left him -- waiting patiently. Pilgrim is still out in the pasture. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. PASTURE - STILL LATER THAT DAY Afternoon shadows cross the ranch. Tom is in the exact same spot and position. Pilgrim is somewhat closer -- but still at a distance -- watching him. Frank rides back from work. As he passes Tom, the two nod as if nothing usually is going on. Frank rides up to the barn. INT. PETERSON'S MOTEL - Grace is flicking the television -- repeating the only three channels over and over... Annie works at her computer, surrounded by work. She notices the time, gets a thought and dials the phone... ANNIE Hello, Mr. Booker... Oh, hello, Frank. This is Annie MacLean... I was wondering, has-... (listens) Uh-huh... And Pilgrim?... (listens) Still?... Uh-huh... (politely cheery) Okay then. Thank you. She hangs up, pauses, then speaks to the window out loud enough for Grace to hear -- ANNIE He's still sitting in that damn field. GRACE (w/o looking at her) I think they call it a pasture. Annie looks at her as if to say the last thing I need to know is a lesson on the local lingo... ANNIE Let's go see what's going on, then get something to eat. EXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH - DUSK The sky is changing colors, the temperature has dropped. Tom is still sitting in the grass, although someone has brought him a blanket for his shoulders. Pilgrim is in the pasture, but now -- he too is motionless, looking back at Tom. The sound of a car makes Tom turn to see Annie driving up. She gets out, stands by the car with a proprietary air, watching Tom and Pilgrim. Grace remains in the car. There's a sound. She turns to see Diane coming out of the house... DIANE There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom. ANNIE Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him. Diane, knowing full well Tom ain't in a talking mood, hands her a cup... DIANE Sure. (seeing Grace in car) Does your daughter want to come inside? ANNIE Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture? DIANE Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah. She's gone. Annie grimaces, then crosses the hillside to where Tom is squatting down. She appears to his side and, without speaking, tries to indicates she has his coffee by leaning it toward him. Tom sees her and accepts it with a grateful nod. Annie waits. Nothing happens. Feeling foolish, she begins to walk back. At some point, she turns to see Pilgrim moving across the pasture toward Tom. He stops in front of him, just a few feet away. Tom says something to him. Annie is intrigued -- and she knows enough to stay quiet now. She watches Pilgrim walk over to him. She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrim's scarred head. In spite of herself, Annie is somewhat moved by this act. Only we see Grace, peering out from the car, seeing this act of communion as well. Only we see her reaction to it. As Tom turns and walks back to the ranch, Pilgrim follows him. As he passes Annie, all he says is... TOM From now on, leave your phone somewhere else... As he moves past her, Annie responds; ANNIE But I have business calls I have to -- Tom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests, without turning back; TOM Then drop off Grace in the morning, go on back and do your business. Come pick her up around dinner. Standing there, Annie has the impulse to respond to this suggestion, but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldn't make much sense since Tom is already out of ear shot. Diane appears from the house and calls out: DIANE Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner? ANNIE Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose. DIANE No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place. Annie looks up to the alien sky and realizes she's right. She looks to Grace, who doesn't seem to oppose the idea. INT. RANCH HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT Everyone sits around the kitchen table. Joe, still wearing his hat, eyes Annie and Grace with acute curiosity. DIANE Joe, take off the hat -- I'm not going to say it again. Joe obeys. Diane puts the last of the serving plates on the table -- pork chops, potatoes, gravy, peas, bread... And a big bowl of mixed salad. The boy can't help eyeing how the \"vegetarians\" will act. Annie and Grace eye the food. Annie reaches out for a serving ladle, picking up Grace's plate to serve her as Grace reaches for a piece of bread, when: FRANK Dear Lord, we are humbly thankful for... Annie and Grace freeze as Frank continues his prayer -- they notice everyone's head bowed slightly. FRANK (continues) these gifts. For the blessings on our home, our family and our guests. Bless those that aren't as fortunate. Bless all God's creatures. EVERYONE Amen. Everyone begins eating. Annie and Grace breath a sigh of relief. Silence. Utensils hitting plates, the only sound. FRANK Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle. TOM We should be fine, then. Beat. Annie and Grace listen... JOE Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords. FRANK Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink. TOM They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother. FRANK Our daddy raised Pure Herefords. Silence... Eating... Annie tries her hand at conversation: ANNIE You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... (silence) I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to... (uncomfortable) do their... work. FRANK Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow. (to Grace) Would you mind passing that salad young lady? DIANE How's Peterson's holding up for you? ANNIE (lying) It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel. FRANK (innocently) You know, Tom, while you're working on that horse of theirs, Annie and Grace should move into the old Creek house. Diane and Tom react accordingly; Diane hiding her annoyance, Tom hiding his surprise and pleasure. FRANK Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well... ANNIE Oh, I don't know... FRANK Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears. DIANE (overlapping) They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy. FRANK It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom? TOM I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie. ANNIE Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim? TOM That's up to Pilgrim. Everyone waits on Annie's answer as she considers this. INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Grace is on the phone with Robert. Annie is packing things up. Grace is telling him about the day; GRACE (listens) I know. Me, too. Why don't you come one weekend? Annie reacts to this. GRACE We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. (to Annie) Dad wants to talk to you. ANNIE (takes the phone) Hi. INTERCUT INT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT Robert is burning the midnight oil in the study with files all around him. ROBERT Hey... She sounds like she's doing all right. How is she? Grace exits into the bathroom. Annie talks softly; ANNIE (cautious) Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit? ROBERT Taking foreve"
