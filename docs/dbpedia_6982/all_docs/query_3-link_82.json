        "text": "FROM the fluorescent nostalgia of ''American Graffiti'' (1973) to the satiric condescension of ''Pleasantville,'' recent movies have assured us that the Eisenhower era was a time of mass, unthinking conformity, of sexual prudishness and stable, nuclear families living in suburban split-levels -- a paradise for some, a hell for others.\n\nBut the movies of the 1950's tell another story. The great films noirs (''Kiss Me Deadly'') and revisionist westerns (''The Searchers'') suggest a culture deeply undermined by self-doubt.\n\nThe stealthiest and, perhaps, most subversive of these dissenting visions were the melodramas of Douglas Sirk, an extraordinary series of films, many of them made for Universal Pictures and starring Rock Hudson, that fell into the utterly disreputable category of ''women's pictures.''\n\nThough few, if any, critics registered what Sirk was up to, his work, seen today, amounts to a careful, Technicolor cataloguing of the fears and anxieties, the frustrations and contradictions, of an America then at the height of its postwar power and prestige.\n\nUniversal has made up new 35-millimeter prints of four of Sirk's best films, on view at the Film Forum through July 22. It's an occasion to discover, or revisit, the work of one of the most brilliant, least appreciated filmmakers of classical Hollywood.\n\n''Written on the Wind,'' the 1956 film that opened the series and runs through Wednesday, summarizes Sirk's approach. The plot seems impossibly lurid: The alcoholic, sexually uncertain heir to a Texas oil fortune (a tremendous performance by Robert Stack) believes he has found redemption in the person of a down-to-earth New York career woman (Lauren Bacall). But Mr. Stack hasn't counted on having his childhood best friend, and constant rival for his father's affections (the stolid Hudson, of course) falling in love with his new wife. Meanwhile, Mr. Stack's nymphomaniacal sister (Dorthy Malone, in a performance that won her an Oscar) sleeps with every available male in town, frustrated that she can't claim Hudson for herself. Tensions explode when it develops that Ms. Bacall's character is pregnant. But who is the father?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
