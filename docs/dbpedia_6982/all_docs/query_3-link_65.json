        "text": "FOREWORD:\n\nAmerican news anchor Tom Brokaw’s 1998 book ” The Greatest Generation ” popularized this term for the generation who enlisted in World War Two.\n\n“It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced.” Brokaw argued that these men and women fought not for fame and recognition, but because it was “the right thing to do.”\n\nMy father, whose formative years spanned The Great War and The Depression, was a member of “the greatest generation”. Like countless others he made a contribution to the war that saved Europe from Fascism.\n\nThis memoir is written not only to honor my father, but to honor all those who flew in World War Two, and all who fly today. My father loved to fly, as you will see. Through an account of his career, I offer a window on Royal Air Force life between 1930 and 1955, a crucial time in its history, and a portrait of an era that shaped the value system of the greatest generation.\n\nMy perspective was influenced by regular visits to the local Cinema where British and American WW2 movies were a part of regular programming.. I was 8 years old when my school showed its pupils “The Wooden Horse”, the story of a famous prison camp escape . I had no idea it was one of several in which my father was peripherally involved. But I would have to find that out from official records. He did not like to talk about the war.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nMy father taught me to swim when I was four. Here, in a picture taken by his younger brother Lloyd, we are leaving the shore of the Libyan coast outside Tripoli where my father commanded the RAF Base, Castel Benito. I was blessed with great parents who encouraged me in their different ways towards a life of fulfillment.\n\nEric Trenchard-Smith was born on June 15, 1910 in Australia, which had only four years before became a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire. While the new nation was sovereign in its domestic affairs, the United Kingdom maintained control over its relations with the wider world. Initially young Eric grew up in Manly, a coastal suburb of Sydney, in the east coast state of New South Wales.\n\nThis was the Manly Beachfront, where he first learned to swim and body surf. In the age before television and smart phones, the great outdoors was where kids entertained themselves.\n\nSixty years later, I would stage major scenes from “BMX BANDITS” all over Manly and the Northern Beaches in a private homage to my father’s birthplace, where his sense of adventure was formed.\n\nEric was the third of four boys born to Ethel and Oliver Trenchard-Smith, His father was a commercial traveller for Potter & Burke, a pharmaceutical company that represented Johnson & Johnson products. His salesmanship was impressive enough for the company to appoint him their New Zealand Manager, resulting in the family moving to Auckland when Eric was 12. The same year Eric contracted respiratory diphtheria. Sore throat, barking cough, swelling, made it Australia’s highest cause of infant mortality in the pre-vaccination 1920. As my father’s breathing difficulties became more severe, the family consented to a potentially risky procedure at the time – a tracheotomy, an incision in the throat providing a direct airway to the windpipe. I’m sure the experience had its impact on my father’s development. What does not kill you makes you stronger.\n\nWorld War One, while tragically high in Australian (62K) and New Zealand (18K) casualties, had nonetheless been a boon for the Dominion’s rapid economic growth. Consequently, middle class income in 1922’s Auckland provided a good standard of living, particularly for a senior management executive. The Trenchard-Smith family bought a house in Epsom with a view of Mount Eden a mile away, and an adjacent clay tennis court where Eric learned a future social skill. The family raised White Leghorn chickens, and had an orchard of fruit trees; the boys had their toast spread with jam made from apples, guavas, nectarines, peaches, figs. There was also a walnut tree and a tomato tree. The home, as described my uncle Lloyd’s memoir, had an Angelus brand Pianola in the “sitting room” and a wind-up gramophone wired to a speaker on the large back verandah. The brothers could play Vitaphone dance records when friends came over. In the dining room, there was a six valve “wireless set”. Radio reception was not good till brother Ray and his father built an outside “aerial”. Two thirty foot timber poles were connected by a “scarf joint”, creating a sixty foot mast, the requisite height for reception. which was then embedded upright in the back lawn. Four cables tethered it to the ground. The radio had clarity thereafter. I admire the problem solving ingenuity of past generations.\n\nThe boys often walked 4 miles to school. Oldest son Ray was soon at University, youngest son Lloyd became his mother’s focus of attention, middle brothers Oliver Junior and Eric had permission to roam in the adjacent bushland by themselves taking a bag of food, ” a tucker bag”, and camp out for a night or two. Self-sufficiency and adventure was encouraged.\n\nPotter & Birks’ business in prospered, enabling Oliver Trenchard-Smith to buy their first family car, not the one shown, but an equivalent brand new 1923 six cylinder five seater Buick with folding hood. Horse drawn transportation was the norm, as were bicycles and motor cycles with side cars. Cars were the province of the well to do. I cannot find an accurate sale price for a 1923 Buick but it could well have been half a year’s salary. I suspect Potter & Birks provided the vehicle for their chief sales representative in New Zealand within a year of his arrival, something Oliver Trenchard-Smith probably negotiated as a bonus for taking his family to Auckland, a city less developed than Sydney, Australia. Many along the Trenchard genealogical line dating from the 1100’s have displayed a flair for negotiation; thereby gaining wealth, avoiding execution, etc. Perhaps it’s in the DNA.\n\nFrom 1925 owners had to register their motor vehicles. Soon there were more than 150,000 on the road. New Zealand had one car for every 10 people, second only to the US, and ahead of Australia and Britain, a reflection of the country’s rapidly developing prosperity.. At the age of 13, when his father was away, Eric taught not just himself but also his mother to drive. Licenses and road safety regulations were not introduced in New Zealand for another two years. His mother provided piano lessons for Eric who showed some aptitude although it was discouraged by his father as being an “unmanly” pursuit. My grandfather was by repute a difficult man, He would come home from weeks of business travel tired and expect calm and relaxation in the household. The two middle brothers were rambunctious teenagers. My grandfather beat Eric with a leather belt at age 12 for some act of defiance, according to his younger brother Lloyd, who overheard the encounter in the next room. According to my uncle Lloyd:\n\n“Eric was the strong willed naughty brother and received many beatings from my father. My brother Ollie was gentle by nature. Eldest brother Ray was often the peacemaker when he thought my father was being a bit unreasonable towards Eric or Ollie.” Spare the rod, spoil the child was part of parenting culture in those days. but it did not take root with my father, who resolved disciplinary issues without ever raising a hand to me. Thus, he broke the cycle of corporal punishment embraced by his own father and generations before him.\n\nMy grandfather’s politics was politically conservative. anti- communist and racist. In his will he stipulated the disinheritance of any of his children who married a communist, a Jew, or member of the African or Asian races. This became an issue many years later when Oliver Trenchard-Smith’s second son Oliver Jnr. wanted to marry Renata Rebane, an emigre from Estonia. My uncle Oliver had a difficult time convincing his father that Renata, as a 14 year old had fled from the bloody Russian invasion of Estonia, and was therefore not a communist. But he prevailed. In 1966, I visited my aunt Renata and her 90 year old mother in Sydney. She told me of walking home through the fields from school one day past the bodies of people shot from a passing train. The White Russian/Red Russian War of 1918 -22 is a fascinating and neglected slice of geo-political history, hopefully to be explored in large scale streaming series, as History should. In that visit my father and I met Michael Romanoff, a purported Romanov cousin and leader of the White Russian community in Sydney, who had embraced Australian life. We body surfed with him after a picnic on Bondi Beach. Like Renata, he had lived through interesting times. Passions ran high. I include this White Russian propaganda poster because, well, I find propaganda art interesting. It can reveal more about the propagandists than they realize.\n\nMy grandfather wanted his son, who had a flair for computation, to train for 5 years as an articled clerk, then work for him as an accountant. This was not the life young Eric had dreamed of.\n\nMy father was a life long bird watcher, often taking field glasses on walks. There was something about the wonder of flight that fascinated him. To be the master of a machine that can emulate a bird, to be no longer earthbound, was an appealing concept to adventurous young men, and probably a greater reason for my father to apply to join the RAF than to avoid working for his father, with whom he “did not get along.” I did get along with my father, particularly from the age of 13, when I began discussing what I might do with my life when I left school. His advice to me was to find something I loved doing and get paid for it; advice I took. The nub of it was: follow your passion.My father had decided his passion was aviation, the new game changing development in transportation, barely a generation old. During the 1920’s, Australia, a continent 3000 miles from coast to coast, was obsessed with “Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines.” Cinema Newsreels proudly featured the latest planes to an audience that “went to the pictures” once a week.\n\nAviation pioneers became celebrities. Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith became a household name after completing the world’s first trans-Pacific flight with Charles Ulm from America to Australia in 1928, an event recreated in the 1946 movie “Smithy”, or “Pacific Adventure” in the United States.\n\nSir Charles Kingsford-Smith and Charles Ulm standing next to their plane upon arrival in England in 1929. (National Library of Australia)\n\nI know my father saw the 1927 Academy Award winning silent movie Wings, which contained the most elaborate aerial combat sequences yet filmed. This UTube clip, (with added music and sound effects) shows how how the young men of Australia and New Zealand were first introduced to warfare in the skies.\n\nA tournament of Knights, challenging gravity and the laws of physics. Hard to resist. But it was not the adrenalin rush of warfare that my father sought.\n\nIt was the joy of flight.\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force had few planes and little need for recruits. But Britain did. In 1930, the British government, anticipating the hostilities ahead. offered short service commissions to volunteers from Commonwealth countries. Successful applicants would be trained for 3 years, receive a King’s Commission and return to their respective countries, Thus a talent pool of experienced pilots would be available to recall if the threat from Germany became real.\n\nThinking ahead, my father had, in his late teens enhanced his resume by volunteering while at university for the New Zealand Army, training part time as a bombardier with the 4th Field Howitzer Battery. When the Royal Air Force called for Commonwealth volunteers, Eric told his father that he wished to serve his country (Australians and New Zealanders at that time often referred to England as the Mother Country.) and join the RAF in the UK. He persuaded his father he would return in three years when his short service commission ended. How could a conservative anti-communist father stand in the way of his son’s sense of patriotic duty? My father applied, citing his brief military service, sailed to England in 1930 and was accepted. Listed as Smith, he is standing third from the right at the end of his first term at RAF Cranwell College Flying School.\n\nAs it turned out, he did not return to Australia after his short service commission expired. His rating as a pilot was listed as “exceptional”. He was given a full commission in the Royal Air Force and served for 25 years., reaching the rank of Wing Commander. His service record reveals a quiet achiever who successfully handled a variety of challenging assignments. He did not think he did anything remarkable. He just did his duty as best he could.As did the vast majority of the Greatest Generation.\n\nFLIGHT\n\nMy father and I enjoyed Those Magnificent Men on a giant screen of the Odeon, Leicester Square. As was commercially sensible for a big budget holiday season attraction, the movie played pioneer aviation for comedy.\n\nIn reality, flying a century ago was a hazardous business, and all those that undertook it knew the risks. It must have taken blind faith and a special kind of courage an to entrust your life to canvas stretched over a wooden framework, held together with wire, string. and a great deal of glue; but that was what the pioneer pilots were working with when war broke out in 1914, and aerial combat was developed.. Casualty rates were high. Below is a restored Sopwith Camel, Britain’s most successful WW1. fighter. It was credited with downing 1,294 enemy aircraft, more than any other Allied fighter in the conflict. A brief digression into the Camel’s unique characteristics will illuminate the range of risks pilots faced when they took to the air.\n\nIn the hands of an experienced pilot, the Camel was highly maneuverable, an essential quality in the relatively low-speed, low-altitude dogfights of the era. But she was quite challenging to fly, and especially during take off and landing,\n\nThis was an inevitable byproduct of the fighter’s design – critically small dimensions, high undercarriage, a narrow distance between the wheels; and notably the moving mass of the rotary engine. This affected the plane’s center of gravity, causing stalling or a fatal spin. In six months of 1917, more than a hundred accidents occurred involving Sopwith Camels, and thirty pilots were lost. Pilots who survived the severe flying school of the Western Front mastered the Camel’s eccentricities, and went on to become Aces.\n\n1914 – 1918 were the infancy years of aerial combat. Pilots shooting at each other with pistols gave way to a gunner sitting behind the pilot with a Lewis gun on a swivel ring. He could only fire to the side, above or behind the aircraft, limiting options in a dogfight. What fighter pilots needed were guns that pointed at their targets as they pursued them. so twin machine guns were mounted in front of the cockpit, directly behind the propeller, shooting between the rotation of the propeller blades.\n\nHow, you may wonder, did the wooden propeller survive the fusillade of bullets? The solution was timing, as is demonstrated in glorious slow-motion by the Slo Mo Guys. At one minute fifteen seconds into their video, the Guys begin their demonstration.\n\nOK. I’m going to get into the weeds here. While the video above is a joy to watch, it doesn’t touch on the real innovation behind what makes it work, the synchronization gear, which restricted the machine gun so it could only fire in between the propellers. This video gives a sense of the ingenious amalgam of wood, metal strut, and wire components involved in the Sopwith cockpit.\n\nTo take the risks involved, here, in the British currency of the day, is what the newly formed Royal Flying Corps paid their flying officers\n\nMajor: 32 shillings per day – Captain: 19 shillings, rising to 20 shillings per day after 1 year in the position + an additional 8 shillings per day flying pay\n\nLieutenant: 12 shillings per day + an additional 1 shilling per day for each completed year (up to a max of 16 shillings) +an additional 8 shillings per day flying pay; 2nd Lieutenant: 10 shillings a day + 8 shillings a day flying pay\n\nProbationer: 7 shillings and sixpence a day plus 4 shillings flying pay\n\n20 shillings made up a Pound Sterling. In 1918, a family needed 225 Pounds a year to live on. By the time my father joined Cranwell College in 1930, wages for graduate pilot officers were not much higher than in 1918. But the College offered room and board and the prospect of promotion.\n\n****\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps had become the Royal Air Force in 1924. Cranwell College was founded to train future pilots. When my father sailed from Sydney to England to start training there, he met a New Zealander on board with the same intention. Regrettably, on his first flight, there was a mechanical malfunction and the man was killed alongside his instructor.\n\nThe RAF Archives list more than 100 pilot fatalities in 1931, a dozen in flight training. This seems to be the accident referred to.\n\nANNING, Anthony Frederick Paul, F/O – Killed 13 February 1931 in an Atlas, Cranwell Cadet College; loss of speed on a gliding turn during approach for a practice forced landing. He was instructor.\n\nACTON-ADAMS, Arthur Moreland, New Zealander; Flight Cadet – Killed 13 February 1931 in an Atlas, Cranwell Cadet College; loss of speed on a gliding turn during approach for a practice forced landing.\n\nCrash landings and collisions on the airfield were not uncommon as pilot training expanded beyond trainer experience. This luckless fellow caused both his plane and a hanger to burn down.\n\nBelow are the remains of an Armstrong Whitworth Atlas and an Avro Tutor after a fatal collision at No.3 Flying School, Grantham in June 1931.\n\nMARKBY, Jack Eugene, F/O – Killed 30 October 1931 at Hucknall in a Tutor of No.3 Flying Training School, Grantham. Member of No.504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron. He was pilot of the aircraft.\n\nMcHARDY, Louis, F/O – Killed 30 October 1931 at Hucknall in a Tutor of No.3 Flying Training School, Grantham. Member of No.504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron.\n\nThe RAF Archives continues with reasons for this accident.\n\n“When the machines were over the Squadron hangar one got into a bump and rocked from side to side. When the pilot found that he was underneath his leader’s machine he turned away and his top left plane caught the leader’s tail, causing it to fall off. The leader’s machine continued for a few seconds and then dived onto the aerodrome. It was twisted right round as a result of the collision. The jury returned a verdict of ‘accidental death’ and attached no blame to anyone.”\n\nFlight report of court martial (issue of 20 February 1931) included the following:\n\n“W/C R.D.G. Small said that the regulation about distance between machines flying in formation was very seldom carried out. It was much easier to fly in tight formation than at the correct distances and intervals. According to evidence, both machines got into bumps near a hangar. P/O Angell in his evidence said that he could not control his machine in the bump. He was not aware that there had been any impact until he landed. His machine was less than half a span away from the other. The court acquitted Angell after a brief retirement.”\n\nPilot Officer Angell, himself, aged 21, was killed a month later when his Siskin 111A hit a tree while low flying.\n\nAn RAF career had its perils, even in peacetime.\n\n****\n\nTRAINING TO FLY\n\nFor the first year, RAF Cranwell grounded the cadets in the fundamentals of aviation, combined with military life coaching, and a dash of college education.\n\nCadets were instructed in English language and literature; mathematics, engines and the theory of flight; mechanics and draughtsmanship; wood and metal work; elementary science; and the use of the wireless: map reading; military drill; PT; sanitation and hygiene. Here they are learning Morse Code.\n\nThe second year was when the cadets were taught to fly, including the use of a compass and machine gun while flying. The working day started at 6.45am, when the cadets were woken. There was a parade at 8am (even on Saturdays), after which the cadets marched off to lectures, workshops, drill or other activities until 12.30. From 2pm until tea at 4.30, there were more organized activities. After tea, there was more study preparation. Cranwell was both an educational and a military institution, with military protocols dominant. There were daily kit inspections Cadets had lay out their kit on their bed in a very precise manner. If the instructor wasn’t happy, he might tip the whole lot onto the floor and tell the cadet to start over. Precision was important in aviation. But as military boot camps go, RAF Cranwell was pretty mellow.\n\nFlying instruction started with a demonstration of a plane’s working parts. Here students study a rear aerelon, a hinged flight control surface on the trailing edge of each wing, that controls the roll of the airframe, or effects maneuvers.\n\nFlying instruction began with an initial period of dual and solo work in fundamentals of take off and landing, stalls, spins, forced landings and maneuvers. It was followed by a “diversified” phase to include acrobatics, accuracy approaches, “strange field landings”, My father’s favorite among the trainers was the Tiger Moth. Considered “easy to fly, difficult to fly well”, the RAF found the Moth ideal for training fighter pilots. It had a top speed of 104 mph. a low stalling speed, a ceiling of 14,000 ft. and a range of 300 miles. It was an ideal aircraft on which to learn aerobatics. Once my father was cleared for solo flying, he enjoyed looking down at the countryside gliding by below from the open cockpit of a Moth, while navigating by following railway lines; it’s a view still enjoyed by the pilot of this restored Tiger Moth.\n\nThe original Tiger Moth cockpit seems cramped. Being over 6 foot tall my father probably found all cockpits cramped.\n\nThe upright shaft at the bottom of the frame is the joystick. As described in this subsequent training manual for monoplanes, the joystick controls the attitude of a machine: to raise or lower its nose, to produce bank to left or right and to turn the nose of the machine to left or right in relation to the horizon. The pilot maneuvers the joystick with his hands and the rudder with his feet. (No shit, Sherlock). I love old training manuals.\n\nBefore a pilot could take off, the wooden propeller had to be swung by hand. This potentially hazardous task was carried out by ground crew, or by the pilot himself. Once swung, the tip of the propeller blade suddenly went from zero to 320 feet per second; plenty to take off a hand, smash bones, or split a skull clean in half. Hand propping accidents were not uncommon. They still occur today.\n\nPioneer aviator Elsie Mackay demonstrates the stance she adopted to stay clear of the propeller arc. Practitioners were instructed to grip the trailing edge, using as little of the fingers as possible, then swing the blade like a golf club, at the same time twisting your body away from the propeller as you ‘follow through’. That reduces the risk of ‘banana fingers’…\n\nSadly Elsie Mackay’s prominent aviation career was cut short in 1928 when she and her copilot attempted to fly a single engined aircraft across the Atlantic in bad weather. Like Amelia Earhart, her body was never found. The dark side of aviation – death, dismemberment and an unknown grave – were risks that flying school cadets accepted. Accidents were a factor at Grantham and other training centers.\n\nI don’t know if my father was amongst these hardy Cranwell College cadets on parade in the snow. but he was among the graduating cadets at a ceremony presided over by “the father of the Royal Air Force”, Sir Henry Montague Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard, who had been given an hereditary peerage for his service to military aviation. He had founded Cranwell College in 1920.\n\nA brief digression on the family name: Trenchard was derived from the Old French word trenchier, meaning to cut, hack, slice. This became a generic term for a swordsman, soldier, man of war, or butcher. Norman knight Roul de Trenchard fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The first recording of the Trenchard name in the UK was on a deed of land granted by William the Conqueror to Paganus Trenchard, witnessed by his grandsons, for services during the conquest of England. The Trenchard descendants, traced through Church records of births and deaths from 1143 onwards, were frequently servants of the state: burghers, sheriffs, judges, knights, politicians. Sir John Trenchard earned his knighthood by fighting on the winning side of the Wars of the Roses. A subsequent Sir John Trenchard became Secretary of State to joint monarchs William and Mary in 1692.\n\nHere’s how I come to share the Trenchard name. On August 4, 1803, Miss Elizabeth Trenchard married Mr. Robert Smith. When their son William was born, he was christened William John Trenchard-Smith. In order to preserve the Trenchard lineage, they fused the family names. William’s son Edward Trenchard-Smith sought his fortune in Australia. He was my great grandfather.\n\nTrenchard emigrants also prospered in America. George Trenchard became Attorney General of West New Jersey. His son Edward Trenchard commanded ships in the US Civil War, ending his career as a Rear Admiral. It seems there is a strong martial element in the Trenchard DNA, and Sir Hugh Montague Trenchard is a prime example.\n\nViscount Trenchard, as he would become, was certainly an example of the British bulldog breed of Empire Warriors. A bullet to the chest during the Boer War lost him his left lung and caused partial paralysis in his legs. Recuperating in Switzerland, he took up bobsled racing, resulting in a crash that cured the obstruction to his spine, enabling him to return to the Boer War, leading mounted infantry. He survived 6 years of active service in Nigeria before tropical disease forced his return to England. While convalescing, he thought about the future of military power in the air, as yet untried. Concealing the fact that he was partially blind in one eye, he took flying lessons for 10 days and received a pilots license, though he was not particularly gifted and never instructed flying. Administration and political savvy was his real skill, which he demonstrated as commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France during World War One, where he pioneered strategic bombing. After the war he was knighted and became Chief of the Air Staff. In 1920. He founded Cranwell College in 1920.\n\nHere is Viscount Lord Trenchard, on the eve of his retirement as Marshall of the Royal Air Force, inspecting the graduating pilot officers. Trenchard’s nickname in both the Service and Whitehall was “Boom” for “his stentorian utterances and low rumbling tones”. I’m not sure in what tones Lord Trenchard spoke to Pilot Officer E.T. Smith at their brief meeting, when he said ” So, you are from the Australian branch of the family ?”\n\nWhen my father entered Cranwell College, the name Trenchard was legendary in the RAF. For him to continue to use his full family surname Trenchard Smith that had been hyphenated in Australia since 1860 would have invited regular questions as to how he was related to the Father of the RAF. Something my father wanted to avoid. He did not want to seem to be trading on a famous name. So he uncoupled the joint surname, making Trenchard his middle name and Smith his surname. (He would recouple the surname 25 years later when he retired from the RAF.) But Viscount Trenchard had done his homework on each graduating pilot and noted noted the middle name of Cadet Eric Smith. (Third from the left.) My father probably came to his attention because his rating as a pilot at flying school was “exceptional”.\n\nNine months after leaving flying school my father was back as an instructor. He would in due course become an instructor of instructors in the training of pilots. He would earn a nickname “Expert Eric”. During his 25 year career, my father flew every new plane that came his way, from a Sopwith Camel to a Vampire jet. His RAF log book recorded flights in over 80 different types of aircraft. As part of an exercise, my father learned to land a plane on an aircraft carrier. The weather was not great, the seas choppy. On his approach he could see the carrier’s deck yawing. But a happy landing ensued.\n\nPhotographs of many of the types of planes he flew in the early to mid 1930’s can be seen in this fascinating website.\n\nhttps://glostransporthistory.visit-gloucestershire.co.uk/royalair30.htm\n\n****\n\nBy 1933, a German fringe politician named Adolf Hitler, previously viewed as a rhetorically skillful clown with a violent following, had gained traction with the electorate aggrieved by the harsh terms of the peace treaty imposed on Germany at the end of World War One. Guided by Josef Goebbels, his chief propagandist, Hitler recorded a widely distributed phonograph album – think today’s podcast, sold in shops on vinyl – in which his strutting antisemitic rants at rallies were replaced by an almost Chancellor like demeanor. Households across Germany listened to a message of national pride and resurgence. Corporations and conservatives believed Hitler would protect their money. Socialists believed Hitler championed the working man.\n\nThe text states: “In the deepest need Hindenburg chose Adolf Hitler for Reich Chancellor. You too should vote for List 1.”\n\nTo end political instability, rival German power brokers appointed Hitler Germany’s Chancellor, believing they could control him. One of Hitler’s principal political backers wrote:“We box him in. Within two months we will have pressed Hitler into a corner so tight that he’ll squeak.”\n\nYet, Hitler would would outwit them all and start a world war that wrecked Europe and killed tens of millions.\n\nHitler’s rise and fall is a factor in my father’s story and the evolution of the Royal Air Force. It’s important to understand what the greatest generation was fighting against. After the Nazis achieved power, Goebbels wrote “ The big joke on Democracy is that it gives its mortal enemies the tools to its own destruction.” Authoritarianism remains the mortal enemy of Democracy. The war is eternal. Today it is being fought in Ukraine.\n\nThe danger Hitler posed was evident to former cabinet minister Winston Churchill. He was out of office at this time, considered a passed over war hawk. His 1934 speech, reproduced here with illustrations on Utube, eloquently outlines the issues.\n\nHitler’s intention to persecute Jews was now out in the open. On a street in Worms, Germany, the antisemitic propaganda newspaper Der Stürmer (The Attacker) posts its headline: “The Jews Are Our Misfortune.”\n\n“Interracial relationships” between Jews and non-Jews were prohibited under the Nuremberg Race Laws. Citizens were encouraged to report suspicions of the “crime” of interracial relationships to the police.\n\nOther morally repugnant social experiments were being instituted. The Nazis coined the term “Mercy Killing” to describe the involuntary euthanizing of the sick, elderly and disabled. This propaganda poster from the 1930’s gives the high cost of caring for such people as a fundamental justification for euthanasia.\n\n” 60,000 Reichsmarks is what this person suffering from an hereditary defect costs the People’s community during his lifetime. Fellow citizen, that is your money too.”\n\nThese propaganda posters further point to transactionalism at the heart of Nazi ideology. Here, amplified by a racist trope. The caption from a Nazi propaganda film strip shown to Hitler youth says: “Mentally ill Negro (English) 16 years in an institution costing 35,000 Reichsmarks.”\n\nGod’s Will has always been a useful emotional manipulation. Here it was applied to euthanasia and forced sterilization. The caption reads: “…because God cannot want the sick and ailing to reproduce.”\n\nChurchill’ saw the gathering storm ahead. His warnings of Nazi plans for European domination were ignored by a government deeply affected by the horrors of the Great War. Conflict with Germany was to be avoided at all costs. The new Chamberlain government did not invite Churchill into the Cabinet. opting for a policy of appeasement.\n\nChurchill did what he could behind the scenes. He had taken flying lessons (not a good pilot apparently) and was a friend of Lord Trenchard, the father of the Royal Air Force, who shared his views. Although retired from the RAF, and currently in charge of the Metropolitan Police, Trenchard frequently used his platform as a member of the House of Lords to loudly voice his opinion on RAF matters. He knew Germany was secretly developing civilian planes convertible to military use. He pushed for was a massive bombing force as Britain’s best deterrent. His advice, like Churchill’s, was ignored. But it did jolt the government into recognition that the RAF, as Britain’s first line of defense, should be modernized and pilot training expanded.\n\nINSTRUCTING PILOTS\n\nA flight of Hawker Furies flies over Cranwell after a snowfall.\n\nHaving graduated in September 1932, and sent back to flying school, now Acting Flight Officer E.T. Smith began his duties as an instructor. His full rank would be confirmed a year later. The RAF offered to extend his three year short service commission to six years. At that point, if his service continued to be satisfactory, he would be granted a permanent commission. That would be his dream come true. He started learning the capabilities, and limitations of every different plane that came his way. New models of fighters, bombers, transports, seaplanes were being delivered to RAF bases across England and all Commonwealth countries. RAF needed pilots who could fly a variety of planes, and instructors who could work across the board. There was a shortage in both categories. It seems my father’s love of flight had combined with a flair for instruction.\n\nInstructors trained with a variety of specially modified dual control aircraft. This two seater Avro Type 621 Tutor was a simple but rugged basic trainer, frequently a student pilot’s first experience of the skies. My father spoke fondly of the Tiger Moth for its maneuverability. By 1935 the RAF trained about 300 pilots a year, with plans to increase the strength of the Royal Air Force by 1,500 aircraft by 1937. Cranwell College developed this teaching aid for twelve pupils at a time.\n\nOnce pilots had achieved a level of confidence in the air, training progressed to instrument flying. To simulate conditions of zero visibility, this RAF Miles Magister had been adapted for blind flying training. The pilot in the back seat pulled the hood over his cockpit and focussed on his instrument panel.\n\nAn instructor sat in the front cockpit, to check the accuracy of the flying and watch out for other aircraft.\n\nOnce they had their wings, all pilots learned the packing and use of the parachute, should it be necessary to bail out. Practice jumps from a tower approximated the speed of descent, and taught pilots how to land. Flight Officer Smith took the parachute course, training that would prove useful some years later.\n\nActive service was ahead.\n\nPOSTED TO INDIA IN 1934\n\nTo imagine what the life of an RAF Plight Officer was like on the North West Frontier of India, an understanding of the historical context is helpful. Forgive me for getting into the geo-political weeds here, but if History is not studied, we will repeat its mistakes. And the Sykes-Picot Agreement was a great mistake.\n\nIn May 1916, Britain and France, anticipating victory, entered into a secret agreement, with the assent of Imperial Russia, to carve up the soon to be defeated Ottoman Empire into spheres of influence, both political and economic. France got Syria, Britain got Iraq, which was adjacent to British controlled Kuwait. thus providing an Anglo-French dominated corridor linking the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. When the Soviets took over Russia in late 1917, they revealed the secret agreement to the world. Arabs felt betrayed because they had entered the British side of the war believing they were promised self determination.. They saw the Sykes-Picot Agreement as a covert transfer of Turkish colonial rule to the European powers. Under the British and French mandates, borders were put in place without regard to the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious fault lines of the region, Iraq was originally three separate provinces, Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite, of the Ottoman Empire. The clean lines of the European drawn maps caused conflicts the world is still dealing with today.\n\nInevitably this breach of trust produced Arab insurgencies. By 1920 a countrywide uprising had spread across Iraq. Britain, like all colonial powers throughout the previous century, was brutal in response. using the technology honed by World War 1, armored vehicles and air power. In a secret 1923 memo, then Secretary for War Winston Churchill advocated for the use of mustard gas. “I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes,” he declared, criticizing his colleagues for their “squeamishness”, declaring that “the objections of the India Office to the use of gas against natives are unreasonable. Gas is a more merciful weapon than high explosive shell, and compels an enemy to accept a decision with less loss of life than any other agency of war.” He was overruled. Gas was not deployed, in favor of “aerial policing”, a strategy developed by the new Chief of the RAF, the afore mentioned Sir Hugh Trenchard.\n\nBritain’s Air Minister, Lord Thomson, detailed how one district of “recalcitrant chiefs” was subdued in the Liwa region on the Euphrates in November 1923.\n\nHe wrote: “As they refused to come in, bombing was then authorized and took place over a period of two days. The surrender of many of the headmen of the offending tribes followed.”\n\nThe RAF flew missions totaling 4,008 hours, dropped 97 tons of bombs and fired 183,861 rounds for the loss of nine men killed, seven wounded and 11 aircraft destroyed behind rebel lines. Between six and ten thousand Iraqis were killed. British and Indian Army losses were less than a thousand. There was little debate on the morality of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas. Even though the deliberate targeting of ‘non-combatants’ was already regarded as a war crime under the 1899 Hague Conventions, to which Britain was a signatory, the British government insisted the bombing was legitimate suppression of unlawful rebellion in a region under British control.\n\nOK. I’m going deeper into the weeds of Imperialism here.\n\n“The East Offering Its Riches to Britannia”, painted by Roma Spiridone in 1778, speaks volumes about how the British people were sold colonialism by the East India Company. Britain must civilize the savages, convert them to Christianity, and use their resources for the greater good of the Empire. Basically, it’s God’s Will. Who dares argue with that? Starting in the seventeenth century, Britain’s East India Company, using the largest private army in the world, seized control of substantial sections of the Indian subcontinent, colonized Hong Kong and parts of South East Asia, while remitting revenue to the British government as a licensed privateer, before Britain officially assumed full control of India in 1857. The East India Company was the original corporate raider.\n\nColonialism was the bastard child of racism and capitalism. The European powers may have introduced improvements to medicine, education and infrastructure, but they nonetheless saw their colonial subjects as children of a lesser God, and colonies across Africa, India and Asia as an endless supply of raw materials and cheap labor to feed the economic needs of the burgeoning European middle class. Britain was not the worst but all colonial powers used land seizure, forced labor, unfair taxation and brutal repression of dissent to carry out a policy that was at its core justified by racism. Clearly, I am not a big fan of colonialism, though I recognize that as a baby boomer I am a beneficiary of its legacy.\n\nThe British government regarded the strategy of “aerial policing” in Iraq as a pragmatic success. A handful of RAF squadrons, with a small force of troops and armored vehicles maintained Britain’s military control over Iraq until World War Two, even after Iraqi independence in 1932. The policy was adopted across troubled regions of the British Empire. In late 1934, Flight Officer E.T. Smith was posted to one such trouble spot, a rough border province in what is now Pakistan, with orders to take part in support missions against insurgents from bases like this along the Afghan India border.\n\nHistory’s harsh verdict on colonialism should not extend blame to the foot soldiers, or aviators, in my father’s case, who carried out colonial policies. They believed the world view their governments sold them.. Such was the strength of colonialist indoctrination of the times, when my father joined the Royal Air Force in 1930. Like most Australians, he revered Great Britain, and believed he was serving a righteous cause. As his training began, he must have considered he too might be called upon to drop high explosives on Britain’s enemies in the continuing “police actions” in British controlled regions of the Middle East and South Asia. My father’s view was that war policy, right or wrong, was the responsibility of government; the responsibility of a serving officer was to obey orders. But social values evolve. My father’s experiences in India and subsequently in Libya, convinced him of the ultimate futility of Empire.\n\nIn 1936, Mirza Ali Khan, known as the Faqir of Ipi, a long time opponent of the British Raj, intensified his campaign in Northern Waziristan.\n\nFunding for his insurgency was later revealed to have come through from Mussolini’s Italy, and Hitler’s Germany, with the Italian ambassador as conduit. At one time Mirza Ali Khan was able to put 20,000 fighters into the field.\n\nBritish and Indian Army units pursued the Faqir of Ipi , but he would always vanish. In fact, he would never be captured. .\n\nThe Faqir led an ambush against two British marching columns in Waziristan’s previously peaceful Khaisora Valley, trapping the units and inflicting more than a hundred casualties.\n\nRAF strafing runs and air drops of ammunition saved the day. My father was always reticent to talk about his combat experiences, so I don’t know if he was involved in the air cover for the evacuation, but it is probable.\n\nHere’s an extract from the report on what seems like quite a large operation.\n\nAfter criticism of British bombing in Iraq, the RAF had moderated its terms of engagement in Afghanistan, by the time my father served there between 1935 and 1936, but the policy was still cold blooded. Bi-lingual leaflets were first to be dropped on a rebel village requiring compliance by a certain date otherwise the village would be bombed. If that date passed without compliance, a squadron would return to drop leaflets announcing the village would be bombed at noon the next day, so that the inhabitants could leave and take their herds to the safety of nearby caves. But the village and its fields would continue to be bombed every day until compliance was achieved. Leaflets would again be dropped to indicate it was safe to return. Ultimately insurgencies would dissipate. Till the next incident.\n\n“1934 was less troublesome, with a greater emphasis on training, familiarisation and reconnaissance patrols. Nonetheless, the following year, trouble erupted again in Mohmand territory. Under the guidance of the Hadji of Turngzai, a lashkar of 2,000 tribesmen gathered with the intention of destroying a recently completed military road. Having warned the lashkar to disperse, a 38-aircraft demonstration was executed over the area. Following little observable change in the lashkar’s behaviour, a phased bombing programme commenced on 20 August in support of ground operations. However, close support was restricted throughout the period. Both Nos. 27 and 60 Squadron had a Flight each at the Hill Deport, reducing aircraft availability considerably. More significantly, a severe earthquake, consisting of two main shocks, struck the native city of Quetta and the nearby RAF Station on 31 May 1935, causing widespread devastation to aircraft and infrastructure alike. Air Chief Marshal Sir David Lee recalls: … as we began to taxy [sic] slowly towards the tarmac it soon became clear that the station [Quetta] had suffered immense damage. Hangers were still standing but the other buildings appeared to be heaps of rubble with clouds of the choking dust still floating upwards. An airman with a bandage round his head came limping out to meet me as I turned into line with about a dozen other aeroplanes which had arrived before us. While undoing my straps, I looked around; every airman in sight had some part of his body bandaged and, in fact, I don’t think I saw a single airman without some injury during our brief stay.45 Immediate relief was transported by air assets, with doctors, nurses and urgent supplies arriving in short order. Ultimately the RAF Station was abandoned: No. 5 Squadron relocated ”\n\nUnlike many retired RAF Officers after WW2, my father would only talk of his combat experiences when pressed. This is the only thing he told me of his involvement in “aerial policing”. Leaflets had been dropped warning of the coming punitive air raid on a small recalcitrant village somewhere in Waziristan. On the appointed day, my father flew a maneuverable fighter bomber, probably the Westland Wapati, named after a graceful American elk. Dive bombing was the Wapati’s speciality. Or it might have been a Hawker Hart, depicted here.\n\nThe technique was to pass directly over the target, throttle back and pull the nose up sharply until the airspeed was within 20 mph of the stall. At this point full rudder was applied. This was called a stalled turn. With the nose pointing vertically upwards at low speed, the rudder wheels rotated the aircraft elegantly on its axis to a position heading vertically downwards. If the pilot judged correctly, he should be looking straight down at the target. What my father saw was a lone goat directly below in the impact zone of the bomb. It probably lost its way during the evacuation and had wandered back to the village. My father did not want to kill a goat. He had no problem bombing those that shot at him, but not a goat. Seconds away, he veered sharply to the side and dropped the bomb at the edge of the village, scaring the goat away. A small thing, perhaps offering an ironic comment on the contradictions of war, but reflecting a value system that aspired to protect innocents from harm. But aerial missions, particularly low flying, had its hazards.\n\nAfghan rebels inevitably captured .303 rifles and cartridges. So unless an aircraft was on a dive bombing or strafing run, the rule was to stay above 3,000 feet, out of the range of rifle fire. “The tribesman is a good natural shot, and is fully alive to the necessity for deflection when shooting at fast moving aircraft,” warns the pocket-size 1939 manual Frontier Warfare—India (Army and Royal Air Force). However, if detailed reconnaissance required pilots to fly lower, they should “make full use of their speed, fly an irregular course, and use their weapons to keep down hostile fire….”\n\nIf bad weather or ground fire forced a pilot down over hostile territory, his standing orders were: “first remove the bolt from the Lewis gun and throw overboard.” Once landed, the pilot had to burn the plane “by firing a bullet / flare into the petrol tank.” If escape was blocked, “It will be wisest to surrender with good grace and a bold demeanor, preferably to the older and more important-looking men among the crowd; the younger element is liable to be hot-headed and unpleasant.”\n\nThe British offered a reward of 9,000 rupees for return of a downed airman. This was generally successful. There had been instances for decades of rebellious tribesmen castrating captured British servicemen and bureaucrats in order to prevent them breeding more invaders. So the RAF provided what were commonly known as “goolie chits”; safe conduct letters for air crew, “goolie” being a Pashto word for testicles. The chits guaranteed a significant reward if the bearer was returned with all his parts intact. This morbid prospect was immortalized in an RAF Mess Hall drinking song by the refrain: “No balls at all. No balls at all. When your engine cuts out, you’ll have no balls at all.”\n\nProvided an officer returned from air operations with all his parts intact, or did not die from the many tropical diseases to which Europeans were susceptible, RAF service on the North West Frontier offered both officers and air crew a pleasant life style at bases like Fort Miram Shah.\n\nINSERT : evaluation of India service. Attitude to independence.\n\nAn RAF Audax on the North West Frontier\n\nA Bristol Bulldog\n\nHawker Harts on a plateau. Breakfast under the wing..\n\nMONOPLANES\n\nDuring this period, aviation engineers were developing the successor to the biplane.\n\n!936\n\nAir displays were staged to popularize aviation as a daring, noble calling.\n\nUniversities offered flying courses.\n\nTo handle their increased pilot intake, the RAF needed well trained instructors. My father resumed these duties when he was posted back to England in November 1936, He was promoted from Flight Officer to Flight Lieutenant, and would spend the next three years at a number of RAF bases, training pilots in the flying techniques of different aircraft, navigation, precision bombing, and aerial combat. The RAF had been developing its first two monoplane fighters, the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire. In 1936 the Hurricane went into production followed by the Spitfire a year later. My father would learn to fly both planes, then instruct others in their handling. He would ultimately instruct instructors in flight training procedures. Here is his official training record.\n\nTrained pilots received a certificate.\n\nThe imminent prospect of a second air war, Speed! became a priority in design. In late 1934, the Air Ministry ordered Hawker to create an “Interceptor Monoplane ” able to carry a total of eight guns. Here’s the appropriately named “Hurricane ” prototype, photographed before its first flight in November 1935.\n\nHawker improved aerodynamics by making landing gear retractable, The new Rolls Royce Merlin engine, was capable of delivering a maximum level speed of 315 mph (507 km/h). The RAF test pilot’s report on the Hurricane’s maiden flight stated: “The aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices”.\n\nThe Supermarine Spitfire prototype photographed below displayed promise but needed improvement. The Spitfire’s stressed-skin construction required precision engineering skills and techniques which were rare in the aviation industry. Initially the Air Ministry passed, but the designers persisted.\n\nSignificant improvements resulted. Retractable landing gear, and an enclosed cockpit were installed plus a new elliptical wing, designed to be as thin as possible, thereby reducing drag. The Rolls Royce Merlin engine was enhanced by a new a three-bladed metal propeller and a new cockpit hood, providing a maximum speed to 348 mph (557 km/h), making the Spitfire faster than the Hawker Hurricane. On 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, an impressive number for its time.\n\nHere are fully restored replicas of each aircraft passing along the white cliffs of Dover as part of a WW2 air display.\n\nThe Spitfire and Hurricane’s future adversary would be the Messerschmidt ME 109,top speed of 350 miles (570 km) per hour. Here’s a full working replica photographed at a recent air show.\n\nSeveral online tutorials compare both the Spitfire and Hurricane against their most frequent opponent the Messerschmidt.109. Check them out when we reach the Battle of Britain. http://www.spitfireperformance.com/spit1vrs109e.html.\n\nAs war loomed, firepower became an important issue in fighter aircraft design. This twin engined Westland Whirlwind carried four closely grouped 20 mm cannon mounted in the nose. Clustering the weapons eliminated the convergence problems of wing-mounted guns. Its concentrated firepower (600 rounds a minute) was intended to strafe columns of vehicles, supply trains, and shipping.\n\nFaster than the Spitfire, the Whirlwind had good maneuverability, climb performance, and an enhanced “fighting view”. The pilot sat high under one of the world’s first full bubble canopies with a commanding view of the target. The prototype produced in 1938 was the most heavily armed fighter of its era. Due to problems with its engine, only 114 were produced. The Westland Whirlwind was among the 80 different aircraft listed in my father’s logbook. One of the more unusual was the Supermarine Walrus. a single-engine amphibious biplane intended for reconnaissance.\n\nWith its all-metal fuselage, pilots found it noisy, cold, and uncomfortable. This particular Walrus was sent to Australia, were it served in WW2 before disappearing during a night reconnaissance. The Walrus could be modifies for catapult launching from cruisers or battleships, For those who like to get into the weeds of aviation history, this 1940 instructional film reveals the complex technological process and precise teamwork involved in catapulting a seaplane off a ship. 26 minutes in, there are good shots of the Walrus catapult take off, water landing, and crane recovery. Plus one hair raising moment @…\n\nAs part of an exercise, my father learned to land a plane on an aircraft carrier. The weather was not great, the seas choppy. On his approach he could see the carrier’s deck yawing below. He had to gauge the right moment to cut power.\n\nBut a happy landing followed.\n\nFrom 1936 till mid 1940, Flight Lieutenant E. T. Smith served as a training instructor at various RAF bases. As he learned and taught the flight characteristics of a variety of fighters and bombers, he earned the nickname “expert Eric”. He is featured next to his commanding officer in a cartoon published as “Aces of Tern Hill”.\n\nThe new King George the Sixth, who had got his wings in 1918 serving in France, rose to Group Captain by 1922, and had become Air Vice Marshall of the Royal Air Force upon the sudden abdication of his brother Edward the Eighth. In 1938 he visited the Central Flying School at Upavon, and met with all the instructors including my father, seen here in the top row. “H.M. The King” is seated in the center of the front row. George the Sixth was played by Colin Firth in the movie The King’s Speech. Other aspects of his life are featured in the Netflix series The Crown.\n\nThe nomadic and uncertain life of an RAF officer was not ideal for long term relationships. My father had girlfriends wherever he was stationed, but none became serious until October 1938. Here s my father’s letter to his mother who had travelled from Auckland , New Zealand to visit him that year, and had recently sailed back.\n\nMy mother, as much as my father, was a significant influence on my life, So I will digress for a moment and tell her story up to the point she met my father.\n\nVera Eileen Baxter was born on April 4th 1918. World War One was grinding slowly to its conclusion. Young Vera lived in an upstairs flat in Putney, London, with her mother Eileen and father John Baxter, an Northern Irish merchant captain who was often away at sea. Vera was an only child. A subsequent male baby was lost in miscarriage. When at home on leave, her father was frequently out of the house. “Why doesn’t Daddy take me out like other girl’s daddies do?” She recalled once asking her mother. Extracts from her hand written memoir will provide another perspective on RAF life. Also, the account of her childhood chronicles the trauma of an Irish/English custody battle of the period.\n\nWhen my mother was eight years old, John George Briggs Baxter, to give him his full name, returned home from sea a week earlier than expected, to find his wife Mrs. Madge Amelia Baxter, nee Clarkson, absent, and his daughter cared for by friends, who advised him she was just taking a short holiday with a lady friend and would be back soon. In fact my grandmother had become increasingly lonely during her husband’s long absences, and had formed a relationship with another unhappily married man. They were spending a few days together across the Channel in France.\n\nIn my mother’s memoir she writes how her father came into her room late at night, sat on the end of her bed, silhouetted by a shaft of light from the landing, and burst into tears. Amid heaving sobs, he told Vera that she would never see her mother again. She had committed the marital crime of adultery, and he was instituting divorce proceedings. John Baxter was a proud Irish Protestant, a member of the Loyal Orange Association, an anti Catholic political group. Back then, divorce between Protestants was permitted under these circumstances, but it would be a blot on the family name. The anger and bitterness my grandfather felt at his betrayal would be most keenly experienced by his child. The scar from this traumatic night would never fully fade.\n\nHe took young Vera immediately to his father’s house in Northern Ireland to be looked after by his sisters, who resented the imposition as did all senior members of the extended family. Great aunts Gertrude and Harriet were the worst, referring to Vera’s mother as “that Scarlett Woman…” They would not call her Vera, the name her mother chose; instead she was called by her middle name, Eileen, because it was more Irish. These aunts would make public show of their religious devotion, praying fervently, when they accompanied their brother and his niece to Church on Sundays. John Baxter was somewhat deaf and tended to fall asleep during sermons. His sisters took this opportunity to exchange gossip about the other congregants, particularly the women, Their hypocritical behavior was digested by my mother, feigning attention to the sermon. contributing to her life long suspicion of organized religion.\n\nVera’s aunts put her into a series of Dickensian boarding schools, the first of which expelled her when they learned she was “a child of divorce.” A new school was found for her; Clair Lodge in Newcastle, County Down. a building she describes as “gaunt.” It sat at the foot of the Mountains of Mourne, in its own grounds, surrounded by a thick hedge, right beside a beach, sometimes lashed by gale force winds. On one occasion the girl’s dormitory windows facing the beach were blown in. It took days before repairs were accomplished.\n\n“The winter months were unspeakably cold.We washed in cold water from the jugs on washstands, and often had to break the ice before doing so.” Food was “reasonable, but I never want to see massed swede again as long as I live.”\n\nMedical care was survival of the fittest.\n\n“If you became ill at Clare Lodge, the treatment was to be confined to a large empty bedroom on the far side of the building. No doctor ever visited. Miss Parkes brought the meals on a tray. I had the usual share of childhood diseases; chicken pox – ‘Don’t scratch, Eileen!’ Mumps and the agony of forcing food down with aching jaws to avoid having the same meal brought back again. One unfinished bread and butter pudding was served three days running till it turned sour. “\n\nMy worst illness was whooping cough. This time I was not put to bed, and walked around with it for three weeks. Once, during lunch, I was red/purple in the face from whooping, and Miss Agnes said” Stop coughing, Eileen dear, you’re making yourself worse!” Mercifully it was the last day of term, and when my grandfather picked me up, I was violently sick, and he took me straight to the doctors. I remembers him standing over my bed, as I whooped and whooped, saying ” She’s going to die..”\n\nFor four and a half years Vera was often cold, hungry, and made to feel inferior. Throughout this period her mother petitioned for visitation rights: initially she was allowed only one hour per visit.\n\n” I longed to see her, but I was constantly being filled with propaganda against her. Prior to her visit, my grandfather stormed around the house, spitting out hatred of her. and offered me a penny if I did not see her. My mind was in a complete muddle. By the time she arrived, I ran and hid under a bed. She eventually found me,, knelt down begging me to come out. We had a tearful re-union. then she had to go back to England. ,\n\nIn the morality of the times, Vera’s mother was “the guilty party” and had lost custody. . Finally, having married the man who had been the cause of the divorce, she could now offer a stable home, she petitioned for custody. The court decided the best interests of the child, now turning thirteen, were to live with her mother in England where she had grown up, rather than in Ireland, where her father would be away at sea for long periods.\n\nVera moved to England to live with her mother and her new stepfather, Mr. Fred Medwin, a businessman, whose fortunes waxed and waned over the years.\n\n” I came back to England with an Irish brogue that was so thick that my stepfather could not understand a lot of what I said. Now I had to be groomed to be a well mannered English lady. I was grateful to be back with my mother but terrified of my stepfather. He was subject to outbursts of rage, and would yell loudly, with his eyes bulging in anger, usually picking on some small thing quite suddenly. Each time this happened my stomach would do several somersaults, and my heart raced. The old cliche ‘out of the frying pan into the fire’ applied to those early days.”\n\nStepfather Fred Medwin, with a grown son of his own, was a good parent, despite fits of temper. John Baxter, her actual father, disowned Vera when she succumbed to pressure to assume her stepfather’s surname. She never heard from her father again. Another blow upon the wound. Vera, no longer Eileen. was once again addressed as Vera. She was sent to a girls boarding school, Abbotsford in Broadstairs, where she excelled at French and piano lessons, but following the pattern of her Irish years, was rebellious and a misfit. Things changed at age 16, when she was sent to “finishing school”: An Ursuline convent school in Brussels, which specialized in teaching the girls to be good cooks, as preparation for marriage. The warmth of the Catholic Nuns contrasted with the disdain she had experienced from Protestant clergy. Her confidence grew. She became fluent in French, and learned dressmaking. For the first time in memory she began to feel happy. Then she was cast as the lead in two stage shows at the school, performing in French,. She had found her calling. She decided to become an actress, perhaps to receive from an audience the approval she had been denied throughout her formative years.\n\nDue to a financial downturn, the family could not afford to send her to RADA. She interviewed with agents, some of whom made it clear what the price of representation would be. She declined. The best entry level strategy was to join an extras agency, get booked for crowd scenes at a guinea a day, be noticed and someday be given a one line part. She signed up for crowd work immediately. There were four movie studios—Pinewood, Beaconsfield, Denham, and Elstree—not far from Cookham where the Medwin family lived. Stepfather Fred’s business had bounced back and he was operating two local hotels and renting out another property. He bought Vera, in her words, a ‘terrible old bone shaker’ for ten pounds sterling. She was regularly at work across the range of studios. Extras had to provide their own clothes except when the movie was a period piece. Occasionally she was the lighting stand-in for a prominent actress Diana Churchill. Same height, same hair coloring. She started to score those 1-line parts.. Waitress: “Your boiled egg, sir.” Three days’ work playing a newspaper reporter followed. She was slowly making her way up the ladder. Acting is a thankless profession, in which few however talented make a decent living. But my mother had beauty, drive and an extrovert personality that masked her insecurities. She might have done well. Then she met a young RAF officer, my father. It was apparently love at first sight.\n\nResuming my father’s story, his letter to his mother continues, with financial concerns, and an indication that relations with his father had improved since his departure to the UK eight years before. Trenchard-Smith Senior could only have been impressed with his son’s application to his chosen career, and had apparently sent some money previously so that his son could buy a car upon his return from service in India. A Flight Lieutenant’s salary was tight for a married couple, and my father would have to bear all expenses, including purchasing a life insurance policy, until the RAF marriage allowance adjusted his yearly pay.\n\nThe next section of the letter offers a clue to his father’s prejudice towards those who were not White Anglo Saxon Protestants. Although there was not an outright prohibition on marriage to Roman Catholics, such a match would not have been popular. Vera’s mother and stepfather were Protestant, but open minded enough to send Vera to a Catholic “finishing school” for girls in Belgium, where she learned excellent culinary skills from Cordon Blue chefs. These were evident during their early courtship when my father “popped down” to see her each weekend.\n\nFood at an RAF Officer’s Mess was, shall we say, undistinguished. My mother’s cooking was phenomenal, and she taught me to prepare a passable range of dishes. among the many educational gifts she passed on. The letter then refers, with my father’s sense of irony, to a conversation during his mother’s visit, about him being ” a confirmed bachelor”, before concluding he was awfully happy.\n\nMy mother, late in life, began a handwritten memoir which she never finished. I will quote from it occasionally where it sheds light on social conditions and RAF life that she and my father experienced together.\n\nThey met when she was invited by a hopeful RAF officer suitor to accompany him to a Saturday nightclub ball at the officers mess at RAF, Upavon. where Flight Lt. Eric Smith was also stationed. When the ball was in full swing, she noticed “aa tall dark, handsome man who was staring at me intently. A few seconds later I waas told that there was someone who wanted to meet me.” When they were introduced, it was a classic case of love at first sight. or as my mother put it. “We both fell like a ton of bricks.“,\n\nTheir first date took place a few days later, lunch and a movie at the local cinema screening a revival of Rudoph Valentino’s silent classic The Son of the Sheik. Like many cinemas of the day, the program featured an organ recital in the interval. With blasts on the pipes, the instrument and its player rose from beneath the stage, with a banner sign round its base – ” up came slowly – Eric Smith and his organ. This amused us a lot.” When Eric delivered me home, he parked and blurted out “I’m madly in love with you..Will you marry me?” I said yes, and crept into the house on cloud nine.”\n\nIt was a big decision to propose marriage 20 days after first meeting. One factor that may have impacted my father on his visits to Vera Medwin at her stepfather’s house was witnessing her distress when her stepfather drunkenly argued with her mother. According to my mother, my father told her as he left not to worry. ” I will take you away from all this.” Luckily Fred took to Eric straight away, as did her mother.\n\nVera’s stepfather Fred Medwin,, seen here standing beside her mother, gave the bride away, in the absence of her real father who had ceased contact with his daughter when she changed her name to Medwin. As my mother put it: “He threw me away.”\n\nFlight Lt. E. T. Smith had several weeks leave due to him so he took his new bride for a honeymoon in France. Fred helped out with the cost of motoring from Paris to the Riviera. My mother’s account in her memoir, when read today, has a fin de ciecle quality. It was June 1939. They toured the Eiffel Tower, Napoleon’s tomb. Palais de Versailles.Taxis drove at frightening speed, though this probably didn’t bother my father. They saw night club performances forbidden in England; nude and semi nude girls at Bal Tavern and the Folies Bergère. Linguistic differences amused my mother who was semi-fluent in French. When the honeymooners requested a double bed, it was called un lit Anglais. Similarly a contraceptive was un capot Anglais, which British people of the day called a French letter. Both nations blaming the other for sex. First night in Paris, the honeymooners got oyster poisoning from a restaurant famous for its oysters. When they finally emerged from their room 2 days later looking tired and disheveled, the hotel staff, my mother said, gave them admiring looks.\n\nThey drove to Monte Carlo, economized by camping out on alternate nights. At Hotel Chateau Diedato my mother had her first sight of the Mediterranean, where she enjoyed time on a pebbly beach. She reported how my father in comparison extolled the smooth sandy beaches of Auckland and Sydney. My mother would spend her last 30 years living a short walk from the sandy beach of Avalon, New South Wales. Perhaps her honeymoon influenced her choice. They certainly by her account had a good time. They bought “dirty french postcards” and sent them to Eric’s brothers and his fellow officers.\n\nAt the hotel where they spent a week, the honeymooners were befriended a small wirey German man in his fifties. “He said we looked so happy he was sure we were not married.” recalled my mother. His name was Peter Bloch. He would reconnect with my parents in England. He had been a solicitor to the former German Kaiser Wilhelm , who was deposed in 1918. His service to the Kaiser was engraved on his gold cigarette lighter. Mr Bloch’s wife had denounced him to the Nazis, causing him to flee, and perhaps influencing Mr. Bloch’s views on marriage. He had originally been born in England and was now applying for a British passport. Given the recent Nazi annexations, he was sure war was imminent. Other British holiday makers dismissed it, believing Mr. Hitler will keep his word this time. A few felt if there was war, it would be short, that there could never be another conflagration like The Great War. British complacency, even ambivalence, about the Nazi threat has been well depicted in a range of Brit TV series . As for their honeymoon my parents put such thoughts aside and enjoy a beachside oasis of peace while they could. This involved visits to casinos , illegal in England, nightclubs and cabaret till the wee hours, in the company of two British doctors on leave from Somalia, and the spritely Peter Bloch, who despite is age could out-drink everybody, yet was still the first on the beach the next morning. He knew an era was about to end.\n\nUpon their return to England, my parents were soon moved into married housing on the base at at RAF Upavon. My mother derived some amusement, which I share, from the bureaucratic manner in which all household inventory was documented on the official form, with items listed as if standing stiffly to attention. ” For instance: Mats/ Door, Mats/Bath Cork, and importantly, Pots/ Kitchen to differentiate from Pots/ Chamber. Now, if you reached the rank of Group Captain, your Pots/ Chamber had a gold ring around the rim and a crown…”\n\nNot a time, my mother thought, when a man needed to be reminded of his rank. She always had an irreverent attitude to officialdom, Her memoir provides a window into the life of an RAF wife.\n\nExtract\n\nIn August of 1939, Britain and Poland signed an agreement of mutual assistance. This mean that were any foreign power to interfere with either country militarily, the other would rush to their aid. Days later, on September 1st, Germany crossed the Polish border under a flag of nationalism, on an invented crusade to liberate the oppressed Germans of Danzig, a semi-independent area created by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919.\n\nAll the officers at Central Flying School, Upavon, including my father, wanted to go on operations, They were told they were too valuable as instructors training future pilots, for which massive recruitment was underway. The courses lasted six to eight weeks. Many retired officers rejoined the RAF and came to the CFS for a “refresher course”. Instructors like my father would assess their flying skills on aircraft they had flown before, and introduce them to the new Hurricane and Spitfire. The commanding officer of the Refresher Squadron listed this pilot’s ability as “Exceptional”, the same rating my father held.\n\nOne of the pilots taking a refresher course at the Central Fylying School early in i940 was Douglas Bader, whose RAF career was immortalized in Paul Brickhill’s best seller and 1956 movie Reach For The Sky, which topped the UK box office that year.\n\nBader had graduated from CFS in 1930, the same year my father entered the school. They were friendly but not close at that time. They had different attitudes to flying. My father was a keen but prudent adventurer, cautiously pushing the boundaries of new aircraft. Bader was an extrovert who saw flying as a means of demonstrating his mastery of the environment. He had established a reputation for aerobatics at the 1931 Hendon Air Show, and was training to win the next year’s title. Two pilots had already been been killed disobeying regulations by practicing maneuvers at under 500 feet. On 14 December 1931, at the Reading Aero Club, Bader attempted some low-flying aerobatics in a Bristol Bulldog biplane, apparently on a dare. He crashed when the tip of the left wing touched the ground. Reach For The Sky accurately recreated the cartwheel nature of the crash.\n\nIn his last barrel roll, he swung the tip of the upper wing too low to the ground.The plane cartwheeled and broke in half.\n\nBader’s legs were mangled in the process. Both had to be amputated—one above and one below the knee. Bader’s report in his logbook read:. “Crashed slow rolling near the ground. Bad show.”\n\nAfter a long convalescence, during which he needed morphine for pain relief, Bader was fitted with 1932 issue artificial legs. This was a hard adjustment for a man who had captained rugby, cricket and hockey teams as a student. He met and married Thelma Edwards, a waitress in the local tea room. She greatly helped in his recovery,. He fought hard to regain his former abilities. In time, he was able to drive a specially modified car, play golf, and even dance.\n\nAs soon as he was physically able, Bader successfully retook all necessary flight training courses. Despite political connections, Bader was nonetheless declared unfit for duty. He was invalided out, and joined a company the would become Shell Oil.\n\nAs war approached, Bader repeatedly requested that the Air Ministry accept him back into the RAF, but he was told only “ground jobs” were being offered. Using his connections at the Air Ministry, Bader eventually regained a medical categorization for operational flying at the end of November 1939 and was posted to the Central Flying School , where my father instructed, to be given a refresher course on modern types of aircraft. He had convinced the Air Ministry that a fighter pilot really did not need legs to shoot at the enemy.\n\nOn 27 November, 1939 eight years after his accident, and days after his arrival at CFS, Bader flew solo again in an Avro Tutor. My father, who was overseeing his refresher course, was a witness. Bader, once airborne, he could not resist the temptation to turn the biplane upside down at 600 feet inside the circuit area. On the few occasions my father spoke about Bader, he was ambivalent. While he respected Bader’s courage and determination, he found him a somewhat overbearing personality, always seeking to be the center of attention, his daredevil behavior potentially a risk to other pilots. The low level stunt he just pulled to impress the Flying School revealed he had lost none of his penchant for recklessness. But my father recognized that war, particularly war in the air, needs daredevils. Who would not be inspired by a legless man volunteering for aerial combat? Bader certainly had real skills as a pilot. He quickly progressed through the Fairey Battle and Miles Magister, the last training stage before flying Spitfires and Hurricanes. In January 1940, Bader left the CFS to join 19th Squadron on operational duty. When the Battle of Britain began, his skills in aerial combat became evident. He would be credited with downing 24 Luftwaffe planes between 1940 and 1941.\n\nAll RAF officers wanted their turn on “ops”. From the start of the period known as “the phony war”. my father’s requests for “ops” were repeatedly denied because of his value as an instructor of instructors, He found this particularly galling in May 1940 during the collapse of the British Expeditionary Force and the evacuation of Dunkirk, the chaos of which is well conveyed in Charles Cundall’s famous painting. Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk movie brilliantly captures the RAF experience supporting the evacuation.\n\nFearing the potential loss of the army, the British government were reluctant to risk experienced pilots they would need to defend Britain for the invasion likely to follow. My father chafed. My mother was to a degree relieved. Her childhood had embedded a fear of abandonment. heightened by marrying an RAF pilot. She knew flying fatalities were a fact of life in peacetime. The scale of the war to come could barely be imagined. My father’s importance as an instructor at CFS would at least delay the possibility of the telegram all wartime wives dreaded. At the height of the Battle of Britain, the life of a Spitfire pilot was could be as little as four weeks.\n\nBetween February and May 1940, Bader practiced formation flying and air tactics, as well as undertaking patrols over convoys out at sea. During this time, he crashed a Spitfire on take-off. He had forgotten to switch the propeller pitch from coarse pitch ( for high speed flying) to fine pitch (for take off), resulting in the aircraft careering down the runway at 80 mph before crashing. Despite a head wound, Bader tried to walk to another Spitfire for a second attempt and found that his artificial legs had been buckled from being forced beneath the rudder pedals during the crash. He recognized that if he had not lost his legs previously, he would have definitely lost them then. Recovery this time was a matter of ordering replacement legs. Despite this repeat snafu, Bader’s skills as a Spitfire pilot became evident when he brought down a Dornier in action over Dunkirk..\n\nBader had his own ideas about aerial combat. He favored using the sun and altitude to ambush the enemy, but the RAF did not share his opinions. Official orders/doctrine dictated that pilots should fly line-astern and attack singly. Bader began using his Air Ministry contacts to lobby for the “Big Wing” approach, a massive formation of six squadrons in a frontal attack on the approaching bombers. As his “kill count” grew, the Air Ministry took note. He was promoted from pilot officer through Flight Lt. to Squadron Leader within a year.\n\nBut when the Blitz on London started, Ft. Lt. E.T. Smith got his wish for action. He was assigned to a squadron on reserve night fighter duty. He did not like to talk about his wartime experiences. He did not want me growing up during Britain’s decades long victory parade, believing War was glorious. A night fighter pilot’s task was challenging. Radar could provide the direction of enemy bombers, but once they were engaged and dispersed, individual enemy aircraft were hard to locate accurately in the dark. Being in the right place at the right time for those few seconds of target visibility was a matter of luck. Pursuit is a lot easier in daylight. On his few missions he was unsure whether any of the bursts he fired would have brought down an enemy plane. The only other detail he offered was that he received, as a night fighter pilot, an extra ration of carrots, because of the perceived benefit to eyesight of a heavy dose of beta carotene. Vitamin A.\n\nThe Ministry of Information (MOI) had mounted a big campaign to support food rationing regulations. Food was a weapon of war. Both its propagation and conservation were vital. Embedded in the propaganda campaign for sustainable nutrition was an additional objective; the deliberate attempt to disguise a significant reason for RAF success against the Luftwaffe – Radar, a secret advanced warning system, that enabled RAF fighters to lie in wait for incoming waves of bombers. An explanation for the uptick in pilot victories needed to be circulated. The MOI interviewed RAF night fighter ace, John Cunningham, nicknamed “Cat’s Eyes”, who ultimately shot down 20 planes, 19 at night. He attributed his accuracy in targeting to eating an excess of carrots. They improved his eyesight, he said. The MOI published the interview, the British public responded, and the campaign took off. As food rationing increased, the carrot and the potato became national characters throughout the war.\n\nThe carrot became a sugar substitute when rationing limited two people to 8 ounces of sugar a week. The kids are unimpressed.\n\nEven Walt Disney lent a hand. Did this inspire Bugs Bunny?\n\nSome have said the publicized benefits of carrots to Battle of Britain fighter pilots was in fact part of a disinformation campaign to deflect attention from a new technology critical to Air Defense – Radar. It certainly helped enshrine the carotene benefit in Myth. There is some anecdotal evidence that the Luftwaffe might have believed it and issued some fighter pilots with extra carrot rations. Rationing had begun in 1940. Here’s a collage of food propaganda posters.\n\nBy September 1940 my father had resumed his role as instructor of instructors at Central Flying School. Douglas Bader would occasionally visit. He was becoming a national celebrity as the legless air ace with an impressive list of credited “kills”. Here is a colorized photo of him boarding a Spitfire without assistance, swinging the longer artificial leg into the cockpit first.\n\nThe winter of 1940 – 41 was particularly severe. The water pipes in my parents’ quarters froze. Roads and pathways were icy and treacherous. There were eight steps leading up to the Central Flying School Officers’ Mess. Newly promoted Squadron Leader Bader slipped on an icy patch and fell while attending the Saturday night dance, splitting his dress pants open below the crotch. Colleagues helped him inside. My mother carried needle and thread in her handbag and offered to sew up the tear. Douglas Bader sat in his underwear in a bathroom, while my mother used her convent taught needlepoint skills on his trousers. Once restored for public exhibition, Bader asked my mother to dance. His wife of ten years, Thelma, to whom he was devoted, was the only woman he ever danced with, but she could not attend. Would my mother oblige? My mother’s memoir continues: ” He felt they would manage if I took a larger step with one foot than the other. As we foxtrotted to the center of the room, suddenly Douglas let out a yell of pain, then hobbled with me to the nearest chair. Everyone was looking in apprehension. Then Douglas started laughing uncontrollably. I kept asking with concern what was wrong. ” If you must know, ducky, I got my balls caught in my false leg.”\n\nHilarity ensued. Bader was an ebullient extrovert, popular in the Mess. My mother recalls him amusing an audience with one of the ironies of being a double amputee serving officer. Boot polish kept getting on his socks. The system required that an officer leave the shoes he needed to be cleaned outside his room overnight for his batman to take care of before breakfast. In Bader’s case each shoe contained his artificial leg, still fitted with a sock. The batman would not remove the shoes from the “tin legs”before polishing, always smearing the socks. Social history trivia is a window on British classism.\n\nDuring the Battle of Britain, Bader’s competitive nature and genuine aviation skills made him an ace fighter pilot. He was eventually credited with 22 aerial victories. One advantage that Bader had over his fellow fighter pilots came courtesy of his amputations. The high g-force experienced by pilots throughout combat often caused them to pass out, as the blood was forced to drain from their brains and into their legs. Bader’s dual amputation meant that he didn’t lose as much blood to his lower extremities, allowing him to maintain blood pressure and stay conscious for longer.\n\nDuring 1941 Bader’s wing was re-equipped with Spitfire VBs, which had two Hispano 20 mm cannon and four .303 machine guns. Bader flew a Mk VA equipped with eight .303 machine guns, as he insisted that these guns were more effective against fighter opposition. His tactics required a close-in approach in which he felt the lower calibre weapons had a more devastating concentrated effect.\n\nFor a better understanding of the war in the air, there is much analysis available on line on the relative merits of the Spitfire, Hurricane and Messerschmidt.\n\nIn fact an actual trial of a Hurricane versus an Me 109 was conducted in May 1940 by the RAF, using a captured undamaged Messerschmidt.\n\nBoth aircraft were flown by experienced fighter pilots. The trial focussed on four comparisons: take-off performance, rate of climb to 15,000 feet, dogfighting; and line-astern formation flying.\n\nIn the first test, the two aircraft took off together and climbed straight to 15,000 feet. The performance of the Me 109 in this test was significantly better than that of the Hurricane, despite the fact that the Hurricane was fitted with a constant speed airscrew and flown at full throttle and full revs.\n\nAt 15,000 feet the aircraft separated and approached one-another head-on and commenced the dogfight. The Hurricane pilot did a stall turn followed by a quick vertical turn, enabling him to lock onto the 109’s tail. The pilot of the 109 was unable to prevent this maneuver succeeding. From that point the Hurricane pilot had no difficulty remaining on the tail of the Me 109. The pilot of the 109 tried all possible maneuvers, concluding with the one most usually employed by German pilots, namely a half-roll and vertical dive. The Hurricane followed this maneuver but the 109 drew away at the commencement of the dive, being the faster machine.\n\nThe pilot who flew the Hurricane gave this opinion..\n\n“The Me 109 is faster than the Hurricane by some 30 to 40 miles an hour on the straight and level. It can out-climb and initially out-dive the Hurricane. On the other hand it has not the maneuverability of the Hurricane, which can turn inside the Me 109 without difficulty.”\n\nThe conclusions drawn from these tests enabled the RAF to train new pilots in combat strategy and tactics to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses of the Hurricane. retired Wing Commander “Bunny” Current gave this evaluation after the war.\n\n“I flew [Hurricanes] almost daily for just short of three years, from December 1938 to August 1941, when I took command of a Spitfire squadron in Hampshire. The Hurricane was a magnificent war-horse, with its unsurpassed gun platform in the leading edge of the wings, which had a deadly promise. It had no vices whatsoever, with superb reliability, and was so easy to fly in all weather conditions. Totally trustworthy in all respects, it was a confidence-giving aeroplane, loved by all who flew it.”\n\nWhile the Spitfire became the dominant fighter by the end of the war, the Hurricane would be responsible for 60% of German aircraft shot down during the Battle of Britain. The loser in aerial combat, if he survived the bullets disabling the plane, had one chance to stay alive as his aircraft plummeted down, his parachute.\n\n.\n\nThe folded silk canopy, checked by the pilot before take off, also provided a comfortable seat. U Tube has an interesting piece on WW2 parachutes, British, German and American.\n\n544 RAF pilots of Fighter Command and more than 2,500 German aircrew were killed during the Battle of Britain. .At the height of the battle, the average life of a Spitfire pilot was 4 weeks, as more and more pilots went into the meat grinder.. Squadron Leaders E.T. Smith and Squadron Leader D. Bader knew the law of averages was not in their favor. As did Vera Smith and Thelma Bader. But the ethos of the time was to suppress emotion, grit your teeth, get on with it. Angst was suppressed by light hearted banter, dance parties, cigarettes and alcohol. Movies at the local picture palace, accompanied by reassuring propaganda newsreels. On radio the new Prime Minister Winston Churchill lifted morale with stirring rhetoric spiced with wit. Hitler had declaimed over the airwaves. “Germany will wring Britain’s neck like a chicken!” After the Battle of Britain, Churchill quipped back : “Some chicken. Some neck.”\n\nAs with all service men and women, their lives would be effected by the strategic decisions of high command. In 1940 Sir Hugh Montague 1st Viscount Trenchard, whose portrait as Metropolitan Police Commissioner is reproduced here, returned from retirement to exert his influence on defense policy. which would have an effect on missions undertaken by 242 Squadron, North Weald, where Bader and my father were stationed.\n\nThis was Viscount Trenchard’s official portrait upon retiring as Metropolitan Police Commissioner in 1936. The regalia looks a bit ridiculous today for an officer of the law. You might reflect on why the chosen pose had him gazing upwards to the right. The pomp and paraphernalia of officialdom always amuses me.\n\nA brief digression on the iconic and politically skillful Father of the Royal Air Force,. Viscount Trenchard had a powerful personality . “Boom”, it bears repeating, was the Whitehall nickname.for “his stentorian utterances and low rumbling tones”. During his five years as Metropolitan Police Commissioner and subsequently, he was never reticent about voicing his opinion as a newly created Viscount from the pulpit of the House of Lords, if he felt the interests of the RAF he founded were threatened in any way. He opposed the Air Ministry for prioritizing manufacture of Fighters over Bombers. He offered a better plan for the air defense of Singapore , which the government would soon regret rejecting. In 1939, then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, hoping to remove Trenchard from his public platform in England, offered the gadfly peer the post of organizing advanced training for RAF pilots in Canada. All offered posts were declined. After the failure of the Norwegian campaign, Trenchard used the House of Lords to criticize the Government’s half-hearted prosecution of the war. .\n\nWhen Winston Churchill replaced Chamberlain, he wanted to find a place for this this leader in the field of aviation warfare. It is said that Viscount Trenchard aspired to be both in charge of the Air Ministry as well as becoming some form of joint secretary of defense, making the RAF a driver in the war effort. rather than a component. That was more power than Churchill was prepared to give away. Trenchard realized that by his rash demands had excluded himself from a pivotal role in the British war effort, so he became an unofficial Inspector-General for the RAF, visiting deployed squadrons across Europe and North Africa on morale-raising visits. In May 1940 Trenchard visited 12th Squadron in France.\n\nBut Trenchard always had Churchill’s ear. He successfully lobbied for the removal of the Chief of the Air Staff and the Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command. Both were replaced by Trenchard protégés.\n\nTrenchard proposed that the RAF should “Lean Towards France” – Go on the offensive, having won the battle of Britain, engage the Luftwaffe over French skies, and win the resulting battle of attrition. That was the theory, of which Douglas Bader was a strong supporter. The RAF introduced a new offensive stance: the “Circus” sorties, daylight raids undertaken by a small force of bombers with a powerful fighter escort.\n\nThey were intended to lure enemy fighters into the air so that they could be outnumbered, engaged and destroyed, while protecting the bombers from attack on a specific target; the initial code name: Ramrod. Rhubarb was code for a small-scale attack by fighters using cloud cover, to surprise and destroy German aircraft in the air or on the ground.\n\nThe RAF’s ‘Circus’ raids, had been under way since early 1941. British intelligence had detected the imminent rift in the Nazi/Soviet alliance.and observed much of the Luftwaffe assigned to protect the French coast was being transferred to the east in the build up to the invasion of Russia. When Nazi tanks rolled across the Russian border on June 11 , the RAF stepped up their attacks over occupied Europe to draw Luftwaffe units back to France and take pressure off Stalin’s Russian Front, The Luftwaffe countered by stationed its remaining squadrons at bases further inland, from where they could decline combat or engage RAF fighters in places where they were at a tactical disadvantage for lack of fuel.\n\nMy father finally had his requests to leave flying school and “go on ops” accepted. He was transferred to 242 Squadron, which was assigned to the ” Circus” sweeps. RAF pilots and aircrew flying over enemy territory faced the possibility of capture, interrogation by the German military and confinement in a prisoner of war camp. The Great War had provided both sides with some experience in handling their respective prisoners. All ranks were duly briefed on what to expect, what information a POW was required to divulge – only name, rank, serial number, next of kin. In April 1941, my father attended a briefing by an RAF Intelligence Officer, who outlined some evasion and escape technique. It was an officer’s duty to try to escape, because by doing so, they were forcing the Nazi war machine to divert troops and resources for their recapture.\n\nCircus raids by 242 Squadron at the beginning of June had been uneventful.\n\nOn June 17, the Squadron was ordered to provide close escort to Blenheim Bombers on a raid over France. Squadron Leader E. T. Smith had a meal with his fellow pilots, then attended final briefings from Wing Commander Kellett, who led the mission. At 6.40 pm the Squadron took off. Twelve aircraft, a mixture of Hurricanes and Spitfires joined the flight of Blenheim MK. 5. Bombers and crossed the English Channel. Their mission was to bomb a chemical factory outside Bethune.\n\nThe major remaining German fighter groups in France, JG26 and JG2, only intercepted when conditions were in their favor. 15 miles out from Bethune, the RAF mission was unexpectedly attacked by Messerschmitt 109’s in significant numbers. The formation was scattered in the ensuing melee. My father was flying a Hurricane.\n\nBoth Hurricane and Spitfire guns carried 14 seconds of ammunition, fired either in bursts or continuously. Pilots liked to leave a couple of bursts available in case of a dogfight on the way home. From my father’s brief account of the action, he he got behind an ME 109, and fired a short burst. He saw a stream of smoke as it banked away. At that moment, another ME. 109 raked his plane.\n\nSmoke was seeping into the cockpit. The Hurricane was not going to make it home. The engine was about to fail. He knew he had to bail out while he still had flight control. As the smoke thickened, he carried out the procedure he had learned for a clean exit, one that safeguarded against the slipstream slamming the pilot into the tail section. Let gravity do the work. He slid the cockpit canopy back, flipped the plane upside down, released the harness holding him into his seat, and dropped out into the sky. This digital simulation created by video gamers for a Utube demo captures such an adrenalin charged moment.\n\nHe pulled the ripcord, and the parachute opened about 2000 feet above the ground.As he steered the ‘chute towards a field, he saw it was surrounded by German troops. He landed without injury in the middle of the field near Montreuil Sur Mer. A German officer approached. He was greeted courteously. My father heard the actual words that would be immortalized in many WW2 movies – ” For you the war is over.”\n\nMy father never discussed how he felt at the moment of his capture. He must have felt gratitude at escaping almost certain death. The possibility of going home to his wife one day, when the odds of surviving years of missions was remote, mingled with disappointment that he could no longer use his accumulated expertise in pilot training to aid the war effort. He wished he’d had a better innings, to use a cricketing metaphor prevalent among the young pilots the RAF recruited extensively from British Public Schools, a culture my father had absorbed. My father had hoped for more time at bat, to put more runs on the board. His “probable” victory would never be recorded.\n\nHistorical records reveal that Fighter Command greatly exaggerated the success of its “Circus” missions. From June to the end of December 1941. It claimed 731 Luftwaffe aircraft were brought down, against a real Luftwaffe loss of 154 aircraft, 51 of which were not lost to RAF action. In fact, Fighter Command claimed 51 pilots were shot down by June 1941 but another 411 were lost by years’ end, a greater loss than July to October 1940. Defenders of home ground have the edge over attackers. This time the Germans had the advantage. In hindsight, the “Circus” operations had a deficit effect; the aircraft involved would have been better employed in the Middle and Far East. I doubt if my father gave much thought to the policy of which he was now a casualty awaiting transportation to prison camp. His focus was on survival and escape. If he saw any silver lining to his situation, it would have been that he was now automatically promoted to the next rank, Wing Commander. This ensured. at least, in the event of his death, his wife would receive an increased RAF widow’s pension.\n\nTHE ORANGE ENVELOPE\n\nThree planes from the squadron did not return from the mission, the names of the pilots recorded dispassionately in the daily log.\n\nBut the RAF was meticulous in their response to the bereaved or families of the missing, with an extensive bureaucracy to ensure next of kin were promptly informed and their needs met. Upon notification of a KIA or MIA or POW, an action checklist would swing into place requiring departmental countersignatures at each stage.\n\nThe War Office took the dependents of serving men seriously. Taking care of the women behind the men was important to maintaining the morale of the country., and you I’m going to show how the RAF handled the process in its communications with my mother. First 242 Squadron reported the “Missing” to the Air Ministry, with name and address of next of kin, with advice that she had not been informed. The Air Ministry would draft the telegram.\n\nAfter my father was posted to a base near the coast, my mother was living in a converted flat above the garage at Coverack, her parent’s house. In her memoir, she recalls the moment: “I was so lonely, and of course, lived in constant terror of what the future held. Six weeks later I was awake"
