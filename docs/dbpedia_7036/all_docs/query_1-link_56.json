        "text": "The relative peace enjoyed in Kwararafa, a village in Gassol local government area of Taraba state, is now being threatened as a result of renewed hostility between Tiv and Jukun in the central zone of the state at the weekend.\n\nOur correspondent reports that the crisis started due to change of a school’s name from Day Secondary School Dan-Anacha to Day Secondary School, Kwararafa by the government which did not go down well with the Tiv people residing in the area.\n\nIt could be recalled that the name, Dan-Anacha was formally and officially changed from Dan-Anacha to Kwararafa by the Ishaku’s administration in 2017, without any hue because members of the community beckoned him to change the school’s name to its initial name Kwararafa.\n\nIt was gathered that at least 16 houses were burnt down and four persons in the fracas.\n\nIn an interview with our correspondent, Mr. Likita Adashu, an elder statesman, said: “There is no big deal in the name change, we have more than five tribes’ coexisting in Kwararafa over many decades now, why should only the Tiv people be the ones to react or protest against the change of name of a place to its initial name which was nick-named? Historically, Kwararafa is said to be a Jukun traditional headquarters. It was a place where Jukun people settled and established their kingdom before reaching their final abode, Wukari, in the 18th Century.\n\n“The people, the name and the place was in existence even before any other tribe came to that place. While Dan-anacha on the other hand is said to be a name of a product, a yam variety called Anacha that is mostly found in that area. The town Kwararafa was nicknamed by the Hausa traders who came from far north to buy yam and other farm products in the area.\n\nThe town, Kwararafa, is not in any way a Tiv settlement, it is not even a word in Tiv language, neither the nickname given to it was done by a Tiv man but rather by Hausa traders, the market is said to have been formed as a result of the clashes that occurred among the Tivs themselves in Sabon-gida Takai in the year 1984 that led to many Tivs fled to Kwararafa and settled there where the market was established to ease commercial activities, what really baffles me is that, why did the government sent a circular that the Tiv people should live the town? Or what is their problem? Or is there no any other tribe in this area?\n\n“It appears there are some unscrupulous individual who are hell-bent on distracting Governor Ishaku with pockets of insecurity from one part of the state to other, I want to say without mincing word that there are entrepreneurs of insecurity who feed Fat on crisis like this, they are not happy with the relative peace being enjoyed in the state despite the effort of Ishaku towards the Tiv and Jukun crisis I wander why the Tiv people agreed to be used by these unscrupulous individuals,”.\n\nAlso speaking, James Tekinbi, faulted the governor for the name change, his words “I am saddened with the recent hostility in this area, we’ve been living peacefully not until when the governor sent a circular for the change of name for a school here from day secondary school Dan-Anacha to Kwararafa\n\nAsked if the name was changed recently or in 2017 and why did the Tiv not react that year when the name change took effect, he said: “When that one came, it came with consultation and persuasion, you know anything can trigger fight in this place, peace here is very fragile, I expected Ishaku to know that we just came out of crisis between Jukun and Tiv in the southern zone, and him being a Jukun man, Tiv people will see him as taking side with his kings men, apart from that, what stopped him from changing the sign post of schools, hospitals and all government property that time in 2017 that he changed the name immediately the time that there was no fight between the Tiv and the Jukun then, it’s now that he is doing it, that is his fault.”\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Ishaku has expressed disappointment over the recent hostility.\n\nHis senior special adviser on media and publicity, Bala Dan-Abu, conveyed this in a statement, saying: “The governor was not motivated by any guise to change the name of the school to Kwararafa as of then in 2017 until requested by members of the Dan-Anacha community. This informed why the development wasn’t accompanied by protest or allegation of any sort. The simple question we wish to ask here is, why wasn’t there a breakdown of law and order in that effect in 2017 until now?\n\n‘’If we couldn’t change the name of these Tiv villages in Taraba state, Dooshima in Ibi local government Area, Tor Musa and Jandekula in Wukari Ananu in Donga which are Tiv villages in the southern senatorial district.\n\nThen of what benefit will Ishaku led government gain from changing the name of Dan-Anacha without the collective request by members of the community? The governor acted in line with request, aspiration of the people of Kwararafa community’’\n\nIshaku further sued for peace and assured Tarabans that he would not jeopardize the peace his administration is working hard to sustain."
