        "text": "Jukun in English dictionary\n\nJukun\n\nSample sentences with \"Jukun\"\n\nDeclension Stem\n\nIt is debatable whether the Jukun were ever the military leaders of the broader Kwararafa state, as is sometimes claimed, or whether the Aku's role was more a symbolic or ritual leadership of the different peoples of the Benue river basin.\n\nThese similarities to Egyptian beliefs have led some anthropologists to speculate that the Jukun originally came from Sudan.\n\nThere were clashes in 1990 and 1991 related to whether Wukari should become part of Tiv-dominated Benue State or Jukun-majority Taraba State.\n\nMeek noted that the majority of the Jukun lived in scattered groups around the Benue basin, in an area that roughly corresponded to the extent of the kingdom of Kwararafa as it existed in the 18th century.\n\nThe Kuteb people, who speak a related language and live just to the south of the Jukun, have a tradition that they migrated from Egypt about a thousand years ago, but their religion is very different.\n\nTraditionally, Jukun society was governed by a monarchy.\n\nWhen the British incorporated the state into the protectorate of Nigeria around 1900, it was multi-ethnic, including Tiv and Moslem Hausa-Fulani people as well as the original Jukun.\n\nThis growing wave of poverty has resulted in ethno-religious conflicts between the Tiv and the Jukun and between the Fulani nomads and numerous communities in both Benue and Oyo States.\n\nThe Jukun accused the Tiv of the murder, and further violence broke out.\n\nIn June 1992, a Jukun member of the Taraba state assembly, the only woman, was assassinated.\n\nBy not taking any preventive action, the military powers have allowed a climate of latent ethnic conflict to evolve and one of these conflicts, in the East of the country, pitting the Tivs and the Jukuns against one another, has just led to the deaths of 200 civilians, who were massacred by soldiers.\n\nThe Jukuns are divided into two major groups; the Jukun Wanu and Jukun Wapa.\n\nWriting in the late 1920s, the British anthropologist C. K. Meek estimated that there were approximately 25,000 Jukun-speakers then alive.\n\nThe Jukun were established in Wukari as early as the 17th century.\n\nChildren of 15 to 18 years, according to reports, have been actively involved in the recurring conflicts of Ogoniland, Ife-Modakeke, Ijaw/Itsekiri-Urhobo, Jukun-Dutes, Aguleri-Umuleri and during the more recent communal clashes in Shagamu, Kano, Kaduna and Lagos.\n\n· having regard to efforts by civil society groups and, in particular, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) to broker peace between the warring Tiv and Jukun communities in Benue and Taraba States at a meeting scheduled for 15 November 2001,\n\nThe Jukun and Tiv disputes are about land and ancient rivalries, not about religion.\n\nMost of the tribes in the north central of Nigeria trace their origin to the Jukun people and are related in one way or the other to the Jukuns.\n\nThe Wukari Federation is a traditional state in Nigeria, a successor to the Kwararafa state of the Jukun people.\n\nFor decades there have been intermittent skirmishes between the Woɗaaɓe Bororo (graziers) and sedentary farmers such as the Jukun, Tiv, Chamba, Bamileke, and sometimes even the Hausa.\n\nThe Jukun Wanu are fishermen residing along the banks of the river Benue and Niger where they run through Taraba state, Benue state and Nasarawa state.\n\nDu Chaillu, Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa, London, 1 861, pp. 1 8-20. 413ff The King of Jukun.\n\nThe Wukari Federation, headed by the Aku Uka of Wukari, is now the main center of the Jukun people.\n\nAvailable translations\n\nFrench\n\nAuthors"
