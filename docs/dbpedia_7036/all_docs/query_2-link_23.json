        "text": "The historiography of Hausaland has laboured under a strong tradition of orthodoxy which recent secondary works have inherited from the more-or-less primary oral-cum-written sources. General cultural evidence (linguistic, ethnographic and archaeological) has been regarded as subsidiary, so that its potential for reconceptualization and for critical reevaluation of the conventional sources and orthodox interpretations has been missed. Instead, antiquarian approaches have been encouraged. Thus the view has persisted that Hausa as a cultural and linguistic entity has an antiquity running to several millennia, and also that it originated in the Sahara or around Aïr, whence it was pushed southward by desiccation or by Tuareg nomads. Contrarily, the clear message of linguistic geography and of Hausa's place within the Chadic family is that Hausa. expanded from east to west across the savanna belt of northern Nigeria. And the relative homogeneity of the language and culture within this vast zone indicates that the spread is quite recent (within the present millennium, say). It would have involved some assimilation, of previously settled peoples of the northern Nigerian plains, most of whom wouldl have spoken languages of the ‘Plateau’ division of Greenberg's Benue–Congo subfamily, of Niger-Congo.\n\nThis Hausaization, as it proceeded from its old bases in eastern Hausaland, would have been both a cultural and an ecological process, through which woodland would have been converted into more open and continuous savanna to support grain-cultivation and a denser peasant population. This process would have reached western Hausaland (Zamfara and Kebbi) around the middle of this millennium. Cattle – and Fulani herdsmen – would in time have played an important role in this cultural ecology (and in restricting the tsetse zones).\n\nThe old theory of a northern origin for the Hausa is bound up with the problem of Gobir in north-western Hausaland. Gobir's claim to be one of the original seven kingdoms (Hausa bakwai) is probably a late invention. Moreover, the common assumption that Gobirawa Hausa migrated from Aïr seems to derive from a misinterpretation of the written sources.\n\nFinally the bakwai legends are reconsidered. Despite the scepticism of some modern critics, the legends appear to reflect, albeit in idealized form, a real historical development. They represent a foundation charter for the Hausa as a multi-state ethnicity, and enshrine the vague memory of how Hausaland and ‘Hausaness’ began from a series of small centres and hill-bases on its eastern side. Thus the interesting argument of Abdullahi Smith, that the Hausa people emerged long before state systems arose among them, is disputed. Rather, these should be seen as two facets of a single process during the present millennium.\n\n1 This critical attitude need not deny the historical value of an interpretative approach to these traditions, myths, tales and their variants. Some variants are noted and discussed by Hallam, W. K. R. in J. Afr. Hist., vii (1966), 47–60CrossRefGoogle Scholar. His suggestion that the Bayajida legend may be fitted into a series of events which occurred both north and south of the Sahara in the tenth century A.D. is surely an attempt to be too specific. Standard secondary accounts incorporating these traditions can be found in Hogben, S. J. and Kirk-Greene, A. H. M., The Emirates of Northern Nigeria (London, 1966)Google Scholar; Crowder, M., The Story of Nigeria (London, 1962)Google Scholar; Fage, J. D., A History of West Africa (4th ed., London, 1969)Google Scholar; Trimingham, J. S., A History of Islam in West Africa (London, 1962), esp. 126 fGoogle Scholar. My own acquaintance with the primary written sources is through summaries, paraphrases and translations, which, I am warned, are frequently faulty. There is also – or has been — a considerable body of rural oral tradition in the various regions of Hausaland, much of it apparently contrasting in tone if not in detail too with the more official royal and town histories. Such local traditions are alluded to in some of the secondary literature but rarely presented in detail.\n\n9 Greenberg, J. H., ‘Linguistic evidence for the influence of Kanuri on the Hausa’, J. Afr. Hist., i (1960), 205–12CrossRefGoogle Scholar. As Greenberg hints (205–6), it would have been from this side (Bornu, that is) that the main popular Islamic impact was made upon Hausaland and its towns over time. This is not to dispute necessarily the information in the Kano Chronicle (which continues to impress itself on the general histories) that Islam was ‘introduced’ to Hausaland from Mali (Wangara) in the fourteenth century – and strengthened a century later by the arrival of Fulani mallams and a bigger selection of Muslim literature from the same direction. (For a critical discussion of the chronicle references, see Abdullahi Smith in Ajayi and Crowder, I (2nd ed.), 191; and Fisher, in Cambridge History of Africa, iii, 295–6Google Scholar; as well as Hiskett, M., ‘The historical background to the naturalization of Arabic loan-words in Hausa’, Afr. Lang. Studies, vi (1965), 18–26.Google Scholar) It would indeed be surprising if during and after the heyday of the Mali empire (and again around 1500 when Songhai power pressed strongly against Hausaland) the influence of the schools of the Upper Niger had not been felt. And to suggest that the received view is the result of nineteenth-century Fulani propaganda, emphasizing a western origin for Islam against a Bornuan one, would probably be too facile! Nevertheless, this issue illustrates the fragility of isolated literary references unless the available cultural and linguistic controls are applied – as well as the naivety of the notion that Islam simply ‘arrived’ from a particular direction at a particular time. See also Hiskett, , ‘Song of Bagauda’ (loc. cit., 1965), 369, 382–5Google Scholar, on gradual Islamization; and Lovejoy, ‘Role of the Wangara’, for a recent discussion of this issue.\n\n40 The opening section of Alkali, M. Bello, A Hausa Community in Crisis: Kebbi in the Nineteenth Century (M.A. thesis, Ahmadu Bello University, 1969Google Scholar) is useful here: see esp. pp. 26–9, 44–7, on the riverain Sorko, who were originally Songhaic-speaking but in time assimilated into western Hausa society. (See also my paper ‘The aquatic factor in northern Nigerian history’ to the seminar, Kano on ‘The Economic History of the Savanna’ in 1976Google Scholar: publication expected.) Songhai speech may have been given a boost in this region during the ascendancy of the Songhai empire and the status of Kebbi as its south-eastern province at the turn of the sixteenth century. But Bello Alkali's assumption that the rural population of Kebbi was basically Hausa before this period seems to me unsupported. It may be inspired by the Kebbi claim to be the ‘Original Hausa-speaking people’: O. and Temple, C. L., Notes on the Tribes … of Northern Nigeria (2nd ed., 1922), 404 nGoogle Scholar. Apparently certain traditions of the old Kebbi kingdom – including this claim of Hausa originality – have been maintained by the small new Kebbi kingdom (the Argungu emirate) which managed to preserve an independence of sorts from Sokoto and Gwandu in the nineteenth century.\n\n76 Rano has, it is true, a fairly complex wall system. But much of this may date only to the nineteenth century. It has moreover been noted for its industries, especially cloth manufacture. Yet several other small towns of this south Kano region were also important for cotton-production, weaving and indigo-dyeing. The fame of Rano itself for this may have been exaggerated academically for the simple reason that every one of the bakwai needed to be noted for something – Zazzau for extent of territory, Kano for wealth, Daura for seniority, Gobir for war, etc. Abd al-Qadir in the early nineteenth century had nothing to tell his readers about Rano (or ‘ Naru’) save to explain that it was not far from Zaria and close to Kano, as though they were unlikely to know where it was (Palmer, ‘Western Sudan history’, 266). On Bello's map (Denham and Clapperton, ii, facing p. 109) there is some confusion: ‘Na-roo’ is placed as in Abd al-Qadir, whereas ‘Ranoo’ is marked between Agades and Gobir! In 1850 Barth observed that Rano, was ‘not mentioned hitherto by any traveller’ (Travels, ii, 73)Google Scholar. The distinction between the powerful Hausa states and the obscure traditional sites had occurred much earlier, apparently by mid-millennium. This is the implication of Leo's account of the region between Songhai and Bornu where he includes seven kingdoms – Gobir, Agades, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, Zamfara and Guangara (Épaulard, , Description, 10, 16, 472 f.Google Scholar), noting how one language was known in five of them (that is, all but Agades, clearly not Hausa, and Zamfara, perhaps excluded through oversight or ignorance). Leo's silence on Daura, Rano and Garun Gabas is doubtless significant. The same inclusions and omissions are found in d'Anania (see previous note). But he also notes Kebbi (p. 342), though somewhat out of place, whose independent rise occurred just too late for Leo's notice (pace Lovejoy's speculation: note 16, above). Interestingly d'Anania mentions also two places in the Hausa—Bornu borderland: Shira and, further north, Tsotsebaki (p. 334).\n\n81 The sources for this exploratory discussion of the Middle Belt are mostly secondary and cited above: see especially notes 1 and 3; and Abdullahi Smith in Mortimore, Zaria and its Region; and for ‘South Zaria’ and Smith, Abuja M. G., Government in Zazzau (London, 1960Google Scholar). On Kwararafa and the question of its relationships, Meek, C. K., A Sudanese Kingdom (London, 1931), 25 f.Google Scholar, and Low, V. N., Three Nigerian Emirates (Northwestern U.P., 1972), 81–6Google Scholar, contain helpful suggestions. I have also benefited from informal discussions and unpublished seminar papers at Ahmadu Bello University. Some broader cultural considerations are implicit in Rubin, A., ‘Bronzes of the middle Benu’, W. Afr. J. Archaeol., iii (1973), 221–31Google Scholar. A case could be made for a greater degree of cultural continuity through the Benue region before the Tiv expansion which has separated the Doma zone from that of Jukun/Kwararafa. On Doma, and information on it reaching the Mediterranean between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, see Person, Y., ‘Dauma et Danhomé’ J. Afr. Hist., xv (1974), 547–61CrossRefGoogle Scholar. One is tempted to speculate on its position in the trade with the south and possibly in tin. Whether or not one presses the Jukun connexion of Kwararafa, I am assuming that records of attacks on Kano and even Katsina occurring as early as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are either anachronisms or relate to some different peoples and events, possibly particularist rural movements within Hausaland.\n\nHausa external trade and cultural influences are treated by Adamu, Mahdi, ‘Spread of Hausa culture’; and Lovejoy, P. E. in J. Hist. Soc. Nigeria, v (1971), 537–47Google Scholar. See the latter's further articles, ‘The Kambarin Beriberi’, J. Afr. Hist., xiv (1973), 633–51Google Scholar; and ‘Inter-regional monetary flows’, J Afr. Hist., xv (1974), 568–85Google Scholar, dealing mainly with the nineteenth century."
