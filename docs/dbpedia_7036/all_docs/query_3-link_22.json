        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nThe history of migration and settlement of most ethnic groups in Nigeria, have generated bond of contention among scholars because of variation in the history. The Kuteb people also have different version of stories regarding their origin and migration to their present location. This project work is aimed at questioning the truth and fallacy behind the various migratory stories seen in the work of scholars who have written about the Kuteb people. To be included in this work is the mode of relationship that existed between the kuteb people and her neighbours. In this research, the traditional belief system of the Kuteb people from time immemorial or earliest period will also be put in to consideration. In the course of this work, research reveals that the Kuteb people were one of the major players who took active part in the development and establishment of the Kororofa (Kwararafa) kingdom. The name Kororofa is derived from the Kuteb word ‘korofafae’ meaning ‘come closer in your number’. This word was used during the wars of expansion of the kingdom. There are many historical approaches and methods of writing research in history such as the comparative, analytical, descriptive and narrative methods. The researcher in the course of this research employed the narrative and analytical historical methods. Oral sources and written documents were consulted for collection of data as they are found to be relevant in this research."
