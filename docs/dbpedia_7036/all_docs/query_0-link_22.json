        "text": "The emergence of first generation states is among anthropology’s most enduring points of research. Such a state emerged around A.D. 500 in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, at Tiwanaku. This state shares many characteristics with other early states, but the process of its formation was distinct. Traditional state origins models do not adequately explain the preceding centuries, when there was an unprecedented historical rupture in social organization. This dissertation follows a perspective of emergent practice, which locates the cause and production of social change in practices, traditions, and interactions, from which social groups and institutions emerge. This perspective outlines general processes of social change, while detailed genealogies of practices are necessary to document specific historical trajectories. During the Late Formative, the southern Lake Titicaca Basin was dotted with ceremonial centers with earthen mounds, sunken temples, carved monoliths, and residences. These centers and their communities were larger and qualitatively different than anything prior, but little is known about their builders, residents, and visitors. Residents’ domestic practices at Khonkho Wankane and Kk’araña, Tiwanaku provide data on the social groups that formed the communities at each site. Residents shared many cultural practices and traditions. Walled compounds were home to large, powerful social groups. There is little evidence of status differences, trade specialization, or competition. The fundamental process to increasing complexity was organizing gatherings and work-parties, which framed dense networks of interactions. Residents hosted events in walled, outdoor spaces, and served food or drink in red-rimmed Kalasasaya small jars and bowls. The populations of these ceremonial centers was relatively low, and temporary visitors were recruited, generating labor forces that built many large construction projects. Interactions at these centers generated large communities focused at ceremonial centers, and were central to the emergence of the state at Tiwanaku. Despite this radical change in social organization, many domestic practices and traditions first established during the Late Formative would be continually reproduced for hundreds of years.\"\n\nThis paper assessed the pre-colonial cultural and economic setting of the Kuteb people of Takum and Ussa Local Government area of Taraba State. The study revealed that the social structures that existed in Kutebland were family or household groupings, clan or lineage groupings and village communities. However, the basic social unit is the lineage system. Marriages and their types are well regulated by the lineage system. The lineage system also provided a framework for kinship, collective differentiation and structural segmentation of societies. A lineage group in Kuteb land is an association of members who believe themselves to be related by descent from a common ancestor. Genealogical relationship and the legend of a founding ancestor provided the philosophical basis of unity in a clan or lineage system. Stories of heroes and their great exploits add pride and prestige to the members of a lineage or a clan. A household is part of a lineage or clan system which may consist of children, parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters and other immediate relatives. Kinship is a category of relationship which exists between two individuals or a group of individuals in a family or household with a common genealogy or lineage. The study concluded that the economy and society of Kuteb people was developed before British colonization. Kuteb societies were not static but changing, which is contrary to colonial description of African societies."
