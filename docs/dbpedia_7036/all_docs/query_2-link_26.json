        "text": "üá≥üá¨ Thrilled that our Kwararafa Coffee has reached China thanks to our amazing customer Dr. Dahiru Bala! ‚òïÔ∏è üá®üá≥ We're passionate about bringing the best of Nigerian coffee to the world, one cup at a time. Our journey hasn't been easy, but seeing our coffee enjoyed globally makes it all worthwhile. Stay tuned for a sneak peek of where our coffee has travelled next! #NigerianCoffee #GlobalAmbition #EntrepreneurLife __ Nothing gives me so much joy as when our customers and friends take our products to far-off places in the world, places neither we nor Nigerian coffee has reached before. Our friend, Dr. Dahiru Bala, was recently in China and not only did he take his Kwararafa Coffee along, but he also wore his Tigray Coffee Co. tee-shirt, shared our coffee with his business friends, and even took it to a cafe in Xiaobei, Guangzhou, China üá®üá≥. Being a coffee entrepreneur in Nigeria, in a segment of Food and Beverage that has simply not seen the sort of investment it deserves, can be daunting. Whenever invoices for equipment we've ordered arrive, or when we are running low on coffee beans. The logistic challenges of getting our 100% Nigerian arabica from atop the Mambila plateau to our premises in Abuja are sometimes exacerbated by the rains, or, in one case, a fatal accident along the Numan‚ÄîKaltungo road. But I remain determined to play my part in mainstreaming Nigerian coffee locally, continentally, and globally. I‚Äôll share a slide of the many places our coffee has been to soon‚Äîall continents except Australia really. On this journey, I am ever appreciative to my key officers, Charles Efiong, Muhammad Isa Dikko, and Janice Malachi; as well as to my Board, including Brig Gen Saleh Bala (Rtd), Dr. Jekwu Ozoemene, Edidiong Akan, Ignatius Onwusorom, and Suleiman Usman Yusuf. And, of course, to customer-turned-friends like Dr. Dahiru Bala and the many others who put out a word for us in rooms we were not in. Lastly, our bankers, Sterling Bank, and its dynamic CEO, Abubakar Suleiman. E ku se! - Richard Ali, CEO.\n\n‚òïÔ∏è Two years ago, when our Tigray Coffee Co. x Rovingheights caf√© opened in Garki, Abuja, we embarked on a mission to share and celebrate the rich flavors of Nigerian coffee while honoring our country's profound intellectual heritage. One of the most cherished features of our caf√© is The Soyinka Wall, a tribute to Wole Soyinka, one of Nigeria's most distinguished intellectuals and Nobel laureate. This wall not only enhances the ambiance of our caf√© but also serves as a constant reminder of the immense contributions of Wole Soyinka to literature, culture, and society. Today, as we celebrate #SoyinkaAt90, we take a moment to reflect on the legacy of this extraordinary individual. Wole Soyinka has inspired generations with his words, thoughts, and unwavering commitment to justice and human rights. His work transcends borders and continues to resonate with people worldwide. At our caf√©, we believe in the power of coffee to bring people together and spark meaningful conversations. What better way to honor Wole Soyinka than to enjoy a cup of our 100% Nigerian Arabica coffee in a space dedicated to his memory? Join us in raising our mugs to Wole Soyinka, the finest of us all. We espresso our deepest homage to the Captain of Nigeria's intellectual tradition! #CoffeeCulture #NigerianCoffee #IntellectualHeritage #WoleSoyinka #WoleSoyinkaAt90 #TigrayCoffee #RovingHeights"
