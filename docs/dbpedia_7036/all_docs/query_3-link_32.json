        "text": "Ancient African civilizations span the course of several millennia, in time, and a large expanse of lands stretching from the Nile Valley a c ross the cursed Sahara to the forest states of West Africa, in space. Many states and kingdoms lived and thrived centuries ago in these re g i o n s . Most of them have now been packaged into intellectual memory banks that historians and their ever- p robing kindred colleagues in learned literary studies love to mine. Egypt, Kush, Nubia, Ghana, Songhai, and dozens m o re ancient civilizations that are claimed for Africa have been re s p e c t f u l l y t reated by African historians and literati. Many of these past states and civilizations died away before Euro p e a n incursions into Africa introduced new dynamics in the continent’s public a ffairs. Their histories live in blessed memory and are generally safe fro m attacks by either European managers of the images of Africa or by modern African historians and literary men and women. Who wants to besmirc h E g y p t ’s reputation for its atrocities in Kushland? Many African intellectuals would prefer that we allow the holy pharaohs, who have brought so much pride to us in Africa, to rest in peace. Ancient Ghana’s glory and veritable h i s t o ry of conquests of ethnic neighbors have been appropriated by nationalist Kwame Nkrumah for his country whose profane colonial designation of Gold Coast he changed to the famed and exalted name of Ghana in 1 9 5 7 — p e rhaps the greatest gift this anti-imperialist campaigner made to his native land. Walter Rodney, the formidable Caribbean scholar of African affairs, was bemused by the practices of African intellectuals who rush to invoke the heritage of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai in their search for the validation of claims that Africa too was well developed before the tro ublesome Europeans arrived in our lands. 1 In this wonderful show of good grace and good manners to kingdoms that are no more, such acts as King Mansa Musa of Mali’s reckless endangerment of his country in his cart i n g away so much wealth to Arab lands in his year long pilgrimage to Mecca in the fourteenth century are forgiven or even glorified. 2 Such robust respect for dead ancient African civilizations contrasts sharply with the searching attitudes and attention by African historians and the literati towards those of Africa’s indigenous states and civilizations that s u rvived into the European era of dominance and into our own times.\n\nThis thesis is concerned with the social and economic history of the communities of the Akwanga division of Plateau province in central Nigeria from the beginning of formal British administration in 1911 to the end of colonial rule in 1960. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first looks at the early history of the peoples of Akwanga with emphasis on their political, religious and economic organisation. It also discusses the effect of the nineteenth-century Sokoto jihad on settlement patterns in the region. Chapter 2 deals with resistance to the colonial conquest, which lasted up to 1925. Chapter 3 discusses the development of the indirect rule system and native administration, focusing on the creation of chiefs, divisional boundaries and the native administrative policies pursued by successive Governors of Nigeria. Chapter 4 looks at taxation and cash crop production and their impact on the peoples of Akwanga. Chapter 5 examines the use of local labour for building the i...\n\nTraditional rulers in Yoruba society have over the years played significant roles in the social, political and economic development of the traditional society. What constitutes the major roles of traditional rulers as they affect the society generally have been discussed by various scholars. However, there was little or no attention on the dwindling in status of traditional rulers in the modern society due to modernity and civilization which has relegated them. This has over the years rendered them and the institution almost irrelevant and mere figureheads. It has also contributed in no small measure to the security threat, unbridled recklessness and instability in the nation. The paper therefore examines the change in status and prestige of traditional rulers in the pre-and post-colonial periods in Yorubaland and how their status could be re-invigorated and re-energized to play a complementary role in addressing various problems facing the nation today.\n\nThis research examines the Pre-colonial history of the ancient town of Owo in an effort to further debunk the claim by G.W.F Hegal and many other European scholars that Africa had no Political structure, religion and history before the colonial period. It is believed by many Europeans that colonialism brought political, economic and social organization and civilization to Africa. This research argues that Africa had an existing and well functioning structure even before the advent of colonial rule and African contact with Europeans by examining an ancient civilization in the Yoruba ethic group of Nigeria, 'Owo'. The Owo Kingdom is an ancient kingdom in southwestern Nigeria, and is regarded as one of the pillars of the Yoruba empire housing one of the National Archives in the country, and home to the largest palace in the whole of West Africa. The kingdom of Owo is one of the few ancient towns in Nigeria to have survived the influence of colonialism on her religious and cultural practices due to her strong established and organized structure. This research will scrutinize the story of origin of the Owo Kingdoms, the economic structure of Owo kingdom before colonization, and her socio-political structure before colonization.\n\nThe chapter provides an anthropological analysis of the sociopolitical system of the Benin Kingdom (in contemporary Southwestern Nigeria) from coming to power of the Second (Oba) Dynasty presumably in the mid-13th century till the British conquest in 1897. The course of formation of this system of institutions and its basic characteristic features are outlined. It is argued that the Benin Kingdom of the 13th–19th centuries was a supercomplex system of institutions (society) but not a state, as it was not based on suprakin (territorial) social ties and there was no professional (bureaucratic) administration in it. The kin-based extended family community always remained this society’s focus, and supracommunal institutions were built up by its template, what is impossible in a state. So, being no less complex and developed than many so-called early states (Claessen and Skalník 1978) or archaic states (Feinman and Marcus 1998), Benin was not a state but rather a specific alternative to the state. This form of sociopolitical organization can be called “megacommunity” and depicted as four concentric circles of institutions forming an upset cone: the extended family, the community, the chiefdom and finally the kingdom.\n\nThe dwindling status of traditional rulers in Nigeria and other parts of Africa started with the colonization proceSs. Indeed it was part of the strategy of colonial occupation in the African territories and there was no other way to manage the process originally when the British came to Africa. A brief study of the question would reveal the historical and scriptural patterns that laid the foundation of the political models that eventually saw to the dimension and trends as witnessed in modern times. This purely a teaching presentation and not a well researched academic paper that can be used ordinarily to discuss the issues. However it is relevant to the study in order to convey the basic knowledge of the issues under discussion to a learner."
