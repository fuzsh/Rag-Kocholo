        "text": "The Berom name of African people of central Nigeria. They are predominantly farmers and hunters, culturally rich with the population of about 2.5 million people scattered across the globe. The Berom constitute the largest of the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau taking almost 47 percentage of the state population covering about four local government areas such as Jos North, Jos South, Barkin Ladi (Gwol) and Riyom local government area and some in southern Kaduna province. Berom are historically the largest, ethnic group in the former jos province which was created out of Bauchi province in 1927. The pre –historic and the historic period of the Berom people as the early settlers on the Jos has been clearly explained by renowned archeologists and scholars such as Thurstan Shaw, R.C. Soper, Benard Fagg and some renowned Nigerian historians, Sa’adu Abubakar and M.Y Manvwat who linked their existence to the Nok civilization the oldest West-African civilization dated between 200BC to 1000AD, another evidence is the discovery of the artifacts of the Acheulian era, that clearly shows that the Berom people are linked with the pre-historic inhabitant of the Nok culture complex. The history of the Berom people cannot be completed without establishing facts on their migration into Jos, which a renowned Nigerian historian M.Y. Manvwat states the phases of migration of different ethnics into plateau as fallows.\n\n“The peopling and the formation of groups on the Jos plateau area can be traced to several phases. The first phase, C 200BC to 1000AD was the pre-historic period. The second was C. 1100 to C. 1700AD was occasioned most largely by developments in the Kanem-Bornu region particularly following the establishments of the second Kanuri empire which occasioned the migration of groups of people who refused to be incorporated into the new Kanem policy to the Jos Plateau. The third C. 1600 to C. 1800AD was associated with the Jukun Kwararafa activities. The forth phase C. 1800 to 1907AD was related to Fulani herders, and Hausa traders cumulated in the Sokoto jihad” (PIDAN. 2010).\n\nDr. S.D. Nyam recorded two major accounts of the origin of the History of the Berom, which are the Kabong and the Riyom origin of migration, both ethno-graphic, linguistic and archaeological have proven with facts that the Berom were part of Bantu migration that originated from central Africa. Though their journey began from central Africa, many historians traced the journey from Ethiopia to Sudan to Chad republic then from Chad republic to Niger and settled in Gobir the boundary between Sokoto and Niger republic, the facts of their settlement in those places is always told in Berom folk tales as “ wot yin Bayer ku wot vok Babi yin Babi ku wot vok Baba” that is, we came from Niger (Bayer) to Bira Sokoto (Babi) to Riyom (Baba). The name Berom was carved out of the name of a place in sokoto call Bira, which was the settlement of the Berom people before moving to Kabong and Riyom. Most of the Berom people came from Shonong to Riyom in big wave of migration and settled in Riyom, Vwang, Forom, Zawan, Kuru, Gyel, Heipan, Fan and Gashish while the minority that settled in Kabong are Du part of Forom and some other few in Vwang. The Berom were the first to settle not only in Jos and environs but on the Jos Plateau these are some facts that were clearly revealed by a renowned Nigerian Historian, Sa’ad Abbubakar {1980: pp. 166-167} said this.\n\n“undoubtedly some of the ethnic groups in the Benue basin and Bauchi plateau migrated from the north. However, this does not mean that there had been no autochthons but only empty land into which the various immigration move…\n\nTHE FESTIVALS IN BEROM LAND\n\nSome major festival in Berom land from pre-colonial to colonial era are as follows,\n\n1\n\nS/N Name of festival\n\nperiod\n\nTime of celebration\n\n1 Mandyeng\n\n2 Nshok\n\n3 Badu\n\n4 Worongchun\n\n5 Vwana/Bwana\n\n6 Mado hunting festival\n\n7 Behwol hunting festival\n\n8 Nzemberom\n\n9 Wusal berom\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPre-colonial\n\nPost colonial\n\nPost colonial\n\nMarch/ April\n\nMarch/ April\n\nMarch/ April\n\nApril/May\n\nAugust\n\nOctober/November\n\nFebruary/March\n\nMarch/April\n\nNovember\n\nThe major aims of celebrating festivals in Berom land is for agriculture and hunting theses are the two paramount events worth celebrating.\n\nMandyeng is a major festival celebrated in Berom land to usher in the rainy season.
