        "text": "Manu Ishaku Ada Ali has been crowned Aku-Uka of Wukari in the Kwararafa Kingdom of Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nHis installation came barely three months after the demise of the chairman, Taraba Council of Chiefs, Dr Shekarau Angyu Masa-Ibi Kuvyu II.\n\nThe new Aku, who is the son of the 23rd Aku-Uka, Ada Ali Agbumanu, who reigned from 1974-1976, hails from the Bama Ruling House.\n\nHis coronation, which took place on Friday in Wukari council, brought together the Jukun race from far and near as well as dignitaries from the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\nThe new monarch, who is the 25th Aku-Uka of Kwararafa kingdom, was installed by the Kunvyi of Wukari, Manu Irimiya .D. Agbu, who said the monarch emerged following his selection by the four kingmakers guided by the Supreme Oracle.\n\nElated by the development, the newly installed monarch urged his subjects to throw their weights behind him to succeed in presiding over the affairs of the kingdom.\n\nHe urged those who contested for the stool along with him to join hands with him to make the kingdom a better place, vowing to carry everyone along.\n\nEarlier, the state Governor, Arc. Darius Dickson Ishaku, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Haruna Istifanus Gbana, admonished the new Aku to endeavour to work round the clock to herald the much-needed peace and unity in Jukun land.\n\nDistancing government from the selection process, he said the exercise was purely traditional.\n\nBorn on 24th March 1946, the new Aku holds Higher National Diploma (HND) in Forestry from the premier Federal College of Forestry Jos, Plateau State.\n\nHe joined the civil service in 1965 and retired in the year 2000 as Chief Forestry Superintendent after 35 years of meritorious service."
