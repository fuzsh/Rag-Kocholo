        "text": "SYNOPSIS: Flurries of literature have established direct line of consanguinity between the Iwhnuruọhna nation, and the Bini-dynasty. Recent literatures yet suggest otherwise- claiming an equally high ancestry to the Igbo clan. An historical study of the Igbo group involved in the re-invention and desecration of the Iwhnuruọhna ancestry suggests however that such notions- as defeasible or repealable mecha-nisms- were born out of a desire to deliberately control the physical conglomeration of the Ikwerre nation, and strain the meritorious socio-economic and political hygiene of the masses. As proponents of the Iwhnuruọhna nationality seek to firmly establish and assert their rights of territorial sovereignty within Nigeria and beyond, conflicting priorities continue to abound. In expounding on the con-ception of the Iwhnuruọhna nationality as a “sub-group” of the Igbo clan, two questions were established: What might be the motive behind the strong allegiance in the claim of lineal kinship of the Iwhnuruọhna people to the Igbo ancestry? And how might the Ikwerre ancestry be reinterpreted in order to be a useful starting point for asserting their distinctiveness and territorial sovereignty, specifically in relation to its ancestral ties? Drawing heavily upon empirical, anecdotal and practitioner-based knowledge, this paper explores a provocative but as of yet relatively studied facet of the Iwhnuruọhna genealogy, to unveil the concrete records of the cul-tural ingredients latent in the girth of history. The empirical and anecdotal evidence proposed is elicited from an historical analysis and cross-disciplinary interviews used to gather together the range of research data. It argues that the continued conception of the Iwhnuruọhna nationality as a “sub-group” of the Igbo clan is far-fetched, and that such claim only perpetuates the need for assump-tions and generalisations about the true ancestry of the Iwhnuruọhna people. It posits that the history of a political agenda begins with the assumption that kinship in blood is the sole possible ground of a people’s right to political functions, and rightly so citizens who consider themselves to be part of a group claim membership to be founded on common lineage solely for political reasons. It propos-es that perhaps Iwhnuruọhna’s pledge of allegiance to the Bini ancestry on the grounds of consanguinity rather than their Igbo com-peer places the Igbo people in a disadvantaged position, hence threatens their quest for material, human and natural resource control within the Niger-Delta. It thus concludes that the claim of ties with the Igbo group is more or less a puff piece couched to exclude the qualitative aspects of the Ikwerre history, hence a ploy to subject the people of Iwhnuruọhna to a point of unquestioning obedience to their authorities, in order to advance their political agenda.

A deity whose powers were used to resist British invasion of Ikwo, became prominent following the outbreak of the Nigerian-Biafran war of 1967-1970 about a century ago when the people used the oracle as an instrument of protection. Within this period however, and when the Nigerian soldiers conquered the old Ogaja province and detonated bomb at \" Eke Igboji Market \" , there were several Ikwo people who ran into the Nte-Oswina's forest for protection hence, there were heavy smokes that appeared and covered the forest and began to hypnotize the soldiers until they were driven away by bees. Against this background, this paper seeks to unveil the mystic powers of this deity with the aim of finding out whether the failure to document the activities of Nte-Oswina especially in the area of conflict resolution by Igbo historiographers like other powerful deities such as \" Ibinukpabi \" and \" Igwekala \" whose records dominated African history was a deliberate attempt or lack of interest from Igbo historians. Data for this study were collected from both primary and secondary methods while data collected were analyzed through the application of historical narration. Preliminary investigation revealed that the unpopularity of this powerful long \" juju \" wasn't deliberate but rather, lack of interest particularly from the Ikwo people who refused to provide information to early historian that sought to reconstruct the history of the preliterate people like the Ikwo society.\n\nBased on linguistic classification, Kupto and Kwami are part of the Southern Bole-Tangale group of West Chadic. Geographically, however, they are separated from the other members of this group. While Kupto and Kwami are settled roughly to the north of Gombe town, the majority of peoples representing the Southern Bole-Tangale group live predominantly in and around the Muri Mountains to the south of Gombe State. An interesting question to ask in this context is: besides the linguistic relationship, are there also cultural continuities between those representatives of Bole-Tangale living in the south and the two off-shoots Kupto and Kwami in the north? In this paper I want to address – with reference to the Kupto and Kwami – the relationship between language, culture and ethnicity. In an earlier article (Adelberger 1995), I addressed this topic with reference to the bulk of groups representing the Southern Bole-Tangale language group, as well as other ethno-linguistic groups living in the Muri Mountains. In respect of their current culture, the Kwami and Kupto are hardly dis-tinguishable from the surrounding Bolewa, and have merged into the mainstream Islamic culture of Northern Nigeria, dominated by Hausa and urban Fulani.\n\nThis paper is a historical exposition of the Ijo people of Delta State in the South-South and Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria. A literature gap exists on these groups compared to their kith and kin in the States of Bayelsa and Rivers, also in the Niger-Delta. Thus, motivated by this, the author employs a descriptive and analytical schema to present the early history of these people with regards to their origins, migrations and settlement patterns. The study also examines aspects of their social and cultural practices. At the end, it is observed that, these groups, like their other Ijo counterparts in the central and eastern delta are equally of considerable antiquity in the Niger-Delta spanning over 7,000 years, blended with a rich heritage that has been developed over time.
