        "text": "The G20 Club which is made up of progressive elements from the southern part of the state, told Senate Committee on State Creation that the demand for the new state was informed by the historical background and the need for rapid development of the area and its people.\n\nThe Club’s Director of Publicity, Mr. Edward Jeremiah, said in a statement in Abuja that, “The desire for a new state of our own is informed by our historical background and the need for rapid development.\n\nIt maintained that, “Ancient Kwararafa Empire was in the same pedestal with Borno Empire and Sokoto Caliphate in the North; Oyo and Benin Empire in the South. They have all been accorded the status of two or more states except Kwararafa Empire which is still part of another state; we the peaceful people of the proposed Kwararafa State are asking for the restoration of our past status.”\n\nThe Club also noted that the earlier rejection of the proposal by their people to be included in the then proposed Katsina- Ala State in 1996 still stands."
