        "text": "Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has charged the new Aku Uka, His Royal Highness Manu Ishaku Adda Ali Matakhitsewen to govern his people with the fear of God and work hard to ensure that all forms of crimes and threat to security are eliminated.\n\nGovernor Lalong was speaking at the installation and presentation of staff of office to the Aku Uka by Taraba State Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku in Wukari.\n\nLalong said the installation is a unique moment that will linger in the minds of the people because the last time this type of event took place was in 1976 when the late monarch was crowned.\n\nHe congratulated His Royal Highness for ascending the throne of his fore fathers at this time when there is a greater need to foster development, peace and progress of the land and also commended the king-makers for conducting a selection process devoid of rancour and bitterness.\n\nHe said “being alive to witness this special event calls for thanksgiving to God and appreciation to the ancestors for giving us this rich and vibrant culture that we continue to uphold. I therefore bring you the goodwill and warm felicitations of the Government and people of Plateau State with whom Taraba State and indeed the Kwararafa Kingdom shares very close affinities”\n\nThe Governor said he was confident that the selection of the Aku Uka will usher in a period of greater prosperity within the Kingdom, Taraba State and Nigeria at large. He reminded him about the challenges that the nation faces particularly insecurity and crime which require the support of the traditional institution to be brought under control. He expressed hope that the Royal Father will do everything possible to ensure that he mobilises your subjects to rise against crime in whatever form.\n\n“Using your wealth of experience and the influence of your office, it will be very important for you to also work with the Government and non-governmental organisations towards ensuring that job opportunities are created particularly in entrepreneurship and agriculture that are synonymous with the Kwararafa Kingdom. We look forward to you leading your subjects towards reviving the spirit of hardwork, resilience and excellence that is known in Kwararafa Kingdom. Already, the Northern Governors Forum has submitted its proposal to the National Assembly to find a suitable role for the traditional institution in the Constitution. We desire to see our royal fathers play a greater role in governance as it used to be in the pre-colonial and colonial times so as to be able to confront the challenges we face today. I know his Royal Highness will continue to play the role that his predecessor played within the Northern Traditional Council and the nation at large” he said.\n\nTaraba State Governor Darius Ishaku while handing over the staff of office to the new Aku Uka said the ancient Kwararafa Kingdom still remains a reference point for civilization, arts, culture and innovation which still resonates with its sons and daughters all over the world.\n\nHe said the new monarch emerged through a free and fair process that was decided by the king makers without any interference from the Government.\n\nDarius charged the Royal Father to work assiduously in mobilising his subjects towards promoting development in education, agriculture, health and infrastructure, assuring him of the support of the Government.\n\nThe Taraba Governor used the occasion to warn traditional rulers against involvement in partisan politics and arbitrary sale of lands as well as allowing illegal mining in their domains.\n\nFormer Minister of Defence General T.Y. Danjuma said the event is a special moment for the people of the Kwararafa Kingdom who are known for hardwork, unity and pursuit of excellence.\n\nHe frowned against the level of insecurity in the country manifesting in kidnapping, banditry and terrorism which he said must be tackled immediately to save the nation.\n\nT.Y. Danjuma said the people must be involved in their protection and also work with the security agencies to confront criminals whose main aim is to destroy Nigeria.\n\nSultan of Sokoto Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar said that task before the new Aku Uka is enormous and calls for commitment that is built on vision, fairness and justice.\n\nHe advised his colleague never to allow politicians distract him from serving his people justly and honestly as doing anything contrary to his calling and the wishes of his ancestors will not bring progress to the land.\n\nThe Aku Uka in his remarks thanked the people for supporting him as he ascends the throne of his forefathers.\n\nWhile pledging to be a father to all, the royal father promised to work in the footsteps of his forefathers who toiled to built a kingdom that embraced diversity, peace, unity and progress.\n\nHe also promised thanked the guests who honored him and the people of the State for their show of love."
