It took off in March 2006 with 61 students as the first and only community-owned University in Nigeria, the first University in Taraba State and the second private University in the North East Geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Located at Wukari an ancient city that was for a while the headquarters of the historically famous Kwararafa Confederacy, the University officially changed its name from Wukari Jubilee to Kwararafa in Febuary 2012 to reflect the cultural and historical roots of the confederacy which at the zenith of its powers extended to modern Niger, Plateau, Kogi, Nasarawa and Benue states and FCT in the north central geo-political zone, Edo and Cross River in the South-south zone, Kogi Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina states in the north west zone and Bauchi, Gombe, and Adamawa States in the north east zone.

Research Focus/Linkages The University is presently developing linkage programs with other Institutions and Universities around the world. The focus of research is in the areas: Peace and Conflict Resolution Food Science and Technology Mathematics Education Heritage Studies and Eco-Tourism The research focus is derived from the unique location of the University in the Benue valley with an abundance of flora and fauna as well as the rich social-cultural traditions of the people of the area that could be of academic interest to researchers.
