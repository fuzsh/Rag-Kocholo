        "text": "Christian Cleric Rejects Ill-Intention Creation Of Nomad Vigilante Group, Calls For Creation Of Hostage Rescue Security Unit\n\nOkwuta Audu Jos\n\nThe president and Founder of Evangelical Bible Out Reach Ministry International ( EBOMI) and Convener Initiative for a Better and Brighter Nigeria IBBN Prophet El- Buba has rejected the lame, obnoxious, hypocritical and ill-intentioned purported creation of a nomad Vigilante group in Nassarawa state by Bello Bodejo’s Miyatti Allah Kautal Hore (MAKH).\n\nThe renowned Christian Cleric stated this while speaking to newsmen at EBOMI Prayer Headquarters in Jos on the state of the nation .\n\nEisaid more insulting to Nigerians’ psyche and the memory of thousands gruesomely murdered and displaced by suspected Fulani militias is the group purported joke to invite known terrorist, Turji and other Fulani militias’ leaders to work with the Vigilante group.\n\nAccording to him, the sheer hypocrisy is crystal clear in the inter-convertibility of how Miyatti Allah’s tribesmen in the mold of Fulani militias who have been terrorizing , killing and maiming Nigerians in most part of the country will now be the same people to quickly resort to creating a Nomad vigilante group.\n\n” For the avoidance of doubt , this is Greek gift to our security Architecture! And we are calling on relevant security authorities to rein in and clamp down on Miyatti Allah. This is sacrosanct to abort an underhanded and systematic plan to overrun especially the North Central Nigeria with and by Fulani militias’ group seeking to disguise as nomadic vigilante and consolidate Nassarawa state as a harbouring ground and operational foothold given the state boarders with Plateau, Benue,Kaduna and the FCT where there are prevailing security challenges.”\n\nHe added that a review of incidents reports from the past few days reveals that this deteriorating trend revealing five of the six geopolitical zones in the country to be currently under siege of kidnappers and bandits operating at will has becomes worrisome.\n\nThe Christian cleric further said there is the need to also create a somewhat Hostage Rescue Security Unit(s) comprising of all security formations who will be well armed to the teeth and trained in special weapons and tactics to directly confront bandits and seize victims from the den of kidnappers.\n\nAccording to him, our justice system in the country must be swift and firm ensuring that all criminals, bandits, kidnappers, terrorists, their collaborators, accomplices and or their sponsors docked, are prosecuted and meant to face the full wrath of the law no matter whose ox is gored."
