        "text": "The Nigerian Middle Belt is home to numerous ethnic groups, the most notable of which are the Nupe, Baruba, Idoma, Tiv, Ebira, Igala, Chamba, and Jukun. Of these groups, the most enigmatic is the Jukun, who have been associated with the establishment of the powerful but ephemeral state of Kwararafa. Kwararafa became famous in Nigerian history because, between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, it was a terror to the Hausa states and Borno. However, the identification of Jukun with Kwararafa has been questioned, largely because the term kwararafa means nothing to present-day Jukun, who have virtually no memories of their allegedly martial past. The weight of evidence seems to indicate that kwararafa was a generic term used by the Islamic peoples of the Central Sudan to refer to non-Muslim peoples from the south.\n\nToday, over a dozen ethnic groups, scattered over a wide area of northern and central Nigeria, claim ancestral linkages with the Kwararafa. This could mean that Kwararafa was a confederacy. At the core of this were the Hausa-speaking Kutumbawa-Abakwariga, as well as the Arago, Kalam, Gwana, Pindiga, Kona, Kundi, and Jukun. The location of the capital, like the membership of the confederacy, appeared to have oscillated with the vicissitudes of the confederacy and the location of the particular group or groups dominant in it. Organized for specific purposes such as defense and trade, the confederacy had no clearly defined frontier or permanent geographical location, established no lasting hegemony over the peoples they conquered, and disbanded once their specific aims had been achieved. They left behind no histories or chronicles. Therefore, much of what we know today about them comes from the records of their enemies. The reconstruction offered here is based on the creative use of other sources, such as the chronicles of successor states and peoples, and the historical analysis of spirit masquerades and shrines as well as of political and biological totems.\n\nPioneering studies by J. B. Webster (1976, 1993) and others show that four phases are discernible in Kwararafan history. The first began with its establishment, around the year 1000, at Santolo, on the southern bank of the Hadeija River, east of Lake Chad. By 1380, the center of the confederacy had moved to Tagara, north of the Gongola-Hawal confluence. Ruled by a Kutumbawa dynasty, Kwararafa rivaled and competed with the Hausa Habe states—especially Kano—for the control of Saharan trade. Commercial and religious antagonisms soon developed into confrontations. In these early encounters, the Habe states appeared to have had the upper hand. According to a Katsina account, Korau, the ruler of Katsina, waged a war against the Kwararafa in 1260. A century later, it was the turn of Kano, whose rulers Yaji (1349-1385), and Kanajegi (1390-1410) successfully compelled the Kwararafa to submit to an annual tributary payment that included, among other things, 200 slaves. Further, defeated in battle by Queen Amina of Zaria, the Kwararafa paid tribute to Zaria for most of the fifteenth century. Their devastating defeat by Bornu, between approximately 1462 and 1495, dramatically brought this first phase of Kwararafan history to a close. Thereafter, the capital shifted to Biepi, on the southern bank of the Benue River.\n\nIn the meantime, refugees fleeing from the forces of Islam in the northern states flooded the Kwararafa region, transforming the confederacy into a bastion of traditionalism. Active engagement in both Saharan and Atlantic commerce made this second phase, which ended with the ascension of King Kenjo in about 1610, one of prosperity. With their control of the salt supply of the Benue Valley, they traded this essential but scarce commodity for horses to build up their army, as well as for slaves in order to gain access to European commodities on the coast. Calabar, on the Atlantic coast, became known as the port of Kwararafa.\n\nIncreased wealth and a demographic upsurge permitted the establishment of a powerful cavalry army. This would, over the course of the next two centuries (c. 1610-1790), enable the Kwararafa to maintain its independence in addition to inflicting a series of spectacular defeats on the Hausa and Kanuri states and rivals to the north. Zaria was the first to be reduced to tributary status. Between 1582 and 1703, Kano came under repeated attacks, as its army watched helplessly while a new and reinvigorated Kwararafan army ravaged through the heart of the Hausa country. Katsina, situated farther to the north, did not escape the Kwararafan depredations. By 1680, Kwararafa was at the peak of its power when it once again swept through the Hausa country and its army reached the gate of Ngazargamu, the capital of the Borno empire, which it sacked, putting its ruler to death. Borno, however, soon rallied and the Kwararafan were repulsed.\n\nIt was during the final phase of this era of conquest that Kwararafan history began to merge into Jukun history. Now situated in the Benue Valley, Kwararafa began to experience waves of Jukun migrations, and the Jukun before long became the dominant group in the region. Internal dissension and unabated external attacks, combined with natural disasters such as drought, contributed to Kwararafa’s decline. The Chamba drove Adi Matswen, generally acknowledged as the last king of the Kwararafa, from his capital at Uka. He fled north across the Benue, establishing a new capital at Wuse.\n\nBy 1820, a Jukun dynasty based at Wukari, south of the Benue, had taken control of what was left of the Kwararafa state. With this transformation, the martial state of Kwararafa had finally come to an end. The Jukun inherited the political power of Kwararafa, but not its martial tradition. The far-flung confederacy had become the homogeneous Jukun kingdom of Wukari. Kwararafa under the Jukun ceased to be a warrior state; extant accounts portray the new state as a pacifist and religious one, made up of a collection of unwarlike people solely and strictly devoted to the maintenance of their innumerable religious cults and the veneration of their sacred kings, a people whose prestige and continuing legitimacy depended on their successful performance of their main ritual function, which was to guarantee good harvest and good health for the people.\n\nFunso Afolayan\n\nSee also: Hausa Polities: Origins, Rise; Kano; Niger Delta and Its Hinterland: History to Sixteenth Century; Niger Delta and Its Hinterland: Peoples and States to 1800.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFremantle, J.
