        "text": "🇳🇬 Thrilled that our Kwararafa Coffee has reached China thanks to our amazing customer Dr. Dahiru Bala! ☕️ 🇨🇳 We're passionate about bringing the best of Nigerian coffee to the world, one cup at a time. Our journey hasn't been easy, but seeing our coffee enjoyed globally makes it all worthwhile. Stay tuned for a sneak peek of where our coffee has travelled next! #NigerianCoffee #GlobalAmbition #EntrepreneurLife __ Nothing gives me so much joy as when our customers and friends take our products to far-off places in the world, places neither we nor Nigerian coffee has reached before. Our friend, Dr. Dahiru Bala, was recently in China and not only did he take his Kwararafa Coffee along, but he also wore his Tigray Coffee Co. tee-shirt, shared our coffee with his business friends, and even took it to a cafe in Xiaobei, Guangzhou, China 🇨🇳. Being a coffee entrepreneur in Nigeria, in a segment of Food and Beverage that has simply not seen the sort of investment it deserves, can be daunting. Whenever invoices for equipment we've ordered arrive, or when we are running low on coffee beans. The logistic challenges of getting our 100% Nigerian arabica from atop the Mambila plateau to our premises in Abuja are sometimes exacerbated by the rains, or, in one case, a fatal accident along the Numan—Kaltungo road. But I remain determined to play my part in mainstreaming Nigerian coffee locally, continentally, and globally. I’ll share a slide of the many places our coffee has been to soon—all continents except Australia really. On this journey, I am ever appreciative to my key officers, Charles Efiong, Muhammad Isa Dikko, and Janice Malachi; as well as to my Board, including Brig Gen Saleh Bala (Rtd), Dr. Jekwu Ozoemene, Edidiong Akan, Ignatius Onwusorom, and Suleiman Usman Yusuf. And, of course, to customer-turned-friends like Dr. Dahiru Bala and the many others who put out a word for us in rooms we were not in. Lastly, our bankers, Sterling Bank, and its dynamic CEO, Abubakar Suleiman. E ku se! - Richard Ali, CEO."
