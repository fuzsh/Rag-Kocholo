        "text": "After existing quietly for nearly a decade, the sensitively named Kwararafa University, Wukari is stepping out to be recognised in the space of knowledge production. It is doing this in a double-barrelled manner. On March 17th, 2017, it would join Dr. Shekarau Angyu Masa Ibi Kuvyon II, the Aku Uka of Wukari and the Visitor to the university in celebrating the 40th anniversary of his reign. The celebration will take place at the Convocation Square of the university. It continues the following day at the maiden convocation ceremony of the university during which Professor Yakubu Ochefu, the Vice Chancellor, will deliver his address while former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar will deliver the Convocation Lecture. The climax would appear to be the award of honorary degrees to the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Saad Abubakar 111, Senator Daisy Danjuma and Prof Julius Okojie, former Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, (NUC). It is a selection that signposts the multi-culturalist and nationalist ambition of the very young university."
