        "text": "T three &amp a half hour dvd of Mysterious Island (2005) was originally a two part mini-series for the Hallmark Channel. Thailand stands in for the Mysterious Island. Kyle MacLauchlan is Captain Cyrus Smith who escapes with others from a American Civil War prison camp by balloon &amp (just as happened in Jules Verne's novel) is then blown most improbably from the Atlantic seaboard to the South Pacific where they land in the place that Captain Nemo calls home.\n\nNemo is played by Patrick Stewart, who together with his sweety Joseph (Roy Anthony Mould) wear very faggoty hats &amp look at one another meaningly, Joseph being the wife of the partnership trying to keep his butch captain from doing anything too evil while pursuing his dream of inventing a super-weapon so super that mutually insured destruction will begin a century sooner than actually happened. Captain Smith knows the world will destroy itself, but half-crazed Captain Nemo thinks universal terror will ring in an era of peace.\n\nThe lengthy teleplay has all the faults one would expect of a miniseries but worse since the Hallmark Channel tends toward the infantile when not being merely preachy. Set design is \"pretty good for a telefilm\" &amp Nemo's bat cave (complete with theme song that sounds awfully like the theme from the Batman movies) is more convincing than most of the many caves visited in sundry Star Trek shows; but look at them too much &amp they become fairly minimalist. The submarine Nautillus is kinda cool though seemingly much larger on the inside than the outside. Nemo keeps it parked in the cave &amp never uses it, not even to escape from the Island when the volcano goes kaboom.\n\nPart One shows the escape to Mysterious Island where right off the bat a giant preying mantis bites the head off the only \"extra\" character who came along. The rest of the cast were needed for the story si all encounters with giant bugs that follow are pretty easily dealt with. Part One also pretty much assumes there is only one example of each giant thingy, but in Part Two they corrected that assumption as there were lots of big spiders.\n\nThe bugs aren't badly animated compared to Saturday morning cartoons, but one curiosity is how the opening scenes of the film manage never to show the balloon, but only the basket that is rocking in front of the camera with people in it. If the FX crew could give the film one giant scorpion, one truly goofy giant mosquito, one not-at-all-bad giant preying mantis, one ultra-cartoony giant cobra, why the heck couldn't they show the balloon? The cheapness of the film just about does it in even as a kiddy flick.\n\nI liked that Nemo &amp Joseph made googoo eyes at one another in what seemed to be a private joke between gay actors rather than a directorial choice, but the more overt romance between Captain Smith &amp the Civil War nurse (Gabriel Anwar) was so tepid the kiddies watching this thing might not even realize there's a love story in it.\n\nScanty &amp mediocre though the giant bug animation happens to be, these provide a few good seconds of fun at long intervals. Part II however doesn't give so much, devolving into a bad pirate movie where the pirates are such exaggerative cliches it's a wonder none of them say \"harrrr matey\" &amp carry stuffed parrots on their shoulders Monty Python style. But to give Vinnie Jones his due as Pirate Bob, the goofy fun he's having hamming it up as an absurdist villain is sometimes infectious.\n\nThe pirate assault on Mysterious Island is quite careful never to be scary or violent &amp it's one long yawner until there's a joke with a squid tentacle &amp finally that's all over &amp we can have a climax that involves shooting lots of giant spiders which are as convincing as the giant spiders in most other giant spider movies. In all, this version of the Jules Verne classic failed to live up to even my low expectation.\n\nThe reason I watched this bad thing to the very end is because it had Kyle &amp Patrick in it &amp I can look at them very happily even in bad films.\n\nPlus I always so adored the 1961 version driven by the stop-motion animation FX of Ray Harryhausen, artistic master of the form, &amp there's always a temptation to compare a newer version to that excellent film.\n\nIt has an effective score from Bernard Hermann. And instead of cheezy CGI insects one at a time like the easily squashed giant mosquito of the Hallmark Channel miniseries, Harryhausen gives us a truly scary bee hive with our best-liked characters getting sealed in a waxy chamber.\n\nCredibly animated puppets include the infamous flightless chicken &amp a terrifying crab that looks so real because Harryhausen used actual crabs, which he afterward ate.\n\nAlso the balloon escape that launches the adventure is a visual marvel, as what kind of retarded Hallmark Channel filmmaker would it have taken to have a balloon escape in a movie &amp never manage to show the balloon. The timing of Harryhausen's FX is such that action never flags, but the story carrying the film from one spectacular event to the next is fully engaging.\n\nThe fifteen-chapter serial version of Mysterious Island (1951) directed by Spencer Gorden Bennet featured Leonard Penn as Captain Nemo, Richard Crane as Captain Cyrus Harding, Gene Roth as the pirate, Terry Frost as the wild man.\n\nSet during the American Civil War as in the Jules Verne original, &amp beginning with a flight out of the Deep South by balloon, little beyond that resembles Verne.\n\nAmidst much else there's a conquering Princess Rulu (Karen Randle) from outer space &amp a savage lost race called the Volcano People. It mixes Buck Rogers with Jules Verne &amp if you already know how silly Columbia serials could be &amp you like them anyway, this one's par for the course.\n\nThe wonderfully silly 1929 version starred Lionel Barrymore, Montagu Love, Jane Daly, &amp Lloyd Hughes. The submarine journey was originally in two-strip Technicolor, though the color version does not survive. Plus the largely silent film has sound sequences. It cost four million dollars to make &amp recouped only a tiny fragment of its investment, so was a pricy gamble MGM would not again make for many years.\n\nCount Dakkar (Barrymore) has founded a technologically advanced utopian city near a Graustarkian nation. When things go awry there are battles with a sea serpent, a giant squid, a battle between submarines, &amp an encounter with an underwater city populated by an unknown race of humanoids called Ictholites &amp which are the cutest damned things, kind of like the Teletubbies crossed with Donald Duck.\n\nSome of the finest early special effects are in this film, &amp even after all these many decades it is less unconvincing than low-grade CGI FX for cable TV.\n\ncopyright Â© by Paghat the Ratgirl"
