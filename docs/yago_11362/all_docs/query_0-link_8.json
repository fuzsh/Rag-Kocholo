        "meta_description": "In the Kingdom of Hetvia, in 1850, Count Andre Dakkar devotes his life and fortune to probing the mysteries of the ocean depths by constructing two submarines on his island off the mainland. Falon, a nobleman, is anxious to overthrow the throne by revolution and seeks the inventor's aid; failing, he captures Dakkar and his crew while his assistant, Nikolai, is testing one of the sea craft; but Dakkar's men rescue him from torture. Falon's men damage the submarine, which descends to the ocean floor, where Dakkar's party observe an underground city populated by strange creatures whose gratitude they win by slaying a dragon with torpedoes. Sonia, Dakkar's sister, wrecks the other submarine in a battle with Falon's men, and Falon's blood incites the underwater creatures to divert an octopus that mortally wounds Dakkar. After the island is recaptured, Dakkar willingly chooses burial in his submarine.",
