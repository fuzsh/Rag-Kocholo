        "text": "Cabot Yerxa was a naturalist and he wrote his observations about various animals, plants, and the desert. Below are excerpts from his column, On the Desert Since 1913, in The Desert Sentinel.\n\nOne of the most interesting creatures to be found in the desert is the tortoise, which is classed as a reptile because it crawls. In the ocean, similar creatures, which grow to great size, are called terrapins, and from them turtle soup is made.\n\nAll over the U.S., you are very familiar with mud turtles, seen along the banks of lakes and rivers. They will eat meat. But our desert tortoise is a vegetarian and eats only grass or leaves. It cannot swim but lives its whole life on dry land.\n\nThis very curious tortoise..is remarkable because its skeleton is brought to the surface of its body. But in the tortoise, the bones of the chest are formed into sort of hard, rounded box, which contains within itself all the muscles and viscera. At the will of the little fellow, its four legs and head can be withdrawn into the shell, leaving no apparent openings. Thus it can rest in peace and perfect safety. Many small living things on the desert tremble in terror when snakes, foxes, coyotes, or large birds appear. But not the tortoise. Let the coyotes howl! Who cares? Not he.\n\nAll four feet of the tortoise have rather thick, dull claws with which he can dig slowly, but well. With the front ones, he digs holes in the ground for winter home or to get shade from the desert sun.\n\nDo not think that you can rush out of doors in Desert Hot Springs and find a tortoise in an hour. In over 40 years I have only found three in this valley. You see, a tortoise must have green grass and leaves in order to exist, and in this area, we do not have enough rain to make this possible. However, in the Big Mojave Desert, there is more vegetation, and therefore tortoises are in happier surroundings.\n\nIn captivity the yare very fond of lettuce, bananas, peaches, grapes, and other fruits. They particularly also enjoy green corn on the cob, picking off one kernel at a time until all are gone. Tortoises on hot days will hunt shade or dig a hole underground. They delight in throwing earth over their backs with skillful movements of the front feet. This lessens the heat of sunrays on the shell.\n\nAt the Old Indian Pueblo, I keep about 23 desert tortoises as pets and for observation, and have had them for a number of years. In November they go into hibernation and do not wake up until the middle of March. During all this time they do not eat, or drink, or move about.\n\nMuch controversy exists as to the exact age of the desert tortoises, and their life span is not known. But all observers agree that they attain great age, probably 100 years or so. I myself have had some for 50 years. Therefore my conclusion would be that they eventually reach a grown-up size, after which they do not get much larger.\n\nThese denizens of the desert are very slow and patient. If you feel all in a dither, flustered and hurried, just sit down and watch a tortoise for half an hour and you will calm down. Because after all, you have nothing to gain by all the dither. Relax—rest—slow down, and will live longer. The turtle does. Why not you?\n\nListen to Cabot Yerxa! As summer approaches and plans are made, remember to find some time to relax, rest, and slow down.\n\nCole Eyraud was a man who was civic-minded, participated in his community, and loved history. He served on various boards in the Coachella Valley such as Sunline Transit Agency, Coachella Valley Historical Society, and Riverside County Arts Planning/Advisory Committee among others. The following are excerpts from his letters to his mother, in which we glean a glimpse of a young Cole Eyraud during his service in the U.S. Navy.\n\nOn August 10, 1943, Cole enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and during his service (1943-1946), he wrote on United States Navy onionskin stationery. These letters were mailed from Sout Pacific outposts to his parents in Glendale, CA.\n\nApril 3, 1945\n\nI mailed you my camera today by airmail $4.20. It is in a cigar box and also along with it a roll of exposed color film. Now the rewind handle on my camera is broken (not bad). So I want you to take it and get it fixed and given a general checkup. Have the lens looked at and taken apart and cleaned, etc. Be sure and get it attended to as soon as you possibly can, then mail it back to me by first class. We had some trouble and everyone had to turn in their cameras, so I am killing two birds with one stone. Mine is on record as being sent home. By the time you get it back to me, everything will be OK again on cameras.\n\nApril 10, 1945\n\nAlmost all the fellows in our gang have earrings. I started it and now a lot of the guys are getting them. Jeanne did raise hell about me wearing an earring. I answered her but haven’t gotten a letter back yet.\n\nThat earring with the star is sure nice. I have all the guys envious of all the different kinds I have.\n\nApril 17, 1945\n\nI got all the color slides, 6 envelopes or three rolls. I was kinda disappointed. I guess they were like that as it was outdated film. A kid gave it to me, so I’m not out any [money].\n\nI got your swell letter No. 87 with the two sets of earrings in it yesterday. Those earrings were sure swell. I like the 4-leaf clover one best.\n\nDaddy is certainly doing a lot of work on his grapes. I sure hope they come out as good this year as last. Comparing the amount of work and vines trimmed, I think you should really have a good crop.\n\nI have sent you 7 snapshots in another envelope that were taken here onboard the barge. I will send the slides soon to have prints made.\n\nJuly 11, 1945\n\nBelieve it or not, I met three kids from Glendale today — one at the beer place. Then tonight two kids just from the States moved into our barracks. One kid went to Hoover. The other Glendale High and graduated in my class. I told him my last name and he remembered my first name. So we had a big talk. And to think he was just there a few days ago. Boy would I like to get home and see the place once more.\n\nI sent Peggy a grass skirt the other day and sent Myrtle a present. Her birthday is Aug. 4. But I didn’t get a card.\n\nSay I don’t seem to be doing much writing, as I have a lot to talk about and have been on this for an hour in between talking. I will close and write tomorrow.\n\nJuly 19, 1945\n\nHave received a lot of back mail in the last few days, but am still short letters No. 101, 102, 104, 110, 111. Also one packet of the first four packets of Kodachrome prints. I did receive the 50 prints of the barge. Now I will have to send them to one of the fellows to sell for me. Or I’ll be stuck. Oh, yes, I got the roll of 620 Kodacolor yesterday.\n\nMarge has sent me three books since I have been here. She sure is swell. Also sent me a bunch of pictures, but I don’t like the way she fixes her hair. My N.Y. redhead writes at least once or twice each week. She is real nice too.\n\nThrough his letters, we learn more about Cole and his close relationship with his parents and his carefree spirit. In our recent publication, we learn more about Cole, but what he most will be remembered for is rescuing Cabot’s Pueblo Museum from being demolished, in doing so, saving Cabot’s legacy for future generations.\n\nAs we begin a new year, the excerpt below describes Cabot’s dreams and hopes about his desert claim and his discovery of the mineral hot water. One of his wishes was for a healthy city.\n\nNo person in this world will ever get enough money, or gain enough distinction over his fellows, to equal the thrill and quiet joy of the ownership of land, which was mine when I stood on my desert claim for the first time. All papers signed and filed, there round me were some boxes of groceries [and] a canteen of water with a blanket spread on the ground. This was my land. This feeling was, I am sure, the same with all pioneer homesteaders.\n\nThe future of the desert and the future reward to each man differed greatly according to his slant on life’s picture. To some it was a field of alfalfa standing strong and green in winter sunshine. To some this alfalfa would turn into money as baled hay, or be fed to cows for milk, or to pigs to get fat and go to market. Some men talked chickens of different types, and turkeys too. A few expanded the idea of winter vegetables, or early fruits going to market. We heard stories of fantastic prices sometimes paid for the first grapes, figs, tomatoes, etc., which were then growing in very small quantities at widely separated spots on the desert between here and the Mexican line. Every man had a dream of the future in which he would be the man who had a large bank account and could write checks freely. It mattered not that no man in the desert could change a five-dollar bill at that time.\n\nAnother fact to be noted besides the general optimistical outlook, was that each settler was sure that he had the very finest claim in the whole desert. Each man would listen politely while another was explaining the good qualities of his homestead, but at the first break in the conversation, the listener would then expound at great length with convincing detail why his very own claim was by far and above any denial the best ding-busted piece of desert land between here and Mexico.\n\n. . . My own dream in the distant past day was not of alfalfa, chickens, or pigs, little or big, but based on beef cattle. The beef cattle would provide money for an art gallery, museum, and time to paint desert pictures. . ..\n\nMy entrance into the ownership of cattle was to have had a very meager start. I planned to buy one beef cow, which was all the money I could then hope to get. The cow would have a calf, and in the years following I would be in the beef cattle business.\n\nBut when I discovered the hot mineral waters and we found that it would help ailing people, all plans were changed. Bob Carr and I reshaped our dreams of the future to take recognition of this very surprising circumstance. He and I sat often on hilltops, gazing at many thousands of uninhabited acres of hot, dry desert land. If the weather was bad, we crouched by small fires in deep arroyos or in thick brush. But always, much of the long talks was the same. Bob and I visualized a health city, growing up out of the greasewood here on the desert!\n\nWith Cabot Yerxa’s keen interest in art and studying at Académie Julian in Paris, it is not surprising that he befriended many artists in the desert. Among them were Carl Eytel and Agnes Pelton, whose works are in museum collections and prized by private collectors. One artist with whom Cabot became especially close was Burt Procter, whose work is in the permanent collection of The Nelson Museum of the West in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nBurt Procter was born in Massachusetts in 1901. His family’s 1908 move to Oak Park, Illinois, put him in proximity to the renowned Art Institute of Chicago, where he took art classes. It is anyone’s guess what route his creative endeavors might have taken had he not moved to Wyoming at the age of 17 and become enthralled by the Western landscape and cowboys in particular.\n\nProcter relocated to California and studied mining engineering at Stanford University, after which he got a job at Grand Canyon National Park. In 1920, he moved to Pasadena and worked as a commercial artist.\n\nLater in that decade, Procter moved back East — to New York, where he spent five years as an art director for an advertising agency. When he returned to California in the 1930s, he returned to his previous occupation as a mining engineer and spent his leisure time painting Western/desert scenes. He studied at two prestigious Los Angeles establishments, Chouinard Art Institute and Otis College of Art and Design. Eventually, he committed to painting full time.\n\nIn the late ’30s, Procter married and settled in Southern California with his wife, Katherine. They spent their early years together living in Corona del Mar in the summer and in the desert in winter, renting a small rock house in the section of Palm Springs known as Araby.\n\nWe do not know when or how Burt and Katherine Procter met Cabot and Portia Yerxa. But in 1946, they were living in Pasadena with their daughter, Virginia, when Katherine wrote a letter that indicates they had known each other for a while. The news in that letter was not good.\n\nWhen I wrote you Tues. afternoon, little did I realize that tragedy would come so soon. At 5:30 that day, Burt and Ginny took our old trailer up to the corner to get air in the tires. Since the valve in one was crooked, Burt took the tire off. Somehow or other, the tire exploded and the rim cut Burt’s left thumb off and it landed 15 feet away. (The letter goes on to report he was treated at the hospital.)\n\nBurt Procter used his mining skills looking for lost mines, which we know was an activity Cabot also pursued. They also went camping together. At some point in time, the Procters purchased land adjoining that of the pueblo museum and camped on it. In 1949, they sent Cabot and Portia a Christmas card with a Norman Rockwell cover and the following note written by Katherine, which indicates they had built a cabin on their land:\n\nI don’t know of any place I’d rather be now than in our little cabin at the Yerxa settlement. It’s cold, windy, and rainy! We certainly enjoyed every minute and thank you. We will be in P.S. one night at least between Christmas and New Year’s and hope we can see you a few minutes. Ginny is more excited over Santa this year than ever before, and we have a 9-foot tree up beautifully decorated. Burt’s mother and father will be with us for Christmas. I wish we could see you, but we’ll be thinking of you.\n\nThe inside of another Christmas card, the cover of this one featuring a painting by Procter titled Ranch Christmas (shown above), indicates Cabot had provided reference material for a commissioned work by Procter.\n\nHave been working on Mrs. Howard’s elephant tree and wrote her yesterday that it would be complete Monday. We’ll probably be down between Xmas and New Year’s, and I told her I would bring it and leave it with you or wherever she wished. I started it a long time ago, but never could make it look convincing. In its present shape, I am well pleased myself. I hope she is too. Many thanks for elephant tree article. I had thought bark was reddish. I have checked and double checked and am now convinced that tree is right as it stands in the picture. I want to hear your reaction to it.\n\nFor 17 years, Burt Procter served as art director for the Pageant of the Masters live re-creations of famed artworks at the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts. In 1956, one of his paintings — titled The Harpist (a departure from his typical subject matter) was one of the works staged in the Pageant. Cabot’s Pueblo Museum archives contain an undated clipping from the Desert Sentinel newspaper that reads as follows:\n\nBurt Procter has land adjoining Cabot’s Old Indian Pueblo and will build a home and studio here where desert scenery is close at hand. There is now a one-man show of his with 22 large oil paintings on exhibit in the Cowie Art Gallery located at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. For several days of this week, Cabot Yerxa has been visiting the Procters at their home in Laguna Beach. Burt Procter is Art Director for the Laguna Beach Festival of the Arts. In this connection, he has to paint about 40 backdrops for the living pictures. While in Laguna, Cabot helped him in painting one backdrop, and its size was 9 feet by 23 feet.\n\nThe May 29, 1953, issue of Desert Sentinel newspaper included a note in one of its columns that seems to hint the Procters had perhaps finished their home as above referenced: We are happy to welcome those two fine people, the Burt Proctors [sic] as neighbors in DHS. They’re the sort of folks who give a town tone, if you know what I mean. Burt is one of our more distinguished artists. The painting he gave Cabot and Portia Yerxa some years ago as a wedding present is beautiful.\n\nAfter Procter’s death in 1980, Wyoming gallery owner Robert Nelson purchased many of his paintings and his studio setup. In 1998, Nelson opened The Nelson Museum of the West in Cheyenne, which includes The Studio of Artist Burt Procter\n\nWestern Art and Architecture published an interview with collectors Robert and Charla Nelson in March of 2015. To the question “What is your most loved piece and why?” Charla Nelson answered, “The one piece that keeps popping to mind is the one Bob gave me. It’s a Burt Procter painting of an adobe church, which hangs in our master in Wyoming, It’s a 10 on a scale of one to 10.”\n\nProcter died in Palm Springs on July 2, 1980.\n\nMany paintings by Procter, oils on panel and canvas, have sold at auction in a wide range of prices. According to one online source, the record price paid for his work was $30,800 in 2005 for a painting of a cowboy on horseback titled Canyon Walls. A six-minute film shot in Procter’s studio in the 1950s, featuring narration over video, illustrates the artist’s “direct method” of painting. It can be viewed here. Cabot Yerxa often expounded on the joys of simple living. However, we cannot help but think he would have appreciated that technology allows us to literally tap into an artist’s legacy.\n\nIn one of his “On the Desert Since 1913” columns for Desert Sentinel newspaper, Cabot Yerxa quoted from an editorial column by another Coachella Valley pioneer: Randall Henderson, Palm Desert founder and publisher of Desert Magazine. In 1956, Cabot wrote that the excerpts below had appeared in Henderson’s publication “10 or 12 years ago.” They constituted a tribute to three of Henderson’s compatriots, desert rats who also were writers: Cabot in Desert Hot Springs and Harry Oliver and Paul Wilhelm in Thousand Palms.\n\nMy friend Harry Oliver of Thousand Palms, California, is building an adobe house, a quaint little replica of an Old Spanish mission. Harry has a formula I can recommend to those who aspire to live to a ripe old age. He calls it his 20-year plan. It is very simple. The first day he makes 10 adobe bricks, good bricks with just the right amount of adobe and gravel in them. It takes three days for the bricks to dry and cure. Harry spends the next three days in contemplation of his handiwork. On the fifth day, he carefully lays the bricks in the wall. Then he rests and is ready to start work the following day on the next 10 bricks. And thus the cycle continues. Not a very speedy way to build a house perhaps, but Harry’s theory is that too much speed is taking all the fun out of life for the majority of Americans. And perhaps he has something there.\n\nAnother desert neighbor with a 20-year plan is Cabot Yerxa, one of the old timers in the Desert Hot Springs section of Coachella Valley. Cabot very recently brought a Texas bride to his desert homestead, and now they are building a combination dwelling and art studio up in a gully at the foot of the Little San Bernardino Mountains. Cabot has been gathering materials for that studio for the last 30 years. He has lumber and chicken wire and rocks and sash scattered all over the landscape. But slowly, one stick at a time, Cabot is putting his house together; and it is going to be a work of art when finished, which will be in about 20 years — that is, if he stays on the job and doesn’t go gallivanting around with his easel and paintbrushes, as these artists are prone to do.\n\nHarry Oliver and Cabot Yerxa are speed-demons compared with Paul Wilhelm at Thousand Palms Oasis. Paul already has been on the job 20 years, and his grand plans for the development of a super resort on the oasis are still in the dream stage. At the present rate of progress, Paul will need at least 100 years to convert his poetical ideas into cement and wood and windowpanes.\n\nBut do not get me wrong. I envy those fellows, Harry and Cabot and Paul. Somehow, they have found a way to detour all the zip and bustle and worry that keep the rest of us in a state of demoralization. They are healthy and happy in doing the things they want to do.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, it all adds up to this: We need more poets and artists in this old world and less chamber of commerce secretaries and super salesmen.\n\nWhile we at Cabot’s Pueblo Museum would refrain from disparaging chamber of commerce secretaries and salesmen (super or not, as long as they are ethical), we appreciate the point Randall Henderson made in his conclusion.\n\nAs the calendar year begins to wind down, the days grow shorter (at least until the winter solstice on December 21), and a season of compressed holidays arrives, it behooves us to consider the practice of creative homesteaders and slow down the pace with which we attack things. We’re not advocating procrastination, but, rather, a measured approach to progress and, sometimes, just allowing ourselves time to reflect and dream.\n\nCabot Yerxa and fellow Desert Hot Springs pioneers envisioned a city capitalizing on the area’s hot mineral water and immediately recognized the need for roadways to encourage commercial investments (and bring jobs to the desert). The following comes from Cabot’s “On the Desert Since 1913” newspaper columns, which have been collected in a book published by Cabot’s Museum Foundation and available for purchase through the museum’s Trading Post.\n\nBill Anderson and I decided we could do something about roads. We first made a road from Bill’s cabin down Palm Drive to the corner of Pierson Boulevard for one-half mile. On each side, we planted tamarisk cuttings and watered them as often as possible. They did well for a time but eventually died because there came a period when neither Bill nor I had any chance to carry water.\n\nThen we made a one-way road from my Miracle Hill cabin to Frank Houghton’s and from there down the section line of Pierson Boulevard to the corner of Palm Drive. From the central corner of roads, we made a hit-and-miss road, taking advantage of any existing trails, all the way to the railroad at Garnet — a distance of seven miles!\n\nIt was not for some years that Riverside County appropriated any money for roads here — and then in only very small amounts. Bill and I always traveled with a pick, a shovel, and a mattock [an adze and axe tool] in our Ford Model T cars. We very patiently and laboriously worked at removing stones or taking out brush as we traveled about the desert. When we went to the post office [in Garnet], we worked the road down and back again.\n\nOur objective in all this unpaid work was partly to make our own trips with less trouble. But also, because we were very poor people, we hoped that, by making roads into the desert, city people and investors would come see what was here and make developments.\n\nWhen Riverside County authorized money for a road from Desert Hot Springs’ old schoolhouse to Two Bunch Palms, Cabot and Wilbur McCarger took on the task.\n\nWe started very early one sultry morning. We were reluctant to leave the welcome shade of the schoolhouse. But shouldering picks, shovels, heavy mattocks, and canteens of water, we dragged our steps out into the soft sand of the open desert.\n\nWe set up small flags to guide our direction and to keep the trail as straight as possible. The sun climbed higher in a pale blue sky and shone down without benefit of any breeze. Big, rolling clouds appeared over the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and humidity increased rapidly. We drank from our canteens often, and our few clothes were wet with perspiration. White patches of salt appeared on our shirts where this evaporated. When near Orr Sang’s cabin, I walked a half-mile to it with empty canteens, trusting to find water. None was there. With labored exertion, I made my way back to where we were working and the last canteen of water. We chopped down a few more greasewoods, drank all the remaining water, and then quit for the day. We had each brought water and had drunk seven gallons, but the sun was yet high in the sky. We learned later that the temperature in Palm Springs that day was 128 degrees.\n\nCabot also recalls when state officials sent an engineer to the desert to survey a roadway from Banning to Arizona. Some six men, Cabot included, met the engineer at Whitewater.\n\nThe engineer was driving a single-seat auto of that year’s vintage when we started out on our expedition. Frank Green and I went ahead, picking out the routes. One had a shovel and the other a grub hoe. We merely indicated the path to follow, whether to the right or left of bushes, rocks, or deep-cut wash banks, and making minor improvements in the terrain, however always keeping a fairly straight line towards an objective. Jack Thelson and the other men kept close to the engineer. At times, they pushed the auto or filled in holes and cut down brush. When the auto could no longer proceed with its own power, Thornton Green came up and attached the mules, who hauled the car to better ground.\n\nIt was fairly easy as far as Garnet. The real work started when the group left there bound for Thousand Palms. Water, food, and blankets were carried along for the men and forage for the animals. We ate and slept as circumstances required. The other bunch of men from Indio, intent upon the road being established north of the railroad tracks, were waiting for us at Thousand Palms.\n\nOf course there was no pay of any kind for us, but we pioneer men were glad to give a few days’ time and much hard work to see an improved road come into the desert. And that road now has become Highway Number 60-70-99 [superseded by Interstate 10 in 1964] because of our efforts. The names of Frank Green and Jack Thelson should be written in the record, because it was these two who learned of the new road survey and called upon the rest of us to volunteer services. Just think how important that highway has been and still is to the growth and happiness of this community and the desert region — in fact, the entire state — as a gateway to California carrying trucks and vehicular traffic all over the country.\n\nThe next time you drive through Desert Hot Springs or along the I-10 corridor through the Coachella Valley, give credit to the pioneers who put forth painstaking efforts to establish routes for automobiles. And if you see heavy equipment at a road-construction project, don’t forget that homesteaders labored with hand tools — and under an unrelenting sun — when they blazed a trail across the desert sand. As we enjoy our car stereos and air conditioning, perhaps we’ll find a bit of extra driving pleasure in appreciating the fact that we’re able to travel without picks, shovels, and mattocks in our trunks.\n\nMyths draw us in with their colorful stories and characters. The ones that tell of lost treasures are even more compelling, because we love to think we could discover them, whether or not we actively pursue such dreams. The legend of the Lost Peg Leg Mine is commemorated by California Registered Historical Landmark No. 750 in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.\n\nYou can find multiple versions of the story behind the infamous Thomas “Peg Leg” Smith. Suffice it to say that he found gold nuggets in 1829 and, years later, traded his tale and guide services to gullible prospectors in exchange for liquor. He died in 1866, but people continued looking for the “lost” mine.\n\nCabot Yerxa was a prospector as well as a homesteader and museum operator. He panned for gold in the desert and in Alaska. Letters in Cabot’s Pueblo Museum archives indicate he and his friend Harold Kinney followed the Peg Leg myth around this time 72 years ago. We begin with a letter Kinney wrote to Cabot on August 26, 1949.\n\nI told you of Mrs. Sophia Williams, the medium who rode around helping a doctor find hidden or rather buried crosses. I presumed she still lived in Chicago and would not be available for us for the Peg Leg deal. But she has lived out here for a year.\n\nI’d better explain that she is not only a direct voice medium, but anyone present can hear the voice emanating from her body. In a room in daytime with windows and doors open and sunlight streaming in, she merely sat quietly and evidently called mentally for my [presumably deceased] father in my presence.\n\nTo boil this down, let me say that he said he has found the mine; he will be present with us when we go there with Mrs. Williams and tell us exactly where it is. …. It involves digging the topsoil off a foot maybe to get at the stuff, and later probably involve regular mining operations. When I asked him if there was enough of it to be worth setting up mining machinery, etc., he said there’s plenty there.\n\nI have arranged with Mrs. Williams to ride down with me this coming Tuesday evening to Desert Hot Springs to meet you and stay overnight, getting an early start — you, she, and I — Wednesday morning, going to the mine, setting up monuments for two claims (dad says), and then returning you home and going on to record or file the claims on Wednesday.\n\nI am assuming you will be willing to go along and can furnish two shovels or spades and maybe a pick-axe, plus a compass to take bearings for filing the claims.\n\nI had to borrow money at the bank a month ago to keep going, so hope we’ll find enough nuggets in the loose topsoil from our short efforts Wednesday to cash in and have something to operate on. I am hoping that you can take charge of the mining operations, with of course others to be hired who have done such work and know it well.\n\nIf you see any hitch in these plans or cannot go with us Wednesday, wire me collect to the above address so I can make other plans. Please make hotel reservations at an inexpensive place for Mrs. Williams and for me. I’m footing the bills and haven’t any to waste, so make it light on the bill.\n\nI hope to reach your house by 9:30 p.m. But if you want to get to bed earlier, I’ll just look for a note on your gate so as not to disturb you.\n\nA subsequent letter (undated) reads in part as follows:\n\nFinally found a place to get forms today and have just finished filling them out; will take to p.o. now to register mail.\n\nSeemed foolish not to file a claim for you. Called it The Psychic!\n\nI have your pick and shovel in trunk of the car.\n\nDriving back down to mine site to hunt in canyon and dig. Will bring two fellows along to help.\n\nMust set up a monument for you. Suggest you drive down too and help with that and with the hunt. If you come, please try to bring a lantern, plus snake-bite kit if you have on hand, plus post. If you don’t show, I’ll send your shovel and pick to you by parcel post. Like to visit your place, but too hot and takes more time.\n\nKinney signed the following document, addressed, “to whom it may concern,” on September 16, 1949.\n\nThis is to certify that the three claims known as The Judge, The Collie [both of the foregoing refer to Kinney’s father] and The Psychic — claims believed to cover the Peg Leg Smith mines — and recorded in the names of Mrs. Sophia Williams, Mr. Cabot Yerxa, and Mr. Harold Kinney with the Recorder of San Diego County, are to be pooled so that any assets or discoveries of value in any one of these shall be jointly owned by all three persons above mentioned.\n\nThe claims are located in the Cleveland National Forest, approximately three miles east of Highway 79 on the road marked Indian Flats Camp.\n\nThe three parties concerned hereby declare their intention to pool all resources and efforts and work toward the retention and exploitation of these three claims, to share equally in any profits accruing from same.\n\nWe do not know if these claims yielded anything of value, but we can believe that the parties involved enjoyed exploring the potential of a myth.\n\nCabot’s friend Harry Oliver, also a desert rat and spinner of tales, started a Peg Leg Smith Liars Contest held in Borrego Springs. The photo is from the annual Peg Leg Day celebration includes Oliver (black hat and pipe) and Cabot, holding a copy of Harry Oliver’s Desert Rat Scrap Book.\n\nA little more than a half-mile west of Cabot’s Pueblo Museum lies another property bearing the Desert Hot Springs pioneer’s name. Twelve years ago this month, Cabot Yerxa Elementary School opened for K-5 education. As someone who enjoyed imparting lessons, Cabot surely would be pleased not only with having a school named for him, but also with the museum’s commitment to ongoing programs with multiple elementary schools in the Palm Springs Unified School District. With the school year starting this month, it seems like a good time to step back to 1912, when Desert Hot Springs’ first schoolteacher arrived. The following edited sections come from the museum’s book On the Desert Since 1913.\n\nEthel Rouse was a very young and a very small person. But what she lacked in size she more than made up for in quiet courage, enthusiasm, cheerfulness, and ability to overcome difficulties. Her arrival at the Garnet railroad station was in one of those sandstorms that sometimes sweep out of nowhere with such fury.\n\nThe station agent helped the four McCarger boys load her trunk into a small wagon pulled by two burros. The journey was made over several miles of sandy roads to the McCarger cabin, where she made her home with the family for the school year. Not a house was passed, not a fence, not a tree. All was open desert. The burros plodded at one mile per hour. The wind howled and kept the small cavalcade in a cloud of moving sand. Such was the initiation of this young city girl to her first teaching position in the desert. Only next morning was she informed that there was no schoolhouse.\n\nThere was a hurried meeting of the very few scattered neighbors and a location and plan decided upon. When he arrived in the desert, Jack Riley dug a hole in the ground and placed over it a patchwork of materials for shade. Just recently, he had started a very small cabin nearby. It was decided to enlarge his dugout and let him live in his unfinished cabin. Jack drove two burros hitched to a very small, homemade scraper. The new schoolteacher and Mrs. McCarger, between them, managed to fill the scraper with earth.\n\nCabot notes that neighbors contributed time and materials as work progressed. A few sheets of battered, corrugated, galvanized iron and pieces of rusty tin were found along the railroad tracks when lumber gave out. Armloads of desert brush were stuffed into openings and onto the roof. The structure lacked a floor and a door, but a small American flag flew on a rough pole at its northeast corner. One of the McCarger boys acted as “janitor”: It was his duty to remove sand that blew into the schoolroom and to look for snakes and other desert critters that had easy access through the makeshift walls.\n\nThe children had only a piece of 1 x 12-inch board for a desk, and they sat on a crude bench. Ethel Rouse obtained from somewhere a wooden packing box, which served as her desk. She sat upon a smaller box. The schoolroom did not have a blackboard, so she scratched words and problems in simple arithmetic on the ground. She also made use of stones to illustrate addition and subtraction.\n\nIn 1914, county officials, sensing there would be more children to be schooled here, arranged to build a school on one acre of donated land near B-Bar-H Ranch. This served for the next several years, but eventually burned down.\n\nNews of the promised, carpenter-build school to be constructed out of real lumber was welcome information to all households having children. But just at this critical time, the Schlicter family, with all its children, moved to Morongo Valley. This decreased the number of youngsters to the point where there were not enough left to justify a school under county laws. Therefore, frantic appeals were made to relatives in the city to send out some children to live here on the desert. This was done and the new building completed, serving its purpose well. It also was the meeting place for picnics, a few dances, and other gatherings.\n\nExecutive director Irene Rodriguez reports that when students from the elementary school down the street visit, they learn many things about Cabot Yerxa — including the fact that their school is named in honor of his pueblo museum and not vice versa.\n\nWith the challenges of home schooling during the pandemic, one can surmise that many parents and their children, as well as teachers, will be happy to sit in classrooms this year. Any complainers might be reminded of the conditions endured by Ethel Rouse and the children of Desert Hot Springs’ pioneers — and perhaps asked to check for snakes.\n\nMany people who have read or heard about Cabot Yerxa are aware that his first name derives from the maiden name of his mother, Nellie — a distant relative of Boston’s prominent Cabots. The Yerxa surname is less well recognized. The following information on the family tree comes to us from research by Cabot’s Pueblo Museum’s History Committee.\n\nPaulus Jurcksen (or Jurkse, as the “son of” suffix could be shortened) was born about 1630 in Texel, the largest of the West Frisian Islands across from Waddensee on the mainland of Holland. He was a servant for the Maichael Jansz family and may have emigrated with them, as he married one of the daughters, Christina, in New York in 1652. He fathered nine children and died in 1676.\n\nTracing Cabot’s paternal lineage, not much is known about the next three generations beyond their names and dates of birth and death. The eldest of Paulus’ nine children was Johannes, born in 1658. Johannes also named one of his sons Johannes. The younger Johannes, born in 1700, fathered six children, one of whom was Abraham, born in 1726.\n\nIt was during Abraham’s generation that the surname spelling became Yerkse. The first reference to the family name spelling as Yerxa comes with Abraham’s son John (baptized Johannes), who was born in 1751 and was Cabot’s great great grandfather.\n\nJohn Yerxa was among colonists who remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolution. On the losing side of the Revolutionary War, John and his wife, Catherine, moved from their farm in New York’s Courtlandt Manor to New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nAmong John and Catherine’s 14 offspring was another Abraham, born in 1775. Abraham and his wife, Barbara, had 15 children, including Abraham Jr., born in 1816.\n\nA census roll in 1851 shows Abraham Jr. at the age of 34 to be a farmer. The 1861 census shows his occupation as a grocer. Abraham Jr. brought the Yerxa clan back to the United States. He and his family show up in the 1880 census rolls of Boston, Mass., and the 1885 census rolls of Minneapolis, Minn. The August 14, 1900, edition of The Saint Paul Globe published an obituary under the following headers: “Abram Yerxa is Dead: Directed Store in St. Paul Until Very Recently, Although Eighty-Four; Had Been Ill Only a Week.”\n\nThe article reported as follows: “Up to a short time before his death, he made daily visits to his store in St. Paul and overlooked the business of the establishment. Mr. Yerxa was the father of thirteen children, of whom twelve are living. Mrs. Yerxa died on May 8, after a married life of sixty-two years.”\n\nThe second-to-youngest of Abraham Jr.’s children was Cabot’s father, Frederick, born in New Brunswick in 1861. After the family settled in Boston, Frederick began working in a grocery store and fell in love with the store’s bookkeeper. According to Cabot’s own accounting, his father’s salary was not enough to marry, so he asked his older brother Woodford in North Dakota to help him get established there with his own general store. In 1882, Fred and Nellie wed in Boston and returned to North Dakota, where Cabot Abram Yerxa was born 11 months later.\n\nThe Yerxas, for the most part, appear to have been involved in farming and mercantile businesses (particularly groceries). But they also ventured into other interests. Fred’s brother Woodford was elected mayor of Fargo, N.D., at the age of 33. He subsequently partnered with Fred and brother Thomas in mercantile stores in Minnesota. Woodford later moved to California and became one of the largest growers in Sacramento Valley with 400 acres of prune trees (having imported seedlings from France). His sons Woodford Jr. and Max farmed, but also handcrafted premium fishing rods. One of the Thomases on the Yerxa family tree was a successful oil painter of urban realism; his works are in the collections of eight museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and National Academy of Design in New York. Serendipitously, a member of the Cabot’s Museum Foundation Board of Directors discovered a Yerxa name on her bookshelf — not attached to one of the museum’s publications. A native Canadian and distant relative of Cabot, Winslow Yerxa wrote Harmonica for Dummies (among other books on the harmonica).\n\nA lover of creatures great and small, Cabot Yerxa found companionship and enjoyment in the burros, snakes, lizards, and tortoises with whom he shared his property. He also had a more common pet — a situation that arose from happenstance. It was in 1953 that Cabot heard a weak cry and spotted a tiny black kitten, which retreated into a clump of thick brush. Let’s let Cabot pick up the tale from there in his own words.\n\nThat night, I carried a small saucer of milk to the spot, but saw no cat. The next morning, the dish was empty. This went on for over a week before I discerned the small fellow to be watching one night as I placed the saucer in the accustomed spot.\n\nIt took more than a month to break down the kitten’s distrust and get it to come to the goat corral for its milk. Even then, if I approached within 10 feet, it would back up and spit with fur raised along its back. Fully two months passed before it could be petted. Someone had thrown this tiny kitten away on the desert when it was so small that it could curl up in a cereal bowl. Weak, thin, and scared, it distrusted all humans. However, after three years, it has become large and strong and is a very important part of the Old Indian Pueblo. Now he acts as though he owns the place.\n\nIt never played like most kittens — never would chase a spool on a string or anything like that. It was too dignified and knew the difference between desert rats and spools on a string.\n\nBecause this cat is black with gray shades, we named him Smokey. His fur is very thick and much longer than usual. He walks proudly with his tail straight up in the air. It is much too long to be like other cats’ tails. In fact, it measures 15 inches, and the end has a curl just like a question mark. He keeps curling and uncurling the last 5 inches of his tail as he walks.\n\nAfter trying all the different canned cat foods, of which he took small interest, we tried a can of dog food. This he likes. Presumably he considered cat food too sissy for a cat that lives out of doors all the time.\n\nThis Old Indian Pueblo has 65 doors, and it is possible to enter or leave the building by any one of 17 doors. So when I first go out to gather milk from the goat, Smokey never knows which door will open. At first, he was much frustrated and would come screaming in protest for his breakfast. But Smokey now has this situation all figured out. The pueblo has 30 roof levels, and it is his custom soon after daylight to sit on one of the high levels and listen intently for a door to open. Then down he jumps from one level to another, finally to the ground to claim his breakfast.\n\nOccasionally Smokey makes hunting trips into the small canyons back of the pueblo and stays out from three to five days. Back in those canyons, there is much small life — desert rats, field mice, kangaroo rats, lizards, snakes, rabbits, etc. So he has a very exciting time, no doubt. Sometimes, he brings home with him rat tails, rabbit ears or feet as proof of his prowess. These he deposits always under one certain tree in the yard.\n\nHe drinks milk out of a blue bowl. One day, this was being washed and his milk was put in a green one. He refused to drink it. I went into the house and changed the milk into his regular blue bowl. Then he drank the milk.\n\nWhen I work outside about the buildings, mixing concrete or making repairs, Smokey comes along and sits down to watch. He accompanies me on short walks and follows closely at my heels as the goat and various desert tortoises are fed and watered for the day.\n\nWhen he sits down on his heels in quiet contemplation, he wraps that extra-long tail all around his four feet and purrs very quietly.\n\nSmokey’s transformation from weak and frightened to strong willed and contented reminds us of the power we wield when we possess caring hearts. Cabot’s devotion and patience in gaining the kitten’s trust further exemplifies the way humans should treat creatures great and small. When we question ourselves, “Why should I bother?” the answer may be as simple as “Because my efforts might make a difference.”\n\nMay typically brings the peak of wildflower season. But Mother Nature makes no guarantees, perhaps because she delights in surprises. Cabot Yerxa noted as much in his newspaper column in 1957. We hope to enjoy some of the sights — and fragrances — he describes before the calendar moves on to June. The following excerpts come from the museum’s book On the Desert Since 1913.\n\nWhen rains come in quantity, the desert puts on a very colorful show of bright blossoms over its very many wide stretches of open land. Low-lying desert verbenas cling closely to the shifting sands. Encilia bursts into masses of brilliant yellow as it covers the rocky lower slopes of the Little San Bernardino Mountains surrounding our village. The ocotillo with its flaming red tops are worth the necessary miles of travel to see them in blossom. Mixed in along the encilia, usually on somewhat rocky terrain, will be found the very noticeably large flowers of beavertail cacti.\n\nThe sturdy barrel cacti, by far the largest in this desert, put forth a single ring of greenish yellow flowers, like a crown. The creosote, with a more common name of greasewood, is very widely distributed over all our Southwestern deserts. If encouraged by rain, it will fill with small bright blossoms, which stay on for several weeks. These finally change to small white fluffs containing seed, which blow away with the wind, thus starting new bushes elsewhere. The petals drop to the ground and simulate a yellow carpet.\n\nThe Indian dye plant puts forth a profusion of bluish purple flowers, which have a very distinctive odor if crushed. Desert chuckwallas, that largest and most interesting of all our lizards, are very fond of these flowers and will climb up among the branches of this bush to obtain them. But when you see a desert indigo bush in full bloom, you will be amazed at its strong blue-colored flowers, which are violet-like in shape. No one can help but being thrilled with the beauty of this bush.\n\nNow I must mention my favorite flowering tree: It is the desert willow. The flowers are bell-shaped, often tinted pale pink, and have a faint, delicate, sweet odor very noticeable in early morning hours.\n\nAfter rains come, nature will provide very many kinds of flowers in various colors. There will be desert daisies, beautiful white Rafinesque, desert poppies, desert asters, star flowers, thresh plant, desert trumpet, desert sunflowers, evening primrose, wild potato, desert milkweed, coyote melon, palo verde sage, desert mistletoe, Mormon tea, desert sand lilies, and chia.\n\nDo not overlook chia, a quite small, straight, soldier-like, single-stem, blue-button type of flower and seed pot. The plant is usually six to 10 inches tall and produces seeds that are small but of high food value.\n\nAs the season progresses, one of the late patches of color is the strikingly deep yellow blossom of thick bladderpod bushes, which are of very noticeable size and are most common along dry watercourses. This bush has a strong, pungent odor, and it is better that you look at them rather than make a bouquet.\n\nShould the season be wet, there will be extensive patches of lupine, with its purple blossoms, said to be poisonous to livestock, but the flowers make a bright show and last for many days.\n\nThere are very small, inconspicuous flowers clinging close to the earth called Nama Demissum [purplemat], which grow in very flat, small clusters. The color is a bright, attractive pink.\n\nAmong the larger-growing things to have flowers, you will notice the screw bean mesquite, mountain cat claw, wild tobacco plant, and honey mesquite. In favored places, you can observe the Spanish dagger, yucca, and nolina, which attain a height of 8 feet.\n\nIf you enjoy flowers and the out of doors, then pull on heavy shoes for short hikes away from the village or your parked automobile. Get out into the desert, kick around in the sand. Examine how desert plants live in a land of little rain. You will be inspired with a new appreciation of the real desert, learn much of interest, find beauty in many things you never can see while sitting on a cushion in an automobile traveling at 45 or more miles per hour, and you also will attain peace of mind.\n\nCabot Yerxa clearly possessed an uncommon mastery of plant identification. You might want to look up in a book or on the internet what some of the above look like. Knowing the names of what you see may bring an extra thrill of discovery, but most certainly isn’t necessary to enjoy their beauty. If this spring fails to yield a spectacular show, we can always look forward to next spring. Patience is becoming one of our virtues.\n\nIn 1886, when Cabot Yerxa was 3 years old, his parents, Fred and Nellie, moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, from the Dakota Territory (the Dakotas were not admitted to the Union until 1889). Fred Yerxa joined two older brothers in opening and operating grocery stores for some 15 years after that. Ads and newspaper articles around the turn of the century reveal much about the times and their business operations.\n\nLet’s start with an ad in the July 3, 1896, edition of The St. Paul Globe for the grand opening of a Yerxa store in St. Paul.\n\nThe finest Grocery Store in the United States! The brightest, cleanest, and most attractive Meat Market in the Twin Cities. We will give Grand Opening Prices that will annoy all competitors, but will please the Buyers with Cash. We are the Price Makers in this city and will continue to be.\n\nBelow the introductory paragraph were listed prices for certain goods, including the following:\n\n1 cent per loaf (full weight 16 oz.) for best Vienna bread. Baked by ourselves in our own oven, by first-class union workmen.\n\n16 cents per pound for Yerxa’s extra creamery butter. Positively the best ever offered for sale. This quality is well worth 20 cents.\n\n8 cents per dozen for strictly fresh eggs. (Every egg guaranteed.)\n\nAn 1889 ad in the same newspaper, announcing the grand opening of another St. Paul store, featured the name Yerxa repeated line over line all the way down the left side of the column. Words to the right included the following:\n\nWe shall throw open to the public what others tell us will be the handsomest Grocery Establishment in the West, if not in America. We have spared neither pains or money to make it what “others tell us.” The goods we shall display are what they will always be — new, bright, and clean. We have exercised our best judgment in engaging first-class attendants and invite complaints of shortcomings to the counting room. We make all wrongs right. The modest prices we shall ask for groceries are not thrown out as a “bait” for the “opening.” They will prevail.\n\nAfter noting that all sales are cash only (“hence our ability to sell cheap”), the following enticement was offered:\n\nAt our opening, we shall present to every purchaser a handsome bon-bon of selected candies. They will be found pure, toothsome, and wholesome. We extend to the housekeepers of St. Paul a cordial invitation to visit us, look over our wares, our prices, and then count their possible gains by so doing.\n\nThe Yerxas touted their in-house capabilities, including the manufacturing of candy and “delightful all-Havana tobacco cigars, made before your eyes in our Cigar Department.” The March 5, 1899, issue of The St. Paul Globe published an article with a photo of a coffee roaster at a Yerxa store under the header “Improvement in Roasting Coffee. A Machine at Yerxa’s That Would Be a Revelation to Our Grandmothers.” And the following editorial copy appeared in The Minneapolis Journal on May 17, 1901:\n\nMinneapolis Women: Why Baking Day in Summer Is No More Dreaded by Them.\n\nWarm weather months bring a large increase in the sale of bakery products. Minneapolis women procure the bread and pastry supplies of their table in an easier and more economical way than by tempting the torrid blasts of the oven on a warm day. The proof of the pudding is the eating. Yerxa’s immense sales of bakery goods are the proof.\n\nNone but the most competent and careful help is employed in Yerxa’s bakery. Yerxa’s patrons are supplied with the very finest of bakery goods at a very reasonable cost. The plum pound cake, the German pound cake, and gold cake, light, easy to digest, and of very fine grain, are favorites. The sunshine cake and sponge cake are very popular. Yerxa birthday cake, ladyfingers, plum, almond and cocoanut macaroons have gained a wonderful and deserving sale.\n\nThe Yerxa bakery supplies any item in the entire line and guarantees absolute satisfaction. One thing appreciated by the ladies is the placing on sale of warm biscuit between 4 and 6 in the afternoon. Orders for parties are booked in advance. Many Minneapolis hostesses accord the Yerxa bakery enthusiastic praise.\n\nThough you may long for the days when you could buy a loaf of fresh Vienna bread for a penny and a dozen “guaranteed” eggs for a nickel and three pennies, take heart in the fact that newspapers no longer can get away with unconscionable sexism. What strikes us as amusing is that, although The Minneapolis Journal aimed its oven-mitt rhetoric solely at women, a photo of the Yerxa bakery reveals it was manned by, well, men (indeed, according to the 1896 ad, “first-class union workmen”). Also, check out the left side of the bakery photo. We imagine today’s health inspectors would frown on the presence of a cat on a stool in a bakery. Ah, yes, times have changed — and, ahem, Minnesota no longer is considered to be the country’s “West.”\n\nGiven his connection to nature and his extensive exposure to other cultures, including time living among Native Americans in Alaska and the desert, it’s no surprise that Cabot Yerxa developed an open mind about spirituality and “alternate” systems of belief. He explored automatic writing (a method of “turning off” the conscious mind while the hand writes) and was a follower of Theosophy. Portia Fearis Graham studied astrology and metaphysics and carved out a career giving lectures on “face reading.” After they wed, Cabot built a meditation room for Portia on the upper level of their pueblo home. When flying-saucermania swept America in the 1950s, Cabot and Portia, figuratively speaking, went along for the ride.\n\nIn her book Flying Saucers and Cities of Gold: Cabot Yerxa and the Contactee Movement of the Mojave Desert, former pueblo museum board member Jane Pojawa identified two men with whom Cabot and Portia became friends. George Adamski, a teacher of mysticism who lived in Desert Center, claimed to have visited Mars, Venus, and Saturn — and that Venusians aboard a flying saucer visited him in the desert. George Van Tassel claimed to have received a channeled message from Venus suggesting he build “a receptivity” allowing Venusians to communicate with Earthlings their concern over the development of hydrogen bombs. Van Tassel responded by building The Integraton sound chamber in Landers, not far from Giant Rock, where he led meditation sessions.\n\nThe Yerxas’ friendships with the two Georges appear to have begun after Portia went with three other women on January 5, 1950, to hear Adamski speak in Banning. The following year, Hollywood released the now-classic, visiting spaceship-themed The Day the Earth Stood Still. But the desert’s notable saucerian year was 1953.\n\nOn April 4, 1953, Van Tassel hosted his first Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention at Giant Rock (above photo of Portia, at left). A little more than four months later, on August 24, Van Tassel allegedly was visited by a space being. In her book, Jane quotes Van Tassel’s account:\n\nFrom the position of the full moon, I judged it to be about 2 a.m. On the desert here it is nearly as bright in full moonlight as it is in daylight. I awakened, not knowing why, but sensing that something had disturbed me. We sleep outside about eight months out of the year, so you can see that our bedroom is readily accessible. … I asked the man what he wanted, thinking his car might have given him trouble and he walked into our remote field as many others have done. … Beyond the man, about a hundred yards away, hovered a glittering, glowing ship, around 8 feet off the ground. The man said, “My name is Solgonda. I would be pleased to show you our craft.”\n\nAdamski not only was one of the featured speakers at Van Tassel’s 1953 convention, but also, Jane writes, “published the first ‘nonfiction’ narrative of contact with a man from a spaceship.” With co-author Desmond Leslie, Adamski wrote the book Flying Saucers Have Landed.\n\nThe October 29, 1953, edition of Desert Sentinel newspaper reported the following under the headline “Flying Saucers Near Our Village”:\n\nProfessor George Adamski, who is a friend of Cabot and Portia Yerxa, claims he has taken photos of flying saucers and had an hour talk with a small man who came and left in an outer spaceship from the sky. … Yerxa believes Professor Adamski knows more about flying saucers than any man in America.\n\nThe article notes that Cabot’s Pueblo Museum was selling Leslie and Adamski’s book, but fails to explain why Cabot may have had the expertise to assess the professor as the nation’s most informed individual on flying saucers. Perhaps tellingly, the article does not quote Cabot. But we know from extensive coverage by the newspaper on him and his pueblo that its editor believed the Desert Hot Springs pioneer’s opinions held sway.\n\nWhen the Desert Sentinel reported in its September 23, 1954, edition on the return of Cabot and Portia from a vacation trip of several weeks (“Yerxas Come Home”), it included the following highlight:\n\nThe first of August, they attended the “Flying Saucer” forum on Mount Palomar and talked with George Adamski, who contacted the flying saucer at Desert Center [and] Truman Hothrum, who is the man who talked with the beautiful woman captain and her crew of 32 men, who flew their flying saucer here from the planet Clarion. Also they spent some time with Dan Fry, who boarded a flying saucer and was given a ride of 4,000 miles in 30 minutes, and Desmond Leslie of England, a nephew of Winston Churchill, who told them of very astonishing facts concerning flying saucers in Europe.”\n\nShortly after that article, Jane writes, Desert Hot Springs presented a UFO-themed fundraiser:\n\nOn Oct. 7, 1954, Cabot introduced Gilbert N. Holloway, whose speech “Flying Saucer Mysteries: Truths and Fallacies Concerning Their Origin and Effect on the World” raised $92 for “new and large highway signs to attract more visitors to our community.” Gilbert Holloway was well known to the Yerxas. His father was the president of the chamber of commerce, and Cabot and Portia owned a couple of the younger Holloway’s self-published, metaphysical books, including Dawn is Coming: Thoughts for the New Age.\n\nPutting all of the above into context, it is worth noting the last sentence of the Desert Sentinel’s article on Cabot and Portia’s return from vacation:\n\nBut they say that DHS is the finest place in the world to live, which can be proven by travel to other places.\n\nIt’s fun to speculate what beings from other planets may have thought of Cabot and Portia had they encountered them — and vice versa. One suspects there would have been admirable respect. That said, none of the foregoing represents an attempt to sway anyone’s opinion on the existence or nonexistence of life forms from other planets, but simply to suggest that, because there is so much that we don’t know, there should be space in every mind to accommodate all beliefs that do not infringe on the safety and rights of others.\n\nOur gratitude goes out to Jane Pojawa for granting us permission to use material and quote from her book in addition to culling from museum archives.\n\nIn last week’s newsletter, we recounted some of Bob Forester’s memories of spending time, as a young boy, with Cabot Yerxa. What we held back for this week was his recollection that Cabot sometimes read to him from a monthly publication by another self-proclaimed desert rat. Harry Oliver was an Oscar-nominated art director in Hollywood, architect of everything from an adobe house for himself to the storybook design for Van de Kamp’s original windmill bakery restaurant on a studio lot, and then a desert settler/humorist writer. Oliver moved to Thousand Palms in 1941 and in 1946 and 1947 designed and supervised the Arabian Nights Stage for the National Date Festival fairgrounds in Indio. Meanwhile, he produced the Desert Rat Scrap Book. “Cabot would read the stories to me and then explain what parts were true and which of the many parts were, well, less true,” Forester recalled. “They were always fun to hear, and Cabot had a knack for reading them.”\n\nThe December 6, 1951, edition of The Desert Sentinel reported that Oliver was a “prominent” guest at the opening of Cabot’s Indian Pueblo. “If you really want to be a desert rat, this is a great place to take lesson No. 1,” Oliver was quoted as saying. The following excerpts come from an earlier Sentinel article (August 29, 1946).\n\nSeveral months ago, Harry Oliver, famous desert rat of Thousand Palms instigated a movement that would split the desert areas of Riverside County into a county of its own, which would be called “Desert County.”\n\nAccording to Oliver, the proposed line for California’s 50th county would lay due north from the peak of Santa Rosa Mountain and would include all the desert areas south of that point. He proposed Desert Center, which is midway between the Coachella Valley and Palo Verde Valley, for the seat of the new county.\n\nOliver even went as far as designing a flag for his new county: a sturdy green cactus on a field of white with the name Desert County in sand-colored letters.\n\nWhen asked why he did it, the old desert rat replied, “My little Desert Rat Scrap Book got back to New York and someone on the New York Sunday News giving it a write-up called Thousand Palms a tiny outpost in Riverside County, California. There are 16 of us here in Thousand Palms, four with whiskers. Anyway, the good people in New York would bear down on their pens to make Riverside County show up, and it made me mad and ashamed.\n\nThe other day in Riverside he said, “I’m going to concentrate on changing the name of Riverside County to Desert County. Riverside County is meaningless to thousands of tourists who bask in the desert sun at Desert Hot Springs, Indio, Palm Springs, Coachella, Desert Center, and on through to Blythe. So far as tourists are concerned, it might as well be Brookside or Meadowbook County. Examine the map and you will discover there are Riversides in most every state in the union. The desert has romance, lure, and fascination.\n\nThose of us who live in Riverside County’s riverless desert should at least be able to appreciate Harry Oliver’s proposal. Why should we accept everything that has been established? So let’s all keep ideas coming, because that’s what energizes societies. And even if our ideas don’t gain traction (like Harry’s), that doesn’t mean they don’t bear merit. (Psst, if you want to take up an effort to change our county’s name, let us know, wink wink.)\n\nWhile much of what we know about Cabot Yerxa comes from his own writings and newspaper/magazine articles, we also are fortunate to have reminiscences from people who knew him. Members of the pueblo museum’s history committee spent years conducting research, including interviews and correspondence, to formulate a more comprehensive profile of Cabot. One of their contacts was Bob Forester, who grew up in Desert Hot Springs and met Cabot in 1962. Bob was 5 years old when his mother was looking for a nearby place for her son to spend time while she volunteered at Angel View Crippled Children’s Foundation.\n\nAs we walked across the courtyard up to the pueblo, I was in awe — so much to take in all at once. We went up to the front door and rang the old bell. The door opened and there stood Cabot, who welcomed us in. We met Portia, his lovely wife. She was a short woman with very soft-looking skin and the smile of a gentle grandmother. We had not been there very long before Cabot and I were talking about his house and how much fun I thought it must be to live in a house like that.\n\nAfter that first meeting, Bob spent a few hours with Cabot on days his mother worked at Angel View.\n\nCabot talked of coming to the desert — how the town of Palm Springs was too crowded for him, how his burros had saved his life when returning from getting water at the old Garnet railroad station on a very windy day. He talked about how the pueblo was built. He said there was still work to do but that chatting with me on the front porch was more fun for him that day. He asked me if I liked to draw or paint and, of course, it was so he could talk about how the colors of things would change as the sun moved and how shadows changed the look of things, how the sky was never just blue or mountains just brown. I never looked at anything the same again. We sometimes would walk around the property and he would tell me about the plants and the reptiles we came across. Cabot told me he could never get some people to stop touching cactus. He always kept a roll of tape and tweezers to assist removing the spines from their fingers.\n\nDuring his tours or just talking to me, he never made the focus about just himself but about the people he had met, their lives, and how the desert was when he first came. He told me once that people see what they want or what is obvious to them first. He said when asked about the desert, most people would say there is nothing much out there.\n\nCabot was teaching me to be resourceful, creative, and not wasteful of anything. At that age, I was learning to spell, read, and add. I later figured out that Cabot was teaching me to think outside the box. Thanks to him, the desert became my playground and one big, seemingly endless adventure.\n\nHe spoke of how Native people treated each other and took care of kids and cared for their elderly, how strong their belief was in the natural world around them. I never read a history book in school that talked about Native Americans as real people.\n\nCabot was not wealthy, but he was a rich man to be able to talk about his life adventures and all the people with whom he had interacted. He was very good to me and always asked what I thought about things and did I understand what he had said about something, lastly did I have any questions.\n\nMostly I remember the man, how he spoke, the look in his eyes, the passion he had about history and people he knew. Portia was a small, gentle woman who was kind to me, but I did not spend much time with. Mainly I remember she would bring us cookies and water to enjoy.\n\nWhen Bob began school and his mother had less time to volunteer, he visited Cabot and Portia less frequently.\n\nWhen Cabot died in 1965, I had not been to see him for several months. I assumed, as a kid at the time, that he would always be there.\n\nOne of the last things Cabot taught me was the handshake. He asked me what I thought history was. My answer was simply things from long, long ago that no longer mattered because everyone was dead. With that, Cabot put out his hand and told me to shake it firmly, so I did. “Now,” he said, “the importance of a handshake is to remember that history and the people we talk about in history are no more than a handshake away. When you shook my hand, you shook a hand that shook the hand of people who helped shape the world we live in today. They are as close to us as a handshake from another person.” This lesson has stayed with me, and I continue to use it when someone says, “That was 100 years ago and does not matter today.” It does!\n\nAlthough handshakes are verboten in these pandemic times, Cabot’s concept of connection holds true and remains relevant. History matters, because it is filled with people whose thoughts and actions have, as he said, shaped our world. Recognizing this fact behooves us to also realize the opportunities we have to make a positive impact on those who live beyond us in time.\n\nIn a circa-1950 photograph, Cabot Yerxa sits on a bench just outside one of his adobe’s many doors. Looking at the desert tortoise in his hands, he appears contemplative. We can’t know what he is thinking at the captured moment in time. But the sign posted on the wall by the door reveals his overall mindset. It reads as follows:\n\nTHERE IS NO PLACE\n\nJUST LIKE THIS PLACE\n\nANYWHERE NEAR THIS PLACE\n\nSO THIS must be THE PLACE\n\nCole Eyraud, who purchased the pueblo in 1969, four years after Cabot’s death, clearly agreed. He spent much time and energy toward securing historical recognition. A letter dated just over two weeks after escrow closed evidences that he had already sought interest from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nThirty-four years ago this month, Desert Hot Springs’ city council designated Cabot’s pueblo museum “an official historical landmark of the city.” Below are the whereases and now therefore of Resolution No. 77-10.\n\nWhereas, Cabot Yerxa was a pioneer in the development of the Coachella Valley and became an integral part of the living history of the City of Desert Hot Springs by his discovery of the City’s natural hot water on Miracle Hill, which led to the continuing economic stability of the community; and\n\nWhereas, the City was fortunate to have Cabot Yerxa settle in the community, to bring forth his love and faith for our desert area by being one of the first founders and first president of the Desert Hot Springs Improvement Association; and\n\nWhereas, Cabot Yerxa felt the overpowering, driving need to preserve for posterity, for all to see and appreciate, he labored for 24 years preserving early-day Indian relics and hand constructed, with a labor of love and dedication, a replica of an adobe Indian pueblo; and\n\nWhereas, Cabot’s Old Indian Pueblo is both in architecture and artifact an extremely remarkable feat; and\n\nWhereas, Cabot left this adobe monument for the City of Desert Hot Springs, it is deemed fitting and proper that this area be designated an historical landmark of the City;\n\nNow, therefore, the City Council of the City of Desert Hot Springs does hereby resolve as follows:\n\nSection 1. The Desert Hot Springs City Council does hereby declare and designate Cabot’s Indian Pueblo an official landmark of the City.\n\nSection 2. The City Clerk shall certify to the passage of this Resolution and cause copies thereof to be forwarded to the Riverside County Historical Commission, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, and the Desert Hot Springs Improvement Association.\n\nFour years later, on April 26, 1981, Eyraud hosted a dedication program for County of Riverside Historical Marker No. 054. Unfortunately, neither Cabot nor Eyraud lived to see the day, in 2012, when Cabot’s Pueblo Museum was named to the Registry of National Historic Places. As noteworthy as national designation is, we can’t help but be partial to the City of Desert Hot Springs’ recognition of Cabot’s impact on the city’s future and his passion for cultural posterity.\n\nVisitors to Cabot’s Pueblo Museum can see the City of Desert Hot Springs’ historical landmark honor on a plaque near the grounds’ entrance.\n\nWith our post-Valentine’s-Day brains still processing thoughts of hearts, we step back even further in time to newlywed advice from L.H. Winkley to Cabot Yerxa’s maternal grandparents, Charles and Frances Cabot. The clergyman clearly was a family friend and likely presided over the 1854 wedding, as he did 28 years later for the couple’s daughter Nellie (Cabot’s mother) to Fred Yerxa. Following are excerpts of Winkley’s guidance, which he prefaces by stating it is based on his personal experience in marriage.\n\nI. Lay aside somewhat of your income this first year of your married life. If you can spare one dollar or five at this moment, make a deposit in some savings bank. That you may lay aside more, be not only economical but orderly and neat; for neatness and order are not only comforts in themselves, but save money also.\n\nII. Lay aside all anger and jealousy toward each other. How is neither of you without faults? While you recognize them as uncomfortable, do not fret about them. The more you wish to have them abolished, the more patiently you must bear them and the more good-naturedly and affectionately you must labor to win each other from them. If you have love enough for each other to pursue this course, you may be sure of a very happy union. Just as far as you depart from it, you will find sorrowful hours, if not days.\n\nIII. Be cheerful and hopeful. You will have your share of troubles, for no one escapes them. Because they are sure to come, be ready for them. Meet all the vexations and trials of life, small or great, with a cheerful spirit. Despondency only adds to an evil. Cheerfulness makes prosperity brighter and destroys about one-half of adversity. Let no clouds, then, settle on each other’s brow.\n\nIV. Be intelligent. By this I mean cultivate your minds. Read. Read together. Talk together of what you read. If you have but little time, still read, tho’ you read but five minutes a day. Read stories, only let them be good, if you are too weary to read anything else. You have no idea how much knowledge you will acquire in ten years by a little daily reading. This fullness of thought begets mutual respect and esteem and binds you together more and more firmly.\n\nV. Be good. Not only promote each other’s happiness, but also all others as far as you may. Never do a wrong without mutual confession. Be good toward your relations and friends. Do not mind their faults. Do not talk about them. Rather, cultivate charity for their imperfections and love for their virtues.\n\nAnd now my dear friends, I have said my brief say. It remains with you to profit by it. My long acquaintance with at least one of you deepens my interest in your happiness. I long for you both to have not only a happy new year [the letter is dated January 4], but also a happy lifetime. That you may shall ever be the prayers of\n\nYour affectionate friend, L.H. Winkley\n\nThough offered to newlyweds, L.H. Winkley’s timeless counseling should encourage anyone to think about harmonious living. The problem lies not in the fact that we don’t recognize the high road; it’s that too often we ignore “lane-departure” alerts and drift into a ditch. Self-correction here and there helps everyone traveling life’s highway.\n\nOn the eve of Valentine’s Day, we highlight the bond that made Cabot and Portia the perfect couple to find bliss in a work-in-progress home surrounded by raw desert land. The following excerpts come from an article in a July 1964 issue of The Desert Sun profiling the lady of the house on Miracle Hill, who described meeting Cabot. Portia clearly found amusement in the “new” life she found when she married for the third time in August of 1945 at the age of 61 (Cabot was 62).\n\n“Rattlesnakes?” said Mrs. Cabot Yerxa. “Yes, we find an occasional one here. Not as many as a few years ago, but they still like to curl up on the ladders leading to the fourth story. I will never forget the day about 10 years ago when the Desert Sentinel editor came up to see if we had any news. We were short on furniture then, and she was sitting on a couple of packing boxes that doubled as a chair in the living room. I hear you found a rattlesnake up here the other day,’ she said, ‘I’d love to have a look at it.’ ‘You won’t have to look far,’ I said ‘It’s in that box.’ She screamed once, jumped, and the last Cabot and I saw of her, she was running down the hill as fast as she could go.”\n\nPortia Yerxa sighed. “When I came to Palm Springs to visit 20 years ago from Texas, I never expected to end up living in an Indian pueblo. But the people with whom I was staying were invited to the Desert Inn for dinner, and I was asked to join them. My hostess had told me that she was going to seat me next to the most fascinating bachelor. He turned out to be Cabot and insisted that I later see his castle.”\n\nThe castle was the skeleton structure of a four-story Hopi Indian pueblo.\n\n“‘Marry me, and I’ll finish the pueblo, then take you an a European honeymoon,’ Cabot said. We never have gotten to Europe,” Portia explained. “Cabot says he still has 10 more years to do on the pueblo, although we have already completed 35 rooms, several caves, 65 doors, and 140 windows.”\n\n“When we get tired of living in one part of the house,” she said, “we just move to another. Twenty of the rooms are furnished, and we clean them as we need them. Actually, we move up and down with the seasons. In the winter, our second-floor apartment is warmer. In the summer, it’s cooler on the ground floor. The east wall of the house is built right up against a mountain, so Cabot dug a little cave, just big enough to hold a cot, and that’s where he sleeps during the summer.\n\n“I’ve grown accustomed to having snake skins instead of pictures on the walls,” she said, “and I don’t mind if Indian relics are strewn all over the place.”\n\nThen Portia, who is a petite five feet, paused. “But there’s one question I do wish tourists would stop asking. After Cabot shows them the 60-pound bricks he uses to build the pueblo, they always want to know if I carry the bricks.”\n\nOutside the living room is a hot-water well dug by Cabot that brings in water at 126 degrees. An electric pump carries the water to a 1,200-gallon reservoir on top of the mountain above the house. Gravity pulls the water down, and it is piped throughout the pueblo.\n\n“Although the pueblo will never be finished,’’ Portia said, with a gentle smile on her lips, “I’d never live anywhere else.”\n\nCabot and Portia loved each other and each loved the desert. If you find happiness with someone special, tell them so this Valentine’s Day. Then again, why wait for tomorrow? Nothing says you can’t repeat yourself … often. So take this to heart: The board and staff of Cabot’s Pueblo Museum find happiness with its special members and other supporters.\n\nBSM, Before Social Media, people got their news from printed paper. They stepped outside, perhaps with morning coffee in hand, to pick up the daily newspaper tossed onto their porch or driveway. Even without platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, Cabot Yerxa managed to attract the kind of publicity rarely available to a noncelebrity. When he opened his pueblo to the general public in 1951, Desert Sentinel newspaper ran a piece titled “Cabot’s Pueblo Brings World to DHS.” Below are excerpts from that December 6 article.\n\nSparkplugged by the wonderful publicity given Cabot’s old Indian Pueblo in the Daily Enterprise and also the Press of Riverside, the preopening was an outstanding success. In only 2 days, 400 who would never otherwise have known what our health city has to offer came, saw, and were impressed both by our Village and its prodigious growth and the unique Indian pueblo, 10 years in the building.\n\nIn order that all in the Village may familiarize themselves with this project, a price of 35c for adults, 25c for teenagers, and 5c for children under twelve, is made for conduct over the entire structure, good only on Dec. 11, 12, 13, and 14. A view of the Art Gallery is something no one can afford to miss and alone is worth more than the regular charge of 65c for adults, 30c for teenagers, and 12c for children.\n\nIn all California there is no other building like this. Only the extinct race of Aztecs inspiring it could duplicate its originality and rustic charm. Rising out of the sand like a magician’s handwork, a part of Cabot’s soul is built into its rugged walls and timbers, a creation conceivable only by a great artist.\n\nCabot’s old Indian pueblo will grow in value to the community as time marches on. The historic structure will continue to advertise this region of the desert, bringing in thousands to view its wonders and to remain to benefit not only D.H.S., but also Palm Springs and the entire desert area.\n\nHere are just a few ways Cabot’s old Indian pueblo has forwarded D.H.S.: With advertising from out of town. Mentioned editorially in Riverside Press, almost full page in both Enterprise and Press of Riverside, with wonderful pictures. 29 Palms Desert Trails’ fine story of pueblo. Banning Record story. L.A. Times last week, 3-column story; and a few months ago covered front page of Times with pictures; more newspaper coverage soon. Palm Springs Pictorial, read all year, pictures and story. Feature in KFI, Nelson McIninch’s broadcast; over 5 million people in national broadcast over KFI in Ben Hunter’s “People and the News” at 9:45 p.m. last Monday featuring artist Cabot Yerxa and old Pueblo at D.H.S.\n\nAs predicted in the Desert Sentinel article, Cabot’s most unusual creation continued to attract publicity, extending to national publications. After Cabot’s death, Cole Eyraud not only purchased the property to preserve the pioneer’s legacy, but also pursued media outlets and the attention of officials to raise the pueblo’s public and historical recognition. Magazines, particularly those with a focus on travel and tourism, found their hosts charming and the hand-built construction awe-inspiring. In keeping with the times, Cabot’s Pueblo Museum now maintains a social-media presence on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nOn the heels of this week’s winter rains, we look back to Cabot Yerxa’s impressions of days when clouds slipped past the protection of local mountains and watered the typically arid landscape. The following excerpts, dating back to 1954, come from the museum’s book titled On the Desert Since 1913.\n\nYesterday it rained for the first time in nine or 10 months, and the desert was drenched. Just a steady, slow rain without any blustering wind. The sandy soil absorbed the welcome moisture completely. The greasewood bushes opened their leaves, which are folded close together for protection during dry weather; and the damp air was full of their clean, haunting fragrance. All the sparse desert growth of bunch grass and small plants, usually quite brittle, were as limp and soft as though made of pretty colored rubber.\n\nThe few birds and small animal life scurried for their own type of shelter. A half-dozen song sparrows chirped at me from under a palm ramada. The lone shrike sat bedraggled on his usual perch in the rustic building we call Indian Camp. Lizards got under boards or rocks and shivered the time away as best they could. The eagle took to the high mountain crags and the security of big timber. The owls, no doubt, went to the protection of the Two Bunch Palms, as I have seen them do in other spells of bad weather. Rabbits hunt a depression under roots or sit in silent discomfort about half below the surface of the ground, but hunched up on their strong hind legs, ready to spring into immediate action at any unknown sound approaching. The coyotes slink around with wet feet, fur dripping with rain and drooping tails.\n\nOverhead, one solitary goose flies strongly with head and neck outstretched through the murky rain. He was headed as straight for Mexico and warmer weather, as an aviator could with a compass. The goose was flying low and honking very mournfully; and I heard him minutes after he was lost to vision. His heart was troubled because of separation from his flock.\n\nHere Cabot describes a sustained soaking of the desert floor:\n\nIf the winter season is normal, we have a three-day rain during the middle of January. At such times, the desert changes much in appearance. The barrel cactus gets very red in color because of the thorough washing. Cholla cactus becomes bright yellow; beavertail and deer-horn show up suddenly green. Greasewood branches and most small brush appear to be nearly black. Indigo bushes, burro sage, and others of similar types are strongly contrasting grays.\n\nThere is also a difference underfoot. Scattered bits of brush that litter the desert floor do not crackle and snap when you walk, as they do in dry weather. When you step on small rocks after the rains, they sink into the wet earth; and there is no sound of crunching as formerly.\n\nThe January storm gathers slowly. First a soft, moisture-laden wind comes up from the southeast. Clouds drift into the valley. Wet mist forms, followed by slight showers. This is the first day and night. During the second, steady rain falls, soaking the ground. Thick, low-lying clouds completely blot out surrounding mountains. You and your cabin are alone in an unfamiliar world. There is a complete hush of all sound. The pale, bluish smoke from the chimney hangs close to the cabin roof, as though reluctant to leave. Water falls freely from the wet shingles, and the smell of wet wood is strongly noticeable.\n\nDuring the third day, precipitation tapers off to many short, intermittent showers. Patches of thick, small clouds hang only a short distance above the ground and drift very lazily along the lower foothills. All vegetation is dripping with raindrops. Pungent odors of greasewood, sage, croton, indigo bush, and other plants fill the air. It’s a joy to be alive and a privilege to breathe deeply.\n\nAs desert residents, we may find ourselves running to the window or door when water falls from the sky. Some of us even might have called a distant relative to report the past week’s graupel (so unusual that the local weather forecaster took time to explain what it was). One of the pleasures of living in the Coachella Valley is finding precipitation interesting. But how many of us notice as much about it as Cabot Yerxa did? Maybe a post-shower walk is in order — or at least a deep inhalation of the scented air it leaves behind — to share his appreciation for a good soaking.\n\nCabot Yerxa typically ended his written communications “Adios.” His use of the Spanish word conveys not only his appreciation for other cultures, but also seems jauntier than “Farewell.” After his second viewing of the 1931 movie Trader Horn (about an African adventurer who “at the end says ‘goodbye’ to comrades”), Cabot collected his memories of partings. “When I pick up and leave the desert, I am sad for days,” he wrote. “I never have left a ship without regret, and goodness knows. I have been on over a hundred. And a city in which I have lived I am loathe to leave.” Below are some of the occasions Cabot recalled. “I can sit down and think of ‘goodbyes’ that open a place in my heart large enough to put in the Pacific Electric building and room to spare,” he wrote.\n\nI remember Alaska slipping back into the horizon and a school of whales lazily spouting water as clouds close in and cover the sun low in the west, and I shed tears.\n\n* * *\n\nI took the burro 11 miles to T+K Ranch, and I can still see it looking at me over the gate and hear its peculiar screaming cry whenever I left it. It could not follow me again in the canyon. I heard the cry, and I hear it yet.\n\n* * *\n\nAmong the hundreds of hands and handkerchiefs waved as the train pulls out, I look and see one tiny bit of white waving. And I know that handkerchief waves for me with all the good luck possible from one to another.\n\n* * *\n\nI have got my discharge from the Army. As I take my place in the train, I see the men falling in for the flag ceremonies at the end of the day, and I have pangs of regret at departure.\n\n* * *\n\nI have sold a baby burro and, with the help of trainmen, have loaded it in the express car. The way it looked at me I would give the money back and take again the burro. But the train is moving away. And so we only have things to love and to give them up again. Sometimes I wonder: Does it pay to form attachments? Is it worthwhile to hold or cherish anything?\n\n* * *\n\nIn the Seattle shipyards was that hard, bitter, burley, rough, big Scotsman. He was an expert ship machinist of the old school. I dragged his tools around engines, up and down ladders, and together we worked in the most impossible places: inside boilers, on planks swung by ropes, walking on steel eye beams, dodging hot rivets and moving cranes. He had about as much sentiment as a blacksmith’s anvil in a snowstorm. And yet, when I told him I had volunteered for the Army and shook hands goodbye, tears came to the old devil’s eyes and he said, “Lad, I have been a machinist all my life. I have had helpers following me around all these years and know an endless number of men. But I have never become as attached to a man as I have to you. You are doing a fine thing to volunteer. That’s a tough fight over there, and perhaps you won’t get back. Me and the old woman never had no boys, and so you can be our son in the war. Me and the old woman will pray for you, lad, as long as the war lasts. Now goodbye and may God bless you.” Tears ran down his cheeks through the grease and grime as he climbed an iron ladder into a maze of steel girders and engines under construction. And I was on my way into the Army.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is almost dark and I go into the art school alone to get a forgotten article. The men have gone. The room smells of paint. Dim portraits gaze at me from many easels. The eyes of each seem reproachful and sad and seem to follow my every move. I stumble out the long, dark passage to the street with reluctant steps and eyes blurred.\n\n* * *\n\nBlue eyes and golden hair she had. Quick smiles. A perfect storm of protest or ever-increasing, bubbling interest and enthusiasm. Never quiet. Never two days alike — nor two minutes for that matter. Restless change and vivacity. She kissed me goodbye with a little eager rush, turned on her heels, and was lost in the crowd like a breath of wind.\n\n* * *\n\nA group of Eskimos had gathered to shake my hand for the last time — friends every one. We parted — they north and I south. We waved and shouted “al-le-on-nomayuk.” Again and again we waved and shouted the goodbye of Alaska. The time, the place, the peculiar lonesome chill of the north, the bareness of the country all worked on my heartstrings. And the last time I shouted before it was too far to hear, I added “na-na-co wonga itlee-ok-toonga”: “Someday I will be coming back again.” I wonder if I will.\n\nAs Cabot paused for reflection on the goodbyes in his life, he countered them with his philosophy on hellos.\n\nBut then there are sunrises. Familiar scenes that reappear, eyes that welcome, hands with a grasp of loyalty, and those who love us (few through they be).\n\nAnd always is the charm of new places, the excitement of new surroundings, the knowing of what lies on the other side of the hill, the interest of searching new faces for possible friends, the novelty of strange food, the pleasure of strange experiences, and the everlasting freedom of being able to proceed without criticism or claims of routine. So a rolling stone has his ups and downs, his rewards and punishments. Life is only an experience, and we only experience that which we are capable of seeing.\n\nAs poignant and shaded with sadness as goodbyes often are, we should not shy away from thinking about the people, animals, and places that have shaped who we are but from whom we are separated. As long as they remain in our hearts, they are not lost to us. As for Cabot’s one-time question, “Is it worthwhile to hold or cherish anything?” he clearly concluded that it is.\n\nIn last week’s newsletter, we published excerpts from Hearst Newspapers syndicated columnist Louis Sobol’s “New York Cavalcade” column, which was primarily devoted to Broadway show business news and gossip but also included communications he had with Cabot Yerxa on life in the desert. The following comes from Sobol’s “American Cavacade,” published in the February 13, 1939, edition of San Francisco Examiner and relating his visit to the B-Bar-H Ranch near Cabot’s homestead.\n\nWe arrived in time to witness a desert phenomenon — snow on the mesquite. Not in seventy years had the beautiful white fallen in this region, they solemnly assured us — and some of the old-timers pointed with awe to what looked in the greyness of the day like a chinchilla wrapping on stately San Jacinto, rambling San Bernardino range, and the Gorgonios. Snow on the peaks was nothing unusual, but never had it mantled down so low. And as for this blizzard where there should have been hot sun, not only was it cause for wonderment, but also for considerable distress among the innkeepers. Let me hasten to add, however, that as these words tumble out of the typewriter, the sun is high and hot in the skies — the blessed windbreak of tamaracks sway only gently — and Mike, the four-month-old cocker spaniel of the ranch, is trying to catch up with a frolicsome bird.\n\nThere is laziness in the air. Walt Disney, who has just left, was finally persuaded to mount a horse. But aside from that, the order of the day is complete inactivity.\n\nThe desert abounds in colorful characters. Today I drove over to a windy, sandy ribbon of road to Cabot Yerxa’s place. Cabot, a mild-mannered fellow of about 50, lives here with his white-haired mother in serene aloofness from what we call the outer world.\n\nMother Yerxa proudly escorted us into her kitchen and started pumping water. I tasted it — and then I knew the reason for her pride. It was boiling hot — for that is how it comes out of the ground.\n\nCabot, a talented artist who studied both in Paris and in Berlin, has many of his prize paintings hung around the walls. But his chief wall decorations are newspaper matrices — dating back twenty-five or more years, when he first came to the desert after having hermited for a spell in Alaska. He is not averse to selling his art nor to selling anything, for he has a little store outside in which a few sundries are on display. Unfortunately, few people drift up his way, except a casual guest from a ranch wandering by accidentally on horseback.\n\nYet this desert recluse has great visions of a day when all the world will come flocking to these magnificent outdoors, retain health from these unpublicized magic waters, and drink in the hot sun. I had an idea, though, from his conversation that when, or if, that day comes, Cabot and his aged mama will pack up — seek other isolations where he may paint to his heart’s content, dig around for rare stone specimens, and at night sit under the mellow desert moon and dream in peace.\n\nInteresting personalities, too, are Charles and Paul Bender, who own this B-Bar-H Ranch in partnership with producer Lucien Hubbard.\n\nSobol mentions the names of B-Bar-H past guests, including Hollywood’s Joan Crawford, the Marx brothers, Tyrone Power, Darryl Zanuck, Marlene Dietrich, Robert Taylor, and Eleanor Powell.\n\nAs this is being written, the station wagon is starting off to fetch half a dozen Easterners, among whom are playwright Moss Hart. The talented Beatrice Kaufman [a New York editor, writer, and wife of playwright George S. Kaufman] is also scheduled to be a guest.\n\nI have already been initiated into the Order of Pamperers, founded here a season or so ago by publisher M. Lincoln Schuster. The code of the Pamperer is, “Never do today what can be done tomorrow.” And the favorite byword is, “Well, give me until tomorrow and I’ll give you a definite ‘Maybe.’”\n\nThere’s a lot to be said for heeding Benjamin Franklin’s sage advice: Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today. And yet we can see wisdom in occasionally following the Order of the Pamperers’ clashing credo. Perhaps the wisest course, in the interest of avoiding stress, is a balance between the two: making an effort to accomplish tasks but recognizing when it’s time to stop and relax — and take in the beauty of our surroundings.\n\nImage courtesy of Desert Hot Springs Historical Society.\n\nAlthough Cabot Yerxa wed his second wife on August 8, 1945, the occasion was announced nationally in the January 2, 1946, edition of New York Journal-American. For two or three years, Cabot wrote a monthly letter to Hearst Newspapers columnist Louis Sobol about life in the desert. Sobol often used them in his “New York Cavalcade” column, which otherwise was devoted to Broadway show business. Below are excerpts of Sobol’s “A Hermit Weds!”\n\nAnd now, dear friends, to start off the New Year, would you like to get away from gay Manhattan and effervescent Broadway to read a little bit of gossip? Remember my pal Cabot Yerxa, the hermit of the desert out Garnet, California, way? Well, he’s gone off and married a lovely lady named Portia Graham. Yep, the hermit who shunned all society is now hooked by a beauteous belle from the West — and heed well what he writes:\n\n“Now the cabin is swept, the table dusted, and I have washed all the windows. The lady’s name is Portia, and she is from an aristocratic family in Texas. She never saw a desert before, nor imagined people could live with the water all carried home in tin cans. And be happy without radio, newspapers, or neighbors.\n\n“I used to use goat sacks for pillowslips, but now they are slips from the effete city, all white and ironed. The towels have colored designs and decorations and look so clean and useless that not yet have I used them. The goat sacks seem more practical.\n\n“I am building a new trading post and art gallery and studio in which to paint pictures. The new cabin will be built of stone and adobe bricks on the edge of a small gulch and dug back into the mountain so that one wall will be all rocks without doors or windows. To you Easterners who travel comfortably over the Southwest in trains or autos, rocks are just rocks. But if you live with them in close proximity, they have differences. For years, I have been collecting rocks for the new building. There will be black, grey, blue, dull red, and some that sparkle with mica flakes to give the appearance of golden particles.\n\n“One room has five corners and only one is square. Windows are on different levels and vary in size. It is necessary to step up or down between different rooms. There is no blueprint of the building, because I just construct one room at a time and make it fit the mountainside and be useful and practical for its purpose.\n\n“The goats, chickens, desert turtles, chuckwallas, rattlesnakes, and other pets will all have new homes suitable to their needs. Portia does not seem to be very enthusiastic about the rattlesnakes as pets. This matter has not been fully decided yet.\n\n“Any married man will understand that some matters of family importance are not decided on the spot. Any delay usually means that his wife has won the day, and postponement is to assuage the male ego for having lost the battle. So it may be that someday I will gather my good friends, the snakes, and we shall make a sorrowful journey to a deserted part of the desert where I shall turn them loose and we will bid adieu, affectionately, to each other — and regretfully.”\n\nGood luck to you, my desert friend — good luck to you and your bride. And say, bud, if ever you decide to sneak away from the quiet and serenity of the desert to mingle with us folks out here on Broadway, "
