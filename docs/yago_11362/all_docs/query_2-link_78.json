        "text": "When I was a kid the holiday television schedules invariably included a Disney Time programme consisting of a dozen or so clips from well-known Disney classics together with linking introductions by a celebrity guest. Of course there was no story or continuity across the hour, but it was a cheerful enough way of filling the time at Easter or Christmas.\n\nI was reminded of this while watching Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, which is not a Disney film itself but instead made by Walden Media which specialises in producing appropriately Christian fare for all the family. That’s because the film itself consists of perfectly fine and even satisfyingly entertaining individual sequences, but lacks any sense of anything deeper. Like, overarching plot or character to link the sequences together in any meaningful manner.\n\nThe other week I described Sahara as having “no heft to it. It’s just an old style action romp, fun and spectacular – nothing more,” but Journey 2 makes Sahara feel like Dostoevsky by comparison. This film’s synopsis is simple: Sean and his stepfather solve a code that leads them to rediscover a long-lost South Pacific island. They find it, crash on it, discover that the island is about to sink in just a few hours (what an amazing coincidence …) and have to find a way to escape.\n\nActually, that’s not a synopsis so much as the entire detailed script breakdown; I feel I should apologise for the massive spoilers already, such as the film has anything to “spoiler”. It feels as though the film has outsourced any further script issues to Jules Verne’s original 1874 novel The Mysterious Island that absolutely none of the target demographic will have read, but which the makers of the film seem to think gives them a free pass so that they don’t have to bother to explain who or what “Atlantis”, “Nemo” or “Nautilus” are.\n\nAmazingly the film consists of only six named roles, and there are no bad guys or foes – just a little mild-mannered teen resentment between Sean and his stepdad. Sean also gets a holiday romance with the daughter of their helicopter pilot, but don’t worry – it’s all very sweet and innocent and even the holding of hands a touch risqué for this movie. It’s so clear that everything’s going to turn out well that it’s hard to believe that any but the smallest viewers of this film will ever think there’s any sense of even the mildest peril involved.\n\nAnd yet for all that, it’s reasonably entertaining and diverting – in just the way that Disney Time used to be. It doesn’t overstay its welcome (its running time is supposed to be 94 minutes but it seemed to underrun that by a good 10 minutes when the end credits started to roll) and the individual sequences are sufficiently well done to hold the attention of young children and undemanding older ones. It looks good, the FX are quite beautiful and well-realised, and some of the episodes are quite imaginative such as the passenger flight of the bumblebees. Some sequences that have been clearly inserted purely to exploit the original 3D projection manage to remind you just how obnoxious that technology truly is, however.\n\nThe film’s best asset is its small but personable cast. As the sole holdover from the first Journey film, Josh Hutcherson rides his post-Hunger Games wave of fame to good effect here and brings a big pre-teen following to the box office, but it’s really Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s film as he steps in for the first movie’s Brendan Fraser. Johnson manages to have a surprising amount of personal charm and charisma, and for an action star it’s really his sincere commitment to the authenticity of the moment (whether small domestic moment or combating giant lizards) that makes him head and shoulders above many of the sports-stars-turned-movie-stars.\n\nIt’s also good to see the underrated Luis Guzmán get a decent part rather than a short cameo for once, but really the film is stolen by Michael Caine having a high old time as an eccentric explorer and looking like he’s actually enjoying every minute of it as he jumps around the set like a man no more than two-thirds of his 79 years. Sir Michael will be pretty much the sole point of interest to any adults who happen to be watching, but he just about manages to be worth the price of admission all by himself.\n\nReally, it’s hard to be too nasty about this film. It would be like kicking a sweet, fluffy, empty-headed Labrador puppy – and that’s simply not on. Pat it on the head, tickle its tummy, and send it on its way to a good home – and then forget all about it."
