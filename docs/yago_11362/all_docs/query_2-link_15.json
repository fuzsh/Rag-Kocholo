        "text": "Mysterious Island (UK: Jules Verne's Mysterious Island) is a 1961 science fiction adventure film about prisoners in the American Civil War who escape in a balloon and then find themselves stranded on a remote island populated by giant and tiny animals.\n\nLoosely based upon the 1874 novel The Mysterious Island (L'Île mystérieuse) by Jules Verne (which was the sequel to two other novels by Verne, 1867's In Search of the Castaways and 1870's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), the film was produced by Charles H. Schneer and directed by Cy Endfield.\n\nShot in Catalonia, Spain, and at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, England, the film serves as a showcase for Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation effects. Like several of Harryhausen's classic productions, the musical score was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Another version of the story was produced in 2005.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn 1865, during the American Civil War, a massive storm sweeps through Libby Military Prison in Richmond, Virginia. Union soldiers Cyrus Harding, Herbert Brown and Neb, along with Union war correspondent Gideon Spillet plan an escape via a gas balloon tethered next to the compound. After escaping their cell, they take one of the Confederate guards named Pencroft aboard the balloon after he explains that he knows how to pilot the airship.\n\nThe balloon carries them westwards across the United States, and over the Pacific Ocean. A storm arises, tearing open the balloon and forcing the men to land near the shore of an unknown island. The following morning the men explore the strange island. They discover that the island has lush tropical jungles, harsh plains, and many volcanoes which frequently erupt.\n\nWhen they reach the other side of the island, they encounter a giant crab. After Neb is nearly killed, the castaways are able to push it into a boiling geyser and have crab meat for dinner. Afterwards, the men continue exploring and find a herd of wild goats which they try to catch. Then they find two unconscious English ladies, Lady Mary Fairchild and her niece Elena, who were shipwrecked here by the same storm. Working together, the castaways find cover and protection in a cave which they call \"Granite House\", formerly inhabited by a now deceased castaway named Thomas Ayrton. A treasure chest later washes ashore, and in it the men find a variety of useful items, including rifles, nautical charts, and books such as Robinson Crusoe. Markings upon one of the rifles found in the chest indicate that it came from the Nautilus, upon which Spillet gives Lady Fairchild (who is unfamiliar with the tale) a brief summation of the Nautilus, its creator Captain Nemo, and its supposed destruction off the coast of Mexico some eight years earlier. Spillet expresses a sense of respect and admiration for Nemo's genius and principles against war, while Harding derides him for being a madman and a murderer, condemning him for the deaths of numerous sailors during his crusade. Making use of the charts, the castaways are able to determine their location and proceed with the construction of a boat on which they can escape the island.\n\nWhile Mary and Elena are one day tending to the goats, Spillet encounters a giant flightless bird (a prehistoric species called a Phorusrhacos) while fishing. Spillet and the women retreat into the goat pen, but the bird simply jumps over the fence and assails them. As it tries to eat Elena, Herbert arrives and attacks the creature, knifing it until he apparently kills it. Later, as they consume the bird, they discover it was actually killed by a bullet none of them had fired.\n\nA few weeks later, Herbert and Elena are sunning outside when they notice a rivulet of honey. Atop a rocky bluff, they come across an enormous hive inhabited by giant bees, which attack them. As Herbert and Elena escape from the hive into a large flooded cave, they spot the submarine Nautilus inside. They enter the vessel, but knowing that it belongs to someone else, retreat, swimming out of the cave. Meanwhile, Harding, Spillet, Neb, Mary and Pencroft spot an approaching pirate ship. They try to hide, but are discovered, and a fight with the pirates ensues. The castaways prevail only after an explosion mysteriously sinks the pirate ship with all hands aboard.\n\nOnce outside, the castaways reunite and meet Captain Nemo, who is living aboard his disabled submarine. Nemo has been watching the castaways and secretly assisting them by sending the chest, shooting the giant bird, and sinking the pirate ship. He invites them to dinner aboard the Nautilus, where he tells them that the giant creatures are results of his genetic experiments to enlarge the world's food resources, thereby eliminating hunger and economic competition which he sees as prime causes for the wars he was striving to end all his life. Due to their fortitude, he has selected them to assist him in his efforts to make his achievements known to the world, especially since the Nautilus is incapacitated beyond repair and the volcano will soon erupt, destroying the island.\n\nWhen time runs out, the castaways discover that Nemo has invented an air-filled raising system which can refloat the pirate ship, the only readily seaworthy vessel on this island. Nemo teaches them to breathe underwater using his special \"shell\" air tanks, and they work to raise the ship, despite interference by a giant Ammonite. With the pirate ship raised and seaworthy, the castaways set sail. The volcano erupts and Nemo is killed as the Nautilus is buried, but the rest escape and begin the journey home, vowing to continue Nemo's dream of achieving lasting peace throughout the world.\n\nCast[]\n\nMichael Craig as Captain Cyrus Harding\n\nJoan Greenwood as Lady Mary Fairchild\n\nMichael Callan as Herbert Brown\n\nGary Merrill as Gideon Spilitt\n\nHerbert Lom as Captain Nemo\n\nBeth Rogan as Elena Fairchild\n\nPercy Herbert as Sergeant Pencroft\n\nDan Jackson as Corporal Neb Nugent\n\nCrew/Stats[]\n\nDirected by Cy Endfield\n\nScreenplay by John Prebble, Daniel B. Ullman, Crane Wilbur\n\nBased on L'Île mystérieuse 1874 novel by Jules Verne\n\nProduced by Charles H. Schneer\n\nCinematography: Wilkie Cooper\n\nEdited by Frederick Wilson\n\nMusic by Bernard Herrmann\n\nProduction company: Ameran Films\n\nDistributed by Columbia Pictures\n\nRelease date: December 20, 1961\n\nRunning time: 101 minutes\n\nCountries: United Kingdom, United States\n\nLanguage: English\n\nBox office: ~$5,000,000\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nIn May 1959, Columbia announced it had signed a deal with Charles Schneer to distribute nine of his films over three years. The films would include Battle of the Coral Sea, Gulliver's Travels, The Werner Von Braun Story, Mystery Island, Gentleman of China, and Air Force Academy.\n\nMysterious Island would be the sixth collaboration between Schneer and Ray Harryhausen, beginning with \"It Came From Beneath the Sea,\" and the third in color, following The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and The 3 Worlds of Gulliver. Like \"Sinbad\" and \"Gulliver,\" it would be shot in Spain.\n\nScreenplay[]\n\nThe novel on which the film is based is a sequel to two other novels by Jules Verne, In Search of the Castaways (1867) and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870). The first book featured the island, the pirates and a character Tom Ayrton who was marooned on a nearby island. The second book featured Captain Nemo and the Nautilus presumed lost in the maelstrom at the end of that novel.\n\nIn The Mysterious Island (1874) after the escapees' balloon landed on the island, among many adventures, they encountered Ayrton alive, fought the pirates and discovered that Captain Nemo was their benefactor and the island the base for the Nautilus.\n\nCasting[]\n\nThe film was mostly cast with British actors. Michael Craig was under contract to Rank. Michael Callan was under contract to Columbia at the time. Percy Herbert was originally rejected for his role due to his British accent, but got the part after practising a southern accent by watching Suddenly Last Summer several times.\n\nFilming[]\n\nFilming started 21 June 1960. The beach scenes in Mysterious Island were shot on location at Sa Conca Bay, Castell-Platja d'Aro in Catalonia, Spain. The escape from the Confederate prison - using an observation balloon - was filmed in Church Square, Shepperton, England.\n\nInteriors were completed at Shepperton Studios.\n\nThe stop motion animation effects were created by Ray Harryhausen. All the model creatures except the giant bird (which was re-purposed for use as the Ornithomimus in The Valley of Gwangi in 1969) still exist.\n\nMichael Craig called Endfield \"a dismal arsehole of an ex-pat American\" and Schneer \"a real Hollywood suit... the epitome of 'the son in law also rises\".\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nThe film's music was composed by Bernard Herrmann who had already scored two previous Harryhausen and Schneer productions (The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and The 3 Worlds of Gulliver). The score was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\nIn their review, The New York Times noted \"the impressive white-haired person of Herbert Lom,\" \"Cy Endfield's spirited direction,\" and that Joan Greenwood \"gurgles and croaks in a pleasantly distracting style.\"; and in 1978, their TV critic called the film a \"Dandy fantasy-adventure, done with skill and imagination, keyed by fine Bernard Herrman score. A pip of this kind.\" Time Magazine said \" It should thrill the geewillikers out of anyone!\" The film's rentals brought in over $5 million and was successful worldwide.\n\nHome Media[]\n\nBlu Ray[]\n\nALL America - Twilight Time - The Limited Edition Series[]\n\nPicture Format: 1.66:1 (1080p 24fps) [AVC MPEG-4]\n\nSoundtrack(s): English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nExtras:\n\nIsolated Score (presented in 2.0 Stereo)\n\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer (2:31)\n\nTV Trailer Spot #1 (1:03)\n\nCase type: Keep Case\n\nNote: Limited as in only 3,000 copies were made (none are numbered)\n\nDVD[]\n\nR1 America - Columbia/Tri-star Home Entertainment[]\n\nPicture Format: 1.78:1 (Anamorphic) [NTSC]\n\nSoundtrack(s): English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono\n\nSubtitles: English, French, and Spanish\n\nExtras:\n\n\"The Making Of Mysterious Island\" featurette\n\n\"The Harryhausen Chronicles\" featurette\n\n\"This Is Dynamation\" featurette\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nBonus trailers for The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\n\nCase type: Keep Case\n\nNotes: Also available in The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen: Legendary Science Fiction Series 5-disc box set, with Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, 20 Million Miles to Earth, It Came from Beneath the Sea, and H.G.
