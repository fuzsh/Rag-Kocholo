Dakkar, his sister Sonia and her fiance, engineer Nicolai Roget have designed a submarine which Roget pilots on its initial voyage just before the island is overrun by Baron Falon, despotic ruler of Hetvia. Falon sets out after Roget in a second submarine and the two craft, diving to the ocean's floor, discover a strange land populated by dragons, giant squid and an eerie undiscovered humanoid race.",

        "text": "sci-fi marathon #13\n\nBased off a novel by Jules Verne, about creatures of the abyss and diving.\n\nsemantic : You'd be forgiven if you were underwhelmed with the visuals in the first half. The sci-fi action beefs up in the second half with diving equipment galore, diving ships, creatures of the abyss, an giant octopus, and even an explosion. It is perfectly adequate for 1929. But they could have done without the lengthy expositional part of the first half, because it did bore to tears. Also, at first it was a silent then Lionel Barrymore got a speaking scene before it going back to being a silent then having random speaking scenes sprinkled here and there. Made it jarring for…\n\nOver thirty years before Ray Harryhausen tried to trick kids into thinking books were full of wonder and adventure came this loose adaptation of Jules Verne’s novel. And it’s as loose as Paris Hilton in a Conan O’Brien monologue from the 2000s. No castaways here, the island is a utopic land, ruled by the benevolent Count Dakkar, completely divorced from Captain Nemo although he is building a submarine.\n\nThis is notable for being a big budget Hollywood sci-fi epic, long before those were in vogue. Indeed, it’s failure (as well as that of Just Imagine the following year) scared them off the genre; for the next 20 years, Hollywood sci-fi would be horror hybrids and/or low budget movies aimed at…\n\nThe Mysterious Island is a fascinating (in the most clinical sense) film in just how much of an odd hybrid film this is. This takes the title from a Jules Verne book and somewhat borrows the end but restructures the entire rest of this (and avoids saying Nemo entirely), it goes back and forth between segments with recorded sound and standard silent film with intertitles, and while I saw a black and white version, this was shot in two-strip technicolor, which appears to have been located in the last decade and so a color version may come in the future. Oh, and there's also a giant octopus (which looks really cool here and has a surprisingly effective sense of scale).…\n\nThanks to TCM, I've been having a big Lionel Barrymore November. I liked him in this as Dakkar, a benevolent neo-Nemo and I liked the idea of him creating this utopian socialist science-driven paradise/cult on a remote island. I'd love to see a modern stab at this whole thing. It's like the good, heroic version of the usual evil Bond supervillain. Things start out promising with Dakkar showing off his technology and discoveries; seeing that partial fishman skeleton is just cool as hell and it primes you for adventure and fun ahead. Unfortunately, it takes forever to get to the undersea fun. It feels like the majority of the run time is spent with the villainous Baron's forces fighting our…\n\nConsidering the troubled production history of this film, it is rather amazing that it came out as good as it did. In theory it started out based on the book of the same name by Jules Verne but over the two years and many delays of it being made it turned into something very different with only a small nod to its source. And what they turned it into is very cool and imaginative. The book is about Confederate soldiers who escape on a balloon and land on an island which after various adventures and mysteries turned out to be the hideout of Captain Nemo. Nemo's real name is revealed to be Prince Dakkar and the story takes place after…"
