        "text": "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is a 2012 New Line Cinema and Walden Media 3D action adventure film loosely based off the Jules Verne novel The Mysterious Island, the Robert Louis Stevenson novel Treasure Island, and the Jonathan Swift novel Gulliver’s Travels. It is a sequel to the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth.\n\nThe film stars Dwayne Johnson as Hank Parsons, Academy Award Winner Michael Caine as Alexander Anderson, Josh Hutcherson as Sean Anderson, Vanessa Hudgens as Kailani, Luis Guzmán as Gabato, and Kristin Davis as Elizabeth “Liz” Anderson.\n\nThe music is written and composed by Andrew Lockington.\n\nThe film’s screenplay is written by Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn, based on a story by Richard Outten, Brian Gunn, and Mark Gunn.\n\nThe film is produced by New Line Cinema, Walden Media, and Contrafilm. It is distributed by New Line Cinema.\n\nJourney 2: The Mysterious Island is directed by Brad Peyton.\n\nJourney 2: The Mysterious Island is the newest film to star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson!!!\n\nThat’s it…that’s the review!!! Hope you all enjoyed it!!! Be sure to like and comment!!!\n\nWait, I’m being told I have to write more. But why??? In all honesty folks, if The Rock being in this movie isn’t convincing enough for you to see this movie, then I don’t know how I’m going to convince you. Oh well, I guess I’ll try……\n\nJourney 2: The Mysterious Island is a fun thrill ride for all ages to enjoy presented to us in 3D. Everyone had a great time shooting, the run time is kept short, and the music is quite good. The effects do get to be a little overwhelming at some points, but not enough to cause any real issue. While there are plot holes in the film, you can forgive because ultimately this film wasn’t made to be “good”, it was made to be fun. Now who’s up for an adventure……\n\n#1. The sequel no one wanted……but everyone deserved\n\nJourney 2: The Mysterious Island is a sequel to the family adventure film Journey to the Center of the Earth starring Brendan Fraser. Now if you all were like me, then you probably hated the first film (or didn’t see it at all). It only starred like 3 people, and none of those people looked like they had any fun. Brendan Fraser looked almost depressed shooting the movie (he probably was, remember he used to star in big comedies, then major action blockbusters). And when you’re making a “FUN” family adventure film, you probably want your cast to depict this. It was too serious for it’s own good. No one was going to take Journey to the Center of the Earth seriously……no matter how many hair plugs Brendan Fraser was trying to fool us with.\n\nJourney 2 is the same premise as the first film more or less, but instead of having a cast and a lead that was depressing to watch because they were too serious, the filmmakers were able to pull together a group of people that were just too much fun to watch on screen. This movie is not good by any stretch of the imagination, but I’ll be damned if you don’t have a good time watching it.\n\nJosh Hutcherson is the only character from the first film to make a return as Sean Anderson (but he’s pretty much the same character).\n\nThe casting of Dwayne Johnson as Sean’s stepfather was the first good step this film took to show the world that this film is going to be different from the first one. This man has proven time and time again that while the films he appears in may not be the best…….he himself always has a blast shooting the movie, even when his character is extremely stoic the whole time.\n\nJohnson’s performance in Journey 2 was just a joy to watch. From the moment he appears on screen, you could tell he was just too excited to be there. He couldn’t wait to shoot the movie. Again, I must stress, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is NOT a good movie, in comparison to cinema gold like Goodfellas, 12 Monkeys, Memento, or Lawrence of Arabia, but it’s not trying to be. It went in with the intention of being a fun, light-hearted, adventure film for all ages. And from that aspect it’s excellent, and Johnson depicts all of that perfectly. I honestly haven’t enjoyed a movie this much so far this year!!!\n\nDwayne Johnson is joined in this movie by the amazing Michael Caine and Greendale Community College’s very own Luis Guzmán to complete the circle. Caine plays the grandfather to Sean and the original Verne-ian in the family, and he’s INSANE!!! He’s that character that dives head first into the action without thinking of any of the consequences. These characters are always fun in these types of movies, but it’s even better when its Michael Caine. Luis Guzmán plays their helicopter pilot / tour guide and is his usual funny self. There really isn’t anything to say about him. You don’t cast Luis Guzmán to play a part in a movie, you cast him to be Luis Guzmán in a movie!!!\n\nThere were other people in this movie too, but they don’t need to be mentioned. It’s not like they did anything special.\n\n#2. The Mysteries of the Island\n\nSo the setting of the film is THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, which is really just a combination of the Mysterious Island, Treasure Island, and the island from Gulliver’s Travels. So big things are small things, small things are big things, Atlantis is on the island, there’s a volcano made out of pure gold, etc. The one thing that this island doesn’t do is “magic”, which is where many of the plot holes for the movie come from. While I’m willing to look over most of them, there’s one in particular that really bothered me.\n\nIn the trailer for the film you see the characters riding giant bees in order to travel faster. They eventually are chased by even bigger birds that eat bees. Now in the film there are three bees. One bird gives chase and is eventually joined by a second bird. The Rock and Michael Caine are able to take care of the two birds and save all of their lives. Now out of nowhere there appears a magically third bird giving chase to the teenagers only so the boy can save the girl. Where did this bird come from??? There’s no mention of it at any point.\n\nThe island is also home to a giant lizard that chases the group all throughout the forests much like a dinosaur from Jurassic Park. I bring this up because one of the best scenes in the film happens when The Rock decides that the only way to stop the lizard is to bring out his right fist, appropriately named “Thunder Cookie”, and punch the lizard in the face!!! Only that man can get away with something like that, which brings me back to the point of this entire movie. Just…have…fun!!!\n\n#3. The Finale\n\nJourney 2 succeeds in every way the original failed so miserably at. The character dynamics between Hank, Alexander, and Gabato is prove positive of this. When your characters and actors are having fun on screen, then you as the audience can also enjoy the trip. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island delivers that in spades!!! Even though there are other films out right now trying to grab that same crowd…\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun family adventure, then look no further, cause you’ve found it my friends!!! Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is that fun film for all ages!!!\n\nan 8 out of 10\n\nwhat did you think Quark???"
