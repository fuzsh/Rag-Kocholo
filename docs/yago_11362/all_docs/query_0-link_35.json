        "text": "Two vintage studio still photographs from the 1929 part-talkie film. Mimeo snipes on the versos. Loosely based on the 1874 novel by Jules Verne. The benevolent scientist-leader of a volcanic island is attacked by an evil baron, leading to a submarine chase in which they discover a race of water-bound humanoids. Shooting for the film began in 1926, but the advent of talkies and bad weather would slow production, ultimately delaying release until 1929. Lauded as an impressive cinematic feat, the astronomical price tag of the production-over $1 million in 1929-all but guaranteed the film would be a financial disaster at the box office, turning studios off to the idea of science fiction for many years. All color copies were believed lost, but in 2013 one existing color print was discovered in Prague and has since been restored through a collaboration between US film experts and the Czech National Film Archive. 8 x 10 inches. With even fading, else Near Fine."
