Born at Woodfield, near Clonakilty, in West Cork, he was the youngest child in a family of eight and was raised on his parents’ farm. His father died when he was just six years old and according to a relative, the elder Collins on his death bed declared that his son Michael would be “a great man yet and will do great things for Ireland.”\n\nCollins’ passion for his nation, and the ultimate sacrifice he paid in securing freedom for Ireland, is what makes him one of the most beloved figures in our history still to this day! For this, I am proud to offer you a brand-new pure 24-carat gold medal, in honour of the legendary man whose efforts made our eventual freedom possible struck in Brilliant Uncirculated quality.\n\nWe believe that gold should be accessible to everyone, not just in the pockets of the rich and famous, but affordable for the everyman too.

What better time to secure your own gold, whilst paying tribute to a beloved national hero!\n\nThe Michael Collins Brilliant Uncirculated Pure 24-carat Gold Coin is available to you for just€69 (Plus €4.95 P&P) and is limited to just 19,999 available worldwide!
