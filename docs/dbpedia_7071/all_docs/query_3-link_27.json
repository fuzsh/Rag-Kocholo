        "text": "Collins was born in Woodfield, Coolcraheen, near Clonakilty, in 1890 without medical assistance to Marianne Collins (née O'Brien; c. 1852-1907); In 1900, three years after the death of Michael John Collins (1815-1897), Marianne's much older husband, the family moved to a new house on the farmstead, and the old house became housing for livestock. Almost the entire property, then occupied by Collins's widower brother, Seán (previously known as John), and his eight children, was burned down at the direction of Essex Regiment soldiers on 7 April 1921. The land was sold two years later, in 1923. It was rebuilt many years later and opened to the public in October 1990 by President Patrick Hillery and is maintained by the Office of Public Works."
