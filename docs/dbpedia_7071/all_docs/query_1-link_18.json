        "text": "(1930-2021)\n\nWho Was Michael Collins?\n\nInspired by John Glenn, Michael Collins was chosen by NASA to be part of the third group of astronauts. His first spaceflight was the Gemini 10 mission, where he performed a spacewalk. His second was Apollo 11 — the first lunar landing in history. Collins received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMichael Collins was born on October 31, 1930 in Rome, Italy, where his father, United States Army Major General James Lawton Collins, was stationed. After the United States entered World War II, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Collins attended St. Albans School. During this time, he applied and was accepted to West Point Military Academy in New York, and decided to follow his father, two uncles, brother and cousin into the armed services.\n\nMilitary Career\n\nIn 1952, Collins graduated from West Point with a Bachelor of Science degree. He joined the Air Force that same year, and completed flight training in Columbus, Mississippi. His performance earned him a position on the advanced day fighter training team at Nellis Air Force Base, flying the F-86 Sabres. This was followed by an assignment to the 21st Fighter-Bomber Wing at the George Air Force Base, where he learned how to deliver nuclear weapons. He also served as an experimental flight test officer at Edwards Air Force Base in California, testing jet fighters.\n\nAstronaut\n\nCollins made the decision to become an astronaut after watching John Glenn's Mercury Atlas 6 flight. He applied for the second group of astronauts that same year, but was not accepted. Disappointed, but undaunted, Collins entered the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School as the Air Force began to research space. That year, NASA once again called for astronaut applications, and Collins was more prepared than ever. In 1963 he was chosen by NASA to be part of the third group of astronauts.\n\nCollins made two spaceflights. The first, on July 18, 1966, was the Gemini 10 mission, where Collins performed a spacewalk. The second was the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969—the first lunar landing in history. Collins, accompanied by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, remained in the Command Module while his partners walked on the moon's surface. Collins continued circling the Moon until July 21, when Armstrong and Aldrin rejoined him. The next day, he and his fellow astronauts left lunar orbit. They landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Collins, Armstrong and Aldrin were all awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Richard Nixon. However, Aldrin and Armstrong ended up receiving a majority of the public credit for the historic event, although Collins was also on the flight.\n\nCollins left NASA in January 1970, and one year later, he joined the administrative staff of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1980, he entered the private sector, working as an aerospace consultant.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCollins and his wife, Patricia Finnegan, have three children. The couple lived in both Marco Island, Florida, and Avon, North Carolina.\n\nDeath\n\nCollins died on April 28, 2021. He was 90.\n\nWatch a collection of episodes featuring Apollo 11 on History Vault\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Michael Collins\n\nBirth Year: 1930\n\nBirth date: October 31, 1930\n\nBirth City: Rome\n\nBirth Country: Italy\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Michael Collins was an astronaut who was part of the Gemini 10 and Apollo 11 missions, the latter of which included the first lunar landing in history.\n\nIndustries\n\nSpace Exploration\n\nAstrological Sign: Scorpio\n\nSchools\n\nWest Point\n\nSt. Albans School\n\nDeath Year: 2021\n\nDeath date: April 28, 2021\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"
