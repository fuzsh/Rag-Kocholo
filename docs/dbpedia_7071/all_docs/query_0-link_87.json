        "meta_description": "In 1961, President John F. Kennedy declared that the United States would send a man to the moon and safely bring him home before the end of the decade. Astronaut Michael Collins was one of those men. He flew to the moon on the historic flight of Apollo 11 while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on its surface. However, this was not supposed to be the case. Astronaut Collins was scheduled to fly on Apollo 8. While training, in 1968, he started developing symptoms of cervical myelopathy. He underwent evaluation at Wilford Hall Air Force Hospital in San Antonio and was noted to have a C5–6 disc herniation and posterior osteophyte on myelography. Air Force Lieutenant General (Dr.) Paul W. Myers performed an anterior cervical discectomy with placement of iliac bone graft. As a result, Astronaut James Lovell took his place on Apollo 8 flying the uncertain and daring first mission to the moon. This had a cascading effect on the rotation of astronauts, placing Michael Collins on the Apollo 11 flight that first landed men on the moon. It also placed Astronaut James Lovell in a rotation that exposed him to be the Commander of the fateful Apollo 13 flight. Here, the authors chronicle the history of Astronaut Collins’ anterior cervical surgery and the impact of his procedure on the rotation of astronaut flight selection, and they review the pivotal historic nature of the Apollo 8 spaceflight. The authors further discuss the ongoing issue of cervical disc herniation among astronauts.",

        "text": "President John F. Kennedy bluntly petitioned Congress on May 25, 1961, “…this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.”3 It was bold rhetoric. It was only on May 5, 1961, that Alan Shepard had completed his 15-minute suborbital flight.16\n\nAt the time, America was largely losing the Space Race to the Russians. On October 4, 1957, the Russians had successfully launched Sputnik 1 into a low earth orbit, and in April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. His mission had lasted more than 1 hour and 48 minutes as he orbited the earth.19\n\nIn a famous speech at Rice University, President Kennedy looked to persuade the American public:\n\nWe choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win….4\n\nAmerica accomplished that goal. Project Mercury spanned from 1958 to 1963 and put an American in space by completing both suborbital and orbital flights.9 The Gemini Program perfected the mechanical steps necessary to put a man on the moon. From 1965 to 1966, 10 manned missions flew in a low earth orbit. The astronauts accomplished things such as extravehicular activity (spacewalks) and technical exercises such as a space rendezvous between 2 different spaceships.10\n\nOn July 20, 1969, man landed on the moon. A total of 9 flights went to the moon, with 6 landing on its surface. By 1972, 12 men had walked on the moon. Twelve more have flown to the moon without walking on its surface (Fig. 1). All returned safely to earth.15\n\nA total of $25.4 billion was pledged to the cause through the Apollo Space Program.18 Astronauts risked and in some cases lost their lives in pursuit of this exploration. Here, we document the health and space journey of a single astronaut, Michael Collins. An astronaut for both the Apollo and Gemini Programs, in 1968 in the middle of his astronaut career and 2 years after his first trip into space, Astronaut Collins underwent an anterior cervical fusion for a posterior osteophyte and cervical disc herniation. This event changed the history of American spaceflight.\n\nAstronaut Michael Collins\n\nAstronaut Collins was born in Rome, Italy, on October 31, 1930, while his father, Major General James Lawton Collins, served in the Army. Michael Collins graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1952 and was subsequently commissioned in the United States Air Force.17 Astronaut Collins finished his career as a Major General United States Air Force Reserve. He accumulated nearly 4200 hours of earth-based flying time and 266 hours in space (Fig. 2).17\n\nFuture Astronaut Collins attended the United States Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School on Edwards Air Force Base in 1960. He was a member of class 60-C. Of note, class 60-C also included fellow Apollo-era astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Irwin.1\n\nIn 1959, the United States selected its first group of astronauts: NASA Astronaut Group 1, more commonly referred to as the Mercury Seven. Anticipating the need for more astronauts, The New Nine or NASA Astronaut Group 2 was announced on September 17, 1962. Astronaut Collins was not selected. In 1963, then-Major Collins was selected for NASA Astronaut Group 3, consisting of 14 astronauts, dutifully named The Fourteen.1\n\nCollins’ first spaceflight occurred in 1966 on Gemini 10 with fellow astronaut John Young. This intricate 3-day mission called for 2 different rendezvous with Agena Target Vehicles that mimicked the orbital rendezvous necessary for the eventual lunar landings. The crew also performed 2 extravehicular activities or spacewalks for a total of 1 hour and 28 minutes in the vacuum of space.4,15\n\nImmediately following Gemini 10, Collins began preparation for the Apollo missions.\n\nCervical Disc Herniation\n\nAstronaut Collins was slated for positioning on Apollo 8 along with veteran astronaut Frank Borman and first-time flier William Anders. It was around this time that Astronaut Collins started to show symptoms of cervical myelopathy. He first noticed this during his handball games, stating, “my legs didn’t seem to function normally.”1 Astronaut Collins, fearing a grounding from flight, ignored the symptoms for a period of time. He was slightly older (37 years at the time), and a trip to the NASA flight surgeon could threaten his ability to fly. The symptoms quickly worsened. He had problems walking up and down stairs, and he nearly fell on numerous occasions. He had numbness and tingling throughout the left and right legs, and his paresthesia was ascending. At this point Astronaut Collins approached the NASA flight surgeon, who sent him to nearby Houston on July 12, 1968, for evaluation with a neurologist. The neurologist ordered a radiograph that illustrated a significant C5–6 posterior osteophyte.1\n\nCollins was immediately scheduled for surgery with a civilian neurosurgeon. This was not well received by NASA, who wanted him seen by an Air Force surgeon and made arrangements for a referral at their own facility. Astronaut Collins was still an Air Force officer and by proxy a national investment. This change in plan saved the flying status of Michael Collins and ushered his name into the history books of spaceflight.1\n\nThe initial operative plan in Houston by a civilian neurosurgery was for a posterior cervical laminectomy. This would have grounded Astronaut Collins from any further spaceflight per Air Force protocol. However, Astronaut Collins saw 2 more surgeons, a civilian expert and Air Force surgeon Paul Myers, who would subsequently perform the operation.1 They recommended an anterior cervical fusion with an iliac bone graft. This may have been uncharted waters for spaceflight, but bony fusion was required by the Air Force for flying status. The thought process was that a cervical laminectomy would leave the neck too vulnerable and weak to sustain the significant force of an ejection seat. As such, Michael Collins underwent an anterior cervical fusion in August 1968 at Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio.1\n\nAstronaut Collins referred to Ward T-2 (the neurosurgery ward) at Wilford Hall Hospital as a “scary place.” He made a specific point to avoid the intensive care units and to “never go in there” during his near 10-day stay.1 Astronaut Collins first underwent myelography, as this was the technology available at the time. This study confirmed the suspected disc and osteophyte compression. Astronaut Collins then underwent the anterior cervical fusion with iliac bone graft. According to Collins’ discussion with Dr. Myers, the C5–6 disc had herniated but also gone posterior to the C6 body.1 Collins awoke in a collar, with his main complaint being that of a dull right hip pain from the iliac crest graft. Collins underwent physical therapy including ambulation, physical training, and lifting weights. He was discharged the week after surgery.1\n\nCollins was kept in a collar for 24 hours each day for 3 months. His flying future depended on the outcome of his cervical spine radiograph. The Air Force and NASA needed to see documented fusion between C5 and C6 across the iliac graft. Failure of fusion would have meant permanent restrictions from flying and being placed in a Minerva brace.1 However, Astronaut Collins’ radiographs showed tremendously strong fusion and bony growth. In October 1968, he was cleared to remove the collar and could fly transport planes (low impact, no ejection seat).1 By November 1968, he could fly jets, including NASA’s famed T-38 training jet. The one remaining and nagging symptom he had was temperature sensation asymmetry in one leg. This was permanent, but Astronaut Collins noted, “I could live with it easily.”1 All in all, it took Collins 125 days to return to full flying status following his anterior cervical fusion. This delay, however, resulted in his removal from the Apollo 8 mission, where Astronaut James Lovell took his place. In the words of astronaut Collins, “this period was the most frustrating of my life.”1\n\nLieutenant General (Dr.) Paul W. Myers\n\nColonel Myers became the Air Force neurosurgeon for Astronaut Collins. Independent of his neurosurgical career, General Myers was intimately involved with human space exploration and aerospace medicine. He completed the primary course in aviation medicine at the United States Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, in June 1951. He utilized that training as Chief of the Professional Services for the Eastern Air Defense Force at Stewart Field, New York. During Project Mercury, General Myers served as a member on the land-based medical recovery forces.\n\nIn 1958, General Myers was named the director of neurosurgery at Wilford Hall United States Air Force Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. In 1971, he became commander of the institution. In August 1978, he became Surgeon General of the United States Air Force. He retired from the Air Force on December 1, 1983.20\n\nHistorical Significance of Apollo 8\n\nA list of Apollo missions can be found in Table 1. Apollo 8 was to be the third mission utilizing the Saturn V rocket and its first with a manned crew. It was originally scheduled to be a D mission. The A missions had been unmanned tests of the Saturn V rocket in Apollo 4 and Apollo 6. Apollo 7 was the first with a manned crew, and it tested the command and service module in an earth orbit (C mission). The command module was the cabin utilized by the crew during the flight and the portion of the spacecraft that returned to earth. The original purpose of Apollo 8 was to fulfill the goals of the D mission by testing the lunar module and command service module in a low earth orbit. This was to be flown by Astronauts James McDivitt, David Scott, and Rusty Schweickart. The crew of Frank Borman, Bill Anders, and Michael Collins was slated to fly the lunar module more aggressively in an elliptical medium earth orbit (E mission).7\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nNameCommanderCommand Module PilotLunar Module PilotDate (mo/day/yr)Mission Notes*Apollo 1Virgil “Gus” GrissomEdward White IIRoger Chaffee2/21/1967†All 3 crewmembers killed by a fire during prelaunch testing involving a 100% oxygen environmentApollo 7Walter Schirra Jr.Donn EiseleR.

It was not going be ready for spaceflight until February 1969. Fearing that this type of delay would jeopardize landing on the moon by the end of the decade, NASA administration considered changing the order of flights.7\n\nGeorge Low, manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program, made a bold suggestion. He significantly altered the order of flights. He wanted the Apollo 8 command module to fly to the moon and enter a low lunar orbit. This was originally going to be the mission of Apollo 10 and was considered an F mission.7 The lunar module was not going to be available, but he thought that the space program could make it to the moon. With the change of the flight objectives and with differences in training preparation, Chief of the Astronaut Office and former Mercury Astronaut Deke Slayton, after discussion with Astronaut McDivitt, switched the crew order. He placed the crew of Borman, Collins, and Anders in line for Apollo 8. He moved the crew of James McDivitt, David Scott, and Rusty Schweickart to Apollo 9. Administration eventually documented the “new” Apollo 8 flight as a C-prime mission.12\n\nThe flight timeline for Apollo 8 can be seen in Table 2. The mission captivated the United States and the entire world. For the first time in human history, someone would travel to another celestial body. They would leave not only earth but also earth’s orbit. Flight director Chris Kraft gave the mission a 50/50 chance of success.5 Astronaut Anders gave the mission a one-third chance of success, one-third chance of survival accident, and one-third chance of never coming back.8 The astronauts had to launch on a powerful rocket. They had to successfully enter earth’s orbit. They had to successfully reach the moon, enter its orbit, and, even more importantly, they had to make sure they could leave the moon’s orbit and return to earth.\n\nTABLE 2.\n\nEventGMTGMT Date (mo/day/yr)*James Lovell substituted for Michael Collins in Apollo 8 crew7/1968Apollo 8 publically declared a lunar flight11/12/1968Michael Collins medically approved for spaceflight11/1968Terminal countdown01:51:0012/20/1968Crew ingress09:58:0012/21/1968Liftoff12:5112/21/1968Earth orbit insertion13:02:3512/21/1968CAPCOM (Michael Collins): “Apollo 8.

The flight was a tremendous success and energized the space program to reach the moon before end of the decade, with Apollo 11 landing on the moon in July 1969.\n\nRotation of Astronauts\n\nThe anterior cervical fusion of Astronaut Collins changed the history of American spaceflight.\n\nAgain, the Apollo 8 crew was originally slated as Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders. The backup crew was Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin.7 When Astronaut Collins needed cervical surgery, James Lovell was pulled from the backup crew to the prime crew. Buzz Aldrin subsequently became the backup Command Module Pilot, and Astronaut Fred Haise became the new backup Lunar Module Pilot.3 Medical issues of Apollo-era astronauts are found in Table 3.\n\nTABLE 3.\n\nAstronautSelection ClassHealth IssueOutcomeDeke SlaytonMercury Seven, 1959Paroxysmal atrial fibrillationGrounded from flying in 1962 until the Apollo-Soyuz project in 1975, served as Chief of Astronaut OfficeAlan ShepardMercury Seven, 1959Ménière’s diseaseFlew on first manned US spaceflight Freedom 7, grounded during Gemini Program, landed on moon w/ Apollo 14Scott CarpenterMercury Seven, 1959Arm injuryMotorbike accident in Bermuda 1964 while training for an aquanaut mission, was on leave from NASA, never flew againWalter SchirraMercury Seven, 1959Significant head coldSignificant head cold; given the tense exchanges with the crew and mission control, no one from Apollo 7 flew in space againFrank BormanThe New Nine, 1962SASNASA’s 1st encounter w/ SAS, which affects nearly 50% of those who go into space; occurred w/ Apollo 8 en route to the moon, significant vestibular & motion-related illness, did not in any way affect performance or missionMichael CollinsThe Fourteen, 1963Cervical osteophyteRemoved from crew of Apollo 8, replaced by James Lovell, flew on crew of Apollo 11, subsequently bumped James Lovell to Apollo 13Ken MattinglyOriginal Nineteen, 1966Rubella exposurePossible exposure to rubella, removed from Apollo 13, replaced by Jack Swigert, flew to moon Apollo 16John BullOriginal Nineteen, 1966Pulmonary diseaseResigned from the astronaut corps 1968, did not fly in space\n\nAs per the flight rotation, generally (with certain exceptions) backup crews became the prime crew 3 flights later.6 In this pivotal instance, the backup crew for Apollo 8 flew as the crew for Apollo 11.14 Neil Armstrong was named the historic Commander of Apollo 11. Buzz Aldrin went back to his original position as Lunar Module Pilot. Since Astronaut Lovell had just flown in place of Astronaut Collins as Command Module Pilot in Apollo 8, Astronaut Collins took the position of Command Module Pilot in Apollo 11.1 This ensured that Collins would fly to the moon. However, it also ensured that he would not walk on the moon during Apollo 11. The Command Module Pilot remained with the command module while the Commander (Armstrong) and Lunar Module Pilot (Aldrin) walked on the moon.1\n\nThe cervical fusion of Astronaut Collins changed the history of human spaceflight in 3 distinct ways. It thrust James Lovell into the famous crew of Apollo 8. Lovell became one of the first 3 humans to reach the moon, and in the process he was part of the most-watched television broadcasts in the history of mankind. This circulated Michael Collins into the crew of Apollo 11 and into the annals of history as the Command Module Pilot of man’s first mission that landed men on the moon. It also changed the rotation of astronauts, placing James Lovell in the position where he was to become the Commander of the fated Apollo 13 flight.\n\nDisc Herniation in Astronauts\n\nAstronaut Collins is not alone. Data from NASA illustrate that astronauts are at an increased risk for disc herniation; 53%–68% of astronauts report back pain during spaceflight.2 This is likely due to a lengthening of the vertebral column due to disc expansion secondary to a loss a lumbar lordosis due to the lack of gravity.\n\nData in 2010 from the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health illustrated that the incidence of a herniated disc (of any kind) for a United States astronaut was 4.3 times higher than standardized controls. Like Astronaut Collins, these herniated discs in astronauts tended to be in the cervical region. As such, the risk of a cervical disc herniation in astronauts is 21.4 higher than that in the civilian population.2 Data spanned from April 1959 to December 2006 and almost certainly included that of Astronaut Collins.\n\nData showed 44 cases of disc herniation in 32 astronauts. Interestingly, 40.9% (18/44) were in the cervical region compared with only 8.6% (3/35) in a similarly matched control group. Of the 36 cases of post-mission disc herniation in astronauts, 10 (27.8%) needed surgery. In postmission astronauts, 4 of 13 (30.8%) cervical disc herniations required surgery. Interestingly, 3 disc herniations in the series occurred specifically on landing day, with the risk decreasing over time.2 Astronaut Collins flew to space in Gemini 10 in 1966 and subsequently had disc herniation in 1968.1\n\nThere exists debate within the flight community regarding the repetitive impact of high gravitational forces on the back and cervical spine in terms of disc herniation. It is generally accepted that high gravitational forces from jet piloting places an increased strain on the cervical spine. Astronaut Collins had been a test pilot prior to his NASA experience. While there is good evidence of the prevalence of neck and back pain in the pilots of tactical aircraft (largely attributed to the +Gz forces that they routinely experience in performance of their flight duties), the 2010 study noted no significant difference in the rate of disc herniation between astronauts who were high performance jet pilots prior to their time at NASA and those who were not.2\n\nProposed mechanisms of this susceptibility are complex. Lack of gravity allows for disc expansion that subsequently can predispose a disc to prolapse. However, MRI performed 24 hours after an 8-day space shuttle mission showed no change in disc volume. There is discussion as to whether there is instability in the anterior or posterior ligamentous complex.2 This is complicated by the large amount of equipment worn by astronauts on reentrance to gravity. Shuttle astronauts wore 32 kg or 70.5 lbs of equipment upon reentry to gravity.2\n\nConclusions\n\nIn 1968, Astronaut Michael Collins underwent an anterior cervical fusion with iliac crest graft. This changed the history of human spaceflight. As a direct result from the timeline of his surgery, Astronaut Collins was shifted from the crew of Apollo 8 to Apollo 11. Along with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, he became part of the first crew to land on the moon.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the, US Navy, United States Navy Reserve, Department of Defense, or the US Government.\n\nDisclosures\n\nThe authors report no conflict of interest concerning the materials or methods used in this study or the findings specified in this paper.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConception and design: Menger, Thakur.
