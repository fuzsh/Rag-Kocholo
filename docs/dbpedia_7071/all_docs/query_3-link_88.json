        "text": "The Kiernan family was quite wealthy, owning the Greville Arms Hotel and several other businesses. It was in the Greville Arms Hotel that Kitty met Michael Collins in May 1917. Collins and his friend, Harry Boland, vied for Kitty's affections initially. Collins eventually won, and became engaged to Kitty.\n\nCollins's political duties took up much of his time. The couple kept in frequent correspondence through letters. Some of these letters are on display in Cork Public Museum. From the later half of 1921 until his death, Collins and Kiernan exchanged over 300 love letters.\n\nCollins led the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations in London in 1921, and the Treaty with the British Government was signed on 6 December. Under the Treaty, six counties in Ulster were to remain part of Britain and Irish parliamentarians were required to take an oath of allegiance to the British monarchy. Collins saw the Treaty as a stepping stone toward a thirty-two county republic and signed it with 'great reluctance', partly in order to prevent further bloodshed. He wrote to a close friend on the day of signing, 'I tell you this - early this morning I signed my own death warrant.'\n\nThe Treaty caused bitter division among Irish republicans. Led by Ã‰amon de Valera, the anti-Treaty side rebelled and a bloody civil war followed. Collins was assassinated by anti-Treaty activists in his native Cork on August 22 1922. Just thirty-one when he died, he had accomplished much for his country in his short, but very active, life."
