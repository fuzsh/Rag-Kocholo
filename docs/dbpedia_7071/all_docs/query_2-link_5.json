        "text": "As an astronaut, Mike had occasion to look out at both the Moon and Earth, and know that all of humankind and all its history was in his forward field of view. As we move on without Mike, better for having known him, the future is in our forward view and it’s our turn to carry the fire. He prepared us well for that noble task—and I hope the world in his window will always remember the name Michael Collins.\n\nI have considered Mike a hero of mine for a long time. I was always captivated by the idea of him orbiting the moon while others landed on it. I’ve used that as inspiration in my life. Whenever something seemed particularly tough, I’d say, well Mike Collins did that, so I can do this. Because of that initial interest, I wanted to know more about his career. And I found out his sense of humor and humanity matched his intelligence and bravery. So many years ago, I picked a hero who lived up to that billing.\n\nWhen I turned 15, Apollo 11 was on its way back to Earth. 50 years later I wrote a letter to Michael Collins thanking him for being the wonderful person that he was. He was always my favorite astronaut and so when the 50th anniversary came around it was such a pleasure to see and hear him speak about this unifying time in human history. When I heard the news of his passing on April 28, I have to admit I was devastated because it was sudden. But when I think of him, I know that the life he lived benefited all of us. Not only through his work and words, but through his character, dignity and humanity. I shall miss him very much and my deepest condolences go out to his family. But I feel that my life was better because we were blessed to have him. As Virgil wrote, “No day shall erase you from the memory of time.”\n\nI will remember Michael Collins best for the key role he played in making the current National Air and Space Museum in D.C. a reality. I think he saw the National Air and Space Museum as a museum that could educate and inspire its visitors, and I am personally very grateful to him for his absolutely incredible achievement in that respect....I had the opportunity to work on a few unmanned post-Apollo Lunar missions. When I looked at the Moon as our spacecraft approached it or were in its orbit, I sometimes thought of the brave Apollo astronauts and the thousands of people who made those pioneering Apollo missions possible, but Michael Collins was one of the people I specifically thought of. Michael, there are many people who will never forget you and what you did. Thank you very much, and rest in peace."
