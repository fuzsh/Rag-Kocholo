        "text": "Michael Collins (1890 -1922), Irish revolutionary and Chairman of the Provisional Government, was born on the 16th of October 1890 at Woodfield near Clonakilty, County Cork. He died in action at Béal na Bláth County Cork, during the Civil War in August 1922.\n\nThe birthplace is open to the public all year round and there are information panels which outlining the history of the site.\n\nThe birthplace was once the Collins family homestead, until it was sold in 1923, with the farm. The site was opened to the public in 1990.\n\nClose to the entrance is the footprint of a farmhouse. Michael Collins’ mother built this new dwelling when he was ten. The Essex Regiment burnt it down during the War of Independence in April 1921.\n\nIn the middle of the site there are three large trees, which mark the site of a barn that was also burned in 1921.\n\nThe building at the back of the site was the original dwelling house where Michael Collins was born on October 16th 1890. It was later used as a farm out building."
