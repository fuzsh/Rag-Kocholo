        "text": "Astronaut Michael Collins, who piloted the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, has died, his family reported on April 28.\n\nHistory remembers Collins as the pilot of the command service module during NASA’s Apollo 11 mission. As CSM pilot, Collins orbited the Moon alone while his crewmates Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface. His family remembers Collins for “his sharp wit, his quiet sense of purpose, and his wise perspective, gained both from looking back at Earth from the vantage of space and gazing across calm waters from the deck of his fishing boat,” the family wrote in a Twitter post announcing his death.\n\n“We will miss him terribly,” they wrote.\n\nTo The Moon\n\nCollins was born in 1930 into a family with a tradition of military service. His father had served as an aide to General John Pershing during his 1916 foray into Mexico chasing the revolutionary commander Pancho Villa and then in the trenches of Europe after the U.S. entered World War I. Decades later, Collins’ older brother led a battalion of soldiers onto Utah Beach during the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944.\n\nAlthough Collins followed family tradition as far as the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, he charted his own course from there, entering the then relatively young United States Air Force as a fighter pilot. He became a test pilot in 1960 – and he quickly set his sights even higher. It took Collins two tries to get accepted into NASA’s astronaut corps, but he made it in 1963.\n\nThe U.S. space program in the 1960s was laser-focused on getting astronauts to the Moon before 1970. President John F. Kennedy had issued the challenge in 1961, and every crewed space mission NASA flew was another incremental step toward a destination 240,000 miles away. In 1966, Collins and his Gemini 10 crewmate John Young rode a Titan II rocket into orbit to test something that would become an important part of future lunar missions: docking two spacecraft together in orbit.\n\nCollins piloted the Gemini 10 capsule to dock with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle 475 miles above Earth’s surface. 3 years later, he would use essentially the same docking technique to recover Armstrong and Aldrin’s lunar module after they took off from the Moon. Gemini 10 was the first major test of the method, and it worked like a charm.\n\nLater in life, Collins spent much of his free time painting watercolors of the Everglades and the aircraft he had flown during his career as a pilot. However, his most enduring piece of art may be the mission patch he designed for Apollo 11 in 1969. Collins depicted an eagle landing on the rocky lunar surface, with the distant Earth in the background. Most NASA mission patches include the crew’s names, usually around the edge, but Collins and his crewmates left their names off because they felt that the first lunar landing belonged to all of humanity.\n\nBut only one person could be the first to walk on the Moon, and only two could land at all on that first mission. Someone had to stay in the command module, 60 miles above the barren surface of the Moon. That someone was Michael Collins.\n\nWhile Armstrong and Aldrin explored their tiny patch of the Moon, Collins spent 21.5 hours alone in orbit above them. For 48 minutes at a time, the command module curved around the far side of the Moon, putting a 2100 mile-wide ball of rock between its solitary pilot and every other human who ever lived. During those 48 minutes, Collins didn’t even have radio contact with Earth or his crewmates on the Moon; he had to wait, alone and in silence, to find out if they’d landed safely.\n\n“If a count were taken, the score would be 3 billion plus 2 over on the other side of the Moon, and 1 plus God-knows-what on this side,” he recalled in 1974.\n\nIt’s the kind of experience that might plunge most of us into the depths of existential terror, but Collins apparently had a wonderful time. In 2019, he told the New York Times, “I had this beautiful little domain. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even.” Only worry for his crewmates – who weren’t even certain, themselves, if their lunar module would really manage to lift off from the Moon to bring them home – troubled him.\n\nBut during the rest of the mission, Collins had plenty to worry about, and plenty to do. During the crew’s first moments in Earth orbit, he had to pilot the command module away from the third stage of the Saturn V rocket that had just carried them into space – then turn the module around to dock with the newly-uncovered lunar landing module, which had been tucked inside the third stage for launch. On the long flight to the Moon, the entire crew stayed busy.\n\nAnd of course, once Armstrong and Aldrin had blasted their way off the lunar surface, it was up to Collins to retrieve them and bring them safely home. During training for the mission, he’d prepared checklists for 18 possible scenarios – different variations of spacecraft speeds and trajectories that he’d need to react to without hesitation. He wore them on a lanyard around his neck during his day in orbit, hoping he wouldn’t need to use the final one, which spelled out what to do if the lunar module didn’t take off at all.\n\nDown To Earth\n\nWith the Moon finally walked upon and the astronauts safely home, Collins decided his work was done. He left NASA to become the director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. He joined LTV Aerospace Defense Company as a vice president in 1980 and later founded his own consulting company. Collins retired from the U.S. Air Force Reserve as a Major General in 1982.\n\nCollins wrote 4 books: an autobiography, Carrying the Fire; a history of the space program, Liftoff; a look at Mars spaceflight, Mission to Mars; and a children’s book, Flying to the Moon. He was preceded in death by his wife, social worker Patricia Collins, in 2014. The couple had 3 children.\n\n“I have been places and done things you simply would not believe, he wrote in Carrying the Fire. “I have seen the Earth eclipsed by the Moon, and enjoyed it. I have seen the Sun’s true light, unfiltered by any planet’s atmosphere. I have seen the ultimate black of infinity in a stillness undisturbed by any living thing.”"
