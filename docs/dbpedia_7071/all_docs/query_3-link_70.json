        "meta_description": "From a boisterous Cork childhood to radicalisation and rebellion, becoming part of a new Irish establishment, and the assassination that rocked the country, Michael Collins lived a fascinating and challenging life. This fictionalised biography charts his coming of age – and his growing anger at British rule in Ireland – and tells the story of the violent and precarious establishment of the Irish Free State through his eyes.",

        "text": "Massey is a deep researcher and a deft writer. It’s extremely tricky to convey a convincing interiority for a fictionalised version of a real person, especially when they are already familiar to your reader. She skillfully weaves known details about Collins’ personal life into the sweeping historical narrative, helping to humanise and contextualise his strong beliefs and dynamic relationships. She takes care to highlight some of the ordinary people who were affected by his actions, both rash and calculated, and the scenes where he convinces his cousin to spy for him are particularly riveting,\n\nDespite the title, this is not a hagiography. The fact that Collins generally ordered violence as opposed to carrying it out himself allows Massey to be both honest and age-appropriate. Collins comes across as flawed and conflicted and it’s clear that we’re getting his own, inevitably biased, perspective on figures like Eamon de Valera and Cathal Brugha. An entertaining, accessible book that can spark a deeper engagement with history and historical narrative."
