        "text": "âThis venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two,â Collins said\n\nHe was also the first person ever to venture to the far side of the Moon completely alone, and out of radio contact for half of each orbit\n\nThe second son of the U.S. military attachÃ© to Italy, Collins was born in Rome on October 31, 1930\n\nDespite his strong family history in the U.S. Army, he chose to join the U.S. Air Force to avoid accusations of nepotism. He became a celebrated test pilot, achieving the rank of major general.\n\nInspired by John Glenn and his flight in Friendship 7 in February 1962, Collins decided to apply to NASA\n\nCollins and Aldrin were not selected the first time they applied to become astronauts but were accepted in the third astronaut group in October 1963\n\nAfter leaving NASA in 1970, Collins continued his distinguished career, including a term as the assistant secretary of state for public affairs\n\nHis passion for space never ceased, and in 1971, he became the director of the Smithsonianâs National Air and Space Museum, before becoming undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1978"
