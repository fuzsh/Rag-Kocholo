Please ask the wiki team before adding content.\n\nMichael Collins (Irish: Mícheál Ó Coileáin) is an Irish revolutionary, soldier, and politician who was a leading figure during the Irish War of Independence. Collins has been President of the Irish Republic since 1930.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nCollins was born in Woodfield, Coolcraheen, near Clonakilty, County Cork, on 16 October 1890, the third son and youngest of eight children. His father, Michael John (1816–1897), was a farmer and amateur mathematician, who had been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) movement.\n\nAt the age of thirteen he attended Lisavaird National School. During the week he stayed with his eldest sister Margaret Collins-O'Driscoll and her husband, Patrick O'Driscoll, who had 14 children. During weekends he stayed at the family farmstead. His brother-in-law Patrick O'Driscoll founded the newspaper West Cork People and Collins helped out.\n\nLeaving school at fifteen, Collins took the British Civil Service examination in Cork in February 1906 and moved to the home of his spinter sister Johanna (\"Hannie\") in London, where he became a clerk in the Post Office Savings Bank at Blythe House. In 1910, a London firm of stockbrokers, Horne and Company, hired him as a messenger. After studying law at King's College, he joined the London GAA and, through this, the IRB. Sam Maguire, a republican from Dunmanway, County Cork, introduced the 19-year-old Collins to the IRB. In 1915 he moved to work in the Guaranty Trust Company of New York where he remained until his return to Ireland the following year joining part-time Craig Gardiner & Co, a firm of accountants in Dawson Street, Dublin.\n\nWar and Independence[]\n\nThe struggle for Home Rule, along with labour unrest, had led to the formation in 1913 of two major nationalist paramilitary groups who later launched the Easter Rising: the Irish Citizen Army was established by James Connolly, James Larkin and his Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU) to protect strikers from the Dublin Metropolitan Police during the 1913 Dublin Lockout. The Irish Volunteers were created in the same year by nationalists in response to the formation of the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), an Ulster loyalist body pledged to oppose Home Rule by force.\n\nMichael Collins' great organisational skill brought him prominence in the IRB. As a result he was appointed as financial advisor to Count Plunkett, father of one of the Easter Rising's organisers, Joseph Plunkett. Collins took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the insurrection. When the Rising began on Monday, April 24, Collins served as Joseph Plunkett's aide-de-camp at the rebellion's headquarters in the General Post Office in Dublin, fighting alongside Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, and other members of the its leadership. The Rising was crushed after six days, but lasted long enough to capture worldwide public attention.\n\nFollowing the surrender, Collins was arrested and taken into British custody. Processed at Dublin's Richmond Barracks, he was transferred to Frongoch internment camp in Wales. He emerged as one of the most senior survivors, most of the Easter Rising's leadership having been executed, a fate he narrowly escaped. Collins began plotting the next rebellion even before the prison ship left Dublin. Outcry from the Irish and the Americans led to the fateful release of the Frongoch prisoners in December.\n\nCollins rose through the ranks of the Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin after his release from Frongoch. He became a Teachta Dála for South Cork in 1918, and appointed Minister for Finance in the First Dáil. He was present when the Dáil convened on 21 January 1919 and declared the independence of the Irish Republic. In the ensuing War of Independence, he was Director of Organisation and Adjutant General for the Irish Volunteers, and Director of Intelligence of the Irish Republican Army. He gained fame as a guerrilla warfare strategist, planning and directing many successful attacks on British forces, such as the \"Bloody Sunday\" assassinations of key British intelligence agents in November 1920. By 1921, the United Kingdom's escalating attempts to restore its rule to Ireland were growing ever less popular. A combination of its expense while the UK retained colossal war debt, a strongly antiwar public, increasing German aid to the rebels and fears that a war torn Ireland could fall to syndicalism like France combined to coerce it into a truce with the Irish Republican Army on July 11. Over the following months, amidst continued violence in Ulster, Michal Collins and President of Sinn Féin Arthur Griffith negotiated with the British government. On November 10, 1921 the Anglo-Irish treaty officially ended the Irish War of Independence. Its terms were:\n\nCrown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland.\n\nIreland was to become a self-governing Republic. Ireland would be a sovereign state associated with, but not a member of, the Commonwealth; the British monarch would be head of the association, but not head of state of Ireland. This is known as External Association, a concept created by de Valera, and supported by Griffith and Collins.\n\nNorthern Ireland (which had been created earlier by the Government of Ireland Act) would have the option of entering into the Irish Republic within 5 years of the Treaty coming into effect, but only upon the agreement of the newly created Council of Ireland.\n\nA Boundary Commission would be constituted to draw the boundary between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain, for its own security, would continue to control a limited number of ports, known as the Treaty Ports, for the Royal Navy.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland would assume responsibility for a proportionate part of the United Kingdom's sizable debt, as it stood on the date of signature.\n\nThe treaty would have superior status in Irish law, i.e., in the event of a conflict between it and the new 1922 Constitution of the Republic of Ireland, the treaty would take precedence.\n\nGriffith then arranged a team to draft a new Irish Constitution. Approved by referendum in February 1922. It established the government as a semi-presidential parliamentary republic, with an elected president and the Príomh-Aire (equivalent to prime minister) sharing executive powers.\n\nIn May, Griffith called a snap election before retiring at the end of his term. Eoin MacNeill was chosen as Sinn Féin’s new leader, while Michael Collins remained leader of the party in the legislature. head of government. Opposition to Collins within Sinn Féin had grown with his critics suspecting that he would become the real power behind MacNeill as they believed he had been behind Griffith. The anti-Collins faction, led by Cathal Brugha and including Éamon de Valera, left Sinn Féin and created the new party Cumann an tSaorstáit, which was socially conservative and staunchly republican. Brugha became the main opposing candidate for president, but the election saw Sinn Féin under MacNeill and Collins win handily. The MacNeill administration was preoccupied by the situation in Northern Ireland where sectarian violence continued to flare up. His government met with the Unionist leadership in Belfast promising to work towards a peaceful resolution, though other elements within Sinn Féin clandestinely supported the Ulster IRA.\n\nUlster and Opposition[]\n\nThe collapse of Great Britain into civil war from the latter part of 1924 once again raised the political question of Northern Ireland; some within the Republic advocated invasion and annexation. Though the Unionist government in the north had unequivocally stood by the British monarchy and parliament, after the government fled to Canada, communications became infrequent and the British government-in-exile ordered Belfast to simply hold tight amidst growing fears the syndicalists would invade once their control of Britain had consolidated. Collins proposed meetings with the Unionists on the possibility of incorporation into the republic, a move that was met with extreme reluctance in Belfast and outright anger among many in Ireland. Nonetheless, early in 1926 rumors that a red army was gathering in Liverpool for an invasion of Northern Ireland and no word from Canada caused a deal to be made. Ulster agreed to join the Republic, whilst the South promised to defend Ulster from any invading force in the interim while the region was integrated into the now united Ireland.\n\nIn exchange for “reunification” with Ireland, the Unionists received guarantees that the Irish would provide for their defense and honor a set of protections known as the “Ulster Privileges”. Significantly, these privileges granted the county councils of the six counties special autonomy, guaranteed that a certain number of Unionists would sit on the President’s Council of State, and created a Minister for Ulster Affairs. Despite the concessions, integration was slow and political violence continued with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Ulster Special Constabulary proving difficult to disband. Eventually they were permitted to remain should they join the Gardaí.\n\nDespite having achieved what was widely thought impossible in the form of Irish Unification, the collapse of the British Empire and the Great Depression in the USA had left the Irish economy in freefall. Cumann an tSaorstáit seized on the economic crisis, as Sinn Féin’s plans for industrialisation had stalled and much of the economy was being sunk into keeping the Ulster industries alive. Due to the special privileges afforded to Ulster (a major point of contention), Catholics found themselves bearing the brunt of layoffs and economic hardship with no help forthcoming. A politically weak president, an economy in downfall and the hated special treatment granted to Ulster were a perfect storm and in the elections, Sinn Féin took a beating while Cumann an tSaorstáit won a slim majority. Cathal Brugha was inaugurated as the new president.\n\nBrugha and Cumann an tSaorstáit’s attempted to fix the economy by shifting Ireland away from Anglo-American markets and towards Germany though Brugha resisted proposals for Ireland to fully join Mitteleuropa. Brugha established a Central Bank and a new currency pegged to the German mark. In the wilderness, Sinn Féin began to undergo something of a revival with Collins becoming its new president, and seizing on any gaffe or troubles the Brugha administration experienced. Able to shrug off the faults of the MacNeill administration, Collins became a rapidly more popular figure.\n\nAs time went on with little economic rebound, Brugha’s administration found cracks emerging in the form of growing leftist discontent and the failure to solve the lingering Ulster issue. Despite the banning of the Irish Worker's League and a crackdown on the openly left wing, increasing leftist violence and agitation, rightfully suspected to be funded by the Union of Britain, created further political strain on the government and lead to small far-right groups taking the fight to the leftists and Ulstermen themselves. As the 1930 elections arrived, the economy's sluggish performance and lack of growth was evident. Brugha’s administration had alienated Ulster by attempting to repeal some of its privilege, and further reduced its popularity by failure to do so.\n\nPresidency[]\n\nThe 1930 elections marked the return of Sinn Féin, buoyed by the tacit support of the UDP. Micheal Collins was elected President, with his long-time confidante and War of Independence leader Richard Mulcahy becoming Príomh-Aire. Collins, like his predecessors, felt that the road to fixing the economic woes lay with Germany, and so barriers to financial investment and trade were lowered. Fortunately for Collins, the gamble paid off and German investment flowed with the sale of the Belfast industries to German investors, seeing much needed capital finding its way into the government coffers. Soon enough Ireland’s economic prospects turned around and it entered the Mitteleuropa economic bloc with naught but more prosperity for the forseeable future, and Collins’ personal popularity booming at the expense of the imploding Cumann an tSaorstáit.\n\nIn the political arena, with a series of entirely legal, but barely-passed and heavily scrutinised referendums, Collins expanded the power of the Presidency at the expense of the power of the Dáil and the Príomh-Aire, citing a desire to move further away from the ‘flawed’ British system of democracy and towards that of America. Making use of his newfound political power, Collins clamped down hard on far-left and far-right agitators with Sinn Féin adopting a somewhat politically authoritarian and harsh law-and-order bent, in a bid to maintain Ireland’s influence from radicalism. Elsewhere though, the party became more socially liberal and urban-focused, loosening conservative restrictions of the Brugha administration, making Dublin one of Europe’s more cosmopolitan cities. This new “liberal” direction would not go unchallenged with the right of the party also opposing continued cooperation with the UDP, whose influence could be felt in the more hardline anti-syndicalist stance adopted at times. These inter-party tensions came to a head in May of 1931 when Eoin O’Duffy, the leader of an anti-Collins and anti-German faction within SF, would be sacked from his post as Gardai Commissioner, with Collins citing repeated incidents of alleged discrimination against Protestants in the North. Outraged, O’Duffy abandoned the party and much of the right-wing also left in solidarity.\n\nIn 1934, routine elections were held and Sinn Féin won yet again with 46% of the vote but just fell short of a full majority in the Dáil. Collins took the presidency once more and for the first time Ireland’s presidential history, the incumbent survived. Sinn Féin was quick to make arrangements with the Ulster Democratic Party to boost the government in a confidence and supply agreement, while making periodic deals with other parties on specific votes.\n\nAll boded well on the surface but underneath situations grew more tense. The nationalist and corporatist Aontas Náisiúnta had de facto entered the Dáil for the first time in 1934 and progressively chipped away, gaining other seats via by-elections, thus raising their profile in the media. Its influence in the Dáil was nonetheless stunted by the presence of the ever-growing, even more radical, Abstentionist faction within the party. While Aontas Náisiúnta grew and fractured, it would only manage to not be banned on account of de jure disbanding its paramilitary wing, the National Guard (known as the “Blueshirts”), though the Collins government kept a close eye on the organisation."
