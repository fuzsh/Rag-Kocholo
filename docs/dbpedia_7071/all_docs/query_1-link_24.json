        "text": "In the serene landscape of County Cork, near Clonakilty, lies the birthplace of Michael Collins, a key figure in the Irish struggle for independence. Born on October 16, 1890, in Woodfield, Sam’s Cross, Collins' early life was spent in a cottage that is now a National Monument.\n\nThe cottage, constructed in the mid-19th century, is a single-storey structure built of local stone. It was here that Collins spent his formative years before moving to London, where he became involved in radical Irish nationalist politics.\n\nThe cottage was burnt down in 1921 during the Irish War of Independence and was later rebuilt. Today, it stands as a museum, maintained by the Office of Public Works since 1990, offering visitors a glimpse into the life of this revolutionary leader.\n\nThe Michael Collins birthplace, with its rich history and unique architectural features, continues to captivate historians and visitors alike, providing a tangible link to Ireland's tumultuous past.\n\nVisit Historic Environment Viewer for more information on Michael Collins Birthplace\n\nProtect our Past - Click here to read about the importance of protecting our country’s unique heritage sites"
