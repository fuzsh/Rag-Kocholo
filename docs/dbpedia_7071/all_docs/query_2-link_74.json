        "text": "On July 20, 1969, as astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to land on the Moon, a third member of the crew waited in lunar orbit with a load of worry on his shoulders and a vital job to do. Without astronaut Michael Collins, Armstrong and Aldrin would never have made it to the Moon -- or home again.\n\nApollo 11 was Collins' second space flight; on the 1966 Gemini 10 mission with John W. Young (who later flew to the Moon on Apollo 16), Collins became the third person ever to perform an extra-vehicular activity, and the first to do it more than once. He served as capsule communicator, a vital link between Mission Control and the astronauts in space, for the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, which became the first to orbit the Moon.\n\nA few minutes after the Apollo 11 launch, it was up to Collins to pilot the command module, Columbia, through the maneuvers that would detach it from the third stage of the Saturn V rocket that had just carried them into space. That process uncovered the lunar landing module, Eagle, which had been tucked safely behind Columbia inside the third stage, and Collins had to turn Columbia around and position its nose to dock with the top of Eagle.\n\n\"This of course was a critical maneuver in the flight plan. If the separation and docking did not work, we would return to Earth. There was also the possibility of an in-space collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn third stage,\" Aldrin recalled later.\n\nAnd a few days later, while Armstrong and Aldrin took small steps and giant leaps down on the lunar surface, Collins orbited the Moon alone in Columbia, for 21.5 hours. During those solo orbits, Columbia's pilot experienced periods of the most profound solitude any human being has ever known: 48 minutes at a time alone on the far side of the Moon, with no radio contact with Earth or his crewmates and a 2100 mile-wide ball of rock between him and every other human who ever lived.\n\n\"If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the Moon, and one plus God-knows-what on this side,\" he recorded. Collins said afterward that he didn't feel lonely during those moments. The experience seems to have been more inspiring and exhilarating than frightening.\n\nBut for most of the 21.5 hours while he waited alone, circling the rocky sphere of the Moon, Collins worried about whether his crewmates would return. No one was certain that Eagle, the lunar landing module, would actually make it off the lunar surface. The module's ascent engine had never been tested on Moon, and Armstrong and Aldrin were taking a calculated gamble that the engine would fire at all, let alone burn long enough to get out of the Moon's gravity well and rendezvous with Columbia. Privately, the astronauts estimated the odds at around 50/50, but they went anyway.\n\nAs the lunar module separated from Columbia and began the descent to the Moon, Collins radioed his crewmates, \"Keep talking to me, guys.\" But a few minutes later, Columbia's orbit carried Collins around the curve of the Moon, out of radio contact with Armstrong, Aldrin, and every other human being in the universe, for the next 48 minutes.\n\nFor the next 21.5 hours, all Collins could do was watch and wait. He passed the time by recording notes on a tape recorder, including this one, from shortly before Eagle was due to blast off from the Moon: \"My secret terror for the last six months has been leaving them on the Moon and returning to Earth alone; now am within minutes of finding out the truth of the matter.\" So was everyone else on Earth, and NASA had prepared itself for a tragic contingency; President Nixon had a prepared speech to read in the event that the Eagle's ascent failed.\n\nCollins, too, had contemplated what life would be like if he returned to Earth alone, leaving his crewmates dead or, worse, doomed to wait for their air to run out on the Moon. He recorded, \"I am coming home, forthwith, but I will be a marked man for life and I know it.\"\n\nBut -- thanks in part to an hour or so of pulling unnecessary items, from urine bags to armrests to used scientific gear, out of the landing module and tossing them into a pile adjacent to the landing site -- Armstrong and Aldrin's spacecraft lifted them safely off the lunar surface and into orbit. They happened to rendezvous with Columbia on the far side of the Moon where Collins had spent a lonely 48 minutes out of every lunar orbit, with the satellite's bulk between them and the rest of humanity.\n\nLanding on the Moon had been up to Armstrong to pilot the lunar landing module on its descent, but the docking maneuver was entirely in the hands of Collins. This was the moment Collins had trained for while his crewmates learned to operate the landing module and practiced for the lunar excursion. All that training paid off, and after all those tense hours of worry, the three astronauts began the journey home together."
