        "text": "To say that 1999 was a year of excitement and uncertainty would be an understatement.

Latin rockers Santana found a new generation of fans with their massively popular comeback album, Supernatural. Rising acts like Zurdok and Control Machete found new opportunities for crossover success, while Ricky Martin had everyone “Livin’ La Vida Loca.”\n\nThe air was ripe with possibilities for electronic acts as well, with Moby, Fatboy Slim, and Underworld finding mainstream success, while hip-hop fans had plenty of incredible music to choose from, thanks to great albums by Dr. Dre, The Roots, and Eminem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Californication to TLC’s Fanmail, here are the best albums of 1999.\n\nCan’t get enough 90s music?
