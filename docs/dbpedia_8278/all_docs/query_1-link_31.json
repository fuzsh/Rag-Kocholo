        "text": "At the opening of House of Blues a few weeks back, I ran into an acquaintance of mine, a promoter. I don't recall most of the specifics of our conversation -- it was a long day, and I'd just run into some girl from \"Baywatch\" -- but I do remember asking her (the promoter, that is) if she thought the opening of this new venue would finally, irrevocably, open the Las Vegas market for club-sized shows. (If you think we get a lot of club acts, just open an LA Weekly, pal.) She answered immediately, but with another question.\n\n\"What touring act hasn't been here yet?\" she asked.\n\nNaturally, dear reader, I couldn't think of a single one. Five minutes later, they came in a flood -- Wilco, Fatboy Slim, Rufus Wainwright, The Verve, dozens of other performers from genres ranging from jazz to techno. Las Vegas certainly has the venues to accommodate them, now more than ever: The Joint, House of Blues, Fat Daddy's, Huntridge Theatre and its soon-to-open, club-sized adjunct, Sanctuary. But are this town's days as a Club Act Neverland truly nearing an end?\n\nI wasn't sure until The Residents announced they would be bringing their \"Wormwood\" tour to House of Blues. Other experimental bands have played Las Vegas -- mostly in the context of Doug Jablin and Tony Bondi's \"Soundhouse\" series -- but to have the Cadillac of those bands on the Strip ... well, it's got to be a good sign.\n\nFor the past quarter-century, The Residents have been the subversive party band of the way freaking beyond.\n\nYou want an eccentric history? The Residents scored a short film by Henry \"Nightmare Before Christmas\" Selick (\"Slow Bob in the Lower Dimensions\") and episodes of \"Pee Wee's Playhouse,\" were honored by the Museum of Modern Art, played only three live performances during their first decade and made diehard fans from both the arty-punk and punky-art crowds -- all without revealing their identities. Even now, their faces are hidden under human eyeball helmets.\n\nPlaying Las Vegas will only be a lateral jump in weirdness for The Residents. Certainly to their minds, it is just another House of Blues gig, albeit one that will doubtlessly have famous fans Penn and Teller grooving in the balcony. For Vegas, however, it's a weird and wonderful portent of the good stuff to come. It will -- spiritually, at least -- remove one of the few remaining obstacles that keep ours from being a club town: a lack of willingness to risk failure. The Residents may have been there and done that, but are by no means a household name.\n\nIf the April 22 show actually comes off, the performance by these wonderful men/women/whatever will prove an important benchmark. If the Residents can play here, Virginia, anybody -- or anything else -- can as well. I can't advise you strongly enough to buy those tickets now, fellow moles.\n\nCheck out residents.com for more of The Residents' saga.\n\nStereo dynamics\n\nVarious Artists, \"Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists,\" Rhino.\n\nThe compilation may bear the endorsement of Conde Nast's geeky black sheep, but don't be fooled: \"Music Futurists\" smacks more of Rhino than Wired. Only a company of audiophiles could assemble this tribute to music evolution, and only a company of audiophiles would bother to apologize for the absence of Leon Theremin, Kraftwerk, Afrika Bambaataa, Robert Moog and Frank Zappa.\n\nRhino's slogan, \"We collect records so you don't have to,\" has rarely been as appropriate as it is to \"Music Futurists.\" Starting with the chaotic space-age bachelor pop of Esquivel's \"Granada\" and careening through three decades to the turntable space of DJ Spooky's \"Thoughts Like Rain,\" this compilation doesn't miss a link in the chain. Here you'll find the druggy soundscapes of Todd Rundgren (\"International Feel/Never Never Land\"), the possibilities unlimited of Brian Eno (\"2/1\"), the young turks of the synth-pop revolution (Devo's \"Beautiful World,\" Thomas Dolby's \"She Blinded Me With Science\") and a number of other artists who didn't just push the envelope, but licked the sucker and mailed it.\n\nMy only cross with \"Music Futurists\" is the inclusion of Godley and Creme's \"Cry.\" Not to fault these pioneers -- the music they made with 10CC certainly qualifies them for inclusion, as does their groundbreaking video work. Nestled among Laurie Anderson's \"O Superman (For Massenet),\" Sonic Youth's \"Schizophrenia\" and Beck's \"Total Soul Future (Eat It),\" \"Cry\" sounds like what it is -- an overwrought adult contemporary exercise, spiced with some mildly interesting reverb-heavy guitar effects. The folks at Rhino should have tried harder to get the rights to Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock,\" and apologized to 10CC.\n\nGet up, Act Out\n\n* Eight o'clock tonight at the House of Blues: Los Angeles club favorite Young Dubliners play their big hearts out, supported by Wild Colonials. After that, on a separate ticket, drum 'n' bass warrior Roni Size throws down at 11:30. Call 632-7600.\n\n* Also tonight, at 9, at the Boston Bar and Grill: Local straight-up rockers Inside Scarlet, supported by hot youngsters Kickwurmz and Ces Jacuzzi. Call 369-0750.\n\n* Saturday: Bless mah soul, it's the Radiators and Dr. John! Enjoy an evening of what my friend Bryan lovingly calls \"swamp music,\" beginning at 8.\n\n* Also Saturday night, but musical light-years apart, popular space-lords Wise Monkey Orchestra play the Boston Bar and Grill with Gary Brown, at 9.\n\n* Tuesday brings The Beth Lisick Ordeal, a new band with the popular slam poet as its centerpiece, to the fabulous Fat Daddy's on Boulder Highway. Opening is Los Trios De Nada, the closest this town will ever come to having its very own, personal Tom Waits. These cats are goooooood. Call 464-3118.\n\narchive"
