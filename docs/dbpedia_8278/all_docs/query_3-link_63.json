        "text": "10 Songs That Had A Chokehold On The 90s. No escaping these earworms in the 90s. On radio, in the club, for better or worse they ruled the day. Many of these 10 songs that had a chokehold on the 90s were one-hit wonders, never to be heard again. A few were done by artists that continued to have somewhat successful careers afterward. In both cases, the world, for the most part, today knows their famous song better than the performer.\n\nWhat Makes A Song Have A Chokehold On An Entire Nation?\n\nIn the case of these songs, they all have a few things in common. First off, they all hit the charts in the 1990’s, a time when Generation X was coming of age. Musically, just about anything flew. Grunge, Metal, Alternative, Freestyle, Club Music, Techno, Industrial, Goth, Rap, Hip Hop, Country, and of course Pop music. So the landscape of American radio was vast, and hungry ears listening for something new were ripe for the picking, so to speak.\n\nAs you will see from this list, depth of message wasn’t always a prerequisite for these 10 songs that had a chokehold on the 90s. Nor was a prior success on the charts. Many of these artists came out of seemingly nowhere, and with one catchy tune with an ear-grabbing hook, heard over and over, played just about anywhere, became overnight sensations. Some relished the spotlight, while others remained enigmas, letting the song become the star.\n\nTo Be Honest, It Wasn’t Easy Keeping It At Just 10 Songs.\n\nAs we did our research, we realized two things: we had a lot of the same songs on our list, and each of us thought of valid songs the others had not! So we had to whittle these little earworms down to ten and let me tell you it wasn’t easy. There was a lot of yelling, filibustering, crying, whining, and even a few fist to cuffs! In the end, I’m proud of the list we’ve created, quite a bit more proud than I am that we, as a nation actually LOVED some of these babies. This is a perfect place to start our list of 10 songs that had a chokehold on the 90s!"
