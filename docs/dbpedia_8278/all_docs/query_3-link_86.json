Aided by a deliciously cheeky music video, the track stormed in at Number 1 in February, scoring 463,722 sales in its opening week, and finished the year on 1.45 million sales to be the UK's best-selling single of 1999.\n\nThe Max Martin-produced track kick-started a new ultra-slick style of pop from the US that would also earn Number 1 success in the UK for Backstreet Boys (May chart-topper I Want It That Way ranks 35th), and later *NSync and Pink.\n\nMORE: Official Top 40 biggest songs of 2021 so far\n\nBritney's follow-up single Sometimes - also released that year - wasn't quite the runaway hit of its predecessor, peaking at Number 3, but still places at 34 on the end-of-year Top 40. View Britney's Official UK Chart history in full here.\n\n1999 also saw the rise of Europop dominating the airwaves and charts. Italian dance group Eiffel 65 scored the year's second best-selling track with three-week Number 1 Blue (956k), German DJ ATB ranks fifth with summer smash 9pm (Til I Come) (791k), French musician Mr Oizo is at 9 with Flat Beat (678k) (a Number 1 thanks to its use in a Levi's advert), and Dutch outfit Alice Deejay land just outside the Top 10 at 12 with Better Off Alone.\n\nAnother act waving the flag four Europop that year was Vengaboys, who claim three entries in the end-of-year Top 40: Number 1s Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!! (15) and We're Going To Ibiza! (38), while Top 3 smash We Like To Party! (The Vengabus) places at 29.\n\nLatin-inspired music was also on the rise in 1999, including Lou Bega's two-week Number 1 Mambo No.5 (A Little Bit Of...), the year's fourth best-seller (850k), and Ricky Martin's Livin' La Vida Loca at 6 (776k), which spent three weeks at the top in July.\n\nMORE: Official Top 40 best-selling singles of 1998\n\nElsewhere, UK outfit Shanks & Bigfoot place at Number 8 with Sweet Like Chocolate (707k), the UK's first garage Number 1 in May, while several British pop acts scored big: S Club 7 with their first release Bring It All Back (11), former Eastenders star Martine McCutcheon topped the chart with her debut single Perfect Moment (14), and Steps with their first chart-topper Heartbeat/Tragedy (19).\n\nFinally, plenty of US stars also enjoyed UK success in 1999, including Christina Aguilera with her debut effort Genie In A Bottle (13), R&B trio TLC scored a long-running Top 40 hit with No Scrubs (16) and Whitney Houston enjoyed two sizeable hits with My Love Is Your Love (22), and It's Not Right, But It's Okay (25).\n\nOfficial Top 40 best-selling songs of 1999\n\nTITLE ARTIST PEAK 1 BABY ONE MORE TIME BRITNEY SPEARS 1 2 BLUE (DA BA DEE) EIFFEL 65 1 3 THE MILLENNIUM PRAYER CLIFF RICHARD 1 4 MAMBO NO.5 (A LITTLE BIT OF...)
