        "text": "​30 years of the world wide web: What are we celebrating?\n\nSaying March 2019 is the 30th anniversary of the internet can sound arbitrary. After all, ARPANET was the first computer network, and it went online in 1969. Also, TCP/IP was invented in 1983.\n\nSo why is the world celebrating the 30th anniversary of the internet in March 2019? Because of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, whose March 1989 proposal to CERN first laid out the concepts that would become the HTML programming language, web URLs, and HTTP.\n\nHTML, URLs, and HTTP are still the foundation of the internet, which is why we can credit Tim Berners-Lee with the creation of the modern internet 30 years ago, in March 1989.\n\nSince Berners-Lee laid the first bricks in what would become the world wide web, it has changed dramatically. There are a lot of firsts to celebrate in the 30 years that the internet has been around, and these 23 items are just some of the most important milestones.\n\nSEE: Video: Tim Berners-Lee wants to fix the web, 30 years on (TechRepublic)\n\nImage: CERN\n\n​1989: The first commercial internet service providers\n\nIt didn’t take long for commercial ISPs to spring up, despite not having much to connect to on the fledgling collection of servers that was the internet. Two such services claim to be the world’s first ISP: DIALix, which claims to have been offering Australia-wide service in September 1989, and Boston-based The World reportedly brought its first customer online in November 1989.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Brandon Vigliarolo/TechRepublic\n\n​1990: The first web browser\n\nPrimitive by any modern interpretation, the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was built by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. It only ran on a single machine (a NeXT computer), but luckily for those of us browsing the web in 2019 it was rebuilt to run inside a modern web browser.\n\nCheck it out here, and be sure to navigate to your favorite website (Document | Open From Full Document Reference | URL) to see how it looks without any of its modern features.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Brandon Vigliarolo/TechRepublic\n\n​1994: The first blog\n\nBlogs: Who hasn’t thought about starting a blog at some point? If you’ve been bitten by the blogging bug, you have journalist Justin Hall to thank for it: He was the internet’s first blogger.\n\nJustin started Links From Underground in 1994, mainly to blog about his life and share websites he thought were interesting. Hall is still blogging on www.links.net, where you can read his musings from today all the way back to 15 years ago.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Brandon Vigliarolo/TechRepublic\n\n​1994: The first web hosting service\n\nAs Justin Hall pointed out on an early version of Links From Underground, his website was running on a Mac PowerBook from his Swarthmore College dorm room.\n\nThose of us unable, or unwilling, to host a website on our personal computers in early 1994 just had to wait a few months for the mother of all early internet websites, and the first-ever web hosting service, to launch: GeoCities.\n\nNow in its final days, GeoCities has fallen from the height of its purchase by Yahoo in 1999, when it was arguably the most popular web hosting service around. As TechRepublic sister site CNET points out, Yahoo Japan is pulling the plug on GeoCities (it’s still available in Japan, though not in the US) on March 31, 2019, bringing an end to one of the most influential web services in the history of the internet.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: CNET\n\n​1994: First ecommerce site\n\nIf you attempt to navigate to Books.com today, you’ll be redirected to Barnes & Noble, but in 1994, that URL would take you to the internet home of Book Stacks Unlimited, the first real ecommerce site.\n\nBook Stacks Unlimited existed as early as 1992, selling books via dial-up bulletin board systems (BBS), but launched its website in 1994.\n\nIt’s difficult to place the exact timing of the earliest ecommerce transactions, and if Books.com did beat Netmarket to the punch, it still lost out to NetMarket’s win as the first encrypted ecommerce transaction.\n\nEither way, 1994 was a banner year for online sales, with books and CDs (NetMarket’s first sale was a Sting album) being available on the web years before Amazon was a twinkle in Jeff Bezos’ eye.\n\nPictured: Book Stacks Unlimited founder Charles Stack\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Flashstarts\n\n​1994: The origin of the modern internet forum\n\nBulletin Board Systems, also called BBS, were around well before the birth of the modern internet, but they aren’t exactly the same as modern internet forums, which came into being in 1994.\n\nThe World Wide Web Interactive Talk (WIT) forum software was born out of the need for easier internal collaboration (PDF) at the World Wide Web Consortium. It was the first software to resemble the modern internet forum, with its individuated forums, posts, and replies that function as discussion threads that we’re all used to today.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Brandon Vigliarolo/TechRepublic\n\n​1994: The first online banner ad\n\nOn October 27, 1994, Wired’s original website, Hotwired, launched with a bunch of advertisements that were an internet first: Banner ads.\n\nIt’s impossible to determine which of the pool of banner ads Hotwired served up first, but AT&T’s banner ad has become the one most commonly referred to as “the first banner ad.”\n\nIt was plain, simply tempting users to click “right HERE.” The ad made no mention of AT&T until a user clicked it, at which point it displayed an advertising page that linked to more information about AT&T, online tours of world art museums, and a feedback form.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the ads of today, but one thing remains the same: It’s built to entice you to click. Admit it–you wanted to.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Thefirstbannerad.com\n\n​1996: The first user-friendly webmail\n\nIt may not have been the first webmail platform, but Hotmail gets credit for being the first ready-to-use webmail service that didn’t involve running Perl scripts on a UNIX machine to display email in a web browser.\n\nHotmail, which got its name from HTML, came to be in 1996, and email was never the same–it’s hard to find someone who chooses to use a locally-installed mail client when web-based services like Gmail are so simple and feature rich.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: CNET\n\n​1997: The first social media site\n\nSocial media may have found its stride in the form of Myspace and Facebook, but it was around years before either of those two services in the form of SixDegrees.\n\nSixDegrees was the first website to feature user profiles, friend lists, school affiliations, and other features familiar to social media users. It’s still around, and new users still need a referral code from a current user to join–talk about exclusive.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: CBS News\n\n​1999: The rise of file sharing\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing exploded in popularity with the 1999 launch of Napster.\n\nAnyone with an internet connection in 1999 likely remembers the early days of downloading music on a 56k connection, waiting around a quarter of an hour or more to get a single song.\n\nMuch of what we experience now in the modern music industry is thanks to Napster, which still exists today, though in name only: The Napster brand is what became of Rhapsody.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: Reddit\n\n​2002: The birth of the modern smartphone\n\nThere were many devices that could be called smartphones prior to 2002, but that was the year things truly changed, signaling a shift away from computers and toward mobile browsing for the masses.\n\nThis is a contentious claim to make, but the T-Mobile Sidekick, also known as the Danger Hiptop, was the device to lead that charge. Released in October 2002, the Sidekick preempted the flagship smartphone of the early 2000s, the BlackBerry Quark, by a few months and offered many of the same features, like an integrated phone, web browsing, and email capabilities.\n\nWhichever device you choose to call the first modern smartphone, it’s late 2002 or early 2003 that changed the internet in a big way.\n\nSee: More must-read Tech History coverage (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\nImage: CNET\n\n​A future of firsts\n\ntAt TechRepublic sister site CNET, Dan Ackerman said that the world wide web at 30 feels a lot like the early days, and while he may have been talking about the future of innovation I’m bringing it back a bit: There hasn’t been a lot of truly revolutionary stuff on the internet since the early 2000s.\n\ntThe smartphone changed the internet in perhaps the biggest way since the launch of GeoCities, but “firsts” have been largely absent since then. We have new social media platforms, faster Wi-Fi, better phones, and cloud computing, but let’s be real–those are all just rehashes of older innovations.\n\ntAckerman is hopeful for the future of the internet. I’m not so sure, but I do agree with him that a lot of the new internet feels like the same “boiler room salesmanship of pre-Dotcom Bust era.”\n\ntOne thing is for sure: We need some more internet firsts to push the world wide web out of its current funk.\n\nAlso see\n\nt\n\nWeb programming languages: How WebAssembly will change the way you build web apps (TechRepublic)\n\nt\n\nThe Web turns 30: Dream or nightmare?
