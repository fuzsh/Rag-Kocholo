        "text": "Is this the first time an album has been lavishly rereleased on the round-number anniversary of its title? I can’t say. But here’s the math: Prince’s “1999,” the album that made him a rock star before “Purple Rain” made him a mass pop star, came out in 1982. That’s 37 years ago, though the music still sounds contemporary and alive.\n\nPrince’s fifth album, “1999” was apocalyptic, sexy, funky, funny, innovative, earthy, electronic, sly, righteous, euphoric and almost entirely — give or take a few vocals and a guitar solo — a one-man show by Prince Rogers Nelson on every instrument and vocal. Every song exults in the architectural savvy of a musician who, from the drumbeat up, seemed to know exactly how he’d be jamming with himself as he built the song.\n\nIn 1982, few people were thinking much about the change of the millennium. For the title song of “1999,” Prince envisioned something worse than the Y2K bug: nuclear annihilation as the calendar flipped, because “Everybody’s got a bomb/We could all die any day.” But Prince had other plans. He was going to “dance my life away” and “party like it’s 1999.” As always, Prince chose pleasure over fear.\n\nThe “super deluxe” version of the “1999” reissue — five CDs or 10 LPs plus a grainy DVD video of a 1982 concert in Houston — reaches into Prince’s vault of unreleased recordings, unveiling a dozen songs that haven’t appeared officially in any form, although Prince performed some of them live. A handful — including the absolute standout, “Purple Music” — are gems; none is a dud. Other vault material includes alternate takes of previously released songs, usually quite different from what appeared during Prince’s lifetime. (Other configurations of the reissue don’t include the vault material, but the songs will be streaming online.) The big package also includes a 1982 live recording from Detroit; side by side with the concert DVD from Houston, it reveals both the band’s tight cues and how improvisational Prince could be.\n\nThe newly released vault material doesn’t challenge the choices Prince made about “1999” (though I’d have been tempted to swap in “Moonbeam Levels,” a stately plea for humanity, for “Free” on “1999”). The alternate takes of the album’s songs were less adventurous than the versions Prince chose for the album. But Prince on his most ordinary day was better than countless musicians at their best, and now that he’s gone, being able to hear more Prince equals more pleasure.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
