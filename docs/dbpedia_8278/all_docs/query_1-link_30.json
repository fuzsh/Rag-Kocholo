        "text": "An Audio Timeline A selection of significant events, inventions, products and their purveyors,from cylinder to DVD\n\nThe road that leads us from Edison's tin-foil cylinder to today's audio DVD is a fascinating avenue crammed with remarkable people, inventions and innovations. Our past accomplishments contribute to what we are today, and signpost the future as a never-ending quest to push the envelope of what is possible in audio.\n\nIn 1997 the Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the AES was formed to increase the awareness of where we have been and what we have accomplished. Part of that effort was directed to the creation of an Audio Timeline, compiled by Jerry Bruck, the late Al Grundy, and Irv Joel. It is intended to be a selection of significant events, inventions, products and their purveyors.\n\nThis Timeline is not complete, and probably never could be, given the wealth of discoveries, inventions and innovative products that did and do appear almost daily. Nor are the dates given always precise, depending as they often do on second hand documents or dim memories.\n\nIts authors would welcome any substantiated corrections or additions to this timeline, for imperfect as it must be, it serves as both backbone and DNA in the evolution of our industry. Please send your comments to us.\n\nWe hope you will return to this page often to check on the evolution of our Timeline, as the first of many pieces to be generated by the Historical Committee as this Site expands.\n\n1877\n\nThomas Alva Edison, working in his lab, succeeds in recovering Mary's Little Lamb from a strip of tinfoil wrapped around a spinning cylinder.\n\nHe demonstrates his invention in the offices of Scientific American, and the phonograph is born.\n\n1878\n\nThe first music is put on record: cornetist Jules Levy plays \"Yankee Doodle.\"\n\n1881\n\nClement Ader, using carbon microphones and armature headphones, accidentally produces a stereo effect when listeners outside the hall monitor adjacent telephone lines linked to stage mikes at the Paris Opera.\n\n1887\n\nEmile Berliner is granted a patent on a flat-disc gramophone, making the production of multiple copies practical.\n\n1888\n\nEdison introduces an electric motor-driven phonograph.\n\n1895\n\nMarconi successfully experiments with his wireless telegraphy system in Italy, leading to the first transatlantic signals from Poldhu, Cornwall, UK to St. John's, Newfoundland in 1901.\n\n1898\n\nValdemar Poulsen patents his \"Telegraphone,\" recording magnetically on steel wire.\n\n1900\n\nPoulsen unveils his invention to the public at the Paris Exposition.
