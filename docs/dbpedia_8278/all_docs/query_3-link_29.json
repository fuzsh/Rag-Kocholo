        "text": "26. 20Ten (2010) I was frustrated trying to get my hands on this one for a while. He gave this album away as a CD in a British magazine and it wasn’t available online at all. Not for download, not for physical purchase - nothing. A really strange move when you think about it from the standpoint that from 2007-2014 he only gave us 3 subpar LPs for purchase - all of which I have in the bottom 6 on this list. It’s the roughest spell of his career. But as it turns out in addition to all the stuff that’s still likely in the vault he did indeed record two really good albums in 2010 - we just didn’t get to hear them until years later. 20Ten is finally available now and it’s really good right from the fun Let’s Pretend We’re Married-ish rhythm of lead track Compassion straight through to the end. Not sure there are many “classics” here, but it’s a very solid listen and he sounds more inspired than the previous three albums.\n\n20. Art Official Age (2014) The next three (and the last three) LPs all land right in the middle of the list. They’re all great and this one was released on the same day as PLECTRUMELECTRUM. Prince doesn’t sound like he’s pressing - he sounds revitalized and having fun after a couple years off. It’s nice to hear him at another creative peak in the years just before he tragically passed. Funknroll just feels like a Prince classic - the first since Black Sweat 8 years earlier in my opinion. Sometimes you just know it when you hear it - a nasty groove that doesn’t sound like anything you’ve heard before. He actually put another more rock version of it on the PLECTRUMELECTRUM album but this is the superior version. The full medley performance on SNL (his 4th and final performance on the show) with his 3RDEYEGIRL band of Clouds, Marz, and Anotherlove was a great return with songs from both albums. The Gold Standard and U Know are two highlights from the album that really bring it - he’s pushing ahead here creating new sounds instead of recycling. Granted even recycled Prince grooves are great, but a song like U Know expands your mind a little - that’s when he’s at his best.\n\n13. Come (1994) Not sure most would rank this one so high but I love it. No nonsense grooves - not a ton of elaborate arrangements - just a lot of funk. Another contractual obligation record and the last release for Warner Brothers. I was living in Cleveland when this one came out and I played the crap out of it. I think part of what I liked about it is it felt like a throwback after the grandiose statements of Diamonds & Pearls and the Love Symbol Albums - no NPG, no rapping, no wild swings in styles (or at least mood) from track to track. It also had the black and white cover which he only did with Dirty Mind and Parade before that, and the fact that he credited it to Prince when he was no longer going by Prince (even listing Prince’s lifespan as 1958-1993) all gave it a throwback vibe to me. Will this album sound so great without that context? I say yes. The title track is an epic - an 11 minute opener. The only throwaway is Solo - just a solo vocal performance that doesn’t really warrant much attention in my opinion, but everything else here is fantastic. Pheremone, Loose! & Race are the jams while Space, Dark and Letitgo are the grooves.\n\n10. New Power Soul (1998) Okay well maybe you’re looking at “what’s ahead” and here you’re like wait, huh? This album isn’t even credited to Prince - he credits it to the New Power Generation but then again he wasn’t going by “Prince” at this time anyway… Meanwhile this is a criminally overlooked gem just like The Slaughterhouse but maybe even more so since this one was indeed commercially released…..and flopped. Mad Sex sounds like one of those Prince classics - another unique stuttering funky groove that hits right away. Not a dud in this set - When U Love Somebody has that I Wanna Be Your Lover vibe - a great pop gem with a little surprise jam segment at the end. Then the vibe a la Slaughterhouse comes with Push It Up - oh yeah… this joint just builds and builds and just gets SO hype with Larry Graham & Chaka Khan adding vocals and Doug E. Fresh providing the rap! Then it slides into the next two grooves Freaks On This Side and Come On. Oh man… The last three tracks are all amazing as well - The One is an epic slow burn, (I Like) Funky Music is as funky as anything Prince ever laid down - sometimes that just happens with his alter ego Camille shows up, and then there’s the seductive hidden track Wasted Kisses to close it out. Yes - this is absolutely a top 10 Prince album for me. Don’t @ me. Odds are if you know, you know.\n\n8. 3121 (2006) This album should have been way bigger than it was. It’s the best latter day Prince album and he promoted it with his third SNL appearance with a kick ass performance of Fury and the duet track Beautiful Loved and Blessed with Tamar Davis (Prince never stopped promoting female protegés like he did with Vanity, Apollonia, Cat, & Mayte but his magic touch started to wane when it came to their success by the time he featured Tamar and Bria Valente). The album actually debuted at #1 in the U.S. but while I remember hearing Black Sweat here and there it’s not like I remember it being a massive hit…. is it me? Anyway, 3121 was the address of a rental property in L.A. Prince was using but he frames it as an idea/ideal - a place where “U can come if U want 2 but U can never leave…” borrowing from Hotel California perhaps? The aforementioned Black Sweat is another of those Prince classics - a defining track sung in his unmistakeable falsetto. The Word is just so silky smooth, Love is funky as can be, Get On The Boat a great call to action closer that gets you out of your seat… another album with no filler, no missteps.\n\n4. Emancipation (1996) Prince finally gaining control of his destiny. Getting away from Warner Brothers and being able to release as much material as he wanted when he wanted, and boy did he unleash here. A full three hours of new originals (save for 4 covers) in a three CD set, Emancipation is incredible. You can sort of breakdown the first 12 songs (CD1) as a great variety of tunes with multiple styles, the second 12 songs (CD2) as the mellow middle and the third 12 (CD3) as the JAMS. Almost ALL 36 songs are fantastic. I don’t even know where to begin with this one… I will say the 4 jams (Slave, New World, The Human Body, Face Down) that lead the 3rd disc are incredible… but don’t skip to them. Just listen to the whole thing if you haven’t. You don’t have to do it in one three hour sitting obviously but take the whole thing in from beginning to end, rinse, repeat. You can easily process it in thirds - that’s probably best. Jam Of The Year, In This Bed I Scream, Joint 2 Joint, One Kiss At A Time - just so many strong songs. No real hits and not a HUGE seller, this was another Prince album that deserved better.\n\n3. 1999 (1982) “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you….” Prince’s first magnum opus - a sprawling double album that really made him a star with multiple hits like the title track, Little Red Corvette and Delirious. I saw this tour in the 5th row on the main floor at Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor with The Time and Vanity 6. I’ll never forget it. An album with plenty of funk and a bit of mystery, you could easily make a case for this being in the top spot as well along with either of the two I have above it. The title track is a perfect single, funky and with the catchiest chorus (about the apocalypse) you’ll ever hear in your life. Little Red Corvette - with that percussive & unmistakeable ch-ch-chhhh and the swing of Delirious which is a style Prince always kicks ass with - this is the standard for those… What a start! But then things really get epic with the 7+, 8+, & 9+ minute workouts D.M.S.R. (the ultimate party jam), the deliciously dirty Let’s Pretend We’re Married, and Automatic with that hypnotically mesmerizing A-U-T-O-MATIC refrain. Prince is totally inside your head at this point…and there’s still 30 minutes of genius to go. You could kinda say Something In The Water (Does Not Compute) & All The Critics Love U In New York (with the mysteriously missing lyrics on the lyric sleeve) are slighter tracks - maybe even filler (?) and yet I still LOVE both of those tracks. The other three remaining tracks are massive - Free an incredible ballad, Lady Cab Driver an epic funky groove, and International Lover the perfectly seductive lounge closer with your pilot Prince guiding you in for the perfect landing. Oh - and can we give a shout out to the fantastic B-Side Irresistible Bitch which the Electrifying Mojo here in Detroit turned over and played on WJLB making that a bona fide local hit as well? Was that on the radio in your town too? 1999 was given the official podcast treatment by the estate along with a posthumous super deluxe reissue - all worth listening to.\n\n2. Sign O The Times (1987) Prince breaks away from the Revolution as his backing band here and crafts a masterpiece for the ages. So many classics here and the appearance of Prince’s alter ego Camille on a handful of tracks. So much has been said and written about this album it’s hard to add anything here, but it’s just such a marvel with such advanced lyrical themes and musical styles it still blows my mind. Prince said things that just seemed to never have been said before such as in If I Was Your Girlfriend - he wants to have the type of relationship where she can tell him anything - the types of things she would tell her girlfriends…genius the way he lays it out and he does it as the androgynous Camille. The opener is an all timer with that bouncy bass line that kicks things off with a reference to the AIDS crisis and proceeds to ruminate on the apocalypse, gangs, drugs, and anything else on his mind, in the end saying oh well let’s get married and have a baby anyway and “we’ll call him Nate if it’s a boy”. I usually shy away from the occasional Prince overt religious song like The Ladder or Last December, but The Cross is just too good to deny. One of the few gospel songs I love. I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man is a towering achievement - Prince in the role of the gentleman telling a girl he knows a one night stand isn’t the right move for her with a perfect hook and an awesome extended guitar midsection. Forever In My Life is such a simple structure - stripped down and no frills - just a focus on a pouring out of the heart to tell someone in no uncertain terms that he wants them forever in his life. You just have to drop what you’re doing and sing the whole thing with all the emotion you’ve got when you hear it. Hot Thing, It, It’s Gonna Be A Beautiful Night, Housequake - all bangers, and then there’s ADORE (caps added by me). Adore….considered by some to be the best Prince slow jam of all time and it’s hard to argue. I’m realizing I’m all over the place on this one but that’s appropriate - mind racing covering all the things I love about this album. Strange Relationship and The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker just make you feel sophisticated when you listen to them. Strange Relationship for the brilliant lyrics and the complicated nature of the relationship he (Camille though) is singing about, and Dorothy Parker for how incredibly vivid the storytelling is. What a seduction! He says cool I’ll take a bath but I’m leaving my pants on cuz I’m kinda going with someone - she says “sounds like a real man to me” and at some point his phone rings and she says “whoever’s calling can’t be as cute as you” and right then and there he knew he was through… all of this over the coolest jazzy jam with those percussion fills - I mean, it’s just brilliant man. You can’t overlook the wonderful and slightly trippy nursery rhyme of Starfish and Coffee - Cynthia Rose who stood at the back of the line with a smile beneath her nose? Love it. I could go on and on about this album - I started off saying it’s hard to add anything about it, but once I get going it’s hard to stop. Check out the Super Deluxe version which includes a ton of extras including the sensational B-sides Shockadelica, La, La La, He, He, Hee and the estate gave this one the official podcast treatment as well. Oh - I almost forgot about U Got The Look too…\n\n1. Purple Rain (1984) If 1999 made Prince a star, Purple Rain made him a king. The most famous Prince album with the most famous Prince songs (and the best B-sides) as the soundtrack to the most famous Prince movie and it still holds up all the way through. For my money it’s the best album of the 80’s. The end. Rolling Stone has it #2 behind London Calling but I (dis)respectfully disagree. Not to mention the best two B-sides ever released in music history from one album’s singles in Erotic City and 17 Days and it’s not even close. The man was just churning out the greatest songs at an otherworldly clip. When Prince first addresses us all as “Dearly Beloved…” we know he means business. Is there a simpler call to action than Let’s Go Crazy? Let’s get NUTS? Hell yes - let’s do it. What an opener. Take Me With U evokes those images of Prince riding his fancy bike with Apollonia on the back as the leaves scatter… and then comes The Beautiful Ones… OMG. What a vocal. H.E.R. performed this at the Grammy tribute to Prince with Misty Copeland dancing which I thought was very cool. Wendy and Lisa lead us into the rocker Computer Blue which kicks ass followed by the amazing raunch of Darling Nikki. I think it took balls even for Prince to put Darling Nikki on an album with so much at stake, and while I don’t think he looked at it that way, to have one of the best selling albums of all time with those lyrics on it back then? Whoa - and sure enough it ruffled some feathers helping to lead to “Parental Advisory” tags on albums. Next is the masterstroke of When Doves Cry - with no bass and that industrial sounding snare that was such a staple of Prince’s sound in the early days - SO COOL. One the best songs of all time period. Dig (if you will) the picture of you and I engaged in a kiss… Wow. Not to mention that video! And then the party starts - I Would Die 4 U and Baby I’m A Star - you can’t really have one without the other. These two along with the towering Purple Rain title track were all recorded live in Minneapolis and the footage exists of Purple Rain. Not the best quality but it’s still incredible to watch with subtitles explaining where the edits are including the third scrapped verse (I’m pretty sure it’s real - not an official release). Then there’s the Super Bowl halftime in 2007 when Prince performed Purple Rain in the POURING rain. One of the most memorable moments to be sure. Purple Rain was the last song Prince ever played live a week before he died. …and now I’m getting choked up. One of the greatest songs ever written on one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe writing of this list was a joy. Spending all this time going through his entire catalogue like this has been a labor of love and I hope you enjoyed it! Please share it, comment with your favorites below and keep listening to Prince! As he would say, May U Live 2 See the Dawn!"
