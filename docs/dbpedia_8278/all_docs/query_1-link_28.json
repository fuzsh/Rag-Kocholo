        "text": "The rush to the ever-expanding western frontier and the first signs of the American \"melting pot\" of heterogeneous cultures begin. Westward migration is fraught with difficulties. The first explorers, primarily men, drive westward, conquering and incorporating cultures as they go. Later, as women and children begin to migrate, so does \"polite culture.\" Newspapers, publishing houses, the telegraph, and the railroad contribute to the distribution of information. America is so large that regional differences begin to appear. This is particularly evident in folk traditions and musical favorites. Waves of immigrants come to America, some involuntarily as slaves, others seeking relief from tyranny or poverty. The immigrants tend to settle in areas that remind them of their former homes. With them they bring the instruments most important to them and most easily transportable. Amid the novelty of their new homes they cling to the cultures of their origins as a means of stability. Ballads and tunes from home blend with the new American stories; morality songs and parables intermingle and new oral traditions are created. Music and stories are handed down from generation to generation orally, but popular music publishing carries on nevertheless. Music schools are rarely seen outside the cities. In the first half of the century, newspapers, song sheets, and songsters print song lyrics, but music notation is usually neglected in favor of the mnemonic cue \"sung to the tune of . . . .\" Printed music (vocal as well as instrumental) is slower to expand. Music is integral to American life in the 19th century. All aspects of life are celebrated in song. Musicians, especially those who learn by listening and imitating, not by reading from a printed score, subtly incorporate sounds from surrounding cultures. Thus, the true \"country music\" of America begins.\n\nJesse Walter Fewkes makes cylinder recordings of the Possamaquoddy Indians. These are considered to be the first ethnographic recordings of Native American music.\n\nLearn More: Information on the The Jesse Walter Fewkes field recordings of the Passamaquoddy Indians - information on this recording as one of the 2002 Registry choices.\n\nJohn Lomax, honorary consultant and curator for the fledgling Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress, and his wife, Ruby, begin a southern states recording tour. They record hundreds of performances of ballads, blues, cowboy songs, field hollers, spirituals, and work songs in nine southern states. Many ethnomusicologists consider the recordings made on this field trip to be among the most important in this genre.\n\nLearn More: The John and Ruby Lomax 1939 Southern States Recording Trip - a multiformat ethnographic field collection that includes nearly 700 sound recordings, as well as fieldnotes, dust jackets, and other manuscripts documenting a three-month, 6,502-mile trip through the southern United States\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry makes its first network broadcast on NBC. The first host is Roy Acuff. Acuff records his first hit record, \"Great Speckled Bird,\" this same year."
