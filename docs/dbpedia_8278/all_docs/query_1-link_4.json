        "text": "Read this history of music and find a timeline of milestones in the music industry, dating from 325 to the present day\n\nConstantine declares Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. The spread of Christianity in the western world spurred the development of European music.\n\nPope Gregory the Great codifies and collects the chant, which is used in Roman Catholic services and is named the Gregorian chant in his honor.\n\nWestern music begins to move from monophony to polyphony with the vocal parts in church music moving in parallel intervals.\n\nGuido of Arezzo, an Italian monk, develops a system for learning music by ear. Voice students often use the system, called solfège, to memorize their vocal exercises. In the 19th century, solf ège developed into the tonic sol-fa system used today.\n\nTroubadours appear in Germany and call themselves minnesingers, “singers about love.”\n\nThe Renaissance begins. This rebirth favors the simplistic virtues of Greek and Roman Classic styles, moves from polyphony to one harmonized melody and sees the increased importance and popularity of secular music. Josquin Desprez, often called the Prince of Music, is a leading composer of the Renaissance. He worked for ducal courts in Italy and France, at the Sistine Chapel and for kings Louis XI and Louis XII.\n\nIn Pope Pius IV's Counter-Reformation, he restores church music to its pure vocal form by eliminating all instruments except the organ, any evidence of secularism, harmony and folk melody. Giovanni Da Palestrina satisfies the pope's rigid requirements and creates a new spiritual style that legend says “saved polyphony” when he writes Pope Marcellus Mass, his most famous and enchanting piece.\n\nIn Italian music, castration emerges as a way of preserving high male singing voices. St. Paul's dictum prohibited women from singing on stage and in churches. The practice becomes commonplace by 1574.\n\nThe English Madrigal School is firmly established. The movement, led by Thomas Morley, produces some of the most delightful secular music ever heard. Madrigals often told stories of love or grief.\n\nA group of musicians and intellectuals gather in Count Giovanni de Bardi's camerata (salon) and discuss and experiment with music drama. It is during this period that opera is born. Jacopo Peri's Dafne, the first Italian opera, is produced in 1598 and Euridice in 1600.\n\nThe Baroque period, characterized by strict musical forms and highly ornamental works, begins in Europe. This period signals the end of the Renaissance.\n\nItalian master composer Claudio Monteverdi writes the opera Orfeo, Favola in Musica, a work deemed to be a prime example of the early Baroque musical form.\n\nFrancesca Caccini, who most historians say is the first female composer, finishes the opera-ballet La Liberazione di Ruggiero, which is performed at a reception for Wladyslaw IV of Poland.\n\nProfessional female singers appear for the first time on the English stage in the production of Chloridia, a court masque produced by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones.\n\nThe first comic opera, Chi Soffre Speri by Virgilio Mazzocchi and Marco Marazzoli, premieres in Rome.\n\nHenry Lawes and Matthew Locke add music to William Davenant's libretto The Siege of Rhodes, which is performed at the Rutland House in London. Davenant helps make the opera-masque a form of public entertainment.\n\nThe first signed Stradivarius violins emerge from Antonio Stradivari's workshop in Cremona, Italy.\n\nMatthew Locke composes Psyche, the first surviving English opera.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach and George Frederick Handel are born. They become principal classical composers of the Baroque period. Bach, who fathers 20 children, explores musical forms associated with the church and Handel works as a dramatic composer.\n\nHenry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas opens in London.\n\nVivaldi becomes violin master at Venice's La Pieta orphanage. He writes more then 400 concertos for La Pieta in his 35-year service there.\n\nReinhard Keiser uses French horns for the first time in opera in his production of Octavia.\n\nVivaldi writes The Four Seasons.\n\nThe comic opera, La Serva Padrona, from Battista Pergolesi's serious opera Il Prigionier Superbo, wows Europe with its humorous story and enchanting music.\n\nHandel produces his last great operatic success, Alcina, which features dancer Marie Salle.\n\nHandel's Messiah premieres in Dublin to an enthusiastic audience.\n\nBach dies. The end of the Baroque period is often seen in conjunction with his death. The highly ornate style of the Baroque period gives rise to the more simple, clarified styles of the Classical period, which sees the emergence of symphonies and string quartets.\n\nFranz Joseph Haydn becomes Vice-Kapellmeister to the Esterhazy family and Kapellmeister in 1766. Though living virtually as a slave to the family, he had at his disposal an impressive orchestra. During his 30-year service to the family, he completes 108 symphonies, 68 string quartets, 47 piano sonatas, 26 operas, 4 oratorios and hundreds of smaller pieces.\n\nChristoph Willibald von Glück sets out to reform opera with his Orfeo ed Euridice. He wants to restore opera to what the original composers intended it to be—an art form marked by high drama, few recitatives and orchestral set-pieces.\n\nMozart's The Marriage of Figaro premieres in Vienna.\n\nMozart's Don Giovanni debuts in Prague.\n\nFranz Peter Schubert is born in Vienna. Though many musicians make Vienna their home, Schubert is the only one to be born there.\n\nBeethoven produces his third symphony, Eröica. This piece marks the beginning of the Romantic period, in which the formality of the Classical period is replaced by subjectivity.\n\nBeethoven completes his Symphony No. 5, which many consider to be the most popular classical work ever written.\n\nRobert Schumann is born in Germany.\n\nSchubert writes “Der Erlkönig,” his first public success and most famous song.\n\nGioacchino Rossini's The Barber of Seville, based on Pierre Beaumarchais's play, debuts in Rome. His Otello opens in Naples.\n\nBeethoven's hearing has deteriorated so badly that he no longer can hear the piano and must communicate with conversation books.\n\nCarl Maria von Weber's Der Freischutz debuts in Berlin, and he becomes the master of German opera.\n\nMendelssohn writes the overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream, which debuts in Stettin in 1827.\n\nSchumann's career as a pianist is over as one of his fingers becomes paralyzed.\n\nThe New York Philharmonic is established.\n\nVerdi's Rigoletto debuts in Venice.\n\nRichard Wagner publishes the librettos to Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring Cycle): Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Seigfried and Die Götterdämerung. The Ring Cycle is considered one of the most ambitious musical projects ever undertaken by a single person.\n\nLiszt conducts the first performance of his symphonic poems in Weimar. The symphonic poem is an orchestral work, often in one movement, and is usually based on a literary idea. Liszt is credited with creating the genre. His symphonic poems include Orpheus, Les Preludes and Mazeppa.\n\nThe slave trade introduces West African rhythms, work songs, chants and spirituals to America, which strongly influence blues and jazz.\n\nGustav Mahler is born in Bohemia.\n\nVerdi's Aïda premieres in Cairo.\n\nVerdi's Requiem, his most respected work, premieres in Milan.\n\nTchaikovsky completes Swan Lake. It opens in 1877 at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.\n\nWagner's The Ring Cycle is performed in full at the Bayreuth Festival.
