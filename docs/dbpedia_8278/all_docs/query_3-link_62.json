        "text": "What were the 75 greatest rock songs of the '90s? You've likely got some opinions, but here we share the songs we feel made the decade truly rock.\n\nThe '90s were a great decade for rock! There was a variety within the rock world that was unrivaled with other decades, and here we're taking you back in time to revisit the 75 Best Rock Songs of the '90s.\n\nREAD MORE: Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the '90s\n\nWhile the hair metal that dominated the late '80s started to fade, grunge was there to fill the void. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden were just a few of the acts to bring a new sound to the forefront. Grunge also knocked down the doors for alternative rock in general, giving acts such as Jane's Addiction, Faith No More and Red Hot Chili Peppers that had been relegated to college rock radio in the '80s a more prominent platform. And once grunge started to fade, rap-rock and nu-metal were ready to fill the void making stars of Korn, Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine.\n\nYou also saw the re-emergence of pop-punk through Green Day and Blink-182 and new British invasion led by Oasis, Blur and Radiohead. Simply put, there was something for everyone. So join us as we revisit the 66 Best Rock Songs of the '90s below."
