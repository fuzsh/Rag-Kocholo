        "text": "Sweet Adelines are a diverse community of singers of all ages and abilities who come together through their love of barbershop music and stay together for the enduring friendships that result from singing close harmony.\n\nHughes Gehrke Doll Champion Showcase\n\nDolls representing all our champion choruses and quartets, each dressed in a handmade replica of the costume the singers wore on the international stage. The dolls are housed and lovingly cared for at Sweet Adelines International Headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma (USA) in the Hughes Gehrke Champion Showcase. We are very grateful for the generosity of Shelly Hughes and Mike Gehrke. Thanks to their philanthropic support, we are able to acknowledge the success of our quartets and choruses over the years in this special way.\n\nWhy I Sing\n\nWhy do you sing? We conducted a survey of Sweet Adelines around the world to find out what keeps them ringing chords.\n\nView operational areas for each department to ensure your inquiry lands in the right place.\n\nFirst time here?
