        "text": "SEATTLE--Feb. 2, 2000--Leading online retailer Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) (Nasdaq:AMZN) today announced that sales from its U.S. Music Store in the fourth quarter of 1999 reached $78 million, up more than 136 percent from the fourth quarter of 1998. Sales for fiscal year 1999 were $195 million, and the store ended the year with an annualized run rate solidly over $300 million. With these results, Amazon.com continues to set the pace for online music sales.\n\nAmazon.com's continual focus on providing the best music shopping experience helped the retailer dominate 1999 industry polls, earning the following honors:\n\nNo. 1 overall Internet music store in Gomez Advisors' two most recent scorecards.\n\nNo. 1 ranking in the first Forrester PowerRankings for online books, music, and video retailers.\n\nThe Harris Interactive ecommercePulse Excellence Award for the highest overall satisfaction rating among online music and video retailers.\n\nThe Midemnet Award 2000 for the best music shopping/digital distribution Web site.\n\n\"Amazon.com's music team is a group of music experts and music lovers devoted to helping our customers find music titles and music-related items they'll love,\" said Jennifer Cast, Amazon.com Music Store general manager. \"We're extremely grateful to our customers, who shared suggestions and criticisms that resulted in making Amazon.com not only the No. 1 online music shopping destination but also the easiest-to-use, most comprehensive music store on or off the Internet. We look forward to working with our customers to develop many more additions and improvements to our store in 2000.\"\n\nDuring 1999, Amazon.com launched a steady stream of new features to serve its music customers better. Enhancements to Amazon.com's Music Store last year include:\n\nFree Digital Downloads that enable customers to try before they buy: During 1999, Amazon.com's Music Store led the way in the exciting arena of digital downloads, becoming the first major online retailer to dedicate an area of its store to free, full-length song downloads from established artists, major-label performers, and independent artists. Innovative and successful download offerings helped spark several albums to No. 1 on the Amazon.com music charts, including Santana's Supernatural, Sarah McLachlan's Mirrorball, and Buena Vista Social Club. In November, Amazon.com teamed with the artist Moby and The Late Show with David Letterman to offer a download immediately following a performance on the show. Amazon.com continues to offer the largest selection of free promotional song downloads from major label artists of any major online music retailer, in addition to a large collection of downloads from independent artists in the Amazon.com Advantage program.\n\nExpanded selection of music from independent artists unavailable in most stores: Customers can find thousands of noteworthy CDs by independent artists and labels enrolled in Amazon.com's Advantage program. New features to expose and promote the music of these artists include the Emerging Artists area, which offers bestseller lists in 18 genres and features new and notable CDs. The New Music Spotlight, also a new addition, features free downloads from many of these artists, introducing customers to a selection of handpicked songs they may have never heard before. With these features, customers can now easily explore and discover great new music from independent artists in any genre.\n\nIncreased selection of music-related items: The addition of tapes and vinyl in the Music Store, the expansion of the Amazon.com Advantage program, and the launches of Electronics, Toys, Auctions, and zShops make Amazon.com the ultimate one-stop shopping destination for all things music. Amazon.com now offers the largest selection of music-related items, including U.S. CDs from major-label and independent artists, import CDs, cassette tapes, vinyl, music-related books, music videos, home audio electronics, portable CD and MP3 players, music memorabilia, both children's and adults' musical instruments, and used and rare music titles.\n\nClassical Music Center: No other music store--physical or online -- offers classical music experts and novices a greater selection of classical music or more ways to discover excellent classical recordings. The new Classical Music Center combines new features such as Orchestra Schedules with Amazon.com editors' selections for the Essential CDs by classical composers and artists, plus enhanced areas including Classical and Opera stores, Classical and Opera Top Sellers, and the powerful Classical Search Engine.\n\nGuides to the best music for every taste: The enhanced Recommendation Center helps customers find CDs they'll love via Amazon.com's editors' selections for the Essential CDs by Style, Artist, Composer, and Year, plus informative introductions to Classical, Jazz, and International music that help new listeners become familiar with genres that can sometimes be perceived as intimidating.\n\nInformation on new titles -- before they are released: Highlighting noteworthy new and upcoming releases from major label and independent artists, the New & Future Releases area gives customers an easy and reliable way to stay on top of the newest releases. At Amazon.com, customers can order CDs before they are released and receive them on the day of release. \"Amazon.com's music team looks forward to continuing to provide our customers with the No. 1 online music shopping experience in 2000,\" said Cast. \"We're excited about the possibilities that digital downloading and other new technologies offer music fans. We believe customers will have more access to more music, more quickly than ever before, and we intend to set the pace by making our customers' experience better than ever before.\"\n\nAbout Amazon.com's Music Store\n\nAmazon.com's Music Store, which opened in June 1998, is the No. 1 online music store and offers shoppers more than 25 times the CD selection of the typical music store at everyday savings of up to 30 percent.
