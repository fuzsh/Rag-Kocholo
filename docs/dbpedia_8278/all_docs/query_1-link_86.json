        "text": "It was the beginning of many accolades for Mariah Carey, who received her first GRAMMY in February 1991. The singer, who was 20 years old at the time, took home two gramophones for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Vision of Love.\"\n\nCarey was discovered by Tommy Mottola in 1998, when he was the head of Columbia Records. They began dating in 1991 and married on June 5, 1993, in a lavish wedding at New York City's St. Thomas Episcopal Church, when Carey was 23 and Mottola was 44. It was the first marriage for the pop star and second for the music mogul.\n\nCarey's \"One Sweet Day,\" featuring Boyz II Men, was released on Nov. 14, 1995, and became an instant hit, garnering rave reviews from critics and fans. The song spent 16 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, becoming the longest-running No. 1 song on the chart. Subsequently, Billboard magazine named it the most popular song of the 1990s.\n\nDespite having a successful career under Mottola's watchful eye, Carey's marriage with the label executive came to an end after four years of marriage. The singer filed for divorce on May 30, 1997. They officially divorced in 1998 and Carey spoke to Interview about her marriage the following year, saying that she \"always felt like the rug could be pulled out from under me. [With Tommy] I felt safe and I felt a sense of family. It just didn’t work out because it became too suffocating.”\n\nIn 2002, Carey parted ways with Virgin Records after one year. After being courted by other record companies, the pop diva signed with Island/Def Jam Music Group on May 9, 2002. It was later revealed that her new contract was valued at more than $20 million.\n\nEvery woman deserves their own signature fragrance -- at least that's what Carey thinks! The singer teamed up with Elizabeth Arden to develop a new women's perfume called M, which hit stores in September 2007. The fragrance was released in a lavish satin jewelry-esque box, and the bottle’s cap included Carey’s signature butterfly.\n\nThe \"One Sweet Day\" singer began dating Nick Cannon in 2008 after he appeared in her music video for \"Bye Bye.\" The two shocked fans and loved ones when they eloped on April 30, 2008, and the lovebirds also got tattoos to commemorate the special occasion. Cannon got the name \"Mariah\" tattooed on his shoulder, while Carey got a tattoo with the words \"Mrs. Cannon\" on her lower back.\n\nCarey joined the 12th season of Fox’s American Idol in July 2012. Two months later, it was revealed that the singer would share the judges’ table with Nicki Minaj, Keith Urban and Randy Jackson. She only stayed with the competition show for one season, later telling Australia's Kyle and Jackie O show that Idol was \"the worst experience of my life.\"\n\nCannon filed for divorce from Carey on Dec.12, 2014, in New York, after multiple reports surfaced that the two were calling it quits after six years of marriage. While their relationship was rocky directly following the split, they have since overcome their differences and are on good terms for the sake of their children.\n\nThe couple made their red carpet debut together at The Intern premiere in September 2015, where an eyewitness told ET the two looked \"really cute together\" and \"seemed very happy.\" Carey and her billionaire beau got engaged in January 2016 but split in October of that year.\n\nA quarter of a century since being released, Carey’s Christmas banger, “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” rose to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time ever in December 2019. The song previously reached number three in 2018 and hit the top spot 25 years since its release. The achievement marks Carey’s 19th number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and she has now made history with the most No. 1 songs on the chart by a solo artist. The festive hit is featured on Carey’s 1994 Christmas album, Merry Christmas, which was re-released by Sony Music Entertainment’s Legacy Recordings as Merry Christmas (Deluxe Anniversary Edition). She also dropped a brand new music video for the holiday anthem in 2019, deemed the \"Make My Wish Come True\" edition."
