        "text": "Jelly sandals, JNCO jeans, Doc Martens, slap bracelets and scrunchies -- those are just a few memorable trends of the 1990s. And while a lot of those fashion choices are best laid to rest, there's plenty of country music from the decade that we never want to let go.\n\nBecause the decade brought a unique and new pop-country sound to Nashville, some may consider the ‘90s to be the time of traditional country’s last gasp ... but there’s so much more to the music of this decade than meets the eye. Read on to learn about some of the decades biggest moments, artists, songs and more.\n\nCountry Music Milestones of the 1990s\n\nJan. 19, 1990: Reba McEntire makes her movie debut in Tremors. The film stars Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Michael Gross, and is about residents in a small town who are forced to defend themselves against underground creatures that are trying to kill them off.\n\nJan. 23, 1990:Clint Black's Killin' Time becomes his first platinum album. The disc was Black's debut record.\n\nFeb. 27, 1990: Alan Jackson releases his debut album, Here in the Real World. The disc spawned four Top 5 singles.\n\nMarch 3, 1990: The Highwaymen launch their first concert tour.

He was inducted by legend Johnny Russell.\n\nOct. 22, 1990: Tim McGraw signs with Curb Records. He was 23 years old at the time.\n\nMarch 9, 1991: Alan Jackson's \"I'd Love You All Over Again\" becomes his first No. 1 hit. He wrote \"I'd Love You All Over Again\" for his wife Denise, for their 10th wedding anniversary.\n\nMarch 16, 1991: Seven of Reba McEntire's band members, as well as her tour manager, die in a plane crash. The aircraft was en route from a private concert that McEntire had played just a few hours earlier in San Diego, Calif. McEntire, her then-husband Narvel Blackstock and her stylist Sandy Spika had opted to spend the night in California; a second plane carrying two more of McEntire's band members traveled safely.\n\nApril 9, 1991: Patty Loveless' 1988 album, Honky Tonk Angel, goes gold. The project was Loveless' third, and her first to go gold.\n\nApril 24, 1991: Garth Brooks wins a record six times at the ACM Awards. He now shares his one-night ACM Awards wins record with Faith Hill and Chris Stapleton, who each won six trophies in 1999 and 2016, respectively.\n\nJune 7, 1991: Alan Jackson is inducted into the Grand Ole Opry. He received the honor just one month after his sophomore album, Don't Rock the Jukebox, was released.\n\nJuly 2, 1991: Trisha Yearwood releases her debut album. The self-titled project contains a number of hit singles.\n\nAug. 10, 1991: Vince Gill joins the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted by Roy Acuff.\n\nSept. 4, 1991: Dottie West dies, at the age of 58, due to injuries sustained in a car crash on Aug. 30.

At the time, that was the highest sales ever for a country artist.\n\nDec. 4, 1991: The Judds play their final concert.

He was the first country star to be awarded the honor.\n\nJan. 15, 1992: Johnny Cash joins the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The invitation was a pleasant surprise to Tritt, who never imagined joining the revered organization.\n\nApril 11, 1992:Wynonna Judd's debut solo single, \"She Is His Only Need,\" hits No. 1.

The song, \"I Still Believe in You,\" was the debut single from and title track of his sixth studio album.\n\nOctober 1992:George Strait stars in Pure Country. The movie opened at No. 6 the week of its release, earning $2,739,680 in its opening week, and took in just over $15 million in its theatrical run -- not a disaster, given its $10 million budget, but certainly not a career-launching vehicle, either.\n\nJan. 31, 1993: Garth Brooks sings the National Anthem at the Super Bowl. Due to a dispute with NBC, however, the country superstar came close to not taking the stage at the very last minute.\n\nFebruary 1993: Toby Keith releases his debut single, \"Should've Been a Cowboy.\" The song became Keith's first No. 1 hit that June and comes from his debut album, released on April 20.\n\nFeb. 2, 1993: Willie Nelson settles his debt with the IRS. Nelson had originally been slapped with an eye-popping $32 million back taxes bill in 1990; in total, Nelson paid $9 million.\n\nApril 20, 1993:Tim McGraw releases his debut album.

It was the second time that Opry officials had asked the artist to join the organization's ranks.\n\nJune 23, 1993: Brooks & Dunn's Brand New Man goes triple platinum.

The song was written by Matraca Berg, Gary Harrison and Harry Stinson.\n\nMay 11, 1996: Steve Wariner joins the Grand Ole Opry.

The record shares its name with a 1994 self-released record from the band, but the songs are different.\n\nDec. 12, 1996: Clint Black earns a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He, at the time, had released five platinum-selling albums, including 1990's Put Yourself in My Shoes, which sold more than 3 million copies; he had also released 23 Top 10 singles, 10 of which landed at the top of the charts.\n\nApril 5, 1997: Trace Adkins' \"(This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing\" hits No. 1.

The best-selling album of the 1990s, the record has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide to date and remains the biggest-selling studio album by a female artist of all time, the best-selling country music album ever, the biggest-selling album by a Canadian country artist and one of the best-selling albums in music history. On April 7, 1999, the album was certified diamond.\n\nNov. 17, 1997: Shania Twain's The Woman in Me is certified diamond, for sales of 10 million copies.
