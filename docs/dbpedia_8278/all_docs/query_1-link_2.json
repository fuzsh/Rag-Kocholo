        "text": "Two decades ago, in June 1999, PRemployer was launched to complement its sister company, Personnel Resources. Our primary goal was to provide high-quality, comprehensive staffing and employment services to small- to medium-sized businesses in the southeast.\n\nTwenty years later, we continue to strive for the same objective while responding to technological and social changes that impact the human resources industry. In 2019 we honored PRemployer’s 20-year anniversary, here is a look back at other notable current events related to pop culture, sports, music, and technology that transpired the same year the company was established:\n\n1. The Y2K Scare\n\nParanoia swept through the country as the world speculated about what would happen to computer software – and the infrastructure that relied on it – with the new millennium on the horizon. Companies spent billions of dollars worldwide on technological upgrades and families prepared for a potential disaster by stockpiling food and other goods. Needless to say, Y2K did not bring the impending doom that was anticipated.\n\n2. ‘Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets’ came to the U.S.\n\nThe second installment of J.K. Rowling’s groundbreaking Harry Potter book series, “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” was released in the United States. Although Rowling found it difficult to complete, the book was received with widespread praise.\n\n3. Tiger Woods won his first PGA championship\n\nGolf legend Tiger Woods, 23 years old at the time, won the 81st PGA Championship, held August 12-15 at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois. It was his first PGA championship and second major and propelled his successful golf career forward.\n\n4. Apple released Power Mac G4\n\nApple introduced the original Power Mac G4 at a conference in San Francisco, CA, in August. This generation of personal computers was colloquially referred to as “Graphite,” because of the color of the case, and marketed by Apple as the “first personal supercomputers.” They were sold from 1999 to 2004.\n\n5. Wayne Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n\nWayne Gretzky retired in 1999 after a long career with the New York Rangers, secure in his reputation as “The Great One.” He also was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame that year.\n\n6. Albert Einstein named 'Person of the Century' by Time\n\nTime magazine named Albert Einstein the Person of the Century in December 1999, stating Einstein was “the pre-eminent scientist in a century dominated by science.” The magazine also noted all the touchstones of the era, including the Bomb, the Big Bang, quantum physics and electronics, “all bear his imprint.”\n\n7. Tony Hawk landed the first 900\n\nAfter several failed attempts that resulted in a variety of injures, professional skateboarder Tony Hawk became the first person to land a 900 during the sixth X-Games at Pier 30 overlooking San Francisco Bay.\n\n8. The Matrix Trilogy began\n\nThe first installment of The Matrix, a popular science fiction trilogy, premiered in 1999 and achieved mainstream success. The first film, created by the Wachowskis, won four Academy Awards, introduced popular culture symbols, and heavily influenced action filmmaking, leading it to be added to the National Film Registry.\n\n9. First non-stop world trip in a balloon\n\nBertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined forces to become the first explorers to circumnavigate the Earth inside of a hot air balloon.\n\n10. Toy Story 2 was released\n\n“Toy Story 2” opened in theaters on Nov. 24, acquiring wildly successful box office numbers and positive reviews. It received critical acclaim and was even one of the few film sequels considered superior to the original.\n\n11. Pokémon craze swept the U.S.\n\nPokemania spread like wildfire throughout the nation. Although the first game was introduced in 1996, it took three years for the fad to take hold. By 1999, there were trading cards and a massive television show.\n\n12. Napster had a short run\n\nBrothers Shawn and John Fanning launched Napster as a peer-to-peer (P2P) music file-sharing network. The service was easy to use with a free account and extremely popular. Later in the year, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) filed a lawsuit against the company on the grounds of unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. Napster was forced to shut down its network in 2001, but the brand was purchased and re-purposed by Roxio the next year.\n\n13. Women's Soccer Team Wins World Cup\n\nThe 1999 U.S. Women’s National Team won the FIFA Women’s World Cup, the third edition of the soccer championship for women’s national association football teams. In a memorable sports moment, Brandi Chastain scored the final goal before whipping off her jersey and taking a victory lap around the field.\n\n14. Woodstock ‘99\n\nWoodstock ’99, held between July 22 and 25 in upstate New York, was designed to replicate the original Woodstock festival of 1969. The large-scale music festival’s lineup included the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Korn, among other acclaimed bands and singers.\n\n15. Creation of the Euro\n\nThe European Union introduced the Euro as the European “single currency” on Jan. 1. Eleven members of the EU adopted the currency in 1999. Three years later, the original members – along with Greece – officially introduced Euro coins and banknotes as legal tender.\n\n16. New York Yankees win the World Series\n\nThe famed Yankees won their 25th World Series, which was more than any other team in history.\n\n17. The Mars Polar Lander was launched\n\nNASA launched the Mars Polar Lander in January. On Dec. 3, however, NASA lost radio contact with the spacecraft only moments before it entered the Martian atmosphere.\n\n18. Legoland opens in California\n\nLegoland opened in Carlsbad, California, making it the first Legoland amusement park established outside of Europe.\n\n19. “The Sixth Sense” is released\n\nM. Night Shyamalan’s renowned psychological thriller “The Sixth Sense,” starring Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, and Haley Joel Osment, premiered in August 1999. A modern ghost story that was beautifully executed, “The Sixth Sense” secured a spot as a Hollywood classic.\n\n20. SpongeBob premiered\n\nThe popular children’s cartoon show first premiered on the Nickelodeon cable network in May, but would eventually become one of the highest-rated and longest-running shows on Nickelodeon. The show sparked the production of several movies, video games, merchandise, and comic books and still has a strong following.\n\n20 Years of Success"
