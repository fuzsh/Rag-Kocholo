        "text": "A year ago today Clayton came home from an almost 10 month deployment. And this afternoon he‚Äôs leaving again for another 3 month deployment. He hasn‚Äôt been home for more than 3 months at a time in over a year. This lifestyle is incredibly hard. And to be honest it just sucks at times. Today is sad and hard for us. It never gets easier, you don‚Äôt get used to it. I have a lot of cool things happening this summer for Free Life and he won‚Äôt be here. I‚Äôve learned a lot in the 10 years I‚Äôve been a military spouse. Being a military family has caused us to grow. Here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve learned: 1. Don‚Äôt fight about the small stuff in a relationship. 2. Give lots of grace to yourself and each other. 3. It‚Äôs ok to have your feelings about anything. Feelings are ok, it‚Äôs what we do with them that matters. 4. I‚Äôm stronger and more capable than I ever thought possible. 5. The small, normal moments in life are the most precious. 6. Appreciate your people and tell them often how much you love them. My goal for today is getting through the best I can, and holding space for all the emotions that come with it.\n\nLet‚Äôs Roll: A Leadership Vision For Everyone On this September 11th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States I am reminded of two words that became seared into the American consciousness. They came from the plane that crashed into a Pennsylvania cornfield. Two simple words that united a group of strangers to carry out an impossible mission under unimaginable conditions. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs roll.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. Two words that saved countless lives by forcing the terrorist‚Äôs to divert from their deadly plan. This small group of incredibly brave people, Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Jeremy Glick, and Tom Burnett and Flight attendants like Sandra Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles brought an end to an attack that was surely planned to spread fear by killing thousands. With those two little words in the team was formed, a mission was initiated, and differences were set aside for the greater good. The United States is more divided now than it has ever been in recent history, but if we remember the time in which these two words were said an election had just been decided by the Supreme Court and a president with the narrowest margin in history took power. Some would rightfully think that was a pretty divisive time in our history and yet no one on that plane asked for the others political affiliations. No one wondered where they stood on school lunches. Or if they had an opinion on immigration. Instead, having been told of the outcome of two other faithful flights that morning, this team decided to take their fate in their own hands not just for themselves, not just for their families and loved ones and significant others, but for the intended targets of this attack in a selfless act of bravery. And while we rightfully responded with retribution against those who perpetrated this act of war in the immediate aftermath of the attack, I can‚Äôt help thinking that after 22 years, it might be time to seek the deeper lesson. The lesson that can help heal our country and bring it together. That there is more that binds us than drives us apart. There is more than connects us then keeps us separated. And when we look to the best version of ourselves, we seek the best for everyone not just ourselves. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if a more fitting memorial of that fateful day would be one in which we seek to build bridges over our differences and build bonds that will enable us to complete a greater mission no matter the conditions. In the long shadow of that memory, how many of us are ready and willing to step up and say ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs roll.‚Äù #unitedwestand #letsroll Image: United Flight 93, Shanksville Pennsylvania\n\n12 years ago, I swapped my military boots for civilian shoes. I thought I was just stepping out of uniform, but really, I was stepping into a whole new battle. At first, I felt totally lost. Like, where do you go when you‚Äôve always had a map? Suddenly, the map was gone, and I was supposed to be the compass, but I had no idea which way was north. I tried to fill that empty space with anything I could‚Äîvideo games, hours online, chasing money, and applause like they were power-ups in a game. If my life looked cool on Instagram or my achievements stacked up, I figured I was winning. But it was like putting band-aids on a broken leg. My real life, the offline one, was low-key falling apart. It hit me one day, this simple but huge truth: all the noise, the distractions, the achievements? They were just smoke screens. I was so busy trying to impress everyone else, I forgot to check in with myself. I was playing life like a strategy game, following the missions, ticking off achievements, but I missed the whole point of figuring out who I was without the uniform. This is straight-up what I want to share, especially with vets who might be feeling this too. It‚Äôs cool if the world doesn‚Äôt get you. The real mission? Getting yourself. We wore the uniform, we did the duty, we had each other‚Äôs backs. Now, it‚Äôs time to have our own backs. Losing that military identity is rough. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre part of this tight squad, then suddenly, you‚Äôre solo on a recon mission with no backup. But here‚Äôs the real talk: finding out who you are on your own? That‚Äôs the bravest thing you can do. So, to my fellow vets, let‚Äôs not use ‚Äúbeing misunderstood‚Äù as a shield. It‚Äôs time to level up, for real. It‚Äôs time to stop playing defense and start exploring who we are, trauma and all. It‚Äôs not about being a soldier or a vet to everyone else; it‚Äôs about being true to yourself. Let‚Äôs make this the mission: know yourself, heal yourself, and everything else will line up. Trust me, understanding yourself beats any high score or badge of honor. Let‚Äôs start this quest, not for medals, but for peace and real happiness.\n\nüóΩ Remembering and Honoring the Heroes of 9/11 üá∫üá∏ Today marks the 22nd anniversary of the September 11th attacks, a day etched deeply into our collective memory. It's a time for us to reflect, pay tribute, and most importantly, honor the heroes who selflessly sacrificed their lives on that fateful day. On this solemn occasion, let us come together as a community to commemorate the brave first responders, firefighters, police officers, and all those who courageously rushed into danger to save others. Their unwavering commitment to protecting and serving has left an indelible impact on our nation's history. As we remember the tragic events of 9/11, let's also recognize the resilience and spirit of unity that emerged from the ashes. The way our nation rallied together, supporting one another, and demonstrating unwavering strength and compassion, serves as a testament to the human spirit. In the face of adversity, we've seen countless stories of individuals rising above, turning pain into purpose, and making a positive impact on the world. Today, let's honor those stories and amplify the message of hope, unity, and resilience. Take a moment today to reflect on the lessons we've learned from 9/11 ‚Äì the importance of cherishing our loved ones, embracing diversity, and fostering a culture of inclusivity and understanding. Let's strive to build bridges instead of walls, and work towards a world where peace and compassion prevail. #NeverForget #911Anniversary #September11 #UnitedWeStand #RememberAndHonor\n\nJessica Flores embodies resilience. Faced with a challenging journey marked by injury and forced retirement, she delved into the depths of her being, discovering an unwavering strength to navigate her trials. What sets her apart is not just the determination to overcome her ordeal, but a steadfast focus on the future‚Äîthe \"Next Shift\" in her life. What sets you apart? Are you resilient? Resilience, as exemplified by Jessica, emerges as a pivotal factor in the art of survival. She sheds light on constructive ways to fortify resilience, offering a beacon of hope in the fight against suicide. Jason M. Palamara and I noted in Chapter 10 of Living Blue that the keys to resilience lie in mental health professionals attuned to the unique challenges faced by LEOs, impactful awareness campaigns, and the power of peer-to-peer programs. Mental Health Professionals Who Understand LEOS Mental health professionals may not understand the stressors of LEOs, or be vetted or culturally competent to recognize their numerous cultures, ethnicities, religions, genders, and sexual orientations (IACP, 2023). Agencies must seek out mental health professionals who understand the culture, and the stressors and have the therapeutic skills to work with LEOs. These professionals need to be aware of best practices to screen for chronic suicidal ideation, intent, and planning, which are risk factors for attempts and suicide. LEOs with a persistent suicidal state may not respond well to typical crisis management strategies and need trained professionals in evidence-based, suicide-specific care related to officers, or a treatment plan won‚Äôt work. Awareness Campaigns Although they may resist getting help, they won‚Äôt resist talking to someone if it will make them feel stronger. Most officers don‚Äôt have a clue as to who to reach out to. An awareness campaign about who to call and what to do might help. Peer-to-Peer Programs Peer-to-peer programs can prevent intentional self-directed violence. There are trained peers who are part of the police community that can help them manage their suicidal thoughts. In the symphony of life, resilience plays a harmonious note, echoing the strength needed to face adversity and embrace, as Jessica notes, the \"Next Shift\" with unwavering resolve. #suicideprevention #vicarioustrauma #compassionfatigue #lawenforcementofficer\n\nMy mind right now: \"In times of an imminent global war: - Avoid distracting your mind with any divertion. - Don't spend money irrationally. - Don't move to another job unless is absolutly necessary. - Have a family emergency plan, being prepared is something usually people don't see as critical or priority or even think about regularly. The time to think and act about this is now. - Keep your car gas thank full most of the time, you never know. - Take actions with family leaders or comunity leaders to avoid or engage conflicts. When time of War are gone or discipated, learn the lessons that war brouthg to you and your loved ones, pass on the information to younger generations(don't traumatize them, just be sure they understand the information and they know how to be alerta and take action quick, this serves not only for warfare scenarios, but also for any emergency situations)...\" Five seconds later also my mind: \"Predro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro...\""
