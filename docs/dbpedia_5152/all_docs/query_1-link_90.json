        "text": "CLICK HERE TO VIEW MARVIN'S SCRIPTURE SERVICE\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW MARVIN'S MASS OF CHRISTIAN BURIAL\n\nMarvin Leo Klein was born at home on a farm north of Earling, Iowa on October 1, 1935, to Ray and Marie (Jacoby) Klein. He was the fourth of 11 children. They moved to Defiance, Iowa and he began school at St. Peter’s until they moved to Dunlap in March of 1943. Marvin graduated from St. Joseph’s in 1953. He joined the Army Reserves in 1955 and attended Camp McCoy and then 1957 Camp Roberts in California. In 1956, Marvin went to California to help an uncle who had a heart attack but came back to help plant in the spring. He was encouraged by his uncle to go to college. Marvin enrolled at Woodbury College and got a business degree, graduating in 1959. He had to leave and miss graduation to attend Army Reserve camp at Fort Hunter Liggett and Camp Roberts. After Marvin’s graduation, General Kellog of the 101st Artillery division promoted him, and he was a driver. While at camp, he had the honor of driving 4-star General McArther, grandson of the original General. After graduation and camp, Marvin returned to Iowa with a plan to attend UCLA engineering class in the fall but while he was back in Iowa, he met Dolores Stessman. His uncle wanted him to see if she was the one and delay starting college, so he began working in Omaha in sales. Marvin and Dolores were married in 1960. In 1963, they moved to a farm in Dunlap, Iowa. They were blessed with 6 children. In 1970, Marvin began to discern that he had a ministry to serve as a Deacon, so he began studying and was ordained in 1974. In 1979, he served as the Diocesan Deaconate Director and had the honor of being Deacon at Living History Farms when Pope John II came to the heartland.\n\nMarvin enjoyed riding horses, especially racehorses at county fairs. He liked helping out on the family farm. Marvin also found joy serving as Deacon and helping with funerals, visitations, baptisms and preaching on Sundays.\n\nMarvin died on Sunday, February 11, 2024, at Bergan Mercy Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska at the age of 88 years, four months and 10 days.\n\nMarvin was preceded in death by his parents; infant son, Gerald Peter Klein; brothers, Gerald, James and Francis Klein; sisters-in-law, Betty, Sharon and Fran Klein; and daughter-in-law, Jodi Klein. He is survived by his wife, Dolores; children, Bill Klein of Dunlap, Ann (Pat) Gredys of Omaha, Paul Klein of Dunlap, Gene (Teri) Klein of Papillion and John (Jayne) Klein of Woodbine; 20 grandchildren; 17 great-grandchildren; eight siblings, Neil Klein of Omaha, Nebraska, Duane Klein of Dunlap, Sharon (Kenneth) Livingston of Denison, Iowa, Robert Klein of Dunlap, Janet (Ronald) Seeley of Brookings, South Dakota, Linda Struck of West Des Moines, Iowa, Judy (Larry) Leinen of Denison; sisters-in-law, Virginia Klein and Phyllis Klein both of Dunlap; and many other relatives and friends.\n\nMEMORIAL DONATIONS MAY BE MADE TO THE DUNLAP FOOD BANK OR DUNLAP FIRE AND RESCUE"
