        "text": "Roderick Perkins\n\nNORFOLK - Roderick James Perkins died quietly at home at “The Frog”, in Norfolk, Conn. on Monday, May 6, 2024.\n\nRod was born February 17, 1943 in Norfolk, the son of Thelma Brown Perkins and James Freeman Perkins.\n\nHe is survived by daughters Barbara J. Perkins and Heather Brooke Perkins, grandsons, Jonas Roderick and Benjamin George, niece, Alyssa, step-daughter, Ashley Brunn, and foster brother Richard Patterson.\n\nHe is predeceased by his parents, sisters Phylis, Elinore, and Barbara, and two foster brothers Kenneth Reynolds and Gerald Patterson.\n\nAs you may remember Rod Perkins was a real sharp dresser. Yes, he accomplished many other things in his life, but his sartorial choices cannot be overstated.\n\nWas it the boy scout uniforms worn from local troop meetings all the way to the Boy Scout Jamboree in Valley Forge, PA in 1957, or baseball and basketball uniforms for the Norfolk Center School, the Town of Norfolk team, Gilbert (where he attended before the construction of the new regional high school) and NWR7 (where he was in the first graduating class, and inducted into their Athletic Hall of Fame), perhaps it was the barbershop quartet costumes, or those from the famed minstrel shows in the Norfolk Village Hall or busking with his Jazz quartet.\n\nPerhaps it was donning the colors of Champlain College where he earned an A.A. while on an athletic scholarship. Or maybe it was the varsity soccer uniform or all the fraternity garb he wore as brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon while at Tennessee Wesleyan University. It could have come from donning a cap and gown after earning his M.S. from University of Hartford. Or even his time as a teacher and tennis coach at Bulkeley High School in Hartford.\n\nMaybe it evolved from his hobbies and the outfits needed for working on his “old Mercedes” or “the Healey”, running (including the NY and Boston Marathons and founding the Norfolk Memorial Day 5 Mile Road Race), triathlons, cruising on his full dressed Harley, playing golf and tennis at his beloved Norfolk Country Club and for a time, Shuttle Meadow CC and the Madison Beach Club.\n\nIt might even have been a response to having to wear a suit and tie for 40 years as a commercial banker for CBT, New Britian National Bank, Fleet, and finally Guilford Savings Bank.\n\nOne thing is for sure, it didn’t come from the countless hours he spent on boards, committees, associations and foundations (including the founding of the Norfolk Connecticut Childrens Foundation) as there was no uniform or costume necessary, other than rolled up sleeves, a yellow legal pad, a sharp pencil and a willingness to get down to business on behalf of children, the aging, “the club”, and various communities and Chambers of Commerce.\n\nIn true Rod fashion there won’t be a funeral, but instead a party. Two actually. One at the Norfolk Country Club on Sunday, July 21, and one at the Norfolk Pub on Sunday August 11, 3-5pm. Guests are kindly asked not to wear black. But instead to don your favorite Plus Fours or plaid or argyle or Tennis whites (or anything else you deem appropriate).\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Norfolk Connecticut Children's Foundation.\n\nBurial will be a private family service.\n\nKevin O’Connor\n\nNORFOLK - Kevin Michael O’Connor, born September 21, 1936, left us to join his family and friends in Heaven on July 5, 2024.\n\nKevin enjoyed his entire life in his beloved town of Norfolk.\n\nWhile still in Gilbert High School, age 17, he began working at the drugstore in town. Kevin stayed and ran the store into his 70’s. He followed the store’s evolution from drugstore to general store to a convenience store and throughout all those transitions,\n\nhe remained a fixture for well over 50 years. From making ice cream sundaes to keeping track of everyone’s needs, running the pharmacy and answering 911 dispatch calls, Kevin was always on the job, and always willing to help.\n\nKevin was the Norfolk Town Crier. Some of Kevin’s many volunteer roles included, Norfolk Volunteer Fire Department, Democratic Town Committee, Democratic Registrar of Voters,\n\nUsher at Immaculate Conception Church and Lyons Club member.\n\nKevin loved attending Yale Music School concerts and opera screenings and housed music students every summer.\n\nIn later years, he had fun chauffeuring friends and neighbors to airports and sporting events. He especially loved dining out at local restaurants, and he looked forward to summer vacations at Bantam Lake. Mostly he liked to laugh and tell jokes while visiting with friends at the store.\n\nKevin is predeceased by his parents, Winifred (Neary) and Edward O’Connor and his 8 brothers and 3 sisters, Father John, Timothy (Diane), Edward (Catherine), Thomas (Muriel), Dr. Jeremiah (Nancy), Francis (Mary Ellen), James (Edith), Patrick (Fran), Katherine (James Henebry), Margaret (George Zecher) and Mary (Stedman Dowd). Kevin is survived by 31 loving nephews and nieces and their families, and a host of long- time friends who will miss him very much.\n\nThe family would like to thank the wonderful staff at Litchfield Woods for their kindness and care for Kevin.\n\nA mass of Christian burial will be held on August 16th at 11 a.m. at St. Martins of Tours Church of the Immaculate Conception, 4 North Street, Norfolk.\n\nBarbara Moeckel\n\nCANAAN – Barbara J. Moeckel, 91, of Canaan, CT passed away peacefully on June 27, 2024, after a brief illness.\n\nBarbara was born August 27, 1932, in Williamsport, PA, the eldest daughter of Chester and Lela (Smith) Burtnett, and grew up in Naugatuck, CT. A graduate of Naugatuck High School, Barbara received her bachelor’s degree in 1954 from Danbury State Teachers College (now Western Connecticut State University).\n\nBarbara married her high school sweetheart Kenneth A. Moeckel on December 21, 1952. In 1985 Barbara and Ken moved to Norfolk, CT where she became an active member of the Church of Christ, Congregational and a volunteer at the Norfolk Library.\n\nMusic was Barbara’s lifelong passion. She learned to play the piano as a child, and later became known locally for her talents as a soprano soloist. While studying music and education in college, she also performed in musical theater including a role as Ado Annie in the musical Oklahoma.\n\nAfter receiving her college degree Barbara taught music in the Naugatuck elementary schools. She left classroom teaching while her children were growing up but continued to enrich the lives of many local children by teaching piano lessons from her home. She returned to elementary school music education in the 1970’s, teaching in the Naugatuck school district until her retirement in 1980’s.\n\nAs well as teaching music, Barbara was a soloist with church and community choirs, directed church choirs, played piano as a volunteer at the Geer Village nursing home and even started a singing group at Geer Village Lodge once she became a resident there in 2022.\n\nBarbara also was an avid gardener, devoting much time and energy to her extensive gardens in Norfolk. An additional avocation was a creative writing group of which she was an active and enthusiastic participant. In her spare time, she would sew and embroider baby booties to give to expectant grandparents at Geer.\n\nBarbara was predeceased by her husband, who passed away in 2017. She is survived by daughters Deborah and Lisa, a son Kurt and daughter-in-law Deborah; three grandchildren: Jacob, Jamie, and Joshua; and siblings Glenda LePage, Judith Lambeth, and Janice Strollo (husband Arnold).\n\nA celebration of life will be held on Saturday, August 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM at the Church of Christ Congregational, 12 Litchfield Rd, Norfolk Historic District, CT 06058.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to Covenant House, a charity that provides love, shelter and hope to young people facing homelessness.\n\nJohn Peterson\n\nSHARON - John Melvin Peterson passed away peacefully on July 26, 2024, in his home in Sharon with his wife, Ruby and daughters, by his side. He was 87 years old.\n\nJohn “Pete”, son of the late Melvin and Marie (Aakjar) Peterson, was born in Sharon and attended Housatonic Valley Regional High School, where he enjoyed spending time with President Lincoln in the “smokers gulch”, working on his cars, hunting and fishing. Upon graduation from high school in 1955 Pete joined the Air Force and served 3 years as an Airman Second Class.\n\nWith a love of the outdoors Pete spent many happy hours on the golf course. He was a proud founding member of the golf association ROBOTS (Retired old bastards on tour). In later years, as they travelled, Pete always found time to play 18 holes while Ruby found a beach to walk. Another shared joy was travelling in the 1956 Chevy Peter restored for Ruby, a reminder of their dating days. The cherry red Chevy always stood out with Pete and Ruby flipping a coin for driving rights for the day!\n\nPete was a proud Boy Scout and served as a troop leader for many years. He shared his love of the outdoors and camping with his Scout troops and his daughters Lynn and Lesa.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Melvin Peterson, John “Pete” was a member of the Masonic Lodge of Sharon and served as a Master Mason.\n\nPete could always be relied upon to lend a hand with car repairs, building custom golf clubs and construction projects. His career ranged from time in the automotive industry, serving as a service manager for Ford, founding a general contracting company and in his later years –custom specialty millwork which he often described as a labor of love.\n\nPete is survived by his wife Ruby, daughter Lynn Kent and her husband David, daughter Lesa Tennant and her husband Michael, and granddaughters Laura and Jessica.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations for the Ambulance Fund - Sharon Fire Department, PO Box 357 Sharon, CT 06069 would be appreciated. The family would like to express their overwhelming gratitude to the Ambulance crew of the Sharon Fire Department for their support. Special gratitude and appreciation to Linda and Peter Blasini who provided for every need imaginable for Pete and Ruby on this journey.\n\nThere will be no services, as Pete preferred seeing all of you while he was alive – he chuckled as he told us that – so smile when you remember Pete because you were part of his wonderful life.\n\nLeslie Connery\n\nKENT - Always with a ready smile, Leslie Guy Connery loved to meet, work with, and help people from all walks of life, especially those in need. This was her focus as a wife, mother, grandmother, teacher, and volunteer. Community-oriented and pragmatic, with seemingly boundless energy even into her 90’s, she thrived on serving others.\n\nBorn on December 23, 1928, Leslie grew up in Binghamton, New York, in a strongly knit community of family and friends. From this deeply rooted childhood, she looked forward to adventures in the wider world. While studying at Radcliffe College, she majored in international relations with the goal of becoming a diplomat. This was excellent preparation for the life she would soon begin to lead after meeting, and then marrying, her college sweetheart and aspiring journalist, Donald S. Connery.\n\nJust seven years later, in 1957, Don became a foreign correspondent for Time and Life magazines, and thus they began twelve whirlwind years of extensive travel and extraordinary experiences, with four children in tow, including New Delhi (1957 to 1960), Tokyo (1960 to 1962), Moscow (briefly in 1962), and London (1962 to 1968). Leslie experienced India coming into its own after centuries of colonial rule; Japan recovering from the devastation of World War II; Moscow during the Cuban Missile Crisis; and Great Britain during the time of The Beatles and swinging London. Leslie managed the household and assisted Don in his work, serving as his sounding board, advisor, and editor, making it possible for him to focus on his career and travel widely and constantly. In 1965, with all her children in school, she began three years of volunteer work with autistic children as part of a British National Health Service pilot project.\n\nIn 1968, Leslie and Don (now a freelance writer and author) settled permanently in a historic farmhouse in the small rural town of Kent, Connecticut. Leslie earned an M.A. in Special Education at Southern Connecticut College and became a state-certified teacher and the family’s primary breadwinner in 1971, when she began her 40+ year career as a special education teacher. She taught for 26 years in local public schools, helping students ages four to 16 with physical, mental, or psychological learning challenges. After retiring in 1997, she continued as a substitute teacher and then took a job as a learning skills teacher at a nearby private boarding school in 2001. She tried retiring again in 2009 but couldn’t resist signing up as a volunteer teacher in the Kent Center School’s new program for autistic children in 2010.\n\nWanting to do more and inspired by the remarkable Kent volunteer firefighters who saved the Connery home from destruction in a January 1969 fire, Leslie decided to join the newly formed Kent ambulance squad in 1974. She became a certified emergency medical technician; however, the all-male fire department was reluctant to accept females and insisted that she first attend fire school and become a certified firefighter. Always inspired by a challenge, Leslie soon went on to become the Kent Fire Department’s first female firefighter and EMT. Thus began her 36 years of volunteer work in emergency services. As a certified EMT, she responded at any time of the day or night to as many calls as she could manage, coming to the aid of hundreds of people and helping save numerous lives. In addition, she served as chair of the regional board responsible for EMT education and training and, from 1996 to 1999, as ambulance chief. In 1999, she received a Distinguished Achievement Award from the Connecticut Emergency Medical Services Councils. Leslie finally retired as an EMT in 2010 at the age of 82, likely as the oldest EMT in Connecticut at the time.\n\nLeslie was also a member, volunteer, and choir singer in the Kent Congregational Church for over four decades. On the personal front, she loved horseback riding on local trails; knitting and sewing to create gifts for family and friends; watching Red Sox games and tennis matches; and, into her late 80s, international vacation travel with Don. Always enthusiastic and gracious hosts and devoted parents and grandparents, Leslie and Don welcomed many guests and enjoyed frequent visits from their children, grandchildren, and great-grandson, who loved spending time at the Kent family home. Leslie’s passion for EMT work inspired several of her children and grandchildren, who volunteer or work in emergency services and related fields. Almost to the end, thanks to grandson Justin, Leslie had a scanner nearby so she could stay abreast of ongoing emergency activities in Connecticut.\n\nLeslie passed away peacefully in her sleep on July 11 at 95 years. She is survived by her four children (Jan Connery, Eric Connery, Julie Connery-Smith, and Carol Connery), eight grandchildren (Marc, Jacob, Tyffany, Sean, Lucas, Justin, Kyle, Stuart), great-grandson (Brayden), brother (Peter Guy), sister-in-law (Barbara Guy), daughter-in-law (Jane Connery), and son-in-law (Keith Smith).\n\nThe Connery family is deeply grateful for the compassionate care and support that BrightStar Care staff and VITAS staff provided to Leslie during her final year.\n\nA memorial service followed by a reception will be held on September 21, at 11:00 a.m. at the First Congregational Church of Kent, 97 North Main Street, Kent CT.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Kent Volunteer Fire Department Inc., 28 Maple St, Kent, CT 06757.\n\nSarah Picton\n\nSALISBURY - Sarah (Cooke) Picton, age 76, of Salisbury, CT, died June 17, 2024 at Geer Nursing and Rehab Center in Canaan, CT of complications from Alzheimer’s Disease. Sarah and her loving husband, Jim Picton, had fourteen golden years together.\n\nSarah Herritage Cooke (she dropped “Herritage when she married, and yes, they did spell it with two “r”s) was born in Richmond, VA on October 2, 1947, the youngest of four siblings to the late Richard Caswell Cooke and Caroline Myers, both of Richmond.\n\nShe was predeceased by her oldest sibling, Caroline, and Caroline’s husband, William Dinsmore Holland, both of Cookeville, TN.\n\nShe is survived by her brother, Richard Caswell (“Caswell”) Cooke, Jr. and his wife, Mary Davis Cooke, both of Lawrenceville, NJ; also her sister Anne Gordon Cooke of Richmond. Anne’s husband, Rev. Charles Daniel Curran, Jr., predeceased her.\n\nSarah also leaves many devoted nieces and nephews, one of whom, Lawrence Curran, predeceased her. Sarah had no children of her own, but two loving godsons, Peter Boyd of Charles City, VA, the son of Sarah’s longtime friends Julie and Randy Boyd, and Gordon Cooke of Derry, NH, the youngest son of brother Caswell.\n\nIt should also be said here that there was not a better-loved pair of cousins either side of the Mason-Dixon Line than Willson Craigie (yes, two “L”s) and his wife, Susan Craigie, both of Richmond, whose friendship with Sarah and husband Jim figured prominently in their lives and grew deeper over the years.\n\nIn fact, as children, Sarah, Willson, and sister Anne would spend part of each summer together at Cricket Hill, the rural cabin, pond, and stream retreat father Dick fashioned for the family. Many stories emanate from that time, which must have made a deep impression on Sarah who, when she finally began to loosen her grip on reality, would often tell visitors that she lived at Cricket Hill still- which, in a way, must have been true. On Sundays when it didn’t rain (it never did, in the lore), Dick would conduct outdoor services under the weeping cedar, mostly consisting of hymns sung a capella.\n\nAlthough not religious in later life, Sarah grew up attending Grace and Holy Trinity Episcopal, a church her great-grandfather helped to found in the 19th century. She attended St. Catherine’s, an Episcopal Diocesan school beginning in 6th grade, graduating 12th grade in 1965. Hollins College followed, a female-only school at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where Sarah thrived (she and her schoolmates were known as “Hollie Collie Dollies”), earning a bachelor’s degree in art history with a minor in math.\n\nAt this point, work at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts was available, and although Sarah eventually took a job there, the urge to travel and see more of this country was overwhelming. Sarah struck out for the West. A series of visits over the next few years led her to jobs on a dude ranch in Wyoming, a sojourn in California (think: camping next to an avocado plantation), bartending in Denver, and a job with the Denver Art Museum, organizing fundraising shows and concerts in Larimer Square. She took credit for, among other things, introducing Bluegrass to the country music fans there when she organized a concert with Hot Rize, a group still heard on the radio today.\n\nThough she loved the clear skies and surrounding natural beauty of Colorado and Wyoming, Sarah yearned to be closer to the New York art world, and so moved to New York, taking an apartment next to an old school friend in a third floor walk-up in hell’s kitchen (as she liked to remind us). Sarah was an artist, working in pencil, ink, and watercolor. She sketched every day, drawing from photographs and from life. In New York, she designed a line of greeting cards and sold them to Caspari, Inc. Many years later, after retirement, Sarah re-started her card business, marketing her work to local shops. But in New York, the card business didn’t cover all the bills, so Sarah found work at the Betty Parsons Gallery. After working at the Parsons gallery, Sarah was offered, and quickly took, a job as office manager and general jobber for Jasper Johns.\n\nThe relationship with her employer and the artists and “buzz” surrounding him was so successful that Sarah settled into Manhattan for good, moving to CT only after Johns did. They were both fond of each other; Sarah stayed on for about 28 years, retiring finally to spend more time with husband Jim who, as one of the contractors who took care of the Johns campus, had to answer to Sarah’s ironclad rule before proceeding with any work, and fell in love with the boss in the process. Three years after first husband Bill’s death, Sarah allowed Jim into her life. They were subsequently married, in 2014. Visits to Cape Cod and to Maine, and a trip to Ireland to celebrate Sarah’s seventieth birthday, were among the pleasures of retirement, before Alzheimer’s became evident.\n\nA memorial gathering and simple service will be held for Sarah in Salisbury and also Richmond, after summer. Notice will be published so that all who wish may attend these remembrances.\n\nThose who wish to make a charitable contribution in Sarah’s memory may consider the Housatonic Valley Association, a local conservation organization Sarah liked to support: Housatonic Valley Association, 150 Kent Road, PO Box 28, Cornwall Bridge, CT 06754.\n\nCharles Dickey\n\nWEST CORNWALL - Charles Richard Dickey, 88, of West Cornwall, CT passed away peacefully on June 23, 2024, after a short illness. He leaves behind Janine Selendy, his loving partner of 24 years.\n\nCharles, known throughout his life as “Chick,” was a lover of classical music, horseback riding, and French cuisine.

He graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1964 with a JD and practiced as an attorney at several law firms, including Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Gold, Farrell and Marks and served as General Counsel of Madison Square Garden, in New York City.\n\nA longtime resident of North Salem, NY he moved to West Cornwall, CT in 2021 with Janine and their two West Highland White Terriers, Bramble and Thistle.\n\nChick is survived by his brother, his five children, their spouses and his eight grandchildren – James Dickey and Chris Bart, Leslie and Sanjay Patel and their daughters, Alisha and India Patel, Keith and Alison Dickey and their daughter Claire Dickey, Kim Dickey and Kirk Ambrose and their children Frederick and Helen Ambrose, Scott and Ilia Dickey and their sons Charles and Alexander Dickey, and Jean and Donald Quaintance and their daughter Keala Quaintance. He is also survived by Janine and her family, Philippe and Bela Selendy and their wives and children. Chick is also survived by his former spouses, Catherine M. F.

She\n\nwas 83 years old.\n\nEliza attended Potomac School in McLean, VA, acquiring her love of music both from her conservatory-trained mother, Celina Robbins Kellogg, and also from her Potomac school days with music teacher John Langstaff, with whom she later performed in Spring and Christmas Revels productions in Washington, DC (1974) and Hanover, NH (1982).\n\n​\n\nEliza graduated from Milton Academy in Milton, MA where she was valedictorian of the Class of 1958, and Radcliffe College in Cambridge, MA, earning a BA in English Literature, Summa Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa, 1962.\n\n​\n\nAfter college, Eliza taught English at Bard College in Red Hook, NY, and at schools in Washington DC before marrying Kevin Klose in 1964.

She taught creative music and movement at Columbia Road and also in the Six School Complex when her children joined one of the 6 schools, Horace Mann.\n\n​\n\nWhen husband Kevin was appointed Moscow Bureau Chief for The Washington Post in 1977- 1981, Eliza learned Russian fluently, and became a guiding light for the family in navigating the challenges life in the USSR. She helped Kevin conduct interviews (he hadn’t learned the language nearly as well) and supported the three kids in attending Soviet schools and learning fluent Russian. Both Eliza and Kevin became fascinated by the Soviet Dissident movement, coming to know and support the families of Dmitri Sakharov and Elena Bonner, Lidia Chukovskaya, Lev Kopelev, Vasily Aksyonov, Vladimir Voinovich, the Donetsk, Ukraine coal miner activist Alexei Nikitin and many others from the Soviet intelligentsia.\n\n​\n\nFrom Moscow, the family moved to Pomfret, Vermont, for two years while Kevin wrote an account of the Soviet dissident movement, and then to Chicago for four, during Kevin’s stint as Midwest & Canada Bureau Chief for the Post. During this time Eliza translated and published works by activist and writer Lidia Chukovskaya, and also taught writing at Midwest Talent Search, Northwestern University’s program for gifted youth.\n\n​\n\nBack in Washington DC in 1989, Eliza joined and later became Executive Director of the small non-profit, the Institute for Soviet-American Relations (ISAR).

He took time to teach his employees his art of taxes.\n\nBob was also a landlord and owner of the Royal Arcanum, where he met his long-time friend of over 20 years, Micheal Dinsmore. The two of them together experienced many great times. They would always be laughing and singing some of their favorite songs. Bob would always say that the Royal Arcanum was his baby. He loved that building and took great care of it. During his time at the Royal Arcanum and owing his business he met a lucky lady, Melissa Baresi. Little did they both know that Robert and Melissa would become the best of friends and even turn into family. Melissa is considered to be Bob’s Girl. Bob is the reason Melissa has such a great life today.\n\nAfter retirement, another one of Bob’s lifelong friends, Dana Devereux, was there to help Bob get accustomed to retirement. Retirement can be scary especially to a person that worked all his life. It was during this time that Bob was diagnosed with cancer again. Dana was there to lend a helping hand while Bob had to go through chemo.\n\nBob was truly a remarkable man and was blessed to have such great friends like Micheal, Melissa and Dana. He would always say if you can count the number of friends you have on one hand then you truly made it.
