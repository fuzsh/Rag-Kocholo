        "text": "Though they are few and far between, several high-profile murders have occurred in Hollywood. These tragic deaths involved celebrities and some up-and-coming stars, and attracted attention of fans and the media.\n\nCelebrities may live rarefied lives, but that doesn’t mean they cannot be touched by tragedy. Murder has occurred in Hollywood more than we may like to acknowledge, and many beloved celebrities we know have met an untimely end in this manner.\n\nOften, some of these tragic murders have even been adapted for Hollywood movies, like Quentin Tarantino’s 2019 movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie. The movie partially explores the lead up to the death of one of the Manson Family Murders’ most high-profile victims, Sharon Tate.\n\nOther Hollywood murders have been adapted to documentaries, igniting decades of speculation and mysteries.\n\nCelebrities either wrapped up in murderous events or victims themselves include Tate, O.J. Simpson, Gianni Versace, and Selena Quintanilla-Pérez — but they are not the only ones. In recent years, YouTuber and The Voice singer Christina Grimmie was tragically shot at point-blank range in a concert in 2016, making for one of the most shocking and violent celebrity deaths of our time.\n\nIn most cases, justice has been served and we hope the families of these stars have found peace. But in some especially tragic instances, killers have escaped the justice system and cases have gone cold.\n\nKeep reading to see which other infamous murders shook Hollywood to its core, and what happened to those that took their lives from them.\n\nKeep reading to see which other infamous murders shook Hollywood to its core, and what happened afterward to those that took their lives from them."
