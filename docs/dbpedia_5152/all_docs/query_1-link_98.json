        "text": "WALNUT CREEK — Marvin Epstein was only 16 when he was admitted to Harvard. A high school teacher suggested that, at such a tender age, he wasn’t quite up to the rigors of an Ivy League university, so Epstein attended a school closer to his Pennsylvania home for a year before heading to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nWhether that additional year was what helped vault him to graduating from Harvard cum laude at age 20 we’ll never know, but it set in motion a distinguished medical career that included his work as a co-founder and leader at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek.\n\nEpstein, a longtime Walnut Creek resident, died Aug. 11 after a long illness. He was 93.\n\n“He wanted to provide whatever he thought the patients needed, and that’s what motivated him,” said Dr. Paul Chodroff of Lafayette, a friend of Epstein’s since 1970 who noted Epstein was an “extremely positive person” to whom people were drawn, and for whom they gave their best.\n\nA native of Sharon, Pennsylvania, Epstein first came to California after graduating from Harvard. Despite initial rejection from nearly every medical school where he applied, because of the quota system applied to Jewish medical students at the time, he eventually received his medical degree in 1948 from University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. After a residency at the Kaiser Permanente Foundation Hospital in Oakland, he and his family settled in Pleasant Hill.\n\nIn 1951, Epstein was a charter member of the Contra Costa Jewish Community Center, which became Temple Isaiah, the Lafayette synagogue Epstein attended for the rest of his life. A short stint in private practice in internal medicine with Harold S. Robinson in Walnut Creek proved pivotal; Epstein, Robinson and four other local physicians led the effort to establish in 1965 the John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek.\n\n“People responded to Marvin and to his desire to provide what was necessary,” Chodroff said. “He helped with John Muir’s growth from a small community hospital to a large medical center.”\n\nEpstein founded the hospital’s cardiac care unit and served as the unit’s medical director for many years. In 1987, he was the first physician to receive the John Muir Health Foundation Award of Distinction for outstanding leadership, service and philanthropy.\n\nThe last survivor of the six original founders, Epstein retired from John Muir in 1993, having served in many capacities, including chief of staff and board trustee.\n\n“He never presented himself as a ‘Type A’ (person), but inside that beautiful brain, he was,” said Ruth Epstein, Marvin’s wife of 40 years. “The second he got something accomplished, he’d go on to the next thing to do.”\n\nAnd he had a lot of things working, both before and after retirement. He wrote a history book/memoir, “In Sickness and Health: The Progress of Medical Care in Contra Costa County, 1951-2000,” published by the Contra Costa County Historical Society. He was a fan of the Walnut Creek-based Festival Opera and the San Francisco Symphony, she said, where he took delight in “sitting with the row of blue-haired ladies.” He was a frequent visitor of the Walnut Creek Yacht Club restaurant, too.\n\nWhile at John Muir, Epstein formed the Contra Costa Fishing Club, made up of hospital doctors (and others) who loved going out to sea to catch salmon, or not.\n\n“He said the fishing club is what brought him the greatest satisfaction,” Ruth Epstein said. “He loved fishing, but it was mostly about the relationships.”\n\nChodroff seconded that, saying watching Epstein with his grandsons on the fishing boat was a joy.\n\nEpstein was sad when his illness forced him to give up the fishing trips, Ruth said.\n\n“He loved life,” she said. “He wasn’t afraid of dying, but he didn’t want to miss the next get-together, the next wedding. He didn’t want to miss the party.”"
