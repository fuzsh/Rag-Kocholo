He also obtained his pilot's license.\n\nJohn was a loving and kind man to all he met, he believed in treating people with respect and kindness. He was a man of vast knowledge that knew a bit about everything and could engage in conversation with anyone about anything.

He enjoyed reading, with a distinct curiosity of history. Most importantly John treasured the time spent with family and friends, he was a loving husband, dad, grandpa and friend.\n\nHis parents precede him.
