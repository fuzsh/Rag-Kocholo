MARVIN BRYN MAWR. PA. -n - .J 'r '- This is not in any sense a genealogy. It is simply a record of those particularly connected with the wars of this country. S. S. M. V THE MARVIN WAR RECORD The Covipilcr of this Pamphlet, Sylvester S. Marvin, is of the eighth generation from Matthew' Marvin, the immigrant who, came to this country in the '• Increase \" in 1635, to settle in Hartford, Conn. Matthew' and his brother Reinold' who followed him to this country were yeomen, — tillers of the soil (from which all things come) \" as all their fathers were \". Stephen^ Marvin, the grandfather of the compiler, was one of the pioneer settlers of Ogden, N. Y., and all of his forbears, through the Revolutionary Soldier Icha- bod5 to the original settler, have run true to the type of their family, yeomen and pioneers. A more extended biography of the compiler will be found in the Marvin Genealogy. The Printer 0/ this Pamphlet, George R. Marvin, proprietor of the firm of T. R. Marvin & Son, of Boston, Mass., belongs to the eighth generation from Reinold' Marvin. The firm was established by his grandfather, T. R. Marvin, in 1823, who printed a genealogy of the Marvin family in 1845. It is now probably the oldest printing house continually under one family management, in the country. The concern printed \"The Marvin English Ancestry\" (1900), and also the Marvin Genealogy, — *' Descendants of Reinold and Matthew Marvin\" (1904), copies of which are, at this writing, still procurable. A PORTION OF THE WAR RECORD OF THE MARVIN FAMILY 1775-1921 COMPILED BY SYLVESTER S. MARVIN ASSISTED BY Mrs. MARY E. RUMSEY PRIVATELY PRINTED 1921 c -■ ♦ > 1 ASTOT: 150 COPIES •1 » •I. '; ■1 , ■> . . j FOREWORD Ever since the time of the original settlers, Reinold and Matthew, the Marvin family has had representatives in every war in which their country was engaged, — from the \" Dutch War \" to the \" World War\". It is probable that both brothers served in their local \"train bands \". It is certain that Lieuten- ant Reinold^ of Lyme, Conn., did, while his son, Reinold^ was known as \" Lyme's Captain \". Whether or not Matthew' or his son, Matthew^ served, is un- certain, but Samuel, 3 son of Matthew^ was a lieutenant, and his brother John^ was a sergeant. They were both of Norwalk, Conn. Captain Reinold was a man concerning whom interesting stories are told, for he was a \"character\" of great interest in Old Lyme, and it was near the old well there in 1694 or '95 that he made his historical proposal to Betty, daughter of Ensign Lee. Sitting on his sheepskin saddle, he reined in his horse by her side and said, — \" Betty, the Lord has com- manded me to marry you.\" Whereupon Betty looked down and replied, — \"The Lord's will be done!\" — a much more Puritanic reply than Priscilla Mullen's \" Why don't you speak for yourself, John.\" Ensign Lee's objections to the match did not prevent the publishing of the banns, which read : — \" Reinold Marvin and Betty Lee Do intend to marry : And though her dad opposed be. They will no longer tarry.\" The services of men of the Marvin name in the American Revolution should be a matter of pride to every American of 4 Foreivord that name and especially to the lineal descendants of those who were actively engaged in the war. From the Lexington alarm in 1775 till the termination of war in 1783, the family was represented both in the land and sea forces of the colonies. Marvins participated in the decisive battle leading to Burgoyne's surrender in 1777, in the terrible sufferings at Valley Forge, the frightful massacre at Wyoming, and in the siege of Yorktown. All those whose names appear on this record, with two excep- tions, are believed to have been descendants of Reinold and Matthew Marvin, pioneer settlers of Connecticut, and the identity of the\" majority has been established with reasonable certainty and reference made to the Marvin Genealogy, pub- lished in 1904, in which further details can be obtained. The facts obtained will be of especial service to those wishing to enroll in the Sons or Daughters of the Revolution. It is a family tradition that there were six of the name at Valley Forge, but definite data concerning service there only identifies four positively. They are as follows : CAPTAIN BENJAMIN, No. 3,* PRIVATE DAVID, No. 10, MAJOR ELIHU, No. 15, PRIVATE URIAH, No. 68. No pretense is made that the lists herewith are complete, although that of the Revolutionary service is made as nearly so as possible. It was with regret that we were obliged to omit the service in the Colonies, the War of 18 12, the Mexican War and many other military records, but the scope of this pamphlet did not allow it. The records of service in the Civil War and the World War are largely limited to the immediate relations of the compiler, though a conscientious effort was made to make it more inclusive. s. s. M.
