        "text": "Horton immediately did two things upon his arrival in Washington.\n\n“I went by and saw that I could get in law school – I could get transferred to GW at night – and I was going to work in the daytime. And I went by, cold called, and met Miss Newman. Getting a job like that would be like a dream come true. I had no idea, but I had an introduction, so I went by. I was received very warmly and cordially, but they didn’t have any vacancies. Miss Newman said to stay in touch, which was all the invitation I needed.”\n\nHorton did land a job in the correspondence section of the Farmers Home Administration in the Department of Agriculture.\n\n“Almost every morning as I walked to Agriculture from over near GW. I went up one side of the Washington Monument and walked around it and came down on the other side. On most pretty days I would meet President Truman on his walk. We were briefed somehow not to be too familiar, so I absolutely invariably limited my meeting to ‘Good morning, Mr. President,’ very briefly, never any hesitation or anything like that. That was how young government employees were supposed to be professional about greeting the president.\n\n“My big regret on that, which I have regretted ever since, was that I was so locked in on that protocol, because I had an uncle who was married to my daddy’s sister, named Bill Murray. He was assistant administrator at the Veterans Administration. He was from Missouri and played poker with Truman’s crowd literally two or three times a month. And I resisted saying, ‘Mr. President, Bill Murray is my uncle.’ There’s no telling what that would have gotten me! I’ll never know.”\n\nEven without President Truman’s help, Horton landed a job in the Supreme Court Library.\n\n“I worked in the correspondence section of Farmers Home, and they found out I could write letters, and I could type, and I was very accurate. I wrote letters for the administrator and a few – a few – for the Secretary of Agriculture, of which I was very proud. In the meantime, I kept contact – at least once a month or every two months between the time I started in August or September and the end of that first year – I would go over and meet with whoever I could meet with at the Supreme Court library. I finally went in one day and they hired me as an assistant librarian. It was wonderful!\n\n“There was a fellow, George Hutchinson, who was an assistant clerk who lived near GW, and if I could get to his apartment before he left, I had a ride. This was quite valuable considering how far it was, so I made sure I was there. He later became a clerk of the court and marshal of the court. We rode together from then until I transferred back to Carolina. I looked up citations and things for the justices, because that was when everything was in books. I had a library cart that you could put 50 books on, and that’s what I did. I looked up citations and marked them for the justices or for the clerks. Of course, I was absolutely in awe of them.\n\n“There was a tunnel between the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress that was only four feet wide which I used to access the Library of Congress. While I didn’t do any legal research for the Court, I did move tons of books from the Library of Congress. Often, when the interpretation of a general statute would be an issue, the legislative history would be important to the interpretation. I would be sent into the deepest basements of the Capitol to locate session laws that involved what was considered by the Congress before enacting a law.”\n\nHorton’s experience in Washington was truly unforgettable.\n\n“In fact, when I left, the administrative assistant to Mr. Justice Sherman Minton indicated to me if I could make law review at Carolina, I could be considered as a clerk for Mr. Justice Minton. But when I went back to Carolina, I couldn’t make it. I had so many conflicting issues that I just couldn’t make it. But on my last day there, I went by to see Mr. Justice Minton, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, because the staff had promised me signed portraits. I went by and picked up the portraits, which I still have.\n\n“And I went by to see Miss Newman. After a pleasant visit, I asked her how did she pick me to fill that very special job, which was much sought after. And she said, ‘Marvin, you were the only one who did not have a political endorsement, so we felt like we could fire you anytime we wanted to, without any political backlash.’”\n\nIn the fall of 1950 Horton decided that he wanted to practice in North Carolina, so he transferred back home to the UNC School of Law.\n\n“I’ll never forget it. I took my last exam at GW and caught the bus to Chapel Hill. I got there three weeks after the fall semester had started. But I hung in there and managed to graduate the following year. Lindsay Warren Jr. was a classmate, and his younger brother Charles was a classmate, and we graduated about the same time. Lindsay had been in the Army, so Charles had caught up with him.\n\n“But I had another classmate who was also a veteran. He was a major and was in an infantry reserve unit in Durham. Well, the draft was so close on my heels, I wasn’t sure that I could finish, and I wasn’t sure that if I finished that I would be around to take the bar, so he talked me into joining the infantry reserve as a recruit that fall. Then, after I finished school, I transferred to a unit in Greenville, and I kid you not, the infantry unit I had been in in Durham was sent to Korea, and I just missed it. Can you imagine the luck of that draw? I was in the USAR from 1950 to 1960, retiring as First Lieutenant AGC of the 3015th Reception Station.”\n\nHorton would experience even greater good fortune a few years later, but first he had to get his legal career underway.\n\n“I started out in Greenville in 1951,” Horton recalled. “L. H. Fountain was running for Congress in the 2nd District. I had a mentor, Dr. Paul Jones, who was in the state Senate. He was a dentist and a friend of L. H. Fountain’s older brother, V. E. Fountain. They were looking for a young lawyer, because L. H. had gotten the (Democratic Party) nomination, which back then was tantamount to winning the election, so I came over here in October of 1952 and I got all of his cases.\n\n“Interestingly, because he had been running for office, all of his cases had been continued because of the campaign. So they had a special term of Superior Court – three weeks, the first three weeks I was there. I came to Tarboro because I didn’t feel like I was getting enough trial practice in Greenville practicing by myself. We sat there at the defense table and George Fountain, who was later judge and resident judge, was what they called a solicitor, sat at the prosecution table, and for three weeks we tried every case trying to catch up. So I got what I bargained for.”\n\nProdded by his granddaughter, Horton recounts his first jury trial.\n\n“The first jury case I had – I mean I was green as a gourd – was a drunk driving case,” Horton said. “When I made my argument to the jury, all of the lawyers knew it was my first argument. I can’t recall the solicitor’s name, but I finished my argument and the solicitor started his argument to the jury.\n\n“Well, everybody in the courtroom, maybe five or six lawyers, came over and congratulated me. It was such a distraction – I think the jury felt like I had won the case because I was getting so many congratulations. The defendant was found not guilty, so I won my first jury case not on the facts but on the show. I never forgot that.”\n\nNor will he ever forget meeting his future wife of 68 years. The late Sharon Lewis Horton was born on April 9, 1931, in Du Quoin, Illinois, and died in their Tarboro home on July 15, 2022. Her husband, the obituary noted, referred to her as his “Favorite Star,” and described their meeting as “a fortuitous encounter in 1954.”\n\n“Her father was a history and English teacher in high schools and small colleges in Illinois, and he got a Ford grant-in-aid to do research for six months in Washington,” Horton said. “She and her mother went to Washington with him, and after two or three weeks of sightseeing, she decided she wanted to get a job.\n\n“She went over to Capitol Hill – I mean there is nothing like going for the plum – and there was somebody they had met or knew in L. H. Fountain’s office. He was running for re-election, and the primary was at that time the day after Memorial Day or something like that, and none of the staff wanted to come down to Tarboro, because Tarboro was really ‘the pits.’ The other staff picked her to come to Tarboro.”\n\nThe first thing Horton noticed, he said, was that she had the most beautiful elbows in the world. Immediately smitten, he finagled a blind date with the out-of-town visitor, nudging poor old Billy Goodwyn out of the way in the process, and the rest is history.\n\nHorton, who retired in 2015 following 64 years of active practice, is an emeritus member of the North Carolina Bar Association, which he joined in 1952. His legal legacy lives on in the work of his granddaughter.\n\n“If you will go around the corner into that room, which is the kitchen, and look on the acrylic table, there is a picture of us together from the day she was sworn in,” Horton said. “I think that the highest form of flattery is to have somebody emulate what you’ve done. To have someone that you admire follow in your footsteps is really a compliment.”\n\nRest assured, Marvin Horton, your legacy is in good hands."
