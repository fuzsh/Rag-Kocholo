        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nWell, tonight, Serena Williams takes the court at the U.S. Open to compete in what's expected to be the last major Grand Slam of her legendary career.\n\nMany consider Williams, who is now 40, the greatest tennis player of all time, and no one denies that she's changed the game.\n\nLet's take a look at the impact that she's had both on and off the court.\n\nWith each swing, each step, each day, Serena Williams inches closer to the end of an incomparable era of tennis. She has already taken home six titles here at the U.S. Open, but, this time, she says, will likely be her last.\n\nOver her 27-year pro career, Williams has won 856 matches, and lost just 154. That includes an astounding 365 major match wins, the most of all time, and 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most in the Open era. Off the court, she has shattered barriers, battling racism and sexism, redefining beauty, and setting new bars for financial success, earning not only $95 million in career prize money, the most of any women's tennis player in history, but also superstar big brand endorsements.\n\nShe has also repeatedly challenged the status quo, claiming her last major title while pregnant in 2017…\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nThe Williams sisters became fierce opponents and dominant teammates, becoming the first sister-duo to claim Olympic doubles gold in 2000, 2008, and 2012.\n\nBut their success didn't shield them from blatant racism. After the crowd hurled racial slurs at the family during the 2001 Indian Wells tournament in California, Serena boycotted the event for 14 years. When she returned in 2015, she explained why in a \"TIME\" magazine op-ed, writing — quote — \"Indian Wells was a pivotal moment of my story, and I am a part of the tournament's story as well. Together, we have a chance to write a different ending.\"\n\nAnother ending now nears, as Williams hints at her next chapter in life. On Friday, in New York City, Williams, whose venture capital firm Serena Ventures has raised $111 million, rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, mere days before what's expected to be her final major tennis tournament.\n\nChris Evert:\n\nI think that Serena has contributed probably more off the court than on the court.\n\nI mean, I look at her off the court. I look at her fearlessness you know, body shaming to women of color, to mothers working. She's really spoken up for a lot of issues.\n\nI think the fact, on the tennis court, she's brought a new level of power into the game. And so she has been — she has revolutionized power in women's tennis. I put her right up there with Muhammad Ali and Billie Jean King and Michael Jordan and — as far as superstar-superstar.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nLet's delve more into Serena Williams' incredible career and legacy with William C. Rhoden. He has long covered her, as well as her sister, Venus, and many other tennis greats.\n\nHe's been writing about her accomplishments for the sports and culture Web site Andscape.\n\nBill Rhoden, welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\" Always good to have you here.\n\nWe're talking about Serena's next chapter, because of this essay she wrote in \"Vogue.\" But she didn't say retirement. She said transition. She said evolution. What does that mean to you, and what did you think when you read it?\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden, Andscape:\n\nWell, the first thing that got me is when she said the R-word, because that terrifies me too.\n\nThat's the thing that resonated with me, just the idea of not doing something that you have been doing, in my case, since I was like 10 years old, and the idea of not retiring. And I know how terrifying it has to be for her to be 8 years old, to come from Compton, to become what I think, along with her sister — I have been doing this now for 49 years.\n\nAnd I think, without doubt, the story of Venus and Serena Williams is probably the greatest sports story in United States history, bar none. And for her to finally wake up one day and look at her daughter, say, you know what, I just don't want to do this anymore. I know that has to be hard. It has to be pulling at her heart.\n\nBut if there's any solace, is that what she has accomplished for women, for Black women, for equity, I think, at this point of our history, is unparalleled. I think it's just — we're at the point now it's still fresh, and words, all the wordsmiths, words can't really describe the impact that she has had at so many levels.\n\nI think about my Black mother, my Black sister, my Black daughter, and what she's meant for them in terms of empowerment, in terms of confidence, in terms of victory. It's just — it's just such mixed emotions, because I hate to see her go. I hate to see her go. But I'm so excited about these next chapters.\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden:\n\nWell, just — and Chris Evert mentioned it too, just the introduction of power.\n\nAnd Venus, by the way, I have got to say, Venus was sort of the precursor to that, because we had never seen anybody with that type of power before. Serena just took it to a whole 'nother level, of just playing a pure power game.\n\nAnd I also think that we have to talk about the intimidation factor. And this was so liberating, I think, to women athletes, and that, hey, man, you could get up there and you could sweat. You could be a sweat-getter. Sometimes, you could curse if you want to.\n\nAnd I think that was just so liberating. I think that her competitiveness is — to me, is what sets her apart. She's just such a ferocious competitor. So, I think that the — the power, but the power in combination with just being a ferocious competitor, I think, is really what has made her a timeless figure in that sport.\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden:\n\nThat's — if you have ever been to — I was fortunate to see Aretha and Beyonce kind of out the side of my eye.\n\nBut, with Aretha, Aretha was just this natural force. She is just a natural — she's just this natural force of nature. And you leave a concert from her and you have — there's no mistaking how she felt about life.\n\nAnd I think that, with Serena, she left all her emotions on the court. There was no — I mean, I know she's probably not proud of this one, but she confronted that poor line judge. And she told her what she was going to do with that racket, how she was going to stick it down her throat.\n\nAnd Serena is one of the sweetest people you would want to meet off the court. But, there, anybody at courtside, they're like, yikes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden:\n\nSo, she — you — after a Serena Williams match — and I'm sure, if it happens tonight, you will know exactly how she feels. She's not going to prettify it. She's not going to sugarcoat.\n\nAnd that's what I love about her, is just that she really leaves — it's just so raw, and she leaves it on the court. I just think that's — just what she's done for that sport is phenomenal.\n\nAnd I will say — it's probably not going to happen, but there should be statues of Venus and Serena in Australia, at the French Open, in Wimbledon, at the U.S. Open. There should be statues at each one of those Grand Slams for what they have done for this sport.\n\nI think that, like I said, right now, it's kind of hard for us to take the measure of it because it's so new and fresh, but it's just immeasurable."
