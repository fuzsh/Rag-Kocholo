        "text": "On August 22, 2023, Serena Williams and husband Alexis O’Hanian confirmed that they have become parents to a second daughter, Adira River Ohanian. The couple first became parents to daughter Olympia on September 1, 2017.\n\nHas Serena Williams retired?\n\nSerena Williams is now believed to have played her final tennis match. She lost to Ajla Tomljanovic 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 in the third round of the 2022 US Open.\n\nShe announced that she intends to “evolve” away from tennis into a new life path. In an essay she wrote for Vogue, released on August 9, 2022, she said that her current schedule was about to lead her into retirement, although she did not like using that word directly. She explained that she was exploring other options, including a focus on her venture capital business, and trying to expand her family.\n\nWhile speaking at the A+E Networks and the History Channel’s “History Talks” series held in Washington, DC in September, Williams said, “I just needed to stop,” as quoted by Vanity Fair. “I always said I wanted to stop when I’m playing really good tennis and winning and beating good players. For me, it’s really about things I want to do spiritually and spending time with my daughter and family. As a super hands-on mom, I can’t tell you how hard it was. I lost so many matches after I had Olympia because it was so hard to be on the court. I feel like I’ve given so much of my life to tennis, my entire life, that it’s time to do something different for me and also work on other things.”\n\nDid Serena Williams play at the 2022 US Open?\n\nSerena Williams did play the 2022 US Open and made a stirring run to the third round. The American defeated Danka Kovinic in the first round and then defeated the second seed Anett Kontaveit7-6, 2-6, 6-2. In a wild third round contest, Williams was defeated by Ajla Tomljanovic 7-5, 6-7, 6-1.\n\nWilliams also played Toronto and Cincinnati, the two big tune-up events leading up to the US Open, after her first round exit at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nHow did Serena Williams fare at Wimbledon in 2022?\n\nAfter months when it seemed as if she was heading into retirement, Williams sparked a frenzy on social media on June 14, 2022 when she posted a photo on Instagram, showing her wearing grass-court shoes and standing on a grass court, with the caption: “SW and SW19, it’s a date. 2022. See you there. Let’s go”.\n\nBecause she left it too late to enter using her protected ranking, Serena needed a wildcard to enter the tournament and later on June 14, the confirmation came from Wimbledon.\n\nWilliams lost in the first round, going down to Frenchwoman Harmony Tan 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (10-7) in a three-hour plus epic.\n\nWhat is her nationality and when was Serena born?\n\nSerena Williams was born on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, USA.
