        "text": "BUENA VISTA TOWNSHIP, MI — Officials here plan to host a family-friendly, Juneteenth-inspired outdoor movie screening of “King Richard” next week.\n\nThe film — which depicts the early careers of tennis star sisters Venus and Serena Williams, who was born in Saginaw — will begin at dusk Friday, June 17, at Towne Green Park in Buena Vista Township. The property housed Fort Saginaw Mall before the building there was demolished in 2010.\n\nWhile the movie will begin when the sun sets, the free event kicks off at 6 p.m., organizers said. Food truck vendors including Kona Ice and Waffle Hut will be parked at the site until midnight.\n\nEarly weather forecasts for June 17 predict clear skies and temperatures in the 80-degrees range. The sun sets at 9:19 p.m. that day.\n\nBuena Vista Township officials also saw favorable weather the first time they organized a drive-in movie screening. Hundreds of families gathered for “Godzilla vs. Kong” in July 2021. Last year’s attendees watched the monster movie on a 30-by-17 foot mobile movie screen while seated in their vehicles parked in the Towne Green Park’s 33-acre grassy lot. Others sat on lawn chairs and picnic blankets directly in front of the movie screen.\n\nThe movie selection this year earned an Oscar win, albeit amidst a now-infamous moment in TV history. Minutes after a physical altercation with comedian Chris Rock at the Academy Awards, actor Will Smith accepted a Best Actor win for portraying the Williams sisters’ ambitious father and the title character in “King Richard.”\n\nThe PG-13-rated drama features a runtime of 144 minutes.\n\nThe Buena Vista event will represent the first of two drive-in movie experiences tied to Juneteenth celebrations in Saginaw County next weekend.\n\nThe 2022 Old Saginaw City Lawn Chair Film Festival will feature a free screening of “The Wiz” Sunday, June 19. The 1978 film adaptation of “The Wizard of Oz” will be shown at dusk in the parking lot at the corner of Ames and North Hamilton in Old Town Saginaw.\n\nRead more on MLive:\n\nSVSU transit center, Flint road work included in Kildee’s $46.8M budget proposal\n\n160-foot-tall water tower could neighbor Saginaw Water Treatment Plant"
