        "text": "Bio Serena Jameka Williams. The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has ranked her world No. 1 in singles on seven separate occasions. She became the world No. 1 for the first time on July 8, 2002, and achieved this ranking for the sixth time on February 18, 2013. On the sixth occasion, she held the ranking for 186 consecutive weeks, setting the joint record with Steffi Graf for the most consecutive weeks as world No. 1 by a female tennis player. In total, she has been world no. 1 for 309 weeks, which ranks her 3rd in the Open Era among female tennis players. Williams is regarded by some commentators, sports writers, and current and former players as the greatest female tennis player of all time.\n\nWilliams holds the most major singles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles combined amongst active players, male or female. Her record of 39 major titles puts her fourth on the all-time list and second in the open era with: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She is the most recent player, male or female, to have held all four major singles titles simultaneously (2002–03 and 2014–15), and only the third player, male or female, to achieve this record twice after Rod Laver and Steffi Graf. She is also the most recent player, together with her sister Venus Williams, to have held all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles simultaneously (2009–10).\n\nHer total of 23 Grand Slam singles titles marks the record for the most Major wins by a tennis player (male or female) in the Open Era, and is for second on the all-time list behind Margaret Court (24). She is the only tennis player – female or male – to have won singles titles at least six times in three of the four Grand Slam tournaments and the only player ever to have won 2 of the 4 Majors 7 times each (7 Wimbledon titles and 7 Australian Open titles). She is also the only tennis player to have won 10 Grand Slam singles titles in two separate decades. She has won an all-time record of 13 Grand Slam singles titles on hardcourt. Williams holds the Open Era record for most titles won at the Australian Open (7) and shares the Open Era record for most titles won at the US Open with Chris Evert (6). She also holds an all-time record for the most singles matches won at the Grand Slams with 316 matches (through the 2017 Australian Open).\n\nShe has won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister Venus and the pair are unbeaten in Grand Slam tournament finals. As a team, she and Venus have the second most women's doubles grand slam titles, only behind the 20 titles won by Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver. Williams is also a five-time winner of the WTA Tour Championships in singles. The arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with launching a new era of power tennis in the women's game. Williams has won four Olympic gold medals, one in women's singles and three in women's doubles, an all-time record shared with her sister Venus Williams.\n\nThe arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with ushering in a new era of power on the women's professional tennis tour. Williams was the highest-paid female athlete in 2016, earning $28.9 million in prize money and endorsements. In December 2015, she was named Sportsperson of the Year by Sports Illustrated magazine.\n\nSerena Jameka Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price, and is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea and Isha Price, and full sister Venus. When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California, where Williams started playing tennis at the age of three. Her father home-schooled Serena and her sister Venus. While he and subsequently her mother, Oracene, have been the official coaches, other mentors who helped her learn the game included the Richard Williams in Compton who would go on to found The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis/Tutorial Academy.\n\nWilliams's family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida, when she was nine so that she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who would provide additional coaching. Macci spotted the exceptional talents of the sisters. He did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10 since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Another factor was racial, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1 among under-10 players in Florida. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded:\n\n\"Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and me, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us.\"\n\nWilliams is primarily a baseline player and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve, the return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a \"high risk\" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which some say is the greatest in women's tennis history. She consistently projects great pace and placement with her serves and in the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of 128.6 mph (207.0 km/h) which is the third-fastest all-time among female players (only Venus's 129 mph and Sabine Lisicki's 131 mph recorded speeds are faster). What makes her serve even more deadly is her ball placement and her ability to consistently place powerful shots with great accuracy. At the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, she hit a women's tournament record of 102 aces which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks. Williams also possesses a very solid and powerful overhead. Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also plays a strong defensive game. She has stated that her favorite surface is clay because it gives her extra time to set up her shot.\n\nShe has won three Grand Slam singles titles after saving match points, (2003 Australian Open versus Kim Clijsters, 2005 Australian Open versus Maria Sharapova, and 2009 Wimbledon versus Elena Dementieva), more than any other player in history, male or female. She also came back from a 3–5 deficit in the third set against Kim Clijsters in the 1999 US Open and went on to win her first Grand Slam singles title. In the 2012 US Open final against Victoria Azarenka, she was down 3–5 in the third set and found herself two points away from losing the match. Williams then proceeded to win the next 4 games and defeated Azarenka. In recent years, Williams has shown an ability to serve aces at critical moments. One of these instances was the 2013 French Open final, where in the last game of the match, she fired three aces, including one clocked at 123 mph (198 km/h) on match point. In the semi-finals of the 2015 French Open, Williams was ill and barely able to walk during changeovers, yet beat her opponent, Timea Bacsinszky, 6–0 in the third set. Another improbable win occurred in the third round of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships when she recovered from two breaks of service in the third set to defeat Great Britain's No. 1 female player, Heather Watson. Williams has bounced back from a set down to win in 37 Grand Slam matches.\n\nIn recent years, Williams has shown an ability to serve aces at critical moments. One of these instances was the 2013 French Open final, where in the last game of the match, she fired three aces, including one which clocked at 123 mph (198 km/h) on match point. She repeated the feat similarly against Angelique Kerber in the finals of the 2016 Wimbledon Championships to tie the Open Era record for Grand Slam singles titles. Williams fired three un-returnable serves in her final service game before winning the match and the title with a casual forehand volley on the next point.\n\nWilliams is married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. They were married on November 16, 2017, in New Orleans. Guests at the wedding included Beyoncé, Anna Wintour, Kelly Rowland, and Kim Kardashian West. She planned to move to San Francisco with Ohanian after the wedding.\n\nOn April 19, 2017, Williams posted a sideways picture of herself on Snapchat focused on her midsection. It had the caption, \"20 weeks\", sparking speculation that Williams was pregnant. Later that evening, her spokesperson confirmed that the couple was expecting. The fact that she was 20 weeks pregnant when announcing her pregnancy meant that she was 8 weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open in January. Serena later confirmed that posting the photo on Snapchat was an accident and that she had intended to save the photo for her records.\n\nIn September 2017, Williams gave birth to a daughter. Williams had a cesarean-section delivery due to complications (specifically, a blood clot in her lungs, referred to as a pulmonary embolism) during the labor of her daughter and, at first, was devastated about it. She suffered another pulmonary embolism after giving birth, leaving her bedridden for six weeks and delaying her return to training. In August 2018, Serena announced she was suffering from postpartum depression. Williams gave her daughter a doll, Qai Qai that has become famous on social media.\n\nWilliams was raised a Jehovah's Witness, but says she has \"never really practiced it.\" She often thanks Jehovah after winning matches. Williams confirmed that she follows some practices: \"Olympia doesn't celebrate birthdays. We're Jehovah's Witnesses, so we don't do that.\"\n\nWilliams' 2018 US Open ended in controversy, with Williams falling to Naomi Osaka in straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of the final. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs-up, and demanded an apology from chair umpire Carlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he had been coaching. She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams has assessed a game penalty. Williams said that she believed she had been treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman. She was fined a total of $17,000, which included $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.\n\nIn addition to English as her native language, Williams also speaks conversational French, and knows some Spanish and Italian. At the 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018 French Open she gave her on-court interviews in French, much to the crowd's delight."
