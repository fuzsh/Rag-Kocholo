        "text": "By popular demand, we now feature another tennis cutie pie, Serena Williams. Serena Williams is 27 years old and was born in Saginaw, Michigan, USA. She currently resides in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, USA.\n\nSerena Williams is currently ranked No. 3 in the world. She reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002. She was ranked No. 1 again earlier this year. She has 32 career Sony Ericsson WTA Tour singles titles including nine Grand Slam titles, three each at the Australian Open and US Open, one at Roland Garros, and two at Wimbledon.\n\nAmong her four singles and two doubles titles this year were a singles victory at the US Open, which vaulted her for a short time to the No. 1 world ranking, and an Olympic doubles medal with her sister, Venus Williams. She is currently ranked No. 28 in doubles.\n\nSerena’s career earnings so far have been $21,761,407. Now that’s a chunk of change!\n\nThat’s just her tennis earnings. You perhaps have seen her doing commercials of her personal clothing line, Aneras (her name spelled backwards). And she has certainly made a chunk with her modeling career. If you’re looking for money, she’s got some!\n\nWe’ll keep you posted in the coming months on her tennis tournament results, as well as post some more of her sexy pictures. She has a ton of them!"
