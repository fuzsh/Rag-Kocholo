In the article that is reporting on Nike’s latest campaign, it is not only publicizing Nike, but Serena Williams as well. Nike is receiving the Internet’s coverage of media for free. Although Nike paid for the billboard, they did not pay for all of the publication they are getting from the Internet because of this article and many others like it. If Nike was aware of this happening, which I am sure they were, they picked Serena Williams to feature on their masterpiece because she is in the news often with her recent major wins in tennis. The article does a good job of listing her achievements; in turn this helps Nike out because an amazing and credited athlete is receiving praise from Nike.\n\nSerena has never let any problem or injury stop her from being the best, which helped her in her professional career. At the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Serena won gold with Venus in the Women's Double. She has over 100 career wins in singles, doubles, and teams including 4 olympic gold medals.

She is only one of six women to complete a grand slam. She dubbed her winning of all of these major titles as the “Serena Slam”. She had a series of highs as well as a series of lows. She had knee surgery in August of the year 2003, and in September of that same year, her half-sister Yetunda Price was murdered in Los Angeles, California due to a random act of violence.

In 2009 she won her place back as ranking top in the world by winning the Australian Open singles for the fourth time as well as the Wimbledon singles for the third time. After this high, Serena hit another low when not everything went as smoothly as it could have been. She made headlines for calling out a lineswoman for a foot-fault that was called during her semifinal loss to Kim Clijsters at the U.S. Open.

She becomes popular today and she made an awesome winner. She is total in this sport. She also did the breast reduction to reduce her bust size to 34C from the previous 34DD.
