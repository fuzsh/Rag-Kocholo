        "text": "Serena Williams will marry Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian this week, according to reports.\n\nThe couple will wed in New Orleans, People reported, with guests arriving as early as Wednesday. The Daily Mail first reported details of the upcoming wedding, which reports say will take place Thursday at the city's Contemporary Arts Center.\n\nThe winner of 23 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams has been engaged to Ohanian, 34, since December. She and Ohanian are parents to Alexis Olympia, who was born Sept. 1.\n\nWilliams, 36, made her first red-carpet appearance since giving birth in New York on Monday, appearing at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards.\n\nIn April, Williams joked about falling for a nerd at her TED talk with Gayle King.\n\n“He’s very loving and he’s very kind,” she said. “My mom says he’s very considerate and when she said that to me, I was like you know he really is. It’s the little things that really make a huge difference in life.”\n\nShe has repeatedly said she'll return to tennis. It remains to be seen whether it's at the Australian Open, which begins Jan. 15."
