        "text": "Serena Williams embodies courage, power and style and has already overcome almost insurmountable obstacles in her career to win 23 Grand Slam titles.\n\nIn 2022, she ended her exceptional career in front of 24,000 fans at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York at the US Open - for us, an occasion to look back on her successes. And that goes beyond her sporting achievements. After all, her successes off the court in the areas of fashion, social commitment and business make her one of the best-known and most inspiring icons in the world. She is also a family man: she has been married to Alexis Ohanian since 2017. In the same year, the two became parents to daughter Alexis Olympia. In early 2019, Serena also founded her own VC firm, Serena Ventures.\n\nThat's the power woman Serena Williams!\n\nUntil the end of her career in 2022, Serena Williams was not only a real powerhouse on the tennis court. The top athlete also scores with genuine emotions and social commitment. Poignant moments such as the 2019 Wimbledon press conference, where she promised to never stop fighting for social justice, make the tennis icon a role model and particularly popular with her fans. Moreover, as a competitive athlete who is at the same time a mother of a young daughter, she is considered a real hero.\n\nSerena Williams was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan, the daughter of Richard Williams and Oracene Price. She was the youngest of five sisters. She had three half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea and Isha Price on her mother's side and a full sister Venus Williams.\n\nSerena was an exceptional talent and began playing tennis with her sister Venus at the young age of four. A short time later, they attended Rick Macci's tennis academy. There her skills and talent were nurtured and further developed.\n\nBy 1991, she had gone 46-3 on the United States Tennis Association Junior Tour.\n\nSerena Williams is the only tennis player to ever achieve a golden career Grand Slam in singles and doubles. She has won a total of 39 Grand Slam titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles and 2 in mixed doubles. Her record of Grand Slam victories puts her third in the world rankings and second in the Open era.\n\nTogether with her sister Venus, she won a record 3 times gold in doubles at the Olympics as a team. In 2013, she became the oldest No. 1 player at the age of 31 years and 4 months. Serena Williams is the only tennis player in history (women's and men's) to win the singles title at least six times in three of the four Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open). She holds the record for winning the most women's singles matches at Grand Slams.\n\nGrand Slam singles wins: Australian Open (2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2017), French Open (2002, 2013, 2015), Wimbledon (2002, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2016), U.S. Open (1999, 2002, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014).\n\nGrand Slam doubles wins: Australian Open (2001, 2003, 2009, 2010), French Open (1999, 2010), Wimbledon (2000, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2016), US Open (1999, 2009).\n\nIt's not just on the tennis court that things are going well for the athlete. Serena Williams is also very successful financially. According to Statista.com, the tennis icon's estimated fortune in 2022 is around 185 million euros. Serena Williams won numerous major tennis tournaments in her tennis career and was able to earn prize money in the amount of 94,236,271 US dollars. In addition, Serena Williams has numerous lucrative advertising contracts with renowned brands such as Nike and Intel. In 2016, she earned $28.9 million in prize money and advertising revenue, making her the highest-paid female athlete of the year. Her income in 2022 is estimated at around 10 million euros."
