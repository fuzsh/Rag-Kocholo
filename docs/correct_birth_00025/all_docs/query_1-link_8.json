        "text": "SAGINAW, MI\n\nâ€” Tennis star Serena Williams was honored this week as a new member of the\n\n.\n\nAlthough Williams' achievements on the tennis court easily merits induction, it is debatable if she should be included in a \"Michigan\" or \"Saginaw\" Hall of Fame.\n\nSerena Williams was born Sept. 26, 1981, in Saginaw to Richard Williams and Oracene Price. Her older sister, Venus Williams, was born in Lynwood, Calif.\n\nWhile Serena Williams was still an infant, her family moved to Compton, Calif.\n\nSerena Williams has won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, including the 2012 Wimbledon title.\n\nBut should she be considered for honors reserved for Michigan or Saginaw athletes?\n\nShe is not eligible for induction into the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\"We have four criteria for nomination, and she does not qualify,\" Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame president Jack Tany said. \"One of the criteria is that the person needs to have resided in Saginaw County during her achievements, which she didn't.\n\n\"She's not the only person who fails to qualify under that criteria. Ray Harroun, the first Indy 500 winner, wasn't originally from Saginaw. He didn't live in Saginaw when he won the Indy 500.\n\n\"He moved to Saginaw later in his life and only lived here a short time after he was done racing.\n\n\"In the same way that Ray Harroun is not eligible, Serena Williams would not be eligible.\""
