        "text": "Serena Williams, (born Sept. 26, 1981, Saginaw, Mich., U.S.), U.S. tennis player. Serena and her sister Venus were introduced to the sport by their father, who recognized their talent early on. Serena turned professional in 1995, just one year after Venus. Possessing powerful ground strokes and superb athleticism, the sisters were soon dominating women’s professional tennis. Serena won six career U.S. Open titles (1999, 2002, 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014), three French Opens (2002, 2013, and 2015), seven Wimbledon championships (2002, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2016), and seven Australian Opens (2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017). Her 23 total Grand Slam singles titles are the most for both women and men during the open era. In Olympic competition, she won gold medals in the singles event (2012) and (with Venus) in women’s doubles (2000, 2008, and 2012). In 2022 she announced her retirement."
