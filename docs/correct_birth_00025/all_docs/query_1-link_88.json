        "text": "Serena Williams has admitted that she has not ruled out a stunning return to tennis. The 23-time Grand Slam winner tearfully walked away from the sport at the 2022 US Open when she lost to Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round.\n\nNow the iconic 42-year-old has to content herself with a place in the stands or her sofa at home as a spectator when Wimbledon comes around. As is often the case for athletes in the first years of their retirement, Williams admitted she has found watching tennis to be a struggle.\n\nIn a recent interview, the Michigan native revealed that she had to turn the television off as it became too painful for her to watch. It was while reflecting on those feelings the tennis legend said that she still has the idea of an astounding return to tennis in the back of her mind.\n\nWhile speaking to Vanity Fair, Williams was asked about her feelings on the sport. She said: \"I miss it, and I think that’s normal. It’s normal to miss something that you’ve done since the day you were born.\"\n\nWhen asked if she can watch the likes of Wimbledon or the US Open in her spare time, she added: \"Oh my God. I just can’t right now.\" When reflecting on the possibility of picking up the racquet again, Williams said: \"I think as long as I’m healthy, that’s always going to be in the back of my mind. I stay fit. I stay healthy. When I’m watching, it’s like, 'Okay, well, you could be out there too'.”\n\nAs well as retiring as the greatest women's tennis player of all time, Williams also walked away from the sport as a mother to her daughter Olympia. She has since gone on to have her second child, Adira, with her husband Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit.\n\nNow she is not able to compete anymore, Williams is often spending her time volunteering at her daughter's school. In another interview with Today, she said: \"As a mom, I’m actually way more active than what I was during tennis. Obviously, (with) tennis, I was playing Wimbledon and stuff. But, as a mom, I’m gone all day. I’m really competitive about it, too. I sign my name up whenever I can, whenever there’s a spot open.”"
