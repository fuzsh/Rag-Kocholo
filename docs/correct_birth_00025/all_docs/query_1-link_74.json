        "text": "The Hollywood producer has seen them come and go over the last 24 years: blowhards and egomaniacs and self-deluding hacks, wunderkinds and wondrous talents and a staggering parade of frauds. He has clashed with Oliver Stone, launched Julia Roberts, survived Barbra Streisand. The Hollywood producer reads people for a living. He has become very rich. He met Richard Williams—father, coach and manager of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams—​​late in 1997, after having bought a big chunk of the Puma sneaker and apparel company and deciding to pursue an endorsement deal with Serena. The two men began to talk. Then they began to negotiate. The Hollywood producer had rarely been so confounded.\n\n\"You know when you meet somebody, and you think he's either insane or he's a genius?\" says the producer, Arnon Milchan, founder of New Regency Productions. \"But if he's insane, he's still fascinating, because you've never seen somebody so crazy in that way? You say, 'It's probably impossible, but this guy looks like he's in good faith.' What he's saying you've never heard before.\n\n\"He's saying, 'I knew. I was planning this before the girls were born.' That's like I would tell you that I knew Pretty Woman would exist before it was a script, and that it would be a great script, and I knew I was going to discover Julia Roberts, and she was going to be Number 1. In my world if I say those things, somebody will say, 'What mushrooms did Arnon take?'\"\n\nForgive Milchan his discombobulation. It's 4:30 a.m., the\n\nmid-May morning just beginning to break over the Mediterranean.\n\nMilchan is staying in the French town of Antibes while attending\n\nthe 52nd Cannes International Film Festival, and he needs his\n\nrest. Today two of his megabudget films premiere, Entrapment at\n\nCannes and William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in\n\nthe U.S. But jet lag and the recent screen tests Milchan\n\narranged for Venus and Serena have him babbling at high speed.\n\nWhen he sat across his desk from Richard Dove Williams that day\n\na year and a half ago, Milchan faced a cotton picker's son who\n\nhad dropped out of high school at 16; raised his family in the\n\ngangland jungle of Compton, Calif.; taught himself tennis; felt\n\nbeyond reason that his girls would be great at the sport; and\n\ngambled plenty of money that he was right. Serena was ranked\n\n99th in the world then, but Richard--against the advice of his\n\nclosest advisers--kept bending the bargaining away from a big\n\npayment up front and toward huge incentive payoffs when, not if,\n\nSerena cracked the Top 10, the Top 5, the top spot at last.\n\nMilchan, a man who's estimated to be worth more than some movie< studios, didn't understand. How could this man have such confidence? What about the unknown? What about injuries? \"Then you think, Wait a minute, where's the upside for him if he's lying?\" Milchan says. \"There's no upside. So there are only two possibilities: Either he's totally crazy--but that's impossible, because there's something totally sane and healthy about his family--or he knows something I don't.\"\n\nMilchan has never found out all that Richard Williams knows. He\n\nsees only what everyone else has seen this spring: After years\n\nof hype and hope and controversy, Venus and Serena Williams have\n\nbecome the hottest players--male or female--in tennis, an\n\nunprecedented sister act that threatens to overwhelm the sport\n\nwith power, athleticism and in-your-face attitude. Already this\n\nyear 18-year-old Venus and 17-year-old Serena have met in a\n\nhistoric final (at the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne,\n\nFla., on March 28), won WTA tournaments on the same day (Venus\n\nthe IGA Superthrift Tennis Classic in Oklahoma City and Serena\n\nthe Open Gaz de France in Paris on Feb. 28) and, with six\n\ntournament wins between them (four for fifth-ranked Venus and\n\ntwo for No. 10 Serena), begun to crowd No. 1 Martina Hingis atop\n\nthe money list like a pair of bullies plotting to take her milk\n\nmoney. \"They're the strongest opponents on tour,\" Hingis says.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting them so fast, you know?\" says 19th-ranked\n\nIrina Spirlea, who infamously bumped Venus during a changeover\n\nat the 1997 U.S. Open, beat Serena on the same court a year\n\nlater and was manhandled 6-2, 6-3 by Serena three weeks ago at\n\nthe Italian Open in Rome. \"Sometimes I'm in awe. They have\n\nsomething the others don't have.\"\n\nAnd, boy, do they know it. Now that their braces have been\n\nremoved, Venus and Serena have taken off the gloves as well,\n\nvowing to make the French Open and Wimbledon singles trophies\n\nfamily property. Serena, who is in just her second year on\n\ntour--and is still looking to advance past the fourth round in\n\nthe singles of a Grand Slam--blithely predicts that she will win\n\nat the All-England Club in July. \"I can see myself lifting that\n\nplate for sure,\" she says. \"I just can't see it not happening.\"\n\nTo which Venus, who has only been to one Slam final, at the 1997 U.S. Open, responds, \"If she's going to take Wimbledon, I have to take the French. That's how I feel.\"\n\nThat both girls deliver such mind-bending pronouncements while\n\nalternately giggling and glowering is part of their charm. \"They\n\nbring life to the game, a different dimension to the game,\" says\n\nBruce Schilling, director of U.S. sports marketing for Nike.\n\n\"Tennis is a finite world. They expand the boundaries, and that\n\nis--uh, would have been--good for us.\"\n\nForgive Schilling his disappointment. Nike lost out to Puma in\n\nthe bidding for Serena 16 months ago--just as it lost out when\n\nReebok signed Venus in May 1995--but how was Schilling or anyone\n\nelse at Nike to know that a big sneaker deal wouldn't be mega\n\nenough for Richard Williams? Richard is predicting that his\n\ngirls will be \"bigger than Michael Jordan,\" and who better than\n\na movie mogul to set his crossover conquest in motion?\n\nOn April 15 Serena cracked the Top 10 for the first time,\n\ntilting the deal Richard struck with Milchan in Serena's favor\n\nto the tune of $2.5 million a year for the remainder of the\n\nfive-year contract. \"Now we're paying a ton of money to Serena,\n\nand we love it!\" says Milchan, who also owns the WTA's\n\ninternational television rights. Better yet, after Venus's and\n\nSerena's screen tests last March, Milchan is convinced that the\n\nWilliamses \"have the goods\" to be multimedia stars, players in\n\nmovies or TV sitcoms. \"The camera loves them,\" Milchan says,\n\n\"and the incredible thing is, they're not even 20 years old.\"\n\nYesterday's fool is driving 90 mph with no hands. His left thigh\n\nis wedged under the steering wheel of the black Mercedes ML320,\n\nand with the slightest nudge Richard Williams makes the SUV\n\nglide from lane to lane. His large hands flutter about, juggling\n\ntwo constantly chirping cellular phones and a rumpled green pack\n\nof cigarillos. It's 8:20 on the morning of April 27, and the sun\n\nis beginning to sizzle on I-95 outside Jupiter, Fla. Serena is\n\non one of the three courts back at the family house in Palm\n\nBeach Gardens, practicing on clay. Venus and her mother,\n\nOracene, are in Hamburg for a tournament. Richard is rocketing\n\nnorth to Fort Pierce to give what he calls a \"motivational\n\nspeech\" to administrators at an elementary school. He's 57 years\n\nold. Even while he squints against the harsh light, his eyes\n\nglitter like precious stones.\n\nRichard begins reciting the family saga, worn smooth by years of\n\nconstant handling: How he met Oracene at a bus stop in Los\n\nAngeles and loved \"her big old gorgeous beautiful legs\" and told\n\nher right then and there that he wanted to marry her and have\n\nfive girls. How one day, after the first three\n\ndaughters--Yetunde, Isha and Lyndrea--were born, he saw Virginia\n\nRuzici receive a $30,000 check on television for winning a\n\ntennis tournament, and he decided his next two kids would play\n\ntennis. How Oracene resisted having more children, and he hid\n\nher birth-control pills and wooed her with romantic dinners. How\n\nVenus ran a 5:29 mile at eight years old and how Richard grew so\n\ndisgusted that year with the maniacal parents infesting junior\n\ntennis that he tried to make Venus quit the game. \"She used to\n\nlove it so much, I had to try to take the racket from her,\"\n\nRichard says, \"but she wouldn't give it up. Right now we would\n\nlike her to retire at 22. I don't think she will.\"\n\nThirty seconds later he says, \"When we got started in tennis, it\n\nwas to go out and make a lot of money. Believe me, we have made\n\ntons, and I'll make even more.\"\n\nA cell phone beeps. It's Richard Dove Williams III, 33, one of\n\nhis two sons from an earlier marriage. Richard III and his wife\n\nare helping to run his father's various enterprises, including a\n\nnewly created charter bus service called Williams & Williams.\n\nThe son is calling about someone trying to drop off a car at the\n\nWilliamses' family compound. The father first commands his son\n\nto donate the car to Goodwill and then changes his mind. \"Go\n\nback to the office and do whatever you were doing,\" he says.\n\n\"Have a good morning and thank you very much my son I love you\n\nvery much good morning.\"\n\nRichard puts down the phone. He says that pro tennis is\n\ndetrimental to all families but that his is too strong to be\n\ndamaged by it. He says that Jim Pierce, the infamous father of\n\nNo. 8-ranked Mary Pierce, \"is one of the best parents I have\n\never known.\" He says you shouldn't ever blame race for your\n\ntroubles. He says that he's finished coaching his daughters: \"If\n\nVenus and Serena don't have enough sense to go out there and\n\nteach themselves, that's their problem. I've done my job.\"\n\nIt's 8:50 a.m. A half-hour conversation with Richard Williams is\n\na fun house ride of contradiction, twisted logic, mangled\n\nlanguage and startling pronouncements delivered with an air more\n\nsuited to someone ordering breakfast. His verbal gyrations have\n\nbecome part and parcel of his daughters' rise over the last\n\ndecade, the disconcerting kick on an already overpowering serve.\n\n\"I hope you win,\" he said to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, then No. 2\n\nin the world, before she played Venus in the latter's debut\n\ntournament in 1994.\n\n\"A big tall white turkey,\" he called Spirlea after her collision\n\nwith Venus at the 1997 U.S. Open.\n\n\"I think Serena would kick her butt going and coming,\" Richard\n\nsaid of Hingis last August, before Hingis crushed Serena 6-4, 6-1\n\nin the Acura Classic in Manhattan Beach, Calif. \"Sometimes he\n\nshould watch his mouth,\" Hingis said after the match.\n\nHe hit bizarre new heights at the 1999 Lipton, when Venus and\n\nSerena became the first sisters to meet in a pro-level\n\ntournament final in 115 years. Before, while and after his\n\ndaughters engaged in a curiously flat match—which Venus won 6-1, 4-6, 6-4—Richard put on a one-man sideshow, holding up\n\nhandprinted signs (I TOLD YOU SO!) in the stands and holding two\n\nspectacularly jarring press conferences, one before and one\n\nafter the match, in which he declared: 1) Steffi Graf was his\n\nfavorite player; 2) he wasn't capitalizing as much as he could\n\non his daughters' success because he does so much work for \"the\n\nChinese peoples and the Japanese peoples\"; and 3) \"As a matter\n\nof fact, we thinking now about buying Rockefeller Center for\n\n$3,900,000,000, so I don't have time to even think about tennis\n\nno more.\"\n\nBefore the Lipton final Richard claimed that he creates three\n\nbusinesses a year that he expects to be worth $10 million to $15\n\nmillion each, though the specific names of these companies,\n\napart from the Williams & Williams charter bus service, remain a\n\nmystery. He spoke of plans to publish comic books and said that\n\nas a singer he could become good enough to \"push\" Michael\n\nJackson. After the match he said he had left the stands at one\n\npoint because he felt like crying, only to end up arguing with a\n\nvendor because he had only $1.50 to spend on a $3 pretzel. His\n\nhands shook as he spoke. \"I actually feel like a fool,\" he said.\n\nFor a man described by his defenders as a loving father and\n\nshrewd dealmaker and by his critics as controlling and\n\nmanipulative, this was the weirdest incarnation yet: Richard\n\nWilliams out of touch, benign and bumbling.\n\nBut those who know Richard best don't buy it. \"Rockefeller\n\nCenter? I've heard a million things crazier than that,\" says\n\nRick Macci, who coached Venus and Serena from September 1991 to\n\nJuly '95 at his Delray Beach, Fla., tennis academy. \"He did an\n\ninterview when Venus first moved to the academy and told the\n\ninterviewer someone offered him $78 million for the rights to\n\nthe kids.\" Richard would call and say that the girls wouldn't be\n\naround some weekend because 'we're going to the White House.' I\n\ndidn't know if he meant the white house down the road or the\n\nreal White House. When I'd tell him he throws a better curve\n\nthan Greg Maddux, he'd just say, 'I've got to keep everybody off\n\nbalance.'\"\n\n\"There's a method to his madness,\" says Keven Davis, the\n\nfamily's agent and legal adviser for the last 11 years.\n\n\"Everything he says is very well thought out and intends a\n\ncertain result. Ninety-nine times out of 100, he gets that\n\nresult. Don't ever underestimate Richard.\"\n\nDon't ever take what he says completely at face value, either.\n\nAt the Lipton, Richard said that his daughter Isha, 25, \"is\n\ngetting ready to graduate from law school,\" and \"she's already\n\ntaking classes to become a surgeon.\" Isha, who was enrolled at\n\nHoward as a senior last semester, says that she will enter\n\nGeorgetown Law next fall and that she's thinking about going on\n\nto medical school afterward.\n\nAt the Lipton, Richard also spoke of a psychiatrist named\n\nMichael J. Goldstein, who had advised Venus and Serena to limit\n\nthe number of tournaments they both would play in. But more\n\nrecently Richard, who receives a salary for coaching and\n\nmanaging his daughters and also claims to make a living lending\n\nmoney, buying and selling property, and developing businesses,\n\nsaid, \"Dr. Michael J. Goldstein, Rubenstein and Weinstein are in\n\ncharge of collecting [raising] money from the Jews for me.\"\n\nIn 1991 Richard told SI that his Compton security firm, Samson\n\nSecurity, employed six people. Today he says that Samson, which\n\nclosed in '92, had 55 employees at its peak.\n\nNone of these inconsistencies bother Richard. \"The key to success is looking at something you want and dreaming it's yours,\" he says. \"People used to look at me and say, 'That man can lie.' My wife used to say to me, 'What's your problem? Why do you lie so much?' Because when people would see me, I'd say, 'I'm a millionaire.' They'd say, 'Man, you live in that raggedy old house.' I'd say, 'So what? Didn't you know millionaires live in raggedy houses? You ever been in Beverly Hills? I own every house and every car down there.' Today I do own a home in Beverly Hills, I own a home in Brentwood.\"\n\nSuch flakiness, of course, doesn't put Richard in the first rank\n\nof obliviously overbearing tennis parents such as Pierce,\n\nStefano Capriati and Marinko Lucic. When it comes to the\n\ndevelopment of Venus and Serena as players and people, in fact,\n\nRichard has been unerring. In 1991, against the advice of tennis\n\nexperts, Richard, who had learned to play in part by watching\n\ninstructional videos, pulled both daughters off the Southern\n\nCalifornia junior tennis circuit. He moved the family to Florida\n\nand enrolled Venus and Serena in Macci's academy, and, while he\n\ndeftly worked a homemade hype machine, he and Oracene demanded\n\nthat the girls expend as much energy on education as they did on\n\npractice. \"Richard and I had ups and downs over a lot of\n\nthings,\" says Macci, who had a long-running dispute with\n\nWilliams over unpaid coaching fees until they reached a\n\nsettlement in December 1997, \"but he's always been an incredible\n\nfather to those two girls. If he'd wanted more money, he\n\ncould've had them playing more. But I can remember 50 times when\n\nhe called off practice because Venus's grades were down. They'd\n\nbe in my office studying French, and I'd be saying, 'Hey, we've\n\ngot to work.'\"\n\nThe result: Besides reaching the Top 10 in tennis, Venus and\n\nSerena maintained 3.0-plus averages at The Driftwood Academy, an\n\naccredited 30-student private high school in Lake Park, Fla.\n\nAccording to Driftwood founder and administrator Sandra\n\nMacManus, Venus graduated in January 1998 and Serena the\n\nfollowing August. Both are now mulling over going to college and\n\nseize every opportunity to show off their knowledge. They write\n\nand edit a newsletter called The Tennis Monthly Recap, which\n\nthey distribute in the players' lounge during tournaments and\n\nalso offer to subscribers. Venus studies French and German and\n\nwants to learn Italian. She raves about her \"ramified\"\n\ninterests, writes poetry and wants to work in fashion design.\n\nSerena has learned some Russian from her mixed doubles partner,\n\nMax Mirnyi, and after winning her first tournament, in Paris in\n\nFebruary, she gave a short acceptance speech in French. Then she\n\nfielded a few questions in French in the postmatch press\n\nconference. The point isn't that the Williams sisters are\n\nintellectuals but that they're fearless to the point of\n\narrogance. During her U.S. Open debut last year, Serena tussled\n\nwith a roomful of journalists over the origin of the word\n\nghetto. Confronted by the fact that her explanation was off by a\n\ncouple of hundred years, Serena said, \"You have your\n\ninformation, and I have mine.\" If they don't like a particular\n\nquestion, they'll glare at the questioner until the topic dies.\n\n\"My kids were brought up working,\" Richard says. \"Every kid in\n\nthe house was working at two years old; Venus and Serena were\n\ndelivering phone books. I taught my kids to be very, very\n\nindependent. My wife would get upset about it, but I didn't care\n\nwho got upset. One day that kid would have to be on her own.\"\n\nRichard grew up in the Cedar Grove section of Shreveport, La.,\n\nthe oldest son of Julia Mae Williams, a single mother of five\n\nwho picked cotton, whipped him when he was disobedient, harped\n\non his potential for greatness and insisted that he solve\n\nproblems on his own. He says he saw no reason to raise his\n\ndaughters any differently.\n\nHe nudges the Mercedes onto an exit ramp, realizes he's early\n\nfor his meeting and begins cruising slowly down a shabby stretch\n\nof Orange Avenue. He pulls into a car wash and steps out in his\n\nbare feet, walking for a while on the asphalt with a cell phone\n\nto his ear. An attendant cranks up the pressure hose and begins\n\nspraying water and soap over the mammoth likenesses of Venus and\n\nSerena stuck on the sides of the SUV. After a few moments\n\nRichard tugs on a pair of Reeboks. Then he leans into the\n\nMercedes and begins fiddling with the dials on the stereo. He\n\nturns the volume up and smiles. The interior of the vehicle\n\nfills with sound: a manic organ, a crew of backup vocalists, a\n\nman reciting. It's Richard.\n\nBeing misunderstood never bothered me none. I grew up my whole\n\nlife that way. So to what people think and say about me and my\n\nwife and my daughters, my methods, my views and my statements:\n\nIt really don't bother me none. (Bother me none!) ...\n\nPeople often ask me (How did I think!) how did I think that I\n\ncould be (Think that I could be!) the mental force behind two\n\nwinning female tennis stars? Even though I had no real exposure\n\nto the game? The answer to that: I didn't think I could do\n\nanything. I could help my daughters. I didn't think I could help\n\nthem. I didn't think I could make them something special: I knew\n\nI could make them. I knew I could help my daughters be\n\nsuccessful. (I knew.) ...\n\nNow, I see some of you shaking your heads (Shaking your heads!),\n\ngetting ready to call me ignorant son of a you-know-what. (Son of\n\na what?) And I might say I do sound cocky. But I say it because\n\nif you believe in yourself, it can happen. (It can happen!)\n\nRichard Williams. (Richard Williams!) Richard Williams.\n\nThe organ fades. When asked the name of his keyboard player,\n\nRichard jabs a thumb into his chest. \"I bought it at Circuit\n\nCity,\" he says.\n\nThe next morning Richard is on the family clay court, brushing\n\nthe white lines, picking up loose balls like any tennis coach.\n\nHe's less talkative today, seems smaller, as if dwarfed by the\n\nexpanse of his own success. With a front lawn broad enough to\n\naccommodate a circus, the Williams place sits in a clearing on\n\n21 acres of leafy isolation. The house is roomy, white and\n\nsimple. A big, half-empty pond stretches across the lawn. Serena\n\nwalks toward the court slowly, past placards reading SERENA YOU\n\nMUST LEARN TO LISTEN and VENUS WHEN YOU FAIL YOU FAIL ALONE and\n\nSERENA YOU MUST USE MORE TOPSPIN ON BALL. She warms up her\n\nserving motion by hurling into the air broken rackets taken one\n\nby one from a massive pile by the side of the court.\n\nRichard sets an orange cone in the deuce service court. For a\n\ncouple of minutes Serena serves ball after ball, but none touch\n\nthe cone. Richard approaches Serena and stands silently no more\n\nthan four feet from her. He folds his hands. Serena tosses,\n\nstretches and serves the ball, her racket whistling past\n\nRichard's face. He doesn't flinch. The ball hits the cone. She\n\nhits another. The ball hits the cone. \"Five more,\" he says.\n\nSerena finishes, walks over to the table and chairs at courtside\n\nand files her nails. After two minutes she walks back on the\n\ncourt, throws a few balls over the net, serves a few lefthanded,\n\nrallies for 10 minutes with Richard. He slaps most of his shots\n\nwide, some into the net, a few on target. \"Keep your old ass\n\ndown,\" he mumbles to himself. \"You're not looking at it.\" Serena\n\nhammers a few lax forehands, and Richard abruptly stops,\n\napproaches the net and says, chuckling, \"Come here.\" Serena\n\ntrudges up, and Richard hugs her, and they kiss lightly on the\n\nlips. \"I love you,\" he says, and just like that, the session ends.\n\nOracene says that Richard and Serena are very much alike, both\n\nmore outgoing and verbal than Venus. For years Richard has\n\nproclaimed that Serena will be the better player of the two, and\n\npeople may soon have to admit he was right about that, too. No\n\none has ever risen as fast through the WTA ranks--from 453 to\n\nthe Top 20--than Serena did in her first eight months on tour,\n\nbeginning in October 1997, and she hasn't slackened the pace.\n\nAfter she won a season-best 16 straight matches this year,\n\nbeating Grand Slam queens Graf, Hingis, Monica Seles and Lindsay\n\nDavenport in the process, everyone from Mary Pierce to Anna\n\nKournikova to Venus agreed that of the two sisters, Serena plays\n\nwith greater variety and ease. \"I think Serena has more clean\n\nshots than her sister,\" says Spirlea. \"She hits the ball harder.\n\nShe can mix it easier than Venus. She can be Number 1.\"\n\nPlus Serena benefits from the motivation of both love and\n\nrevenge. Venus can take or leave tennis anytime, Oracene says,\n\nbut Serena adores the game and \"she's meaner. Venus is more\n\ncontrolled. Serena can be very calculating if you do anything to\n\nher. She won't forget it. She'll pop you.\" Serena learned early:\n\nSomebody always pays. Once, when she was much younger and\n\ndriving in the car with her father, Richard was lecturing her on\n\nthe virtues of admitting when you commit a wrong. So Serena\n\nconfessed, \"Remember, Daddy, when you lost your dentures last\n\nweek? I threw them away.\" Richard says he drove to the next\n\nstoplight, \"got out and whipped her ass.\"\n\nAsked what she likes best about the game, Serena doesn't\n\nhesitate: \"Winning. I like going out and beating up on people. I\n\nget joy out of that. I really do.\"\n\nSerena says she is \"destined\" to be a champion. During that\n\n12-hour negotiating session between Milchan and Richard, Serena\n\nput her head down on the desk and fell asleep. But when Milchan\n\nasked Richard how he could be so sure of her greatness, Serena\n\nbolted upright and snapped, \"Do you have any doubt I'll be in\n\nthe top five?\"\n\nVenus is the only opponent she hasn't solved. Serena hasn't\n\nbeaten her in three matches on the tour, and their relatives as\n\nwell as other players agree that Serena is still intimidated by\n\nthe family pecking order. She also says that whenever she\n\nenvisions winning a Grand Slam title, the only opponent she can\n\nconjure up is Venus. Serena also says she's happy that, for the\n\nmost part, they aren't playing the same tournaments. \"I've never\n\nlost to anyone three times in a row, not even the Number 1\n\nplayer in the world,\" Serena says, sounding dumbfounded. \"I have\n\nto realize I can win.\"\n\nIt has been 20 minutes already, and still only one man in the\n\nroom knows why he's here. The other nine people gathered around\n\nthe table--teachers and administrators at Fort Pierce's Garden\n\nCity Technology Elementary Magnet School and local community\n\nleaders--have been staring politely at Richard Williams as he\n\nhas rambled from subject to subject, from his new bus company to\n\nJewish-owned TV stations to computers to the educational and\n\nanticrime programs he has supported with time and money in\n\nHaines City, Fla., and Pahokee, Fla., from the values of \"white\n\npeoples\" to the making of TV commercials to Venus's and Serena's\n\nfuture careers in modeling. His hosts were expecting something\n\ndifferent--a chance for the school's students to meet Serena and\n\na commitment from Richard to finance an outreach program for\n\nkids in Fort Pierce--and when Richard says something about the\n\nimportance of making a plan, the principal of Garden City\n\nElementary, Dr. Martha Rahming, grabs her opening.\n\n\"So...as far as Garden City is concerned--that's where my heart\n\nis--are we, ah, talking about developing a plan with you?\" she\n\nsays.\n\n\"My plan is so huge, I don't even know if I can do it,\" Richard\n\nsays. \"My plan would be to take a small church and make that\n\nchurch bigger than any church in the U.S. To do all that, you\n\nhave to have the involvement of a school and a lot of peoples\n\ninvolved. You have to have major media. I love to have the media\n\nbash me. You know why? You do something good and save someone's\n\nlife, no one cares. But all of us saw the news last week in\n\nColorado--and why, do you know? Because it was bad news. You\n\nwant to be famous? Get you some bad news.\"\n\nSomeone comes in to tell Richard his SUV is blocking the\n\ndriveway. When he leaves the room, a community representative\n\nsays, \"We've got to tone him down and get him to what he's going\n\nto do for this county.\"\n\nRahming blows out a mouthful of air. Another woman looks up from\n\nher handwritten notes and says, \"I'd like him to come to the\n\npoint.\"\n\nThey don't know: Richard Williams can't be rushed. When, in\n\n1994, the 14-year old Venus was a week away from making her\n\nlong-awaited debut in a pro tournament in Oakland, Macci urged\n\nRichard to allow him to crank up the intensity of her practices.\n\nRichard agreed but then called Macci the next day to announce\n\nthat he was taking the family for a weeklong trip to Disney World.\n\nMeanwhile Davis, Richard's legal adviser, urged him to sign a\n\nsneaker deal before the tournament, in case Venus's debut was a\n\ndisaster. \"But Richard said he wasn't going to do anything right\n\nthen,\" Davis says. \"I thought he was taking a serious gamble. He\n\nproved us all wrong.\" Venus won her first match and pushed\n\nSanchez Vicario to three sets in her second. As soon as the\n\ntournament ended, Richard began entertaining offers from shoe\n\ncompanies entranced by Venus's showing. Seven months later she\n\nsigned a five-year deal with Reebok worth a reported $12\n\nmillion, unheard-of numbers for a player with her limited\n\nexperience.\n\nThere are, Richard says, many prominent as well as obscure\n\ncharities in which he has taken an interest as his daughters'\n\nincome has increased. Over the past two years he has directed\n\nnearly $60,000 to a family developmental center in Pahokee\n\ncalled Concerned Youth for Community Improvement (CYCI). \"They\n\nkept us alive; they kept feeding us,\" says CYCI founder the\n\nReverend Patricia Wallace of the Williams family. Richard says\n\nhe and his daughters also help finance the Venus and Serena\n\nWilliams Tutorial/Tennis Academy in South Central Los Angeles\n\nand other educational programs in Winston-Salem, N.C., and West\n\nDallas, Texas. He adds that in the past week alone, Serena has\n\n\"donated\" $110,000 to his charity efforts, and Venus has\n\n\"donated\" $115,000. But pinning down Richard on the specifics is\n\nno easier for potential beneficiaries of his largesse than it is\n\nfor tennis officials, journalists and his own advisers.\n\n\"So,\" Rahming interrupts again, \"when are you going to know the\n\nplan? When are you going to know if it comes together?\"\n\nRichard hedges. \"I don't know if it's going to work,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't want to promise anything.... I'm so very busy.\"\n\nRecently Rahming talked to a woman in Richard's office and was\n\ntold that Richard would set up something for Fort Pierce by the\n\nend of the school year.\n\nDriving home, Richard stops for gas. The front page of The Palm\n\nBeach Post features a story on his new bus company, complete\n\nwith a color picture of him. Richard buys three copies. \"Most\n\npeople don't know nothing about me 'cause when I'm talking I\n\nalways talk like I'm stupid,\" he says. \"I prefer people to think\n\nI'm stupid.\"\n\nBig day for the Williams family. It's May 6, and Venus and\n\nSerena are in Rome for the Italian Open, playing in the same\n\ntournament for the first time since their Lipton final. Venus\n\nhas just trampled Kournikova 6-2, 6-2, reducing her opponent's\n\nusual haughtiness to meek confusion. \"She's all arms and legs,\"\n\nKournikova says. \"She was always a step faster than me.\"\n\n\"Serena!\" Venus shouts from 50 feet away. She's coming down the\n\nnarrow hallway under the Foro Italico, and Serena's eyes widen\n\nas she waits with her mother and sister Isha. Venus rushes up,\n\nkisses Oracene on the cheek, and she and Serena lean together\n\nand rush off, arms, hips, sides bumping in a giggly tangle. The\n\nsisters' tight bond has been depicted as twinlike and rudely\n\nexclusionary, and they make no apologies. \"We're the same\n\npeople,\" Serena says. \"We have two separate hearts,\" Venus says.\n\n\"At least I think so.\" When Venus traveled to Hamburg without\n\nSerena before the Italian Open, she fell quiet and calm. The\n\nmoment she arrived in Rome, though, \"I was just out of control,\"\n\nshe says. \"When we get together, I just get, I don't know, crazy.\"\n\nOracene trudges down the hallway, saying little and watching\n\nall. Because Richard is staying home all spring and summer,\n\nOracene, who also learned the game from Richard, is serving as\n\nthe sisters' coach, butting into their practice sessions against\n\na male hitting partner with a soft word, sitting through all the\n\nmatches. Oracene is the family's quiet authority. She balances\n\nRichard's bombast with her strong faith (Richard is the only\n\nnon-Jehovah's Witness in the Williams household) and clear-eyed\n\njudgment. After Richard complicated Venus's run at the 1997 U.S.\n\nOpen with his inflammatory comments about Spirlea, Oracene told\n\nhim he had been wrong to spout off. \"He didn't say anything, but\n\nhe hears me,\" Oracene says. Richard publicly apologized for his\n\nremarks.\n\nOracene never wanted to live in Compton. A graduate of Eastern\n\nMichigan with a degree in education, she had dreams of being an\n\nR&B singer. Then she started having children; thereafter, she\n\nsays, \"my life ended.\" She worked as a private-duty nurse and\n\nrefused to let the failure of so many others in Compton affect\n\nher daughters. \"I never had the ghetto frame of mind,\" Oracene\n\nsays. \"When I first moved there I hated it. Where I was raised,\n\nwe had trees and a house. It was nice. I was ashamed to say I\n\nlived in Compton. After a while I got used to it. But my mind\n\nwas never in Compton. If my daughters said they couldn't do\n\nanything, I'd say, 'Yes, you can. You can do anything you want.\n\nNothing is unattainable.'\"\n\nThey all believed her, then and now. The oldest daughter,\n\nYetunde, 26, works as an intensive-care nurse in Southern\n\nCalifornia. Isha says she plans to get an M.B.A. along with her\n\nlaw degree at Georgetown and then perhaps go on to medical\n\nschool. Lyndrea, 21, is majoring in computer science and\n\ninternational business at Howard. \"I was never comfortable,\"\n\nsays Isha. \"My family was never comfortable. We're not\n\ncomfortable now. We're always seeking ways to push ourselves.\"\n\nOf course, in tennis, positive thinking only takes you so far;\n\neventually everybody must lose. This is the concept Venus and\n\nSerena have found most difficult to swallow. Last year's\n\nWimbledon was a family debacle. After falling behind 7-5, 4-1 to\n\nVirginia Ruano-Pascual in a third-round match, Serena abruptly\n\npulled up lame with a calf injury and retired, neglecting to\n\nshake Ruano-Pascual's hand. She showed no sign of injury,\n\nhowever, in winning the Wimbledon mixed-doubles title with\n\nMirnyi. \"I read later that she was so hurt,\" says Davenport.\n\n\"She was getting her ass kicked. I thought she was a complete\n\nwimp about it. I played her [two days later] in mixed, and she\n\nwas jumping for lobs.\"\n\nThen Venus lost her composure after a series of line calls went\n\nagainst her in a quarterfinal match against eventual champion\n\nJana Novotna. Venus had been pressing Novotna to her limit, but\n\nafter a couple of adverse line calls she started to fall apart.\n\n\"Why is this happening?\" she cried. Venus cracked again at the\n\n1999 Australian Open. In a quarterfinal match against Davenport,\n\nshe was assessed an unprecedented--but legitimate--point penalty\n\nafter some beads fell from her hair and bounded about the court.\n\n\"This has never happened to me before,\" Venus told chair umpire\n\nDenis Overberg. She didn't win another game in the match.\n\n\"There's no question Venus is going to be a great player,\"\n\nDavenport says, but it's also clear that she and Serena have yet\n\nto demonstrate poise under pressure on the sport's grandest\n\nstages. Oracene refuses, however, even to consider the matter.\n\n\"There's no such thing as pressure,\" she says. \"As black\n\nAmericans, that's all we've ever had. It's life. So where's the\n\npressure?\"\n\nShe's sitting in an overstuffed chair in the lobby of a posh\n\nhotel overlooking Rome. The issue of race, of course, would be a\n\nsubtext for the Williamses even if no one ever spoke of it. No\n\nimportant black tennis player--not Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe,\n\nZina Garrison or Mal Washington--ever carried himself or herself\n\nwith the casual sense of entitlement that envelops Venus and\n\nSerena. \"Most of all, we do our own thing,\" Venus says. \"We do\n\nwhat we want. We're very different from everyone else, because\n\nwe think differently.\"\n\nOracene keeps track. She notices whenever people take her\n\ndaughters to task for cockiness. \"It's like, Squish them down,\n\nthey can't have that confidence!\" Oracene says. \"I teach my kids\n\nto live in reality: You're black, you always have to work\n\nharder--but you don't have to prove yourself to anybody. I don't\n\nexpect you to, and I don't expect you to apologize. Ever.\"\n\nAbruptly Oracene breaks into a wide smile. Her face shines in\n\nthe soft lobby light. \"It's like the Bible says: If someone is\n\ntalking bad about you, be happy,\" she says. \"I schooled the\n\ngirls on the nigger issue. I said, You might get called that,\n\nand if you do, just say, 'Thank you!' I love it. You know, I am\n\nso sick of people saying the n word. Forget it. 'It's what you\n\nare! Say it! Go on!' Eventually when they see it doesn't bother\n\nyou, they'll leave it alone. I can't wait for someone to say it.\n\nI've been planning on it.\"\n\nHere's what it's like to be 18 years old and delighted with\n\nbeing alive. Venus pulls up in a shiny new Porsche coupe and\n\nsits down smiling at a sheltered picnic table in a park near the\n\nWilliamses' house. It's just two days since her dominating win\n\nover Pierce in the Italian Open final--her second tour victory\n\non clay in two weeks--and she's feeling quite sure that her time\n\nhas come. \"I'm trying to think of whom I should lose to and\n\nwhy,\" Venus says, \"and I can't think of any reasons why I should.\"\n\nShe giggles some more, and it comes across as neither cocky nor\n\noverbearing. She's happy with her game. She's happy with being\n\n6'2\". \"I like everything that I am,\" she says. \"My mom always\n\nsays, 'Can't you find something you don't like about yourself?'\n\nActually, I can't. That's just the way I've always been.\"\n\nGray clouds hang overhead, thunder booms. Venus ignores it.\n\nScreen tests, money, winning, family: It's a beautiful day. The\n\nphilosophy is simple, she says. You want it? Get it. \"I like\n\nbeing the best,\" she says. \"This year I have the most titles of\n\nany player on the women's tour. [After Hingis won in Berlin two\n\nweeks ago, she and Venus were tied with four titles.] I feel\n\ngood about that. I'm going to try and make sure it stays that\n\nway. I like moving toward goals: Right now I'm Number 5. Soon\n\nI'll be Number 4, and that's great. One day I'll win the French\n\nOpen, and that'll be great. Then I'll have to move on and win\n\nWimbledon.\"\n\nShe's talking of moving out of her parents' house, of building\n\none nearby with Serena and settling in. She laughs some more and\n\nstands up, walks out where it will soon be pouring. \"Hello,\n\nbeautiful girl,\" Richard says. They hug, Richard asks her a\n\nquestion, and they hug again.\n\n\"See you later, now,\" Richard says.\n\n\"I love you, Daddy\"\n\n\"I love you, Venus. Thank you.\"\n\nVenus climbs into her Porsche, backs up and turns, grinding the\n\ngears a bit. The engine starts to whine. Richard stands\n\nstock-still in the parking lot, his face grizzled by a beard\n\ngoing white. He watches as she pulls away. The road stretches\n\nout before her like an open hand. He looks like the embodiment\n\nof parental pride.\n\nWhen he finally turns and breaks the silence, Richard says, \"She\n\ndoes love to drive it, but she doesn't have time. I'll get it\n\nanyway. She'll buy another one, and she'll give the old one to\n\nme. It'll be my car very soon.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BOB MARTIN Call Richard Williams what you want, but be sure of one thing: He has brilliantly guided the careers of his daughters Venus (left) and Serena, the hottest players in tennis [T of C]\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY BOB MARTIN\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: KWAKU ALSTON Master of his domain Richard's 21-acre spread in Palm Beach Gardens features this unprepossessing house and three tennis courts.\n\nTWO COLOR PHOTOS: CARYN LEVY (2) Hot, hot time This year Venus (above) and Serena have won six tournaments between them.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: CARYN LEVY Happy times Oracene doesn't believe Serena (left) or Venus has been under pressure.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BILL FRAKES No sibling rivalry The occasional doubles partners are so tight that Venus (right) says, \"We have two separate hearts--at least I think so.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BOB MARTIN Designing women Venus and sister Isha shop during downtime at the Italian Open.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PETER READ MILLER Early start Richard (here teaching 10-year-old Venus in Compton) correctly predicted greatness for his daughters.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: KWAKU ALSTON Picture of contentment Williams has a poster of Venus and Serena stuck to both rear quarters of his Mercedes SUV.\n\n\"EITHER HE'S TOTALLY CRAZY,\" THE HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER SAID OF\n\nRICHARD, \"OR HE KNOWS SOMETHING I DON'T\"\n\nTHE SISTER ACT IS THREATENING TO OVERWHELM THE SPORT WITH\n\nPOWER, ATHLETICISM AND IN-YOUR-FACE ATTITUDE\n\nSAYS ORACENE, \"IF MY DAUGHTERS SAID THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING,\n\nI'D SAY, 'YES, YOU CAN.
