        "text": "Venus Ebony Starr Williams Price was born in Lynwood, California, and is one year older than her sister Serena Jameka Williams Price who was born in Saginaw, Michigan; both reached the top of the WTA and this achievement has been well rewarded in the field of finances.\n\nAfter surpassing four decades of existence, the fortunes they have amassed also put them in competition in the eyes of the world.\n\nWith luck on their side\n\nDespite being the older sister, Venus has managed to generate less money than Serena and her net worth is around 95 million dollars, of which 42 million dollars have come from her career in professional tennis.\n\nThe rest of her net worth is the result of her sponsorship proceeds from the brands that approached her at the time, but an additional merit is her determination to start several businesses that made her the owner of a sportswear line, \"EleVen\", and a diet company, \"Happy Vikings\". In addition, she also runs the interior design company \"V Starr\".\n\n\"I knew it was my destiny to be in the winner's circle. There were times when I didn't make it. But I felt my destiny was definitely to win big titles, to win a lot of titles,\" Venus stated some time ago.\n\nRivals on and off the court\n\nIn the sporting arena, the Williams sisters have faced each other on 30 occasions, with Serena having the edge with 18 victories to Venus' 12. In addition, they have coincided in nine Grand Slam finals, with a favorable balance for the younger sister of seven wins against two defeats.\n\nThis pair of sisters have also played five consecutive Grand Slam finals and in all games the victory was on Serena's side."
