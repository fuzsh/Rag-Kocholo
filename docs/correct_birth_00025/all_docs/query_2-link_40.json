        "text": "Singles Career\n\nSerena Williams’s professional debut came in 1995. Two years later, in only her fifth professional tournament, she upended Mary Pierce, ranked seventh, and Monica Seles, ranked fourth, to reach the semifinals at the Ameritech Cup in Chicago. At number 304, she was the lowest-ranked player ever to have beaten two top-10 players in the same tournament. After the competition, her world singles ranking soared to 102.\n\nExpectations for Williams began to grow quickly. Her father made bold statements to the media about his talented daughters, who both signed multimillion-dollar endorsement deals. Less than a year later, in June 1998, Williams reached the top 20. In April 1999—after having defeated Amelie Mauresmo to win the Paris Indoor Open, Steffi Graf to win the Indian Wells masters tournament, and Martina Hingis in the semifinals at the Lipton Championship—Williams broke the top 10 at number nine. The 17-year-old champion reached the top five at number four after winning the U.S. Open later that year. As the tournament’s seventh seed, Williams was the lowest-seeded woman to win the U.S. Open title since the beginning of the open era in 1968. She was the second African American woman to win a Grand Slam event, after Althea Gibson’s victories in 1957–58.\n\nWilliams captured three more Grand Slam titles in 2002, winning the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open and defeating her sister in the finals of each tournament. Although Serena Williams had finished the 2000 and 2001 seasons ranked sixth, after her French Open victory in 2002 she climbed to number two, behind only Venus Williams. The Williams sisters were the first siblings ever to occupy the top two spots in the world rankings at the same time. On July 8, 2002, after winning the Wimbledon title, Serena Williams overtook her sister in the rankings for the top spot. In 2003 Serena Williams won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, again besting her sister in the finals. She won the Australian Open six more times (2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017) and captured the U.S. Open title for the third time in 2008.\n\nIn 2009 Serena Williams earned her third Wimbledon singles title, once again defeating her sister, and successfully defended the title in 2010. She subsequently battled various health issues that kept her off the court for almost a year. In 2012 she won her fifth Wimbledon singles title and fourth U.S. Open title. In 2013 she won her second French Open singles championship and fifth U.S. Open title. She successfully defended her U.S. Open championship in 2014. That title gave her 18 career Grand Slam championships, tying her with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for the second highest women’s singles total of the open era.\n\nIn addition to winning the Australian Open in 2015, Williams won her third French Open and sixth Wimbledon title that year. She again won Wimbledon in 2016 to increase her number of career Grand Slam singles titles to 22, which tied her with Graf for the most Slams in the open era for both women and men. In 2017 Williams earned her record 23rd Grand Slam singles title with a victory over her sister in the finals of the Australian Open. In April of that year Serena Williams announced that she was pregnant (she had gotten engaged to Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of the website Reddit, in 2016) and would miss the remainder of the 2017 season. In September she gave birth to a daughter, and two months later she married Ohanian. Williams reached the finals of Wimbledon in July 2018 but lost the match. She also lost in the U.S. Open finals that year. In 2019 she was again defeated in the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open."
