On September 26, 1981 tennis champion Serena Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan. Her parents, Richard and Oracene, later relocated to Los Angeles, and Serena and her four sisters (Lyndrea, Isha, Yetunde, and Venus) grew up in Compton, a L.A. suburb. At young ages, both Serena and Venus became excellent tennis players and began to compete. With the passage of time, both sisters have made a name for themselves as professional athletes.
