        "text": "Crosslinker Hydrolysis and Particle Degradation\n\nTo characterize the rate of crosslinker hydrolysis in the carrier particles, samples of 35 nm particles were suspended in deuterated phosphate buffers at pH 7.4 and pH 5 and 1H NMR spectra were acquired after various times. illustrates the general behavior of the particles upon exposure to acidic conditions. The resonance attributed to the benzylidene acetal proton of the crosslinker within the particles appears as a broad peak at 5.6 ppm. As the incubation time increases, the intensity of this peak diminishes along with the concomitant appearance of a sharp peak at 9.8 ppm corresponding to the proton of the benzaldehyde liberated during hydrolysis. The growth rate of the latter peak can be modeled using pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the crosslinker concentration (29) to yield a half-life of particle crosslink hydrolysis of 40 h at pH 7.4, compared to 10 min at pH 5 ( ). These values are roughly equivalent to hydrolysis rates reported for a similar crosslinker in monomeric form (30). Within 1 h, hydrolysis was essentially complete at pH 5, while at pH 7.4, hydrolysis progressed slowly over the course of 10 days (data not shown).\n\nA complementary view of particle stability as a function of pH was obtained using measurements of light scattering intensity for suspensions of the particles ( ). The time required for the particles to fragment into linear polyacrylamide chains following crosslinker hydrolysis at pH 5 was approximately 3 h, as determined by a 90% decrease in scattering intensity. On the other hand, over the course of 8 h, no observable decrease in scattering intensity occurred at pH 7.4, and it took over 9 days for the scattering intensity to decrease 90% from its original value (data not shown). We confirmed that the decrease in scattering intensity observed in the protein-loaded particles at acidic pH was dependent on the presence of acid-labile crosslinks, as the scattering intensity of particles crosslinked with N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide showed no change in intensity at pH 5 over the same length of time (data not shown). Together, the NMR and light scattering data suggest that while the particle crosslinks hydrolyze relatively rapidly, overall particle degradation appears to be limited by disentanglement of the linear polymers that are formed as the result of crosslinker hydrolysis.\n\nEffect of Particle Size on T-cell Proliferation and Generation of Antigen-specific Effector T-cells\n\nTo assess the effect of particle size on the activation of T-cells in vivo, we prepared larger analogous acid-labile hydrogel particles by an inverse suspension polymerization method (14-17). Particles synthesized in this manner had a mean diameter of 3.67 ± 1.18 μm when suspended in PBS and are referred to as 3.5 μm particles in this report. These particles incorporated approximately the same mole percent of crosslinker (10%) and ovalbumin (7.3 ± 0.2 %), and were produced in ca. 40% yield. The 3.5 μm particles were comparable to the 35 nm particles in terms of their morphology as seen by SEM (Figure S1), their degradation characteristics, and their in vitro cytotoxicity (14). Additional experiments performed using particles containing fluorescently-labeled ovalbumin showed similar in vitro uptake of both sizes of particles in RAW 309 macrophages as confirmed by flow cytometry (Figure S2). Using confocal microscopy, we found that the intracellular appearance and distribution of both types of particles in macrophages were also similar (Figure S3). We therefore expected that differences in T-cell activation induced by these two types of particles would primarily be due to the effect of particle size.\n\nThe purpose of encapsulating ovalbumin within the particles was to exploit existing in vivo experimental models that rely on the presentation of the dominant, ovalbumin-derived, SIINFEKL epitope (OVA257-264) in the context of MHC I molecules (H-2Kb) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The first experiment we used to assess the activation of T-cells by the two sizes of particles examined the ability of each type of particle to induce T-cell proliferation. We have previously shown that ovalbumin-loaded pH-sensitive particles are capable of stimulating the proliferation of T-cells in vivo, even at relatively low ovalbumin concentrations (16). In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were injected with either 3.5 μm or 35 nm particles in quantities normalized to deliver 5 μg of ovalbumin. After 24 h, CFSE-labeled naïve OT-I T-cells, capable of specifically recognizing SIINFEKL/MHC I complexes, were adoptively transferred to each mouse. Three days later, draining lymph nodes were assessed for the fraction of OT-I cells that had undergone division in the interim as seen by a dilution of the CFSE signal present in the initially labeled OT-I cells. shows that both the 3.5 μm and the 35 nm particles were capable of stimulating OT-I cell proliferation with 57% and 68% of T-cells undergoing division, respectively, compared to mice injected with free ovalbumin, where only 41% of T-cells were found to be dividing. The level of T-cell division stimulated by 35 nm particles was greater than ovalbumin (p < 0.018), while 3.5 μm particles were not found to be more stimulatory than ovalbumin alone (p < 0.12). In addition, while the 35 nm particles appeared to be slightly more stimulatory than the 3.5 μm particles, the difference was not found to be statistically significant.\n\nThe proliferation of T-cells stimulated by these acid-labile carriers, however, only provides a general perspective on the activation capacity of this particle system. More importantly, we wanted to determine if antigen-specific effector T-cells were being generated in vivo, as this would indicate whether or not the particle formulations would be capable of stimulating an effective CTL response necessary for vaccine-related applications. For this experiment, C57BL/6 mice were injected with either 3.5 μm or 35 nm particles in quantities normalized to deliver 50 μg of ovalbumin. After 7 days, a population of cells consisting of equal amounts of C57BL/6 mouse splenocytes either pulsed or not pulsed with SIINFEKL were injected into the mice. Prior to injection, the two cell types were labeled with either high (SIINFEKL-pulsed) or low (non-SIINFEKL-pulsed) concentrations of CFSE to enable tracking of each set of cells. After 18 h, the quantities of circulating CFSE-labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry ( ). A decrease in the fraction of SIINFEKL-pulsed cells relative to the fraction of non-pulsed cells was taken to indicate the presence of antigen-specific effector T-cell cytotoxicity. Without co-administration of additional immunostimulatory compounds, mice injected with 3.5 μm particles alone were found to generate a greater cytotoxic response (46% specific target cell lysis) than ovalbumin alone (22% specific target cell lysis). On the other hand, the 35 nm particles alone did not seem to generate a significant cytotoxic response, with specific cell lysis roughly equivalent to both ovalbumin and PBS controls. It may be possible that the decreased response generated by the 35 nm particles relative to the 3.5 μm particles may be associated with a dilution of the injected dose that could occur if the 35 nm particles are indeed small enough to be convectively transported through the lymphatic capillaries draining the injection site. In contrast, due to their larger size, the 3.5 μm particles likely reside at relatively high concentration at the injection site. Elucidating the actual reason for the disparity between the cytotoxicity stimulated by the 3.5 μm and 35 nm particles requires additional study.\n\nWe have previously demonstrated that incorporating short, single-stranded oligonucleotide sequences containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides into the structure of our polyacrylamide-based hydrogel system greatly enhances the activation of antigen-presenting cells and improves the overall immune response (16). In addition, it was demonstrated that a similar effect could be observed if the CpG-containing oligonucleotide was simply co-administered along with ovalbumin-loaded particles. As a result, these types of particle formulations represent a more relevant context for antigen delivery than using particles that encapsulate antigen alone. Thus, we sought to investigate the impact of particle size on T-cell activation in formulations where particles were combined with immunostimulatory DNA. For ease of manipulating the experimental conditions in this experiment such that particle size was the only factor varied, this latter method of co-administering the CpG oligonucleotide was chosen, and additional mice were administered with 10 μg of CpG DNA along with the 50 μg ovalbumin-equivalent of particles. Under these conditions, we found that both 3.5 μm and 35 nm particles were significantly more effective at generating antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells compared to 3.5 μm particles administered without CpG (p < 0.0036 and p < 0.0002, respectively), with 76% and 87% specific target cell lysis, respectively ( ). The small difference in target cell lysis between these two treatments was not found to be statistically significant.\n\nOverall, the results of the in vivo tests of T-cell activation suggest that for our acid-labile polyacrylamide-based hydrogel carrier system, particle size does not appear to play a significant role in the generation of CTL responses. Both sizes of particles tested in this study demonstrated a high capacity for stimulating populations of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells. Why the behavior we observed differs from reports in the literature for hydrophobic carriers suggesting that smaller particles are more effective in this application requires additional study. In all of the experiments described in this study, we were unable to ascribe the immunostimulatory activity observed using either of the particle types to the presence of particle-associated endotoxin. It is possible that these differences in behavior to previously studied polystyrene and poly(propylene sulfide) systems may be related to the overall hydrophilicity of the carrier system or the site of immobilization of the protein antigen being delivered (i.e., encapsulated within the bulk of the carrier, or bound to the carrier surface), which may influence interactions of the particle system with phagosomal receptors in antigen-presenting cells. To this end, we plan to compare our polyacrylamide-based particle system side-by-side with polystyrene-based carriers to determine their relative stimulatory capacities."
