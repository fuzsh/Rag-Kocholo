        "text": "Highline Magazine\n\nHIGHLINE IS SOUL FOOD FOR MOUNTAIN PEOPLE\n\nI co-founded Highline Magazine in 2008 and was publisher and creative director from that time until it’s close in 2016.\n\nAmidst towering mountain peaks, snow-filled couloirs and fast-running rivers, Canada’s Rocky Mountain Parks inspire people to embrace life in wild spaces. And mountain towns have long been magnets for talented and creative individuals.\n\nHighline was a window into the wild culture that thrives in the Rockies. Its stories, images, and local events embodied the playful, community-minded, and earth-friendly spirit of the people who call the Rockies home. The Highline team provided a fun, friendly mountain culture experience for locals and visitors, building lasting relationships with our readers.\n\nHighline Magazine was a free, semi-annual print magazine distributed in local hotspots throughout the Rockies. The mag was known for its unconventional storytelling, knack for finding off-the-beaten-path perspectives on mountain issues, beautiful and intelligent design and photography, and our wild and well-loved local events.\n\nBelow you’ll find the highlights from Highline’s eight years in publishing and events, and a selection of some of the most-loved stories, photographs, and illustrations we published over the years, including a few of my own."
