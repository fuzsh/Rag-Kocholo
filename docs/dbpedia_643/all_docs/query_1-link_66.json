        "text": "To get through the desert in Breath of Fire 3, remeber these key points:\n\n1) Only walk at night, and camp during the day. This recovers your HP and MP and conserves water.\n\n2) When you get a message telling you to drink water, take about 15 steps, then drink ONCE.\n\n3) When coming out of a battle area, always check which way you are facing before starting to walk again.\n\nAlso, the last dragon gene can be used and controled by combining it with the Radience and Trance genes. However, I found it was not worth the MP cost.\n\nErich Mende\n\nWizard's First Rule: People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true. People's heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool.\n\nIt's been AGES since I've written to RPGamer's letters section...go figure. Anyway, I wanted to rant about the WonderSwan FF games Square is proudly showing off. Yeah, it's great that they're finally remaking FF games the right way (not just cheaply tacking on FMV like with FF Anthology). However, I think that their fascination with WonderSwan color is like a joke that's just not funny. WonderSwan color is supposedly able to display 241 simultaneous colors while GBA can display 65,536. Doesn't take a math whiz to figure out which is better.\n\nYeah, it's swell that FF1, 2, and 3 will be upgraded to FF4-ish capacity, but wouldn't it have been even more impressive to make them all above and beyond the 2D graphics found in FF6? Why wouldn't Square want to take advantage of GBA's power? Does Sony have Square on a tight leash and supposedly draws them away from the big handheld competition at Nintendo. I DON'T KNOW!!! All I know is that if Square doesn't develop for GBA, many other companies will...and those companies will be the ones on top in the handheld industry...not Square. But how long can they remake titles (FF1, 2, 3, Seiken 2) or make cheap offshoots (Working Chocobo) for a handheld only slightly more powerful than Neo Geo Pocket Color?\n\n-Steve\n\nChimerasame:\n\nYour name is Steeeve....\n\nAhem. Never mind that. As far as the points you bring up, they're valid, I think. However, they may not be particularly important. Look at the Playstation. Personally, I bought a PSX in order to play Final Fantasy VII, and I know I'm not alone in that. It's quite possible that the very fact that Square is making these games for the WonderSwan will help the system out quite a bit. Why they're not using the GBA, I don't know. Perhaps there's a limit to how much resources they want to devote to the remakes.. and coding something to take full advantage of the GBA would be more labor-intensive and not really worth it, compared with coding something to take full advantage of the WSC. That's just a theory, of course. As far as 'how long can they remake titles,' etc., I think Square can easily survive on the large amount of completely new games they make every year, and as long as they don't actually lose money on remakes, there's not much reason not to do them.\n\nChimerasame:\n\nI must admit I haven't played THAT many PC RPGs. There's Torment, and there are the Might And Magic games 3-6. Playing 4 and 5 together was really amazing somehow... if you install World of Xeen from the anthology, the world of those two merge and you can carry your party between the two games... and in spite of the fact that I was used to better graphics, sound, and story, it was one (two?) of the most entertaining games I've played.\n\nAs far as your question, my answer is Yes. Developers are springing up all over. Tons of people enjoy massive multiplayer RPGs not made by Japanese companies (or less-massive ones such as Diablo II, which you mentioned.) For a while at least, the major forces among console RPGs will remain located in Japan (Square, Enix, etc.), but as time passes, newer companies and developing teams (most of which will be based elsewhere) will surely gain popularity. I, for one, hope to make a wonderful game, though at my current rate of progress it won't be out for another fifty years. :)\n\nChimerasame:\n\nI've noticed that pattern before too, but it's not much to go by yet. Back before the PSX, I had a theory that Square wouldn't translate prime FF games. We got 1, then we didn't get 2 and 3. 4's not prime, so it came over, but 5 was, so it stayed. And we got 6. However, 7 broke the rule by being translated in spite of being prime, then they went back and translated 5, and now they might translate 2 and 3 as well. There goes that theory.\n\nI don't know if Square's going to jump to anything, though I wouldn't be surprised at all if they start doing multi-platform releases. I don't know how different the machine language is for the various systems, so I'm not sure how easy it is to release a game, say, for both the PS2 and the X-Box. But it couldn't be too difficult, and would almost surely bring in a substantial number of sales.\n\nChimerasame:\n\nI got a number of letters on this subject, and I'm sorry I can't print more of them. Since this is theoretically an RPG column, I figured it'd be best to limit this discussion to just one letter. I will offer some commentary about what some other people said, however.\n\nTo start with, the results on the number of balls various readers say they'll play with. One person would need 100,000 white balls. Someone says 10 would be necessary. Someone says only about four, considering him or herself lucky. Another person says they'd play with 1.5 white balls. (This could be accomplished in effect with 3 white and 2 black, incidentally.) Three people including the above letter's author say that one ball is appropriate; one of the others uses the same reasoning as used here--that if you picked the black ball, you wouldn't care that you lost--and the other says that economic principles estimate a human life at about $10 million anyway, so one white ball would be equal to one black one. One person requires zero white balls, but that's just because they were in a bad mood. Hopefully that mood improved, I'd hate to lose a reader over a nonexistant game.\n\nOne person wrote in and said that they'd never play, no matter how good the odds. My question to that is: What's the chance you're going to die today anyway? It might be very very small, but it exists. Is there the slightest possibility that someone has a grudge against you, went crazy, and laced your mouse with some sort of deadly poison? Sure, that's highly improbable, but not impossible to imagine. I believe this was one of the points of the lecture. We risk ourselves on a constant bases, even if the risk is very small. This game just makes that risk a bit more obvious. When you get in a car, you risk your life in exchange for the convienience of not having to walk. If you ever eat raw food, there's a slight risk that some sort of bacteria is living in it, but you accept the miniscule chance because you don't want to eat everything cooked. To quote the professor's response to a student, \"I will not play this game, comma, bull****.\" (I like this professor. ;>) No offense if that was your answer.. the idea wasn't necessarily to denounce you, just to make you think.\n\nIncidentally, I'm pretty sure I'd play with 99 white balls, and I might play with fewer, though I'm not sure. I might come into $10 million some other way, you never know. ;>"
