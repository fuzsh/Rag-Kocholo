        "text": "Man in the News\n\nBONN, Oct. 4—“Aging becomes him,” a Bonn journalist wrote this week about Rainer Barzel, who was endorsed tonight as chairman of West Germany's opposition Christian Democratic Union party.\n\nMr. Barzel became 47 in June and since then he has been cultivating a statesman's image as befits a politician seeking the chancellorship. Before that, one was likely to see him playing his previous role as flashy man‐about‐Bonn, sporting white or turquoise socks, driving a fast, silverpainted BMW‐2500 sedan, getting his sideburns curled properly at the high‐priced Wdrsdorfer barbershop.\n\nAssuming that all goes well with his candidacy, he will have less than 23 months to polish his statesmanship before facing the acknowledged statesman, Chancellor Willy Brandt, in the federal elections of 1973.\n\nThe Voice Is Familiar\n\nHis platform has been that of the Christian Democratic parliamentary faction, which he has headed as whip since 1963 with ever‐growing skill.\n\nHis voice is almost too smooth: It has a quality that many Germans, including his opposite number, Herbert Wehner, the Social Democratic whip, cannot bear. Mr. Wehner recently remarked: “I think Barzel changes his oil after every 2,000 words.”\n\nRainer Candidus Barzel (the last name is pronounced BART‐sell was born June 20, 1924, in Braunsberg, a largely Catholic town in the Ermland district of largely Protestant East Prussia. It is now the Polish Braniewo. He was the fifth of a high school teacher's seven children.\n\nThe Barzel family moved to Berlin in 1931 and young Rainer attended a Jesuit school until the Nazis closed it. His father, Candidus, enrolled in the party to continue teaching. The son shifted to a public school, but remained in a Catholic youth organization, instead of joining the Hitler Youth. He volunteered for military duty in 1941 and when the war ended he was a sea reconnaissance flier with the rank of lieutenant.\n\nCleared for Law Studies\n\nHe turned up in Cologne in 1945 and, assisted by an older former officer, Erich Mende, who also entertained political ambitions, got demilitarization clearance to study law at Cologne University. He married his war‐time sweetheart, Kriemild Schumacher, a Cologne druggist's daughter, in his last semester in 1948. Their daughter, Claudia, was born in 1949, the year Mr. Barzel earned his doctorate.\n\nMr. Barzel got his first job in the administration of the newly formed state of North Rhine‐Westphalia and almost immediately became the protege of Carl Spiecker, an elderly veteran of the prewar Catholic Center party. Mr. Spiecker was a left‐wing, labor ‐ oriented Catholic, and Mr. Barzel became one.\n\nMr. Barzel was elected to the Bundestag in 1957, from the strongly Catholic district of Paderborn.\n\nIn Bonn, Mr. Barzel found other mentors and allies, joining first with the right‐wing Bavarian, Franz Josef Strauss, and then with a middle‐of‐the‐roader, Heinrich Krone.\n\nIn 1959, he and Mr. Strauss founded a radical political committee called Rettet die Freiheit (Preserve Liberty). Its first move was to issue a “red book” denouncing 453 West German intellectuals and politicians as Communist sympathizers. But a number of Mr. Barzel's own party colleagues found themselves in the book and protested vigorously. Rettet die Freiheit collapsed after 15 months.\n\nBut Mr. Barzel bounced back with characteristic élan and, by the end of 1962, Mr. Krone put him forward for the Cabinet post of Minister of All‐German Affairs.\n\nBy 1963, Mr. Barzel was on the inside track in the Christian Democratic Union. It was only a matter of months until he was appointed Majority Whip."
