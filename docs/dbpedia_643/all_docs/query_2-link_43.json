Happy Birthday Google! #Google25 #TechMilestone #Innovation #DigitalTransformation\n\nToday marks the 25th birthday of Google! The journey started from garage in Menlo Park where Larry and Sergey first wrote down our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. And here we are today in the era of AI committed to solving some of the world's biggest challenges and to the original mission. September also marks my four year journey with Google. When I reflect back to my thoughts of my first bikeride at our Mountain View campus, I was blown away by strenght of our culture and our amazing people. Now I can only agree, our people, values and culture have been foundamental for us to become Google of today. Respect the user (or our clients), respect the opportunity and respect each other. And we have a healthy disregard for the impossible - we think 10x and keep challenging each other. Vital for us to keep improving. The values mashed up with passion and drive on clear vision builds unique culture where everyone can play at their best. We know we are all in charge of it personally, but at the same time together. I'm very excited about the future - the biggest technological shift that we will see in our lifetimes. HBD Google - Cheers to the future!🥳 #google #values #culture #mission\n\n🎉 I'm absolutely thrilled to share that I've officially joined Google as a Customer Engineer specialized in AI/Machine Learning! This is a dream come true, especially for a millennial like me who's witnessed firsthand the incredible impact Google has had on our lives! Reflecting on those teenage years, witnessing as the internet started to unfold its wonders, the thought of becoming a Googler was simply unimaginable, it was nothing but a dream far away. Yet, here I stand, thanks to a combination of stubborn determination and the belief that dreams are worth chasing! This achievement is not just mine; it's a shared victory. I couldn't have done it without the unwavering support and encouragement of my incredible husband, Cesar. Through every challenge, he stood by my side, always believing in me, even when I doubted it myself. This journey is just as much his accomplishment as it is mine! That’s why for the Noogler hat's iconic picture, I chose to have my family by my side, the ones who offered a silent yet dedicated encouragement: Cesar, Nikki Sixx and Cyndi Lauper ❤️💛💚💙🤍, they are Googlers (the dogs are Dooglers) just as much as I am! A heartfelt thanks to Carla Letycia, the extraordinary recruiter who recognized the potential in me and paved the way for this life-altering opportunity! Her guidance and support have been invaluable, turning a potential into a reality. Wearing this iconic Noogler hat feels surreal. It's a tangible symbol of a dream fulfilled and a future filled with promise. Google’s value of respect, of giving people a voice and a chance, resonates deeply with me. It aligns perfectly with my own beliefs and that’s the reason I’m here in the first place, Lety gave me a chance and now Google has given me a voice. This is all the ethos that has guided me on this path! Here's to embracing change, daring to dream big, and to the incredible journey ahead. I'm eager to contribute my part to the legacy of innovation that Google represents! I also must thank every fellow Googler who are making this journey incredible, I’m just beyond joy! 🚀 #Noogler #Google #GoogleCloud #machinelearning #artificialintelligence\n\n𝟮𝟱 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝟮𝟱𝘁𝗵 𝗕𝗶𝗿𝘁𝗵𝗱𝗮𝘆 🎂 1.
