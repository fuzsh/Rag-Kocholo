        "text": "After the village school, the excellent pupil attended the grammar school in Troppau (Opava). Poverty could have ended Gregor’s education early. However, a generous and very far-sighted gesture by a 12-year-old opened the way to a sound education for him. Mendel’s sister Theresia gave up a large part of her family inheritance to help him become an educated man. He did not have to drop out of school and was later even able to study at the University of Vienna.\n\nThe siblings remained closely connected throughout their lives. Gregor Mendel also had a close relationship with his nephews, whose education and careers he helped shape.While still at school, he worked as a private teacher in order to afford attending the grammar school. He graduated in 1840 as one of the best.\n\nIn 1845 Mendel began to study theology in Brno and was ordained a priest in 1847. In addition, during his theological studies he attended lectures on the cultivation of fruit trees and viticulture. There he acquired his first knowledge about crossing plants and the foundation stone for his later research work was laid. His superiors noticed his interest in science and offered him a job as a substitute teacher at a grammar school, where he worked for a total of 14 years.\n\nA second attempt to take the teaching examination in Vienna in 1856 also failed. After that, Mendel devoted himself for eight years to systematic research into heredity in peas. The experimental laboratory of his now world-famous crossing experiments was the garden of the monastery in Brno, where some of the descendants of Mendel’s pea plants still grow today.\n\nMore on his experiments at Mendel’s work.\n\nThe research results were then published in 1866. However, these did not generate a significant response from the scientific world. Some attribute this to the misleading title of the publication, which did not show any reference to heredity: “Experiments on Plant Hybrids.” Moreover, it was not until decades later that the value of quantitative-statistical analyses was recognized in botany. His abstract terminology – AA, Aa, aA, aa – was also met with incomprehension in his time. He himself said at the time:\n\nHis now famous study “Experiments on Plant Hybrids” (about 40 pages long), which he presented to about 60 listeners in a lecture in Brno in 1865, met with incomprehension. Although local newspapers also reported on it, apparently no one recognized the significance of his work. After its publication in 1866, the study fell into oblivion. It was not until 1900 that Mendel’s work was rediscovered, almost simultaneously and independently by three researchers, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns and Erich Tschermak. This triumph of recognition was not granted to Mendel: he died already in 1884.\n\nIn 1909, the term “gene” was introduced for Mendel’s “traits”. 100 years after Mendel’s death, the chemical nature of the gene, DNA, was proven. Today, Gregor Mendel is considered the “Father of Genetics”."
