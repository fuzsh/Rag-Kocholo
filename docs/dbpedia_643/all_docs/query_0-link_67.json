The back cross is of two types; they are dominant back cross and recessive back cross. It involves the cross between the F1 offspring with either of the two parents.\n\nQuestion 27.\n\nDefine Genetics.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is the branch of biological science which deals with the mechanism of transmission of characters from parent to off-springs.\n\nQuestion 28.\n\nWhat are multiple alleles?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThree or more alternative forms of a gene that occupy the same locus and control the expression of a single trait.\n\nE.g: ABO blood group\n\nQuestion 29.\n\nWhat are the reasons for Mendel’s successes in his breeding experiment?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe concentrated in one or few characters at a time\n\nFactor are considered as character\n\nPisum sativum has large bi sexual flower so emasculation is very easy for the hybridization process or technique.\n\nBy naturally it is a self-pollinated crop\n\nThis crop has short duration so three or four-generation can be raised in a year\n\nQuestion 30.\n\nExplain the law of dominance in monohybrid cross.\n\nAnswer:\n\nLaw of dominance states that the offsprings of an individual with contrasting (dissimilar) traits will only express the dominant trait in F1 generation and both the characters are expressed in F2 generation. This law also explains the proportion of 3 : 1 ratio in F2 generation.\n\nQuestion 31.\n\nDifferentiate incomplete dominance and codominance.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIncomplete dominance:\n\nEffect of one of the two alleles is more conspicuous.\n\nit produces a fine mixture of the expression of two alleles.\n\nThe effect of hybrid is intermediate expression of the two alleles\n\nIt produces new phenotype.\n\nThe expressed new phenotype has no allele of its own\n\nIt has a quantitative effect.\n\nCo – dominance :\n\nThe effect of both alleles is equally conspicuous.\n\nNo mixing effect of the two alleles\n\nBoth the alleles produces their effect independently.\n\nDoes not produce new phenotype.\n\nThe phenotype is combination of two phenotype and their alleles\n\nA quantitative effect is absent\n\nQuestion 32.\n\nWhat is meant by cytoplasmic inheritance\n\nAnswer:\n\nDNA is a universal genetic material. Genes located in nuclear chromosomes follow Mendelian inheritance. But certain traits are governed either by the chloroplast or mitochondrial genes. This phenomenon is known as extra nuclear inheritance. It is a kind of Non-Mendelian inheritance. Since it involves cytoplasmic organelles such as chloroplast and mitochondrion that act as inheritance vectors, it is also called Cytoplasmic inheritance.\n\nQuestion 33.\n\nDescribe dominant epistasis with an example.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDominant Epistasis – It is a gene interaction in which two alleles of a gene at one locus interfere and suppress or mask the phenotypic expression of a different pair of alleles of another gene at another locus. The gene that suppresses or masks the phenotypic expression of a gene at another locus is known as epistatic.\n\nThe gene whose expression is interfered by non-allelic genes and prevents from exhibiting its character is known as hypostatic. When both the genes are present together, the phenotype is determined by the epistatic gene and not by the hypostatic gene.\n\nIn the summer squash the fruit colour locus has a dominant allele ‘W’ for white colour and a recessive allele ‘w’ for coloured fruit. ‘W’ allele is dominant that masks the expression of any colour.\n\nDominant epistasis in summer squash\n\nIn another locus hypostatic allele ‘G’ is for yellow fruit and its recessive allele ‘g’ for green fruit. In the first locus the white is dominant to colour where as in the second locus yellow is dominant to green. When the white fruit with genotype WWgg is crossed with yellow fruit with genotype wwGG, the F1 plants have white fruit and are heterozygous (WwGg). When F1 heterozygous plants are crossed.\n\nthey give rise to F2 with the phenotypic ratio of 12 white : 3 yellow : 1 green.Since W is epistatic to the alleles ‘G’ and ‘g’, the white which is dominant, masks the effect of yellow or green. Homozygous recessive ww genotypes only can give the coloured fruits (4/16). Double recessive ‘wwgg’ will give green fruit (1/16). The Plants having only ‘G’ in its genotype (wwGg or wwGG) will give the yellow fruit(3/l 6).\n\nQuestion 34.\n\nExplain polygenic inheritance with an example.\n\nAnswer:\n\nPolygenic inheritance – Several genes combine to affect a single trait. A group of genes that together Dark Red determine (contribute) a characteristic of an organism is called polygenic inheritance. It gives explanations to the inheritance of continuous traits which are compatible with Mendel’s Law. The first experiment on polygenic inheritance was demonstrated by Swedish Geneticist H.\n\nNilsson-Ehle (1909) in wheat kernels. Kernel colour is controlled by two genes each with two alleles, one with red kernel colour was dominant to white. He crossed the two pure breeding wheat varieties dark red and a white. Dark red genotypes F1 generation R1R1R2R2 and white genotypes are r1r1r2r2 – F1 generation medium red were obtained with the genotype R1r1R2r2. F1 wheat plant produces\n\nfour types of gametes R1R2, R1r2, r,1r2. The intensity of the red colour is determined by the number of R genes in the F2 generation. Four R genes: A dark red kernel colour is obtained. Three R genes: Medium – dark red kernel colour is obtained. Two R genes: Medium-red kernel colour is obtained. One R gene: Light red kernel colour is obtained. Absence of R gene: Results in White kernel colour.\n\nThe R gene in an additive manner produces the red kernel colour. The number of each phenotype is plotted against the intensity of red kernel colour which produces a bell shaped curve. This represents the distribution of phenotype.\n\nConclusion: Finally the loci that was studied by Nilsson – Ehle were not linked and the genes assorted independently. Later, researchers discovered the third gene that also affect the kernel colour of wheat. The three independent pairs of alleles were involved in wheat kernel colour. Nilsson – Ehle found the ratio of 63 red : 1 white in F2 generation – 1 : 6 : 15 : 20 : 15 : 6 : 1 in F2 generation.\n\nQuestion 35.\n\nDifferentiate continuous variation with discontinuous variation.\n\nAnswer:\n\n1. Discontinuous Variation: Within a population there are some characteristics which show a limited form of variation.\n\nExample: Style length in Primula, plant height of garden pea. In discontinuous variation, the characteristics are controlled by one or two major genes which may have two or more allelic forms.\n\nThese variations are genetically determined by inheritance factors. Individuals produced by this variation show differences without any intermediate form between them and there is no overlapping between the two phenotypes. The phenotypic expression is unaffected by environmental conditions. This is also called as qualitative inheritance\n\n2. Continuous Variation: This variation may be due to the combining effects of environmental and genetic factors. In a population most of the characteristics exhibit a complete gradation, from one extreme to the other without any break. Inheritance of phenotype is determined by the combined effects of many genes, (polygenes) and environmental factors. This is also known as quantitative inheritance.\n\nExample: Human height and skin color.\n\nQuestion 36.\n\nExplain with an example how single genes affect multiple traits and alleles the phenotype of an organism.\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn Pleiotropy, the single gene affects multiple traits and alter the phenotype of the organism. The Pleiotropic gene influences a number of characters simultaneously and such genes are called a pleiotropic gene. Mendel noticed pleiotropy while performing a breeding experiment with peas (Pisum sativum).\n\nPeas with purple flowers, brown seeds, and dark spot on the axils of the leaves were crossed with a variety of peas having white flowers, light-colored seeds, and no spot on the axils of leaves, the three traits for flower colour, seed colour, and leaf axil spot all were inherited together as a single unit. This is due to the pattern of inheritance where the three traits were controlled by a single gene with dominant and recessive alleles. Example: sickle cell anemia.\n\nQuestion 37.\n\nBring out the inheritance of the chloroplast gene with an example.\n\nAnswer:\n\nChloroplast Inheritance\n\nIt is found in the 4 ‘O’Clock plant (Mirabilis jalapa). In this, there are two types of variegated leaves namely dark green-leaved plants and pale green-leaved plants. When the pollen of dark green leaved plant (male) is transferred to the stigma of pale green leaved plant (female) and pollen of pale green leaved plant is transferred to the stigma of dark green leaved plant, the F1 generation of both the crosses must be identical as per Mendelian inheritance. But in the reciprocal cross, the F1 plant differs from each other.\n\nIn each cross, the F plant reveals the character of the plant which is used as a female plant. This inheritance is not through the nuclear gene. It is due to the chloroplast gene found in the ovum of the female plant which contributes to the cytoplasm during fertilization since the male gamete contributes only to the nucleus but not the cytoplasm.\n\nSamacheer Kalvi 12th Bio Botany Classical Genetics Additional Questions and Answers\n\n1 – Mark Questions\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nThe term ‘Genetics’ was introduced by __________\n\n(a) Gregor Mendel\n\n(b) Bateson\n\n(c) Hugo de vries\n\n(d) Carl Correns\n\nAnswer:\n\n(b) Bateson\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nWhich is not a correct statement?\n\n(A) Variations are the raw materials for evolution\n\n(B) Variations provide genetic material for natural selection\n\n(C) It helps the individual to adapt to the changing environment\n\n(D) Variations allow breeders to improve the crop field\n\n(a) A and D\n\n(b) B only\n\n(c) C and D\n\n(d) nono of the above\n\nAnswer:\n\n(d) nono of the above\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nThe process of removal of anthers from the flower is called __________\n\nAnswer:\n\nEmasculation\n\nQuestion 4.\n\nAn allele is __________\n\n(a) another word for a gene\n\n(b) alternate forms of a gene\n\n(c) morphological expression of a gene\n\n(d) genetic\n\nAnswer:\n\n(b) alternate forms of a gene\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nGregor Mendel __________\n\n(i) was born in Czechoslovakia\n\n(ii) did his experiments in Pisum fulvum\n\n(iii) was the first systemic researcher in genetics\n\n(iv) Published his results in the paper “Experiments on Plant Hybrids”\n\n(a) All are correct\n\n(b) (ii),(iii), (iv) are correct\n\n(c) (i), (iii),(iv) are correct\n\n(d) (i), (iii),(iv) are correct\n\nAnswer:\n\n(c) (i), (iii),(iv) are correct\n\nQuestion 6.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA – (ii) B – (iv) C – (iii) D – (i)\n\nQuestion 7.\n\nHow many characters studied by Mendel in pisum sativum\n\n(a) Three\n\n(b) Five\n\n(c) Seven\n\n(d) Nine\n\nAnswer:\n\n(c) Seven\n\nQuestion 8.\n\nMendel’s work were rediscovered by __________\n\n(a) Hugo de Vries\n\n(b) Tschermak\n\n(c) Carl Correns\n\n(d) All the above\n\nAnswer:\n\n(d) All the above\n\nQuestion 9.\n\nCrossing of F1, to any one of the parent refers to __________\n\n(a) selling\n\n(b) back cross\n\n(c) test cross\n\n(d) all of the above\n\nAnswer:\n\n(b) back cross\n\nQuestion 10.\n\nMatch the following\n\nAnswer:\n\nA – (ii)\n\nB – (iv)\n\nC – (i)\n\nD – (iii)\n\nQuestion 11.\n\nIn an intergenic interaction, the gene that suppresses the pherotype of a gene is said to Crossing of F, to any one of the parent refers to __________\n\n(a) Dominant\n\n(b) Inhibitory\n\n(c) Epistatic\n\n(d) Hypostatic\n\nAnswer:\n\n(c) Epistatic\n\nQuestion 12.\n\nAssertion (A) : Test cross is done between F2 hybrid with F1 recessive\n\nReason (R) : It helps to identify the homozygosity of hybrids\n\n(a) A and R are correct R explains A\n\n(b) A and R are incorrect\n\n(c) A is correct R is incorrect\n\n(d) A is incorrect R is correct\n\nAnswer:\n\n(b) A and R are incorrect\n\nQuestion 13.\n\nAssertion (A) : Codominance is an example for intragenic interaction\n\nReason (R) : Interaction take place between the alleles of same gene\n\n(a) A and R are correct R explains A\n\n(b) A and R are incorrect\n\n(c) A is correct R is incorrect\n\n(d) A is incorrect R is correct\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) A and R are correct R explains A\n\nQuestion 14.\n\nAssertion (A) : Pleiotropic gene affects multiple traits\n\nReason (R) : ABO blood group is an example for Pleiotropism\n\n(a) A and R are correct R explains A\n\n(b) A and R are incorrect\n\n(c) A is correct R is incorrect\n\n(d) A is incorrect R is correct\n\nAnswer:\n\n(c) A is correct R is incorrect\n\nQuestion 15.\n\nAssertion (A) : Cytoplasmic male sterility is a Mendelian inheritance\n\nReason (R) : The genes for cytoplasmic male sterility in peal maize is located at mitochondrial DNA\n\n(a) A and R are correct R explains A\n\n(b) A and R are incorrect\n\n(c) A is correct R is incorrect\n\n(d) A is incorrect R is correct\n\nAnswer:\n\n(d) A is incorrect R is correct\n\nQuestion 16.\n\nWhat is the phenotypic ratio in case of incomplete dominance\n\n(a) 9 : 7\n\n(b) 3 : 1\n\n(c) 1 : 2 : 1\n\n(d) 1 : 1 : 1 : 1\n\nAnswer:\n\n(c) 1 : 2 : 1\n\nQuestion 17.\n\nIdentify the mismatched pair\n\n(a) Chloroplast inheritance – Gregor Mendel\n\n(b) Polygenic inheritance – H.

This is called extra nuclear inheritance.\n\nQuestion 28.\n\nWhy extranuclear inheritance is called as cytoplasmic inheritance.\n\nAnswer:\n\nExtra nuclear inheritance is due to genes located on the cytoplasmic organelles such as chloroplast and mitochondrion hence it is called cytoplasmic inheritance.\n\nQuestion 29.\n\nWhat is cytoplasmic male sterility?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn Sorghum vulgare (Pearl maize), the gene located for the sterility pollens are located in the mitochondrial DNA. This phenomenon is called as cytoplasmic male sterility.\n\n3 – Mark Questions\n\nQuestion 30.\n\nPoint out any three importance of variations.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThey help the individuals to adapt themselves to the changing environment.\n\nVariations allow breeders to improve better yield, quicker growth, increased resistance and lesser input.\n\nThey constitute the raw materials for evolution.\n\nQuestion 31.\n\nWhy Mendel selected pea plants for his experiments.\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe choose pea plant because,\n\nIt is an annual plant and has clear contrasting characters that are controlled by a single gene separately.\n\nSelf-fertilization occurred under normal conditions in garden pea plants. Mendel used both self-fertilization and cross-fertilization.\n\nThe flowers are large hence emasculation and pollination are very easy for hybridization.\n\nQuestion 32.\n\nState the law of segregation.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Law of Segregation (Law of Purity of gametes): Alleles do not show any blending. During the formation of gametes, the factors or alleles of a pair separate and segregate from each other such that each gamete receives only one of the two factors. A homozygous parent produces similar gametes and a heterozygous parent produces two kinds of gametes each having one allele with equal proportion. Gametes are never hybrid.\n\nQuestion 33.\n\nHow many types of gametes are produced by heterozygous dihybrid plant with a genotypeRrYy? Write them.\n\nAnswer:\n\nFour gametes – RY, Ry, rY, ry\n\nQuestion 34.\n\nDefine trihybrid cross. Mention its F2 phenotypic ratio.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA cross between homozygous parents that differ in three gene pairs (i.e. producing trihybrids) is called trihybrid cross, F2 Phenotypic ratio -27 : 9 : 9 : 9 : 3 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nQuestion 35.\n\nDefine co-dominance. How it is proved by using Gossypium species?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe phenomenon in which two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygous individual is known as codominance. The codominance was demonstrated in plants with the help of electrophoresis or chromatography for protein or flavonoid substance.\n\nExample: Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium sturtianum, their F1 hybrid (amphiploid) was tested for seed proteins i by electrophoresis. Both the parents have different banding patterns for their seed proteins. In hybrids, additive banding pattern was noticed. Their hybrid shows the presence of both the types of proteins similar to their parents.\n\nQuestion 36.\n\nGive an account on cytoplasmic male sterility.\n\nAnswer:\n\nMale sterility found in pearl maize (Sorgum vulgare) is the best example for mitochondrial cytoplasmic inheritance. So it is called cytoplasmic male sterility. In this, male sterility is inherited maternally. The gene for cytoplasmic male sterility is found in the mitochondrial DNA.\n\nQuestion 37.\n\nWrite a short note on Atavism.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAtavism is a modification of a biological structure whereby an ancestral trait reappears after having been lost through evolutionary changes in the previous generations. Evolutionary traits that have disappeared phenotypically do not necessarily disappear from an organism’s DNA. The gene sequence often remains, but is inactive.\n\nSuch an unused gene may remain in the genome for many generations. As long as the gene remains intact, a fault in the genetic control suppressing the gene can lead to the reappearance of that character again. Reemergence of sexual reproduction in the flowering plant Hieracium pilosella is the best example for Atavism in plants.\n\n5 – Mark Questions\n\nQuestion 38.\n\nExplain Dihybrid cross in pea plant.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe crossing of two plants differing in two pairs of contrasting traits is called dihybrid cross. In dihybrid cross, two characters (colour and shape) are considered at a time. Mendel considered the seed shape (round and wrinkled) and cotyledon colour (yellow & green) as the two characters. In seed shape round (R) is dominant over wrinkled (r); in cotyledon colour yellow (Y) is dominant over green (y).\n\nHence the pure breeding round yellow parent is represented by the genotype RRYY and the pure breeding green wrinkled parent is represented by the genotype rryy. During gamete formation the paired genes of a character assort out ‘ independently of the other pair. During the F1 x F, fertilization each zygote with an equal probability receives one of the four combinations from each parent. The resultant gametes thus will be genetically different and they are of the following four types:\n\n(1) Yellow round (YR) – 9/16\n\n(2) Yellow wrinkled (Yr) – 3/16\n\n(3) Green round (yR) – 3/16\n\n(4) Green wrinkled (yr) -1/16\n\nThese four types of gametes of F1 dihybrids unite randomly in the process of fertilization and produce sixteen types of individuals in F2 in the ratio of 9:3:3:1 as shown in the figure. Mendel’s 9:3:3:1 dihybrid ratio is an ideal ratio based on the probability including segregation, independent assortment and random fertilization. In sexually reproducing organism / plants from the garden peas to human beings, Mendel’s findings laid the foundation for understanding inheritance and revolutionized the field of biology. The dihybrid cross and its result led Mendel to propose a second set of generalisations that we called Mendel’s Law of independent assortment.\n\nQuestion 39.\n\nHow does the wrinkled gene make Mendel’s peas wrinkled? Find out the molecular explanation.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe protein called starch branching enzyme (SBEI) is encoded by the wild-type allele of the gene (RR) which is dominant. When the seed matures, this enzyme SBEI catalyzes the formation of highly branched starch molecules. Normal gene (R) has become interrupted by the insertion of extra piece of DNA (0.8 kb) into the gene, resulting in allele. In the homozygous mutant form of the gene (R) which is recessive, the activity of the enzyme SBEI is lost resulting in wrinkled peas.\n\nThe wrinkled seed accumulates more sucrose and high water content. Hence Ore osmotic pressure inside the seed rises. As a result, the seed absorbs more water and when it matures it loses water as it dries. So it becomes wrinkled at maturation. When the seed has at least one copy of normal dominant gene heterozygous, the dominant allele helps to synthesize starch, amylopectin an insoluble carbohydrate, with the osmotic balance which minimises the loss of water resulting in smooth structured round seed.\n\nQuestion 40.\n\nDescribe incomplete dominance exhibited by Mirabilis jalapa.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe German Botanist Carl Correns’s (1905) Experiment – In 4 O’ clock plant, Mirabilis jalapa when the pure breeding homozygous red (R1R1) parent is crossed with homozygous white (R2R2), the phenotype of the F1 hybrid is heterozygous pink (R1R2). The F1 heterozygous phenotype differs from both the parental homozygous phenotype. This cross did not exhibit the character of the dominant parent but an intermediate colour pink. When one allele is not completely dominant to another allele it shows incomplete dominance. Such allelic interaction is known as incomplete dominance. F1 generation produces intermediate phenotype pink coloured flower.\n\nWhen pink coloured plants of F1 generation were interbred in F2 both phenotypic and genotypic ratios were found to be identical as 1 : 2 :1(1 red: 2 pink: 1 white). Genotypic ratio is 1 R1 R1 : 2 R1R2 : 1 R2R2. From this we conclude that the alleles themselves remain discrete and unaltered proving the Mendel’s Law of Segregation. The phenotypic and genotypic ratios are the same. There is no blending of genes. In the F1 generation R1 and R2 genes segregate and recombine to produce red, pink and white in the ratio of 1 : 2 : 1. R1 allele codes for an enzyme responsible for the formation of red pigment. R2 allele codes for defective enzyme.\n\nR1 and R2 genotypes produce only enough red pigments to make the flower pink. Two R1 R2 are needed for producing red flowers. Two R2R2 genes are needed for white flowers. If blending had taken place, the original pure traits would not have appeared and all F2 plants would have pink flowers. It is very clear that Mendel’s particulate inheritance takes place in this cross which is confirmed by the reappearance of original phenotype in F2.\n\nHigher Order Thinking Skills (HOTs) Questions\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nA yellow colour flower plant indicated by YY is crossed with white color flower plant denoted by yy.\n\n(a) following the Mendelian inheritance pattern, what would be the flower color is first filial generation?\n\n(b) Which Mendelian principle is illustrated in this cross?\n\n(c) Derive the cross and state the phenotypic ratio of yellow flowers to white flowers in F2 generation?\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) F1 plants produce yellow colour flower plants.\n\n(b) Law of dominance and Law of segregation\n\n(c)\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nMala is a genetic research student.
