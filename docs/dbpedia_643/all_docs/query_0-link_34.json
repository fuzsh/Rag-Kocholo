        "text": "For Germans, however, level of negotiation is matter of principle which affects more issues than pass question. It has always been possible that Germans (as well as Allies) might achieve numerous specific gains re access and freedom of travel if they were willing to deal with state authorities designated by GDR. In past FRG has invariably declined to do so except through IZT and certain technical channels, which have largely been limited to post, rail and waterways, i.e., to areas where something like all-German regimens still exist. Germans seem to maintain rationale for pass talks that only “technical contacts” are still involved. Although this may satisfy public, it does not alter transaction.\n\nBasic fact is that Erhard and Brandt have sanctioned type of approach which, if modified, could go long way toward satisfying substance as well as form of GDR demands on other outstanding past questions, such as (a) FRG 1962 credit offer (which involved access to East Sector for West Berliners), (b) intra-Berlin mail and (c) Hof Bridge."
