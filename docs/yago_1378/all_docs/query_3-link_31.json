        "text": "When he made his directorial debut in 1970, Nicolas Roeg was already a 23-year veteran of the British film industry, starting out in 1947 as an editing apprentice and working his way up to cinematographer twelve years later. He first came to attention as part of the second unit on David Lean's Lawrence von Arabien (1962), with Roger Corman's Satanas - Das Schloß der blutigen Bestie (1964) two years later containing his first really distinctive solo work. He went on to photograph films for such distinguished directors as François Truffaut (Fahrenheit 451 (1966)), John Schlesinger (Die Herrin von Thornhill (1967)) and Richard Lester (Petulia (1968)) before his sensational directorial debut in 1968. Co-directed with writer (and painter) Donald Cammell, Performance (1970) was intended to be a simple-minded star vehicle for Mick Jagger and Warner Bros were so horrified when they saw the final multi-layered kaleidoscope of sex, violence, and questions of identity that they delayed its release for two years. Roeg went to Australia for his solo debut as director (Walkabout - Der Traum vom Leben (1971)), which was also his last film as cinematographer, and throughout the next decade he produced a world-class body of work (Wenn die Gondeln Trauer tragen (1973); Der Mann, der vom Himmel fiel (1976); Blackout - Anatomie einer Leidenschaft (1980)) that revealed his uniquely off-kilter view of the world, expressed through fragmented, dislocated images and a highly original yet strangely accessible approach to narrative. He married the star of Blackout - Anatomie einer Leidenschaft (1980), the elegant Theresa Russell who would play the female lead in nearly all his subsequent films, though these have generally found less favor with critics and audiences, and the release of both Eureka (1983) and Kalter Himmel (1991) was severely restricted due to problems with the films' distributors.\n\nAfter army service he joined the cutting rooms of MGM's British Studios where his duties included working on dubbing French films into English. He soon moved to the production side as a clapper boy and became part of cinematographer Freddie Youngs crew on such as Ivanhoe, Bhwanhi Junction, He worked his way up to camera operator on The Trials of Oscar Wilde, Jazz Boat and The Man Inside then went to Australia as cameraman on The Sundowners for Fred Zimmerman, he also wrote and directed musical topical event shows for television and gained his first experience as a lighting cameraman on such as Ghost Squad his debut in those duties on film was on Doctor Crippen and The Caretaker, During that period he collaborated on an original scripts for A Prize of Arms and Sanders of the River, ' He received acclaim for his colour photography on Nothing But the Best and 2nd unit work on Lawrence of Arabia then he directed the 2nd unit on Judith, After further films as lighting cameraman he co directed Perfomance and directed Walkabout. He married the actress Susan Stephen and had 4 sons"
