        "text": "The British director Nicolas Roeg, who died last week, at ninety, had a knack for filming nightmarish dread in broad daylight. (Anyone who watched “The Witches” (1990) as a child remembers not a shadowy cauldron but a harshly lit hotel conference room in which Anjelica Huston peels off her face to reveal her hideous witch self.) Roeg started as a cinematographer, with credits including “Fahrenheit 451” and “Far from the Madding Crowd,” and began directing films in the seventies, including the David Bowie vehicle “The Man Who Fell to Earth.” In 1973, he came out with the psychological thriller “Don’t Look Now,” based on a Daphne du Maurier tale. It tells the story of a married couple, John (Donald Sutherland) and Laura (the surpassingly gorgeous Julie Christie), whose little girl drowns in a lake. The action then moves to Venice, where John has been hired to restore an old church. They meet a clairvoyant blind woman (the supremely creepy Hilary Mason), who claims to bear messages from their daughter and delivers shrieking warnings of imminent danger. John also appears to have psychic abilities, which both compel and deter him.\n\nBut the heart of the film is the couple’s shared grief, and the tricks of the mind that it plays on them. The quick-cut editing blurs past, present, and future, with flashes of unsettling imagery: a bicycle running over a pane of glass, a blob of red paint enveloping a photograph of a church. The film has an itchy grasp on the uncanny, much like other breakthrough thrillers of its day, among them “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Exorcist.” But neither of those movies boasts a four-and-a-half-minute sex scene so jarringly real-looking that it was rumored to be unsimulated. (Sutherland has insisted that it was staged.)\n\nCoitus aside, Roeg’s Venice has not a speck of romance: this is a decaying, labyrinthine city of death, where a wrong step can render you lost or underwater. In one scene, the psychic woman remarks, of her sister, “She says it’s like a city in aspic left over from a dinner party, and all the guests are dead and gone. It frightens her. Too many shadows.” Still, Roeg didn’t need shadows to make Venice scary. The most nauseating scenes are shot under the pale winter sun. As with “The Witches,” Roeg may rely too much on withered old ladies to deliver scares, but the real fear factor lies in the unexplainable; at one point, John sees his wife glide by on a hearse gondola, when she has just flown to England that morning. To revisit “Don’t Look Now” is to see its eerie influence on such directors as Darren Aronofsky (“Black Swan”), Ryan Murphy (“American Horror Story”), and Luca Guadagnino (“Suspiria”). Watch it with the lights on."
