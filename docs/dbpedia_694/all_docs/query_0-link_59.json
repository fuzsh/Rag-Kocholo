Take this month to appreciate your work, and those who inspire you. Fill the well of inspiration with a workshop. Shake up your writing routine with some new directions. Set some new poetry-writing goals — whether it be performing at an open mike, or creating your first chapbook. Spread your love of poetry a little further.\n\nHere’s a list of 26 ways to celebrate National Poetry Month — from A-Z. Let’s make it a month to remember!\n\nArt as Inspiration (Artist Date #1): Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way introduced me to this wonderful practice to nurture creativity when I was in my ‘20’s. It’s recommended to do artist’s dates solo. Head to an art gallery with a notebook. Enjoy pondering paintings — take notes on art that strikes you. Try these prompts and write an ekphrastic poem."
