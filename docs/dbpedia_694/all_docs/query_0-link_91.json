        "text": "My January notebook is painted and awaiting the scribed words for the cover – ones from the poet Hazel Hall that wish to be my guide throughout the month of January.\n\nLet me tell you about some of my writerly rituals for the beginning of a new month.\n\nMy notebooks are these pink leatherettes from Walmart. I do love them and fill one notebook each month. They are cheap and sturdy, with paper thick enough to resist the bleeding of any pen. My only angst is that I can only find them in the color of pink. It didn’t used to be this way. Walmart used to carry them in a variety of colors – but no more. Only pink they offer. So, I started painting them. A lovely color of the month adorns each notebook, along with some artful designs. A wide open space is left in the center for the poetic words chosen from my poet guide of the month. I often don’t know what those words are until mid-month – the words that keep appearing in my days become the chosen words.\n\nA couple of years ago, I read a post by Austin Kleon about how he starts his notebooks. What stood out specifically was his ritual of adopting a guardian spirit over the notebook. I tucked this idea away to let it marinate for awhile and this year poets began waving their hands at me, asking to be personal guides for my writing and my living. I remembered Austin’s ritual and decided I would choose one poet each month as a guide for my writing, notebook and living to see what would evolve.\n\nI hold an audition the first day of January inviting a few poets that might fit the job description for the month as Poet Guide. Auditioning this month were four poets I’ve had my eye on. January’s preferred requirements: give insight to my ancestry (great grandmothers), poet’s subjects speak to my January themes, poet’s work has craft that is admirable AND within my reach (so I might try it out in my own poems).\n\nHere’s who have appeared:\n\n1. Ted Kooser/ I bought his book Winter Morning Walks and so want to explore it deeply. As a Winter Walker, I’m already seeing with new eyes because of his words;\n\n2. Willa Cather/a female poet from the early 20th century (and there are so few), who writes of the prairie and nature;\n\n3. Julia Hartwig/a Polish poet, again female who wrote a book of poems titled In Praise of the Unfinished, and I think she may know me;\n\n4. and finally Hazel Hall/ because I’ve been saving and admiring her poem “Mending” for months and a seasonal theme for January is mending. She writes of sewing, loneliness and being lost and I intend to begin two quilts this month. She’s an overlooked poet and is said to be the utmost poet of observation.\n\n*****Hazel Hall was my chosen guide.\n\nJust look at her and her poems! How could I pass her by?\n\nAfter a little play in my notebook, adding her images in dedication to this notebook honoring her words as guidance, and making a little book to fill as I learn more about the life of this lovely human being, I glue an old envelope in (this one, an old birthday card from my mother – see her beautiful handwriting with my name?). Then, I do some googling and search for poems and I fill the envelope with Hazel’s poems, keeping them at the ready for the days of January.\n\nThe notebook is ready. And my guide awaits her role as daily mentor, wise way-shower and poetic hand-holder.\n\nNot every day, but many days out of the month, I reach for a poem after my daily entry. Magically, the words resonate with the words I’ve scribed on the pages of my notebook for that day. And, I feel enveloped in compassion, knowing another soul understands my angst. Gratitude is given for her gift in stringing together letters, words and phrases to meet me here.\n\nClosing my notebook, I say thank you. Thank you to Hazel, to the moment of connection, to the words captured in my notebook for safe-keeping of who I was on this day. And, I await for the next time we are to meet – here – in this space I’ve carved for us each day.\n\nI am participating in today’s twowritingteachers Tuesday Slice of Life. Please head over to their page to read the smallish stories that describe the moments of of other slicers. They are delightful.\n\nOr, add your own.\n\nMy husband is trying to teach me to swim this year. I’ve never liked swimming. I think I was traumatized in middle school during swimming lessons with water up my nose and a stolen swim suit. Regardless, I’m determined to test my edges this year, and say yes to the things I’ve most often avoided. Swimming is one of those things.\n\nYesterday was my 10th visit to the pool with my husband. I was able to swim an entire lap (50 yards) of the American crawl. . . with a buoy between my legs to keep me afloat and allow me to focus on my breathing. My husband, who swam in high school and college, hailed this as progress.\n\nThe moment begged to be a poem to document the event.\n\nScaffolding ~ She began her quest of 1000 yards of the American crawl or front crawl as originated by Ojibwa swimmers named Flying Gull and Tobacco some time in the early 1800's. Tending to her breath arms and legs neglected her body sank like a ship with too much cargo a buoy placed between her thighs supported her to the end You're doing it hon, he cheered. You're actually swimming! Applauding her progress, a beaming smile admired her yet. . . she resisted - shaking her head. It's like cheating, she degraded herself Needing a device to keep me afloat? I should not need this extra help. The yards do not count. They are cheapened. Yes, they do count, he assured her pride I count my yards swimming with buoys and boards. You do? she questioned her All American Swimmer. I didn't know. . . Who do I think I am? her expectations chased away by the sword of the teacher. 8 tons of cargo lifted from her drowning ship. Shari Daniels; draft 2022\n\nI’m taking part in Poetry Friday this year and if you’d like to join us and add your poem, head over to Carol’s site at Literacy Link and join us! Or, you might just like to grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the poems that others have shared there.\n\nWhatever you decide, I hope you are safe and warm today. Take tender care of yourself and those you love."
