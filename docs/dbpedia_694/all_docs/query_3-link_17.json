        "text": "Artist Dates are assigned play.\n\nThe Artist Date is a once-weekly, festive, solo expedition to explore\n\nsomething that interests you. The Artist Date need not be overtly\n\n“artistic” — think mischief more than mastery. Artist Dates fire up the\n\nimagination. They spark whimsy. They encourage play. Since art is about the\n\nplay of ideas, they feed our creative work by replenishing our inner well\n\nof images and inspiration. When choosing an Artist Date, it is good to ask\n\nyourself, “what sounds fun?” — and then allow yourself to try it."
