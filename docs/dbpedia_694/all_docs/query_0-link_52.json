        "text": "Established in 1955, the University and College Poetry Prize program began with ten schools. Today, the Academy of American Poets sponsors over two hundred annual poetry prizes at colleges and universities across the U.S, and has awarded cash prizes to nearly ten thousand student poets since the program's inception. The recognition winning student poets receive provides important validation. As one student poet, Emily, shared, \"As a young poet the prize not only made me feel as if my work had something of value, it made me feel connected with the broader poetic community. It increased my confidence in my writing and encouraged me to continue working at my craft.\"\n\nHistory\n\nMany of our most esteemed poets won their first recognition through an Academy of American Poets College Prize, including Diane Ackerman, Toi Derricotte, Mark Doty, Alice Fulton, Tess Gallagher, Louise Glück, Allen Grossman, Jorie Graham, Kimiko Hahn, Joy Harjo, Robert Hass, Li-Young Lee, Brad Leithauser, J. D. McClatchy, Heather McHugh, Gregory Orr, Robert Pinsky, Sylvia Plath, Mark Rudman, Mary Jo Salter, Gjertrud Schnackenberg, George Starbuck, Mark Strand, Ocean Vuong, and Charles Wright.\n\nEstablishing a Prize\n\nThe majority of the active University and College Poetry Prizes are endowed in perpetuity.\n\nNew U.S. schools are admitted into the program only with a $5,000 endowment contribution, which allows a cash prize of $100 to be awarded each year in perpetuity, enables the Academy of American Poets to provide a year-long membership to the winning student, and assists with the administrative costs of the program. We encourage anyone wishing to endow a college prize to contact the Awards Coordinator before selecting a school. We want to ensure the school's ability to annually award the prize. Additionally, some of our oldest prizes do not yet have endowments, and we would very much like to see them secured.\n\nA prize may be named by the donor or donors, and all contributions are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.\n\nDonors receive copies of their schools' winning poems each year, as well as a lifetime subscription to American Poets, the Academy's biannual journal.\n\nPrize Eligibility\n\nEach participating school determines whether to make its prize open to undergraduates, graduate students, or both, and sets restrictions on submission length, deadline, and number of poems. No restrictions may be made regarding theme or style. Only registered students of a given participating school are eligible for the prize offered through that institution. If you are a student and have already determined that your school hosts an Academy prize, but do not know whom to contact for guidelines, please write to Nikay Paredes, Programs Director, for details. Be sure to include the name of the school.\n\nContest Procedures\n\nFall\n\nA faculty member at each participating school, usually in the English department or writing program, works to coordinate the contest with the Academy to ensure that it is properly conducted each year. The prize coordinator serves as a liaison with the Academy, selecting judges and controlling such matters as the contest deadline, eligibility (a contest may be open to undergraduates, graduate students, or both), the number of poems to be submitted by each student, and local publicity.\n\nSpring\n\nThe Academy supplies each coordinator with a form for reporting the contest results. The coordinator is required to provide contact information for the winner and data about the contest administration, as well as copies of each winning poem.\n\nEach school awards $100 to a sole winner. In addition, one student may be selected for honorable mention.\n\nThe Academy issues prize checks and letters of congratulation to the winners, and also sends letters of congratulation to honorable mentions. All winners are announced in the Academy's Annual Report.\n\nFor questions, please contact Nikay Paredes, Programs Director.\n\nPast Winners\n\n2022 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2021 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2020 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2019 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2018 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2017 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2016 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\n2015 University & College Poetry Prizes\n\nParticipating Colleges & Universities\n\nAgnes Scott College\n\nPrize Name: Janef Preston Poetry Prize\n\nFounded: 1976\n\nDonor: Agnes Scott College\n\n2023 Prizewinner: Julian River, “august”\n\nUniversity of Alabama\n\nPrize Name: Hill-Kohn Prize\n\nFounded: 1983\n\nDonor: University of Alabama\n\n2023 Prizewinner: Isabelle Doyle, “Hello Glacier”\n\nAmherst College\n\nPrize Name: Academy of American Poets Prize\n\nFounded: 1959\n\nDonor: Trustees of Amherst College\n\n2023 Prizewinner: Kei Lim, “Evergreen”\n\nAquinas College\n\nPrize Name: Academy of American Poets Prize\n\nFounded: 2001\n\nDonor: Mrs. Linda Nemec Foster\n\n2023 Prizewinner: Jenna Hoinke, “​​My Grandfather’s Broken English”\n\nArizona State University\n\nPrize Name: Katharine C.
