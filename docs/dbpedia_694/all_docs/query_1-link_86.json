        "text": "Self-help books provide the guidance and even the road map for accomplishing things we may dream of but lack the confidence to achieve. The best self-growth books are accessible, encouraging and feature a compelling story that pulls together the inspiring words. Self-improvement and self-development books remain staples on bestseller lists for good reason. They can help you change your life, but more than that—they help you believe the change can happen, which is often half the battle. This list of top personal development books includes authors of all different backgrounds, advising on a range of topics, from financial well-being to overcoming trauma.\n\nThe Greatest Self-Help Books Of All Time\n\nSelf-help books assist people with improving their lives. They offer strategies from experts who have often struggled with the problem they’re addressing and found ways to overcome it. The approach often includes raising self-awareness and using techniques for greater productivity and assertiveness.\n\nWhat is the difference between self-help books, personal growth books and self-development books? Self-help books cover the entire genre of books dedicated to self-improvement, and the other two fall under that umbrella. Personal growth books focus on becoming more self-aware and addressing the attitude and behaviors that underly obstacles to improvement. Self-development, on the other hand, is more about the actions that lead to self-improvement. This list of the 25 best self-help books includes personal growth and self-development books.\n\n25.
