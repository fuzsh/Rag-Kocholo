In the thirty years following the publication of The Artist's Way, Julia Cameron relied on an essential tool to help her through every juncture in life: writing for guidance. Now, in Living the Artist's Way, Cameron finally shares this method with the world as the fourth main Artist's Way tool. Over the course of six weeks, readers learn how to ask for guidance from a higher power within themselves, and trust the answers they receive.

This handbook to seeking and accepting guidance will help readers follow Cameron's path, becoming creatively unblocked, happier, and more productive.
