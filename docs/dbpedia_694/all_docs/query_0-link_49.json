        "text": "Every person who cares should read!\n\nListened many times and will many more. Each time I hear something differently and new to me.\n\nNot only for artist.\n\nI really liked the gentle pace in which the author presented each section. The exercises are simple and impactful. This is the kind of book that when you listen to it again you seem to hear something new. It gave me permission to feel what I feel and know that I am evolving toward my true self. I recommend this book to ANYONE that feels this book is only for artist. I will be promoting this and using these tips for myself and for my clients. Julia, thank you again for creating a very sacred space in listening to this audio. #WhatsYourVibe? #MyFabulousFifties #PeaceWithinPromotesPeace\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nWith all the drama of 2020, I sensed a growing internal need for personal change, and that urge wasn't gonna take no for an answer. I mentioned to a friend that I had this urge to change some things in my life and was considering doing the 12-week Artist's Way course. It just so happened that she had been thinking similarly. Within a week's time, 5 other women friends expressed a desire to join us. That was early October. Tonight, December the 20th, we completed the 12th week of the course during our last 2-hour weekly Zoom gathering. . We aren't the same women who started the course back in October. Our individual evolution has been amazing. As her end of the course project, one member produced and presented to the group a 2021 calendar of her nature photos. She's begun other projects with her photography. Her akashic reading practice has taken off. Another member pulled out a manuscript she had begun to write and illustrate. Another member is in the process of converting her in-person workshops to on-lime presentations. Oh, by the way, all these women are in their 70's. It's been a rewarding experience perfect for these uncertain and challenging days of mass political chaos and the threat of COVID-19. We all have a renewed focus, purpose, and the strength of our awakened artist. 2021 is looking hopeful thanks to The Artist's Way.\n\nRead and invite healing\n\nJulia Cannon does a great job at describing the pitfalls of an Artist but not only in describing but also giving us tools to get out of those pits we have fallen into.\n\nI’d recommend this book to anyone who feels stagnant in their creative efforts or anyone who seeks to rekindle their child like spirit.\n\nit's good but not great...\n\nWhat did you love best about The Artist's Way?\n\nIt does reinforce the same platitudes of hard work, open mindedness, and embracing change that are ubiquitous in these kind of books.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of The Artist's Way?\n\nShe had a good quote about the universe being prodigal in its assistance while we are miserly to accept it.\n\nWhich character – as performed by Julia Cameron – was your favorite?\n\nShe was fine as an orator.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nNo. I was insensate.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nMy biggest gripe was the litany of \"homework\" assignments that the author foists upon the reader. Just too much of that. It stressed me out just thinking of all the things she suggested. If you want real motivation I recommend The War of Art instead.\n\nvery helpful\n\nIt was a good book, I was pleased to find out there were alot of things she mentioned that I was already doing on my own but she offered alto of in site into some perspectives I had not taken into account and gave me some good ideas."
