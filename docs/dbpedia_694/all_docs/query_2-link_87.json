        "text": "Praise for THE ARTIST'S WAY...\n\n“THE ARTISTS WAY by Julia Cameron is not exclusively about writing—it is about discovering and developing the artist within whether a painter, poet, screenwriter or musician—but it is a lot about writing. If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. Its about learning to pay attention.”\n\n--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle\n\n“The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [THE ARTISTS WAY] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record would be commercial.”\n\n--Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea\n\n“Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce encouraged. The result is spiritual creativity as a consistent and nourishing part of daily life.”\n\n--Venture Inward\n\n“I never knew I was a visual artist until I read Julia Camerons THE ARTISTS WAY.”\n\n--Jannene Behl in Artists Magazine\n\n“Julia Camerons landmark book THE ARTISTS WAY helped me figure out who I really was as an adult, not so much as an artist but as a person. And award-winning journalist and poet, Camerons genius is that she doesnt tell readers what they should do to achieve or who they should be—instead she creates a map for readers to start exploring these questions themselves.”\n\n--Michael F. Melcher, Law Practice magazine\n\n“This is not a self-help book in the normative sense. It is simply a powerful book that can challenge one to move into an entirely different state of personal expression and growth.”\n\n--Nick Maddox, Deland Beacon\n\n“THE ARTISTS WAY (with its companion volume THE ARTISTS WAY MORNING PAGES JOURNAL) becomes a friend over time, not just a journal. Like a journal, it provokes spontaneous insights and solutions; beyond journaling, it establishes a process that is interactive and dynamic.”\n\n--Theresa L. Crenshaw, M.D., San Diego Union-Tribune\n\n“If you really want to supercharge your writing, I recommend that you get a copy of Julia Camerons book THE ARTISTS WAY. Im not a big fan of self-help books, but this book has changed my life for the better and restored my previously lagging creativity.”\n\n--Jeffrey Bairstow, Laser Focus World\n\n“Working with the principle that creative expression is the natural direction of life, Cameron developed a three month program to recover creativity. THE ARTISTS WAY shows how to tap into the higher power that connects human creativity and the creative energies of the universe.”\n\n--Mike Gossie, Scottsdale Tribune\n\n“THE ARTISTS WAY is the seminal book on the subject of creativity and an invaluable guide to living the artistic life. Still as vital today—or perhaps even more so—than it was when it was first published in 1992, it is a provocative and inspiring work. Updated and expanded, it reframes THE ARTISTS WAY for a new century.”\n\n--Branches of Light\n\n“THE ARTISTS WAY has sold over 3 million copies since its publication in 1992. Cameron still teaches it because there is sustained demand for its thoughtful, spiritual approach to unblocking and nurturing creativity. It is, dare we say, timeless.”\n\n--Nancy Colasurdo, FOXBusiness\n\nPraise for VEIN OF GOLD, the second volume in the ARTISTS WAY trilogy\n\n“For those seeking the wellspring of creativity, this book, like its predecessor, is a solid gold diving rod.”\n\n--PUBLISHERS WEEKLY\n\nPraise for ARTISTS WAY EVERY DAY…\n\n“Ive been a huge fan of Julia Camerons work since I first delved into THE ARTISTS WAY over a decade ago. Since then shes continued to create a series of inspirational books, the latest of which is THE ARTISTS WAY EVERY DAY, a wonderful collection of meditations and daily inspiration. A great addition to any collection of meditation and inspirational materials, Ms. Camerons new offering is sure to guide you in a new direction.”\n\n--Dishmag.com\n\n“Now, Camerons most vital work is accessible in a daily guide. Intended for study for the course of a year, THE ARTISTS WAY EVERY DAY extracts the essential teachings from Camerons groundbreaking work and assigns them to each of the 365 days.”"
