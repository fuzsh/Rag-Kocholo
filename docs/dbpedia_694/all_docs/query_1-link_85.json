        "text": "In the aftermath of the deadly condominium collapse in the Miami suburb of Surfside, Fla., three years ago, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law regulations mandating that buildings at least 30 years old undergo structural inspections. By 2025, condo associations must have enough money set aside to fund needed renovations.\n\nThese regulations will significantly impact condo owners across Florida, some of whom may have to pay thousands of dollars for home improvements in the coming years. Homeowners seeking to sell their condos may also find that the laws are impacting the market value of their homes.\n\nDo you own a condo in Florida that requires improvements in order to comply with the law? If so, The Times wants to hear from you. Weâ€™d like to know more about additional expenses you may be facing, and whether you think you will sell your condo or stay put."
