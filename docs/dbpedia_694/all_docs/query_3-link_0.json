        "text": "REMEMBERING\n\nI was not there when your mother bore you.\n\nSurely you came into this world, hungering and wet.\n\nWe all do that.\n\nSurely you came like the rest of us\n\nFrom that dark sea of souls,\n\nThat sighing that brings us forth\n\nAnd calls us back — we all share that.\n\nIf this is true, and it is — even for you —\n\nWhy are you a broken glass smashed against\n\nThe floor? Why not the seas’ grass on\n\nThe ocean floor? Why not a smooth stone, a willow\n\nIn the wind? Why do you break, not bend, and\n\nEven broken, why not mend? You do know how.\n\nWalk with me to the edge of the city.\n\nTake off your shoes and feel the earth.\n\nIt is softer than a woman.\n\nIt is safer than your father.\n\nIt is water. It is air.\n\nIt is where you are returning\n\nWith this yearning you can’t name.\n\nCast off your shame. It is an old coat.\n\nRemember who you are. You are a star,\n\nA mountain, that fountain in the sun.\n\nYour heart is the velvet cave.\n\nWhere birds sing.\n\nAre you remembering?\n\nCOME TO ME\n\nCome to me.\n\nThere is no darkness in which\n\nI cannot see you.\n\nCome to me.\n\nMy green heart holds your ancestors.\n\nThey are waiting to hear your dreams.\n\nSpeak to them. They know your name.\n\nDo not imagine you are alone.\n\nDo not imagine they have left you.\n\nThey are listening,\n\nWaiting for your voice.\n\nCome home. All of us are waiting.\n\nEvery bird remembers you.\n\nThe lion, in his pride, still knows your name.\n\nThe gazelle, the snake, the silver heron\n\nLifting at the shore— all these and more—\n\nYour family.\n\nCome back to me. You do not need to grind your bones to dust,\n\nRusting your heart.\n\nYou are known to us,\n\nOnly come home.\n\nMY COUNTRY\n\nIn my country music is forbidden\n\nLest you hear it and start dancing in the streets,\n\nWeeping for your glory.\n\nIn my country poetry is not allowed\n\nFor fear you will hear your name And start speaking in tongues.\n\nIf you dance in my country,\n\nThey will break your bones\n\nAnd turn you into beggars.\n\nIn my country, children are\n\nTaught to march in rows.\n\nFear is baked in the bread.\n\nI love my country.\n\nThere is no heartbreak,\n\nOnly misery.\n\nQuiet as a hungry woman weeping.\n\nI love my country.\n\nThere is no passion. It holds\n\nDampened desires, embraces, but no fires.\n\nMy country has safety.\n\nMy country has rules.\n\nMy country has no kings.\n\nMy country has no fools.\n\nIn my country, you would not be welcome.\n\nLook what you’ve done to my daughter,\n\nThe way she combs her hair, humming,\n\nAnd lives on water.\n\nMy son wants to follow you,\n\nBut I won’t allow it.\n\nHe has no need to see the mountains\n\nAnd the sea.\n\nAnd if he does,\n\nHe will just forget them.\n\nAs I have.\n\nOnce I lived in the country you call home.\n\nIt is the land of my ancestors\n\nWhich I left behind.\n\nWhat did I need with clouds at my feet,\n\nThe moon still there for breakfast?\n\nIt was a treacherous country.\n\nFreedom can break your heart.\n\nI remember one night dancing with a woman who stole my breath.\n\nI was close to death from her kisses\n\nShe smelled like mist.\n\nI still smell that woman if I dream.\n\nIf I dream, there is singing,\n\nThe ringing out of music in my bones.\n\nIf I dream, these cities turn to ashes,\n\nThe tall grasses sway again,\n\nI laugh with friends.\n\nOh, you are dangerous to me.\n\nMy country can’t survive you—\n\nAnd your laughter.\n\nYOU DO KNOW ME\n\nYou know me.\n\nI have been walking toward you on your breath.\n\nYou know me.\n\nI have been waiting in your bones.\n\nIf I am unfamiliar, so is air.\n\nI was always there.\n\nWhen you were young and roaming the green hills\n\nSmelling the sea—\n\nThat was me.\n\nLater when you grew older and bolder\n\nThen they knew\n\nI was the street lamp on that wet night.\n\nThe Seine told you its secrets and said,\n\nBegin.\n\nYou did begin. I was the window\n\nThat you saw you in—\n\nI tapped the pane, you turned away.\n\nYou thought I was the cat—\n\nAnd there was truth to that.\n\nI have walked through alleys Darkened by your pain.\n\nI have been those valleys\n\nWhere you saw again.\n\nYou do know me.\n\nPEAR\n\nIt is like this.\n\nThere is a pear on the table.\n\nIts flank is every woman I have ever known.\n\nThere are flowers in a vase by the window.\n\nPeonies, lilacs, anemones, tulips.\n\nTheir petals are every woman\n\nI have ever known.\n\nThe flesh of the pear.\n\nThe scent of the flower.\n\nThe soup boiled down from parts.\n\nOur hearts are like this,\n\nThe mixture as before—\n\nBut one thing more—\n\nYou are my water.\n\nJERUSALEM IS WALKING IN THIS WORLD\n\nThis is a great happiness.\n\nThe air is silk.\n\nThere is milk in the looks That come from strangers. I could not be happier If I were bread and you could eat me.\n\nJoy is dangerous.\n\nIt fills me with secrets.\n\n“Yes” hisses in my veins.\n\nThe pains I take to hide myself\n\nAre sheer as glass.\n\nSurely this will pass,\n\nThe wind like kisses,\n\nThe music in the soup,\n\nThe group of trees,\n\nLaughing as I say their names.\n\nIt is all hosannah.\n\nIt is all prayer.\n\nJerusalem is walking in this world.\n\nJerusalem is walking in this world.\n\nAFRICA\n\nWe are all Africa.\n\nThe moist darkness,\n\nThe beast moving through the trees.\n\nWe are jungle,\n\nWaterfall,\n\nThe pitched screaming of a bird\n\nWe cannot name.\n\nI am the light on the flank\n\nOf that mountain—\n\nLooming above the plain\n\nPurple as a bruise.\n\nWhat is there to lose?\n\nI am the okapi\n\nLeaping in the air—\n\nAnd that, there,\n\nThe great and quiet snake,\n\nLarger than a tree limb,\n\nDraped across the path.\n\nWe all change shape.\n\nIn the morning light,\n\nI am bright in my darkness.\n\n“Panther” is just another word for night.\n\nYou’ve got that right.\n\nThat is part of me—\n\nBut we are all Africa.\n\nAnd it is not the dark which makes this right.\n\nThere, from that still lake—\n\nSee the shape I make:\n\nA rosy pink that rises like applause.\n\nI sheath my claws, I feather my furred chest.\n\nThis is the best. I wheel like music.\n\nWe are all that winged thing.\n\nWe are all Africa. If I can say it, so can you.\n\nThe rain comes across the plain on legs like mine.\n\nWe are all Africa.\n\nTHE ELEMENTS\n\nYou drink me like water,\n\nLick me like salt,\n\nPlow me like earth,\n\nI make you grow.\n\nThe sun\n\nOn the mountain’s face\n\nBurns its cheek.\n\nThat mountain is not weak.\n\nAnd we are not so strong\n\nThe elements won’t change us.\n\nThere is a great force\n\nMoving through us\n\nToward connection.\n\nIn the quiet wood,\n\nThe mountain gathers height.\n\nThe climb is high and steep.\n\nThe sloping shoulder changes weather.\n\nOn the north of trees,\n\nSmall plants sink their pylons into bark.\n\nThe sky is dark,\n\nClouds gather above us and below.\n\nDon’t you know? love is an avalanche?\n\nAnd a mountain,\n\nAnd this,\n\nThe sudden snow.\n\nA FAR COUNTRY\n\nYou are a far country.\n\nWind is the native tongue.\n\nDistance is the custom.\n\nOut of touch is the rule of thumb.\n\nIt would take body English\n\nTo cross your borders successfully.\n\nThe natives all play dumb. In my country, there is tea,\n\nSandwiches, a softly played piano.\n\nPiano, piano, pianissimo.\n\nIn your country, there are drums.\n\nThe drums through the trees\n\nSound to my ear like thunder.\n\nYour body shudders with the\n\nSame drawn-out note.\n\nAll my niceties, the tastes I’ve acquired,\n\nGet mired down in the thick of\n\nyour tricky weather—\n\nOr slide away.\n\nI watch my tea cart skid across the floor.\n\nWhen I ask you, “More?” I do not mean\n\nAnything we drink from a china cup.\n\nAnd there is not enough.\n\nIn your country,\n\nDark is more visible than day;\n\nOnly fly by night can get it right\n\nFlying blind, over jungle,\n\nWith no place to land,\n\nYou reach from the open cockpit\n\nTo feel rain on your hand.\n\nTRUE NORTH\n\nI.\n\nAn attraction creates a geography,\n\nA territory of the heart\n\nWith boundaries, weather,\n\nDangers of the trail.\n\nA need for plots,\n\nCompasses, survival kits.\n\nYou are True North.\n\nII.\n\nI want to love you like a map,\n\nWith boundaries and possibilities.\n\nI want to love you like a compass,\n\nWith intention and direction.\n\nLike a knife, a gun,\n\nAn instinct toward protection.\n\nI want to love you like a rope,\n\nAs thick and strong as hope.\n\nTHIS EARTH\n\nThis earth is not made\n\nFor our misery.\n\nIt does not grow on trees\n\nLike the fruits.\n\nYou do not gather it like berries.\n\nIt is not a vegetable, a root,\n\nThe tall delicious grasses.\n\nIt does not swim in our sea or\n\nRoam the prairies.\n\nThe earth knows sorrow—\n\nFloods, famines, droughts\n\nThat scorch the earth to parchment so\n\nOur names blow away like dust.\n\nThe earth knows loss—\n\nSudden frost, a pestilence,\n\nInsects descending like dark\n\nBuzzing clouds to eat even our thoughts.\n\nThe treacherous snow,\n\nThe rains that fall too early\n\nOr too late. We can live with these.\n\nThe earth is practiced in these griefs.\n\nThey are natural, like the child who\n\nSlips away despite our love.\n\nThe earth can hold and soften all these sorrows.\n\nJust give her time. Time that turns her fields\n\nFrom green to brown.\n\nTime that curls the vine\n\nTo sweet tendrils,\n\nLike tiny hands.\n\nOur misery makes something else from time.\n\nThe ticking is not natural.\n\nOur bodies know the cost.\n\nFeel how they long to lay down amid the grasses.\n\nHear them sigh for a wind that carries\n\nCricket song and lark, a wind that sloughs and ripples\n\nLike a river.\n\nOur earth isn’t made from sound like that.\n\nTake off your shoes. Lay your cheek.\n\nTo this dark earth who longs to comfort you.\n\nThis earth is not made for our misery.\n\nWe are made miserable, longing for this earth.\n\nSTAG\n\nI saw a stag in the city.\n\nVelvet-horned,\n\nSweat-soaked,\n\nReeking musk and manure,\n\nAlone,\n\nAt dawn,\n\nHe made his way north.\n\nEvery cloven hoofprint\n\nA cleft promise in the snow.\n\nOh.\n\nHow I miss your animal breath,\n\nThe casual warmth of your body.\n\nI saw a stag in the city.\n\nBODY ENGLISH\n\nWe speak in tongues.\n\nMy mouth to your ear.\n\nYour ear to my mouth.\n\nWe speak in tongues.\n\nUse body English.\n\nMouth to mouth,\n\nHeart to heart.\n\nParts of speech.\n\nEach.\n\nOur every slip of the tongue is graceful.\n\nOur best syllables are silent.\n\nWe speak in tongues.\n\nOur skins make conversation.\n\nTalk to me.\n\nIT IS A SIMPLE THING\n\nI notice the small things—\n\nThe spider creeping beneath the door,\n\nThe leaf that takes the air,\n\nThe silver hair burning at your temple.\n\nIt is a simple thing.\n\nThe moments pass and we pass with them.\n\nTell me why, knowing we all die, I cannot bear to hear you catch your breath.\n\nTHE QUIET ANIMAL\n\nOh quiet animal, sleeping,\n\nWhat dreams lie within your cells?\n\nWhat ages brought you here\n\nThrough coal and ice?\n\nEye twitch, lip curl—\n\nBlood dreams again.\n\nBlood is always dreaming,\n\nScheming to move us forward\n\nAnd take us back,\n\nDreaming the dark places,\n\nCaves and the backs of stars.\n\nYour ivory bones are the tusks of time\n\nWho eats with all our mouths.\n\nThat crescent moon? It’s just a bone\n\nThrown beyond our reach.\n\nThe stars at night were someone’s baby teeth.\n\nThe blood remembers\n\nWhat the mind forgets.\n\nThe soul is a quiet animal.\n\nGiven less to thought than memory,\n\nMore to dreams than plan,\n\nThe soul owes more to half-remembered gods\n\nThan waking life as man.\n\nYOU CANNOT NAME ME\n\nYou cannot name me.\n\nYou do not know my name.\n\nI am not that small and foolish thing\n\nYou would have me be.\n\nYou cannot name me.\n\nI am an arrow shot through time.\n\nMy rhyme is not so narrow as your reason.\n\nDo not doubt.\n\nI will have my season.\n\nYou’d make me small.\n\nYou’d make me call you “Sir.”\n\nAs if I were some cur,\n\nMewling through the streets,\n\nWhipped and yellow.\n\nI am not that fellow\n\nYou would meet.\n\nThere’s a blindness in your eyes.\n\nYou cannot see my size.\n\nI am larger than your fears,\n\nDeeper than the tears God wept for ocean.\n\nWe are meant to do devotion out of love.\n\nThe hawk, the dove,\n\nThe black bear and her cub,\n\nThe oak, the ash,\n\nThe willow and the grass—\n\nEach has its song\n\nAnd you have got mine wrong\n\nTo name me as small.\n\nAnd if I wear your cell,\n\nI’ll burst it like a shell.\n\nI’ll be both large and small.\n\nI’ll name me after all.\n\nThe letters you don’t use—\n\nThose are what I choose.\n\nPINK IVORY\n\nI am pink ivory.\n\nOnly a king can claim me.\n\nAnd he— only once a year.\n\nAmong my ebony sister,\n\nI am pale as an English rose.\n\nIn the heart of their great darkness\n\nI am the light that grows.\n\nThe music that I make,\n\nThe shape I breathe to breath\n\nCan mean a sudden death\n\nTo careless men who fell me\n\nas they please.\n\nI am the queen of trees.\n\nI know my place.\n\nI know the man it takes.\n\nI am pink ivory\n\nOnly a king can claim me.\n\nOnly a king can name me.\n\nName me. Never tame me.\n\nI am pink ivory.\n\nAFRICAN KING\n\nI am an African king.\n\nMy music flows through your streets\n\nLike dark water amid the trees.\n\nPaler than ivory, my smile\n\nIs a sickle moon.\n\nYou own no room that\n\nIs large enough to hold me.\n\nA cat that moves through black,\n\nI am exactly that.\n\nMy sound disturbs the ground you think you’ve found.\n\nI am freer than I show.\n\nYou do not know me.\n\nI am an African king.\n\nMy ancestors slept beneath the moon.\n\nThey heard the drumming and the flood\n\nOf their own blood.\n\nThat blood’s in me.\n\nI am always free.\n\nA fire might gutter out\n\nBut not that moon\n\nAnd that moon knows my singing.\n\nThat moon hears me ringing\n\nThrough streets of steel and shadows made from stone.\n\nThe shape of tooth and claw,\n\nThat moon fills you with awe.\n\nI am an African king.\n\nIt sings me home.\n\nWHEN HE FOUND ME\n\nI was wandering in the desert\n\nWhen he found me.\n\nHe was a stranger.\n\nHe spoke a foreign tongue. He called my name and\n\nGave me water.\n\n“You thirst for your true nature,”\n\nHe said without speaking.\n\nMy heart sang like a plucked string.\n\nI was not imagining this thing.\n\nI am an ordinary man.\n\nMy life was simple as bread.\n\nWhen he turned his head away,\n\nI started weeping.\n\n“You are awake,” he said.\n\n“You have been sleeping.”\n\nThis was true,\n\nAnd so I followed him.\n\nWho knew he could turn water into wine?\n\nWho knew that trick with loaves and fishes?\n\nThe garden and the rock, the mother weeping—\n\nWho knew? He knew them all.\n\nIf you ask me, he answered as was called.\n\nI would not change a thing he led me to.\n\nMan or God he taught me—\n\nSimply do what you must do.\n\nI was wandering in the desert\n\nWhen he found me.\n\nHe was a stranger.\n\nHe spoke a foreign tongue.\n\nHe called my name and gave me water.\n\nWhat is there in this, that I should falter?\n\nLANTERN MOON\n\nThere is a lantern moon\n\nWhich rides the coast.\n\nIt is a moon which causes men\n\nTo remember.\n\nYou know this moon.\n\nYou have seen it from your bedroom window.\n\nIt has caught you walking, Stalking dreams before the dawn.\n\nThis is the moon\n\nThat knows your secret heart,\n\nThe moon that knows you\n\nBetter than a son.\n\nWhy are you hiding your dark face?\n\nThis moon is expert at that game.\n\nWhat do you gain by holding back your name?\n\nThis moon saw your birth.\n\nThis moon knows your worth.\n\nThis moon is silver gold\n\nJust like your soul.\n\nCOUNTRY OF CONTRADICTIONS\n\nI am a country of contradictions.\n\nI have a mountainous heart,\n\nFull of switchbacks and passes—\n\nFissures and crevasses—\n\nWhere the snow, this late in August,\n\nIs still frozen, so—\n\nI will not make predictions.\n\nThere are parts of me that may never thaw— or—\n\nAvalanches, flood,\n\nThis love is tricky.\n\nLike my blood.\n\nI am a country of contradictions.\n\nA sable slinks between the trees.\n\nA falcon takes the breeze.\n\nA tiny flower points up like a star.\n\nBelow there is a river.\n\nBelow there is a flow.\n\nBelow there is a verdant green\n\nThat grows from my deep snow.\n\nTHE DOORWAY\n\nI had been traveling a long time.\n\nEach face looked the same to me.\n\nThe mountain and the plain,\n\nThe sun and the rain—\n\nThey blurred together.\n\nI was my weather\n\nWhat I owned I carried on my back,\n\nA simple pack, weighty as a stone—\n\nI called that home.\n\nIt might have gone on like that forever—\n\nYou never know.\n\nIn crossing a great desert,\n\nYou cannot think about it, so\n\nI lived my life a footstep at a time.\n\nI saw ahead no further than the blind,\n\nAnd didn’t mind.\n\nThe village was small;\n\nThe mountains tall;\n\nThe air was thin and clear.\n\nI had no way of knowing she was near.\n\nThe street was steep;\n\nThe snow was deep;\n\nThe houses hunched like beggars.\n\nI didn’t look inside—\n\nAll of us have hungers.\n\nI heard a high-pitched screaming.\n\nI thought it was the wind.\n\nI heard a high-pitched screaming.\n\nIt screamed— and screamed again.\n\nThen I saw the doorway.\n\nThen I saw her face.\n\nI saw, like me, she’d traveled\n\nTo every far-off place.\n\nI saw that she was lonely.\n\nI saw she was alone.\n\nI saw her beckon to me.\n\nI saw I’d traveled home.\n\nWe tell this story laughing,\n\nWe turn it like a stone.\n\nShe says she wasn’t screaming—\n\nThat was me— alone.\n\nOne of us was screaming.\n\nOne of us, afraid.\n\nIt doesn’t make a difference,\n\nWith the difference it’s made.\n\nUNPREPARED\n\nI.\n\nI’m not prepared for this.\n\nI can’t pronounce this bliss.\n\nThe way we flow,\n\nThe knowing where to go.\n\nThis ebb and flow—\n\nCan’t we take it slow?\n\nWhere are the walls,\n\nThe shadows in the halls?\n\nThis light—\n\nCan it be right?\n\nWhere does it come from?\n\nI’ve known a different sun,\n\nWalked a different earth\n\nWhere air was used for grieving.\n\nI think— we’re leaving.\n\nII.\n\nBefore we met\n\nI knew your face\n\nFrom stars and stones.\n\nI knew your name\n\nFrom wind and grasses.\n\nBefore we met\n\nThe red earth held my heart,\n\nThe sky cradled my dreams,\n\nThe forest floor was my green bed.\n\nThese were what I wed\n\nBefore we met.\n\nNow that you are here\n\nI am wed to galaxies.\n\nOur sky does not contain me.\n\nOur sun is a candle to what I see.\n\nSheer as a cliff, the walls drop away.\n\nTHERE IS A MUSIC\n\nThere is a music.\n\nYou hear it in the blood.\n\nKeening like a mother,\n\nWhispering like a lover,\n\nMarching like a brother off to war.\n\nThere is a music.\n\nFlowing like a river,\n\nYou smell it on the air.\n\nIt is a trail for me,\n\nBetween those rocks,\n\nAlong the cliff edge,\n\nDown the slope.\n\nIt is a river that cartographers\n\nDon’t allow.\n\nThey’ll never show it.\n\nThere is a trail.\n\nI’ll leave notes.\n\nAFTER MAGELLAN\n\nI want to pretend that the earth\n\nIs not round.\n\nI want to pretend I don’t love you.\n\nLoving you has changed everything. ec\n\nI know that walking toward the horizon\n\nWill solve nothing.\n\nThere is no final edge,\n\nNo step I can take, last,\n\nTo reach an end.\n\nThe earth curves away from me.\n\nLeaning forward, reaching,\n\nIt meets me from behind.\n\nTouched, not touching,\n\nI am your lover.\n\nYou encircle me as surely\n\nAs this earth I walk away from.\n\nSURVIVAL\n\nI can imagine a life without you.\n\nA sky with no stars.\n\nA time before language.\n\nA primitive age\n\nWith values relating to survival.\n\nI can imagine a world without sound,\n\nIn which no bells ring, In which birds wing silent\n\nAcross skies muted by lack of sun.\n\nWhat I cannot imagine is my survival—\n\nStill living, still breathing,\n\nWhen it is air that I am missing.\n\nI am trying not to miss you.\n\nI am trying not to breathe.\n\nON A MAP OF AMERICA\n\nOn a map of America, I could draw a line between us.\n\nI could hang that line with lanterns.\n\nAt the mid-point, the rendezvous,\n\nThe lantern could be pink, not blue.\n\nFrom a distance, it would look like a single heart.\n\nMeet me there.\n\nMeet me at the spot where\n\nWe are not what we fear\n\nAnd never were except in years\n\nWhen we had no lanterns and no light.\n\nImagine: in our trust\n\nWe stand on the dust\n\nOf ashes and of diamonds.\n\nImagine: even in this darkness,\n\nI have got that right.\n\nBELIEVING IN KANSAS\n\nAt the hospital, they change the bandages\n\nIn shifts. Every morning, while the rain drips\n\nLike glucose. Later, while the sun slants\n\nThrough the blinds, like bamboo slits.\n\nIn the evening, too, when it fits.\n\nThey work quickly, tearing off soft strips of gauze.\n\nSnowy white and soft like the downy backs of moths.\n\nIn Kansas, at twilight, the moths come down like snow.\n\nIt’s different here. Their flight seems bumpy.\n\nI don’t know. I might be jumpy. It was crazy there.\n\nThey found me clutching the hand of a small child\n\nThey say I killed its mother, or perhaps another.\n\nThey found me shoeless. Without a foot.\n\nI’d stepped on a mine that should have killed me.\n\nIt was crazy there. I swear\n\nThey were all the enemy.\n\nI have asked for a different nurse,\n\nOne with healing hands.\n\nOne who understands\n\nThe miracle of crop growth,\n\nThe cycle of dormancy,\n\nThe promise of a wind-swept plain.\n\nI have asked for a nurse\n\nWho believes in Kansas,\n\nShe must see me walk,\n\nTwo-legged and whole,\n\nStriding through fields drowsy with grain.\n\nShe must believe, like Kansas,\n\nThere is always spring, always rain.\n\nDEEP MUSIC\n\nI am a deeper music\n\nThan your bells,\n\nHung by their throats\n\nIn some high steeple,\n\nTolling out the muffled notes\n\nOf monks.\n\nI am a music of canyon rock,\n\nOf valley, of city street,\n\nOf alley—\n\nYou hear my beat.\n\nYou walk it with your feet.\n\nAn infant’s cry,\n\nAn elder’s sigh—\n\nI am all of these.\n\nA panther in your streets,\n\nI take my ease.\n\nI’m you and all of these.\n\nThe red heart of this green earth,\n\nI am molten at the core—\n\nAnd I am more.\n\nI am a music shaped by ocean.\n\nMy depths hold icy fire,\n\nLike distant stars.\n\nMy sound is ours.\n\nWe are a music chorded by the wind.\n\nOur singing spans this planet\n\nLike silken ropes.\n\nHear you in me.\n\nWe are a unity.\n\nI am your dreams and hopes.\n\nI am your loss, your grieving.\n\nAll that you are leaving,\n\nAll that’s gone before and falls\n\nBehind. I am that wine\n\nDistilled from what you’ve been.\n\nI am the place that you begin\n\nWhat you’re becoming.\n\nI am the drumming,\n\nThat deep humming,\n\nThat summing up of parts\n\nThat makes us whole.\n\nI am your soul.\n\nBelieve me when I say\n\nI am deep music.\n\nHear me as I whistle\n\nThrough your veins.\n\nHear me as I lullaby\n\nYour pains.\n\nHear as I say,\n\nAnd say again,\n\nI am deep music.\n\nOnly choose it and my note\n\nBecomes your own.\n\nWe are one.\n\nWe are all what we have sung\n\nAnd are becoming.\n\nOpen up your throat\n\nAnd cast your vote.\n\nWe are deep music.\n\nWHY WE WRITE\n\nThere are many things which resist naming,\n\nAnd that is why we write.\n\nWe write because language is slippery,\n\nAnd truth is.\n\nWe write because\n\nThe light we have to see by\n\nIs always shifting.\n\nNever forget that writers are prophets.\n\nWe speak in tongues.\n\nWe testify.\n\nWe are for each other a believing mirror.\n\nOur words make us visible.\n\nOur listening makes us heard.\n\nNever forget that writers are soldiers.\n\nOur writing is the long march,\n\nThe walk into time.\n\nEach word is a drum.\n\nWe sound it across great distances,\n\nReaching one another and ourselves.\n\nEvery poem is a day’s march.\n\nA celebration more necessary than water or wine.\n\nEvery poem is a drink of blood.\n\nNever forget that writing is an act of courage—\n\nNot on the days when it is simple and we discount it.\n\nNot on the days when it is hard and we write like sand.\n\nOur words are torches.\n\nWe pass them hand to hand\n\nAnd mouth to mouth\n\nLike a burning kiss.\n\nNever forget to say thank you.\n\nEvery syllable is a grace.\n\nPOULTICE\n\nDon't tell me,\n\nDoctor.\n\nI know this is no way to poultice a soul.\n\nFor the better part of a year,\n\nI've been administering\n\nThese therapeutic doses of scotch and gin.\n\nThey've been my anesthetic.\n\nThe patent cure I chose\n\nAgainst your good advice.\n\nYou'd think that after all this time,\n\nI'd know how to cauterize a heart.\n\n\"Be nice\"?\n\nPerhaps I could\n\nBut the problem lies,\n\nAt least in part,\n\nWith all your gentle probing.\n\nI've found the familiar\n\nCurve of your skull\n\nScalpel enough\n\nTo open any wound.\n\nBLIND, DRUNK\n\nIs it any wonder that in the midst\n\nOf my most delicate transactions,\n\nI may suddenly find a twig\n\nStill caught in my hair,\n\nA spider secretly webbing over an ear lobe?\n\nYou had to be there.\n\nI guess\n\nYou had to know the dark and horror.\n\nYou had to know the way my fingers felt\n\nThe seams, the joints, the sealed doorway,\n\nThe cramped and filthy space:\n\nHome.\n\nSometimes, in the middle of a conversation,\n\nWalking on a sunny street,\n\nIn broad daylight,\n\nMy shadow will catch up to me.\n\nI will feel the chill and sweat,\n\nLike the slick cold flank of a bottle.\n\nMy hands will fly up,\n\nAs in surrender,\n\nOr prayer.\n\nThere, in a shop window,\n\nI will catch sight of myself,\n\nGibbering.\n\nPlucking at the unlucky twig\n\nThat reminds me of my luck,\n\nI brush aside my grave,\n\nConcerned that I look normal.\n\nIsn't it a wonder?\n\nLILACS\n\nWho knows what the lilacs\n\nCost the verdant earth?\n\nWho knows if their fragrance\n\nIs ever really worth\n\nThe loss of self containment,\n\nThe softening at core,\n\nThe quickening at center,\n\nThe wrenching to a thaw?\n\nWho knows if the winter earth,\n\nAccustomed to her chill,\n\nBurns as she awakens,\n\nWarms against her will?\n\nThe ancient scent of lilacs\n\nMoves modern men to weep.\n\nThe perfume of desire\n\nCalls green earth from her sleep.\n\nWORDS FOR IT\n\nI wish I could take language\n\nAnd fold it like cool, moist rags.\n\nI would lay words on your forehead.\n\nI would wrap words on your wrists.\n\n\"There, there,\" my words would say\n\nOr something better.\n\nI would ask them to murmur,\n\n\"Hush\" and \"Shh, shhh, it's all right.\"\n\nI would ask them to hold you all night.\n\nI wish I could take language\n\nAnd daub and soothe and cool\n\nWhere fever blisters and burns,\n\nWhere fever turns yourself against you.\n\nI wish I could take language\n\nAnd heal the words that were the wounds\n\nYou have no names for.\n\nACCIDENT\n\nYou have decided we are an accident.\n\nWho can blame you?\n\nAccidents happen\n\nAnd so did we.\n\nThe fact of an accident is often over-looked.\n\nWe focus on the surprise.\n\nWe focus on the fact\n\nIt should not have happened.\n\nDo you remember driving in New Mexico,\n\nOn the high road, near Penasco?\n\nWe made a hairpin turn, noting\n\nThe \"U\" of it, marked by a cross.\n\n\"This is where accidents happen,\"\n\nYou told me. You touched my knee.\n\nThe survivors of bad accidents\n\nTell good stories. I believe them.\n\nThey talk about tunnels, figures of light,\n\nA sudden warp in the time space continuum,\n\nThe temporary ability to float free from pain.\n\nThey say they watched themselves,\n\nspread-eagled,\n\nLimbs twisted at skew angles,\n\nmangled-- happy.\n\n\"I didn't feel a thing,\" they say\n\nWith wonder. \"I heard music.\"\n\nSo do I.\n\nBREAKING AND ENTERING\n\nMy heart is not a furnished room:\n\nTRANSIENTS WELCOME.\n\nI know too much about rooms like that.\n\nThe cracked window shade,\n\nThe single plant, the cat.\n\nThere is more to my heart than that.\n\nYou close one door to talk.\n\nYou open another and touch me.\n\nWe fit together like lock and key.\n\nI am your burglary,\n\nYour hideout.\n\nBut my heart is not that room\n\nIn the afternoon when the light is lovely.\n\nMy heart is morning.\n\nIt told me that all night.\n\nMy bed was empty except for dreams.\n\nIn my dreams, my heart\n\nIs not a furnished room.\n\nI do not need to change the lock.\n\nYou have the key.\n\nIn my dreams, you do not break me,\n\nEntering.\n\nA DELICIOUS POEM\n\nThe first time\n\nI kissed your mouth,\n\nI was surprised.\n\nYou tasted like strawberries,\n\nI missed your mouth.\n\nIT'S AMUSING\n\nI pay it money.\n\nGive it sex.\n\nI place bets for it.\n\nBuy it roses.\n\nAnd bananas.\n\nI tell it stories.\n\nSing it songs.\n\nIt treats me bad.\n\nMakes me mad.\n\nIt gives me poems.\n\nSUMMER\n\nSummer in this city is so hot\n\nSubways move in their tunnels\n\nLike blacksnakes.\n\nIn bed, we turn our bodies slowly,\n\nLike rotisseries.\n\nWINTER\n\nThe first time I saw\n\nPhotographs of Antarctica,\n\nI winced to see your face.\n\nThe most surprising things\n\nAre surprising.\n\nAny fool would have recognized\n\nThe glacial calm, the ice locked floe.\n\nThe cold facts are these:\n\nWarmed by your arms, I freeze.\n\nSLEEPTALKING\n\nWe talk in our sleep.\n\nOur silences fill with language.\n\nDreaming,\n\nI listen to the rustle of your thoughts.\n\nStirring like bed sheets,\n\nAs you turn over and over\n\nThe idea of us.\n\nWEEDING\n\nI admire the universe.\n\nThere is an economy to loss.\n\nThe earth is richer\n\nFor killing its flowers.\n\nThe domestic garden flourishes,\n\nRooting out its rank, luxurious\n\nWeeds, those outlaw tentacles of life\n\nThat grow by a cellular law,\n\nMentioning no fences, no orderly rows.\n\nA sudden death, in nature,\n\nIs kindest. Lightening doesn't rattle\n\nBefore it strikes.\n\nThe bolt of light,\n\nThe split of sky,\n\nThat moment when everything is clear\n\nAnd then gone;\n\nThat death is its own announcement.\n\nIn Nature's world,\n\nEvery loss has meaning.\n\nThe weeds,\n\nMisplaced by gardening hands\n\nBent on a topiary niceness,\n\nSend their tendrils through rock.\n\nBlooming, blasted by wind\n\nOn some unpromising promontory,\n\nThey are, after all: alive.\n\nOf all the weeds that gardeners don't allow,\n\nChickory is my favorite.\n\nYou may have seen its crosses,\n\nWind tossed strips of blue,\n\nBlue that is halfway silver, like tears.\n\nYanked up by its roots, chickory dies\n\nQuickly.\n\nSubborn as God's own seed,\n\nYou spot it later, standing by the roadside,\n\nAs if flagging a ride to some safe place.\n\nBIRTH-DAY\n\nMy skin is white and bloodless\n\nIn the hospital glare\n\nOf the bulb above my mirror.\n\nCatch me here,\n\nWebbed with capillaries,\n\nNetted by veins,\n\nI am sheathed by way of consolation,\n\nIn my own smooth skin.\n\nI'm quite an operation.\n\nAll afternoon\n\nI've been paring apples,\n\nPeeling back skin\n\nTo the skull of fruit,\n\nSlicing carefully,\n\nI've seen red mouths,\n\nLips quivering at the rush,\n\nEscaping faster than words\n\nBleed out.\n\nI am an emergency.\n\nSome severed artery,\n\nDangling obscenely like a loose wire,\n\nOozing current.\n\nPHANTOM\n\nThe soul has phantom limbs\n\nThat itch and burn.\n\nStumps of love,\n\nThey yearn for other lives.\n\nI drop my glove.\n\nYou bend to pick it up and I think,\n\nWhen? But cannot get my hands on it.\n\nSomething's missing.\n\nAnd then sometimes, kissing you,\n\nI get deja vu.\n\nThis lip, I think,\n\nThis hip that jostles hip?\n\nWe are too familiar.\n\nYou walk me to the door\n\nYou straighten out my collar, touch my neck.\n\nI suspect my heart is a shooting star.\n\nWe've come so far.\n\nRIB\n\nI felt so at home sleeping\n\nIn the crook of your arm,\n\nPressed against your rib cage,\n\nI called me your missing rib.\n\nI don't believe I lied.\n\nBut if pain is any gauge,\n\nFrom this aching in my side,\n\nI'd say I'm the one without a rib.\n\nA hollow bones my chest.\n\nMy cells somewhere are weeping.\n\nROSES\n\nThe roses on the breakfast table\n\nThreaten my equilibrium.\n\nI hold myself carefully,\n\nSlightly hung-over.\n\nI see you stubbed out your cigarette\n\nIn the pot for my geranium.\n\nI am ashamed. I did\n\nNothing to rescue her.\n\nMy lip is bruised and my neck.\n\nI should go to bed thinking it doesn't matter.\n\nBut I am all skin and\n\nMy smallest bones know better.\n\nLOVE\n\nThe lip of your body\n\nIs the rim of the known universe.\n\nThe space between the stars\n\nHolds your heartbeat.\n\nAt night, when the stars sleep,\n\nThey rest in that room of dark\n\nWhere sparks of life ignite.\n\nYou left the seeds of poetry\n\nInside me.\n\nLINES PIRATED FROM M.B.\n\nIn calling a ship from shore,\n\nYou need only know what ocean.\n\nThat, and the nearest land mass.\n\nIn other words, you calculate position\n\nIn the roughest terms.\n\nYou do not need to know\n\nThat phosphorus glows off starboard,\n\nOr hear the slap of the flying fish\n\nThat leaping blind lands,\n\nLike you, at your lover's feet.\n\nThe slap of salt spray,\n\nThe trail of foam\n\nLeading home\n\nThat fades away...\n\nDo not consider it.\n\nDo not pause to reckon\n\nThe possibility of connection\n\nOver time and distance and misdirection.\n\nSoon enough you will talk.\n\nSoon enough she will tell you\n\nHow it was that night\n\nWhen she dreamed of white sheets,\n\nSticky with starch,\n\nAnd the sudden arch of your body,\n\nEntering her dream.\n\nIn calling a ship from shore,\n\nKnow that we are all, equally, at sea.\n\nOur sullen planet, this lump of wet and granite,\n\nSails like a spitball in the face of God.\n\nDo not be awed.\n\nIn calling a ship from shore,\n\nIgnore the odds.\n\nMARK MY WORDS\n\nIn the end, she will have you.\n\nShe will hold you longer and better than I.\n\nHer taste will fill your mouth.\n\nYou will come into her\n\nLike a landscape dissolving into dark.\n\nI can see it.\n\nAll my angling, my plots, my pots and pans,\n\nMy plans for us, it's all diversion.\n\nShe's the one, not me.\n\nTrust her version.\n\nWe lie beneath our bedroom eaves\n\nAnd no one breathes.\n\nWe count like sheep the passing of our days.\n\nWe pretend and each believes,\n\nWe will stay together.\n\nIn that fine phrase: \"Forever.\"\n\nBut she will have you.\n\nThese days, your face is lined like paper.\n\nThe scrawl and scratch of time\n\nMakes it match mine.\n\nIn the photo on the bureau,\n\nYou were young and dapper.\n\nIn the photo, back at zero, we had time.\n\nOh, lovely hands beneath the flesh is bone.\n\nWe knuckle under.\n\nDeath, like far thunder,\n\nSpeckles the fair weather. Friend,\n\nAge is the cage she will catch you in.\n\nI reach to hold and what I reach is old.\n\nAnd so we lie. Harbored in our arms,\n\nWe hear the blow, attend the crack.\n\nSide by side, we count back\n\nBy what amount it missed us:\n\nChildish charms. She will have you.\n\nAnd when she strikes like lightening,\n\nShe will take you home alone.\n\nYou will lie in her bed;\n\nI'll lie in our own."
