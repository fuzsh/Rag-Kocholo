Exercise takes your mind to a different place and more often than not I would end a run with either an idea or at least a better perspective on a problem. What I love about Joe Wicks is how he is raising awareness of the link between mental and physical health and also reducing the barriers to getting started. As the saying goes 'the heaviest weight in the gym is the front door'. You don't need to go for a run to get the benefits of exercise. Increasingly I have enjoying walking and trying out walking meetings. It is amazing how a change of scene can change your mood and your outlook on a problem. And how the tone of a meeting changes when you are both walking vs stuck in a meeting room.\n\n\"If we step back to look at what each partner is actually seeking, it is generally validation, a deeper understanding of what they are thinking, feeling, and why.\" üíò This is an excerpt from Octave's article (by clinician Cathryn Waters) on emotional connection with your partner. üîé Connection means paying attention. üíì Paying attention gives meaning to life, work, and relationships. ‚û° When you take time to understand what someone is seeking, it is usually validation and a deeper exploration of the topic at hand. ‚ù£ When it comes to writing, imagining what your audience is thinking, feeling, and why, is one way to foster connection. üí° The best kind of articles and content: inform, guide, and support the reader. ‚û° They make you consider new ideas from old ways of being, or consider old ideas in a new way. ‚û° They incorporate up-to-date or fascinating research to support claims. ‚û° They add value to your life. ‚úí As a clinical nurse writer specializing in many things, including LGBTQIA+ health, telehealth, pediatrics, nutrition, holistic health, and mental health; I love writing content that connects. üíù Thanks for this reminder on what it all really boils down to (in relationships, work, and life) this Valentine's Day: connection. #holistichealth #mentalhealth #connection #copywriting #clinicalwriting #wellness #telehealth #editor #nursewriter\n\nHumorous State of Mind: Procession Life with Laughter!
