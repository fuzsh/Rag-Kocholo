        "text": "Julia Cameron has had a remarkable careerÂ—and one which has in turn given remarkable help to others. Herself an award-winning poet, playwright, and filmmaker, she has written twenty-four books, ranging from her widely-praised, hard-hitting crime novel The Dark Room to her volumes of children's poems and prayers. Despite her extensive film and theatre credits, which include such diverse work as \"Miami Vice\" and the prize-winning romantic comedy \"God's Will\" which she both wrote and directed, Cameron is best known for her hugely successful works on creativity. The Artist's Way has sold over two million copies worldwide, her follow-up bestsellers The Vein of Gold, Walking in this World and The Right to Write are likewise flagship books which are taught in universities, churches, human potential centers and even in tiny clusters in the jungles of Panama.\n\nCredited with having founded a new human potential movement which has enabled millions to realize their creative dreams, Cameron eschews the title \"creativity expert,\" preferring to describe herself simply as an \"artist.\" \"Artists have always mentored, I just do it on a wider scale.\"\n\n\"My books are not creative theory,\" she explains. \"They spring straight out of my own creative practice. In a sense, I am the floor sample of my own tool kit. When we are unblocked we can have remarkable and diverse adventures.\"\n\nShe knows whereof she speaks. A writer since the age of eighteen, Cameron has published highly praised short stories, award-winning essays and hard-hitting political journalism. Her credits range from Rolling Stone to The New York Times. As a teacher she has taught everywhere from The Smithsonian to Esalen, The New York Times to Northwestern University where she served as writer in residence in film."
