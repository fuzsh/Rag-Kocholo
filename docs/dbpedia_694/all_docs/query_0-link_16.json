        "text": "Julia Margaret Cameron\n\nI wanted to share two poems one written by Julia Margaret Cameron and one by her husband Charles Hay Cameron along with two translations of 'Lenore' for this World Poetry Day.\n\nOn a Portrait\n\nOh, mystery of Beauty! who can tell\n\nThy mighty influence? who can best descry\n\nHow secret, swift, and subtle is the spell\n\nWherein the music of thy voice doth lie?\n\nHere we have eyes so full of fervent love,\n\nThat but for lids behind which sorrow’s touch\n\nDoth press and linger, one could almost prove\n\nThat Earth had loved her favourite over much.\n\nA mouth where silence seems to gather strength\n\nFrom lips so gently closed, that almost say,\n\n“Ask not my story, lest you hear at length\n\nOf sorrows where sweet hope has lost its way.”\n\nAnd yet the head is borne so proudly high,\n\nThe soft round cheek, so splendid in its bloom,\n\nTrue courage rises thro’ the brilliant eye,\n\nAnd great resolve comes flashing thro’ the gloom.\n\nOh, noble painter! more than genius goes\n\nTo search the key-note of those melodies,\n\nTo find the depths of all those tragic woes,\n\nTune thy song right and paint rare harmonies.\n\nGenius and love have each fulfilled their part,\n\nAnd both unite with force and equal grace,\n\nWhilst all that we love best in classic art\n\nIs stamped for ever on the immortal face.\n\nJulia Margaret Cameron\n\nSeptember, 1875\n\n(Julia’s poem was printed in the February 1876 edition of Macmillan Magazine)\n\nCharles Hay Cameron by Julia Margaret Cameron\n\nHer husband Charles Hay Cameron, wrote a goodbye poem to his Freshwater friends that was included in one of his surviving letters when he and his wife decided to leave for London:\n\nThe English Channel famed in war\n\nThe Solent sea and winding Yar\n\nHave cut an islet, yet not quite\n\nAn islet from the Isle of Wight,\n\nFor ‘twixt the Channel famed in war\n\nAnd silent sources of the Yar,\n\nDry land the twentieth of a mile\n\nUnites it to the parent isle.\n\nThere dwell, I fronting Afton Down,\n\nWith little Yarmouth for my nearest town,\n\nThe little Yarmouth where the Yar\n\nThough hindered by its gathering bar\n\nAfter four miles of winding reach\n\nAt length divides the yellow beach,\n\nAnd meets in Solent’s brine the rills\n\nThat southward flow from Hampshire’s hills.\n\nMaclise's Illustrations of Leonora, one of two 1847 editions\n\nDaniel Maclise, R.A. by Maull & Polyblank\n\nalbumen carte-de-visite, mid 1860s\n\nIn 1847, Julia Margaret Cameron published an illustrated book, ‘Leonora’ translated from German into English. It is based upon a German ballad or poem by Gottfried Burger in 1775. It was a favorite of hers. She asked her friend Daniel Maclise, painter at the time, to illustrate it and he complied. Partaking in the translation process was John Herschel a mathematician and astronomer as well as good friend of hers. He went through the translations with her along with the help of his two daughters who also spoke German.\n\nIntroductory page of Leonora translated by Julia Margaret Cameron\n\nillustrated by Daniel Maclise, R.A.\n\nLondon, 1847 edition\n\nThe story of ‘Leonora’ is a sad one. William, who is engaged to Leonore, has not returned from the Seven Years’ War yet. He had gone to battle in the army of King Frederick. She misses him terribly and longs for his return. She never receives any news or word from him. When the other men return from war without William, she gets very angry with God. This angers her mother saying it is blasphemous to say such things to God and have such feelings. She believes her daughter will be condemned to hell for it. Leonore’s mother tells her that William is probably still in Hungary and she should just forget him. When a stranger (who looks very much like William) appears at the door late one night asking for Lenore, she gets on horseback with him and rides away to his home to marry him. They are riding so fast, she asks him why and he says, “the dead travel fast.” She replies, “leave the dead alone.” They arrive at the doors of a cemetery as the horse begins to walk through the tombstones. She watches the knight begin to lose his human appearance and she realizes he is the image of Death. He is a skeleton carrying a scythe and an hourglass. William’s skeleton lies next to his grave and shattered armour. The ground beneath Lenore’s feet start to give way while spirits dance around her, “no one is to quarrel with God in Heaven.”\n\nIt seems that ‘Leonore’ was published three years prior in June of 1844 by a young man named Gabriel Charles Rossetti. Hm, could it be good ole’ Rossetti himself? Well, according to his younger brother, William Michael Rossetti it is the one and the same!\n\nNow known as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, he translated Burger’s ballad around June 1844. He wrote it at the age of sixteen in May of that year. He was studying German at the time with Dr. Adolf Heimann, of University College in London who later became a family friend. He never kept up the language nor was he satisfied with his poorly translated version of ‘Lenore’.\n\nA translator ought to be faithful, but is not bound down to being literal; he is compelled to make various mutual concessions between meaning and rhythm or rhyme; and in especial he must not turn a good poem into a bad one. (The Early Italian Poets by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1861)\n\nA young Rossetti fell in love with Burger’s original ‘Lenore’ romanticizing the sad love story. Not wanting his version to be too overly religious or sad, he downplayed the sadness making it more romantic in tone. He changed the then Protestant religious aspects of the poem into Roman Catholic ones softening the hardened stanzas. He played up the picturesque words and turned his version of ‘Lenore’ into a romantic painting depicted with words.\n\n“My mother, what is happiness?\n\nMy mother, what is Hell?\n\nWith William is my happiness,—\n\nWithout him is my Hell!\n\nSpark of my life! down, down to the tomb:\n\nDie away in the night, die away in the gloom!\n\nEarth and Heaven, and Heaven and earth,\n\nReft of William are nothing worth.”\n\nThus grief racked and tore the breast of Lenore,\n\nAnd was busy at her brain;\n\nThus rose her cry to the Power on high,\n\nTo question and arraign:\n\nWringing her hands and beating her breast,—\n\nTossing and rocking without any rest;—\n\nTill from her light veil the moon shone\n\nthro',\n\nAnd the stars leapt out on the dark-\n\n-ling blue.\n\nIf you would like to read Julia Margaret Cameron's, Leonora and see all of Daniel Maclise's beautiful illustrations\n\nIf you would like to read Dante Gabriel Rossetti's Lenore it is on Rossetti Archive"
