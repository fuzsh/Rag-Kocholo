        "text": "By Martha Kransdorf\n\nIn the first week of May, Israeli-American human rights activist Rabbi Arik Ascherman returned to Ann Arbor on a speaking and fundraising tour. My co-pilot, Harvey Somers, and I were the anchor people for his visit here. We’d like to first of all thank AARC for their support and to thank all of the co-sponsors for the May 2 JCC Fundraising Dinner and Community Forum: Beth Israel’s Social Action Committee, Jewish Cultural Society, Pardes Hannah, & Temple Beth Emeth. In addition to Rabbi Ora, rabbis from each of the other congregations were present, and took part in the evening’s program.\n\nRabbi Ascherman was the head of Rabbis for Human Rights for 21 years, and last fall he founded a new organization, Torat Tzedek, Torah of Justice. At the Community Forum, he described some of the current issues that he is working on, and the list is long and quite moving. His work ranges from meeting with lawyers and interviewing people who have been threatened by settlers, to lobbying at the Knesset on behalf of poor Israelis, to helping Arab shepherds hold onto their flocks when settlers frighten them and scare them away. Torat Tzedek has also been involved helping African refugees fight the Israeli government’s efforts to deport them and helping Bedouin communities hold on to their way of life.\n\nRabbi Ascherman’s courage and commitment have not wavered. He won’t throw in the towel. He admits that he is somewhat less optimistic than he has been in the past, but his response is to roll up his sleeves and work harder. He urges us, similarly, to react with urgency by becoming more active.\n\nIn addition to speaking at the JCC, Rabbi Ascherman spoke at Shir Tikvah in Troy, and he led text studies at Lunch & Learn programs at TBE and at Kehillat Israel in Lansing. His visit wrapped up with an “Open House” at BIC. A busy week, by any account. We are grateful to our communities in Michigan, which contributed over $4000 to Torat Tzedek. If anyone would like more information on Rabbi Ascherman’s work or on Torat Tzedek, please feel free to get in touch with either of us.\n\nMartha Kransdorf , mkransdo@umich.edu 734-663-7933\n\nHarvey Somers, harveysomers@gmail.com 734-780-6907\n\nRabbi Ascherman blogs regularly in The Times of Israel. On April 19 2018 he included this “Misheberakh — A Loving Prayer of Healing for the State and People of Israel”\n\nThe Hebrew is followed by a transliteration, and then a translation.\n\nמי שברך קדמונינו אברהם ושרה, יצחק ורבקה, יעקב לאה ורחל, הוא יברך וירפא את החולים, מדינת ישראל ועם ישראל. הקדוש ברוך הוא ימלא רחמים עלינו להחלימנו ולרפואתנו מכל מחלה המקשה עלינו להגשים את הטוב ואת השאיפות לצדק שבליבנו – ביניהן: העיוורון לנוכחותך בכל אדם והעיוורון למציאות; החירשות לקול הדממה הדקה בתוך רעש הפחד וההפחדה, קולות הענות והמלחמה במחנה; והפקודות; האטימות לסבל של האחר/ת; הרשימו שנשאר מכל מה שסבלנו אנו, השיכרון מכוח ומשלטון; השנאה לחושב/ת אחרת מאתנו; והאהבה היתרה לארץ ישראל ולמדינת ישראל ולעם ישראל ולכל דבר קדוש המסנוור אותנו לקדושתך ולרצונך. אנא, החזק בנו את היצר הטוב והחיות את אמונתנו בעולם מתוקן במלכותך וביכולתנו לקרבו. שלח לנו במהרה רפואה שלמה, רפואת הנפש ורפואת הגוף, בתוך שאר החולים/ות, השתא בעגלא ובזמן קרים, ונאמר אמן.\n\nMi sh’beirakh kadmoneinu Avraham v’Sarah, Yitzhak v’Rivkah, Ya’akov, Leah v’Rakhek, hu yivarekh v’yirapeih et ha’kholim, Medinat Yisrael v’Am Yisrael.

May the Holy One of Blessing be full of mercy and us to heal us from every illness that keeps us from fulfilling the good and the aspiration for justice that is within us – Among them: Blindness to Your Presence in every human being and blindness to reality; deafness to the Still Small Voice within the thundering fear and fearmongering, the sounds of war and singing in the camp, and orders; hatred of those who think differently than us, disproportional love for the Land of Israel, the State of Israel, the People of Israel and every holy thing that blinds us to Your Holiness and Your Will. Please strengthen within us our good inclination and revive our faith in the possibility of a repaired world under Your Sovereignty and our ability to bring that world closer to reality. Send us complete and speedy healing of body and soul, along with all who are ill, speedily and in our day. And let us say, Amen.\n\nThis year, AARC will be celebrating Mimouna on Saturday April 7, 5:30-7:30pm at the JCC. We’ll have lots of food, music, and a short ‘seder’ to learn about the symbols and traditions of Mimouna. We will also begin a conversation about things our congregation can do to form relationships with other faith communities in the coming year.\n\nMimouna, the traditional Moroccan Jewish celebration held the day after Passover, marks the start of spring and the return to eating chametz, i.e., leavened bread and bread by-products, which are forbidden throughout Passover. In centuries past, Muslim neighbors would bring gifts of flour, honey, milk, butter and green beans to their Jewish neighbors to help them prepare delicious, chametz-rich recipes. More recently, Moroccan Jews brought the holiday to Israel where it is now widely celebrated with picnics and visiting with friends and neighbors. Recently, an organization of Moroccan Muslim students was founded which preserves and promotes the history of Morocco’s ancient Jewish community and seeks to educate about Jewish culture to encourage harmony between Jews and Muslims.\n\n“Unlike Passover, which is charged with religious meaning, this is a festival devoted to the celebration of community, friendship, togetherness and hospitality. Mimouna is celebrated by throwing one’s home open to friends, neighbors and even strangers, with public parties, and by sharing – a large portion of that sharing involving food. Mimouna is thus clearly all about encouraging peace, kindness and human warmth. It also centers around making music, singing and dancing,” explains an article in Haaretz which includes a recipe for the traditional crepe, mofleta.\n\nThe piyyut (ligurgical poetry) below, “Atem Yotzei Maarav ,”composed by Rabbi David Bouzaglo (1903-1975), to commemorate the Mimouna holiday tells–in Hebrew with some Judeo-Arabic interspersed–the various aspects of the holiday including the foods eaten, the friendly atmosphere, and the significance of the holiday. It tells a story of strife and its resolution, and in conclusion calls for the abandonment of bitterness between Muslims and Jews.\n\nAtem Yotzei Maarav\n\nA Moroccan Jewish Piyyut:\n\nYou, who come from the Maghreb, from Morocco, men of faith –\n\npraise G-d in assembly, this day of the Mimouna.\n\nYesterday the Red Sea opened its gaping mouth before Pharaoh,\n\nit moved over all their wagons and swallowed them.\n\nIsrael, the flock, his servants crossed through passages,\n\nas the waves of the sea were piled up by the hand of Moses, the faithful father.\n\nThe wealth of their enemies and tormentors Israel collected,\n\nbetween the waves of the sea, they received it as a gift.\n\nOn every doorstep, all congratulated each other:\n\n“Be blessed, friend, all the months of the year.”\n\nAnd in Morocco, for many generations, the Hebrews say,\n\nin blessing their friends, “good luck, brother, good fortune!”\n\nThe strangers, their waters were spilled on them;\n\nthe fear of G-d, in Heaven poured down on them.\n\nLoads and loads of wealth and grains\n\nwere delivered from all comers of the world to the people G-d has chosen.\n\nAnd it is the way of the sons of Arabia, in Morocco,\n\neach according to his means brings the Jews an offering of value.\n\nYeast, honey and flour, the milk of a healthy cow,\n\nfish, mint, and butter with wild flowers and flowers from the garden.\n\nThis night, Hebrews and Arabs are all seated together –\n\nthey rejoice with musical instruments and singing.\n\nThe Hebrew woman wears the clothes of an Arab,\n\nthe man wears an Arab vest, and the scent of incense and perfume.\n\nOne can no longer distinguish between a Hebrew and his Arab brother,\n\nor if they are city dwellers or villagers: the good spirit overtakes them all.\n\nThe borders between Israel and the nations are blurred\n\nIf it wasn’t for the bloodthirsty who run the states.\n\nIt is these evil kings who deliver their people to catastrophe –\n\nThey are concerned only with their thrones, not the soul who suffers.\n\nAbandon for all time conflict and bitterness!\n\nStop the bitter cries! Stop in the name of peace and freedom!\n\n(Translation – Ruben Namdar and Joshua Levitt)\n\nYesterday, the last day of Hanukkah 5778, Rabbi Marc Gopin posted on Facebook some words of deep wisdom:\n\n“It was very hard to let go of the light this year. Light in darkness feels deeply resonant now, and difficult to resist a sense of foreboding.\n\nSometimes when you have been caught vulnerable by thieves and criminals, especially when they disguise themselves to beguile the foolish, and sometimes in order to avoid bloodshed, you need to let them steal their trillions. Sometimes you need to learn a harsh lesson, and then build a better security system, a better community of safety and mutual protection, a better community of fair law for all.\n\nThis is the only antidote, this inescapable need to reconcile and build trust among the decent rich and poor, the decent women and men, the decent secular and religious. We can do this. Even when it’s darkest outside, there is the amazing light we conjure.”\n\nHanukkah is always close to the Winter Solstice, but also independent from it. In a reflection on Hanukkah and the Winter Solstice, Rabbi Arthur Waskow wrote in Seasons of Our Joy:\n\nIf we see Hanukkah as intentionally, not accidentally, placed at the moment of the darkest sun and darkest moon, then one aspect of the candles seems to be an assertion of our hope for renewed light. Just as at Sukkot we poured the water in order to remind God to pour out rain, perhaps one reason for us to light the candles is to remind God to renew the sun and moon. Indeed, the miracle of eight days’ light from one day’s oil sounds like an echo of the Mishnah’s comment that at the Sukkot water pouring, one log (measure) of water was enough for eight days’ pouring.\n\nOn her website “tel shemesh: celebrating and creating earth-based traditions in Judaism,” Rabbi Jill Hammer tells us “There are a number of Jewish stories about the winter solstice. Here are some of the legends Jews can tell one another during the darkest days of winter…” You can read more of her Rabbi Hammer’s teaching on Hanukkah and Winter Solstice here.\n\nAnd finally, Marcia Falk includes the poem “Winter Solstice” as part of her amidah sequence where it appears in the second-section which re-creates the traditional theme of g’vurot, “strength,” affirming God’s power as m’hayeyh meytim, “reviver of the dead.”‘ For her full discussion of this concept in her creative prayers, see the wonderful book Jewish American Poetry: Poems, Commentary and Reflections. I highly recommend we each have in households her The Book of Blessings: New Jewish Prayers for Daily Life, the Sabbath, and the New Moon Festival (CCAR Press, 2017). Copyright © 1996, 2017 by Marcia Lee Falk. Also, I found on her website that she has done mizrachs (decorative plaques hung on the eastern wall of the home) with her poems and original paintings. Check them out: beautiful gifts for yourself and others.\n\nThe Unetaneh Tokef prayer is unique to the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur liturgy. The first line is variously translated as ‘We shall ascribe holiness to this day” and “Let us speak of the awesomeness.” The poem contains the imagery of the book of life opening on Rosh Hashanah, and being sealed on Yom Kippur. A translation of the poem can be found in this blog post by Rabbi Reuven Hammer.\n\nFor our Rosh Hashanah service this year, Deb Kraus wrote this powerful introduction to the Unetaneh Tokef.\n\nFrom last high holy days to today, how many African American people have died by police fire?\n\nFor smoking an e-cigarette, like Alfredo Olango\n\nFor reaching for a gun, like Che Taylor\n\nFor just having a gun, like Michael Moore and Nicholas Robertson and Corey Jones.\n\nOr for refusing to drop a gun, like Sahlah Ridgeway and Sylville Smith\n\nFor waiting for his son’s schoolbus to arrive, like Keith Lamont Scott.\n\nFor having his car stall out, like Terence Crutcher\n\nFor speeding, like Moses Rubin and Doll Pierre-Louis\n\nFor riding a motorcycle, like Terrence Sterling\n\nFor stealing a car, like Paul O’Neal\n\nOr for stealing an officer’s car, like Paterson Brown, Jr.\n\nFor running away from the cops, like Dalvin Hollins and Deravis Caine Rogers and Jabril Robinson and Rodney Watts and Akiel Denkins and Calin Roquemore and Ricky Ball and Jessica Williams and Miguel Espinal and Donte Taylor and 13 year old Tyre King.\n\nOr for approaching the cops, like Christopher Goodlow and Javario Eagle\n\nFor shooting himself in his own wheelchair, like Jeremy McDole.\n\nFor being schizophrenic, bipolar, suicidal or mentally impaired in some other way, like James Anderson and Janet Wilson and Joseph Mann and Jawari Porter and Kevin Matthews and Carlumandarlo Zaramo and Tyler Gebhard.\n\nFor trying to help a neighbor, like Bettie Jones\n\nFor faking a prescription, like Keith McLeod\n\nFor selling CDs outside a convenience store, like Alton Sterling\n\nFor damaging a traffic sign, like Peter Gaines\n\nAnd for road rage, like Delrawn Small and Clarence Howard.\n\nFor “refusing to cooperate” like Cameron Glover and Gregory Frazier and Nathaniel Pickett and Darnell Wicker, who, BTW, was probably deaf…\n\nOR For doing everything the police said, like Philando Castile\n\nFor sitting in his bedroom looking threatening, like Levonia Riggins\n\nOr trying to protect her five year old child in her own home, like Korryn Gaines.\n\nFor looking like someone else, like Colby Friday and Donnell Thompson, Jr.\n\nFor engaging in “suspicious activity,” like Dazion Flenaugh and David Joseph, and Greg Gunn\n\nFor fighting back, like Kevin Hicks and Junior Prosper\n\nFor turning around too quickly, like Antronie Scott\n\nFor panicking, like all the people above, Blue AND Black…\n\nAlthough, a sign I saw Saturday summed it up:\n\n“We live in a world where trained cops can panic and act on impulse but untrained civilians must remain calm with a gun in their face.”\n\nNotice race was not mentioned in that last quote. I’ll say it again:\n\n“We live in a world where trained cops can panic and act on impulse but untrained civilians must remain calm with a gun in their face.”\n\nI know that none of these situations are as straightforward as I have presented it.\n\nBut this year, as we pray the Unetaneh Tokef, let us really try to comprehend the myriad ways those who have pledged to serve and protect can instead cause people to die by fire, just because of the color of their skin.\n\n–Deb Kraus\n\nFor a long reflection on Unetaneh Tokef, written by Rabbi Toba Spitzer, for Rosh Hashanah 5762 (Sept. 18, 2001), please go here.\n\nReported by Martha Kransdorf and Sallygeorge Wright\n\n“Community in Difficult Times,” was a Jewish community-wide facilitated discussion hosted by the Jewish Community Center (JCC) on Thursday evening June 30th. The purpose for the meeting, according to convener Karla Goldman (director, UM Jewish Communal Leadership Program), “was to create a space where people come together in community to be able to process recent events. The catalyst was the Pulse tragedy in Orlando, which just seemed to combine so many different elements of the recent news: hate crime, hate speech, LGBTQ issues, immigration issues, gun violence and gun control, anti-Muslim rhetoric and terrorism issues in ways that cried out for response and yet no one has seemed to know how to respond.” About 65 people attended, taking advantage of this important opportunity to reflect about the tragedy in Orlando and the ongoing issues in this year’s election campaign.\n\nGoldman, JCC President Prue Rosenthal, and Hillel Director Tilly Shames, got things started. They reviewed the meeting’s background and guidelines for the small discussions at each table. Rabbi Kim Blumenthal helped establish the mood for the evening by leading us in “Hinei Ma Tov.”\n\nWe were reminded that each table had a facilitator, and needed to choose a note taker. We were to respect different opinions, and each person’s privacy. Individual’s remarks were not to be repeated afterward without permission from the person who made them. And we could say “ouch” if something offended us. There were three guiding questions for us to consider:\n\n1) What brought you here?\n\n2) What’s in your heart and on your mind?\n\n3) Is there something about this moment that calls upon us as Jews and as a Jewish community?\n\nReport backs noted the need for education and outreach on issues including guns, mental health, and more. The need for concrete measures to show solidarity with LGBTQ and Hispanic populations were pointed out. Examples included having social activities that would increase awareness of diversity in the community. People suggested an ad in a newspaper to express our outrage and concern about current developments, and publicity for efforts on gun control. Final remarks focused on further get-togethers to look at where we might go from here.\n\nThe invitation to the meeting was issued by almost every part of the organized Jewish Community in Ann Arbor: the Jewish Community Center of Greater Ann Arbor, the Jewish Communal Leadership Program, U of M’s Hillel, Jewish Federation of Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor Reconstructionist Congregation, Beth Israel Congregation, Temple Beth Emeth, Jewish Cultural Society, Hebrew Day School, Jewish Family Services of Washtenaw County, and the Orthodox Minyan. According to AARC member Sallygeorge Wright, the meeting was an important opportunity for people who had never met before, who were involved in different community groups, to find out what each other are already doing and to exchange ideas. Goldman summed up the outcome, “People at the event were happy that there was a way to come together as Jews for issues that were not centered on Jews but which mattered to us as Jews nevertheless.”\n\nRabbi Sara Adler closed the meeting with a beautiful Prayer for Peace that she had written. This prayer will be published in the forthcoming book, Not By Might, a publication by Rabbis Against Gun Violence and edited by Rabbi Menachem Creditor.\n\nPrayer for Peace God of our mothers and fathers, God of tenderness, God of lovers, teachers and children, may we see the day when love conquers fear when compassion overrides judgment and the echo of gunshot is heard no more. Let a great peace wrap its arms around our country, and hold us tight. Unite us-- people of all races, religions, orientations and identities in a bond of true fellowship. Teach us to respect difference and take pride in one another. Let us learn that diversity makes us stronger, that the healthiest forests are filled with a multitude of species and birdsong. God on High, let us find consolation and comfort under Your canopy of peace. May the memories of those assaulted by violence inspire us to mend our broken world. Let us grind guns into garden tools, bend our weapons into bridges. May we learn war no more. Come, let us write a new covenant of kindness an end to the flood of tears. Seal this promise in the sky, a rainbow to part the clouds.\n\nRabbi Sara O’Donnell Adler is a chaplain at UM Health System. She was ordained by The Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1999 and received her\n\nClinical Pastoral Education at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA. Prior to joining the staff of UMHS in 2008, Rabbi Sara worked as one of the rabbis with the\n\nMetroWest Jewish Health and Healing Center in West Orange, NJ.\n\nIt started last evening. I was watching (on facebook) the first “livestream” kabbalat shabbat service from Congregation Beit Simchat Torah (CBST), one of the oldest and largest LGBTQ synagogues in the world. The just-ordained (from the Reconstructionist seminary) Rabbi Marisa Elana James, who had interned at CBST, was introduced and congratulated. Rabbi James chose, in this gay pride week, and the first shabbat after the Orlando massacre of 49 at a gay dance club during Latinx night, to read a poem written by Adrienne Rich. Since I was sitting at the computer, I could quickly search on “Adrienne Rich” and the two words I remembered from the poem: “unleavened bread.” Ahh, yes, of course, from Sources (1983), which I could pull off my bookshelf:\n\nfrom Sources XV\n\nIt’s an oldfashioned, an outrageous thing To believe one has a “destiny” — a thought often peculiar to those who possess privilege— but there is something else: the faith of those despised and endangered that they are not merely the sum of damages done to them: have kept beyond violence the knowledge arranged in patterns like kente-cloth unexpected as in batik recurrent as bitter herbs and unleavened bread of being a connective link in a long, continuous way of ordering hunger, weather, death, desire and the nearness of chaos.\n\nMy google search led, of course, to other poems. One which I felt I should immediately post to facebook because it spoke so directly to this moment:\n\nWhat Kind of Times Are These\n\nBY ADRIENNE RICH\n\nThere's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted who disappeared into those shadows. I've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled this isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, our country moving closer to its own truth and dread, its own ways of making people disappear. I won't tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods meeting the unmarked strip of light— ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise: I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear. And I won't tell you where it is, so why do I tell you anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these to have you listen at all, it's necessary to talk about trees.\n\nfrom Dark Fields of the Republic: Poems 1991-1995 (W. W. Norton and Company Inc., 1995) and also published in The Fact of a Doorframe: Selected Poems 1950-2001 (2002).\n\nThis led me to thinking about another of Adrienne’s poems…but I couldn’t remember the title. All I could remember last night was a poem that mentioned Ethel Rosenberg, a window, a barn and had been published in the early 1990s when I worked with Adrienne on the journal Bridges. My google search turned up a poem I knew it wasn’t (because it was published earlier, in 1981). But somehow, this too, was meaningful: I was reminded that tomorrow, June 19, 2016 , is the 63rd anniversary of the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Adrienne wrote this 1981 poem, “For Ethel Rosenberg,” remembering that the date in 1953 of their execution was a week before her marriage. After you read this post, take a moment and watch/listen to Adrienne read this poem.\n\nStill searching for the window, the barn, I came across another of Adrienne’s poems, not the one I was looking for, but at this moment, right. North American Time, written in 1983, was published in 1986 in Your Native Land, Your Life, the final stanza reads:\n\nIX In North America time stumbles on without moving, only releasing a certain North American pain. Julia de Burgos wrote: That my grandfather was a slave is my grief; had he been a master that would have been my shame. A poet's words, hung over a door in North America, in the year nineteen-eighty-three. The almost-full moon rises timeless speaking of change out of the Bronx, the Harlem River the drowned towns of the Quabbin the pilfered burial mounds the toxic swamps, the testing-grounds and I start to speak again.\n\n1983\n\nIn this youtube of Adrienne reading the poem, she tells us that Julia de Burgos was a Puerto Rican poet who died on the streets of New York in 1953. A little research and I find she died in early July, just weeks after the Rosenberg execution. I’m reminded that the Jewish Puerto Rican poet Aurora Levins Morales wrote on facebook this week:\n\n“Hardly anyone is talking about the fact that at least 23 of the people who died at the Pulse were Puerto Rican. That Central Florida is receiving 1000 Puerto Ricans a week fleeing from the disaster colonialism has wrought on us. That these beloved, mostly young people were not only targeted by homophobia. The man who killed them was a regular at that bar and he chose Latinx night. I will not stand for the racist aspect of this hate crime being whitewashed away. This was my familia. They were all doubly my cousins. Yes, everybody reach out to queer communities. Yes, everybody reach out to Muslim communities. But reach out to Latinx and specifically Puerto Rican communities, too. They were our children.”\n\nYou can find more of Julia de Burgos’ poetry in this bilingual edition. All of these connections across generations, places. I had to get them all down in one place. Thus this blog. I finally found the poem that sent me on this journey. It was hard to find online, but published in Dark Fields of the Republic: Poems 1991-1995, which I have on my bookshelf (I tell you this because I am happy to lend books):\n\nRevolution in Permanence\n\n(1953, 1993)\n\nThrough a barn window, three-quartered the profile of Ethel Rosenberg stares down past a shattered apple-orchard into speechless firs. Speechless this evening. Last night the whole countryside thrashed in lowgrade fever under low swollen clouds the mist advanced and the wind tore into one thing then another --you could think random but you know the patterns are there— a sick time, and the human body feeling it, a loss of pressure, an agitation without purpose . . . Purpose? Do you believe all agitation has an outcome like revolt, like Bread and Freedom? —or do you hang on to the picture of the State as a human body —some people being heads or hearts and others only hands or guts or legs? But she—how did she end up here in this of all places? What she is seeing I cannot see, what I see has her shape. There’s an old scythe propped in an upper window of the barn— —does it call up marches of peasants? what is it with you and this barn? And, no, it’s not an old scythe, it’s an old rag, you see how it twitches. And Ethel Rosenberg? I’ve worried about her through the liquid window in that damp place. I’ve thought she was coughing, like me, but her profile stayed still watching what held her in that position.\n\n1993\n\nFinally, as I go to post this, I find out that on Monday June 20th, 2016, two days from now, The New Yorker magazine will publish a review of Rich’s just out Collected Poems 1950-2012 (WW Norton, June 2016). If only I’d had the new collection when I started writing this, I wouldn’t have had to spend the night searching google.\n\nMy friend, the Israeli writer Rachel Tzvia Back, sent me a link this week to two of her recent poems published on World Literature Today. These poems are from her new collection, entitled What Use Is Poetry, the Poet Is Asking. I will be among the first to order it. Rachel lives in the Galilee where her great-great-great-grandfather settled in the 1830s. Though I’d published her poems and other writing in Bridges: A Jewish Feminist Journal for two decades, I only met Rachel in September 2014 when she came to Ann Arbor to give talks on a collection of her translations from Hebrew to English, In the Illuminated Dark: Selected Poems of Tuvia Ruebner.\n\nI’m thinking of Rachel during this week of Yom Hazikaron (Israeli Memorial Day) and Yom Haatzmaut (Israel Independence Day). From an essay of hers on Israeli poetry, here is a translation of an untitled poem by Lea Goldberg (1911-1970), from Rachel’s collection of translations of Goldberg:\n\nAnd will they ever come, days of forgiveness and grace,\n\nwhen you’ll walk in the fields, simple wanderer,\n\nand your bare soles will be caressed by the clover,\n\nor wheat-stubble will sting your feet, and its sting will be sweet?\n\nOr the rainfall will catch you, the downpour pounding\n\non your shoulders, your breast, your neck, your head.\n\nAnd you’ll walk in the wet fields, quiet widening within\n\nlike light on the cloud’s rim.\n\nAnd you’ll breathe in the scent of the furrow, full and calm,\n\nand you’ll see the sun in the rain-pool’s golden mirror,\n\nand all things are simple and alive, and you may touch them,\n\nyou are allowed, you are allowed to love.\n\nYou’ll walk in the field. Alone, unscorched by the blaze\n\nof the fires, along roads stiffened with blood and terror.\n\nAnd true to your heart you’ll be humble and softened,\n\nas one of the grass, as one of humankind.\n\nI read this poem as a celebration of Israel’s independence.\n\nAs I was writing this post, I came across another of Rachel’s writings, an opinion piece in the Forward from August 2015, “For Each Day of the Gaza War, These Jewish Women are Fasting.” In it Rachel says, “For many of us, last summer’s war was the breaking point — our first experience of having a son in combat, of sitting hours and hours by the news, hearing reports of each new horror, the names of the boys who would not return from the front, the numbers of unnamed Gazan civilians killed.” And yet, now, she has a new collection of poetry. Of hope. Today, on Yom Haatzmaut, I hope you will join me in celebrating Rachel Tzvia Back."
