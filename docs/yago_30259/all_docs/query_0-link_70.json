        "text": "On 1 May 2019, there was a surprise announcement from the Thai royal court – Suthida Tidjai was officially announced as King Vajiralongkorn’s wife.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn of Thailand had been married and divorced three times before. In 1977, when he was still the Crown Prince, he married his first cousin, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, and they had one daughter together before divorcing in 1993. In the meantime, he had fathered five children with Sujarinee Vivacharawongse and married her in 1994, legitimising their children. This marriage ended in divorce as well, and Sujarinee Vivacharawongse later fled to the United States with their children. Only their daughter returned to Thailand and has retained her royal titles. In 2001, he married Srirasmi Suwadee, and they had one son together before divorcing in 2014.\n\nVajiralongkorn succeeded his father as King of Thailand upon his death on 13 October 2016. However, his coronation was postponed until 4 May 2019, which left plenty of time to find a new Queen.\n\nSuthida Tidjai was born on 3 June 1978, the daughter of Kham Tidjai and Jangheang Tidjai. She graduated from Hatyaiwittayalai Somboonkulkanya Middle School and Assumption University with a bachelor’s degree in communication arts in 2000. She was a flight attendant with JALways from 2000 and 2003 and with Thai Airways International between 2003 and 2008.\n\nIn 2014, she was appointed commander of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn’s household guard, but she may have known the Crown Prince as early as 2010. Over the years, she received several promotions and attended military training courses.\n\nSuthida, also known by her nickname of “Nui”, became a well-known face in the Crown Prince’s entourage. Nevertheless, the announcement of her becoming Queen came as a surprise.\n\nDuring a ceremony on 1 May 2019, Suthida prostrated herself in front of the King and presented him with the traditional gifts associated with royal power. They later signed the marriage documents as some of the royal family looked on.\n\nJust three days later, Suthida joined her new husband at his coronation."
