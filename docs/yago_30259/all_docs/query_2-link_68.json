        "text": "Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has paid homage to his ancestors - including his late father and the former monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej - as part of preparations for his elaborate coronation ceremonies this weekend.\n\nHe was accompanied by his new wife Queen Suthida, a former Thai Airways flight attendant, who made her first official public appearance since the announcement of their surprise marriage ceremony on Wednesday.\n\nThe newly weds knelt beside one another on Thursday as they paid their respects to statues of previous Chakri dynasty monarchs in Bangkok's historic quarter.\n\nIt comes as part of the King's highly-anticipated coronation - which is set to take place from Saturday to Monday and will be the first since Vajiralongkorn's late father's nearly 70 years ago.\n\nThe 66-year-old royal - also known by the title of King Rama X - became a constitutional monarch after the death of his revered father in October 2016.\n\nPhotos released on Wednesday showed the Queen lying on the floor as she was given a gift by the King during the marriage ceremony.\n\nShe 'legally married' her husband in accordance with royal traditions, an announcement in the Royal Gazette said, with a statement from the royal family explaining that the King had decided to promote General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Aydhaya, his royal consort, to become Queen Suthida'.\n\nAccording to CNN, the statement added that the King's long-term consort 'will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family'.\n\nIt was also explained that the monarch had 'performed a royal wedding ceremony with General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Aydhaya in accordance to law and royal traditions in a full and righteous manner', which explains why the bride had to lay at her husband's feet.\n\nThai royal traditions dictate that the ruling king is to be regarded as god-like and semi-divine, and as a result, he must sit higher than everyone else, to the point that, during official ceremonies and speeches, his feet should be elevated above everyone else's heads.\n\nDuring the ceremony, once the royal couple is seated, the bride is able to sit alongside her husband - as Queen Suthida is shown doing in images from the wedding.\n\nHowever others taking part in the wedding must continue to lay before the King, as one member of the royal court is seen doing while the queen signed her marriage license.\n\nLong seen trailing the King in public events as part of his personal security retinue, Suthida was given the rank of 'general' in 2017.\n\nThe unpredictable royal is due to be crowned the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty in an elaborate three-day ceremony starting Saturday.\n\nVajiralongkorn, who has been married three times, has spent much of his time in Germany.\n\nHarsh lese-majeste laws have shielded public scrutiny of his colourful private life, and all media in Thailand must self-censor.\n\nThis weekend's coronation will be the first since Vajiralongkorn's late father's nearly 70 years ago.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what role Queen Suthida will play in the ceremony.\n\nThailand's new king is well known for his eccentricity.\n\nIn 2016, he was spotted wearing a tight, white crop top, his body adorned with temporary tattoos and holding a white fluffy poodle, while standing next to his consort.\n\nA father-of-seven, he has three failed marriages, a love of fast jets and a reputation for having an explosive temper.\n\nDuring an attempted coup in Thailand in 2014, a film was published online of his third wife dressed in nothing but a black G-string while she sang happy birthday to the royal couple's beloved pet poodle, Fufu.\n\nIn 2009, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra spoke of his doubts about the then-Prince's suitability for the role of king.\n\nIn 2007, footage published online showed the king throwing a party for his pet poodle - who held the rank of Air Chief Marshall - at the Royal Palace in Bangkok.\n\nPrincess Srirasmi, who sang happy birthday to the dog topless, also got on her knees and ate from a dog bowl in the same video.\n\nThe relationship between the King and his new Queen has been compared to the famous musical The King and I.\n\nThe play follows strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher Anna Leonowens, who arrives in Bangkok at the request of the King of Siam to tutor his children.\n\nRomantic feelings later blossom between the King and tutor."
