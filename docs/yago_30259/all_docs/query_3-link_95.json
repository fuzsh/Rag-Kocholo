        "text": "KING Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded to the throne of Thailand in December last year - 50 days after his father died.\n\nThe 64-year-old is known for his bizarre and ostentatious lifestyle - but let's find out a little more about the Thai monarch.\n\nWho is King Maha Vajiralongkorn?\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn was born in 1952 and was the only son of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit's four children.\n\nAfter completing primary school at the Dusit Palace in Bangkok, Thailand, he was sent to Britain for his education.\n\nThe then prince studied at King's Mead School in Seaford, Sussex, before being send to Millfield School in Somerset.\n\nHe finished secondary education in 1970 and attended a five-week military training course before being enrolled at the Royal Military College in Canberra, Australia.\n\nHe was proclaimed crown prince of the Chakri Dynasty in December 1972.\n\nAs is traditional for royals, he was ordained as a monk when he as 26 and stayed at a major Buddhist temple in Bangkok for 15 days.\n\nMaha graduated as a newly commissioned lieutenant with a liberal arts degree in 1976 and in 1982 obtained a second bachelor's degree.\n\nHe served in the Royal Thai Army and is a qualified helicopter pilot.\n\nHis military role in recent years has become increasingly ceremonial.\n\nMaha has been married three times and has seven children.\n\nHis first wife Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara was his first cousin on his mother's side and they had one daughter.\n\nHis second wife Mom Sujarinee, an aspiring actress, decamped to Britain two years after their marriage with their five children.\n\nMaha put posters around the palace accusing her of adultery and later abducted their daughter and brought her back to Thailand.\n\nSujarinee and her sons were stripped of their titles and diplomatic passports and moved to the United States.\n\nMaha married for a third time in 2001 to a commoner - Srirasmi Suwadee - who was elevated to rank of princess after giving birth to their son 12 years ago.\n\nThey divorced in 2014 and her family was stripped of their royal name, while she received 200 million baht (Â£4million) as a settlement.\n\nWhen was Vajiralongkorn crowned?\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej died on October 13, 2016, and Maha was expected to succeed to the throne immediately.\n\nBut he asked for time to mourn his 88-year-old father, who had held the throne for 70 years.\n\nOn December 1, 2016, Maha was invited to ascend the throne as the tenth king of the Chakri dynasty - 50 days after his father's death.\n\nWhy is the Thai monarch threatening to sue Facebook?\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn has threatened to sue Facebook after footage apparently showing him strolling around in a crop top emerged.\n\nThe man, said to be the king, can be seen walking through a shopping centre with his top rolled up - boldly revealing his heavily-tattooed body.\n\nThailand says the clip, which has gone viral, needs to be removed and internet chiefs in the country are reported to have emailed Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg personally asking him to remove it.\n\nIt is not the first time the monarch has been spotted in such attire.\n\nIn October he was snapped at a Munich airport wearing a rolled-up tank top, sagging jeans and fake tattoos with a poodle in tow.\n\nAnd here are more of his maddest moments.\n\nWhat other bizarre behaviour has the King apparently shown?\n\nVajiralongkorn once declared his favourite pet, a poodle named Foo Foo, an air marshal.\n\nHe even took the pooch to a 2007 reception hosted in his honour by US Ambassador Ralph âSkipâ Boyce.\n\nâFoo Foo was . . . dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts, and at one point during the bandâs second number, he jumped up onto the head table and began lapping from the guestsâ water glasses,â Boyce wrote, according to a WikiLeaks document.\n\nâThe Air Chief Marshalâs antics . . . remains the talk of the town to this day.â\n\nTales of the princeâs behaviour exist mostly in the realm of rumour in Thailand. The nation has strict laws banning stories about the royal family.\n\nBut in 2007, the depravity of Vajiralongkornâs court was exposed when a video surfaced of his third wife, Princess Srirasmi, a former bar waitress, walking around topless at her own birthday party while eating cake with Foo Foo.\n\nWhen the dog died last year, it was given a four-day funeral."
