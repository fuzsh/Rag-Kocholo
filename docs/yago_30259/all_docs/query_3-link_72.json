        "text": "Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has commented about the state of unrest in his country at a recent event at the royal palace, the first time the 68-year-old has spoken with foreign media since he was Crown Prince in 1979.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn, who returned home from Germany in early October, was questioned by CNN about pro-democracy protests that have been happening daily.\n\nHe initially said \"no comment\" but then said of the protesters: \"We love them all the same. We love them all the same. We love them all the same.\"\n\nWhen asked about demands his power be curbed, he said: \"Thailand is the land of compromise.\"\n\nKing Maha recently returned to Thailand after a stay in Germany during which he was accused of breaching a ban stating he could not conduct business during his stay in the country.\n\nRELATED: Thai king 'breaks isolation to attend a party' in Bangkok\n\nSunday's event was a religious ceremony to mark the change of season at the Grand Palace and was attended by the royal family and supporters of the king who dressed in yellow.\n\nSupporters gathered at the palace to greet King Maha, Queen Suthida and the King's daughter Princess Sirivannavari.\n\nThe Princess also spoke with foreign media at the event, telling CNN: \"We love the Thai people, no matter what.\"\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne in 2016 following the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and has become better known more for his lavish lifestyle and complicated love life than as an effective ruler.\n\nWhen he was still Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn the Thai married for the first time on January 3, 1977. He wed Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, his first cousin on his mother's side. The couple had one daughter - Princess Bajrakitiyabha.\n\nSoon after his daughter's birth, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn began living with actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth. They had five children, and were unable to wed when Princess Soamsawali refused to agree to a divorce.\n\nVajiralongkorn was able to sue for divorce in the Family Court in January 1993. During the proceedings he accused his then-wife of being at fault for the failed relationship and she was unable to refute the charges due to Thailand law which forbids criticism of the royal family.\n\nPrincess Soamsawali and her daughter continue to participate in royal ceremonies.\n\nThe couple were married but separated in 1996.\n\nOn February 10, 2001, Vajiralongkorn married for a third time, this time to Srirasmi Suwadee who had been in his service since 1992. The marriage was not revealed to the public until early 2005. This too ended in divorce.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn married Suthida Tidjai, former acting commander of Royal Thai Aide-de-Camp Department, on May 1, 2019. Two months later, the king bestowed the title of \"chao Khun Phra\" or Royal Noble consort to Major General Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, making the first official naming of a secondary consort for nearly a century.\n\nProtesters face a 15-year prison sentence for protesting against the King but despite the risk, the student-led protests have been happening daily. They are protesting against the king's wealth and power in the face of a shrinking economy and the impact of this on Thailand's population.\n\nThey are calling for a true democracy by way of reform of the monarchy, military and wealthy political elites.\n\nDozens of protesters have been arrested under an emergency decree imposed shortly after the King's arrival in Thailand."
