        "text": "THAI King Maha Vajiralongkorn has married his long-term consort and given her the title Queen Suthida - just days before his coronation.\n\nOfficial photos show Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya, a former Thai Airways flight attendant, laying on the floor as she was given a gift by the king during the ceremony.\n\nThe surprise announcement was carried in the Royal Gazette and footage from Wednesday's wedding ceremony was later shown on the nightly Royal News segment aired on all Thai television channels.\n\nVajiralongkorn, 66, also known by the title King Rama X, became constitutional monarch after the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in October 2016, after 70 years on the throne.\n\nHe is due to be officially crowned in elaborate Buddhist and Brahmin ceremonies on Saturday, followed by a procession through Bangkok the next day.\n\nIn 2014, Vajiralongkorn appointed Suthida Tidjai, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, as a deputy commander of his bodyguard unit.\n\nCROPTOP SHOCK\n\nSome royal observers and foreign media had linked Suthida romantically with the king, but the palace had previously never acknowledged a relationship between them.\n\nThe king made Suthida a full general in the Royal Thai Army in December 2016, and the deputy commander of the king's personal guard in 2017.\n\nHe also made her a Thanpuying, a royal title meaning Lady during the lavish ceremony.\n\nHowever, the king's pristine ceremonial outfit was a far cry from the outrageous croptop and low-slung jeans he was once spotted wearing while wandering around a German shopping centre.\n\nThe monarch even threatened to sue Facebook over the startling shots, taken in 2016 by a passer-by who recognised the king.\n\nThe images, which appeared to show Maha out for a stroll with a girlfriend while wearing fake tattoo “sleeves”, fall foul of Thailand’s extremely strict law of “lese-majeste” — or insulting royalty.\n\nBut the king’s bizarre dress sense is just the tip of the iceberg for this clearly very different monarch.\n\nIndeed, his string of failed marriages and apparently insatiable appetite for women - his own mother Queen Sirikit branded him a womaniser - has had Thais quietly gossiping for years.\n\nDuring a 1982 trip to the US, Sirikit said: “My son, the Crown Prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan.\n\n\"He is a good student, a good boy, but women find him interesting and he finds women even more interesting.”\n\nMaha has ruled Thailand since the death last year of his father who was married to Sirikit for 66 of those years.\n\nFOUR WIVES\n\nBut in stark contrast to his father, Brit-educated Maha has already divorced three times - and is now on his FOURTH wife.\n\nIn 1977 he married his first wife — his cousin, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara.\n\nThey had a daughter, Bajrakitiyabha, but the relationship was doomed from the start.\n\nDuring the marriage Maha fathered four sons and a daughter with his mistress, actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth.\n\nThey began living together but his wife refused to divorce him.\n\nFinally, in 1993, he sued for divorce, laying the blame for the failed relationship entirely at Soamsawali’s feet.\n\nHe married Yuvadhida the following year but after a mysterious bust-up two years later, she fled to the UK to escape her husband.\n\nLivid Maha ordered posters to be placed all around his palace accusing her of adultery with a 60-year-old Thai air marshal.\n\nSECRET MARRIAGE\n\nThe prince then had his daughter brought back to Thailand. His four sons say they were banned from returning by their father.\n\nIn a letter written in 2011 they said: “We were ordered by our father not to return home to Thailand. We were afraid to risk even demonstrating the slightest inference of disrespect toward the Royal Family.”\n\nIn 2001 the king married his third wife — former waitress Srirasmi Suwadee, who had been in his service since 1992.\n\nHe kept the marriage secret from the public until 2005, when she gave birth to their son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti.\n\nMaha even told a magazine it was his intention to settle down.\n\nThe pair bought a poodle, Foo Foo, which Maha became devoted to in a way that even the most ardent dog lover would find extreme.\n\nBARKING ORDERS\n\nHe made it an Air Chief Marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force and the dog appeared at official functions dressed in a dinner jacket.\n\nIn 2007 Foo Foo was a guest at a reception held by the US Ambassador Ralph Boyce.\n\nIn a leaked document, Mr Boyce said: “Foo Foo was present at the event, dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts.\n\n“At one point during the band’s second number, he jumped up on to the head table and began lapping from the guests’ water glasses, including my own.\n\n“The Air Chief Marshal’s antics drew the full attention of the 600-plus audience members, and remains the talk of the town to this day.”\n\nFoo Foo hit the headlines once again when a video from its birthday party surfaced online.\n\nIt appears to show topless Srirasmi lying on the floor in just a G-string, feeding cake to the dog.\n\nShe sings Happy Birthday to it before getting on her hands and knees and eating from the same bowl as Foo Foo.\n\nWhen the dog died in 2015 Maha gave it a four-day funeral complete with Buddhist rites before it was cremated in a lavish ceremony.\n\nA year earlier he divorced Srirasmi, stripped her royal titles and exiled her to an undisclosed location in Thailand — with a reported settlement of £4.5m.\n\nHe then jailed her parents for two-and-a-half years for “royal defamation”.\n\nSoon afterwards he hooked-up with his latest wife Vajiralongkorn - who is nicknamed Nui.\n\nAmong the dignitaries at their wedding were Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the military junta that has run Thailand since a 2014 army coup.\n\nWhile the king took the throne after the death of his father, his formal coronation follows a mourning period for King Bhumibol, whose royal cremation was held a year after his death."
