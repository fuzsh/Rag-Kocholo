        "text": "After a spell at the Royal Military College in Duntroon, Canberra, Australia and some further education he was made crown prince on December 28, 1972.\n\nThere ensued a riotous life marked out by womanising as noted by his own mother Queen Sirikit on a trip to the US in 1982: “My son the crown prince is a little bit of a Don Juan.\n\n\"He is a good student, a good boy but women find him interesting and he finds women even more interesting. If the people of Thailand do not approve of the behaviour of my son, then he would either have to change his behaviour or resign from the royal family.”\n\nIf that was meant as a stark warning, it didn’t work. Maha’s first wife was his cousin Soamsawali Kitiyakara.\n\nThey married in January 1977 and had a daughter two years later but it wasn’t long before he was looking elsewhere.\n\nNine months after the birth of his first child, a second – a son – appeared. The mother was actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth with whom Maha went on to have five children , finally marrying her in 1994.\n\nHowever, they had a massive bust-up just two years later. Amid claims that she had had an affair with an air marshal, Yuvadhida fled to Britain with her children.\n\nMaha abducted their daughter and brought her back to Thailand where she became a princess but her mother and four brothers were stripped of their titles and now live in the US.\n\n“We were ordered by our father not to return home to Thailand,” the four men said in a letter in 2011.\n\n“We were afraid to risk even demonstrating the slightest inference of disrespect toward the royal family.”\n\nWife number three was Srirasmi Suwadee whom Maha married in 2001 and was subsequently described by her husband as a “modest and patient” person who “never says bad things towards anyone ”.\n\nShe was a former waitress and the marriage was kept secret until 2005 when she was elevated to “princess” and Maha declared he was ready to settle down.\n\nTwo years later the pair were seen throwing a party for their poodle Foo Foo, the air chief marshal , in which Srirasmi clad only in a G-string was seen eating from the same bowl as the dog.\n\nTheir devotion to their military mutt and the birth of their son Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti was not enough to keep them together, however, and they split among allegations of corruption in her family.\n\nMaha jailed her parents for two and a half years. Foo Foo also made quite an impression on everyone he met, including US ambassador Ralph Boyce.\n\nHe once divulged: “Foo Foo was present at the event [a diplomatic reception] dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts. At one point he jumped up on to the head table and began lapping from the guests’ water glasses including my own.\n\n\"The air chief marshal’s antics drew the full attention of the 600-plus audience members and remains the talk of the town to this day.”\n\nWhen Foo Foo died in 2015 he had a four-day Buddhist funeral.\n\nUnlike his father the current king is not popular among his people but any hint of dissent is firmly stamped upon. The woman accompanying him in the Facebook video is not his latest “official” girlfriend, air hostess Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudaya, 41, nicknamed Nui, whom he has made a general.\n\nShe is a nurse called Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, with whom he is said to have become close.\n\nMaha spends a lot of time in his villa outside Munich, speeding around in his white Porsche 911 Turbo.\n\nWill Sineenat become wife number four? In this stranger than fiction tale anything goes."
