        "text": "He's a royal with a £24billion fortune at his fingertips, 20 mistresses and a life of unimaginable luxury.\n\nSo when Thailand's ruler, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, went into lockdown it was always going to be a very different experience to most people's self-isolation.\n\nThe royal, also known as also known as Rama X - has self-isolated in a hotel in Germany with 20 of his girlfriends.\n\nThe 67-year-old is said to have moved his entire harem of concubines into the high end Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Bavaria after he was given permission by authorities.\n\nBavaria is under lockdown, like the rest of Germany, and the hotel should be closed down along with all the others but it was apparently been given \"special permission\" to remain open for the king and his bizarre court.\n\nIt is not known if the king's FOUR wives have been among the group.\n\nBut it seems that life in lockdown has become somewhat boring for the controversial king, reportedly fled the confines of his luxury Bavarian hotel to attend a party 12,000 miles away.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn was apparently seen in Zurich, Switzerland, on his whirlwind trip out of lockdown.\n\nWhile he was there he picked up his latest wife, Queen Suthida, who has chosen the European country as her self-isolation lockdown location.\n\nThe couple then flew back to their homeland of Thailand to celebrate Chakra Day, which is a national annual holiday.\n\nOnce the bash was over, the royals were back on a jet the following day.\n\nAfter dropping his wife off in Switzerland, the king then hopped on a Thai air force Eurocopter UH-72A to Germany before being picked up in a van with blacked out windows and chauffeured back to his hotel.\n\nIt's far from the first time King Vajiralongkorn has attracted controversy in Thailand, where it is banned from criticising the royal family, or even their pets.\n\nHowever, he is such a divisive figure that the royal is still criticised in his home country, albeit in private due to the threat of 35 years in prison.\n\nAs the oldest monarch to ascend to Thailand's throne, King Vajiralongkorn, has been married four times and has a colourful private life.\n\nSaid to be worth £24billion the royal has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, from his marriages, to his mistresses and even a leaked video of the queen naked apart from a G-string.\n\nBack in November 2009 a home video of the king and his third wife, Srirasmi Suwadee, was leaked.\n\nIn the video, which was filmed at the birthday party of the king's pet poodle, the queen was wearing nothing but a G-string while servants waited on her hand and foot.\n\nHarry Nicolaides, an Australian, was jailed for three years in 2009 after he published a book which contained the sentence \"if the prince fell in love with one of his minor wives and she betrayed him, she and her family would disappear with their name, familial lineage and all vestiges of their existence expunged forever\".\n\nNicolaides was later pardoned by the king and he said his book had been \"entirely fiction from cover to cover\".\n\nTwo years later, one of Vajiralongkorn's royal planes was seized by German authorities as payment for a £27million debt owed to a German firm, which was in danger of becoming bankrupt.\n\nVajiralongkorn finally agreed to pay £18million, which was then covered by the Thai government.\n\nThe king married his first wife, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, in 1977 and the couple welcomed their daughter, Princess Najrakitiyabha.\n\nBut this was not a happy union and Vajiralongkorn embarked on an affair with actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth, with whom he had five children.\n\nDespite repeated requests, Princess Soamsawali refused to divorce her husband until he finally got his wish in 1993, claiming the fault of the marriage's failure lay squarely at his wife's door.\n\nEven so, his first wife and their daughter continue to play a major part in royal events.\n\nVajiralongkorn, still a prince, then married the woman he had been having an affair with for more than 15 years - but their wedding was not blessed by the queen, his mother.\n\nIt was not the wedded bliss he had hoped for and just two years after they tied the knot Yuvadhida moved to Britain with all of the couple's children - and the prince did not react well.\n\nFurious, Vajiralongkorn put posters up all around the palace, accusing his wife of adultery and eventually abducted his daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him.\n\nShe was later elevated to the rank of princess, but his wife and their sons were stripped of their royal titles and they all now live in the US.\n\nHis third wife was Srirasmi Suwadee, who had worked for the prince since 1992. The marriage was kept from the public for four years, and revealed disclosed in 2005.\n\nSrirasmi gave birth to the couple's son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, in the same year and was made a princess by her husband, who vowed his wild days were behind him.\n\nBut nine years later Vajiralongkorn demanded his wife's family be stripped of their royal titles amid allegations of corruption among her relatives.\n\nHis wife relinquished her royal titles soon afterwards and agreed to a divorce after 13 years of marriage when she was awarded a £4.4million settlement.\n\nJust three days before he was crowned king, Vajiralongkorn married his fourth wife, Suthida Tidjai, who was a former acting commander of Royal Thai Aide-de-Camp Department.\n\nHowever, despite once again being a married man Vajiralongkorn was still not faithful and just months after his wedding he gave his concubine Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi the title of Chao Khun Phra, which means royal noble consort.\n\nThe 34-year-old had become the first royal consort in Thailand for almost a century in almost 25 years and meant she was an official companion to the king but not the queen.\n\nJust three months later, the king stripped her of her new position, fortune, title and rank, claiming she had been disrespectful to the queen and disloyal to him.\n\nAn official statement said: \"The royal consort's behaviours were considered disrespectful,\" showing \"disobedience against the king and the queen\" and abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf.\n\nThe king, the statement said, had learned \"she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status\".\n\nWho knows what the future will bring for the 20 women currently back in self-isolation with the king of Thailand after their trip home to party."
