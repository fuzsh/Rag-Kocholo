        "text": "Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn paid his respects to his country's sacred Emerald Buddha and lit a candle at exactly 4.19pm today on the eve of his three-day coronation.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is also known by the title of King Rama X, was joined by his wife Queen Suthida for the ceremony which saw 80 monks chant as he lit the candle at the 'propitious' time, decided by astrologists.\n\nToday's preparations also saw a golden plaque bearing his official name and title moved from the Temple of the Emerald Buddha to the Grand Palace in a beautiful ceremony.\n\nIncredible photographs show royal guards in brightly-coloured uniforms marching along as senior officials transferred the plaque as well as the king's horoscope and royal seal.\n\nThe three items, which were made in a three-hour ritual last week, will be presented to the king on Saturday by the chief Brahmin, along with five royal regalia, the symbols of kingship in Thailand.\n\nTomorrow's coronation will be the first the country has seen in 69 years, since his father, the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, was crowned in 1950.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, became a constitutional monarch after the death of his revered father in October 2016, after 70 years on the throne.\n\nAhead of the grand ceremonies, the king said he would grant royal pardons to some prisoners to 'give them a chance to become good citizens', according to the Royal Gazette.\n\nThe document, which will take effect on Saturday, listed many criteria for prisoners who are eligible for the pardon, including those with disabilities, chronic or terminal diseases, or those with one year left to serve.\n\nThe king will also reduce sentences for some prisoners, including those imprisoned for life, and commute inmates' death sentences to life.\n\nIt is not yet clear how many people will qualify for the pardons.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn married his long-term consort Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya in accordance with royal traditions, an announcement in the Royal Gazette said yesterday.\n\nQueen Suthida, as she will now be known, is a former Thai Airways flight attendant and was previously given the rank of 'general' in 2017 after serving as part of his personal security retinue.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Suthida was pictured lying at her husband's feet as he handed her a gift. Thai royal traditions dictate that the ruling king is to be regarded as god-like and semi-divine, and as a result, he must sit higher than everyone else, which explains the deferential positioning.\n\nOnce the royal couple is seated, the bride is able to sit alongside her husband - as Queen Suthida is shown doing in images from the wedding.\n\nVajiralongkorn, who has been married three times, is due to be crowned the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty.\n\nHarsh lese-majeste laws have shielded public scrutiny of his colourful private life, and all media in Thailand must self-censor.\n\nIn 2016, he was spotted wearing a tight, white crop top, his body adorned with temporary tattoos and holding a white fluffy poodle, while standing next to his consort.\n\nDuring an attempted coup in Thailand in 2014, a film was published online of his third wife dressed in nothing but a black G-string while she sang happy birthday to the royal couple's beloved pet poodle, Fufu.\n\nVajiralongkorn was educated at military academies, took part in 1970s counterinsurgency action against the Communist Party of Thailand, and is a qualified pilot in the air force, the service he is closest to.\n\nThere are special army units directly under the palace's command, and Vajiralongkorn has augmented their strength.\n\nNew political jousting may follow Vajiralongkorn's coronation within days, when election results are supposed to be certified - and will almost certainly be challenged by the losers."
