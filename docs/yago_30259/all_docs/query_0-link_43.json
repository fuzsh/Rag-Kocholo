        "text": "On June 4 Sitanan Satsaksit called her brother, Wanchalearm, as he bought meatballs from a food stall in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. Then she heard a loud bang, screams, and her brother shouting, \"I can't breathe\". Onlookers say armed men bundled Wanchalearm into a black SUV, which sped away.\n\nWanchalearm was a human-rights activist who had fled Thailand after a military coup there in 2014. Aged 37, he was the ninth exiled Thai dissident to disappear in recent years. The bodies of two were found in the Mekong River on Thailand's border with Laos - disembowelled, bodies stuffed with concrete, their legs broken and hands shackled. Nobody expects to see Wanchalearm alive again.\n\nThe sons and their mother resettled in America, where they still live - scattered between Florida, New York and Oregon. The sons said later that their mother had \"lived in a state of servitude, and every time [their father] found another woman we would be forced out of the house\".\n\nIn 2001 Vajiralongkorn married his third wife, Srirasmi Suwadi, a lady-in-waiting, with whom he had another son, Prince Dipangkorn. Dipangkorn, Vajiralongkorn's heir apparent, is now 15.\n\nVajiralongkorn was attracting attention not just for his womanising. His financial and business affairs also drew scrutiny. During an audience for Thai journalists he was obliged to deny reports that he had links to organised crime, or that he was \"a chao poh [mafia-like godfather]\", or \"a great tycoon with billions\".\n\nIn 1987 he curtailed an official visit to Japan, one of Thailand's biggest economic partners, after complaining of being treated discourteously. When Japan's prime minister visited Bangkok several years later, says Handley, Vajiralongkorn took revenge. For 20 minutes he used three F-5 fighter planes, one piloted by himself, to block the visitor's Boeing 747 as it taxied towards the reception party after landing.\n\nThe royal family's activities are mostly a closely guarded secret, but occasional leaks have offered other glimpses of Vajiralongkorn's increasingly dissolute lifestyle. There was a video in 2014 that showed Princess Srirasmi sitting next to him at an opulent birthday party, naked except for a G-string.\n\nThere was the occasion in 2012 on which Vajiralongkorn, Srirasmi and an entourage of 30 flew into Farnborough on a private Boeing 737 (Thai royals have 38 planes and helicopters at their disposal). He visited the White Lion Antiques centre in Hartley Wintney and spent Â£10,000 on fine bone china in four hours, 15 security guards having first ensured the centre was closed to other visitors that day.\n\nThen, in 2010, Wikileaks published a trove of classified telegrams from the US embassy in Bangkok to Washington. In one, the outgoing ambassador, Ralph Boyce, described a gala dinner attended by Vajiralongkorn and his poodle in 2007.\n\n\"Foo Foo was present... dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts, and at one stage during the band's second number, he jumped up on to the head table and began lapping from guests' water glasses... The Air Chief Marshal's antics drew the full attention of the 600-plus audience members, and remains the talk of the town.\" (When Foo Foo died in 2015, he received a lavish, four-day Buddhist funeral).\n\nIn other telegrams, Boyce's successor, Eric John, disclosed that since 2008 Vajiralongkorn had spent most of his time with \"his leading mistress\" at a villa he owns in Tutzing, a lakeside spa near Munich. When he flew back to Bangkok he stayed not with his wife, Srirasmi, but with \"his second mistress\".\n\nJohn also wrote about Vajiralongkorn's \"violent and unpredictable mood swings\", and his clandestine relationship with Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecoms tycoon who served as prime minister from 2001 until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006.\n\nWhile King Bhumipol was trying to control his prodigal son through budgetary restraint, Thaksin sought to ingratiate himself with the future king by giving him money. John reported how a police commander served as Thaksin's secret \"bagman, delivering funds skimmed from lottery proceeds to the Crown Prince\". Other cables revealed that Thaksin had bought and renovated a palace for Vajiralongkorn.\n\nBy 2010 Bhumibol was ailing in hospital. The Thai establishment was alarmed at the prospect of Vajiralongkorn succeeding him. John quoted senior courtiers suggesting that he was incapable of avoiding \"embarrassing financial transactions\", and his popular younger sister, Princess Sirindhorn, would make a better monarch.\n\nBhumipol shared their concern. \"He thought his son needed to live up to his own standards of behaviour in terms of family and duty to his country,\" says Handley. But he declined to break with tradition by disinheriting his son in favour of Princess Sirindhorn, even after Vajiralongkorn divorced his third wife, Srirasmi, in brutal fashion in 2014. He stripped her of her titles, placed her under house arrest and imprisoned her ageing parents for allegedly exploiting their royal connections. Pictures later circulated of the Princess with a shaven head.\n\nBhumibol died in 2016. Vajiralongkorn was formally crowned as Rama X, 10th monarch of the 238-year-old Chakri dynasty, at a three-day, Â£24 million coronation in May 2019 during which he was carried through Bangkok on a gilded palanquin. The crowds, some bussed in to swell the numbers, were far smaller than those for Bhumibol's funeral.\n\nThree days before his coronation Vajiralongkorn married his fourth wife, Suthida Tidjai, a former Thai Airlines stewardess given the rank of general. Two months after it he named Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, a former nurse, pilot and bodyguard, as his 'royal noble consort', resurrecting a practice of royal polygamy dormant for a century.\n\nVajiralongkorn marked Sineenat's preferment by releasing a photograph of her at the controls of a light aircraft wearing a camouflaged sports bra. Within another three months the capricious new monarch had imprisoned Sineenat for seeking equal status to the queen, only to restore her as his official concubine in August of this year.\n\nVajiralongkorn inherited a kingdom in some disarray. For 15 years there had been repeated conflicts between the military and Bangkok establishment elite on one side, and millions of rural Thais championed by the populist Thaksin on the other. Thaksin was ousted in 2006, and Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was also deposed as prime minister in a 2014 coup led by Prayuth Chan-ocha, the army chief. An election last year, which the opposition maintains was rigged, gave Prayuth a cosmetic legitimacy as prime minister.\n\nHaving accepted Thaksin's money before the 2006 coup, Vajiralongkorn subsequently abandoned him and entered a mutually beneficial alliance with the new military-backed regimes. They ensured his smooth succession. He lent them the monarchy's valuable imprimatur.\n\nAs king, Vajiralongkorn has made no pretence of remaining above politics, no effort to seek consensus or unify Thailand as his father did. He has instead sought to accumulate and consolidate his power.\n\nHe has had the assets of Thailand's Crown Property Bureau, which manages investments thought to be worth up to $40 billion, transferred to him, \"so they may be administered and managed at His Majesty's discretion\".\n\nHe has installed loyalists in key posts, and taken command of a 'private army' of about 5,000 elite soldiers scrupulously vetted for loyalty. He has changed the law to enable him to exercise authority while abroad.\n\nHe banned his elder sister, Princess Ubolratana, from running as a Thaksin-backed candidate for prime minister in last year's election. His government allies have meanwhile drawn up a constitution designed to maximise the military's influence and hobble opposition parties. Leading political dissidents have 'disappeared', while others have been sent to 'attitude adjustment' camps. Monuments commemorating the abolition of Thailand's absolute monarchy in 1932 have been removed. Marshall says Vijaralongkorn's Dhaweewattana Palace complex in north Bangkok now houses a prison.\n\nThe first protests began in February when a court dissolved the new, reformist Future Forward Party after it performed strongly in last year's election. They were halted by the Covid-19 lockdown, but the revelation that Vajiralongkorn was ensconced in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, an Alpine resort, fuelled public anger.\n\nHe was joined there by an entourage of 100, including a harem of 20 female 'soldiers', with some of whom he goes out cycling. \"Bike, f-k, eat. He does only those three things,\" an insider told the Economist magazine. And fly. By late March, German media said he was jetting around the country in his Boeing 737, often landing at airports without even disembarking, just for the hell of it. In April he reportedly flew 11,000 miles from Munich to Bangkok and back for a 20-hour visit.\n\nMarshall believes the King ordered Wanchalearm's abduction because he was angered by Thai and German activists protesting outside his hotel. True or not, the abduction ignited a much more serious wave of protests in July. They have continued ever since, spreading across the country and attracting tens of thousands of demonstrators.\n\nThe regime has arrested the protest leaders for sedition. It has shut down online forums and censored the media. It has deployed riot police, tear gas and water cannon. It has imposed a curfew. It has co-opted university authorities. It is thought to have bussed in monarchists and government employees to stage counter-protests. In October it banned gatherings of more than four people and media reports that could 'cause panic'. The king has also returned from Germany.\n\nBut the student-led protesters - inspired by last year's pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong - have not been cowed. They are tenacious, resourceful and social-media-savvy. They have co-opted the three-finger salute from The Hunger Games as a symbol of defiance. They have adopted Do You Hear the People Sing? from Les MisÃ©rables as their anthem. They have pressured the German government to stop Vajiralongkorn conducting state affairs from its soil.\n\nIncreasingly they are demanding not just a new constitution, Prayuth's resignation as prime minister and an end to harassment, but curbs on the monarchy, too. When Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana, 33, Vajiralongkorn's second daughter, staged a fashion show in Bangkok's Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the protesters had 'models' strut down a makeshift 'catwalk' outside wearing skimpy crop tops. \"Open defiance and mockery of the monarchy - that's something we've never seen before in Thai history,\" said Marshall.\n\nHow this ends remains unclear. The monarchy still commands respect among older Thais. Neither side appears willing to compromise. Marshall fears the military may seek to crush the protests by force, but adds, \"I don't know if the people will stand for it. I think it will be the end of the regime.\"\n\nAnd not only of the regime, perhaps. The monarchy is no longer the hallowed institution it was under Bhumibol. His degenerate son has squandered its vast moral authority, and transformed it from an object of veneration to one of scorn. Deference has given way to defiance. If the regime continues to block reform, and if Vajiralongkorn continues to behave as he does, says Chachavalpongpun, the exiled Thai scholar, \"it could lead to the downfall of the monarchy\".\n\nSign up for the Telegraph Luxury newsletter for your weekly dose of exquisite taste and expert opinion."
