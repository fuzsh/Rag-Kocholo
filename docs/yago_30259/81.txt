Suthida is the current wife of King Vajiralongkorn and the royal consort of Thailand. The couple has been married for less than a year, and she has not been in the public eye for very long, only rising to the rank of queen in May 2019. Here are some things you might not know about Suthida.

1. Suthida is his fourth wife

Before Suthida, King Vajiralongkorn was married to Soamsawali Kitiyakara (it lasted from 1977 to 1993), Sujarinee Vivacharawongse (1994 to 1996), and Srirasmi Suwadee (2001 to 2014). All of his previous marriages ended in divorce. He has been married to Suthida since May 2019.

2. She used to be a flight attendant and a bodyguard

Suthida was a flight attendant for JALways Airlines from 2000 to 2003, and later worked for Thai Airways from 2003 to 2008. After her career as a flight attendant ended she pursued a very different career path.

In 2013 she joined the Ratchawanlop Guards, a group of bodyguards who protect the Crown Prince, and was designated to the special officer unit of the Crown Prince’s Bodyguard Regiment. By August 2015, she had been promoted to lieutenant general. She also joined the Royal Thai Army and was promoted to the rank of general in 2016.

3. The marriage ceremony was a surprise

When Vajiralongkorn married the then-deputy commander of his bodyguards a few days before his coronation, it was unexpected as the palace had not confirmed the relationship. However, some media outlets had picked up on their connection; by October 2016, she and the king were being seen together occasionally.

4. It’s a crime to criticise the queen and members of the royal family

Thailand has strict lèse-majesté laws, which make it illegal to defame, insult or criticise any member of the Thai royal family. Punishment can result in up to 15 years in prison. Human rights groups have protested, but the prime minister has argued that the law is necessary to protect the royal family.
