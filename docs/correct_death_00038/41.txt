Just a day after she died of heart failure, Elizabeth Taylor was laid to rest at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, outside Los Angeles - the same place where her close friend, singer Michael Jackson, was buried in 2009.

Inside the sprawling Forest Lawn Cemetery, barricades blocked access to the funeral, where about four dozen family members mourned the Oscar-winning actress, 79.

The service lasted an hour and started 15 minutes late.

The service began 15 minutes after its announced start time in observance of Taylorâ€™s parting wish that her funeral start late, her publicist Sally Morrison said.
