        "text": "That Time Elizabeth Taylor Lived at Our Hotel\n\nIn the 1950’s, the iconic English-American actor and humanitarian — Elizabeth Taylor spent a brief time living here at The Plaza Hotel Pioneer Park in El Paso. Well, at the time it was the Hilton Hotel, and Taylor was married to heir Conrad “Nicky” Hilton Jr.\n\nTaylor’s Time in El Paso\n\nIn its time as a Hilton property, The Plaza was a frequent hub for celebrity socialites staying in town. The standout amongst the regulars was the singular Elizabeth Taylor. Following her union with Nicky, Taylor found herself spending more and more time at the El Paso property where several of the Hiltons themselves lived at the time.\n\nIt’s been reported that her extended stay here came after a four-month honeymoon trip around Texas, Mexico, and beyond with the performer’s lavish new husband. Taylor made her name as an actor with several iconic films including A Place In The Sun, Giant, and Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\n\nLa Perla — Taylor’s Penthouse Today\n\nSome changes of ownership, closures, and renovations later — and the hotel that was once the Hilton Hotel in El Paso is now open again as The Plaza Hotel Pioneer Park. Much of Hilton’s inspired original architecture has been preserved and reimagined.\n\nOn the 17th floor, where Nicky and Elizabeth’s romantic penthouse once was — La Perla now stands as the crown jewel of El Paso. Open exclusively to hotel guests, the rooftop bar and restaurant is inspired by La Peregrina, an iconic pearl passed from the Spanish monarchy, to Napoleon Bonaparte’s mother, and then to (you guessed it) Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nBaking in the culturally rich history of its space, the newly opened La Perla offers gorgeous views of El Paso and the surrounding Rocky Mountains. Complementing the scenery, craft cocktails and seafood-driven dishes from Chef Andres Padilla like oysters and ceviches are at the ready.\n\nVisit La Perla\n\nLa Perla is open exclusively to guests of The Plaza Hotel Pioneer Park from Thursday – Saturday, 4 – 11 pm. The space is also available to reserve for private events."
