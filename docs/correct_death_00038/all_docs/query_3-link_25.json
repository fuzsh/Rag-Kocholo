        "text": "Dame Elizabeth Taylor, one of the 20th Century's biggest movie stars, has died in Los Angeles at the age of 79.\n\nThe double Oscar-winning actress had a long history of ill health and was being treated for symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n\nHer four children were with her when she died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, her publicist said.\n\nIn a statement, her son Michael Wilding called her \"an extraordinary woman who lived life to the fullest\".\n\n\"We know, quite simply, that the world is a better place for Mom having lived in it,\" he continued.\n\n\"Her legacy will never fade, her spirit will always be with us, and her love will live forever in our hearts.\"\n\nDame Elizabeth's most famous films included National Velvet, Cleopatra and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nShe was equally well-known for her glamour and film partnership with Richard Burton, one of seven husbands.\n\nIn her prime, she was arguably one of the world's greatest actresses and most beautiful women.\n\nHer colourful private life, screen success and Aids charity work ensured she was never far from the spotlight since finding fame at the age of 12.\n\nThe peak of her film career came in the 1950s and 1960s, with four Oscar nominations in a row from 1958 to 1961.\n\nShe lost out in her first three attempts - for Raintree County, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Suddenly, Last Summer - but triumphed at her fourth attempt with Butterfield 8.\n\nHer second Oscar came in 1967 for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, one of 12 films with Burton.\n\nShe met the actor while filming 1963's Cleopatra - which became notorious as one of the most expensive films of all time, but which also sparked one of Hollywood's greatest romances.\n\nTaylor had already been married four times - to Conrad Hilton Jr, Michael Wilding, Michael Todd and Eddie Fisher - before she wed Burton in 1964.\n\nTheir tempestuous relationship saw them divorce and remarry in 1975 before she moved on to further marriages with John W Warner and Larry Fortensky.\n\nHer health problems began with a fall while filming her first hit film, National Velvet, which led to a lifetime of back problems.\n\nA rare strain of pneumonia almost killed her in 1961 and she also battled addictions to alcohol and painkillers.\n\nIn the 1990s, she endured two hip replacement operations and another near-fatal bout of pneumonia and survived surgery for a benign brain tumour in 1997.\n\nIn 2004, it was revealed that she was suffering from congestive heart failure, with symptoms including fatigue and shortness of breath, and scoliosis, which twisted her spine."
