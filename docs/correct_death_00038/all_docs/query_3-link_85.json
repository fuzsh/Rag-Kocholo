We know, quite simply, that the world is a better place for mom having lived in it.\n\n\"Her legacy will never fade, her spirit will always be with us, and her love will live forever in our hearts.\"\n\nChairman of the Motion Picture Association of America Chris Dodd lauded Taylor's contribution to both the arts and to society as a whole.\n\n\"Her talent endured the test of time and transcended generations of moviegoers,\" Dodd said. \"She truly was an American icon, whose legacy went far beyond her acting skills, most notably in her efforts to lead the battle against HIV/AIDS.\"\n\nMichael Weinstein, president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, also praised Taylor for her humanitarian work in the fight against the AIDS.\n\n\"Elizabeth Taylor holds a special place in the hearts of people with AIDS and their supporters for the tireless efforts to combat this dreaded disease,\" Weinstein said. \"Long before it was fashionable, she was there by our side.

She was also nominated for the honor three times.\n\nTaylor, whose private life and marriages had been a constant focus of the tabloid, was married eight times to seven men.\n\nHer first marriage was with Conrad Nicholas \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr. which took place in 1950 when she was 17. The couple divorced eight months later.\n\nTwo years later, Taylor married British actor Michael Wilding, with whom she had two sons, Michael and Christopher. They were divorced five years later in 1957.\n\nIn the same year, Taylor married film producer Michael Todd, her third husband who died a year later in a plane crash. In 1959, she married singer Eddie Fisher, her fourth husband.
