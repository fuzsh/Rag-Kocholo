        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor, the violet-eyed film goddess whose sultry screen life was often upstaged by her stormy personal life, died Wednesday at age 79.\n\nShe died of congestive heart failure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she had been hospitalized for about six weeks, publicist Sally Morrison said.\n\n\"All her children were with her,\" Morrison said.\n\nTaylor is survived by four children -- Michael Wilding, Christopher Wilding, Liza Todd, and Maria Burton -- 10 grand children and four great grandchildren.\n\nTaylor had extraordinary grace, fame and wealth, and won three Oscars, including a special one for her humanitarian work. But she was tortured by ill health, failed romances and personal tragedy.\n\n\"I think I'm becoming fatalistic,\" she said in 1989. \"Too much has happened in my life for me not to be fatalistic.\"\n\nHer eight marriages — including two to actor Richard Burton — and a lifelong battle with substance abuse, physical ailments and overeating made Taylor as popular in supermarket tabloids as in classic film festivals.\n\nTaylor disclosed in November 2004 that she had congestive heart failure. But she still periodically dismissed reports that she was at death's door, saying she used a wheelchair only because of chronic back problems that began at age 12 when she fell from a horse.\n\n\"Oh, come on, do I look like I'm dying?\" she said in May 2006 in a rare television interview on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" ''Do I look like or sound like I have Alzheimer's?\" Tabloids report such things \"because they have nothing else dirty to write about anybody else,\" she said.\n\nWhen she turned 75 the following year, she was asked about the secret to her longevity and quipped: \"Hangin' in.\"\n\nThe London-born actress was a star at age 12, a bride and a divorcee at 18, a screen goddess at 19 and a widow at 26.\n\nShe appeared in more than 50 films, and won Oscars for her performances in \"Butterfield 8\" (1960) and \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966), in which she starred opposite Burton.\n\nIn later years, she was a spokeswoman for several causes, most notably AIDS research. Her work gained her a special Oscar, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, in 1993.\n\nAs she accepted it, she told a worldwide television audience: \"I call upon you to draw from the depths of your being — to prove that we are a human race, to prove that our love outweighs our need to hate, that our compassion is more compelling than our need to blame.\"\n\nShe accepted her many health problems with a stoic attitude.\n\n\"My body's a real mess,\" Taylor told W magazine in 2004. \"If you look at it in the mirror, it's just completely convex and concave.\""
