        "text": "Hollywood is mourning the death of Elizabeth Taylor, who died Wednesday at 79.\n\nThey have released statements and Tweeted their condolences on the screen siren’s sad passing.\n\nBelow, a round-up:\n\n“It was a long productive career and she was the most glamorous and sexual star of our generation. No one else could equal Elizabeth’s beauty and sexuality. Women liked her and men adored her and her love for her children is enduring. She was a symbol of stardom. Her legacy will last.”\n\n– Debbie Reynolds\n\n“I loved her. She hosted a huge party when Hello Dolly first opened in Los Angeles. I remember the lavender roses and the aura of the personality. She said when you find the particular love of your life it is never forgotten. We loved you too, Elizabeth.”\n\n-Carol Channing\n\n“I was on Broadway with Sugar Babies simultaneously while Elizabeth was appearing in Little Foxes. We would meet occasionally after shows. I will never forget those eyes or that laugh.”\n\n-Rip Taylor\n\n“How very sad for us all. She was a marker of our time, my time. It seems like yesterday that I taught a beautiful 14-year-old Elizabeth how to swim at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, more beautiful, more voluptuous than Miss America. I will miss her.”\n\n-Esther Williams\n\n“Liz was a dear friend. Thoughtful… generous… and forever beautiful. She was a great legendary lady of Hollywood and she will be mourned worldwide. My heartfelt prayers and thoughts are with her family.” – Julie Andrews\n\n“I am so sorry to hear that this great legend has passed. I admired and respected her not only as an actress but for her amazing and inspiring work as an AIDS activist. She was one of a kind.”\n\n– Madonna\n\n“She was a true star, because she not only had beauty and notoriety; Elizabeth Taylor had talent. As a friend she was always, always there for me. I’ll miss her for the rest of my life, but I was so lucky to have known her.”\n\n– Liza Minnelli\n\n“She was an illuminator. She put human faces on issues. With her soft voice coming from that tiny frame, she held forth the giant purpose of the true meaning of love; that we are all equally valuable. With one simple movement, pulling her ever famous jewels from that beautiful face, she opened the hearts of the world not just to the condition of HIV/AIDS as she had intended but ultimately to human rights as a whole. She stood in her grace and candor and simply said the truth; that we are one, a world that must understand and accept itself. The world will not be without Dame Elizabeth Taylor, the world is becoming as she envisioned it; freer, and therefore she is not gone.”\n\n– Sharon Stone\n\n“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Elizabeth Taylor. Her artistic contribution to the motion picture industry is immeasurable. In a career spanning more than 70 years and 50 films, her talent endured the test of time and transcended generations of moviegoers. She truly was an American icon, whose legacy went far beyond her acting skills, most notably in her efforts to lead the battle against HIV/AIDS. Our thoughts are with her family and her many friends and fans during this difficult time.” -Senator Chris Dodd, Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America\n\n“Elizabeth was the last great movie star. And a great human being. What I’ll always remember about Elizabeth was her laugh. She would walk into a room looking like a princess and suddenly there would be this cackle that filled the room that would crack us all up. I’m so glad to have known her. It’s a very sad day for me.”\n\n-Barry Manilow\n\n“It’s the end of an era. It wasn’t just her beauty or her stardom. It was her humanitarianism. She put a face on HIV/AIDS. She was funny. She was generous. She made her life count.”\n\n– Barbra Streisand\n\n“It’s a terrible loss. A unique talent and a singularly spectacular individual.”\n\n– Martin Landau\n\n“I don’t know what was more impressive her magnitude as a star or her magnitude as a friend. I will miss her for the rest of my life and beyond.”\n\n-Shirley MacLaine\n\n“We have just lost a Hollywood giant. More importantly, we have lost an incredible human being.”\n\n“The shock of Elizabeth was not only her beauty. It was her generosity. Her giant laugh. Her vitality, whether tackling a complex scene on film or where we would all have dinner until dawn. She is singular and indelible on film and in our hearts.”\n\n–Mike Nichols\n\n“Elizabeth Taylor was a dear friend. I knew her from our days together at MGM when she was just a teenager, and I watched her grow into one of Hollywood’s finest actresses. She was passionate – and compassionate – about everything in her life, including her family, her friends, and especially the victims of … AIDS. She was truly a legend and we will miss her.”\n\n–Nancy Reagan\n\n“I knew Elizabeth Taylor and I can tell you she was kind, brave, generous and loyal. I am sad.”\n\n“Elizabeth and I began our careers about the same time at MGM. Throughout her tumultuous life, she will be remembered for some unique and memorable work. And she will be ever remembered and appreciated for her forthright support of AMFAR.”\n\n–Angela Lansbury\n\n“Elizabeth Taylor was the last of the great glamour stars. She was the longest-running soap opera in history, and represented all the allure and tragedy that attracts people to Hollywood.”\n\n– British director Michael Winner\n\n“Elizabeth Taylor was a silver screen legend, a tabloid favorite 50 years before Brangelina and a tireless worker for noble causes. RIP.”\n\n-Critic Richard Roeper\n\n“Elizabeth Taylor was a great friend, a great star and one gutsy woman. She was so special. You won’t see the likes of her again… If Elizabeth took on a battle, she took it on 100%. She was first major celeb in the AIDS battle and she made it her cause…”\n\n“I met Elizabeth Taylor several times. She was witty and self-deprecating, which I found surprising and delightful. She loved to laugh.”\n\n-Steve Martin\n\n“Today my friend Elizabeth Taylor passed away. Oddly, we all knew this day was coming but still her passing took my breath away. She was a funny, loud, joke tellin, diamond loving, fantastic woman. She played a big role in shaping my life as Whoopi Goldberg. It really is the end of an era.”\n\n-Whoopi Goldberg\n\n“Elizabeth, thank you for all your help in the battle for HIV and AIDS. You will be missed by the world.”\n\n-Magic Johnson\n\n“Elizabeth…thank u for the lessons u taught me about life..suffering and Joy….you are the BRIGHTEST STAR in the universe..Eternal love.”\n\n-Kirstie Alley\n\n“Elizabeth taylor! Rest in peace sweet angel. No star has ever illuminated the world quite like you. You were the first to champion those suffering with AIDS publicly. Today, the world loses, but heaven just became very very glamorous. We will miss you terribly.”\n\n-Adam Shankman\n\n“Liz Taylor lived life with grace, class and a deep respect for others. The heavens now shine with a bright new star.”\n\n-George Takei\n\n“Sad to hear of Elizabeth Taylor’s death. She was the 1st major celebrity to join me in the fight against AIDS when it wasn’t a popular cause.”\n\n-Joan Rivers\n\n“Such a sad day, Elizabeth Taylor was the last of the Hollywood greats, and a fantastically charming woman. She also did a great deal in the last 25 years to help the world deal with the HIV epidemic. I am proud to have known her if only a little. She was also the only person I’ve ever met that had violet eyes. They were genuinely violet. So beautiful.”\n\n-George Michael\n\n“Surely the greatest screen beauty of them all?\n\n-Piers Morgan\n\n“R.I.P the amazing Liz Taylor, goddess, actress, aids activist and one of the worlds true beauties!”\n\n-Boy George\n\n“RIP Dame Elizabeth Taylor…..Like a pure white diamond you’ll shine on and on and on.”\n\n-Kylie Minogue\n\n“I knew Elizabeth Taylor and I can tell you she was kind, brave, generous and loyal. I am sad.”\n\n-Jane Fonda\n\n“RIP Elizabeth Taylor. UR beauty & talents will be missed, dear girl.”\n\n-Fran Drescher\n\n“Elizabeth Taylor was an impactful person in this industry and on society as a whole. I specifically admire her charitable efforts including bringing early awareness to HIV/AIDS. Most memorable is her steadfast loyalty and unwavering friendship to my late brother Michael Jackson. Liz provided a sense of relief and comfort to my brother at various difficult times in his life, and I appreciate that, may she rest in peace.”\n\n-Tito Jackson\n\n“Liz Taylor was an amazing woman and screen legend. She was an incredible friend to my brother, at his side through some of his most difficult times and of course loved by his children and our family. She will live on in our hearts forever, my prayers go out to her family.”\n\n– La Toya Jackson\n\n“Our loss in the motion picture business with Elizabeth Taylor’s passing is momentous. She was a lady who gave of herself to everyone. I know I consider it a great personal loss.”\n\n–Mickey Rooney"
