        "text": "Before she died, Elizabeth Taylor let Architectural Digest into her home to shoot the interiors and gardens, which are featured in the magazine’s July issue, out today.\n\nTaylor, who passed away March 23, 2011, lived in a four-bedroom house on a wooded property in Bel-Air, California, which she purchased in the early 1980s. The magazine describes the house as being designed for family and enjoyment.\n\n“Of course when she had to appear at an important event, she would put on the most beautiful dress and the most amazing jewelry and become Elizabeth Taylor, the star,” fashion designer Valentino told Architectural Digest. “But at home she liked a cozy life, friends, good food.\n\nAlmost every room in the house — which was redecorated in 2010 by Waldo Fernandez , who has also done interiors for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie — was done in blues and lavenders, which evoked the color of Taylor’s legendary violet eyes.\n\nThe furnishings include a Franz Hals portrait, Impressionist paintings, Taylor’s three Oscars, and Irene Sharaff sketches of the costumes for the actress’ 1968 film Doctor Faustus with Richard Burton.\n\nThis exclusive photo shows Taylor’s romantic garden. The climbing rose “Cecile Brunner” climbs over an arbor while the hybrid tea rose Elizabeth Taylor, introduced in 1985, grows nearby. According to the magazine, “the plantings influenced the perfume line Taylor launched in 1987.”\n\nThe 1960s ranch-style house has just been put on the market for $8.6 million. The gated 1.27-acre estate includes a bricked motor court and swimming pool. The house is 7,000 square feet and featured a galley-like country kitchen, powder room and maid’s quarters on the lower floor, with a master suite with adjacent dressing room on the second floor."
