        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor was buried alongside her last ever love letter from Richard Burton.\n\nThe 79-year-old screen legend - who died of congestive heart failure last week - was reportedly laid to rest at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles with the romantic note at her side after having kept the letter next to her for the past 27 years.\n\nAccording to website MailOnline, the 'Cleopatra' actress - who was married to Richard twice - was granted her dying wish to be buried alongside the letter, which was penned by the actor prior to his sudden death in 1984 aged 58.\n\nShe reportedly told her biographers Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger: \"In it he told me what he wanted. Home was where Elizabeth was, and he wanted to come home.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the late star's collection of jewels - believed to be worth an estimated $150 million - are reportedly set to be auctioned at Christie's.\n\nPeter Sedghi, president of Luxury Jewels of Beverly Hills, who worked with the late actress on her House of Taylor line, told People magazine: \"She had the most amazing eye. When you would show her stones, she would tell you the origin, if it's good quality, bad quality, where it came from.\n\n\"She had a collection like I've never seen before, and she knew exactly what every one was - what the diamonds were, the quality. But it was more for her; it was the history behind it. A lot of them had sentimental value.\""
