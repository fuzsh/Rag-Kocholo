        "text": "Hollywood's elite will be making the sad trip to Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, Calif., today to pay respects to Elizabeth Taylor, who died yesterday at 79.\n\nA memorial for the legendary actress is slated to take place at 2 p.m. at the famous burial ground, where she will be laid to rest not too far from the grave of her longtime friend Michael Jackson.\n\nAnd security is expected to be extra tight.\n\nPHOTOS: Remember Elizabeth Taylor--Her Life in Pictures\n\nGlendale police have confirmed there will be a contingent of officers on hand. They will help shield mourners from looky-loos and possibly picketers from the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Chuch, who have vowed to protest the ceremony due to Taylor's commitment to gay causes and AIDS research.\n\nFollowing typical procedure for celebrity funerals there, the private cemetery will only let listed family and friends through the front gates.\n\nThe closest public area is on Forest Lawn Drive, well removed from the actual interment site, which has been covered by a massive white tent.\n\nAs of early afternoon, media helicopters were already buzzing the scene, nestled on a bucolic hillside just northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAside from Jackson, several of Tinseltown notables are interred there, including Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, W.C. Fields, Red Skelton, Gracie Allen, Walt Disney and Nat King Cole.\n\nMORE: See Elizabeth Taylor's death certificate\n\nAlso today, Taylor's death certificate was released by Los Angeles County officials. The document lists Taylor as a high school graduate and an actress for 70 years.\n\nThe certificate states that two-time Oscar winner died at 1:28 a.m. Wednesday due to a combination of maladies, several of which she endured for years.\n\nThe official cause of death is listed as cardiopulmonary arrest (which lasted five minutes), congestive heart failure (which she suffered with for five years) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which she had battled for 10 years). Pneumonia was also listed as a significant contributing cause of death.\n\nLet's hope she is finally able to rest in peace."
