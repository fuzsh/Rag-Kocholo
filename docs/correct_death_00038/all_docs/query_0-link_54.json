        "text": "A Bel Air residence that once belonged to Hollywood icon Elizabeth Taylor sold for $11 million last month in an off-market deal—but it’s now in danger of being demolished.\n\nThe historic home’s new owner is Ardie Tavangarian, a Los Angeles-based real estate developer who is known for building massive spec mansions, including one that sold for $75 million in 2019. According to Dirt, Tavangarian has plans to raze the abode and construct a whole new dwelling in its place.\n\nBuilt in 1960, the 7,000-square-foot home—which boasts six bedrooms and six bathrooms—is where Taylor lived from 1981 until her death in 2011. The actress purchased the property, sited on 1.27 acres, for $2 million (approximately $5.7 million today) from none other than Nancy Sinatra.\n\nAccording to Architectural Digest, when Taylor lived there, she hired Waldo Fernandez—interior designer to the stars—to revamp the house so that it embodied \"family and fun, not fame and flashbulbs.\" As Sharon Stone told AD in 2011, “Elizabeth was full of warmth and love, and her home reflected her caring and her embrace of her friends.”\n\nTowards the end of the British-born actress's life, the two-story mid-century ranch was photographed by Catherine Opie over the course of six months, with over 3,000 pictures taken in total (many of which can be seen in the book ). So if even the house is torn down, its legacy—much like Taylor's—will always live on."
