She had been at the treatment center for six weeks.\n\nTaylor’s publicist Sally Morrison said, “All her children were with her.”\n\nElizabeth Taylor: A tribute video >>\n\nA truly memorable career\n\nElizabeth Taylor was a beautiful presence on screen, winning three Oscars during her time in the industry. Her rocky personal life, eight marriages and health became almost as famous as her roles.\n\nElizabeth Taylor: Her best movie moments >>\n\n“I think I’m becoming fatalistic,” she explained back in 1989. “Too much has happened in my life for me not to be fatalistic.”\n\nIn November of 2004, it was revealed that Elizabeth Taylor had congestive heart failure, but she maintained she was not deteriorating.\n\n“Oh, come on, do I look like I’m dying?” she said in May 2006 during an interview with Larry King. She added, “Do I look like or sound like I have Alzheimer’s? Tabloids report such things because they have nothing else dirty to write about anybody else.”\n\nElizabeth Taylor fought a good fight, and by no means did anyone think she’d be gone on this day.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to her family and friends.\n\nRead on for more on Elizabeth Taylor"
