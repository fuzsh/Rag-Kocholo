View photos of her life and watch Paul Newman’s tribute. Plus, full coverage of Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nNominated for many Academy Awards, Taylor won Best Actress for Butterfield 8 in 1961 and for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966. In addition to her silver-screen success, Taylor was well-known for her flashy style and her many marriages—eight, to seven different men, including Richard Burton (twice), Eddie Fisher, and former Sen. John Warner. Born in London to American parents, she moved with her family to the U.S. in 1939 to escape World War II. Taylor had been ill with congestive heart failure for several years and was hospitalized in February.\n\nPhotos: Elizabeth Taylor’s Life\n\nPhotos: Elizabeth Taylor's Many Men\n\nWatch: Paul Newman’s Tribute to Elizabeth Taylor"
