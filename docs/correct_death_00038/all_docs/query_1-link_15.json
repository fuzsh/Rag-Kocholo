        "text": "The actress was buried yesterday, in a private funeral service\n\nOscar-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor was laid to rest yesterday, in a small, private ceremony in the Los Angeles hills.\n\nELIZABETH TAYLOR: A LIFE IN PICTURES\n\nIn keeping with the Jewish tradition - to which she converted when she married fourth husband Eddie Fisher in 1959 - the 79-year-old star was buried the day after her death, at the Forest Lawn cemetery in LA.\n\nThe famous hillside location is the resting place for many other Hollywood greats, including Michael Jackson, Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable and Jean Harlow.\n\nThe low-key ceremony was attended by just a handful of close friends and family, who arrived in a convoy of black stretched limos, and started 15 fashionable minutes late, in keeping with the actress's wishes.\n\n'She even wanted to be late for her own funeral,' a rep said in a statement.\n\nIt’s thought a larger and more public memorial service for the legendary star is being planned for a later date.\n\nThe screen legend died at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday morning, after suffering from congestive heart failure.\n\nA spokesman said the actress passed away ‘peacefully’ at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, surrounded by her four children.\n\nTaylor - who was married eight times, and famously tied the knot to Richard Burton twice - is survived by ten grandchildren and four great grandchildren."
