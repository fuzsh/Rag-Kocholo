She was 79.\n\nHer funeral service started 15 minutes late, at the star's request.\n\n\"Miss Taylor had left instructions that it was to begin at least 15 minutes later than publicly scheduled, with the announcement: 'She even wanted to be late for her own funeral',\" said a statement from her publicist."
