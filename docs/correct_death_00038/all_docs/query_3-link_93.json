        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor was laid to rest Thursday in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles in a small private ceremony attended by her children, grandchildren, and selected close friends. By her request, she was 15 minutes late for her own funeral.\n\nTaylor converted to Judaism before her 1959 wedding to Eddie Fisher. Jewish tradition for funerals call for burial within 24 hours, hence her funeral taking place so promptly after her death on Wednesday. She was married eight times to seven husbands throughout her life.\n\nTaylor’s casket was closed and draped with gardenias, violets, and lily of the valley. She was interred in The Great Mausoleum, the same resting place for her longtime friend Michael Jackson. Forest Lawn Cemetery is also the final resting place of many other celebrities, including Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, W.C. Fields, Red Skelton, Gracie Allen, and Nat King Cole.\n\nActor Colin Farrell, a close friend of Taylor’s, gave a reading of a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins, “The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo.” Her son Michael Wilding, her daughter Liza and her grandson Tarquin Wilding, also gave readings, according to People magazine. Her grandson Rhys Tivey performed a trumpet solo of “Amazing Grace.”\n\nHere is the poem, “The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo,” written by Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-89).\n\nThe Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo\n\nTHE LEADEN ECHO\n\nHow to keep—is there any any, is there none such, nowhere known some, bow or brooch or braid or brace, lace, latch or catch or key to keep\n\nBack beauty, keep it, beauty, beauty, beauty, … from vanishing away?\n\nO is there no frowning of these wrinkles, ranked wrinkles deep,\n\nDown? no waving off of these most mournful messengers, still messengers, sad and stealing messengers of grey?\n\nNo there ’s none, there ’s none, O no there ’s none,\n\nNor can you long be, what you now are, called fair,\n\nDo what you may do, what, do what you may,\n\nAnd wisdom is early to despair:\n\nBe beginning; since, no, nothing can be done\n\nTo keep at bay\n\nAge and age’s evils, hoar hair,\n\nRuck and wrinkle, drooping, dying, death’s worst, winding sheets, tombs and worms and tumbling to decay;\n\nSo be beginning, be beginning to despair.\n\nO there ’s none; no no no there ’s none:\n\nBe beginning to despair, to despair,\n\nDespair, despair, despair, despair.\n\nTHE GOLDEN ECHO\n\nSpare!\n\nThere is one, yes I have one (Hush there!);\n\nOnly not within seeing of the sun,\n\nNot within the singeing of the strong sun,\n\nTall sun’s tingeing, or treacherous the tainting of the earth’s air,\n\nSomewhere elsewhere there is ah well where! one,\n\nOne. Yes I can tell such a key, I do know such a place,\n\nWhere whatever’s prized and passes of us, everything that ’s fresh and fast flying of us, seems to us sweet of us and swiftly away with, done away with, undone,\n\nUndone, done with, soon done with, and yet dearly and dangerously sweet\n\nOf us, the wimpled-water-dimpled, not-by-morning-matched face,\n\nThe flower of beauty, fleece of beauty, too too apt to, ah! to fleet,\n\nNever fleets more, fastened with the tenderest truth\n\nTo its own best being and its loveliness of youth: it is an everlastingness of, O it is an all youth!\n\nCome then, your ways and airs and looks, locks, maiden gear, gallantry and gaiety and grace,\n\nWinning ways, airs innocent, maiden manners, sweet looks, loose locks, long locks, lovelocks, gaygear, going gallant, girlgrace—\n\nResign them, sign them, seal them, send them, motion them with breath,\n\nAnd with sighs soaring, soaring sighs deliver\n\nThem; beauty-in-the-ghost, deliver it, early now, long before death\n\nGive beauty back, beauty, beauty, beauty, back to God, beauty’s self and beauty’s giver.\n\nSee; not a hair is, not an eyelash, not the least lash lost; every hair\n\nIs, hair of the head, numbered.\n\nNay, what we had lighthanded left in surly the mere mould\n\nWill have waked and have waxed and have walked with the wind what while we slept,\n\nThis side, that side hurling a heavyheaded hundredfold\n\nWhat while we, while we slumbered.\n\nO then, weary then why\n\nWhen the thing we freely forfeit is kept with fonder a care,\n\nFonder a care kept than we could have kept it, kept\n\nFar with fonder a care (and we, we should have lost it) finer, fonder\n\nA care kept.—Where kept? Do but tell us where kept, where.—\n\nYonder.—What high as that! We follow, now we follow.—Yonder, yes yonder, yonder,\n\nYonder."
