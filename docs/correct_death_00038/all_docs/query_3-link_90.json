        "text": "MarriedAtTheMovies\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n·\n\nFeb 23, 2017\n\n--\n\nHow much do you know about Dame Elizabeth Taylor?\n\nThere are so many words to describe Elizabeth Taylor. Actress. Icon. Goddess. Humanitarian. Activist. Wrought with tragedy, illness, excess, and romantic intrigue, the name “Elizabeth Taylor” is larger than life . She loved hard, lived large, and suffered deeply — Elizabeth Taylor’s story is one of epic love, loss, and survival.\n\nElizabeth Taylor’s Vital Statistics:\n\nBorn: February 27, 1932\n\nHeight: 5’2\n\nWeight: 120\n\nYears in the business: 70\n\nFilms: 50\n\nMarriages: Eight (Conrad ‘Nicky’ Hilton, Michael Wilding, Michael Todd, Eddie Fisher, Richard Burton (twice), John Warner, and Larry Fortensky.)\n\nOscar Nominations: Five (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Raintree County, Suddenly Last Summer, BUtterfield 8 and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf)\n\nOscar Wins: Two (Butterfield 8 and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf)\n\nTabloid headlines: Countless. (“Love. Lust. And Liz.”; “The Night Burton Got Smashed Because Of Liz” ; “New Trouble Ahead for Liz”; “Passion & Waste” ; “Liz’s Final Days”; “The End”)\n\nThe Early Years\n\nElizabeth Taylor was born in London, 1932, to a prominent American art dealer and former stage actress.\n\nTaylor was born with a thick layer of black hair covering her body, a rare condition known as hypertrichosis. She also had a double row of eyelashes.\n\nTaylor’s mother blamed herself for the condition, thinking that she’d failed to ‘imbibe beautiful thoughts of the requisite strength’. The condition wore off, revealing a stunning baby of unnatural beauty.\n\nAfter the onslaught of World War II, the family returned to America and in Los Angeles in 1941.\n\nElizabeth Taylor’s mother, Sara, was the ultimate stage mother. She had been a bit player on the stage during the 1920s, and recognized that her young child had a promising “star quality”.\n\nTaylor’s mother hounded the Hollywood studios, securing a contract in 1943 thanks largely in part to the girl’s striking beauty: raven black hair and violet eyes.\n\nTaylor literally grew up in front of the camera; never attending a traditional school, she attended the Little Red Schoolhouse on MGM’s lot.\n\n“I have the emotions of a child in the body of a woman. I was rushed into womanhood for the movies. It caused me long moments of unhappiness and doubt.”\n\nThe fact that Taylor never had an “awkward phase”, meant that her blossoming beauty ensured steady work throughout her adolescence, in teenage movies like A Date with Judy as well as more illustrious productions like Little Women.\n\nCreated, cultivated and bred by MGM, Taylor was, initially, just another ‘product’ to be exploited by studio suits.\n\n“If someone’s dumb enough to offer me a million dollars to make a picture, I’m certainly not dumb enough to turn it down.”\n\nThe Middle Years\n\nDuring the 1950s, Taylor was one of the most popular movie stars in the business, and as she grew, she graduated to more adult roles, earning a total of 5 Oscar nominations and 2 wins (BUtterfield 8 and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?)\n\nThroughout her life, Taylor was a loyal friend. In fact, she actually saved the life of her co-star and closest friend, Montgomery Clift, rescuing him from choking to death after a car crash in 1957.\n\nWhen her husband Michael Todd was killed in a plane crash, the public mourned with Taylor and its obsession with her personal life began. But grieving brought her a little too close to Todd’s best friend…singer Eddie Fisher. Fisher was married to America’s sweetheart Debbie Reynolds and the love triangle became one of the most publicized ones in Hollywood history.\n\nTaylor nearly died from pneumonia a few years after the affair, and her public battle for her life moved the public and they quickly forgave her.\n\n“Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.”\n\nTaylor’s life was plagued with life-threatening illnesses, making her a true survivor. Born with scoliosis, Taylor spent her life in and out of hospitals because of severe back pain, not to mention bouts of pneumonia, seizures, a stroke, skin cancer, and a benign brain tumor.\n\nDuring the ’60s, Taylor was a superstar and often appeared alongside her husband Richard Burton, including the most expensive film ever made to that time, Cleopatra: it cost $300 million to make (adjusted for inflation).\n\nTaylor still managed to challenge herself with complex roles, often opposite Richard Burton (here at Warner Archive we’ve got two of them, The V.I.P.s and The Sandpiper) but their off-screen relationship was so sensational that it often eclipsed their movies.\n\nThe Later Years\n\nDuring her later years, Taylor became a tireless champion for AIDS research.\n\nHer campaigning resulted in being awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn the year 2000, she became Dame Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nHer close friendship with Michael Jackson also ensured she was never far from tabloid headlines, even right up to her passing in 2010 at age 79.\n\n“The ups and downs, the problems and stress, along with all the happiness, have given me optimism and hope because I am living proof of survival.”\n\nElizabeth Taylor’s Filmography (*= available on Warner Archive)\n\n1942 There’s One Born Every Minute\n\n1943 Lassie Come Home\n\n1944 The White Cliffs of Dover\n\n1944 National Velvet\n\n1944 Jane Eyre\n\n1946 Courage of Lassie\n\n1947 Life with Father\n\n1947 Cynthia\n\n1948 Julia Misbehaves\n\n1948 A Date with Judy\n\n1949 Little Women\n\n1949 Conspirator\n\n1950 Father of the Bride\n\n1950 The Big Hangover\n\n1951 A Place in the Sun\n\n1951 Father’s Little Dividend\n\n1951 Callaway Went Thataway\n\n1952 Love Is Better Than Ever\n\n1952 Ivanhoe\n\n1953 The Girl Who Had Everything\n\n1954 Rhapsody\n\n1954 The Last Time I Saw Paris\n\n1954 Elephant Walk\n\n1954 Beau Brummell\n\n1956 Giant\n\n1957 Raintree County\n\n1958 Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\n1959 Suddenly, Last Summer\n\n1960 BUtterfield 8\n\n1963 The V.I.P.s\n\n1963 Cleopatra\n\n1965 The Sandpiper\n\n1966 Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\n1967 The Taming of the Shrew\n\n1967 Reflections in a Golden Eye\n\n1967 Doctor Faustus\n\n1967 The Comedians\n\n1968 Secret Ceremony\n\n1968 Boom!\n\n1969 Anne of the Thousand Days\n\n1970 The Only Game in Town\n\n1972 X,Y, and Zee\n\n1972 Under Milk Wood\n\n1972 Hammersmith Is Out\n\n1973 Night Watch\n\n1973 Divorce His, Divorce Hers\n\n1973 Ash Wednesday\n\n1974 Identikit\n\n1976 Victory at Entebbe\n\n1976 The Blue Bird\n\n1977 A Little Night Music\n\n1985 North and South\n\n1985 Malice in Wonderland\n\n1994 The Flintstones\n\nHere at Warner Archive, we are honored to have 6 Elizabeth Taylor films in our library, waiting for your in glorious HD on the all new Warner Archive, available on desktop as well as Roku, Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, and Android.
