        "text": "GLENDALE: Elizabeth Taylor's family mourned the screen legend in a brief private funeral service at a California cemetery famous for being the final resting place of Hollywood celebrities, including her good friend Michael Jackson.\n\nInside the sprawling Forest Lawn Cemetery, barricades blocked access to the funeral Thursday, where about four dozen family members mourned the actress during a service that lasted about an hour, said police spokesman Tom Lorenz. Five black stretch limousines transported Taylor's family to and from the funeral, but no procession was held.\n\nThe service began 15 minutes after its announced start time in observance of Taylor's parting wish that her funeral start late, her publicist Sally Morrison said.\n\nTaylor had left instructions asking for the tardy start and had requested that someone announce, ''She even wanted to be late for her own funeral,'' Morrison said.\n\nTaylor died early Wednesday of congestive heart failure while surrounded by her four children at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she had been hospitalized for about six weeks.\n\nTaylor, who was infamously married eight times to seven husbands, converted to Judaism before her 1959 wedding to Eddie Fisher. Jewish customs call for a burial within 48 hours of death.\n\nThe roughly one-hour service began with poetry readings by actor Colin Farrell and Taylor's family members and included a trumpet performance of Amazing Grace by her grandson, Morrison said.\n\nThe casket was draped in gardenias, violets, and lilies of the valley before its interment in the cemetery's Great Mausoleum beneath a marble sculpture of an angel inspired by the work of Italian artist Michelangelo.\n\nBesides Jackson, the cemetery is the final resting place for such stars as Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, W.C. Fields, Red Skelton, Gracie Allen, Walt Disney and Nat King Cole.\n\nTaylor, the star of such films as ''BUtterfield 8,'' ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and ''Cleopatra,'' won three Academy Awards, including a special one for her humanitarian work. She was an ardent and early supporter of AIDS research, when HIV was new to the industry and beyond.\n\n''I admired Elizabeth Taylor enormously and feel heartsick losing her, especially with all of her charitable works,'' said Ann Berry, a fan and character actress who lives nearby and visited the cemetery with a friend to pay their respects to the star.\n\nSeveral television news crews documented the service from across the street while news helicopters swirled overhead and students got out of class at the nearby Cerritos Elementary School.\n\nSurvivors include Taylor's daughters Maria Burton-Carson and Liza Todd-Tivey, sons Christopher and Michael Wilding, 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\nTaylor's publicist said any details of a memorial service would likely be announced at a later date. – AP"
