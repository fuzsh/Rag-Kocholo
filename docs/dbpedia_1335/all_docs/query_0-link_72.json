        "text": "Mbombela Stadium, Nelspruit (02-09-2011, 19:10 GMT)\n\nThe MTN Golden Lions needed a late try to beat the Ford Pumas in the opening Absa Currie Cup fixture this season and John Mitchell's men will travel to the Mbombela Stadium knowing they can't underestimate the team from Mpumalanga.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Vodacom Blue Bulls had to work very hard to beat the Pumas in Nelspruit, while GWK Griquas also found the going tough in the Mbombela Stadium in July.\n\nJimmy Stonehouse, coach of the Ford Pumas, said it's good to be welcoming back experienced players like their flank and captain, CornÃ© Steenkamp, prop Dawie Steyn and scrumhalf Shaun Venter, who have all been out injured.\n\n\"We've been struggling with injuries, but these players are basically all fit again and it's great to have them back, as they form an experienced core for us. But even with them back, it won't be easy,\" said Stonehouse.\n\n\"The Golden Lions top the log and even though they've had their fair share of luck, but have been on the winning side in six of their matches, which brings confidence. That will only increase the pressure on us.\"\n\nAs Stonehouse points out, the Ford Pumas' season turned around in the second round in 2010, when they beat the Blue Bulls and Golden Lions, and they will be hoping for more of the same this season.\n\n\"If we can limit our mistakes and play with confidence, we can do it again. We only just lost to the Lions in the first round and with the injured players back, we'll be ready for them in Nelspruit this weekend,\" said Stonehouse.\n\nFord Pumas vs MTN Golden Lions\n\nDate: Friday, 2 September\n\nKick-off: 19:10\n\nVenue: Mbombela Stadium, Nelspruit\n\nReferee: Jason Jaftha\n\nLast three meetings in Absa Currie Cup:\n\n• 20 August 2010: MTN Golden Lions won 33-30 in Witbank\n\n• 8 October 2010: Ford Pumas won 34-27 in Johannesburg\n\n• 15 July 2011: MTN Golden Lions won 31-27 in Johannesburg\n\nPumas: 15.

Marius Coetzer, 4. Rudi Mathee, 3. Ashley Buys, 2. Pellow van der Westhuizen, 1. Dawie Steyn\n\nReplacements: 16. Torsten van Jaarsveld, 17. De-Jay Terblanche, 18. Willem Serfontein, 19.

They will put up a good fight, but I doubt the Lions will get anything less than 5 points here.\n\nI can't tell whether or not the Pumas are happy with their performance against the Bulls, they would be happy because they put in a good shift, but would be disappointed as the Bulls were there for the taking.\n\nPumas\n\nTeam: 15. MJ Mentz, 14. Wilhelm Hendrik Loock, 13. JW Jonker, 12. Tian Carel Meyer, 11. Deon Scholtz, 10. Coenie van Wyk, 9. Shaun Venter, 8. Christo le Roux, 7. Jaco Bouwer, 6. Corne Steenkamp (Captain), 5.

Burton Francis\n\nThe Game: A little error ridden, but good enough start.\n\nLions being a little cocky though, Pumas putting huge pressure on them by quickly pushing up on defence, Lions trying to run everything doesn't help\n\nOoooof, Lionel Mapoe with a dislocated shoulder, ouch..."
