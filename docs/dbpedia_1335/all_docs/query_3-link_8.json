        "text": "Christiaan Bezuidenhout clinched a second European Tour crown on Sunday when he won the 2020 Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek, writes ANDRE HUISAMEN.\n\nBezuidenhout started the final round in 3rd spot behind Jayden Schaper and Poland’s Adrian Meronk, who initially appeared to be the two contenders set to battle it out for the win.\n\nAnd, despite Schaper moving to the top of the leaderboard on his own at a stage during the final round, it was the consistency and focus of Bezuidenhout that guided him to a four-shot victory.\n\n‘I’m really pleased I pulled it off,’ said a delighted Bezuidenhout.\n\n‘Leopard Creek has always been a special place for me, and the golf course this week was immaculate. You don’t get much better than this. I’ve always wanted to win this tournament.’\n\nThe 26-year-old took his chance on the back nine after a slow start to his final round at the event with key birdies on the 14th and 15th holes to edge this nose in front.\n\nREAD: Schaper one behind at Leopard Creek\n\nDrop shots by Schaper and Meronk saw them struggle to keep a grip on the summit of the leaderboard with American Sean Crocker making a late charge before dropping shots on the final hole.\n\nBut, in the end it was Bezuidenhout, who showed the most grid and determination in what was an emphatic performance over the past four days.\n\n‘I thought after that double bogey on seven it would be tough to come back from there,’ he added.\n\n‘It was tough out there. We played in a two-club wind that was swirling all over the place. You stood over your ball and it was downwind, and then when you hit it was suddenly into the wind. The pins were also tucked away on the greens. I just tried to play clever golf today. But all credit to my caddie. He stuck in there with me today and we pulled it through together.’\n\nThe Sunshine Tour and European Tour South African Swing travels to Sun City this coming week for the South African Open at the Gary Player Country Club."
