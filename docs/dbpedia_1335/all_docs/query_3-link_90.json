        "text": "The host team from all across America recovered from a lackluster Saturday. It put on a singles show on Sunday, winning 6.5 of 12 points from Team World. The final tally at the 2022 Presidents Cup was 17.5 to 12.5 for the Red, White, and Blue. There were two sides to this presidential coin, however. Days one and two saw Team World dig an inescapable hole, dropping eight of ten points. Days three and four saw the two teams play essentially even. Despite a few premature obituaries from some of our celebrated golf pundits, the Presidents Cup is alive and well. 2024 sees the tournament reach Canada for the first time, at the Royal Montreal Golf Club. Chances are that it will feel like a home game for the USA, unless the locals spike the poutine. That event is two years off, however, so let’s have one last look at the Sunday Singles, courtesy of my Saturday evening predictions.\n\nCorrect ~ Match One: Justin Thomas vs. Si Woo Kim\n\nSi Woo says See-You to JT and Team World gets to 8-11\n\nDid I know that Justin Thomas would demonstrate ignorance by conceding himself a putt? Nay. I just had a feeling that this battle of Players Champions would fall to the South Korean juggernaut. Thomas was two-up at the turn, but lost 10 and 11 to fall back to even. To their credit, both players went for broke, and the final seven holes saw five outright wins. Kim banged home a birdie at the last to eke out a 1-up victory.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Two: Spieth vs. Davis\n\nCam Davis dispatches Spieth and it’s now a two-point affair\n\nThis was the must-have match for Team World, and Cam Davis came out like he understood the plan. Wins at the first two holes had Jordan Spieth on the ropes, but the Texan responded like Spieth. His putter ignited with volcanic heat, and he proceeded to make nearly everything he looked at on the frog hair. Spieth squared the match at the fifth, fell behind at the eighth, and squared again at the ninth. On the inward side, he turned out the lights. A birdie-birdie-birdie-par run from 11 to 14 gave him a 4-up lead, and he sealed the deal with a par at the 15th.\n\nCorrect ~ Match Three: Burns vs. Matsuyama\n\nBurns and Hideki trade 14 birdies and end up tied. 9.5 to 11.5\n\nWell, it was only eight birdies, and Hideki even won a hole with a bogey. In the end, he almost pulled a Jordan Spieth out of his hat, with a chip-in at the last. The ball stayed out and the match stayed even. Do you know how hard it is to predict a tied match? Pretty hard!\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Four: Cantlay vs. Scott\n\nAnother massive upset, as one-major beats none-major and Team World is just one back.\n\nAdam Scott’s point was also a necessary one, but pars weren’t going to get it done against Captain Cantlay. The American went out in one-under par, and somehow built a two-up advantage over Scott’s even par. How does match play work again? Oh, right, like that. On the back nine, Scott did his level-best to strike, but he is no longer the Adam Scott of old, the major champion. Cantlay’s golf was equally uninspired, and the match ended at 3 & 2, after both players made par at the 16th.\n\nCorrect ~ Match Five: Scheffler vs. Muñoz\n\nColombia’s pride does some accordion-inspired Vallenato all the way to a personal Encanto, and the\n\ngame is tied!\n\nScottie Scheffler had a whale of a 2022. His first win and first major win, and the world number-one ranking all reached his doorstep. To allow him a week of exhaustion is just fine, but let’s not minimize the effort put forth by SebMu. The Colombian watched his opponent win three of the first six holes and jump out to a two-up lead. Muñoz won eight, nine, and ten, to flip the script. From there on out, he was rock-solid and claimed a much-needed point for the visiting side.\n\nCorrect ~ Match Six: Finau vs. Pendrith\n\nTony Two-Step takes down Maple Leaf One to stem the international tide. It’s 12.5-11.5 for the hosts.\n\nIt was a rotten week for the Maple Leaf. Pendrith couldn’t do much as a partner to anyone, and he had no answer for Finau’s finesse over the closing stretch of holes. Finau followed up a successful individual season with a strong team performance. He’ll look back on 2022 and smile.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Seven: Schauffele vs. Conners\n\nCorey Conners vindicates Taylor Pendrith, and Team Canada scores one for the globe. Tied again.\n\nThese guys played some rotten golf over the first nine holes, at +2 and even par. They followed that up with more rotten golf on the inward half, posting matching even-par totals. It was an uninspired match that fell to the USA side. A point that could have kept Team World in the equation, somehow got away. Hopefully Conners will learn and grow, and be a grizzly bear in Montreal, in two-years time.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Eight: Young vs. Im\n\nCameron Young wins because he and I are both Demon Deacons, and that is all that needs to be said.\n\n13.5-12.5\n\nEasily my least-logical and most-emotional prophecy was … almost correct. Young rolled out of bed on the fourth tee and found himself three down, after three consecutive bogeys. From there, the legend of Sleepy Hollow gritted his teeth and ground his way back to even, by the eighth hole. A dogfight ensued, with Im winning two holes, and Young but one, down the home stretch. Still, #GoDeacs.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Nine: KH Lee vs. BillyHo\n\nOK, back to cloudy logic. Billy Horschel is a grinder, and he finds a way to split his match with KH\n\nLee. 14 to 13 with two matches left.\n\nSorry, no video on this one. Go figure. Horschel was plus-two on the day when he conceeded the 17th hole to KH Lee, and his match went to the Korean by a tally of 3 & 1. Lee was one-under on the day, so by this juncture, we can conclude one of the following: Quail Hollow was an absolute bear on day four, or the teams were absolutely exhausted.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Ten: Homa vs. Tom Kim\n\nThere is a reason that this match is so late. Homa and Kim find three eagles and ten birdies around\n\nthe course, and TK delivers a TKO and squares the matches.\n\nMax Homa has remade his persona. From Captain Twitter, the Californian just might become the next Captain America. Homa had a taste of international team play at the 2013 Walker Cup at National Golf Links of America. Now, the lad looks like he is here to stay. A team without Homa is like a day without … victories. Tom Kim tossed everything he had at the Burbank bombardier, and it just wasn’t enough. It was another one of those last-hole losses that doomed the visiting squad.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Eleven: Morikawa vs. Pereira\n\nMorikawa has a PGA Champinship, while Pereira came oh-so-close at Southern Hill. The tables turn\n\nand the pride of Chile outlasts the two-time major winner. For the first time, Team World takes the\n\nlead.\n\nAnother upset special that didn’t pan out. We finally saw some electric golf on Sunday. Morikawa had three birdies, one eagle, and five pars on the outward half, and poor Pereira could just stand there and shake his head. Mito was one-under himself, but was three-down in the match. He went four-down at the 10th to another Morikawa birdie, and the end was in sight. The match finished 3 & 2 for the American, as he notched his sixth birdie on the day at hole 16.\n\nIncorrect ~ Match Twelve: Kisner vs. Bezuidenhout\n\nKisner, the match-play specialist, faces the grittiest, South African golfer ever. The Christiaan with two As makes one ace in the final match, ties Kisner, and wins the Presidents Cup for Team Globe.\n\nAnother one with no video, so we’ll try to paint you a picture. You know, a thousand words are worth a picture, or something like that. I think that we’ve read the last of Kevin Kisner is a match play god and he should be on international teams. He might be that at the Dell, but he ain’t that with a team USA kit on. Bezuidenhout played even-par golf through 17 holes, essentially daring Kisner to out-duel him. Didn’t happen, and CBez snared a point for Team World.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE1\n\nLEGIT0\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP0\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK0\n\nIn 2016, at the Olympic Games in Rio, Golf’s reintroduction as an Olympic sport stood as a landmark moment in the game’s storied history, marking its evolving recognition and global importance. That development was not only significant in terms of the prestige it brings, but it crucially validates golf’s status as a sport that resonates across different cultures and geographies.\n\nBeing part of the Olympics magnifies golf’s global appeal. While the sport has long-standing traditions in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, the Olympic Games expose it to a broader, more diverse audience. Countries where golf is not typically popular are more likely to take notice when their athletes compete on this grand stage. This visibility can spark interest and investment in the sport in regions previously untapped by golf’s reach.\n\nThe Olympic stage provides an unparalleled level of attention and viewership. Billions tune in to watch the Olympics, meaning millions who may have never watched a golf tournament are introduced to the sport. This exposure is invaluable for attracting new players, particularly young ones. For a sport often perceived as elitist or inaccessible, showcasing golf in the democratic, unifying context of the Olympics helps alter these stereotypes.\n\nThe Olympic spotlight helps emphasize the sheer athletic prowess required in golf. It highlights the focus, precision, and mental endurance necessary to excel, aligning golf with other sports celebrated for their physical demands. Golfers can now be recognized not just as skilled athletes within their own circles but as part of a broader community of world-class competitors.\n\nGolf’s Olympic inclusion also presents opportunities for countries to invest in developing their athletes. With the incentive of Olympic glory, nations are more likely to fund training programs, build facilities, and support golf associations dedicated to nurturing young talent. This, in turn, leads to higher competitive standards and a richer diversity of playing styles and personalities in the sport.\n\nThe return of golf to the Olympics—starting in 2016 after a 112-year hiatus—also provided seasoned professionals and emerging talents the opportunity to compete in a team dynamic distinct from traditional tournaments. Playing for one’s country adds a layer of passion and a sense of duty, often resulting in compelling performances that resonate deeply with fans.\n\nGolf’s inclusion in the Olympics bolsters its global presence, attracts diverse new audiences, and provides a platform to showcase the athletic demands of the sport. It injects fresh enthusiasm into the golfing world, inspiring nations to nurture their golfing talent, thus enriching the game’s global tapestry. This milestone symbolizes much more than a place in the competitions; it represents an expansive future for golf as a universally celebrated sport.\n\nAs John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s Chief Championships Officer and Board Chair for USA Golf, told me in an interview I conducted for RG.org,\n\n“Golf as part of the Olympic Games has and should continue to grow and inspire the game, especially as governments provide funding for the sport in their country to encourage medal-winning.\n\n“For golf to maintain its success on the Olympic stage, it is crucial to ensure that the best players participate, fans attend the on-site competition, and viewers across various media platforms tune in. These metrics are key to sustaining the sport’s relevance and appeal in the Olympic context.”\n\nWatching the golf competition at the Paris Olympics is a must if you are a fan of sports and competitions at the highest level. Whether it’s a replay of the Men’s competition or tuning in live this week for the Women, Olympic Golf promises thrilling action with top golfers from around the globe showcasing their skills on a world-class course. The strategic challenges and picturesque landscapes of Paris’s Le Golf National Golf Course offer an extra layer of excitement.\n\nWith the Olympics’ spirit of unity and excellence, the golf competition offers a unique opportunity to witness historical moments and intense yet friendly rivalries take place at an incredible venue. Whether you’re a seasoned golf fan or new to the sport, golf at the Paris Olympics is an unforgettable experience that combines athletic prowess, global representation, and a cultural celebration—all in the spirit of this ancient game we call golf.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE1\n\nLEGIT2\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT1\n\nFLOP1\n\nOB2\n\nSHANK1\n\nI began to write the introductory paragraph for Friday as the back nine started to unfold. It looked like this: Round three was a tale of two cities: those who pushed farther, and those who did not. The leaders needed to push deeper, into the mid-60s, to preserve their margin of advantage. They failed to do as much. The chasers needed to go lower, to rein in the lead pack and give themselves a shot on Sunday. They did precisely that.\n\nOh, wait, scratch that. The 18th hole happened for some, and other, inward holes happened for others. That back nine at Le Golf National reveals some new face with each round played. One leader played it with just two pars. Two leaders made eagle three at the last.\n\nHeading into round four, two co-leaders sit on minus-nine, with two more at minus-seven, and one more, another shot back. We learned about twenty things in the last half hour of play, but I’ll distill them down to a handful. Let’s take a look at the five things we learned on day three of the Paris 2024 Olympic Women’s golf competition.\n\n1. Who stumbled?\n\nRuoning Yin (+3) and Pia Babnik (+2) did themselves no favors on Friday. Yin had six bogies on the day, while Babnik came undone at the 15th with a quadruple bogey. Each of Yin’s lost shots began with a drive lost to the rough. As for Babnik, her drive and first approach each found water on the 15th hole. Unsettled, she took another four shots to find cup bottom. Yin is five back of the leaders, while Babnik is seven behind. Logic suggests that each would need a course record to earn a place on the podium; with nothing to lose, either might go for broke and find riches.\n\n2. Who soared?\n\nLydia Ko and Miya Yamashita each posted 68 on day three. Ko lost two shots to wayward approach shots. At holes seven and twelve, she found the fairway off the tee, then foozled her inward play. She made up for those mistakes in spades with six birdies. Most important: she avoided all of the H2O coming home. Yamashita signed for the day’s most boring scorecard. Four birdies, fourteen pars, no traipses along the cliffs of doom, no swims in the ponds. Precisely the sort of play that might win her a medal on Sunday. Ko moved to a tie for first, while Yamashita holds down a tie for third.\n\nJust behind each is Atthaya Thitikul of Thailand. Thitikul nearly matched those 68s with a 69 of her own. An erratic outward nine of three pars, birdies, and bogies, was followed by a homeward side of three birdies and zero bogies. A missed putt from 12 feet at the last brough Thitikul into solo sixth position, at six under par.\n\n3. Fly like an Eagle, Eagle, Eagle\n\nSecond-round leader Morgane Metraux was stitching, leaking oil, building up lactic acid … whatever you wish to call it. Three bogies over holes ten through thirteen had her wondering, do I have what it takes? Birdie at the 14th stanched the wound, and came 18. A mighty eagle at the home hole, thanks to a fairway drive and an approach to twenty feet, brought her up to a tie with Lydia Ko for the pole position.\n\nIf Metraux is able to ignore, and even forget, her position on day four, she might steal a medal on Saturday. As with the stumblers, nothing offers more opportunity for success, than a go-for-broke attitude over the final eighteen holes.\n\n4. Topsy-Turvy\n\nCeline Boutier carries more weight of expectation than anyone not named Nelly this week. After opening with 65, the French hope has struggled over two days. She recovered on Friday with one-under 71, but finds herself in a tie for seventh, five back of the leading duo.\n\nNothing defines Boutier’s current state of affairs like her second nine on day the third. She opened positively, with par and two birdies setting her up for a fine finish. Triple bogey at 13 derailed that engine, and bogey at the 15th threatened to send it back to the yard. Boutier breathed deep and dug deeper, closing with birdies at the final three holes, to head to day the fourth with optimism.\n\n5. Who is dangerous on Saturday?\n\nBoutier could potentially bookedn 65s. If she did so, she could reach the podium. Nelly Korda has not gone below 70 yet, so Sunday portends to either be 62 or 82. If she is oh-so-close and can flip the switch, watch out. If she is oh-so-frustrated and loses composure, duck. Either way, she’ll provide some memorable, day-four moments.\n\nI also conside Thitikul to be dangerous on Saturday, and Janet Lin’s stock is rising. Despite all those fine names, I’m going to predict an Andean triumph at Paris. Mariajo Uribe will ride off into the international sunset with a closing 63, and gold medal draped around her neck, cloaked in a Colombian flag.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE0\n\nLEGIT0\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP0\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK0\n\nWe can toss all the expectations out the window, after day two. The home-country, day-one leader ballooned to a 76 on Thursday, and fell five shots off the pace, tied for sixth. There’s no more room for error for Celine Boutier. Higher than three-under each of the next two days won’t get the job done. One player posted 65 and two more signed for 66, so the opportunity was there. Astonishingly, the 18th seems to play more difficult as a par five, than it did as a par four. Players found the right rough and sand with regularity, and struggled to reach the green in three from that position.\n\nLe Golf National is proving to be a different beast this week. The 61s and 62s posted a week ago seem out of reach, and it will take a blend of restraint and bravery to win the week. Remember, too, that two of the leaders through day two of the men’s competition ended up winning medals, but those were seasoned winners on their tours. Of the top five in the women’s bracket, three are unproven competitors, with varying years of service to the guild.\n\nLet’s run down what we do know at this juncture, and restrict ourselves to five things from round two at the Paris 2024 Women’s Olympic golf competition, holes 19 through 36.\n\n1. Morgane Metraux\n\nThankfully, this Swiss golfer has a wikipedia page. That saves a lot of guesswork and supposition. We know that she has two LET wins, and one on the Symetra Tour. Metraux studied and competed at Florida State, then turned professional. Success has not come her way on the LPGA circuit, so victory at the Olympic Games seems to be quite a reach for a first big win. Two eagles and four birdies on the outward half, staked the Alpine queen to a 28 and visions of a really low number. She came home in plus-one, which wasn’t half bad, and posted the day’s second-low round of 66.\n\n2. Ruoning Yin\n\nAs if we needed any more uncertainty, meet Ruoning Yin. She holds three LPGA titles. One is a major (the PGA) and another came in a team event (counts but doesn’t count.) The third was a regular tour event. Two came in 2023, and the partner affair came this season. Can Yin win? Yes. Does she do so with enough regularity, to frame her as the favorite? Absolutely not.\n\nYin avoided the two bogeys posted by Metraux, and her seven birdies gave her the day’s low round, and a hold on second place. She finds herself one back of the leader, and two ahead of third place. If round-one Ruoning (equal birdies and bogeys) returns on Friday, she might falter. If round-two Yin sticks around, she might be your leader on day three eve.\n\n3. Lydia Ko\n\nPeople are making a big deal out of Olympic Lydia, given that she has earned a medal in each of the previous two golf competitions. She lacks the gold, and would love to win it, but any medal is spectacular. Ko makes her birdies early at Le Golf National, then hangs on for life over the closing stretch. A two-under or three-under run on Friday, over the final six holes, would give her confidence a boost, heading into day four. Bogey at the last on day two, after she made birdie there on day one, had to be a balloon-popper.\n\n4. Mariajo and Pia\n\nHow unlikely to feature, is either Mariajo Uribe of Colombia, or Pia Babnik of Slovenia? There’s zero footage of their play from day two. We had to go back to the Ladies European Tour to find a swing clip of Babnik. She did her best Rory Sabbatini (the other famous Slovenian golf olympian) impression, posting seven birdies on the day. Five came consecutively, showing that she is capable of riding a wave of good vibes and great play. As for Uribe, just another 70. HOWEVER, she has made birdie at the diabolical 18th both days, and that should count for a lot, if she is in the hunt come Sunday.\n\n5. Celine Boutier\n\nWe know that Celine Boutier can win tournaments. This time in 2023, she got herself on a hot streak, and rode it to a world number one ranking. This week, she has experienced highs and lows at Le Golf National. The question on which she will sleep, is whether she can recapture the dominance of day one. If she is able to post another 65 on day three, and reach double-digits under par, she will be in the mix on Saturday.\n\nBoutier was in decent shape at the 13th tee. By the fifteenth green, she had returned five shots to the field, and lost confidence in nearly everything. She managed to par her way home, but will need a short memory on day three, to right the ship.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE0\n\nLEGIT0\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP0\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK0"
