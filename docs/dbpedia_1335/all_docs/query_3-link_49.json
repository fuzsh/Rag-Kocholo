        "text": "“We’ve got to make sure we rock up and not take things for granted.” – Quinton de Kock on playing against the Netherlands.\n\nTelford Vice / Cape Town\n\nTHERE’S an orange elephant in South Africa’s dressing room. The last time they played the Netherlands, at the men’s T20 World Cup in Adelaide in November, the minnows leapt like salmon and did the unthinkable: they won.\n\nIt was the Dutch’s first victory over South Africa in the six completed matches the teams have contested in both white-ball formats, and it took Temba Bavuma’s side out of the running to reach the semifinals. Now the Netherlands are back in South Africa’s sights and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nThe home side need to win the World Cup Super League (WCSL) ODIs they will play against the Dutch in Benoni on Friday and at the Wanderers on Sunday to stay on the straight and narrow path to direct qualification for the World Cup in India in October and November.\n\nCurrently that appears probable. If South Africa win both games all that could stand in their way would be a 3-0 win for Ireland over Bangladesh at Chelmsford in May, which seems unlikely. But missteps against the Netherlands — because of performance or their perennial bugbear of overrate violations, or the weather, what with rain forecast for both games — would impede the South Africans’ progress.\n\nShould they not finish among the top eight teams in the WCSL standings, which will be complete after the Ireland-Bangladesh series, they will have to scrap it out at a qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe in June and July — where 10 teams will compete for the last two World Cup places.\n\nThat prospect seemed to horrify Quinton de Kock at his press conference in Benoni on Thursday: “I am going to give it my absolute best not to go to Zim for the qualifiers.”\n\nThe Dutch could be said to be doing their bit to ensure De Kock gets his wish. Four of their most prominent players have left the squad that went down 2-1 in Zimbabwe last week and their coaching staff has been significantly impacted by alternative commitments, as detailed in the team news below. Indeed, as they are in last place in the WCSL standings and resigned to going to the qualifier, it might be in the Netherlands’ best interests to avoid having to deal with a bunch of determined South Africans in Zimbabwe.\n\nWillowmoore Park, less a Cinderella among cricket grounds than an ugly sister, is an odd stage for so important a match. South Africa last played there in September 2016, when they beat Ireland by 206 runs in an ODI. Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius made their international debuts, and Bavuma earned his first ODI cap. Phehlukwayo hasn’t featured in South Africa’s last 18 matches across the formats and Pretorius has retired internationally. Bavuma, who scored 113 in that 2016 game, is now South Africa’s Test and ODI captain.\n\nMore pertinently, while South Africa have changed captains and coaches since the Adelaide awfulness, their results haven’t improved. They also haven’t deteriorated. Of the 13 completed matches they’ve played since then they’ve won six — exactly as many as they won in their 13 games before Adelaide. Maybe there are also elephants of other colours going nowhere slowly in their dressing room.\n\nWhen: March 31 and April 2, 2023; 1pm and 10am Local Time (4.30pm and 1.30pm IST)\n\nWhere: Willowmoore Park, Benoni; The Wanderers, Johannesburg\n\nWhat to expect: Rain. An 88% chance of showers and thunderstorms has been forecast for both cities on both days. Willowmoore Park is famously flat and small; Denis Compton scored 300 in a minute more than three hours there in December 1948. The Wanderers is also small, but batters are tested by the bounce.\n\nTeam news:\n\nSouth Africa: Temba Bavuma passed a fitness test on his tweaked hamstring on Thursday, but then left the practice session because of, team management said, “a family matter that arose during training today”. Despite that his availability for Friday’s game has been confirmed.\n\nPossible XI: Quinton de Kock, Temba Bavuma (capt), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, Marco Jansen, Wayne Parnell, Bjorn Fortuin, Kagiso Rabada, Gerald Coetzee, Lungi Ngidi\n\nThe Netherlands: Roelof van der Merwe has left the squad due to personal reasons, Colin Ackermann, Brandon Glover and Bas de Leede are out because of county commitments, and head coach Ryan Cook has gone to the IPL. Former South Africa and Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo has joined the staff in a temporary capacity.\n\nPossible XI: Vikramjit Singh, Max O’Dowd, Musa Ahmed, Tom Cooper, Wesley Barresi, Scott Edwards (capt), Teja Nidamanuru, Shariz Ahmad, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren, Fred Klaassen\n\nWhat they said:\n\n“That was just a really bad day for us as players and for South Africans in general. It was sad it had to be that game. Before that we had played pretty good cricket, as we are doing now. We’ve got to make sure we rock up and not take things for granted; that we’re firing on all cylinders.” — Quinton de Kock on South Africa’s day of infamy in Adelaide.\n\n“Fifty-over cricket presents a different challenge for us. They’re a world class side with a lot of world class players, so we’ve just got to find a way to put our plans in place to get them out and to make runs to give ourselves the best chance of beating them.” — Scott Edwards says his players won’t remind the South Africans about the previous time the teams met.\n\nCricbuzz\n\n“We are generally more aggressive types of players; the white-ball formats suit our style of play.” – Shai Hope\n\nTelford Vice / Cape Town\n\nON the road in bilateral series against tougher opposition, the real West Indies men’s team stand up more often in T20Is than in Tests or ODIs. That’s not an opinion.\n\nWest Indies haven’t won a Test series in Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan — or the United Arab Emirates — South Africa or Sri Lanka since they beat the Kiwis in February 1995. That’s more than 28 years in which they have played 37 series in those countries comprising 115 Tests, of which they have won only nine while losing 87.\n\nThe Windies’ drought in bilateral ODI rubbers in the backyard of decent teams isn’t as long. But it still goes back to July 2007, when they won in England. Since then they have played 77 matches, won 10 and lost 61.\n\nTheir T20I record sticks out like a robust thumb on a weak hand. West Indies have played 23 series in the countries above and won five of them, and all since they last claimed an away rubber against those teams in the other two formats. That adds up to 60 games, of which they have won 16 and lost 39.\n\nThe Windies’ winning percentage in T20Is in these terms — 26.67% — is exponentially better than in ODIs — 12.99% — or Tests — 7.83%. Essentially, they have been almost three-and-a-half times as successful in away T20Is against quality sides compared to Tests since that 1995 series in New Zealand, and more than twice as much in T20Is than ODIs since they won in England in 2007.\n\nOverall, home and away and regardless of the strength of their opponents, and since they played their first T20I in February 2006, West Indies have won 22.76% of their Tests, 36.56% of their ODIs, and 40.78% of their T20Is. It’s safe to say their premier format is T20I. Or at least that they have become white-ball specialists.\n\nAlzarri Joseph was unconvinced: “I would not think so. I think we still prioritise the longer format. These days a lot more white-ball cricket is being played than Test cricket, so that’s maybe why you would see it that way.”\n\nThat’s a difficult argument to make. Joseph spoke at a press conference at the Wanderers on Tuesday after his team had beaten South Africa by seven runs to clinch the T20I series 2-1. The ODI rubber, in which the first match was lost to rain, was drawn 1-1 and South Africa won both Tests. It is true that the Windies play fewer Tests in the modern game, but just as valid that they are a better team in the other formats, T20I in particular.\n\nWest Indies have never topped the Test rankings since they were introduced in June 2003. If the formula is applied retroactively, the last time they would have been the No. 1 team was in August 1995. They won the first two World Cups, in 1975 and 1979, but haven’t earned that title since. Their T20I World Cup triumphs have been more recent — in 2012 and 2016.\n\n“I can’t hundred percent put my finger on it, but I do think we are generally more aggressive types of players; the white-ball formats suit our style of play,” Shai Hope, the ODI captain, said after that series. “But we need to find ways to adapt regardless of the format or the situation of the game. We need to create winning habits, and the only way we can do so is by winning games.”\n\nRovman Powell, the T20I captain, thought he saw that kind of change coming: “As the years go by and the guys start playing more and get familiar with their role for West Indies, hopefully we’ll get better performances. The guys are working hard to change the perception that West Indies aren’t the best international team at the moment. Hopefully this [T20I] series can be the start of people realising that West Indies cricket is slowly but surely getting back to where it truly belongs.”\n\nBy that he was probably talking about the 10 years that began with the Windies’ Test series in England in 1976. By April 1986, they had lost only six, and won 38, of the 78 Tests they had played in that period. But the deep maroon of the caps worn then has faded to an insipid marshmallow pink, the T20I version excepted.\n\nThe South Africans would do well to consider the experience of the most recent visitors a cautionary tale. They don’t want to wake up one day to find the bold green of their caps looking like thoroughly chewed and discarded spearmint gum.\n\nAs South Africa’s new white-ball coach, Rob Walter is tasked with stopping that from happening. Although South Africa have won only two of the five games with him in their dugout, a fresh positivity has been apparent in their approach. In Centurion on Sunday they chased down a world record target of 259 to win the second T20I, and they had the misfortune of being up against a team almost impervious to pressure at the Wanderers two days later — where the visitors piled up 222/8 in the series decider.\n\n“We’re certainly making progress in how we want to play the game,” Walter told a press conference on Tuesday. “It’s good to see the guys playing with freedom and expressing their skills, and there’s more in the tank I believe.”\n\nWas that his doing? “I would be very arrogant to say I’ve had a significant impact in this short space of time. It’s about being consistent with the language I use with the team, and that is consistently telling them to find ways to express themselves, to take aggressive options — when they feel under pressure to think what is the aggressive option they have in their strengths — and then back that. If they do that and it doesn’t work we can deal with it, but more often than not it does.”\n\nWalter’s and his team’s looming challenge is to beat the Netherlands in their World Cup Super League fixtures in Benoni on Friday and at the Wanderers on Sunday. The Dutch are bona fide minnows but they got up to beat South Africa, and eliminate them from the race for the T20 World Cup semifinals, in Adelaide in November. Victory in the coming games is vital for South Africa’s hopes of qualifying directly for the ODI World Cup in India in October and November.\n\nWhat could Walter’s players take from the way they had performed against the West Indians? “Confidence is transferrable. It’s the only thing you take into the [next] game. The batter’s on nought and the bowler’s got the ball in their hand for the first time again. It will be no different on Friday.”\n\nThat, too, is not an opinion.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

As a bowler you’re always getting hit.” – Sisanda Magala on his five-ball 18 not out.\n\nTelford Vice / Cape Town\n\nIN the afterglow of what happened in Centurion on Sunday, best this is said softly: Saturday’s match was better. The notion seems diabolical. What’s not to like about two scintillating centuries and a slew of records? How does that not top a game reduced to 11 overs a side?\n\nSaturday’s match didn’t rock and roll with runs at the same volume as Sunday’s, when batting was taken to new heights of sustained intensity. But Saturday delivered a keener contest. Which do you prefer — runs raining down, or a decent game after the rain?\n\nOn Saturday the result was in the balance until Rovman Powell hit Bjorn Fortuin for three sixes and a four to leave 20 runs required off the last 18 deliveries. The Windies got home with three balls to spare. Sunday’s match was all but decided after Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks shared 152 off 65 to start South Africa’s pursuit of a world record target of 259, which they reached with seven balls remaining. Clearly they took seriously what Aiden Markram said after Saturday’s match: “Hopefully tomorrow we can start better; start on the right foot — with us batters at the top.”\n\nBoth games were excellent advertisements for white-ball cricket. But if you wanted to see pressure put on batters and not only on bowlers, Saturday gets your vote. Here’s what looks like evidence: the matches were played on the same pitch, but Saturday’s overall runrate was 12.23 and Sunday’s 13.30. A difference of 1.07 runs doesn’t sound like much, but that’s per over. It adds up to a significant lump of runs over the course of an innings — runs that weren’t scored because of the bowlers’ and fielders’ efforts.\n\nWhen they batted first South Africa went at 11.90 runs an over and West Indies at 12.57. That’s a divergence of 0.67 of a run — hardly decisive, but the sides each had nine fewer overs to negotiate on Saturday compared to Sunday.\n\nThe tidiest bowler on Saturday was Anrich Nortjé, whose 5.66 was the only economy rate under 10.00 in both innings. He was left out on Sunday, but it’s difficult to argue South Africa’s attack was weakened by the addition of Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen. Similarly, the visitors’ decision to omit Alzarri Joseph on Sunday was more than offset by the fact that he was replaced by Jason Holder.\n\nMaybe the 15 wickets that fell on Saturday put the brakes on the batters in relative terms. There’s nothing like the unedifying prospect of being bowled out inside 11 overs to make even the most attacking players reach for caution. Only nine wickets went down on Sunday, affording the batters a measure of security and fuelling aggressive strokeplay.\n\nThere’s no pressing reason to make these comparisons. We could enjoy both matches as structurally contrasting games of cricket without pitting them against each other in some kind of evolutionary struggle. But there could be an important reason behind the fact that West Indies scored only 0.33 fewer runs an over on Saturday than on Sunday. The difference between South Africa’s runrates was 1.85 — more than five-and-a-half times as big as their opponents’.\n\nCould that be ascribed to the West Indians’ firmer familiarity with T10 cricket? Seven members of their XI on Saturday played in the Abu Dhabi T10 in November and December. Five of the same players were in the six who featured 6ixty, a T10 competition in the Caribbean, in August last year. Of South Africa’s team, five were part of the Abu Dhabi T10. But only Heinrich Klaasen, who didn’t play in Abu Dhabi, was in the 6ixty.\n\n“It’s a bit chaotic, 11 overs; anything can happen,” Sisanda Magala told a press conference after Saturday’s blur of a game. “It’s tough to predict and plan, as you would in a T20. You have to learn on the fly and try your best to adapt to the situation.” That wasn’t to say he didn’t enjoy the experience. Magala bowled with intelligence as sharp as his skills to take 3/21, and then hammered an unbeaten 18 off five to help David Miller realise 47 off 13 for the seventh wicket. “It’s nice, just to return the favour — as a bowler, you’re always getting hit,” Magala said. “David is a very calming presence. He speaks very optimistically and he’s a very positive guy, so that rubs off on the way you want to play. It was good fun.”\n\nFor Powell T10 was “more compact” than T20. It was also licence to thrill: “You can lose a wicket every over and still keep hitting the ball hard. It’s a mindset.” That’s not entirely the case in the 6ixty, where teams are pronounced all out when their sixth wicket falls. The difference when all 10 wickets are in play was apparent in Centurion.\n\n“You can’t just hit good bowling for six, six, six,” Powell had said after Saturday’s match, in which two sixes were hit off as many balls twice, and two in three deliveries also twice. Powell was proved wrong on Sunday, when De Kock did indeed slam a hattrick of sixes off Sheldon Cottrell in the second over of South Africa’s reply. Then again, Cottrell wouldn’t have met Powell’s standard for “good bowling” in an over that sailed for 29 runs.\n\nThe way both games unfolded was the product, in large part, of the work done by Centurion groundskeeper Bryan Bloy and his team. Bloy was castigated for his first Centurion Test pitch, the match against India in January 2018, which lost a lot of its liveliness because of intense heat. But he won an award for his work during the SA20, and now he has the weekend’s games on his CV.\n\nSaturday’s match was better. Sunday’s was more emphatic. Take your pick. Or enjoy both equally and for different reasons. Who said T20 or T10 — or even T11 — was devoid of nuance?\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

Trust me, you’ve heard this before: the first-class game is the bedrock on which all good and true things must be built. Deviate from that dictum and you are doomed to disappointment.\n\nThe logic is that no cricketer, particularly those who bat for a living, can hope to succeed unless they have mastered the skills demanded in matches scheduled for at least three consecutive days.\n\nCharles played all manner of strokes in his 46-ball 118. His third century in the format but his first at international level flew off 39 balls, the fastest by a West Indian and joint second-fastest in T20I history. Had Johnson got there in five fewer deliveries he would have broken the world record.\n\nMany of the shots he played didn’t strain the envelope of the emphatic as much as rip it up. Most were also ripped in another way: from the pages of what the fogeys regard as the copyrighted first-class playbook. De Kock’s 44-ball 100, his first century for South Africa in the format and his sixth in T20s, also shimmered with audacity and orthodoxy in equal measure. It was also his first century for South Africa in the format and his sixth in T20s. He broke his own record for South Africa’s fastest 50 by getting there in 15 deliveries.\n\nCharles and De Kock reeled off what would have seemed, to the hapless few fated to have to bowl to them, a series of punchlines without jokes. Here’s another — Charles last played any first-class cricket in December 2016 and De Kock in February 2018, not counting Tests.\n\nCharles has yet to earn a Test cap, which is not surprising considering he has a first-class average of 20.79 with one century and three 50s after 65 innings. De Kock played his 54th and final Test in December 2021. He retired with six hundreds and 22 half-centuries from 91 trips to the crease.\n\nFor all the pyrotechnics of the 10 fours and 11 sixes that lit Charles’ innings, the stroke that will stick in the memory was his most exquisitely delicate: he shimmied far outside off to Marco Jansen in the 14th, aimed little more than a top edge at the ball, and deflected it deftly through fine leg for four.\n\nDe Kock’s finest shot was a crisp, contained punch down the ground for four off Sheldon Cottrell. It was one of nine boundaries he hit to go with his eight sixes, and it was unveiled with only the eighth ball he faced.\n\nCharles isn’t a Test or even a noted first-class player and De Kock has made clear his preference for pyjamas over whites. And yet they essayed their innings in the grand and ancient manner, only with more elegance and excellence than has in the past been enough to hail performances as exceptional. In the space of one Sunday afternoon Charles and De Kock took batting in any kind of cricket to a level it has rarely been, if ever. Where does all that leave the fogeys?\n\n“Cricket shots will always be cricket shots, because we’re playing cricket,” Charles told a press conference. “It’s not as if you could play a football shot in a cricket match. Guys are constantly evolving and learning how to go forward. It’s a beautiful sight. I’d love to see the game 10 years from now.”\n\nCharles has played 40 T20Is but he featured in none from September 2016 to October last year. That was in the wake of reaching 50 just twice in his previous 20 innings. His explanation for how he ended his six-year absence from the side offered further evidence that success in the format is about playing properly: “I’ve changed my game in that I’ve gone back to the basics, made sure that I’ve got that on the down low. It’s worked for me. If I continue to do that I’ll continue having great innings.”\n\nHe did acknowledge that “with such a good pitch and on a small field you don’t have to over-hit the ball”, but staving off the urge to do so takes discipline. Kyle Mayers and Charles delivered a masterclass in exactly that in their 58-ball stand of 135. Reeza Hendricks and De Kock followed their lead and shared 152 off 65.\n\nOn another day Hendricks’ 68 off 28 — a strike rate of 242.85 — would have won the match. On Sunday this comparatively understated performance all but flew under the radar. Aiden Markram referenced Hendricks’ batting in his television interview: “You talk about playing attacking cricket but that doesn’t mean you have to slog everything.” Also on television, De Kock had praise for his partner: “He was quite the silent assassin. We said to each other after he got out [in the 13th], ‘Jeez, we’ve done something special’.”\n\nIn his presser, Hendricks — cramp kept De Kock in the dressing room — fought his own corner: “T20 allows for normal cricket shots. It’s still your normal strokeplay. You don’t have to go out there and swing from the hips from ball one. T20 still allows for good cricket. Everyone who contributed today played really good cricket shots.”\n\nAnd they realised 517 runs, the highest aggregate in the 2,032 men’s T20Is yet played. Only six first innings have surpassed West Indies’ 258/5. No reply has been bigger than South Africa’s 259/4, reached with seven balls to spare. No team have hit more sixes in an innings than the Windies’ 22. No match at this level has delivered more sixes than Sunday’s 35, nor more fours than its 46. Never has a greater chunk of the runs in a T20I been hit in fours and sixes: 76.21%.\n\n“When we walked off the field [after West Indies’ innings] ‘KG’ said they’re 10 runs short,” Hendricks said. That drew parallels with Jacques Kallis’ comment during the innings break in a famous ODI at the Wanderers in June 2006, when Australia put up a then world record total of 434/4: “The bowlers have done their job. It’s up to the batters now.” South Africa replied with 438/9 with a ball remaining. Now the T20I version of South Africa’s team have their own magical number to celebrate. “I would say it’s equivalent to the 438 game, so to be part of it is a big deal,” Hendricks said.\n\nRovman Powell described the afternoon’s events as “pretty, pretty crazy”, and the madness was still swirling in the smoke thrown by the post-match fireworks when Bob Marley’s voice rang out over the ground: “Every little thing is going to be alright.” A member of the groundstaff danced in time to the music as he collected the circular white markers denoting the 30-metre circle on the outfield. He looked happy with what his and his colleagues’ efforts had produced, and so he should have. Everything was indeed alright.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

It’s just, ‘Bernie, eat more.’ Well, it’s not that easy. ‘Just stop running.’ It’s not that easy.” – Bernadine Bezuidenhout on living with Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport.\n\nTelford Vice / Cape Town\n\nBERNADINE Bezuidenhout might have been dead. She had picked up her best friend, Carolyn Esterhuizen, at Cape Town airport late one night in 2015, and as they drove along the highway and under a bridge a large rock was dropped onto their car.\n\n“I saw this massive boulder coming down,” Bezuidenhout told Cricbuzz. “It hit the side of my car and burst one of my front tyres. I’m from George, a small, safe town [430 kilometres east of Cape Town]. So I got out of the car and called my dad. Carolyn is a born-and-bred Capetonian. She said, ‘Get into your car! Look where we are!’\n\n“Two seconds after I had locked the doors two men came and bashed the windows and tried to get us out. I got the car into first gear and drove on the rim of the wheel with the burst tyre. I don’t think anyone could understand the fear that put into me.”\n\nBut there was more: “About a week-and-a-half later, in the middle of the day and the middle of the city, a guy tried to get into my car and pull me out. I decided I couldn’t live like that.”\n\nBezuidenhout played her last significant match in South Africa in Bloemfontein on April 10, 2015. Her next noteworthy game was in Whangãrei on November 25, 2016. Just 21 when she left South Africa, she had appeared in four ODIs and seven T20Is. She went to Christchurch, and has earned nine ODI and 13 T20I caps for New Zealand. How had she adjusted to her no longer new reality?\n\n“Christchurch is the best city in the world. It’s a city but yet it’s in the country; a city without the crazy traffic. It’s very …,” she paused to settle on the right word: “… peaceful. If I didn’t move then I probably wouldn’t at this stage of my life, when I’m more settled. But when you’re 21 you’re brave. New Zealand is home. It’s an amazing, beautiful country. We’re a family of five-and-a-half million people.”\n\nThe start of our interview, which was conducted over Zoom during the women’s T20 World Cup in South Africa in February, coincided with the beginning of one of the scheduled power blackouts that have become an almost daily bane of South Africans’ lives. That has been the case, at some times more than others, since 2007 — eight years before Bezuidenhout left the country. Her exasperation, which she expressed once batteries on both ends of our electronic equation had kicked in, showed how Kiwi she had become: “I can’t get used to this loadshedding thing! I don’t know how you guys live like this!”\n\nEven so, she is reminded she is not from New Zealand by her compatriots’ struggle to pronounce a surname common in South Africa. Similarly to Australians mangling Labuschagne — which has nothing to do with Shane — Kiwis tend to bastardise Bezuidenhout into Bezoodenhoot: “I don’t know how that zoo gets in there. It’s taken a lot of training. I’m like, ‘It’s ba-zay-den-hout; hout like boat.’ Then they get it.”\n\nBut that’s a small price to pay for uninterrupted electricity, exponentially less crime, and professional fairness: “We’re really blessed because there’s now equal match fees for women and men, in our domestic competitions as well. The girls are earning decent money playing cricket. NZC have gone out of their way to invest in the women’s game.”\n\nAnd there the story of Bezuidenhout’s cricket career might have reached its conclusion. Or will do when she retires a few years and many more matches into the future, adding to a record that, at 29, features two list A centuries and 11 50s, half-a-dozen T20 half-centuries, and 115 matches as one of the slickest wicketkeepers in the game. But, as she discovered during a doctor’s appointment with Lesley Nicol, the New Zealand netball great who is now a sport and exercise health expert, her life wasn’t going to be that simple. She had veered towards death again.\n\n“Lesley told me my bone density was like that of a 50-year-old woman. I was 26. I was in and out of hospital. She said if I accepted a contract and played another season, I wouldn’t make it through that season. My career would be done. I would never run again. I could die of a heart attack.”\n\nBezuidenhout had Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S. “Years and years of overtraining and underfuelling, that is what causes RED-S. I was training for seven hours a day and eating maybe 1,000 calories a day.” She sounds like a prime candidate to contract the condition: “I love exercise, I love the gym, I’m a health fanatic, I’m a nutritionist by training, I’ve always been super-driven. In cricket you can’t always control the outcome of things, but being the fittest person in the room was something I could control.”\n\nTo do so Bezuidenhout put herself on road to oblivion: “I remember being in Australia five years ago, and I was so sick I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat, I weighed 53 kilogrammes. I’d get some food in and vomit it out in the changeroom. It got to the point where I couldn’t digest food. It would sit in my stomach and just come out. I was eating 400 or 500 calories a day. This went on for three or four years. A lot of outsiders don’t understand. It’s just, ‘Bernie, eat more.’ Well, it’s not that easy. ‘Just stop running.’ It’s not that easy. It’s more mental than anything else.” Her period was part of what she lost along the way: “I was amenorrheac for 10 years, from when I was 18.”\n\nThe US-based National Library of Medicine says “amenorrhea is … common in female athletes, particularly those participating in aesthetic sports (ballet, other dance genres, figure-skating, and gymnastics) and endurance sports (cross-country running)”. Given the extremes to which Bezuidenhout subjected her body, it was no surprise that she fell victim.\n\nWomen are often prepared for matches by men, who cannot know what it is to be female in any environment, much less an intensely physical environment. “We’ve got to have honest conversations with our trainers,” Bezuidenhout said. “They need to be aware how to train female athletes around the menstrual cycle, because scientifically most studies are done on male athletes, and we know we’re different.” Would having more female trainers help? “Yes, or just male trainers who are willing to learn. There’s not enough information out there.”\n\nAlong with her period, Bezuidenhout’s career was taken from her. She didn’t play from January 28, 2020 to November 20, 2022. That’s an absence of 1,027 days, or more than enough time to convince yourself and those who care about you — personally and professionally — that you have moved on from cricket. “Me and Lesley had a very tough, honest conversation. She said, ‘Bernie’, you’re probably never going to play professionally again.’ There was no expectation. So I feel really privileged and grateful and — this is going to sound really cheesy — I don’t take anything for granted. You never know when’s the last time you’re going to play or represent your country.”\n\nBezuidenhout had plenty of time to contemplate that as a reality, and much else. “I think back on those two-and-a-half years, nearly three years, that I took off from cricket because of my RED-S as probably the most challenging but yet the best time of my life. I reflected on my career as a cricketer and everything that I was doing with my life. It gave me a chance to look at things from a different perspective.\n\n“As athletes we struggle with identity. ‘What are we going to do if we’re not playing?’ And, ‘If I’m not playing sport, who am I?’ I was always labelled this talented kid. There was always massive expectation. And when you reach international level and you’re ill and you’re still searching for more things in life, you think to yourself, ‘What more is there? What else can I do?’”\n\nWhen what you think is everything is taken away from you, do you see what really matters? “One hundred percent. Then you realise there’s so much more to life. I love the game of cricket. I’ve been playing since I was seven. But then you dig deeper, and find that there’s so much more to me than just being an athlete. I needed to find out what that was away from sport. For 90% of my life it was just Bernadine the athlete.”\n\nWhere did Bernadine the former athlete’s journey of discovery lead her? To jail. “It gave me an awesome opportunity to work with youth in prison. That gave me perspective. I was like, ‘Holy crap. I have so much to be grateful for. While I’m travelling the world we have kids who are committing suicide, who don’t have anybody.’ Now cricket is a hobby. Yes, I get paid for what I do, which is awesome. But there’s such a good balance in my life.”\n\nBezuidenhout summarised her involvement with the inmates of Christchurch Men’s Prison and Rolleston Prison as “using sport and dance to connect with at-risk youth”. In some ways, she was made for the role. In others, not: “I’m a confident person, a pocket rocket. I’m also short [and, she didn’t say, slight], but I was a shoulder for these boys to lean on. I spent two years within the prisons, and it was in the youth unit where I found my purpose in life.\n\n“It was amazing — these big gangster dudes, and they were so accepting. We had nothing in common, but if you go in there and you don’t judge people and you’re open and you just want to hear their stories, you find that these big men melt. A lot of them are actually big softies. They’re really good people. It’s always been in my heart to work with youth. Taking a break from sport gave me the opportunity to explore what I’d always wanted to do.”\n\nThat experience led Bezuidenhout to found the Epic Sports Project Charitable Trust in New Zealand and the Epic Foundation in South Africa. Both organisations work to give young people who have not been handed the best lot in life ways to get onto more solid paths. Bezuidenhout’s challenges were different, but she also needed rerouting.\n\nWhile she was away from the game, Katey Martin retired. Wicketkeepers who last as long as Martin in international cricket — almost 19 years, in which she was behind the stumps 199 times — can seem irreplaceable. Keepers are, tactically, culturally and even geographically in the field, at the heart of their teams. To not see that familiar, even familial, figure crouching down with a last, loud quip before the bowler sets off is unsettling.\n\nMore so for the New Zealanders, who have been through Isabella Gaze, Jessica McFadyen, Maddy Green and Bezuidenhout in the 23 white-ball internationals they have played since Martin hung up her gloves and pads. What sets Bezuidenhout apart is that she is a top order batter, but she will know she is, as yet, far from irreplaceable. Somehow that doesn’t matter as much as it would have a few years ago.\n\n“Now it’s about enjoying every moment that I get,” Bezuidenhout said. “And about being smart about training and fuelling. For instance today was optional training. I’m tired, so I rested. In the past I’d push myself and train. More is often less. We can’t perform if we’re not healthy. You matter. Your body is important. You know your body better than anybody else.”\n\nAnd her body tells her, every month, the good news: “They said it would take me as long as I’d been amenorrheac — 10 years! — to get my period back. And it took me two! That’s a miracle in itself.”\n\nBernadine Bezuidenhout, woman, “proud auntie” of 19-month-old Sage, friend, Kiwi, Cantabrian, cricketer — in that order — might have been dead. Instead, with neither apology nor regret nor even the faintest discernible tarnish from what has gone before, she is spectacularly alive. That rock is lucky it didn’t hit her.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

South Africa have a new captain in Aiden Markram and a new coach in Rob Walter. Rovman Powell has one T20I — along with three ODIs — as West Indies captain under his belt. Both teams will welcome the promise of better days that shines in new beginnings like those.\n\nIn their most recent T20I, against the Netherlands in Adelaide in November, the South Africans suffered the most ignominious defeat in even their troubled history — which eliminated them from the running for the semifinals. The West Indians didn’t make it that far in the same tournament: they became first-round casualties in Hobart in the wake of losing to Scotland and Ireland to finish bottom of their group.\n\nSo things can only get better. But that promise of better days won’t shine forever. By Tuesday night, when the third and last match of the series will have been played at the Wanderers, if the rubber has been lopsided one of these teams will face a similar set of questions as they do now. If the matches are competitive, the series will be considered a building block for the future.\n\nThe next men’s T20 World Cup is in the Caribbean and the US in June next year. Until then the format’s spotlight will remain firmly fixed on the franchise league scene. Consequently whatever happens in Centurion and at the Wanderers from Saturday to Tuesday cannot be considered of immediate importance. But it is in series like these, which are played far from the centre of attention, and especially with the IPL gearing up to flood world cricket’s consciousness from next Friday, that valuable investments can be made.\n\nThere is some justice in the fact that much the same personnel who were part of both teams’ recent travails have been tasked with remedying what has gone wrong. You broke it, you fix it. Indeed, the players themselves should look forward to a chance to do exactly that. Given that the teams are, in theory, evenly matched they have a decent chance to accomplish that mission.\n\nWhen: March 25 and 26, 2023; 2pm Local Time (5.30pm IST)\n\nWhere: Centurion\n\nWhat to expect: There’s a 61% forecast for showers on Saturday morning, and a 40% chance of a thunderstorm on Sunday afternoon. That aside, look forward to a willing pitch and a fast outfield.\n\nTeam news:\n\nSouth Africa: Temba Bavuma, South Africa’s captain the last time they played in this format, isn’t even in the squad. Their spinner in their most recent T20I, Keshav Maharaj, will be laid up for months because of a ruptured achilles.\n\nPossible XI: Quinton de Kock, Reeza Hendricks, Rilee Rossouw, Aiden Markram (capt), David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen, Wayne Parnell, Tabraiz Shamsi, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortjé, Lungi Ngidi\n\nWest Indies: Shamarh Brooks for Evin Lewis, who is no longer in the squad, looks the likeliest change.\n\nPossible XI: Kyle Mayers, Johnson Charles, Shamarh Brooks, Brandon King, Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell (capt), Odean Smith, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Obed McCoy\n\nWhat they said:\n\n“Things happen very quickly in T20 cricket, so you want to try stay as far ahead of the game as you can as a captain. You try to predict things; try to get a lot of information before the game on certain match-ups that can work in our favour. Ultimately, on the day you have to see what is working for you and stick to that. If we can commit to those options and not worry about the outcome, we give ourselves the best chance.” — Aiden Markram on the art of T20 captaincy.\n\n“The guys who have been on the whole tour, it’s important for them to feed us with information. And it’s for us who have been here for just a short time to adjust fast. It’s good that the conditions aren’t a lot different from the Caribbean.” — Rovman Powell hopes for a smooth transition between white-ball formats.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

Or that he lost one of the provincial presidencies of the African National Congress to a noisy young lawyer called Nelson Mandela? Or that he died — of natural causes, no mean feat all things considered — in the Russian capital in August 1972 after devoting most of his 69 years to the struggles of the working class?\n\nFew, it’s safe to say. Even fewer would have cared to know such things. South Africans of all racial, class and political stripes are in chronic denial about the facts of their past, present and future. How many at the third ODI between South Africa and West Indies would have known that the public holiday, which enabled a 10am start, was called Human Rights Day?\n\nOr that for some this will always be Sharpeville Day? On March 21, 1960 in Sharpeville, 85 kilometres from Potch, police opened fire on a peaceful protest against apartheid’s pass laws, killing 69 and injuring 180. Many were shot in the back. Incredibly, alarmingly, disgustingly, world cricket needed 10 more years to do the decent thing and ban South Africa’s teams from the international stage.\n\nAnd that despite those teams never including anything but white players, and who would not play against opponents who weren’t entirely white. In those diabolical terms only seven of the 22 players who took the field on Tuesday would have been eligible.\n\nWhat would the denizens of those dark days have made of the fact that the first player to help Lungi Ngidi celebrate his spectacular diving semi-snowcone catch in the deep to remove Kyle Mayers was Aiden Markram? Or that when Rob Walter walked onto the field after South Africa had won by four wickets with all of 20.3 overs to spare to square the series, the figure he engaged in conversation was Temba Bavuma — the man who will soon lead South Africa against the Netherlands and at the World Cup? Or that when Markram, who stood in as captain because Bavuma had tweaked a hamstring, was asked to pose for a photograph with Shai Hope and the trophy, he immediately beckoned Bavuma to come and share the picture? Or that the black, brown and white members of South Africa’s squad wore black armbands to pay Walter their respects on the occasion of the death of his father?\n\nThese matters might seem peripheral or even irrelevant to Heinrich Klaasen taking guard at 73/3 in the 11th with 188 still required, and cracking cover drives and pulverising pulls with gusto in an unbeaten 119. Klaasen hit 90 of his runs — more than 75% — in fours and sixes, and reached three figures off 54 balls. Only AB de Villiers, twice, and Mark Boucher have scored faster ODI centuries for South Africa. On top of that, it will do Marco Jansen’s progress to fully-fledged allrounderhood no harm that the 103 he shared off 62 with Klaasen was the major stand of the innings. If the perfect runchase exists, South Africa’s on Tuesday may be it.\n\n“Yesterday at training I was hitting everything with the outside half of the bat or the inside half of the bat,” Klaasen said in his television interview. A day later he seemed to hammer everything out of the heart of his willow. How had he addressed the issue?\n\n“We fixed a little technical thing yesterday after about 50 balls of inside-and-outside edging,” Klaasen told a press conference. “I tried to stay still and calm, especially my hands. After that everything seemed to hit the middle a little bit better, and I took that confidence into today’s game. It was one of those days when the first couple went into the gap. The rest was simple. I felt like I got a couple of loose deliveries, which I capitalised on. That set my tempo for the innings.”\n\nHope, who knows a thing or two about ODI batting having scored four hundreds and a half-century in his last 17 innings in the format, concurred: “Every single ball he struck just seemed to find the gap. I know those days as a cricketer. Everything seems to hit the middle of the bat and you find the boundaries with ease. When he came in I thought we were ahead of the game. We needed just two more wickets at that stage and we pretty much could have wrapped it up.”\n\nKlaasen’s performance followed Markram’s star turn with the ball, in which he took 1/30 from his full quota of overs. Markram wasn’t alone in his tidiness: of South Africa’s six bowlers, only Ngidi went for more than a run a ball. Consequently, the Windies’ momentum faltered after Ngidi ended Brandon King’s 72, scored off as many deliveries, via an edge onto the stumps in the 22nd. That was part of a slide of 5/77 from the 19th to the 35th.\n\nBetween all the feats, facts and figures, leave room for the most important truth of them all: Tuesday’s game wouldn’t have happened without the sacrifices so many South Africans made in the past. Klaasen, Bavuma, Markram and the rest of that side of the dressing room divide would never have played for their country of birth, much less captained the team or scored centuries for them. The West Indians might never have been allowed into the country, much less onto the field. If they somehow made it as far as the boundary they would have been at best arrested, at worst shot.\n\nWe should acknowledge every day, but especially on Sharpeville Day, that without big politics there can be no big sport.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

The young guys have different thought processes.” – David Miller on the generational divide.\n\nTelford Vice / Cape Town\n\nIT isn’t often that the dress rehearsal looms as a taller order than opening night, but that’s South Africa’s reality going into the third men’s ODI against West Indies in Potchefstroom on Tuesday.\n\nWhat comes next for the South Africans — two ODIs against the Netherlands in Benoni on March 31 and at the Wanderers on April 2 — will likely decide whether the home side qualify directly for the World Cup in India in October or November, or will have to bother with a qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe in June and July.\n\nThe first match of the current series, at Buffalo Park in East London on Thursday, was washed out without a ball bowled. The visitors won the second, at the same ground on Saturday by 48 runs. In a word, handsomely. Tuesday’s game, like the first two, counts for nought on the World Cup Super League standings — unlike the matches against the Dutch.\n\nBut the West Indians are easily stronger opponents than the Netherlands, who have lost all five ODIs between the sides. That said, Dutch supporters are no doubt still glowing in the wake of their team’s deserved win over South Africa at the T20 World Cup in Adelaide in November. Maybe lightning doesn’t strike in the same place twice, but a committed XI could.\n\nEven though that seems unlikely given South Africa’s apparent revitalisation under new coaches Shukri Conrad and Rob Walter, no-one will make the mistake of taking victory over the Dutch for granted. The best way to prepare to nail down wins in those games is to hit the ground running on Tuesday.\n\nWith Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller in the squad — they weren’t for the first two games — South Africa’s batting should be more solid than it was on Saturday, when they debuted four players in the format. But the Windies have strength in depth in all departments, which will make them slight favourites to earn a third white-ball series win in South Africa.\n\nBoth teams know winning on Tuesday won’t move the needle on their bid to reach the World Cup, and the West Indians seem resigned to have to go to Zimbabwe to make it to India. That leaves the match in an awkward place; somewhere between a middle practice and an experiment.\n\nSo, rather than a hard-fought contest, expect an intriguing spectacle on a ground where 300 hasn’t been breached in the six list A games played there since the start of last year. And where the team batting second have won only two of those matches. And also where the sides who have won batting first have dismissed their opponents all four times. Expect a dress rehearsal, and pretend it’s opening night.\n\nWhen: March 21, 2023; 10am Local Time (1.30pm IST)\n\nWhere: JB Marks Oval, Potchefstroom\n\nWhat to expect: A flat pitch, a temperature of 31 degrees Celsius, and a thunderstorm in the afternoon, when a 40% chance of rain has been forecast.\n\nTeam news:\n\nSouth Africa: Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen return to the squad from rests and David Miller from the PSL. They could replace Ryan Rickelton, Rassie van der Dussen and Tristan Stubbs.\n\nPossible XI: Quinton de Kock, Temba Bavuma (capt), Aiden Markram, Tony de Zorzi, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Bjorn Fortuin, Gerald Coetzee, Lungi Ngidi, Tabraiz Shamsi\n\nWest Indies: Why fiddle with an XI that won well in Buffalo Park’s not dissimilar conditions on Saturday?\n\nPossible XI: Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Shamarh Brooks, Shai Hope (capt), Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Odean Smith, Alzarri Joseph, Yannic Cariah\n\nWhat they said:\n\n“I’ve been there for many years now and I want to make the impact that I can, on and off the field, with the new guys in the squad so they can feed off my experience and learning. I am always learning myself; learning from them as well. The young guys have different thought processes.” — David Miller on being a big fish in a pond not short of younger, smaller fish.\n\n“It’s something we speak about in meetings. We’re just trying to win more games. We didn’t have a successful 2022 and we are trying everything to turn it around,” — Shai Hope on the Windies’ emphasis on forward momentum in the wake of losing 16 of their 21 ODIs last year.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

We know people want to come and see good cricket, and cricket is also a party in the Caribbean.” – Shai Hope on the Buffalo Park crowd.\n\nTelford Vice / Cape Town\n\nA sizeable chunk of the membership of the Buffalo Club was not happy. How dare Border cricket decide to put up a new scoreboard? And so impede the members’ view of the Indian Ocean, which they could see lapping onto Eastern Beach from their clubhouse’s privileged perch on a hill overlooking Buffalo Park.\n\nIt wasn’t enough that the members could watch all the live cricket they wanted in the comfort of their club, and without having to bother with buying a ticket. They wanted the view, too. To hell with spectators who would benefit from being better informed about the match.\n\nThe club’s ownership of the ground gave them a false, unpaid for and unearned sense of entitlement and superiority over the wishes and needs of the ticket-buying thousands who thronged the grass banks and stands on big match days.\n\nThis was deep in the dark 1990s, when Buffs’ membership was even whiter than the make-up of the teams who played at the foot of the hill and the crowds who watched them. Then, clubs like Buffs, which had until recently been physically, mentally and emotionally ensconced in the bosom of the apartheid establishment, were seen and saw themselves as bastions of the old order.\n\nYou want fairness? Democracy? Something closer to unity? What you hoped would soon be reality? Rather join United or Willows in Buffalo Flats and Mdantsane, brown and black areas of East London. And, if you’re white, be satisfied and shut up. Not many years earlier and you would have had the security police asking whether you were a communist or a terrorist, or both — they were the same thing for the goons, anyway — for wanting to play cricket with and against people who were not white. Or the cops would not have bothered to ask before they took you away. Buffs and their ilk was not for you and your ilk. Exactly the same people, and their enablers, among them members of clubs like Buffs, demanded that sport and politics be kept strictly separate.\n\nSo you wonder what the membership of Buffs club thought while they watched the second men’s ODI between South Africa and West Indies on Saturday. These days they keep themselves apart from the hoi polloi not with the help of repressive legislation but with a sturdy fence that runs across the hill horizontally, marking out where the club’s lawns end and Buffalo Park begins. The membership is less white than it used to be but it is still attuned to affluence über alles, even though it can no longer shut itself off from reality.\n\nOnly seven of the 24 people — umpires included — who took the field on Saturday were white. Better yet, one black player’s century was followed by another’s: Shai Hope, in his first match as the Windies’ captain, scored 128 and Temba Bavuma made 144, his second hundred for South Africa in as many innings in the wake of his 172 against the same opponents in the Wanderers Test. Both are career-bests for Bavuma.\n\nMany in the crowd were of the same blood as Hope and Bavuma. They availed themselves of the wide expanse of lawn on the outside of the unusually shrunken boundaries in an all-dancing, all-singing carnival of cricket-watching. The magical melody of Zizojika Izinto, an isiXhosa hymn and struggle song, poured through them many more times than once.\n\nThe singing and dancing rose and fell and rose again even as it became apparent to these proper cricket people — they and their forebears have been part of the game in South Africa since they encountered it at colonial mission schools in the Eastern Cape hinterland some 180 years ago — that only Bavuma stood between South Africa and defeat.\n\nIt was one thing for Hope to bat with verve through stands of 86 with Nicholas Pooran, 80 with Rovman Powell, and a mad dash of 42 off 22 with Alzarri Joseph; quite another for Bavuma to hobble on one-and-a-half legs — he hurt himself in the field — through 41.2 overs to play with such authority and urgency.\n\nBavuma and Quinton de Kock put on 76 before South Africa’s captain shared 61 with Tony de Zorzi. Of the 49 realised in the company of Lungi Ngidi, Bavuma scored 36. Ngidi, a tailender’s tailender, was inspired enough to heave Akeal Hosein over midwicket for six. The West Indians, having piled up 335/8 — their highest ODI total against South Africa — probably knew they had the game won, especially as the wickets mounted. But Bavuma kept the possibility of an improbable victory at least half alive.\n\n“The ball before I got out, I said to Lungi, ‘If we can get two 15-run overs here, we can get them to panic,’” Bavuma said during his television interview. Only when he flapped at Joseph and gloved a catch behind, the ninth wicket down, was the issue put beyond doubt. Two balls later South Africa were dismissed 48 short.\n\nStarting with his 109 in an ODI against England in Bloemfontein on January 29, Bavuma has scored three centuries in seven innings for South Africa and twice passed 50 in five trips to the domestic crease. In his previous dozen innings his 65 in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG was his only half-century and his highest score. Where were all the runs coming from?\n\n“My mind is a lot more clear as to what I’m trying to do and how I’m trying to do it,” Bavuma told a press conference. “I’m feeding off the confidence I’m getting from the players as well as the new coaches [Shukri Conrad and Rob Walter]. I’m just enjoying my cricket.”\n\nHope, in his press conference, said of Bavuma’s effort: “He deserved to win the game, playing an innings like that. But there can only be one winner.”\n\nAlong with Bavuma’s and his own batting, Hope also enjoyed the crowd: “They were amazing. That’s something that we as West Indians appreciate as well. We know people want to come and see good cricket, and cricket is also a party in the Caribbean.”\n\nLittle wonder Zizojika Izinto had kept ringing around the ground. The song’s title translates as “Things will turn around”. Up at Buffs Club, the members knew things had indeed turned around. And not only because they could see, instead of waves lapping onto Eastern Beach, the feats of people like Hope and Bavuma writ large on the scoreboard. The Windies captain was wrong: sometimes there’s more than one winner.\n\nCricbuzz\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.
