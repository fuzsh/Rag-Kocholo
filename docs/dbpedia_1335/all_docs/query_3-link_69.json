        "text": "Jeannie D\n\nSouth African actress, radio personality, model and TV presenter Jeannie D is best known for her work on Top Billing. Jeannie’s love for the arts started at 12 years old when she successfully auditioned at the National School of Arts. Here the media personality was trained in dance, speech, drama, and theatre. Jeannie’s professional media career started when she joined her university’s campus radio station. After leaving Top Billing, Jeannie was a producer for SABC 3’s Afternoon Express. Travelling has always been an integral part of her life and she says she “was born to explore.” Her pups Prego and Chilli are always by her side.\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout was born in Kempton Park or as he calls it - 'The New York of the East Rand'. His family and friends stood back as they watched Schalk evolve from an Afrikaans conservative caterpillar into a beautiful drama queen butterfly, complete with a moustache and furry afro. It was obvious to Schalk's parents that he would study drama, and to help numb the pain they sent him away to study at the University of Cape Town. While studying in Cape Town Schalk slowly began to realise that there was so much more to life than boerewors and rugby and started doing stand-up in April 2011. On stage Schalk is fun and energetic and appeals to people of all kinds and colours. He is a dog dad to his two rescue pooches Otis and Finn.\n\nBailey Georgiades\n\nMedia personality Bailey Georgiades has over 20 years’ experience as a Radio Presenter, TV Presenter, Voice Over Artist and MC. She writes an award-winning blog, Vanilla Blonde, and hosts podcasts, \"The Bailey Boost\" and \"The Bailey Boost Interviews.” She is also a very proud mom to two little boys and a fur baby, Rocky. She has just launched Bailey G, the ultimate solution for all your make-up brush and beauty sponge cleaning needs.\n\nJoseph Dweba\n\nJoseph is a South African professional rugby union player for the Stormers in the United Rugby Championship competition. He previously played for the Cheetahs in the Pro14 and the Free State Cheetahs in the Currie Cup. In June 2021, Dweba was called up by the national team for the first time being included in a 46-man Springbok Squad to play against the British and Irish Lions. He made his test debut for the Springboks against Argentina on 14 August 2021 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. In his downtime he loves being with his close-knit family, including their two pooches.\n\nLerato Kganyago Ndlala\n\nAward winning TV and radio presenter, Lerato Ndlala’s career kick-started in 2002 when she was crowned ‘Miss Jam Alley’ and Miss Soweto in 2005, which got her the big break on Soweto TV. Thereafter she quickly became one of SA’s biggest TV presenters as she appeared on popular shows like The LKG Show, LIVE AMP, and The Link. She started her radio career on the community station, Jozi FM. Lerato is also a successful businesswoman and owns an event management company called Black Angel as well as a 5-star hotel and an eyelash company, Flutter. Her dogs Dolce and Gabbana slot in perfectly to her glamorous lifestyle."
