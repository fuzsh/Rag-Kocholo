        "text": "Club rugby\n\nAll four matches delivered spirited performances on Saturday.\n\nLeandrea mouers\n\nNamibia Rugby Union (NRU) premier league log leaders FNB Unam consolidated their position by pocketing a home win against FNB Kudus in Walvis Bay.\n\nUnam clinched a 35-22 victory at the Jan Wilken Stadium, while FNB Wanderers moved up from third to second place, overtaking Kudus who dropped to third place.\n\nIn an exhilarating match, the majority of the points were scored in the first half. In the first half hour, the score quickly accumulated to 14-12, with Unam scoring two converted tries and Kudus also scoring twice, but only managed to convert one.\n\nBy halftime, the score stood at 28-17. In the second half, Unam's right wing Quirione Majiedt intercepted a pass and ran like the wind to place the ball directly under the goal posts. The try was successfully converted by fullback Aljarreau Zaahl, cementing the win for the students.\n\nFor Kudus, lady luck was not on their side, as they could have crossed for about four more tries not recognized by referee Oscar Lambert, either due to a forward pass, losing the ball, or held up without a visible grounding. Kudus showed resilience and managed to finish strong, with right wing Irongwa Atshivudhi scoring their final try.\n\nKudus had to make do without their regulars centre pairing PJ Walters and Justin Newman, Lloyd Jacobs (fullback) and Aurelio Plato (flyhalf). Walters tied the knot this weekend in Windhoek, with Jacobs, Plato and Newman as invited guests. Regular team captain Cameron Langenhoven (flank) is also still recovering from a knee injury.\n\nDespite these absences, Kudus proved their mettle, keeping the passionate home supporters on their feet despite the hot, windy weather.\n\nBoth teams spent time with 14 men due to cards. Kudus captain Joshua Jacobs and Unam replacement forward Bjorn Kazondunge were sent to the bin after a minor scuffle and Kudus flank Kenneth Seibeb received a yellow for tackling an opponent without the ball.\n\nTry-scorers for the day for Unam were fullback Aljarreau Zaahl (2), right wing Quirione Majiedt, scrumhalf Willon du Plessis and nr. 8 Handre Bezuidenhout. Zaahl managed to convert all five tries.\n\nKudus’ four tries were scored by right wing Irongwa Atshivudhi, centre Scott Winborn and left wing Lucio Isaacs (2). Winborn managed to convert once.\n\nUnam head coach Russel van Rooi afterwards said it’s never easy playing Kudus on their home ground.\n\n“Congratulations to Kudus; they tested us on various things, but we can always go back to the drawing board. Hard work is rewarded on the field. We can talk a lot in the media, but everything that happens between the four corners on the field speaks loudest.”\n\nVan Rooi said it’s positive for Namibian rugby that national players can be available for their clubs. “We can also learn a lot from coaches such as Chrysander Botha and Roger Thompson.”\n\nWanderers almost rack up ninety\n\nBottom-of-the-log Simonis Storm Dolphin was put to the sword by FNB Wanderers who ran out 89-5 winners in Pionierspark.\n\nWanderers’s edge in big-match experience was on display as they ran in 13 tries – shared between wings Nandivatu Karuuombe (3) and Tolley Tjipute (2), centres Jurgen Meyer (2) and Danco Burger, flyhalf Andre van der Berg, scrumhalf and captain Jacques Theron (2), nr. 8 Driaan Vorster and tighthead prop Ignus Tripodi. Van der Berg’s kicking boot added twelve conversions.\n\nTripodi got sent off with a red card for an alleged punch, which replays show was actually just a push.\n\nDolphin’s replacement prop Warren Narib scored an unconverted try.\n\nDerby delivers Falcon’s third win\n\nCoach Frank Isaacs credited FNB Reho Falcon’s fitness for their come-from-behind win against FNB Rehoboth in the southern town’s eagerly supported rugby derby.\n\nRehoboth’s Red Bulls scored some excellent tries on their way to building a 26-13 lead (halftime 19-13), with time running out for the hosts at the Dr Lemmer High School field.\n\nHowever, Falcon delivered another spirited performance and once again proved that their class of 2024 is not to be under-estimated. Their defensive effort to protect their line from the desperate onslaught of Rehoboth in the dying minutes also proved vital.\n\nFlank Keynnen Basson, hooker Dilhon Daries and replacement scrumhalf Dillon Kahmann were try scorers for Falcon, while wing Enrique Husselmann (two conversions, two penalties) and fullback Ashton van Wyk (two penalties) added more vital points.\n\nRehoboth took two log points – for the narrow loss as well as their four tries (by lock Delano van Wyk, centre Brandon Dentlinger, nr. 8 Ray-Eez Feris and left wing Kee-shan Beukes. Centre Henrique Olivier contributed three conversions.\n\nBig win for Grootfontein\n\nLeft wing Lazarus Joseph scored a hat-trick of tries and captain and hooker Wkus Jacobs scored twice as FNB Grootfontein overpowered FNB Western Suburbs 57-28.\n\nLock Martinus Nekundi, fullback AJ Vercuil, scrumhalf Zemuel Marais and nr. 8 Johan Luttig also added five-pointers to Grootfontein’s big win, while Vercuil and Jacobs each added three conversions.\n\nThe visitors from Khomasdal fought back to earn one bonus point with tries by prop Uvatera Kaverua (3) and fullback Johnny Namene, all converted by flyhalf Justin Nel.\n\nNRU reserve league\n\nWanderers second team beat Dolphin II by 69-3, while Kudus II won 15-7 against Unam II. Grootfontein’s second stringers edged out Suburbs 15-14, while Falcon II celebrated winning 15-10 against Rehoboth.\n\n• Fixtures, results, log standings and news at www.fnbrugby.my.na/\n\n• Watch the Rehoboth derby broadcast: https://q.my.na/DTVZ"
