        "text": "One of the exciting announcements to emerge from the launch of the 2016 season of the FNB Varsity Cup presented by Steinhoff International on Monday 25 January was the implementation of a new points scoring system.\n\nThe system allows for a nine-point and seven-point try to be awarded, depending on where possession was originally gained in the uninterrupted try-scoring move.\n\nFollowing the ‘nine-point try’ and ‘seven-point try’ announcements, the Varsity Cup Board has taken the decision to adjust the points allocated for successful penalty kicks, drop goals and conversions in the 2016 Varsity Cup, to the following:\n\nPenalty kick worth 3 points\n\nDrop goal worth 3 points\n\nConversion worth 2 points\n\n“This change has come about, as we (Varsity Cup) continuously research and test the new points allocation system for tries,” says Varsity Cup founder, Francois Pienaar.\n\n“One has to understand the reason Varsity Cup had previously changed the value of points allocated to penalty kicks, drop goals and conversions. It was done to encourage running rugby and reward teams who put an emphasis on try-scoring. With the implementation of this new points scoring system for tries, we intend to encourage complete rugby, which will develop all the skill sets of our athletes.\n\n“If we kept the points for kicks the same as previous years, it would take six penalty kicks to catch up with the one nine-point converted try in 2016. So by changing the points awarded for successful kicks, we are now encouraging all aspects of the game to be utilised and ultimately for individuals to develop all skill sets – including goal kicking.“\n\nValue of Penalty\n\nA penalty in rugby has always been a vital element. It has kept defending teams honest when defending in their half and close to their trylines, as the penalty carries the potential for valuable points to be scored. Teams have won matches and continue to do so, by utilising their penalty kicks.\n\n“Our aim has always been to encourage positive rugby and thus we felt it correct to restore the value of the penalty back to three points,” added Varsity Sports CEO, Duitser Bosman.\n\n“With the penalty kick and drop goal brought back to three points, it would take three penalties to catch up to the ‘nine-point try’ and an extra penalty if that try had been converted. This offers great value to the penalty.”\n\nVodacom Bulls prop Morne Mellett has retired from rugby with immediate effect due to medical advice.\n\nThe prop suffered vertebral artery dissection in July and was ruled out of rugby for the remainder of the year. Recent medical advice suggested that the 26-year old player calls it a day.\n\n“It is sad to end my career like this, but I have no regrets,” Mellett said on Thursday.\n\n“I had a good career with an unbelievable group of guys and was part of the best union in the world since I left school. We have achieved so much together and although I would have wanted to go on and play test rugby in the future, my health and family remains most important. I would like to take this opportunity to specifically thank my wife, Claudine, for her unconditional love and support throughout my career and especially now, as well as my brother Leon.” he said.\n\nMellett represented Valke at Craven Week in 2006 and 2007 and started playing for the Vodacom Blue Bulls Under-19’s in 2007 already.\n\nHe represented the Vodacom Bulls in 37 matches in the Vodacom Super Rugby competition and 10 times in the Absa Currie Cup. He also played for UP-Tuks in the Varsity Cup and represented the Junior Springboks at the 2009 Junior World Championship.\n\nXander Janse van Rensburg, High Performance Manager of the Blue Bulls Company (Pty) Ltd, thanked Mellett for his contribution to the team and union.\n\n“We are very sad to hear the news. Morne has been a great team man over many years and his contributions to all Blue Bulls teams are appreciated and will not be forgotten. We want to thank him for everything he did for the Vodacom Bulls and Vodacom Blue Bulls and we wish him well in his career going forward and life after rugby. If he applies himself in business with the same professionalism and dedication than as a Bulls player, he will do very well.”\n\nThe Carlton Cup Competition has come and gone. The final was played at midday on Loftus A field before a handful of spectators. UP-Tuks emerged as winners when they overpowered the Pretoria Police team 44-15 and walked off with the Carlton Cup. The students made it three Carlton Final wins in a row.\n\nHalftime Tuks were already well ahead (25-10). Police’s defence were at times quite mediocre, allowing Tuks to score tries with apparent ease. Police did not display their usual passion. Maybe this was because a few star players were injured.\n\nPolice’s stalwart Ruan “Strepies” van Loo injured his right leg’s quadriceps when he took the second kick-off after about five/six minutes of play. He was very unhappy and disappointed as he was helped off the field. He was sorely missed the rest of the game. Replacement winger Ivan Venter stepped in as kicker. Ruan will be lost to Police as he is leaving for England at the end of the year for two years.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half came the next blow when captain Nico Luus was injured and carted off. He was also playing his last club game and at the age of 38 years intends to retire from rugby. He meant a lot to the team and to the club and would not be replaced that easily. If he recovers in time from his injury he still has to play a few games for the Blue Bulls Amateurs (6-11 September) before the final curtain on his long and industrious career.\n\nUP-Tuks out-scored, out-ran and out-scrummed Bobbies. Right from the start it was obvious who was going to be victorious after eighty minutes. During the season they scored many more tries and piled up more points than the other teams in the Carlton. Let us hope they can take this through to the Varsity Cup next year.\n\nTuks 44 (25), Pretoria Police 15 (10)\n\nTUKS: 6 tries: Vian Riekert (2), Dwight Pansegrouw (2), Riaan Britz, Emile Temperman.

This trophy baffled them. One day the players started asking questions.\n\nHowever the bar attendant did not know it’s origin – where it came from or what it was doing there.\n\nThe players then asked if they could have it as a trophy to play for.\n\nThe owner, Lezard, agreed – and the trophy was named after the bar “CARLTON”, and thus it was baptized as the Carlton Cup.\n\n1938 Northern Transvaal Rugby broke away from Transvaal Rugby Union and became a rugby entity on its own.\n\nSince then the Carlton Cup Club Competition have been played in Pretoria.\n\nPolice have won the cup 32 times ( 27 wins, 5 draws) from 1939.\n\nUP-Tuks have won the cup 24 times (21 wins, 3 draws) from 1960.\n\nCARLTON CUP WINNERS\n\n1938 – Garrison\n\n1939 – Police\n\n1940 – Pretoria\n\n1941 – Police\n\n1942 – Garrison\n\n1943 – Police\n\n1944 – Police\n\n1945 – Police\n\n1946 – Police\n\n1947 – Police\n\n1948 – Police & Pretoria\n\n1949 – Police & Harlequin\n\n1950 – Police\n\n1951 – Harlequin\n\n1952 – Harlequin\n\n1953 – Police\n\n1954 – Pretoria\n\n1955 – Police\n\n1956 – Police\n\n1957 – Police\n\n1958 – Pretoria\n\n1959 – Police\n\n1960 – Defence Force & UP-Tuks\n\n1961 – Police\n\n1962 – Police\n\n1963 – UP-Tuks\n\n1964 – Oostelike & Defence Force\n\n1965 – Oostelike\n\n1966 – UP-Tuks\n\n1967 – Police\n\n1968 – Police\n\n1969 – UP-Tuks\n\n1970 – Pretoria\n\n1971 – UP-Tuks\n\n1972 – UP-Tuks\n\n1973 – Police & Pretoria\n\n1974 – Police\n\n1975 – UP-Tuks\n\n1976 – UP-Tuks\n\n1977 – UP-Tuks\n\n1978 – UP-Tuks\n\n1979 – UP-Tuks & Police\n\n1980 – Police\n\n1981 – Defence Force\n\n1982 – UP- Tuks\n\n1983 – UP-Tuks\n\n1984 – UP-Tuks\n\n1985 – UP-Tuks\n\n1986 – Defence Force\n\n1987 – UP-Tuks & Police\n\n1988 – UP-Tuks\n\n1989 – Pretoria\n\n1990 – Pretoria\n\n1991 – Police\n\n1992 – NKP\n\n1993 – Correctional Services\n\n1994 – Police\n\n1995 – Police\n\n1996 – Police\n\n1997 – Police\n\n1998 – Pretoria\n\n1999 – Centurion\n\n2000 – Technikon\n\n2001 – Correctional Services\n\n2002 – UP-Tuks\n\n2003 – Technikon won by default against UP-Tuks.\n\n2004 – TUT\n\n2005 – TUT (No final.
