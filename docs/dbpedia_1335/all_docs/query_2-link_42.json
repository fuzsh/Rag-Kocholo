        "text": "Rassie on WP contracting\n\nRassie on player contracting\n\nOver the past 3 years WP Rugby and senior Professional Coach Rassie Erasmus have looked to build on and put in place structures to ensure player identification and development in the province.\n\nThe WP Rugby Institute in Stellenbosch has ensured that the pick of our young players leaving school are prepared for the rigours of professional rugby and the WP U19 results (2009 semi -final and 2010 champions) bears immediate testament to the work being done there.\n\nThe WP U21 ranks then represent a further learning and development step and again these testing grounds are demonstrating success with WP U21 securing a semifinal in 2009 and ending as champions in 2010.\n\nThese structures are also now producing players capable of playing at the highest levels with an unprecedented 11 young WP Rugby Institute players making their senior debut at Super Rugby level this year for the DHL Stormers, racking up a combined 53 caps, many of them before even securing a Currie Cup cap for WP.\n\nAt senior level the structures have started to produce depth and results, providing the DHL Stormers with their first silverware this season in the Super Rugby Conference Winners trophy. Whilst many don't acknowledge the value of this trophy, the fact is the Stormers beat all of the SA franchises, on a strength v strength, home and away basis, with all international players playing, losing only 1 game to the Bulls along the way. Few can argue that at domestic level there is any tougher competition. Despite not qualifying for a final this year, as they did last year, the DHL Stormers exited at semifinal stage, having finished second on the log, in undoubtedly the toughest competition in world rugby. That despite overwhelming injuries in key positions.\n\n“Our player philosophy revolves around a core senior playing group and an extended group of younger players that are there to gain experience and learn, whilst providing the depth crucial to being able to compete in Super Rugby.” says Rassie Erasmus. “Our progress this season was largely due to the quality of the core senior players and the depth of quality youngsters that we managed to bring through our structures.”\n\nContracting season has now opened and Rassie Erasmus remains confident that there will be no player exodus from the WP ranks. “It's quite the opposite actually. We are busy with something special here and the players sense that. Our senior players are committed to that process and this rubs off on the youngsters. Unfortunately inevitably we will lose one or two on the way and this is what people tend to focus on rather than the bigger success at all levels and the permanent structures now in place to ensure future competitiveness and success. WP and the Stormers are in a good place at the moment, we have a core of young players coming through the ranks adding to our depth and we are approaching our tipping point, which will bring the much wanted senior silverware.”\n\n“Given our player structures are now producing some of the country's finest young talent, other Unions will inevitably look to shop in our backyard. Whilst there is a genuine spirit of loyalty to the WP and Stormers brands, given the path these youngsters follow, rugby is a professional sport and certain players will look to follow the money and promises offered by others. Our offers are competitive and provide a mapped out player career path for each player. Unfortunately that is sometimes not enough! We however will not look to compromise our principles and will remain true to processes we have put in place. We will look to contract the best and those with the passion and desire to be part of what we all believe is something special that is happening here.”\n\n“A case in point in Johann Sadie - a true product of WP Rugby, Sadie has represented WP U16 Grant Khomo, WP U18 Academy, WP U18 Craven Week, WP Vodacom Cup and the DHL Stormers. Johann attended the WP Rugby Institute in 2008, where his talent and skills were worked on and he was prepared for a career in pro-rugby in the Western Province. He has been through the ranks and is thus very much a son of WP Rugby. Johann has been offered a contract by WP and by the Bulls and we hope that he decides to stay in the WP ranks.”\n\nCoetzee on the CC\n\nWP Jou Lekker Ding - Allister on the season ahead\n\nThe rigours of this year's Vodacom Super Rugby season firmly behind us, our focus now falls solely on our challenge in the country's top domestic competition, the 2011 ABSA Currie Cup.\n\nOur investment over the years into structures in the WP has seen our Institute, U19's and U21's produce some exceptional young talent. 11 of these players racked up a combined 53 DHL Stormers caps in this year's Super Rugby competition, most before securing a senior DHL WP cap.\n\nWe will certainly be continuing with our strategy of developing and growing our talent with the dual aims of doing well in this year's competition and building our depth and experience crucial for our Super Rugby challenge in 2012. With many of our senior players on national duty in a World Cup year, this Currie Cup season represents a massive opportunity for all our younger stars in the making.\n\nAs a management team and a group of players we are all very excited and look forward to a big season in the blue and white. WP jou lekker ding!\n\nAllister Coetzee\n\nCC teams fast facts\n\nRugby365\n\nSharks:\n\nThe title holders begin the defence of their crown this weekend severely hampered by international call-ups.\n\nNo fewer than 16 players are unavailable for selection - 15 due to their Springbok commitments and Steven Sykes has left for Irish club Leinster - so it will be a completely unfamiliar side from the one that did duty in the recently concluded Super Rugby competition.\n\nNewly appointed captain Keegan Daniel is the only forward survivor from the starting XV that did duty in last season's 30-10 final victory over Western Province in Durban.\n\nAmong the backs, only Stefan Terblanche and Louis Ludik remain.\n\nThe main acquisitions for John Plumtree's men is the signature of veteran centre Marius Joubert, who joins from Clermont Auvergne in France, and French flyhalf Frederic Michalak.\n\nAmong those to watch out for in the new season are hookers Kyle Cooper and Craig Burden, No.8 Marcell Coetzee and fetcher Francois Kleinhans.\n\nBlue Bulls:\n\nThe Bulls will, once again in a World Cup year, have to call on their rookies and fringe players in their pursuit of Currie Cup glory.\n\nThe side is without 16 regular starters, who are part of the Springbok group, but this number could be whittled down to eight by the time the World Cup squad is named.\n\nDespite the absence of many seasoned campaigners, however, the Blue Bulls still have Springboks Akona Ndungane, skipper Gary Botha, Dewald Potgieter and Jaco Pretorius available for their campaign.\n\nThe side also boasts talent and a number of fringe players will now have the opportunity to stake their claim in the absence of the likes of Victor Matfield, Bakkies Botha and Wynand Olivier.\n\nNew Blue Bulls coach Pine Pienaar will blood a few Currie Cup rookies with youngsters like fullback Jurgen Visser, loosehead prop Corné Fourie and centre Francois Venter expected to play in the top-flight competition for the first time.\n\nThey have also secured the services of former Lions hooker Willie Wepener who will add to the team's depth at hooker.\n\nThe Blue Bulls' success in this year's domestic tournament will depend on how well the youngsters make the step up from the junior structures to senior level.\n\nWestern Province:\n\nWhile most other sides must become accustomed to not having their Springbok players, Western Province also have to make do without a host of injured squad members.\n\nEighthman Duane Vermeulen, scrumhalf Dewaldt Duvenage, lock Reinhart Elstadt, flank Pieter Louw, prop JC Kritzinger and flyhalf Lionel Cronje are all nursing injuries.\n\nIf there is one thing, however, that the Cape Town side has proved this year, it is that they know what is needed to bleed youngsters at the highest levels.\n\nYoung Nick Koster will be one of the key men to watch while a lot of responsibility rests on the shoulders of flyhalf Gary van Aswegen who showed great promise at Super Rugby level before succumbing to injury.\n\nProvince should again have the hungriest players in the competition and if they continue to defend like they have over the past two seasons, a Currie Cup title is well within their reach.\n\nLions:\n\nIt has been 12 years since the Lions last lifted the title, and as the union's president said at the team's season launch, they are going through \"adverse\" times.\n\nBoardroom politics aside, the Lions must fancy their chances after a relatively successful Super Rugby season.\n\nElton Jantjies and Butch James, who are part of the Springboks' Tri-Nations and World Cup plans, will both be unavailable, but they are nonetheless the top-flight team with the least disruptions.\n\nIn their absence, a lot will be expected from Burton Francis who is one of the better kicking flyhalves in the competition.\n\nKey players to watch for this season are flanker Derick Minnie and scrumhalf Jano Vermaak.\n\nAs was the case in 2007, when they reached the final, the Lions should again be among the top three sides if they manage to build momentum early in the season.\n\nCheetahs:\n\nThe Currie Cup specialists never seem to run out of world class forwards, and phenomenal flyhalf Sias Ebersohn will make them even more dangerous this year.\n\nEbersohn is a match winner and the fact that he only needs to skip pass his inside centre to find his twin brother Robert - who is just as talented - could make the lives of opposing defenders very difficult.\n\nHaving bid farewell to hooker and captain Adriaan Strauss, fetcher Heinrich Brussow, loosehead prop Coenie Oosthuizen and eighthman Ashley Johnson, who will be away on Tri-Nations duty, it will be interesting to see how the men selected in their places face up to the challenge.\n\nOn the up-side, centre Andries Strauss will make his return from injury and will also take over the captaincy.\n\nOne of the men to watch this season will be Springbok Sevens star Boom Prinsloo who will play at eighthman where he made a name for himself in the Varsity Cup for Shimlas.\n\nVery few sides in the competition have mastered the art of beating the men from Bloem in their backyard, so despite the disruptions in personnel, they should still be favourites to reach the knockout stages of the competition.\n\nLeopards:\n\nA new coach, a new team ethos and a few reinforcements should make the Potchefstroom-based team far more threatening than they were last year.\n\nThe Leopards survived last season's promotion-relegation play-offs and will consider themselves fortunate to have another crack at it with the big guns.\n\nFew members of last year's team have stayed on as many have been lured to the First Division.\n\nThe team's goal, however, has not changed from what it was in 2010, although failure to finish the competition in sixth place could be detrimental to their future as a final decision on the competition's fate next year has not yet been made.\n\nUnderestimating this team, especially when they play at home, could damage the hopes of some of the title holders.\n\nGriquas:\n\nThe dangerous Griquas have shown over the last two years that they can no longer be considered minnows.\n\nThey will be boosted by a host of players who featured in this year's Super Rugby season as part of the Cheetahs franchise.\n\nPlayers like fullback Riaan Viljoen, nippy scrumhalf Sarel Pretorius and loose forward Davon Raubenheimer have been instrumental in the Cheetahs' achievements this season.\n\nBarry Geel, Martin Muller, Ryno Barnes and Lourens Adriaanse also gained Super Rugby experience at the Cheetahs.\n\nGriquas' lack of depth has been their Achilles heel in the Currie Cup as they have suffered many injuries midway through the season.\n\nMost teams, however, have found the going tough in Kimberley and Griquas will hope to use the tough conditions at home to their advantage.\n\nPumas:\n\nWith the possibility of the Currie Cup being reduced by two teams next year, the Pumas are hell-bent on finishing sixth in the 2011 edition of the Premier Division.\n\nThey were the surprise package of the 2010 Currie Cup as they caused upsets against two of the big unions in their debut year, narrowly beating the Blue Bulls in Nelspruit and defeating the Lions in Johannesburg.\n\nThe Pumas' potent pack of forwards will now be complimented with a versatile backline with the inclusion of four Springbok Sevens players.\n\nKey players to watch out for among the forwards are flanker Corne Steenkamp and eighthman Doppies le Roux.\n\nThe Pumas have the ability to cause an upset or two, but a lack of depth will ultimately provide a stumbling block in securing that targeted sixth place."
