        "text": "After the upbeat performance of Maritzburg Varsity against Jaguars in the Premier Division match at Sydenham on Saturday, it is pleasing to report from a Pietermaritzburg club rugby perspective that PMB Collegians and PMB Waratahs had successful First Division South outings on Friday.\n\nWaratahs beat Kokstad 54-0 at Woodburn, while travellers Collegians took care of Durban University 36-14.\n\n“It could have been more, but too many mistakes cost us,” said Waratahs chairman Fanie Crous.\n\nWaratahs flank George Bronkhorst stood out for his exceptional work-rate, gobbling up the loose ball and demonstrating his all-round skills with seven conversions out of eight.\n\nNippy scrumhalf Brendon Fourie had another good game, always dangerous and constantly on the case of his opposite number.\n\nCollegians chairman Tony Day praised the performances of scrumhalf Michael Brinjack and hooker and captain Charl Bezuidenhout in Collegians’ victory in Durban. He was pleased to welcome back first team regulars Pumba Ncunu and Jean Vosloo, the loosehead and lock returning after injuries.\n\nThe Midlands U20A side have found this division a real challenge, but the start of the second round brought them success with a 36-7 victory away to Jaguars.\n\nMidlands face Old Boys in Durban this Friday night in the quarter-finals of the knockout competition.\n\nResults\n\nFirst Division South: PMB Waratahs 54 Kokstad 0; Durban University 14 PMB Collegians 36. Reserves: Waratahs 44 Kokstad 0; DBN Varsity 10 PMB Coll 26.\n\n* The other club rugby results appeared in yesterday’s Witness report."
