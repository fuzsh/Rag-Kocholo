        "text": "The winger was quick off the mark to grab a brace of early tries in the opening seven minutes as he got his 28th year into full swing in the best possible style.\n\nSussex based Haywards Heath, who have yet to win a league game this season, set a quick pace from the opening stages, but were unable to capitalise on a couple of early breaks against the Seasiders.\n\nSouthend rose to the challenge immediately and scored the first try of the match after just four minutes, with Bezuidenhout crossing the line in the far corner, although unfortunately a little too far out for an easy conversion.\n\nBoosted by their early breakthrough the Seasiders stepped up a gear, with the backs looking strong and unafraid to spin the ball out wide.\n\nAnd it was that man Bezuidenhout who forced his way down the wing and over the line again, just three minutes after his first try, with fly-half Sid Hoult successfully adding the conversion on this occasion. However, an over eager Southend soon gave away a penalty which Haywards Heath made the most of, putting their first three points on the board. A well stolen lineout by flanker Dave MacDonald forced the home side to panic and they began giving away penalties.\n\nQuickly gaining ground with an excellent break from Hoult, Southend threatened another try, but Haywards Heath stood stubbornly and refused to be brushed aside.\n\nTaking a leaf out of the Seasiders' book, the opposition began spinning the ball wide and with precision handling were swiftly gaining territorial advantage.\n\nCrunching Southend tackles made their defence impenetrable, preventing Haywards Heath from scoring each time.\n\nThe only way they were able to get additional points on the board was via a penalty-kick, making the half-time score 12-6 in the visitors' favour. The second period opened with outstanding back play from Southend.\n\nWith the ball spinning wide and support allowing a return into the centre the Seasiders just missed out on an early try.\n\nPutting the frustration of this missed opportunity out of their minds, the Warner's Bridge side forced the opposition into mistakes, one of which Hoult converted inside the Haywards Heath 22 to increase the lead.\n\nThe tide began to turn however and the home side began to dominate Southend. Quick thinking by Haywards Heath scrum-half, Alex Meredith, led toa first try as he took the ball from a ruck just five metresout and divedaround the side and over the line.\n\nWithnumber 11, Ashton, converting there was nowonly a two point difference between the teams.\n\nHowever, Southend were in no mood to throw away a crucial victory by allowing their hosts back into the game.\n\nSeasiders skipper Jamie Connors led by example for the final 20 minutes of the match, inspiring his team to hold on for a crucial triumph.\n\nThe Kiwi's communication skills were vital as he linked the backs and forwards, fostered team spirit and pushed his team to dominate the all important lineouts.\n\nHaywards Heath were unable to find a chink in the Southend armour as the visitors held out.\n\nThe nearest the home team came to sealing a dramatic late win were two futile attempts at drop goals.\n\nSouthend are still third from bottom in the league standings, but closed the gap on the mid-table team.\n\nDelighted captain Connors said: \"We achieved our pre-match objective here. \"That's two wins on the trot now. But we will see how much we have really improved when we take on the leaders Lydney at Southend this weekend.\"\n\nOther results: Dings Crusaders 23, Redruth 12; Lydney 15, Hertford 8; Old Patesians 14, Barking 13; Reading 14, North Walsham 19; Tabard 31, Havant 34; Weston-Super-Mare 3, Westcombe Park 14."
