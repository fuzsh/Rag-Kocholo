utility named at No 10 to play the Force.\n\nThe move sees Harris switch with regular fly half Jack Debreczeni, who moves to fullback.\n\nMcGahan has also recalled Cruze Ah Nau, Luke Jones and Jordy Reid to the starting line-up.\n\nColby Fainga’a shifts to No 8 while Ah Nau’s inclusion means Toby Smith will switch to tighthead prop.\n\n“It’s good to have a few more players back from injury this week to make sure that we go into the international break on a positive note and give us something to chase when we get back,” McGahan said.\n\n“The Force’s size and physicality make them a serious threat in the scrum and around the breakdown so the inclusions will be a boost to our forward pack who need to be hungry and disciplined.\n\n“We’ve had a difficult couple of weeks and a few setbacks but we’re a group with plenty to play for so we need to back ourselves and our abilities to get the job done on Sunday.”\n\nForce coach Michael Foley has named Pek Cowan as his new captain following the season-ending injury to Matt Hodgson.\n\nChris Alcock will wear Hodgson’s No 7 jersey while Peter Grant returns from injury at fly-half in place of Ian Prior.\n\n“Hodgo is obviously a loss in terms of his play and leadership and while Pek will assume the captaincy, every player understands the need to step up,” Foley said.\n\n“Pek has been around from day one and with Alby (Mathewson), was asked to lead the team in Matt’s absence in the pre-season.\n\n“Clashes with the Rebels are always tight and we expect nothing different this weekend.\n\n“Last week we controlled possession and position for large portions of the game and while I felt we were a little unlucky to not be rewarded, we’ve remained focused on areas we can control.”\n\nREBELS (15-1): Jack Debreczeni, Sefa Naivalu, Mitch Inman, Reece Hodge, Tom English, Mike Harris, Nic Stirzaker (c), Colby Fainga’a, Jordy Reid, Sean McMahon, Lopeti Timani, Luke Jones, Toby Smith, James Hanson, Cruze Ah Nau\n\nReserves: Pat
