But for ten years, Bezuidenhout allegedly physically, sexually and emotionally abused multiple gymnasts at a club in the Free State. When his alleged crimes were uncovered, he took his own life. Red flags about Bezuidenhout’s conduct started early in his career but no one believed the children, and the club failed to investigate the allegations. Now, several of Bezuidenhout’s victims are speaking out about the predator who groomed and targeted them for years while the club and the Gymnastics Federation allegedly stood idle. Carte Blanche investigates why Bezuidenhout’s alleged abuse was permitted to continue for so long.\n\nFind more exclusive content on Carte Blanche: The Podcast: https://linktr.ee/carteblanchetv",

Six people were killed and millions of rands of damage was done to public and private property. At the centre of the stand-off was a demand that taxi impoundments should be limited and thousands of confiscated vehicles released. Chaos and violence spilled onto the streets and, for eight days, commuters were stranded and local businesses put at risk. But despite taxi bosses pushing hard to force the city to loosen its iron grip on the industry, officials held firm. Now, the precarious truce between the City of Cape Town on one hand and the taxi industry on the other masks the deep suspicion with which they view each other.

It was set to be a freezing, cold week for most of the country, the below-zero temperatures and the unexpected snowfall resurrecting an old foe for South Africans: the dreaded stage six power cuts. For several weeks, Eskom had offered the country an unexpected reprieve from the higher stages of loadshedding, lulling many into the belief that the national utility finally had a grip on the power crisis. But this was short-lived. This week, as many braced themselves for a harsh July, Eskom announced continuous stage six loadshedding over the weekend, ushering in renewed levels of uncertainty.
