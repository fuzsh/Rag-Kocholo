Many doubted whether the one-point advantage from the first leg would be enough, but the Men in Black and Gold took an early lead which they never lost, and they ended up comfortable winners, despite having two tries ruled out by the TMO.\n\nThe game started at a frantic pace. First, Elliot Daly created space for Tom Palmer to make ground down the right, only for his pass to Will Helu to be intercepted. Stade launched a counterattack, with skipper Sergio Parisse blasting through the midfield, before possession was lost just outside the Wasps 22.\n\nIn the seventh minute, Wasps opened the score with a magnificent try by Tom Varndell, in the left corner. Andy Goode added the extra points with a fine kick from the touchline, made even harder by the blustery wind. 37-29 to Wasps on aggregate.\n\nSix minutes later, after some more excellent play by Wasps, with James Haskell again featuring prominently against his former club, Stade were penalised at the breakdown, just outside the 22. This time, Goode sent his kick to the right of the posts, 15 metres in from the right touchline.\n\nWithin a minute, it was Waspsâ turn to be penalised, just short of their 10-metre line, in midfield. Jules Plisson made no mistake with his kick and the score was 7-3 on the day, 37-32 overall.\n\nThe Wasps defence was severely tested, after Parisse burst downfield deep into the 22, but from turnover ball, Stade regained possession, only for Tom Varndell to intercept a wild pass and feed Joe Simpson, who raced away from just inside his own half to touch down between the posts. Referee Nigel Owens referred Guy Thompsonâs tackle to the TMO and the try was eventually ruled out. The officials also studied a clash between James Haskell and Alexandre Flanquart and both players were sent to the bin. Once order was restored, Plisson made no mistake with the penalty from the site of the high tackle, and the score was now 7-6 on the day, 37-35 on aggregate.\n\nThe home side made a mess of the lineout a few metres inside the Wasps half, Wasps gathered the loose ball and put in a kick downfield. Julien Arias threw the ball away in touch handing Wasps a penalty, and Andy Goode was on target to put his 10-6 ahead on the day, 40-35 overall. Haskell and Flanquart returned to play and the score remained into half time.\n\nThe second half started with the same attacking ambition of the first, with both sides guilty of erratic passing as possession swung to and fro. Wasps thought they were away but a pass was adjudged to have gone forwards. Stade won a penalty at the scrum, and Plissonâs kick towards the corner set up a threatening position, 10 metres from the Wasps line, but the Wasps forwards stopped the lineout drive and were rewarded with the put-in to a scrum.\n\nAndy Goodeâs penalty kick dropped short, but a minute later, the fly half was floored by a late challenge by Antoine Burban who was shown a yellow card. Wasps went for touch, and despite a glorious offload by Matt Mullan stretching the depleted Stade defence, possession was lost to a spill a few metres from the line.\n\nPlissonâs kick failed to find touch in clearing and the ball was gathered by Will Helu, who fed Andrea Masi; he hoisted a kick downfield which he leapt to gather, and Tom Varndell raced over between the posts from 35 metres but was again denied after the TMO ruled Masi had knocked on.\n\nAs the game entered the final quarter, Haskell broke through a tackle to feed Ashley Johnson, whose offload sent Guy Thompson over near the posts. Goode landed the conversion, to stretch the lead to eleven points, 6-17.\n\nWith heavy rain falling, Wasps withstood the next period of Stade pressure and eventually rewarded with a penalty; the ensuing lineout and a strong drive was stopped illegally by the homeside and Andy Goode tried to put his side more than two scores ahead on aggregate, with just over 6 minutes left. Agonisingly, he sent his kick wide, but a minute later another penalty arrived and this time, Goode made no mistake and the score finished at 6-20 with under 5 minutes left.\n\nWasps continued to control possession well and were able to bring on all their replacements in the closing minutes. The final whistle went, to scenes of jubilation from the players and the sizeable contingent of supporters who had made the trip to the French capital.\n\n15 Hugo Bonneval 14 Julien Arias 13 Waisea Vuidravuwalu 12 Jonathan Danty 11 Digby Ioane 10 Jules Plisson 9 JÃ©rÃ´me Fillol 1 Heike Van Der Merwe 2 Laurent Sempere 3 Davit Kubriashvili 4 Alexandre Flanquart 5 Pascal PapÃ© 6 Antoine Burban 7 Scott Lavalla 8 SERGIO PARISSE (C) BENCH: 16 Michael Van Vuuren 17 Zakaria Tolafau 18 Rabah Slimani 19 Anton Van Zyl 20 David Lyons 21 Morne Steyn 22 Julien Dupuy 23 Meyer Bosman\n\nSCORERS P: Plisson (2) Flanquart, Burban, van Vuuren\n\n15 Andrea Masi 14 Will Helu 13 Elliot Daly 12 CHRIS BELL (C) 11 Tom Varndell 10 Andy Goode 9 Joe Simpson 1 Matt Mullan 2 Carlo Festuccia 3 Phil Swainston 4 Joe Launchbury 5 Tom Palmer 6 Ashley Johnson 7 James Haskell 8 Guy Thompson BENCH: 16 Tom Lindsay 17 Simon McIntyre 18 Taione Vea 19 Kearnan Myall 20 Ed Jackson 21 Charlie Davies 22 Joe Carlisle 23 Charlie Hayter\n\nSCORERS T: Varndell, Thompson C: Goode (2) P: Goode (2) Haskell\n\nReferee: Nigel Owens (WRU) Asst Referee: Ian Davies (WRU), Sean Brickell (WRU) TMO: Derek Bevan (WRU) Citing Commissioner: Jeff Mark (WRU)\n\nWHILE the two Heineken Cup semi-finals were markedly different in terms of the outcome, a momentous penultimate stage of Europeâs premier club rugby tournament has thrown up a classic Anglo-French decider between reigning champions, RC Toulon, and the rising star of Saracens.\n\nWith the road to the 2014 final at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, 24 May now clear, there was passion, colour, tension and some truly outstanding rugby on show during what was another memorable weekend.\n\nFirst up were Saracens and ASM Clermont Auvergne at Twickenham Stadium where both clubs had points to prove: Saracens had failed to win a Heineken Cup semi-final in their two previous attempts, and Clermont were determined to go one better than last season when they fell to French rivals, Toulon, at the final hurdle.\n\nIn the end, all the pointers towards a tight contest between two in-form sides were quickly set aside as Saracens produced one of the most emphatic knockout stage performances in the 19-season history of the tournament.\n\nSemi-final records were sent tumbling as the Aviva Premiership leaders stormed to a remarkable six-try 46-6 victory to book their place in a Heineken Cup final for the first time.\n\nInspired by the confrontational defence of Heineken Man of the Match, Jacques Burger, who produced an outstanding 27 tackles during his 69-minute shift, Saracens simply blew away a shell-shocked Clermont.\n\nThe French side appeared to be unsettled by the award of a penalty try when Brock James was ruled to have deliberately palmed the ball over the dead ball line after 12 minutes, and in truth they never recovered as Saracens simply owned Twickenham with a remarkable display of physical power and opportunism which has set the scene for a what promises to be a titanic clash with the holders, Toulon, in the Welsh capital next month.\n\nToulon were made to battle all the way in sun-kissed Marseille where Munster fell agonisingly short in a semi-final on French soil for a second season in a row.\n\nIt finished 24-16 in the championsâ favour at the Stade VÃ©lodrome where nearly 40,000 spectators were treated to a ferocious arm-wrestle. Munster, who were appearing in a record 11th tournament semi-final, appeared to be hanging on for long periods, but typically, they delivered a finishing surge which almost spoiled the Toulon party.\n\nOnce again, Jonny Wilkinson, held the key with 21 points from his trusty left boot while Delon Armitage added a booming long-range penalty. The irrepressible Simon Zeboâs second half try gave Munster hope and with Ian Keatley and Paul OâConnell leading the way, the Irish brought the contest right down to the wire only to miss out on a final place yet again.\n\nFrom now, the focus is on the showdown between Toulon and Saracens at the magnificent Millennium Stadium in just under four weeksâ time. European rugby will be holding its breath in anticipation of a contest of heavyweight proportions.\n\nSARACENS 46 - 6 CLERMONT AUVERGNE\n\nTwickenham - Saturday 26 April 2014\n\nKO: 15:40 BST HT: 24-6 Att: 25,942\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED MINUTE BY MINUTE...\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 0mins And we have KO from a very sunshiny Twickers...with a lot of Munster fans!\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 1min Sarries kick off well but knock on from both sides & Clermont clear Sarries out of their 22\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 2mins Scrum Sarries just inside Clermont's 10m; goes down & a knock on so Clermont clear\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 3mins An infringement from British Lion Mako Vunipola loses possession for Sarries...\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 4mins Scrum on Sarries 22 but Owen Farrell kicks it sublimely all the way back to opposite 22\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 5mins Ref Nigel Owens clears up the knock on header debate...it's not a knock on!\n\nSaracens 0-0 Clermont 6mins A touch of aerial ping pong before Sarries attack fiercely with intent...\n\nSaracens 5-0 Clermont 7mins Alex Goode > Schalk Brits > Brad Barritt > Chris Ashton & 4 blinds for Ashy to score\n\nSaracens 7-0 Clermont 8mins Most excellent work from homeside & Goode converts to take a deserved lead\n\nSaracens 7-0 Clermont 10mins That's Ashy's 15th try this season including international matches!

The Aviva Premiership leaders will be looking to go one better than last season when they fell at the same hurdle at the same venue, while Clermont, who are appearing in a third successive semi-final, will no doubt be motivated by their agonising defeat in last yearâs decider.\n\nThe following day, Sunday, 27 April sees reigning champions, Toulon: gunning for a fourth European final in five years: taking on Munster Rugby at the atmospheric Stade VÃ©lodrome in Marseille in the second of the semi-finals. The game will mark Munsterâs 11th appearance in a Heineken Cup semi, eclipsing the record the Irish province had held jointly with Toulouse.\n\nAnd on the subject of Toulouse, the four-time champions came to Thomond Park for the first time in their illustrious history last weekend with high hopes of knocking Munster off their perch only to find themselves on the wrong end of a truly storming home performance.\n\nIn front of a packed house, Munster piled on the pressure right from the off and wound up scoring six tries on their way to a rampant 47-23 victory. CJ Stander came off the bench to replace the injured Peter OâMahony during the first half, and on his 24th birthday, the former South Africa Under 20 captain produced an outstanding performance to deservedly earn the Heineken Man of the Match award. Meanwhile, Ian Keatleyâs assured 17 points moved him to the top of this seasonâs scoring charts on 79 where he is currently level with Toulonâs Jonny Wilkinson.\n\nAfter Munster had powered their way into the last four, it was the turn of Clermont to attempt to preserve their astonishing unbeaten record at Stade Marcel-Michelin and that they duly did with a 22-16 victory over Leicester Tigers.\n\nAhead 19-7 at the break, it appeared to be plain sailing for the home side, but Leicester were typically defiant during the second half and with Owen Williams impressing at No 10, they could well have snatched the game during a ferociously competitive closing quarter.\n\nIn the end, Clermont held on to register win number 75 at Marcel-Michelin and book their semi-final place at Twickenham where Saracens will try to halt the French clubâs march to a second successive final.\n\nIf Clermont were well and truly under the cosh in the dying moments, it was nothing to what Saracens had to endure at Ravenhill where Ulster were reduced to 14 men in the fifth minute following the sending-off of full back, Jared Payne, by referee Jerome Garces.\n\nFired up by a raucous home support, Ulster somehow contrived to lead 9-5 at the break, and even though they also lost Rory Best and Ruan Pienaar to injury, they almost managed to turn the game around in a nerve-shredding final play before Saracens emerged 17-15 victors.\n\nQUARTER-FINALS REVIEW\n\nBy dint of a 3-0 try count, Sarries deserved their success, and with Scotland captain, Kelly Brown, coming off the bench to make his 50th Heineken Cup appearance, Chris Ashton caught the eye once again with two tries to move him up to a total of nine for the season so far. The flying wing is now within touching distance of the tournament individual record of 10 tries in a season set by Sebastien Carrat of Brive in 1996/97.\n\nLast, but by no means least, the Heineken Cup roadshow continued on to Stade Felix-Mayol in Toulon where the champions moved a step nearer to winning back-to-back titles with a 29-14 success over Leinster Rugby in front of their deliciously partisan fans.\n\nAt 6-6 at the changeover, Leinster were in pole position to capitalise on Jonny Wilkinsonâs first-half exit due to a hamstring strain, but Toulonâs sheer physicality, combined with a master class at the breakdown from Steffon Armitage, simply wore the Irish province down.\n\nThe game marked the end of the European line for one of rugbyâs most gifted players, Brian OâDriscoll, who bowed out of the competition with three Heineken Cup winnerâs medals, 33 tries and 87 appearances to his name.\n\nWhile OâDriscoll reflects on a stellar career in European club rugby, this seasonâs tournament rumbles on via the semi-finals later this month to what promises to be a magnificent conclusion at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 24 May.\n\nMERITOCRACY PAYMENTS\n\nWith reigning champions, Toulon, and ASM Clermont Auvergne through to the Heineken Cup semi-finals for a second successive season, French clubs are set to receive at least an extra â¬2.25 million (euro) in meritocracy payments in addition to their share of ERC's distribution.\n\nEnglish clubs are in line to receive an additional â¬1.8 million (euro) with Saracens through to the Heineken Cup semi-finals and an all-English final now guaranteed in the Amlin Challenge Cup.\n\nWith three clubs in the Heineken Cup quarter-finals, and with Munster Rugby through to the semi-finals, Ireland will receive at least â¬1.8 million (euro). Further meritocracy payments will be made to qualifiers for the finals.\n\nA total of â¬6.75 million (euro) will be allocated in meritocracy payments with approximately â¬453,000 (euro) for each spot in the Heineken Cup knockout stage and for the final of the Amlin Challenge Cup.\n\nMUNSTER RUGBY 47 -

The ties in early April will positively bristle with atmosphere and quality as Ulster host Saracens, Clermont take on Leicester Tigers, holders Toulon clash with European specialists, Leinster, and Toulouse go to fortress Thomond Park for the first time in their history.\n\nMeanwhile, Northampton Saints, Harlequins and Gloucester Rugby have qualified for the Amlin Challenge Cup quarter-finals as the third, fourth and fifth best pool runners-up where they will join Amlin pool winners, Bath Rugby, London Wasps, Stade Francais Paris, Sale Sharks and Brive.\n\nAs the premier competition was delivering another rollercoaster Round 6 full of intrigue, spectators were voting with their feet to set a new Heineken Cup pool stage attendance record. The total for the six rounds went through the 900,000 barrier for the first time in history, rising to an impressive 921,196, and last weekend, there were sell-outs at Thomond Park, Welford Road and the RDS, along with record crowds at Cardiff Arms Park and Scotstoun.\n\nPOOL 1\n\nLEINSTER RUGBY 36 -

Not alone are Heineken Cup quarter-final places on the line, the third, fourth and fifth best pool runners-up will book quarter-final slots in the Amlin Challenge Cup.\n\nWith â¬7 million (euro) to be shared in meritocracy payments among the countries of the clubs who qualify for the knockout stages of ERC's tournaments, the stakes are as high as ever as Round 6 approaches.\n\nLeicester and Ulster are set for what promises to be a titanic struggle at Welford Road next Saturday to decide who tops Pool 5, while three-time tournament winners, Leinster, need just one point from their game against Ospreys at the RDS to clinch Pool 1. If Saracens manage to see off the challenge Connacht Rugby at Alliianz Park next Saturday, they will join Toulouse as qualifiers from Pool 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Northampton Saints are still in the mix to secure their place in the last eight, but they will probably need to defeat Castres Olympique with a bonus point at Franklin's Gardens in their final Pool 1 fixture and hope that Leinster slip up.\n\nNorthampton are also in contention for Amlin Challenge Cup qualification along with Cardiff Blues, Edinburgh Rugby, Harlequins, Connacht Rugby, Glasgow Warriors, Scarlets, Gloucester Rugby, Exeter Chiefs and Castres.\n\nPOOL 1\n\nOSPREYS 17 -

But ultimately the French went down 21-12 in a second defeat in a group dominated by former champions Leinster.\n\nThe Ospreys were largely playing for pride in front of their home fans and in the end Castres' poor record on the road - this was their 14th defeat in their last 15 away tournament matches - played a part in the Ospreys notching up another Liberty Stadium success.\n\nLEINSTER 9 - 18 NORTHAMPTON SAINTS\n\nAviva Stadium - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 18:00 HT: 3-7 Att: tbc\n\nLeinster P: Madigan (3)\n\nSaints T: North, Elliott C: Myler P: Myler DG: Fotuali'i\n\nIN a reversal of fortune for Northampton Saints from the previous weekâs 33-point annihilation by Leinster Rugby, the Englanders arrived with vengeance foremost in their minds. Utilising incredible defence against a fired-up home crowd in Dublin, the Saints blasted away the Irish sideâs 100% Pool 1 record in a nail-biting Aviva Stadium thriller, cutting Leinster's lead at the top of the group to just 4 points. The reigning Amlin Challenge Cup champions were playing their 125th tournament match but suffered only their second defeat from their last 17 home contests.\n\nBritish & Irish Lions star George North scored the first of only two tries after 5 minutes, deftly converted by Stephen Myler, even though the latter had a rotten day with the boot. The second came at the other end of the match, after Jamie Elliott performed a breath-taking 100m sprint from one tryline to the other by in the 81st minute.\n\nThe stats belie observation, with Leinster dominating both possession and territory, but it appeared that the Saints were far ahead on both counts. USA Eagles No8 Samu Manoa was deservedly awarded Man of the Match following an immense performance, though it could just as well have gone to the talismanic captain, Dylan Hartley. The visiting team gelled from the outset, in stark contrast from last week, and were the epitome of a well-oiled rugby machine in every aspect, having paid clear attention to the previous matchâs deficits. Not many clubs have managed to forge a way through Leinsterâs near impenetrable centre partnership, and though the homeside did not look particularly deficient, Northampton rattled their cage enough to cause rifts and take advantage.\n\nThe score was 3-7 by the 10th minute, and remained there through half time. Leinster kept in touch to within a point at 6-7 until the final quarter, both sides illustrating impressive resilience in defence under huge pressure, not surprisingly resulting in a high penalty count on both sides with Leinster at 13 and Saints 10. But lucky for Leinster, Myler missed 2 of 3 penalty kicks at the uprights as well as a conversion. Meanwhile, replacement Kahn Fotualiâi arrived on the paddock and kicked over a sublime drop goal in the 78th minute, taking the score to 9-13.\n\nIan Madigan maintained a 100% record for the homeside, but it was not enough; every time Leinster neared the tryline, Saintsâ defence held them out, even at the death as wave upon wave attacked the width of the whitewash. Jamie Heaslip made the final charge on the line as the clock turned red but he slipped up, allowing Elliott to collect and charge for sweet revenge for the pain of the previous week, ending the game with a 18-9 win.\n\nPOOL 2\n\nGLASGOW WARRIORS 7 - 9 CARDIFF BLUES\n\nScotstoun Stadium - Friday 13 December 2013\n\nKO: 20:00 HT: 0-6 Att: tbc\n\nWarriors T: Grant C: Weir\n\nBlues P: Patchell, Halfpenny (2) Hobbs\n\nCARDIFF BLUES took top spot in Pool 2 with a second straight win over Glasgow Warriors at Scotstoun on Friday night. The Welsh side edged a tense encounter 9-7 as they backed up last week's 29-20 success at the Arms Park to make it three wins in four in Europe. They now sit 3 points clear of Heineken Cup holders RC Toulon ahead of the French side's home tie with Exeter Chiefs at the Stade Felix Mayol on Saturday.\n\nA huge early penalty from Rhys Patchell and another in either half from Leigh Halfpenny gave the Blues a deserved win against a Glasgow side who struggled to build any momentum throughout. A late converted try from prop Ryan Grant gave the home team hope with 9 minutes left but Duncan Weir missed a chance to win it for the Warriors when he pushed a long-range penalty wide of the posts with a minute-and-a-half remaining.\n\nTOULON 32 - 20 EXETER CHIEFS\n\nStade FÃ©lix Mayol - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 14:35 HT: 15-10 Att: tbc\n\nToulon T: David Smith (2), Chiocci, Wilkinson C: Giteau (3) P: Giteau (2)\n\nChiefs T: Armand, White C: Slade, Sweeney P: Slade (2)\n\nTOULON returned to the top of Pool 2 after a bonus point win over battling Exeter Chiefs, maintaining their unbeaten run at Stade Mayol in the Heineken Cup. The second of David Smithâs tries was quite obviously the result of a forward pass, but referee John Lacey decided not, and was the 5 point difference at half time between the sides. Hot on the heels of their 14-9 defeat against the reigning champions at Sandy Park, the Chiefs put in another great performance and were still within 5 points of their hosts moving into the final quarter, despite Chiocciâs 64th minute try. But Jonny Wilkinson came onto the field in the second half and immediately grabbed the bonus point try that put the game beyond the visitors. Even though they were down, the Chiefs were not out and they ended the scoring with a Ben White consolation try that showed off their character.\n\nPOOL 3\n\nSARACENS 64 - 3 ZEBRE\n\nAllianz Park - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 15:00 HT: 29-3 Att: tbc\n\nSaracens T: Strettle, Burger, George, Wigglesworth, Ransom, Taylor (2), Billy Vunipola, Ashton C: Farrell (8) P: Farrell Wray\n\nZebre P: Orquera Cattina\n\nSARACENS turned on the style to celebrate their first Heineken Cup contest at Allianz Park by running riot with nine tries and sent Zebre crashing to a heavy Pool 3 defeat, with Luciano Orquera only managing to convert one of two penalties to give the visitors a paltry 3 points. Farrell marshalled the north London side to the win, and it took them only 26 minutes to secure the bonus point through Richard Wigglesworthâs try set up by Chris Ashton and Duncan Taylor, who each later scored their own. England's newest No8 bulldozed his way over for try number 8. The try bonus point swept Sarries up to 15 points, with their trip to Toulouse in Round 5 in the New Year set to decide the group winner and with it automatic knock-out stage qualification.\n\nCONNACHT RUGBY 9 - 37 TOULOUSE\n\nThe Sportsground - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 18:00 HT:Â 9-22 Att: tbc\n\nConnacht P: Parks DG: Parks (2)\n\nToulouse T: MÃ©dard (2), Tolofua, Picamoles, Fickou C: Beauxis (3) P: Beauxis (2)\n\nTOULOUSE got their quest for a fifth Heineken Cup crown back on track with a bonus-point win over Connacht in Galway. The Irish outfit had stunned the continent's most-successful side by winning 16-14 at the Stade Ernest Wallon last Sunday but a much-improved Toulouse ensured there would be no repeat at the Sportsground. Connachtâs Dan Parks opened the scoring in the second minute with a penalty, followed up with two drop goals. But the early lead was lost after just 4 minutes by Lionel Beauxis. Toulouse scored five tries in a 37-9 success with Maxime MÃ©dard grabbing a brace and Christopher Tolofua also touching down in the first half, with Louis Picamoles crossing after the interval and Gael Fickou scoring at the death. Beauxis added 12 points with the boot courtesy of two penalties and three conversions as Toulouse regained top spot in Pool 3 after Saracens had leapfrogged them earlier in the day with another big win over Zebre.\n\nPOOL 4\n\nSCARLETS 13 - 31 CLERMONT AUVERGNE\n\nParc y Scarlets - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 15:40 HT:Â 13-10 Att: tbc\n\nScarlets T: Maule C: Priestland P: Priestland (2)\n\nClermont T: Nalaga (2), PT, Lee C: Delany, James (3) P: Delany Rougerie\n\nNAPOLIONI NALAGA scored one of the fastest tries in Heineken Cup history as ASM Clermont-Auvergne took control of Pool 4 with a bonus-point victory at Scarlets. Nalaga pounced after just 17 seconds for the first of his two tries that secured victory at Parc Y Scarlets. The power of the French scrum also proved decisive after winning a penalty try while replacement Fritz Lee stepped off the bench to score. The result means Clermont are sure to end round 4 at least 3 points clear at the top of the pool while the Scarlets can now only realistically aim for second place and a place in the Amlin Challenge Cup quarters.\n\nClermont were unbeaten in five previous meetings with Scarlets and could not have got off to a better start when Josh Turnbull lost possession from the kick-off and Nalaga, who had scored twice in the home win the previous weekend, won the foot race for Thierry Lacrampe's kick. But the Scarlets recovered from what could have proved a knock-out blow and led 13-10 at half-time. Clermont lost their talismanic captain AurÃ©lien Rougerie to the sin-bin for punching and Rhys Priestland kicked the resulting penalty. But three second half tries elevated the visitors to another level as they cleaned up winning it 21-0.\n\nHARLEQUINS 17 - 3 RACING MÃTRO 92\n\nThe Twickenham Stoop - Sunday 15 December 2013\n\nKO: 12:45 HT:Â 14-0 Att: tbc\n\nHarlequins T: Walker P: Evans (3), Botica\n\nRacing P: Sexton Khinchagashvili\n\nHistory has written no club has ever qualified for the quarter finals in the Heineken Cup after losing in the first two rounds, but it appears Harlequins are determined to buck the trend with back to back wins home and away in rounds 3 and 4 against Racing MÃ©tro 92. But what has also been proved is money does not buy wins.\n\nThe French side may have an open cheque book to recruit some of the classiest players in the world, but without the glue to bring about cohesion, 15 detached players do not make a team. Last week Quins destroyed Racing 32-8, and this week under quite horrid wet and slightly windy conditions, allowed the visitors just a 3-pointer, though British & Irish Lion Johnny Sexton did miss his first attempt to overcome the uprights.\n\nFollowing a minuteâs silence for Nelson Mandela, in a fraught and tempestuous match on Sunday afternoon Quins dominated possession and territory in the first half. Quins Academy recruit, 20 year old Charlie Walker who has already pulled on the England Rose for 7s and U20s, shone through with a stunning try, the only one of the match. Stalwart fly half Nick Evans did not have the best day with the boot, but still managed to work through his battered shoulder for the first half, clocking up three penalties before young Ben Botica took over in the second, who added a fourth to clock up 17 points for the homeside.\n\nThe convincing win takes Quins just 4 points short of Pool 4 leaders Clermont, and next up they face the Tournament favourites at home before heading to Wales to Scarlets for a final bid to qualify for the play offs.\n\nPOOL 5\n\nBENETTON TREVISO 3 - 35 ULSTER RUGBY\n\nStadio Comunale di Monigo - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 14:35 HT:Â 3-11 Att: tbc\n\nTreviso P: di Bernardo Williams, McLean\n\nUlster T: Luke Marshall, Gilroy, Diack, Payne C: Jackson (3) P: Jackson (3)\n\nULSTER surged further ahead at the top of Pool 5 after they secured maximum points from their clash with Benetton Treviso at the Stadio di Monigo on Saturday afternoon. The 1999 Heineken Cup winners scored four tries to claim a bonus point against the Italians for the second week running following the 48-0 thrashing in Belfast seven days ago. A hat-trick of second-half scores from Craig Gilroy, Robbie Diack and Jared Payne accompanied a late first-half effort from Luke Marshall as Ulster made it four wins from four games following earlier successes against Leicester Tigers and Montpellier, whilst Treviso could muster only a single 3-pointer. Ulster never looked like losing their unbeaten record once Marshall crossed 2 minutes before the break, but they left it late to grab the bonus point when Payne dived over with not much more than a minute remaining. Ulster Rugby remain the sole team still able to boast four from four ahead of the final two rounds of matches in the New Year.\n\nMONTPELLIER 14 - 15 LEICESTER TIGERS\n\nStade Yves-du-Manoir - Sunday 15 December 2013\n\nKO: 16:00 HT: 0-0 Att: tbc\n\nMontpellier T: Selphoni, Dupont C: Paillaugue, Escande\n\nTigers T: Tom Youngs, Goneva C: Lamb P: Lamb Benjamin\n\nLEICESTER TIGERS broke French hearts in the 79th minute of a bizarre and dogged match -with a try from Niki Goneva- that completed a first half with the score at 0-0.\n\nMontpellier had made 14 changes from the side who went down 41-32 at Welford Road, and when Tigers wing Miles Benjamin was shown a yellow card for a block on scrum half Benoit Paillaugue, the game opened up in the second quarter. Twice Montpellier got within 5 metres of the Tiger's line and wasted the opportunity. And a missed penalty at half time from Benoit Paillaugue could have been the difference before both sides trundled into the break scoreless.\n\nTigers thought they had eventually broken the deadlock on 47 minutes when Miles Benjamin went over in the corner after an initial break by Ben Youngs, but the TMO spotted a foot in touch. Two tries in 10 minutes from outside half Enzo Selponi and wing Lucas Dupont looked to have secured Montpellier the win after Tom Youngs had crossed for the visitors 50 minutes into the match. But Goneva closed the gap on Pool 5 leaders Ulster with his late try converted by replacement fly half Ryan Lamb (after Toby Flood went off with a suspected hamstring), the only time the Midlanders led during the 80 minutes.\n\nPOOL 6\n\nPERPIGNAN 17 - 18 MUNSTER RUGBY\n\nStade AimÃ© Giral - Saturday 14 December 2013\n\nKO: 16:40 HT:Â 9-3 Att: tbc\n\nPerpignan T: Benvenuti P: Allan (4) Terrain\n\nMunster T: PT, Hanrahan C: Keatley P: Keatley (2) O'Mahony\n\nA last-gasp try from JJ Hanrahan put Munster in pole position in Pool 6 after yet another thrilling Heineken Cup finish against Perpignan. The first half saw the homeside waltz into a 9-3 half time lead with three penalties form the boot of Tommy Allan, as compared to Ian Keatleyâs one, made more painful for the visitors after Sean Dougalâs early try was disallowed for earlier obstruction. Italian international Tommaso Benvenuti looked to have dealt Munster's hopes of a third Heineken Cup crown a heavy blow when he crossed with less than 2 minutes remaining, but Rob Penney's men kept the ball alive from the restart, with Denis Hurley and Tommy O'Donnell setting up Hanrahan's heroics. With the clock already in the red at the Stade AimÃ© Giral, Hanrahan produced a stunning sidestep from 25 metres out to touch down out wide and hand the 2006 and 2008 champions a third win in four pool games.\n\nGLOUCESTER 10 - 16 EDINBURGH\n\nKingsholm - Sunday 15 December 2013\n\nKO: 15:00 HT:Â 7-9 Att: tbc\n\nGloucester T: PT C: Burns P: Burns Morgan\n\nEdinburgh T: Atiga C: Cuthbert P: Cuthbert (3) Nel\n\nEDINBURGH did PRO12 colleagues Munster a huge favour as they reversed their home defeat to Gloucester to leave the Irishmen sitting pretty five points clear at the top of Pool 6. Alan Solomons freshened up his side from the 23-12 defeat at Murrayfield a week earlier and his new look team surprised the home side with the tenacity of their defence, control at the breakdown and patience with ball in hand. By the end they were good value for what was only their fourth win in 16 Heineken Cup games on English soil. The victory also ended a run of five successive defeats in Europe for the Scottish capital club.\n\nA tight first half saw Edinburgh twice take the lead through the boot of full back Jack Cuthbert. He kicked two opening penalties to open up a 6 point lead before Gloucester finally got on the scoreboard after 35 minutes with a penalty try converted by Burns. But a third penalty from Cuthbert and the Scots went into the break with a slim advantage.\n\nBurns took the lead with a penalty 5 minutes in to the second half, but that was it for Gloucester. Edinburgh, however, were not done and Ben Atiga found the whitewash before the final quarter had begun. Cuthbert converted and the scoring was done for the match, though both teams saw yellow in the remaining 20 minutes as Edinburgh held Gloucester at bay.\n\nPOOL 1\n\nCASTRES OLYMPIQUE 15 - 9 OSPREYS\n\nStade Pierre Antoine - Friday 06 December 2013\n\nKO: 21:00 HT: 6-6 Att: 7,108\n\nCASTRES OLYMPIQUE closed the gap on Leinster in Pool 1 of the Heineken Cup after clinging on for a hard-fought victory over the Ospreys. The French champions lost in Dublin in Round 2 but drew level with the three-time tournament champions on eight points to kick-start their campaign. The first half saw both sides go toe to toe on penalties, running into the break at 6-all, but the visitors also had to contend with being a player down in each half, and were unable to find the edge required to get passed their opponents. Castres were determined not to let the Ospreys take an inch right up until the final whistle, but professional fouls did land them with two sin binnings though not until the 80th minute thus not affecting the outcome. Kicking over five penalties to three, Castres remain very much in the running for qualification following the slender win.\n\nCastres Olympique: Brice Dulin, Marcel Garvey, Romain Cabannes (C), Paul Bonnefond, Remi Grosso, Daniel Kirkpatrick, Rory Kockott, Mihaita Lazar, Marc-Antoine Rallier, Karena Wihongi, Christophe Samson, Richie Gray, Ibrahim Diarra, Piula Faasalele, Pedrie Wannenburg BENCH: Michael Coetzee, Yannick Forestier, Anton Peikrishvili, Rodrigo Capo Ortega, Yannick Caballero, Julien Tomas, Seremaia Bai, Geoffrey Palis\n\nSCORERS P: Kockott (4), Palis Bai, Palis\n\nOspreys: Richard Fussell, Aisea Natoga, Tom Isaacs, Ben John, Jeff Hassler, Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb, Ryan Bevington, Scott Baldwin, Aaron Jarvis, Alun-Wyn Jones (C), James King, Tyler Ardron, Justin Tipuric, Ryan Jones BENCH: Richard Hibbard, Duncan Jones, Dan Suter, Morgan Allen, Sam Lewis, Thomas Habberfield, Matthew Morgan , Thomas Grabham\n\nSCORERS P: Biggar (3) Natoga, Lewis\n\nReferee: Peter Fitzgibbon (Ireland)\n\nNORTHAMPTON SAINTS 7 - 40 LEINSTER\n\nFranklin's Gardens - Saturday 07 December 2013\n\nKO: 18:00 HT: 0-26 Att: 13,745\n\nLEINSTER RUGBY took full control of Pool 1 with a stunning first-half display against Northampton Saints at Franklin's Gardens. The Irish giants took a huge step towards the knockout stages as they scored four unanswered tries in the opening 40 minutes to secure a bonus point before the interval. The second half did not fare much better for the homeside with just a consolation try from Lee Dickson to slightly alleviate the utter embarrassment of a complete trouncing by the incumbent champions, the charge led by Brian O'Driscoll, with Luke Fitzgerald securing a hat trick. Matt O'Connor's men played some sublime rugby in the East Midlands in blowing away their in-form opponents with six tries in all to make it three wins from three following an away victory against the Ospreys and a home success against Castres Olympique.\n\nNorthampton Saints: James Wilson, Ken Pisi, Dom Waldouck, Luther Burrell, George North, Steve Myler, Lee Dickson, Alex Waller, Dylan Hartley (C), Salesi Ma'afu, Samu Manoa, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Phil Dowson, Sam Dickinson BENCH: Mikey Haywood, Ethan Waller, Tom Mercey, Christian Day, Calum Clark, Ryan Glynn, Glenn Dickson, Jamie Elliott\n\nSCORERS T: Lee Dixon C: Myler\n\nLeinster Rugby: Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney, Brian O'Driscoll, Gordon D'Arcy, Luke Fitzgerald, Ian Madigan, Eoin Reddan, Cian Healy, Sean Cronin, Mike Ross, Devin Toner, Mike McCarthy, Rhys Ruddock, Sean O'Brien, Jamie Heaslip (C) BENCH: Aaron Dundon, Jack McGrath, Martin Moore, Leo Cullen, Shane Jennings, Isaac Boss, Jimmy Gopperth, Zane Kirchner\n\nSCORERS T: Fitzgerald (3), Heaslip, Reddan, O'Driscoll C: Madigan (5) Bent\n\nReferee: Nigel Owens (Wales)\n\nPOOL 2\n\nCARDIFF BLUES 29-20 GLASGOW WARRIORS\n\nCardiff Arms Park - Friday 06 December 2013\n\nKO: 20:00 HT: 16-7 Att: 6,144\n\nCARDIFF BLUES leapt to the top of Pool 2 with a thrilling 29-20 victory over Glasgow Warriors. Wales pair Rhys Patchell and Alex Cuthbert crossed either side of half-time to hand Blues their second successive win. Sean Maitland and Leone Nakarawa matched the Blues two tries just as each half drew to a close, as but that could not prevent a disappointing night for the Warriors, who left the Arms Park empty-hand"
