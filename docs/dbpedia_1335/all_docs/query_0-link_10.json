        "text": "15: Toru Kurihara (Jap)\n\n14: Daisuke Ohata (Jap)\n\n13: Sukanaivalu Hufanga (Ton)\n\n12: Brian Lima (Sam)\n\n11: Rupeni Caucau (Fiji)\n\n10: Mike Hercus (USA)\n\n9: Agustin Pichot (Arg)\n\n1: Andrea Lo Cicero (Ita)\n\n2: David Dadunashvili (Geo)\n\n3: Roberto Grau (Arg)\n\n4: Apenisa Naevo (Fiji)\n\n5: Al Charron (Can)\n\n6: Schalke vd Merwe (Nam)\n\n7: Ovida Tonita (Rom)\n\n8: Semo Sititi (Sam)\n\nThe end of the pool stages mark the end of the road for 12 teams at the World Cup.\n\nAmong the 360 players who have packed their bags, for every Mario Ledesma, the Argentine hooker who had a nightmare in the opening game, there is a David Dadunashvili.\n\nThe Gerogian hooker will return home a national hero having had the honour of scoring his country's first World Cup try.\n\nBBC Sport selects a World Cup XV of unlucky losers, players who have stood out in a losing cause and could give this year's eventual world champions a run for their money.\n\n15. Toru Kurihara\n\nFull-back, Japan\n\nGiving a winger a number 15 shirt is nothing new in the modern game, and Japan coach Shogo Mukai could soon be taking a leaf out of our book.\n\nKurihara excelled in defence against the USA and he celebrated his try-scoring tackle towards the end with as much enthusiasm as any of his 21 points in the match.\n\nPace in abundance and a good boot to boot, unless he's a nervous wreck under the high ball, Shogo should shift him.\n\n14. Daisuke Ohata\n\nRight wing, Japan\n\nOhata is a try-scoring machine, with a ratio to compare with the best in the business.\n\nHardly surprising when pre-World Cup he was playing the likes of Korea and running in eight tries.\n\nBut the diminuitive flyer, who has won his country's version of Superstars, showed he is up to the challenge of playing the best, finishing off fantastic scores against France and the USA that left burn marks on the pitch.\n\n13. Sukanaivalu Hufanga\n\nOutside centre, Tonga\n\nHe did not start the tournament, but finished it with a bang.\n\nOverlooked for the opening game, the youngster improved with each match and added an extra dimension to the Tongan backline when called upon.\n\nHufanga injected speed and direction into an otherwise one-paced set of outside backs and will no doubt soon be refered to as a Tongan torpedo.\n\n12. Brian Lima\n\nInside centre, Samoa\n\nKnown as the chiropractor, because of his bone-crunching tackles, the former winger is a force to be reckoned with even in the autumn of his career.\n\nHis four outings at the tournament have given him what could prove a brief record of 16 consecutive World Cup matches.\n\nLima's undoubted moment of the tournament came in the second half against South Africa when he dumped Springbok fly-half Derick Hougaard with a thuddering tackle.\n\n11. Rupeni Caucaunibuca\n\nLeft wing, Fiji\n\nCaucaunibuca came into the tournament with a big reputation which he has only enhanced.\n\nThe Fijian flyer left the French defence for dead with a searing break from inside his own half to touch down under the posts but he ruined it by clocking Olivier Magne with a forearm jab which resulted in a two-match ban.\n\nHe was back to his best against the Scots with two further tries, but they were not enough to help Fiji into the quarter-finals.\n\n10. Mike Hercus\n\nFly-half, USA\n\nThe former Australian Under-21 international returned down under and showed the Wallabies, and the world, his wares.\n\nHis performances were all the more remarkable given that he missed a last-minute conversion that would have given his country a memorable win over Fiji.\n\nBut he bounced back and grew in confidence as the tournament progressed, directing operations in the backline with a full array of handling skills and his ever-reliable boot.\n\n9. Agustin Pichot\n\nScrum-half, Argentina\n\nSililo Martens may keep Tonga ticking over, but Pichot is a class apart.\n\nThe Puma never quite lived up to his billing and, although the schedule and the \"Pool of Death\" hindered his impact, even at 75% he is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe best players in the world should be involved in the business end of a global tournament. Unlucky loser? That will be those watching from the sidelines.\n\n1. Andrea Lo Cicero\n\nLoose-head prop, Italy\n\nItaly coach John Kirwan wanted his teams to play like their cars.\n\nLo Cicero would be the first to admit he is no Ferrari, more like the pick-up truck that tows the Prancing Horse when it goes lame.\n\nItaly may have limped out of the tournament, but their number one prop has shown himself to be a reliable and rugged practitioner of the front row union.\n\n2. David Dadunashvili\n\nHooker, Georgia\n\nThe 21-year-old will return home a national hero.\n\nOn their World Cup debut Georgia scored only one try, and Dadunashvili was the man who got it against former world champions South Africa.\n\nThe hooker's story is the stuff of legend, not least because he scored after dislocating his shoulder earlier in the match. The pain was no doubt worth it.\n\n3. Roberto Grau\n\nTight-head prop, Argentina\n\nGrau's World Cup ended in disarray when he was banned for nine weeks for the illegal use of his hand on an opponent's face.\n\nBut prior to that the bulky Argentine was the cornerstone of the predictably awesome south American scrum.\n\nHe refused to be daunted even against Ireland and Australia's scrummagers before a moment of madness cost overshadowed his tournament.\n\n4. Apenisa Naevo\n\nLock, Fiji\n\nA lock's life is hardly exotic, sticking your head where the sun don't shine and getting speared into the air at line-outs every so often.\n\nThat is unless your Naevo, who is more kicking horse than workhorse.\n\nThe 6ft 6in giant's lolloping gait has got him on the end of some flowing Fijian moves for tries against France and Japan.\n\n5. Al Charron\n\nLock, Canada\n\nThe oldest man in the tournament patched up his knees and proved his worth with some fine performances for the Cannucks.\n\nHe has had better days in the national jersey but when Canada played against Tonga, - a team at their level - he was head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch.\n\nThat was until he took a head and shoulders tackle from Pierre Hola. He deserved better than to leave the World Cup on a stretcher.\n\n6. Schalke van der Merwe\n\nBlind-side flanker, Namibia\n\nFor a man who head-butted a lion to get a baboon from its mouth, a game of rugby should be no problem.\n\nA number of flankers stood out in the pool stages but, in Namibia's winless campaign, van der Merwe emerged with great credit.\n\nHis sweaty mop of hair appeared all over the park, one minute making try-saving tackles, the next launching a rare African attack. He was his country's mane man.\n\n7. Ovida Tonita\n\nOpen-side flanker, Romania\n\nTonita may not have made the impact that other open-sides made in attacking quarters, but put him in a team going forward and he would doubtless be a revelation.\n\nOn the back foot the Romanian made an astounding 52 tackles in four matches, always willing and able to get up for more punishment.\n\nHe deserved better than to be on the end of some of the maulings his country took and their final win was reward for his efforts.\n\n8. Semo Sititi\n\nNumber eight, Samoa\n\nA host of number eights have shone at the tournament, including Italy's Sergio Parisse and Benhur Kivalu of Tonga.\n\nBut Sititi is the archetypal cliched captain leading from the front and no-one will feel Samoa's failure to beat South Africa more.\n\nHe scored a barnstorming try against Georgia and followed it up with another against England, but ran out of spunk against the Springboks."
