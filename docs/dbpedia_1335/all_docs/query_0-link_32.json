It is always a tough game against the hosts and Saturday’s game proved it again. Union took the lead by converting a penalty kick after applying pressure on Burgersdorp. The opposition then managed to score to a try through a mistake and poor defense from the Union team. Union managed to once again slot two more penalty kicks and Burgersdorp scored one more try in the 1st half going into the half-time break 9-12 in favour of Burgersdorp.\n\nIn the 2nd half the Union team managed to put the opposition under pressure through good structural play but we could just not get any more points on the board. Burgersdorp scored two more tries and won the match 9- 26.\n\nOther Results:\n\nU14: 0-10\n\nU15: 0-31\n\nU16: 10-19\n\nRepresenting your school is always a major honour, but reaching the milestone of 50 first team caps is something that does not come around too often.\n\nFive members of the Union High School, Graaff-Reinet 1st hockey team received the incredible honour of taking the field in their 50th match for their school!\n\nPrior to their encounter against Framesby this afternoon, Friday, 10 May, 𝗔𝗺𝘆 𝗪𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗼𝘄, 𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗿𝗮, 𝗧𝘆𝗿𝗮 𝗕𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝘆, 𝗔𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗲𝗹𝗲 and 𝗞𝗲𝗻𝘇𝗮 𝗡𝗲𝗶𝗹𝗹 were presented with their official 50 cap certificate as well as a small gift on behalf of the team in which they have so valiantly served for the past two years.\n\nAmy, Tara, Tyra, Aaminah and Kenza have been true ambassadors of the 1st XI and we could not be prouder of them.\n\n𝙒𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙣𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙢 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙞𝙧 𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙘𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙞𝙧 𝙩𝙚𝙖𝙢 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙞𝙧 𝙨𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙤𝙡.\n\nUnion High School, Graaff-Reinet was buzzing with excitement on Friday afternoon as we welcomed Framesby’s hockey girls to our campus for an afternoon of fierce competition.\n\nIn a closely contested encounter, the 𝘂/𝟭𝟰𝗔 teams drew 1-1, while the 𝘂/𝟭𝟲𝗔𝘀 match was equally intense, with the Union side putting up a valiant effort but ultimately falling short with a 2-3 loss against Framesby.\n\nHowever, it was the 𝟭𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 that truly stole the show, proving themselves to be a force to be reckoned with.
