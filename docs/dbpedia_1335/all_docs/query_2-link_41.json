Who knows? The result is in the book, and that is what\n\ncounts.\n\nIn the case of refs/linesmen. there is only one case that I can think of\n\nin the long history of rugby against \"the Enemy\" (SAf, in case you\n\ndidn't know we called you that) that a ref made a difference to results\n\nin a huge way. Dude with a name like a sneeze in the 1976 AB tour\n\n(Bezoudenheit?? My Afrikaans spelling is probably dreadful).\n\nOther than that (which was amazingly biased - really beyond belief), the\n\nABs should be good enough to beat the SAFs no matter who's refs we use,\n\nwhether the difference is in interpretation or (I am sure unconcious)\n\nbias. And conversely, the SAFs should be good enough to beat the ABs\n\nover here with our refs.\n\nNeutrals are the right thing to do, though.\n\nChris Hackney wrote:\n\n>\n\n> What did he (Bezuidenhout ??) do?

But then, I am a\n\nKiwi, and we lost the series 3-1.\n\nAs an example, in the last test, Bruce Robertson (easily the best centre\n\nNZ has ever produced) received the ball from Kevin Everleigh, and\n\nchipped the SAf fullback.

NZ and SA have a (roughly) comparable number of\n\ntop-class players, and there has seemed to me to be more SAfs caught\n\nspecifically for anabolic steroid abuse than NZers.\n\nOur testing programme is equally as good as yours. I actually put it\n\ndown to NZ having a (slight) bias in favour of smaller, more mobile\n\ntight forwards, when compared to SAf, meaning there is not the perceived\n\nneed for absolute size and strength, and therefore less pressure on the\n\ntop players to \"bulk up\".\n\nIt is only a theory, though, and I am quite willing to have it\n\ndisproved. It mainly comes from watching SA packs coming on to the\n\nfield over the years and thinking \"Fuck, they're big\" - BTW, this is\n\njust meant as a comment on the size of the forwards, not a dig at any\n\nmedical intake.\n\nAs for the 5-yr old bit, at least I had an argument and facts to back up\n\nmy theory, rather than just going maybe...maybe...maybe.\n\nRegards\n\nTim\n\nOn Wed, 09 Apr 1997 15:51:10 +1200, Tim Scrivens <scri...@xtra.co.nz>\n\nwrote:\n\n<<>This is not to drag up things that (really) no longer matter, but\n\njust\n\n>for info purposes.

However, I have looked at the film of the\n\nincident I referred to a number of times over the years, and I still\n\ncan't put that decision down to anything other than bias - it was that\n\nobvious. The ABs did lose a few provincial matches, but, like the SA\n\nteams over here, were never anything but totally tough in the tests.\n\nOh yeah, and while we're on the subject of the 76 tour, the touring\n\nparty included one player of the all-time 5 dirtiest players ever to\n\nplay for the ABs (Billy Bush). And we (modern) think Richard Loe is\n\nbad.\n\nThat was a great Lions team - the one that is coming over is (I think)\n\nheading into a shitstorm (on the field, I mean).\n\nIan Jennings wrote:\n\n> This stuff is pretty hard to substantiate. I recall the tour\n\n> quite well - the ABs were not that shit-hot.\n\nTrue. They were a pretty average team. There was also some strange\n\nselection decisions. The team seriously lacked a goal kicker. They took\n\na bloke called Kit Fawcett, who made history with the diplomatic\n\nstatement, \"I intend to score more off the field than on it\". The All\n\nBlacks ended up using a converted flyhalf in Duncan Robertson at\n\nfullback, as I recall.\n\nNZ also found it very hard to understad a lot of SA interpretations. In\n\nthose days tours were much less frequent, domestic competitions were\n\nvery insular, and countries very much had their own ways of doing\n\nthings. A neutral referee would have evened this out a lot.\n\nGiven all this, you only have to wonder why the ref had to resort to\n\nsuch abysmal prejudice. SA were quite capable of winning the series fair\n\nand square. To NZ's credit they came very close to drawing the series,\n\nif not actually winning it.\n\nMost New Zealanders who saw the series and who know anything at all\n\nabout rugby believe to this day that but for that one referee, the All\n\nBlacks would almost certainly have drawn that series.\n\n- Rick Boyd\n\nOn Sat, 12 Apr 1997 23:51:24 +1200, Tim Scrivens <scri...@xtra.co.nz>\n\nwrote:\n\n<<>Koos, you are confused.<>>>\n\nAbout what?\n\nI said:\n\n1.

Not incredibly tall, but very powerful, and able to cope pretty\n\nwell with Jonah 1 on 1 (or at least, better than anyone else - lot of\n\nrespect for that).\n\n> Like Olivier who looks like a small body builder.\n\n> And Stephen Brink who looks (as does Cullen) like a high school kid\n\n> with lots of speed.\n\n>\n\nMy point was that Lomu is the third (equal) tallest man in the ABs,\n\nwhich is a bit weird for a wing (would expect it to go locks, No 8,\n\nflankers and then to be fairly random). But none of the ABs make 6'6\",\n\nwhich is (relatively) short.\n\n> (By the way, the absence of Lomu and Vidiri still not able to play for\n\n> the AB's will hopefully mean that Brink will be a Bok wing this year.\n\n> Specially against the Lions who have smallish wings as well.

They say Cullen is 85 kilos. Come on !!!\n\n> I doubt very much if he is that big.\n\n> If he is 90 kg then Vidiri must be about 140 kg.\n\nSee, another big fat Fijian, and back to our original start.

Not a rated\n\nplayer for me, and you (SA) wouldn't ever put anyone of that standard on\n\nthe field.\n\n> So: Vidiri will run over Brink.

We\n\nplayed them because (especially in the case of the fullback) they may\n\ncost us 10 points a game between them, but they consistently scored 15.\n\nI thought last year, and in the World Cup, the SA defence did the best\n\njob on Lomu by mobbing him whenever possible, and giving him no room.\n\nBrink is fast and skilful, and surely deserves a chance of trying to see\n\nif hecan run round Vindiri a few times, just to even things up.\n\nI still reckon you should pick your best players, and if the opposition\n\nfields a Lomu, and you have a Terry Wright to oppose him, you have a\n\ngame plan that plays on Terrys' strengths, and Jonahs' weaknesses.\n\n>\n\n> This reminds me of a bit I read written by an English rugby writer\n\n> (cannot remember who).\n\n> He writes he spoke with the long ago Bok Flip Nel who said: \" Any test\n\n> should end with a score of 0 - 0 because you have two perfect teams\n\n> against each other.
