        "text": "The table-topping DHL Western Province Under-21 side is bracing for a tough encounter when they face up to the Leopards U21s at Olën Park in Potchefstroom on Saturday (kick-off 12h30).\n\n“We’re bracing ourselves for a physical challenge on Saturday,” DHL WP Under-21 coach John Dobson told http://www.wprugby.com.\n\n“The Leopards Under-21s have a big and strong pack and play typical Blue Bulls rugby. In fact, they stood up to the Bulls U21s in every facet last weekend.\n\n“Don’t let the scoreline (of 37-10 to the Bulls) fool you. They stopped the Bulls’ maul and they got stuck in up front… the Bulls scored three tries in the last five minutes to make the scoreline look a lot better in the end.”\n\nThe DHL WP U21s have had to contend with quite a few injuries this week, most notably at lock where both Jan Uys and Sebastian Ferreira are sidelined – just a few weeks after star second row JD Schickerling suffered a very serious neck injury (against the Bulls).\n\nUys is expected back in the next fortnight, but Ferreira will miss the remainder of the 2014 Absa Provincial Under-21 season with an ankle injury – along with inside backs Chris Smith (broken ankle), Janco Gunter (broken hand) and wing Lihleli Xoli (ankle).\n\n“We’ve now lost four backs for the rest of the season in the space of just three weeks,” said Dobson.\n\n“Lihleli Xoli’s injury was especially gutting for us, it happened at training and now he’s out for the rest of the season, but, I guess, it’s part and parcel of rugby and proves just how much depth you require to have a successful season.\n\n“That said, despite losing a few players to injury I still think we’re able to put out quite a strong starting XV. Some of our frontline players, Eital Bredenkamp, Jean Nel and Robert du Preez – all of whom missed the Border game, are back this week and I fancy this team to do the job for us.\n\n“At the same time, it’s also an exciting opportunity for two club players, locks Jade Kriel and Kobus van Dyk, to come in and show what they can do in the absence of Jan and Sebastian and with potential play-off selections up for grabs. Both Jade and Kobus have trained well this week and they deserve this opportunity (on Saturday).”\n\nAside from their whopping 91-7 win over Border last weekend (their seventh bonus point win of 2014), the DHL WP U21s received a further boost last weekend when their closest rivals, the Lions, went down at home to the Sharks.\n\nThe Province U21s now top the log by two points, with a game in hand over the Lions U21s, but there is extra incentive for Dobson’s charges to remain in first place as the season nears its business-end.\n\nSaid Dobson: “You don’t want to run into a rampant Bulls team in the semifinals, especially if they decide to call upon some players from their senior team, so there is plenty incentive to finish top of the log.\n\n“Like I said, the Leopards are a physical team, but if we can match them up front I have enough belief in our attack – and on a good surface at Olën Park – to hurt the Leopards out wide.”\n\nThe DHL WP Under-21 team for Saturday (v Leopards, away) is as follows:\n\n15. EW Viljoen\n\n14. Dalen Goliath\n\n13. Johnny Kotze\n\n12. Kyle Lombard\n\n11. JP Lewis\n\n10. Robert du Preez\n\n9. Jean Nel\n\n8. Carel du Preez\n\n7. Justin Benn\n\n6. Eital Bredenkamp (captain)\n\n5. Jade Kriel\n\n4. Jurie van Vuuren\n\n3. Deacon Chowles\n\n2. Michael Willemse\n\n1. Sti Sithole\n\nReplacements:\n\n16. Chad Solomon\n\n17. John Meyer\n\n18. Kobus van Dyk\n\n19. Tapiwa Tsomondo\n\n20. Luke van der Smit\n\n21. SP Ferreira\n\n22. WJ Strydom\n\nReferee: Stephan Geldenhuys\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nRyan Oosthuizen will be back at inside centre for the DHL Western Province Under-19 side when they take on the Leopards U19s in Potchefstroom on Saturday (kick-off 11h00).\n\nOosthuizen missed his team’s hard-fought 21-20 win over the EP Kings in Cape Town last weekend with a cold, but he returns for the Olën Park excursion with Brandon Thomson reverting to the bench.\n\nIn other changes from last Saturday, Adriaan Carelse returns at fullback and Michael de Waal, Floris Pelser and Regardt Louw come into the pack, with hooker Paul-Martin Wipplinger (ankle) the latest injury casualty.\n\n“Last week’s win over a good EP side wasn’t our best, not by a long shot, but it was important for us from a confidence point of view,” DHL Western Province Under-19 coach Nazeem Adams told http://www.wprugby.com.\n\n“Remember, before last weekend we had come off two heavy losses away from home (against the Bulls and the Lions), so we needed to get that ‘W’ behind our name again.”\n\nLooking ahead to this weekend, and the challenge of facing the Leopards in their own backyard, Adams added: “The Leopards are a tough team on their own turf – don’t let their log position fool you.\n\n“We need to start well and build an early lead and not give them a sniff. Last week against the Kings, we were on the attack just before half-time only to turn the ball over and concede a long-range try and (then) trail at half-time. We cannot afford to do that against the Leopards – we need to shut them out from the get-go and not allow them in (at all).”\n\nThe DHL WP Under-19s are in second place on the 2014 Absa Provincial Under-19 log with 32 points from nine matches (seven wins and two losses). The first-placed Bulls U19s (on 37 points), meanwhile, will travel to Bloemfontein to take on the third-placed Free Staters (31 points).\n\n“That top-two finish is crucial for us, as we would (obviously) like the comfort of a home semifinal,” said Adams.\n\n“Injuries and some tough away games have really tested us at a crucial stage of the season (these past few weeks), but we need to continue to show resilience and hang in there ahead of the play-offs as we should have some guys back (from injuries) and the possibility of a home semifinal (too).”\n\nThe DHL WP Under-19 team for Saturday (v Leopards, away) is as follows:\n\n15. Adriaan Carelse\n\n14. Grant Hermanus\n\n13. Jarryd Sage\n\n12. Ryan Oosthuizen\n\n11. Leolin Zas\n\n10. Ernst Stapelberg\n\n9. Justin Phillips\n\n8. Dian Koen\n\n7. Luke Stringer\n\n6. Michael de Waal\n\n5. Floris Pelser\n\n4. David Ribbans\n\n3. Frans van Wyk (captain)\n\n2. Regardt Louw\n\n1. Francois van der Merwe\n\nReplacements:\n\n16. Hanno Snyman\n\n17. Lebohang Mdakane\n\n18. Mihlali Mtongana\n\n19. Ruan du Preez\n\n20. Jacques Oosthuizen\n\n21. Damian Stevens\n\n22. Brandon Thomson\n\n23. Heinrich Buhr\n\nReferee: Ricus van der Hoven\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nThe Springbok starting line-up to face Australia shows three changes, with Teboho “Oupa” Mohoje and Francois Hougaard included for Saturday’s fifth round Test in the Castle Lager Rugby Championship at DHL Newlands in Cape Town.\n\nFrancois Louw’s injury means a positional switch for Marcell Coetzee in the starting team. There is a further four changes on the bench, with Cobus Reinach in line to make his Springbok debut alongside the experienced trio of Bakkies Botha, Schalk Burger and JP Pietersen.\n\nThe Springbok selectors opted for continuity, retaining the core of the squad that performed well but came up short in tough away fixtures against Australia and New Zealand earlier this month.\n\n“Injuries forced our hand with Francois and Ruan Pienaar not available, but Hougie and Oupa have been part of the squad for the entire season and I’ve got the utmost confidence in them making the step up,” said Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer.\n\n“Francois brings different strengths to the team at No 9 and has an opportunity to demonstrate the contribution he can make on Saturday, while Oupa is more of a traditional blindside flanker who will get another opportunity to show what he can do in his breakthrough season. He has really come on in leaps and bounds this season and responded to the goals set for him.”\n\nMohoje will get his first start for the Springboks after making his debut off the bench against Scotland in June. It will be another milestone in a remarkable season, in which he started playing Varsity and Vodacom Cup rugby before getting his break in Vodacom Super Rugby after the Toyota Cheetahs lost a number of loose forwards to injury.\n\nIt will be Hougaard’s first start for the Springboks since the final Test in 2012, against England at Twickenham.\n\nMeyer said tactical needs had led to the changes on the bench: “We felt we needed a couple of cool and experienced heads late in our matches and that is where Bakkies, Schalk, JP, Pat Lambie and Bismarck du Plessis will play a vital role – all of them have more than 30 caps.\n\n“I’m also very happy for Cobus, who will follow in the footsteps of his late father having never even played first team at school or any national representative rugby, which is a great compliment for the structures at the Sharks.”\n\nMeyer said the team was under no illusions about Saturday’s Test: “It will be a very tough outing and we will have to fire on all cylinders for the full 80 minutes,” he said. “It’s great to be back in South Africa after three tough matches on the road and we’re really looking forward to playing in front of our own supporters again.\n\n“We’ve had a couple of great training sessions and have been working hard on all aspects of our game this week. There is a definite resolve to improve the quality of our performance on Saturday.”\n\nIn line with an agreement with the provinces, Lwazi Mvovo and Warren Whiteley have been released to play in the Absa Currie Cup this weekend. They will re-join the Springbok squad in Johannesburg on Sunday.\n\nThe Springbok team to face Australia in Cape Town is:\n\n15 Willie le Roux 19 Tests, 35 points\n\n14 Cornal Hendricks 7 Tests 25 points\n\n13 Jan Serfontein 14 Tests 5 points\n\n12 Jean de Villiers (captain) 100 Tests 125 points\n\n11 Bryan Habana 101 Tests 280 points\n\n10 Handré Pollard 4 Tests 34 points\n\n9 Francois Hougaard 30 Tests 20 points\n\n8 Duane Vermeulen 23 Tests 10 points\n\n7 Teboho “Oupa” Mohoje 1 Test 0 points\n\n6 Marcell Coetzee 20 Tests 20 points\n\n5 Victor Matfield (vice-captain) 115 Tests 35 points\n\n4 Eben Etzebeth 27 Tests 0 points\n\n3 Jannie du Plessis 58 Tests 5 points\n\n2 Adriaan Strauss 38 Tests 25 points\n\n1 Tendai Mtawarira 59 Tests 10 points\n\nReplacements:\n\n16 Bismarck du Plessis 64 Tests 45 points\n\n17 Trevor Nyakane 7 Tests 5 points\n\n18 Marcel van der Merwe 3 Tests 0 points\n\n19 Bakkies Botha 81 Tests 35 points\n\n20 Schalk Burger 71 Tests 65 points\n\n21 Cobus Reinach – uncapped\n\n22 Pat Lambie 34 Tests 68 points\n\n23 JP Pietersen 54 Tests 85 points\n\nStats and facts:\n\n· The Springbok starting team boasts a total of 615 Test caps (274 in the backline and 341 in the forwards), while there are a further 314 caps worth of experience on the bench.\n\n· South Africa and Australia have played each other 79 times since 1933, with the Springboks winning 44 Tests, losing 34 and one was drawn. The Springboks have scored 1,524 points and 180 tries and conceded 1,381 points and 141 tries for an average score of 19-17.\n\n· Jean de Villiers will extend his record as the most-capped Springbok centre, with 85 Tests in this position. He will also extend his South African Record of 48 Castle Lager Rugby Championship matches and will captain South Africa for the 29th time, which places him equal third with Francois Pienaar. John Smit (83) and Gary Teichmann (36) are the only players to have captained South Africa on more occasions.\n\n· Victor Matfield will extend his record as the most-capped Springbok in history (115 Tests). He will also extend his record of 115 Tests as a lock and will be playing against Australia for the 26th time to extend his record.\n\n· Bryan Habana will extend his record as the most-capped Springbok wing, with 100 Tests in this position. If he scores a try, he will extend his record of 56 Test tries for South Africa as well as his Castle Lager Rugby Championship record of 18 tries.\n\n· If he goes on Cobus Reinach will become Springbok No. 864. He and his late father Jaco will become the 12th pair of father and sons to play for South Africa, the previous pair being Flip and Flippie van der Merwe. Jaco, who played four Tests for South Africa in 1986 against the New Zealand Cavaliers, was a double Springbok – in rugby and athletics.\n\n· If he appears and scores a try, Bismarck du Plessis will extend his record of nine Test tries for South Africa as a hooker.\n\n· The referee is Nigel Owens of Wales. This will be his 11th Test involving South Africa. The Springboks have won six and lost four of the previous Tests in which he has officiated. The last time he was in charge of the Boks was in the Test against New Zealand on 5 October, 2013 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, which the visitors won, 38-27.\n\nSpringbok Test match records at DHL Newlands, Cape Town:\n\no Most points – 35 (1t, 12c, 2p) by Percy Montgomery on 15 August, 2007 against Namibia.\n\no Most tries – three by Tom van Vollenhoven against the British Lions on 20 August 1955; by André Snyman against Tonga on 10 June 1997; by Schalk Burger against Namibia on 15 August, 2007 and by Juan Smith, also against Namibia on 15 August, 2007.\n\no Most conversions – 12 by Percy Montgomery against Namibia 15 August, 2007.\n\no Most penalty goals –seven by Percy Montgomery against France on 24 June, 2006.\n\no Most drop goals – two by Naas Botha against the NZ Cavaliers on 10 May, 1986 and by Frans Steyn against Australia on 16 June, 2006.\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nRegular captain and flank Deon Stegmann is back in the Vodacom Blue Bulls team to face Toyota Free State Cheetahs in an Absa Currie Cup match in Bloemfontein on Friday.\n\nStegmann missed last weekend’s defeat to the Cell C Sharks due to suspension, but will again wear the number six jersey and captain’s armband in place of Wiaan Liebenberg and Jono Ross respectively. Liebenberg moves to the bench in one of six changes to the starting team.\n\nAt the back, Ulrich Beyers replaces Jesse Kriel who moves to the bench, stalwart Akona Ndungane is back at right wing, with Sampie Mastriet moving to left wing in place of Bjorn Basson. In the midfield, JJ Engelbrecht replaces injured William Small-Smith and Piet van Zyl rotates with Rudy Paige, with the latter starting off the bench.\n\nIn the other change in the pack, Bongi Mbonambi will start, with Callie Visagie on the bench.\n\nAccording to Vodacom Blue Bulls coach Frans Ludeke this match is the most crucial one of the Absa Currie Cup campaign.\n\n“We cannot afford to lose and even a good win might not be good enough. We managed to get back on track earlier in the season, but again allowed ourselves to be side-tracked. We cannot afford for it to happen again,” Ludeke said.\n\nStegmann concurred. “We owe it to ourselves, the coaches and the supporters out there to deliver a quality performance. We have let ourselves down too many times this season. We must now run our own race and finish strong. We still have something to play for and we must use the opportunity.”\n\nThe Vodacom Blue Bulls team to play Free State in Bloemfontein is:\n\n15 Ulrich Beyers\n\n14 Akona Ndungane\n\n13 JJ Engelbrecht\n\n12 Burger Odendaal\n\n11 Sampie Mastriet\n\n10 Jacques Louis Potgieter\n\n9 Piet van Zyl\n\n8 Jono Ross\n\n7 Jacques du Plessis\n\n6 Deon Stegmann (c)\n\n5 Grant Hattingh\n\n4 Paul Willemse\n\n3 Werner Kruger\n\n2 Bongi Mbonambi\n\n1 Dean Greyling\n\nReplacements:\n\n16 Callie Visagie\n\n17 Morné Mellet\n\n18 Nicolaas Janse van Rensburg\n\n19 Wiaan Liebenberg\n\n20 Rudy Paige\n\n21 Tian Schoeman\n\n22 Jesse Kriel\n\n“Rugby & more”"
