        "text": "Beyond his illustrious career as the head football coach at Alabama, Nick Saban is widely recognized for his avid interest in golf, highlighting a lesser-known side of Saban that transcends the gridiron.\n\nWhether he's seizing moments for a few swings at the golf team's practice facility or showcasing his prowess at The Regions Traditions Celebrity Tournament, Saban's avidity for golf adds a dynamic and leisurely facet to his hard-nosed persona while underscoring the versatility of his interests.\n\nAs Saban seamlessly transitions from the football field to the golf course, his penchant for identifying talent has yet to waver. The most recent prospect to catch his eye in Tuscaloosa? Sophomore golfer Nick Dunlap.\n\nOn Sunday, the 20-year-old Dunlap won The American Express at the PGA West golf course in California, securing a victory with a final score of -29, one stroke better than second-place Christiaan Bezuidenhout, a South African pro, and two strokes ahead of former world No. 4 Xander Schauffele.\n\nIt was the first time in 33 years that an amateur golfer had won on the PGA Tour — with Phil Mickelson in 1991 being the most recent victor.\n\nDuring the final round, Saban called into Golf Channel’s broadcast of the event as Dunlap played the back nine, reminiscing on watching the Huntsville, Ala. native's practice sessions while lauding his fearless play style and work ethic.\n\n“I sat and watched on one of those machines. He was hitting drivers; he must have hit 100 of them, just checking the spin on the ball,” Saban said. “He’s really a dedicated guy. He’s a hard worker, and he’s got the right disposition to play. He doesn’t seem to get flustered about anything.\"\n\nAs Dunlap continued his historic march, Saban couldn't help but admire the U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Amateur champion's tenacity and skill on the course.\n\n\"Golf’s like a metaphor in life; you’ve got to be able to play the next shot,\" Saban said. \"Whether you’re in the hazard, whether you hit a good one, You’ve got to have the right disposition to play it, and I certainly think he has it.”\n\nWhen asked about potential advice he'd give to Dunlap on the biggest stage, Saban emphasized the importance of staying in the moment.\n\n“Focus on the next shot, regardless of what happened on the last shot,” Saban said. “Stay focused on not the outcome but what you have to do to get the outcome, which is a process to me, and I think that’s the best way to focus. We live in such an outcome-oriented world that sometimes that’s hard to do, but I think that’s the key to being successful.”\n\nWhile Saban watched from the comfort of his home, former Alabama golfer Justin Thomas was competing on the course alongside Dunlap, his protege.\n\nAs Thomas carded an 11-under 61 on Saturday, the former 2013 National Champion under Jay Seawell was squarely in contention heading into Sunday, but instead found himself standing in awe of Dunlap's record-breaking weekend.\n\n\"I wanted to try to get to 30 under this weekend,” Thomas said after his scorching third round. “Didn’t think I was going have to deal with a freaking college kid shooting 60 today.”\n\nAs fate would have it, Thomas and Dunlap would be matched with world No. 22 Sam Burns for the tournament's final-round featured pairing.\n\nOn the 18th hole, Dunlap, who finished -2 on the day, needed a par to hold off Bezuidenhout, who stood at -28 after posting a -7 final round. When walking along the fairway to final his tee shot, it was Thomas who broke the ice of an intense moment.\n\nMoments later, Dunlap reigned victorious, drilling an eight-foot put above the hole, showing not an ounce of trepidation on his face.\n\nAfter the tournament, Dunlap was quick to acknowledge the camaraderie and shared experience he felt among seasoned players, highlighting the supportive environment that contributed to his success during the week.\n\n\"Playing with Justin and Sam and Wilson [Furr], the support they gave me throughout the week helped me a lot and, like I said, it really made me feel like one of them,\" Dunlap said. \"They didn't treat me different at all just because I was an amateur. To play some practice rounds with some of them and learn from them kind of how they navigate around here was also helpful.\"\n\nAs for Thomas in particular, his advice to Dunlap was similar to that of Saban's, once again noting the value of being present — but in a different context.\n\n\"Justin had a lot of cool things to say,\" Dunlap said. \"Even coming down the stretch, the last chip, the last putt, after I made it, it's like, 'Hey, man, you're a PGA TOUR winner forever, and just let that soak in, let everything around you, the people, the moment, just take a second and let it all in.\"\n\nWith the victory, Dunlap can now accept PGA Tour membership at any time during the season and will receive regular PGA Tour winner status. If he accepts membership, he will remain one through the 2026 season. Dunlap can also refute his membership for 2025 up until 30 days after the conclusion of this season."
