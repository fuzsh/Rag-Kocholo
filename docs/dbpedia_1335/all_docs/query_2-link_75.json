The Leopards host the Pumas in Potchefstroom, and the Griquas face the defending champion Sharks in Kimberley.\n\nCurrie Cup betting odds…\n\nFixtures:\n\nFriday, 4 August\n\nLeopards v Pumas\n\nGriquas v Sharks\n\nSaturday, 5 August\n\nFree State Cheetahs v Western Province\n\nBlue Bulls v Lions\n\nStandings:\n\n1. Golden Lions 14\n\n2. Sharks 14\n\n3. Western Province 12\n\n4. Cheetahs 7\n\n5. Griquas 7\n\n6. Pumas 4\n\n7. Blue Bulls 4\n\n8. Leopards 1\n\nPreviews:\n\nLeopards v Pumas\n\nOlen Park, Potchefstroom\n\nBoth these sides were on the wrong side of high scoring matches at the weekend. The Leopards gathered their first point of the season after scoring four tries in their 53-36 defeat to the Lions and the Pumas went down 40-33 to Griquas.\n\nAlthough both sides are yet to register a victory in 2011, the Pumas have impressed more than the Leopards thus far this season.\n\nDespite being winless, the Witbank-based side have picked up bonus points in all their previous matches this season.\n\nThe Pumas have a huge set of forwards, who have managed to hold their own against more renowned packs in the competiiton. If they can provide a solid platform for their back-line to play off, they should have this match in the bag.\n\nThe Pumas are a well-drilled unit, and their coach Jimmy Stonehouse would surely have reminded his charges not to underestimate their opponents.\n\nThe Leopards gave a good showing in their defeat to the Lions and had the favourites worried when they managed to claw their way back from a 29-10 deficit to draw level at 36-all.\n\nPrediction:Both these teams will go all out on attack in their quest fot that elusive victory. However, the Pumas have proven in previous matches this season that they hold no fear for any side. Pumas by eight!\n\nThe teams:\n\nPumas:15 MJ Mentz, 14 Deon Scholtz, 13 JW Jonker, 12 Tiaan Marx, 11 ShandrÃ© Frolick, 10 Coenie van Wyk, 9 Shaun Venter, 8 Christo le Roux, 7 Jaco Bouwer, 6 CornÃ© Steenkamp (c), 5 Marius Coetzer, 4 Rudi Mathee, 3 Ashley Buys, 2 Marthinus van der Westhuizen, 1 Dawie Steyn.\n\nReplacements:16 Torsten van Jaarsveld, 17 De-Jay Terblanche, 18 Eduan van der Walt, 19 Reginald Kember, 20 Hendrik van der Nest, 21 Dewald Pretorius, 22 Carl Bezuidenhout.\n\nLeopards:15 George Tossel, 14 Danie Dames, 13 Charl Weideman, 12 Joubert Engelbrecht, 11 Wynand Willis, 10 Wesley Dunlop, 9 Whestley Moolman, 8 MornÃ© Hanekom, 7 Luvuyiso Lusaseni, 6 Philip de Wet, 5 Brendon Snyman, 4 Roelof van Heerden, 3 Stephan Bezuidenhout, 2 Gavin Williamson, 1 Bennie Uys.\n\nReplacements:16 BÃªrend Botha, 17 Marius Fourie, 18 Christo van Niekerk, 19 Juan Pretorius, 20 Theo van Wyk, 21 Walter Venter, 22 Clayton Durandt.\n\nKick-off:19:00 (17:00 GMT)\n\nReferee:Lourens van der Merwe\n\nGriquas v Sharks\n\nGWK Stadium, Kimberley\n\nThe Sharks' gave a clinical performance in their 43-34 win against the Cheetahs on Saturday, and will be chasing maximum league points.\n\nThe Durbanites looked unstoppable during the first half of that match, and should maintain their 100 per cent winning record if they can give a similar performance against Griquas.\n\nCoach John Plumtree has shown faith in the side that beat the Cheetahs 43-34 at the weekend, despite being able to recall several returning Springboks.\n\nAmongst their forwards, loosehead prop Dale Chadwick has caught the eye with some fine performances. Apart from holding his own in the scrums, Chadwick's general play has also stood out and he will be looking to continue where left off against the Cheetahs.\n\nRoss Cronje (scrum-half) is another player who impressed against the Bloemfontein-based side. Cronje provides slick service to Frederic Michalak and is a playmaker in the Fourie du Preez mould. He had a hand in several of the Sharks' tries at the weekend, and his defensive work around the fringes of the rucks stood out in that match.\n\nGriquas are an unpredictable side and are especially dangerous on their home turf, so the Sharks will underestimate them at their peril.\n\nThe much-maligned Earl Rose (fly-half) is the man who they expect to unlock the Sharks' defence while Riaan Viljoen, who has been moved from full-back to wing, will also prove a handful to the opposition.\n\nPrediction:Despite not turning to their Springboks, the Sharks still have experienced players in key positions and shouldn't lose this match…. shouldn't being the key word. Sharks by 12!\n\nThe teams:\n\nGriquas:15 Rudi Vogt, 14 Riaan Viljoen, 13 Jean Stemmet, 12 Barry Geel, 11 Dusty Noble, 10 Earl Rose, 9 Marnus Hugo, 8 Burger Schoeman, 7 Davon Raubenheimer, 6 Jonathan Mokuena (captain), 5 Martin Muller, 4 Hendrik Roodt, 3 Lourens Adriaanse, 2 Ryno Barnes, 1 Jean Botha.\n\nReplacements:16 Matthew Dobson, 17 Ivann Espag, 18 Frikkie Spies, 19 Marnus Schoeman, 20 Matthew Rosslee, 21 Monty Dumond, 22 Wilmaure Louw.\n\nSharks:15 Louis Ludik, 14 Mark Richards, 13 Stefan Terblanche, 12 Meyer Bosman, 11 Sibusiso Sithole, 10 Frederic Michalak, 9 Ross Cronje, 8 Keegan Daniel (c), 7 Marcell Coetzee, 6 Jacques Botes, 5 Jan Andre Marais, 4 Anton Bresler, 3 Wiehahn Herbst, 2 Craig Burden, 1 Dale Chadwick.\n\nReplacements:16 Kyle Cooper, 17 Eugene van Staden, 18 Peet Marais, 19 Ryan Kankowski, 20 Charl McLeod, 21 Patrick Lambie, 22 Marius Joubert."
