        "text": "Value is subjective in dynasty fantasy football, as different fantasy players put different values on the guys on their team. Using KeepTradeCut’s dynasty rankings, which are crowdsourced from the dynasty community, these five players stand out as undervalued.\n\nNot to say that you need to go grab these five players for your team right now, but this may be as low as their value will get this season, and now could be a good time to add some extra points if you have a contending team.\n\nConsider trading for these five players at their current value.\n\nBe sure to check all of our fantasy football rankings for 2024 fantasy football drafts:\n\nQuarterback fantasy football rankings\n\nRunning back fantasy football rankings\n\nWide receiver fantasy football rankings\n\nTight end fantasy football rankings\n\nDefense (D/ST) fantasy football rankings\n\nFantasy football rookie rankings\n\nBest ball fantasy football rankings\n\nSuperflex fantasy football rankings\n\nDynasty fantasy football rankings\n\nIDP fantasy football rankings\n\nGardner Minshew II, QB, Las Vegas Raiders\n\nIn a format where you can start multiple quarterbacks, the most important position in football becomes the most important position in fantasy football. In Superflex leagues, it is necessary to have at least three starting quarterbacks on your roster.\n\nGardner Minshew is currently valued as the QB34 in dynasty and that number may fall even more as news breaks about Aidan O’Connell having a leg up on the starting job in Vegas. While O’Connell was just a rookie last season, he was not very efficient and struggled to adapt to the NFL game. Minshew, on the other hand, has more NFL experience and has delivered formidable play when given an opportunity.\n\nThis quarterback battle will go on throughout camp and while O’Connell may have a leg up from being in the system for an extra year, Minshew will likely get a shot this season whether it comes in Week 1 or later. Jumping on him now with the recent news around O’Connell is a smart move, as Minshew has finished as a QB2 in fantasy in the two seasons where he started 14 or more games.\n\nChuba Hubbard, RB, Carolina Panthers\n\nChuba Hubbard is valued as the RB57 in dynasty despite his RB26 finish in 2023. Hubbard, still just 25 years old, finished as a top-25 running back in six of the last seven weeks of 2023 after usurping the starting job from Miles Sanders.\n\nThe addition of Jonathon Brooks to the Panthers backfield caused the obvious drop in stock for Hubbard, although it seems that the pendulum has swung too far given that Brooks tore his ACL in November and likely will be used lightly once he returns from his injury. Hubbard should be startable for most of the season and with an RB57 price tag, he is worth targeting if your team needs running back help.\n\nRomeo Doubs, WR, Green Bay Packers\n\nGreen Bay’s Romeo Doubs is entering his third NFL season, which is the typical breakout threshold for wide receivers. Following a rookie season where he flashed, Doubs finished as the WR36 in PPR last season with 674 yards and eight touchdowns. His most impressive showing came in the playoffs against Dallas where he caught six passes for 151 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDespite his uptick during the playoffs, a clear position as the top red-zone target in the offense, and consistent positive offseason reports from head coach Matt LaFleur, Doubs is still valued as the WR52 in dynasty. Green Bay has a crowded receiver room full of young players, but Doubs is my pick to lead the way after showing his chemistry with Jordan Love. To be able to grab a 24-year-old receiver who could potentially lead an explosive offense in targets with a WR52 price tag feels like a no-brainer.\n\nGabe Davis, WR, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nOne of fantasy football’s largest debates for the past few seasons has been how to value former Buffalo-now-Jacksonville wide receiver Gabe Davis. Entering his first season in Jacksonville, Davis is valued as the WR74 in dynasty. Quite the fall-off from where he stood in the dynasty rankings following his 201-yard, four-touchdown performance in the playoffs in 2021, but the pendulum has swung too far on Davis.\n\nIn his two seasons since becoming a full-time player, Davis has finished as the WR27 and the WR40 -- much higher than his WR74 ranking. Now on a three-year, $39 million deal in Jacksonville, Davis will be a full-time player alongside Christian Kirk and rookie Brian Thomas Jr. It is unclear who the top target earner will be in this offense, and while Davis is the most unlikely candidate of the three along with tight end Evan Engram, never say never. At the very worst, he will offer a similar boom-bust upside that he provided in Buffalo and is worth adding as a cheap depth receiver option.\n\nJake Ferguson, TE, Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe Cowboys’ third-year tight end is valued as the TE10, ahead of Evan Engram and David Njoku. However, I still feel as if this is a smidge too low. In his 2023 breakout campaign, Ferguson finished as the TE8 with 761 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nFerguson led all tight ends in red-zone targets with 24 last season. If more of those opportunities break his way, it’s wheels up for Ferguson. The Dallas run game also took a hit with the departures of Tony Pollard, Tyron Smith, and Tyler Biadasz, meaning it may lean more on the pass in 2024. Dallas did not add any more weapons to the offense, cementing Ferguson as the clear-cut second option behind CeeDee Lamb, who is currently holding out.\n\nTiering down from a guy like Sam LaPorta or Trey McBride for a high pick and Ferguson is a move that I would happily make. Ferguson has no business being ranked behind an injured T.J. Hockenson or an aging Travis Kelce or George Kittle. Go get him before his true breakout campaign.\n\nDownload Our Free News & Alerts Mobile App\n\nLike what you see?
