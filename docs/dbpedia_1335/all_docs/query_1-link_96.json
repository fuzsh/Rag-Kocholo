        "text": "Kings Park, Durban (19-08-2011, 18:10 GMT)\n\nThe Leopards face an uphill battle at Kings Park in Durban on Friday evening against The Sharks, the defending champions currently in second place on the Currie Cup log.\n\nIn fact, the Sharks can go top of the log with the first round of the competition nearly finished if they score a bonus point victory against the Leopards and the Golden Lions return with empty hands from Cape Town.\n\nSharks coach John Plumtree has decided to rotate his squad this weekend, making a number of changes to the team to give fringe players much-needed game time.\n\nStefan Terblanche is getting a break, with Springboks Meyer Bosman and Marius Joubert teaming up in the midfield. Keegan Daniel will play off the bench and Jacques Botes will lead the team, while Conrad Hoffman replaces Charl McLeod at scrumhalf.\n\nPlumtree doesn't underestimate the Platinum Leopards in any way though, even if The Sharks beat them twice by big scores in last year's Currie Cup.\n\n\"The Leopards have conceded a few points this year, but they've also scored a few, so they have plenty of attacking threats and will come here with an attitude of wanting to attack and put on a good show. Defensively, we're going to have to be really up for it, \" said Plumtree.\n\n\"Our defence was good against Western Province, but it was easier in the rain. Hopefully there won't be any on Friday. They will look to stress us and we have to make sure defensively we're on target - defence is a big focus for us this weekend. \"\n\nThe Sharks vs Platinum Leopards\n\nDate: Friday, 19 August\n\nKick-off: 19:10\n\nVenue: Kings Park, Durban\n\nReferee: Lourens van der Merwe\n\nLast year in Currie Cup:\n\n- 13 August: The Sharks won 51-6 in Phokeng\n\n- 1 October: The Sharks won 63-6 in Durban\n\nAvoided the Sharks until now so I could have time to recover from last night.\n\nThe game will be summed up in one sentence. Charl McLeod looked like a wee demi-god, as he stood out as a beacon of unshitiness that was the proverbial toilet of Kings Park.\n\nThe Sharks won, something like 27-3, important bit being we did not get the 4 try bouns point.\n\nKeegan Daniel, when he came on off the bench, was absolutely pathetic. Yet again another stupid tip tackle, this time on a player without the ball. His yellow card in the last few minutes meant no matter how hard we pushed, we weren't going to get the BP. We lead only 6-0 at half-time.\n\nAs for the ref. Add 'Lourens van de Merwe' to you scrapbook as one of the worst refs to 'grace' the game. One point sums he up. So fustrated were we (Sharks and Leopards supporters) with his dealings in the scrum, I took the liberty to time all of the scrum engagements and resets in the second half, and guess what it came to? 18 MINUTES.\n\nLast and final point, and the part of the game that annoyed us all the most. The Leopards came here to disrupt the game, they had no intent what-so-ever of winning the game. Thoroughly disappointing stuff, and frankly I hope they get humped by every team, including the Bulls, simply because of the way they played last night. If it wasn't for the little portable decoder I had with me in the stands for the Lions vs. WP game, I probably would have left and have been a tee-totaler no more.\n\nI will neg rep anyone who says after this game that says PdV is a tool for not calling up Keegan Daniel, so f***ing stupid. Should have got a red and cited."
