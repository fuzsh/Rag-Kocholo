        "text": "Tag Rugby players are entering the final straight but need assistance. We are already in July and have just 16 days until the South African Tag Rugby teams depart for the Tag World Cup in Ireland. The players assisted by a sponsor, donations and a huge helping of blood, sweat and tears have collectively raised nearly R2,2 million. We, however, may have to leave 7 players behind who will not be able to make the final payments for their flights and accommodation. We are looking for R120 000 to assist 7 players. As an NPO we don't have the deep pockets to assist the players so as a last resort I am turning to my network to see if you can / know of companies / individuals that will be willing to assist a player/s. These are not players that well resourced with connections and networks like ours. What they do have is the ability perform on the International Sports Stage. I have done my utmost to get them the recognition that they so richly deserve. Tag has worked hard to get these players, managers and coaches the recognition they so richly deserve. They will all receive their South African National Colours, a massive honour. I have mentioned the players sporting ability but I haven't mentioned the tenacity they have shown to just get to the trials, get selected and then attend the practices and then to fundraise to get to the World Cup. Each player has a unique story but I will highlight below just a few of them below:- Player 1 - is a 19 year old who is the sole breadwinner in their family and has not missed a practice since being selected in February. Player 2 - has overcome fungal meningitis twice as a young child and survived to play Tag Internationally despite the physical challenges they face. Player 3 - has grown up in a home where GBV is a way of life and overcome the abuse to get selected to play for South Africa. Player 4 - has been raised by their single grandmother in an under resourced community. Player 5 - is looking after their sister’s (drug addict under medical care) two teenage boys whilst still fundraising for fellow teammates. Coach 1 - has never been overseas and is currently a student working three jobs to pay for their dad’s motor neuron medication and fund their trip. Below is the badge that the players will be proudly playing for when they represent you and I (fellow South Africans) at the Tag World Cup in Limerick Ireland in 16 days. The Mixed Open team, that most of the players above represent and need assistance for, will be playing the opening game of the Tag World Cup vs Great Britain on the 1st August 2023 at 21h00. If you know of an individual company that may want to come on board as a sponsor or donate please contact me stuart@taggroup.co.za or WhatsApp +27824401921."
