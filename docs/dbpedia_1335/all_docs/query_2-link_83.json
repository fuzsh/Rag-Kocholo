        "text": "The controversy over a statue of Cecil Rhodes at the University of Cape Town took a serious turn in March when a student at the university slathered it with excrement. Post-clean-up, UCT is agonising about whether the statue should go now or go later. The ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ campaign is making headway and it could soon be safely out of the way. A week from now the UCT senate will recommend to the university’s council that it ‘be moved’.\n\nThe seated figure in bronze was made by the British medallist and figurative sculptor Marion Walgate: her husband worked with the architect J.M. Solomon on the new university buildings, and took over after Solomon’s suicide in 1920. Walgate’s statue was unveiled in 1934, when decolonisation was a simmering ambition throughout the continent and apartheid must have seemed an unlikely prospect to people in the Cape. It’s sited on the Upper Campus in front of Jameson Hall, looking out across Madiba Circle (‘Rugby Road’ and ‘Ring Road’ until last year). With the playing fields below, Rhodes seems to be contemplating the bright future of Springbok rugby."
