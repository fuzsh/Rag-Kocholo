        "text": "Louis Oosthuizen completed a two-shot victory at the Alfred Dunhill Championship for his 10th DP World Tour title and first in five years.\n\nPlay at Leopard Creek Country Club in Mpumalanga, South Africa, had been suspended on Sunday because of heavy rain and the threat of lightning.\n\nWhen the final round resumed on Monday, Oosthuizen opened up a lead over fellow South African Charl Schwartzel.\n\nDespite a nervy finish, he held on to win by two shots on 18 under.\n\nOosthuizen, the 2010 Open champion, bogeyed the 17th and then found water from the tee on the par-five 18th hole.\n\nBut the 41-year-old managed to hole a putt from more than 20 feet for par and card a three-under 69, while Schwartzel finished with back-to-back pars to sign for a 71.\n\n\"This is a tournament that I really wanted,\" said Oosthuizen, who plays on the LIV Golf tour.\n\n\"It took me a while. It's always a great place coming back to. I wouldn't say 18 was kind to me this time, but I managed it a little bit, maybe not on the last hole there but I got it through.\"\n\nSouth African Christiaan Bezuidenhout finished third on 14 under and England's Marco Penge came in tied fourth with Germany's Matti Schmid and Dutchman Darius van Driel."
