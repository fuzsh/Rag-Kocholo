        "text": "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. — Padraig Harrington has won three major championships in his career, but Monday’s survival of a two-hole playoff to capture the Honda Classic at PGA National might feel just as important to his career as those triumphs did.\n\nThe 43-year-old Harrington, who on Sunday and Monday had played himself to fringes of contention amid struggles with his game, rallied on a wild final day and overtook 21-year-old Daniel Berger on the second playoff hole — the 17th, where an hour earlier he thought he’d lost the tournament.\n\nIn a brilliant redemption story that mirrors his career arc, the affable Irishman came full-circle on No. 17, the course’s venerable “Bear Trap.’’\n\nHe closed out Berger on 17, the second playoff hole, stuffing a 5-iron to three feet for the winning birdie. An hour earlier, Harrington had stood on the same tee with the same club in his hand with a one-shot lead and hit a weak shot into the water to lose the lead.\n\nThat left Harrington one shot behind Berger, who had finished at 6-under par almost 90 minutes earlier.\n\nHarrington needed a birdie on the 18th to get into a playoff with Berger, a local product from Palm Beach County who was playing in just his 12th PGA Tour event.\n\nHarrington got up-and-down from 107 yards, hitting sand wedge to 15 feet and burying the putt to force the playoff.\n\nThe win was his first PGA Tour victory since the 2008 PGA Championship. It took place 10 years after his first PGA Tour victory, which came at this event when it was played across the street at Mirasol.\n\n“I was not allowing my emotions to get away [from] me,’’ Harrington said. “I never once considered how important this win is to me. I’m playing [tournaments] on invites. I got an invite this week. [This win] changes everything for three years. I’m back at the Masters. There’s lots of things that this does, World Ranking points … but I never considered that all day.’’\n\nOf the playoff and his fateful redemption shot on 17, Harrington said: “In the first playoff hole, I felt I played it a little bit like I was happy to be there. The second playoff hole, I definitely had changed my mindset. I said, ‘I’m first up on the tee, I’ve got to take control of this. I’ve got to hit the shot.’\n\n“I just couldn’t afford to bail out and leave the door open. I knew I had to hit the shot. It was classic match play. You’ve got to hit the shot and put the pressure on him.’’\n\nBerger described the Harrington shot as “a dagger in the heart.’’\n\nBerger left disappointed at not winning, but buoyed by how close he came to his first win.\n\n“If you told me I was going to finish solo second when the week started, I’d probably take it,’’ he said. “Right now, I’m not as happy as I wish I was, but it’s just a good learning experience. I think this week shows with the depth of the field and how many great players there are, that I can compete with the best in the world.\n\n“I know this won’t be the last chance that I have to win. It’s just a great learning experience. I know next time I’ll be way better off than I was this time. This was definitely the biggest moment of my life.’’\n\nIt was one of the worst moments of Ian Poulter’s golfing life. He took a three-shot lead into the final round and had a two-shot lead with eight holes to play. He hit five balls into the water during his final 18 holes, including three in the 11 holes he played during Monday’s completion of the round.\n\n“It’s just bitterly disappointing,’’ Poulter said after shooting 74 and finishing one shot out of the playoff. “I’ve handed one away this week. It’s a sick feeling.’’\n\nIt was a wild final round with 11 lead changes, including ties. When it was over, Harrington the veteran plodder hoisted the trophy and resurrected his career.\n\nAfter having spent time with noted sports psychologist, Dr. Bob Rotella, Harrington spoke earlier in the week about his win at the Asian Tour’s Indonesian Open, referring to it as an important piece in recovering his confidence, despite the lower level of competition compared to the PGA Tour.\n\n“Winning is a good habit to have,” Harrington said after that December win in Indonesia. “It gives you a lot of confidence. This win brings a lot of confidence to my game and hopefully it will show up next year.’’\n\nWhen it counted most against the best players in the world this week, it showed up for Harrington."
