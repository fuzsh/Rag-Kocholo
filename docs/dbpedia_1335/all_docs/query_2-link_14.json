        "text": "I had the privilege of interviewing the legend that is Ertjies Bezuidenhout for Bicycling magazine last year. What a gentleman. Sadly, the cycling icon is struggling in ICU in a Pretoria hospital, after suffering a massive stroke on Sunday. While you read through the rollicking profile piece below please hold him and his family in your thoughts…\n\n[Update: I’m deeply saddened to report that Ertjies lost the fight. He passed away in hospital on Wednesday, 29 February 2012. RIP, mate.]\n\nIt was a golden era of cycling in South Africa. When the only protection a cyclist wore was a well-groomed moustache. Professionals trained on the roads by moonlight. And Ertjies Bezuidenhout, the most gifted climber the country has ever produced, ruled the mountains with an iron fist, and a well-placed elbow in your ribcage.\n\nLike every other god-fearing young Afrikaner boy in the late 1960s from Vanderbijlpark Ernst Bezuidenhout’s life had a comfortable routine. His mornings were spent cooped up behind a school desk, paging through textbooks, and scratching equations on a chalkboard. But his mind was dreaming of one thing only – playing rugby. The Vaal Triangle was rugby country, and fathers felt a duty to produce sons who could kick, pass, tackle and sidestep from the moment they could walk. When the last school bell of the day rang at Hoërskool Transvalia boys of every age would spill onto the fields and start chasing oval balls across the dry veld.\n\nFor Ernst, or Ertjies, as he became known, it was slightly different. Rugby wasn’t merely a way to pass time. It was the only way he could prove himself. He’d always been smaller than the other kids, and he quickly learned that while there wasn’t much he could do about genetics, a finely tuned aggressive streak had bigger kids quaking in their boots. “I was the skinniest so I had to fight for anything and everything. At a certain point I thought, no, I’ll show you. And, believe me, once it’s in your blood it’s there,” he asserts.\n\nBy Standard 9, at age 15, Ertjies was playing first team scrumhalf. Then, during one fateful Thursday afternoon practice the coach unexpectedly demoted him to the fifth team. “I didn’t take that lightly,” Ertjies remembers sheepishly. “I had an argument with him and eventually I just threw him with the ball.”\n\nThe next morning Ertjies was called in front of the headmaster. His father was also present, and pleaded to have his upstart son remain in school, explaining that he was just a youngster and he would be good from now on. For Ertjies though, something had snapped: “I just thought f*ckit… f*ck this school sport. I tried to convince my old man to let me do cycling but he wouldn’t. He was an avid Northern Transvaal supporter, a Blue Bull. Rugby was part of us.”\n\nSo Ertjies continued the rugby pantomime for his dad, playing the Saturday morning matches against other schools for whatever team would have him. But his passion was gone. If he could no longer play in the best team what was the point? Ertjies started looking around for other places to unleash his competitive spirit.\n\nOn Saturday afternoons he started making excuses about visiting ‘mates’ and snuck off to the local cycling club’s road races. For a 15-year-old, the maximum race distance was 30km and races were held in a handicap format. “The very first race I rocked up with takkies and an old DHC bike. It was ancient thing, so no-one gave me a chance. It was a handicap and they gave me a three-minute head-start… I came in 2.15 clear of the bunch. All of a sudden I’d won a bike race!” he recalls. “They gave me a little trophy. But I thought, what the f*ck do I do with this thing? Here I am, proud I had won a race on my own, I didn’t have to depend on someone else to tackle someone, or whatever. But I didn’t have my old man’s support.”\n\nThe same thing happened for the next two weekends. So Ertjies ended up with three trophies, which he stashed in a corner under his bed. Not long after that he came home to find his parents sitting with his trophies. The Bezuidenhouts’ domestic worker had done a spring clean, discovered the trophies and asked Ertjies’ mother where they had come from? He readied himself for a tongue-lashing. To his amazement his old man calmly suggested that if he wanted to leave rugby to pursue his love of cycling, he must do so.\n\nSo began the meteoric rise of South African cycling’s fiery hill-climb specialist. It is hard to reconcile the image of the scrawny schoolboy that would go on to strike such fear into the hearts of those he rode against, with the man sitting across the table from me now. After stalking Ertjies for a few days I had managed to track him down and we were now face-to-face in a noisy Cape Town bar late on a Wednesday afternoon. The Ertjies Bezuidenhout of today is vigorous and engaging. He has filled out somewhat since the days he graced the newspaper pages with his cycling triumphs. But his moustache is intact, and his eyes are still wild.\n\nCycling teammate and long-time friend Johnny Koen also recalls a different Ertjies from the petulant kid. “He was rated as a climber and a great team guy. He was one of the guys who would help a lesser guy win a race if it came to that, which is very good. He was also one of the most colourful guys, who had his own way of doing things. He was the only oke I ever saw in the world of sport who wore bright red trousers with a Springbok blazer. He’s probably still got them! A very interesting character. And of course he had that little high voice and ‘hy’t net so gepraat de heeltyd’,” he squeals in Afrikaans.\n\nAs it turns out the genes that proved to be such a handicap for a career as a rugby player were perfectly suited for the bike. “I’m from the Vaal Triangle,” Ertjies explains proudly. “We didn’t have the Alps to play with. But being a climber is something that you can’t actually train for. Sure, you can get better if you train for it, if you ride long mountain passes, but you must have it in you, the muscle structure. Interestingly, where I grew up it’s fairly flat. We had a couple of hills, so I moulded a piece of lead and tapped a hole under my bottom bracket and screwed just over two and a half kilos of lead to give me extra weight.” Ertjies wasn’t just riding with a piece of moulded lead attached to his bike, he also had a full car toolkit under his saddle “shifting spanner, pliers, that sort of thing” for extra weight. On race day, he would shed 4.5 to 5kg, just by leaving the lead weight and tools at home.\n\nSo common was the sight of Ertjies pedaling the ‘hills’ around his hometown that locals named the steepest of them all Ertjiesberg – a formidable wall outside Parys. “That’s where I would do all my power training. It was 41km from home, so we would ride out there and then I would just go up and down, up and down. There isn’t a signpost but everyone knows it as Ertjiesberg. It’s actually a bitch, hey. It’s a real bastard.” Ertjies confesses. “I would ride it in a 53×12, and I would force myself to sit, and not get out of the saddle. And when I was getting ready for the Rapport Tour or South African Champs I would do sprints. The hill was 2.1km, and I’d do a 200m sprint and then 100m to recover, then another 200m, then 100m to recover, then 200m again… all the way up. So when we had the mountain sprints or the King of the Mountains [in a race] I could just wear the guys down – it was just another training ride for me. I wouldn’t wait till the final sprint.”\n\nBut Johnny Koen disputes Ertjies’ core training regime. “He was always pretending that he trained a lot harder than we did,” says Johnny with a wry smile. “There weren’t any full-time pros. We all had a job of sorts. Ertjies would tell us that he’d trained 120km a night. And to make it worse he’d do 120km a night towing his cousin Leo Van Vuuren over Ertjiesberg four times. I’d say, shit, Ertjies, when you work that backwards you’ve got to leave work at about lunchtime, and you’re towing this guy without him pedaling to get so strong.” But Johnny quickly concedes that Ertjies was in a class of his own: “As a climber, he is probably the best we’ve ever had. At least from 1968 till now.”\n\nRegardless of how intense Ertjies’ training sessions were he was working full-time as a HR officer with parastatal steel company Iscor. He had an arrangement whereby he knocked off at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. “I would do about 60km in the morning before work, and then a full day’s work… well, up till 4pm, but still a full day,” he admits. “And then I would go and do 85km in the evening. In winter time, about 50km of that would be in the dark. It was like holding two jobs,” he says, chuckling and taking a gulp of wine.\n\n“These days, the way they treat the whole training approach is different. I mean we were going out and slogging. I would train extremely hard to have an easy race. Cyclists today, they train light to have a hard race. It’s very different.”\n\n“This tan,” he says, pointing to his deep olive complexion. “This is not a suntan, this is from training at night and the dim and brights coming from the cars in front! Early morning, 5 o’clock, you’d put on the headlight – it was like putting a mining helmet on – and a luminous shunting jacket. In winter time, f*ck it was cold, boet! And I was poor, man. I couldn’t really afford batteries, so I had a dynamo. It fixed onto the fork, and then you had a lamp, and you had a roller that you flicked onto the tyre to turn it on. And I had a dim and bright one. Shit, boet! You can’t believe how many cars actually flashed me at night. I was going so fast because it was cold and I wanted to get home!” Ertjies would also train under the full moon: “Shit, that was the best. Because then I didn’t have to use the dynamo. In the full moon you would have great visibility and I would just ride on the white line. There were hardly any cars on the route that I used to ride.”\n\nErtjies’ prowess as a climber was anything but accidental. Behind the quirky training routine lay a fierce determination that would carry him to the very pinnacle of the sport. Ertjies emerged as a prodigious talent in the late ’70s, creating an elite trio of South African riders that included sprinter Alan van Heerden and all-rounder Robbie McIntosh. Together the three dominated the Rapport Tour in the late ’70s and ’80s, even as international teams made the trip to South Africa to compete in the prestigious two-week race. But Ertjies had picked the wrong time to shine. Apartheid South Africa was in the middle of an international sports boycott and there was no legitimate way for him to test his mettle and compete overseas. This was an immense source of frustration for Ertjies, particularly since Alan van Heerden managed to race overseas under his own name, and won a stage of the 1979 Giro d’Italia. But Ertjies wouldn’t let it go. His insatiable competitive streak had to know where he stood on the international stage.\n\nErtjies’ eyes light with passion as he describes his first taste of racing in Europe: “We were strong. Take Van Heerden in the old days, he was considered one of the top-five stage race sprinters worldwide. McIntosh, a top-10 timetrialist. Strong, hey? Strong! And I was regarded among the top-five mountain climbers. We just wanted to win races. When Van [Heerden] went abroad [in 1978] he joined the amateur club of Peugeot, and while he was there he organized for me to join another club 60km South of Paris. He could go under his own name but I couldn’t. I had to go via England. In my first Rapport Tour the Americans came out and their team manager was a guy from London and he was chairman of the polytechnic cycling club. In those days you had to have a license – either first, second, third or fourth category – to enter races in Europe. He organized me a fourth category license from the polytechnic cycling club in London. Now, fourth category says you can deliver mail, hey! But that gave me an entrance to a club in France, where only Van Heerden and the club coach new my background. I went to London, picked up my license from the polytechnic. Then I took the first train to Dover and the first ferry to Calais. From there I went to Paris and they collected me from the train station and took me to the club. I raced there for four or five months – as Ernest Bessenden!”\n\n“The 1979 Rapport Tour had finished at the end of October, so I didn’t take a break. I rode the Rapport Tour, then trained in November, December, January and most of February. So can you imagine the tan I had, boet!? I was brown, but it was a cycling tan. That year they had the worst storms in Europe, and I got there and all the Froggys where white-white. Then, in my first race I think I rode a second-place. So the press starts asking where this guy has come from? I said my father is Belgian and my mother is Kenyan. So that mix gave me a dark skin and I went to Kenya to do some preparation. And I could speak a little bit of Zulu, and a little bit of funnygalore, which is the mining language, from when I worked on the mines. And obviously I could speak Afrikaans fluently, and English and a little bit of French, which all sounded Belgian. So everybody fell for it. That is how desperate we were to show and test our skills against the best!”\n\nErtjies returned to South Africa with plenty of individual and team race wins and top-five placings. He also had a new trademark moustache: “It was part of my disguise when I went abroad to France, then it became part of the brand.” He had proved himself at the highest level, against some of the best: “When I got to France I was used to racing in SA where there’s just one McIntosh or one Van Heerden. Now, all of a sudden, you’re sitting there in a 150-strong bunch. You don’t have one Van Heerden, you have 20 Van Heerdens… and 20 McIntoshes.”\n\nHe put his international exposure to good use at the following Rapport Tour, greeting the foreigner cyclists with his trademark hospitality: “On the very first stage of the Rapport Tour I would lay down the rules with the outside guys: you come next to me, I shunt you. You sit behind me, I break. Because that first stage is usually a fairly easy stage. But you need those rules and respect later. Those okes were shit-scared of me and they’d back-off. But I’d shit myself that first stage!”\n\nSo just what are the major differences between cycling in South Africa’s golden era, and today? What led to three phenomenal talents in McIntosh, Van Heerden and Bezuidenhout, developing simultaneously? These days, according to Ertjies, “Our riders are just not hard enough. It seems like they are getting through cycling fairly easily with big sponsors, equipment and all that. They don’t really have to work for it.”\n\nFor Ertjies the stint overseas was an eye-opener and it’s what he thinks South African riders are missing now: “I don’t think we were any better in our era than what they are now. Definitely not! I think it’s just a mindset. In those days, you got a false passport and a false license and you went out into the open. You couldn’t speak the language. You went there totally by yourself. I mean, Alan van Heerden was 100km away from me. We might see each other once a week. I’d train out towards him and he’d train towards me, and we’d high-five at halfway and then go back home. Totally on your own! The only guys that can make it on the international circuit are those prepared to suffer it out in Europe, where you’ve got the shittiest weather, you’ve got the cobblestones, it’s totally unsafe racing – I mean, it’s f*cking dangerous there. And to not get homesick. It’s all up here,” he says, tapping his head.\n\nAfter a particularly tough 1986 Rapport Tour, where Alan van Heerden had taken the race leader’s jersey early in the competition and forced his M-Net Southern Sun teammates to work themselves to the bone to protect his lead, Ertjies was ready to call it quits. “That tour was what did it for Ertjies,” reckons Johnny Koen. “It was like having all your teeth pulled without anaesthesia. That same tour, Ertjies ran down a traffic cop in Paarl. And had like 90% scrapes on his body.” He had also had two knee operations in his last two years as a pro.\n\n“In those days we’d earn R2500 a month, which was good money then, but you had to perform,” remembers Ertjies. “Interestingly, I had my first job interview during the 1987 Argus, on the bike. We were racing and gaaning aan and a guy by the name of Dave Thomas came up to me and said listen, would you be interested in a job in East London. I said, Dave, ja, but let’s not talk now, I must win the race. He said, no, just listen. We were coming through Kommetjie and so I said I had a race to win. I was in the same team as Willie Engelbrecht and the previous evening we had decided as a team the race was mine. I think I came sixth. Then, after we finished, Dave said let’s sit down and talk… long story short six week later I went for an interview down in East London at Mercedes-Benz and that was the end of my cycling days. I was ready to move on… I was 35. A good age to stop. I always said that the day that I stop, I stop!”\n\nThese days Ertjies Bezuidenhout avoids putting himself in competitive situations. He consciously decides not to compete in life. “My wife often says, relax, this is not a race. We don’t have to be there first, up the staircase first. You can take the elevator,” he laughs. Ertjies still rides his bike regularly, but he no longer races. He prefers heading out on his own. Even when he rides with one other person he can feel the bulldog behavior coming out. Yet he still gets caught out by his irrepressible need to beat others. When he gets onto the stationary bike at his local gym, for example, he’ll move his bike a centimeter in front of the other bikes lined up. In his words: “It’s so I’m ahead. I’m winning, no-one can come past me!”\n\nHe chooses to ride mid-morning, when he knows he’s not likely to encounter fellow recreational cyclists out on the road. But if a group of cyclists does come past he can’t help himself. He latches onto them. “Now I don’t even have a cycling jersey. I’ve got nice cycling shorts, with a bib, and that’s it. After that I just t-shirt up. One over the other. Why go and spend a thousand bucks? But when these guys come past, what do I do? I climb on the back! They cannot drop me, they get so the moer in. I mean, I’ve got unshaven legs, an old-timer bike, I’m an oke that looks scruffy, I don’t even have a jersey or gloves – I do have a decent crash helmet though! And then you must check these okes. They’ll kick, hey! And I’m still there. In the meantime I’m suffering, but I don’t show it. Years of riding will teach you how to do that – you’re kakking inside, you’re dying, but nobody can see it. I mean the memory is there. It all comes back: this is where you sit, that is where you open your arms, that’s when you move out, all that stuff. It was part of my life for 20 years. And I go straight back.”\n\nHere’s to a fast and fearless recovery, Ertjies."
