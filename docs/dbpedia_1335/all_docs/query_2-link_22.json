        "text": "The LA Giltinis defeated the Houston SaberCats 17-12 in a bruising encounter at Memorial Coliseum on Saturday. It stretches LA’s winning streak to five games as they continue to push towards Austin and the top spot in the Western Conference.\n\nBoth teams would lose starting players early. LA captain Dave Dennis was a late scratch before kickoff, with Corey Thomas instead wearing No5 but playing on the flank. Nathan Den Hoedt moved to the second row. Meanwhile Houston fullback Robbie Povey went down with a knee injury in the opening minute, replaced by Zach Pangelinan.\n\nAn overthrow at the lineout gave Houston the first scoring opportunity. Juan Pablo Zeiss barged ahead and when the ball was recycled Danny Barrett went low under the defense to reach the line. Davey Coetzer add the conversion and the SaberCats had a 7-nil lead.\n\nThe Giltinis came roaring back and won a scrum penalty. They turned down a shot at goal and poured on the pressure until repeat infringements saw a yellow card brandished to Jaco Bezuidenhout. LA opted for another scrum and this time a penalty try was awarded when the Houston front row stood up.\n\nA sensational solo effort from Hanco Germishuys gave LA the lead just before Bezuidenhout returned to the pitch. The Eagles dynamo took a quick tap on a penalty at Houston’s 22-meter line and proceeded to run around Coetzer and through the tackles of Matai Leuta and Barrett to score. Orene Ai’i landed the conversion to make it a full seven.\n\nThe SaberCats began to take the edge in the scrum and after winning a penalty opted for the corner. When the drive went sideways they attacked up the middle and crossed under the posts, but the ball was help up and the halftime whistle went with the score remaining 14-7 to the home side.\n\nMore hard work from the Houston pack was finally rewarded with a try. Penalties put them into attacking position and after the Giltinis defended staunchly for countless phases, the ball was spun wide where Christian Dyer found just enough space to squeeze over the line. Coetzer pulled his kick across the face of the uprights but the visitors were back within two points.\n\nThe scrum pendulum swung again and LA launched a furious assault on Houston’s line. A bobbled ball at a lineout saw Joe Taufete’e come inches short, and then Ben LeSage was held up by Gerrie Labuschagne after the SaberCats slammed the midfield door shut.\n\nBack and forth the two teams wrestled during the final minutes. The referee lost patience with Frikkie de Beer after another Houston scrum collapse, dispatching him to the bin, and Luke Burton sent the 40-meter penalty kick through the uprights to seal the victory.\n\nHouston are straight back into action next weekend with a home game against the Toronto Arrows on Saturday. It’s a week off for the Giltinis, who will look to make it six in a row when they travel to Silverbacks Park to play Rugby ATL on April 30.\n\nSCORING\n\nLA 17\n\nTries – Penalty try (17′), H.
