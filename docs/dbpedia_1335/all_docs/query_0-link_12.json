        "text": "Lions march to another win\n\nKen Borland\n\nMWP\n\nSeptember 16, 2011\n\nFine attacking play by the MTN Golden Lions saw them to a 43-23 (halftime 21-9) win over the Platinum Leopards in their Absa Currie Cup match at Profert Olen Park in Potchefstroom on Friday.\n\nThe Lions were quick to capitalise on the frailties of the Leopards in defence and in the set-pieces, running in six tries, but the home team will be rueing a first half in which they wasted three clearcut scoring chances that could have had them on level terms at the break.\n\nThe visitors' defence was also fantastic, only allowing the Leopards to cross their line twice in the last three minutes, but both flyhalf Wesley Dunlop and wing Vainon Willis knocked-on close to the tryline and the home side also lost their own lineout throw five metres from the Lions line on one occasion.\n\nThe Leopards took a 3-0 lead through a Dunlop penalty in the seventh minute, but the Lions quickly struck back through a try by flank Derick Minnie, although hooker Bandise Maku will be claiming some of the credit after his lovely pop-pass and then a strong carry of the ball earlier in the move.\n\nDunlop cut the gap to 6-7 with another penalty in the 19th minute after the Lions went walkabout again at a ruck.\n\nThe Leopards were penalised several times at scrum time - loosehead BG Uys cops most of the flak here - and the Lions made telling use of one of them in the 23rd minute. Flyhalf Elton Jantjies kicked to touch, lock Franco van der Merwe took well at the lineout, prop JC Janse van Rensburg charged forward, and a neat loop move by Jantjies allowed fullback Jaco Taute to dummy and then go over the line.\n\n[embed:video:id=105171]\n\nJantjies snuck the conversion over from a fair angle and the Lions led 14-6.\n\nThe Leopards were on the attack from the kick-off, but great Lions defence meant their efforts were becalmed, although they did come away with three points via a Dunlop penalty (14-9).\n\nThe Lions had the last say before halftime, however, when the outstanding Minnie scored from an excellent rolling maul, Jantjies converting (21-9).\n\nNine minutes after the break, the Lions won another scrum penalty, Van der Merwe once again won the lineout and another explosive run by Janse van Rensburg was followed by tighthead Pat Cilliers barging over under the poles. Jantjies converted and the Lions led 28-9.\n\nJantjies added an extra three points six minutes later after a strong tackle by centre Alwyn Hollenbach had won a penalty.\n\nThe Lions' fifth try was a particularly fine effort. Janse van Rensburg burst powerfully from a rolling maul and the slick Jantjies then offloaded a beautiful pop-pass inside to wing Michael Killian, who came racing through to score.\n\nJohan Snyman dived over from a ruck in the 70th minute, although the former Sharks lock will be more concerned with the knee injury that saw him leave the field moments later.\n\nThe Leopards will be pleased they managed to grab two quick tries before the end, but it was no more than they deserved.\n\nReplacement scrumhalf Johann Laker was the first to go over after a good pick-and-go by flank Robert Kruger and hooker Gavin Williamson scored after a fine rolling maul. Replacement flyhalf Clayton Durand kicked both conversions.\n\nSCORERS:\n\nPlatinum Leopards - Tries: Johann Laker, Gavin Williamson. Conversions: Clayton Durand (2). Penalties: Wesley Dunlop (3).\n\nMTN Golden Lions - Tries: Derick Minnie (2), Jaco Taute, Pat Cilliers, Michael Killian, Johan Snyman. Conversions: Elton Jantjies (5). Penalty: Jantjies.\n\nWell, still topping the table"
