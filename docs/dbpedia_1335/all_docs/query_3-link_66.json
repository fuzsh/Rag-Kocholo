        "text": "Christiaan Bezuidenhout made it back to back wins and Jamie Donaldson secured his place at the DP World Tour Championship as the South African Swing drew to a close.\n\nHere is everything you need to know from a thrilling week at Gary Player Country Club.\n\nBezuidenhout goes back to back...\n\nChristiaan Bezuidenhout secured consecutive European Tour wins on home soil following a five shot victory. The 26-year-old began his final round with a five shot advantage over Welshman Jamie Donaldson, who cut the deficit to two before the turn. But Bezuidenhout regained his form on the the back nine to sign for a 69 and finish on 18 under par overall. The South African will be a dark horse at next week's season-ending DP World Tour Championship, Dubai after climbing into the top five of the 2020 Race to Dubai standings. \"It's unbelievable to stand here with an Open win,\" Bezuidenhout said. \"It's any South African golfer's dream to win a national tournament. It's unreal.‚Äù\n\n...but not without a slice of luck\n\nA five shot winning margin sounds comfortable enough but, as Donaldson stood over a birdie putt on the 17th that would have reduced the arrears to three, Bezuidenhout got lucky when a wayward drive - seemingly headed for the undergrowth - bounced off a cart path and into the rough. At that point his lead being two heading up 18 seemed a long shot, but Donaldson three putted and Bezuidenhout got a kind bounce off the bank of the bunker with his next to save par."
