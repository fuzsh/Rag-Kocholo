        "text": "“Whatever it takes“, the Glasgow motto could be seen everywhere at Scotstoun and both sides took it to heart in this gladiatorial contest for the prize of a place in the Pro12 final. After three semi-final defeats on the road Glasgow were determined to make home advantage count. Munster were equally determined to be the first away […]\n\nSadly the season ended a few weeks earlier than we had hoped for, but after a committed game of attritional trench warfare Glasgow booked a place in the Pro12 final for the first time on their fourth attempt, proving the value of a top 2 seeding for the home draw. My usual blog about being at the […]\n\nIf JJ Hanrahan’s late drop goal effort or his more long-shot last kick of the game penalty had managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat we would have gone home somewhat relieved that the fortress had not been breached for the 2nd home game in a row but far from happy. While Munster […]\n\nWho’s playing 10? Is Murray playing 10? Did he not get the conversion of the penalty try? Was he blocked down? Why is the score not updated if he did? Smart phones were consulted in Break For the Border to solve the confusion…only the website consulted credited the conversion to JJ Hanrahan who we knew […]\n\nStand up and fight until you hear the bell Stand toe to toe, trade blow for blow Just 3 weeks ago Munster stood up to the firepower and financial strength of Toulouse and prevailed. Their reward was a trip to Marseille to take on the multinational and big budget team Toulon, defending European champions. This […]\n\nMunster head to the south of France for the second year in a row for a semi-final, in this the last year of the Heineken Cup competition. Marseilles is the destination and current forecasts indicate that the weather will be unseasonal with rain and low temperatures forecasted for the game on Sunday. While the cooler […]\n\nThis weekend there were many events to celebrate the 1000 year anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf where proud Munster man, Brian Boru from Killaloe led his army to victory over the Vikings. See details at http://brianboru2014.com/ In Thomond on Saturday, many of the traveling supporters wore kilts and helmets. I wonder what Brian Boru would think […]\n\nWhat an opening five minutes! It blew away our nerves and got the 16th man aka the Red Army into the game from the start. Two line-outs stolen in quick succession gave Munster plenty of possession and territory. The highlights reel does not do justice to the first try as it focuses on the final […]\n\nCongratulations to Edward Fitzgerald, clear winner of the competition to name this blog. Read on to discover why the blog is named after Doris… Before the game there was plenty of talk about Munster v Ireland, then the appointment of Alain Rolland was criticised due to his Leinster background. A propping crisis affected Leinster while […]\n\nSt David’s day provided a chance for Munster to make history by being the first side to win all four home and away games against Welsh opposition in the League and continue their unbeaten run. Regular readers know my approach has always been of the “glass half full” perspective and there were definitely glimpses of brilliance […]"
