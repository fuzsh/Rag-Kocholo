The Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team was preparing for our trip to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the 1982 Big Ten Championships were scheduled to take place. But the morning we were about to leave, one of my wrestlers was missing. Sophomore Barry Davis, a returning All-­ American and ranked number one in the nation in the 118-­ pound weight class, was nowhere to be found. “Where’s Barry?” I asked my troops. I was answered with a bunch of shrugged shoulders, “I don’t knows,” and blank stares. I made my way over to Davis’s locker and saw a note taped to it. The outside of the note read: “To Coach Gable.” I immediately knew this could not be good news as I opened it and read the contents: Coach Gable: I am sorry I’m not going to make this trip with you guys. I wish you all the very best at the championships. Don’t try to find me because you never will. Good luck. Barry Davis In that moment, my first thought was, “Oh, boy . . .” I was worried about Davis and I was worried about the team. In those years, Davis was our spark plug and got the whole team fired up. A WRESTLING LIFE 80 Davis was always a character, popular with his teammates and our fans. A few years later, when Iowa would host Oklahoma State, Davis would stand across the mat from his opponent for initial introductions . When the announcer called Davis’s name, he would step forward and mime drawing a gun and shooting across the mat at his Oklahoma State Cowboys opponent. Our fans would just go nuts. That moment may never have happened though, had I, in 1982, standing in front of Davis’s locker, not jumped into action. I turned to the team and read the letter aloud, then asked again, “Does anyone know where Barry is?” The locker room was silent except for a dripping shower. I immediately went into problem-­ solving mode. I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. I used to watch the Sherlock Holmes television program in the 1970s and really admired his theory of deductive reasoning. Basically, when investigating something , you take six possible solutions and reduce them down to the two strongest possibilities. I knew then that I was in a Sherlock Holmes moment; I had to find Davis. I immediately put together a plan. The assistant coaches would take the nine competing wrestlers and a few alternates to the airport to catch their flight to Detroit, then drive the ninety minutes to Ann Arbor so they could make the 6:00 p.m. weigh-­ ins. I was going to stay behind in Iowa City and do whatever I could to find Davis. I would meet up with the team later, with or without their teammate. As the team headed out, I went up to my office. I pulled out a yellow legal pad and pencil and began making a list of all sorts of possibilities as to where Davis could be, including who may have seen him the previous evening. I also called the twenty wrestlers who were not travelling to Ann Arbor to compete to get them involved in searching for Davis. I sent them out into different parts of the community to look for their missing teammate and also interviewed each one to see if they could shed any light on this mystery. [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-10 08:15 GMT) SAVING BARRY DAVIS 81 As I made notes and talked to my wrestlers, I had an interesting thought: if Davis had been in the locker room the previous night to tape the note on his locker, the overnight custodial staff may have seen him. It didn’t take me long to find the overnight custodial workers, who proved my hunch right. One of them told me that one of my wrestlers had indeed been in there last night. He was in the sauna for a while and then just left around four in the morning. With that one piece of concrete information, I raced back to my office and continued contacting members of the team. I kept asking questions, coming up with possibilities, and dropping those least likely. Finally, another piece of information came in, this time from a teammate. One of the guys on the team..."
