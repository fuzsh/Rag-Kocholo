        "text": "With over 40 years in the field of education, Barry Davis brings a wealth of professional experience to his position as the eighth Head of School at McLean School. Starting his career as a coach, Barry’s love and passion for teaching followed him from the basketball court to the classroom and later to leadership roles in several independent schools including Flint Hill School in Virginia (Middle School Head), Brooklyn Friends School in New York (Middle School Director), Greensboro Day School in North Carolina (Middle School Director), and, St. Anne’s Episcopal School in Delaware (Head of School), where he successfully and significantly boosted enrollment and built a culture of philanthropy. Barry is a collaborative and effective leader who prioritizes relationships and respect in his work with teachers, students, and their families. He holds an MEd in Educational Leadership and School Administration and Supervision from Central Connecticut State University, an MEd in Educational Counseling and Human Development, and a BS in Physical Education from St. Lawrence University.\n\nBarry will tell you that, like many McLean students, he didn’t feel successful in a traditional school setting. This experience opened his eyes and mind to the power of caring educators who see and celebrate each individual student’s strengths while supporting them in their areas of challenge. As the parent of two sons with learning challenges, Barry identifies with families looking for support, skill-building, community, and a positive school experience. “I may be new to McLean, but in many ways, I am McLean. I’m excited to work alongside passionate educators, bright and creative students, and engaged families to provide a meaningful, transformational education for everyone.”"
