        "text": "North Melbourne has made a solitary change for Saturday's Sir Doug Nicholls Round clash with Yartapuulti/Port Adelaide.\n\nJackson Archer has managed to overcome an ankle issue that kept him out of action last week and will be on the plane to Hobart.\n\nHe replaces Miller Bergman in defence, with the No.27 set to miss the next month with a hamstring strain.\n\nToby Pink, Charlie Lazzaro, Eddie Ford, Wil Dawson and Bailey Scott have been named on the interchange bench, with one of the five to be named substitute when the final line-up is locked in an hour before Saturday's opening bounce.\n\nHugh Greenwood, Robert Hansen jnr, and Dylan Stephens have been named as emergencies.\n\nKey defender Kallan Dawson is fit but will make his comeback from an ankle injury via the VFL, as will Brayden George who is set to return from a dislocated shoulder in the reserves' trip to Werribee on Sunday.\n\nThe Kangas will pull on 'Kangaroo Way' for the second time this season, the 2024 Indigenous designed by Wemba Wemba, Gunditjmara, Ngadjonji and Taungurung artist Emma Bamblett.\n\nNorth Melbourne will also wear a specially designed warm-up top in Nipaluna/Hobart.\n\nThe design, by trawlwoolway man of Lutruwita/Tasmania and direct descendant of Manaleganna, Danny Gardner, tells the story of the creation of Palawa, the first Tasmanian Aboriginal person.\n\nThe first Palawa was created by two spirits who are brothers, Rrumitina and Muyini, who came from the night sky.\n\nThe design reflects on the deep connection between the Palawa people (the footprints) and their Country (kangaroo paw prints), as well as the knowledge of the Palawa people about the deep spiritual connection to their ancestors, which is passed onto future generations."
