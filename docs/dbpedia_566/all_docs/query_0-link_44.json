        "text": "Wildcat Career\n\n2023 - Appeared in three games this season...recorded two rushes for six yards at Stonehill...completed one pass for nine yards at Stony Brook\n\n2022 - Has appeared in one of thirteen games this season..rushed three times for 23 yards and a touchdown vs Elon.\n\nKleinpeter is a 6-foot-2, 200-pound quarterback who was a four-year starter and started every game for the Savannah Country Day School Hornets. Kleinpeter was named the Georgia Region 3a Player of the Year as a senior. He was selected All-Region First Team as both a sophomore and junior, as well as All-Region Second Team as a freshman.\n\nKleinpeter was named the SCDS Offensive Player of the Year in 2020 and 2021. In 2019, he led Savannah Country Day to an undefeated season and the school’s first region championship in 40 years. That same year, he was named the quarterback on the ESPN All Coastal Empire Team.\n\nIn 2021, Kleinpeter was selected to the WJCL BIG 22, which honors the top 22 football players in the southeast Georgia area. Over the course of his career, he was selected a record four times (one time for defense) for the coveted Savannah Quarterback Club Player of the Week.\n\nKleinpeter was voted team captain of the football team as a junior and senior. He finished his career as the all-time leader in touchdown passes (74), passing yards (6,927), total touchdowns (rushing plus passing) for a QB with 93, and total yards (rushing plus passing) for a QB with 8,399 in the history of Savannah, Georgia football.\n\nKleinpeter has lettered in football, basketball, and baseball every year of his high school career. A switch-hitting shortstop, third baseman and pitcher, he started on the varsity baseball team his freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons. He was selected All-Region First Team as a junior.\n\nWhat Coach Santos Says: Barry is a dynamic three-sport athlete who is a fierce competitor and has a winning pedigree. He is as dangerous with his legs as he is with his arm and can make all the plays necessary to excel at this level. The dual threat QB has the ability to push the ball down the field and also make intermediate passes. He has a knack for throwing people open and is very accurate. We’re excited to have him as a part of our team and the future is bright in Durham."
