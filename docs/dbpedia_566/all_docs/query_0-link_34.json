        "text": "When it came to proposing a $7 billion marriage, the third time turned out to be the charm for Barry Davis, the CEO of Crosstex Energy LP.\n\nIn the next month or so, the Dallas-based pipeline and energy services company will complete its merger with a division of Devon Energy Corp. in Oklahoma City to form EnLink Midstream Partners LP.\n\nThe new entity will instantly become a major force in bringing energy from the Barnett Shale, Permian and Marcellus/Utica formations to refineries and utilities in the country’s midsection.\n\nIt will be headquartered here and run by Davis, even though Crosstex put up only about a third of the assets. The Dallas headquarters staff of 220 will increase by 50, mostly new hires.\n\nThe deal, announced in October and embraced by Wall Street, is a testament to Davis’ quiet and persistent courting of John Richels, Devon’s CEO.\n\nThe two chief executives became friends through another huge deal in 2006, when Devon enlisted Crosstex as its partner in buying the North Texas assets of Trevor Rees-Jones’ Chief Oil & Gas. Devon bought the production business while Crosstex bought the pipeline and infrastructure part.\n\nIn the process, Devon became Crosstex’s largest pipeline customer. That’s when Davis began his subtle courtship.\n\n“Over the last eight years, I met with John at least once, if not two or three times a year, just to ask: ‘How are we doing? What can we do better?’” Davis, 52, says in his headquarters office in Uptown. “I would always remind him as I left, ‘Someday we’re going to do something bigger than this together.’\n\n“I actually proposed something similar to this twice before — first time was in 2007, second time was in 2009 — but the timing wasn’t right.”\n\nRichels says he enjoyed these meetings from a business and personal standpoint.\n\n“Barry is a terrific guy personality-wise,” Richels says. “But more importantly, he’s honest, forthright and not a guy with agendas.”\n\nShared values\n\nLate last February, Devon announced that it was considering spinning off its midstream business in a public offering. Davis and his team hightailed it to Oklahoma City a month later to pitch their case.\n\nThis time, the Crosstex contingent found receptive ears. Devon needed expertise to manage its growing midstream presence, which includes transporting, storing and marketing. Richels trusted Davis and his executive team to do that.\n\n“It always struck me,” Richels says, “that many of the values that we think are important and make up our culture at Devon are things that Barry thinks are important and make up the Crosstex culture.”\n\nDavis describes that Crosstex culture as egalitarian.\n\n“Go into our parking garage,” he says. “There are no designated spaces. If I get here late, I go to the fifth floor. If I get here early, I get the first spot.”\n\nMost days, he doesn’t have to walk very far.\n\n“I have a goal where every night, people go home in the healthiest state possible, which means they’ve been treated with respect, honor and celebrated,” he says.\n\nIf you're looking for J.R. Ewing opulence, you won't find it at Crosstex headquarters. Visitors in the tiny reception area can entertain themselves with such scintillating magazines as Materials Performance, which focuses on the prevention and control of corrosion, or Rigs & Drillers.\n\nInstead of expensive oil paintings, the hallways are decorated with photos of employees, many in hard hats.\n\nA buffet lunch is served every day at the seven-story headquarters on Cedar Springs Road — cold cuts and salads or something simple like tacos or lasagna. Top executives and staffers eat shoulder-to-shoulder at one long communal table.\n\nDavis established this daily fellowship in 2000, when he bought a foldout table and red-checked tablecloth at Office Depot and lunch meats and salads at his grocery store, and set up the casual fare the next day.\n\n“Seeing ourselves like a family, we felt we needed to create opportunities for us to sit around the table, have lunch and talk,” says Davis, who typically eats with the troops at least once a week.\n\nSmall-town roots\n\nYou can trace his no-pretense attitude to his small-town roots.\n\nDavis grew up in Frisco back when everybody knew everybody. His dad owned an automotive and farm equipment repair shop; his mother owned the Town & Country Beauty Salon.\n\nDavis was an athletic star on just about every team Frisco High School had.\n\nHe got a finance degree from Texas Christian University on a baseball scholarship, thinking he’d like to be a banker.\n\nRight after college, he spent less than a year shadowing the chairman of Overton Park Bank in Fort Worth as his right-hand man before deciding that the inside of a bank was too confining.\n\nHe moved into the energy business in late 1985 by going to work for Enserch Corp. as a landman making deals for drilling rights in the fields of East and North Texas.\n\n“The energy business for me continues to be interacting and transacting with people,” he says. “I love that.”\n\nIn 1996, Davis and eight others formed Crosstex with a total capitalization of $4 million — next to nothing in the energy business.\n\nThe trajectory was astounding, with employees, assets, revenue and profitability rising sharply for a decade, Davis says. “We grew a thousand-fold from $4 million to $4 billion in value.”\n\nIt went public in 2002 and dazzled Wall Street.\n\nIn 2008, the good times came to a screeching halt as the capital markets collapsed.\n\n“We were leveraged for growth, and growth stopped,” Davis says. Crosstex sold about half of the company in various transactions.\n\n“We learned that perfect storms happen, and you have to have financial strength to stay in the game,” he says. “We didn’t have the right balance sheet. We didn’t have the right contract mix. But we had the right people who never gave up.”\n\nThose 18 months of fighting for survival were a key reason Davis wanted to join forces with Devon. “We will have a diverse set of assets that will give us the strength to manage and deal with the cycles of the business,” Davis says.\n\n'The real deal'\n\nNorm Bagwell, CEO of Bank of Texas, watched his friend rebuild Crosstex and negotiate the merger.\n\n“Barry is the real deal,” Bagwell says. “Family man, athlete, leader, chief executive, high character, difference-maker, man of faith. If things get tough, I want him on my team.”\n\nCrosstex executive vice president William Davis (no relation) came to work for Barry in late 2001. What does he like most about his boss? “His servant-leader style and living his moral convictions.”\n\nEnLink is a happy union for all involved, Barry Davis contends. Shareholders of both companies have seen their stock rise since the deal was announced and are expected to give their blessings before the end of the first quarter.\n\nAnd unlike most mergers, no one’s job is in danger.\n\n“We had no overlap. We won’t lose a single head count as a result of the combination,” Davis says. “We think this is an unprecedented renaissance period for the energy business. We expect to double in size again in the next five years. People are going to have a tremendous opportunity to grow with the company.\n\n“And the most important thing: We’re not going to change who we are.”\n\nBARRY DAVIS\n\nCurrent title: President and CEO, Crosstex Energy\n\nAge: 52\n\nGrew up: Frisco\n\nEducation: Frisco High School, 1980; business degree in finance, Texas Christian University, 1984\n\nResides: Preston Hollow\n\nPersonal: Married to his college sweetheart, Antoinette, for 29 years; two daughters in college\n\nOutside work: He and Antoinette, members of Watermark, a mega-church in North Dallas, are on the leadership team building Watermark Fort Worth.\n\nENLINK MIDSTREAM\n\nCEO: Barry Davis\n\nHeadquarters: Dallas\n\nEmployees: 1,200, including 270 in Dallas\n\nMerger completion: By end of the first quarter\n\nOwnership structure: Master limited partnership, 53 percent owned by Devon; the remainder is publicly traded stock (converted Crosstex shares) that will trade on the NYSE.\n\nEnterprise value: $13 billion\n\nProfitability: $700 million in earnings after taxes, interest and other factors."
