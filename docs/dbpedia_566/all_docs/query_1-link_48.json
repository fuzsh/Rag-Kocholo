        "text": "Your divorce or family law matter is one of the most difficult life challenges you may face. The resolution of your case will have a lasting impact on your children, your finances, and your family structure.\n\nDivorce cases are first and foremost about the lives, relationships, and futures of the people involved. Because divorce creates significant disruption and results in permanent changes, there are many questions you might have at the outset, such as:\n\nHow will my partner and I split up our property?\n\nWill I be able to support myself?\n\nHow do I protect my relationship with my children?\n\nWhere will I live?\n\nWhere will my children live?\n\nHow do I prevent my spouse or domestic partner from moving our assets?\n\nYour individual needs are unique to your situation. Whether by vigorous negotiation or powerful litigation, you can be assured that I will provide you with the finest legal services in all family law matters.\n\nIn my 30+ years of experience, I have guided families of all types through the process of family law litigation. I’ve provided expert legal advice to wives, husbands, children, domestic partners, and married and unmarried parents. I’ve worked to resolve divorce / dissolution of marriage and domestic partnerships, child custody, child support, adoption, and related matters in Oregon."
