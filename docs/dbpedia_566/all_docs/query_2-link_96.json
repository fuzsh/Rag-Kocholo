The height of celebrity fandom came during the the late sixties and early seventies when the style and glamour of the team was matched by those wandering the Kings Road.\n\nStories of Raquel Welch or Steve McQueen in the dressing room and the VIP areas overflowing were common place, however given the length of the list below it seems those days have returned!\n\nThis is a list of celebrities, alive and dead, it is believed support Chelsea. Not all have had their allegiance proved but most have been verified. Ex-players and directors are not included as their support is taken as read! Corrections/additions welcomed."
