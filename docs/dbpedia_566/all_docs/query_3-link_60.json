        "text": "Barry Davis has been a Social Studies teacher at Bethel High School in Hampton, VA for 24 years. In that time he has taught World Geography, World History I and II, VA/US History, and currently is teaching VA/US Government and Psychology. He was Coach of the Debate Team for 3 years, and has also been an Assistant Baseball Coach for two different high schools in his area. Outside of teaching, he has volunteered as a Civil War living historian for the National Park Service at the Richmond Nat. Battlefields, Gettysburg, and Haper’s Ferry. He also has been a baseball umpire for local youth leagues and the Virginia High School League since 1992.\n\n‘I believe the impact of the Civil War can be felt still in today’s society in the expanding role of our government and the on-going evolution of civil rights and equality.’"
