        "text": "Week 11 Game Notes - \"Big Lebowski\" Edition\n\nRUSSELLVILLE, Ark. - The Arkansas Tech Wonder Boys football team will play just one more game in the 2017 season, and this Saturday's Agent Barry Live United Bowl in Texarkana looks to be a classic. Two of the top all-time Division II programs will face off on the gridiron as the Wonder Boys (8-3) square off against Pittsburg State (7-4) at Arkansas High School in Texarkana.\n\nWith 1,266 combined wins between the two programs, Arkansas Tech and Pittsburg State bring a great deal of history to the field. They also bring what is unquestionably the best mascot matchup of the football postseason.\n\nPittsburg State enters the playoffs on a hot streak. After a narrow loss to MIAA champion Fort Hays State, the Gorillas won five consecutive games to end the season. After wins over Missouri Western and Emporia State Pitt State picked off defending national champion Northwest Missouri State to end the Bearcats' 38-game winning streak, and followed with wins over Nebraska-Kearney and Missouri Southern to close the regular season.\n\nThe Gorillas' offense has been led by the rush. Pitt State averages 223.7 yards per game on the ground, while throwing for 153.8 yards. Pitt State has racked up 2,461 yards on the ground with junior Michael Rose accounting for 1,003 of those to go along with six scores.\n\nSignal-callers John Roderique and Thomas LePage have split the snaps under center, with the Gorillas finding the majority of their success with LePage under center. LePage has completed 68 of 123 passes for 926 yards and 10 scores against just three interceptions, and on the receiving end, the tandem of Lorenzo West and Austin Panko have done the majority of the team's damage. West has hauled in 32 catches for 433 yards and four scores and Panko has grabbed five touchdown passes with 484 yards receiving.\n\nFor the Wonder Boys, a stellar rushing attack has racked up 2,479 yards on the ground with the tandem of Bryan Allen and Braden Stringer doing the majority of the heavy lifting. Allen has rushed for 814 yards and eight scores, while Stringer has rushed for 755 yards and nine scores. Allen averages 5.1 yards per carry, while Stringer has averaged 8.5 yards each time he touches the ball.\n\nStringer has proven himself to be one of the nation's most capable return men as well, having two punt returns for touchdowns.\n\nUnder center, Ty Reasnor has provided a steady hand for the Wonder Boys, completing 186 of 289 passes for 2,271 yards and 19 scores against just five interceptions. The Cashion, Okla. native has been a consistent presence under center for Arkansas Tech, and has also rushed for 372 yards and eight scores.\n\nJakcob Dean has been Reasnor's favorite target, hauling in 50 passes for 594 yards and three scores, while Tevin McKenzie (478 yards, 6 TD), J.V. Davis (306 yards, 4 TD), Drew Wade (203 yards, 2 TD), and Tremel Glasper (208 yards, one TD) have been popular targets for the senior.\n\nMeanwhile, on the defensive side of the ball, Tech has been paced by the solid play of Texarkana native KJ Reid. The junior has racked up a team-best 102 tackles with 9.0 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks, four pass breakups, and five fumble recoveries.\n\nSaturday's kickoff is set for noon. The game will be carried locally at 102.3-FM (KCJC) in Russellville, while live audio, video, and statistics will be available at www.arkansastechsports.com.\n\n-FIGHTON-\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#25 Bryan Allen\n\nRB\n\n5' 11\"\n\nJunior\n\n#19 J.V.
