        "text": "Bow Ties, Books and a Doctorate\n\nDr. Barry Davis (’77 & ’23) carefully selects his daily bow tie from his extensive collection that includes ones he has received as gifts, such as one from Ukraine, as well others he has purchased himself. Selecting and tying his bow tie is a routine that has been part of his life for over 10 years. His uncle always wore bow ties, some of which were made by Barry’s grandmother (some are still in his collection). Barry remembers first selecting a bow tie to wear to that uncle’s memorial service and hasn’t wavered since. The bow tie is now an identifiable part of his wardrobe and even his business card.\n\nBarry also carefully selects his books, frequently used ones, initially storing the information he has gleaned from them on 3×5 cards. Now they are stored in his FileMaker® database so he can easily access this knowledge to share with others, such as his college students, colleagues, clients and those following him on Goodreads.\n\nThis level of dedication isn’t limited to books. It also includes a dedication to running that started in 1979 when he was determined to lose weight. Now, 45 years later, that running has since turned into completing 34 marathons and over 140 other races, understanding that running is his protected “alone time” where he listens to sermons, prepares for his day and finds ideas for his research and writing.\n\nIt’s his interest in learning that brought him to earning his PhD in Leadership from Lancaster Bible College l Capital Seminary & Graduate School in May 2023. “I always wanted a doctorate. I believe in practicing lifelong learning,” he shares. “God made me curious. When I learn I feel, His glory.”\n\nHis pursuit of a PhD wasn’t just inspired by his love for learning and knowing that “everything we do is sacred.” It also finds inspiration through encouragement from his family. Barry further reminisces about his father, a mechanic who struggled with spelling but was “absolutely brilliant in his own way.” He recalls comments made by three of his family members: his younger brother, Jerry (‘77), who is three years his junior, and two cousins. All three earned doctoral degrees before Barry. He recalls being told, “You should have had a PhD first, not us.” Through the graciousness of an anonymous donor, Barry entered his PhD program in 2019 knowing his tuition was covered. It was a graciousness that left Barry with one simple word: “Wow!”\n\n“Wow” in the form of audible gasps was also the reaction when Barry’s dissertation focus—narcissism and pastors—was announced as he officially received his PhD at LBC’s spring graduation ceremony. It was a response he didn’t hear, as he describes he was “in the zone” awaiting his hooding on the Good Shepherd Chapel stage.\n\nHis dissertation, titled “A Qualitative Content Analysis of the Governance of Two Megachurches that Released their Founding Pastors for Narcissistic Action,” focused on the church governance of two megachurches that had released their leaders after years of growing narcissism and abuse in their leadership. His content analysis identified the importance of bylaws that teams and elders didn’t follow, resulting in the overreach of the founding pastors. While his project is complete, “I would love to do more research” in this area, he says.\n\nBarry’s life hasn’t just included bow ties, books and a doctoral degree. He is a counselor, career coach, blogger, minister, marathoner and adjunct professor of psychology, leadership and biblical courses at three faith-based institutions of higher education, including LBC | Capital. He loves showing his students that all truth is God’s truth. His earlier days even included running a gym in Manhattan, working as a chambermaid, working at a foundry and trimming trees. “It all brings value,” he emphasizes. “I often tell my students that the smartest person in the room may be wearing overalls. I’m blessed by the time I’ve spent in such work.”\n\nBarry also credits his wife of nearly 53 years, Andi, for being by his side throughout their life together, his PhD journey and his book orders. “I’m not done learning, (and) I won’t stop ordering books!” He likely won’t stop collecting and wearing bow ties either."
