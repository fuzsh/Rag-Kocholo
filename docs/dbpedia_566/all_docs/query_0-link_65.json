        "text": "Posted Thursday 23 May 2024 at 8:33am , updated Thursday 23 May 2024 at 1:11pm\n\nSkip to timeline\n\nThe Sydney Swans have extended their record to 10 wins and one loss after defeating the Western Bulldogs.\n\nThe ladder leaders ran out 14-point winners, 16.6 (102) to 12.16 (88), against a Bulldogs team who finished the match with two fit plays on the bench.\n\nStar Bulldog Aaron Naughton was carried off the field with a knee injury in the second term, with the club optimistic it is not a ruptured ACL.\n\nAnthony Scott and Ed Richards were both ruled out of Thursday night's match with concussions after separate head clashes with Swans players.\n\nScott's clash with Harry Cunningham came in the opening minutes of the opening term, starting the Bulldogs' injury woes early.\n\nWith just two fit players on the bench, the Swans were able to wear down the Bulldogs who took a four-point lead into half-time.\n\nBulldogs coach Luke Beveridge said he took plenty of heart from the loss, after clawing a 30-point deficit down to eight late in the final term before the Swans kicked the last goal.\n\n\"In the long run, I just think our players showed enormous character,\" Beveridge says.\n\n\"Our backline stayed on for the whole last half and Tim English did as well … all in all, there was great integrity in what the boys did.\n\n\"In my books, our players are winners tonight.\"\n\nChad Warner was a star for the Swans, kicking four goals and taking a terrific flying mark.\n\nWarner also had the equal-most disposals for the Swans with 25, along with Errol Gulden.\n\nBrownlow Medal fancy Isaac Heeney had 23 disposals and a fourth-quarter goal which proved crucial come full-time.\n\nDespite being injury-ravaged, the Bulldogs had more inside-50s (60-46), more clearances (38-33) and more contested possessions (140-106).\n\nSwans coach John Longmire said his team, despite being 10-1 through 11 rounds, have plenty to work on after the bye next week.\n\n\"We didn't play as well as we'd like to have played,\" Longmire said.\n\n\"In the end, they had a number of scoring shots and we were well beaten in the contest.\n\n\"There are still some things we can work on, and I think that's probably a positive for us.\"\n\nFollow the live blog below, keep up to date with all the latest stats in our ScoreCentre, and tune in to our live radio coverage.\n\nThis is where we leave the blog\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nWe have enjoyed a truly facinating night of AFL footy.\n\nThe Swans beat the Bulldogs by 14 points, but there was so much more to it than that.\n\nSydney was not at their clinical best, the Dogs were brave in the face of injury, and both teams can feel like they have the potential for big things in September.\n\nWe will be back tomorrow for more action from round 11.\n\nFor Alex Darling, I'm Michael Doyle wishing you a good night.\n\nKey Event\n\nJohn Longmire says winning is positive, but there is plenty of work to do\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nTonight was not the best performance from the Swans.\n\nConsidering the injuries the Bulldogs had during the contest, and the 30-point lead the Swans built, the fourth-quarter was a little tighter than it should have been.\n\nSwans coach John Longmire says during his press conference the team will address areas of improvement after their bye next week.\n\n\"We didn't play as well as we'd like to have played,\" Longmire said.\n\n\"In the end, they had a number of scoring shots and we were well beaten in the contest.\n\n\"There are still some things we can work on, and I think that's probably a positive for us.\"\n\nKey Event\n\nGrundy weighs in on concussion\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nThe Swans ruckman has left an interesting take on the concussion debate currently playing out across sport, following the head-clash injuries to opponents Ed Richards and Anthony Scott tonight.\n\nHe's told ABC Sport's Tim Hodges: \"Just the way we narrate the games in those sorts of contests, I'd like to see it less celebrated as courageous. Do you know what I mean? That sort of silly 'back with the flight' sort of stuff.\n\n\"As a spectator, even when I'm watching, I cringe a bit. It's hard to watch, isn't it? Whether's coaching, doing those J-shape short of marks... gone are the days, I'd like to think, where it's just this reckless, bull-at-a-gate type of action.\"\n\nKey Event\n\nBulldogs coach Luke Beveridge says he is pleased with his side's resolve\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nThe Bulldogs made a terrific fightback despite three game-ending injuries.\n\nBeveridge says he has taken plenty of heart out of the Bulldogs' performance.\n\n\"In the long run, I just think our players showed enormous character,\" Beveridge says.\n\n\"Our backline stayed on for the whole last half and Tim English did as well … all in all, there was great integrity in what the boys did.\n\n\"In my books, our players are winners tonight.\n\nKey Event\n\nBrodie Grundy says the coach was 'cool, calm and collected'\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nThe dressing room interviews were delayed as John Longmire called a team meeting straight after the singing of the song.\n\nPlenty of speculation that the coach was not impressed with the Swans' final quarter.\n\nBut ruck Brodie Grundy said the meeting was all about staying humble, after winning their 10th win in 11 matches.\n\n\"It was pretty cool, calm and collected to be honest,\" Grundy tells ABC Sport.\n\n\"On the ladder is really pleasing, where we are sitting.\"\n\n\"Full credit to the Dogs. They brought a really solid … pressure game of footy.\"\n\nHorse not happy?\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nSydney coach John Longmire has dragged the Swans players into a separate room after that win.\n\nTim Hodges reports Errol Gulden was pulled off a live interview by the media manager to get into the meeting.\n\n\"I think (Longmire) was in a rage. I think that's why they sang the song so subdued, because they knew the coach was filthy. Everyone's down here to celebrate but the players have been dragged into a room with John Longmire... I think it's getting rammed home that that last quarter was just not acceptable.\"\n\nCameron Ling: \"I always thought (Geelong premiership coach Mark)Bomber Thompson was at his most dangerous after we'd won a game...that wasn't quite where it needed to be.\"\n\nSome observations from our ABC Sport team\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nMarc Murphy: \"The Bulldogs have got enough talent in their team to trouble good sides. Their best is certainly good enough.\"\n\nCameron Ling: \"Occasionally we got to see Sydney's ball movement. At times when a team goes coast to coast and has brilliant ball use, it's not just necessarily the beautiful skills, it's the running patterns of players receiving the balls that make the kick more dangerous, their understanding where they have to all run means the ball use flows so well.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nIt's going to be a tough month for the Bulldogs even without the injuries in this game.\n\nThey face Collingwood, Brisbane and Fremantle before North Melbourne.\n\nThe Swans are up against Geelong, Adelaide and then the Giants again. It's hard to see them losing... but then, they lost to Richmond. This is why I stopped tipping a few seasons ago.\n\nKey Event\n\nFT: Sydney Swans 16.6 (102) defeat Western Bulldogs 12.16 (88)\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nThe Sydney Swans have improved to 10 wins and one loss through 11 rounds, defeating the Bulldogs at Docklands.\n\nChad Warner's four goals proved crucial for the Swans, who survived a late fightback from the Bulldogs.\n\nThe Bulldogs finished the match with two fit players on the bench, with injuries to Scott, Naughton and Richards.\n\nA reprieve for Sydney\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nHayden McLean kicks his second goal after a 50-metre penalty that will break Bulldogs hearts.\n\nAfter a turnover on centre-wing, McInenery kicks it to McLean on the 50 who marks and Vandemeer knocks it out of his hand.\n\nHere's how Cameron Ling saw it: \"Oh no. I thought that was almost simultaneous… that's just a slightly late spoil isn't it?\"\n\nSwans lead back out to 14.\n\nShades of Hawthorn last week?\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nThe Swans don't look interested in scoring right now, more focused on defending.\n\nCameron Ling: \"Four minutes is just too long to purely keep possession. If you're going to kick mark that's fine but keep moving it down the ground.\"\n\nTaylor Adams is off the field for the Swans\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nTo make matters worse for the Sydney Swans as they desperately hold on, Taylor Adams has gone down the tunnel.\n\nTim Hodges reported it for ABC Sport. No word on what the issue is.\n\nKey Event\n\nUgle-Hagen with another one!\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nThe dogs are dominating, but it's excruciating for fans: Ugle-Hagen misses a snap around the body, Daniel misses a shot after a great lunging mark.\n\nThey've halved the margin since Sydney got it to 30 points at the 10-minute mark, but they might regret these missed opportunities. but there's still time\n\nAs the clock ticks under five minutes to play Ugle-Hagen takes control, spinning away from some tackles and snapping his third goal.\n\nEight-point margin!\n\nDon't tune out yet, the Dogs are playing this out\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nA transition from defence starting with Jones sees Harvey Gallagher gather in the forward 50, straighten up and kick another one.\n\nThe margin is back to 17 points, as Gallagher heads to the bench as a reward.\n\nAs Cameron Ling says on ABC Sport: \"They're not dying wondering the Bulldogs. They're really digging in.\"\n\nAaron Francis is subbed out for the Swans and Matt Roberts comes in for the final nine minutes of game time.\n\nKey Event\n\nAnother classy finish from Riley Garcia\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nThe Bulldogs keep the ball movinng in their forward pocket through West and Daniel, the latter tapping the ball into Garcia's path.\n\nFrom about the same area where he kicked his first he snaps through his second. Nice little highlight from the out-of-contract Dog.\n\nAs an aside, the Bulldogs are dominating disposals tonight, and they have the highest average disposals per game of any team this season.\n\nThe Swans are seventh for disposals per game. But they're first for goals. This match is lining up neatly with the season stats.\n\nHeeney with a beauty\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nFrom a throw in, the ball spills to Isaac Heeney, and he hooks a right foot ball from the pocket right through the middle.\n\nThe Swans are motoring now, up by five goals.\n\nAnother score assist for Warner\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nA kick into Sydney's forward 50 goes off-hands into the corridor, into the hands of Warner.\n\nWe were all waiting to see him kick his fifth, but he unselfishly hands it off to Taylor Adams who runs into an open goal and converts.\n\nA few observations from ABC Sport's Marc Murphy: 'You remove Ed Richards, who was having a good game, and there's an inevitability the Swans are going to run them off the ground.'\n\nAnd Cameron Ling: 'Warner is amazing, 71 games and he's dominating the midfield.'\n\nJames Harmes gets one back for the Bulldogs\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\n\"It's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog\" said Mark Twain once.\n\nWe're going to see that theory tested now.\n\nHarmes kicks a goal, but they're down to two men on the bench as they try and rein in the remaining 19 points of Sydney's lead.\n\nChad Warner you ripper\n\nA\n\nBy Alex Darling\n\nLittle bit of indirect personal pride from me here.\n\nI used to work near the town of Nhill, western Victoria, where Chad Warner's dad Travis played football for local side the Tigers.\n\nWarner just had 10 disposals, two goals, two goal assists and three inside 50s in a quarter where the Swans took control.\n\nHe's just kicked his fourth goal to start the last quarter.\n\nThey breed them well in the Wimmera region.\n\nIncidentally, the last major footballer from Nhill was Jason McCartney, 182 games for the Pies, Crows and of course North Melbourne.\n\nKey Event\n\n3QT: Swans head into the final break with a 23-point lead\n\nM\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nThe Swans have opened up a gap which you feel may be enough.\n\nThe Bulldogs have been brave, but now have three players ruled out: Scott, Naughton and Richards.\n\nChad Warner was sensational in that third term.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT\n\nSports content to make you think... or allow you not to.
