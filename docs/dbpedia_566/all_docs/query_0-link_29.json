Reading and seeing people doing suicide everyday is very disturbing. This needs to get attention from our society. People are weak, they are not able to handle pressure, their expectation are making them miserable. One of thing i always focus on to talk to my team, friends, family are they in pressure and can i help them in any way to come out of it... We need to make our People Strong.... Would request everyone to suggest how we can bring this in mainstream. Loads of love. Note: If someone reading this and in any type pressure you can DM me #suicideprevention #suicideawareness #suicide\n\nIf you find yourself surrounded by individuals who thrive on drama, it's advisable to distance yourself from them, as their penchant for chaos can inadvertently involve you in their tumultuous narratives. People who revel in drama often create situations filled with tension, conflicts, and unnecessary complexity. Engaging with such individuals may lead to being entangled in their theatrical episodes, potentially causing stress and disrupting your peace of mind. Choosing to steer clear of these drama-centric circles enables you to maintain a more tranquil and harmonious existence, safeguarding your mental well-being from unnecessary complications. #DramaFreeLiving #ChoosePeace #MindfulConnections #AvoidTheChaos #TranquilMindset #PositiveConnections #PeacefulLiving #MindfulDetox #NoDramaZone #WellnessJourney\n\nThis year, practise mental clarity and strength. Before you lose your cool, think of the consequences. And yes, we know that anger is necessary sometimes. But before you actually get angry to a high stage, think of what is at stake and practice this method to cool down. We hope you have the best experience this year. . . . . #alcyonhomes #alcyonshortlets #angermanagementissues #angermanagementtherapy #angermanagement101 #mentalclarityandfocus"
