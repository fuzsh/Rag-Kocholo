        "text": "Mr. Paul Barry Davis, 65, passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday, January 17, 2024. He was born in Forsyth County on August 14, 1958 to Thomas Moody Davis, Sr. and Dollie Mae Davis. Paul graduated from Forbush High School. He was a member of Mt. Bethel Baptist Church. Paul was an avid sports fan. He especially loved playing golf, and watching football and basketball. As his children grew up, he spent lots of time coaching the various sports they each played. Paul was a volunteer firefighter for East Bend Fire Department for many years. More than anything, he loved his grandbabies so much. Everyone who had the privilege to know him will miss him very much.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by a special aunt, Nina Hutchens. He is survived by his children, Heather (Phillip) Davis McDowell, Evan (Angel) Davis, and Gracen Davis (Lane Snow); grandchildren, Davis McDowell, Story McDowell, Brynlee Davis, Judah Davis, and one precious grandbaby on the way; and brothers, Terry (Sarah) Davis and Tom (Cindy) Davis.\n\nThe family will receive friends from 11:00 am to 12:00 pm on Saturday, January 20, 2024 at Gentry Family Funeral Service in East Bend. A memorial service will follow at 12:00 pm in the chapel with Pastor Chris Hauser officiating. Gentry Family Funeral Service of East Bend is serving the Davis family."
