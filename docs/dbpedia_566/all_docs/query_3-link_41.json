        "text": "Barry Davies has began to trend online after his fellow commentator John Motson sadly passed away at the age of 77.\n\nThe pair were regarded as the two greatest commentators around during their time working for the BBC – their iconic tones became synonymous with some of football’s greatest moments.\n\nSo, what does Davies do now? And what was his last commentary role? Let’s take a look…\n\nWell, Davies last took to the microphone in April 2019 when he commentated on the Boat Race for the BBC-produced “World Feed” – however, it was only available to overseas audiences and not those in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 85-year-old’s last commentary role for the BBC’s domestic audience came in July 2018 when he covered the Mixed Doubles Final.\n\nIt saw Alexander Peya and Nicole Melichar win the title, defeating Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka.\n\nDavies has since retired from commentary, and while we don’t exactly have a tracking device on him to examine his every move nowadays, he has previously given a few hints as to how he would be spending his retirement.\n\nBack in 2011, Davies revealed that he enjoys playing golf and spending time with his family – specifically his grandchildren – in his spare time.\n\nWhen asked by the Telegraph in 2018 what he plans to do in his retirement, Davies added: “If you’ve got any good ideas can you send me a postcard? I don’t know is the answer. My children have produced six grandchildren for us and they all live near where I live in Barnes.\n\n“I’ll probably try to catch up with some reading, which I haven’t done enough of. I often think I’m not particularly well-read. At least I seem to have fooled the people some of the time.”\n\nWhich team does Barry Davies support?\n\nDavies is a fan of Windsor & Eton.\n\nSadly, the non-league side dissolved back in 2012 due to mounting debts, but have since reformed as Windsor FC.\n\nWhen did Barry Davies retire?\n\nDavies retired in 2004 following a hugely successful career covering athletics, badminton, football, tennis and water skiing.\n\nHopefully, one of the BBC’s iconic Big Two is enjoying himself in his retirement, and looks back fondly on what was a memorable career in sport."
