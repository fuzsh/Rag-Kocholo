Born on January 21, 1956, in Wareham, Massachusetts, Davis developed a love for acting at a young age. She graduated with a degree in drama from Boston University in 1979, after which she moved to New York to pursue a career in modeling. Her breakthrough in acting came when she was cast in the film Tootsie (1982). Davis' performance in this film set the stage for a successful acting career. Davis' acting prowess has earned her several prestigious awards and nominations. In 1988, she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Accidental Tourist. Another notable performance was her portrayal of Thelma in the cult classic Thelma & Louise (1991), for which she got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

Raised in a single-parent household after her parents' divorce, she developed a love for theater early in life. Davis moved to New York City to study at John Murray Anderson's Dramatic School. Her big break came when she landed a role in the Broadway play Broken Dishes in 1929, which paved the way for her entry into the world of cinema. Davis's film career took off with her role in The Man Who Played God in 1932. She went on to redefine the parameters for female actors in Hollywood with her choice of complex, challenging roles that defied gender stereotypes. Among her most acclaimed performances were those in Of Human Bondage (1934) and Dangerous (1935), the latter of which won her the first of two Academy Awards.

Known for his innovation and artistic vision, Davis shaped the course of jazz over his five-decade-long career, blending elements of rock, classical music, and funk into his compositions. Davis, a trumpeter, bandleader, and composer, is famed for his unique, muted style that revolutionized the genre by introducing modal playing‚Äîa stark contrast to the predominant bebop style of the 1940s. Davis' career commenced at the age of 18 when he moved to New York City to study at the Julliard School of Music, but soon dropped out to play professionally. He joined Charlie Parker's quintet, marking his emergence in the bebop scene. In 1959, Davis' album Kind of Blue was released, which is regarded as one of the most influential jazz albums ever recorded. The album introduced modal jazz improvising on a series of scales or modes rather than chord progressions to a broader audience. Throughout his career, Davis battled personal demons including drug addiction, yet he continually evolved his musical style. In the late 1960s, he pioneered jazz-rock fusion with the album Bitches Brew. The 1980s saw Davis incorporating hip-hop elements into his music, further showcasing his versatility and willingness to explore. Davis passed away in 1991, leaving behind an immense body of work that continues to influence generations of musicians. His legacy is encapsulated not only in the Grammy Awards, the Miles Davis Award at the Montreal Jazz Festival, and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but also in his enduring influence on the trajectory of jazz and popular music."
