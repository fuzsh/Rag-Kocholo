        "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla. â€” Christopher Davis, the man charged with killing his boyfriend Barry Schmalbach in Cape Coral last summer, is finally back in Southwest Florida and made his first court appearance Thursday morning.\n\n\"Honestly shock...it brings some sort of relief,\" Schmalbach's sister Emily Scaletta said about Davis' court appearance.\n\nFind more information on the case here.\n\nScaletta described her feelings, \"Definitely re-hitting again because, especially with one year. It's in a few weeks, and it's crazy to think that time has moved so fast and so slow.\"\n\nLast July, Scaletta's 56-year-old brother Barry Schmalbach disappeared from Cape Coral.\n\nOne month later, Schmalbach's boyfriend Davis was arrested and booked in the Lee County Jail on a warrant from South Carolina.\n\nIt wasn't until January that he was charged for Schmalbach's murder, tampering with the evidence and several counts of fraudulent use of personal identification of a deceased individual.\n\nThis week, South Carolina's governor and Governor DeSantis worked out a way to bring Davis back to Southwest Florida for court.\n\n\"I'm fearing for my life,\" Davis said Thursday morning in his hearing.\n\nHe complained about his treatment in jail and said he's been held against his will in a shower.\n\nThe judge chose to roll over the pretrial hearing for 24 hours to consider holding Davis without bond before his trial after the request from the State Attorney lawyer.\n\nHowever, Scaletta knows it may be a while before she gets the answers she wants.\n\nShe said, \"It's the start of a long journey, and we know that this is just the beginning.\"\n\nMost of all, they want to lay Schmalbach to rest."
