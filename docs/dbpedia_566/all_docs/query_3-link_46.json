        "text": "About\n\nBarryâ€™s experience at being a results-oriented mediator comes from decades of having litigated and serving as lead trial counsel to both plaintiffs and defendants in hundreds of complex construction and commercial disputes, insurance coverage and bad faith cases, and high-profile personal injury and wrongful death matters. He and his team devised and negotiated the very creative $103.5M settlement involving more than 40 parties and insurers in the mass tort FIU Bridge Collapse litigation, where he served as lead counsel for the bridge designer.\n\nBarry has been a Florida Bar Board Certified Civil Trial lawyer since 1989, was elected by his peers as a Super Lawyer and holds a Martindale-Hubbell AV Preeminent rating. He began his own law firm with a few partners more than 25 years ago and served as its managing partner while it grew to 30 lawyers. It was eventually acquired by an international law firm where he continued to serve as managing partner. For more than 20 years, Barry was also outside U.S. general counsel and on the U.S. Board of Directors of a major multinational construction company. As an adjunct professor of law for several years, Barry taught classes in settlement negotiation and was trial team coach.\n\nProfessional Education and Qualifications\n\nFlorida Supreme Court Certified Circuit Civil Mediator\n\nCertified U.S. District Court Mediator, Southern District of Florida\n\nJ.D., University of Florida College of Law\n\nB.S., University of Florida\n\nFlorida Blue Key\n\nPresident, Tau Epsilon Phi\n\nBar Admissions and Professional Memberships\n\nFlorida Academy of Professional Mediators\n\nUSDC Advisory Committee Member to the Chief Judge for Court Annexed Mediation\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\nU.S. Courts of Appeals for the 5th and 11th Circuits\n\nAll Federal and State Courts in Florida\n\nPractice Areas\n\nIncluding, but not limited to:"
