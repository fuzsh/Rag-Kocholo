        "text": "Australian rules footballer (1943–2024)\n\nAustralian rules footballer\n\nBarry Davis (15 September 1943 – 22 May 2024) was an Australian rules footballer who played in the Victorian Football League (VFL) with Essendon and North Melbourne, before coaching his original team between 1978 and 1980. He was a three-time premiership player.\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the summer of 1961, Barry Davis and a school friend were asked to train with Essendon in a bid to play in the Under-19s. Davis impressed observers and he was asked to participate in pre-season practice matches that included players from the main list. He played in the Reserves for round 1 of the 1961 season. Recruited from Essendon High School, Davis made his debut with Essendon Football Club in the VFL in the second round of 1961; Davis played off the half-back line and was quite a prolific ball-gathering player. Davis never played with the under-19s even though he was eligible.[1]\n\nDavis went on to play 218 games and kick 65 goals for the club, winning the Bombers' best and fairest award three times – in 1968, 1969 and 1971. He captained the side in 1970 and 1971, and he also played in the team premierships in 1962 and 1965. He was named in Essendon's official 'Team of the Twentieth Century'.[2]\n\nMoving to North in 1973 under the VFL's short-lived \"10-year rule\", which allowed players with ten years' service at one club to move to another club without a clearance,[3] Davis won North Melbourne's best and fairest in his first year at North. He went on to captain the Roos' first-ever premiership side in 1975, his final VFL season. He had played 71 games and kicked 54 goals for North before retiring. He was also named in North Melbourne's Team of the Century.[4]\n\nCoaching career\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis coached his original club Essendon as senior coach from 1978 to 1980; he replaced Bill Stephen, who was sacked as Essendon Football Club senior coach at the end of the 1977 season.[5] Davis coached Essendon with a 30-win, 36-loss and 1-draw record.[6] He resigned at the end of the 1980 season because Essendon under Davis did not make the top five on the ladder and therefore missed out of the finals.[7] He then made way for Kevin Sheedy, who replaced Davis as Essendon Football Club senior coach and coached the club until the end of the 2007 season, for a record total of 27 years.[8][9]\n\nChampions of Essendon\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2002, an Essendon panel ranked him at 15 in their Champions of Essendon list of the 25 greatest players ever to have played for Essendon.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis died on 22 May 2024, at the age of 80.[10]\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\n[11]\n\nLegend\n\nG\n\nGoals\n\nK\n\nKicks\n\nD\n\nDisposals\n\nT\n\nTackles\n\nB\n\nBehinds\n\nH\n\nHandballs\n\nM\n\nMarks\n\n#\n\nPlayed in that season's\n\npremiership team\n\nLed the league after finals only\n\nSeason Team No. Games Totals Averages (per game) G B K H D M T G B K H D M T 1961 Essendon 32 17 14 — — — — — — 0.8 — — — — — — 1962# Essendon 32 17 0 — — — — — — 0 — — — — — — 1963 Essendon 32 18 1 — — — — — — 0.1 — — — — — — 1964 Essendon 32 16 0 — — — — — — 0.0 — — — — — — 1965# Essendon 32 12 0 0 126 23 149 61 — 0.0 0.0 10.5 1.9 12.4 5.1 — 1966 Essendon 32 20 1 2 275 30 305 82 — 0.1 0.1 13.8 1.5 15.3 4.1 — 1967 Essendon 32 17 0 0 292 32 324 72 — 0.0 0.0 17.2 1.9 19.1 4.2 — 1968 Essendon 32 22 1 8 394 87 481 136 — 0.0 0.4 17.9 4.0 21.9 6.2 — 1969 Essendon 32 19 18 18 446 90 536 134 — 0.9 0.9 23.5 4.7 28.2 7.1 — 1970 Essendon 32 19 17 23 382 85 467 101 — 0.9 1.2 20.1 4.5 24.6 5.3 — 1971 Essendon 32 19 11 23 400 62 462 132 — 0.6 1.2 21.1 3.3 24.3 6.9 — 1972 Essendon 32 22 2 2 376 34 410 106 — 0.1 0.1 17.1 1.5 18.6 4.8 — 1973 North Melbourne 32 21 19 19 466 67 533 89 — 0.9 0.9 22.2 3.2 25.4 4.2 — 1974 North Melbourne 32 24 21 16 461 92 553 113 — 0.9 0.7 19.2 3.8 23.0 4.7 — 1975# North Melbourne 32 26 14 12 503 106 609 102 — 0.5 0.5 20.1 4.2 24.4 4.1 — Career 289 119 123 4121 708 4829 1128 — 0.4 0.6 18.7 3.2 22.0 5.1 —\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1965–66 Victorian District Cricket final\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
