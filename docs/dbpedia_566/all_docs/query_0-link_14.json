        "text": "Hey all, I knew Barry outside of football so wanted to share some memories of someone who was a great man.\n\nBarry in his later years loved to play and watch tennis. He was always around local tennis clubs in the Essendon area and always up for a chat. He was always generous with his time as well. From what he said, he always seemed to call into the club and they treated him as a former great very well. He loved Essendon and they loved him back.\n\nOne of the stories I remember was one of his trips representing Victoria against SA in State of Origin. He had always heard stories of what Tommy Haffey was like as a coach and was told to try and avoid him where possible. As it turns out on this particular trip, he was late so when he finally got on the coach the only seat left was next to Tommy. He recalled how scared he was when Tommy didn’t say a word the first half of the trip. After what seemed like an eternity in true Barry style he was the 1st to say something and much to Barry’s delight Tommy answered and actually talked to him the rest of the way. Barry recalls how happy was that he had broken down Tommy Haffey. After they arrived and checked in to the hotel they went for a training run. Tommy addressed the team and they set off on a light job. Just as they were about to set off Tommy told Barry to wait. He then proceeded to make Barry do sprints because he was late . So he never really did break down Tommy. He represented Victoria 11 times I think with Tommy his coach multiple times. Barry was never late again .\n\nIn true Barry style he did also say one day with a cheeky grin that he made Sheeds as coach. Without him setting up Essendon for success, Sheeds would never have been the coach that he turned out to be .\n\nVale Barry, you were a great man and very sad to hear of your passing last night.\n\nTigs\n\nA little known fact about Barry below - he found a bone linked to some murders going back 40 odd years.\n\nA CRANBOURNE woman is pleading for public help to solve the Tynong North murders 35 years after the discovery of three bodies dumped in bushland.\n\nCheryl Goldsworthy was best friends with Catherine Headland, 14, whose skeletal remains were found along with those of two other victims — Ann-Marie Sargent, 18, and Bertha Miller, 75 — at a secluded bush track off Brew Rd on December 6, 1980.\n\nThe gruesome discovery was made by three men who were dumping lamb innards at an old sand quarry.\n\nLast month marked a traumatic anniversary for the pair, who met when they were in primary school in Berwick and walked to high school together most days.\n\nMs Goldsworthy, 48, said the murderer — who could be one of Victoria’s worst serial killers — might still be living out their days and she wants closure and justice served.\n\n“Someone knows something,” she said.\n\nAbout two years later on February 3, 1983, more human remains were found in Tynong North scrubland. A punctured trailer tyre led two men to pull in to an area opposite a truck stop on the Princes Highway.\n\nOne of the men, former VFL champion Barry Davis, got out to stretch his legs. He spotted a bone sticking out of the scrubland around 50m from the busy road and decided to take it to the Warragul Police Station.\n\nThe bone was sent to the Melbourne Coroners’ Court where it was confirmed to be human.\n\nA search of the area unearthed the bones from a badly decomposed body. The bones were 34-year-old mother-of-two Narumol Stephenson. She disappeared on November 30, 1980, from Brunswick.\n\nThe murders and those of two other women Allison Rooke and Joy Summers in Frankston in the early ‘80s, remain unsolved and are known as the Tynong North and Frankston killings.\n\nAllison Rooke, 59, disappeared on May 30, 1980. She had told neighbours she was taking a bus to Frankston Shopping Centre. The buses travelled along the Frankston-Dandenong Rd, which is where Mrs Rooke was waiting.\n\nOn July 5, five weeks later, a man walking his dogs found Mrs Rooke’s naked body in a shallow grave, partially hidden by scrubland, on McClelland Drive in Frankston.\n\nOn October, 9, 1981, Joy Summers, 55, was waiting for a bus on Frankston-Dandenong Rd when she too vanished. It was the same stretch of road where Allison Rooke had been waiting when she met her fate. Ms Summers naked body was found in Skye Rd scrubland six weeks later.\n\nAfter exhaustive efforts police had named a Frankston North man who had knowledge of the bushland area as a prime suspect but he was never charged.\n\nVictoria Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sharon Darcy said a review of all cold-case homicides was going ahead and police could not respond to media inquiries on the Tynong North murders.\n\n“If anyone knows anything, it is time to say so,” — Cheryl Goldsworthy\n\nMs Goldsworthy said she thought of Catherine’s family often. “This is something you can never get over,” she said. “I have seen the family over the years and introduced my girls but I’ve always thought it must be so hard for them to see me all grown up with children of my own.”\n\nMs Goldsworthy said Catherine’s disappearance and murder changed her life for ever. “We always thought we were safe. I no longer felt safe.”\n\nA mother of two daughters, Ms Goldsworthy said her children missed out on the freedom she had as a teen because she was too scared to let them go anywhere by themselves.\n\n“I think the biggest impact of Catherine’s murder was how it affected me with raising my girls,” Ms Goldsworthy said.\n\n“That is why they weren’t allowed to catch public transport anywhere, that is why they weren’t allowed out with their friends. They weren’t allowed go anywhere without an adult basically.”\n\nMs Goldsworthy, who lives in Cranbourne, said she still held hope that the murders could be solved.\n\nhe said Catherine’s death had been especially hard for John McManus, whose life had been haunted by “what ifs”.\n\nUnwell on the day Catherine vanished, he waved goodbye to her as she walked to the bus stop to get to her part-time supermarket job at Fountain Gate Shopping Centre.\n\nThe constant thoughts of “If only someone had been with her” have plagued the friends.\n\nMr McManus said he would always miss Catherine.\n\n“It is hard and still no justice or closure,” he said. “I still think about her each day. Someone knows who did it.”\n\nThere is a memorial to Catherine at Akoonah Park, a place the friends from Berwick High School would often gather to talk and listen to music.\n\n“The memorial is a place we can all go to feel close to Catherine in the surroundings we all loved,” Ms Goldsworthy said.\n\nA little known fact about Barry below - he found a bone linked to some murders going back 40 odd years.\n\nA CRANBOURNE woman is pleading for public help to solve the Tynong North murders 35 years after the discovery of three bodies dumped in bushland.\n\nCheryl Goldsworthy was best friends with Catherine Headland, 14, whose skeletal remains were found along with those of two other victims — Ann-Marie Sargent, 18, and Bertha Miller, 75 — at a secluded bush track off Brew Rd on December 6, 1980.\n\nThe gruesome discovery was made by three men who were dumping lamb innards at an old sand quarry.\n\nLast month marked a traumatic anniversary for the pair, who met when they were in primary school in Berwick and walked to high school together most days.\n\nMs Goldsworthy, 48, said the murderer — who could be one of Victoria’s worst serial killers — might still be living out their days and she wants closure and justice served.\n\n“Someone knows something,” she said.\n\nAbout two years later on February 3, 1983, more human remains were found in Tynong North scrubland.

So eerie to think this serial killer is still out there."
