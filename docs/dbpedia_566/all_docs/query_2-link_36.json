Her fame in so many fields overshadowed her real talent as one of our greatest comedic actors, a loving mother, an amazing homemaker, and one of the world’s best cooks. I will miss her dearly and hope that she is now out of pain and at peace.\"\n\nThe two were friends for more than 40 years and were neighbors in the Palm Springs area.

I had the pleasure of getting to know her. She is a force, she is groundbreaking, she is love.\"\n\nShe continued, \"She was married to her soulmate (and) best friend … She's a family person. She's about research and fighting for what she believes in when that takes tremendous courage and it's not popular. Wow. I really, really, really had so much respect for her.\"\n\n\"What a wonderful person,\" Frankel concluded. \"I'm so, so sorry. Sorry to Suzanne's family. What a tremendous loss on such a week of tremendous loss.\"\n\n'A superb talent': Piper Laurie, Oscar-nominated 'Carrie' and 'The Hustlers' star, dies at 91\n\nComedian and radio personality Adam Carolla wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that he was \"devastated to hear\" Somers had died. \"A true icon and overall amazing human being.

According to her publicist, a private family burial for Somers will take place this week and a memorial will be held in November, People reported.\n\nSuzanne Somers' husband Alan Hamel wrote poem before her death\n\nSomers' husband wrote her a poem the day before her death, according to Hay, per People.\n\nThe Canadian entertainer and movie producer, 87, wrote the poem for Somers' birthday but decided to give it to her early. \"She read the poem and went to bed and later died peacefully in her sleep,\" said Hay.\n\nPeople published the poem in full, written in all caps, which reads, in part: \"LOVE I USE IT EVERY DAY, SOMETIMES SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. I USE IT AT THE END OF EMAILS TO MY LOVING FAMILY. I EVEN USE IT IN EMAILS TO CLOSE FRIENDS. I USE IT WHEN I'M LEAVING THE HOUSE.\n\n\"I'M BACK TO FEELINGS. THERE ARE NO WORDS. THERE ARE NO ACTIONS. NO PROMISES. NO DECLARATIONS,\" Hamel concluded. \"EVEN THE GREEN SHADED SCHOLARS OF THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS HAVE SPENT 150 YEARS AND STILL HAVE FAILED TO COME UP WITH THAT ONE WORD. SO I WILL CALL IT, 'US', UNIQUELY, MAGICALLY, INDESCRIBABLY WONDERFUL 'US.'\"\n\nThe couple was married for 46 years, after dating for a decade."
