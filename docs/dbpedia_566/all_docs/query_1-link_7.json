        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- Monday afternoon, 42-year-old Cedric Berry of Minneapolis and 42-year-old Berry Davis of Brooklyn Park both received life sentences without parole.\n\nIn June, both men were found guilty of kidnapping and shooting 28-year-old Monique Baugh.\n\nBaugh's family addressed the court during victim impact statements.\n\n\"She was so special to all of us. She was kind, sweet, funny. Her laugh was contagious,\" said Beth Armanini, speaking on behalf of Baugh's father.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2019, Baugh, a realtor, thought she was meeting a client at a house in Maple Grove. But once there she was kidnapped and forced into a Uhaul. Hours later she was found shot to death in a Minneapolis alleyway.\n\n\"On December 30, 2019, I said good night and I love you to my daughter Monique Baugh for the last time,\" said Wanda Williams Baugh, Monique's mother.\n\nIn a tense and emotional courtroom, Williams Baugh talked about how much her daughter loved being a mother to her two girls.\n\n\"They have to take my word for it because she's not here to tell them herself and I know she would tell them every single day,\" said Williams Baugh. \"Both of her girls, they say good night to her, too, and they kiss and hug her picture.\"\n\nWilliams Baugh asked Judge Peter Cahill to give Berry and Davis life without parole, which he did. Before the sentencing both defendants maintained their innocence.\n\n\"My condolences to the Baugh family. I hate you guys had to go through this and I will always pray that the truth comes out,\" said Berry.\n\n\"Ms. Baugh, I hope she gets relief. Today she didn't get it, because justice wasn't served,\" said Davis.\n\nAfter court, Williams Baugh called the comments from the defendants ridiculous and self-serving. She thanked prosecutors and Minneapolis police for putting her daughters' killers behind bars.\n\n\"They will spend the rest of their lives in jail and they won't have an opportunity to do this to anyone else's mother, loved one ever again,\" said Williams Baugh.\n\nBoth men were also found guilty of shooting Baugh's boyfriend in front of his daughters. He survived.\n\nTwo other suspects, 29-year-old Elsa Segura of Fridley and 36-year-old Lyndon Wiggins of Minneapolis, face the same charges as Berry and Davis."
