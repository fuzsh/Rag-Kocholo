        "text": "It is with great sadness the Davies family announces the death of Barry Davies in the palliative care unit in the Peterborough Regional Hospital on July 2, 2024 at the age of 82.\n\nBarry was preceded in death by his parents Ben and Beulah Davies. He will be lovingly remembered by all who knew him, but particularly by Fran, his wife and partner of 32 years, his loving children, Andrea Lack (Jay) and Jill Voytek (Steve), grandchildren Ben, Sam, Davis & Hudson and brother Bryan (Andra). Barry loved his children dearly and cherished every moment he spent with his four grandchildren.\n\nBarry received a Bachelor of Metallurgical Engineering from the University of Toronto in 1966 and worked as an executive in the mining and manufacturing industry in Ontario for almost 40 years. He was active in a number of professional and business organizations and ended his career as the President of Fisher Gauge Ltd.\n\nBarry & Fran retired to Mississagua Lake in 2001, where they enjoyed the companionship of close friends and extended family members (Canadian, American and British) and spent time fishing, camping and playing chess. They were fortunate to be able to travel extensively around the world and enjoyed winters in their Ft. Myers condo.\n\nThe family is grateful for the exceptional care and compassion shown to Barry by Dr. Butan, Dr. Binette and Dr. Hartleib over the past four years. They would also like to recognize the excellent support provided by the staff at the Peterborough Regional Health Centre.\n\nOn Saturday, July 13, 2024 relatives and friends are invited for a Celebration of Life event. Visitation will be from 1pm until the time of the celebration of Barryâ€™s life at 2pm at Highland Park Funeral Centre, 2510 Bensfort Road, in Peterborough.
