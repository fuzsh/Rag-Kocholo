        "text": "Content provided by UNLV\n\nLAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - The UNLV football team, fighting through the heart of its first week of preseason camp, enjoyed a cool-down or sorts on Tuesday by moving practice inside The Raiders Headquarters and Intermountain Health Performance Center’s 150,000-square-foot indoor fieldhouse.\n\nAfter Raiders team president Sandra Douglass Morgan welcomed the squad, the Rebels held a two-hour practice, its fifth of camp, inside the state-of-the-art facility thanks to the ongoing relationship between UNLV and the fabled NFL franchise. The Rebels and Raiders, of course, share a home at Allegiant Stadium for games each fall and UNLV’s Team Room at the Fertitta Football Complex on campus is named after the Raiders’ legendary founder Al Davis.\n\n“On behalf of UNLV Athletics, we’d like to thank Mark Davis and Sandra Douglass Morgan and her staff for allowing the Rebels to get out of the heat and practice inside and get some good, solid work in before the season,” said Director of Athletics Erick Harper. “The Raiders are a great organization and very supportive of UNLV Athletics and we can’t thank them enough for our valued partnership.”\n\nSecond-year UNLV Head Coach Barry Odom addressed the media on the turf after the lively session concluded.\n\n“It is a special thing for us to have this working relationship with the Raiders, Sandra Douglass Morgan and the Davis Family, and we are so grateful that our kids have this opportunity,” said Odom. “I thought it was a very good practice and our kids are pouring into the process and we’re excited about that. Because of the Raiders, it was a little change of scenery and a game changer for us and we’re so thankful.\n\n“Through five really pretty strenuous practices. I think our guys have risen to the occasion every day. That’s the sign of a mature team and I thought we practiced well and practiced smart together.”\n\nThe Rebels will kick off their 57th season of football on August 31 by heading to Big 12 Conference member Houston at 4 p.m. PT on FS1 in the first of a school-record 11 national TV games. The home opener comes one week later when Utah Tech comes to Allegiant Stadium for a noon kickoff on September 7.\n\nSeason tickets, three-game mini-plans and single-game tickets for the six-game 2024 home schedule are available now by visiting unlvtickets.com or calling (702) 739-FANS (3267). For information on VIP premium club seats or suites at Allegiant Stadium, contact the Premium Sales office at premiumseating@unlv.edu or by calling (702) 895-0292."
