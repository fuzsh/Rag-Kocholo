        "text": "His was the first number I had sewn onto my first Essendon jumper in 1970\n\nReally sad news, the passing of a legend.\n\nVale Barry Davis. 32\n\nFollow the link for a 17 minute interview\n\nEssendon is saddened to hear of the passing of club champion Barry Davis at the age of 80.\n\nHailing from the Essendon area, Davis began a stellar playing career with the Bombers in 1961, playing an integral role in the 1962 and 1965 Premiership teams as a star half back flanker.\n\nThrough the late 1960’s and early ‘70’s, Davis continued to flourish in the red and black, claiming three Crichton Medals in 1968, ’69 and ’71. He was named Essendon Captain in 1970, holding the position for two seasons.\n\nIn 1973, Davis departed for North Melbourne, where he won another club best and fairest in his first season before leading the club to its first ever VFL Premiership as Captain in 1975, his final game as a player.\n\nFrom his 289-game playing career, Davis represented Essendon 218 times, booting 65 goals – in that time, he represented Victoria every year from 1967-’72 and was twice runner-up in the Brownlow Medal (1969, ’71).\n\nDavis moved back to Essendon as its Senior Coach from 1978-’80, where he coached 67 games in total for the club. In 1982, he came back for a stint to assist with the club’s under-19’s program.\n\nOn August 30, 2002, Davis’ standing at the Bombers was recognised when he was listed at No.15 in the esteemed ‘Champions of Essendon’ group, commemorating the 25 greatest players in the club’s history.\n\nA life member of both Essendon and North Melbourne, Davis was named in the Team of the Century for both clubs, on the half back flank in the Bombers’ line-up.\n\nAleady a member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame (having been inducted in 1997), Davis was also inducted as a Legend in the EFC Hall of Fame in 2006, one of the club’s greatest honours.\n\n“Barry Davis was not only a great of our football club, but of Australian football more broadly,” Essendon CEO Craig Vozzo said.\n\n“His impact at both Essendon and North Melbourne was enormous and he will always be remembered and celebrated. His position as a Hall of Fame Legend and life member shows the high esteem he’s held in by our club.\n\n“When Essendon people think of Barry, they will remember him both as a champion player and true gentleman.\n\n“Everyone involved with Essendon send their thoughts to Barry’s family and friends during this difficult time.”"
