        "text": "The Crimson Tide continues to get preseason recognition, as two running backs have been nominated to the 2024 Doak Walker Award Watchlist. This award highlights the best running back in college football.\n\nTo view the full list of candidates, click here:\n\nJam Miller will enter this season as a junior for the Crimson Tide. Last year, Miller rushed for 201 yards and a touchdown on 41 attempts. Since joining the Crimson Tide, he has accumulated 424 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns on 74 attempts, along with 72 receiving yards and a touchdown on 5 receptions. Expectations are high for Miller to elevate his performance this season.\n\nJustice Haynes will enter his sophomore season for Alabama. The former five-star recruit rushed for 1,528 yards and 19 touchdowns on 121 carries, averaging 12.6 yards per carry. Last year, Haynes saw limited action, rushing for 168 yards and two touchdowns on 25 attempts. A breakout year is expected for Haynes.\n\nThe Doak Walker Award is named after Doak Walker. This award was created in 1989.\n\nWalker exemplified leadership, sportsmanship, and academic and athletic success during his remarkable tenure at SMU in the late 1940s. Known as \"the Doaker,\" Walker was a national phenomenon, earning All-America accolades in 1947, 1948, and 1949 and winning the Heisman Trophy in 1948. His abilities on the field included punting, returning punts and kickoffs, and kicking extra points. Due to his popularity, SMU relocated their home games to an expanded Cotton Bowl, which later honored him with a plaque reading, \"The Cotton Bowl, the House that Doak Built.\"\n\nWalker joined the Detroit Lions after graduating in 1950 and led the NFL in scoring as a rookie. He helped the Lions secure NFL championships in 1952 and 1953 and was named All-Pro four times. Walker was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986. Known for his sportsmanship and versatility, his legacy is honored by the retirement of his jersey number 37 at SMU, the only number retired in the school's history.\n\nAlabama's 2024 season begins on August 31st at home against Western Kentucky. The Crimson Tide will start their first season under Kalen DeBeoer, marking the end of Nick Saban's tenure, which began in 2007.\n\nChase Brumfield is the morning producer and writer for Tide 100.9. He is currently a senior studying communications at Mississippi State University.
