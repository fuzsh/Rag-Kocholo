        "text": "Every time the Super Eagles announce changes to their backroom staff, one question often runs through the minds of everyone: Who is Nigeria coach?\n\nFootball managers are not all cut from the same cloth, but the sole element that binds them is their love for the game. Their passion.\n\nThe freedom to be expressive, to convey a range of personalities, and that burning desire to perform at one’s highest potential opens the door for role advancements and the ability to mesh together great skills where it matters most – in between those white lines.\n\nThe significance of a coach in a national football team cannot be overstated, as they play a pivotal role in shaping the team's performance and strategies on the field.\n\nWho is Nigeria coach?\n\nAs it stands, Nigeria has no substantive head coach.\n\nFormer Ajax and Mallorca winger Finidi George was handed the reins initially on an interim basis in March, managing the Super Eagles in friendlies against the Black Stars of Ghana and the Eagles of Mali.\n\nAfter both friendlies, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) publicly advertised the vacant national team coaching job and called on managers interested in becoming the next Super Eagles coach to apply.\n\nWith the likes of Daniel Amokachi, Emmanuel Amuneke, Antonio Conceicao and Michael Nsien throwing their hat in the ring, the job ultimately went to Finidi George.\n\nFinidi, however, got off to a disastrous start, drawing at home against South Africa before losing on the road to relative minnows Benin Republic.\n\nThis latter result, as well as the precarious position into which it placed the Super Eagles, convinced the NFF to actively begin the search for an expatriate Technical Adviser, a decision that forced Finidi to resign his role after only two competitive matches in charge.\n\nWho are the leading candidates to be the new Nigeria coach?\n\nFollowing the resignation of Finidi George, rumours have been swirling about who will be the new Nigeria coach.\n\nTo this effect, several names have surfaced across the media space, and most of these are foreign coaches. Let's take a look at some of the individuals who have been tipped to take over the affairs of the Super Eagles.\n\nAntónio Conceição (Portugal)\n\nThere were media reports suggesting that the NFF made Antônio Conceição one of their main targets to fill the void left by Finidi’s departure in June.\n\nThe former head coach of Cameroon was initially tipped to take over from José Peseiro, but the NFF chose a local coach instead.\n\nConceição has been out of work since leaving the Cameroon job in 2022. He was reportedly interested in returning to Cameroon but missed out on the position.\n\nThe 62-year-old has significant experience in African football, having guided Cameroon to a third-place finish at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHowever, despite the rumours from various media outlets, the Nigeria Football Federal (NFF) never officially made the announcement.\n\nHerve Renard (France)\n\nFormer AFCON-winning coach of Ivory Coast, Hervé Renard, who currently manages the French women's national team, was also touted as a possible successor to Finidi George after talks of Conceição fizzled out.\n\nHowever, rumours circulated that Renard had fallen out of favour with the NFF for financial reasons. According to reports, the coach requested a monthly salary of $180,000, an amount far too excessive for Nigeria's football governing body to afford.\n\nJosé Peseiro (Portugal)\n\nWith talk of Herve Renard effectively out of the way, José Peseiro was tipped to return as Nigeria's national team coach.\n\nThe Portuguese led Nigeria to the final of the 2024 AFCON in Ivory Coast where the team narrowly lost 2-1 to the Elephants.\n\nSince he vacated his role at the expiration of his contract in February, the Super Eagles have suffered greatly and are in danger of not qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nCalls were made by concerned fans for the NFF to bring back Peseiro in a bid to salvage the country's World Cup hopes. But it remains to be seen how this will turn out in the coming weeks, especially now that three different names have been shortlisted in July for vetting by the executive committee of the NFF.\n\nWho are the three coaches recently shortlisted for the Super Eagles job?\n\nAccording to reports, three coaches have been nominated for the Super Eagles job.\n\nEric Chelle (Mali)\n\nEric Chelle was the head coach of Mali's national football team, but he stepped down from his role due to the challenges surrounding the political situation in the country.\n\nAs a free agent, he has become one of three coaches whose names have been submitted by the NFF technical committee as potential replacements for Finidi.\n\nBut while this is a developing story, reports coming from Mali suggest that the Military Junta is planning to bring him back to oversee the Eagles' passage through the 2026 World Cup and 2025 AFCON qualifiers.\n\nBorn in Ivory Coast to a French father and a Malian mother, Chelle made five appearances as a centre-back for the Mali national team.\n\nHe led the Eagles to the quarterfinals of the 2024 AFCON where they bowed out at the hands of eventual winners Ivory Coast. Chelle was in charge when Mali defeated the Super Eagles 2-0 in an international friendly in March.\n\nSteve McClaren (England)\n\nFormer England coach Steve McClaren is reportedly one of the three coaches shortlisted in July by the NFF technical committee for consideration by the executive committee as the next Eagles tactician.\n\nMcClaren is currently an assistant coach with Premier League outfit Manchester United, a role he has occupied on several occasions, including during the era of Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nHowever, landing this candidate as Nigeria's coach will not be an easy feat, especially considering the role he occupies for the Red Devils and the financial demands he will likely negotiate for in his contract.\n\nIn addition to this, the former Eredivisie winner with FC Twente has not previously worked in Africa.\n\nTom Saintfiet (Belgium)\n\nTom Saintfiet happens to be the current coach of the Philippine national team after a six-year spell with Gambia.\n\nMost of his coaching career has been in Africa, which includes Zimbabwe, Namibia, Malawi, and Togo.\n\nThe 51-year-old Belgian has always wanted the Super Eagles' top coaching role for many years and came close to getting it in 2012. However, due to the infighting in Nigerian football at the time, his wishes did not come to pass.\n\nSaintfiet is a firm believer in the talents that abound in the Super Eagles. According to analysts, he is the most affordable of the shortlisted candidates to take over the job.\n\nFinidi replaced Peseiro as Nigeria coach\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Finidi George was assistant to former boss Jose Peseiro's during the Portuguese coach's tenure, as he was part of the backroom staff during the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The Enyimba coach got the job after the departure of Peseiro.\n\nPeseiro achieved a remarkable feat in his debut tournament as Nigeria's coach. The Portuguese's conservative style of play, coupled with the team's wobbly results in the matches leading to the AFCON, led to a lot of criticisms before the tournament even started.\n\nHowever, the Super Eagles won over everyone in Ivory Coast, with Peseiro opting for a 3-4-3 formation that brought out the best in the team (probably except Victor Osimhen, who had to sacrifice goals for the greater good).\n\nNevertheless, Peseiro led the side to the final of the competition, where they were eventually beaten by hosts Ivory Coast. But Nigeria made an impact at the tournament, having kept four clean sheets in the seven matches they played on their way to finishing as runners-up.\n\nThe former Porto boss officially parted ways with Nigeria on February 29, 2024, when his contract with the Super Eagles expired.\n\nOther notable Super Eagles coaches\n\nThroughout its storied history, the Nigerian national football team, affectionately known as the Super Eagles, has been guided by a cadre of remarkable managers.\n\nAmong these luminaries, Brazilian tactician Otto Martins Glória stands tall, etching his name in Nigerian football folklore by masterminding their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) triumph in 1980.\n\nHis astute leadership paved the way for subsequent successes, including the appointment of Dutch coach Clemens Westerhof, whose tenure saw Nigeria clinch their second AFCON title in 1994, solidifying their status as a continental powerhouse.\n\nIn more recent memory, the indomitable spirit of the Super Eagles was epitomised by the late Stephen Keshi, whose managerial prowess propelled Nigeria to AFCON glory once again in 2013, marking a triumphant return to the summit of African football.\n\nThese iconic figures left an indelible mark on Nigerian football and inspired generations of players and fans with their passion, vision, and commitment to excellence.\n\nOther notable managers who served as Nigeria coach"
