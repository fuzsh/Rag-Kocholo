        "text": "Watching Poalo Montero vomit in the dugout at Perugia last Sunday was graphic confirmation of what most observers already knew: these are times of upheaval in Serie A. And on the benches of Italy's top division no-one is safe.\n\nLook at Italy's biggest clubs for starters. Lazio, Inter and Parma have all already shed their managers this season, Milan have prepared a P45 for theirs, and even at the League leaders Roma there's now a question mark over the future of Fabio Capello.\n\nIt's first class coach disruption on a scale that leaves Railtrack green with envy, and nowhere is it more evident than Florence. Only last week in fact, as their team Fiorentina burst into the top three, Turkish manager Fatih Terim announced that he'll be leaving come June, leaving the renaissance city agog.\n\nHundreds of fans thronged the street below club owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori's penthouse as he and Terim met to discuss a new deal last week. The supporters' unanimous message: You're the one for me, Fatih. Upstairs Cecchi Gori talked for two hours of his grand plans for the future, but the man they call 'the emperor' was not impressed. Less than 24 hours later he went before the cameras to announce his departure at the end of this season, plunging the city into mourning for the second time since losing Gabriel Batistuta last summer.\n\nSeven months ago, when the club signed Terim, the Galatasaray coach who'd become a national hero in Turkey by winning the Uefa Cup, Fiorentina's fans were still bemoaning Gabriel's flight, and questions were immediately asked. Not only was Terim the first Turk to manage a Serie A side, he also spoke no Italian and was inheriting a team that had lost their key player of the past nine seasons.\n\nEarly results weren't comforting. Fiorentina were knocked out of Europe by the mighty Tirol Innsbruck and their league form was a disaster too. Cecchi Gori made loud noises about dismissing his coach, but to Terim's rescue came the noble fans of Florence, who a) loathe Cecchi Gori more than anything on the face of the planet, and b) are not averse to a good three day riot when the occasion demands.\n\nA potent cocktail, and one that rendered the Turk untouchable.\n\nBingo! Within no time the results started to come along. Fiorentina raced back up the table and firmly into the hunt for the title. Not only that, but they emerged as the highest scoring side in Serie A despite the loss of Batigol.\n\nSo a grateful management finally offered Terim that most oxymoronic of concepts: a contract extension. But what a heartbreaker he turned out to be. \"Thanks, but no thanks\" he announced. \"I have no faith in a future at this club.\" The motive, as Terim later explained to the players, was that Cecchi Gori had lied over plans to fire him and replace him with Gianluca Vialli - plans an anonymous club director had previously leaked.\n\nOh dear. Worried word in Florence now is that the Emperors' new club will be none other than Milan, knocked out of the Uefa Cup by Galatasaray last season and humiliated 4-0 in the league by Terim's terrors this time around. Terim, for his part, insists he's signed nothing.\n\nAt Fiorentina, confusion reigns. Cecchi Gori has threatened legal action, waving an 'option' for a second year in Florence which the club say Terim signed, and which gives them power of veto over his future. It's hardly the basis of a successful partnership.\n\nThe players meanwhile have vowed to battle on. Bemoaning 'mishandling' by the club they say they hope to change Terim's mind with a continued run of results. As for the fans - they've begun to waver. As the side left for Sunday's game at Atalanta- a 0-0 draw - the Turk was greeted with whistles and cries of 'Traitor'.\n\nSo far Terim has handled press and public in Florence like a master. The suspicion is thus that he may yet change his mind, after winning further concessions from the desperate Cecchi Gori. Let's hope so - for if not, rapidly rising Fiorentina are in for an even more rapid burn out, with Fatih on his way much sooner than June. It's a rare certainty in this most eventful of seasons.\n\nJust look at Sven-Goran Eriksson's early departure from Lazio. Proof that, even with the best will in the world, an outgoing coach CANNOT inspire a team. And without their talismanic Turk one suspects, as Zebedee would have said, that it's time for bed Florence. What a shame."
