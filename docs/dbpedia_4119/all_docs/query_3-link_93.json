I have used the video below where the team has its pep talk before the game. The leader I evaluated is Fatih Terim who is known with his unique attitude and has been one of the leading coaches in the Turkish Football History including the National Football Team. For translation purposes I will also explain the highlights of the video below.\n\nFirst of all he starts with explaining the overall strategy by showing how to position the team according to the ball in the field. Also explains how the team should be positioned and overall emphasizes the strategy of the field’s dominance. This shows how he uses the I in intellectual leadership.\n\nBy time 00:57 by saying the names “Okan”, “Ümit”, “Suat” he individually targets the members in the team of how they should focus during the game. This shows the I in individual leadership. Then he continues with the intellectual part.\n\nBy 2:05 he starts with the identifying part where he collects the team around and starts his pep talk. He reminds the team where they have started and their prior ambitions and goals. He also always uses “we will / we did” kind of wording so that he acts as a part of the team and acts as a role model where he also takes ownership of the game. He also supports the team’s success so far by appreciation to spread enthusiasm.\n\nBy 2:40 he says the words “I am saying again: You will win! You will work to win! However; what the outcome is; You have always won in my heart and have always been champions and so will remain that way!” And then they all shout together that the team is inspired to win where he shows the inspiring part of his leadership."
