        "text": "You might think that with Turkey having reached the semi-finals of Euro 2008, the country would be united behind their manager, Fatih Terim. But it's not as simple as that. Many Turks love the man, but his side's success has opened up a new front on a social debate that has run with erratic virulence since the War of Independence.\n\nIt's a debate that has spread to journalists too. Those embedded with the team are generous in their praise, but many in Turkey are critical. Even after the national side sealed a place in the last four, Ahmet Hakan, Hurriyet's political columnist, was able to write a piece entitled \"Eight reasons why I hate Fatih Terim\" and find many in Taksim Square agreeing with him.\n\nTo an outsider, Fatih seems an immense, impressive figure. That's an image he likes to project himself. \"There are 365 members of parliament but only one Fatih Terim,\" says the man himself. Possessed of an Ataturkian force of will, Terim treats his team like soldiers. If Steve McClaren had puffed from a cigar and made a 'V'-sign people would have fallen about laughing on the beaches. If, after Euro 2008, the crisply-shirted Terim unleashed an epoch-shattering wave of neo-Enlightenment cultural, judicial and financial reforms, it would make some kind of sense. Employing Scott Peri, the American fitness guru, who has set upon the team with almost self-defeating militaristic vigour, fits in perfectly with this image.\n\nIn short, Fatih 'The Emperor' – he gives himself that nickname - Terim, embodies a positive kind of national stereotype that many Turks have about themselves. As an Arsenal-defeating Uefa Cup winner with Galatasaray, at Fiorentina, at Milan, and with his side's progress through this tournament, Terim certainly has an impressive CV - and he has the Cloughisms to match. \"Einstein said there are two ways to live,\" he told reporters ahead of tonight's semi-final. \"One is to believe everything is a miracle and live your life that way, the second is to believe nothing is a miracle. I belong to the second group.\"\n\nCritics, however, say his management since retaking control of the national side from Ersun Yanal in 2005 has been mystical as well as mystifying. The first charge against Terim is his team selections: against Portugal, for instance, there was no place for the excellent Arda, while Bayern Munich's right-sided midfielder Hamit was played on the left to make way for the woefully out-of-form Sabri. This is a bit like playing David Beckham on the left to accommodate Byrnjar Gunnarsson and overlooking Cesc Fábregas. It's free-association madness.\n\nThough Terim likes to portray himself as a tough guy, the case for the prosecution goes, he only ever picks players who will obey him. Far from being the kabadayi of popular legend then (a sort of cross between a Turkish version of Phil Mitchell and Tony Soprano) he's just a bully. A kabadayi bozmasi. Referees across Europe might agree. Accordingly, the more independent-minded foreign-based players at his disposal have suffered. Stubbornly not picking Halil from Schalke or Zenith's Fatih Tekke has now left Terim horribly short of firepower.\n\nNot many Turkish fans gave them a hope against Switzerland, a chance against Czech Republic, or any more than a slither of a prayer against Croatia, but now people on the street are expecting to beat Germany. And every new injury, every new suspension, makes them more convinced. Thus, almost inevitably, when the ball dropped out of the heavens for Semih Senturk in the game against Croatia it was reported as a celestial gift. \"I hit it\", said the striker, \"with the help of God, for one of my most unforgettable goals.\"\n\nThe sporting commentariat are scared that their side's tactics amount to nothing more than tying a load of ribbons on a Sheik's grave, and that against an intelligent Germany team – ruthless against Austria, spirited against Portugal – they will be badly found out. A Turkish win would be sweeter than a tray of baklava, but the cold-hearted facts are that this will in all probability be a rope-a-dope too far for Terim's team.\n\nBefore Euro 2008 started, I told incredulous Turkish friends and colleagues that I was going to be backing Turkey because they were in the easier half of the draw. \"I don't trust the trainer\", they said. \"Technically good players, bad coach\", they insisted. At best, \"his below-average skills\" were just about offset by the fact that \"Turkish people are emotional as well as high-tempered, Terim knows how to manage this\".\n\nAll over the Bosphorus some hope; and some despair. If nothing else, in his mixture of brilliance and buffoonery, Fatih reflects today's Turkey."
