        "text": "Two weeks ago, Turkey national coach Fatih Terim was seen in television footage fighting with the owner of a kebab restaurant. Today, the Turkish Football Federation relieved Terim of his head coaching duties.\n\nThe federation’s statement simply referred to “non-football related issues,” but all signs point to the kebab-shop brawl as the main factor.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbinMJN2PAE\n\nThe conflict began with Terim’s son-in-law Ahmet Baran Cetin, who owns a steakhouse that neighbors the kebab restaurant in the Turkish beach resort city of Alcati. Cetin and the kebab shop owner, Selahattin Aydogdu, had been clashing over a partition wall.\n\nAccording to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, Terim threatened that he would beat up Aydogdu over the phone, and Aydogdu welcomed the challenge. So Terim made the 200-mile trip to the restaurant, and he and his in-laws left five men injured at the restaurant.\n\nWhile no one has pressed formal charges, the incident was enough to get Terim out of a job. He had coached the Turkish national team for 11 years over three spells."
