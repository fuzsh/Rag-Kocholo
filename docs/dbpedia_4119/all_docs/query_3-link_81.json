        "text": "Renowned – and controversial – Turkish football figure Fatih Terim has embarked on a fresh chapter in his illustrious career by taking the helm at Panathinaikos.\n\nThe 70-year-old, affectionately known as the ”Emperor” (Pasha) for his extensive successes, faces his latest challenge in the Greek Super League.\n\nTerim became widely known after bringing eight victories for Galatasaray.\n\nCurrently leading the league with Panathinaikos, Terim’s impact has been immediate, securing notable victories and reinforcing the team’s roster in the January transfer window.\n\nHe’s already won three league matches, holding title contender AEK Athens 2-2 at home and knocking Olympiakos out of the Greek Cup.\n\nThe Turk signed Greece captain Tassos Bakasetas and secured loan deals to secure Panathinaikos’ defense with Turkey international Samet Akaydin and Poland goalkeeper Bartlomiej Dragowski.\n\nAll three played midweek in the first leg of the Greek Cup quarterfinals at Atromitos, in western Athens. Panathinaikos lost but Terim seemed unfazed.\n\nAs Panathinaikos gears up to face PAOK on Monday 29 January, Terim remains undaunted, confident in his team’s capabilities.\n\n”As long as Panathinaikos plays like that, no one should get upset. We will not fear PAOK,” he said.\n\n”Fourteen years is a long time,” Terim told reporters after his arrival, referring to how long it has been since Panathinaikos has seen a championship.\n\n”But the same thing happened (when I took over) at Galatasaray — until we beat everybody,” he added.\n\nBeyond the pitch, Terim diplomatically navigates the often-sensitive relations between Greece and Turkey, marking his tenure with a positive move amid improving diplomatic ties.\n\nThis strategic transition aligns with Terim’s historic knack for turning challenges into triumphs, a legacy he seeks to extend in the vibrant football landscape of Greece.\n\nIn a surprising move, Terim, with his rich football background, has refrained from commenting on the historical tensions between Greece and Turkey even though having been a semi-professional soccer player in his youth, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan personally called Terim after his arrival in Athens in late December to extend his best wishes and good luck.\n\n*With AP and AMNA"
