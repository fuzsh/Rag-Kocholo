        "text": "The Turkey Euro 2024 squad are through to the quarter-finals of the tournament, after a strong run of results.\n\nAfter getting off to a great start against Georgia in their opening Euro 2024 match with a 3-1 victory, Turkey were brought crashing back down to eather with a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Portugal.\n\nThey needed just one point as they went into their final group game against Czech Republic to secure second spot in Group F, though, something they duly did with a 2-1 victory. The hot-tempered game saw two red cards for Turkey's opponents, while Cenk Tosun bagged a 94th-minute winner, too.\n\nThat result meant that Turkey were up against Austria in the last 16, knowing progression from there would pit them up against the Netherlands. A 2-1 victory against Ralf Rangnick's side was hard-fought, with Merih Demiral proving the hero from centre-back with a brace. They'll be without him this time around, though, with UEFA issuing Demiral a two-match ban.\n\nCrucially, though, Hakan Calhanoglu returns from suspension, after missing the clash with Austria. The side's captain and talisman, his return will be a welcome one for the quarter-finals.\n\nAlong with information on every other Euro 2024 squad, FourFourTwo will provide all the latest news on and details on how to watch every game at the tournament, keeping you up to date at all times.\n\nVIDEO: Why Spain Have The PERFECT System To Win The Euros\n\nTurkey Euro 2024 squad\n\nTurkey Euro 2024 squad: The full 26-man team\n\nGK: Mert Gunok (Beşiktaş)\n\nGK: Ugurcan Cakır (Trabzonspor)\n\nGK: Altay Bayindir (Manchester United)\n\nDF: Zeki Celik (Roma)\n\nDF: Merih Demiral (Al-Ahli)\n\nDF: Samet Akaydin (Panathinaikos)\n\nDF: Ahmetcan Kaplan (Ajax)\n\nDF: Abdulkerim Bardakci (Galatasaray)\n\nDF: Mert Muldur (Fenerbahçe)\n\nDF: Ferdi Kadioglu (Fenerbahçe)\n\nDF: Kaan Ayhan (Galatasaray)\n\nMF: Hakan Calhanoglu (Inter Milan)\n\nMF: Okay Yokuslu (West Bromwich Albion)\n\nMF: Orkun Kokcu (Benfica)\n\nMF: Arda Guler (Real Madrid)\n\nMF: Salih Ozcan (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nMF: Ismail Yuksek (Fenerbahçe)\n\nFW: Kerem Akturkoglu (Galatasaray)\n\nFW: Cenk Tosun (Beşiktaş)\n\nFW: Yusuf Yazici (Lille)\n\nFW: Irfan Kahveci (Fenerbahçe)\n\nFW: Kenan Yildiz (Juventus)\n\nFW: Baris Alper Yilmaz (Galatasaray)\n\nFW: Yunus Akgun (Leicester City)\n\nFW: Semih Kilicsoy (Beşiktaş)\n\nFW: Bertug Yildirim (Rennes)\n\nTurkey Euro 2024 squad numbers\n\nTurkey fixtures and results\n\nJune 18: Turkey 3-1 Georgia, Westfalenstadion, Dortmund, Germany\n\nJune 22: Turkey 0-3 Portugal, Westfalenstadion, Dortmund, Germany\n\nJune 26: Czech Republic 1-2 Turkey, Volksparkstadion, Hamburg, Germany\n\nJuly 2: Austria 1-2 Turkey, Leipzig Stadium, Leipzig, Germany\n\nJuly 6: Netherlands v Turkey, Olympiastadion, Berlin, Germany\n\nTurkey Euro 2024 top scorers\n\n2 goals: Merih Demiral\n\n1 goal: Kerem Akturkoglu, Arda Guler, Mert Muldur, Cenk Tosun, Hakan Calhanoglu\n\nTurkey yellow cards and suspensions\n\nSuspended: Merih Demiral, Ismail Yuksek, Orkan Kocku\n\n1 yellow: Zeki Celik, Kenan Yildiz, Arda Guler, Salih Ozcan, Kaan Ayhan, Urgucan Cakir, Mert Muldur, Mert Gunok\n\nTurkey manager: Vincenzo Montella\n\nA decade ago, Vincenzo Montella was one of Italy's most promising coaches, but after turbulent spells at Milan, Sevilla and Fiorentina, he eventually cropped up at minnows Adana Demirspor in 2021.\n\nFinding a second home in Turkey having secured the Blue Lightnings' first European campaign, his popularity has nonetheless taken a hit of late.\n\nTurkey's star player\n\nHakan Calhanoglu\n\nHakan Calhanoglu claims to be the best deep-lying playmaker in the world.\n\nArrogant, yes, but not necessarily wrong. Consistently superb with Inter atop Serie A for much of the season, he possesses a phenomenal passing range and always-dangerous set-pieces. At 30, he's in his prime and wants to triumph in the country of his birth. He is back for the quarter-fianls, too, having been suspended for the last-16 tie against Austria."
