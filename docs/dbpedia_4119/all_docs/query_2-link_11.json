        "text": "Turkish national football team’s assistant coach Selcuk Sahin has set his sights on winning their group in the upcoming European Championship, according to a press release. Sahin also addressed recent criticism surrounding the team’s selection.\n\nAhead of the EURO 2024 match against Georgia, the national team’s coaching staff met with the press.\n\nSahin addressed the team’s goals and his own journey to joining the team during a recent discussion.\n\nTaking it step-by-step\n\nSahin emphasized a gradual approach, acknowledging the team’s youth and prioritizing progress from the group stage. He highlighted their potential for future success while managing pressure on current players. “We trust ourselves,” he said, confident in the squad’s ability to handle tough matches.\n\nSahin described his initial lack of familiarity with head coach Montella, having only faced him as assistant coaches at another club. He initially planned to pursue an independent coaching role but ultimately chose to join the national team staff. “It’s an honor to serve the country’s football team,” he said, expressing satisfaction with working alongside Montella’s technical expertise. He praised the team’s response to their challenging takeover period, highlighting the win against Croatia as a turning point.\n\n‘We chose challenging preparation matches’\n\nSahin elaborated on their strategy for selecting players for the upcoming tournament. He explained their decision to choose challenging opponents for recent preparation matches. This approach allowed them to assess every potential player. “We will need every player in the tournament,” Sahin said, acknowledging the demanding schedule with matches every four days.\n\nWhile pleased with the overall results, Sahin expressed disappointment with the second half of the Austria match. He framed this as a valuable learning experience, highlighting their focus on facing strong teams to evaluate their capabilities.\n\nSahin revealed they have formed ideas based on player evaluations and plan to field the most prepared squad for the opening match against Georgia\n\nWill Kahveci play?\n\nRegarding the injury to national footballer Irfan Can Kahveci, Sahin stated, “Irfan felt discomfort in the last match against Poland, and we took him off at halftime. We are monitoring İrfan’s condition now. We still have time ahead of us. We will see how the process unfolds. Irfan is in good health; we will observe this during training.\n\nSahin commented on the reminder of individual defensive errors in the Poland match, stating, “We have good players in the defensive area.” We shouldn’t dwell on individual mistakes. We look at the big picture. You’re 11 on the field, when you make a mistake, your teammates should cover for you. There were shortcomings in that aspect. Samet is a player we are pleased with, value highly, and will benefit from. The central defenders are somewhat clear in our minds, but it can change from match to match.”\n\n‘Arda Guler is a player we want to utilize’\n\nSahin heaped praise on young star Arda Guler, highlighting his talent and recent performances.\n\nHe acknowledged Guler’s injury struggles after his move to Real Madrid but emphasized his return to form in recent months. “He is a very important and valuable player,” Sahin said, placing him alongside the team’s other talented athletes.\n\nThe coach confirmed Guler is under consideration for selection, stating, “He is definitely a player we want to utilize.” While a final decision hasn’t been made, Sahin expressed his optimism about Guler’s physical condition, believing him to be ready.\n\nSahin went on to acknowledge the team’s recent World Cup success, achieved with a core group. However, he emphasized the current squad’s unique depth of young talent, calling it an unprecedented situation for the national team.\n\nSahin addressed concerns about the team’s recent struggles in scoring goals, acknowledging the need for improvement but expressing confidence in his players’ abilities.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of converting scoring opportunities, stating, “We see where the ball should go. If the outcome doesn’t come today, it will tomorrow.” He highlighted the team’s talent and their success in scoring against strong opponents like Germany.\n\nSahin outlined his approach, prioritizing an enjoyable playing style for his athletes. He believes a well-prepared team will perform at their best.\n\nLooking ahead to upcoming matches, Sahin cautioned against underestimating Georgia, their first opponent. He acknowledged their motivation and the importance of this match for them. He also pointed to the challenges posed by Portugal and the Czech Republic, emphasizing the group’s overall difficulty.\n\nSahin also discussed the process of removing Can Uzun from the squad, saying, “Our other coaches also watched matches domestically and internationally, trying to follow all players. We had a broad portfolio. In the extended squad, we included the players who best suited our style of play. Then, due to UEFA rules, we had to reduce the squad to 26, which presented a significant challenge. We had to make a decision. We thought a lot about it. It wasn’t straightforward to narrow down the list. Any name we chose would have been criticized. If they’re not here today, they’ll be among us tomorrow. It wasn’t straightforward to trim the preliminary squad. It’s important to note that every player we couldn’t list is a valuable footballer for us.”\n\nSahin also mentioned that the strong support of Turkish fans in Germany will be an advantage for them, and France and England are the tournament’s favorites."
