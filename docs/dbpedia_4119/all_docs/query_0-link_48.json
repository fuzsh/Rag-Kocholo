        "text": "Coach Fatih Terim spoke after the Turkish National Team's 2-1 victory over Austria, highlighting the significance of wearing the national jersey.\n\n\"It's not about playing for Galatasaray or any other team today,\" Terim said. \"Today, it's crucial that they play for the Turkish National Team.\"\n\n'I SAID OUR JOURNEY WOULD BE LONG'\n\nRecalling his post-match comments after the Portugal game, Terim stated, \"In this studio, after our loss to Portugal, there was a lot of backlash and uproar. I said, 'Don't worry, our journey is long.' Now we see the practical reflection of those words. The key is getting out of the group stage, advancing from 16 to 8, and then from 8 to 4, 2, and eventually to the championship.\"\n\n'I KISS THIS TEAM ON THE FOREHEAD'\n\nTerim praised the players and coaching staff, saying, \"I kiss this team on the forehead. I congratulate our coach and his technical team.\"\n\n'FOOTBALL IS THIS KIND OF GAME'\n\nEmphasizing the need for support during tough times, Terim remarked, \"Football is this kind of game. You need patience and trust in your coach and players. Stand by them, especially in difficult times.\"\n\n'NOW IS THE TIME TO CELEBRATE'\n\nTerim noted that it was time for the Turkish people to celebrate, stating, \"I don't think any technical analysis is appropriate right now. It's time to celebrate. We should respect and appreciate those who contributed, and the Turkish people should express their gratitude.\"\n\n'I AM PROUD OF OUR PLAYERS'\n\nReflecting on the lessons learned from a previous friendly match against Austria, Terim added, \"Regarding Austria, there was a difference between what was said before the match and what happened during the game. Since the 6-1 friendly match, Turkey has made significant improvements. The team played with important changes, maintained possession at times, and effectively closed the center. I am proud of our players.\""
