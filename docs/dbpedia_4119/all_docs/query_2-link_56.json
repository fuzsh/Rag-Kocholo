        "text": "Mikautadze sends in a cross from the left and Kvaratskhelia attempts a very ambitious overhead kick but he does not get it right. He has remained down having received an elbow in the process of that effort.\n\nTurkey’s first goalscorer Muldur has gone down again with cramp and it looks like he is going to be replaced.\n\nTurkey are awarded a free-kick in a central position not far outside the Georgia box. The referee had allowed play to go on but goes back and books Kverkvelia. Guler was appealing for a penalty but that is never going to be given. Calhanoglu will take and he is dangerous from these areas...\n\nThe rain has been so bad in Dortmund that it has been gushing off the stadium roof, Old Trafford style. The groudstaff have been brushing it off the pitch as best they can and the rain seems to have stopped for now. The players are out preparing for the game. With kick-off at 5pm UK time, it sees to be going ahead for the time being. But thunderstorms are forecast in western Germany. If the game is postponed Lothar Matthaus will have to get himself ready for an exhausting two-hour chat-marathon to fill the air-time as the pundit for this game on the RTL German TV network.\n\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia winger has been linked with a move away from Napoli and his agent Mamuka Jugeli has been speaking about his client’s future.\n\n“We want to leave Naples, but we are waiting for the end of the European Championship first. Our priority is to move to a team that plays in the Champions League.\n\n“With (Antonio) Conte, Napoli undoubtedly has big plans. I am sure that they will qualify for the Champions League and that they will still fight for the Scudetto, but this does not mean that Kvaratskhelia wants to stay. Worse is that if he stays at Napoli, Khvicha will lose a year. We are worried.”\n\nHowever Napoli posted this on X in response:\n\n“In reference to the statements of Kvaratskhelia’s agent, Mamuka Jugeli, and his father Badri, Napoli reiterates that the player has a contract for another three years with the club.\n\n“Kvaratskhelia is not on the market. It is not the agents or fathers who decide the future of a player under contract with Napoli but the Napoli club!!! End of the story.”\n\nGroup F gets going this afternoon as Turkey take on Georgia in Dortmund. It is the battle of the two most easterly teams at Euro 2024.\n\nTurkey are currently ranked 40th in the world and are led by the former Fiorentina and AC Milan manager Vincenzo Montella, who was appointed as Turkey manager in September 2023. Their best performance at the European Championship was a third-place finish in 2008. Their hopes of progression into the knockout stages will centre around their captain and talisman Hakan Calhanoglu, who plays his club football with Serie A champions Inter Milan. Turkey have three players who currently play in English football; Altay Bayindir (Manchester United), Okay Yokuslu (West Bromwich Albion) and Yunus Akgun (Leicester City). 19-year-old Real Madrid Arda Guler midfield is one to watch not just in this tournament but likely many into the future.\n\nGeorgia, sitting 35 places below Turkey in the world rankings, are managed by former Bayern Munich defender Willy Sagnol, who has been in charge since 2021. Having earned a spot in the play-offs through winning their Nations League group, they beat Euro 2004 champions Greece on penalties to reach a major tournament for the first time. Their chances of qualification for the knockouts will hinge on the performances of Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who played a crucial role in the side from Naples winning the Serie A title a year ago. The 23-year-old has the pressure of the nation on his shoulders being their talisman but he has the ability to light up this tournament. Watford fans will recognise one name in the Georgia squad and that is Giorgi Chakvetadze, who joined Watford on loan last summer before making the move permanent in February. They are the lowest ranked side at Euro 2024.\n\nLater on in Group F Portugal play the Czech Republic in Leipzig.\n\nTeam news to follow shortly."
