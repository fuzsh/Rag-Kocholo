        "text": "After missing out on the 2018 World Cup, Italy have now gone 30 matches unbeaten under the influence of former Premier League title winner Roberto Mancini. The Italian manager has reinstalled the faith of the nation at this summer's Euros, playing an exciting brand of possession-based football. After taking 9 points, scoring 7 goals and conceding 0 in their opening three group stage matches, Italy now look like genuine favourites for the crown. Here is our tactical analysis of Roberto Mancini's Italy after three matches at this summer's Euros.\n\nEuro 2020 has officially kicked off, with Italy smashing Turkey to pieces in the second half of the opening fixture. The match was a fairly dull affair in the first half, with Turkey defending resolutely, and Italy only got going once they abandoned their attempts to have all of the possession. By relinquishing more control over to Turkey, Mancini's team ultimately gained more control in the final third and were able to unbalance Turkey's defensive structures to win the match comfortably 3-0. Here is our tactical analysis of the match.\n\nThe day has finally come. The 2020 Euros are here in 2021. Match 1 of 51 kicked off in Rome on Friday as Italy played host to Turkey. Italy come into the tournament in good form, winning all ten of their qualifying matches, and not losing a competitive match since September of 2018. But with an interesting first test against Turkey, another team in good form, many were excited to see if Italy could continue their impressive run of results on the big stage."
