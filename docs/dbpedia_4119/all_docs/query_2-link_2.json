        "text": "Former Italy and Roma striker Vincenzo Montella has been appointed as the head coach of the Turkey national team, taking over from Stefan Kuntz, who was dismissed following a disappointing set of results in the most recent international break.\n\nAccording to an update from Sky Sport Italia, Montella is set to be officially unveiled in front of the press on Wednesday. It is believed that the 49-year-old has put pen to paper on a three-year contract.\n\nPrevious reports from Fabrizio Romano claim that an agreement had been reached between the two parties on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMontella, who represented Empoli, Genoa, Sampdoria, Roma and briefly Fulham during his playing days, left his post as coach of Turkish side Adana Demirspor in June having won 38 of his 76 matches in charge.\n\nThe former Italy international now has over a decadeâ€™s worth of experience in management, having begun his coaching career with Catania in 2011."
