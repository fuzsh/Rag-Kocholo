        "text": "Following their qualification to the Round of 16 in Euro 2024 and paired against Austria, the Turkish national football team has ignited a firestorm of excitement with their performance in the group stage.\n\nUnder the management of Vincenzo Montella, the team faced severe criticism after a 3-0 loss to Portugal but has managed to exceed Türkiye’s performance in the last two European Championships.\n\nSolid performance and historic achievements\n\nIn the pandemic-affected Euro 2020, managed by Senol Gunes and Euro 2016 under Fatih Terim, the national team failed to advance from the group stage.\n\nNot only did they progress from the group stage, but under Montella’s leadership, they’ve also surpassed the country’s performance in the past two European Championships in terms of accurate passing\n\nThroughout the group stage, the team averaged 443 accurate passes per match, compared to 373 in Euro 2020 and a mere 305 in Euro 2016.\n\nOffensive prowess and defensive resilience\n\nIn the first three matches of the tournament, our national team averaged 5.33 shots on target per game while conceding an average of five shots on target. In Euro 2020, they averaged four shots on target per match but faced more than twice as many shots on target against their own goal.\n\nIn contrast, in Euro 2016, the national team struggled to even reach the opposition’s goal, concluding the tournament with only four shots on target across three matches against Croatia, Spain, and Czech Republic, while failing to prevent a total of 17 shots on target."
