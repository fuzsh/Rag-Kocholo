        "text": "TFF chairman Yildirim Demiroren has proposed a plan which will allow the 59-year-old Terim to combine his coaching commitments with Galatasaray with that of the national side for the rest of the season. After that, he would be expected to take charge of the national team on a full time basis.\n\nTurkey are struggling to reach the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil and stand fourth in Group D with seven points from six matches, adrift of leaders Netherlands (18) and second-placed Hungary (11), who are currently in the play-off spot."
