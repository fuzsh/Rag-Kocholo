        "text": "(CNN) -- Russia coach Guus Hiddink has been named as Turkey's new national team manager after agreeing a two-year contract starting in August.\n\nThe 63-year-old, who announced last week he was leaving his post with Russia after failing to win a place at the 2010 World Cup, will aim to guide Turkey through the upcoming qualifiers for Euro 2012.\n\nThe Dutchman had a short tenure at English Premier League club Chelsea in 2009 when he led the side to the Champions League semifinals and lost only one match during his 22 games in charge.\n\nThe Turkish Football Federation announced on Wednesday that Hiddink will take over in August, having decided not to renew his contract with Russia which expires on June 30.\n\n\"Turkish Football Federation president Mahmut Ozgener and TFF vice-president Lutfi Aribogan flew to Amsterdam to finalize the negotiations with Hiddink,\" it said on its Web site.\n\n\"The experienced coach agreed to a two-year contract with an option for a further two years.\"\n\nThe TFF said former Turkey captain Oguz Cetin and ex-goalkeeper Engin Ipekoglu would be among Hiddink's coaching staff, which will also include one of his fellow Dutchmen.\n\nHiddink steered Russia to the semifinals of Euro 2008, but last November his team were beaten in a World Cup qualifying playoff by Slovenia.\n\nHe has previously managed club sides Real Madrid and Valencia as well as taking South Korea and the Netherlands to fourth place at World Cups in 2002 and 1998, and Australia to the second round in 2006.\n\nOne of his most successful periods was at Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, where he won six domestic league titles and four cups.\n\nThe Turkish national team has been without a coach since Fatih Terim's departure in October, following a failed 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nTurkey are in Group A for the Euro 2012 qualifiers with Germany, Austria, Belgium, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan."
