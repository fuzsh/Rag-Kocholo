        "text": "One of Turkey's top football officials may quit the game after he was physically attacked on the pitch by the president of an Ankara club and its fans.\n\nThe violent attack on elite referee Halil Umut Meler has left Turkish football in a full-blown crisis and magnified concerns about Turkey's institutions.\n\nThe referee was treated in hospital after he was punched in the face by MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca, after the Ankara-based team conceded a late equaliser in the Turkish capital against Super Lig rivals Caykur Rizespor.\n\nWhile the referee lay injured, furious fans then stormed on to the pitch and kicked him. Ankaragucu's club president has since resigned and been placed in pre-trial detention with two others.\n\nThe dramatic events after the final whistle underscore the intense emotions surrounding football in Turkey. The sport is massively popular in the country of 85 million people and is a platform that links Turkish politics, business and culture.\n\nThe attack has prompted the 37-year old referee on Uefa's elite list to contemplate quitting, according to Ali Kunak, former general secretary of the Turkish Football Federation's central arbitration board, who spoke to Meler and local media on Tuesday.\n\nThe violence has also led to an indefinite suspension of Turkish Super Lig games.\n\nThe Turkish Football Federation, in a post on X, said it condemned the \"inhumane, despicable attack\", which it blamed in part on \"irresponsible statements of club presidents, managers, coaches, and TV commentators targeting referees\".\n\nViolence has long been associated with Turkish football, where it is common to see a heavy police presence at matches across the country.\n\nIn March, six people were arrested for clashes involving fireworks before and after a match between Bursa's Bursaspor and Diyarbakir's Amedspor. And last September, a fan burst on to the pitch and violently kicked a Besiktas player following a match against Ankaragucu.\n\n\"Football is not only football,\" said Ozgehan Senuva, professor of international relations at Ankara's Middle East Technical University. \"This is only a reflection of the general social situation in Turkey.\"\n\nMany Turks and the country's Western allies worry about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's tightening grip on Turkey's key institutions, including the judicial system. More than 20 years of Erdogan rule has left a deepening mistrust and sense of injustice that goes way beyond football.\n\nThe vast bulk of Turkey's media is controlled by the Erdogan government - 90%, according to Reporters Without Borders - but football has turned into a key venue for political discourse.\n\n\"People don't trust the referees and how the referees are appointed. That goes in parallel with the low levels of trust in the judicial system,\" said Prof Senuva.\n\nBut the violence shown towards Halil Umut Meler \"is a new threshold for Turkish football\", according to Omer Turan, an international relations professor at Istanbul's Bilgi University. \"Referees are almost always the scapegoat used to explain unsuccessful results,\" he said.\n\nProf Turan pointed out that Faruk Koca, 59, is a former Ankara MP and a current member of President Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP)."
