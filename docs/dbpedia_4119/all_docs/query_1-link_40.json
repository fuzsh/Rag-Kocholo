        "text": "In Turkish football, few figures are as influential as coach Fatih Terim. He has coached numerous teams in his country and even his national team. The Nigeria bet site is 1xBet, and it features lots of wagering possibilities in Turkish football. Some of the teams that Terim coached during his life were:\n\nGalatasaray;\n\nFiorentina;\n\nAC Milan;\n\nand of course, the Turkish national squad.\n\nTerim spent many years as a defender in Adana Demirspor and also Galatasaray. Not only that, because he also played more than 50 games for the Turkish national squad. This experience helped him greatly when he decided to become a coach later in his life. All the teams coached by Terim are available at the 1xBet Nigeria bet site, which is full of wagering opportunities in football and other sports.\n\nBeginning of his coaching career\n\nTerim started his coaching career in Ankaragücü. Later, he moved to Götzepe. In this stage of his career he didn’t have any major success. However, success is everywhere at www.1xbet.ng/en/casino/, which has great games that can be enjoyed while following Turkish football.\n\nHowever, an important turn of events in Terim’s career came in 1990. At that time, he was named assistant manager to Sepp Piontek, who was the coach of the Turkish national side back then. He also worked as head coach of the U-21 squad during that time. Later, Piontek left the team and Terim was named head coach of the senior squad.\n\nTerim had a huge task in front of him. He needed to qualify the squad for the Euro 1996. He managed to do that. However, the performance of the team at the competition was abysmal. They lost all the matches and failed to score a single goal. At the 1xBet casino it is possible to have a great time, all of this while waiting for the next exciting football matches.\n\nRelated: The Story Of Don Elías Figueroa\n\nThe Turkish national squad and Galatasaray\n\nIn total, Terim has been coach of Galatasaray on 4 occasions. Spending approximately 13 years in the job. He also coached the Turkish national squad on three separate spells, which means that he spent 11 years in the job. Both of these teams are featured a lot at www.1xbet.ng/en/live/, where users can bet and win in all matches.\n\nWith the national squad, Terim had a great UEFA Euro 2008 performance. He reached the semi-finals in that competition, which was the best result ever for the team in a competition of this size. In Galatasaray he has also been a very successful coach. He has helped the team to reach its status as one of the giants of Turkish football. Galatasaray and other teams from Turkish football are featured at the 1xBet site, where all their contests are available for wagering and great prizes can be won."
