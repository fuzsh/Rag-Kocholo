        "text": "The Turkish Volleyball Federation appointed Cédric Énard as the new head coach of the men’s national team. Énard, a French expert with a rich coaching background, takes over the position following the departure of Italian Alberto Giuliani. Previously, Énard served as the head coach for the Croatian national team (extended the contract with the Croatian Volleyball Federation in 2023) and was recently named the general manager of French club Alterna Stade Poitevin Poitiers.\n\nUnder the former coach Giuliani, the Turkish men’s team achieved notable success, including victories in the CEV Golden League and FIVB Challenger, as well as qualifying for the VNL 2024, ensuring their participation in 2025. Despite their elimination at the hands of Slovenia in the European Championship, the team showcased strong performances throughout the competition.\n\nÉnard, born in Vouillé, Vienne, has transitioned from a promising playing career cut short by a medical condition to a successful coaching career. With achievements spanning various clubs and national teams, including a significant tenure at Berlin where he led the team to numerous trophies, Énard brings a wealth of experience to the Turkish team. His previous roles also include assistant coach for the French national team, contributing to their FIVB World League win, and head coaching positions with the Estonian and Croatian national teams."
