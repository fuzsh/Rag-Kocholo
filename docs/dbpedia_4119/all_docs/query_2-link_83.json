        "text": "On the heels of the deadly earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, Canadian footballer Samuel Adekugbe has been loaned from Antakya’s Hatayspor FC to league leaders Galatasaray SK for the balance of the 2022-23 Turkish Süper Lig. As Antakya was one of the devastated cities from the 6 February earthquakes, the club has withdrawn from the Turkish Süper Lig for the rest of the season.\n\nSince matches have been postponed across the league, Adekugbe and fellow Canadian Atiba Hutchinson from Beşiktaş JK have partnered to help the Canadian Red Cross in their delivery of emergency relief to those that have been affected by the earthquakes.\n\nAdekugbe, a member of Canada Soccer’s Men’s National Team that competed at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, is in his second season in Turkey and had made 52 appearances for Hatayspor FC before he was loaned to Galatasaray. The 28-year old Adekugbe has featured primarily as a leftback, but has also featured further up as a left midfielder.\n\nThe Turkish Süper Lig schedule is expected to resume in the coming weeks. While the Adekugbe loan runs through the end of the 2022-23 season, there is an option for Galatasaray SK to purchase Adekugbe’s contract beyond the current season.\n\nEarthquake in Türkiye and Syria Appeal\n\nFrom 6 to 22 February 2023, the Government of Canada has announced it w ill match donations from individuals from 6 to 22 February to the Earthquake in Türkiye and Syria Appeal, up to a maximum of $10 million. Donations can be made through the Canadian Red Cross webpage: www.redcross.ca/turkiyesyriaappeal/atibaandsam/\n\nThe Red Cross Red Crescent is working to deliver emergency relief and to get help to those impacted by the earthquakes as quickly as possible. Money raised will enable the Red Cross Red Crescent to provide immediate relief, ongoing recovery efforts and resiliency and preparedness activities in impacted and surrounding areas. The activities and areas impacted may evolve based on emerging needs and compounding humanitarian crises."
