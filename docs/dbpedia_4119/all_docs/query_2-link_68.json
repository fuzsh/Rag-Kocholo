        "text": "14 Magazine continues building their squad of First Black Footballers to represent their respective nations with the inclusion of an attacker by the name Vahap Ozaltay.\n\nVahap Ozaltay was born in 1909 in Beirut. He is the son of a civil servant and of African descent. The African diaspora in Turkey comes as part of the number of enslaved Africans brought to the country during the Ottoman Empire. The Greek Occupation of Izmr (1919) in the west led Ozalltay and his family to move to Kastamonu in the northern region of Turkey. Once the Greek presence had ended (1922), Ozaltay and his family could move west again and he started his playing career with Altay S.K where he would go on to win 5 league titles. His brother Saim would play in the same team.\n\nTurkey’s First Professional Football Player\n\nOzaltay is the first ever Turkish footballer to be given a professional certificate by the Turkish state, and in 1927 played the only official game in his career for the national side against Bulgaria. There were three other occasions in which he represented his country but those games against the Soviet Union were not recognised as official by UEFA at the time. Vahap Ozaltay was also the first Turkish player to play in a foreign league. He would spend five seasons playing in the French league over two spells at Racing Club de Paris and be given the nickname Le tete de Turc for his knack of headed goals.\n\nOzaltay as a Manager\n\nAs a coach, Ozaltay managed Sisli S.K in 1937 before being given the opportunity to lead his beloved Altay for 3 years. Later he would go on to manage the Turkish National Army team in 1954. Despite his managerial career existing over 70 years ago, the tactical ingenuity of Vahap Ozaltay lives on in the present day, championed by the most elite students of the game and applied by managers at the very top of the sport.\n\nThroughout Ozaltay’s managerial career, he adopted what we know today as the WM formation – a concept that has been emulated to a degree by the likes of Pep Guardiola (Bayern Munich & Man City), Thomas Tuchel (Chelsea), Jurgen Klopp (Liverpool) and Mikel Arteta (Arsenal). The concept consists of 4 lines of play through the formation with a front three and a back three sandwiched between two sets of teammates that interlink the defence to midfield and midfield to attack. When lines are drawn to link the defensive five players with the attacking 5 the lines resemble the shape of W and an M hence its’ title.\n\nNot only was Vahap Ozaltay a trailblazer for Turkish football on the pitch, but a visionary and a catalyst in the development of elite European football as a coach. As such, we at 14 are taking the time to salute his contributions to the game."
