        "text": "ANKARA, Turkey — Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim has agreed to take over Turkey’s national team until May, guiding it through four key World Cup qualifying games.\n\nTerim, who took over the national team in an agreement signed late Thursday, will continue to coach Galatasaray as well. The Turkish Football Federation said Terim was refusing payment for the job.\n\nTerim replaces Abdullah Avci, who resigned this week. It is Terim’s third time as Turkey coach. Under him, the team reached the 2008 European Championship semifinals.\n\nTurkey is fourth in Group D of World Cup qualifying.\n\nTerim says “the road is still long. We will strive until the end.”"
