Thank you for your trust in me,\" Kuntz said.\n\nPlace at 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar\n\nAlso at the ceremony, Turkish Football Federation (TFF) President Nihat Ozdemir invited the entire country to unite around the national team in its remaining four matches, especially the one against Norway\n\n\"We will succeed together so that the national team will participate in the World Cup after 20 years, he said. \"Hopefully, we will be able to do this.\"\n\nHamit Altintop, a board member of the federation, said they trust the German coach and believe that Kuntz will be successful in his second journey with Turkey.\n\nTurkey hired Kuntz to replace Senol Gunes, whose contract was ended by mutual consent in the wake of poor results.\n\nKuntz previously coached Germany’s Under-21 team.\n\nAs a player, he made appearances for Turkey's Besiktas from 1995 to 1996 and Germany's VfL Bochum and Arminia Bielefeld."
