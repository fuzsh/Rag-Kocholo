        "text": "Fatih Terim is a Turkish football coach and retired professional defender. He was born on 4 September 1953 in Adana, Turkey.\n\nFatih started out his professional career with his hometown side Adana Demirspor in 1969 where he played 125 games during a five-year stint. In 1974, he joined Galatasaray as a striker but soon changed up the position for a defender. Terim played 327 matches for the club during his 11-year spell there. For that time his side was the Turkish Cup champion twice, in 1976 and 1982, and won the Turkish Super Cup in 1982. Since 1975 till 1985, Terim earned 51 caps to the Turkey national team.\n\nFatih Terim embarked on his managerial career at AnkaragÃ¼cÃ¼ in 1987 and went on coaching GÃ¶ztepe. In 1990, he took charge over Turkey U21 team winning the Mediterranean Games with the squad in 1993. Since 1996 till 2000, Terim was in charge of Galatasaray leading the club to the SÃ¼per Lig victory in each of his four seasons with the club. In the 1999/2000 season he led the club to glorious UEFA Cup victory. In the 2000/01 season, Fatih Terim coached the Italian side Fiorentina and in 2001 he had a short coaching spell at Serie A powerhouse Milan.\n\nIn 2002, Terim returned to Galatasaray. In 2005, he was appointed as a head coach of the Turkey national team. Fatih Terim made a tremendous impact as a manager leading the national squad to the UEFA Euro 2008 semi-finals where they, however, lost to Germany. For his terrific managerial work, Terim was even awarded the UEFA Euro 2008 Manager of the Tournament title in 2008.\n\nIn 2011, Fatih Terim took charge over Galatasaray for a third time. After slipshod performance of the club in the previous campaign, Terim skillfully led the side to the SÃ¼per Lig victory in the 2011/12 season and earned them the Turkish Super Cup trophy in 2012. In 2013 Terim was introduced as an interim manager of the Turkey national football team and started to share two jobs. However, at the beginning of the season 2013/2014 Terim parted ways with Galatasaray and concentrated on the national squad."
