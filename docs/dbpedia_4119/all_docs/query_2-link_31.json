Following a famous win in Athens, a home defeat by group winners Greece and a loss in Bosnia-Herzegovina left Turkey on the brink.\n\nWith two games left, Greece were out of sight and second place was taken by Norway. An impressive 2-1 win in Oslo did the job.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe class of 2008 may have some work to do to match the one that almost went all the way on the world stage six years ago, there is some genuine talent in the team.\n\nThe Altintop twins have shown while playing for Turkey as well as respective Bundesliga teams Bayern Munich and Schalke that they can compete at the very highest level and with Fenerbache reaching the last eight of the Champions League, these are good times for Turkey.\n\nThe opening game in Geneva against the Czech Republic will give an excellent indication of what kind of team this is. There is talent certainly but it remains to be seen if Turkey have the steel to go all the way.\n\nCoach Fatih Terim was a defensive rock during his time as a player with the national team and while he has added steel to the back-line, it is still capable of switching off from time to time.\n\nStill, if the team can recapture the form and euphoria that accompanied the 4-1 qualification victory at the home of European champions Greece in March 2007 then they could spring a few surprises.\n\nAvoiding the real big boys at the group stage means that confidence is high on the Bosphorous and expectations are too.\n\nKey player: Nihat Kahveci\n\nThe Villareal striker is as technical as they come and is looking to make his name on the continental stage. Just before the 2002 World Cup, the diminutive player joined Real Sociedad and was soon in action in the Champions League. He's prolific in Spain and while he hasn't quite hit the same heights for the national team, that could change this summer.\n\nOne to watch: Gokdeniz Karadeniz\n\nAt 28, the playmaker is just starting to establish himself as one of his country's brightest talents and is looking forward to a shot at his first major tournament. After spending the best part of a decade by the Black Sea with Trabzonspor, Gokdeniz recently made a big-money move to ambitious Russian club Rubin Kazan. Has recovered his form and his place in the national team after a betting scandal in 2005.\n\nCoach\n\nFatih Terim has been enjoying his second spell in the Turkish hotseat since 2005. The former AC Milan and Fiorentina boss has happy memories of the continental competition as he was the first man to achieve qualification in 1996.\n\nRecent Previous Tournaments\n\n1996: Round One\n\n2000: quarter-final\n\n2004: Did not qualify\n\nSoccerphile says .....\n\nIt is doable but unlikely. Turkey have recent history with Switzerland and there are some scores to settle but playing a host is never easy. Portugal and the Czechs are the favourites and it is difficult to see the Turks in the last eight.\n\nEuro 2008 Squad"
