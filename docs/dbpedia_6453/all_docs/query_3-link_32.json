        "text": "Positive Messages\n\nsome\n\nProcessing grief comes in many different forms. People can change their ways for the better and try to make amends for past mistakes. Care must be taken to ensure kids -- particularly those from underserved communities -- don't slip through the cracks of the social and educational systems. Some criminal behavior such as stealing and selling bicycles.\n\nPositive Role Models\n\nsome\n\nTwelve-year-old Georgie is incredibly independent for her age. She is brave and intuitive, able to fend for herself in light of her mother's passing. She processes her grief by clinging to fantastical things to try and take her mind off the harsh reality. But she does use her charm and ingenuity to con for wrongdoing, such as convincing social services that she has a guardian present when she actually lives alone. Her father, Jason, abandoned her when she was a baby. He now wants to make amends and is caring. He shows her tough love, but it's well-received.\n\nParents need to know that Scrapper is an enchanting British comedy-drama that deals with serious themes, such as a child processing the untimely death of her mother. Twelve-year-old Georgie (Lola Campbell) is fiercely independent for her age. She is intelligent and uses her charm and ingenuity to get what she wants, including misleading social services into thinking she lives with a guardian following her mother's death from cancer. She also commits crimes, such as stealing and selling bikes -- in one scene her estranged father, Jason (Harris Dickinson), even helps her. Yet despite this, you always remain on her side. There is some violence in the form of a fistfight Georgie has with another young girl from her area, which results in some bruising. Set in a deprived area of London, the film is notable for its strong and authentic representation of an underserved community. In addition, Georgie is hard of hearing and wears a hearing aid throughout the film. Her closest friend is a young boy named Ali (Alin Uzun), who is a Muslim of Arabic descent.
