        "text": "If I was a studio exec, there are two reasons why I would green light Last Vegas. Firstly it’s a buddy movie in Vegas which younger people will flock to, and secondly it’s an older A-list cast which old people will flock to. It was a smart move for CBS Films and Universal as the theater was jam-packed with people of all ages. However the film itself failed to live up to the expectations set by a sold out screening. It was watchable, but not more than once.\n\nLast Vegas is pretty straightforward – Michael Douglas is the wealthy businessman engaged to a thirty something, so he ropes his three childhood friends into a bachelor party in Vegas. Old wounds are exposed and relationships are tested, but generally this is a film rammed with jokes about how old they are and how young Douglas’ fiance is. This is of course a film about rediscovering youth and challenging old person stigma.\n\nIts most redeeming feature is, understandably, the cast. Robert De Niro, Kevin Kline, Douglas and Morgan Freeman are clearly enjoying themselves throughout the making of this movie, and it shines through to add an endearing charm. You believe they were friends for 60 years, and had they not achieved this the film would have been a mess. Though this is very much about the relationship and interaction between the four it is Kevin Kline who puts in the strongest performance.\n\nThis is not a film that will win Oscars. It seems baffling that they would release Last Vegas at such a competitive time of year, but rather than thinking this could be a genuine awards contender, they perhaps thought it would offer some light relief when cinemas are flooded with intense period dramas, and they were right. This is a fun watch, and it will make you laugh, but you probably won’t go buying the DVD until it’s in the bargain bins."
