What is the French New Wave, anyway?\n\nFrancois Truffaut directing. .\n\nThe Nouvelle Vague: A Beginner's Guide\n\nThe directors associated with the Nouvelle Vague, including Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Louis Malle, Alain Resnais, Agnes Varda and Jacques Demy have made, between them, films numbering in the many hundreds. (For reference, you can see the New Wave Encyclopedia for films we consider to be a part of the French New Wave.) If you were to add to this the works of those various filmmakers of the era who have been labelled as New Wave at one time or another, as well as those influenced by the movement, both in France and abroad, then the number of potential films would run into the thousands.\n\nGetting to grips with the New Wave might understandably therefore seem a daunting prospect for somebody wanting to explore the movement for the first time. With that in mind, this introduction will provide some general context and a brief overview of some of the characteristics associated with the French New Wave. It will also offer some suggestions about where to start your investigations, as well as an overview of the seminal \"must see\" films which best define the movement. If youâve already seen many of the best known New Wave films, or are looking for a more specific approach, you might try our Top 10 New Wave Film Lists, which drill down by director, sub-genre, performance and various other categories.\n\nBreathless, dir. Jean-Luc Godard [1960] .\n\n.\n\nFifty years on: Why the New Wave Still Matters\n\nIt has now been more than half a century since the directors of the New Wave (in French, \"Nouvelle Vague\") electrified the international film scene with their revolutionary new way of telling stories on film. The New Wave itself may no longer be \"new\", but the directors and their films are still important. They are the progenitors of what we have come to think of as alternative cinema today, and they had, and continue to have, a profound influence on cinema and popular culture throughout the world. Without the Nouvelle Vague there may not have been any Scorsese, Soderbergh, or Tarantino (or Forman, or Wenders, or Bertolucci), and music, fashion and advertising would be without a major point of reference.\n\nThe directors of the Nouvelle Vague, and those of their like-minded contemporaries in other countries, created a new cinematic style, using breakthrough techniques and a fresh approach to storytelling that could express complex ideas while still being both direct and emotionally engaging. Crucially, these filmmakers also proved that they didn't need the mainstream studios to produce successful films on their own terms. By emphasizing the personal and artistic vision of film over its worth as a commercial product, the Nouvelle Vague set an example that inspired others across the world. In every sense they were the true founders of modern independent film and to watch them for the first time is to rediscover cinema.\n\nA Radical New Type of Filmmaking\n\nTo get a general idea of what this new cinematic approach meant, it might help to understand that before they were directors, the main players of the New Wave were the original film geeks or cinephiles. Cinema was very important in culture-starved post-war France, and most of the New Wave directors spent a great deal of time in their early years writing or thinking about it. Some were film critics, some were simply lovers of film - nearly all sharpened their cinematic sensibilities through long hours spent in the various Parisian cinematheques and film clubs. Their influences included everything from movies by realist Italian directors like Roberto Rosselini to hard-boiled Noir and B movies from America, as well as early silent classics and even the latest technicolour Hollywood musicals. From this passion for cinema they developed a belief in the theory of the auteur: that is, a conviction that the best films are the product of a personal artistic expression and should bear the stamp of personal authorship, much as great works of literature bear the stamp of the writer.\n\nUne Femme Est Une Femme, dir. Jean-Luc Godard [1961] .\n\nAlthough they admired many of the studio films being made at the time, they also felt that most mainsteam cinema, especially in France, was not expressing human life, thought, and emotion in a genuine way. Many of the popular movies of the era, they argued, were dry, recycled, inexpressive and out of touch with the daily lives of post-war French youth.\n\nWhile the Nouvelle Vague may never have been a formally organized movement, its filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of the \"cinéma de qualité\" (\"cinema of quality\"), the studio-bound, script-centered cinema that dominated the French filmscape at the time. Besides being made to impress rather than express, these films generally afforded their directors very little freedom or creative control, instead catering to the commercial whims of producers and the influence of screenwriters. Those New Wave directors who started as critics, mainly writing for the French journal called Cahiers du Cinema, regularly praised the films they loved and tore apart those films they hated in print. Through the process of judging the art of cinema, they began to think about what it was that might make the medium special. More importantly they were gradually inspired to begin making films themselves. While each director had a slightly different agenda, Truffaut could be said to encapsulate the group's mission when he said, \"The film of tomorrow will not be directed by civil servants of the camera, but by artists for whom shooting a film constitutes a wonderful and thrilling adventure.\"\n\nBroadly speaking, the New Wave rejected the idea of a traditional story in the \"Old Hollywood\" sense of stories based on narrative styles and structures lifted from earlier media, namely books and theatre. The New Wave directors did not want to hold your hand through each scene, directing you emotion by emotion, through a fixed narrative. There was a feeling that this sort of storytelling interfered with the viewer's ability to perceive and react to film just as they would perceive and react to life. These directors wanted to break up the filmic experience, to make it fresh and exciting, and to jolt the moviegoer out of complacent viewing - to make the viewer think and feel, not only about what they were watching, but about their own lives, thoughts and emotions as well. Dialogue was to be as realistic and spontaneous as possible, or philosophical in a way that made one think beyond the film. Expressing the truth was of the utmost importance. The object was not simply to entertain, it was to sincerely communicate.\n\nThe scripts (or lack thereof) of these new directors were often revolutionary, but the films' modest budgets often forced them to become technically inventive as well. As a result, the movies of the Nouvelle Vague have became known for certain stylistic innovations such as: jump cuts (a non-naturalistic edit), rapid editing, shooting outdoors and on location, natural lighting, improvised dialogue and plotting, direct sound recording (as opposed to the dubbing that was popular at the time), mobile cameras, and long takes. In addition, their films often engaged, although sometimes indirectly, with the social and political upheavals of their times. You can read a more in-depth history of the French New Wave in our history article.\n\nNew Wave International\n\nThe Firemen's Ball, dir. Czech New Wave director Milos Forman [1967] .\n\nAlthough the French New Wave is the best known, similar cinematic movements were happening elsewhere, also fuelled by the cultural and social change that came in the wake of the Second World War. In Britain, the emergence of the Free Cinema movement in the 1950âs paralleled the course of the French New Wave. The first productions of these filmmakers, who included Lindsay Anderson, Tony Richardson and Karel Reisz, were documentaries chronicling working-class life that had a freshness, energy and modern satirical edge. These qualities were also characteristic of their subsequent feature films, many of which were adapted from the plays and novels of the so called âAngry Young Menâ writers.\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in Europe, the French and British New Waves inspired groups of like-minded young directors in Communist-controlled Czechoslovakia (Milos Forman, Vera Chytilova , Ivan Passer) and Poland (Roman Polanski, Jerzy Skolimowski). Shooting on location, often using non-professional actors, they sought to capture life as it was really lived in their societies. In Italy too, young directors making their first films such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Marco Bellocchio were directly inspired by the Nouvelle Vague. The same was true of a new generation of German directors, including Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog, who emerged at the end of the 1960s and came to be known as the New German Cinema.\n\nRevolutionary film movements also arose in Japan and Brazil where directors like Nagisa Oshima and Glauber Rocha made films devoted to questioning, analyzing, critiquing and upsetting social conventions. Indeed, in countries around the world, young filmmakers armed with hand-held cameras and ideas inspired by the Nouvelle Vague were making films on their own terms. All had their own particular flavour, but in each case, came into being as a reaction against what had come before and arose out of the feeling that such breaks in tradition were necessary to the positive evolution of cinema in their country.\n\nPulp Fiction, dir. Quentin Tarantino [1994] .\n\nEven the United States, the very heartland of commercial cinema, had its own New Wave lead by actor turned filmmaker John Cassavetes, who blazed a trail for independent American cinema with films like Shadows (1959) and Faces (1968), which bore remarkable similarities to the work of the French New Wave. Equally groundbreaking was the work of the Direct Cinema documentary movement lead by Richard Leacock, D.A. Pennebaker and the Maysles brothers who applied similar techniques to the New Wave and the French Cinema VeritÃ© filmmakers in an effort to directly capture reality and represent it truthfully."
