        "text": "Do you make any age/grade exceptions?\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to make any age/grade exceptions, for any reason, for all Summer Studio classes.\n\nWill you be holding auditions?\n\nYes. Auditions will be held during the first two days of each Summer Studio workshop. All registered students will be cast in a role. Students will be guided through the audition process as a part of the class.\n\nMy family has conflicts, can we still register?\n\nIf your student is going to miss more than 2 days of Summer Studio, we do not recommend registering. It is a fast process, and for your student to have the most optimal experience, it is best for them to attend all days of the class. We will be asking for conflicts during the first week of the class, and conflicts will influence casting decisions.\n\nWill each student be “called to” (attend) class each day?\n\nYes. Summer Studio is first and foremost a class, and therefore is designed to engage students each day of the session.\n\nIs there a “pre-requisite” for Summer Studio classes?\n\nThere is not a pre-requisite, however we do not recommend registering for Summer Studio if this is your young person’s first theatre class/camp experience. If this is your student’s first theatre experience (class or performance), we recommend a one-week Summer Theatre Workshop.\n\nAre payment plans available?\n\nYes, Summer Theatre Workshop tuition can be split into a payment plan by calling the Box Office at 952-979-1111"
