        "text": "All Films\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial)\n\nSpecial Screening\n\nSynopsis\n\nOne of the most enduringly popular films ever made, Steven Spielberg’s ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’ was a runaway box-office hit when it first hit the big screen in 1982, and was the world’s top-grossing film for a decade. When he is accidentally abandoned on Earth, an alien scientist from another world takes refuge in a suburban home, where he is protected from meddling government agencies by Elliott and his siblings. Dubbed ‘E.T.’ by the youngsters, the alien soon discovers that he cannot stay alive in Earth’s atmosphere, so with some low-tech assistance from his new friends, he sets out to create a device that will allow him to contact his spaceship and go home. Thirty years after its release, this endearing story of a very special intergalactic friendship retains all of its heartfelt charm.\n\nAbout the Directors\n\nBorn in 1946 and a household name since the release of his fourth feature, ‘Jaws’, in 1975, Steven Spielberg has been a key player in the cinema of the last three decades. Key films include ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind’ (1977), ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ (1981), ‘The Color Purple’ (1985), ‘Schindler’s List’ (1993), ‘Saving Private Ryan’ (1998), ‘Minority Report’ (2002) and ‘War Horse’ (2011). His latest film, ‘Lincoln’, recently opened in the US.\n\nCredits\n\nDirector\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nScreenwriter\n\nMelissa Mathison\n\nProducer\n\nKathleen Kennedy, Melissa Mathison, Steven Spielberg\n\nEditor\n\nCarol Littleton\n\nMusic\n\nJohn Williams\n\nCinematographer\n\nAllen Daviau\n\nCast\n\nDee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton"
