Jury statement: “The documentary jury awards a film that bravely and fearlessly investigates the misuse of the internet to encourage hate and bias by allowing media giants to profit and foster the continuation of the outrage. On trial are first amendment freedoms that have been violated for profit.”\n\nSpecial Jury Mention for a Documentary Feature: Made in Ethiopia, directors Xinyan Yu, Max Duncan (United States, Canada, Ethiopia, Denmark, Korea, United Kingdom) - World Premiere. Jury statement: “For its multi-faceted exploration of the personal and collective cost of today’s face of globalization, we award the Special Jury Mention to MADE IN ETHIOPIA.

Jury statement: “At this difficult moment in the world’s history - we commend the filmmakers and editors ability to craft a narrative with clarity and urgency - and to ring alarm bells for the consequences of vicious attacks on journalists. For its crisp and compelling narrative.”\n\nBEST NEW NARRATIVE DIRECTOR AWARD\n\nThis award is presented by Canva\n\nNnamdi Asomugha for The Knife (United States) - World Premiere. Jury Statement: “This film lingered with us long after the screening, nagging our imaginations about the characters’ futures, calling into question our own biases and beliefs, filtering the world through a lens that is painfully familiar to some of us and foreign to others. To be able to shed light on universal themes and craft exquisitely detailed characters is one thing but to do it in the form of a contained dramatic thriller that is an entertaining nail-biter is no small feat. This filmmaker showed immense confidence in his ability to harness the audience's reactions to tension, to turn an empathic eye to characters often relegated to the sidelines, to showcase ambiguous moral situations, to tackle race and class--all in the form of a taut and marketable thriller was exciting.”\n\nTo be able to shed light on universal themes and craft exquisitely detailed characters is one thing but to do it in the form of a contained dramatic thriller that is an entertaining nail-biter is no small feat.

Jury statement: “This film had the audience in the palm of its hand from the first minute. It straddled the very thin line between heartwarming, tragic, hilarious and awkward. It fills a void in the marketplace for films that touch on sophisticated themes while remaining family friendly. Never pandering, always fresh, full of relatable universal experiences while being incredibly specific and nuanced--this film also features a breakout performance from a young exciting newcomer! The director of this film made one of the funniest films of the year and we cannot wait to see where he goes next.”\n\nALBERT MAYSLES AWARD FOR BEST NEW DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR\n\nDebra Aroko and Nicole Gormley for Searching for Amani (Kenya) - World Premiere. Jury statement: “Exquisitely crafted with a taut narrative, this documentary paints a nuanced portrait of issues that often are ignored or worse unknown by those outside of a community. It is extremely difficult to take a topic that affects the world, and to tell a story about that topic in an intimate and personal fashion that is both subversive and charming. So much of the success of a documentary is based on its main character, and the passion, curiosity, and relentlessness of 13 year old Simon Ali was awe inspiring.”\n\nSpecial Jury Mention for New Documentary Director: Elizabeth Ai for New Wave (United States) - World Premiere. Jury statement: “Loss, identity, the unspoken longing of mothers and daughters, fathers and sons pulsing and animated by an 80s soundtrack. This raw portrait of the American Vietnamese COMMUNITY is a story we’ve never seen before, where music becomes a way to escape from the old and belong to the new. For her powerful, evocative and emotionally honest storytelling.”\n\nVIEWPOINTS AWARD\n\nViewpoints Award: Come Closer, director Tom Nesher (Israel) - World Premiere. Jury statement: “From alien abductions, to a ski team in Afghanistan, to a young man investigating the murder of his father, the diverse films of the Viewpoint category inspired all of us to think and feel deeply. However, when choosing a winner, our decision was unanimous. This film pulled us all in from the first few frames and we felt that we were in skillful hands as it is fiercely executed and superbly performed.”\n\nSpecial Jury Mention for Viewpoints: Witches, director Elizabeth Sankey (United Kingdom) - World Premiere. Jury statement: “Our honorable mention, another unanimous winner, explores the taboo subject of women’s mental health during and after pregnancy. Expertly crafted through the lens of cinema and witchcraft, we hope everyone will get a chance to see WITCHES by Elizabeth Sankey.”\n\nNORA EPHRON AWARD\n\nAna Guevara and Leticia Jorge for Don't You Let Me Go (Uruguay) - World Premiere. Jury Statement: “We (the jury) loved this poignant, life-affirming film that celebrates love and female friendships. We were moved and delighted by how the film beautifully honors the experiences of grief and life’s most special moments.”\n\nHUMAN / NATURE AWARD\n\nDust to Dust (Japan) - International Premiere.\n\nSHORTS COMPETITION\n\nBest Narrative Short: Ripe!, director Tusk (United States, Spain) - World Premiere. Jury statement: “For beautifully capturing the raw and realistic essence of a teen summer romance and containing extraordinary performances that bring to life the bittersweet charm of youthful love; and for immersing the audience in the evocative feeling of summer in every scene.”\n\nSpecial Jury Mention for Narrative Short: Alarms, director Nicolas Panay (France) - New York Premiere. Jury statement: “For empathetically portraying the dangers of burnout with excellent performances, sound design and editing; and effectively shedding light on how overwhelming stress in our lives can lead us to overlook the most important things.”\n\nBest Documentary Short: Makayla’s Voice: A Letter to the World, director Julio Palacio (United States) - New York Premiere. Jury statement: “For the grace with which it showed the gratitude and joy of parents unlocking the brilliance of their autistic daughter, and for how it showcased her extraordinary, once hidden talent, we chose Mikayla’s Voice.”\n\nBest Animated Short: In the Shadow of the Cypress, directors Shirin Sohani and Hossein Molayemi (Iran) - New York Premiere. Jury statement: “For using a distinctive visual style, unique imagery and exceptional sound design to bring to life a poignant family relationship, characterized by love and protection amidst an effective portrayal of the profound impact of PTSD on both the individual and those around them”\n\nSpecial Jury Mention for Animated Short: Budō, directors Amanda Aagard and Alexander Toma (Sweden) - International Premiere. Jury statement: “With appreciation for its quirky and humorous narrative and capturing viewers with its remarkably intricate manner of portraying its characters and surroundings.”\n\nStudent Visionary Award: Nay Tabbara for Ebb & Flow (Lebanon, Qatar) - World Premiere. Jury Comment: “Because of how it captured the extraordinary and the ordinary in the life of a teenage girl pursuing her first kiss against a background of chaos and war.”\n\nSpecial Jury Mention for Student Visionary: Jamie Perault for Budd, Sweat & Tearz (United Kingdom) - World Premiere. Jury Statement: “For its clear-eyed and compelling portrait of resilience and innovation in the face of injustice and structural hurdles.”\n\nBest Music Video: Never Ending Song, performed by Conan Gray (United States)\n\nTRIBECA GAMES AWARD\n\nGoodnight Universe (United States) - World Premiere.\n\nJury Statement: For its original viewpoint, captivating writing, stellar acting and distinctive controls.\n\nTRIBECA AUDIO STORYTELLING COMPETITION\n\nFiction Audio Storytelling Award: The Skies are Watching . Jury statement: “Drawing from the historic past of radio drama and presenting a story that feels breathlessly of the moment, this genre-bending series brims with intrigue. Its shifting, stylish approach to the medium always kept us guessing as top-notch sound design introduced us to its cast of bewildering-yet-relatable characters. Classic and timeless meets cutting edge.”\n\nNarrative Nonfiction Audio Storytelling Award: Delejos (United States, Canada,Puerto RIco). Jury statement: “This selection offers us a vivid and imaginative journey through grief, loss and remembrance. The interweaving of the narrator’s loss with her father’s perspective on death was original and artful, and the use of tape (gathered and chosen exquisitely) gave us deep insights into the characters, and served as a compelling guide through the story. This selection struck the jury as elegant, nuanced, and powerful. It stood out in part because of its method of unfolding its thesis: through the scenes and conversations between protagonists, rather than explication via script, which made us listen a little closer to a world we don't inhabit. As a result, we were more invested in its arc and characters.”\n\nIndependent Fiction Audio Storytelling Award: Red for Revolution (United States). Jury Statement: “We found this project to be an untold story from one of the most important parts of artistic history in our country. It spoke of empowerment and activism. It also stood out to us with exciting sound design and strong performances. And when we look to where Audio Storytelling can go, this is a shining example.”\n\nIndependent Nonfiction Audio Storytelling Award: Back to the Water: More than One Octopus (South Africa, United States). Jury Statement: “This piece of narrative audio beautifully showcases the relationship between two women who grew up in the same country, but worlds apart.

With strong roots in independent film, Tribeca is synonymous with creative expression and entertainment. Tribeca champions emerging and established voices, discovers award-winning talent, curates innovative experiences, and introduces new ideas through exclusive premieres, exhibitions, conversations, and live performances.\n\nThe Festival was founded by Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff in 2001 to spur the economic and cultural revitalization of lower Manhattan following the attacks on the World Trade Center. The annual Tribeca Festival will celebrate its 23rd year from June 5–16, 2024 in New York City.\n\nIn 2019, James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems bought a majority stake in Tribeca Enterprises, bringing together Rosenthal, De Niro, and Murdoch to grow the enterprise.\n\nABOUT 2024 TRIBECA FESTIVAL PARTNERS\n\nThe 2024 Tribeca Festival is presented by OKX and with the support of our partners: AT&T, Audible, Bulleit Frontier Whiskey, Canva, CHANEL, Cisco, City National Bank, Don Julio Tequila, Easterseals Disability Services, e.l.f.
