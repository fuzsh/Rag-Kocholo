        "text": "Directed by Nancy Savoca and written by Bob Comfort, before leaving to fight in Vietnam, a group of teenagers play a game where they try to seduce the ugliest girl they can find. Starring: River Phoenix, Lili Taylor, Richard Panebianco, Anthony Clark, Mitchell Whitfield, Holly Near, Elizabeth Daily and Sue Morales.\n\nIt has to be acknowledged that reading the synopsis of Dogfight in today’s landscape, sounds intensely cold and misogynistic, it goes to Nancy Savoca and Bob Comfort’s credit that even if you massively object to its plot, you can still enjoy it to the fullest extent. A lot of that is because they do a fantastic job of capturing the immaturity and youth of these young men, it’s never tinged with distaste or resentment. Instead, what Savoca and Comfort create would fit well alongside films like Before Sunrise or Adventureland, indie and slightly offbeat with plenty of charm.\n\nIn no small part due to the performances from River Phoenix and Lili Taylor, there’s something so pure and organic to their connection that you can’t help but to be drawn to it. They both create these sweet, smart but slightly lost characters who are easy to invest in and entertaining. The way that their entanglement develops flows so well, it’s a wholesome evening of wandering and talking, each opening up the other into a vulnerable place, and creating a lasting bond.\n\nAll of those qualities Phoenix and Taylor create, particularly their youthfulness are instilled in Nancy Savoca’s direction. It has an understated and pensive style which is satisfying to watch unfold. The restoration work helps to even further embrace its humble personality and warmth. The only weak point is its ending which can feel slightly rushed or unfinished, not letting things play out as far as the audience might hope.\n\nDogfight is an unexpected gem, River Phoenix and Lili Taylor are sweet, endearing and a joy to watch. They give such layered and compelling performances that elevate the film beyond simple romance yet it never feels complicated. They’re perfectly matched by Nancy Savoca’s direction, which does an excellent job of capturing their youth but also their kindness, curiosity and intelligence.\n\nVerdict: ✯✯✯✯ | 8/10\n\nNew 2K Digital Restoration Releasing on Blu-ray as Part of the Criterion Collection in the UK on 6 May"
