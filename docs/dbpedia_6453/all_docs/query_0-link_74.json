        "text": "An audience watching a fragment of the TV series The Awakening Age at the Centennial Lecture Hall of Peking University, on April 20, 2021.\n\nGreat yet Ordinary\n\nIn the TV series, Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, Lu Xun, Mao Zedong, and Zhou Enlai â the prominent scholars and thinkers, revolutionary pioneers, and passionate youth in Chinese history are portrayed in vivid lifelike performances. Their pursuit of truth and exploration for a way to lead China out of backwardness is the epitome of early dissemination of Marxism-Leninism theory in China.\n\nâIt breaks the stereotypes of some previous patriotic works being too serious and boring with clichÃ©d plots. Instead, it is candid about the various problems and setbacks the founding fathers encountered, offering another perspective into the CPCâs history,â said a comment on Sina Weibo, Chinaâs Twitter-like microblog. It is the unremitting efforts and pioneering spirit of the characters portrayed that has moved todayâs youth. Some young viewers even reopened history books while watching the shows to better understand them.\n\nOn Weibo, topics under the hashtag âThe Awakening Ageâ have been viewed millions of times and discussed by numerous followers. âThe images of the chosen actors seem so close to real characters,â one of them marveled. Actually, the actors made great efforts to make characters more lifelike and vivid. With the subtle production and meticulous storytelling, the series is expected to provoke deeper thinking in the audience.\n\nOn April 17, a seminar on the epic drama The Awakening Age was held in Beijing. Zhang Yongxin, director of the TV series, shared his views on the shaping of characters. For him, the art of the film and TV lies in making characters come alive. The leading actors need to understand the roles profoundly and present every dimension of their characters, showing their charm, as well as their achievements and losses. Only with authenticity and a real respect for history can the performance be convincing, said Zhang.\n\nThe series has done a great job in showing the ordinary part of great historical figures by integrating specific and subtle storytelling into the historical background. For example, Li Dazhao, one of the central founders of the CPC, was also an affectionate husband and a loving father to two children; while Chen Duxiu, a leading intellectual of the New Culture Movement and co-founder of the CPC, had always been challenged by his two adolescent sons who refused his strict parenting style. These details have made the characters more vivid, thus striking a chord with audiences.\n\nWork of Arts\n\nAs the CPC celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, Zhang said, âMaking a production that can truly reflect the spirit of the times, and the national spirit, is a big challenge but also a breakthrough.â\n\nThe production crew put great efforts into restoring the historical scenes of that time, including the atmosphere, the costumes, props, the environment, and the mental outlook of the historical figures.\n\nFrom metal buttons on the uniforms and the paper of the magazines, to the jujube trees in the courtyard and furnishings of the then ministry of foreign affairs, all the props and settings were made to the original size using the same material. The Red Building, former home of Peking University and the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, was also reproduced in the play.\n\nMoreover, the crew used many metaphors in its storytelling. When Chen Duxiu delivered the inaugural speech for New Youth Magazine at Aurora University, a private college at the time in Shanghai, an ant crawled back and forth on the microphone. The appearance of the tiny creature implies the Chinese peopleâs unremitting quest to save China in an era of tremendous changes, showing their confusion and anxiety in the historic transition.\n\nWoodcut, a popular art form among the general public at the time, helped boost the morale of the military and civilians. It was also used in the drama, symbolizing the countryâs evolution, and displaying the revolutionary spirit of the characters. The stark contrast between black and white of the art form also creates a sense of profoundness. In addition to that, the Chinese ink-painting style setting with warm colors was added in to create an idealistâs feeling of romance, highlighted with powerful cinematography techniques, which altogether perfectly presented the landscape of the times.\n\nMinning Town is a popular Chinese TV drama about the countryâs poverty alleviation endeavor, which has been favorably received by young Chinese audiences.\n\nKindling Patriotism among the Youth\n\nOn social media platforms mainly dominated by young people such as Weibo, WeChat, Douyin, and Bilibili â Chinaâs most popular streaming website, discussions on The Awakening Age continue to increase. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of topics on Weibo relating to the series has exceeded 2.3 billion. The comments have aroused the curiosity of more netizens who are eager to watch the series.\n\nThe Awakening Age is not the first patriotic drama about the CPCâs history that has been trending in the past months. Minning Town, a series released in January, tells a story about a group of young people from southeast Chinaâs Fujian Province, who devoted themselves to poverty alleviation work in northwest Chinaâs Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. It has also been favorably received. Other popular dramas include Like a Flowing River II, Roving Inspection Team, and Ideals Shine in China.\n\nWhy are these TV series popular among the young people? Zhang Bin, a professor of the Shanghai Film Academy Department at Shanghai University, responded to this query in an article written for The Wenhui Daily published on April 8, 2021. âThis kind of TV series is a mirror in which the young people see themselves, struggling and growing together with the nationâs destiny,â Zhang wrote. He noted that these TV dramas have improved from a stereotyped, even propagandized mode, to a more substantial and multidimensional format, thus gaining popularity among the young. Through subtle artistic framing, the shows successfully created artistic space where dialogues of ideas and thinking with the youth are possible."
