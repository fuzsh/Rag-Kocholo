        "text": "Sandra Bullock (born July 26, 1964, Arlington, Virginia, U.S.) is an American actress and film producer known for her charismatic energy and wit onscreen, especially as girl-next-door characters in romantic comedies.\n\nBullock spent most of her childhood in Nürnberg, West Germany, though she often traveled with her mother, who was a German opera singer, and occasionally performed in her mother’s productions. Bullock attended high school in Virginia, and she later studied drama at East Carolina University. In 1986 she moved to New York, where she studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. After receiving positive attention for the Off-Broadway play No Time Flat, Bullock made her motion-picture debut in Hangmen (1987) and took supporting roles in such films as Religion, Inc. (1989) and the television movie Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989). Her first leading role was in Who Shot Pat? (1989), a romantic coming-of-age film that examines racial tensions in the 1950s. In 1990 Bullock starred in the short-lived TV series Working Girl, playing an ambitious New York City executive.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nIn 1992 Bullock displayed her earnest charm in the romantic comedy Love Potion No. 9. This led to a series of films the following year, including the thriller The Vanishing; Demolition Man, in which she starred alongside action star Sylvester Stallone, and the drama Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. Her big breakthrough, however, was the thriller Speed (1994), about a policeman (played by Keanu Reeves) who, with the assistance of a plucky passenger (Bullock), must deactivate a bomb on a bus. In 1996 Bullock earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance in the romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping (1995). Seeking parts outside her typical romantic comedy roles, she appeared in the thriller The Net (1995); A Time to Kill (1996), based on the legal novel of the same name by best-selling author John Grisham; and In Love and War (1996), a drama about Ernest Hemingway’s wartime romance that inspired his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).\n\nIn the late 1990s Bullock founded the production company Fortis Films, which in 1998 produced the romantic drama Hope Floats and the comedy Practical Magic; Bullock starred in both movies. That same year her voice was featured in the animated The Prince of Egypt. She returned to familiar territory as an endearing but eccentric lead in the romantic comedy Forces of Nature (1999), opposite Ben Affleck. In 2000 her performance in 28 Days was praised, as she balanced humour with vulnerability to portray a writer and party girl who is sent to rehabilitation. Later that year Bullock had a box office hit with Miss Congeniality, a comedy in which she played an FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty pageant contestant.\n\nContinuing to pursue work in all genres of film, she starred as a homicide detective in Murder by Numbers (2002), as a playwright who has a difficult relationship with her mother in Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002), and as an underappreciated lawyer in Two Weeks Notice (2002). She later appeared as the racist wife of a Los Angeles district attorney in the critically acclaimed Crash (2004). Bullock took another serious role when she portrayed the American author Harper Lee in Infamous (2006), a biopic about writer Truman Capote. In 2006 she reunited with Reeves in The Lake House, a romance about two people who fall in love by sending letters forward and backward in time.\n\nIn 2009, after appearing in the romantic comedies The Proposal and All About Steve, Bullock starred as a determined mother in the sports drama The Blind Side; she won numerous accolades for her performance, including an Academy Award for best actress. Another maternal role followed in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), a film about a boy coping with the death of his father in the September 11 attacks. In 2013 Bullock earned laughs as half of a mismatched pair of female FBI agents in the broad, raunchy comedy The Heat. Later that year she starred with George Clooney in Gravity, an acclaimed drama about astronauts struggling to survive after their spacecraft has been destroyed; Bullock earned an Oscar nomination for her performance. She then voiced the villainous Scarlett Overkill in the animated comedy Minions and depicted the struggles of an American political strategist guiding a Bolivian presidential campaign in the dark farce Our Brand Is Crisis (both 2015)."
