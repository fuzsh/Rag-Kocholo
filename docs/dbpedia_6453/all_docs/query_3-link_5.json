        "text": "All I really knew when I settled into “Young Woman and the Sea” was that it would explore the story of Gertrude “Trudy” Ederle, the first woman to successfully swim the English Channel.\n\nI knew essentially nothing about her beforehand, other than the passing knowledge that someone at some point in time must have done it.\n\nI didn't know her hearing was damaged from barely surviving having measles as a child, or that by her 20th birthday she held almost as many world records as the years she'd been alive.\n\nI had no idea she had to make two attempts to cross the channel, because the first time around she was pulled from the water early by her coach, whom she suspected of sabotaging her with dosed tea. And I definitely didn't know that not only was she the sixth person to ever complete the 21-mile swim from France to England, but that she shaved almost two hours off the held record, permanently altering the course of women's athletics.\n\nScreenwriter Jeff Nathanson does an excellent job adapting Glenn Stout's comprehensive biography, which was published in 2009 and is also where the movie pulls its title from. Though some events are condensed and Nathanson adds the occasional narrative flourish (the soundtrack’s weaponizing of nonstop ukulele is adorable), he and director Joachim Rønning (“Kon Tiki,” “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales”) rarely stray from fact, keeping respectfully close to historical accounts of Ederle's early life and career.\n\nRønning’s thoughtful direction takes great care in balancing the historical, biographical and thematic elements of Trudy's story without losing perspective the “Queen of the Sea” herself. In particular, the choice to bookend the film with two instances, decades apart, of a subdued Ederle family waiting long into a dark night for news of their youngest daughter's well being. This was particularly impactful, each sequence made all the more resonant with Oscar Faura's evocative cinematography and Una Ni Dhonghaile's tactful editing.\n\nDaisy Ridley (“The Force Awakens,” etc.) is mesmerizing as Trudy, her grounded portrayal a crucial anchor for the movie, capturing a charm and gumption that permeates each scene.\n\nEven in those atmospheric swimming sequences, when her eyes are mostly obscured by goggles and her face half submerged in water, Ridley never loses “Trudy,” her physicality bristling with determination and effort. The talented supporting cast deliver similarly excellent performances, especially Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Jeanette Hain, Kim Bodnia, and Lily Aspell.\n\nContemplative, inspiring and sometimes harrowing “Young Woman and the Sea” is a stunning glimpse into the incredible life of Gertrude Ederle, a woman whose name I can't believe I didn't know before.\n\nKatie Wigglesworth is an original member of the Petaluma Screen Team. You can find her reviews in the Argus-Courier every other week or so."
