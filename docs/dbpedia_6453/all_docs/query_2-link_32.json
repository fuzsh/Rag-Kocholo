        "text": "by Oscar Winning Barry Morrow (“Rain Man”), starring 2018 Emmy Winning Darren Criss (“The Assassination of Gianni Versace” and “Glee”) and Madalina Ghenea, “Miss Universe” in the Oscar nominated film “Youth” by Paolo Sorrentino\n\nThis charming and endearing, modern fairy tale presents a clash of the “big city way of living” with ” Italian country style” when a New York City fashion mogul sends his son Tyler (Darren Criss) to Milan to take care of a business deal, hoping the trip will inspire his son to take over the family empire.\n\nPlans go terribly wrong when Tyler gets kidnapped for ransom by a group of inept Mafioso who end up taking him to the wrong hideaway – an enchanted Italian cottage called “Sarbolai” in the lush, rolling hills above Piano. The kidnappers’ scheme has a startling twist when each of the men becomes caught in a strange enchantment causing them to fall hopelessly in love with the first soul to meet his eyes.\n\nWhile the Mafiosi get swept off their feet by hysterical and unfortunate choices, Tyler’s sets his eyes on the beautiful Rosalia (“Miss Universe”) who flatly refuses to do anything with him. Thus, the comic and romantic pursuits begin!\n\nAll You Ever Wished For is a film that delivers on its title! Beautiful Italian countryside, food, love, comedy, and a magical charm that will capture your romantic imagination."
