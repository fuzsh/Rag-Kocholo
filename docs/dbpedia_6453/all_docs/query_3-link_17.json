        "text": "Aspiring filmmakers worldwide enroll in programs abroad to experience life and adventure in another country. These programs are “significant for aspiring filmmaking and acting students because immersing oneself in a different country’s culture provides fresh perspectives on the film crafts, and offers new insights and inspirations for students’ projects,” says Jim Miller, NYFA’s Vice President of Strategic Initiatives.\n\nOne of these avenues is study abroad programs. “A significant number of international students enroll in NYFA’s abroad programs, ensuring that U.S. students do not remain in an American “bubble” as they might in other study abroad programs, and fosters valuable connections that can benefit one’s future career in the global creative industries,” Miller adds. “The international experience offers students enhanced life skills, storytelling abilities, and presentation confidence.”\n\nBest Films about Cultural Shock, Experiences, and Exploration\n\nFor students prepping to study abroad or still exploring their options, exposure to new cultural experiences can start at home.
