        "text": "Direction: Hong Sang-soo\n\nCountry: South Korea\n\nKorean director Hong Sang-soo's 30th feature, In Our Day, is a breezy, minor effort that may not be particularly thought-provoking but is deeply explorative of life and art. With his trademark understated style, Hong once again embraces simplicity, allowing the melancholy undertones of the film to ebb and flow without pointing toward any specific destination.\n\nIn Our Day seems to carry an autobiographical touch, presenting two parallel stories that involve established artists and their younger admirers, who are curious about their careers and perspectives. The film’s naturalistic staging, dialogue, and human interactions lean toward minimalism, yet there are subtle but significant details woven throughout. It’s a double moral tale that gets the form of a plotless slow burn, stripped of complexity and anchored by serene performances from an ensemble cast that makes it as breezy as a stroll in Central Park.\n\nHong himself frames the film with meticulous attention to image composition, adding a layer of visual care that compensates for the film’s modest ambitions. In Our Day may not be mind-blowing in its ideas, but it radiates warmth and gentle humor. It's a human and occasionally touching film, though it demands patience from viewers, asking them to find pleasure in the small moments and connect with its characters, a task that may not always come easily.\n\nDirection: Annie Baker\n\nCountry: USA\n\nThe feature debut of filmmaker Annie Baker, Janet Planet, is an absorbing drama that deserves your attention. Set in rural Massachusetts in 1991, the film poignantly captures the emotional complexities and uncertainty of a volatile single mother (Julianne Nicholson), who works as an acupuncturist, and her lonely, highly dependent 11-year-old daughter (Zoe Ziegler). Their lives are momentarily altered by the arrival of three different people, leading to a story that is both patiently observant and ultimately caustic. The film provides an unnervingly naturalistic look at a teen's life, anchored by convincing central performances, with the potent chemistry between the mother and daughter being crucial to the film’s success.\n\nJanet Planet earns its dramatic moments through strong writing, unexpected outcomes, and a nice restraint. The film effectively contrasts the maturity found in some of the conversations between mother and daughter with the imbalance of some of the mother’s choices. Despite being presented in an unhurried, episodic manner, the nearly two-hour runtime never feels sluggish. The screenplay's subtlety and quality stand out, maintaining a steady yet delightfully quirky tone throughout.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Baker has a promising career as a filmmaker and storyteller ahead of her, as all the elements are assembled with prudent sincerity, building a story that is both touching and deeply affecting. Janet Planet is a rare gem, so earnest in its approach that it resonates with a poignant, almost painful, honesty.\n\nDirection: Pawo Choyning Dorji\n\nCountry: Bhutan / other\n\nFrom Pawo Choyning Dorji, the Bhutanese director of Lunana: a Yak in the Classroom (2019), comes The Monk and the Gun, a light comedy-drama set against the backdrop of Bhutan's first democratic election. This formerly isolated monarchic country, now encountering the internet and TV for the first time, serves as the setting for a story that piques our curiosity from the start.\n\nWritten by Dorji, the story pikes our curiosity about the intention of the village’s lama who, during his meditation retreat, asks his assistant monk (Tandin Wangchuk) to bring him two guns for a mysterious ceremony scheduled for the election day. As the debate between modernizing or maintaining traditions creates friction among villagers and disruption in families, an American gun collector (Harry Einhorn) arrives in town to buy a rare old rifle, with the local Benji (Tandin Sonam) acting as the mediator.\n\nWhether seen it as an original moral tale or a modern fable, this well-tempered and didactic film remains engaging despite minor plot quibbles and occasional pacing issues. Painted with tenderness and a subtle yet delightful humor, this canvas also serves as an ode to Bhutan’s sublime landscape, celebrating pacifism and tolerance with inspiring simplicity and spiritual appeal.\n\nThe film’s peaceful, idyllic tones underscore its message of compassion and peace triumphing over suffering, hatred, and aggression. The Monk and the Gun offers a relaxing and deeply felt portrait of the Bhutanese people, with its educational value standing out as invaluable. Dorji’s perspective is bracing, and his film a serene experience.\n\nDirection: Paola Cortellesi\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nPaola Cortellesi, widely recognized in Italy as a TV presenter and comedian, as well as for her diverse roles in film, television, and theatre, makes a powerful directorial debut with There’s Still Tomorrow. This black-and-white feminist manifesto, which she co-wrote and stars in, is a bold political comedy-drama that confronts patriarchy head-on. It channels the spirit of classic Italian cinema, evoking the pink neorealism of directors like Luigi Comencini and Dino Risi, all while overflowing with style and determination.\n\nSet in the 1940s, the film strikes a delicate balance between laughs and tears as it follows the challenging life of Delia (Cortellesi), a hardworking woman who endures daily physical abuse at the hands of her obnoxious war veteran husband Ivano (Valerio Mastandrea). Instead of voicing her suffering, Delia chooses to silently endure the pain and quietly save money, all while plotting her own form of resistance.\n\nInfused with a quiet yet righteous anger, the film is caricatural in many ways, disguising the scenes of brutality with romantic songs and dancing moves. It even facilitaties a bit here and there in terms of plot, but remains compelling, vivid, and intoxicating. With its strong visuals and a crucial message of resilience and hope, this film holds nothing back—and what’s not to love about that?\n\nCortellesi shines, addressing the sensitive topic of domestic violence with tact and a deliberate avoidance of melodrama, opting instead for a slightly offbeat tone that is further enhanced by the film's anachronistic soundtrack. The surprising ending takes viewers to a completely different direction, and I was amazed how much I started to care about the main character. There’s Still Tomorrow drives home a narrative that is both deeply engaging and impactful, successfully resonating with audiences while delivering a powerful message of women’s emancipation.\n\nDirection: Alex Thompson, Kelly O'Sullivan\n\nCountry: USA\n\nGhostlight, set in Chicago, is an intimate drama that delves into themes of family, loss, art, and healing. Directed by Alex Thompson and Kelly O’Sullivan, the film stars Keith Kupferer, Katherine Mallen Kupferer, and Tara Mallen — a real-life father, daughter, and mother trio who portray the same familial roles in this fictional account.\n\nDan (Keith Kupferer), a stressed out construction worker, finds himself reluctantly drawn into a local theater company by middle-aged actress Rita (Dolly de Leon). The group is rehearsing Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, a tragedy that stirs painful memories of Dan’s own personal loss. Yet, the chance to escape into another character's life might be exactly what he needs to begin healing.\n\nThe film manages to sustain tension, though it occasionally undercuts itself by resolving conflicts too swiftly. Without trivializing the emotions involved, the filmmakers craft a poetic melodrama that doesn’t strive for perfection but rather for honesty, offering moments of piercing observation. The scope of the plot actually widens with the theatric representation, an emotional expression that further fuels the narrative.\n\nGhostlight confronts viewers with a keen understanding of the cracks that emerge in people over time as they wrestle with grief and the mysteries of life. The movie denotes a bit of formula and calculation as the directors put out a play for us — so, if you’re looking to be wowed, this may not do the trick. With that said, I still believe it’s worth checking out just for its newfound parallels and poignant exploration of human emotions.\n\nDirection: Baltasar Kormakur\n\nCountry: Iceland / UK\n\nThe work of Icelandic writer-director Baltasar Kormakur has been consistently satisfying, with 101 Reykjavik (2000), Jar City (2006), and The Deep (2012) among his notable films. His latest effort, Touch, is a serious, affecting, and ultimately surprising drama that rewards viewers with some unexpected twists.\n\nThe plot follows Kristofer (Egill Ólafsson), an aging Icelandic restaurant owner who lives alone, grappling with the gradual loss of motor skills and tricky mind. Advised by his doctor to take care of any unresolved issues while he still can, he decides to travel to London - where he studied and worked 51 years ago - and then to Hiroshima during the unsettling times of the pandemic. He’s tries to reconnect with the love of his life, Miko (Yoko Narahashi).\n\nCleanly directed and credibly acted, Touch succeeds through its idiosyncratic focus on character and relationships. The film is structured with numerous flashbacks that illuminate the urgency behind certain decisions, in a manifestation of how a particular stage of life requires you to come back to your deepest emotions. Based on Ólafur Jóhann Ólafsson’s 2022 novel of the same name, the story doesn’t offer anything breathtaking and occasionally meanders with some lengthening detours. However, it's told with a quiet intensity, featuring elegant staging and culminating in a heartfelt conclusion.\n\nTouch might be easily overlooked, but it remains a light watch, a candid representation of a profound love. It’s a pleasant surprise for fans of the genre.\n\nDirection: Ali Asgari, Alireza Khatami\n\nCountry: Iran\n\nTerrestrial Verses, a directorial collaboration between the multi-awarded Ali Asgari and Canada-based Iranian-American filmmaker Alireza Khatami, shares several thematic strings with Abbas Kiarostami’s 2002 docufiction Ten. However, while Kiarostami’s work was centered only on women, this project includes men, presenting a series of nine vignettes that expose injustice, absurdities, and intolerable abuse of power. Shot in seven days and produced by the directors at their own expense, the film captures the essence of an oppressive system through the experiences of nine ordinary citizens of Tehran interviewed by authorities.\n\nAmong the most compelling stories are a confrontational teenager punished at school for arriving with her motorcyclist boyfriend, a young woman seemingly caught driving without hijab, two shameful job interviews (one laying bare sexism and the other religion-based discrimination), and a desperate filmmaker whose work, based on true events, is censored from start to finish. It’s a fine blend of realism, cynicism, and humor.\n\nFollowing conceptual simplicity, Terrestrial Verses is minimalist in its visuals but cathartic in its dialogue. This pain-filled satire does so many things, all of them well. Opting for explicit directness, it forces the viewer to look straight into the eyes of victims of a controlling and toxic Iranian society marred by austere religious and political principles that serve only those in power. Films like these are important, denouncing oppression in the hopes of achieving freedom, in a relentlessly clever middle finger to baseless censorship. Although fictionalized, this accessible and defiant film offers enlightening insights into contemporary Iran.\n\nDirection: Minhal Baig\n\nCountry: USA\n\nMinhal Baig (Hala, 2019) wrote, directed and co-produced her third feature, We Grown Now, a poignant coming-of-age drama about two inseparable best friends who discover the joys and hardships of living in Cabrini-Green, a public housing complex in Chicago.\n\nThe year is 1992, and Malik (Blake Cameron James) and Eric (Gian Knight Ramirez) are sometimes short on food. The former lives with his single mother (Jurnee Smollett), his grandmother (S. Epatha Merkerson) - whose roots are in Tupelo, Mississippi - and a sister, while the latter lives with his widowed father and an older sister. The escalating violence in the neighborhood allows the police to enter their houses in the middle of the night without a warrant, searching for drugs and gang members. Things between Malik and Eric momentarily change when the former’s mother considers applying for a new job and moving to another city.\n\nThe meaning of home and social change are deeply embedded in this story, with the director blending tenderness and cruelty in a disillusioned atmosphere softened by true friendship and routine. Placed under the sign of adolescence with heartfelt intentions, the film also reconnects with the theme of holding onto one's origins, capturing the urgency of moving toward better conditions and the yearning for what is left behind.\n\nBaig shoots each scene with ardent attention, projecting a strange mix of innocence and awareness. Her assured direction ensures realism, bolstered by the young actors, who hold the stage with truthfulness.\n\nDirection: Jeff Nichols\n\nCountry: USA\n\nJeff Nichols (Mud, 2012; Take Shelter, 2011; Loving, 2016), who has retained his exceptional talent both as a director and storyteller, gathers a formidable cast for his new film, The Bikeriders, a crime drama inspired by the 1967 photo book of the same name by Danny Lyon. The latter accompanied a group of bikers, The Vandals from Chicago, from the mid-sixties to the early seventies.\n\nPlaying central roles, we have Jodie Comers, who absolutely marvels here, Austin Butler, and Tom Hardy. They are competently supported by Michael Shannon (in his sixth collaboration with Nichols), Mike Faist as the photographer and interviewer, and Damon Herriman. The well-imagined plot follows the members of a motorcycle club that gradually turns into a violent gang of thugs, signaling a significant change in times.\n\nThe Bikeriders desperately wants to say something about a lost America, a golden era that is gone forever. It leads to a lacerating conclusion but refuses to abandon the ray of hope that keeps things moving forward. Shot with a retro look and posing like an old classic, the film draws inspiration from works such as Easy Rider (1969) and The Wild One (1953).\n\nWith a sparkling bright first part contrasting with a darker second, the film never feels manipulative, following a narrative path that is thoroughly engaging. Depicted with a certain nostalgia, this is a furiously lucid slice of American cinema, intelligently constructed and handsomely executed. Don’t hesitate to hit the road with these nervy fellas.\n\nDirection: Frauke Finsterwalder\n\nCountry: Germany / Austria / Switzerland\n\nThe fourth feature by German director Frauke Finsterwalder, Sisi & I, is a work of fiction inspired by historical reality. Co-written by Finsterwalder and Swiss author Christian Kracht, the film centers on the relationship between Empress Elizabeth of Austria, a.k.a. Sisi, and her last lady-in-waiting, the Hungarian Countess Irma Sztáray.\n\nLate in the 19th century, Irma (Sandra Huller) travels to the Greek island of Corfu to serve the reclusive, sometimes jubilant, sometimes moody, but often manipulative Empress (Susanne Wolff), overwhelmed by the demands of her duties. Desperate to avoid returning to court, Sisi’s constant fight against boredom is eased with cocaine elixirs, the occasional visits of her free-spirited friend, the Archduke Ludwig Viktor (Georg Friedrich), and her special bond with Irma. Yet, intense depression soon interferes with her leisure life.\n\nNot as dynamic and provocative as Marie Kreutzer’s Corsage (2022), which explores similar territory, Sisi & I strikes a balance between the classic and the modern, especially through the sets and the anachronistic soundtrack - the charm of Portishead’s trip-hop gem “Glory Box” inundating the opening scene is undeniable.\n\nIn her unflashy version, Finsterwalder chooses a common route, staging the story in her own terms and bringing some curious details into the fold. She makes a gracious, if occasionally tedious, effort to portray two frustrated women, modern for their time, who find refuge in a singular friendship. Despite its unevenness and tonal fluctuations, the film unpacks a feminist manifesto on power, sexuality, independence, allegiance, and sometimes cruelty. The sharp cinematography by Thomas W. Kiennast and the costume design by Tanja Hausner are assets, but the well-groomed film itself is a minor vehicle to deliver Huller's sober but firm performance.\n\nDirection: Radu Jude\n\nCountry: Romania\n\nAfter the polemic and somewhat superfluous Loony Porn (2021), the incredibly talented Romanian writer-director Radu Jude continues to claim a spot at the peak of contemporary cinema with Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World, another love-it-or-hate-it endeavor that places an independent young woman under relentless observation in a radically changing Bucharest.\n\nIlinca Manolache plays Angela Raducanu, an exhausted and underpaid production assistant working for an Austrian company that exploits workers and has a reputation for destroying Romanian forests for profit. Overworking to the point of risking falling asleep at the wheel, she navigates the chaotic Bucharest traffic - often filled with macho drivers - to interview handicapped people for a devious TV show. With no time for herself, she finds solace in posting provocative TikTok videos where she impersonates a man with moronic behavior and lousy ideas. Two key moments of the film include a frank conversation with her boss, Doris Goethe (Christian Petzold’s muse Nina Hoss), and an encounter with the wishy-washy German filmmaker Uwe Boll (himself).\n\nUsing footage, the film creates a link with Angela Merge Mai Departe, a 1981 feminist Romanian feature directed by Lucian Bratu, centered on a female taxi driver under the communist dictatorship. This raffish and pertinent divertissement brings a lot of truths to light, touching on themes such as neoliberal capitalism, sexism, corruption, exploitation, resignation, and impunity in a tortured urban society that simply has no time to enjoy life.\n\nJude evokes the social realism of Jim Jarmusch and Jean-Luc Godard - creative in form, tenacious in the storytelling - and infuses a caustic humor that, cutting sharper than a knife, is often quite delicious. More jarring than sweet, Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World is an eye opener for our hectic times. A must-watch.\n\nDirection: Jane Schoenbrun\n\nCountry: USA\n\nLike in her previous feature, We're All Going to the World's Fair (2021), director Jane Schoenbrun blurs the line between reality and fantasy in I Saw the TV Glow, a depressing psychedelic trip filled with mind-inducing eeriness and ambiguity.\n\nThe narrative follows Owen (Justice Smith), a 7th-grade teenager living in the suburbs, who becomes addicted to an obscure TV show called The Pink Opaque. His life gets less empty when he bumps into Maddy Wilson (Brigette Lundy-Paine), another obsessed fan who admits the show feels more real than real life. Suddenly, they realize they have become players in a dangerous game. Everything changes when Maddy leaves without a trace, only to return eight years later with a confused memory and a different notion of time.\n\nI Saw the TV Glow is aesthetically curious, but its disjointed ideas don’t coalesce into a satisfying whole. Schoenbrun can't avoid force-feeding us metaphors during this infinite fever dream, opting for vague contrivances rather than providing real substance. The underlying tension is constantly present but never packs a wallop. The vision is too narrow for that, transforming this experimental gimmick into a lumbering, misguided mess.\n\nThe film, co-produced by Emma Stone, aims for the bizarre but ends up more mind-numbing and emotionally deserted than clever. Paranoia and melancholy swallow aimless phosphorescent kids… is that all you’ve got to offer, Ms. Schoenbrun?\n\nDirection: Tig Notaro, Stephanie Allyne\n\nCountry: USA\n\nTig Notaro and Stephanie Allyne teamed up to direct Am I OK?, a comedy-drama centered on the anxieties and vulnerabilities of coming out later in life and the intricate paths of friendship. Written by Laura Pomerantz, the film stars Dakota Johnson and Sonoya Mizuno, who are not only convincing in their roles but often funny.\n\nLucy (Johnson) and Jane (Mizuno) are longtime best friends. Lucy works in a spa and just realized she might be gay after a a negligible, unsuccessful, and vapid number of relationships with men. Jane, promoted by her boss and ready to move to London, tries to help her friend navigate her complex affairs with an excessively self-assured temperament that is not always helpful. In the desperation of finding the path to love, things only get more confused and complicated.\n\nRadiating warmth and humor, the film’s main strength lies in two beautifully observed complementary performances, hitting the mark in its attempt to generate sympathy for the characters’ struggles. If the ending had been better imagined and less predictable, viewers would have an even stronger incentive to watch it.\n\nDirection: Bertrand Bonello\n\nCountry: France\n\nBertrand Bonnello’s intelligent time-spanning love story, The Beast, is his best film to date and my favorite of 2024 so far. Blending sci-fi, romance, drama, and dystopian thriller elements with enigmatic tones, the film, based on Henry James’ short novel The Beast in the Jungle, results in an original and purely cinematic work.\n\nThe non-linear narrative centers on the doomed love between Gabrielle Monnier (Léa Seydoux) and Louis Lewanski (George MacKay) across three different eras. In 1910, she’s a married pianist frequenting the refined Parisian artistic circles, and he’s an attentive, if cold, British admirer. in 2014, she’s a model living alone in L.A., while he’s an unstable 30-year-old American virgin tortured by rejection and frustration. The future, in 2044, is marked by absolute AI control and the availability of DNA cleanings to erase sorrows of past romances, though at the cost of possible loss of feelings. Each fragment is imbued with a tightly coiled sense of tension and repeated patterns: odd therapy sessions, consultations with clairvoyants, persistent anxieties, premonitions, and fears. An unbearable sense of loneliness also pervades.\n\nStructured with deliberate bewilderment, the film is a gallantly romantic and dangerously obsessive journey into past lives. It can fascinate us as much as get us lost. Cast and crew make the dramatic events believable, with Seydoux and MacKay delivering extraordinary performances, contributing heavily to 145 minutes of poignant, almost delirious complexity.\n\nWith shades of David Cronenberg and David Lynch, the director of Nocturama (2016) and Coma (2022) gives us something special in a ferociously pleasurable film that deserves respect for its ambition. The Beast is what it wants to be: a slice of thought-provoking, nightmarish science fiction that rewards the viewer emotionally and visually.\n\nDirection: Agnieszka Holland\n\nCountry: Poland / other\n\nWith shades of her mentor Andrzej Wajda in her filmmaking style, Polish director Agnieszka Holland (Europa, Europa, 1990; In Darkness, 2011), an important figure of the Polish New Wave movement, turns her gaze to immigration in a mesmerizing odyssey comprised of four parts. The narrative involves a Syrian family and an Afghan woman trying to cross the forest that separates Belarus from Poland, a border guard consumed by guilt, and a group of activists who welcome a psychologist turned staunch supporter of their humanitarian cause.\n\nBy filming in black and white with vision and nerve, Holland accentuates the realism of a painful crisis that exposes the worst side of human nature. Green Border is a tense affair, as dark and swampy as the forest landscapes and governments involved in its narrative, providing viewers with a disturbing scenario of racial prejudice and shocking indifference. Noble-minded in its revelatory disclosures, this tough-to-take look at the plight of migrants seeking asylum in the European Union overflows with passion, artistry, and rage in a segmented, formal structure that coheres.\n\nThe ensemble cast is solid, hitting the right emotional notes and building credibility with scenes that are Holland’s earnest attempts to bring to the world a harrowing chapter of her country’s history. The contemporary topic adds to the film’s urgent appeal in a social and political rant that, refusing to let hope go, confirms Holland as an incisive and influential filmmaker. Green Border was distinguished in seven categories in Venice, including the Special Jury Prize and Best Film in a Foreign Language.\n\nDirection: Katherine Propper\n\nCountry: USA\n\nLost Soulz, a low-key documentary-style road trip drama infused with hip-hop dreams, repressed guilt, and painful loss, marks the directorial debut of Austin-based filmmaker Katherine Propper. Featuring real-life Gen-Z dreamers, the film showcases ambition but struggles with narrative immaturity and editing issues.\n\nRapper and social media influencer Sauve Sidle portrays Sol, who leaves his unconscious, drug-addicted best friend behind to hit the road with a group of hip-hop musicians heading to West Texas. As expected, not everything goes smoothly, especially when emotional stability is fragile and drug use is involved.\n\nSol's guilt and inner conflict are not sufficiently emphasized, shifting the focus to the fun and minor tensions within the teenage group, resulting in repetitive scenes. Some characters are underdeveloped, while others stand out for their charisma. The movie’s final segment is the strongest, ending on a touching note.\n\nYou find yourself wanting to like what you see. Yet, Lost Soulz is more to be admired than enjoyed, with noticeable choppiness where fluidity was needed.\n\nDirection: Noora Niasari\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nNoora Niasari's Shayda delves into a compelling drama that draws from the Iranian-Australian director's own childhood experiences. Executive produced by Cate Blanchett and featuring Zar Amir Ebrahimi - the protagonist of Holy Spider (2022) - as the title character, the film centers on a young Iranian mother fighting for custody of her six-year-old daughter (Selina Zahednia) in Australia after enduring years of domestic violence. Seeking refuge from the aggressor, Hossein (Osamah Sami), mother and daughter find shelter in a women’s refuge.\n\nThe topic is greater than the film, which, unfolding with honesty, exposes patriarchal issues in Iranian society with familiar tones while carrying a universal appeal. An unremitting sense of anxiety pervades the realistic scenes, constantly charmed by Ebrahimi’s strong presence.\n\nShayda may feel a bit clunky in places but that can't stifle the sheer force of the emotion it evokes. Niasari's admirable feature debut serves as a tribute to her mother and all the courageous women of Iran.\n\nDirection: Michel Franco\n\nCountry: USA\n\nMexican writer-director Michel Franco, whose body of work includes After Lucia (2012) and Chronic (2015), returns with Memory, a taut, beautifully composed drama where every moment holds weight. The film traces the journey of Sylvia (Jessica Chastain), a Brooklyn-based social worker, single mother, and recovering alcoholic, who discovers a sense of solace in her strained family dynamics through her relationship with Saul (Peter Sarsgaard), a stranger grappling with early onset dementia. However, things get complicated as they grow closer.\n\nThere’s a real emotional heft to Memory as it weaves together themes of trauma, resentment, guilt, hope, and healing. Chastain and Sarsgaard give life to understated yet memorable characters with their riveting performances.\n\nAssuring that his fine narrative development leads to a positively simplistic resolution, Franco directs the film with both elemental allure and haunting familiarity. He skillfully shapes every aspect of this poignant exploration of healing love with an ultra-realistic vision and precise calibration, avoiding clichés or despair while maintaining authenticity.\n\nDirection: Bertrand Bonello\n\nCountry: France\n\nFrom the director of Nocturama (2016) and The Beast (2024), Bertrand Bonello, Coma is a challenging avant-garde drama with eerie tones and experimental flair. Matured and shot during the Covid lockdown, the film resulted as an expansion of a short film, aguishly exposing a world that is manifestly out of balance.\n\nLouise Labèque, who previously collaborated with Bonello in Zombi Child (2019), portrays a teenager whose mind wanders while confined indoors. Her interest is piqued by Patricia Coma (Julia Faure), a YouTube influencer who advertises and sells a cubical object called The Revelator, leading her to experience hypnotic, if anxious, dream states.\n\nComa isn't a film you can digest right away; it's a movie to enjoy or detest, at your leisure. While some may find it occasionally transfixing, others might struggle with its prolonged nightmarish limbo, which the film accurately portrays. It offers a radical reflection on isolation and the current state of the world, presented as an overstuffed pastiche with references to demons, possessions, psychopaths, serial killers, self-control, freewill, obscure dreams, and poignant realities.\n\nWhile its major problem lies in the excess of disparate elements, scattered techniques, and tangled ideas, which oscillate between banality and provocation, Coma remains an open work of art with something to say about a very specific and significant time for humanity.\n\nDirection: Ryusuke Hamaguchi\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nRyusuke Hamaguchi (Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, 2021; Drive My Car, 2021), known for his ability to transform simple plots into impactful films, continues to impress with his latest work, Evil Does Not Exist, a sublime ecological fable marked by tragic personal consequences. What started as a collaborative audio/visual project with composer Eiko Ishibashi, became a relevant piece of narrative fiction about how threatened our ecosystems and existences are.\n\n“Balance is the key”, claims Takumi, the protagonist of the film, portrayed by assistant director-turned-actor Hitoshi Omika. He is a single father and expert in trees and plants, living in a rural alpine region near Tokyo. When a shady company, discreditably represented by two talent agents, announces plans to build a glamping site in the area, Takumi and the local community raise concerns about environmental impacts.\n\nSculpted with vision and purpose, this uncommonly edited film warns us of the fragility of our planet as well as the greed plaguing our modern societies. The limpid and leisurely composed images are a pure treat for the eyes, exuding a heavenly sense of peace that contrasts with the imminence of danger. An impressive breadth of realistic investment doesn’t prepare you for the nearly surreal climax, in one of those finales that are not simply given but rather prompts reflection on both harmed natural environments and the volatility of human nature.\n\nThere’s a lot to drawn from Hamaguchi’s directorial sensitivity given that it’s rare to see a drama that makes such subtle sense of its subject matter. True to his style, he solidifies his position as one of the greatest filmmakers of our times."
