        "text": "The cultural show 2024 Adventures on Qixi Festival produced by Henan TV will broadcast live at 7:30 pm (GMT+8) on Aug 10. This production revolves around the eternal theme of \"love\", exploring its multifaceted aspects, from genuine affection and guardianship to mutual understanding and respect.\n\nAccording to the production team, the show features the recently internet-famous matchmaker Wang Po and weaves an engaging narrative through the storyline of Predestined to Love You, which will stir deep emotional resonance with the audience.\n\nOne highlight of the show is the song A Dream Unveiled, inspired by the Kunqu Opera The Peony Pavilion. This piece captures the essence of Kunqu's emotional undercurrents and artistic features while delving into the persistence and dreams that help define the idea of modern love.\n\nAn excerpt from the ethnic dance drama Porcelain Pillow: Family Prosperity in Harmony offers a creative and artistic interpretation of the national treasure, a baby-shaped porcelain pillow in ivory-white glaze known as hai'er zhen. The performance vividly recreates scenes of children playing in ancient times, conveying the ancient Chinese aspiration for family prosperity and a thriving lineage.\n\nThe Qixi Festival, also known as Daughter's Day, celebrates the unique ingenuity and wisdom of women. The dance Born to Drum, performed by singer Aduo, gathers traditional drums from multiple ethnic groups, highlighting the diversity and richness of China's cultural heritage while illuminating the contemporary brilliance of women.\n\nAdditionally, the program integrates a sense of contemporaneity, vitality and new trends. An excerpt from the dance drama The Beauty Xi Shi unveils the radiant feminine power unique to Xi Shi. The program features the core segment known as the \"clapper shoe dance\", a pivotal piece that showcases the eloquence of dance language combined with modern audio-visual technology.\n\nThe musical show Soar Aloft presents a unique fusion of vocal performance with parkour. Singer Jin Zhiwen, alongside his team, leads the audience on a vibrant auditory and visual journey through the bustling streets of Zhengzhou. This program imbued with youthful and dynamic visual language and employing fantastical and ingenious visual transitions, forges a special ancient city wall concert.\n\nWatch Live:"
