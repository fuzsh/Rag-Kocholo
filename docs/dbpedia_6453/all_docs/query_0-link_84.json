        "text": "Post by Torgo on\n\nWell folks, I’m no Peter Graves, but if there’s one thing in the world I know stuff about, it’s the Three Stooges.\n\nIt’s a project that I’ve been planning to do for some time, but one that I wouldn’t have been able to do until very recently, thanks to Sony’s terrific Three Stooges Collection sets, a careful eye on Turner Classic Movies, eBay and iOffer surfing, and even a few friends in the right places (I’m looking at you, skyroniter! A few of these entries wouldn’t have been possible without your help!).\n\nThe original concept was a book to be published, but I didn’t think fan sites on the web would have been strong enough a source, so call this a rough draft of a dream of mine. I present to you...\n\nNYUK\n\nA Biographic Filmography of the Three Stooges\n\n[/b][/center]\n\nAt the dawn of mankind...\n\nLegend tells of three ancient Neanderthals, related to all of man that lives today (whether you like it or not). These simple beings lived in harmony, surviving in simple ways and chasing females. One day, a bald, slightly overweight Neanderthal stole a rock his more aggressive comrade was smashing things with. Upset with his brethren, the aggressive one slapped the overweight one across the face. The third simplistic Neanderthal gave an unpleasant giggle at this event, causing the aggressive one, still annoyed, to poke him in the eye.\n\nIt was funny. And thus, humor was born.\n\nFast forwarding to present day, a group of men began slapping each other for fun. One of them wonders “Can we make a living off of doing this?”\n\nAnd the legend continues...\n\nIt all began with four men…\n\nTed Healy\n\nThe founding father of the Three Stooges, Ted Healy was a stage comedian through-and-through. Though, like most struggling vaudeville performers, the only way to earn a paycheck was to evolve from the dying vaudeville circuit and try to earn a living in motion pictures.\n\nI imagine Ted was a lot funnier on stage than he was on film, as most of his comedic work on film has unimpressed me. A lot of his improvisational and rambling dialogue doesn’t age well on film, and a constant mugging of the camera is always a source of being taken out of the moment. On stage such things are a joy, but in feature films it looks a tad sloppy.\n\nOf course, one of Ted’s faults might have been he was always standing in the way of the Three Stooges. I find myself more taken by Ted when he is either separated from the group (like in 1934’s Fugitive Lovers) or just seems to be one of the Stooges entirely (like in 1933’s Meet the Baron). Ted’s idea for his character in relation to the Stooges is clever, as he plays dimwitted man with three cohorts he has taken under his wing, probably just to make him feel superior. While the Stooges proved that they didn’t need such a character after their split with Healy, the grouping had a lot of charm.\n\nHealy, however, was only sparingly funny, in my opinion. Something his partners in comedy were far beyond, since they often went an extra mile for a laugh. Meanwhile, Ted would usually just stand there, mumbling to himself some improved dialogue that is hard to hear. I haven’t watched much of his work beyond his split from the Stooges, but I can imagine it only being better, since he doesn’t have to keep up with their energy. Healy’s performance in 1933’s Dancing Lady is a standout, showing that he had dramatic skills. Maybe the Three Stooges were holding him back, in addition to the often attributed vice versa?\n\nBorn Charles Ernest Lea Nash (his friends knew him as Lee) on October 1st, 1896, Ted grew up in Houston, Texas. Showbiz was not Ted’s first love; he instead tried his luck as being a businessman. When that didn’t pan out, Lee fully adopted the theater as his future. Ted and his childhood friend Harry Howard (latter known as Moe) joined the Annette Kellerman Diving Girls in 1912, a vaudeville act that included Ted, Moe, and two other boys who played “girls” in the act. However, after an accident on stage, the boys quit the act at the end of the summer and went their separate ways.\n\nTed continued to work in vaudeville, first starting off in blackface. Ted’s act was impromptu due to his inability to remember lines. He specialized in impersonations of Ed Wynn, Eddie Cantor, and Al Jolson, but his act wasn’t paying off. Abandoning his birth name and amateur act, he then adopted the stage name of Ted Healy and became a professional comedian.\n\nTed’s act was a hit, becoming not only a comedian, but the host and master of ceremonies of various vaudeville shows on the circuit. Ted added many fellow performers to his act, including a group of acrobats and a dancer/singer named Betty Brown, who became his first wife in 1922. At one time in Ted’s act, he became the highest paid vaudeville performer of the day, earning as much as $8500 a week.\n\nWhen a portion of his acrobats quit, Ted sent out an ad for replacements. The person who answered was childhood friend Moe Howard. But Moe had no acrobatic training. So Ted created a role in the act for him. Moe became a member of the group that would impersonate an audience member and get called up on stage. This role was called a Stooge...\n\nMoe \"Harry\" Howard\n\nOn an episode of The Simpsons, Homer finds himself watching an old Three Stooges routine on television. He giggles to himself, and states “Moe is their leader!” That’s about as accurate a description one could ask for.\n\nWithout organization, the lesser intellects of the Stooge team would have been lost. While Ted Healy filled this role when the Stooges were under contract with him, the trio needed a new one when they left him, and Moe rose to glory. Moe’s character was the clueless buffoon who thought he knew exactly what was going on, which made him the natural lead to his fellows, who arguably knew even less than he did.\n\nMoe’s character was a grouch who was frustrated with the less than competent folk surrounding him, yet he lives in ignorance to the fact that he is no better. Yet this ignorance alone makes him the superior, which is the greatest joke about Moe. What should be his flaw ends up his strength, because he really is the only type of character that can bring order to the chaos that surrounds him. If he were smarter, or less aggressive, his fellow Stooges wouldn’t listen to him.\n\nOn June 19th, 1897, Moses Harold Horwitz was born in Brooklyn, New York, the fourth child of Solomon Horwitz and Jeannie Gorovitz. Growing up Moses would come to adopt “Harry” as his name, but revert back to his birth name of Moe once his career got started.\n\nMoe had a prodigious memory, and as such did very well in school. His memory proved to be an asset as a stage performer as well, being able to remember lines and cues with ease. Moe was an avid reader, and constantly borrowed his brother Jack’s collection of Horatio Alger books, which chronicled adventures of impoverished children with small-earning jobs, such as bootblacks, newsboys, and peddlers. Jack claimed that Alger’s books may have heavily influenced Moe in many ways. “They started his imaginative mind working and gave him ideas by the dozen. I think they were instrumental in putting thoughts into his head to become a good person and to become successful.”\n\nMoe’s trademark haircut rooted all the way back to childhood. Moe had shoulder length hair due to his mother’s wishes for a girl. Unfortunately, her wishes went unfulfilled, having given birth to five boys. Moe was teased relentlessly because of this and became so angered by his hair that he had a friend cut it into the bowl shape. After the deed was done, Moe was so afraid to show his mother that he hid under the porch of his house, causing his family to franticly search for him. When he finally turned up, his mother was so glad to see him that she never mentioned his hair.\n\nMoe became fascinated by acting and theater, going to the theater so regularly that he started playing hooky from school. At the time, adults had to accompany children to the theater, and Moe asked strangers to buy his ticket and he’d pay him the ticket price. Moe loved to sit in the balcony and watch the show from first act to last, select the actor he liked the best, and studied him for the duration of the play.\n\nMoe’s poor attendance in school continued into high school, where he dropped out after two months, ending his education, he then began to concentrate on a career in show business. Moe ran errands at Vitagraph Studios for no fee, but was given bit parts in films being shot (his films were destroyed by a fire in 1910).\n\nIn 1909, Moe met Lee Nash, who befriended Moe and the two aspired to succeed in show business together, both getting roles as a part of the diving “girls” in Annette Kellerman’s act. However once the boys quit the act, they went their separate ways.\n\nMoe never stopped aspiring to be on stage, though. He and his brother Shemp tried to get noticed by singing nights at a bar with well received singers Babe Tuttle and Willie O’Connor, but their father put an end to it; and in 1914, he joined a performing troupe on the Mississippi River showboat. Moe had various other acting jobs as well, even performing in blackface with his brother Shemp and starring in 12 twelve more short subjects featuring baseball star Hans Wagner.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1921 when Moe answered an ad for replacement acrobats in a stage act ran by a man named Ted Healy, who turned out to be Moe’s old friend Lee Nash. While Moe wasn’t an acrobat, Ted created a role for Moe called a “stooge,” in which Moe would play a phony audience member who would be incorporated into the act. Moe steadily worked with Ted for several years, but during one show, he saw his brother Shemp in the audience...\n\nShemp Howard\n\nShemp can be said to be the most versatile of the Howard Brothers, as he was the only one of the bunch that successfully had a film career outside of the Three Stooges. Outside of the Stooges, Shemp was not always the same character. While traits of his humor were often the same, his motives and morals were often much different.\n\nInside of the Three Stooges group, Shemp was a thick headed mug, and a bit of the series grunt. Shemp was probably the most likely of Stooges to stand up to the long time leader of Moe. Shemp often seemed like he felt like he knew more than Moe and was often thinking that it was only a matter of time before he was running the show.\n\nWhat held Shemp back from this? Cowardice, mostly. Shemp’s lack of courage is his downfall, often backing down from Moe after being glared at. Shemp also never could have kept his cool in a moderately creepy situation. Shemp is always the first to break down, even at the insistence of his companions that everything is OK.\n\nIncidentally, outside the Stooges, Shemp had taken on the leadership role several times, playing the role all too similar to Moe. The short Knife of the Party is a prime example, where the sole Howard brother leads on his own group of Stooges onstage.\n\nThe handsome lad of Samuel Horwitz was born on March 4th, 1895, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the middle son of five. Samuel took on the nickname “Shemp” as an in-joke, as his mother’s thick Litvak accent was unable to pronounce “Sam” correctly. Moe explained “Shemp was given the Hebrew name Schmool. Schmool was Anglicized to Samuel and then shortened to Sam. When his mother, with her broad European accent, called him, the name ‘Sam’ came out ‘Sams,’ and if you weren’t listening carefully it could sound like ‘Shemp'...which it did! So from the time he was 7, that’s what his family called him. It was Shemp in school and in the world of theater. In later years, no one knew it was anything else.”\n\nShemp as a child was very mischievous. He would often stuff the woolen stockings and sweaters of his family members down the toilet, just for a laugh. One time he even tore out pages of his brother Irving’s history book and put them in. Because of this, Moe claimed Shemp had to face the “family gauntlet,” which contained a smack from mother, a belt to the head by father, a push by Irving, and a kick to the rear end by Moe himself.\n\nBy the age of 13, though, Shemp had outgrown his trouble-making ways. However old habits die hard. In 1911, he and Moe both took separate courses on plumbing and electricity, respectively. While neither finished their courses, they had taken what they had learned and put it to use. They used their combined knowledge to install a push button door latch under their front porch which unlocked the front door. However, their parents eventually found what was locking their door and removed it. Later that evening, Shemp and Moe returned home and weren’t able to get inside. The two of them went around back and entered their home through the bathroom window, only to fall into a bathtub filled with water. Wearing the good clothes of their siblings, their awakened father was even more furious than usual.\n\nShemp never tried very hard with his schoolwork. He tried to concentrate, but ultimately found his attention wandering. When studying, he’d often brush lessons off with a smart aleck remark, draw silly pictures, or make other students laugh by making faces at them.\n\nWhile never seriously believing he himself would ever go into show business, Shemp was very supportive of his brother Moe’s endeavors in becoming a star, even joining him on several occasions. But Shemp had tried his hand at several different occupations before taking the stage roles seriously. One of which was a plumber, which he quit after burning his hand on a hot solder. Shemp had also tried working at a bowling alley and delivering newspapers, neither of which tickled his fancy.\n\nShemp then started to look toward the stage. But one of his earliest experiences had him thrown out of the theater three minutes into his act. Shemp was discouraged, but Moe thought it was a good start.\n\nIn 1923, Shemp was in an audience for Moe, who was appearing as a “stooge” for comedian Ted Healy. Moe spotted Shemp watching the act, and the two began to joke and interact. The crowd went wild for the two, and Healy invited Shemp to join the act, which Shemp was eager to do so. The act evolved into “Ted Healy and His Southern Gentlemen” and Moe and Shemp would adopt the last name of “Howard” for their stage names. But the act would evolve even further upon sight of an unusual violinist performing vaudeville in 1925...\n\nLarry Fine\n\nLarry is the Stooge forever buried by his more energetic comrades. While it’s true that Larry never stood out in the act the way Curly, Moe, or even Shemp did, to say Larry was entirely without merit is a downright lie. In fact, as the group aged and the pairing of Moe and Larry found themselves hiring outside comedians to take over the vacant roles Curly and Shemp left, it was arguably Larry’s firmly established chemistry with Moe that kept the spirit of the Three Stooges alive. This alone proves how valuable he was to the team.\n\nLarry was often the man caught in the middle. He was a character that was there mostly to react to harshness of Moe or the stupidity of Curly/Shemp/Joe/Curly-Joe, and he was there to enhance the gag with his own lightheaded comments. Often, Larry found himself picking a side between his two comrades: Moe, who he often agreed with when the various third Stooge had done something ridiculous, or Curly or the other third Stooge incarnations, in which he took the role as one of the oppressed ganging up on the bully. No matter which side Larry would take, Moe was often the victor of the battle. I guess this could mean that Larry’s opinion means little, but his role as a sort of “Independent” Stooge is one to be admired.\n\nLarry’s role in the legacy of the Three Stooges was summed up rather well by writer/director team Peter and Bobby Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There’s Something About Mary): “Growing up, first you watched Curly, then Moe, then your eyes got to Larry. He’s the reactor, the most vulnerable. 5 to 14, Curly; 14 to 21, Moe. Anyone out of college, if you’re not looking at Larry, you don’t have a good brain.”\n\nLouis Feinberg was born on October 5th, 1902 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to jeweler Joseph Feinberg and his wife Fanny Lieberman. Larry was the eldest of four children, one of which died pre-maturely. To his family, Larry was always a superstar, claiming he was stealing the show even when he was in diapers. Larry’s physical antics date back to when he was 2 years old, in which his father propped him up on a jewelry showcase so he could dance for his relatives. Larry slipped and fell through the glass of the display case. As horrible as the incident could have been, Larry was miraculously unharmed.\n\nFar from the only accident of his childhood, Larry suffered a more serious injury later on. At his father’s jewelry shop, Larry’s father was testing gold with an acid. Larry, thinking it was a juice, tried to drink it, but his father caught him at the last minute and smacked it out of his hands. A bit of acid landed on Larry’s left arm, burning him severely. Larry was rushed to the hospital where a skin graft was performed. After the surgery, the doctors recommended that Larry take violin lessons to strengthen his arm.\n\nLarry’s skills with a violin would be something that stayed with him for the rest of his life. As he grew older he became more focused on becoming a star. His violin skills became so impressive that he started to become more versatile with other instruments, becoming a gifted musician. His family recalled that he even made a homemade violin out of a cigar box and a broom handle. He played it single-string and in between his knees, like a cello.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Larry started working on the stage and even as an amateur boxer. In 1921, he started to his stride on the stage, as a musical comedian. He joined Gus Edward’s Newsboy Sextette, where he met Mabel Haney, who would become his girlfriend. Mabel let Larry join her act, along with her sister Loretta, and they became “The Haney Sisters and Fine.”\n\nThe group lasted on vaudeville until 1925, in which Larry was approached by three men named Ted, Moe, and Shemp...\n\nKnown Pre-Stooge Films\n\nMoe Howard appeared in the following shorts\n\nWe Must Do Our Best (Short Subject)\n\nFish Hookey (Short Subject)\n\nTed Healy appeared in the following shorts\n\nWise Guys Prefer Brunettes (Short Subject)\n\nIn 1925, Ted and Moe were informed by Shemp that he was leaving the act. Moe suggested a performer he had recently seen named Larry Fine to replace him. The trio approached Fine and offered him $90 a week, with an extra $10 if he’d “throw away the fiddle.” Larry eagerly agreed, and he joined the group while Shemp parted ways with the act.\n\nUnfortunately, Shemp’s first attempt at a solo career didn’t work out as he had hoped, and he returned to the group not long afterward.\n\nHappiness would come for the Stooges in 1925, though, as two of them were married to their lifelong partners. Moe married his bride, Helen Schonburger (who was a distant cousin of famed magician Harry Houdini), and Shemp to his fiancée Gertrude Frank. Larry would follow a year later with his long-time girlfriend Mabel Haney.\n\nMoe’s wife, however, didn’t want Moe to be on the road with Healy their entire lives, and since she had recently became pregnant with their first child, Joan, he agreed to split with the team. In 1926, Moe parted ways with Ted Healy and his fellow Stooges (the only time in their careers that Moe would leave the group). Moe went on to work in real estate, but never got the hang of it. Afterwards, he attempted open his own retail store, which he was no better at. Moe eventually returned to stage, in a way, in 1927 when he started producing and directing plays for a Jewish Community House. It became clear that Moe belonged on the stage. Not long after, Moe returned to the group, after less than two years of absence.\n\nShemp, in the meantime, was hard at work giving Moe’s daughter, Joan, a cousin. Shemp’s own son Morton was born in 1927. Not to be outdone, Larry had a daughter of his own in 1929, Phyllis.\n\nThe stage act was a rousing success, and eventually caught the eye of the film studios. One studio, Fox Film Corporation, approached them with a film called Soup to Nuts, and promised Ted Healy the starring role...\n\n1930\n\n[/b][/center]\n\nSoup to Nuts\n\nTed (Ted Healy) is a fireman dating Queenie (Francis McCoy), an employee of costume shop owner and crackpot inventor Otto Schmidt (Charles Winninger). Unfortunately, Schmidt is heading toward bankruptcy, just as his beautiful niece, Louise (Lucile Brown), comes into town. As Louise enters the shop, she flirts with a handsome creditor, Richard (Stanley Smith) who is there to kick her uncle out. Upon learning of her uncle’s situation, she promptly rejects him.\n\nIn the meantime, Schmidt takes a job as a waiter at a restaurant and Ted tries to save the business by selling costumes for a fireman’s costume party.\n\nIn an attempt to win the heart of Louise, Richard conspires with Ted to get her to dance with her at the costume party by disguising himself as Ted. Once Louise discovers who she is dancing with, she rushes back to the costume shop. Richard, chasing after her, accidentally sets the building on fire. The fire bells ring and Ted rides to the rescue with along with his four inept fellow firemen (The Three Stooges and Fred Sanborn). They rescue all those trapped within the building and Richard and Louise sort out their differences. Not only that, but Richard took out insurance on the building in Schmidt’s name, saving him from Bankruptcy.\n\nI wish I could say that the Stooges debut film is a laugh riot that breaths new life in the comic genre, but unfortunately Soup to Nuts is a strained, 70 minute comedy that is roughly 60 minutes too long. The film has no sense of movement and forces itself forward with no real sense of direction.\n\nTed Healy is far too aggressive in the film, making him an extremely unlikable leading man. Unlike Moe, who would take the leadership role of the Stooges overtime, he commands and threatens without any hint of a dimwitted, playful attitude. Charles Winninger, as Schmidt, does OK with his wacky role, but suffers in trying to sell some of the films more absurd moments, which it looks as if even he himself doesn’t buy. A bright spot in the cast is Francis McCoy, who matches wits with Healy and does more than a fair job. I’d even go as far as to say she squeezed out more laughs than he did.\n\nThe Stooges, themselves, steal every scene they’re in. With the weak material surrounding them, they rescue the entire production from drowning. The firefight finale alone is worthy of the best of their short subjects with Columbia. Unfortunately, they’re also carrying the weight of Fred Sanborn, another vaudeville comedian who tagged along with Healy and the trio for the ride. Sanborn spends nearly all of his time grinning at the camera without doing anything. It’s not funny. In fact, it’s downright creepy.\n\nSoup to Nuts didn’t go down in history as a classic. If it weren’t the debut of such a popular comic team, it probably would have rotted in 20th Century Fox’s vault till the end of time. It has its moments (most of which are a result of the Stooges), but this one is for super curious historians only.\n\nNotes:\n\nSoup to Nuts was written by Rube Goldberg, a then-popular cartoonist who specialized in drawings of complex devices that did simple everyday things. “Building a better mousetrap,” if you will. Throughout the film, lots of gadgets are showcased, many of which are explained at the beginning. Goldberg has a cameo early on as himself, opening fan mail at a restaurant.\n\nIn this film, Moe is credited as “Harry Howard.”\n\nThe fourth fireman alongside the Three Stooges is Fred Sanborn, who also appeared onstage with Ted Healy and the Three Stooges as \"Ted Healy and his Southern Gentleman.\" Judging from his appearance in this film, Sanborn’s character was a mute character with large eyebrows who would often mug at the audience. Like the Stooges eventually would, Sanborn left the act in order to concentrate on his career as a musician. However, he appeared off and on throughout the years, often as similar characters, until 1950.\n\nPost by Torgo on\n\nSoup to Nuts was released to much criticism and moderate box office. The film failed to impress much of its audience, with the exception of one aspect…Moe, Larry, and Shemp. The Three Stooges really seemed to tickle the audience’s funny bone, and Fox Film Corporation took note of this. Locking Ted Healy out of the negotiations, Fox offered them a contract, provided that Healy doesn’t come with them. They were eager to sign.\n\nTed, however, was furious. Ted approached Fox and told them that Moe, Larry, and Shemp were his employees and as long as they were under contract with him, they were not signing any film contract that didn’t include him. The contract was immediately withdrawn, and it didn’t take long for Moe, Larry, and Shemp to discover why.\n\nAngry, they left Ted to start their own act…\n\n1931-1932\n\nMoe, Larry, and Shemp’s new act (often labeled “The Three Lost Souls” or just simply “Howard, Fine, and Howard”) without Ted Healy led to decent success. However, Ted wasn’t willing to let his boys go without a fight. He threatened them with a lawsuit that claimed they were using material he had under copyright.\n\nRumors also state that Healy threatened to bomb any theater that would host the act. This claim scared Shemp to the point that he almost quit the act, only staying after he was offered more money. These claims, however, are not confirmed, though.\n\nIn the meantime, Ted hired several replacements for his lost Stooges: Eddie Moran, Jack Wolf, Paul “Mousie” Garner, and Richard Hakins. None of them had the same impact as the original three.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1932 that Ted made an offer to take his Three Stooges back. At this point, Moe was managing the business aspect of the trio’s end, and he was a force to be reckoned with, as Moe was great with numbers and finance. But would come to an eventual agreement, Ted Healy and Howard, Fine, and Howard would reunite!\n\nBut this reunion would be short-lived, because Shemp, whose relationship with Ted was rocky at best, was uneasy about going back into business with him. But the last straw wouldn’t come until the rehearsals of a stage show called The Passing Show of 1932. During the production of this show, Ted received a better offer from another show, and immediately found a loophole in his contract that dropped him and his Stooges from the act, without consulting Moe, Larry, or Shemp on the matter. Of the trio, Shemp was the most furious. Fed up with Healy, Shemp left the act for his own career.\n\nWhile Shemp would find success elsewhere, this left the act without a third Stooge. But Moe wasn’t out of brothers yet…\n\nJerry “Curly” Howard\n\nThe long time fan-favorite of the group, Curly provided the most energetic driving force of all the Stooges. With even the most insignificant of situations, Curly always managed to find the event’s spark and ignite it.\n\nCharacter-wise, Curly was a childish oaf, and can be seen as the polar opposite of Moe. Moe, who had grown sour of the stupidity around him, would often take his abuse out on Curly, who simple and cheery. Yet, no matter how many hits Curly took from Moe, his optimism never wavered. To the end, he was always looking on the bright side of things, something his comrades seemed incapable of doing. And if there was no bright side to be found, Curly would find a way to try and make the situation fun.\n\nCurly’s grace is one of his greatest attributes. While all of the Stooges had their fair share of clumsiness, Curly’s movement was something beautiful to watch. Curly was overweight, but he moved on his feet like he only weighed five pounds. Curly could also mold this into the slapstick of the act, and he would deliver more grace in the physical hits than any other Stooge in the act. I daresay that if you watch Curly and watch him very carefully you can unlock secrets of great balance.\n\nBorn Jerome Lester Horwitz on October 22nd, 1903, Curly was the fifth and youngest of the Howard family. His establishment as the youngest of the family had his brothers nickname him “Babe” though out most of his life, but the nickname was dropped to avoid confusion when his brother Shemp married Gertrude Frank and he started calling her the same nickname.\n\nUnlike Moe and Shemp, Curly was a quiet child that hardly gave any trouble to his parents. But his brothers had influence on him in other ways, as they planted in his head at an early age the idea of becoming a comedian. The trio would stage small theater productions in the basement and charge their friends two cents a head.\n\nCurly did, however, have one close call in his youth. At the age of 12, he had shot himself in the ankle while cleaning a rifle. Curly, who was afraid of corrective surgery, would walk with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life.\n\nCurly was a fair student, but a fine athlete. Childhood friend Lester Friedman recalled that Curly was great at basketball. Curly, like his brother Moe, didn’t graduate from school. He instead followed Moe and Shemp’s example and started taking odd jobs.\n\nDespite Curly’s shy nature, he was very popular socially. Curly loved to sing and dance, and even knew how to play the ukulele. Curly had a knack for pleasing large groups of people, and Moe would often feed the desire for Curly’s talent by taking him to see vaudeville performances.\n\nIn his late teens, Curly had met a girl, whose name remains unknown. She became Curly’s first wife, despite the objections of his mother, Jeannie, who thought getting married at such a young age was a huge mistake. After six months, the marriage was annulled.\n\nIn 1928, Curly got his big break on stage with “The Orville Knapp Band,” where Curly would portray a comical music conductor. Moe described Curly’s role as “A guest conductor who would come out and lead the band in a break away tuxedo. The sections of his suit would fall away piece by piece as he stood there swinging his baton.” The audience went crazy for him.\n\nIn 1930, Curly married his second wife, Julia Rosenthal. But like his first marriage, it was not to be and they were divorced after a few months.\n\nCurly was very supportive of his brothers Moe and Shemp, and enjoyed watching their act with Ted Healy. In fact, he was often backstage with them during the rehearsals on The Passing Show of 1932. Future-Stooge Joe Besser was also present at these rehearsals, recalling “He was there all the time and would get sandwiches for all of us in the show, including Ted Healy and his Stooges. He never participated in any of the routines, but liked to watch us perform.”\n\nIt was on this show that Shemp had a falling out with Ted Healy and left the group to pursue his own career. Moe made the suggestion that maybe his baby brother could take Shemp’s spot. Ted didn’t like Curly, and made the comment that he didn’t think he looked very funny. Anxious to prove himself, Curly took a razor, and shaved off his wavy hair and large moustache. When Healy took his first look at the shaven Jerry Howard, he said “Boy, don’t you look girlie!” Moe misheard Ted’s statement and thought he said “Curly” instead of “Girlie,” which gave birth to the new nickname of the youngest Howard brother.\n\nWhile Curly’s shaved head got him into good graces with Ted Healy, Curly felt with the loss of his hair, he had lost his sex appeal. He didn’t feel that his clean-shaven head made him look like a catch for women, but he kept it for the sake of the act.\n\nTed Healy and his new regrouping of Stooges hit the stage again to large success. Curly became very popular among audiences with his trademark “Nyuk nyuk nyuk!” and “Woowoowoo!” (the latter of which being Curly’s cover up for when he had forgotten a line). But Ted was having family troubles at the time and divorced his wife Betty. But the show must go on…\n\n1933\n\nTed Healy and his Stooges were about to get a second chance at Hollywood stardom. The company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was impressed with the boys’ comedy, and signed them to a deal consisting of several shorts and film cameos…\n\nNertsery Rhymes\n\n“Papa” Ted Healy is all dressed up and ready for a night on the town, but his darling sons (The Three Stooges) demand a bedtime story. After an attempt at appeasing the boys with The Story of Paul Revere, a Fairy Godmother (Bonnie Bonnell) appears to tell them more musical tales of The Girl and the Fan and The Woman in the Shoe.\n\nNertsery Rhymes is a charming short subject, without being overly funny. The idea of Ted Healy playing father two three bratty Stooge children is decently fun.\n\nHealy, himself, is more charming here than he was in Soup to Nuts, as he seems to be more playful and less abusive. The Stooges don’t do much other than annoy Healy. However, this short feature does contain one of my favorite Stooge lines of all time.\n\n“Now, if I gave you a dollar and your father gave you a dollar, how many dollars would you have?”\n\n“One dollar!”\n\n“I can see you don’t know your arithmetic.”\n\n“I can see you don’t know my father.”\n\nThe musical sequences are lavish. However, much like other similar shorts that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has produced, the comedy grinds to a halt as a result. But Nertsery Rhymes is a charming piece, just not entertaining enough.\n\nNotes:\n\nOne of the few Three Stooges appearances in color, the decision to shoot this early short in the expensive format was to use a musical sequence of the unfinished musical The March of Time in their originally filmed format of Technicolor. Despite this, there are black and white prints of Nertsery Rhymes.\n\nThe Woman in the Shoe musical sequence is from Lord Byron of Broadway (1930).\n\nThe Fairy Godmother is played by Bonnie Bonnell, an actress making her film debut. Her only film appearances afterward were with Ted Healy and the Three Stooges. This is said to be because she was dating Ted Healy at the time the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shorts were produced. In the credits, she’s usually billed as just “Bonnie” (though in Nertsery Rhymes, she is listed as “Bonny”).\n\nThe Three Stooges are billed as “Howard, Fine, and Howard.” This would continue for a time to come.\n\nTurn Back the Clock\n\nJoe (Lee Tracy) and Mary (Mae Clarke), husband and wife of 15 years, run a drug store and are barely making ends meet. One day, Joe’s old pal Ted, who married Elvira, daughter of a wealthy businessman, pays him a surprise visit. Since their marriage, Ted became fairly wealthy and treats Joe and Mary to dinner. After an evening of much alcohol consumption, Ted offers Joe a business proposition that would allow Joe to balloon his life savings up fivefold. Ted runs it by Mary, who promptly rejects the idea.\n\nLater that night, at home, Joe and Mary get into an argument that ends with Joe telling Mary that he could have married Elvira and became wealthy. He storms out of the house and drunkenly wanders in front of a moving car, knocking Joe out.\n\nJoe awakens 20 years earlier. Convinced he’s been given a second chance at life, Joe marries Elvira and leaves Mary brokenhearted.\n\nIn the coming years, Joe uses his knowledge of the future to become a successful businessman, making deals with Henry “Kord” and his crazy automobile engine, and even becoming a (less than successful) advisor to Woodrow Wilson during World War I.\n\nDuring this time, his new wife, Elvira, begins cheating on him with a business associate. Their marriage is kept only for the sake of public appearances.\n\nOut to get a box of cigarettes, Joe stops by the drug store he used to work at and runs into Ted, who is now married to Mary and running the same store. Joe invites them to dinner and offers them the same business opportunity. To Joe’s surprise, in this timeline, Mary agrees to invest the money with no hesitations.\n\nIn the months approaching the stock market crash leading to the Great Depression, Joe tries to warn as many people as he can, but nobody will take him seriously. Not wanting to be among the people affected, Joe has Elvira put his stock money in a trust fund. Elvira, not believing a word Joe says, puts his cash into more stock.\n\nWhen the market crashes, Joe discovers the shocking truth. In the days that come, Joe discovers that his business partners have had some shady dealings, and plan to pin the blame on Joe. Not wanting to go to jail, Joe flees. He stops to see Mary first, to convince her to come with him, because he is still in love with her. Mary refuses, stating that she married Ted “for better or worse.” Brokenhearted Joe flees the police, but his attempts are futile…\n\n…And then Joe wakes up in the hospital. For it was all a dream. At his side are Ted, Elvira, and Mary, still his wife. Mary tells Joe that he can invest his life savings with Ted with her blessing, but Joe refuses, stating he wouldn’t trade what he has for all the money in the world.\n\nThe Three Stooges appear unbilled as wedding Singers.\n\nThis charming little film has elements of It’s a Wonderful Life and even Back to the Future, yet predates them both.\n\nTurn Back the Clock never became the classic those two movies became (hell, it took me a while to even find it), but it’s a fairly interesting little drama that keeps the viewer in their seat from beginning to end. While the acting is hammy and it’s plotting is all over the place, it has enough charm, laughs, and character interest to make a fairly good rainy day viewing.\n\nWhile its final moral is commendable (just because your life could have been different, doesn’t mean it could have been better), throughout the film it seems to be on the tip of its tongue without ever really saying it. Joe spends the entire film miserable with his new life, but in a sort of ignorant bliss of it.\n\nThree Stooges fans may be disappointed in their cameo here. While their scene is amusing, they provide the set-up to the comedy instead of the punch line, as a drunk Lee Tracy takes all the laughs, telling war stories of a war that hasn’t even happened yet.\n\nI’d highly recommend Turn Back the Clock, even to non-Stooge fans looking for a nice vintage comedy-drama.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis marks the first time the Three Stooges appeared as a group without Ted Healy.\n\nLee Tracy was a Broadway performer turned actor with film credits as early as 1929’s The Big Time, also starring Mae Clarke. Tracy was described as highly impulsive, having abandoned film to return to Broadway a year later. Hollywood started courting him again, and he returned to the booming film industry. Tracy earned himself a “Bad Boy” reputation with constant absences from the set and a wild night life. In 1933, Tracy was signed to a five year contract with MGM (which Turn Back the Clock was a part of), but it was promptly terminated a year later after and incident in Mexico City filming Viva Villa! Tracy engaged in what was described as “ungentlemanly behavior” which resulted in fisticuffs with the local law enforcement and a high profile arrest. Afterward, Tracy freelanced himself for work, only to return to stage again. He appeared on and off again in film and television for the rest of his years.\n\nMae Clarke is probably most well known for playing Elizabeth in the popular 1931 adaptation of Frankenstein starring Boris Karloff. She had a very extensive career in film, making appearances up to 1970.\n\nBeer and Pretzels\n\nTed Healy and the Three Stooges are “Heely, Heely, Heely, & Heely,” four entertainers that have just been kicked out of the hot spot they’ve been performing in. The Stooges accuse Ted of being more interested in woman than he is in work. Ted denies it…until a pretty dame (Bonnie Bonnell) crosses their path and Ted chases after her. They follow her to a restaurant that she herself was performing in, and they fast talk the head waiter into giving them jobs as waiters/entertainers. Reluctantly, he agrees, and the boys start right away.\n\nAs their day goes on, they grow increasingly more jealous of the stage acts that are put in, claiming they can do better. Ted and the Stooges then storm the stage and put on their own act, only to make a mess out of the place. The four are promptly kicked out. Ted once again swears off women…until he sees another one. He approaches her and propositions her, only to find out she’s a cop.\n\nOf all the shorts Ted Healy and the Stooges made at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Beer and Pretzels is the most like the shorts the Three Stooges would find themselves doing at Columbia. It involves a wacky plot involving the group taking jobs and proceeding to tear up the place.\n\nBeer and Pretzels is a lot of fun. Healy and the boys are at the top of their game, and there’s rarely a moment they’re onscreen that doesn’t generate a laugh. The same can’t be said for Bonnie Bonnell, though. I honestly can’t tell if her dance number is supposed to be comical or not. She has absurdly large pads on her shoulders and dances like someone shoved a stiff board down her trousers.\n\nDespite that, I highly recommend Beer and Pretzels to the seasoned Stooge fan. It’s a good solid short.\n\nNotes:\n\nLike Nertsery Rhymes, footage from the scrapped film The March of Time was used for this short.\n\nThe Three Stooges are once again billed as “Howard, Fine, and Howard” and Bonnie Bonnell once again merely as “Bonny.”\n\nThe singing bartenders are a group called The Three Ambassadors. Member Jack Smith went on to a singing career on radio and eventually hosted the television show You Asked For It in the 1950’s. Fellow member Martin Sperzel went on to become a member of The Sportsman Quartet, costars of The Jack Benny Program. The third member, Al Teeter, went on to a successful career in the music department at Disney, providing music for Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan.\n\nLate in the short there’s a scene where Ted Healy accidentally spills a customer’s salt shaker. Stricken with superstition, the customer begs Ted to throw salt over his shoulder. Ted throws the entire shaker over his shoulder and accidentally strikes Moe in the head, sending him into a rage. A similar scene plays out in the 1994 comedy Dumb & Dumber. The directors of that film, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, are both avid Three Stooges fans; as are the film’s stars, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.\n\nHello Pop!\n\nTed Healy is about to put on the biggest show of his career and everything has to go absolutely perfect. But problems arise in the form of Healy’s children (Moe, Larry, and Curly) wreaking havoc backstage, performers not ready for the stage, and a mysterious woman (Bonnie Bonnell) trying to audition for it.\n\nHello Pop was long thought to be lost, leaving it a piece of Stooges history that has been a curiosity for quite some time. When I first saw the film I paid close attention to it, because it may very well be the last unseen footage I’ll ever see of the Curly-era Three Stooges as a unit in my entire life. And unless Curly Howard’s lost short Jail Birds of Paradise is ever found, it may very well be the last time I see footage of Curly that I haven’t seen at all.\n\nNote: I know for a fact this is the last time I’ll see footage of Bonnie Bonnell that I haven’t seen, but that’s of no importance to me. The woman was just painful to watch.\n\nAfter years of anticipation, Hello Pop is a bit of an anti-climax. It’s unfair to think it should be the ultimate Three Stooges presentation, but it does fail to be one of the better shorts that they made during their MGM tenure. There’s very little actual amusement in the proceedings, which just kind of throws random gags around that are kind of amusing in concept but always landing with a thud over a chuckle. Ted Healy just kind of runs around franticly but is rarely given any actual humor to perform (aside from the kissing scene, which is pretty funny I’ll admit). Bonnie Bonnell stumbles onscreen every once in a while, mumbles incoherently, and gets shoved off as Ted Healy melodramatically asks “Who IS that WOMAN?” As an audience member, instead of laughing I just find myself asking “Well, why don’t you ask her?” The final payoff for this gag (“I’m in the wrong theater!”) is less of a chuckle and more of a groan.\n\nThe Stooges shine the brightest, though not by much. The children routine is a bit tired after having already seen Nertsery Rhymes. The Stooges try to find new and fun ways to run with it, as they try to rehearse the play themselves to goofy results. I very much like their hiding under a woman’s dress and fighting over a dollar at the end as well.\n\nMy ultimate satisfaction in Hello Pop is that the short was found at all and now is readily available for viewing for all Three Stooges fans everywhere. That alone is a victory worth celebrating. It’s a below-average short, but deep down I can say I kind of wish The Big Idea was “the lost short” instead (though if I’m this disappointed in Hello Pop, imagine how disappointed I’d be in rediscovering The Big Idea).\n\nNotes:\n\nMade in a time in which film preservation wasn’t a concern, Hello Pop’s only preserved copy was destroyed by a fire in an MGM vault in 1967. For over forty-five years the film was considered lost until January 2013 where it was discovered in a private film collection in Australia. Restoration of the film became a top priority and the film was ready for screening by September 30th of that year in New York. Almost a year later on September 24th, 2014, Warner Archive released an on-demand version of the movie on a DVD called Classic Shorts from the Dream Factory Volume 3 through the internet where it can finally be enjoyed for home viewing today.\n\nWas the second and last short the Stooges filmed at MGM in Technicolor. Curly and Moe had also appeared in a Technicolor short without Healy or Larry called Jailbirds of Paradise (considered a lost film) and Curly appeared by himself in the Technicolor short Roast Beef and Movies. This would be the final time the Stooges appeared in color until their television appearances of the 1950’s and 60’s and the last time they’d be theatrically presented in color until Snow White and the Three Stooges in 1961.\n\nItalian character actor Henry Armetta was born in Sicily but came to America illegally by stowing away on a boat at the age of 14. He was almost deported on the spot but an Italian-American citizen stood up to act as the boy’s sponsor. Armetta performed remedial jobs to get by before meeting actor Raymond Hitchcock, who got him a part in the play A Yankee Consul. Armetta continued his career into Hollywood, often playing a stereotypical Italian character. During his time he worked with not only the Three Stooges, but the Marx Brothers in The Big Store and Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante in What! No Beer? He also performed with horror icons Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in the film The Black Cat.\n\nEdward Brophy is also an actor who worked with the legendary Buster Keaton. One of Brophy’s first film roles was the iconic dressing room scene in The Cameraman. The sequence was so enjoyed by studio executives that it helped launch his film career. Today he is best known as the voice of Timothy the Mouse in the Walt Disney animated film Dumbo.\n\nIf that’s not enough of a comedy icon connection for you, Tiny Sanford was a frequent supporting player for Charlie Chaplin, being featured in The Gold Rush, The Circus, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator. He was also often a guest performer in the short films of Laurel and Hardy.\n\nRosetta and Vivian Duncan were vaudeville performers by the name of The Duncan Sisters. They started their comedy act at the young age of 14 in a show called Kiddies’ Revue. As they matured they started to grow both in popularity and talent, as they began to write their own material and music and often molding them into one. Their most popular creation was the stage play Topsy and Eva, loosely based on the novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The play was such a smash that the Duncan Sisters adapted it to silent film in 1927 directed by future-Stooge collaborator Del Lord. The sisters started making sound films at MGM as the leads in their next film, It’s a Great Life, which became a box office bomb. The Duncan Sisters’ career spiraled after that, attempting to co-star in the ill-fated musical The March of Time that went unfinished. The duo split afterwards but reunited several years later on stage, though occasionally making a guest appearance on television and film. A biography of the Duncans was in the works at Paramount in 1952 starring Betty Hutton and Ginger Rogers, but was left unmade after Hutton broke her contract with Paramount.\n\nThe Three Stooges are credited as “Howard, Fine, and Howard.”\n\nBonnie Bonnell is credited as “Bonny.”\n\nPlane Nuts\n\nTed Healy, Bonnie Bonnell, Moe, Larry, and Curly use their vaudeville routine to introduce musical numbers.\n\nPlane Nuts hits the spot in ways other efforts in this era of the group can only dream of. This short gives us a delightful look at what Healy and the boys were like on vaudeville.\n\nHealy and the Stooges give us some of their best shots, including a few bits they’ve already used on film before. I gotta say I enjoyed just about every minute of it, from the opening with Ted trying to treat the audience with a song only to be foiled by his comic partners to their triumphant finish when they all treat us to a song, it’s just a different song from each performer!\n\nThere’s one thing about the act that I took note of. The Stooges themselves are supposed to be Healy’s foils, yet more often than not Healy finds himself to be the foil to the trio. The way the boys often steal the spotlight from their boss is sensational, and a real testament to why they achieved classic status and Healy became a mere footnote.\n\nThe musical numbers are cool, each with a slight airplane theme (hence the title Plane Nuts). The opening visual in the second, featuring a group of toy airplanes forming into a dance group, is wildly fun.\n\nI gotta give Plane Nuts a thumbs up. There are too many things here to like.\n\nNotes:\n\nPlaying with the airplane theme of the short title and musical numbers, originally the ending to this short was to have featured Healy and the Stooges in an airplane, flying around the world backwards. The scene was filmed but cut, instead opting to end the short with the second musical number.\n\nThe musical numbers were lifted from the 1931 film Flying High.\n\nThe Three Stooges are once again billed as “Howard, Fine, and Howard.”\n\nBonnie Bonnell is billed simply as “Bonnie.”\n\nMeet the Baron\n\nBaron Munchausen (Henry Kolker) has been away from the public eye for 10 years. While lost on safari, he finds himself stuck with two incompetent aids, Julius (Jack Pearl) and Joe (Jimmy Durante). When Julius accidentally loses most of their water supply, the Baron leaves them both in the jungle to die, taking the remaining water with him.\n\nHours later, an expedition searching for the lost Baron finds the two passed out in the jungle. The men mistake Julius for the Baron, and upon coming to, both Julius and Joe play along in order to get out of the Jungle.\n\nUpon arriving in America, Julius is invited to speak at an all-girls collage in New York. Seeing an opportunity for easy money, he agrees and Joe comes along. Once there, they make up countless absurd tales of phony adventures. Julius even falls in love with a lovely maid, Zasu (Zasu Pitts).\n\nHowever, once the real Baron finds out that impostors are posing as him in America, he heads there straight away and accuses them. Julius blackmails the Baron by threatening to ruin his reputation by revealing to the world that he left them to die in the jungle. The plan succeeds, and the Baron leaves. However, they are discovered mere moments later when the new maid, Julius’ aunt Sophie, recognizes him in front of Zasu and the dean (Edna May Oliver).\n\nDisgraced, Julius and Joe leave. However, on the street, they discover that they are being followed by a stranger. Believing it to be the police, the two men try to escape by boarding a train. The stranger catches up to them, but hands them a contract. He is from a radio broadcasting company, and Julius’ absurd stories as the Baron were such a hit, he wants to sign them to a broadcasting deal.\n\nThe man isn’t the only one that followed them on the train. Zasu appears on the train as well, claiming she couldn’t imagine living her life without Julius.\n\nTed Healy, Moe, Larry, and Curly play janitors at the collage. They perform several comedy bits throughout the film.\n\nMeet the Baron is a delightful comic romp from people who know good, zany comedy. Jack Pearl is positively lovable as the phony Baron Munchausen. His over-exaggerated tales are a genuine treat! Jimmy Durante is just as fun, playing a typical nitwit wiseguy who helps Pearl pull this scheme off.\n\n“Isn’t this humiliating?! Hiding under a bed, and not a husband in sight!”\n\nBut I’m here to talk about the Three Stooges (and Ted Healy, by association), and if you’re looking for some good material from our boys, I’m here to tell you you’ll find it here! The group even gets the highlight of the entire movie, when a woman’s shower room breaks, and our handy man heroes have to fix it amidst scantily clad ladies completely blindfolded!\n\nIts stuff like that which reminds me of why I’m a fan of this group. Thank you to Meet the Baron for sequences that fun. Thank you to Meet the Baron for being a wild pleasure even on its own. And most of all, thank you Meet the Baron for the shower room musical number featuring nude girls with water jets covering their naughty bits. You know I enjoyed that.\n\nNotes:\n\nMeet the Baron is based upon a radio sketch series created by star Jack Pearl. In it, Jack Pearl played Baron Munchausen (loosely based on the real Baron Freiherr von Munchausenn), who tells his absurd tales to a skeptical listener. When he was met with skepticism, he would ask “Vass you dere, Sharlie?” Halfway through the film, an example of this is played out. Pearl also played the character in 1934’s Hollywood Party.\n\nJimmy Durante was a popular comedian. He is often noted for his gravely voice (“Inka Dinka Doo!”) and his large nose (which he referred to as his “Schnozzola!”). Durante would also cross paths with the Three Stooges in Hollywood on Parade, Hollywood Party, Start Cheering, and Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. However, Meet the Baron is the only film in which Durante ever interacted with them.\n\nThis is the first feature film appearance of Ted Healy and the Stooges together since Soup to Nuts. Though, Healy appeared with only Larry in Stage Mother and by himself in Bombshell, and the Stooges themselves made various appearances together and individually in the films Turn Back the Clock and Broadway to Hollywood.\n\nFor the first time, the Three Stooges are credited as “Stooges.” Or more specifically “Ted Healy and his Stooges.” They are also listed under their individual names, though Curly doesn’t go by his character’s name and is listed under his original stage name “Jerry Howard.”\n\nThe “real” tales of Baron Freiherr von Munchausenn were adapted into 1911’s Les Aventures de Baron de Munchausen, 1943’s Munchausen, 1961’s Baron Prasil, 1979’s Les Fabuleuses Aventures du Legendaire Baron de Munchausen, and 1988’s The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (directed by Terry Gilliam).\n\nDancing Lady\n\nA police raid brings down a local burlesque house that Jamie Barlow (Joan Crawford) was working at, and she gets arrested. She is bailed out by the wealthy Tod Newton (Franchot Tone), who was in the theater when it was raided. Attracted to Jamie, he takes her out to dinner and they talk. Jamie wants to be a real dancer, and Tod offers to help her. She turns him down and tries to get an audition herself with Broadway director Patch Gallagher (Clark Gable).\n\nAfter her poor attempts at getting Gallagher’s attention, Tod arranges an audition for her with Gallagher. In an attempt to brush her off, Gallagher sends his assistant Steve (Ted Healy), a piano player (Larry), and two incompetent stagehands (Moe and Curly) to give her a horrible audition. When she survives the phony audition with her spunk, an impressed Steve runs back to Gallagher and convinces him to give her a real audition. Reluctantly, Gallagher watches Jamie, and accepts her into the show.\n\nThrough the rehearsals, the hard working Jamie is eventually taken out of the group and given the top spot alongside famed Broadway dancer Fred Astaire! All is working out just fine until the show is shut down. Without a job, Jamie is forced to leave with Tod and marry him. But Gallagher doesn’t take the news of the show’s cancellation lying down, after all the hard work he put into it. He decides to fund the rest of the show out of his own pocket and the show will go on!\n\nEventually Gallagher discovers the real reason the show was shut down was because Tod bribed the producers to cancel the production so Jamie would be forced to marry him. While Tod and Jamie are out on the town, Gallagher shows up, completely drunk and calls Tod out on it.\n\nShocked, Jamie breaks up with Tod and returns to the show. Everyone gives the performance of a lifetime! When the show is over Jamie and Gallagher confront their feelings for one another and share a passionate kiss.\n\nIf you thought that Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, and Fred Astaire had nothing in common with the Three Stooges, think again!\n\nFirst and foremost, this is not a Three Stooges movie, so I will not be reviewing it as such. Sure, they’re in it, but if I were to judge it by that alone, it would be completely unfair.\n\nDancing Lady is a pretty good movie, though fairly shallow and predictable. The plot it gives itself is about as overused as a loaner car. In spite of that, the performances are too good for the film to drown. Crawford, Gable, and Franchot Tone are all superb. Even Ted Healy surprises all with what is actually a really good performance.\n\nMaybe Healy was wasting his time slapping Moe, Shemp, Larry, and Curly around on vaudeville. Maybe he should have pursued drama, instead.\n\nThe Stooges have one big scene and about one or two brief ones. While they’re funny enough, unfortunately it clashes too hard with the rest of the movie. That forces me to wonder who in their right mind would cast a more dramatic film with the Three Stooges in supporting roles.\n\nBut even still, Dancing Lady is a solid comedy/drama. My primary problems with it are a familiar plot and the romance between Crawford and Gable was a bit forced. The Broadway show finale’s an acid trip, too. I don’t think anything with that many camera tricks has ever been put on stage.\n\nNotes:\n\nDancing Lady is the film debut of Broadway dancer and choreographer Fred Astaire. Astaire went on to show his fantastic dance moves in around 40 motion pictures, including 10 performances with Ginger Rogers. His most successful film was 1935’s Top Hat (which he also performed with Rogers).\n\nClark Gable was one of Hollywood’s most popular leading men, and even starred in what is America’s top ticket seller of all time, 1939’s Gone with the Wind (Titanic and Avatar eat your hearts out). Gone with the Wind got him his third Oscar nomination, after 1934’s It Happened One Night (for which he won) and 1935’s Mutiny on the Bounty. Gable had a steady career in Hollywood until his death in 1960. His last film was The Misfits, which was also the final film of Marilyn Monroe.\n\nJoan Crawford was a Broadway dancer turned actress that eventually became what Life magazine referred to as “The First Queen of the Movies.” Crawford appeared in nearly 100 movies, including 8 appearances with Clark Gable and 7 with her eventual husband (and eventual ex-husband), Franchot Tone. Both of these include Dancing Lady.\n\nJoan Crawford and Clark Gable also starred together in the following films: Dance, Fools, Dance (1931), Laughing Sinners (1931), Possessed (1931), Chained (1934), Forsaking All Others (1934), Love on the Run (1936, also with Franchot Tone), and Strange Cargo (1940).\n\nJoan Crawford and Franchot Tone also starred together in the following films: Today We Live (1933), Sadie McKee (1934), No More Ladies (1935), The Gorgeous Hussy (1936), Love on the Run (1936, also with Clark Cable), and The Bride Wore Red (1937).\n\nCurly is credited as “Jerry Howard.”\n\nMyrt and Marge\n\nA struggling stage show loses its financial backing, and the only way they can keep going is to clean up their act. The show’s head showgirl, Myrt Spear (Myrtle Vail), decides she is too old to be dancing on stage, and decides to work backstage and find some young talent to draw in audiences.\n\nShe hires a new comedian, Eddie Hanley, who in turn introduces Myrt to his girlfriend Marge Minter (Donna Dumerel), a local waitress at her mother’s boarding house. Myrt reluctantly lets her audition, only to find she’s got talent. Marge, however, needs to ask permission from her mother before hitting the road for the show. After making a deal with Marge’s mother, she finally agrees, but only if she can go with Marge!\n\nAfter a few weeks, Marge’s mother is satisfied that her daughter is happy and leaves for home. During this time, Marge has caught the eye of the show’s financial backer Johnny Jackson. Johnny’s advances become stronger and stronger, making Marge more uncomfortable.\n\nOne night, Johnny sneaks into Marge’s room to talk to her, but when they are almost caught together, Marge shoos him out and tells him to come back later. Marge runs crying to Eddie, who is furious at Johnny for crossing the line. Eddie sneaks into Marge’s room and lies down in Marge’s bed. Johnny comes back and starts caressing Eddie, thinking he’s Marge. Eddie punches Johnny and the two fight, resulting in Johnny getting knocked out.\n\nEddie is arrested for assault the next day. However, after Myrt pays Johnny a visit and threatens to tell his wife about his attempted affair with Marge, Johnny agrees to drop the charges, but gives the condition that all his money is returned to him.\n\nWithout money, the show is left stranded. However, Marge’s mother returns to find out what all the fuss about Eddie getting arrested was about. After confessing the entire story, Marge’s mother reveals she’s sold her boarding house and says she’ll provide the money to keep the show up and running!\n\nTed Healy, Moe, Larry, and Curly play stagehands, and are often leaned on for comic relief in the film.\n\nMyrt and Marge probably should have both stayed on radio, because Myrt and Marge the movie doesn’t have much promise, and kinda fails to live up to that meager expectation.\n\nThe movie is OK. It plays out like a random string of scenes with a barely there plot to hold them together. It doesn’t have much get-go; very little energy to keep it charged. The music, dancing, and comedy are charming, but the acting is amateurish, its characters are paper-thin, and it just drags itself on by the end.\n\nThree Stooges fans will be happy to see that Ted Healy and the boys have very juicy roles in the film, and are a constant presence throughout. They often have the best lines all to themselves…\n\n“We sure could use a tomato like Marge in the show.”\n\n“Don’t call a swell dish like that a tomato!”\n\nThe ending is fun, with a swell musical number with a pretty cool set that resembles a coiled snake. And the cast gets a great send off as the film fades into a radio studio and finishes off with Myrt and Marge singing into the microphone, harking back to the film’s roots in radio programming. Too bad everything beforehand feels like half of a movie.\n\nNotes:\n\nMyrt and Marge is based on a radio series which also starred Myrtle Vail and Donna Damerel (real life mother and daughter) in the title roles. The series lasted from 1933-1946. In 1941, however, Damerel died in childbirth. She was replaced by actress Helen Mack for the rest of the program’s run.\n\nThis is the only feature film (excluding short subjects, of course) that Ted Healy collaborator (and girlfriend) Bonnie Bonnell was ever in. She appears as a hopeful girl constantly attempting to sneak past Healy and the Stooges and get in the dance show.\n\nAt one point in the film, while messing around with a piano making up his own stage act, Ted Healy breaks out into the song “Mammy!” This is a reference to a famous stage actor that specialized in blackface, Al Jolson. While non-politically correct nowadays, back then, he was quite popular. The Three Stooges sing “Mammy!” again in the 1940 short All the World’s a Stooge.\n\nThis is the only film the Three Stooges ever made for Universal Pictures. At the time, Ted Healy and the trio were under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nThe Three Stooges are credited as “Howard, Fine, & Howard.”\n\nMoe Howard appeared in the following shorts and films\n\nBroadway to Hollywood (Feature Film)\n\nLarry Fine appeared in the following films\n\nStage Mother (Feature Film)\n\nCurly Howard appeared in the following films\n\nBroadway to Hollywood (Feature Film)\n\nShemp Howard appeared in the following shorts\n\nSaltwater Daffy (Short Subject)\n\nIn the Dough (Short Subject)\n\nClose Relations (Short Subject)\n\nPaul Revere Jr. (Short Subject)\n\nHere Comes Flossie! (Short Subject)\n\nTed Healy appeared in the following shorts and films\n\nStop, Sadie, Stop (Short Subject)\n\nStage Mother (Feature Film)\n\nBombshell (Feature Film)"
