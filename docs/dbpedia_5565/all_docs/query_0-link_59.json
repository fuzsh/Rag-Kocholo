        "text": "In the beginning of the movie, Coach Boone had to build ethos for himself because of racial differences. Coach Boone, being of African American descent, was hired over their current caucasian coach and this caused the white football players to boycott the team until Coach Yoast became their assistant coach. Coach Boone lead his team by example and his dedication to his craft. He showed the players that he did not care about what color you wore on your skin, but of the sport that brought them together. During his speech he states “I don’t care if you like each other or not. But you will respect each other. And maybe, I don’t know, maybe we’ll learn to play this game like men” (Boone). He uses the built trust aspect of ethos very well to close this speech.\n\nIn Remember the Titans we witness Coach Boone fighting for civil rights, signifying the image of an outsider integrating into a foreign white team as their coach. Director Boaz Yakin, uses techniques to strengthen Coach Boone’s character where the initial hate and disrespect towards him succours the development of a meaningful arc. The disrespect and aggression is employed when a brick is thrown through his house window, threatening him with the derogatory coloured comments calling him “Coach Coon”. The pressure of quitting was not felt and heroically he encompasses the journey with Yakin emphasising Boones evocative discipline and determination forcing integration amongst the segregated football team. This technique is employed when we witness Coach Boone stepping up, pushing equality for the players in a determined strike to stop racial abuse for good. His actions initiate the forced building of friendship and acceptance when he forces both races to get to know and accept each other at the camp. Yakin heightens the themes of overcoming racism when Boone rallies the troops together to support their team mate during a sad time. Instinctively, the implicit segregation is evoked further bringing unity to the team, Coach Boone emerges as a ‘hero’ to both the coloured and white community.\n\nRemember the Titans is directed by Boaz Yakin and stars Denzel Washington as Coach Herman Boone, Will Patton as Bill Yoast, Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, and Wood Harris as Julius Campbell. The movie takes place in 1971, at T.C Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia. The high school had recently integrated, where both Americans and African Americans conjoin to the same school. The main social issue in the movie was racism, because the Americans didn’t want to be a part of the same school as the African Americans, but they play on the same football team. They also didn’t want to be coached by Herman Boone, because he was a different race from them and Coach Yoast coached most of the white players. Remember the Titans teaches us we can put our differences aside and work together as a team to achieve a goal.\n\nIn the movie, Coach Boone is a master motivator. He does an excellent job of energizing his players, sustaining the motivation, directing the motivation to the right players at the right time, and also knowing when to stop motivating. The satisfaction progression hypothesis is also displayed in the movie. Coach Boone knows that the small things, such as making the routine plays in the game, must be done first before the main goal can be achieved, winning the game. He also has a high expectancy of his team. He believes that the effort of his team will lead to performance and that the performance will lead to results. He expects his team to practice just as hard as they play in the game. Julius Campbell and Gary Bertier, the two main characters on the team, are also excellent motivators. They get their teammates pumped up before and during the game.\n\nIn the begging of the film, Herman Boone which is Denzel Washington was brought in as an assistant coach to join the all-white coaching team. Couple days later, because of high school rule Coach Boone had to be a head coach. But at first he was unwilling to take the offer the head coaching job at first because same things had happened to him when a white coach was selected as head coach over him in South Carolina. In this scene you can tell Coach Boone respects everybody and not hating people. But soon He finally accepts the head coach when he sees that the black people lived in the town saw him as a symbol of pride and hope because he could be the one could overcome the racism in the town. When he talks with coach Yoast, coach Yoast was worried because his white kids won’t start the football team but Boone told him “I aint going to cut them and eat them. Best player will play color won’t matter”. In this sentence he doesn’t care black or white or not, he wants to best player to win the games\n\nBoone and his family face horrible experiences when moving to Alexandria. When moving to the neighborhood, many neighbors were so upset but many were also happy that he didn’t back down. He was offered the head coach position but turned it down because he felt it would be incredibly disrespectful to Coach Yoast. Boone & Yoast agreed to make the relationship work. The African American students meet with Coach Boone in the gym, the meeting turns into a disaster when Coach Yoast and the white students arrive and disturb the meeting. Gerry Bertier was one of the students among the crowd of white students to interrupt. “I’m Gerry Bertier. I’m the only All-America you got on this team. If you want us to play for you, you reserve over half the positions …we don’t need any of your people on defense we’re already set.” said by Gary Bertier to Coach Boone. Boone makes it clear that all players will be on the team regardless of the color of their skin.\n\nThey recruit guys from soccer, basketball, a farm and even other football teams to come and play for them. Lengyel has a new vision for Marshall, and calls them the “Young Thundering Herd.” Jack is the person to do things that most coaches wouldn’t do because that just in his personality. As a result he seeks out help from Bobby Bowden, the coach of the University of West Virginia. Jack asks him “if He and Dawson can see the coaches’ videos, plays, and handbooks and even if he had any tips for them.” Bowden laughs at first and asks “if Jack was serious…” He then see that the men are serious and allows them to view the tapes, rules, handbooks and anything else they wanted. He does this because Bowden understands that a team is in grief and confusion. When this happens Dawson’s disbelief that he had about the team and Jack trying to help changes and he becomes a little bit more optimistic about the future of Marshall and the town.\n\nAs a leader you must be real with yourself and others for fake will not fix or implement change. In his position Herman Boone was real in a sense that he was genuinely honest and upfront in every encounter with others, he does not sugar coat things or beat around the bush, and instead of telling you what you want to hear, he tells you what you need to know. At times though it seems that Boone’s raw emotions such as his attitude, assertiveness and arrogance are a bit too real, we are able to see that they are key components in how he establishes his sense of urgency throughout the organization. At the start of the movie, the sense of urgency created by Boone’s attitude almost lead the team in the wrong direction, as the players did not respect or understand the way he went about doing things. For example, before the players leave for camp Boone is approached by Bertier about positions on the team, in the midst of the conversation Boone says “You take a look at her. Cause once you step on that bus you aint got your mama no more. You got your brothers on the team and you got your daddy. You know who your daddy is, doncha? Gary, if you want to play on this football team, you answer me when I ask you who is your daddy?” Statements such as these do not usually sit well with others, many including myself would find this very disrespectful. On the other hand Coach Boone’s ability to be real with himself as well as others allows him to express raw emotion and concern that explains his reasoning behind his actions, As shown in the scene after the first game when Yoates challenges Coach Boone’s public criticism in regards to Petey, he replies “you think you’re doing these boys a favor, by taking them aside every time I come down on them…I may be a mean cuss but I’m the same mean cuss with everyone on that football field the world does not give a damn how sensitive these kids are…you are crippling them” the tough love shown by Coach Boone towards his players expresses a real"
