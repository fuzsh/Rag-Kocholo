        "text": "Many celebrities and noteworthy individuals have called South Carolina home at some point in their lives. From actors to musicians, politicians, and athletes. And some elected for South Carolina to become their final resting place after death. In all honesty, there are way too many to name. But as we are approaching fall and spooky season (I know I know, it is a ways off but I’m ready), I figured sharing 7 of the famous people who are buried in South Carolina would be appropriate. And I have to say, some of these are people I would not have expected even had connections to the Palmetto State. Others make perfect sense are they were important members of the local community.\n\nEach of the 7 individuals included on this list is buried somewhere in the state of South Carolina. Some were buried years ago and others more recently. Final resting sites include a variety of places in the state. Each of these people left their mark and legacy on the world in their time. And they will forever be linked to our great state. Chances are there are a few names on this list you’ll recognize."
