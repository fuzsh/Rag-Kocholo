        "text": "San Francisco State University\n\nActor Delroy Lindo, who has been nominated for Tony and SAG awards, graduated from SFSU before appearing in films such as Gone in 60 Seconds. The school's grads have earned Oscar nominations for 15 consecutive years.\n\nEmerson College\n\nComedian and actor Denis Leary, known for co-creating and starring in FX drama Rescue Me, graduated from Emerson in 1979. The school opened the new Emerson Los Angeles building on Sunset Boulevard this year, allowing it to double its student body.\n\nWesleyan\n\nJoss Whedon graduated from Wesleyan in 1987 before creating Buffy the Vampire Slayer and then directing The Avengers. The school was recently awarded a $2 million challenge grant by the Mellon Foundation.\n\nUSC\n\nJudd Apatow, the director of such comedies as Knocked Up, is an alum of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, which opened the new Michelle and Kevin Douglas IMAX Theatre and Immersive Lab in June.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina School of the Arts\n\nFalling Skies actor Will Patton attended the 20-year-old school in Winston-Salem. The institution looks like a Hollywood studio backlot and has fielded a small studio's worth of talent, including Mary-Louise Parker and Danny McBride, directors Jeff Nichols and David Gordon Green, writer Travis Beacham and Summer Shelton, Sundance's first Bingham Ray producing fellow.\n\nChapman University\n\nHow does one get to Hollywood? Start in Orange County: The 1,500 students at Chapman's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts nabbed 607 high-powered internships during the 2013-14 school year. Notable alumni include Comedy Central development executive Adam Londy, and Cynthia Pascoe, executive director of global promotions for 20th Century Fox.\n\nColorado Film School\n\nMore than 64 percent of graduates from the Denver school work in the movie industry, including a dozen students and alumni who worked on Kevin Connolly's upcoming feature Dear Eleanor. Notable alumni include postproduction technician Aaron Kroger (The Avengers).\n\nBoston University\n\nBU alum Joe Roth (right), with Anne Hathaway and Mia Wasikowska. BU starts its students out with a solid liberal-arts background at its Massachusetts home campus and also sends 200 film pilgrims a year to Los Angeles to study in a high-rise across the street from SAG headquarters.\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\n\nUT's Department of Radio-Television-Film is the only non-California public university with a \"Semester in L.A.\" program, which will celebrate its 10th anniversary as well as its 1,000th student in 2015. Back in Austin, UT has instituted a new 3D production program and, thanks to a $50 million 2013 gift from the Moody Foundation, now calls itself the Moody College of Communication. UT had an extra reason to break out the champagne this year: The best actor Oscar victory of alum Matthew McConaughey.\n\nDePaul University\n\nProducer Amanda Pflieger (Animals) is among the notable alumni of DePaul's School of Cinema and Interactive Media. Headquartered in Chicago's Loop, it \"is a very sexy film school,\" says Trainspotting writer Irvine Welsh, who starts teaching there this fall.\n\nRingling College\n\nMost of the 1,200 students at Ringling in Sarasota, Fla., study illustration, computer design or game design. They are sought by as many as 70 recruiters a year from Disney to Yahoo, helping them live up to the school's motto, \"Shattering the myth of the starving artist.\" Says spokeswoman Christine Lange: \"We're working on a graphic novel project with Luke Wilson, a web series with Dylan McDermott, brand-identity work with Anna Paquin's and Stephen Moyer's production company CASM and exploratory graphic translation of a script with Richard Dreyfuss.\" Notable alumni include writer-director Jason Letkiewicz\n\nSavannah College of Art and Design\n\nSCAD alums Nickson Fong and Steve LaVietes won Sci-Tech Awards from the Academy in 2012 for their work in computer graphics; another 24 SCADsters worked on Life of Pi, and SCAD grad Jason Brown, a grandson of James Brown, worked on the music legend's biopic Get on Up. SCAD also sponsors the 16-year-old Savannah Film Festival, which attracts such guests as Alexander Payne, Jeremy Irons and Alec Baldwin. Its Atlanta program has added an MA and MFA in film and TV.\n\nRhode Island School of Design\n\nRISD's Film/Animation/Video Department is artsy enough to call movies \"time-based media\" yet pop enough to produce alum Seth MacFarlane. To help students find their voice, the Providence-based school offers instruction in media ranging from hand-drawn and digital animation to live-action filmmaking and what it calls \"open-media forms.\"\n\nStanford University\n\nNotable Stanford alumni include documentarians Richard Berge, Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk. Visiting giants of the form, such as Frederick Wiseman and Les Blank, have given master classes. In 2015, the program will move to the new McMurtry Building in the $227 million Stanford Arts District.\n\nSyracuse University\n\nProducer Thom Oliphant (center) is among Syracuse's notable alumni. \"We're not isolated in an ivory tower of theory,\" says new Syracuse chancellor Kent Syverud. \"Most students have immersion experiences outside Syracuse: We have boots on the ground in New York, D.C., Florence, Paris, Madrid, Dubai, Chile â€” and Hollywood.\" During \"Sorkin Week,\" for example, film students as well as students from Syracuse's drama school (No. 13 on THR's Top 25 Drama Schools list) spend a week with The Newsroom creator Aaron Sorkin at SU Los Angeles."
