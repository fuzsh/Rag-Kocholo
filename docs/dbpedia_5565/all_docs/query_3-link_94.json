        "text": "Chadwick Boseman wasn't the best player on an Anderson-based AAU basketball team that qualified for a national tournament in 1993, but the Anderson native was among the most memorable.\n\n\"On road trips, he'd be in back of the van, with a light on, reading books so thick they were hard to carry, while everybody else was laughing and have teen-age fun,\" remembers lifelong Anderson resident Marion Tarrant, who coached the team.\n\nThe team was successful, and the state runner-up, largely because it had a great athlete in Shaun Ellis, who later played football at the University of Tennessee and the National Football League. High-scoring guard Chris McGowens was another star of the team, which qualified for the national competition by finishing second in South Carolina's Youth Basketball of America (YBOA) championship.\n\nBoseman was a quality player, but Tarrant saw in Boseman a 15-year-old who seemed more inspired by interests off the court.\n\n\"He already had great people skills, and because of that I thought he would go to college and become a very good teacher, maybe and administrator or a superintendent,\" Tarrant recalls. \"I always saw him in education, in some field, because he loved to read.\"\n\nBoseman, who at 40 has emerged as a household name around the country, is likely to gain more notoriety with the release of the movie \"Black Panther,\" in February. Boseman plays the lead role in a superhero tale that is expected to do well at the box office.\n\nBoseman's national fame delights Tarrant, who remembers a young Boseman with \"a very humble spirit,\" who helped team chemistry.\n\n\"He was a young man of very good character, was involved in his church and family,\" Tarrant said. \"I think he enjoyed basketball, but it was just something to do ... he wasn't one of those guys who would live it, sleep it, dream about it.\"\n\nBoseman also played the lead role in \"42,\" a 2013 movie in which he portrayed baseball star Jackie Robinson, \"Get on UP,\" in which he portrayed singer James Brown, and \"Marshall,\" where he portrayed Thurgood Marshall.\n\nTarrant might be the only person with personal connections to four of those who rank among Anderson's most famous native sons — Boseman, former NBA player Larry Nance, former Major League player Jim Rice, and James \"Radio\" Kennedy, a lifelong Anderson resident whose loyalty to Hanna High School was the subject of a powerful 2003 movie.\n\nTarrant knew Kennedy long before the uplifting movie, which features Cuba Gooding in the role of Kennedy and Ed Harris as Hanna football coach Harold Jones, made \"Radio\" famous.\n\n\"Back in the day, my dad ran 'City Line Grocery,' a small community store. Radio and his brother came in there a lot and often helped me out when I worked there as a kid,\" Tarrant said.\n\nBoseman, Kennedy, Nance and Rice are all mentioned prominently in a recent discussion on the Independent Mail's Our Town Memories Facebook page in response to page member Jimmy Staggs' question about Anderson County's most famous person.\n\nIn a thread of more than 200 responses, \"Radio\" is the most frequent nomination.\n\nWhen page member John M. Doker cast his vote, he noted that \"This is God showing us the strength we all have if we develop and use it. Radio is a blessing to us all.\"\n\nJudy Wilson Lamb-Cullipher said \"Hands down, the most famous name you'll hear as being a native of Anderson is Radio.\"\n\nAnd Brenda McCoy Drady added \"Radio for sure. I don't know anyone else in Anderson who had a movie made about his life, and is still well-known by everyone.\"\n\nPersonalities from movies, television and sports dominate the list of nominations on the Our Town Memories Facebook page.\n\nAmong them:\n\nG.
