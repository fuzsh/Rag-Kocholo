        "text": "Moving from Orangeburg, South Carolina to the states capital, Columbia at the age of 2, Angell Conwell began her journey in entertainment at a very young age. After winning numerous awards locally and in the surrounding states of Georgia and North Carolina, she signed with Wilhelmina's Kids Division in New York. Always one to challenge herself, Angell begged for her parents permission to audition for August Wilson's highly acclaimed, \"Fences\". After landing the role she realized, commitment to pursuing a career in entertainment was exactly what she would set out to do.\n\nAt age 11, Angell and her mother, with only enough funds to stretch a couple months, relocated to Los Angeles for pilot season. It was quite an eye opener for her. After a very trying season, on the exact day she was scheduled to move back to Columbia, she booked the CBS pilot \"On Our Own\". Although, the pilot wasn't picked up to series, the network noticed this vibrant young actress and soon flew her back to California to audition for the role of Meshach Taylor's daughter on the CBS show \"Dave's World\". She landed the role.\n\nAt 17, John Singleton cast Angell in her first silver screen role as Kim in \"Baby Boy\" sharing the screen with Tyrese, Taraji P. Hensen & Omar Gooding. Immediately after, Conwell began filming the Lions Gate comedic remake \"The Wash\", and MGM's wildly popular \"Soul Plane\" alongside Kevin Hart and Sofia Vergara. She's guest starred and recurred on dozens of hit shows.\n\nAngell was presented with Columbia, South Carolina's Key To The City on February 5, 2019. This day was also deemed Angell Conwell Day by Mayor Steven Benjamin.\n\nSlim, lovely, and sexy brunette looker Lauren Michelle Hill was born on June 27, 1979 in Columbia, South Carolina. Lauren has two brothers and a sister. Her mother owned a modeling agency. Hill started her modeling career as a child model for department store catalogs and posing for the art on Hasbro toy boxes. As a teen model, Lauren did ads for hair care products. Moreover, Hill was also a child actress who appeared in the movies, Made in Heaven (1987) and Pfundskerle (1995). She attended the University of South Carolina, where she was a cheerleader and studied journalism. Lauren was spotted by a \"Playboy\" scout at a swimsuit competition in St. Croix. She graced the cover of the October, 2000 issue of \"Playboy\" and was chosen to be the Playmate of the Month in the February, 2001 issue of the famous men's magazine. Hill has appeared in several \"Playboy\" videos and posed for a handful of newsstand special editions. She's been featured in music videos for such artists as Bryan Adams, Weezer, Marc Anthony, and Justin Timberlake. In addition, Lauren has modeled for Guess? jeans, hosted Ultimate Fighting, Dub, and Supercross, and worked as a VJ for Ampd Mobile. Hill not only has made guest appearances on episodes of the TV shows, Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989) and Entourage (2004), but has also appeared as herself on the reality TV series, Fear Factor (2001), Meet the Barkers (2005) and The Girls of the Playboy Mansion (2005).\n\nSouthern-bred Mary-Louise Parker was born on August 2, 1964 in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the youngest of four children of Judge John Morgan Parker, and the former Caroline Louise Morell. She is of mostly Swedish, English, and Scottish descent. Her father's occupation took the family both around the country and abroad while growing up.\n\nParker showed potential in her teens and majored in acting in her college years, graduating from the North Carolina School of the Arts. Beginning her acting career with a part on the daytime soap Ryan's Hope (1975), Mary decided to test the waters in New York, and after work on the off-Broadway stage in the late 1980s, made her Broadway debut with \"Prelude to a Kiss\" in 1990, where she won the Theatre World Award, the Clarence Derwent Award and a Tony nomination.\n\nFilms and TV quickly followed and she quickly gained attention. She provided both poignant and amusing as the token femme friend to a group of gay men in the AIDS drama Freundschaft fürs Leben (1989), but really caught fire with her feisty, standout performance in Grüne Tomaten (1991), holding her own against such female powerhouses as Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates and Mary Stuart Masterson. Dubbed by some as the \"long-suffering girl next door,\" she played such noble offbeat miserables and cast-asides in Grand Canyon - Im Herzen der Stadt (1991), Naked in New York (1993), Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Der Klient (1994) Kaffee, Milch & Zucker (1995), in which she was the AIDS victim this time, Portrait of a Lady (1996), Der Macher (1997), Black Devil (1999), Roter Drache (2002) and Pipe Dream - Lügen haben Klempnerbeine (2001).\n\nPreferring quality over quantity, she perfected her craft with offbeat roles in independent features and did not abandon her theater roots. She copped a slew of acting prizes for her stage work in \"How I Learned to Drive\" (1996) and, most notably, \"Proof\" in 2000, wherein she won nearly every award there is to attain, including the prestigious Tony. Her marquee name still does not command what it should, but a picture or production with Mary-Louise Parker in it usually guarantees a strong critical reception. Unmarried, she did enter into a longtime companionship with actor Billy Crudup after the twosome appeared opposite each other in the 1996 play, \"Bus Stop\". They went their separate ways in 2003, amid major controversy (she was pregnant at the time).\n\nMary Louise continues to divide her time equally and skillfully on TV, film and the stage. The powerful TV miniseries adaptation of Tony Kushner heralded award-winning Broadway play Engel in Amerika (2003), directed by Mike Nichols, earned the actress supporting performance Golden Globe and Emmy awards. She also earned a Tony nomination for the Broadway show, \"Reckless\", a year later but truly turned heads and wowed audiences the year after that in the highly acclaimed 7-season Showtime series Weeds - Kleine Deals unter Nachbarn (2005), earning another Golden Globe and several Emmy nominations for her amazing performance as Nancy Botwin, a relatively naïve suburban housewife and mother who courts serious trouble with the law and drug cartels when she turns into a neighborhood drug dealer for sustenance after her husband dies suddenly.\n\nInto the millennium, Mary has continued with compelling work in such films as R.E.D. 2 - Noch Älter. Härter. Besser. (2013), R.I.P.D. (2013), Jamesy Boy (2014), Behaving Badly: Brav sein war gestern (2014), Chronically Metropolitan (2016), Golden Exits (2017) and Red Sparrow (2018). TV roles have included recurring roles on The Blacklist (2013) and the sci-fi thriller Mr. Mercedes (2017).\n\nHer first child is eighteen-year-old William Atticus Parker -- a director, writer and actor. Adopting a second child from Ethiopia, Mary Louise was acknowledged in 2013 for her significant contributions to Hope North, an organization that works in the educating and healing of young victims caught in Uganda's civil war. Her memoir-in-letters, Dear Mr. You, came out in 2015.\n\nDirect from Spartanburg, South Carolina, this tall, blonde actress has earned the respect of stage and film audiences alike for her many touching portrayals of matter-of-fact, down-to-earth Southern folk. For someone who first attracted attention as a hash-slinging replacement for Diane Ladd (herself a replacement for the ever-popular Polly Holliday) in the final, languishing years of the popular CBS sitcom Imbiß mit Biß (1976), Celia Weston certainly has evolved into one of the more sought-after character performers of \"Deep South\" film drama.\n\nBorn December 14, 1951, and raised in South Carolina, Celia, along with her sister, enjoyed creating their own little world of characters, acting out small skits and later began appearing in local plays. She did not, however, meet the unanimous encouragement of her family when the one-time art and psychology major at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, decided to do an abrupt about-face and study acting. She earned an Artist Diploma in Drama at the North Carolina School of the Arts before moving to London to continue her training. More than determined, she eventually returned to the States in 1977 and studied with Uta Hagen and Herbert Berghof while slinging hash herself in New York City. In between, there was sporadic regional and off-off-Broadway work along with summer stock. At age 28, Celia made a big leap with her Broadway debut in \"Loose Ends\" (1979) starring Kevin Kline. Following her prime theater role in Edward Albee's \"The Lady from Dubuque\" in 1980 and a small part in Clint Eastwood's film Da steht der ganze Freeway Kopf (1981), Hollywood showed her the money when she became the new Southern-fried waitress in town alongside Linda Lavin and Beth Howland on the \"Alice\" series.\n\nHer character of Jolene was given rather short shrift during the four seasons (1981-1985) she appeared. Although Celia valiantly tried the invest the role with some sass, she was the newcomer and was too often overshadowed by the other two. Following the show's demise, she had a number of lean years before her luck changed again. In 1988, she was handed a couple of featured roles in the movies Stars and Bars - Der ganz normale amerikanische Wahnsinn (1988) and Morgen fängt das Leben an (1988). Her penchant for toned-down, unaffected realism was not overlooked. While interspersing theater roles with the sudden upswing of film parts now coming her way, she finally came into her own in both venues in the mid-to-late 1990s. After earning critical applause for her brittle dramatic turn as the backwoods mother of a murdered child in Dead Man Walking - Sein letzter Gang (1995), she went on to win an Outer Critics Award and Tony nomination for her Southern matron in Broadway's acclaimed \"The Last Night of Ballyhoo\" (1997).\n\nPreferring art-house obscurity to mainstream popularity, Celia has stayed true for the most part with classier, character-driven drama and it has paid off in career dividends. An always interesting presence, her gals can tangle and backbite with the best of them or show true grit and/or extreme emotional fragility at times of unbearable sorrow. Celia has also played a variety of dialects over the years. A gregarious and eccentric turn as a possible mother to a searching Ben Stiller in the wonderful Flirting with Disaster - Ein Unheil kommt selten allein (1996) led to her Civil War wife in Wer mit dem Teufel reitet (1999); her grieving, prejudicial Teutonic mother in Schnee, der auf Zedern fällt (1999); the part of Cate Blanchett's haughty aunt in Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999); and the Southern belle-like mental patient in K-Pax (2001). In addition, her Southern roots have complimented such Tennessee Williams' plays as \"Summer and Smoke\" and \"Suddenly Last Summer\" on Broadway.\n\nInto the millennium, Celia is still going strong. She has been a vibrant presence in such ensemble films as In the Bedroom (2001), Dem Himmel so fern (2002) and The Village - Das Dorf (2004). In 2005, she received one of her best roles in years as the dressed-down Southern matriarch in the obscure independent film Junikäfer (2005), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMore recent films include matronly parts in Joshua - Der Erstgeborene (2007), Invasion (2007), The Box - Du bist das Experiment (2009), Knight and Day (2010), Suddenly Single (2014), In the Radiant City (2016), Dancing Queens (2019) and Quad (2020). She has essayed just as many parts on both dramatic and comedic series TV, including regular/recurring roles on Our Willie (1913), Memphis Beat (2010), American Horror Story (2011), Modern Family (2009) and Hunters (2020).\n\nJaimie Alexander was born in Greenville, South Carolina, but moved with her family to Grapevine, Texas, when she was four years old. She took theatre classes in grade school as a hobby but was kicked out in high school because she could not sing, and so she took up sports instead. At age 17 she substituted for a friend at a meeting with a scouting agency and she met her manager, Randy James, who sent her some scripts. After graduating from high school she moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue acting.\n\nHer career was launched in 2003 when she was cast in the leading role of Hanna Thompson in the low-budget award-winning film The Other Side (2006). According to the DVD commentary, she was originally at the audition to help out by reading against the male actors, but director Gregg Bishop decided to cast her in the leading role after hearing her perform the lines. Her second role was in 2004 in Squirrel Trap (2004), in which she played the co-lead role of Sara. A year later she was cast as Jessi XX on the ABC Family series Kyle XY (2006), in which she played the role of a superhuman being created by scientists as a laboratory experiment. She was nominated for the Saturn Awards as \"Best Supporting Actress on Television\" for that role in 2008.\n\nHer biggest role came in 2011, when she was cast as Lady Sif, a warrior goddess of Asgard, in the blockbuster from Marvel Comics, Thor (2011). She later reprised her role in its sequel, Thor: The Dark Kingdom (2013)."
