She moved to Istanbul, Turkey's cultural and artistic hub, and joined the cast of Cok Guzel Hareketler 2, a popular TV comedy series, where she remained for two seasons as a writer and an actor. Didem reached one of her childhood dreams when, in 2022, she was cast for the leading role Ava in the workshop of American musical theater author and composer Jenna Cox-Hadley's new musical, Wait For Her, held at the Turkish-American Association. After being a part of this workshop, she decided to pursue her goals and receive a master's degree in the US in order to enhance her perspective and knowledge, as she considers an actor to be a lifelong student.\n\nDeon “DK” Turner is an actor, photographer, director and writer from Columbia, SC.
