        "text": "GARRETT Randall was first introduced back in season three of Yellowstone.\n\nBut what do we know about the ex-con and who is he related to?\n\nWho is Garrett Randall in Yellowstone?\n\nGarrett Randall joined the show for season three, with his true identity as Jamie Dutton's biological father revealed in episode seven.\n\nDespite a rocky start to their relationship, Jamie and Garrett eventually start to bond.\n\nIt's revealed that Garrett is an ex-con who has spent thirty years in prison for the murder of Jamie's mother, Phyllis, who he killed after coming home and discovering that she was being unfaithful to him.\n\nGarrett tries to justify his actions by telling Jamie that his mother was negligent and addicted to drugs and that, ultimately, killing her shielded Jamie from harm.\n\nInitially, Jamie fights with his dad, but the two seem to be finding common ground by the season three finale.\n\nHowever more revelations in season four of Yellowstone that could all be set to change.\n\nDid Garrett order the attack on John Dutton?\n\nOne of the main mysteries of the show's fourth season is centered around finding out who was behind the attack on John Dutton.\n\nAnd the truth may threaten the foundations of Jamie's shaky relationship with his father.\n\nIn the fourth episode, Jamie discovers that his dad is an old cellmate of Riggins, the man behind the hit on John Dutton.\n\nIt could all just be a coincidence or a red herring, but it certainly looks like Garrett could be linked to the attack.\n\nWho plays Garrett Randall in Yellowstone?\n\nGarrett Randall is played by Will Patton, a 67-year-old American actor originally from Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nPatton starred in the TNT science fiction series Falling Skies, as well as several movies including Remember The Titans, Armageddon and Gone In 60 Seconds.\n\nThe actor has also voiced multiple audiobooks."
