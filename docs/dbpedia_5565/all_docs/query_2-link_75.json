Lending his acting talents to productions such as Billy Budd, Becket, J.B., You Can't Take It With You, Barefoot In The Park, The Dark of the Moon, and numerous others, he earned the Sidney Blackmer best actor award before receiving his B.A. in theatre arts. In New York, Tatum quickly earned his entry into the Actors Equity Association in 1971 and the Screen Actors Guild, as well as the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists, soon after. His union cards in hand, he has performed on the Broadway stage in productions such as Man of La Mancha; in off-Broadway theatres such as the Equity Library Theatre, Playwrights Horizons, and Provincetown Rep; and has done extensive work in numerous regional theatres throughout the United States.

Following this production, he raised enough capital from members of the Salisbury community to form \"Playmoore Productions\" with the plan to tour non-equity professional productions. Moore's first venture was the very popular musical Godspell. After gaining exclusive rights to originate and produce the first non-equity tour of this musical, his production of Godspell was cast in New York and toured the southeast and mid-west United States for almost two years. This production of Godspell launched Moore's professional career as well as that of soon-to-be Broadway and television star Scott Holmes, also from the Catawba College class of 1974. Moore then based his center of operation in New York City, where, among other activities, he worked on national bus and truck tours of Broadway shows.

A talented Catawba College performer, receiving numerous Blue Masque acting awards; director, chosen to direct a Blue Masque main stage production; and designer, Gloster was honored with the theatre department's Florence Busby Corriher Outstanding Achievement Award in his senior year.

Gloster received Charlotte's Best Designer Award for productions performed in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998, and 2004. While also discovering his theatre talents in demand as an actor and director, he somehow found time to begin working in film and television. Gloster received the 2001 Art Directors Guild Award for \"outstanding production values in a TV movie\" for The Last Brickmaker In America, starring Sidney Poitier. He was nominated for the same award in 2004. Gloster currently makes his living in art direction for feature films and television.
