It made me laugh, cry, dance, sing and cheer what a triumph! Well done Centre Stage!”\n\n– Rhonda Rawlings\n\n\"I just want to give a heartfelt thank you to this amazing staff!! I attended the final show of the Color Purple on 6/5/22. It was my first time attending a show at this venue so I was unaware of the seating& had a panic attack because of my anxiety. The staff was there to assist me & changed my seating for me & my Mother. I'm so grateful for them!! I got to sit in the front row & enjoy the AMAZING show! They were so helpful & I'm thankful for them!! May God please continue to bless this business & staff!!\"\n\n\"I forgot how much I LOVED a small community theatre until last night when we went to see 9 to 5 at Centre Stage. I saw 9 to 5 on Broadway about 15 years ago and honestly enjoyed the show at Centre Stage more. The layout is phenomenal. There isn't a bad seat in the house. We will definitely be back!\"\n\n\"Wonderful intimate experience of professional players . We love the venue. A great date night adventure; dinner and take in a show. Short walk from Main Street.\"\n\n\"The cast of The Color Purple production delivered an amazing performance!
