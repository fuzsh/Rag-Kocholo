        "text": "By Oscar Wilde\n\nDirected by Maria Aitken\n\nOscar Wilde’s wildly entertaining comedy sparkles with dazzling wordplay and hilariously unlikely situations. This “trivial comedy for serious people” features two carefree bachelors, Jack and Algernon, each with a carefully hidden double life. But when Algernon discovers that Jack has been posing as a man named Ernest to escape to the city, he promptly travels to Jack’s country estate to pose as the fictional figure himself! Silliness ensues with whimsical ingénues, jealous fiancées, indomitable dowagers, and the most famous handbag in theatre history. The Globe’s lavish production of this timeless classic offers the unmissable opportunity to see what the London Telegraph calls “the most perfect comedy in the English language.”\n\nVideo: Barry Edelstein talks about Oscar Wilde’s classic.\n\nRunning time: 2 hours, 25 minutes, including one intermission.\n\nProduction Sponsors\n\nNikki and Ben Clay\n\nAnn Davies\n\nBrian and Silvija Devine\n\nJean and Gary Shekhter\n\nDarlene Marcos Shiley\n\nUnited\n\nThe Erna Finci Viterbi Artistic Director Fund\n\nThis production is supported in part by the Jean and Gary Shekhter Fund for Classic Theatre.\n\nGroups of 10 or more may purchase discounted tickets, and tickets may also be purchased as part of a money-saving season package.\n\nLearn more about group discounts\n\nLearn more about season package\n\nProgram\n\nInsights Seminar\n\nThis series provides Old Globe patrons with an opportunity to closely connect with productions both onstage and backstage.
