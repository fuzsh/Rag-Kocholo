Starting with a trip to Red Cloud, Nebraska in 2013, these place-based courses connect the incredibly diverse students of the Goodrich Scholarship Program with the residents of smaller, more insulated Nebraska communities. In preparation for these trips, students read a book set in rural Nebraska, which they then discuss in its actual setting while serving the local community. Subsequent trips took students to Bancroft, Central City, Elmwood, and Beatrice, Nebraska, where students served in a variety of capacities, doing everything from maintaining historic sites to assisting elder residents of the Winnebago Reservation. As well, Todd frequently collaborates with Ollie Webb, Inc., an organization that enriches the lives of people with developmental disabilities. in 2023, he was awarded Community Leader of the Year by Ollie Webb.
