Even those born with a natural acting talent can learn from the professionals. Take some acting classes in person or virtually to hone your skills if you’ve done some acting, or to learn the basics if you’re just beginning.\n\nHave a quality headshot and acting resume. Most casting calls will require you to submit some information about yourself before you are able to audition. A professional photo and polished resume can make you stand out among the competition.\n\nGain some acting experience. Whether it’s a musical at school, a community theater play, or a video for a local non-profit, there are many ways to gain some experience on the stage before trying out for paid roles.\n\nFind and attend casting calls. The best way to find legit acting opportunities is by working with an agent. They will know what casting calls are the best fit for you and will likely be able to help you secure an audition.\n\nPractice, practice, practice. Actors not only need to practice for upcoming auditions or roles, they also need to practice when they have no leads. Continuously practicing your craft will ensure you are ready when the time comes.\n\nTypes of acting\n\nThere are so many ways to put your acting skills to good use. You may find you prefer one type of acting over another, or you may enjoy trying different things throughout your career.\n\nFilm or TV actor\n\nCommercials\n\nVoiceover acting\n\nTheater\n\nLive entertainment\n\nHow Discovery Spotlight can help your acting career\n\nDiscovery Spotlight provides new actors the training and opportunities they need to launch their careers.
