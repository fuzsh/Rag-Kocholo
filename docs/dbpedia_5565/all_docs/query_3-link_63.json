Combine our cash rebates and film tax incentives to get the best value for your production. Please click one of the boxes below to learn more about our aggressive incentive programs.\n\nIf you are looking for information about our short film grants, please click here: Film Grants.\n\nFilm Production Incentives\n\nSouth Carolina’s Incentive Package is among the best in the country. It offers an easy-to-use rebate and a quick cash return.\n\n1. Employee Wage Rebate: A Qualified Production is eligible for a wage rebate up to twenty-five percent (25%) for the persons employed in conjunction with the South Carolina production. The wages of all South Carolina residents are eligible for the maximum 25% rebate. The wages of all non-resident performing artists (including stunt performers) including crew, are eligible for a 20% rebate\n\nThe following requirements must be met in order to be eligible for the wage rebate:\n\n(a) wages for each qualifying person must be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) for the project and;\n\n(b) wages must be subject to South Carolina withholding tax.\n\n2. South Carolina Supplier Rebate: A Qualified Production is eligible for a rebate up to thirty percent (30%) of qualifying goods and services purchased, rented, or leased by the production company from a South Carolina supplier.\n\n3. Pay No State Sales/Use & Accommodations Tax: 6% – 8.5% You may also qualify for a sales tax exemption. Save on all purchases, rentals, and leases. This is an exemption – taxes are not charged to the production.\n\n4. Pay No Location Fee for State Properties*\n\n5. SC Investor Tax Credits for Your Production (click here)\n\nImportant Points About South Carolina’s Incentive Package\n\nTo be eligible for any of the incentives listed above, the production company must first be approved.\n\nSC’s incentive is a cash rebate, not a tax credit involving brokers and a waiting period.\n\nSC reserves your estimated rebate funds, assuring production that rebate funds are available.\n\nYour rebate check is cut within 30 days of our final audit – use the money in post!\n\nThe wage rebate is assignable to a financial institution – you can use this to cash flow your production.\n\nFeatures, TV pilots, and TV series – and the loan out companies that work for them –are eligible.\n\nTo receive the rebates, a qualified production must spend $1,000,000 in SC. All other incentives (#3 and #4) require only a $250,000 spend.\n\nBefore filming contact the South Carolina Film Commission to receive your incentive application. Once qualified, you’ll begin saving immediately!\n\nSC’s incentive package fosters the development of infrastructure by offering tax credits for investment in a SC motion picture and/or investment in a production or post-production facility. Please refer to the SC Film Commission’s policies and procedures for more details on all of our incentives.\n\n* Please consult the South Carolina Film Commission for all details concerning this incentive.\n\nFilm Infrastructure Investment\n\nInvestors in South Carolina-created motion pictures and/or production/post-production facilities are entitled to state income tax credits based upon their investment amount. Application by the production company and certification by the South Carolina Film Commission is required for all.\n\nMotion Picture Project Tax Credit\n\nA taxpayer may claim an income tax credit of up to twenty percent (20%) of the taxpayer’s cash investment in the development or production of a single SC motion picture.\n\nCredits are limited to $100,000 per taxpayer.\n\nUnused credit may be carried forward fifteen (15) succeeding taxable years.\n\nAll Credits cannot reduce a taxpayer’s income tax liability by more than fifty percent (50%) for any given year.\n\nProduction/Post-Production Facility\n\nA taxpayer may claim an income tax credit of up to twenty percent (20%) for the construction or conversion, or equipping, or any combination of these activities of a motion picture production or post-production facility. Minimum investments in the facilities apply.\n\nTotal credits claimed by all taxpayers may not exceed $5,000,000 in a single qualified facility.\n\nUnused credit may be carried forward fifteen (15) succeeding taxable years.\n\nAll credits cannot reduce a taxpayer’s income tax liability by more than fifty percent (50%) for a given year.\n\nClick here to read the official legislation.\n\nFilm Incentives FAQs\n\nHow does the South Carolina Rebate work?\n\nAre the incentives in the form of tax credits?\n\nHow much is the film and television production incentive?\n\nAre there any caps?\n\nDo you offer Sales Tax Exemptions?\n\nHow do the Sales Tax Exemptions work?\n\nWhat’s the minimum threshold to qualify?\n\nWhat if I cannot spend $1 million dollars in SC on my film?\n\nMust I apply to become qualified to receive the SC cash rebate?\n\nWhat form do I need to fill out to apply for the incentive?\n\nHow long does the incentive application review process take?\n\nMay a production company apply mid-production for a partial film credit?\n\nWhen must SC production activities begin – once I have been approved to receive SC’s cash rebate?\n\nMust I register my production company in the State of South Carolina?\n\nDo I have to complete my project by year-end?\n\nDo commercials qualify?\n\nDo reality TV series qualify?\n\nDoes SC allocate a certain amount of money that can be used for the rebate program each year?\n\nIs there a sunset clause in the SC incentive legislation?\n\nWho qualifies for a 25% cash rebate in SC?\n\nIs above the line talent covered as well as below the line?\n\nMust all hires be South Carolina Residents?\n\nHow is a South Carolina Resident defined?\n\nDo you accept loan outs?\n\nAre there restrictions on the amounts paid to any employee?\n\nWhat if I take a South Carolina crew to another state?\n\nMay a production company use a payroll service company to perform the SC withholding required to receive the cash rebate on wages?\n\nMay a motion picture company obtain a cash rebate for payments made to a loan-out corporation (or personal service corporation) when a payroll service company does the withholding and, what is the proper procedure?\n\nDo employer-paid payroll expenses that are not included in the gross salary payment to the employee (e.g., SUTA/FUTA, FICA, workers compensation, health insurance, pension contributions) qualify for the payroll and production expense credits?\n\nAre box rental expenses paid to employees eligible for the SC rebate?\n\nDoes a production company that fails to withhold or insure that the loan out corporation or personal services company withholds the proper amount still get the rebate?\n\nDo “pass through’s” qualify?\n\nDoes the rental of specialized motion picture equipment from a vendor located outside SC qualify for the rebate?\n\nWhat if the rental is handled by a South Carolina based rental vendor?\n\nAre kit or box rental expenses paid to employees eligible for the SC rebate?\n\nI heard that your supplier rebate is more like 37%. What does that mean?\n\nWho performs the audit?\n\nHow much is the audit?\n\nHow does your audit work?\n\nWhen do I get my cash?\n\nDo you offer Tax Credits as well?\n\nAre there other Federal tax incentives that may be valuable to film productions?\n\nHow does the South Carolina Rebate work?\n\nDo I have to complete my project by year-end?\n\nThe wages of an individual whose wages are $1,000,000 (one million dollars) or more for the production are not eligible for the Wage Rebate.\n\nIs above the line talent covered as well as below the line?\n\nYes. Compensation for payments up to the first $1,000,000 made to above the line personnel, such as producers, directors,writers, and actors, may be qualified if subject to SC taxation.\n\nMay a motion picture company obtain a cash rebate for payments made to a loan-out corporation (or personal service corporation) when a payroll service company does the withholding and, what is the proper procedure?\n\nPayments to a loan-out corporation, rather than to an individual employee, qualify for the SC rebate. This can be handled two ways:\n\nThe Loan Out corporation may register in SC and must withhold and remit a portion of the individual’s wages,\n\nThe payroll company may withhold 2% of the individual’s wages.\n\nIn any case the payroll and loan out corporations must still register to do business in SC.\n\nHow do I know if it’s a “South Carolina Spend?”\n\nA “South Carolina Supply” is an item or service typically subject to South Carolina sales tax and obtained by the production company from a South Carolina Supplier.\n\nA “South Carolina Supplier” is an entity, including but not limited to a limited liability company, a single member limited liability company, a corporation, an S corporation, a partnership or a sole proprietorship that:\n\nHas at least one full-time employee within the State;\n\nHas a physical location in the state that consists of more than a post office box or drop box and that maintains normal business and has a South Carolina telephone number;\n\nHas registered to pay South Carolina income taxes and withholding taxes, and if applicable, South Carolina sales tax;\n\nHas registered to do business with the South Carolina Secretary of State; and\n\nEvidences an intent to be permanently domiciled in this State.\n\nTo the extent that a purchase is made from someone other than a SC supplier, that expenditure will not be eligible for the Supplier Rebate.\n\nAre there other Federal tax incentives that may be valuable to film productions?\n\nYes, all US based productions continue to have other potential incentives including a 6% tax deduction from gross revenues for U.S. film and television production activities (Section 199). Producers should consult their professional tax advisers for other tax incentives that may be available."
