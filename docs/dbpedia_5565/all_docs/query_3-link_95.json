One is in the spring after the upcoming season is announced, and another is in the early fall when the new season is underway.\n\nActors only need to attend one of these general auditions. Callbacks for each show occur closer to when those specific shows begin rehearsals. After you audition, you will be notified if you are called back for specific shows.\n\nThough we are holding TWO general audition dates for your convenience, you only need to attend ONE:\n\nFirst General Audition: Saturday, April 6, 2024, from 1:15 pm to 8:00 pm.\n\nSecond General Audition: Saturday, August 10, 2024, from 10:00 am – 2:30 pm.\n\nYou only need to attend one of these general auditions to be considered for any/all shows in the season. We’re holding two generals because it gives everyone two different audition options based on your availability. No matter which audition date you attend, you will be considered for any/all shows in the season that have not yet had callbacks (dates will be published on the website)."
