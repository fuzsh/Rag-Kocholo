        "text": "Laurie Holden is best known to audiences as Andrea in the hit AMC drama series The Walking Dead. However, Laurie's big acting break came much earlier in her career, starring with Vanessa Redgrave in the critically acclaimed TNT mini-series Young Catherine. Since that auspicious beginning, she has appeared in several groundbreaking television series, including seminal roles on FOX's The X-Files, FX's The Shield, and currently FX's The Americans. Holden's big screen debut found her starring alongside Jim Carrey in Frank Darabont's The Majestic. The 1950's period piece earned Holden critical acclaim and a place on Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Most Creative People in Entertainment\" list and Variety's \"Ten Actors To Watch\" list. Laurie entered the comic book world when she co-starred opposite Michael Chiklis in Fox's Fantastic Four and then ventured into the gamer genre with her starring role as the iconic Cybil Bennett opposite Sean Bean in Christophe Gans' cult horror classic Silent Hill. She also starred with Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden in Stephen King's sci-fi thriller The Mist and in the Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber To with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. She will soon be seen in Adam MacDonald's Pyewacket with Nicole Munoz and will be voicing the role of \"Dakota\" in the animated feature Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad. In 2011, Holden received two Best Supporting Actress nominations for her work on The Walking Dead: one from Spike TV's Scream Awards and another from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films' Saturn Awards. She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Walking Dead in 2013. Earlier in her career, she also received a Best Actress nomination from the Genie Awards (Canada's equivalent to the Emmys) for her guest- starring role on the Canadian comedy hit Due South. In 2014, Holden executive produced her first motion picture: Rebecca Johnson's critically acclaimed film Honeytrap, which garnered a nomination at the London Film Festival, received U.S distribution through Ava DuVernay's film collective ARRAY, and can currently be streamed on Netflix. Laurie is also an Executive Producer on The Time of Their Lives (Bright Pictures/Daryl Prince Productions) starring Dame Joan Collins, Pauline Collins, Franco Nero and Joely Richardson. The film will be distributed by Universal in most world markets, starting with its 2017 cinema release in the UK on March 10th. Holden is also a human rights activist, and dedicates much of her time and effort to enriching and protecting the lives of women and children victimized by the sex trade. Through her philanthropic work with Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery, she volunteered in the field in Cartagena, Colombia with O.U.R. on a mission that helped liberate 55 young sex slaves and brought down notorious sex trafficker Marcus Bronschidle. The successful sting operation was featured on ABC's Nightline and is the subject of an upcoming documentary entitled The Abolitionists. Holden serves on the Board of Alamasi Collaborative Arts, a Zimbabwean dramatic arts collaborative. She also actively supports HomeFromHome, a South African non-profit NGO that provides shelter and education for orphans infected and afflicted by HIV.\n\nThis stunning and resourceful actress has been primarily a film player thus far. Only recently has she been opening herself up more to doing television (the series Gemini Division (2008), which she executive-produced), and animated voice-overs. Dawson's powerhouse talent stands out the most in edgy, urban filming that dates back to 1995 when she was only sixteen.\n\nA rags-to-riches article entitled \"Rosario Dawson: From Tenement to Tinseltown\" probably says it all. Rosario was born on May 9, 1979 in New York City. Her mother, Isabel Celeste, of Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban descent, is a singer, and her stepfather, who raised her, Greg Dawson, of Irish descent, is a construction laborer. Her parents, who married when both were teenagers, eventually divorced. Rosario and her younger brother, Clay Dawson, had it hard while growing up, and were cared for by family members, most of whom were poverty-stricken, and some of whom were HIV-positive.\n\nHer career actually started as a child when she made a minor showing on the children's show, Sesamstraße (1969). As the story goes, she was \"discovered\" as an adolescent on her front porch step by two photographers. One of them, Harmony Korine, was an aspiring screenwriter who thought the inexperienced sixteen-year-old was ideal for the controversial cult film Kids (1995), in which she would portray a sexually active adolescent. It took time for Rosario's film career to kick in after that, but by the late 1990s, she had nabbed several independent films. Since then, she has moved into main-stream hits (and misses) and has surprised viewers with her earthy, provocative, uninhibited approach to her roles.\n\nReflecting New York's tougher, tawdrier side as assorted streetwalkers, homeless mothers, drug addicts, etc., her film highlights have included Light It Up (1999), Edward Burns' Seitensprünge in New York (2001), Spike Lee's 25 Stunden (2002) and Shattered Glass (2003). For Oliver Stone, she portrayed the duped bride of Colin Farrell's famed B.C. Macedonian warrior, Alexander (2004) (as in \"...the Great\"), which featured a notoriously violent-tinged nude/sex scene.\n\nExpanding her horizons beyond film, she has always expressed interest in singing. She hooked up with Prince for the re-release of his 1980s hit \"1999\" and appeared in The Chemical Brothers' video for the song \"Out of Control\" from the album \"Surrender\". She is also featured on the Outkast track, \"She Lives in My Lap\". On stage, she co-starred as Julia in a revival of \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" at the Public Theater's \"Shakespeare in the Park\" and appeared in \"The Vagina Monologues\".\n\nShe lucked into and got to show off her singing chops in the film adaptation of the hit New York musical Rent (2005), when Daphne Rubin-Vega, the original Mimi, became pregnant and was unable to reprise her exotic dancer role. Rosario also appeared as a prostitute in the adaptation of the graphic novel Sin City (2005). Of late, she has turned to producing. One of those, Descent (2007), had her playing a college coed who is brutally attacked and raped by a fellow student. Her more popular ventures have thus far included the role of Valerie Brown in the live-action version of the comic strip Josie and the Pussycats (2001), the Will Smith starrer Men in Black 2 (2002), Eagle Eye - Außer Kontrolle (2008) with Shia LaBeouf and Sieben Leben (2008), again with Smith, in which she offered one of her more tender-hearted performances as a woman with a potentially fatal heart condition.\n\nMore recent millennium films opposite some of Hollywood's top leading movie men include the tense actioneer Unstoppable - Außer Kontrolle (2010) with Denzel Washington and Chris Pine; the comedy/fantasy Der Zoowärter (2011) opposite Dalekmania (1995); romantic dramedy 10 Jahre - Zauber eines Wiedersehens (2011) with Channing Tatum; crime drama Fire with Fire - Rache folgt eigenen Regeln (2012) with Bruce Willis; romantic comedy Top Five (2014) with Chris Rock; and action adventure Zombieland 2: Doppelt hält besser (2019) with Woody Harrelson. She has also top-lined independent films with her own feisty characters such as the thriller Unforgettable - Tödliche Liebe (2017) and the title role in the dramedy Krystal (2017).\n\nFocusing also on TV projects, Rosario has graced such action series/mini-series as Marvel's Daredevil (2015), Marvel's Iron Fist (2017) and Marvel's The Defenders (2017), as well as the comedy Jane the Virgin (2014) and animated cartoon series Jack, der Monsterschreck (2019).\n\nOff-camera, the still-single Dawson is highly active in political, social and environmental causes and has been involved with such organizations/charities/campaigns as the Lower East Side Girls Club, Global Cool, the O.N.E. Campaign, Oxfam, Amnesty International, Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, Control Arms, International Rescue Committee, Voto Latino (which she founded), Conservation International, Doctors Without Borders, National Geographic Society, The Nature Conservancy and Save the Children. In October 2008, she lent her voice to the RESPECT! Campaign, a movement aimed at preventing domestic violence.\n\nStephen Amell is a Canadian actor, known for portraying Oliver Queen / Green Arrow in the Arrowverse television franchise (based on the comic character of the same name) and Casey Jones in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016).\n\nStephen Adam Amell was born on May 8, 1981 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Sandra (Bolté) and Thomas Amell. His cousin is actor Robbie Amell. He is of English, Scottish, German, and one sixteenth French-Canadian, descent. Stephen decided to pursue a career in acting when he was in his teens. He appeared in two episodes of the fourth season of Queer as Folk as the Liberty Ride spinning instructor in 2004. Amell played Adam in the first season of the television series Dante's Cove; he was replaced in the second season by Jon Fleming. In 2007, Amell won a Gemini Award for his guest-starring role on ReGenesis. The same year he was also nominated for a Gemini Award in the Best Ensemble Cast Category for Rent-a-Goalie. He had recurring roles in the TV series Da Kink in My Hair and Heartland. On December 3, 2010, Amell joined the cast of The Vampire Diaries as werewolf 'Brady' for season 2. Amell starred as Joran Van Der Sloot in the Lifetime film Justice for Natalee Holloway which originally aired in May 2011.\n\nOn October 2, 2011, season 3 of HBO's series Hung premiered with Amell starring as busboy-turned-prostitute Jason, a younger rival \"ho\" to Thomas Jane's Ray Drecker. He also appeared as Jim in the fourth season of 90210. Amell announced on October 28, 2011 that he had just finished filming the Christmas episode of New Girl with Zooey Deschanel and Max Greenfield. He touches on the experience of filming his first \"network half hour comedy\" in an interview with Daemon's TV. On November 9, 2011, Amell was announced for the recurring role of Scottie, a paramedic on ABC's Private Practice. He also plays the role of Travis in Blue Mountain State In January 2012, Amell was cast as the title character in The CW series Arrow, a re-imagining of the comic-book character Green Arrow. On March 31, 2015, Amell joined the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows as vigilante Casey Jones, which will be released on June 3, 2016. As an avid professional wrestling fan, Amell had long campaigned for a guest appearance on WWE's weekly Raw program, when in late May 2015 it was reported that he was tentatively set to wrestle Stardust at WWE's SummerSlam pay-per-view on August 23, 2015. Amell made his first WWE appearance on the May 25 Raw, where he had a confrontation with Stardust. However, after the real-life death of Stardust's father Dusty Rhodes in June 2015, reports speculated that the match had been scrapped. Despite this, Amell stated at the 2015 Comic Con International in July 2015, \"I'm probably gonna do some stuff with the WWE. I don't know if that means a wrestling match. We'll see.\"\n\nAmell returned to Raw on August 10, continuing his story-line with Stardust when he stepped into the ring after being assaulted in the audience by Stardust, attacking the wrestler until being contained by security. Following a backstage segment with Triple H, it was announced that Neville would team with Amell to face Stardust and King Barrett at SummerSlam. At the event on August 23, Amell and Neville defeated Barrett and Stardust in a tag team match. Neville and Barrett started and after Neville used his speed to control the action, Barrett tagged in Stardust. Stardust insisted that Amell enter the ring, a challenge accepted in a way that both imitated and bettered Stardust's own athletic ring entrance. Stardust first pushed Amell to the canvas, Amell then responded with a kip-up and a stiff front thrust kick to Stardust's chest. For the next few minutes Amell was controlled by Stardust and Barrett, and absorbed punches, kicks, knees, slams, falls from ring to floor, and an attack on the floor by the non-legal man, Stardust. Upon returning to the ring, and hitting Stardust with an Enzuigiri, Amell made a hot tag to Neville, who dominated both opponents. The conclusion of the match came after Amell dove off the top corner ropes onto Stardust and Barrett who were standing on the floor below. The match ended after Neville hit his finisher, the Red Arrow, on Barrett and pinned him. Behind the scenes, wrestlers were said to have been impressed with Amell's performance. There were also talks of a potential singles match with Stardust. On December 21, Amell was awarded a Slammy for the \"Celebrity Moment of the Year\" for his dive onto Stardust.\n\nAmell has hosted a number of successful fund-raising campaigns via the crowd funded merchandise platform Represent.com. In 2014, Amell partnered with the charity Fuck Cancer to raise almost a million dollars with the release of a T-shirt featuring his face on the front (with a Post-it note on his forehead, and featuring the organization's name). He ended up selling over 60,000 shirts from this campaign. In January 2015, Amell launched his second Represent.com campaign featuring a word he made up, Sinceriously, to benefit two mental health charities: Paws and Stripes, and Stand For The Silent. In August 2015, Amell used his guest appearance on WWE Raw with Stardust to raise funds via his third campaign for children's hospice Emily's House in Toronto. The campaign raised $300,000, and Amell and Stardust presented a check together at Emily's House.\n\nAmell married actress and model 'Cassandra Jean' on December 25, 2012 in a private ceremony in the Caribbean, and for a second time in New Orleans on May 26, 2013. The couple have a daughter, Mavi, born in 2013. Growing up, Amell was a fan of various local sporting teams, such as the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Toronto Raptors and the Toronto Blue Jays. Amell is still very involved with the sports; he often jokes with fans telling them to skip Maple Leafs games and watch Arrow when the team faces a tough opponent, and recently, Amell campaigned to have Jays' third baseman Josh Donaldson elected to the 2015 all-star game.\n\nAmerican actor and producer Matthew David McConaughey was born in Uvalde, Texas. His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Irish, Scottish, German, English, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.\n\nHe began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Confusion - Sommer der Ausgeflippten (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Die Rückkehr (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger.\n\nShortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel Die Jury (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in Die Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998).\n\nIn 1999, he starred in the comedy EDtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.\n\nIn the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as Wedding Planner - verliebt, verlobt, verplant (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and Wie werde ich ihn los in 10 tagen (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Die Herrschaft des Feuers (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Zum Ausziehen verführt (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in Sie waren Helden (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Ein Schatz zum Verlieben (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Der Womanizer - Die Nacht der Ex-Freundinnen (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.\n\nThat change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in Der Mandant (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie - Leichen pflastern seinen Weg (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud - Kein Ausweg (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey's career certainly reached it's prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO's True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics' Choice Award for the role.\n\nAlso in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.\n\nGeorge Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (née Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.\n\nAfter his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979); Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988); and Detective James Falconer on Ein Strauß Töchter (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies.\n\nWhile filming \"ER\" (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), and Tage wie dieser... (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Clooney took on the role of Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997).

He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him \"the most powerful actor in Hollywood\". Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.\n\nSmith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes.

As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.\n\nSmith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer.

Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he \"wanted to rap.\" Smith says he was admitted to a \"pre-engineering [summer] program\" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, \"My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT.

The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.\n\nHe turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he \"made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.\"\n\nIn 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.\n\nHe has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.\n\nOn December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.

Concussion was directed by Peter Landesman and-bead filmed in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. It received $14.4 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania. Principal photography started on October 27, 2014. Actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw played his wife.
