        "text": "What is the SC New Play Festival?\n\nThe South Carolina New Play Festival curates a weekend of yet-to-be-produced plays and musicals by today’s hottest playwrights. Over a 4-day weekend, we’ll present readings of new plays, new musicals, new theatre for young audiences shows, an outdoor variety stage, and a closing night cabaret featuring Broadway star, and Greenville local, Phillip Boykin.\n\nReadings feature TONY-Nominees, Drama-Desk winners, and other well-known Broadway actors, as well as beloved performers from the local community, and are helmed by established and experienced directors with a national profile.\n\nThis is a destination event for theater lovers and a unique opportunity for Southeastern audiences to meet the artists and shape the future of American theater.\n\nAre all events family friendly?\n\nWe always schedule at least one show for Young Audiences at the South Carolina Children’s Theater, and we are pleased to announce this year’s presentation of “Stuntboy”, adapted from the best-selling graphic novel.\n\nThe outdoor variety stage is also family-friendly and will occur in Falls Park with rotating acts from 3pm-8pm on August 10 and 11. All other festival presentations should be considered PG-13."
