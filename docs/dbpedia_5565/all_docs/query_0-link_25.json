When the company reorganised for the war in April 1862, he was appointed third lieutenant. Promotion to first lieutenant followed on June 22. Despite his rank, Deaver was discharged on July 22 by reason of being underage, suggesting that his age was less than seventeen years he claimed when he enlisted in 1861. He reenlisted in the same company as a private on September 3, 1862, and on May 12, 1863, was again promoted to third lieutenant.\n\nIn January 1864 Deave was promoted to first lieutenant and transferred to Company G, 14th Battalion, N.C.

Deaver became a captain of Company G in April 1864 and also assumed command of Company A in September. In January 1865, with the addition of three independent companies, the 14th Battalion was redisignated the 7th Regiment N.C. Cavalry. The regiment spent the closing weeks of the war defending the Asheville area against Federal incursions. Followin ghte surrender of Joseph E. Johnston, it disbanded.
