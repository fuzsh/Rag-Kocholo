        "text": "Essential Question\n\nWhat important role did women have in the Battle of Cowpens?\n\nObjective\n\nThe student will be able to identify the varied roles of women in the American Revolution.\n\nThe student will be able to explain this role in the context of the position of women in colonial society.\n\nThe student will identify women associated with the battle of Cowpens in the context of documented activities of women in South Carolina and all of colonial America.\n\nBackground\n\nGOAL: To present to students the contribution of women to the Battle of Cowpens in context of women’s role in the Revolution in the Carolinas and colony-wide.\n\nWomen made important contributions to the American Revolution. Stories abound of heroines and others associated with the events of war. Many were camp followers following their husbands, sons, and fathers as they fought. They cooked, sewed, and nursed the wounded, served as messengers and spies, and sometimes fought in battle. Often we are aware of such persons as Molly Pitcher and Sybil Ludington (the female Paul Revere), but there were other lesser-known and sometimes unnamed women who are of equal importance. A number of women are known for their involvement in the Revolutionary War in South Carolina.\n\nMany stories of Revolutionary War heroines are blends of fact and fiction. Good researchers document their findings.\n\nOther than those heroines connected to battles, there were those women on the home-front who took on the sole obligations of managing home and family. It is interesting to note those roles taken by various Native-American, African-American, Patriot, and Loyalist women.\n\nPreparation\n\nReview Background Information and Procedure sections.\n\nProcedure\n\nPRE-SITE ACTIVITIES\n\nComplete the following activities using the list of heroines and other women associated with the Revolution below.\n\nMatch each woman with bibliographical information about her.\n\nUse a map of the 13 colonies (or present states) to pinpoint where each was from. Identify those from your state.\n\nAssume the role of one of these women and write a diary of actual or possible experiences in context of the Revolution and historical events surrounding her life.\n\nUse fabric and your imagination to make a banner or flag honoring one of these women.\n\nPresent a “This Was Your Life” program on one or more of these women. With each, a student can use or memorize a script to portray the historic woman. Another person can serve as an emcee or presenter; others, people, either real or fictitious, from this woman’s life.\n\nRead selections from the book, Founding Mothers and contrast and compare the role of African-American women, Native-American women, Loyalist women and Patriot women. Discuss women’s role in war.\n\nIDENTIFY SOME WOMEN OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\n1. ___Catherine Moore Barry\n\n2. ___Emily Geiger\n\n3. ___Anne Kennedy Hamilton\n\n4. ___Nancy Hart\n\n5. ___Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson\n\n6. ___Sybil Ludington\n\n7. ___Molly Hays McCauley\n\n8. ___Rebecca Motte\n\n9. ___Dicey Langston Springfield\n\n10. ___Nancy Ward\n\n11. ___Phillis Wheatley\n\nEighteen-year-old who rode through wild Carolina backcountry to deliver General Nathanael Greene’s message to General Thomas Sumter.\n\nMother of a future president, she traveled to Charles-ton and died as she attended to relatives on a British prison ship.\n\nFrontier Cherokee woman who warned settlers of impending attack.
