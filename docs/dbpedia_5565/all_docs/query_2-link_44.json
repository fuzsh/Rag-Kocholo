There are eight primary elements to wellness, and the Internal Medicine/Pediatrics Residency provides extraordinary support to each of its residents for every component.\n\nWhat is great about wellness, and also what makes it challenging, is every person has unique wellness needs. Each resident in the program is provided with:\n\nformal education on identifying gaps or deficits in overall well-being to allow for self-stewardship of wellness;\n\nresources to support building and repairing any identified or potential deficits;\n\ngroup practicums for commonly encountered challenges with wellness; and\n\nsupport from a wellness evaluation and improvement committee, comprising both residents and attending physicians, which meets to develop a multidisciplinary wellness curriculum.\n\nopt-out mental health sessions coordinated with the Office of Professional Mental Health to offer confidential check-in sessions with the option to continue services, if desired.

The council’s mission is to continually improve the inclusivity and equity with which the Penn State College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics provides healthcare, medical training, and advances medical science by:\n\nProviding pediatric patients and their families with excellent, compassionate, culturally responsive and equitable care.\n\nSupporting the department in recruiting, hiring and retaining a group of diverse faculty, trainees and staff, while equipping Department members to provide culturally responsive and equitable care.\n\nEnsuring that scholarly pursuits account for, evaluate and address potential social determinants of health beyond race and ethnicity, and that our research reflects a diverse and representative population.\n\nStriving to ensure our educational experiences foster and value equity, inclusivity, cultural competency and the needs of a diverse population.\n\nInstitutional Resources\n\nPenn State Health and Penn State College of Medicine celebrate, embrace and support the diversity of all patients, faculty, staff, students and trainees.\n\nOffice for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nIn keeping with this, Penn State Health has an active Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion with various programs, networks and resource groups, including:\n\nTalks and lectures on diversity, equity and inclusion through the Inclusion Academy\n\nRegular events on topics such as eradicating racism and creating a culture of inclusiveness\n\nMany Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs), including:\n\nDisability Business Employee Resource Group\n\nInterfaith Business Employee Resource Group\n\nLGBTQ+ Business Employee Resource Group\n\nMilitary and Veterans Business Employee Resource Group\n\nMulticultural Business Employee Resource Group\n\nNextGen Business Employee Resource Group\n\nBlack Physician Professional Staff Association – Resource Group\n\nHispanic Professional Association\n\nAsian Physician and Professional Staff Association\n\nInternational Workforce Inclusion\n\nLearn more about the Penn State Health Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nLearn more about the College of Medicine’s Office for Diversity, Equity and Belonging\n\nOffice for Culturally Responsive Health Care Education\n\nThe vision at Penn State College of Medicine and Penn State Health is to equip learners with the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to provide culturally excellent health care and research for an increasingly diverse U.S. population.

NURF’s goal is to promote cultural diversity in the residency programs through community involvement, mentorship with diverse faculty, professional networking and support for the recruitment of diverse medical students into the residency programs.\n\nNURF is sponsored by the Penn State College of Medicine Graduate Medical Education Office and the Penn State Health Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n\nLearn more information about NURF\n\nAnti-Bias Policy\n\nPenn State Health and Penn State College of Medicine celebrate, embrace and support the diversity of all patients, faculty, staff, students and trainees. Beginning in May 2017, Penn State Health’s Patient’s Rights and Responsibility Policy was updated to include a section stating that patients cannot decline the care of a provider based on the provider’s race, religion, gender, age or sexual orientation. Penn State Health became one of the first health care systems nationwide to establish an official anti-bias policy that protects providers when such cases arise.\n\nRESIDENT SPOTLIGHT\n\n“A highlight for me as a resident physician is the opportunity to work directly with Penn State College of Medicine’s local Student National Medical Association (SNMA) chapter. (SNMA is) an organization that was founded in 1964 at my alma mater, Howard University College of Medicine, as a subdivision of the National Medical Association (NMA), to support current and future underrepresented medical students, addressing the needs of underserved communities, and increasing the number of clinically excellent, culturally competent and socially conscious physicians.”\n\n– Monica Adedeji, MD\n\nResident\n\nStanding Med/Peds Weekly Conferences – Tuesdays at noon\n\nEach week, a member of the Med/Peds resident team presents a topic typically related to care in the outpatient setting. These conferences are an hour long and allow residents to polish their presentation skills and provide useful medical updates and clinical information. The Med/Peds faculty team members frequently attend and offer valuable information on how the topic relates to their respective specialty. Additionally, residents commit to an “academic half-day” on Thursdays, to dedicate a block of time to focus on core internal medicine and pediatric topics.\n\nMed/Peds Continuity Clinic\n\nThe continuity clinic, located in downtown Harrisburg, allows residents the opportunity to work closely with an underserved patient population. The clinic serves adults and children with varying medical and health-related needs, from “bread and butter” to complex chronic medical conditions, gender identity, HIV, social concerns and substance abuse. Residents work exclusively with Med/Peds faculty to see a variety of patients for both annual physical exam and acute visits. They serve as the primary care providers for these patients.\n\nThe continuity clinic is part of the Reach Out and Read Program that provides books for infants and children during well-child visits, as a way to encourage literacy. The clinic also provides access to a Penn State Health social worker to help patients with a wide array of social concerns that may impact their care and well-being. A substance abuse clinic is also available on-site to help reduce barriers to medical care for those with addictions.\n\nQuality Improvement Projects\n\nQuality improvement (QI) is an important aspect of the Medicine/Pediatrics residency, with residents often involved in medicine and pediatrics QI projects and as resident representatives on unit-based quality committees. A detailed QI curriculum provides resources, education and experiences to help each resident create their own project prior to graduation or participate in our Med/Peds QI projects in the clinic. There are also opportunities for more education in this area with Penn State College of Medicine’s Health Systems Science Academy.\n\nTransitional Care Curriculum\n\nThe Medicine/Pediatrics residents have created a transitional care program to educate adolescents and their parents on the process of transitioning medical care from pediatricians and pediatric specialty providers to adult providers and specialists. Residents help integrate the transitional care concepts into the pediatric specialty clinics and the well-child checkups in the pediatric clinics. The program has incorporated these concepts into the pediatric and internal medicine residency academic half-day curriculum to help teach these concepts to the categorical residents.\n\nSupportive Learning Environment with Professional Coaching\n\nThere are 23 Medicine/Pediatrics Residency faculty members, all of whom have been trained in both medicine and pediatrics, and are actively involved in various aspects of the residency. Each member of the faculty is approachable and willing to provide advice and guidance to the residents. In addition, each resident is assigned a physician coach for professional development advice and encouragement throughout the four years of residency. The program also encourages you to find several mentors to help you reach your career goals.\n\nEducational Resources\n\nTo support individual learning, residents are provided with memberships in the American College of Physicians (ACP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Med-Peds Residents’ Association (NMPRA), as well as $600 for books and educational expenses per year.\n\nThe AAP membership also provides access to Pedialink online learning center, Pediatrics and Peds in Review. The ACP membership includes a subscription to the Annals of Internal Medicine. In addition, subscriptions to the Yale Pediatric and Internal Medicine Outpatient Curriculum are provided.\n\nOngoing board review occurs throughout the four years of residency, with residents attending a board review course at the end of training.\n\nResidents as Educators\n\nThe Woodward Center for Excellence in Health Sciences Education is designed to cultivate excellence in health sciences education. Longitudinal didactics on multiple aspects of teaching, evaluation and feedback and goal-setting are offered. The Woodward Center provides programs such as Stanford Clinical Teaching Skills workshops and the Woodward Scholars program.\n\nThere are extra opportunities for education such as the Medical Education quarterly retreats, the Medical Education two-week elective, the Medical Education Track and many others. The program also offers a Health Systems Scholar position each year. You also have the opportunity to become an Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Scholar."
