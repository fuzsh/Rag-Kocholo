I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest is comic and actor Patton Oswalt. In 2002 Entertainment Weekly named\n\nhim their \"It\" comedian of the year, describing him as `one of stand-up's\n\nmost scathingly literate minds.' Oswalt has done comedy specials on Comedy\n\nCentral and HBO. He's a frequent guest on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" is\n\noften on VH1's \"Best Week Ever,\" and has appeared on Comedy Central's \"Crank\n\nYankers.\" On the CBS sitcom \"The King of Queens\" he plays Spence. He's\n\nwritten for Mad TV and has been hired to punch up screenplays. Now Patton\n\nOswalt has his first CD; it's called \"Feelin' Kinda Patton.\" Let's start with\n\na track from it called \"How We Won the War.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"How We Won the War\")\n\nMr. PATTON OSWALT (Comedian): I don't have any material about the war or\n\nanything like that, man. I really--I just don't have--'cause guess what,\n\nhippies? We (censored) won! Yeah! We went in there and we met our stated\n\nobjective to uh--hang on. We went in--here's--wait a minute--to go to\n\nliberate the--hang on. No. Here's why we went. Wait a minute. We went to\n\nget the uh--to strike a thing--uh--we (censored) won, OK?\n\n(Soundbite of cheering)\n\nMr. OSWALT: It's like our country is being run by a bunch of, like, bad\n\nalcoholic dads right now, or, you know, it's like, `You said you'd get me a\n\nbicycle for my birthday.' `It's a drawing of a bike. (Censored) go out and\n\nplay. Leave Daddy alone. Daddy's drinking. Go outside.' Drawing him a\n\nbike. Close enough.\n\nGROSS: Patton Oswalt, welcome to FRESH AIR. What kind of reactions do you\n\nget to your political material?\n\nMr. OSWALT: It's a real mixed reaction these days, and that was the main\n\nreason I put the CD out. You know, I'm on a sitcom, so a lot of people--I\n\neither get, you know, people that have seen my stand-up for the 16 years that\n\nI've done it and go, `Oh, yeah, he does political stuff, whatever,' or I get\n\npeople who have seen me on the sitcom or on TV and are expecting a very\n\nfamily-friendly kind of evening. And I either get, like, disappointment,\n\nwhich is always depressing, or kind of condescending outrage of like, `Hey,\n\nyou dumb sitcom actor,' you know, `you don't have an opinion on'--like, you\n\nknow what I mean?\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah, I feel like I'm--it's almost like I'm being viewed as a\n\ndilettante, I guess, whereas I've been doing this stuff for a long time. So,\n\nyou know, the reactions are always very mixed. I've gotten some very violent\n\nreactions, especially in, of all places, Pittsburgh, where I was booed off\n\nstage.\n\nGROSS: Really? What got you booed off stage?\n\nMr. OSWALT: The material about Bush. They just got really, really quiet\n\nduring that whole section. And then I went back into my other stuff, and then\n\nthere was a moment of silence. And a guy in the front row said, `Why don't\n\nyou take your faggot ass back to Hollywood?'--like really sharp, like the\n\nwhole room heard it. And then I kind of went, `Ha-ha, are you still angry\n\nabout the Bush stuff?' And the whole crowd just `A-a-a-a-a!'--just all\n\nstarted, like, screaming and pounding their tables. They were all--there was\n\n300 people at the Funny Bone in Pittsburgh pounding their tables and chanting\n\n`Bush rocks.' And I had to be led off stage by the club owner while people\n\nwere throwing drinks on me and throwing fried shrimp at me. And...\n\nGROSS: Wow.\n\nMr. OSWALT: ...I got locked up in the manager's office because--they had to\n\nlock me up in there because people, you know, wouldn't leave and fights were\n\nbreaking out, and people were down at the bar going, `Send him down here!'\n\nYou know, like, it was insane.\n\nGROSS: How--I mean, at what point does it reach that critical mass where you\n\nknow time to be led off stage?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah, I think that was the worst one. I think it was at the\n\npoint when they're all chanting and pounding, and I see people, like, standing\n\nup, and I'm like, `Ooh, this is not good.' Now at the same time I was opening\n\nfor Camper Van Beethoven in San Francisco in front of, I would say, a very\n\naggressively liberal crowd. And I tried to go into a bit about the kind of\n\nwarped part of my brain that wants to vote for George Bush. And, clearly,\n\nit's not a pro-Bush bit, but I start off that way. And then I go to an ironic\n\nend. But the minute they heard, `There's a part of me that wants to vote for\n\nGeorge Bush,' they booed me off stage. So I've gotten these extreme kind of\n\nclose-minded reactions from both sides at this point out there.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, and it's interesting that, you know, like, even in comedy clubs,\n\nthe culture wars are happening. Now--so where do you put your political\n\nmaterial in the context of the set? Do you lead with it and then risk getting\n\nbooed off stage before you've even gotten started?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Well, you know...\n\nGROSS: Do you put it in the middle where you can kind of sneak it in or...\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah. I never lead with it. I remember a long time ago when I\n\nwas starting out and I was just such a--you know, `I want to be edgy da-bi,\n\nda-bi.' And I would just come right out of the gate trying to freak people\n\nout. And I was working with, of all people, Bill Hicks in North Carolina, and\n\nhe said, `You need to walk them towards the edge. Do you--you've got to walk\n\nthem towards the edge, man.' So I've always remembered that.\n\nSo, you know, I just do jokes that have nothing to do with politics, and then\n\nI do jokes that are very personal and then jokes that have to do with\n\npolitics. And I think I've learned now how to mix it in a little better and,\n\nyou know, get them to at least trust you and go, `Oh, OK, he's funny. You\n\nknow, he knows what he's doing as a comedian,' and then start edging in. And,\n\nI mean, I think now I make fun of both sides equally. But the minute you make\n\nfun of one person's side, they just--you know, arms folded across the chest\n\nand superangry.\n\nGROSS: You've said that you sometimes sit at the bar after one of your shows\n\nand talk to people there. And I was surprised to read that for a couple of\n\nreasons. First of all, some performers really like to maintain this kind of\n\nperformer image, which means not, you know...\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...being elevated from the crowd, being on stage, being in the\n\nspotlight but not being at the bar. And, second of all, some people don't\n\nreally want to hear that kind of direct feedback after they've done a\n\nperformance because you have, like, a hundred critics who want to dissect your\n\nact.\n\nMr. OSWALT: That is true. No, no, that's true. But at the same time--yeah,\n\nI used to be very, like, kind of stiff-arm; I used to stiff-arm the audience a\n\nlot. But I guess in these last few years in trying to get into, like--you\n\nknow, now that I'm writing films and hoping to make them in a few years and\n\nalso acting in films, everything that ever used to intimidate me about any\n\nkind of art form was because it had this mystification level to it. And I'm\n\nout to just demystify what it is I do, so that other people will also go, `Oh,\n\nI can try it too,' like, and get more voices out there. So I don't mind--and\n\nnot that I think of myself as some kind of rock 'n' roll god or some, you\n\nknow, artist in an ivory tower or something. But when you are standing up on\n\na stage with a light on you and a microphone, you know, there is this kind of\n\ndistance, and I sort of what to get rid of that. I want to just demystify\n\neverything about what show business is, so that, you know, more people will do\n\nit.\n\nGROSS: Could I get...\n\nMr. OSWALT: And, also, I mean, sitting at the bar you--when people argue with\n\nyou and don't agree with you, you get other viewpoints and more ammunition to\n\nmake your bits and arguments even stronger later, if you're sitting there\n\ntalking to someone that doesn't agree with you.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Patton Oswalt. He's a comic, a writer and he is a co-star\n\non \"King of Queens.\" And now he has a new CD, which is called \"Feelin' Kinda\n\nPatton.\"\n\nLet's hear another track from your CD, and this is a track called \"The World's\n\nMost Amazing Father.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"The World's Most Amazing Father\")\n\nMr. OSWALT: If I ever have a kid, I'm going to be a (censored) amazing\n\nfather. I will rule as a father, and here's why. Because I'm going to be the\n\nmost boring, hateful father on the planet. I'm going to do what fathers\n\nshould do--parents should do. When I grew up in Virginia, all my friends\n\neither had these boring, square, like government-employee parents, like my\n\nparents, who I at the time hated, or they had these (censored) hippie parents.\n\nThey're all--they, like, you know, skorted out a couple--like they're at a\n\n(censored) music festival and, `Oh, there's a kid on our blanket. Hey, man,\n\nwhat the (censored) happened?' and then moved to the suburbs and settled down\n\nand then raised our kids. And all my friends had (censored) hippie parents.\n\nAnd it drove me crazy because their parents, like, let them get high. Their\n\nparents would get high with them and take them to concerts and let them watch\n\nX-rated movies on HBO. And my parents were like, `It's 9:00, sucker. You got\n\nsoccer practice tomorrow.' `(Censored) you, Dad!' I could not wait to get\n\nthe (censored) away and move to California and travel the world, and indeed I\n\ndid out of hatred for my parents.\n\nAll my friends who had hippie parents, you know what they did when they got\n\nout of high school? Got married, had kids, settled down, moved to the suburbs\n\nand ruined everything: put stickers on albums, took toys off the markets\n\nbecause some dumb-ass kid choked on a plastic missile--because secretly they\n\nhated their parents. They hated them because their parents were fun, but they\n\nwere also kind of scary. They were like, `Hey, I signed us up for belly\n\ndancing lessons, and I had to sell your beds because I forgot to pay the\n\n(censored) rent, man. I don't know what's going on. Oh, man, it's so\n\n(censored) heavy.' So to rebel against their parents, they (censored) ruined\n\neverything.\n\nSo here's my advice. If you ever have kids, do your duty for the future and\n\nbe boring, square parents. (Censored) all this coolness right now that you're\n\ninvolved in? Hide it. Don't let their kids know about it. Don't let your\n\nkids know about it. You took like eight hits of like Ecstasy and (censored)\n\npunched out a cop and, you know, (censored) someone from the Dandy Warhols.\n\nDon't tell them any of that (censored). All right? When I have kids, the\n\nmost recent CD that I will own: Phil Collins, \"No Jacket Required.\" That'll\n\nbe the most recent CD I own. Oh, my God.\n\nGROSS: That's Patton Oswalt from his new CD.\n\nSo how do you get along with your parents now?\n\nMr. OSWALT: I'm sorry. I'm just basking in how brilliant I am. Oh,\n\ngoodness.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: Oh, my God, that was fantastic. I gotta buy that album. My\n\nparents and I get along a lot better now, and it's probably because of that\n\nbit and all the realization that led to me writing that bit because, looking\n\nback on when I was growing up, I wasn't like a bad kid, but I was the classic,\n\novereducated, rebellious teen-ager but rebellious within just disagreeing with\n\nstuff for no reason. So I was the kind of kid when my parents would go,\n\n`Well, it's raining outside, son.' I'm like, `What do you mean? Just because\n\nthere's water coming out of the sky doesn't mean it's raining, man.' You\n\nknow, just--I was like the safest, plushiest suburban punk. You know what I\n\nmean? Like, I had never felt any real doubt or pain or anything like that,\n\nbut I wanted--and it was so sad, too, because I realize now I was like the--I\n\nmissed the whole--all the great movements of music I missed.\n\nLike, all during the late '70s I was just listening to, you know, Kansas and\n\nStyx. And then in the mid-'80s I saw the movie \"Repo Man\" and thought I had\n\ndiscovered punk. And I was the classic, like, unhip letting-you-in-on-it kid.\n\nSo, like, it's 1985 and I'm in Sterling, Virginia, going, `Hey, man, have you\n\nheard of a group called Fear? 'Cause you got'--and they're like, `Yeah,\n\nwe--that--yes, five years ago, Patton. What are you babbling about?' Like,\n\nyou know, I could not have--I missed the whole--I was living outside of DC and\n\nI never saw Fugazi, for crying out loud. I went and saw Genesis on the\n\nInvisible Touch Tour, so I had no basis for my rebellion.\n\nGROSS: Your father was a Marine. So was he even more into discipline when\n\nyou were into being rebellious?\n\nMr. OSWALT: My dad actually, I feel like, was rebelling against his\n\nupbringing in that I think he had a pretty strict upbringing, and he was\n\ngoing, `Well, I don't want to put that on my kids.' I do remember one night\n\nhe told me, `I don't want to ever see you and your brother go to war.' So I\n\nthink he was the kind of warrior that had, you know--which, unfortunately, we\n\ndon't have in power right now--who had seen, you know, three years of combat\n\nand realized how, I think, pointless and brutal and impersonal it was and, you\n\nknow, was very much a man of peace because of it. Even though, you know, he\n\nwas still every much--he and my mom are very conservative people, and yet\n\nthey're embarrassed by--they're not like just, you know, cold ideologues. So\n\nas far as discipline, you know, my dad had a much more kind of passive way of\n\ngoing about it. He was smart enough to let me alone, to just read and\n\ndaydream and, you know, come up with my own thing rather...\n\nGROSS: Were you named for General Patton?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Was named for General Patton. And you know what? Parents, don't\n\nput that on your kids. Don't name your kids after world-changing conquerors\n\n'cause there's no way they're going to live up to it. You know what I mean?\n\n`This is my son Alexander MacArthur Tecumseh,' you know, `Rommel. That's him.\n\nAnd he's ready to take your order at the Starbucks.' Like that's--don't do\n\nthat to them. It's horrible.\n\nGROSS: So now when you were a kid and you were being funny, was that\n\nconsidered in your family a discipline problem?\n\nMr. OSWALT: It depend--I mean, I could be funny, and they would appreciate\n\nit, and then other times I was just a loud mouth and I would just embarrass\n\nthem. Or I'd get into arguments with my grandfathers, who were both very\n\nconservative, and just ruin family dinners. And it was always a drag. I\n\nwas--again, I look back on some of my behavior and go, `Oh, man, if I'--I'm\n\namazed my dad just didn't hit me with a pipe 'cause I would--if I could go\n\nback now and see myself with my Dad, I would tell my Dad to hit me with a\n\npipe.\n\nGROSS: Did your father want you to be more macho?\n\nMr. OSWALT: I think when I was young he sort of wanted to, and then he just\n\nsort of said, `You know, it ain't happening with this kid.' But he could\n\ntell--I was reading poetry. I'd read like all of Edgar Allen Poe by the time\n\nI was nine and, you know, was drawing cartoons, and I was just such a sissy.\n\nGROSS: My guest is comedian Patton Oswalt. He has a new CD called \"Feelin'\n\nKinda Patton.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is comedian Patton Oswalt. He has a new CD called \"Feelin'\n\nKinda Patton.\"\n\nWhat was your early comedy like, when you first got up on stage?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Just really superforgettable because I came along--I started\n\ncomedy in '88. It was a really good and bad time to start. It was good\n\nbecause the boom was dying, but it was bad--and I'm seeing this happen again\n\nwith \"Last Comic Standing\"--where there were these certain things that\n\neveryone knew you had to do as a comedian. And there was this mentality of\n\n`You've got one shot. You've got one shot. You spend your time now getting\n\nready for that one shot, and if you blow it, you're done.' And it was also\n\nall about you get into comedies, so that you can get out of comedy, so that\n\nyou can get a sitcom or get into movies and not have to do this anymore,\n\nwhereas I was very confused because I thought doing comedy was great, like I\n\nthought that was the reward.\n\nI mean, when I became an emcee and was making 25 bucks a set, you know, I\n\nwasn't rich. But if I did four weekends a month, I could pay my rent and buy\n\nenough Ramen noodles to survive. And I thought that was amazing. Like, I\n\ncouldn't believe that I only had to work three nights a week, and everyone\n\nelse was--back then you had to get your clean five minutes and get on \"The\n\nTonight Show\" with Johnny Carson and hope that he called you over to the\n\ncouch. And that was it. And everyone structured their stuff to be a clean\n\nfive minutes.\n\nAnd I was constantly being pushed and pulled between, you know, trying to be a\n\nnormal-looking comedian in a suit. I remember I went down to the Potomac\n\nMills mall and bought these awful, awful double-breasted, cheap suits, like\n\nfour of them, like an orange one and a yellow one and a blue one and a black\n\none...\n\nGROSS: Blah.\n\nMr. OSWALT: ...with a bunch of colorful shirts and skinny ties. Like,\n\nthat's what I was going to do. Here's my--it was awful. But then I was\n\nalso--luckily, I had friends like Blaine Capatch and Mark Voyce, who were\n\ncomedians back then who just were not paying attention to any of that and were\n\nkind of the freaks. But I got along with them better because they would\n\nreference books that I read and music that I was listening to at the time, but\n\nthat was kind of how the alternative comedy movement was starting in its own\n\nway, so that when we all moved to San Francisco and then, later, LA, it was\n\njust the people that--because then once Johnny Carson left \"The Tonight Show,\"\n\nthese guys' plans were in ruins...\n\nGROSS: So...\n\nMr. OSWALT: ...because there was nothing to do.\n\nGROSS: ...what was the first thing you did on stage that really killed?\n\nMr. OSWALT: The first thing I ever did on stage--you know, the first thing I\n\never did on stage, the very first set I did, which was awful--I mean, I got no\n\nlaughs, but I did one bit that made both Blaine and Mark laugh. And because\n\nthose are the only two guys that made me laugh at this open mic, it made\n\nme--it helped to skew me in the right direction. It was just a thing where I\n\nsaid that the word `of' should be changed O with an apostrophe because then it\n\nwould make things a little more festive. Like, you wouldn't come home and go,\n\nyou know, `Honey, I have cancer O' the cervix.' Oh, that doesn't sound--you\n\nknow, that sounds kind of festive, you know.\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: Like, that kind of got a laugh. I remember just hearing Mark and\n\nBlaine laughing, and the rest of the crowd was just staring at me literally at\n\n2:30 in the morning at a club called Garvin's, which is now not there anymore.\n\nSo that was--but early on, you know, I wish--there's no eureka moment for\n\ncomedians. In movies they always, like, show--like, if you watch \"Punchline,\"\n\nSally Field is not funny, and then she breaks through one night. And that\n\njust--it doesn't happen that way. It just happens--you don't even realize\n\nit's happening.\n\nGROSS: Now you've said, `You can't argue comedy with anyone.'\n\nMr. OSWALT: No.\n\nGROSS: `Comedy and eroticism are beyond argument and qualification. If\n\nsomething makes people laugh or arouses them, then the argument is over.'\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Do you ever feel like arguing with an audience and explaining, `No,\n\nit's funny. Let me explain why'?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: `Laugh. It's funny.'\n\nMr. OSWALT: I know exactly what you're saying. Yeah, it is hard to--it's\n\nhard on both sides. Yeah, you want to argue your point, like, `Don't\n\nyou'--you know, like the people that were booing me off stage in San\n\nFrancisco. I literally said, `Do you really think that after the half-hour\n\nset you've just seen,' where I compared Bush to Lex Luthor and said that he's\n\nliterally the Antichrist--I literally said that--`do you now think that I'm\n\nactually pro-Bush? Like, you must know that I'm being ironic right now.' I\n\nfelt like a college professor, like, you know, begging a class not to walk out\n\non me, and they still booed me off stage. And, also, at the same time you get\n\nfrustrated because you see people laughing at something that's so easy and so\n\npandering and hackneyed. But you don't want to be the one going, `Don't you\n\npeople see how empty and unnutritious this is?' because then you feel like a\n\nslob. Like, it's so frustrating both ways.\n\nGROSS: I think it would be great if, at the end of your act, you left and\n\nthen you came back on the stage; instead of doing an encore, you critiqued the\n\naudience.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: That would be...\n\nGROSS: That would be fun.\n\nMr. OSWALT: `All right. Let's review. Now you did not--you laughed hard at\n\nthis bit and yet were silent for the one after. But that doesn't make sense\n\nbecause it would follow that if you saw the irony in this, you would\n\nnaturally'--like, really come on with a blackboard.\n\nGROSS: Well, you...\n\nMr. OSWALT: `Those who want to stay and take notes, yes, fine.'\n\nGROSS: Patton Oswalt. He has a new CD called \"Feelin' Kinda Patton.\" He'll\n\nbe back in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH\n\nAIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Announcements)\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Coming up: TiVo, Alvin & The Chipmunks and punching up screenplays.\n\nMore with comedian Patton Oswalt. He has a new comedy CD.\n\nAnd classical music critic Lloyd Schwartz reviews Judy Garland movie musicals\n\nnow out on DVD.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with comedian Patton Oswalt.\n\nHe has a new CD called \"Feelin' Kinda Patton.\" He's been a frequent guest on\n\n\"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" has appeared on Comedy Central's \"Crank\n\nYankers\" and VH1's \"Best Week Ever.\" He co-stars on the CBS sitcom \"The King\n\nof Queens,\" has written for \"Mad TV\" and is now writing a screenplay.\n\nI want to play another track from your new CD. And this is something totally\n\napolitical. It's called \"My Christmas Memory.\"\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\n(Soundbite of \"My Christmas Memory\")\n\nMr. OSWALT: When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the\n\nAlvin & The Chipmunks album because we had it on LP. And you know what I'm\n\ntalking about? The, you know, (singing mimicking Alvin & The Chipmunks)\n\n`Christmas, Christmas time is here.' Remember that song?\n\nAudience: (In unison) Yeah.\n\nMr. OSWALT: The little chipmunks are singing, and then there's that guy,\n\nDave, going, `All right, now, Chipmunks, let's all,' ber, ber, ber. My\n\nbrother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is we would play that on\n\nthe slowest speed possible on the record player. So then it sounded like four\n\nnormal, monotone guys just singing this boring Christmas song and then this\n\ndemon from, like, the nth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at\n\nthem. And then it just was so different. It was like, (singing) `Christmas,\n\nChristmastime is here, time for toys and time for cheer.'\n\n(Soundbite of growling)\n\nMr. OSWALT: Simon (growls).\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: OK. `We adore you, little ...(unintelligible).' OK. `Alvin\n\n(growls).\n\nGROSS: That's from Patton Oswalt's new CD.\n\nAnd, you know, I grew up listening to Alvin & The Chipmunks, and my brother\n\nand I used to slow it down. And I don't...\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: I think this is just, like, really funny. Can you talk a little bit\n\nabout how you decided to make this just, like, childhood memory into something\n\nto do on stage?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah, that's a bit I really like because I feel like I'm kind of\n\nunveiling an actuality because the way people react to that, it's something\n\nthat I think a lot of people did do and didn't realize how funny it was, like\n\nit's...\n\nGROSS: Exactly, yeah.\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah. Nothing's funnier than when you're just doing something\n\nthat you're not intending it to be funny or weird or memorable. It's just\n\nsomething you compulsively want to do out of fun. And so I just--it wasn't\n\nlike I decided to make it a bit. I think that was another one of--because I\n\ndon't sit and write. I just go up with some general ideas, but all of my bits\n\nusually get written when I'm on stage. And I think I was doing a show near\n\nChristmas, and I was doing a couple other bits about Christmas, and then that\n\nmemory on stage just popped into my head because I think that's when I really\n\nstarted getting good or at least happier with what I was doing--was when I was\n\ncomfortable enough on stage to just start talking about something and trust\n\nthat it would go somewhere, you know? And sometimes it doesn't, but when it\n\ndoes, like the Chipmunks bit, it's like, oh, I get a really good, solid, real\n\nbit out of it.\n\nGROSS: Now how did you end up playing `the neighbor' on \"King of Queens\"?\n\nMr. OSWALT: The producers saw my HBO half-hour, which I did in '97, and then\n\nbrought me in to read for the role. And I got it, and then it just kind of\n\ntook off from there. The writers on \"The King of Queens\" are so good, and\n\nthey really just started going to town with my character. And I was very\n\nlucky, you know, that they just kind of imbued him with a lot of personality.\n\nAnd there's a lot of like--a lot of the suppressed anger that the writers\n\nhave, I think they put through in my character. There's just a lot of rage in\n\nhis failure. And I think that they--you know, I'm kind of like the vessel for\n\nthat.\n\nGROSS: Let's hear a clip from \"King of Queens.\" And...\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...this is a scene in which you're talking about just getting TiVo.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The King of Queens\")\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) Oh, hey, hey, hey, do you want to see my new\n\npurchase?\n\nUnidentified Woman: Oh, your Spider-Man suit? You modeled it for me last\n\nweek.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's my TiVo. See,\n\nit's this thing that records TV shows, but the cool part is it's intuitive.\n\nSee, once you program in some shows you like, it gets to know your tastes and\n\nthen automatically picks out `record shows' for you.\n\nUnidentified Woman: Wow. See ya.\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) No, no, no.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) Wait. Come here, come here, come here. Just sit.\n\n(Soundbite of patting)\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) Now the other day I programmed in \"Sex and the City,\"\n\n\"Six Feet Under,\" a few other favorites and now--Presto--a whole list of\n\nshows TiVo recorded just for me.\n\nUnidentified Woman: Oh. \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) Never heard of it, but TiVo knows I'll like it.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nUnidentified Woman: \"Judy Garland Live at Carnegie Hall.\"\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) Oh, OK. I...\n\nUnidentified Woman: \"Decorating With Style.\"\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) I don't know why it would...\n\nUnidentified Woman: \"Queer as Folk.\"\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: (As Spence) Oh, my God, TiVo thinks I'm gay!\n\nGROSS: That's Patton Oswalt in a scene from \"King of Queens.\"\n\nNow you talk about TiVo on the CD, though it's different. Did you write the\n\nTiVo part in \"King of Queens\" that we just heard?\n\nMr. OSWALT: No, that was, again, another--it's weird. When I first started\n\ndoing that TiVo bit, when TiVo first started coming out, it never got huge\n\nlaughs because not a lot of people had a TiVo. But the few people in the\n\naudience that had TiVo reacted so strongly to it, like--you know, again, it\n\nwas another one of these--I wasn't really saying it to be overly funny. It\n\nwas just something that I noticed about my TiVo and then--because it's just\n\nthis weird, new technology. I'm like, `I don't know if this is going to catch\n\non. What is'--you know what I mean? It's like me doing a bit about a\n\ntamagucci pad(ph) or something. But then it just became the norm. And I\n\nremember when I first did that bit on \"Conan O'Brien,\" Conan came over, it's\n\nlike, `I go through the same thing. It's like the TiVo takes on this weird\n\npersonality, and you feel like it's making judgments about your life,' like we\n\nreally had a--and so I realized it was like a thing that was catching on.\n\nAnd then, totally not connected to my bit, that happened to the producer of\n\nthe show, where he was like, `I think my TiVo thinks I'm gay,' because it kept\n\nrecording all these gay programs. So, again, they wrote it in for the Spence\n\ncharacter. And then I told them--it was like, you know, `I do a bit about\n\nTiVo and having problems with it.' I'm like, `Well, that's cool.' So it was\n\njust a weird parallel.\n\nGROSS: Now you've started writing screenplays and TV pilots?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah, I co-wrote a movie a few years ago that was bought by\n\nMiramax and went in a turnaround. And then I had a blind-script deal at\n\nParamount, where--I don't really know what's--that is also in limbo. And then\n\nI sold another movie to New Line, which they are sitting on for some reason.\n\nI don't know why. It's one of those classic, `This is great! We've got to\n\nstart shooting this!' And you're like, `Awesome!' Then they go, `We'll talk\n\nto you in a few months.' And then you never heard from them again. Like, you\n\nknow, you're paid. You know, they've given you this giant paycheck, and\n\nyou're going, `Shouldn't you maybe make this if'--you know, you feel bad just\n\ntaking the money.\n\nGROSS: So none of the things you've written have actually gotten made yet.\n\nMr. OSWALT: No, not yet. They always want to rewrite it or give it to\n\nanother writer. And Merrill Marco said something really funny to me one time.\n\nWe were talking about--because she goes through this, too, where, you know,\n\nyou always write a first draft. They never use it; they always pay someone\n\nelse to write it or rewrite it. Or she--like, I also rewrite a lot of movies,\n\nso they're always giving me someone's first draft to rewrite. And Merrill\n\nMarco goes, you know, `They should just let homeless people write the first\n\ndraft of screenplays because they don't use them anyway.'\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: `You know, that could give them some money.' And it kind of made\n\na bizarre sort of sense...\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: ...because I can't think of any first draft that's ever just been\n\nshot, you know? And there's plenty of first drafts I've read, like Joss\n\nWhedon's original script for \"Alien: Resurrection\" was maybe one of the best\n\nthings I've ever read. I'm like, `All you have to do is shoot this.' And, of\n\ncourse, they rewrote it and tweaked and made sure it was a horrible movie.\n\nGROSS: Can you mention any of the screenplays that you had to rewrite?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah, I've done a lot of table sessions on movies \"Meet the\n\nFockers,\" which is coming out. I've done, like, punch-up in scenes on \"Blade\n\nIII,\"(ph) although that script was pretty--that was kind of a hard script to\n\ndo any punch-up on because it was so good. When I read it, I was like, `Why\n\nare they punching this up?' But the guy that wrote it was like, `I just want a\n\ncouple little jokes here and there, like some dark humor.' So, you know...\n\nGROSS: So what's the process like when you're doing punch-up on a script?\n\nMr. OSWALT: Well, there's three different processes. One is where they just\n\ngive you the script alone. I rewrote a movie, God, years ago that apparently\n\nhas been in the hands of eight other writers, too, called \"The Hardy Men,\"\n\nwhich is \"The Hardy Boys\" grown up. And it was originally like a Ben\n\nStiller-Owen Wilson vehicle. Now, you know, who knows who they'll give it to?\n\nSo you can do that by yourself, or there's one where they give you a script,\n\nand you--they just go, `Would you go through and point out, like, you know, 10\n\nor 15 scenes that you think could use, you know, a little punch-up or can we\n\ncut?' And so you submit that, or you do what's called a roundtable, where you\n\nand a bunch of writers sit around a table with the script, and you go through\n\nit scene by scene and punch it up. Or I also do a lot of work with the\n\nFarrelly Brothers, and that's me and a bunch of writers, and we take just a\n\nweek on a script. And we go out to, like, this beach house and just sit and\n\ngo over every scene and, you know, talk it out and, you know, punch it up, and\n\nthat's really fun.\n\nThose guys really have--as far as, like, how to structure jokes and something\n\nlike that, they've got really, really sharp instincts. But that just shows\n\nyou that even guys who are as sharp as them, the studio can still mess with\n\nyour product.\n\nGROSS: My guest is comedian Patton Oswalt. He has a new CD called \"Feelin'\n\nKinda Patton.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is comedian Patton Oswalt. He has a new CD called \"Feelin'\n\nKinda Patton.\"\n\nWhen you were growing up, who were the comedians that made you want to be a\n\ncomic, too?\n\nMr. OSWALT: When I was really, really young: Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby's\n\nearly albums were like--\"Why Is There Air?\" I think is one of the best comedy\n\nalbums I ever heard. And then there was a Richard Pryor album called \"Are You\n\nSerious?\" which was this--it's the album that covers his transition from being\n\nthis kind of Las Vegas, Bill Cosby, clean-cut clone to then being the really,\n\nyou know, raucous kind of comedian that he became. But it's called \"Are You\n\nSerious?\" And he's sort of making the transition, like he's got one foot in\n\nthe, you know, \"Richard Pryor: Live in Concert\" thing, and he's got his\n\nother foot still in Bill Cosby world. And it's so raw and real. And it was\n\nso captivating to listen to a guy that was just that comfortable in being able\n\nto put a clanky transitional thing out as an album and be that real and in the\n\nmoment on stage.\n\nAnd then much later, when I was starting, Jay Leno I thought was one of the\n\ngreatest comedians I've ever seen live, which is why I think a lot of\n\ncomedians are so frustrated with him because we don't know what happened to\n\nhim. He was unbelievable as a live comedian: smart and sharp and, really,\n\nkind of irreverent and just didn't seem to care if the audience liked him or\n\nnot but, like, just a rock star. And then he got \"The Tonight Show,\" and all\n\nof those qualities--it's like he sat on them. I don't get it. And then when\n\nhe's a guest on other people's shows, he's the old Jay, like supersmart,\n\nsuperquick, superfunny. I mean, he just did \"Inside the Actors Studio\" and\n\nso subversively mocked every single thing that James Lipton was trying to do\n\nwith him. I was like, `What happened to this guy? That's the--ohh!' You\n\nknow? It's just so frustrating.\n\nGROSS: Well, you know, two of the comics who you mentioned who were really\n\ninfluential on you, Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor, are African-American comics\n\nwho used, you know, their upbringing as the subject of their comedy.\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Did you feel that your upbringing would be worthy of that?\n\nMr. OSWALT: No.\n\nGROSS: You know, that your suburban upbringing would have the same kind of\n\nedge?\n\nMr. OSWALT: No, absolutely not. That's why I was so desperately, in my\n\nteens, flailing to be dangerous, you know, like--oh, man, I remember after I\n\nsaw \"Repo Man\"--again, \"Repo Man,\" that's how out of touch I was. It took\n\ntill \"Repo Man\" for me to get--I bought, like, a cheap pair of handcuffs, and\n\nI would clip them onto my belt loops, like, `I got handcuffs on my belt. Look\n\nout!' You know?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. OSWALT: Could not have been a less-dangerous kid if I tried. Like, I'd\n\nroll one sleeve up and, like, wear my boots but not tie the laces up because,\n\nalso, I thought, like, the idea of a rebel was like Judd Nelson in \"Breakfast\n\nClub.\"\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: That's how out of touch I was, just absolutely no edge, nothing.\n\nSo, yeah, these guys--like, the thing that also blew me away about, like, Bill\n\nCosby and Richard Pryor was it wasn't that they were comedians talking about\n\n`the black experience.' They just were amazing comedians who happened to be\n\nblack. And they would talk about stuff in a way that would just be universal\n\nto--a martian could come down and watch Richard Pryor's contra(ph) movies and\n\ngo, `Oh, that's what relations are like between men, women, black, white.' You\n\nknow, like they--anyone can understand it. It's so amazing how--everyone\n\ntalks about how Richard Pryor was edgy and vulgar and profane. But I think he\n\nwas one of the most emotionally assessable comedians I've ever seen.\n\nGROSS: On your CD in the liner notes, you give a lot of, you know,\n\nacknowledgements and thank yous.\n\nMr. OSWALT: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And one of the people you thank is your cool professor in college, who\n\nwas your fencing teacher (laughs).\n\nMr. OSWALT: Mm. Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: You took fencing?\n\nMr. OSWALT: I took fencing because I was also--(clears throat) excuse me. As\n\nmuch as I wanted to be a kind of a punk outlaw growing up, I was very much\n\ninto Dungeons and Dragons. And it just could not--just, again, a clueless\n\nnerd. So when I got to college, I think that was the last tendril that\n\nwas--still had its grip around my throat. I'm like, `I'll learn to fight with\n\nswords.'\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: And I took one year of that, and it was like, `Oh, this requires\n\neffort. Bye.'\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: You know, back to my Sega Genesis, which sad because I've come\n\nfull circle because now and a bunch of comedians have a regular Dungeons and\n\nDragons game. It's sad.\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: `You play D&D?' Yes. I can't believe I'm saying this\n\nnationally. So pathetic.\n\nGROSS: Your career's over (laughs).\n\nMr. OSWALT: That's it. I'm done. I'm playing D&D now in the suburbs. I'm\n\nnot dangerous. Folks, not dangerous. Don't come to me for danger.\n\nGROSS: If there was a sitcom, you now, that was called, you know, \"Patton\n\nOswalt,\" what would your character be?\n\nMr. OSWALT: God. I would love to play--like, I would love to amplify all the\n\nbad qualities about myself and just play that, so I could get, like, you know,\n\nthe competitiveness and the pettiness and a lot of the--as much as I try to\n\nbe--you know, as a comedian, you know, I try to come off like I don't--you\n\nknow, `These trends are ridiculous. Look at these morons,' bah, bah. But I\n\nfollow every stupid trend that's out there...\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: ...almost like a junkie, like, hiding my gear, you know, like\n\nI've tried Atkins, I've--you know, like, all this--you know, I try to buy\n\nwhatever the latest fashions are, and they look horrible on my, you know, fat\n\nass. Can I say `ass'? Is that OK, FCC? Oh, God. So, like, it would be\n\nreally fun to play a character that--because I've always said I would never\n\nbe--it was really funny because right before I got \"King of Queens,\" I\n\ndid--there was a big profile on me in the Calender section of the LA Times.\n\nIt was called \"The Anti-Standups.\"(ph) And it was me and Karen Kilgariff and\n\nPaul F. Tomkins. And I'm quoted in the article saying, `I would never be on\n\na sitcom. You know, they tried to get me to do a sitcom, and I said no.' And\n\nliterally a month later I'm on a sitcom, like could not be more of a sell-out\n\nif I tried.\n\nBut, I mean, you know, the whole thing about--if by being on a sitcom or doing\n\na commercial, that makes you a sell-out or makes you, you know, not\n\nartistically viable, then you probably didn't have anything artistically to\n\noffer in the first place if a sitcom or a commercial can crush that in you.\n\nLike, you know, Bob Dylan sells pretty lady underwear(ph), but it doesn't make\n\nme go, `That guy's horrible,' because he's Bob Dylan. You know, who cares?\n\nGROSS: Well, now that you've rationalized the fact that you're a hypocritical\n\nsell-out, we'll end the interview.\n\nMr. OSWALT: Completely. Thank you.\n\nGROSS: (Laughs)\n\nMr. OSWALT: Thanks, NPR.\n\nGROSS: Thank you so much.\n\nMr. OSWALT: I'm a sell-out. Vote for Bush!\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: Patton Oswalt has a new CD called \"Feelin' Kinda Patton.\" He plays\n\nSpence on the CBS sitcom \"The King of Queens.\"\n\nComing up, Lloyd Schwartz reviews new DVDs of Judy Garland movie musicals.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: New DVDs of films starring Judy Garland\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nA batch of Judy Garland movie musicals has just been released on DVD, and our\n\nclassical music critic Lloyd Schwartz suggests it would make summertime\n\nviewing. He says that even in the most lightweight of her films, she provides\n\nsomething deeper. Here's Lloyd's review.\n\n(Soundbite of song)\n\nMs. JUDY GARLAND: (Singing) I could go on singing till the cows come home.\n\nThen the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow. When I see your eyes, I go all\n\nout. I must vocalize till you shout, `Enough already.' I...\n\nLLOYD SCHWARTZ reporting:\n\nAlthough people weren't exactly aware of it at the time, Judy Garland's life\n\nstory was taking place on screen. Audiences were watching her, identifying\n\nwith her as she was growing up from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which its great anthem\n\nof innocent longing, \"Over the Rainbow,\" to \"A Star Is Born\" 15 years later\n\nwith its more grown-up anthem of erotic disappointment, \"The Man That Got\n\nAway,\" both with music by Harold Arlen.\n\nIn between came the infinitely charming piece of nostalgia, Vincente\n\nMinnelli's \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" his love letter to Garland at the\n\nbeginning of their personal relationship. Who could resist Minnelli's loving\n\nTechnicolor re-creation of turn-of-the-century St. Louis, the color fully\n\nrestored on this spectacular new DVD, or the memorable songs by Hugh Martin\n\nand Ralph Blane? But it's Garland who gives the film its third dimension, its\n\nemotional honesty and depth, whether in the exuberant \"Trolley Song\" or the\n\nwistful \"The Boy Next Door\" or in the achingly poignant \"Have Yourself a Merry\n\nLittle Christmas.\"\n\nGarland, more than almost any other singer, revealed both her extreme\n\nvulnerability and her determination not to be defeated by it, feelings a lot\n\nof people shared in 1944.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\")\n\nMs. GARLAND: (Singing) Someday soon we all will be together if the fates\n\nallow. Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow. So have yourself a\n\nmerry little Christmas now.\n\nSCHWARTZ: Along with \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" Warner Bros. has also just\n\nreleased DVDs of four other early Garland films, each of which gives her at\n\nleast one chance to shine. In \"Ziegfeld Girl,\" released in 1941, Hedy Lamarr,\n\nLana Turner and Garland play three aspiring Broadway showgirls. Garland is\n\nthe youngest and the most experienced. The best thing in \"Ziegfeld Girl\"\n\nisn't a big production number but an old song Garland sings at her audition\n\nfor \"Ziegfeld.\"\n\n(Soundbite of song)\n\nMs. GARLAND: (Singing) I'm always chasing rainbows, watching clouds drifting\n\nby. My schemes are just like all my dreams, ending in the sky. Some fellows\n\nlook and...\n\nSCHWARTZ: \"For Me and My Gal\" is from 1942, but the ea is World War I. It\n\nwas Gene Kelly's film debut after creating the title role in \"Pal Joey\" on\n\nBroadway. The movie is rather unpleasant. The Kelly character deliberately\n\ninjures himself, so he can't be drafted. But his very first number with\n\nGarland is completely delightful.\n\n(Soundbite of song)\n\nMr. GENE KELLY: (Singing) The bells are...\n\nMr. KELLY and Ms. GARLAND: (Singing in unison) ...ringing for me and my gal.\n\nThe birds are singing for me and my gal. Everybody's been knowing to a\n\nwedding they're going. And for weeks they've been sewing, they've been sewing\n\nsomething old and something new so, something that is blue so. They can make\n\nit true so for my gal. They're congregating for me and my gal. Look here,\n\nwhy, that's the parson waiting for me and my gal. And sometime we're going to\n\nbuild a little home...\n\nMr. KELLY: For two.\n\nMs. GARLAND: Or three?\n\nMr. KELLY: Or four.\n\nMs. GARLAND: Or five?\n\nMr. KELLY: Or maybe more.\n\nMr. KELLY and Ms. GARLAND: (Singing in unison) Love land for me and my gal.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nSCHWARTZ: Still noticeably missing from the current catalog of Garland DVDs\n\nare \"Easter Parade,\" the only film she made with Fred Astaire, her best film\n\nwith Gene Kelly, \"The Pirate,\" and \"Summer Stock,\" in which she does her\n\niconic \"Get Happy,\" another Arlen song.\n\nJust out on DVD, though, is Garland's very last film from 1963, the underrated\n\n\"I Could Go On Singing,\" a classy soap opera that also draws heavily on the\n\nGarland legend: the conflict between career and private life, a question of\n\nchild custody, even her appearance at the London Palladium. The score is an\n\neclectic mix of standards by Schwartz and Dietz and Kurt Weill and Ira\n\nGershwin with a disappointing title song by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg and\n\nnew material by her longtime music director, Mort Lindsey. Garland sells them\n\nall in a powerful way.\n\nFor all her personal and professional disappointments, a few years before her\n\npremature death, she was still embarking into very promising, new territory.\n\nGROSS: Lloyd Schwartz is classical music editor of The Boston Phoenix. He\n\nreviewed new DVDs of films starring Judy Garland released by Warner Bros. and\n\nMGM.\n\n(Credits)"
