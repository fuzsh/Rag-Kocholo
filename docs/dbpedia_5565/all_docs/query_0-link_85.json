        "text": "At PGC, the safety and well-being of each player is our top priority. For nearly the entire day, all the players are together on the court, in class, or in the dining hall. Our staff stay in the dorms with the players to provide supervision & curfew checks.\n\nThe players don't have a lot of time in the dorms, as they typically have less than an hour following the evening gym session to shower, have a snack and be in their room before curfew.\n\nThe dorms are typically two players (of the same age) to a room. If desired, you can make a roommate request during the registration process.\n\nAt many camps, the Director is a celebrity athlete or coach who lends his or her name to the program — but little else.\n\nAt PGC camps, the Director personally leads every session and takes the time to know every player by name.\n\nOur team of Instructors will be there to inspire and support your child through every session. Our Instructors are typically PGC grads who have played college basketball and coach high school or college basketball.\n\n\"I have worked with some great teachers of the game, however, this week at PGC, I observed the best teacher I've ever seen. The sessions were powerful, purposeful, and efficient. Not a session went by where I wasn't thrilled with the content and delivery. I can't tell you how impressed I am with PGC.\"\n\n— Coach Dave Jankowski, La Palma, California\n\nDo You Have A Guarantee?\n\nYou Bet. In Fact, We Have TWO Guarantees\n\nGuarantee #1 – The PGC Promise\n\nRegister for a PGC camp today. Send your child away to PGC for a week (or weekend) and after they attend the entire camp, if you don’t feel like they significantly improved in at least one of these 4 main components…\n\nBASKETBALL IQ\n\nMINDSET\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nPLAYMAKING\n\n… then you don’t pay anything. Just contact us anytime this calendar year and you will receive a 100% refund which is an outrageous guarantee, especially as we’ll be absorbing the cost of a week of meals and accommodations.\n\nIt’s also a guarantee you won’t find anywhere else in the sports world.\n\nGuarantee #2 – The ‘Dicky D. Downright Crazy Guarantee’\n\nPGC Founder, Dick Devenzio (Dicky D.), was a no-nonsense, no B.S. kind of guy and his basketball camps were no different.\n\nIn honor of Dick’s legacy, we’ve committed to upholding his standard of excellence and the mandate he set for PGC.\n\nAnd to hold ourselves accountable (and so you can hold us accountable), we’re offering you the following guarantee to help ensure we always provide the world class experience Dick would expect.\n\nIf your child attends an entire PGC session and you aren’t completely satisfied with their basketball experience, simply let us know and not only will we refund your entire camp tuition, we will also send you an additional $500 cash to help cover any of your other basketball events or travel related expenses this year, to help further your child’s development.\n\nDo You Have A Guarantee?\n\nYou Bet.

If they're not interested in learning the game, PGC is probably not for them, regardless of how good they are.\n\nPlayers are placed in skill-based groups, so if your child is a less experienced player, they'll be with others who are similar — and if they're one of the top players, they'll be with other top players.\n\nOver 125,000 players and 10,000 coaches have attended a PGC camp over the past 31 years and the feedback is consistent.\n\nPlayers who are eager to learn and get better have a really special experience. A player who thinks they know it all already and isn't interested in getting better doesn't typically enjoy their time with us.\n\nAs long as your son or daughter has a passion for the game and wants to improve, they're going to love their time at PGC.\n\nAs we stand behind the experience we provide, and to remove any risk for you, we are the only camp in the camp industry to offer a 100% Money-Back Guarantee.\n\nIf your child attends an entire PGC session and you aren’t completely satisfied with their basketball experience, simply contact us within this calendar year and not only will we refund your entire camp tuition, we will also send you an additional $500 cash to help cover any of your other basketball events or travel related expenses this year, to help further your child’s development.\n\nBut don’t just take our word on the impact of the PGC experience. Check out what a few PGC grads had to share about their time at PGC:\n\nThe average PGC camp attracts players from 11 different states, as well as a handful of international players. Hundreds of players fly, endure long bus rides, or beg a parent or coach to drive them 10-12 hours to get to PGC. We are constantly amazed at how far some players will travel to attend a session.\n\nRight now, players in North Dakota, Alaska, Lithuania, and New Zealand are coming up with creative ways to get themselves to PGC.\n\nSo, don’t let distance be a deal-breaker for you. Where there’s a will, there's usually a way.\n\n“When we left PGC, we had a 10-hour trip ahead of us, so I thought that Daymon would sleep most of the way home. Although physically exhausted, he was so energized and excited that we talked for over nine hours about his experience at PGC. He said, ‘Dad, this was one of the greatest weeks of my life.’ Last night, I watched him play in open gym and he is already incorporating what he learned into his game. Thanks for the positive impact that you made on our son.”\n\n— Joe Osborn, Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nSure, they can bring a teammate with them. The more teammates who attend PGC with them, the more games they’re likely to win next season.\n\nHowever, don’t wait to register until they convince some teammates to join them, or you may end up losing your spot in the process.\n\nIf your child only likes to attend camps with people they know, think of this as an ideal opportunity to stretch them out of their comfort zone. Even if their teammates choose not to enroll, they’re going to meet some incredible people—many who they’ll be friends with long after their PGC session.\n\n“Before I came to PGC, I was thinking, “I’m not going to know anyone there!”. But, as it turns out, I was welcomed into an extraordinary environment of athletes, instructors, and directors who made me feel like I was at home.”\n\n— Misha Jones, Manassas Park, Virginia\n\n“What I love most about PGC is the attitude and approach of everyone around me. I have never been surrounded by such great, driven, and positive people. It just shows what kind of athletes PGC attracts.”\n\n— Jacquie Chataway, Mississauga, Ontario\n\nYou can wait until you know your child’s complete summer schedule before you register. The only problem is, the session you want to register for may be sold out by then as most of our camps do sell out each year.\n\nTo make it risk-free for you, we offer Tuition Protection which gives you a full refund if you cancel more than 5 days before your camp and a 100% PGC credit if you cancel within 5 days. In addition, as long as it's at least two weeks prior to your session, you can transfer to another camp without any additional cost.\n\nThings sometimes come up that are unavoidable—we get it. That's why we offer Tuition Protection, so you can have peace-of-mind.\n\nCancellation Policy: If your child can't attend the camp for any reason, including schedule conflicts, last-minute injuries, a concussion, an unexpected illness, or a family emergency, you will receive a 100% credit for camp fees paid that can be applied to a future camp, transferred to a friend, or donated to an underprivileged player. Without tuition protection, camp fees are non-refundable.\n\nIn the unlikely event that PGC has to cancel the camp, 100% of your tuition fees paid will be credited towards a future PGC camp.\n\nWith Tuition Protection: The purchase of tuition protection during registration will give you a full refund if you cancel more than 5 days before your camp and a 100% PGC credit if you cancel within 5 days of camp. ($125)\n\nWhile the level of competition may vary slightly from session to session, there is nearly always suitable competition for the varying levels of the players. We occasionally have a pro player or top NCAA player who is significantly better than everyone else, but these players understand the intention of the week is development and learning, not competition. As long you as understand this too, it won't matter much who you're competing against throughout the week.\n\nSpeaking of top players, while there are significantly more high school players than college players in attendance at Scoring College and Point Guard College courses, college players typically benefit as much if not more than high school players. As we teach details and subtleties of the game, we’ve found the more playing experience someone has, the more likely it is they’ll benefit from a PGC camp.\n\nDon’t expect the dorm rooms to be like the Hilton – they’re not. Some are nicer than others, but typically the rooms are standard college dorm rooms.\n\nWe attempt to get dorms with air-conditioning whenever possible (nearly all college dorms have AC in the southern states), but some dorms don’t have it. You won’t spend much time in your room, but if you end up in a dorm that’s not very nice (or cool), it’ll be a chance for you to practice what you’ll learn at PGC about approach and mental toughness.\n\nIf you don't require a dorm room for the week, you will save $100 off the tuition fee. We do recommend staying on-campus if possible, as the 'full-immersion experience' is instrumental in the transformation process for players.\n\nNote: Meals are still included for commuting players.\n\nWe have hungry players and staff at PGC courses. As a result, every meal is all-you-can-eat. Each college cafeteria provides a variety of options at every meal, and we request as many nutritious options as possible, especially as our staff have to eat cafeteria food all summer long.\n\nBut, we can't guarantee your session will have amazing food, especially as we don't know what you think 'amazing food' is. If you're a picky eater, we recommend bringing lots of extra snacks so you don't go hungry.\n\nNote: We recognize some players have dietary restrictions and we work with each college to accommodate specific dietary needs. Please note your dietary restrictions on our 'additional information' forms once you've signed up and we'll contact you if we have questions.\n\nIf you are flying to a PGC session, you are responsible for your own transportation to and from the session. We recommend visiting the airport website(s) to determine the best means of transportation to and from the college. Many airlines have specific protocols for minors traveling alone. Please contact individual airlines accordingly.\n\nInternational Travel Insurance\n\nIf you are an player attending a session in a country where you are not a resident, you must either:\n\nPurchase international travel insurance and forward a copy of your certificate of coverage to PGC.\n\nProvide a written letter waiving PGC of all responsibility in case of an injury or accident.\n\nThe certificate of coverage or written letter must be emailed to [email protected] at least two weeks prior to the start of your session.\n\nFlight Times\n\nWe recommend booking a flight on the morning of your session that will allow you to arrive at the host college for check-in before 12 noon. If you arrive at the college before check-in begins, it’s not a problem (just bring a book to read!). If you are flying to your session a night early and you require accommodations, we may be able to assist you.\n\nAt most of our sessions, players who are at least 18 years or older can stay in the dorms a night early. To make a request for an early arrival, please contact us at least three weeks prior to your session.\n\nNote: We do not provide supervision or meals to players who arrive a night early to a session. Due to liability concerns, we are unable to provide early arrival accommodations to players under the age of 18.\n\nHow determined are you or your child to attend a PGC camp?\n\nIf you are truly determined, there are ways to make it happen, even if you are financially challenged. Lots of parents and players have done it. We hear their stories all the time.\n\nIf you can’t help your child pay for the camp, don’t let that stop them. Right now, a player in Texas is figuring out how many lawns he has to mow to get to a session, while a player in Chicago is calculating how many driveways she has to shovel to get to a camp. For decades now, players have been resourceful in finding ways to raise the money they need to attend. What about you?\n\nHere are a few quick ideas to assist your child, as they can:\n\nSee if their school’s basketball program or athletic department will support them.\n\nAsk family members to put holiday and/or birthday gift money towards the tuition fee.\n\nAsk a coach or a teacher for help in seeking financial assistance from a community organization. Many local small businesses raise money to support young people who need assistance—especially if the opportunity is focused on leadership and character development.\n\nAs a competitive athlete, your child will always face obstacles in their life, and some may seem impossible to overcome. But whatever the current circumstances, there is someone out there who has faced the exact same circumstances and found a way to realize their goals.\n\nOnce they've done these things, if they still need assistance, let us know and we'll do our part to support you. We help many players each year, especially when they've shown us their level of commitment to attending PGC. Get further details here.\n\nNote: We also provide a financial discount for clergy and military families. Contact us for details.\n\nIf you’re injured prior to your session, we recommend you still attend. Many players have done this, and nearly every player has said they were glad they did. The majority of teaching takes place in the classroom, so as long as you can write and sit in a chair, you’ll get all the information that every other player receives.\n\nNote: Every player's health and safety is our utmost priority. We've consulted college coaches and top athletic trainers to ensure we're taking every precaution possible to minimize the risk of injuries at the camp, including managing the physical load placed on players and ensuring proper rest and recovery time. We will also have an athletic trainer onsite for the duration of the camp.\n\nWhat exactly are they doing that’s keeping them so busy? Are their activities aligned with their dreams and aspirations, or are they just following the crowd and hoping for the best? Great players don’t base their games—or their lives—on hope. And, they certainly don’t follow the masses. First, they decide what they want; then they go out and find the people and learning opportunities that will get them there.\n\nWhat good is it to be seen by hundreds of college coaches at AAU events if they’re not doing anything special to stand out from the crowd? A good college coach can pick out the best players on the court within the first five minutes of a game. Sometimes, they can even spot the best players during warm-ups, just by noticing how they carry themselves and interact with others.\n\nSmart players spend more time “getting better” than “getting seen.”\n\nAt PGC courses, the safety and well-being of each player is our top priority. For nearly the entire day, all the players and staff are together on the court, in class, or in the dining hall.\n\nDorms\n\nOur staff stay in the dorm building with the players, and we ensure appropriate supervision and curfew checks each night. The players do not have a lot of time in the dorms, as they typically have less than an hour following the evening gym session to shower, have a snack and be in their room before curfew.\n\nOur Three Rules:\n\n1. Players are not permitted to enter the dorms of the opposite gender at any time or they will be immediately sent home.\n\n2. Players are not permitted to leave the campus at any time unless it is with a parent.\n\n3. Players are must be in their own room by curfew.\n\nThe majority of our sessions have 80-120 players with a 12:1 player-to-coach ratio. Typically, basketball camps are two to three times the size of our sessions, but we don’t take any more players than our course director can know by name.\n\nMost of our programs fill up and we turn away lots of players each summer, but we limit enrollment so that we can provide the best experience possible for players."
