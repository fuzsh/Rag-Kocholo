        "text": "Shot by Claude Loren Wedding Photography, Bangalore\n\nThere are thousands of regional communities in India, each equipped with deep-rooted traditions and customs, especially related to their weddings. One such is the Kodava community or the regional people of Coorg. And their wedding rituals are an absolute sight to witness!\n\nHailing from the Coorg region of Karnataka, the Kodavas are known for their special local cuisine and age-old traditions that tie the community together. They have a rich history, teeming with resplendent values, great culture and beliefs. Their lifestyle is a result of adapting to their local environment and making the best of what they have. The people of Coorg have always been known to live and work as a community with a sense of togetherness and these same values can be seen during their wedding celebrations as well.\n\nLike most Indian weddings, a Coorg wedding (or Mangala as called in their local language), is a fun-filled, joyous and colourful affair. If you're interested in finding out the kinds of traditions and rituals that complete a Coorg wedding, then now's your chance. So, scroll down and learn everything about Coorg wedding rituals and every reason why we love them!\n\nKodava/Coorg Wedding Rituals\n\nShot by Claude Loren Wedding Photography, Bangalore\n\nWhile Coorg weddings are about feasting and dancing, they're also an opportunity for relatives, friends and family to meet, exchange pleasantries (and gossip!) and of course show off their gorgeous festive wear and jewellery. A curious thing about Coorg wedding rituals is the absence of Brahmin priests that solemnize a typical Hindu wedding. Instead, prayers are offered to the ancestors at the sacred lamp while the wedding ceremony is guided by elders of the family. It is these simple but meaningful acts and some unusual rituals that make the Coorg wedding rather unique.\n\nCurrently, a traditional Coorg wedding is a two-day affair that may sometimes carry over to the early hours of the third day's morning. The first day is known as Urkooduva or Karik Muripa which mainly involves preparation for the wedding day. The second day, which is the wedding day is known as Mangala overarchingly. Here's everything you need to know about this two-day wedding affair!\n\nSource Pinterest\n\nBookmark: Understanding Kannada Wedding Rituals- All You Need To Know About This Rich Culture!\n\nDAY 1: Urkooduva\n\nSource Nishant Ratnakar Photography\n\nThe first day of a Coorg wedding is known as the Urkooduva (trans. village gathering). During this day, all present family members, both close and distant, are actively involved in the wedding preparations. A representative of every clan (okka) residing in that administrative unit, known as nad, participates in the wedding preparations as well. This person is instrumental in accompanying the groom to bring the bride home.\n\nOn the first day, a pandal is set up decorated with mango leaves and bunches of bananas with a fifth post made of a sap excreating tree which supports the structure. The pandal is topped by a canopy made of young jackfruit tree leaves or wild litchi branches and leaves. Present throughout the two days is a mediator between the bride and groom's side, called the Aruva, who plays a vital role. The aruva is a mediator between the bride and groom. He also overlooks the preparation of the grand feast that takes place the night before the wedding and is responsible for setting up the fifth and main khamba of the pandal.\n\nDuring the evening of the first day, a small party is thrown for close relatives and friends. At this party, alcohol and different varieties of meats are served. Unlike other weddings, Pork and alcohol are an extremely important part of a Kodava/Coorg wedding feast.\n\nAlso Read: A Deep Dive Into Telugu Wedding Rituals\n\nDAY 2: Mangala\n\nBaale Birudu\n\nShot by Pixel Chronicles Production , Bangalore\n\nThe baale birudu is a ritual where a row of nine or more (multiples of three) banana stalks are planted on the path leading to the wedding hall. Here, the first member prays to their ancestors and the village gods then strides around these stalks. The member then slashes off three stems one after another in neat strokes. Then, the next member takes over, slashing the next three. Finally, the last member performs the ritual and slashes the last three stalks. As this ceremony goes on, there's a tonne of laughter, hooting and encouragement towards these members to perform well and prove their warrior roots.\n\nAfter the family members successfully slash the banana stalks, the groom is led ahead by his bojakaara (groomsman) who holds an umbrella covered with a white cloth held over his head.\n\nWedding Ceremony\n\nShot by Karthik Photoart, Coorg\n\nSurprisingly, Kodava weddings do not have priests present to overlook the proceedings like other Hindu weddings. Instead, all rituals are overlooked by the elders of the family. During the wedding ceremony, the couple and their families seek the blessings of Goddess Kaveramma and that's possibly one of the few religious rituals present at a Coorg wedding. Other than that, the bride and groom (and their families) seek the blessings of their ancestors under the guidance of their elders. Furthermore, ancient dialogue, called sammanda kodupo, between the aruvas of the two families/clans are exchanged which solemnizes the marriage union.\n\nCheck Out: Indian Christian Weddings- Everything You Need To Know About This Magical Affair\n\nShot by Claude Loren Wedding Photography, Bangalore\n\nFirst, the groom sits after putting aside his Odi Kathi (a Kodava war knife) and Gejje Thande (a sacred wand). In Kodava weddings, it is the mother who has the honour of blessing her children before anyone else. She showers the couple's heads with handfuls of rice taken from a bell-metal or silver plate.\n\nShot by Claude Loren Wedding Photography, Bangalore\n\nThen, she offers a sip of milk to them from a tiny pot and ties a gold coin to the bride's shoulder as a blessing. In Kodava traditions, once married, a woman wears a pathak (a gold coin set with corals or rubies, surmounted with a cobra hood). This Pathak is their version of a mangalsutra. It is associated with various symbols of fertility and is tied by the bride’s mother instead of the groom.\n\nShot by Claude Loren Wedding Photography, Bangalore\n\nFor Kodava people, marriage is all about partnership and sharing. The aruva lists out the properties in which the bride has been given rights. Though not that big of a matter, it is done to denote that the bride has a right over everything. The groom then ties a small silk bag (which contains gold, silver and copper coin) to the corner of the bride's saree. This is to express the complete sharing of their possessions with one another.\n\nWedding Feast\n\nSource A Cookery Year in Coorg\n\nOn the wedding day, the feast is much more elaborate than before. An average Coorg wedding menu consists of kadambuttu (steamed rice balls), paputtu (steamed rice bread), pandi (pork) curry, a chicken dish for the ones who do not eat pork, plain rice and vegetable preparations. The meal ends with payasam, kartha coffee or black coffee with jaggery and bananas. The food is served on a plantain leaf with a glass of alcohol, preferably rum. Homemade wines made from betel leaf and bird’s eye chilli are also served during weddings sometimes. Earlier it was also customary to place cigarettes or beedis along with the betel nut plate, for the departing guests. However now, betel nuts and bananas are served to the guests while leaving.\n\nBookmark: Elegant Arya Samaj Wedding Rituals You Need To Know!\n\nNir Edepe\n\nShot by Karthik Photoart, Coorg\n\nThe Nir Edepe is a ritual where the bride is welcomed to her new okka. During this, the family and guests gather around a well where the bride peels and eats a banana. Once this is done, she takes three areca nuts and carefully balances them on top of three betel leaves. This is then carefully placed in the family well by the bride. Following this, the bride breaks a coconut with her husband's Peeche Kathi (an ornamental dagger) letting the two halves drop into the well as well. She then removes the betel leaves and areca nuts and chews on them while removing water from the well. This water is used by her to fill four pots, carrying two of them on her head, accompanied by two other women that carry the other two pots. Slowly, the bride makes her way to the kitchen, tackling hurdles like distracting relatives and items placed in her path. The completion of the custom is a sign of her patience, endurance and sense of humour.\n\nCheck Out: Learning Andhra's Reddy Wedding Rituals Step By Step!\n\nAttire Of A Kodava Bride & Groom\n\nKodava Groom\n\nShot by Karthik Photoart, Coorg\n\nA Kodava groom at a Coorg wedding is dressed in a sacred ceremonial white outfit (known as kupya). In his right hand, he holds the gejje thande, which is a waist-high staff made from the Kari mara tree, decorated with strips of beaten silver and tiny bells. Tucked into his chale (strip of cloth tied around his waist) is his peeche kathi, a compact ornamental silver dagger, curved at the end and held in an ornamented sheath. A heavy thodang (a metal clasp of brass or silver, fixed at his waist) holds the odi kathi which is a large Kodava war knife at his back. He also dons a crescent-shaped Kokketathi, studded with cabochon rubies, and decorated with tiny seed pearls.\n\nKodavathi Bride\n\nSource Pinterest\n\nA Kodava bride at a Coorg wedding dons a traditional saree. The pleats of this saree appear at the back and the end of the saree is brought below the left shoulder, then secured over the right shoulder in a firm knot known as the molakattu. The design of the saree is so because, in the olden days, locals were actively involved in work and would have long hours in the field or climb trees in case of an animal encounter. The bride's saree is a red silk piece with gold brocade. One of the traditional customs of the Coorgi is to hand down the bridal saree from generation to generation. It is normally considered to bring good luck. She also wears a piece of cloth over her head called vastra, which is similar to the saree.\n\nBookmark: 50+ South Indian Bridal Portraits We Have Fallen In Love With!\n\nFinal Words\n\nShot by Claude Loren Wedding Photography, Bangalore\n\nThe Kodavas are a unique group of people and their weddings are just as unique and simple as them. That is not to say that these weddings aren't fun. If anything, they're an absolute riot and an experience worth remembering. So, if you ever get the opportunity, please do attend a traditional Coorg wedding. It is truly a one-of-a-kind and wonderful experience!\n\n..."
