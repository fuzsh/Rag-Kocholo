        "text": "Answer:\n\nThe Kuppia is a long black coat with a waist belt embroidered on it. It is a typical Kodavus dress. The traditional dress of the Kodavus, who are the native population of Coorg, is Kuppia.\n\nThe Kuffia is a long black coat worn by the Arabs and the Kurds with an embroidered waist belt. Historically, Kuffia is typically worn by Arabs and Kurds, and the theory of Arab origin is reinforced by the reality that it resembles the Kuppia of the Coorgi."
