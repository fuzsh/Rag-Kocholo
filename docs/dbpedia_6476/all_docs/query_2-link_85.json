        "text": "MAKING OF AN AUTHOR: MORE BY ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN\n\nBy P.T. Bopanna As a journalist, I had never imagined that I would be an author one day. For a […]\n\nTECHNOLOGY POWERS AFFORDABLE REPRINT OF ‘THE ROMANCE OF INDIAN COFFEE’\n\nBy P.T. Bopanna Though most of my books are out of print, I have found a new way to make […]\n\n2023 LANDMARK YEAR FOR COORG\n\nBy P.T. Bopanna For Coorg, the year 2023 is the best of times, and also not so best of times. […]\n\nKODAGU’S PRIDE: COORG INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (CIT)\n\nJust like two Indias, there are two Kodagus (Coorg) in Karnataka. One comprises of backward-looking bunch of Kodavas (Coorgs) who think they can protect their culture by issuing fatwas. Another set of Kodavas are forward-looking and believe that education is key to the progress of the community.\n\nKODAVA THAKK , AN INDEPENDENT LANGUAGE , NOT A DIALECT\n\nA language is not only a means of communication – it is a repository of the cultural values and traditions of a people and an important determinant of its identity. It is a living, dynamic record of the history and experiences of a people, memories of which are preserved and conveyed to future generations in words, proverbs, riddles, songs, myths and stories.\n\nKODAVA THAKK (COORG LANGUAGE): FLAVOUR OF THE SEASON\n\nBy a happy coincidence, Kodava language has been the flavour of the season this January.\n\nIt began with the news that Pattole Palame, the monumental work by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, covering Kodava culture, folksongs and traditions, had completed 100 years.\n\nCONTRARIAN VIEW: WHAT SHOULD KODAVAS (COORGS) FIGHT FOR?\n\n“What should Kodavas fight for?” is a question typical of a community stranded at the crossroads of their socio-cultural journey. The question can also be rephrased as, “Which road should Kodavas take?” One road will take them towards reaffirmation of their cultural identity and clinging to their roots in Coorg.\n\nCOORG JEWELLERY WEBSITE COMPLETES TEN YEARS\n\nwww.coorgjewellery.in, the first exclusive website devoted to Coorg jewellery and costume, has completed 10 years. The culture of Kodavas (Coorgs) in Kodagu district of Karnataka is distinct from that of its neighbours in southern India.\n\nACTRESS RASHMIKA MANDANNA THROWS SPOTLIGHT ON COORG STYLE SARI. VIDEO ON HOW TO DRAPE KODAVA SARI\n\nThe Coorg style sari recently worn by actress Rashmika Mandanna (in picture), who is fresh from the success of the movie ‘Pushpa-The Rise’ has thrown the spotlight on Kodava (Coorg) sari.\n\nRashmika, who won the title National Crush of India, hails from the Kodava community in Karnataka’s Kodagu (Coorg) district. Kodavas have a distinct culture.\n\nIN JEST: ACTRESS RASHMIKA’S SLEEVELESS BLOUSE IS A RED RAG FOR THESE COORG LADIES\n\nThe Kodava community (Coorgs) in Karnataka was once known for its progressive and cosmopolitan outlook. But things have changed. Nowadays, a section of the women in the community observe everything through ‘saffron tinted’ glasses.\n\nThese women are upset with actress Rashmika Mandanna of ‘Pushpa – The Rise’ fame for wearing sleeveless blouse while wearing a Kodava or Coorg style sari recently.\n\nRECALL: LUNCH WITH KARNATAKA’S POLICE INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AT KOSHY’S\n\nOver 25 years ago, I was invited for lunch at Bengaluru’s iconic Koshy’s by Dr S.A. Subbaiah, IPS, who was then heading the Karnataka State police intelligence wing.\n\nIt was unusual to be invited by a top intelligence official. But the invitation was preceded by several developments in which the prime minister’s office (PMO) was interested.\n\nCOORG MATCHMAKING: GIRLS CALL THE SHOTS\n\nIt is the girls who call the shots in the matrimonial market in the Kodava (Coorg) community in Karnataka. It is not just that. Nowadays, the girls expect the Kodava boys to have a “sense of humour”.\n\nThe evolution of matchmaking in the microscopic Kodava community living in Kodagu district, has undergone several twists and turns in the last 50 years.\n\nPAVITHA ASHWIN’S PAINTINGS REFLECT NATURE WORSHIP CONCEPT PRACTICED BY KODAVAS (COORGS)\n\nChiriapanda Pavitha Ashwin’s paintings drew much appreciation at the recently concluded ‘All Kodava Artist Visual Art Exhibition’ held at the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath in Bengaluru.\n\nPavitha (in picture), daughter of Mayanamada Poonacha and Bojamma, hails from Srimangala in Kodagu (Coorg). Currently residing in Bengaluru, she started her art journey in 2005.\n\nMAGNUM OPUS: LIFE AND TIMES OF NADIKERIANDA CHINNAPPA, COMPILER OF ‘PATTOLE PALAME’\n\nMuch as we admire him and are inspired by him, we have never seen our grandfather Nadikerianda Chinnappa – he died before we were born. We are cross-cousins. This narrative is based on recollections of our parents, aunts and elder cousins, gleaned in casual conversations over the years.\n\n‘COORG PERSON 2020’ DR SANJANA KATTERA COMPLETES HER MASTERS FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\n‘Coorg Person of the Year’ Dr Sanjana Kattera (in picture) has completed her Masters in public health from the prestigious Harvard University in the United States.\n\nDr Sanjana, member of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial team, had won the Coorg Person title in 2020, perhaps the youngest to win the title.\n\nAMERICAN RESEARCH PAPER TRIES TO CRACK THE RIDDLE ON ORIGIN OF KODAVAS (COORGS)\n\nA research paper published in an American science journal has ruled out that Kodavas (Coorgs) in Kodagu district of Karnataka have foreign origin, but opined that Kodavas are “as local as their neighbouring communities.”\n\nA recent paper published in the open-source scientific journal BioRxiv summarized their findings of whole genome data from 111 US-based Kodavas.\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY MUSINGS: ‘KODAVAME’ (COORG WAY OF LIFE) IS MY RELIGION\n\nAs a born Kodava (Coorg), I feel the Kodava belief in ancestor and nature worship, is nearer to rationalism, than the mainstream Brahminical Hinduism.\n\nBecause the Kodava faith was transmitted orally down generations, it was not frozen in time and remained flexible to adopt to changing circumstances.\n\nKODAVA HERITAGE: WHY ‘KODAVAME’ (COORG WAY OF LIFE) IS RELEVANT TODAY?\n\nResearchers Dr Boverianda Nanjamma Chinnappa and Boverianda Chinnnappa (in picture) have tried to answer the question as to why Kodavame or Kodava way of life is relevant today.\n\nIn their foreword to the book ‘Are Kodavas (Coorgs) Hindus?’, the couple has noted that Kodavame is a precious heritage “handed down to us by our ancestors”.\n\nHEROES OF THE FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN COORG\n\nThough the Coorgs (Kodavas) benefited from the British rule, the nationalist movement sweeping India, did not spare Coorg (Kodagu). The freedom movement threw up several leaders from Coorg. Many common people, including students, courted arrests in large numbers to protest against the British rule. During the ‘Quit India’ movement alone, 150 people were arrested in Coorg and 80 persons were imprisoned.\n\nAUTONOMOUS KODAGU COUNCIL IS THE ANSWER\n\nThe Indian federal system is unique and distinct in a wide range of ways. The defenders of the classical Western notion of federalism even went to the extent of arguing that India was not a truly federal state. They were willing to concede only a quasi-federal status to the Indian arrangement as crafted by the Constitution.\n\nSANSKRITIZATION: FAULTY INTERPRETATION OF KODAVA CULTURE BY PROF. M.N. SRINIVAS?\n\nMy review essay, ‘Ethnography Frozen in Time,’ written in 2003, for the Economic and Political Weekly was born out of my discomfort with Prof. M. N. Srinivas’s book Religion and Society among the Coorgs of South India. This book, first written in 1952 and reprinted in 2003, with a fresh introduction from Andre Beteille, is considered a sociological classic..\n\nSECOND EDITION OF KODAVA REFERENCE BOOK ‘PATTOLE PALAME’ TO BE LAUNCHED ON OCTOBER 1\n\nThe second edition of the Kodava reference book Pattole Palame will be launched on October 1. The second edition has all the songs, ballads, proverbs, stories etc. in Kodava thakk with the corresponding English translation presented side by side. The book will be launched at the Madikeri Press Club at 2 p.m.\n\nANCESTOR WORSHIP: KODAVAS (COORGS) SHOULD MAINTAIN SANCTITY OF THEIR PLACES OF WORSHIP\n\nThis is the season of the year when Kodavas (Coorgs) in Kodagu district of Karnataka perform the annual ritual of Karanang Kodpo held in memory of ancestors.\n\nA lamp is kept in the nellakki nadu bade (central hall in the ancestral home). The sacred area around the lamp is empty and no idol or photograph adorns the space.\n\nARE KODAVAS (COORGS) A SEPARATE RACE OR A TRIBE?\n\nI am glad that Justice (Retd) P.P. Bopanna agrees with me that Kodavas are not Hindus. He has rightly pointed out that we presently come under Hindu laws. This anomalous situation has arisen because the Union government decided to bracket small communities like Kodavas, who do not belong to any major religious groups, with the majority Hindu religion, since it is impractical to have exclusive laws for every community in India, due to the large number of communities involved.\n\nCOORG PERSON OF THE YEAR: CREATING ROLE MODELS\n\nKodavas, a microscopic minority community hailing from Kodagu (Coorg) in Karnataka, were once known for their leadership qualities.
