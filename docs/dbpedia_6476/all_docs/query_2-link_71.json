        "text": "Coorg is popularly known as Kodagu. The name derived from Kodimalenad which means dense forest lands on steep hills.\n\nCoorg is the anglicized form of Kodagu, though it is called and written in Karnataka by its original name `Kodagu. This district lies on the summits of the Eastern and the Western slopes of Western Ghats. It is bounded on the North by Hassan District, on the East by Mysore District, on the West by South Canara District, and on the South by the Cannanore District of Kerala State.\n\nCoorg is the smallest district in Karnataka State and in population also it is the lowest. The area of the District is 1590 Sq Miles or 4118 Sq KMs. The historical period of Kodagu begins from about 2nd Century AD. But as in the case of almost every place in India, Kodagu also had a legendary period before its history begins.\n\nThe District has a mountainous configuration which presents a grand panorama of verdant valleys, ravines, fast and luring streams, lofty peaks and awe-inspiring spurs. The splendour of Kodagu, the picturesque view of the land with its beautiful green sward and varied foliage, grassy or forest clad hills, behold the eye of every stranger who has an aesthetic mind to enjoy the beauty of nature.\n\nThe people of Kodagu comprise of all religious faith, caste, creed, community and tribes, but the most ancient among them are Kodavas and those speak Kodava Language. Kodavas have a unique culture uncommon to others.\n\nAmong various communities in India, the Kodavas have perhaps most clearly evidenced the impact of change during the past 200 years. Considered to be a microscopic community, the analytical unit provides a link between social and economic change and political life, between structural change in society and political sentiments and behavior.\n\nThe Kodavas have had a turbulent and colourful history. Their efforts to safeguard their land assumed dramatic forms in a series of escalating confrontations with the rulers of neighbouring countries. These confrontations and adaptations provide rich material for an analysis of a political and cultural life of a community in change.\n\nIn complexity and range of problems involved in the relationship of caste to Indian political life have elicited an extensive literature in recent years. Social scientists and historians have made impressive contributions both to the descriptive knowledge and most importantly to the theoretical understanding of the interaction between society and political system.\n\nNon-literacy has been a severe handicap to many primitive people and this applies to the Kodavas also in respect to their past history. Though the Kodavas are today one of the most literate of the communities, the position was rather backward two centuries back. As such there is no reliable written material to shed light regarding the past. This has been a major handicap to anthropology as well as to any scientific study regarding them.\n\nIt was within the land of Coorg, the Kodavas traditionally made their home drawing life from cultivation. The land was fertile and life was happy. The traditional account of the origin of the Kodavas is little known today among the community. But the Kodavas are said to be a distinguished community belonging to the highest cadre in the anthropological scale.\n\nIn the ranking of castes in the south, the Brahmins by tradition and sanction, occupied in supreme position in the hierarchy of ritual purity. But anthropologists like Sir.Eriskine Perry and others point out that the Kodavas have no resemblance to any of the races of South India and they are by far the finest race they had seen in India in point of independent bearing, good looks and all outward signs of wellbeing.\n\nAs years rolled, Kodavas migrated into other parts of India, climbing the echelons of higher education and employment. Bangalore, being the capital of Karnataka, was the priority hub. As years rolled Kodavas migrated into other parts of India from Kodagu mainly for higher education and employment. Especially after re-organization of States Kodagu become part of Karnataka.\n\nBangalore being the Capital of Karnataka offered better education facilities and employment. Therefore majority of Kodavas started settling down in Bangalore. As is the practice, like any other community, Kodavas decided to come together and form a social network.\n\nAccordingly Coorg Association was established in the year 1911. This Association had only 15 members and year after year the number of Kodavas increased in Bangalore. The Coorg Association was renamed as Kodava Samaja, Bangalore.\n\nIn the initial days the Samaja functioned from private houses or some public places. In the year 1959 the Maharaja of Mysore donated 1 acre of land to Kodava Samaja through our great soldier Late Field Marshal Kodandera M Cariappa to whom this land was to be given. The broad minded Cariappajja decided to hand it over to Kodava Samaja, Bangalore which was registered in the year 1961 at Vasanthanagar, Bangalore from where the present Kodava Samaja functions.\n\nAs you all know, Kodava Samaja, Bangalore is a mother body and has a great history indeed. Today Bangalore Kodava Samaja has a Royal standing beckoning the Kodavas world over.\n\nThe multifarious activities handled by Kodava Samaja, Bangalore is known all over and proudly Kodavas call Kodava Samaja, Bangalore their Aiynemane.\n\nThe spontaneous assistance available to Kodavas at times of tragedy and illness, is appreciated all over. The meritorious students are indentified in the field of education with scholarships/freeships and awards to those toppers in various examinations are some of the significant activities of Kodava Samaja.\n\nThe Employment Cell situated in Kodava Samaja has programmes for training, placements and personnel developments which are absolutely necessary in these days of competitive living.\n\nKodava Samaja makes no secret of their efforts to uplift the poor Kodavas, Senior Citizens and the deserving youth in all respects. The expansion programmes in the field of education, health and infrastructure development are on the priority list.\n\nThe Cauvery School and the College are rendering yeoman service in the field of education and the Kodava Samaja has been at their back to maintain excellence in every activity of the Institution.\n\nPrepared by\n\nMonnanda Seetha Aiyanna\n\nFormer Vice President\n\nKodava Samaja Bangalore.\n\nBangalore kodava samaja has completed its 100th year of existence in 2011. The beginning of the present kodava samaja is traced to the year 1911. It was in this year , that eight kodava families of Bangalore comprising of just about 30 people came together and formed an association and named it as Coorg Association.\n\nTwo prominent kodavas of the town then, shri Kodanda. A. Nanjappa and shri Kuppanda Mudappa, D.F.O played a key role in the formation of the Coorg Association. The celebration of Kailpodu festival at the residence of shri Kodanda Nanjappa in September 1911 is regarded as the first meeting of Coorg Association. Shri Kodanda .A.Nanjappa and shri Kodanda .A Machaiah, between themselves managed the affairs of Coorg Association from 1911 to 1941, with the active support from other members. The name of Coorg Association of Bangalore was christened as Bangalore Kodava Samaja in the year 1962.\n\nBangalore Kodava Samajas journey towards its 100th year is full of ups and downs and trials and tribulations. It has withstood all the problems and challenges over the past decades and has become strong and solid today.\n\nThe kodavas of Bangalore from all walks of life, the rich and the poor have all contributed their mite for the rise and growth of the Samaja. A few kodavas have made immense contributions in many different ways to the samaja.\n\nThe affairs of the samaja are managed by team of office bearers, headed by the president. The president has a key role to play in the functioning of the samaja. Prominent Kodavas of Bangalore who have occupied the position of the president of the Bangalore kodava samaja during the last 99 years, year wise are-\n\n(1) Kodanda .A.

Pemmaiah (From 2022)\n\nMany developmental works and activities have taken place during the tenures of the above presidents and their respective teams. A small effort is made here to trace and highlight the major developmental work and activity of the Bangalore Kodava Samaja during the last 100 years in a chronological order.\n\n1911\n\n(1) Kodava families staying in Bangalore come together and form Coorg Association.\n\n(2) Kailpodu celebrated in September 1911 at the residence of kodanda Nanjappa\n\n(3) From 1911-1917 kailpodu was celebrated at the residences of prominent Kodavas of Bangalore under the banner of Coorg Association\n\n(4) There were just 8 families with over 30 members in Bangalore\n\n1917\n\nA small committee came into being to collect donations from all the families of the association.\n\n1930\n\nFrom this year Kailpodu festival was celebrated at prominent public places like Lalbagh, cubbon Park and YMCA hall, instead of celebrating it in the residences of a few kodavas.\n\n1936\n\n(1) Silver Jubilee of the Coorg Association was celebrated in a very grand scale\n\n(2) The practice of celebrating Puthari festival was initiated in this year\n\n(3) Kodanda Nanjappa, Kodanda Machaiah, Iychetria Madappa , Iychetria Ponnappa , Brig Cheppudiara Ponnappa and Maneyapanda Muthanna managed the affairs of the Coorg Association\n\n1941\n\nAnother parallel Coorg Association came into being, continued till the year 1950\n\n1950\n\nBoth the Associations got merged, by setting aside their differences.\n\n1956\n\nThe Reorganization of States and the incorporation of Coorg State with Mysore state saw a large influx of kodavas to Bangalore.\n\n1960\n\n(1) Shri Jayachamaraja Wodeyar, former Maharaja of Mysore, donated one acre of Land to General Kodendera.M.Cariappa in recognition of his distinguished Military service to the Nation, in Vasanthnagar\n\n(2) General K.M.Cariappa donates one acre of land to the Coorg Association\n\n(3) Rao Bahadur Pemmanda .K.Monnappa(IGP of Mysore State Police)then, was the president of the Coorg Association.

The governing council constitutes various committees and sub committees for the purpose. Centenary Logo released on 28th January 2011, coinciding with 112th Birthday celebrations of Field Marshall Late Kodandera.M.Cariappa.\n\n(2)A new branch of Cauvery School opened in the premises of Dasarahalli Kodava Sanga, Bangalore.\n\n(3) The Samaja pursues with the Government of Karnataka to grant five acres of land at Yelahanka to the samaja, for the purpose of establishing an old age home, hospital, School, community hall and provide other facilities to the Kodava community.\n\nIt can be observed from the above facts that Bangalore Kodava samaja is involved in one or the other activity, since its inception in the year 1911. Its activities are so varied, that it touches almost every aspect of life of a kodava of Bangalore, ranging from health care to education and sports to culture.\n\nIt is doing everything possible for the welfare and wellbeing of the kodava community. Bangalore Kodava Samaja is not only a Model Samaja for other Kodava Samajas, but it is a Model Community Association for the entire state of Karnataka.\n\nThe Samajas practice of lending its Community Hall and other Small Halls with best of the facilities to the members for marriages and other small functions, at a very nominal rent, is great service to the kodava community. Its another practice of granting a financial relief of Rs 10,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased member, through the Death Fund is very unique and unprecedented.\n\nThe kodava samaja of Bangalore is like an Ayaan Maane for about 40,000 kodavas of Bangalore. It has become a common meeting place for the kodavas from different parts of Bangalore.\n\nThe Kailpod, Puthari and Cauvery Sankramana festivals draw a huge gathering every year. There is stiff competition among kodavas to receive awards and felicitations from the Bangalore Kodava samaja, for all their achievements be it in education, sports or any other field, during Kailpod celebrations every year.\n\nBangalore Kodava samaja earlier called as Coorg Association, which had just about 30 members in the year 1911, today has 10,000 plus registered members. The assets of the samaja are worth more than one hundred crores of rupees.\n\nThe annual financial turnover of the samaja is about six crores. It is really unbelievable to accept the fact, that a small kodava samaja which started its activities by collecting a membership fee of just fifty paisa from members, during the early 1950s and 60s, has become such a big and successful community association.\n\nThe Samajas Management style is very democratic. The elected office bearers of the samaja are supported by many committees and sub committees. A total number of 300 members are a part of the kodava samaja governing council. The 32 Kodava sanghas of Bangalore have further strengthened the roots of the Bangalore Kodava Samaja. Bangalore Kodava Samaja has emerged as an Elder Brother to all the other area kodava sanghas.\n\nMany kodavas have toiled hard under very difficult conditions in the past for bringing the samaja to this present stage. Their hard work and sacrifices are to be remembered for ever. An effort must be made to record all the efforts and services of the past office bearers, committee members and other karyakarthas.\n\nIn future some new facility or at least the new college building in kodihalli should be named after shri Kodanda Nanjappa and shri Kodanda Machaiah for their splendid efforts in the formation of Coorg Association, during very difficult times.\n\nThe immediate task before the new office bearers of the Bangalore Kodava Samaja is to organize a Grand Centenary Celebration, and remember all the people who have toiled selflessly for the progress of the Samaja.The samaja must also make use of this occasion to showcase the rich kodava culture and traditions to the entire nation and the world.\n\n(NOTE: There can be a few errors in the years mentioned.
