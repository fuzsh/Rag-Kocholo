        "text": "Tura, Oct 27: Sundar A. Sangma, President of the Garo Baptist Convention (GBC) in a letter expressed his concern and disappointment over the exclusion of Garo or Achik from the tentative list of 38 languages to be incorporated in the Eight Schedule notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs recently.\n\nIt must be noted that the demand for the inclusion of Garo language in the eight schedules of the Constitution of India is a long-pending and legitimate call.\n\nThe GBC has urged the government of India and the government of Meghalaya to consider reviewing and amending the recently released list and including the Garo or Achiks language in the revised list.\n\nThe Garo Baptist Convention also urged both the central and state governments to seriously consider the aspirations of Garo people in this regard.\n\nAbout 1.5 million people speak Garo in Northeast India, primarily in the five districts of the state of Meghalaya, and about 33% of the population of Meghalaya speaks Garo or AÂ·chik.\n\nThe language has also reached doctoral study level, and thousands of students pursue their studies in Garo language on academic front.\n\nAlso, there are demands for the inclusion of 38 languages, including Khasi, in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nThe other languages in the list that are yet to get approval includes Angika, Banjara, Bazika, Bhojpuri, Bhoti, Bhotia, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Dhatki, English, Garhwali (Pahari), Gondi, Gujjar or Gujjari, Ho, Kaachachhi, Kamtapuri, Karbi, Khasi, Kodava (Coorg), Kok Barak, Kumaoni (Pahari) and Kurak.\n\nThe other languages are, Lepcha, Limbu, Mizo (Lushai), Magahi, Mundari, Nagpuri, Nicobarese, Pahari (Himachali), Pali, Rajasthani, Sambalpuri or Kosali, Shaurseni (Prakrit), Siraiki, Tenyidi and Tulu.\n\nCurrently, there are 22 languages in the Eighth Schedule : Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santhali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.\n\nOut of these 22 languages, 14 languages were included in the Constitution.\n\nIn 1967, Sindhi was added. In 1992, Konkani, Manipuri, and Nepali were included.\n\nIn 2004, Bodo, Dogri, Maithili, and Santhali were added.\n\nAlso Read: Mobile internet ban in Manipur extended till Oct 31\n\nAlso Watch\n\nFind latest news from every corner of Northeast India at hubnetwork.in, your online source for breaking news, video coverage.\n\nAlso, Follow us on-\n\nTwitter-twitter.com/nemediahub\n\nYoutube channel- www.youtube.com/@NortheastMediaHub2020"
