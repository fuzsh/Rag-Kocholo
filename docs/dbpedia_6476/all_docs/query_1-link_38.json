        "text": "What is the News?\n\nResearchers have published a book titled “A Place Apart: Poems From Kodagu”. It is a bilingual edition of 21 poems by Appanna. This book will help spread awareness about the endangered Kodava takke language.\n\nWho are Kodavas?\n\nKodavas are an ethnolinguistic group from the region of Kodagu (Coorg) in Karnataka. They speak the Kodava language. They are traditionally land-owning agriculturists and patrilineal, with martial customs.\n\nKodavas worship ancestors and weapons. They are the only ones in India permitted to carry firearms without a license.\n\nFestivals: 1) Kailpoldu (Festival of Arms), 2) Kaveri Sankramana (worship of river Kaveri), and 3) Puttari (Harvest festival).\n\nKodava Takke Language\n\nKodava takke belongs to the Dravidian group of languages. This language doesn’t have a script. But over the years, it has found its way into a written form through Kannada.\n\nThe language has been classified as an Endangered Language by UNESCO as it is spoken by just 166,187 people according to the 2001 census.\n\nWhy is the Kodava Takke language endangered?\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the Kodava language becoming endangered. For instance, with the coming of the Haleri dynasty, Kannada became the language of communication, the language of the court and state. The language took a further back seat when the British introduced Kannada as the medium of education."
