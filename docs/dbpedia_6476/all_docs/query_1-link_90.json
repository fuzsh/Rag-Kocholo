        "text": "Prelude\n\nKodagu. A south-western Karnataka district also known as Kodava Nadu. However, it is far more renowned by its westernised name – Coorg. Just as Madikeri, its headquarter town, was better known till the other day as Mercara. Thrice I’d planned a trip to Coorg, and every time it got cancelled at the last minute. I had, therefore, schooled myself to accept that I’d never get to visit this ‘Land of Cauvery’, also described as the ‘Scotland of India’. But as it happened, I did get to spend an unplanned vacation there in March 2016. Short, but healing and thrilling.\n\nLocated on the Western Ghats with its lowest point being 3000 feet and the highest 5735 feet above sea level, Coorg is renowned for its coffee, spices and its indigenous Kodava population known to have been free-holding farmers and warriors. A nature fanatic like me would hardly want to stay anywhere other than a home stay inside a coffee plantation when in Coorg. My travel companion for this trip needed little persuasion to give up on the Karnataka Tourism Development Corporation’s hotel in Madikeri town and book a room for the two of us at Kavery Estate Home Stay instead.\n\nInterlude\n\nA morning bus for the onward journey was a deliberate choice to experience the changing landscape from Bengaluru (better known as Bangalore) to Madikeri via Mysuru (aka Mysore). Once outside the traffic snarls of the city, the landscape changed from concrete buildings to natural rock clusters that gradually yielded way to emerald green meadows before the Royal Palace of Mysuru appeared on the right side of the bus, where we had our seats – thanks to our pre-travel internet reading.\n\nSeveral of the hillocks looked quite interesting, like the one featured here.\n\nAs I desperately tried to click this one since it reminded me of a dinosaur, I was distracted by the writing on the wall. I, a compulsive non-vegetarian, was travelling to Coorg with my mind full of the region’s famous fried pork and pork curry. The wall graffiti advised me to become vegetarian, honest and kind. (The slogan in Hindi read: shaakahaari sadaachaaree dayaabaan bano. Anyone able to read the Nagri script can check it out on the photograph. (You’ll need a sharp vision, though. The image isn’t of a high quality. clicked as it was on a not-too-fancy mobile phone through the window glass of a moving air-conditioned bus!)\n\nThis wall writing kept me lost in thought for a while. What could be the factors behind a Hindi maxim appearing on a Karnataka wall, where most signboards and hoardings are in Kannada, with few English ones, even in the cosmopolitan city of Bengaluru? Hindi signs – well, no! And, this one certainly appeared outside city limits . Who wrote this one, then, and who was it meant for? A case of vegetarian cow-belt hegemony trying to entrench itself in this southern state with 12.92% Muslims, 1.87% Christians, and many among its 84% Hindus also non-vegetarians, including the Kodavas to whose domain we were headed?\n\nThe combination of the recommended characteristics was rather intriguing as well. Is it that non-vegetarians are by definition dishonest and cruel? Let’s start with the cruelty factor, for this is where ardent vegans inevitably try to pin down the likes of me who love and enjoy non-vegetarian food. Yes, there is some degree of cruelty involved in killing anything for the gastronomical delight of anyone. But then – what are human beings supposed to eat?\n\nWe humans are not endowed with chlorophyll with which to generate our own food. So, we have to kill to eat – whether it is plants or animals. Both are living beings. The only difference is that belonging to an animal species ourselves, our sensory perception of an animal being killed is sharp. We are happily oblivious to the dying gasps of a plant – or its shriek of pain when a flower, or fruit, or leaves, or whichever part of the plant body is torn off. Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose and Aldous Huxley did try to make us learn a little about this – but plants don’t bleed, you see!\n\nSo, it is okay to kill plants for our food – but not animals; that’s cruel. Well – not to me. I’d actually argue that non-vegetarians are more honest, since they admit the element of cruelty involved as a necessary evil in our everyday act of eating.\n\nThese musings kept me so preoccupied that I stared blankly at the lush green fields we were crossing, till the bus stopped for a short break at Channapatna. This is a township in the Ramanagara district of Karnataka, with a population of 71,942 and a sex ratio of 993 females per1000 males as against the state average of 973:1000 and the national average of 933:1000. Channapatna being a municipal town, this is an important piece of information for me. Urban India is crueller to its girls and women with a sex ratio as low as 900:1000, as against the rural ratio of 946:1000. While the Hindus form a majority at 55.66%, there is a sizable Muslim population also (42.96%). The literacy rate of Channapatna is quite high at 84.7% as against the state average of 75.36% and the national average of 74.04%. Throws some doubts on another popular myth about the Muslims of the country being resistant to education, doesn’t it?\n\nChannapatna is famous for its wooden toys and dolls, protected by a Geographical Indication (GI) tag under the World Trade Organisation, administered by the Government of Karnataka. Originally made of ivory wood, with rosewood and sandalwood also used occasionally, these dolls and toys are now made of other woods like rubber, pine, cedar etc. The use of ivory wood has been banned and both rosewood and sandalwood are rather expensive now.\n\nGiven that these toys are famous and popular to the extent of this township being known as the Gomebgala Ooru (town of toys) of Karnataka, I was surprised to find just one retail shop selling them where the Karnataka State Transport Corporation’s Airavata Club Class bus had stopped for a tea/coffee and snacks break. Since this category of KSTC buses are recommended as the best for long distance travel, one would have expected more shops doing business of something so typical of the place. The lone shop left me wondering how these artisans are faring in this globalised world; especially in a state that is proud to have its capital known as the Silicon Valley and the first Information Technology (IT) hub of the country.\n\nTo my question about how long these toys and dolls have been made in Channapatna, the shopkeeper iterated what Wikipedia tells us: Tipu Sultan had invited Persian masters to train local artisans in this craft. That would have to be in the second half of the 18th century. The retailer also waxed eloquent about the government saving this craft, which apparently was on the verge of dying sometime ago. He could not specify when this rejuvenation had happened, though. Cursory internet-based research tells me that the Karnataka Handicrafts Development Corporation, with some financial support from the Dutch Government, got this craft of lacquered wooden toy-making revived sometime in 2004 – 07. A Bengaluru-based non-governmental organisation named Maya Organic played a significant role in the revival. The lead scare in toys imported/ smuggled from China that got reported during this time also acted as a facilitating factor.\n\nSoon after that brief stop, we were in Mysuru and the Amba Vilas Maharaja Palace, better known as the Mysore Palace, emerged outside our window. It certainly deserves more than one cursory look from a moving bus.\n\nPast Mysuru city limits, the visuals outside changed into expansive stretches of woodland with wild bamboo and other varieties of grass thrown in. Closer to Coorg, the landscape gradually transformed into spice and coffee plantations. Starting at 10.30 in the morning, we reached Madikeri sharp at 4.20 pm.\n\nFugue\n\nWe had a car waiting to take us to Kolakeri village under the Napoklu Post Office – a short distance of about 27 kilometres from Madikeri town. This journey was an absolute bonus, not just because of the city signs fading and acres of coffee and pepper plantations greeting us on both sides of the narrow road. It was sheer good luck that the driver from Kavery Estate Home Stay had gone for a pilgrimage to Sabarimala and the owners’ son had come to pick us up. Being introduced to a region by an English-educated young Kodava man proud of his land and heritage was a pure bonus. A hired driver with severely stilted English and no Hindi – with a huge language barrier is no comparison at all. He might even be tutored not to chat too much with the guests! The difference can hardly be exaggerated.\n\nWe interacted enough during that 45 minute drive to know that pepper creepers have to be planted along with coffee plants, just as some tall trees, usually rosewood, were necessary to offer the coffee bushes some shade. We also learnt that Coorg, too, was feeling the effects of global warming, with the temperature already soaring so much that extra irrigation was necessary for the coffee plants. (It was 28 degrees Celsius at that point of time). Our host, on his part, discovered that we were not the touristy type armed with guidebooks marked with places to be seen. He realised that we would rather utilise our time understanding and absorbing Coorg. Despite the age difference, a friendship was born to change the nature of our Coorg trip.\n\nCoda\n\nOur new friend cum guide earmarked the few touristy places that we must see, as also an itinerary for places unmarked on the tourist map. In the evening, there was little to do other than roam around – absorbing the pure mountain air, the faint aroma of coffee flowers – and note that the houses in the village were all built Kerala style. The sparsely but functionally furnished ground floor room with its beautiful veranda opening into coffee estates on both sides had an instant calming effect and the warm hospitality of our hosts added to our feeling of bliss.\n\nAmong the tourist spots we visited was the Namdroling Monastery in Bylakuppe, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery locally known as the Golden Temple since all that glitters here – outside or inside – is real gold.\n\nThe monastery is beautiful, but the conversation we had with our young friend was somewhat disturbing. Mrs Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, had settled Tibetan refugees in Bylakuppe – our young friend informed us with a degree of resentment in his voice. He was probably upset that part of what he considers the land of the Kodavas was now a Tibet Camp, as it is locally called, with a sizeable Tibetan population.\n\nBuddhists, as the Tibetan settlers are, constitute only 0.02% of the district’s population. Why grudge them an asylum? Tibetan refugees started settling in Bylakuppe since 1961, five years before Mrs Gandhi would become the Prime Minister of our country. It was Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru who put the Tibetan refugee crisis high on the domestic agenda and also persuaded Bhutan to accept 3,000 Tibetan refugees for resettlement. I couldn’t help plunging into a short discourse on the humanitarian significance of granting asylum to people who have to become refugees due to a global politics of conflict and aggrandisement. I am by no means a fan of Mrs Gandhi’s politics – but how could I not make an effort to shift a young person’s perspective about refugee crisis per se?\n\nThere would be other moments when similar biases would surface in our otherwise suave companion’s views, which the social justice activist in me could not help addressing. Thinly veiled anti-Muslim sentiments, mostly expressed through anecdotes about Tipu Sultan’s crafty cruelty to Kodava warriors who had fought to preserve their freedom, betrayed a non-acceptance of Kodava Muslims as natural inhabitants of the land. True, there are historical accounts by British officials and historians about how Tipu first entered into an amicable settlement with the rebellious Kodavas to make them feel secure, and then captured hordes of them – women and children included – to imprison them in Seringapatam (Srirangapatna), the then capital of the kingdom of Mahishur, as Mysuru was then called. The number of Kodava captives varies from 500 to 85,000 by different British accounts. Letters written by Tipu himself refer to the capture of 40,000 Kodava people.\n\nThe same accounts – Tipu’s letters included – also mention forced conversion of the captives to Islam. There are records of about 12,000 Kodava men, women and children – all forcefully converted to Islam earlier – escaping to return to Coorg in 1791. That is when the third and final Anglo-Mysore war (1789 – 1792) was being fought between Tipu and the British. These people are known today as the Kodava Maaples, constituting a small minority in Coorg. They are Muslims by faith, but retain their original Kodava clan names and dressing habits. They speak the native language Kodava takk as well. To imply that these people do not belong to Coorg is to hold a rather crooked sense of history and community-belonging.\n\nCoorg today has a 15.74% Muslim population and not all of them are Kodava Maaples. There are records of Tipu bringing in about 7000 Shaikhs and Sayyids to settle in Coorg – many of whom were either killed or fled when Tipu lost Coorg. But some of them did stay back and worked out an affable relationship with King Dodda Veera Rajendra, and the native Hindus. Dodda Veera Rajendra, the king of Coorg earlier defeated by Tipu, returned to power after signing a treaty with the British and defeat Tipu in the third Mysore War. They are the Urdu speaking Muslims of the region and do not bear Kodava clan names. But even then, they have been part of this soil since the late 18th Century. How long does it take to ‘belong’ to a place? Where does history begin, really?\n\nIf these ripples disturbed me somewhere, there was more than enough compensation in everything else that we saw and learnt. The Abbi Falls, the district’s most popular waterfall, was beautiful, but far more breathtaking was the Chelavara Falls that few tourists know about. In spring, the water flow was limited, but the height and expanse of the cascade made it easy to imagine how majestic it would look after the monsoons with water gushing in great force from a height of 150 feet.\n\nWe did go to Talacauvery, the birthplace of river Kavery (Cauvery in its more westernised version), which waters the entire district with its tributaries and distributaries. At a specific pre-determined date each year, water gushes out from the underground spring. Known as the Tula Sankramana, this occasion is to Hindu devotees from the five southern states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala) of India what Maha Kumbh Mela is for the Hindus of north and central India. Here, too, there is a Trivenisangama – the confluence of three rivers as Kavery is joined by its tributary Kannike and the mythical Sujyoti.\n\nWhat impressed me most is that there was no bar on people of any religion visiting this pilgrimage with splendid scenic beauty – as long as the particular dress code of keeping your arms covered is maintained. The Jagannath temple of Puri came to my mind, displaying a prominent signboard warning non-Hindus not to enter – as I noticed Muslim families with women wearing hijabs and men in fez caps, as well as white tourists – Christians in all probability, but most unlikely to be Hindus – move around in the Talacauvery complex. The experience was the same in the Bhagamandala (literally, a shared circular space) temple nearby where Bhagandeshwara (literally, the Supreme Lord Shiva), Subramanya (known in other parts of India as Kartikeya), Mahavishnu, and Ganapati idols are installed and worshipped. Both of these sacred places feature prominently on the ‘places to visit’ list everywhere – from the district’s official tourism website to other prominent travel portals.\n\nWhat does not is the Nalknad palace in Kakkabe, called Naalnaad Aremane in Kodava takk. This typical Kerala style palace was built by the Kodava king Dodda Veera Rajendra between 1792 and 1794, after he managed to escape from house arrest by Tipu Sultan in Periyapatna. He returned to Coorg to wrest his kingdom back from Tipu Sultan and managed to recapture most of his forts, but not the one at Madikeri. That is when he built this palace to live and continue his fight with Tipu. This palace was the last refuge of Chikka Veera Rajendra, the last Kodagu king who was forced to surrender to the British. With his defeat and exile to Varanasi (Benares), Coorg came under direct British rule.\n\nMuch of this information is available, but not the fact that the building was indiscriminately rented out to film companies for shooting, and they happily coated the frescoes on the wall with thick plaster for their own needs. Not even the renovation attempt as recently as 2007 by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), a non-profit organisation, could restore all the frescoes. Nor does the Wikipedia inform anyone that there is a trapdoor leading to a short flight of stairs and a small room below – so dark that you can’t even see your own hand. A hiding room designed for the ruling king and his family, lest Tipu managed to attack and capture the palace. This hiding place did not save the last king from the British, though.\n\nThe most healing visit was to a private property, where the innovative owner has turned the surrounding jungle into a coffee plantation at a level lower than the water source so that he uses the force of gravity to water his plants without using any pumps. To maximise the natural force of a hilly river flowing down, he uses pipes of broader diameter at higher levels, gradually narrowing them down. There is a place where the water collects into a gorge, apparently so deep that the owners have not managed to have it measured yet. The serenity of this place was an assured balm for frayed nerves, disturbed minds, broken hearts and grieving souls. We sat on the rocks with our feet in the cool water, tall trees shading us from the scorching sun and filling our lungs with the pure oxygen they emanate; unknown birds whistling and chirping around us; the faint fragrance of coffee blossoms drifting into our nostrils.\n\nAs our young friend took us through a plantation tour, pointing out the difference between Robusta and Arabica coffee beans, explaining how the shade for the plants have to be just right since too little would burn them and too much would take away the greenness of the leaves – we learnt that coffee flowers are green as buds; then they burst into rich white blooms. As they dry and gradually become dark coffee colour – they are ready for the berries, which are also green first – appearing after the monsoons around July/August – and ripen into crimson berries, ready to be picked between late autumn and early winter. Pepper harvesting starts almost immediately after.\n\nHe also talked about problems planters face with labourers during berry picking season – usually between October and December. Most plantation owners maintain a regular workforce throughout the year, which needs to be increased several times during picking season. Entire families, mostly from Assam, but from other parts of the country also, come to Coorg during this time. The adults and older children engage in picking the berries – but little children trouble the adults – adversely affecting the quantity of berries they can pick in a day. If left in the quarters meant for them, the little ones play on the roads – leading to accidents and chaos. To address this problem, the Planters’ Association has arranged in recent years to pay the labourers by the weight of the berries they pick, rather than a daily wage.\n\nAs I listened to him, my mind was preoccupied with unsettling images of children being forced to remain away from school and basic education since their parents and older siblings have to engage in seasonal migration every year. Images of children being scolded and beaten up by exasperated adults, upset at being disturbed and therefore falling short in the quantity of berries picked, floated through my head. Thoughts of sensitising plantation owners about the needs of these children, which must be brought into focus beyond the profit and loss accounts, kept me preoccupied.\n\nThe return bus was an overnight one, again by deliberate choice – to make the most of Coorg on our last day. And did it prove to be the most thrilling one! I was informed that I can trek up to the Thadiyandamol peak, the highest point of Coorg, and return on the same day. I wasn’t going to miss that chance. The way up was beautiful in itself, partially up a grassland full of tiny flowers and ferns, then a jungle, and then some rocky terrain up and down another peak before ascending to the summit. But the view from the top was stunning – with clouds and green mountains engulfing one on all sides, a strong wind cooling the perched trekkers, panting as much from the exertion as because of the relentless March sun.\n\nThis Coorg trip was an unplanned one, which means I wasn’t carrying my trekking boots. Not even a proper pair of walking shoes. A pair of kito shoes and a couple of pairs of fancy, open-toe sandals – that was the repertoire of my shoes for this trip. Our friend brought the jeep up the rocky path as far as he could – reducing the four kilometre trek to slightly less than three. But even three kilometres up a rocky path is not easy by any means in rubber-soled kitos with no grip. Past the jungle, there weren’t even trees to hold on to and the path is steep. No stick, either. But I was determined to reach the top.\n\nAs I gritted my teeth and kept climbing, balancing my steps as best as I could, hordes of young IT professionals and college/university students crossed my path – either overtaking me in their upward journey, or trudging down. A woman with silver strands in her hair on her own in a pair of kitos with no stick must have been quite an incredible sight to them. Every single group stopped to look at me and ask if I needed help. As I thanked everyone and responded in the negative, they moved on – many of them looking over their shoulders to check how I was doing. This made me so much of a celebrity that several groups of youngsters who had overtaken me for the summit clapped and shouted hurrah when I finally reached. I still cherish that moment.\n\nAs I slid some, crawled some and managed to balance some of the way down to reach my soul sister, my travel companion for this trip, waiting for me in the shade of the jungle – her phone rang. She looked at her phone and then at me – asking me incredulously why I was calling her. That’s when the missing phone was discovered – which reached me some 15 minutes later through one of those young groups. It was my celebrity status which got me back my mobile– absentmindedly left on the rock that was my seat at the top!\n\nI’ve been back to Kavery Estate Home-stay and Coorg twice more in different company. Every time to discover something new about this beautiful part of my country. I’ll come back with more, therefore.\n\nParamita Banerjee\n\nPhotographs are by the author, Ms Aparajita Dhar, and Ms Neelanjasa Mukherjee – unless a different source is linked."
