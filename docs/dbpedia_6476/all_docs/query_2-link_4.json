        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn times past, every Kodaga village was self-sufficient. They had workers in many occupations, such as potters, blacksmiths, carpenters, goldsmiths and barbers. Their prosperity waned, however, and they have since sought other jobs, such as working on coffee plantations or doing other types of agricultural labor. Both men and women are industrious and disciplined. In addition to their work in the home, the ladies also bear the brunt of the labor on the farms. Modern individualism is adversely affecting the unity that was once found in Kodaga families. Traditionally, families were led by the fathers. However, today the discontented younger generation is continuing to breakdown this system by becoming more individualistic. The Kodaga people live near many Christians and churches. The church can reach them for Christ.\n\nMinistry Obstacles\n\nWhen there are no Christians in a particular people group, few if any, will consider the claims of Christ even if they hear them. It will take a miracle of God to bring the Kodaga people to Christ.\n\nOutreach Ideas\n\nPrayer Focus\n\nPray that God would raise up prayer teams who will begin breaking up the soil through worship and intercession. Ask God to encourage and protect the few known Kodaga Christians. Ask the Holy Spirit to soften the hearts of the Kodaga towards the gospel. Pray that the Lord would raise up long term workers to join the few who have already responded.\n\nScripture Prayers for the Kodaga in India."
