        "text": "Madikeri/Bengaluru: After a 14-year-long political and legal battle by the Codava National Council (CNC), the Karnataka Government, on December 5, 2023, issued a Gazette Notification implementing ‘Kodava/Kodavaru’ in Caste Certificates instead of ‘Kodagaru’.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the cabinet of the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government accepted the recommendations of the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission, replacing 'Kodagaru' with 'Kodava' and 'Kodavaru' in the Backward Classes list. However, the absence of the Gazette Notification displeased members of the Kodava community and CNC President Nandineravanda U. Nachappa.\n\nOn December 5, 2023, the state government officially issued the Gazette Notification, ensuring that the community name will be accurately stated in the Caste Certificates issued to members of the Kodava community.\n\nThe Kodava Community:\n\nThe Kodava community, residing primarily in the Kodagu district, also known as Coorg, Karnataka, India, is a unique and indigenous group. Known for their rich cultural heritage, distinct traditions, and martial history, the Kodavas take immense pride in their identity, language (Kodava Tak), and customs that set them apart.\n\nWhy did the Kodavas oppose the term 'Kodagaru'?\n\nIn the past, ‘Kodagaru’ was mentioned in the category 3 (A) caste certificate, impacting the cultural and social values of the Kodavas.\n\nSpeaking to The Kodagu Express, Mr. Nachappa said, “For many years, Kodavas have suffered due to their classical nomenclature not being entered in the State craft. The High Court ordered in favor of Kodavas, and the Government of India approved its implementation by issuing an official notification. Since availing caste certificates is an essential phenomenon in the day-to-day affairs of the State and society, we Kodavas are being treated like apartheid people.”\n\n“We Codavas are deprived of availing caste certificates under its folkloric/classical nomenclature. This kind of injustice is the greatest tragedy of the 21st Century in this largest Democracy, India, the largest ethnic diversity nation in the world,” Mr. Nachappa added.\n\nAlso Read: Exploring Kodagu's Mandh: The heart of Kodava festivities\n\nWhat does a 14-year-long political and legal battle entail?\n\nIn December 2021, the High Court of Karnataka directed that the State Government adopt the recommendations put forth by the Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission. These suggestions include replacing the term \"Kodagaru\" with \"Kodava\" and \"Kodavaru\" in the list of backward classes. The court directed the issuance of a notification to this effect within a three-month period.\n\nHowever, the government at that time failed to release the notification accordingly. The commission, following comprehensive investigations, had previously recommended in both 2005 and 2010 that the government use \"Kodava\" and \"Kodavaru\" in Kannada, as well as \"Codava\" and \"Codavaru\" in English, instead of the term \"Kodagaru\" in the designated list.\n\nMr. Nachappa said, “Our thanks mainly to the then Chairman of Karnataka Backward Class Commission (KSBC) C S Dwarakanath, who applied his Social Scientist perspective, High Court advocate Ballachanda Bolliappa, who continuously envisioned a legal battle without any compromise, Justice Krishna S. Dixit, the Judge of the High Court who delivered a landmark judgment in favor of petitioner CNC, incumbent Chairman of KSBC Jayaprakash Hegde, and timely righteous involvement of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Virajpet MLA Ajjikuttira S Ponnanna and my beloved CNC comrades, volunteers, well-wishers, supporters who stood with me unwaveringly in this long sustained journey.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nAccording to the Gazette Notification issued on December 5, 2023, moving forward, the Caste Certificate issued to the Kodava community will include the term 'Kodava' in both English and Kannada versions.\n\nHowever, the CNC expresses dissatisfaction with the government's decision to include only the 'K' version of 'Kodava' in the official documents, neglecting to mention the 'C' version of 'Codava'. Mr. Nachappa said, “It is a violation of the spirit of Mr. Dwarakanath Commission report and the main proponent and pioneer of the subject throughout, i.e., Codava National Council. This nomenclature is also being vulgarized in the Gazette while mentioning the WP No 48624/ 2016 [GM] along with the name of the Petitioner organization as \"Rastriya Codava Parishath,\" which is uncalled for and is disobeying the order of the High Court of Karnataka dated 8 December 2021.”\n\n“Hence, after the rectification of these errors, we will know whether it is deliberate or by mistake. Only after rectification of these errors, CNC can be jubilant. Codava National Council wants direct credit, not indirect or covert credit for this yeoman service. It is our rightful claim. It is not alms. Now, CNC is happy that one of the main ethnic issues is resolved. Codavas must avail its welfare benefits. Now Codavas happily relax or feel that we are living in a Welfare State,” Mr. Nachappa added."
