        "text": "THE AINEMANE\n\nThe ainemanes of Kodavas1 are more than just family homes; these are also sacred living spaces. Each ainemane is unique to a particular okka (family) and plays a central role in its rituals. Built overlooking the land cultivated by the family, the ainemane as a whole is a kind of altar to a founding ancestor, the guru karana (original ancestor of the family). Several features of the ainemane are oriented towards this role. The pride of place is given to the nellaki bolca, a lamp that is regularly lit each morning and evening in honour of the guru karana. The term ainemane is believed to be derived from ayyangada mane, meaning the house of ayyas (respected elders or ancestors) or house built by ancestors (Najamma & Chinnappa, 2003, pp. 88-128).The primary traditional built form of Kodagu, it is perhaps best imagined as a complex of structures including the main house, the granary, the kaimada (ancestral shrine) and the ale pore (outhouses or extended wings) with varying significance, functions, and historical development. The main house has tended to be most impervious to the passage of time, its built fabric maintained on account of the ritualistic meaning embodied in its spaces, while changes in lifestyle and social association have most visibly transformed the outlying structures.\n\nWhile Rice (1927, pp. 88-89) recorded a description of Kodagu domestic architecture in 1878, another description, with some emotional connect, of ainemane has been collected in 'Pattole Palame', an anthology of traditional Kodava folksongs and traditions prevalent in the late 19th and early 20th century. The description of a Kodava family home occurs in the second part of 'Batte Pat', translated 'Song for the Way' by Najamma and Chinnappa..."
