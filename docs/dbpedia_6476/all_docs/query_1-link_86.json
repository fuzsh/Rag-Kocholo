        "text": "Abbey Falls\n\nSince Coorg is surrounded by the Western Ghats, it’s no surprise that lush greenery is a big part of Coorg’s surreal views. Now add a gushing waterfall to the scenery and you will find yourself with an exciting Coorg tourism itinerary. Abbey Falls or Abbi Falls is located ten kilometres from Madikeri and is easily accessible by road.\n\nThe waterfall is situated at a height of 70 feet and is surrounded by breathtaking greenery. The view seems to be out of a painting and if you are a nature lover, you’ll be spending quite a few hours here. Abbey Falls is situated amidst wild coffee bushes and vast spice estates. There is a hanging bridge opposite the waterfall that offers the most spectacular view of the surrounding scenery.\n\nThe drop-off point for the downhill trek to the waterfalls is ten to fifteen minutes away. If you are travelling with elderly persons, it might be a good idea to reconsider this tourist attraction. The downhill trek to Abbey Falls offers spectacular views of surrounding coffee and spice plantations. If capturing the place you are visiting is a high priority for you, we think you’d find quite a few Instagram-worthy shots here. While there are a few stalls around the waterfall that serve basic snacks, it’s best to carry your own food.\n\nBrahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nBrahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary is among the lesser-known spots that make up Coorg tourism. It is separated from Nagarhole National Park by a row of coffee plantations. The sanctuary gets its name from Brahmagiri Park, which is the highest peak in the area. The unique geography of the sanctuary is a major reason for its popularity among people exploring Coorg tourism. Made up of grasslands, evergreen forests, lush hills and paddy fields, the sanctuary offers a unique opportunity to explore the local flora and fauna of Coorg.\n\nThe sanctuary is also an elephant corridor and connects the Nagarhole and Wayanad sanctuaries. A tour of the sanctuary will reconfirm the fact that men and animals can have a peaceful relationship and can coexist (a rarity in most parts of the world). The villages around the sanctuary are well-versed with the way of the gentle giants and have made changes to their lifestyle to accommodate the animals.\n\nIruppu Gate is the most popular entry to the sanctuary and the most accessible. If you are a bird lover, we highly recommend a tour of the sanctuary with a guide. Some of the popular birds that you can spot are the emerald dove, the Malabar trogon and the black bulbul. A tour of the sanctuary will take anywhere between three and five hours. It would be advised that you don’t combine too many tourist attractions with the sanctuary since that might exhaust you and dull your experience of Coorg tourism.\n\nDubare Elephant Camp\n\nElephants are intriguing animals that have kept animal lovers and wildlife enthusiasts engaged for decades. Their fierce solidarity with their own kind has been studied for years and continues to be a fascinating subject. If you are an animal lover who would like to learn more about this beautiful creature, Dubare Elephant Camp should be on your Coorg itinerary when exploring Coorg tourism.\n\nEach session at the camp is for three hours during which you can interact with elephants as well as learn more about their behaviour. Throughout the tour, you are accompanied by naturalists and tour guides ensuring your protection. If you are exploring Coorg tourism with young children, this is a wonderful activity that you can include in your itinerary.\n\nAn interesting facet of the camp is that it earlier served as the training ground for the vibrant Mysore Dussehra. The elephants are no longer trained for the occasion, but this fact still attracts travellers to the camp. Among the various activities that you can try at the camp, we suggest an elephant safari, a brief interaction with naturalists to understand elephants and their behaviour as well as a tour of the camp.\n\nHonnamana Kere Lake\n\nAn ideal itinerary is one that offers you a mix of everything. Whether it’s a spiritual attraction, bustling markets or natural attractions, it should spoil you for choice. A Coorg tourism itinerary offers just that. Among the top choices on this itinerary is the Honnamana Kere Lake. It is the biggest lake in Coorg and is a crowd puller for nature lovers and bird watchers owing to the surreal views it promises. But that’s not all, the lake is also known for its spiritual as well as historical significance. It is named after Goddess Honnamana and there is a temple adjacent to the lake that is dedicated to the goddess. The Gauri Festival takes place here every year and it is a huge part of Coorg tourism, especially if you want to explore the culture of Coorg.\n\nThe route from Madikeri to the lake is gorgeous and is surrounded by thick forests on both sides. If you enjoy scenic drives, this will certainly be the highlight of your journey. We recommend carrying your own picnic basket since there are no restaurants or cafes here. In fact, the lake is one of the lesser-known attractions of Coorg tourism.\n\nRaja’s Seat\n\nIs there a better way to enjoy the sunset than to sit on an erstwhile royal throne? We think not. Coorg tourism offers you this memorable experience if you visit Raja’s Seat. Situated amidst a vibrant garden, the seat overlooks the mountains and offers you a direct view of the setting sun. An erstwhile viewpoint, it still retains its charm and is a highlight for Coorg tourism owing to its history and popularity with the locals.\n\nFor the erstwhile kings of Kodagu, watching the sunset here was a regular activity and one that was valued immensely. Ironically one can see that today as well. The locals seem to enjoy picnicking at Raja’s Seat and it is one of the top recommendations if you speak to a local. If you are travelling with little ones, you will be pleased to know that there is a toy train at the site. A small addition but one that has increased the popularity of the picnic site immensely.\n\nSince Raja’s Seat is an attraction that you can cover within three to four hours, we recommend heading here during lunch and admire the setting sun as you wrap up your leisurely lunch. For those who’d like to end their day with a picturesque sunset, it’s best to head here around 4:30 pm lest you miss out on the best viewpoints.\n\nTrekking\n\nA lesser-known facet of Coorg tourism is that it offers plenty to trekkers and hikers. Whether you are just starting out or are an expert trekker, there is so much to try when exploring Coorg tourism. Most trekking expeditions are combined with camping, stargazing and bird watching so if you are in the mood to enjoy a trip full of outdoor activities, we highly recommend Coorg.\n\nTadiandamol Peak is one of the most popular trekking routes for adventure enthusiasts and is highly recommended if you are looking for a medium-level trek. The starting point is Nalknad Palace and the trek is 4.5 kilometres long. If this is the first time you are exploring Coorg tourism, it’s best to take the services of a local guide.\n\nThe Iruppu Falls trek is another popular trek owing to the spectacular views it offers. The trek takes you through dense forests with the sound of the waterfall always accompanying you. This trek will give you an opportunity to explore the rare flora and fauna of Coorg. One of the best treks in Coorg for beginners, it will take you anywhere between four and five hours to complete.\n\nThe Pushpagiri-Galibeedu-Subramanya trek and Subramanya-Kumara-Parvatha trek are a few other popular trekking routes that are a part of Coorg tourism.\n\nRafting\n\nAdventure enthusiasts planning to explore Coorg tourism can breathe a sigh of relief since Coorg offers a fair number of activities. Among which rafting is quite popular with travellers. If you have planned a long holiday to Coorg, it certainly makes sense to include this time-consuming activity in your itinerary. However, if you have only a couple of days in hand, it’s best to spend your day covering other tourist attractions. The Barapole River is the chosen site for all rafting activities in Coorg. It is an ideal rafting site with umpteen rapids and surreal natural beauty.\n\nThe rafting experience in the Barapole River is slightly challenging and if it is your first time here, it might be a little overwhelming. The rapids are strong and it’s a strong catchment area for the monsoons.\n\nSince rafting is a popular activity for Coorg tourism, we do recommend booking your spot before you head to the pick-off point. The activity typically takes three to four hours and covers a distance of four kilometres. Since it’s a physical activity, it tends to take away most of your energy and that’s why we suggest not planning anything else on that day. However, a hot meal of Coorg’s spicy curry might be a great way to end the day.\n\nExplore coffee and spice plantations\n\nTours of coffee and spice plantations have gradually become an integral part of Coorg tourism. As we become more aware of where our food comes from, this process becomes even more fascinating. If you are interested in the coffee-making process or are curious to know where your spices come from, this should be on your things to do in Coorg list.\n\nWhile some coffee plantations offer guided tours, others welcome tourists to walk around and explore on their own. Depending on the kind of traveller you are, you can either book a guided tour or choose to let your senses guide you. For those who are not interested in coffee or spices, this is a great activity simply because of the views that you will be treated to.\n\nHow many days do I need to explore Coorg tourism?\n\nThe number of days one needs to explore Coorg tourism will depend on the itinerary. If you want to include trekking, rafting and other outdoorsy activities, you will need a couple of days extra. If, on the other hand, you want to explore the city, the cafes and the local attractions, you can plan a trip for five to seven days.\n\nWhat are the things I should pack for a trip to explore Coorg tourism?\n\nCoorg is blessed with a moderate climate so you don’t have to plan extensively for your clothes and accessories. Depending on the weather in which you are exploring Coorg tourism, you can pack appropriate clothes and shoes. As for other basic essentials, you should carry extra cash, a pair of sturdy shoes and slippers, an overnight bag for impromptu day trips and prescription medicines.\n\nSuggest three tips for planning a trip to Coorg.\n\nTips can help save money, ensure that you have a safe trip and make your vacation worthwhile. Three tips that you should keep in mind while planning a trip to explore Coorg tourism are:\n\nCarry cash with you since the ATMs are only in the main towns.

Not only do they offer a homely experience but also give you an opportunity to learn more about the local culture. Some of the best budget Coorg homestays that are part of Coorg tourism are Victorian Verandaz, Casa Coorg, Little Jungle Homestay and Ananda Nilaya.\n\nWhich activities should I include in my Coorg tourism itinerary?\n\nIf you are an adventure enthusiast exploring Coorg tourism, there are a ton of things to add to your itinerary. Some of the things you can try are trekking, white river water rafting, visiting wildlife sanctuaries and cycling tours. For those who enjoy the laid back way of life, cafe hopping and tours of coffee and tea plantations are a great addition to your Coorg tourism itinerary.\n\nName three offbeat experiences that are part of Coorg tourism.\n\nDuring our travels, all of us look for unique experiences to make our trip more fulfilling. Whether it is learning more about the local culture or heading out to explore lesser-known attractions, offbeat experiences add charm to any vacation. Here are three offbeat experiences that you can try in Coorg.\n\nLearn more about Tibetan culture at Namdroling Monastery. It is the largest teaching centre of the school of Tibetan Buddhism known as Nyingmapa.\n\nEnjoy a leisurely picnic at Chikli Hole and admire the surreal views that the offbeat attraction offers.\n\nRent a four-wheel drive and explore Mandalpatti.
