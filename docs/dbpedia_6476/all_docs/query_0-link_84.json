        "text": "About Abbey Falls\n\nAbbey Falls (also spelled Abbi Falls and Abbe Falls) is in Kodagu, in the Western Ghats in Karnataka. It is located 8 km from the Madikeri, 122 km from Mysore, 144 km from Mangalore and 268 km from Bangalore.\n\nThe river is part of the early reaches of the river Kaveri. Flow is much higher during the monsoon season.\n\nThe waterfall is located between private coffee plantations with stocky coffee bushes and spice estates with trees entwined with pepper vines. A hanging bridge constructed just opposite the falls.\n\nThe falls was earlier called Jessi falls, named after a British officer's wife. However, the place was a thick jungle area back then. Years later, the waterfall was discovered by Mr. Neravanda B.Nanaiah who bought the place from the government and converted it into a coffee and spices plantation that surrounds the waterfall today.\n\nAbout Raja's Seat\n\nRaja's Seat (Seat of the King) is a seasonal garden of flowers and artificial fountains. It is one of the most important tourist spots in Madikeri of Coorg District. It is 270 km away from Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka.\n\nA pleasant spectacle of refreshing layers of greenery, chain of high and low-rise-mountains attired with mist, the Raja Garden was a one-time-favorite of the kings of Kodagu who used to watch the setting sun, and spend time with their queens here. It is shaped like a small square in brick and mortar, with four pillars bridged by arches, enhanced by beautiful surroundings. This lovely spot was a favorite place of recreation for the Rajas and hence was permanently associated with them. It is built on a high level ground with a commanding view of the cliffs and valleys to the west. Early in the morning as the sun is just rising in the east, the mist shrouded valley below offers a rare sight. The golden light of the setting sun is a splendor to watch. There is also a Toy Train for children.\n\nAbout Madikeri Fort\n\nThis 19th century fort, in the centre of Madikeri, houses a Ganesha temple, a chapel, a district prison and a small museum. The fort offers a beautiful view of Madikeri. This fort is one of the most beautiful places to visit during the trip to Coorg. Initially this fort was built by mud and later on mud was replaced by the concrete stone, by the great king Tipu Sultan.\n\nAccording to an official explanation board at the site, Mercara, the headquarters of Coorg or Kodagu district, was founded by Prince Mudduraja of the Haleri Dynasty in 1681 CE, and was named after him as Muddurajanakeri -- which became \"Muddukayray\" and Madikeri over time. The British termed the place Mercara.\n\nAbout Bagamandala\n\nAt a distance of 39 kms from Madikeri, 8 kms before reaching TalaKaveri, Bhagamandala is on the banks of the confluence of three rivers, Cauvery, Kannike and the sub terranian Sujyoti, popularly known as \"Triveni Sangama\". The famous Sri Bhagandeswara temple is located on the bank of the river over here. Pilgrims visiting Bhagamandala bathe (or sprinkle water on your head) in the Triveni Sangama, confluence of rivers and worship at the temple complex. Watch out for the wooden carvings in the temple. The subrahmanya idol in the temple is a swayambu and the temple was established by a rishi named Bhagamandala. The temple serves free lunch - you get rice, sambar and buttermilk. Not a lavish lunch, but a clean,simple vegetarian option instead of the poorly maintained restaurants in the neighbourhood\n\nAbout Talacauvery\n\nRiver Kaveri which is one of the 7 sacred rivers of Sapta Sindhus of the Hindu scriptures, originated at a place is called Talakaveri (head of Cauvery) in the Brahmagiri hills, at about 4,500 ft above sea level. This place is marked by a tirtha kundike or Brahma kundike (small spring/pond) from where the river emerges as a small perennial spring, but flows underground again to emerge a short distance away. It is about 48 km from Madikeri.\n\nThere is a shrine near the kundike and a big tank in front of it where devotees baths before offering prayers. There are 2 temples, a Shiva temple and with a rare and ancient Shiva Linga, and another temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha. This temple has a holy Ashwantha tree where, according to legend, the Trimurtis - Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh gave darshan to sage Agastya"
