        "text": "One such place is Coorg, a rather breathtakingly beautiful district in Karnataka. There are multiple reasons why we’d recommend going to Coorg, and that list would go on and on, but for now we’ll just stick to talking about the food. Because the local Kodava cuisine, with eating traditions largely unchanged from the time of their ancestors, is definitely something to talk about.\n\nThe Kodagu (​Coorg​) district shares its Southern borders with Kerala, and is a place you’ve probably heard of for its scenic beauty and obvious ‘get-away’ touristy appeal. But the region, with its proud people, has its own unique language and culture, and along with that, one of the most distinctive cuisines in this part of the subcontinent. It’s a cuisine that developed in a space that is home to the merging of farms and forests, a unique landscape birthing an even more unique cuisine.\n\nThis is also why you’ll find that the farm/estate owning Kodavas would supplement their farm produce with locally available meat like wild pig, wild fowl, and bounties from the forest like wild yam, bamboo and colocasia leaves. To name just a few. Animals were rarely reared for the purpose of consumption, and hardly any vegetables needed to be farmed. It really was taking what was freely and abundantly provided by the lush surroundings, all native to the land.\n\nOf course, with the advent of the 21st century and commercialisation, that has changed. But it is striking how organic the Kodavas’ relationship with eating and cooking continues to be. Retaining that unique flavour of its key ingredients has been the identifying factor of authentic Kodava cuisine. Practices like letting the bamboo shoots take on flavour by souring in their own water, and using fat just to temper food, all contribute to this distinct nature. As a result of taking what is available from the lands around, a lot of the Kodava cuisine is also heavily influenced by the changing seasons.\n\nThere are harvest festivals for the worship of the river goddess Kaveri, and also festivals around the plucking of a wild leaf called ​madd toppu ​(literally translating to medicinal leaf) which blooms for a very specific period in August. The water that this leaf is boiled in, is further used to cook rice. The paste derived from this leaf is also used to preserve the meat, fight cholesterol, and get rid of some of the nasty ‘poochies’ (worms) that sometimes set up home inside pigs.​​It’s all extremely sustainable. Which might be in vogue now, but was being done by the Kodavas seemingly for centuries.\n\nMore such close ties with seasonal, local produce reveal themselves through dishes like the ​kuvale putt​, which is flesh of a jackfruit with broken rice, steamed in a banana leaf. Also in chutneys from the region, like one made from ​kaipuli​(a wild, bitter orange) or even one with jackfruit seeds, boiled and mixed with coconut and lime.Speaking of fruits and going local, another unique ingredient that you will find in most Kodava households is ​kachampuli​, extracted from the ripe fruits of the Kodambuli fruit, known to accentuate the flavour of the meat and most famously known for its use in the legendary ​pandi curry​.\n\nPandi Curry​ is probably the first dish you associate with Kodava cuisine, and what makes this dish that much more special ​are the local spices added to it—pepper, coriander and cumin to name a few— that are toasted and ground, giving the dish its distinct rich flavour. The more you sample Kodava cuisine, the more you realise that the centrepiece of their cuisine is meat, supplemented by rice.(​Quick trivia time: Coffee was a largely British-introduced enterprise, before which it was all about rice.)\n\nSome of the eating habits are also explained by these earlier cultivation patterns. Since rice was huge back in the day, the paddy fields needed protection from predators like wild boars, which were often shot down and then eaten. Not for the purpose of game or just for consumption. It might have evolved into that over time, but the original idea was to protect the crops and also to consume what was killed, indicative again of a very sustainable form of consumption."
