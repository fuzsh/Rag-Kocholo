        "text": "Welcome to The Storied Recipe, a podcast about food, culture, and love!\n\nMy podcast guest, Suwanee Lennon, introduced me to her Hot and Spicy Ramen Noodle Recipe in her episode, \"We Were Not Leprosy\" about her childhood living in a Thai leprosy camp. Make sure you listen to her story while you choose your add-ins and make your very own gourmet noodle bowl from a humble package of instant ramen noodles!\n\nTip: To see all 79 ideas in a quick list form, hit \"Jump to Recipe\".\n\nAn artfully made bowl of instant ramen noodles is the ultimate in quick, cheap, and creative comfort food. Even if you're a novice cook on a limited budget, you can make a healthy and elevated meal with nothing more than a package of noodles and a few leftovers.\n\nThere are endless ways to transform a package of cheap instant noodles into personalized, gourmet ramen noodle bowls for a quick and nutritious meal anytime. Making fancy ramen is a lot more about knowledge than skill - and you just need to know this one thing:\n\nStep One: Hit the Notes\n\nTo expertly elevate your noodle bowl, you just need to hit a note in each of 4 categories. I've organized the list below by these four categories.\n\nSpicy\n\nSweet\n\nSour (and/or Acidic)\n\nSalty (and/or Umami)\n\nI guarantee you have some of each in your pantry!\n\nStep Two: Choose Your Add-ins\n\nThen, to make a complete and healthy meal, add things from these 5 categories.\n\nProteins\n\nVegetables\n\nLeafy greens\n\nCrunchy\n\nCreamy\n\nMix and match the add-ins to YOUR liking - it's impossible to go wrong! P.S. If you're not the mix and match type, you can check out this post: How to Make Instant Ramen: 37 Best Recipes Around the World.\n\nThe Toppings\n\nSpicy\n\nEvery good ramen has a little kick of heat. Add to your preference!\n\nRaw ginger\n\nThai chili flakes\n\nShichimi Togarashi - Japanese blend of chili peppers, orange peel, and other seasonings\n\nVegan Chili Oil Sauce with Sichuan Peppers\n\nDried Japones Peppers\n\nJalapeno Peppers\n\nHot sauce\n\nGochujang (Red chili paste)\n\nTraditional Korean Kimchi\n\nSpicy Shaoxing Chinese Cooking Wine\n\nSweet\n\nThis can easily be overdone, so use a measured hand. But a good bowl of ramen will have just a little hint of sweet. My favorite? - #2 Kecap Manis!\n\nHoisin sauce\n\nKecap Manis (Indonesian Soy Sauce)\n\nBrown Sugar\n\nBanchun's Original Japanese BBQ Sauce\n\nMirin (Sweet Japanese Cooking Wine)\n\nSour/Tangy\n\nIf you're American, like me, you may not have trained your sour palate. But any Asian cook will tell you - sour is imperative to a good dish.\n\nLime juice\n\nRice wine vinegar\n\nPickled vegetables\n\nTamarind paste\n\nLemongrass\n\nPlum powder\n\nYuzu juice (or powder or paste)\n\nSalty or Umami Flavor\n\nA flavorful broth always has a salt or umami flavor - or, preferably, both. (Salty is not the same as umami, but American palates often conflate the two. Read more about umami flavors here.)\n\nNori (seaweed)\n\nSoy sauce\n\nSesame oil\n\nFish sauce\n\nOyster sauce\n\nMiso paste\n\nWhite fish paste\n\nBlack garlic oil\n\nRed pepper paste\n\nCrunchy\n\nTop your hot noodle soup with one or more of these crunchy toppings - or feel free to add your own and let me know what you chose!\n\nSesame seeds\n\nFresh green onions\n\nBonito Flakes\n\nCrispy fried onions\n\nSambal Crunchy Fried Shrimp\n\nChopped peanuts\n\nBroth\n\nThe easiest and quickest way to bring your ramen to the next level is use broth instead of water. Careful - if you choose a commercial (rather than homemade) broth, it's likely to have a lot of salt (even the low sodium varieties!). Consider going with a homemade ramen seasoning made by mixing elements from the lists below rather than the packet, which will also be crammed with sodium.\n\nVegetable Broth (or Mushroom Broth)\n\nChicken broth\n\nBeef broth\n\nSeafood broth\n\nCreamy\n\nTruthfully, creamy isn't really the goal of ramen noodle bowls. However, more and more creamy ramen recipes are filling the internet and social media, so I decided to include a few ideas here, if that's what you're going for. You can find of the best recipes here.\n\nPeanut butter\n\nCoconut Milk\n\nTahini sauce (in Japanese style bowls)\n\nKewpie Mayo\n\nProteins\n\nTurn this into a filling meal with eggs, meat, or plant-based protein. A little goes a long way!\n\nBeautiful Narutomaki (Fish paste)\n\nCrab sticks (also made from fish paste)\n\nSoft-boiled egg (4-5 minutes)\n\nHard-boiled egg (up to 10 minutes)\n\nPoached, scrambled, or fried egg\n\nPork belly\n\nChicken breast / Chicken thigh\n\nShrimp\n\nTofu\n\nBlack lentils\n\nMongolian beef\n\nGround beef, turkey, or pork\n\nChicken - thinly sliced breasts or grilled thighs\n\nLeafy Greens (and Fresh Herbs)\n\nGo crazy shopping for Asian greens in H Mart or your local Asian grocery stores! Here are a few of my favorites:\n\nBaby bok choy\n\nPak choi\n\nMustard Greens\n\nBroccolini\n\nSpinach\n\nCilantro\n\nNapa Cabbage\n\nWatercress\n\nFresh Vegetables\n\nEach and every one of these will add lots of nutrients and micronutrients to your personalized ramen bowl. Go crazy!\n\nBean sprouts\n\nRadishes\n\nBamboo shoots\n\nBell pepper\n\nGreen beans\n\nMushrooms\n\nCherry tomatoes\n\nCorn\n\nCarrots - cut into matchsticks or juliianned\n\nCelery\n\nSnow peas/Snap peas\n\nLotus root - for an eye-catching display plus nutrients\n\nSuper huge hurry? - Pop in a 1/2 cup of frozen veggies and let the boiling water cook them\n\nThanks for reading! What's YOUR favorite Ramen Add-In? Tell us and I'll add it into the list!!\n\nListen to Suwanee's Episode: \"We Were Not Leprosy\"\n\nFollow The Storied Recipe in Your Favorite Player"
