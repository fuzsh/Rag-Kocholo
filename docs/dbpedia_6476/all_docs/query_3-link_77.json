        "text": "With life so hectic and always full of responsibilities, how do you make it exciting? For the Cauldron Sisters – Ratzz & Ritzz – there are only two options. Food and travel. We love to explore our limits whether it’s about trying and coming up with unique recipes or traveling to new destinations and exploring various cultures.\n\nThis March, I (Ratzz) decided to visit the land of Kodagu a.k.a Coorg in Karnataka with my husband, Rahul, and our 6-year-old son, Tanay.\n\nIt was a long pending activity on my bucket-list to understand and adapt the concept of slow-living at the Evolve Back Chikkana Halli Estate, Coorg (earlier known as Orange County Hotel), and while at it, learn a little about the local Kodava culture.\n\nDid you know this Hindu South-Indian community doesn’t believe in many common Hindu customs, especially the ones related to spirituality? For example, they don’t have Brahmin priests (Pandits), the Fire God is not worshipped here, and the usage of Shlokas and Vedic chants is also missing.\n\nNow before I begin telling you about my family’s stay at Evolve Back, let me quickly take you to a short tour of this majestic land’s history. According to the ancient Indian treatises, this place was initially called Krodadesa which later became Kodavu (Coorg). It is also said that Kodagu is derived from the word Kodava. ‘Kod’ means ‘give’ and ‘avva’ means ‘mother’, with the reference being to Mother Cauvery, one of the seven sacred rivers of India.\n\nCoorg is superrich when it comes to the abundant gifts it’s gotten by Mother Nature. From plentiful water to fertile soil, it has it all. In 1834, a Coorg General named Apparanda Bopanna, invited the British forces under Col. Fraser into the kingdom. This led to the British fondly cultivating coffee, spices (Pepper, Cloves, Cardamom, Kokum, Cinchona, etc.), and rubber on the rich soil of Coorg.\n\nNow the kind of coffee that Coorg has since been producing is one of the best in the world. For example, Arabicas and Robustas. Coffee, here, is grown during the monsoon season under the shade of giant trees of Rose Wood, Wild Fig and Jack Fruit. It is in February that the coffee blossoms appear, while in November, these flowers turn into red cherry-like fruits.\n\nTalking about this property of Evolve Back, we were told that it was purchased by Mr. Ramapuram, the great-grandfather of the current Owners, back in 1924 from a British landowner to grow coffee and rubber for commercial usage. It was only in 1994 that the luxury hotel called Orange County Resort with only 10 cottages was started on the same land to invite people from all over. Today, the property has 63 cottages in total.\n\nEnveloped by greenery, this 100-year-old resort is spread in 300-acre long land, that grows its own famous Coorg coffee beans. Today, however, the space earths not just coffee but also rubber, various seasonal fruits, vegetables, and spices along with the very beautiful ornamental flower Anthurium.\n\nOh, and don’t miss this tree planted by Mr. Rajnikanth.\n\nI, in particular, was excited about the coffee-cultivation, and so, when we got the news that the hotel has arranged a tour for us to their coffee fields, I seemingly appeared happier than Tanay. In fact, it is every day that the hotel arranges complimentary activities like plantation tour, bird-watching, nature walks, coffee-tasting, etc. for its guests.\n\nYou know what else was on the house? The mini bar with home-grown and homemade cashews, banana chips, fruit chaat, etc. *wink-wink* BTW, you can read all about their very own coffee-tasting museum on our blog here!\n\nMoving on, shall we discuss how stunning and comfy our Heritage Pool Villa was?\n\nMade with the precision of the Kodava architecture, it was surrounded with a variety of plants but our favorite was the view of this huge jackfruit tree residing right outside our bedroom window.\n\nWe made the most of our stay here as the three of us spent quality time in and around the 2 sit-out areas in our cottage. Did I mention how much Tanay loved their temperature-control swimming pool and absolutely refused to come out of it? Taking inspiration from him, even my hubster’s self-time was spent in our life-size jacuzzi as he sipped on some fine red wine. Like son, like father!? Ha-ha!\n\nWondering what I was up to the whole time? Relishing my quiet moments away at the hotel’s ‘Abhyanga’ massage service. You’ll definitely be needing this after that 6-hour road trip from Bangaluru to Coorg.\n\nAs I mentioned, Evolve Back changed its name from Orange County after the Owners decided to propose the concept of slow-living to the Indian market. Their mission is to encourage people towards leading a sustainable life, in harmony with nature. This is one of the reasons why plastic is strictly not allowed in the premises of Evolve Back.\n\nBefore putting a full-stop this travel blog, I really want to appreciate the staff at Evolve Back. Extremely warm and courteous, they paid extra attention to curating all our meals – be it a delicacy from the North-Indian and South-Indian menu, or, for that matter, something totally Continental.\n\nSigh. It’s about time I get away from my computer screen and open the cute little coffee bean bags they handed us over before we checked out. Byeeeee!"
