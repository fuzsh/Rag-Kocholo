        "text": "This paper draws from the idea that acts of naming have constantly changed and that practices of naming need to be located in a larger network of practices and histories that to various extent determine a community’s changing notions of identity. I explore these changing notions of identity as performed through acts of naming among the Kodavas, an ethno-linguistic minority group from the Kodagu district, Karnataka State, India. My objective in this paper is to look at naming from three perspectives, constantly interacting with each other. I study naming from three different temporal locations, as informed by various factors. Firstly, what one might tenuously call as conventional naming practices among the Kodavas. Secondly, how these practices were affected by acts of legibility brought in through colonial intervention and thirdly, the gradual but perceptible shifts in contemporary naming practices that negotiate between legibility of a modern nation, legibility of a majoritarian Hindupractice and of a desired Kodava identity. My analysis points to fluidity of practices that can be termed ‘illegible’ to dominant practices thereby asserting identity in creative ways. Illegibility, I argue, makes identities unstable, less knowable and thereby not easy to contain\n\nThree styles of personal names are attested for the Meithei (Tibeto-Burman, Manipur State in northeast India): a native-Meithei style, a Hindu style introduced with the eighteenth-century adoption of Hinduism by the Meithei, and a \"resistance\" style typified by previously unattested structures and clan names. This article shows that those who espouse a clean break with Indian political and religious hegemony use resistance-style names, whereas those who favor strengthened ties between Manipur and India, while still cherishing pre-Hindu identity, move fluidly between use of Hindu and resistance-style names.\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea which sought a direction to the Central government to amend the constitution to change the official name of the country from India to Bharat. This plea claimed that \"the removal of the English name, though appears symbolic, will instill a sense of pride in our nationality, especially for the future generations. In fact, replacing India with Bharat would justify the hard-fought freedom achieved by our ancestors.” The petitioner demands that we have to recognize our country from our cultural legacy and this would be a great tribute to national fighters who fought for the freedom of this country. The politics of naming is not a new phenomenon because the ruling BJP led NDA government has only one agenda of imposing hegemony of Hindutva culture through the politics of renaming of cities, railway stations and welfare schemes. This article attempts to explain the politics of naming through two theoretical concepts which were propounded by Ernest Gellner and Anthony D Smith.\n\nThis article explores the cosmological entailments of a minor verbal taboo in Mayong (Central Assam). In brief, individuals who share personal names are forbidden from addressing or referring to each other by name, and instead must interpellate each other as mita (friend). Through an analysis of names in acts of sorcery and magic, a baptism ceremonial, and nominal modes of address in Mayong, this article demonstrates how confronting a person with a shared name is tantamount to confronting one’s own singular destiny in another body and another time. Alongside an ethnographic theorization of taboo that bridges the unmentionable and untouchable divide, this article further demonstrates how the euphemistic norm of address between name sharers reframes the distinction between kinship and friendship as a matter of with whom one can and should share a mutual destiny."
