        "text": "THE HUDSUCKER PROXY premiered at Sundance, and then went on to screen in competition at Cannes, ultimately losing the prestigious Palm d’Or to their insurgent generational peer, Quentin Tarantino, and his second feature, PULP FICTION. Like MILLER’S CROSSING and BARTON FINK before it, the film premiered with a resounding flop at the box office.\n\nCritics appreciated the unique visuals and the bold risks undertaken, but they deemed the element most lacking was the human element, and thus embraced the film only at arm’s length. The culminating chapter in the Coens’ triptych of postmodern period pictures, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY has proved itself to be one of their most fantastical and imaginative films, and has gathered a devoted following of its own on home video.\n\nWhile their first mainstream studio effort might not have met their expectations, the Coens had laid the necessary groundwork to begin a new phase in their career­­ one that would see their fan base grow exponentially, along with their stature amongst the pantheon of great contemporary directors.\n\nFARGO (1996)\n\nIn 1996, directors Joel and Ethan Coen achieved their first mainstream success story with a project that would take them back to their homeland: the snow­ covered sprawl of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Their quirky blend of humor and violence had evolved through their previous films, coalescing into an artistic persona that tapped directly into the cultural zeitgeist of the Clinton era.\n\nThey collected a mix of sensational crime stories and urban legends from around the area, and threw them together into the proverbial wood chipper to create an undeniable masterpiece of atmosphere, tension, and pitch­ black comedy called FARGO.\n\nTHE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998)\n\nO BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000)\n\nIt was around the year 2000 when I started really becoming cognizant of cinema as a cultural phenomenon. Sure, I knew everyone liked movies, and many of them liked the same movies I did, but at the age of 14 I was growing more aware of a world of cinema outside my own perception. A small film I had never heard of before, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? was released that year and caused a modest sensation. One of my school teachers even used the film’s soundtrack to show us examples of historical folk songs like Harry McClintock’s “Big Rock Candy Mountain”.\n\nEverywhere I went, everyone seemed to be talking about the film and its now-legendary soundtrack. I had no clue who the Coen Brothers were at the time, and I wasn’t particularly moved to see the film until much later, when I was in college.\n\nSeven features into their career, Joel and Ethan had managed to to carve out their own distinctive sub-genre of films– an aesthetic marked not by an immediately identifiable visual style, but by a sardonically playful approach to story and character. Music served a major purpose in that regard, often acting as a subtextual thematic device but not yet as part of the narrative itself.\n\nAs the world celebrated the dawn of the 21st century, the Coens embraced their growing reputation as cinematic stewards of the American musical tradition by looking back on the early years of the 20th– specifically, the Mississippi Delta during the height of the Great Depression. Their eighth feature– O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?– would borrow so heavily from the structural framework of Homer’s ancient epic “The Odyssey” that Homer himself is given a co-writing credit in its telling of the story of three escaped convicts using the popularity of dustbowl folk music to seek treasure and return home to their families.\n\nReleased by their frequent production collaborators Working Title Films in the year 2000, O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? marks another significant hit in the Coens’ filmography– one that, like THE BIG LEBOWSKI before it– would send ripples through the fabric of American pop culture itself.\n\nTaking its title from the movie-within-a-movie in Preston Sturge’s SULLIVAN’S TRAVELS– the latest bit of inspiration the Coens have taken from that particular film throughout their filmography, O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? finds the brothers working with Hollywood megastar George Clooney for the first time.\n\nClooney plays Everrit McGill, a slick and conniving con-man with an unhealthy affection for pomade. As the Depression-era stand-in for THE ODYSSEY’s Ulysses, Clooney has the unenviable task of embodying the film’s heart and soul, but in his efforts he manages to find a special kinship with the Coens’ distinct worldview– kicking off a string of buffoonish Coen rascals that deliberately play against his polished, leading-man image.\n\nCoen regulars John Turturro and John Goodman appear as Everritt’s right-hand man, Pete Hogwallop, and the treacherous cyclops bible salesman named Big Dan Teague, respectively. Both men are entirely comfortable within the Coens’ quirky style of filmmaking, and channel it into larger-than-life performances.\n\nNeither man finds in their role a career-best or particularly memorable persona, but both give the entirety of themselves over to the brothers’ idiosyncratic vision. Rounding out the central trio of escaped convicts is seasoned character actor Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar O’Donnell. To date, this is his only appearance in a Coen Brothers film, somewhat of an oddity given the brothers’ propensity for re-using talent.\n\nA few other familiar Coen faces emerge, including Charles Durning and Holly Hunter. Durning, who played the titular suicidal CEO in the THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, assumes the affectation of a bloated, aristocratic dandy in his portrayal of craven bureaucrat Pappy O’Daniel.\n\nO’Daniel is a broad stroke of a character, relying on our recognizance of the “desperate-for-votes incumbent politician who’s up for re-election” archetype, but Durning nevertheless makes the role his own. Holly Hunter, who hasn’t been seen in a Coen film since 1987’s RAISING ARIZONA, has a relatively small role here as Penny, Everritt’s estranged wife.\n\nFrom the first frame on, O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? immediately distinguishes itself as one of the Coens’ most visually-stylized films to date. The dawning of the new millennium brought with it major advances in digital filmmaking technology, and while the film was shot on old-fashioned 35mm celluloid, its cinematography nevertheless achieves one of the earliest distinctions of the digital age– the first American motion picture to be color-timed and mastered via a digital intermediate.\n\nThe process of scanning film into digital files that can be endlessly manipulated and stored is commonplace now, but O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?’s adoption of DI technology was, at the time, truly unprecedented. This choice allowed the Coens and their cinematographer Roger Deakins full control over the color grading of the image, which takes on a washed-out, gold & tobacco patina after they were able to isolate and reduce the saturation of blues and greens.\n\nThis earthy, impressionistic color palette recalls the monochromatic texture of old photographs from the era, while their first-time use of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio makes for wider, inherently-cinematic compositions. Energetic camerawork proudly shows off returning production designer Dennis Gassner’s authentic, well-worn patina, which evokes the cracked, warbly texture of the gospel folk tunes that inform the film’s musical soul.\n\nLeaving a legacy arguably larger than O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU’s cinematography– at least in the eyes of the public– is the soundtrack. Returning musical team Carter Burwell and T-Bone Burnett’s eclectic musical palette provides a brief, yet sprawling survey of Depression-era American folk music while also singlehandedly kick starting a popular resurgence in contemporary pop.\n\nIndeed, Harry McClintock’s hobo anthem “Big Rock Candy Mountain” probably hadn’t been enjoyed at this wide a scale since the Great Depression. The inspired mix of blues, religious hymnals, Appalachian mountain folk and bluegrass drives the film with a lyrical, rollicking energy that reinforces the film’s central theme of music being an agent of personal redemption.\n\nThe soundtrack proved so popular upon the film’s release that it’s said to have surpassed the success of the film itself, selling five million copies in its first year and earning five Grammys.\n\nO BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? deals in many themes and ideas that the brothers had explored to varying effect in previous films, putting a particular emphasis on references to the bible. The characters’ spirituality and remarks on scripture are naturally incorporated into the story, thanks to the evangelical ideology that sculpts the social landscape of the Mississippi Delta.\n\nThe outsider perspective that guides the Coens’ work is also present here in its portrait of three escaped inmates on the run and ostracized by society at large. The characters that inhabit this world belong mostly to the common class, a demographic predisposed to lionizing Everett and his gang as folk heroes, out to stick it to fat-cat bureaucrats and expose the absurdity and wastefulness of the concentrated pockets of wealth that dot the Delta.\n\nThe Coens never let the proceedings get too serious, subverting the weight of the central quest narrative at every turn with exaggerated minor characters and old-fashioned slapstick humor.\n\nO BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, which by now had become almost standard procedure for the release of a new Coen Brothers film. Save for one notable exception in Roger Ebert, the film received warm reviews from critics who appreciated the brothers’ effortless transition into an epic story scope, as well as their pioneering use of digital intermediate technology and realistic implementation of computer-generated imagery.\n\nMost of all, they simply appreciated how fun it all was, and their praise helped propel the film t0 sleeper-hit status at the box office, earning back almost triple of its $26 million production budget. The film received two Oscar nominations– one for Joel and Ethan’s creative adaptation of Homer’s epic poem, and the other for Deakins’ cinematography. The mainstream success of O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? is evidence of the Coens hitting their stride, having delivered yet another bonafide masterpiece to their already impressive body of work.\n\nTHE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE (2001)\n\nThe success of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? propelled the Coen Brothers into the hearts of Middle America, broadening their fanbase considerably. So how did they capitalize on this large, captive audience? By making a small, black-and-white murder noir that would alienate those heartland sensibilities entirely. But such is life with the Coens– their body of work is an exercise in contradictions and winking in-jokes made at the audience’s expense.\n\nInitially inspired by a prop poster of 1940’s haircuts on the set of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, Joel and Ethan expanded the idea into an acutely sardonic meditation on mid-century American values and suburban malaise titled THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE. Their ninth feature finds the celebrated filmmaking partners consolidating their tragicomic strengths while further exploring a highly-stylized visual aesthetic, making another postmodern bid to recontextualize the iconography of the past for contemporary storytelling tastes.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton makes the most of one of his rare leading turns as the laconic, calculating barber at the center of the story, Ed Crane. He narrates the film with a disaffected, almost-clinical temperament that highlights the Coens’ morbid sense of humor. Joel Coen’s real-life wife and frequent leading lady, Frances McDormand, turns in a memorable performance as Crane’s unfaithful spouse, Doris.\n\nIt’s a much more unsavory role for McDormand, and it’s a testament to her diverse range that she can effortlessly transition to the other side of the bars after her last performance in FARGO as the kindly police officer, Marge Gunderson. As the philandering department store owner, Big Dave Brewster, James Gandolfini simultaneously eschews his tough-guy Tony Soprano persona while subtly embracing it. He’s the alpha male, the biggest figure in his small town.\n\nEvery noir needs the arrogant sucker character, and Big Dave fills that role in unexpected ways. Longtime Coen mainstay Jon Polito has a substantial role here as Creighton Tulliver, a street-smart huckster with an ill-fitting suit and a worse-fitting toupee. Polito throws his considerable weight around in his energetic performance of a shady get-rich-quick schemer who regards dry-cleaning technology as the second coming of Christ.\n\nThe film’s supporting cast boasts several famous faces who have already made or are making the first of several appearances in the Coens’ filmography. Scarlett Johansson, looking almost child-like in one of her earliest roles, plays Birdy Abundas, an inquisitive young girl with a talent for music and a hidden sexuality beyond her years. Her innocence here contrasts quite dramatically with the character she’d play fifteen years later in 2016’s HAIL, CAESAR!.\n\nWell-respected character actor Richard Jenkins also delivers his first performance for the Coens as Birdy’s bookish father, Walter. He shares an easy friendship with Crane, although he’s blind to his friend’s burgeoning inclinations towards his daughter. Tony Shalhoub, in his second Coen outing since BARTON FINK ten years earlier, steals the show as Sacramento’s quote/unquoted “best” lawyer, Freddy Riedenschneider. His character sucks all the air out of the room with a rapid-fire verbosity, which counters rather neatly with Crane’s silent brooding.\n\nFinally Michael Badalucco, who played Pretty Boy Floyd in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? appears again here as Crane’s portly brother in law and fellow barber, Frank. All in all, the performances are perfectly serviceable and believable, if not particularly memorable.\n\nThe Coens’ regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, earned his second consecutive Oscar nomination for his work on THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE. While O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? fully embraced the freedoms of digital intermediate technology, this time the Coens turned to conventional laboratory processing techniques to achieve their highly stylized look. The 35mm film stock was shot in color, but printed in stark black and white to achieve the evocative silver screen look we associate with classic film noir.\n\nHis lighting setup complements this old-fashioned approach, favoring a moody, high-contrast aesthetic. Black and white film represents a kind of purity when it comes to exposure, because when a cinematographer doesn’t have to deal with traditional chroma concerns, he or she is free to literally paint with pure light. Deakins knows this well, and artfully uses light and shadow to distinguish the various gradations of grey for a compelling look.\n\nTHE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE seems like a film out of its time, because it is– the Coens and Deakins limited themselves to the common filmmaking techniques of Hollywood’s Golden Age: the stylized silhouettes of the noir genre, the 1.85:1 Academy aspect ratio, and classical dolly-based camera movement. The Coens and Deakins have crafted a nightmare of a Norman Rockwell painting, fleshed out by returning production designer Dennis Gassner’s authentic period designs.\n\nThis sense of melancholy timelessness extends to an appropriately classical bed of music characterized predominantly by piano and the violin. The Coens supplement longtime composer Carter Burwell’s nostalgic, bittersweet score with sourced opera tracks and various Beethoven compositions like “Moonlight Sonata” to imbue their portrait of suburban malaise with a classical universality.\n\nWhile the Coens go to great lengths to meticulously recreate the cinematic conventions of Eisenhower-era Hollywood, their signature thematic conceits infuse THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE with a decidedly modern sensibility. The detached, hard-boiled voiceover is a defining characteristic of the noir genre– a trope that the Coens subvert with their sardonic comic worldview, which is able to see humor in our darkest moments thanks to a degree 0f psychological remove from the immediate actions onscreen.\n\nThis outside perspective fundamentally informs every aspect of THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE, right down to the title. Like so many Coen protagonists, Ed Crane is a man at odds against his own environment. He’s set apart from the flow of life around him, giving him an elevated perspective that makes clear the idea that the trappings of modern life are ultimately a distraction.\n\nHe nihilistically sits back and watches the ceaseless parade of mid-century Americana and small-town culture: images of barbershops, churches, department stores, pulp magazines, and even flying saucers serve as diversionary constructs that distract the characters from the fact that one day this will all come to an end. Even Crane’s narration is ultimately revealed to be meaningless, the product of a writing prompt for a men’s magazine he performs while on death row, paid by the word with money that he’ll never actually get to use.\n\nThis isn’t to say that the film itself is nihilistic– indeed, as he sits on the electric chair his narration expresses hope that he’ll be reunited with Doris in the afterlife. It’s only another layer upon multitudes of contradictory sentiments that reinforce the Coens’ love of confounding anyone who tries to take their films too seriously.\n\nTHE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE met with modest success upon its release, earning warm applause from audiences and critics alike. It earned the Best Director award at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, which it shared with David Lynch’s mystifying masterwork, MULHOLLAND DRIVE. While it hasn’t gained the kind of cult following enjoyed by works like THE BIG LEBOWSKI, the quality of the Coens’ craft holds up with a sense of timelessness that ensures its longevity.\n\nTogether, these two films are indicative of an industry acquainting itself with the possibilities of breakthroughs in digital technology, figuring out how to use a suite of new and exciting tools. By placing themselves at the forefront of this adoption, the Coens have made the old new again– making the past come alive in a tactile, impressionistic way that, for the most part, had never been seen before.\n\nO BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? is, without a doubt, the more influential film of the two, having ushered in an age of radical color timing and abstract palettes, but THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE stands strongly on its own merits, having carved out a space for itself as another cult classic within the brothers’ filmography. Most importantly, this pair of old-fashioned works set the stage for a new act in the Coens’ career– one that would see them soar to ever-greater heights while cementing their legacy as the preeminent chroniclers of the darkly absurd.\n\nINTOLERABLE CRUELTY (2003)\n\nThe Coen Brothers are generally regarded as two of the finest living American filmmakers. Each of their films has been released to some modicum of critical acclaim and/or box office success. However, they are people like you and I, and are prone to mistakes. Every career has its mis-step, and the Coens’ tenth feature– 2003’s INTOLERABLE CRUELTY– is just that.\n\nDrawing inspiration from Howard Hawks romantic comedies like BRINGING UP BABY (1938), INTOLERABLE CRUELTYis an old-fashioned love romp cursed with a modern-day cynic’s attitude. Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a devilishly handsome and slick matrimony lawyer who’s built his career upon a foolproof prenuptial document of his own devising. He’s used to winning, and has the fancy car and huge Beverly Hills mansion to prove it.\n\nHe finally meets his match in the form of Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a woman who’s made a career out of marrying rich men and divorcing them for a hefty profit. As he represents Marilyn’s husband Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) in the divorce proceedings, Miles finds himself falling hard for the alluring wife. After a brief barely-romance, Miles and Marilyn marry in a Vegas drive-thru chapel. But is it true love, or is Miles just another target in Marilyn’s treacherous scheme?\n\nThe film’s performances draw heavily from the slapstick romantic comedies of yore. Clooney and Zeta-Jones’ chemistry plays like a forgotten James Stewart/Katherine Hepburn film, yet despite their best efforts, the film doesn’t quite pull it off. In his second Coen outing, Clooney lampoons his suave, star persona quite well. His vanity is manifested in physical traits like obsessively checking his teeth, a recurring joke that is one of the movie’s more brilliant aspects.\n\nIt’s clear that he’s having a lot of fun, and his enjoyment is infectious. As the shrewd, calculating Marilyn, Zeta-Jones is a worthy adversary to Clooney’s charms. The role requires someone with effortless grace, beauty, and sexuality– all of which Zeta-Jones possesses in spades. It’s a serviceable performance, if only because the role itself doesn’t require much in the way of involved acting ability. For what the film is and what it aspires to be, the casting of the two leads is pitch perfect.\n\nThe supporting cast allows the chance for the Coens to trot out their signature outsized characters. Billy Bob Thornton, who last starred for the Coens in their previous film (2001’s THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE) plays Howard Doyle, a Texan oil baron and one sucker in a long line of them competing for Marilyn’s fake affections. His role is the polar opposite to his laconic, nearly-mute barber in THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE, a casting technique that the Coens are fond of (see the dichotomy between Steve Buscemi’s roles in FARGO (1996) and THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998).\n\nGeoffrey Rush plays Donovan Donaly, a ponytailed television producer who goes on a wild shooting rampage when he comes home early to catch his wife in bed with the pool boy (which is odd because they have no pool). Rush embraces the full-tilt psychopath aspects of his unhinged character to considerable comedic effect, and is one of the standout performers in the film.\n\nCedric The Entertainer plays Gus Petch, a private investigator specializing in philandering husbands. His catchprase, “I’m gonna nail yo’ ass”, is invoked in almost every other line. It’s an energetic, memorable performance, but I don’t know if you can really call it a performance when Cedric The Entertainer is essentially just being himself.\n\nRichard Jenkins, who appeared alongside Thornton for the Coens in THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE, shows an unexpected knack for comedic timing in his depiction of Freddy Bender, Marilyn’s impotent and perpetually-aggravated lawyer.\n\nA few other Coen cameos clue us in that INTOLERABLE CRUELTY exists within their winking, self-contained universe: Bruce Campbell appears as a surgeon on a television screen and the man who plays Mortimer Young (of the infamously fictional Forever Young film preservation society concocted by the Coens as a skewering of pretentious cinephiles) makes his first in-film appearance for the Coens as a curmudgeonly lawyer.\n\nINTOLERABLE CRUELTY conscripts regular Coen cinematographer Roger Deakins into service once again. Shooting on 35mm film, Deakins evokes the bright, cheery visuals of romantic comedies past. The sun-dappled environs of Los Angeles and Las Vegas are rendered within the 1.85:1 frame with warm color tones and a high-key/somewhat overlit lighting scheme.\n\nThe film makes extensive use of handheld cinematography in the opening sequence, while opting for a more traditional locked-off/dolly/crane scheme for the remaining scenes. It hurts me to say this, but this is perhaps Deakins’ worst-looking film. That’s not to say it looks bad, but only that it is uncharacteristically bland and pedestrian. It gets the job done, but I’m sure Deakins won’t be putting it in the proverbial reel anytime soon.\n\nThis time around, the Coens swap their usual production designer, Dennis Gassner, for Leslie McDonald. McDonald does a commendable job recreating the privileged lifestyles of Los Angeles’ elite, imbuing the film with a stuffy old-money sensibility. Her work is not unimpressive, but neither is it impressive. It, like most of the movie, is bland, middle-of-the-road journeyman stuff. Hardly the eccentric, nuanced design we’ve come to expect from a Coen Brothers film.\n\nCarter Burwell returns to score the film, utilizing a brassy, big-band sound that further alludes to Hollywood Golden Age comedies. His music is accompanied by a generic mix of folk rock offered up by the likes of Simon & Garfunkel. It makes the film more enjoyable, to be sure, but it rarely makes for a transcendent experience.\n\nThere is one instance of what seems to be genuine inspiration here: the Monty Python-esque opening credits that animate Victorian paintings of Cupid and couples in love. However, it’s not enough to save the film from its lackluster execution. Many signature Coen conceits are present, like their fondness for Buster Keaton-style slapstick.\n\nTheir dark sense of humor is also incorporated, but to substantially diluted effect. The whole thing seems to have the stink of big studio meddling about it, from well-known producers like Brian Grazer and Grant Heslov on the payroll, on down to a screenplay in which the Coens had to share credit with no less than three other writers.\n\nConsidering the strength of their earlier films, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is a major disappointment. It seems that I wasn’t alone in my thinking– the film bombed upon its release and was not warmly received by critics. I don’t know if the Coens just weren’t trying this particular go-round, but something is very noticeably off about their execution.\n\nTen years after its release, it’s been all but forgotten– denied even a small cult following like the ones that cropped up around many of their other lesser films. Every filmmaker has a mis-step in his/her career, but because this is the Coen Brothers we’re talking about, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is a nearly-unforgivable transgression by virtue of its indifference– arguably the biggest filmmaking sin of them all.\n\nTHE LADYKILLERS (2004)\n\nI had never seen Joel and Ethan Coen’s 2004 feature, THE LADYKILLERS, until only recently. However, funnily enough, I do remember its release. I remember seeing posters for the film displayed at Pioneer Place mall in downtown Portland, OR, which had a theatre that I frequented in those days. I distinctly recall being wholly uninterested in the film, an impression that barred me from seeing it until a few days ago– nearly ten years later.\n\nI was expecting a creatively indifferent dud like their previous film, 2003’s INTOLERABLE CRUELTY. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the film’s humble charms and it’s picturesque Mississippi setting. It’s certainly not one of the Coens’ great films, but it is an unexpectedly entertaining effort that plays like a hayseed version of OCEAN’S 11.\n\nMarva Munson (Irma P. Hall) is a wealthy widow and God-fearing Christian living in a small Mississippi town. One day, an eccentrically-dressed man named Professor Dorr (Tom Hanks) arrives at her doorstep, inquiring about her upstairs room for rent. He presents himself as a worldly, educated man and a member of a musical ensemble specializing in church music. He gains permission to live with Munson and have rehearsal with his band in her basement cellar, so as not to distract her during the evening.\n\nWhat he doesn’t tell her, however, is that his band is a front– together, his merry little group uses the basement to conspire and execute a daring heist of a ferryboat casino on the Mississippi River. The casino’s vault is located underground on the river bank, and Dorr’s master plan requires them to tunnel directly from underneath Munson’s house and into the vault.\n\nDorr and his men pull off the heist successfully, but their getaway is bungled when Munson discovers their haul and presents them with a choice: give the money back and go with her to church, or go to prison. In response, these bumbling thieves come up with their own response: kill kindly old Mrs. Munson.\n\nThe performances are energetic and suitable for the zany tone that the Coens are after. Tom Hanks clearly relishes the opportunity to ham it up, Coen-style. His Professor Dorr is a southern gentleman and a dandy with a bizarre, gulping nervous laugh. As the matronly Marva Munson, Irma P. Hall is endearing and sweet in her stubborn indignation.\n\nHer rants about the “hippity-hop” music are funny, and her conversations with the portrait of her long-dead husband are poignant. Despite her elderly stature, she’s a tough old broad that can stand her own against the basement full of criminals under her feet.\n\nDorr’s crew, haphazardly assembled from want ads he placed in the paper, is a veritable rogue’s gallery of clumsy fools. The standouts (Marlon Wayans, JK Simmons, and Tzi Ma) provide the film with its best comedic moments. Wayans, as the gangsta janitor of the boat casino, is the fiery, unpredictable inside man. It’s a little sad, after his bravua performance four years earlier in Darren Aronofsky’s REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, to see him revert to a cliched ‘hood archetype, but his knack for comedic timing transcends the role’s limitations.\n\nAs an animal wrangler/demolitions expert with chronic IBS, Simmons’ Garth Pancake makes full use of his particular cadence and body language. Simmons is known primarily as a comedic character actor, but here he gets to embrace a unique dynamic entirely apart from his best-known roles. And then there’s Tzi Ma, the mute Vietnamese shop owner known only as The General. He proved to by my favorite character in the film– his effortless slinking, tunneling, and cigarette-swallowing abilities are truly hilarious.\n\nThe fact that he gets the film’s biggest laughs without barely speaking is a testament to Ma’s physical talents.\n\nTHE LADYKILLERS is fairly light on the expected Coen cameos, but Bruce Campbell shows up briefly in a dog food commercial shoot. Stephen Root, who previously appeared up as the blind record label owner in O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000), makes his second Coen outing as the casino’s stern manager and Wayan’s boss. It’s a small role, but Root makes the best of his limited screentime.\n\nRoger Deakins returns as Director of Photography, crafting a gorgeous looking film from the Coens’ preferred 35mm, 1.85:1 shooting format. The film takes on a sepia-tinted hue, drawing from a murky palette of earth tones and bright colors. The camerawork is appropriately elaborate in proportion to the film’s comfortable budget, consisting of artful dolly and crane movements that add scale to the story. The Coens also utilize a brilliant POV camera shot from within a football player’s helmet during a chaotic game.\n\nMoments like this make it clear that THE LADYKILLERS is considerably more engaging subject matter to the Coens than INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, their uninspired previous film. Subsequently, Deakin’s work is markedly better as well.\n\nDennis Gassner reprises his Production Design duties as well, bringing an authentic, lived-in quality back to the Coen universe. He really brings out the Old World charm of the Deep South, making for an immersive experience. The languid pacing, courtesy of the Coens’ cutting alter-ego Roderick Jaynes, echoes the leisurely Southern mentality while bringing dynamic energy when it’s needed.\n\nCarter Burwell is again credited as crafting the score, but I barely noticed his efforts within the finished film. Instead, the story is peppered with a mix of blues, gospel, classical and hip-hop music– all chosen by the Coens’ frequent music supervisor T-Bone Burnett. The carefully chosen tracks do a great job in conveying a distinct culture and place, while giving the film a unique gospel-inspired patina.\n\nWhile it’s not as memorable a mix as the soundtrack to O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, the soundtrack is another great survey of Americana folk music.\n\nThe film is technically a remake of the 1955 of the same name, but the Coens bring enough of their quirky vision to the proceedings so that it stands on its own merits. It’s chock full of their signature gallows humor (sometimes quite literally), and the characters are well-drawn variations on unexpected archetypes.\n\nWhile it can still be considered one of their minor works, THE LADYKILLERS is far from their worst. Rather, it’s an underrated, enjoyable little surprise of a film– one that I suspect will respectably hold its own against the ravages of time.\n\nTUILERIES (2006)\n\nIn 2006, a film called PARIS, JE T’AIME premiered with a unique concept. It was an omnibus film, consisting of twenty separate shorts directed by twenty different directors. The common thread uniting them was that timeless city of light, Paris. It was well-received, spawning a series of similar anthology films built around a single city (New York, Rio, Jerusalem, etc…).\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen served as contributors to PARIS, JE T’AIME, ultimately creating one of the best shorts of the project. Their piece, entitled TUILERIES after the Parisian subway station, concerns an American tourist: Coen regular Steve Buscemi. He’s sitting in a station, waiting for his train and reading his tourism book. One passage encourages him never to make eye contact with others on the subway, which of course he does. He’s caught staring at a pair of young, hotheaded lovers (Axel Kiener and Julie Bataille), who begin accosting him belligerently.\n\nAs the young woman uses Buscemi to instill jealousy in her boyfriend, Buscemi quickly finds himself in over his head.\n\nThe short is no more than five minutes long, but the Coens are able to pack a great deal of their specific brand of comedy and quirk into the piece. They are able to effortlessly convey a complicated comedic scenario using only French dialogue (no subtitles) and Buscemi’s increasingly confused facial expressions. The action builds to a fever pitch, leading to the angry young Frenchman pouring Buscemi’s tourist trinkets all over him before waltzing off with his girl, their own relationship troubles seemingly forgotten.\n\nThe film is shot by Bruno Delbonnel, in a departure from the Coens’ usual cinematographer Roger Deakins. However, Delbonnel stays faithful to the Coens’ established look- 35mm fill framed with a 1.85:! aspect ratio, wide compositions interspersed with detailed close-ups, etc. The subterranean location is rendered in a saturated amber hue that’s romantic and wistful– a device that lulls Buscemi’s American tourist into a complacent state. Music is included via the diagetic presence of a street perfumer strumming a classical guitar tune.\n\nEven at its short length, the Coens’ distinct touch is immediately apparent. The shortform medium limitations and self-imposed dialogue restrictions on Buscemi’s part allows the Coens to really dig into what they do best: outlandish characters getting into absurd scenarios with unexpected results.\n\nTUILERIES is only the second short film the Coens have made to date (if you’re counting Joel’s student film SOUNDINGS), but it’s just as good as much of their feature work. It’s like those little bite-sized candy bars you get at Halloween, except instead of chocolate… it’s Coen.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007)\n\nThe year 2007 was a watershed year for me in regards to my development as a filmmaker. For starters, it marked ten full years that I had been making films– I was only eleven when I trained a video camera on my action figures and made a stop-motion movie with them. 2007 also saw the year I shot and completed THE ARCHITECT, my thesis film that would cap my studies at Emerson College. And finally, the top three films of the decade (a opinion shared by many besides myself) all debuted within a few months of each other during 2007.\n\nThese three films– David Fincher’s ZODIAC, Paul Thomas Anderson’s THERE WILL BE BLOOD, and Joel & Ethan Coen’s NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN– left an indelible mark on me, and have influenced and informed my work ever since. It was the closest that I felt modern-day Hollywood has ever gotten to my favorite era of cinema– the 1970’s– and the success of these films suggested the dawn of a new age of artfully-made films.\n\nSadly, this was not meant to be. Only a year later, the specialty studios that made these kind of prestige films– Warner Independent, Paramount Vantage, New Line, etc– would shutter, paving the way instead for the dominance of big-budget, rudderless spectacle films, remakes, sequels, and prequels. I had the pleasure of interning at Warner Independent Pictures in its closing days, and it was heartbreaking to see the house collapse in on itself.\n\nThe studio executives I worked with were the complete opposite of your archetypal Hollywood producer: they were unbelievably kind, had great taste in scripts, had little regard for the box office results of their work, and genuinely desired to create great movies. And in the great American tradition of capitalism, all their hard work was rewarded, not with bonus checks, but with pink slips.\n\nIt was a short, glorious era for filmmaking, and as a budding filmmaker who had recently made the big move to Los Angeles to finally start his career in earnest, it was an incredibly exciting time. Walking around the Warner Brothers lot on my lunch break, I felt like anything was possible.\n\nMy optimism was countered by the pessimistic nature of these three films. I once read somewhere that periods of war and controversial presidencies often influence pop culture to ask tough questions and reflect the somber view of reality. It was certainly true for the 1970’s, quagmired in Vietnam. It was also true for the Bush administration, which was losing two wars and slipping into the worst recession in nearly eighty years. For many, it seemed like the world was ending, and this pessimism bubbled it’s way to the surface, channeled into our art as a coping mechanism.\n\nIt’s into this climate that the Coen Brothers released NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, the film stunned audiences into a dumb silence, almost as if they were bludgeoned by some blunt instrument. I had caught the film during my last days of living in Boston, and it felt like nothing short of a revelation.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is undoubtedly the Coens’ masterwork, rightfully rewarded with their biggest box office take at the time, as well as golden statues for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards.\n\nIt was a perfect synergy of the cultural zeitgeist, the Coens’ unique directorial style, and the national mood. The film’s tagline, “you can’t stop what’s coming”, proved to be true on untold levels. Its success was an unstoppable juggernaut, and its barren, desert setting hinted at the economic wasteland and devastation that, much like the terrifying specter of Anton Chigurgh and his fateful coin, was traveling from some unknown place to arrive at our front door.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN concerns a briefcase full of money, and the wrath it incurs on those who possess it. A gruff man, Lleweyn Moss, comes across it when he finds the aftermath of a drug deal gone south. He takes it back home with him, only to learn that its original owners, a dangerous gang of Mexicans, are after him to take it back. Meanwhile, a fundamentally unsettling assassin known as Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is relentlessly stalking closer to Moss, also in pursuit of the briefcase.\n\nHe kills anyone who gets in his way, utilizing a variety of macabre techniques: strangling a police officer with his handcuffs, using an air-powered bolt pistol to punch holes in the head of unlucky fellows, or savagely gunning down Mexican gangsters with a silenced shotgun. One step behind both players is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a weary police officer who, in his old age, has become deeply troubled by the realization that existence could be meaningless.\n\nThese three figures pursue each other across the Texas countryside, and their encounters with each other will change their lives forever.\n\nThe calibre of acting talent on display is simply staggering. Although Bardem was the only cast member to be nominated for an Academy Award, Jones and Brolin are just as eligible in their respective turns. Sheriff Bell was the role that Jones was born to play– both men hail from the same area of West Texas, and Jones imbues his aging lawman with a haunted, wanderer’s soul.\n\nAs he enters his twilight years, spirituality is beginning to enter his life– but not like he imagined it. What he expected to be a sudden swelling of faith in Jesus Christ instead gave way to a philosopher’s forlorn musings on a world where human life is snuffed out as inconsequentially as if it were a household fly. It’s a towering performance by Jones, one that reminds us why he’s one of the best actors working today.\n\nBrolin, who before this point was a relative unknown, found his career kicked into high gear after having to fight to secure the role of Llewelyn Moss. His performance is gruff, quiet, and tough– but he doesn’t take himself so seriously that he’s one-note. Moss is a stubborn man who thinks he can outsmart the unstoppably evil force that draws closer, but he must pay the price of his hubris with his own blood.\n\nAnother unknown to US audiences, Javier Bardem was a pants-shitting revelation the minute he stepped on-screen with that unnervingly creepy haircut. As Anton Chigurh, he’s one of the most indelibly terrifying monsters in cinematic history, right up there with Dracula or Heath Ledger’s Joker. He’s whip-smart, efficient, and deadly quiet. When he speaks, the low monotone timbre of his voice suggests nothing less than Lucifer incarnate. It was a hell of an introduction for Bardem, easily netting him the Best Actor Oscar that would kick off one of the most acclaimed careers of any actor ever.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally great, starting with Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells, a dandy bounty hunter tasked with finding Chigurh and the briefcase. Harrelson’s screentime is brief, but his casual drawl and relaxed tough-guy attitude makes for a highly memorable appearance. Kelly McDonald, a pretty Scottish actress, defied any doubt about her ability to portray a timid Texan girl with her performance as Moss’s wife, Carla Jean. She pulls off a heavy West Texas accent effortlessly, and her feminine presence is a welcome relief in a film that is otherwise dominated by brutal machismo.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is unique in that almost none of the Coens’ regular actors make an appearance in the film, save for Stephen Root. Root makes a brief cameo as a big-city boss that hires both Wells and Chigurh, only to find himself on the receiving end of Chigurh’s silent fury. Root plays his character as appropriately sleazy, but it never feels over the top or out-of-place within the stark tone that the Coens have cultivated.\n\nRoger Deakins, serving once again as Director of Photography, effortlessly creates one of the Coens’ best-looking films. The 35mm film image, limited to a 2.35:1 aspect ratio so as to give the film a bigger cinematic punch, is spare and stark. Highlights are blown out, suggesting a place where hard men toil under the intense beating of a vengeful sun.\n\nColors are desaturated to reflect the arid desert climate that surrounds them, and blood (of which there is a copious amount) stands out as a creeping, dark crimson fluid that stains the earth and seeps into cracks in the floorboard. The Texas nights are as hot as the days, represented via warm amber tones in place of the more conventional moonlight-blue. The austerity of Deakins’ images are complemented by reserved camerawork that uses imperceptibly slow, creeping dolly shots that add an air of foreboding and malice to slow-burn suspense sequences.\n\nFor their twelfth feature film, the Coens bring on a new Production Designer in the form of Jess Gonchor. Like Dennis Gassner before him, Gonchor creates a tangible world for McCarthy’s characters to inhabit. West Texas in 1980 is a dusty, color-less place that’s still somewhat stuck in the decade that preceded it. Walls are wood-panelled, motels are dingy, clothes draw from the earth tone palette that defined fashion in the late 70’s, etc.\n\nThe film’s editing, done by the Coens under their Roderick Jaynes persona, is spare and allows their compositions to breathe. This low-key approach pays off in spades in some of the film’s most suspenseful sequences. Instead of using quick cuts to ratchet up tension, the Coens wisely opt to dwell on their shots for an inordinate amount of time, allowing the sound effects to pull us to the edge of our seats.\n\nOne example is this masterful shootout sequence that occurs halfway through the film. Note how Chigurh is barely glimpsed as he attacks Moss. No tricky camera angles, no fast-editing, no thumping music– just the compressed explosions of Chigurh’s shotgun and fleeting footsteps bouncing off wet concrete:\n\nSpeaking of music, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is infamous for its lack of music throughout the entirety of the film. Carter Burwell, the Coens’ regular music man, is credited for his score, but you wouldn’t know it upon a cursory listen to the film’s soundtrack. Burwell’s score does exist, albeit in a radically imperceptible way.\n\nComprised mainly of ambient tones, it buzzes low under select sequences, giving a palpable ominousness to them that registers on a subconscious level. It’s an effective approach to score, especially for a film that already achieves such a powerful atmosphere without it. The only blatantly musical notes we hear come in the diagetic form of a mariachi band that plays over Moss as he wakes up wounded in a Mexican town square.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN ironically finds the Coens working in top form, while simultaneously adopting a stylistic approach markedly different from their previous films. Many of their directorial signatures— beginning the film with a regionally-accented voiceover musing over establishing shots of the setting, traveling point of view shots, and wry humor– are all present, to varying degrees of subversion. The violence is sudden and brutal (and often occurs offscreen), as it always has been with the Coen Brothers, but there’s considerable more malice this time around.\n\nThe image of a storm of scuff marks on linoleum– the aftermath of a savage murder by strangulation– is haunting by the slow, torturous death said marks imply. Quirky Coen characters abound, but they’re grounded in the harsh, sun-baked reality that the story demands. If their fondness for influences like Buster Keaton and Preston Sturges were evident in their previous films, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN finds the Coens swinging towards the other side of the pendulum, channeling the likes of John Ford and Sam Peckinpah.\n\nAn air of pessimism abounds throughout the film, implying a weary hopelessness to life that can only be soothed by a woman’s grace. Thematically, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN’s nihilistic viewpoint has much in common with the Coens’ previous masterpiece FARGO (1996), as well as their pitch-black debut BLOOD SIMPLE (1984).\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the Coens’ biggest cinematic successes have been when they indulge in darker subject matter. For all their worth as intelligent tricksters and comedic stylists, perhaps their greater voice is that of documentarians of our own inhumanity towards each other.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is an unmitigated highlight in the Coens’ development as filmmakers. The stripped-down aesthetic allows them to channel the best of their craft into the proceedings, making for an unforgettable experience. The Coen Brothers are lucky enough to have a great deal of films that they’ll be forever remembered for, but NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN stands above them all as a staggering achievement.\n\nIt is one of my personal favorite films of all time, inarguably one of the very best films of its decade, and a reference-grade masterwork that raised the bar for all filmmakers to come.\n\nBURN AFTER READING (2008)\n\nHot off the career highlight that was the dual Oscar wins (Picture and Director) for 2007’s NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, Joel and Ethan Coen found themselves the subject of lofty expectations regarding their next project. While a short contribution to the TO EACH HIS OWN CINEMA anthology project entitled “WORLD CINEMA” (2007) is their true follow-up, it is unavailable on these shores. This brings us to 2008’s BURN AFTER READING.\n\nWritten in tandem withNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, (alternating between scripts every other day), the Coens’ thirteenth feature film was a paranoid satire of spy genre conventions that featured an impressive lineup of A-list talent and first-rate execution.\n\nBURN AFTER READING has a zany energy that calls to mind the Coens’ previous work on RAISING ARIZONA (1987) andO BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000). When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a low-ranking analyst in the CIA, is unceremoniously fired, he deludes himself into the idea that a book of his memoirs will be both his meal ticket and delicious revenge on his former employers.\n\nThe digital files containing his notes inadvertently find their way into the bumbling hands of Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt), an inept pair of fitness trainers who believe they’ve stumbled upon juicy state secrets. When their plan to extort money from Cox in exchange for returning the files goes south, they then try to sell the information to the Russians.\n\nMeanwhile, Cox’s wife (Tilda Swinton) carries on an affair with the sex-obsessed Harry Pfarrer (George Clooeny), who grows paranoid when he becomes entangled in the complicated machinery of the plot and begins to suspect he’s the subject of government surveillance.\n\nIf the plot sounds ridiculously convoluted, that’s because it was meant to be. The Coens’ chief aim in creating the film was to lampoon the spy and political thriller genres by orchestrating a complex, lurid plot that ultimately was meaningless by sheer virtue of the worthlessness of the central macguffin. This makes for extremely silly moments that stretch the bounds of believability, but the Coens have a strong enough command of their craft to keep the tone consistent and the action clear.\n\nThe cast is remarkable in that it is comprised primarily of A-list talent that willingly subvert their self-serious images to great comedic effect. Clooney’s third appearance in a Coen film acts as the capstone to what the directors have informally dubbed the “trilogy of idiots” (the other two being O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? and INTOLERABLE CRUELTY (2003)). Clooney’s Harry Pfarrer is handsome, but a schlub nevertheless. His increasing paranoia over the events of the film provides ample opportunity for him to ham it up.\n\nMalkovich, a character actor celebrated for his oddball performances, also parodies his “thespian” conceits as the disgruntled, violently confused Osborne Cox. His character is an intelligent, well-educated man who has effectively weaponized his genius against those he considers to be intellectually inferior, wielding it with an ultimately-murderous intent.\n\nFrances McDormand, who hasn’t been seen in a Coen Brothers film since THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE (2001), is a sight to behold in her incarnation as Linda Litzke. McDormand, no longer the fresh-faced lass we saw in 1984’s BLOOD SIMPLE, embraces her middle age and channels it into her performance of a vainglorious woman with fading looks and sagging skin.\n\nLitzke is probably the most emotionally pure of all the narcissistic characters in the film, as she spends most of the film desperately looking for love before it’s too late. Ultimately, her relative innocence makes her the only character that gets away scott-free.\n\nUndoubtedly, the film’s highlight performance is Brad Pitt as Chad Feldheimer. Feldheimer’s personality is perfect for his profession as a personal trainer. Pitt bounces around like a hyperactive spazz with bad hair and a worse sense in clothing. His air-headed performance is so great because of the unfettered familiarity he conveys– how many of us actually knowsomeone like that? I certainly do. Pitt’s character is responsible for some of the biggest laughs in the film, like the infamous“Security of Your Shit” sequence (embedding disabled, sadly).\n\nThe remainder of the cast is filled out with more A-list names, like Tilda Swinton, Richard Jenkins, and JK Simmons. Swinton plays Katie Cox, Osborne’s unfaithful and unsupportive wife. Jenkins plays Ted, the manager at the gym where Linda and Chad work. Ted is a pitiable character, hopelessly in love with Linda even though he’s romantically invisible to her.\n\nSimmons, who appears in his second Coen film with a small cameo, is highly memorable as the CIA boss who finds himself baffled by the inane plot developments and unmotivated to intervene. His omniscience is a handicap, leaving him scratching his head over the bizarre events as they unfold. However, it’s in his confusion and indifference that the Coens’ core message resides.\n\nThe Coens’ regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, was unavailable to shoot BURN AFTER READING due to already committing to shoot Sam Mendes’ REVOLUTIONARY ROAD (2008). Instead, the Coens turned to Terrence Malick’s current cinematographer, the supremely gifted Emmanuel Lubezki. Lubezki does a great job appropriating the Coens’ signature visual style, while putting his own subtle stamp on the material. Shot on 35mm film, BURN AFTER READING is one of the most gorgeous-looking comedies in memory.\n\nThe 1.85:1 frame complements the crisp coldness of autumnal New York (subbing in for Washington DC and its environs) by adopting a palette of desaturated pastels. The contrast is deep, with highlights that take on more of a cream cast (rather than a solid white).\n\nThe camerawork, consisting of dolly and handheld-based moves and predominantly low angles, evokes the seriousness of hard-hitting political thrillers– a visual device that only heightens the overall joke. The more seriously the characters take themselves, the funnier the film becomes; a conceit that the film echoes in its own construction.\n\nThis self-seriousness is matched by the film’s score, crafted by regular collaborator Carter Burwell. In an attempt to match the characters’ delusions of grandeur, the score takes on a bombastic energy. Comprised of booming war drums and swelling strings that are reminiscent of the work of Phillip Glass, the score’s overt seriousness is the perfect companion to the Coens’ established tone, helping to communicate the sense of self-importance these characters have.\n\nIn their eyes, the stakes are life or death– but as outside observers, we get to be in on the ultimate joke: all their efforts and trials amount inherently meaningless.\n\nBURN AFTER READING is a first-class comedy that builds upon the formidable skillset the Coens have established. The Coens have made a career of doing the exact opposite of what people expect them to do, and this film certainly continues that legacy. Their affection for pitch-black humor is on full display, as well as their sudden, brutal treatment of violent acts. Some moments (like Chad’s ultimate fate) are shocking in their abruptness (and messiness), while other violent moments are left offscreen entirely.\n\nIt’s refreshing when filmmakers feel that they don’t have to show you everything, allowing imagination to fill in the blanks. The Coens’ ability to subvert genre expectations while still delivering a satisfying experience is rivaled only by a few filmmakers, all of whom could be considered to be in the top tier of great directors.\n\nAny Coen Brothers film released after the sheer phenomenon that was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN was bound to be a letdown. While it’s not their strongest film, BURN AFTER READING limits the possibility for disappointment by being genuinely hilarious. It’s as good as any film the Coens made in the first decade of the new millennium, bested only by its immediate predecessor.\n\nWhile it was met with middling success upon its release, I suspect that BURN AFTER READING’s stature in the Coen canon will only grow with time.\n\nA SERIOUS MAN (2009)\n\nIn the late 2000’s, Joel and Ethan Coen were experiencing a career resurgence in the wake of their Best Director win at the 2008 Academy Awards. After shooting BURN AFTER READING (2008), a comedic palette-cleanser of sorts, the Coens again defied expectation by tackling subject matter they held very close. Their fourteenth feature film, 2009’s A SERIOUS MAN, is arguably the Coens’ most personal and autobiographical film to date, by virtue of its dealings with Judaism and midcentury suburban Americana.\n\nA SERIOUS MAN is a film about a man’s struggles with faith, a topic that most everyone can relate to. Coming from a pair of filmmakers who are infamously guarded about their private lives and influences, it’s a curious inclusion in the Coens’ canon. For instance, not a single well-known actor appears in the film (let alone any of the Coens’ regular repertoire of performers).\n\nBy taking our attention away from who is in the film, we are able to more clearly focus on what the film is trying to say. But, what is it trying to say, exactly? In a good way, the film itself doesn’t seem to know. What is there to say when confronted with the unknowable force of a higher power?\n\nReading like a modern-day retelling of the Biblical story of Job, A SERIOUS MAN is about Larry Gopnik, an ordinary man whose faith in God is put to the test on an almost daily basis. Throughout his ordeals, he tries to a good and righteous Jew, but he finds it increasingly hard to be a good role model in an old-fashioned community, especially when the world around them is modernizing at a rapid pace.\n\nWhile the story is based on the Coens’ own experiences and notions about their Jewish heritage, people of any belief (even atheists) can sympathize with the hard questions that the film asks. But make no mistake, A SERIOUS MAN is a deeply personal film for the Coens, made even more so by the 1967-era Midwestern suburban setting that they themselves are a product of.\n\nThe cast, while comprised mostly of unknowns, thankfully doesn’t fail to deliver the Coens’ unique brand of quirk and characterization. Stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg plays Larry Gopnik, a mild-mannered physics professor who is growing frustrated with his increasing ineffectiveness. He haggles with his students over grades, he can’t control his kids, and trying to salvage his marriage to his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) is a lost cause.\n\nStuhlbarg’s non-celebrity is a blank slate, giving him an everyman quality onto which the audience can project their own existential crises. Lennick runs the risk of being the “evil, cheating wife”, but her own convictions and sincere charms work well in her favor. As Judith’s new beau, Sy Ableman, actor Fred Melamed steals the show. He’s an overbearing presence with no conception of personal space. His cool, calm demeanor makes his invasion into Gopnik’s family all the more evil.\n\nCharacter actor Richard Kind also appears as Uncle Arthur, Larry’s idiot savant brother who is continually laid low by the cyst growing on the back of his neck. The remainder of the cast all perform admirably, but it’s upon these four principals that the weight of the story really rests.\n\nRoger Deakins returns as Director of Photography, adopting an earth-toned color palette that fleshes out the late 60’s setting that has been meticulously recreated by returning Production Designer Jess Gonchor. Highlights within the 1.85:1 frame often take on a greenish-blue tinge while primary colors are desaturated and dull. On paper, it sounds visually dull, but Deakins’ expertise makes for a rather handsome 35mm film image. The Coens’ use of classical camera movements like dollies continues, and is supplemented with punches of handheld camerawork and canted angles that serve to illustrate Gopnik’s increasing disorientation.\n\nCarter Burwell again composes the score, using a lilting harp to add an air of mystery to the proceedings. It also recalls the ancient heritage that serves as the film’s focus, alluding to Old World sensibilities while retaining a traditionally cinematic sound. Such sensibilities are also illustrated through the use of various opera cues. Additionally, the Coens use period-appropriate psychedelic rock throughout, most notably the recurring musical motif of Jefferson Airplane’s “Want Somebody To Love”.\n\nOther bands like The Velvet Underground and Jimi Hendrix serve as encroaching voices of modernity that threaten to penetrate this ancient culture from the outside. This is illustrated in the scenes where Larry’s son, Danny, listens discretely to rock music on a walkman during his Hebrew classes.\n\nThe opening of A SERIOUS MAN is worth mentioning, notable by sheer virtue of its inclusion. Presented in an old-fashioned 4:3 aspect ratio, the prologue depicts a (probably made-up) piece of Jewish folklore concerning a man who has invited an old family friend into his humble home for soup and shelter from a cold winter’s night. The man’s wife is shocked to learn the identity of the old friend, who she is convinced died of disease three years earlier.\n\nWhen the old man enters their home, the wife tries to prove that he is a dybbuk, or the malevolent, spiritual manifestation of a dead person. She even goes as far as stabbing the man, who laughs off the wound as he bleeds to death. He wanders back out into the night, while the married couple ruminates on the spell of bad luck that surely awaits them. While some take this sequence as a prologue showing the genesis of the Gopnik family’s bad fortune, the Coens publicly insist that it has no bearing on the overall plot.\n\nInstead, it is meant as a callback to an older time when short films played before features. This short introductory sequence (spoken entirely in Yiddish with subtitles) sets the mood for the ensuing story, while also introducing the audience to some of the more arcane, superstitious tenets of Judaism.\n\nIt stands to reason that the Coens’ most personal film will have the most distinct bearings of their directorial aesthetic. This is more or less the case. The Coens’ distinct sense of character quirks seems to manifest itself from the deeply-rooted idiosyncrasies of their cultural upbringing. By this, I mean that the characters in A SERIOUS MAN are purer, more-distilled versions of classic Coen character archetypes.\n\nA fundamentally Jewish sensibility courses underneath each of the Coens’ character creations and plots, an observation that seems obvious now upon reflection, but didn’t really make itself known to me until A SERIOUS MAN. Other elements of the Coens’ aesthetic– period settings, sudden/brutal violence and the withholding of onscreen deaths for prominent characters– are all present and accounted for.\n\nThere’s even the occasional in-joke acknowledging a self-contained universe across the Coens’ body of work (for instance, a callback to Tukman/Marsh, the fictional law firm mentioned in BURN AFTER READING).\n\nThe Coens don’t strike me as particularly religious, but Judaism– arguably more so than any other major religion– is as much a cultural and ethnic heritage as it is a belief system. Even if they’re not ardent observers of their own faith, their upbringing in that particular culture informs their filmmaking style and view of the world. By tackling their religion head-on, the Coens are sharing more of their intimate selves than they ever have before.\n\nBut don’t try to look for these insights too hard– even their most nakedly personal moments ultimately reveal themselves as red herrings under intense scrutiny. The film was released to middling box office success, but met with strong critical acclaim. It went on to be nominated for Best Picture at the 2010 Academy Awards, and has ever since enjoyed a comfortable standing among the Coens’ best films.\n\nA SERIOUS MAN asks hard questions, and provides little in the way of answers. And rightfully so, for a film that concerns itself with vague concepts of God, fate, and destiny. Everything about the film, including its knockout ending, defies easy explanation. So it is with such an unknowable, ultimately un-proveable thing as a religious belief. In the end, all you have to go on is faith, and only when it is is tested will your strength of character make itself known.\n\nCOMMERCIAL WORK (1995-2009)\n\nOver a career spanning nearly three decades, Joel and Ethan Coen have built up one of the most impressive bodies of work in cinematic memory. Their feature work is often held up as the gold standard of directing excellence, made all the more special by their independent roots. So color me surprised to learn (when I’m nearly at the end of my examination of their work) that the Coens have racked up an astonishing number of commercial credits since 1995.\n\nBut I’ll be damned if that isn’t the defining nature of the Coen Brothers– once you think you’ve got them figured out, they have one more trick up their sleeve that changes all your perceptions.\n\n*Embeds and links to spots are made when publicly available. The rest of these spots are available to watch via the paid commercial archive site, Source Ecreative.\n\nOLYMPUS: “TOURIST”- 1995\n\nWhat appears to be the Coen Brothers’ first commercial is an exercise in genre subversion. In the spot, a young man finds himself the subject of a harsh interrogation in some foreboding underground bunker. The dramatically-lit, cobalt-blue 16mm film image is the result of a collaboration between the Coens and Director of Photography Daniel Hainey, who, like Roger Deakins in their theatrical work, would become the Coens’ regular commercial cinematographer.\n\nThe production design recalls Ridley Scott’s “1984” Apple spot in its moodiness, but the Coen’s signature comedic sensibilities make the spot something else entirely.\n\nHONDA: “OFFICE”- 1996\n\nA year later, Honda enlisted the Coens’ help to realize their spot for “OFFICE”, which features a young man rushing through his place of work and ignoring the frantic pleas of his co-workers so he can reach his “special place”– a white room that holds his beloved Honda sedan. The piece is shot in black and white, and uses relentless dolly movements and outsized characterization to create a high-energy piece in line with the Coens’ comedic sensibilities.\n\nPARISSIENNE CIGARETTES: “PARISSIENNE”- 1999\n\nThis commercial, from European cigarette brand Parissienne, is a riff on old Hollywood silent vampire films like NOSFERATU (1992). As old-timey horror music plunks over the soundtrack, a wiry vampire approaches a sleeping woman and feeds. In his post-feeding stupor, he lights a cigarette to calm his nerves.\n\nCuriously enough, the Coens go to great lengths to replicate the wide, proscenium-style shooting aesthetic of early Hollywood films, yet they shoot in color. They add another modern touch by slowly trucking the camera to the side as the vampire staggers back towards us. This is a great example of Coens subverting genre expectations (modern techniques applied to silent film aesthetics).\n\nHONDA: “FAMILY NEGOTIATIONS” CAMPAIGN- 1999\n\nIn 1999, the Coens once again went to work for Honda, creating a series of four spots built around the comedic concept of a family using individual lawyers to haggle with each other over who gets what features in the new family car. Out of the four spots created, I was only able to view two, but I imagine my observations equally apply to the remaining spots.\n\nThe Coens employ their standard black/brown color palette to reflect the relative generic-ness of their surroundings. This places a greater emphasis on the larger-than-life characters as they argue vociferously amongst each other. The Coens use canted camera angles and circular dolly movements to add visual punch to the proceedings, which emphasizes the off-kilter nature of the comedy. All in all, this is a clever campaign made all the more memorable by the Coens’ skillful helming.\n\nALLTELL CAMPAIGN- 1999\n\n1999 was a busy year for the Coen Brothers on the commercial front. They also tackled a small campaign from Alltell. The conceit of the campaign is simple enough: two characters stand against a white background and argue with each other. The hero eventually convinces his opponent that switching to Alltell will solve his problems.\n\nThe first spot, “CFO”, features a typical Coen archetype: the cigar-smoking, fat-cat boss. The second, “PUPPET”, is a little more bizarre in that the opponent can only interact through his hand puppet. It’s not exactly the most clever thing in the world, but hey, it’s a commercial.\n\nBoth spots were shot by the Coens’ regular commercial cinematographer, Daniel Hainey, who lights the 16mm film frame with the Coens’ signature black/brown color palette. The execution of these spots speaks to the Coens’ affection for screwball comedy.\n\nH&R BLOCK: “DESK”- 2002\n\nThe black/brown color palette returns in earnest with the Coens’ 2002 spot “DESK”, made for tax firm H&R Block. The commercial features a mass of people slaving over their ledgers while the man in charge monotonously reads from a gigantic tome. It’s a joke about the massive amount of boring work that goes into doing your taxes, which H&R Block is all too happy to help you with.\n\nThe Coens use classical camera movements to add scale to the room, which adds to the overbearingness of the situation. Daniel Hainey collaborates with Daniel Pearl on the cinematography, while the Coens’ sometime-feature-editor, Tricia Cook, lends her cutting talents in post production.\n\nFor a bunch of number crunchers, the characters have well-developed personalities that are efficiently established within the spot’s 30 second running time. This is further proof of the Coens’ great love for the characters they create, as well as their attention to behavioral detail.\n\nGAP: “TWO WHITE SHIRTS”- 2002\n\nIn 2002, the Coens directed what is arguably their most well-known spot. Shot by Daniel Hainey in stylish black and white, their spot for Gap– “TWO WHITE SHIRTS”– features Dennis Hopper and Christina Ricci engaged in a low-key game of chess as they lounge by the pool. A classic rock song blasts over the image. The camera starts in close on Hopper’s calm, emotionless face. Gradually, it dollies back to reveal an idyllic southern California setting and an equally emotionless Ricci advancing one of her chess pawns before retiring to her lounge chair.\n\nThe spot exudes an effortless cool, using the contrast between black and white to great effect (white letterbox bars are a nice touch). Gap has always been known for their stylish commercials, so their choice of the Coen Brothers as directors is somewhat curious. However, it’s a well-made spot, and easily my favorite commercial of theirs.\n\nPARISIENNE: “PARISIENNE PEOPLE”- 2003\n\nA few years after their “PARISIENNE” spot for Parisienne Cigarettes, the Coens shot another spot entitled “PARISIENNE PEOPLE” (not exactly the most imaginatively-named set of commercials, is it?). This spot plays off the dichotomy of a stone-faced man smoking a cigarette as he sits in the audience, watching a hyperactive man belt out showtunes on stage.\n\nThe commercial employs simple camerawork, relying on an alternating shot/reaction shot execution to sell the comedy. Daniel Hainey again serves as Director of Photography, casting the backgrounds into deep shadow while handsomely lighting the two characters.\n\nLike their feature that year, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, “PARISIENNE PEOPLE” finds the Coens in pure screwball mode. Short, little-known works like this help to paint a picture of the brothers’ larger mindsets during particular eras of their career.\n\nREALITY COALITION/ALLIANCE FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION CAMPAIGN- 2009\n\nThe Coen Brother’s most recent commercial work is a pair of PSAs for the Reality Coalition/Alliance for Climate Protection. The spots, “AIR FRESHENER” and “LAUNDRY”, feature fake household-cleaning products that are hailed as wondrous scrubbing agents that ironically pollute the environment around them.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek nature of the concept is perfectly suited to the Coens’ sensibilities. Each spot is done in the robotically cheery tone of midcentury cleaning commercials, while a genetically perfect Aryan family with plastered-on smiles extolls the virtues of the miracle cleaner as they gleefully choke on the black smoke it emits.\n\nAs shot by cinematographer Daniel Hainey, the image is low-contrast in the sterile way that many commercials are now shot in (a trend I find extremely distasteful). Pastel color tones complement the blandness of the suburban setting, and the animated graphics of the cleaner in action recall the cutesy cartoons seen in similar commercials back in the 50’s.\n\nTrue to the Coens’ nature, the oddball comedy hints at a darker truth– that there’s no such thing as a wonder chemical that doesn’t pollute. It’s easy to see why the Coens were attracted to the concept, and their mark is immediately distinguishable from frame one.\n\nAs the Coens’ film career continues to develop, I don’t doubt that we’ll be seeing more commercial work from them as well. Features take a long time to develop, and shooting a commercial or two is a great way to generate extra income during those fallow in-between years. That’s not to say the Coens need that extra money– they do seem to be rather selective in regards to what work they take on. Some may say that commercial work makes sellouts out of respected auteurs, but let’s be honest: anything that enables the Coens to put more work out there for us to enjoy is a good thing.\n\nTRUE GRIT (2010)\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen’s most recent film, 2010’s TRUE GRIT, also happens to be one of their best. Positioning itself as a second adaption to Charles Portis’ original novel (as opposed to a remake of the 1969 film starring John Wayne), it would go on to become one of the Coens’ best-received films. The instantaneous acclaim resulted in yet another Best Picture nomination as well as their first box office gross over $100 million. It is generally regarded as one of the more superior westerns ever made, besting the cinematic original and even the source novel.\n\nBut something else happened along the way. In their execution of TRUE GRIT, the filmmakers left behind two of their most-defining characteristics: subversion of genre expectations and an ironic point of view. Oddly enough, the absence of such directorial stylings only bolsters the Coens’ craft. As it stands, TRUE GRIT is an earnest, optimistic story firmly rooted in the traditions of the western genre.\n\nIt’s not a deconstruction, but rather an embrace of genre tropes, brilliantly rendered with the same effective minimalism that propelled 2007’s NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN to similar success.\n\nTaking place in the Arkansas territories in the winter of 1880, TRUE GRIT follows the exploits of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious fourteen year-old girl who has arrived in town to transport her murdered father’s remains back to her family’s homestead. She also has other, bigger plans– finding Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who killed her father, and bringing him to justice.\n\nShe enlists the help of a cantankerous old bounty hunter, Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) as well as a vainglorious Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) to act as her guides and accomplices during the hunt.\n\nThe cast, comprised of faces both old and new, performs at the top of their game throughout. Bridges made Oscar history when he was nominated for his performance as Cogburn (it was the first time an actor had been nominated for taking on a role that had earlier earned another Best Actor nomination for its originator, Wayne).\n\nIn his second Coen Brothers outing, Bridges completely disappears underneath his scraggly beard and eyepatch, adopting a husky growl of a voice that’s at once both intimidating and endearing. Damon fully embraces the inherent silliness of his character LeBoeuf by wearing his spurs and strange facial hair with pride. It’s an involved, dedicated performance that sees Damon bringing a new dimension to his pretty-boy physicality.\n\nBut by far, the performance deserving of most acclaim, is that of Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. A complete unknown beforeTRUE GRIT, Steinfeld was only thirteen years old at the time of filming. Her Ross is confident and stubborn, with a wit and vocabulary light years beyond her age and small stature.\n\nThe story’s events find Ross hardened by the end, but it’s by no means a loss of innocence tale. Steinfeld came out of left field to deliver one of 2010’s most iconic performances, and her Best Actress nomination was well-earned. It will be interesting to see what fruit her talents bear as her career unfolds.\n\nOf the supporting cast, only Josh Brolin has had any experience in a Coen Brothers film before (save for a voice cameo by JK Simmons as Mattie’s lawyer). Having served as the lead in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, Brolin trades in screen time for meatier character work. As the fugitive at the center of the hunt, Brolin’s Tom Chaney is a grizzled, dirty scoundrel with an unusually high-pitched voice that hints at an undiagnosed psychopathy and dangerousness.\n\nInterestingly enough, he’s not the leader of his particular posse– that honor belongs to Lucky Ned Pepper, played with reckless abandon by Barry Pepper. Pepper relishes the chance to be a vicious miscreant, barking his lines through a mouth caked in spittle, dirt, and gingivitis. The sickly-looking Lucky Ned proves to be an even more ruthless antagonist than the surprisingly cowardly Chaney.\n\nRoger Deakins, having been absent for 2009’s A SERIOUS MAN, returns to his rightful place as Director of Photography. As befitting the genre, the 35mm film image is framed to the panoramic 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The color palette deals in varying shades of worn brown and desaturated primaries. Deep shadows stand in stark contrast to the bright, slightly overexposed highlights, which gives a sun-seared patina to the image.\n\nThe Coens add a great deal of scale to the picture by framing returning Production Designer Jess Gonchor’s period-authentic details and set dressing with elaborate dolly and crane camera moves. The Coens are well aware of the sweeping, romantic nature of the western genre, which is reflected in their own work here without the slightest trace of irony.\n\nTRUE GRIT also benefits from the talents of major Hollywood backers like Scott Rudin and Megan Ellison. Their clout and resources contribute significant production value to the film, and the slightest of cursory looks is all that’s needed to see that all that money is up there on-screen. The sweeping edit by Roderick Jaynes (aka the Coen Brothers) also adds considerable excitement and substance to the picture.\n\nCarter Burwell returns for scoring duties, crafting one of his most iconic works in the process. The swelling music, comprised of traditional orchestra instruments, is both rousing and elegiac. The film’s point of view is that of Mattie’s, twenty five years later as she reflects on how those events shaped who she is today. As such, there’s an air of melancholy and longing in Burwell’s score– not just for Mattie’s youth, but for the once-open promise of the West as it became settled and incorporated into modern society.\n\nDespite an overtly optimistic and straightforward tone, TRUE GRIT still bears the unmistakeable stamp of the Coen Brothers. Their love for wry characterization informs a great deal of interactions, giving each actor ample scenery to chew. The story still begins with a compelling, poetic voiceover. The violence still packs the same kind of punch as their other films, but the absence of substantial blood and gore allows them to get away with a lot under the film’s PG-13 rating. The Coens’ mastery of tone allows them to consistently surprise us without breaking any genre rules.\n\nAs I mentioned above, TRUE GRIT is the Coen Brothers’ most recent work (as of this writing). In terms of overall excellence, it’s easily in their top three (the other two being NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and 1996’s FARGO). While the Coens’ singular voice has stayed the same since BLOOD SIMPLE’s debut in 1984, each successive release has found their craft steadily improving.\n\nThe Coen Brothers, as a unified entity, can easily be considered one of our era’s greatest living filmmakers– a notion made all the more impressive considering their truly independent roots. In their wake, the Coens have inspired countless other filmmakers and liberated them from the notion that drama and comedy are separate conceits. It turns out, they actually are the same… it just depends on who’s telling the story.\n\nINSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS (2013)\n\nAny aspiring artist can tell you the long, sad, often-frustrating story of their attempts to break through in their chosen medium. The pursuit of making art as one’s primary means of income, while incredibly exhilarating and fulfilling in its victories (both small and large), comes with living in a constant state of self-doubt, second-guessing, what-ifs, and seething envy for colleagues more successful than you.\n\nBeing an artist means pouring your blood, sweat, and tears into your work, oftentimes for no one else’s benefit but your own, and rarely with any kind of financial reward for your trouble. Being a part of an artistic community, while oftentimes a source of great encouragement and strength, can also be a source of great heartbreak when you’re surrounded by constant reminders that there will always be someone more talented, more connected, or more popular than you.\n\nIt takes a very specific kind of courage and character to persevere in such an environment, which the directing team of brothers Joel and Ethan Coen capture so beautifully in INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS (2013), their intimate portrait of Greenwich Village’s burgeoning folk scene circa the early 1960’s.\n\nLike its sister piece O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000) before it, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS springs forth from the rich heritage of American folk music. The Coens have often turned to our distinct musical flavor in finding inspiration throughout their body of work, and with INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS they turn their attention to the folk scene in Greenwich Village at a specific point in history—the moment just before Bob Dylan came around and fundamentally transformed it.\n\nThe Coens used folk musician Dave Van Ronk’s life as a jumping-off point, fictionalizing his plight in such a way that it would become our window into this insular, long-forgotten world. To accomplish their vision, the Coens teamed up with Scott Rudin, the super-producer behind their previous film (2010’s TRUE GRIT). At this time, Rudin had been dabbling in independent experimental works from well-known auteurs, like Noah Baumbach and his 2012 feature FRANCES HA, so another round with the Coens seemed only natural.\n\nDespite the runaway success of their previous pairing, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS floundered around somewhat in securing distribution, and while it received great reviews from the critics, it never found solid footing and support aside from the most hardcore of Coen fanatics (of which, admittedly, there are legion).\n\nINSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS tells the story of its eponymous protagonist (Oscar Isaac), a struggling folk singer trying to make a dent in Greenwich Village’s crowded music scene in 1961. He is essentially homeless, bouncing around from couch to couch and becoming increasingly reliant on the generosity of like-minded artist within the scene as well as his adoring (and only) fans, a well-to-do older couple. Oftentimes, his inability to get his life in order results in animosity from his closest friends, which the thick-skinned Llewyn seems to be mostly oblivious to.\n\nThe film as a whole doesn’t boast much in the way of a traditional plot, opting instead to follow Llewyn during a somewhat eventful week that begins with his contentious friend and fellow folk singer Jean (Carey Mulligan) secretly announcing that she might be pregnant with his child—- a rather shitty development for her considering it might also be her boyfriend Jim’s (Justin Timberlake) baby and she actually would want to keep that one.\n\nWhile Llewyn scrounges for whatever change he can in order to take care of the situation, he meets with his manager who, in as many words, reminds Llewyn of his depreciated musical value following the suicide of his partner, who jumped off the George Washington Bridge a few years prior.\n\nA little bit later, Llewlyn records a song with Jim and fellow folk singer Al Cody (Adam Driver)—a song of Jim’s own making that Llewyn personally finds distasteful and embarrassing. Assuming this naked attempt to sell out won’t actually result in success, Llewyn accepts the one-time session recording payment without having the foresight to secure any future royalties—an ill-advised decision that hammers home when Llewyn discovers that, ironically, the song is actually going to be quite popular.\n\nAnd finally, in a last-ditch attempt to secure new management, Llewyn hitches a ride to Chicago. He hopes to audition for a famous manager out there, only to again hit a wall that he can’t quite break through.\n\nINSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS manages to capture a certain time and place in the calm before the storm… before a groundbreaking voice (Bob Dylan) came along like a megathrust earthquake and fundamentally changed the scene. To hammer this point home, we even see a cameo of a young Dylan sitting down to perform at the famous Gaslight venue, home to the Village’s folk community.\n\nWith the film, the Coens paint a portrait of a starving artist that’s utterly heartbreaking in how true it rings for any creative person caught in that hard, agonizing place between obscurity and success. However, the Coens use INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS to argue a heartfelt point—that the best art comes from a place of deprivation and the human condition of wanting and needing something; a fact that Llewyn has to understand and absorb if he’s ever going to take off. His art must be a product of passion and survival.\n\nIn his first true headlining performance, Oscar Isaac proves himself every bit a leading man. As the failing singer Llewyn, Isaac assumes a stymied, disorganized and neurotic persona. He’s fed up with the folk scene that seemingly exists only to mock him, along with his inability to rise to the level of success that his friends and colleagues seem to be experiencing. Isaac’s performance here is undeniably his best so far, fashioning a character that is inherently relatable even if he’s not exactly likeable.\n\nCarey Mulligan, in her second collaboration with Isaac after Nicolas Wending Refn’s DRIVE (2011), dyes her hair jet black so she can disappear into the angry and confrontational character of Jean. She absolutely nails the Coens’ biting sense of humor, made all the more hilarious considering her sweet, youthful countenance. Justin Timberlake continues his run of surprisingly well-acted appearances for prestige directors in the character of Jim. He’s handsome, successful and charismatic—basically, he’s a folk version of himself in real life.\n\nThe Coens’ supporting cast is equally eclectic, with GIRLS’ stars Adam Driver playing Al Cody— a goofy performer dressed up in cowboy attire— and Alex Karpovsky playing Marty Green, a bookish and put-together departure from his usual “frazzled/neurotic” guy roles. Longtime Coen collaborator John Goodman makes his requisite appearance as Roland Turner—a lethargic, Kentucky-fried bastard and successful jazz musician— again proving himself a master of characterization, despite his limited screen time.\n\nGarrett Hedlund, a much-maligned young actor for reasons I can’t quite comprehend, plays Johnny Five—Roland’s valet and chauffeur. Hedlund pulls off a quiet, intense performance as a James Dean greaser type, possessing an effortless cool that stands in stark contrast to Llewyn’s anxious aggression.\n\nThe Coens’ regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, was unavailable to shoot INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS due to his commitments on Sam Mendes’ SKYFALL (2012), so instead, they turned to French cinematographer Bruce Delbonnel, who had previously worked with the Coens on “TUILIERIES”, their short contribution to the 2006 omnibus film, PARIS J’TAIME.\n\nDelbonnel’s cinematography on INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS was nominated for an Academy Award—the film’s sole nomination, which is interesting given that the Academy usually falls all over itself to throw the Coens as many nominations as they can. Delbonnel and the Coens shot INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS on a 35mm film stock with very low grain; so low, in fact, that one could be mistaken for thinking the film was shot digitally.\n\nAs has been a mark of their work since O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?, the Coens give INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS a unique look via substantial color grading that desaturates primary hues while emphasizing a creamy, teal/grey palette. The look reflects the cold, depressing winter that envelopes the film, but there’s also a hint of romance to it, signified by a hazy, dreamlike soft focus. The Coens use the camera mostly in an observational, minimalist sense, keeping it static and unmoving (save for the occasional dolly glide).\n\nThe Coens’ regular production designer, Jess Gonchor, returns with a low-key, lived-in aesthetic that’s accurate to the period in its closer resemblance to the late 1950’s instead of the pyschedelic, go-go 60’s look that the period usually engenders.\n\nIn eschewing a traditional score, and by extension, another collaboration with their regular composer Carter Burwell, the Coens must subsequently rely more on their frequent music supervisor, T-Bone Burnett. Burnett’s legendary ear has been responsible for the compilation of several amazing musical soundscapes that give their respective movies and TV shows a distinct aural identity. His collaboration with the Coens reaches back to O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, and in many ways, the soundtrack to INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS becomes a spiritual successor to that film.\n\nWhile the film boasts several live performances, a lot of the music was pre-recorded by the cast prior to shooting, who were joined by modern, prominent folk artists like Marcus Mumford of Mumford and Sons (his main contribution being the film’s theme track, “Fare Thee Well”). Burnett and the Coens close out the film with Bob Dylan’s “Farewell”, which serves not only as a comment on Dylan’s profound effect on the folk scene following his debut, but also as wry commentary on how similar it is to Llewyn’s own “Fare Thee Well”.\n\nMake no mistake, this isn’t an oversight on the Coens’ part; it is a deliberate move that highlights the almost-nonexistent dividing line between successful and failed artists. The line itself is not talent, as one would naturally think—it’s luck.\n\nINSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS possesses a sensibility that places it directly in line with the Coens’ prolific body of work. The story is laced with pitch-black humor and acerbic characterization, treating the Gentile/Anglo culture of folk music with a distinctly Jewish mentality. The placing of INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS’ story in a concrete time period apart from contemporary trappings is a trait shared by the majority of the Coens’ previous work, giving their filmography a truly timeless appeal.\n\nSignified by the bitter, oppressive winter that surrounds the film’s characters, the specter of death looms large in INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS—but not in the sense that the Coens have traditionally applied it in films like FARGO(1996) or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007), seeing as this is the first Coen Brothers film where nobody dies. Rather, death is equated with obscurity by INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS’ characters. They work tirelessly to succeed as artists, because failure means obscurity—and to them, obscurity is a fate far worse than death.\n\nINSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS was well-received by critics (as was expected), but wasn’t given enough of a marketing push to enable a healthy box office run. After a long time in post-production with a constantly shifting and unpublicized release date, it was quietly released in time for the 2013/2014 awards season, netting only the aforementioned cinematography nomination at the Oscars.\n\nINSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS will most likely be remembered as a minor film in the Coens’ canon—but even the most minor Coen work still stands as a sterling example of cinema at its finest. The film is a strong, passionately realized work that competes with the best of 2013’s releases while continuing the Coens’ long tradition of excellence in both craft and storytelling.\n\nHAIL, CAESAR! (2016)\n\nThere’s a saying in Hollywood that goes: “you’re only as good as your last movie”, and while we all would like to think that’s really not the case, it’s unfortunately been proven true time and time again in the court of public opinion. Directing team Joel and Ethan Coen are well acquainted with this sentiment, as well as the erratic career momentum of seesawing from disappointment to triumph– the latest swing resulting in an unbroken string of four well-received prestige pictures in as many years.\n\nThe Coens hoped 2013’s INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS— their intimate and tenderly-woven portrait of artistic struggle– would continue this hot streak, but underwhelming box office returns promptly iced those plans. They kept a low-profile for the next couple years, quietly writing the screenplay for Steven Spielberg’s Cold War drama, BRIDGE OF SPIES (2015), while also developing a long-gestating idea about a troupe of actors in the 1920’s putting on a play about ancient Rome called HAIL, CAESAR! (3)\n\nFirst pitched to George Clooney in 1999 on the set of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, HAIL, CAESAR! was officially announced in industry trade journals in 2004, but active development didn’t officially start until 2013 when Clooney aggressively pushed them to make it as their next project. Nearly two decades in the making, HAIL, CAESAR! finally arrived in 2016, trading in its theatrical origins for a loving, yet bitingly satirical portrait of Hollywood studio system during its Golden Age.\n\nThe film, set in and around the bustling studio lots of 1950’s-era Los Angeles, affords the Coens ample opportunity to romp through the various popular genres of the time– pulpy westerns, lavish costume dramas, patriotic musicals, and biblical epics, to name just a few.\n\nIt’s a time of great transition in the movie business: the precisely-tuned machinery of the studio system and the very concept of “celebrity is beginning to break down and reveal its engineered artificiality, the Supreme Court has recently ruled that the studios must divest themselves from owning theater chains, and television is looming on the horizon like a foreboding storm cloud (2).\n\nIn response, Hollywood doubles down on money-making escapist fare. As an omniscient narrator (played by Michael Gambon) sets the stage, the Coens show us the trouble lurking in the wings– namely, a gang of Communist intellectuals who have managed to kidnap Hollywood superstar Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) from the set of his new biblical epic “Hail, Caesar!” and turn him into an agent for their cause.\n\nTheir successful heist is only one of the many headaches that Capitol Pictures executive Eddie Mannix has to deal with throughout HAIL, CAESAR! Played by Josh Brolin in his third appearance for the brothers, Mannix is all business and stubborn persistence in a fictionalized version of the real life MGM producer of the same name (1). An elite blessed with a working-class attitude, Mannix acts as something of a fixer for the studio, shuttling around the various productions and ensuring his unruly stars fall in with the studio line all while trying to decide whether he wants to move on to a cushy new job at Lockheed Martin.\n\nThis being a Coen picture, however, HAIL, CAESAR! isn’t necessarily concerned with Mannix’s emotional trajectory. Like so many Coen protagonists before him, Mannix is, rather, the steady rock that grounds a surrounding ensemble of oddballs, misfits, and all-around idiots. The title of King Idiot goes (naturally) to Clooney in his fourth character within the brother’s so-called “idiot trilogy” (which just goes to show that idiots never know when to stop).\n\nAs the dense and impressionable movie star Baird Whitlock, Clooney leans into his natural, old-fashioned charm to project an appropriate “Hollywood Golden Age” essence. Alden Ehrenreich plays Hobie Doyle, a heroic hayseed whose folksy swagger and plucky persistence lends him just as well to uncovering Baird’s whereabouts as it does to performing in swashbuckling western pictures.\n\nRalph Fiennes mixes the essence of Laurence Olivier with his M. Gustave character from Wes Anderson’s THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) in his performance as Laurence Laurentz, a stuffy and pretentious film director who delivers obtuse stage directions with a put-upon aristocratic accent.\n\nScarlett Johansson, who hasn’t been seen in a Coen picture since she was a young girl in 2001’s THE MAN WHO WASN’T THERE, shows she’s emerged into full-fledged womanhood in her role as DeeAnna Moran, a feisty silver screen diva with an abrasive Transatlantic accent and a history of poor impulse control. Tilda Swinton pulls double duty in her second performance for the Coens after 2008’s BURN AFTER READING, playing identical sisters Thora and Thessalay Thacker.\n\nThe Thacker Sisters are flip sides of the same increasingly-competitive coin: one fancies herself a serious journalist while the other is a bubbly vulture for celebrity gossip. The aforementioned gang of Communist intellectuals consists of familiar faces like A SERIOUS MAN’s Fred Melamed and INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS’ Alex Karpovsky, as well as Coen newbies like Dave Krumholtz and Wayne Knight. As Burt Gurney, a star of fleet-footed patriotic musicals and the secret leader of the Communists, Channing Tatum turns in an expectedly charismatic performance.\n\nThe script provides ample opportunity for Tatum to exercise his natural flair for dance and old-fashioned showmanship– indeed, his tap dancing ability seems so natural that it’s hard to believe he had to learn it for the film. Jonah Hill and Jack Huston turn in brief, yet memorable cameos as a bookish fall-guy kept on studio retainer and the star of Laurentz’ Merrily We Dance melodrama, respectively. Finally, longtime Coen repertory player (and Joel’s wife) Frances McDormand tops off HAIL, CAESAR!’s eclectic ensemble with a small role as a dowdy, chainsmoking editor under Mannix’s employ.\n\nAfter his brief absence from the Coen fold for INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS, cinematographer Roger Deakins returns to his rightful place at their side. During press interviews for that film, the brother signaled their suspicion that it might be their last shot on actual celluloid, but HAIL, CAESAR! delays that transition for another day, owing to their belief that film was the format to best evoke their intended period vibe.\n\nOnce again shooting on 35mm film in their usual 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the Coens and Deakins infuse HAIL, CAESAR! with warm, golden tones that project a certain nostalgia for Hollywood’s Golden Age, as well as bright saturated colors reminiscent of the early days of Technicolor. Unlike the somber observationalism of INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS, HAIL, CAESAR! possesses an exaggerated theatrically apropos of its subject matter, sweeping over returning production designer Jess Gonchor’s sets with classical dolly and crane-based camera movements.\n\nThe Coens show a particular stylistic zeal in their treatment of the various movies within the movie, effortlessly weaving in and out of “edited” m"
