        "text": "This article seeks to identify the underlying historiographical discourses advanced by the programming choices of the Cinémathèque Française’s recent Buster Keaton retrospective. In light of his wide ranging sound era output, the actor-director’s status as a “silent” comic is called into question in order to point toward unexplored approaches to his career and to propose new ways of familiarizing audiences with his work.\n\nA discussion of the 1932 Hollywood adaptation of Pirandello&#39;s 1930 play, Come tu mi vuoi , in the context of Miriam Hansen&#39;s analysis of Hollywood cinema as &quot;vernacular modernism&quot; allows us to explore the relationship between Pirandello&#39;s umorismo and mass culture. The coexis tence of multiple identity constructs in the absence of one stable identity is at the core of umorismo and is vividly dramatized in the play&#39;s presumably amnesiac female protagonist. The film&#39;s humoristic dimension is found not so much in its explicit discourse on identity, which the film&#39;s happy ending largely tends to resolve, as in its peculiar reconstruction of the Greta Garbo star-image, lying in excess of the film&#39;s story and diegesis, which shares with Pirandello&#39;s humour the constellation of diverse and competing images as projected onto the figure of the female protagonist.\n\nThis article’s intention is to establish the genesis as well to enumerate some of the most representative features of the “parodic-reflexive stylization” film model, one of the four theoretical paradigms established by Professor José Luis Castro de Paz for Spanish filmmaking between 1939 and 1950. The movement known as “The Other 27 generation” (La Otra generación del 27), composed primarily of Edgar Neville, José López Rubio, Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Antonio de Lara “Tono” and Migel Mihura will play an essential role in the model’s development thanks to the growth of the “New humor”, starting from a reactualization process of elements from other artistic manifestations such as the sainete, the astracán, the comical zarzuela, the parodies, the native Madrid theatre per hour, the varieties magazine and, specially, the silly and cutting edge humor typical of the 20s."
