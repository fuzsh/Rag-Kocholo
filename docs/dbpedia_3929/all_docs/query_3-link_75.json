        "text": "You probably celebrate events such as your wedding anniversary or your best friend's birthday. Professional milestones like work anniversaries matter just as much.\n\nWriting a thoughtful message to acknowledge a team member's job tenure is a small gesture that can have a big impact in terms of employee engagement.\n\n“Celebrating work anniversaries is a simple yet powerful way to let employees know how much we value their hard work and dedication. It's all about making them feel appreciated, and that positivity can do wonders for their motivation and engagement,” says Zianya Escamilla, Senior People and Culture Business Partner at Unito.\n\n“Considering that lack of recognition is a major reason people leave their jobs, why not seize this chance to make our team feel special?”\n\nEnter work anniversary messages. What exactly do they consist of? A work anniversary message can take various forms, from a handwritten card to an acknowledgment on LinkedIn or a speech at a work event. The idea is to share work anniversary wishes in a thoughtful, genuine way.\n\nA good employee anniversary message shouldn't stop at wishing someone a very happy work anniversary. It should also include mentions of their contributions in the workplace, from their positive attitude to their unique skills and strengths. Specific examples of the impact of their contributions on their team and organization are key.\n\nYou can also include personal anecdotes or mention the way a person has impacted you as a work friend if your relationship warrants it. Ending with wishes for continued success is a good idea. The core purpose of the message is recognition, so keep that in mind while writing work anniversary wishes.\n\nThe Importance of Work Anniversary Wishes\n\nEmployee recognition increases employee engagement, boosts job satisfaction and promotes a healthy work environment.\n\nHowever, less than a quarter of employees strongly agree that their organization has a system in place to recognize professional milestones such as work anniversaries, according to Gallup research.\n\nThis means that there is an opportunity to seize to create a positive company culture and increase engagement through employee recognition.\n\nAccording to Escamilla, work anniversaries are more than fun celebrations – they can be leveraged as a tool to strengthen the bond between employees and their organization.\n\nAcknowledging the dedication of your employees creates positive feelings and makes them feel valued, which, in turn, boosts loyalty, productivity and employee retention.\n\n“Knowing we appreciate their contributions motivates them to keep giving their best. Plus, work anniversaries bring teams together, fostering a strong sense of belonging and promoting a collaborative, positive culture. It's a win-win for everyone,” she adds.\n\nKaryn Martin, leadership expert and President and CEO of Interprise/Southwest Interior & Space Design, agrees.\n\nShe wishes more leaders understood how important work anniversaries are to people, and how easy it is to acknowledge them:\n\n“Recognizing work anniversaries is important because it shows the employee – and the world around them – that their time stands for something. People want to stay in companies where they are ‘seen', especially by senior management, so recognizing work anniversaries is critical to keeping your best talent. It's only human to feel happier and do better work when your contributions are recognized.”\n\nWhile wishing a team member a happy anniversary can have a long-lasting impact on morale, the opposite is also true: forgetting a milestone can be detrimental to employee engagement.\n\n“Looking at it from the employees' point of view, they know that it's simple to put things in annual calendars, so if their milestone – whether it is a birthday or a work anniversary – slips by unmentioned, they know that leadership just didn't care enough to input the dates and acknowledge the employee's service milestones,” says Martin.\n\nIn other words, celebrate work anniversaries and make each person feel like a valuable team member who plays a key role in your team's success.\n\nHappy Work Anniversary Messages to Increase Employee Engagement\n\nCrafting an appropriate and impactful work anniversary message can be tricky. You want it to feel personal yet be workplace-friendly. Maybe you're questioning whether a funny work anniversary message would work well or is best avoided.\n\nTo strike the right balance between personal and professional and lighthearted and serious, get inspiration from the examples below.\n\n1-year work anniversary messages\n\nAn Entelo study revealed that people are most likely to leave after their first year, making it a critical work anniversary to celebrate.\n\nA one-year work anniversary message should highlight the employee's successful integration into their team and company and recognize any wins from the past year.\n\nHappy one-year work anniversary!

Here are some tips to help you craft a stellar one.\n\nReflect on the recipient's accomplishments\n\nHighlighting specific achievements or anecdotes is one of the best ways to amp up the meaningfulness factor of a work anniversary message.\n\nIt shows that you've been paying attention. Before writing a single word, take the time to reflect on the recipient's accomplishments and their contributions to your team's success.\n\nExpress gratitude\n\nRemember that the main intent of a work anniversary message is to express gratitude, so make that the core of your message.\n\nThank the recipient for their dedication, hard work, and commitment to the team. Be clear about the impact of their efforts.\n\nKeep it positive\n\nA work anniversary message is not the time to give constructive feedback. Always focus on the positive and use the occasion as an opportunity to celebrate what has gone and is going well.\n\nBe mindful of tone\n\nConsider your relationship with the recipient when choosing the tone of your message. Are you going for friendly and informal, polished and formal, or somewhere in between? What's more appropriate given the context?\n\nBe mindful and always keep things professional and aligned with company culture, even with more casual work anniversary wishes.\n\nKeep it concise\n\nWhile it's important to do enough to celebrate work anniversaries, there is such a thing as a work anniversary message that's too long. Rambling or including unnecessary details can dilute the impact of your words. Happy work anniversary wishes can be concise.\n\nExpress your excitement for the future\n\nNot sure how to wrap up? Always end your message with a note about the future and your confidence in the recipient's continued success within the company.\n\nProofread carefully\n\nFinally, read through your message one last time with fresh eyes before sending it. Errors and typos can turn a great attempt at showing appreciation into one that appears half-hearted.\n\nTips to Deliver Work Anniversary Wishes\n\nThe messages above can be used as a starting point to craft your own personalized note. Don't be afraid to add your individual touch based on your unique relationship with the employee and the context of your team and organization.\n\nAs far as delivering your message and wishing an employee a very happy work anniversary, there are many ways to go about it. Let the tips below guide you.\n\nDo it during an all-hands meeting\n\nDo you hold regular all-hands meetings? Use them as an opportunity to recognize work anniversaries and you'll have a simple system to celebrate every milestone.\n\nHave all attendees cheer and celebrate each milestone and watch your team members beam with pride. Public recognition is powerful because it makes people feel valued for their contributions.\n\nIntegrate work anniversaries into your onboarding process\n\nYou can also integrate work anniversaries into your onboarding process by asking employees about their preferences.\n\nFor instance, when new employees join Escamilla's organization, they are offered a choice between a gift card or company swag for their anniversary.\n\nThis step in the process kicks things off on a positive note and lets people choose how they would prefer to be acknowledged.\n\nPTO and a personal note are always appreciated\n\nIf you're looking for universally appreciated gift ideas, PTO is always well-received. First, it sends the message that hard work should be balanced out by a fulfilling personal life. Treating people like human beings with other priorities outside of work is a pillar of a healthy culture.\n\nThere's also the fact that it's hard to miss the mark when offering extra time off – almost all workers would be enthusiastic about this perk. Just make sure to accompany the gesture with a thoughtful message.\n\nAllocate a budget for personalized surprises\n\nPersonalized work anniversary gifts are always better than generic corporate ones. Allocate a budget for work anniversary celebrations so you can come up with interesting ideas year-round as milestones come up.\n\nGet to know each team member and their interests so that you can pick something that genuinely fits their taste and personality – they'll be touched and truly feel that they are part of a caring team.\n\nAn Employee recognition platform like Applauz has an integrated service awards management program that simplifies the process of recognizing milestones and ensures that employees get meaningful gifts and the recognition they deserve.\n\nGifts aren't the only option. Depending on your budget, a lunch outing can be a nice way to celebrate too. If you're on a tight budget, you can still do something small yet impactful, like leaving their favorite Starbucks drink with a note on their desk.\n\nGo the extra mile for the big milestones\n\nThat said, if someone has been with the company for a decade or more, it's important to allocate resources to mark the occasion in a significant way.\n\nGetting upper management involved is a nice touch. For example, a senior leader can present the guests of honor with a gift and thank them for their contributions over the years.\n\nMake it fun\n\nDon't forget to have fun. It's a key piece of the puzzle when delivering a work anniversary message, after all.\n\nThis is a happy occasion, especially in a time when employee retention is harder to achieve. Now that you have a wealth of insights to help craft the perfect note, it's time to celebrate.\n\nCelebration Ideas to Complement Work Anniversary Messages\n\nIn some teams, it makes sense to throw a little celebration to go with work anniversary wishes. You have to have the budget for it, and it also has to make sense in terms of the size of your team. It has to be sustainable to do it for every single employee in order to keep things fair.\n\nIf it sounds like something that would make sense for you, consider the following work anniversary celebration ideas.\n\nOffer a custom plaque\n\nOffer a custom-designed plaque with your team member’s name and years of service on it. This highlights the occasion in a more formal way – and it’s a memorable keepsake for the recipient.\n\nSurprise them with a personalized video\n\nWant to be extra thoughtful and maybe make your team member shed a tear or two? Ask coworkers to share what they appreciate the most about them on camera. Create a video montage of everyone’s answers (and don’t forget to include cheesy music).\n\nDecorate their workspace\n\nIf you have an in-office team, come in early to decorate your team member’s workspace with balloons and a banner. It will start the day on the right foot.\n\nOrder a cake\n\nCakes aren’t just for birthdays – and who doesn’t love cake at the office? Order a custom cake with Happy Work Anniversary written on it. Include remote employees by calling them in virtually and sending them a cupcake.\n\nBook a unique team outing\n\nWhile you can bring your team to lunch to celebrate a work anniversary, you can also get creative and book an activity like ax throwing to sneak in extra team-building time."
