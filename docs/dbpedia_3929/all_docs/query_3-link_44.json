        "text": "The following message was sent to Sony Interactive Entertainment employees today\n\nIt brings me great pleasure to announce that I have decided on the succession strategy for the role of CEO at SIE. Over the last decade, SIE has grown tremendously, building upon our continuous successes in hardware, software and services through a sharper focus on player engagement.\n\nTo continue this growth and momentum, we are moving forward with a new management structure for SIE. Effective June 1, Hideaki Nishino will be appointed CEO of SIE’s Platform Business Group, and Hermen Hulst will be appointed CEO of SIE’s Studio Business Group. Effective the same date, I will step down from my current role as interim CEO and become Chairman of SIE, in addition to my roles at SGC. Both Hermen and Nishino-san will report to me as SIE Chairman.\n\nNishino-san will continue his role leading the Platform Experience Group, overseeing technology, products, services, and platform experience. He will also oversee third party publisher and developer relations and commercial operations, including sales and marketing of hardware, services, and peripherals.\n\nHermen will continue to lead the SIE Studios business, including PlayStation Studios, Bungie, and PlayStation Productions. He will be responsible for the development, publishing, and business operations of SIE’s first party content as well as IP expansion opportunities through PlayStation Productions.\n\nLater this month you will learn more about the long-term vision for Sony Group and the essential role SIE plays in that vision. As I mentioned previously, FY24 marks the start of the Mid-Range Plan period for Sony Group in which we will set the course for sustainable growth.\n\nThe future is incredibly bright for SIE and that is thanks to all of you. Since I became Chairman in October 2023, I have been inspired by your enthusiasm, innovative approaches, and teamwork. These values will serve us well as we embark on the exciting future for SIE.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Nishino-san and Hermen on their new roles."
