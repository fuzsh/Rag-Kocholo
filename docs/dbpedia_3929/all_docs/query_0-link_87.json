        "text": "(Photo by Diyah Pera/©Universal Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAll Zac Efron Movies, Ranked By Tomatometer\n\nZac Efron was the prince of the late-2000s musical with the Certified Fresh Hairspray and, of course, the High School Musical franchise, which by its third and final entry had graduated from the TV space and into a full-fledged theatrical experience. Senior Year and Hairspray were big money makers, and so was Efron’s first post-High School movie, 17 Again. Critics were just on the edge of giving it a Fresh rating, but the transformation comedy certainly appealed to his fan base, and set Efron up for a future as lead man in films.\n\nAfter getting the requisite Nicholas Sparks adaptation out of the way (The Lucky One), Efron spent several years building up a dramatic resume, though only Richard Linklater’s Me and Orson Welles connected with critics. After the surprise box office success of the Certified Fresh Neighbors, Efron found a new career tack in raunch comedies, letting loose in the likes of Dirty Grandpa, Baywatch, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, and The Beach Bum.\n\nEfron starred in 2019’s Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, a Ted Bundy biopic that coincided with the 30th anniversary of his execution. And Efron returned in 2020 on a much lighter note, voicing the ascot-less Fred in Scoob!, the latest in the venerable Scooby-Doo franchise. Jinkies! Now it’s time to look back on all Zac Efron movies, ranked by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#23\n\nNew Year's Eve (2011) 7%\n\n#23\n\nAdjusted Score: 12265%\n\nCritics Consensus: Shallow, sappy, and dull, New Year's Eve assembles a star-studded cast for no discernible purpose.\n\nSynopsis: Intertwining stories promise love, hope, forgiveness, second chances and more for a number of New Yorkers on the celebrated night.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Garry Marshall\n\n#22\n\nDirty Grandpa (2016) 10%\n\n#22\n\nAdjusted Score: 15910%\n\nCritics Consensus: Like a Werther's Original dropped down a sewer drain, Dirty Grandpa represents the careless fumbling of a classic talent that once brought pleasure to millions.\n\nSynopsis: Uptight lawyer Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) is one week away from marrying his boss's controlling daughter, putting him on the... [More]\n\nDirected By: Dan Mazer\n\n#21\n\nBaywatch (2017) 17%\n\n#21\n\nAdjusted Score: 30417%\n\nCritics Consensus: Baywatch takes its source material's jiggle factor to R-rated levels, but lacks the original's campy charm -- and leaves its charming stars flailing in the shallows.\n\nSynopsis: When a dangerous crime wave hits the beach, the legendary Mitch Buchannon leads his elite squad of lifeguards on a... [More]\n\nDirected By: Seth Gordon\n\n#20\n\nThe Lucky One (2012) 20%\n\n#20\n\nAdjusted Score: 26620%\n\nCritics Consensus: While it provides the requisite amount of escapist melodrama, The Lucky One ultimately relies on too many schmaltzy clichés to appeal to anyone not already familiar with the Nicholas Sparks formula.\n\nSynopsis: U.S. Marine Sgt. Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) returns home from his third tour of duty in Iraq with the one... [More]\n\nDirected By: Scott Hicks\n\n#19\n\nThat Awkward Moment (2014) 23%\n\n#19\n\nAdjusted Score: 29349%\n\nCritics Consensus: Formulaic and unfunny, That Awkward Moment wastes a charming cast on a contrived comedy that falls short of the date movies it seems to be trying to subvert.\n\nSynopsis: Best pals Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) indulge in casual flings and revel in their carefree, unattached lives.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Tom Gormican\n\n#18\n\nCharlie St. Cloud (2010) 28%\n\n#18\n\nAdjusted Score: 32660%\n\nCritics Consensus: Zac Efron gives it his all, but Charlie St. Cloud is too shallow and cloying to offer much more than eye candy for his fans.\n\nSynopsis: Adored by his single mother and his little brother Sam, Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron) is an accomplished sailor and... [More]\n\nDirected By: Burr Steers\n\n#17\n\n#17\n\nAdjusted Score: 46752%\n\nCritics Consensus: Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates benefits from the screwball premise and the efforts of a game cast, even if the sporadically hilarious results don't quite live up to either.\n\nSynopsis: Mike and Dave Stangle are young, adventurous, fun-loving brothers who tend to get out of control at family gatherings. When... [More]\n\nDirected By: Jake Szymanski\n\n#16\n\nWe Are Your Friends (2015) 40%\n\n#16\n\nAdjusted Score: 46106%\n\nCritics Consensus: We Are Your Friends boasts magnetic stars and glimmers of insight, but they're lost in a clichéd coming-of-age story as programmed as the soundtrack's beats.\n\nSynopsis: Young Cole Carter (Zac Efron) dreams of hitting the big time as a Hollywood disc jockey, spending his days and... [More]\n\nDirected By: Max Joseph\n\n#15\n\nThe Paperboy (2012) 45%\n\n#15\n\nAdjusted Score: 51517%\n\nCritics Consensus: Trashy and melodramatic, The Paperboy is enlivened by a strong cast and a steamy, sordid plot, but it's uneven and often veers into camp.\n\nSynopsis: In 1969 Florida, reporter Ward Jansen (Matthew McConaughey) returns to his hometown to write a story about death-row inmate Hillary... [More]\n\nDirected By: Lee Daniels\n\n#14\n\nParkland (2013) 52%\n\n#14\n\nAdjusted Score: 57235%\n\nCritics Consensus: Although its decision to look at John F. Kennedy's assassination through uncommon perspectives is refreshing, Parkland never achieves the narrative cohesion its subject deserves.\n\nSynopsis: Chaotic events take place at Parkland Hospital in Dallas after the attack that assassinated President John F. Kennedy.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Peter Landesman\n\n#13\n\nAt Any Price (2012) 51%\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 55303%\n\nCritics Consensus: At Any Price features a terrific performance from Dennis Quaid, and it offers further evidence of Ramin Bahrani's unique eye for detail, but film is weighted down by an overly melodramatic story.\n\nSynopsis: An ambitious Iowa seed farmer (Dennis Quaid) tries to get his resentful son (Zac Efron) interested in the family business,... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ramin Bahrani\n\n#12\n\nSCOOB! (2020) 48%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 56327%\n\nCritics Consensus: Scoob! is fun enough for youthful viewers and some hardcore fans, but never quite solves the mystery of why audiences shouldn't watch old episodes instead.\n\nSynopsis: With hundreds of cases solved and adventures shared, Scooby and the gang face their biggest, most challenging mystery ever --... [More]\n\nDirected By: Tony Cervone\n\n#11\n\nDr. Seuss' the Lorax (2012) 54%\n\n#11\n\nAdjusted Score: 61032%\n\nCritics Consensus: Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is cute and funny enough but the moral simplicity of the book gets lost with the zany Hollywood production values.\n\nSynopsis: Twelve-year-old Ted (Zac Efron) lives in a place virtually devoid of nature; no flowers or trees grow in the town... [More]\n\nDirected By: Chris Renaud\n\n#10\n\n#10\n\nAdjusted Score: 63575%\n\nCritics Consensus: Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile often transcends its narrative limitations through sheer force of Zac Efron's compulsively watchable performance.\n\nSynopsis: A chronicle of the crimes of Ted Bundy from the perspective of his longtime girlfriend, who refused to believe the... [More]\n\nDirected By: Joe Berlinger\n\n#9\n\nThe Beach Bum (2019) 58%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 64124%\n\nCritics Consensus: The role of a lifetime for Matthew McConaughey, The Beach Bum is set apart by Harmony Korine's distinctive style, but that isn't always enough to offset the unfocused story.\n\nSynopsis: Moondog is a fun-loving, pot-smoking, beer-drinking writer who lives life on his own terms in Florida. If he can put... [More]\n\nDirected By: Harmony Korine\n\n#8\n\nThe Greatest Showman (2017) 57%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 71530%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Greatest Showman tries hard to dazzle the audience with a Barnum-style sense of wonder -- but at the expense of its complex subject's far more intriguing real-life story.\n\nSynopsis: Growing up in the early 1800s, P.T. Barnum displays a natural talent for publicity and promotion, selling lottery tickets by... [More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Gracey\n\n#7\n\n17 Again (2009) 57%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 62616%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though it uses a well-worn formula, 17 Again has just enough Zac Efron charm to result in a harmless, pleasurable teen comedy.\n\nSynopsis: Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry) was a high-school basketball star with a bright future, but he threw it all away to... [More]\n\nDirected By: Burr Steers\n\n#6\n\nNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016) 64%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 73544%\n\nCritics Consensus: Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising may not be strictly necessary, but it still wrings a surprising amount of humor from a recycled premise with a distaff twist.\n\nSynopsis: Life is good for Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) and pregnant wife Kelly (Rose Byrne) until the unruly sisters of Kappa... [More]\n\nDirected By: Nicholas Stoller\n\n#5\n\nHigh School Musical (2006) 67%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 64434%\n\nCritics Consensus: High School Musical is brazenly saccharine, but it makes up for it with its memorable show tunes, eye-popping choreography, and appealing cast.\n\nSynopsis: Troy Bolton (Zac Efron), the star athlete at a small-town high school, falls for nerdy beauty Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne... [More]\n\nDirected By: Kenny Ortega\n\n#4\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 68934%\n\nCritics Consensus: It won't win many converts, but High School Musical 3 is bright, energetic, and well-crafted.\n\nSynopsis: Amid preparations for a basketball championship, prom, and graduation, sweethearts Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) vow...
