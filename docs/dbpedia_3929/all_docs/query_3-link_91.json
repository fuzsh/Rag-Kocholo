        "text": "Each month, we're rounding up the latest local music that's been on repeat. Follow our Spotify playlist to keep up with new music releases from Minnesota.\n\n\"TNT\" by Heart to Gold\n\nThe emo-hardcore band is back with a heavy new scorcher, showcasing the soaring vocals of Grant Whiteoak. The melodic punk band's new album Free Help is out on November 15 on the record label Memory Music.\n\n\"Paranoid\" by Hippo Campus\n\nThe homegrown indie rock band's new album Flood is coming on Sept. 20. \"Paranoid\" is all bouncy and bittersweet indie pop, as the band contemplates a period of mental anguish on the new record.\n\n\"Something's Got a Hold of Me\" by The Cactus Blossoms\n\nThe Cactus Blossoms have a new album: Every Time I Think About You is out on Aug. 30, recorded at Minneapolis studio Creation Audio and featuring cover art painted by Native American modernist George Morrison. \"Something's Got a Hold of Me\" is a summery, folksy gem with breezy harmonies by the brothers Jack Torrey and Page Burkum.\n\n\"Can U Hear\" by Alan Sparhawk\n\nThe Low founder returns with a new electronic smash that sounds like it's blowing up at the seams. The upcoming debut solo album, White Roses, My God, out in September, follows the death of his wife and Low bandmate Mimi Parker to cancer. Co-produced by collaborator Nat Harvie, here, Sparhawk confidently steps into a new sound.\n\n“Fix It, Etc.” by A Piano In Every Home\n\nAfter a hiatus, St. Paul band A Piano In Every Home have a new album Terrible Things, to be released on October 4.. “Fix It, Etc.” is the first single from the new record and is a glimpse into some really nice things, despite the misnomer. It’s an homage to dissecting relationships and laying it under lyrical poetry, full of gorgeous longing that is underscored by wistful guitar riffs.\n\n“Spandrel” by Jacob Pavek\n\nBeautiful, expansive, and ethereal are three ways to describe the work that pours out of pianist Jacob Pavek. “Spandrel” is an instrumental piece that is written around changes in Pavek’s life that took place over the last four years and encompasses emotions that he summons from the depths of his mind. The visionary work is at once a musical out-of-body experience, a celebration, a testimonial, and an embarkment on an adventure that transcends boundaries and genres.\n\n“Take Everything and Scatter It” by Sister Species\n\nWhimsical and fairytale-like, Sister Species weaves a story around forest dwelling and finding new inspiration in life in being bold and brave as you step into the future. “Take Everything and Scatter It” is a nod to the depth and strength of connections and collectively sets an intention to make the song sound familiar yet supernatural. The band succeeds at discovering something otherworldly within the notes.\n\n“Forgiveness/Forgetness” by We Are the Willows\n\nOriginally written for a side project called Inside Voice, Peter Miller reined in the music and reworked the tracks for a new album with We Are the Willows when he realized that was where he was moving toward all along. “Forgiveness/Forgetness” is the band in their vulnerable era and carries with it dense emotions that are all laid bare on the new song. With a focus on production, electronic influences, and poetic lyricism, WATW paints striking soundscapes blending raw, human elements with angular, constructed ones. The piece is a taste of the new album that will be released on August 29.\n\n“Rattlesnake” by Superior Siren\n\nBeckoning the ships to the shallow waters and dangerous rocky shores of Lake Superior, Superior Siren’s call ebbs and flows as their magic weaves a story of capturing a love for pleasure and transformation. It’s also a closer look at bringing light to the dark and summoning the enchantment that we think may have been long-dead. With “Rattlesnake,” Superior has curated a unique song experience that runs a spectrum of sounds."
