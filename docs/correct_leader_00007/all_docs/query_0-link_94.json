        "text": "“While the rest of the world has been improving technology, Ghana has been improving the quality of man's humanity to man.”\n\nMaya Angelou\n\nGhana is a country on the verge of historic change. The maturing of its democratic government, privatization of markets, and increasing development of homegrown solutions and ventures are all beginning to turn the tide in the nation's development. Ashesi's Study Abroad program will give you the opportunity to explore the history, politics, art and culture of Ghana - and to embark on your own journey of discovery in Africa.\n\nYou will never run out of places to see in Ghana. The beautiful landscape is endowed with attractions like the beautiful beaches, waterfalls, Nzulezu (village on stilts) and the monkey sanctuary. The relaxing Aburi botanical gardens a sanctuary from the busy Accra life, located a few kilometers from Ashesi brings you as close to nature as possible. For the adventurous ones, a walk on the Kakum Canopy walk, paragliding, safari and mountain climbing on the Afadjato mountain will surely get your adrenalin rising. World heritage sites such as the Cape Coast castle and other historical and cultural sites like the Pikoro slave camp and the Manhyia Palace offer priceless lessons on the historical and cultural evolution of Ghana.\n\nFormerly a British colony known as the Gold Coast, Ghana was led to independence by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah on the 6th of March, 1957. It became the first black nation in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve independence from colonial rule.\n\nThe country is named after the ancient empire of Ghana, from which the ancestors of the inhabitants of the present country are thought to have migrated.\n\nClimate\n\nTropical; warm, hot and humid in the Southwest and hot and dry in the North\n\nPopulation\n\nThe population of Ghana is divided into some 75 ethnic groups. The estimated population of Ghana in 2012 is 24,652,402 (females-51%, males 49), giving the country an overall population density of 78 persons per sq km (201 per sq mi). The most densely populated parts of the country are the coastal areas, the Ashanti region, and the two principal cities, Accra and Kumasi.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the total population lives in the southern half of the country. The most numerous peoples are the coastal Fanti, and the Ashanti, who live in central Ghana, both of whom belong to the Akan family. The Accra plains are inhabited by the Ga-Adangbe. Most of the inhabitants in the northern region belong to the Moshi-Dagomba or to the Gonja group.\n\nMajor Cities\n\nAccra, the capital, has a population of 10% out of the total population. Kumasi is the capital of the Ashanti region. Sekondi has an artificial harbor and was the first modern port built in Ghana. Other major cities include Tema, Tamale, and Cape Coast. People living in urban areas account for 37 percent of the population.\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish is the official language of Ghana and is universally used in schools in addition to nine other local languages.The most widely spoken local languages are, Ga, Dagomba, Akan and Ewe."
