This article uncovers this history by analysing Nkrumah's overt politicisation of football in the late colonial and immediate postcolonial periods. This study not only makes a novel contribution to the growing historical and social scientific literature on what is arguably Africa's most pervasive popular cultural form but also deepens our understanding of one of the continent's most significant political figures.\n\nKeywords\n\nGhanasportsnationalismpan-Africanism\n\nType\n\nPopular Politics in the 1960s and 1970s\n\nInformation\n\nThe Journal of African History , Volume 54 , Issue 2 , July 2013 , pp. 221 - 246\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021853713000236 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2013\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Whilst a student in England, he served as the joint organising secretary of the Fifth pan-African Congress held in Manchester in 1945 that did so much to revive pan-Africanism, intellectually and politically. Nkrumah subsequently served as general secretary for a working group on pan-Africanism that was established following the Manchester congress and chaired by W. E. B. Du Bois. Shortly before he was invited back to Ghana by the organisers of the United Gold Coast Convention, he had joined a group of fellow committed students in The Circle that was comprised of only the most ardent supporters of pan-Africanism.
