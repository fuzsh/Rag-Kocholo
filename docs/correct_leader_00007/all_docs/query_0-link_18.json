        "text": "Nkrumah’s administration, the 1966 coup, and the return to civilian rule\n\nNkrumah saw independent Ghana as a spearhead for the liberation of the rest of Africa from colonial rule and the establishment of a socialist African unity under his leadership. After the founding of a republic in 1960, the state became identified with a single political party (the CPP), with Nkrumah, as life president of both, taking ever more power for himself. On the Pan-African front Nkrumah’s messianism was increasingly challenged by other leaders of an ever-growing number of independent states. By 1966 his dream of African socialism was foundering under haphazard and corrupt administration, massive foreign debts, and declining living standards. In February, while Nkrumah was in Beijing, army and police leaders rose against him, and his regime was replaced by a National Liberation Council chaired by Lieut. Gen. Joseph A. Ankrah. The machinery of government was overhauled and conservative financial policies introduced. But Ankrah failed to redeem a promise to restore parliamentary democracy, and in 1969 he gave way to the dynamic young brigadier Akwasi Amankwaa Afrifa, a principal leader of the coup. A constituent assembly produced a constitution for a second republic, and a general election was held in August 1969. This resulted in a substantial victory for the Progress Party, led by Kofi Busia, a university professor who had consistently opposed Nkrumah. Busia became prime minister, and a year later a former chief justice, Edward Akufo-Addo, was chosen president.\n\nSeries of coups\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Ghana\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 32,823,000\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nunitary multiparty republic with one legislative house (Parliament [275])\n\nOfficial Language:\n\nEnglish\n\nBut the civilian regime, handicapped by the great burden of foreign debt it had inherited and the low prices then obtained by cocoa on the world market, was slow to produce the results expected of it. In January 1972 impatient army officers intervened again, and the government was taken over by a National Redemption Council (NRC) of military men chaired by Col. Ignatius Kutu Acheampong. The national assembly was dissolved, public meetings prohibited, political parties proscribed, and leading politicians imprisoned. In July 1972 a retroactive Subversion Decree was enacted under which military courts were empowered to impose the death penalty for offenses such as subversive political activity, robbery, theft, and damaging public property, and, from 1973, for the spreading of rumours and profiteering. The military regime was clearly failing to maintain good order or anything approaching a prosperous or stable economy. Ghana’s gross domestic product, export earnings, and living standards began a precipitous decline.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 19, 2024, 1:51 AM ET (BBC)\n\nJojo Wollacott: Crawley Town sign Ghana goalkeeper from Hibs\n\nJuly 18, 2024, 6:52 AM ET (BBC)\n\nSupreme Court judgement on anti-LGBTQ in Ghana today: Apex court delay verdict\n\nJuly 16, 2024, 11:04 PM ET (Reuters)\n\nGhana cocoa output is half of average with harvest almost complete\n\nJuly 15, 2024, 6:47 AM ET (BBC)\n\nDengue fever: Outbreak for dengue fever in Ghana - wetin e be?\n\nJuly 12, 2024, 2:05 AM ET (BBC)\n\nInflation in Ghana: High cost of living cause Ghanaians to find other means of survival\n\nIn 1975 the NRC was reorganized to include some civilians, but ultimate power was given to a Supreme Military Council (SMC). In 1977 the SMC proposed a “Union Government to which everybody will belong,” with no political parties and the military sharing in government with civilians. But a national referendum held to approve this served mainly to show the unpopularity of the SMC. Acheampong was replaced as SMC chairman by Lieut. Gen. Frederick W.K. Akuffo, who was less effective in governing than his predecessor. Eventually, in 1979, as the economy floundered, the government of the generals was overthrown by young officers and noncommissioned officers, led by an air force flight lieutenant, Jerry Rawlings. Acheampong and Akuffo were executed, and a quick return to parliamentary government was organized. But under Pres. Hilla Limann this failed to produce the radical improvements in the political and economic life of Ghana sought by Rawlings and his colleagues. At the end of 1981, Rawlings decided that he and those who thought like him must take the lead in all walks of life, and he again overthrew the government. His second military coup established a Provisional National Defense Council as the supreme national government; at local levels, people’s defense committees were to take the campaign for national renewal down to the grass roots.\n\nInitially, older Ghanaians doubted that Rawlings and his colleagues could provide more effective and less self-interested government than the old politicians or generals, while other young soldiers thought that they could themselves engineer coups to secure the fruits of power. But Rawlings easily snuffed out two countercoups in 1982 and 1983, and it was apparent that there was wide and genuine approval of his purpose of reforming Ghana’s political and economic life. This continued even when he decided that there was no alternative but to follow conservative economic policies—such as dropping subsidies and price controls in order to reduce inflation, privatizing many state-owned companies, and devaluing currency in order to stimulate exports—that would secure International Monetary Fund (IMF) support and other foreign aid. These free-market measures revived Ghana’s economy, which by the early 1990s had one of the highest growth rates in Africa.\n\nJohn D. Fage Donna J. Maier\n\nDemocratic stability\n\nIn 1992, in the first presidential balloting held in Ghana since 1979, Rawlings—representing a new party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC)—was elected president. He was reelected to a second term in 1996 with almost three-fifths of the vote. Despite the economic progress that had been made during Rawlings’s rule, much of the Ghanaian press and many Ghanaian professionals remained highly critical of his economic policies and authoritarian political style.\n\nRawlings stepped down from the presidency in early 2001 and was succeeded by John Agyekum Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the first peaceful transfer of power between democratically elected governments since Ghanaian independence in 1957; Kufuor was reelected in 2004.\n\nIn the December 2008 presidential elections, the NPP’s candidate, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, won the first round of voting but did not secure a majority of the vote. John Evans Atta Mills of the NDC went on to narrowly defeat Akufo-Addo by less that one percentage point in a runoff election fraught with tension. Still, there was a peaceful transfer of power, which was heralded by many observers as proof of Ghana’s democratic stability.\n\nMahama’s ascent to the presidency\n\nMills died in office on July 24, 2012, near the end of his term. Vice Pres. John Dramani Mahama was sworn in as interim president later that day. He later was selected to be the NDC’s presidential candidate in the December 7, 2012, election. Mahama faced seven other candidates, including Akufo-Addo, who again represented the NPP. The electoral commission declared that Mahama was the winner with 50.7 percent of the vote—just enough to avoid having a runoff election with Akufo-Addo, who trailed him with 47.74 percent. Before the results were released, however, the NPP had already made allegations of electoral fraud. After the electoral commission declared Mahama the winner, the NPP filed a petition with the Supreme Court to challenge the results. The court’s verdict, issued on August 29, 2013, dismissed the NPP’s petition and upheld Mahama’s victory; Akufo-Addo accepted the outcome. Meanwhile, Mahama had been sworn in for his first full term as president earlier that year, on January 7.\n\nMahama presided over a period of growing discontent caused by a weakening economy—partly due to declining prices on Ghana’s main exports and growing public wage costs—as well as power shortages and corruption scandals. To address the country’s economic problems, in 2015 the government received a financial assistance package from the IMF to support economic reform.\n\n2015 judicial corruption scandal\n\nOne of the scandals that rocked the country broke in 2015 when a journalist, Anas Aremeyaw Anas, released the results of his two-year investigation into corruption in Ghana’s judicial system. Some 180 judges, magistrates, and other judicial officials were caught on video demanding money from litigants and accepting bribes. Subsequent investigations by the country’s Judicial Council resulted in the dismissal of dozens of the accused, including some High Court judges.\n\n2016 election\n\nThe economy and corruption were two of the main themes during the campaign for the 2016 presidential election. The December 7 poll saw a rematch between Mahama, representing the NDC, and Akufo-Addo, representing the NPP; they were the leading candidates of a field of seven that also included former first lady Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings, representing the National Democratic Party (NDP). Akufo-Addo was declared the winner with almost 54 percent of the vote; Mahama, who followed him with about 44 percent, conceded. Akufo-Addo was inaugurated on January 7, 2017.\n\nAkufo-Addo’s administration\n\nAkufo-Addo’s administration began to follow up on several of his campaign pledges, such as providing free senior secondary education, which was implemented in September 2017. A special prosecutor dedicated to rooting out corruption was appointed in 2018, although he resigned in 2020, citing political interference. A program to boost the economy by getting at least one factory in each of the country’s more than 200 districts was also launched in 2017. Economic growth was strong a year into Akufo-Addo’s term, but progress was halted in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted various sectors of the economy, notably with lower global prices on important exports such as oil and cocoa.\n\n2020 election\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the presidential election was held on December 7. Akufo-Addo faced Mahama again as well as 10 other candidates. Akufo-Addo was reelected in the first round of voting, securing a little more than 51 percent, while Mahama, his nearest challenger, received slightly more than 47 percent. In parliamentary elections held the same day, Akufo-Addo’s NPP and Mahama’s NDC each won 137 seats, with 1 seat being won by an independent. The resulting hung parliament had the potential to slow or impede implementation of Akufo-Addo’s policies and agenda. On December 30, 2020, Mahama filed a challenge to the results of the presidential election with the Supreme Court, alleging that irregularities affected the election outcome and asking for the results to be overturned. While the case was pending, Akufo-Addo was sworn in for his second term on January 7, 2021. On March 4 the Supreme Court rejected Mahama’s challenge, citing a lack of evidence to support his claims, and upheld the results of the election.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
