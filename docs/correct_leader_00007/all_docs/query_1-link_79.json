(The late Kofi Annan was one of the School’s products.)\n\nAlthough I knew Anani, he did not know me because I was too junior to have social interaction with him. We reconnected in Rhode Island when I moved to the state in 2007.\n\nWe met each month at Andreas restaurant for lunch and spoke several times on the phone each week. The topics were wide-ranging but, the story of Africans in the World was always predominant and of course, Ghana, Brazil and USA were central.\n\nMany attributes describe Anani but, I want to focus on five:\n\nKeen Intellect: He was an exceptional scholar of African issues both on the continent and, in the diaspora. He was clearly one of the top experts on African issues. Although a high-level academic, he was able to engage with regular people to exchange views and ideas.\n\nPassionate commitment to improving live conditions of all Africans: He was committed to bringing ideas to the practical level to influence positive change on the ground. I personally spent several hours discussing ways to improve the lives of all Africans around the globe.\n\nKind and Courteous: He was a kind gentleman in every sense of the word. He always reached out to help those less fortunate than himself.\n\nExcellent representation of Ghana in the international arena: A product of Mfantsipim School of Ghana, he made every effort to articulate the debt he owed Ghana and “The School” as we refer to our alma mater. As he lay in the hospital, we sang two songs, \"For All the Saints Who From Their Labors Rest,\" the anthem of The School, and “Ghana Nyigba” an Ewe patriotic song honoring Ghana.\n\nHis connection to the African community in RI: The African community in Rhode Island was proud that one of their own had been a professor for over 40 years at Brown University, an Ivy League School. Many told stories of spending time in his home to cook African food, socialize, and discuss issues affecting our community.\n\nTo Togbi Anani: Your race is done, you represented Ghana, Mfantsipim, and all of Africa very well. Generations will celebrate how you helped the world to gain better insight into all African communities in USA, Brazil, Latin America, Europe, and on the continent. AARI thanks you for making us proud.\n\nRest in Peace, you have earned it.\n\nAARI Board of Directors\n\nLordsfield Anani Dzidzienyo and I roomed together in my senior year at Williams. He was charismatic, engaging, complex and unpretentious, the creature of multiple cultures. A youth in the generation that brought Kwame Nkrumah to power, he’d received a classical English education at the elite Mfantsipim School in Cape Coast. He was first of all African, introducing his less sophisticated suite mates to kente cloth and the wisdom of the ancestors. “The frog,” he would intone sagely, “does not eat peppers for the lizard to sweat.”\n\nHe was ardently nationalist and anti-colonial. As an evening of undergraduate libation progressed on an icy February night, he could elide into the persona of an imaginary radical in an imaginary public square, where he would whip up the masses. “We sang British patriotic songs,” he would exclaim with rising passion, “Britons never shall be slaves. But we WERE slaves!” The revolutionary rhetoric would soar from there. In many ways, he was culturally English—knew more about English history than anyone else I knew and quoted Shakespeare at length. He was also one of the small cadre of worldly West Africans who’d somehow found their way to the small College in the Berkshires. At least one of them allegedly sent his laundry to London by diplomatic courier pouch. The local cleaners on Spring Street couldn’t get the shirt collars right.\n\nNani and I lost touch after college, but mainly I remember the twinkle in his eye, the cackle of his laugh, his slight bemusement (and, I imagine, older-brotherly amusement) at our American insularity, his sensitivity, his generosity of spirit, and the way he so enthusiastically embraced life. He was a unique and precious guy. A gift to those who knew him.\n\nMichael McGill\n\nProfessor Anani was a brilliant scholar, incomparable intellectual, fantastic professor, mentor, friend & family. He made me feel seen in a space that so often disregarded who I was and where I came from. I also know that this was true for so many other students, just more evidence of his profound impact.\n\nBut I hope he realized that I saw him too. The warmth with which he received every single person who walked into his office. The patience with which he listened and always thoughtfully responded. The generosity of inviting us into his home, his classroom and his space. So many people experienced the shining light of Prof Anani, and I hope that through his work, so many will continue to.\n\nProfessor, I promise to always bring my “special eyes and mind to the interrogation of issues” that so many Africans still face today. Thank you for continuously reminding me of who I am and all that I can be.\n\nRest well, and know that your legacy will continue to live on.\n\nNothando Adu-Gyamfi\n\nO Senhor Anani (Nani)\n\nYou began as my advisor and mentor, but you became a father figure to me in the process. Your laughter, your welcoming ear, your reassuring words, your unique manner of pushing one to be their best and have an open heart and mind filled each of us. My tears are flowing interwoven with grief and gratitude.\n\nAnani, thank you for the life-changing impact that you immediately had and continue to have on me and my family. I smile as I recall our broad conversations while I worked in your office daily as an undergraduate student. You showed me the personal and professional impact that professors can have and I wanted to embody all that I learned from you. I am filled with joy reflecting on our once-a-week lunch of chicken shwarma and Cadbury chocolates as you told me stories of your youth in Sekondi and your experiences traveling as a young man. You provided me with an example of possibility. And your humility, scholarship, mentorship, and kindness to the world provided me with an understanding of purpose. I will continue to honor you and your legacy in my work and how I live life.\n\n“Forward Ever, Backward Never”\n\nUm grande abraco. A gente fala, Anani\n\nBeau Gaitors ’08\n\nThe fondest memories of my years in graduate school in the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies are of the time spent with Anani Dzidzienyo, whether it was in his thought-provoking and thoroughly entertaining classes, in his legendary office in Churchill House, or in my favorite space, his apartment on Charlesfield St. filled with African art and the most welcoming vibe imaginable. There he would share with me his favorite treat—single-malt scotch—prepare dinner, play records from Brazil and Ghana, and regale me with stories of his youth in Sekondi-Takoradi, his college years at Williams College during the early 1960s, his advanced studies in London, and of course his travels to Brazil dating back to the early 1970s. His insights into Afro-Brazilian history, culture, and politics had a deep impact on me and have informed how I teach these topics at Tulane University. Just last week, I insisted that my PhD advisee go read his wonderful essay \"The African Connection and the Afro-Brazilian Condition\" from the edited volume Race, Class, and Power in Brazil, one of the key texts of my graduate education. He also taught me about comparative studies of race and ethnicity from a unique quad-continental perspective rooted in his lived experiences in Ghana, the UK, Brazil, and the US. I loved the way our conversations slipped in and out of Portuguese as Anani would insert hilarious expressions he learned from his Brazilian friends. Last year, he left a message on my cellphone, which intend to keep forever, that started \"Christopher boa tarde, Anani falando, I got your message...\"\n\nAfter leaving Brown University, I was always delighted to reconnect with him during his visits to New Orleans, where he lectured at Tulane, and during my occasional visits back to Providence, most memorably when my sister-in-law, Sage Morgan-Hubbard, graduated from Brown. Sage also studied with Anani and is now Assistant Director of the Brown Center for Students of Color. My last visit to Brown was in November 2018 when I participated in an event featuring the Brazilian musician Tom Zé, a participant in the late 60s tropicalist movement—the topic of my dissertation at Brown. Anani was unable to attend the event, having arrived home late that evening from a trip. I was determined to have Tom Zé meet Anani, however briefly, as I had told him so much about this beloved friend and mentor over the years. So on our way back to New York, we swung by his apartment, where Anani greeted us and exchanged warm embraces. I snapped a photo of the two, never imagining that it could have been our last meeting. I am still mourning his passing, but feel truly blessed to have known and learned from this beautiful person. Axé Anani!\n\nChristopher Dunn\n\nFOR ANANI\n\nFor we were nurs’d upon the self-same hill…\n\nTo-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.\n\n----\n\nAnani, no doubt you will remember those lines from Lycidas, the elegy by John Milton we studied for our Cambridge Higher School Certificate only the other day. We know you will remember, retrieve them in pristine form from that prodigious archive of a mind you possess. But somehow, we never thought we will sing the poet’s sorrow song in your behalf any time soon. You always seemed so alive, so ageless, a walking rebuke to those who go on and on about the inevitable decay that time wreaks upon “this mortal coil.” From our first days at The School to these later years, your vivacious spirit never ceased to sparkle, to charm, and to endear you to all fortunate enough to be in your presence. How can we forget your return to Kwabotwe from the New York Herald Tribune Forum in 1960? You came back to us with the halo of the worldwise, a precocious celebrity, inimitably cool before it was fashionable to be cool. How can we forget that walk? Ha!\n\nAnd, Anani, you have done us proud. Your intellectual odyssey has been extraordinary. At its center has been a study of the lives, communities and cultures built in forbidding circumstances and with stubborn resolve by descendants of the women and men forcibly exported from these shores to demonic destinations four centuries ago. Yours has been a sustained quest for knowledge of the African condition in its multiple and intertwined world-historic locations and legacies: the nameless agonies, the unspeakable challenges, the miraculous acts of survival and invention. Of these epicenters of a scattered people’s struggles and enterprises of hope, you devoted especial attention, lovingly, to the Africa-descended people of Latin America, particularly Brazil, mastering their languages and idioms of existence, their stories and their songs. And you shared with us the rich and complex results of your explorations. We are particularly grateful for the exemplary fruit of those explorations, Neither Friends Nor Enemies: Latinos, Blacks, Afro-Latinos, the magnificent book you co-edited and graced with powerful contributions. If there are many more intellectual workers from our nation who have undertaken this exacting and necessary work, their names are not a matter of public knowledge.\n\nAs you go to join the ancestors, Anani, you must know that by virtue of your labours, you are favoured among those who heard Anowa’s rebuke conveyed to us by Ama Ata that “All good men and women try to forget / They have forgotten.” And so you are also favoured among those who elected to heed the seers’ counsel delivered to us by Ayi Kwei that to remember is to help “prepare the future way.”\n\nAnani, mbo na edwuma, mbo mbo. Yeda wo ase pii. Nantsew yie ooo.\n\nMany thanks for work well done. Walk good.\n\nAto Sekyi-Otu\n\nProfessor Emeritus of Social and Political Thought, York University, Toronto\n\nOn behalf of Anani’s Mfantsipim School Classmates\n\nAt one time, I was Head of Staff for my state governor. This was the time when Africa started to become independent. I then organized the visit of the first African Ambassador to my state, Mr. Yaw Banful Turkson, just ten years after Ghana's Independence. We became friends. He was followed by Mr. Kofi Baa Aidoo, of whom I was also a friend.\n\nThen he was replaced by a new ambassador with a name from India, which confused me. Wasiamal was his last name. But among the name Vishnu, one of the Indian deities was Kofi. The name of those born on a Friday. So he was from Ghana. And for several reasons we became friends, despite the fact that he is in the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, some many miles from my hometown. Over the years he was Ambassador to share several projects of interest to Ghana. Then I met one of his brothers, who lived in the USA, Professor Anani.\n\nI found out that Anani had been following me for years and used the material that I used to post on my website. When I met him years later at Brown, he revealed his class material from my website, and other material on Brazilian culture and racial issues. Before this visit to Brown, we exchanged e-mails about the African Diaspora. I said hundreds of emails exchanged. It's what we did! We met for the first time in Salvador, Bahia. Anani, out of courtesy to my wife was speaking fluent Portuguese. We have had an intense friendship over the years that, despite everything, we have not found how to involve our family life.\n\nAnani Dzidzienyo who used to call me Onua, which means brother, and Kofi - Onua Kofi, the name of those born on a Friday, was really a good, dear and admired friend. I have been to Ghana several times, perhaps the country of origin of my ancestors as well, and I have always surprised him with the fact that I was in places in Ghana where he, a Ghanaian, never was there. I miss this friend and I take the opportunity to share all my pains for having lost him.\n\nProfessor Anani Dzidzienyo is resting in peace.\n\nJosé Luiz\n\nAnani and I met by chance in Accra at a US trade fair in late 1961, just before he left for college in the US. We have been best friends ever since. Before leaving Ghana he took me to meet one of his brothers who was then living in his father’s house in Accra, and later to meet his mother in Sekondi. While at Williams, he spent some of his vacation times with my parents in Lowell. After Williams, he moved in with Tom Livingston and me in NYC at Columbia. And then everything—vacations with my parents and siblings, an usher in our wedding, libations at all Ghana I reunions in Gloucester which he attended more often than some Ghana I-ers, and so much more. All while he was a busy full-time professor at Brown.\n\nHardly a month passed where we weren’t on the phone. “Hello chief!” and always laughter and always his Ghanaian humor. His dearest partner in Providence told me that even at the miserable end Anani was actively entertaining the hospital staff. Penny and all will like to know of a wonderful coincidence--Anani’s Providence doctor at the end was a grad of Mfantsipim (1000 Fantes)—Anani’s school. Perhaps Ghana’s best.\n\nIn our last conversation a week ago, I happened to mention something about our both being in a waiting for the end stage of life. His quick comment was that in Ghana they call it that the \"Ghanaian Departure Lounge\" stage of life. There we are. The end of a friendship for us all. The Peace Corps is amazing—we were the first volunteers, 51 of us. And Anani was our first friend and most cherished. Our brother. 59 years.\n\nNewell Flather\n\nAnani was more than a professor to me. He was a mentor and a friend. He gave me the gift of his time and his love. He showed up for me in ways that no one had before. He inspired me to write my first book this past year and I am so sad I did not get the chance to share it with him before he passed. In my book, there is a poem I wrote to honor Anani's impact on my life. I pray it can comfort those who also love Anani dearly.\n\nFor Anani\n\nmy heart feels the gravity of stones tossed across infinite pools of cobalt blue\n\nand the reflection of your heart in the skies of my swollen eyes\n\nmy goodness, you are still\n\nlove personified\n\nand though your touch evades my grasp and my heart\n\nthreatens to crumble\n\nwith each passing day\n\nyour words float within me they comfort my soul\n\nthough this life is finite and fickle\n\nmy heart will forever know the warmth of your smiles my spirit will endlessly toast to the man you are\n\nas mortality rears itself\n\nto the forefront of what seemed unfathomable\n\nI carry myself afloat\n\nupon the clouds of hope you left within me and as I levitate higher\n\nfurther from the ground\n\nI hear your angel voice calling me to ascend\n\nin remembrance of you\n\nThank you, Anani\n\nThank you.\n\nOdemi Pessu\n\nAnani and I met in Rio de Janeiro in July 1970, through a mutual friend from NYC with an Africa connection. He was on his way to live and do research in Salvador for the first time and I had just arrived in Brazil for the first time. We became friends right away and I saw him again in November of that year, when I went to Bahia. We stayed in touch after returning to the States.\n\nI do vividly recall, a few years later, his recounting how he accompanied his brother, who was the Ghanaian ambassador to Brazil, on the visit of the Asantahene (the traditional king of Ghana) to Brazil as the official translator. He had a trove of behind-the-scenes anecdotes, laced with his wonderful humor, about the missteps that important series of diplomatic encounters confronted during Brazil's military dictatorship. In the late 1970s, he invited me to give a talk about banditry in Northeast Brazil to his students. That was when I had the opportunity to see how Anani had managed to make Afro-Brazilian and Diaspora studies an important part of Brown. I realized then just how transformative his teaching had become and how he had found his unique and absolutely deserved place in an academic community where he could thrive.\n\nSubsequently, I was able to send several of my students who visited Berkeley from Brown, back to Anani and his classes for Afro-Brazilian Studies. We stayed in touch a lot until I moved to California in 1982, but afterward, we never lost touch. Since my graduate work emphasized Brazilian and African history, and, earlier, I had lived in Ethiopia, I was so happy to see how Anani was able to synthesize Brazil and Africa back in the day when no one else in academia was doing it. And his efforts just kept getting bigger, such that now Africana Studies at Brown offers a doctoral program and, perhaps more importantly, stands as a beacon for other universities to follow.\n\nAnani, for me and so many others, will always be an unforgettable friend. Thank you for the beautiful commemoration that we could partake of today. It helps to know how many others will miss him.\n\nSaudades de Anani para sempre,\n\nLinda Lewin\n\nFor Anani\n\npresente na memoria, ausente do lugar\n\n----\n\nLUNCH\n\nAnani invited me to lunch at his place shortly after my arrival in Providence and before classes had actually begun. I had joined the Brown Faculty in the Department of Spanish—African-Diaspora culture, history and literature my special interests. It was one of those leisurely long lunches, a typical Anani lunch as I came to learn.\n\nHowever, during this, my first such, what touched and amazed me was the number of phone calls Anani received—at least 6-7. All from former students over the years—some already professors; others in grad school; yet others out in the world, traveling or working. Each of them had come across something Anani had mentioned, told them, taught them, helped them to open their own eyes to; a place he had been, places they’d been together, reflections on newspaper articles, professional journals and the news...There was such connection, love, laughter and sharing in those brief conversations I overheard [call you back shortly; company...lunch...]\n\nI, who come from a family of teachers, and students who had become lifelong friends of certain of their teachers—could not but realize and be thankful that I had come to Brown University, a good and special place, to have such exceptional persons as Anani on its faculty to truly educate students and colleagues—Anani, my friend...and when I left Brown and came down to Howard University in DC—I met and got to know his brother Victor, Professor and Dean in the School of Architecture—whose manner, character and approach to life and students were so like Anani’s, for me another important professional and life transition eased by the Dzidzienyo generosity, friendship, and continuity.\n\nCarol A. Beane, PhD.\n\nAssociate Professor, Retired\n\nHoward University\n\nFor Anani\n\nWe called each other “Brother Chief,\" a sign of affection and recognition of your African birth, your deep commitment to Pan-Africanism as a child of Nkrumah’s Ghana, and my own commitment to historical and contemporary practices of Black Internationalism. There was a British colonial past which we spoke often about, the ways in which boys had to wear short pants. When I first meet you, you sang a song for me, and I stopped in my tracks, as you repeated the lyrics of an old Jamaican political party song which you said was taught to you in your high school by a Jamaican teacher. We wondered together about the ways in which the British Colonial Empire had created a network of colonies, one in which sometimes there was movement between those who were colonized. Jamaica was special for you as you talked about the role of Marcus Garvey in Nkrumah’s thought and politics.\n\nYou had never visited there and when I invited you to present a paper at a conference in Kingston, Jamaica it opened up a new phase in our friendship. We drove around Kingston and I took you to my barber. I introduced you to him and the shop crowded around you because “you were a real African.\" They competed about who would give you a haircut. They wanted to know about Africa and the shop quickly turned into a space where you expressed your extraordinary Pan–Africanism.\n\nFor Africana Studies, you were not just the initial link to Afro-Brazilian Studies and scholarship you were the person who was the Department’s African touchstone. It was your work that brought the remarkable African writer, Ama Ata Aidoo to the Department. It was your voice that debated with one of the seminal figures of African Literature, Ngugi Wa Thiong’o. When we began the Africana film festival and brought Flora Gomes from Guinea Bissau, you were there. Africa never left your soul, you were its embodiment as you reached out to its diaspora. With your passing, we are bereft of that touchstone, that link to an Africa rooted in the deepest anti-colonial aspirations, one which knitted Africa and its diaspora. But your work has been done so, walk good brother chief, your intellectual footprints have taken root.\n\nAnthony Bogues\n\nHow can I properly celebrate the life of perhaps the most thoughtful, magically gentle, and insightful educators I have encountered in my years in the academy? Words (in my hands) fail to do justice to my deep feelings for Anani and all my experiences with him over the past two decades. What particularly stands out to me are two dimensions of this amazing person: Anani’s unrivalled relationship with students and his office! After many department meetings, Anani and I would spend time chatting about our students, their creativity, their intellectual curiosity and their struggles, and how we tried to capture each student’s special characteristics in the letters of recommendations were always writing.\n\nWhat I recall most poignantly is that Anani knew how to step back and let students find their own path, while remaining deeply committed to them. And, then, there was the pleasure entering into his amazing office, packed with books, pamphlets, and letters from floor to ceiling! It was magical. Anani read so widely! I would look for excuses to visit him in his office, just to be in that space and to ask him for recommendations for novels for my nighttime reading. When Anani asked what I was working on or thinking about, he inevitably paused for a few minutes and then pulled out a relevant book. We then talked about the novels we had both read – and what an insightful critic he was.\n\nAnani was the kind of intellectual I aspired to be; I feel so fortunate to know him, both in body and in spirit. Rest in peace, Anani.\n\nLundy Braun\n\nSure, it was a thrill to march once again with my reunion class at the 2015 Commencement. The weekend was great fun, but after all that pomp and circumstance, I felt it somehow was not complete, still missing that certain...oomph. Of course it was, I had not yet seen Professor Anani. I ducked into Churchill House, just in case, and there he was. I had never seen his office before. For the love of books, it was a sight to behold.\n\nIn 1979, I was living in Spanish House at Brown and I noticed a class had started holding its meetings in the conference room near the main entrance. Although I’d had classes at French House, or even in a Professor’s living room, here on Prospect Street, something quite unusual was taking place. Students trickled in early to schmooze with the professor before class! I had no inkling as to what the course was about, but I caught vivid tidbits, and references to particular regional habits. The conversations were fascinating. This teacher seemed to egg them on while elegantly holding court, perhaps interjecting a pointed question here and there, but mostly just listening with his eyebrows raised.\n\nLater I was introduced to Anani at Brown although I did not take his classes, misguided student that I was at the time. I moved to NYC in 1981 and when I met Rose-ann she opened her heart to me, and we have been close ever since. I am moved by the profound tributes pouring in here.\n\nAnani was someone who got to know you so well that he could remember obscure details about family members of yours, even those that he had never met, but had only heard about in conversations. No matter what the subject, every conversation was sparkling. Anani was the ultimate people person. He knew so many people, especially his Brown family, that he sometimes assumed that we must know each other, so he might be pleased to see that we are finally meeting here.\n\nAnani was a meticulous listener. It doesn’t surprise me that his music collection is being archived as well as his books. As a musician, you rarely find someone who can be open and truly listen. When Anani was in the house, he brought good vibes to spare. I had the joy, pride, and privilege of playing entire concerts with my dear friends Anani and Rose-ann in the audience, if not in the front row.\n\nAnani leaves us with gifts of friendship, wonderment, and the love of lifelong learning. Please keep the stories coming. Anani did not talk about himself, and we will always wish to know him better.\n\nLisa Spraragen\n\nDear Anani\n\nI hope you knew this while you were still with us, but certainly you will now know this resoundingly in the afterlife. You changed the course of so many lives, invariably in positive and usually profound ways. In my case, your gentle, almost imperceptible guidance led me not only to study Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa while at Brown, but also to work on human rights and political transitions during residence or long-term stints in various places (Rwanda, the DRC, the Sudans, etc.), and now, believe it or not, I have completed the triangle and ended up in Brazil.\n\nFrom time to time, I still hear your words reverberate in my ears, often when I least expect it, and feel the intense warmth of your laugh and charismatic smile through a moment like this. I am deeply sorry I never had the chance to tell you what a difference you made in my life.\n\nLet me hope that Zoom or the true spirits that guide our existence here know how to transmit this and innumerable other messages to you.\n\nKonrad Huber '89.5\n\nI have tried to write this message many times, but words have failed me. Anani has played and continues to play a pivotal role in my life, in the lives of so many students after me, including my daughter and those from Zimbabwe I worked with to access a Brown education. Anani is the consummate educator - teacher, counselor, advisor and friend all wrapped into one. His infectious laugh, his sharp and probing intellect, his deep-felt compassion and the unique way in which he spurred students to ask questions, think deeper and learn will always stay with me as an educator.\n\nWhenever I had a student going to Brown, I would tell them to try to live on Pembroke, make sure to check out the Swearer Center and of course take a class, any class, with Anani. Most of them did, and none of them regretted it. My daughter, Grace, did the same, and it meant the world to me that Anani taught and influenced us both. It is painful to think that the student who is coming this Fall won't be able to stumble into that Anani world.\n\nAnani gave us all his life requirements - buy a shortwave radio, listen to the BBC News on Africa, wake up early, go to Brazil and learn Portuguese. I didn't follow that last two pieces of advice, but Grace and several Zimbabwean students did, becoming fluent in Portuguese and loving Brazil. As for the former advice, it was all designed to make sure that by waking up early and tuning in your shortwave to BBC, you would be sure to know when there had been a coup in West Africa. In the late 1980s, this was very pertinent advice! I did my best - bought the shortwave, still listen to BBC and living in Zimbabwe, have no choice but to be up when the day starts at 6am.\n\nRebecca Ziegler Mano\n\nAnani had a special power as a teacher, mentor, and a friend. As a teacher and mentor, Anani had this miraculous ability to value your humanity and your contributions, despite his own incredible intellect and wisdom. The word that most comes to mind when I think of his friendship is that it was boundless -- sort of like the books stacked on every open space in his office. He always made sure to take time for a casual conversation about life, offer wisdom on a challenging intellectual issue, or joke cathartically about the various microaggressions and racist acts we had experienced whether in the US, Latin America, or on the continent. My partner and I still reminisce about the incredible dinner he cooked for us at his home in Providence, and that he introduced us cheap college kids to Sherry (wine). However, I still can't get over the fact that this man from Ghana, with such great cooking skills, hated fruit!\n\nI have too many thoughts I could share about how his passion and support have shaped my life, but I'll share one quick story about how I learned that Anani is everywhere. When I was in Ecuador doing research for my undergraduate thesis on Black social movements in the country (which Anani was of course supervising), I stayed at a friend's home in Quito. One day my friend's aunt and uncle stopped by and we got to talking about why I was in Ecuador and who I was working with at Brown. As soon as I mentioned Anani's name, their faces lit up, \"He was our favorite professor!\" they said in unison, \"you have to tell him we say hi when you see him.\" It's interactions like these that I continue to have, far away from Brown's campus, which remind me of the unique and incredible person that Anani was, and assure me that his legacy will endure for years. I consider it an honor to have met him, studied under him, and called him a friend.\n\nAustin Cole\n\nI met Anani through my mother, Rosemarie Freeney Harding, who traveled with him, Maria Ines Lacey, and Warren Witte to Brazil in 1980. As representatives of the American Friends Service Committee, the four were charged with reporting on the state of labor, student, and religious organizing for democracy in the context of the military dictatorship. My mother’s travels awakened an interest in Brazil for me and when I arrived at Brown as a transfer student in spring 1983, one of the first classes I took was Anani’s “Blacks in Latin American Society and Politics.”\n\nAnani encouraged me to study Portuguese and to participate, in 1985, in the inaugural Brown-in-Brazil study abroad program in Salvador, Bahia. It is not an understatement to say that the semester in Brazil was life-changing for me. For the last thirty years, I have been studying, teaching and researching Afro-Atlantic religious and cultural history. Anani’s influence set me firmly on the path of diaspora studies. His networks undergirded my experience in Brazil in important ways. Through Anani, directly or indirectly, I met many of the scholars, artists, community activists and religious leaders who have impacted my life and work as a transnational scholar – including Lelia Gonzales, Luiza Bairros, Isabel Cristina Ferreira dos Reis and Iyalorixá Valnizia Pereira. Through the years, Anani remained a dear friend and mentor. He invited me back to Brown to lecture to his students and he traveled all the way to Denver for my mother’s memorial service in 2004, and later sent me a CD of Aretha Franklin’s Gospel album to help lift my spirits as I grieved.\n\nAnani was such a warm, brilliant and engaging person. He was deeply committed to cultivating relationships as part and parcel of his work as a teacher and scholar. I am so grateful to have been his student. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Rose Ann, and to the other members of his extended family as they mourn his loss. We are all much improved by Anani’s passage through this world. May his memory remain with us as a guide and a blessing.\n\nRachel Harding\n\nIf I had to choose one word, and one word only to describe Anani, that word would be elegant. Actually, I would need two words: extraordinarily elegant.\n\nUpon sight, Anani immediately projected elegance, whether in a traditional Ghanaian shirt or a classic suit and tie or his university gown. His handsome face was an exemplar of elegance with intelligent eyes daring you not to be drawn into conversation and his beguiling smile inviting you to say more, to reveal more, to think more.\n\nAnani was elegant in everything he did: lecturing, moderating a conference, reading a newspaper, shopping, or plucking a thin volume from a rickety retaining wall of books. He was elegant cooking groundnut chicken, and speaking of cooking, here was a man who could, with only a few spices, make something unforgettably delicious and delectable out of anything- sawdust, twine, anything- you name it. Anani was elegant bundled up and trundling home along Thayer Street in a blizzard, or as a survivor of Bahia’s notorious humidity, coolly quaffing a frigid Haffenreffer as others panted in what they perceived to be a heatwave, as he recalled, perhaps, his favorite Top Five great moments in the history of The Greatest Game.\n\nThere was the impish elegance, when, and with no small vindication, he finally was able to place a big fat red X on the last of the faces on his renowned African strongman poster on his office wall in Churchill House.\n\nThe elegance of Anani’s intellect and prodigious scholarship was even more elegant than his external elegance, and to experience his teaching was a marvel to behold. He had an elegant voice with a wonderful lilt, and his laugh, well, maybe not elegant, sure made you feel good if not laugh along. And his views and opinions were always eloquently and elegantly expressed as he talked about the history and politics of favelas and fazendas and demon rum and rebellions and slave ships.\n\nBut the most exquisitely elegant thing about Anani was his friendship, and if you were blessed and lucky, a long and enduring one to be remembered forever.\n\nSaravá, Anani.\n\nJosh Elbaum\n\nAnani and I go back to 1955, the year we entered Mfantsipim School, Ghana’s first secondary school located on Kwabotwe Hill in Cape Coast. Among our Old Boys was Kofi Annan who was a couple of years ahead of our class. Anani and I studied practically the same subjects, among them English, French, Latin and Greek. We were part of a group of five students in our year group who took ancient Greek. We were immersed mind, heart and soul in the traditions of the school. With extreme modesty we called it The School. In our last year I was the Head Prefect and Anani the Vice, all very old school British.\n\nA bond of personal affection, academic interests and apprenticeship in borrowed colonial traditions united us. We loved it all madly at the time. And of course, both of us ended up turning away from our Eurocentric formation and made the African world, homeland and diaspora, the major object of our intellectual lives and commitments in a kind of rebellion against our formative years. Just a few weeks before he passed away, he told me in an email that he was contemplating writing an intellectual autobiography and wondered if that was not “hubris.” I replied enthusiastically that there was nothing hubristic about that intention, that he was unique among our schoolmates and indeed Ghanaians who have travelled the intellectual journey he had, and that such a book would be a gift. Alas…\n\nAto Sekyi-Otu, Emeritus Professor of Social and Political Thought, York University, Toronto Canada\n\nThank you, Anani, for giving me the opportunity to finally see myself in my studies. Blacks in Latin American History and Society was the FIRST class that I signed up for as an incoming freshman and just seeing that this course was offered, told me that Brown was the right place for me. Not only did your class excite me to begin my studies, your knowledge, light, and energy got me through not only my first semester, but my first year (because you know I had to take Afro-Brazilians and the Brazilian Polity in the spring).\n\nYour courses deepened my connection to my Afro-Antillean Panamanian heritage, and to Africa. Whenever you would laugh, which was often, I saw my father's face in your cheekbones, eyes, and grin. This gave me such comfort and also made me want to look into my genealogy (to no real surprise, I'm part Ghanaian!).\n\nYour smile, sense of humor, and genuine care for your students was unmatched and running into you on campus was always the highlight of my day. Brown will not be the same without you, but your legacy will live on through the many people whose lives you've touched.\n\nI cannot thank you enough and you will always be in my heart.\n\nYahellah Best\n\nI first met Anani in c. 1986 in Salvador da Bahia. I was doing research on abolition and post-abolition in the city of Salvador and province/state of Bahia. We stayed in touch. While teaching in Hartford, Ct., Anani graciously came over for a day and gave a great presentation. In January 1991, I received my PhD from UConn in Storrs. Title: From Slavery to Freedom in Brazil: Bahia, 1791-1900. That longue duree was shortened to 1835-1900 when the book was published.\n\nExactly thirty years ago this month, not sure of the exact day, this insecure recent PhD drove from Storrs to Providence to give Anani a copy of the dissertation (perhaps 450 long pages, a big pile). Anani took me and the dissertation to the Faculty Club at Brown. I remember lots of polished brown wood. Anani placed the dissertation in the middle of the table, and several professors stopped by to offer congrats. From the translated title of one of Brazil's epic novels, it remains an \"invincible memory\" for me.\n\nWe kept in touch in the years that followed. Anani met my daughter and I for dinner near the Brown campus as we visited colleges and universities on the east coast. It meant so much to me.\n\nI teach several courses here on the frontier of north Idaho (University of Idaho, Moscow Idaho). Three of the titles are Slavery and Freedom in the Americas, Comparative African American Cultures, and The Atlantic World. Anani, and the orixas, helped me every step of the way in forging these critically important courses.\n\nDale Graden\n\nAnani Dzidzienyo\n\nFirst, I offer my deepest condolences to Professor Anani Dzidzienyo’s partner and to his family.\n\nMy time at Brown blessed me with wonderful memories about Professor Dzidzienyo, whose boundless archive, wisdom, generosity, and care guided and transformed several generations of Brown students, including me. Thanks to a gift from the ancestors, I was assigned to, not my first, but my second choice of Curricular Advising Program (CAP) courses: Anani’s “Blacks in Latin America” course. This program brilliantly pairs students with the instructors of one of their courses as an academic advisor. I remember our first group advising meeting in the second floor of Churchill house almost twenty-five years ago - in a space I think is now occupied by a conference room. I found a home in his mile-wide smile, his questions about and interest in who we were and who our people were, and eventually, in his office. Anani’s course was the first time I saw the history of my people in an academic context. He introduced us to so many texts that would go on to fundamentally shape my outlook on the world and my sense of my place within it. He invited us to bring our whole selves into class and got to know us, our aspirations, and our stories.\n\nHungry for his care, his wisdom, his questions, and his stories, I went on to take three more courses with Anani. I visited his office constantly even when I wasn’t enrolled in one of his classes. In the smaller seminars, he often cooked delicious meals for us in his home, telling us stories about Kwame Nkrumah and other luminaries in the global Black freedom struggle. When I visited him just before my senior year, upon returning from studying abroad at the University of the West Indies, Anani actually assigned me a paper to reflect on my time in Barbados - and I actually wrote it even though it wasn’t for a class (now I know from others’ reflections that he gave all kinds of assignments)!\n\nMy parents could not wait to meet Anani during my graduation to express their gratitude for taking care of my mind and spirit in ways they could not. I cannot comprehend how Anani made space to mentor, to love, to listen to, to challenge, and to nurture so many of us across so many decades. He was always present. Always generous. And always joyful. Thank you for being a teacher, a friend, a mentor, a model, and a guide.\n\nWith gratitude for everything you poured into us,\n\nBesenia Rodriguez ‘00\n\n\"He Taught Me How to Roast a Chicken\"\n\nI first found out about Anani from a friend who had just graduated from Brown: Erica Hanson. Erica took out the big book of Brown classes and circled his name. She told me to take whatever Anani taught. It didn’t matter. Every class was brilliant. So I took Civilian and Military Politics in West Africa. And it was brilliant. Because Erica had smoothed the way, Anani and I became fast friends. Everyone loved him. He was so humble and kind and hilarious and fun and brilliant. And that laugh!\n\nOnce I invited Anani to my off-campus apartment to have dinner with myself and my roommate, Maria St. John. I was really nervous. I planned the dinner, but I had no idea how to cook it. When he got there, dazzling and fun as usual, nothing had been prepared. I was mortified. I had a chicken but I had no idea what to do with it. Anani said no problem, it’s easy. He quickly trussed the chicken and seasoned it and popped it into the oven. The dinner necessarily stretched on for hours and every minute was a gift. Every time I roast a chicken I think of him. He turned around what could have been a shame spiral disaster and made it fun. Thank you Anani.\n\nHe even tried to find me a husband. I called him once after a breakup, afraid I would never find a mate. He quickly got to work and found someone for me to meet. What did I do to deserve this kindness? Eventually I did find a fantastic partner and invited Anani and his partner to our wedding. And they came! It was such an honor to see them there. I want to cry right now just thinking about how happy it made me that they bothered to come and took time out of their own amazing lives. After my husband read Anani's obituary in the BDH, he said, \"I cannot believe that guy came to our wedding!\" Anani was so humble, one would never know.\n\nWhen I first found out Anani had died, I was devastated with regret. I wished I had been there for him as he had been for me so many times. I still regret it, and also I trust. I see how many of you are out there who also loved him and I trust that he was beloved by hundreds of people, even more. I trust that he had all the support he could handle and then some. And I trust that he was tired of being sick. I wish he could be here today physically, but I know he is here with us, inside all of us who loved him so deeply. And I trust that he is enjoying the view.\n\nI love you Anani. Thank you for being you. One in a million.\n\nKiki Roumel\n\nDecades prior to higher education recognizing the value of an Ethnic Studies Department, I was a student at Brown University seeking such, but not finding it. I knew that I wanted to be a journalist and follow in the footsteps of the late Brown alum, Ron Hutson. I knew Ron because he lived in my Roxbury, Boston neighborhood, graduated from Brown with a Political Science major, wrote for the Boston Globe, and had won a Pulitzer for writing articles about school segregation that ended up motivating the City of Boston to desegregate the Boston Public School system.\n\nWhen Ron was at Brown, nothing offered academically really helped him prepare for the world of journalism. He did it on his own. I did not have to do it on my own because I had Anani. Under his guidance, I majored in Latin American Studies, an independent major. His vast knowledge of that subject and the degree he arranged for me helped me when I graduated from Brown and applied for a job as a journalist in Southern California where many people with Mexican and Latin American backgrounds live and work.\n\nThe world needs more professors like Anani who will provide the knowledge and courses to help fulfill students' dreams instead of forcing them into departmental boxes meant to justify the employment of professors. In recent years, I've taught full time as a university professor. I hope to teach journalism and writing for TV and Film at Brown. I know there is no department that provides that, but Brown students track me down all the time for advice and help in that field. I'm sure that many of Anani's former students feel the same need to do for others what he did for us...provide a pathway guiding us to our dreams.\n\nMissing you.\n\nSkye Knight Dent\n\nDearest Anani,\n\nI wish you could see and hear the wonderful tributes and memories that people have been sharing from around the world to celebrate and honor your amazing life.\n\nIt is remarkable, but not surprising, that people have extolled your kindness, charm, humor, warmth and humanity at least as much as people have praised your scholarship, teaching, academic achievements and wisdom.\n\nThank you for being a great teacher in the academic classroom and in the classroom of life. I feel fortunate that I took two classes with you and that you advised me on my honors thesis in international relations, which I wrote about the impact of British law on traditional systems of administering justice in the Gold Coast and Kenya. I still often think of lessons I learned from you about race, perception, bias, language and human beings as well as the interdisciplinary nature of academics and life. I am also deeply grateful I had the opportunity to develop a friendship with you and Rose-Ann, and I was so happy you both attended my wedding to Alison.\n\nI will treasure so many wonderful memories, including meeting two of your brothers, one visiting from Ghana and the other from Washington, D.C., all three together for the first time in many years, your surprising me by inviting my brother, a Brown student, to join us for dinner once, great conversations over Korean food in New York City, Japanese food in São Paolo, ground nut stew in Providence, enjoying your hearty laugh and hearing you call me Grossmint, a nickname from the days when I often ate and gave out mints. As in, “Oh, Grossmint, I read 16 newspapers before lunch today.”\n\nI have very fond memories of the last time I saw you, about three years ago when I attended my reunion with Alison and my stepdaughter, Zoë. We visited you in your office, which my fellow alum Ben Moser aptly described as an artist’s studio in a great piece he posted on this virtual memory wall. From the moment we walked in, you enthusiastically greeted us and launched right into telling Zoë the story of when we first met at your office hours many years before Zoë was even born, including teasing me about what I was wearing and my shy demeanor back then. And you asked her thoughtful questions about her plans and our visit to RISD.\n\nAnani, thank you for being a wonderful teacher, friend and mensch and for enriching the Brown community and the world.\n\nWith gratitude, peace and love,\n\nAmy Grossberg ‘88"
