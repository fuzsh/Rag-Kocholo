        "text": "Nkrumah’s stronghold on power, his bitter rivalry with the Asantes and other groups, and the controversial laws that he had passed jailing some of his political rivals made him a target for violence, symbolically and physically. During his presidency as mentioned in chapter 6, an Asante man had threatened violence against the construction of a new statue of Nkrumah in Kumasi in 1957, while his Accra statue was actually bombed in 1961. There were also several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Nkrumah himself. In Dark Days in Ghana, Nkrumah recalled that “members of the police and Special Branch have been involved in each of the six attacks made on my life, and have frequently ignored, and sometimes aided, the activities of people they knew were plotting to overthrow the government.”1 One such assassination attempt occurred nine months after the bombing of his statue in Accra. On August 1, 1962, according to Nkrumah and Milne, a grenade attack orchestrated by “leading police officers” in collusion with Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, “one of the ringleaders in the plot to kill me,” was made on Nkrumah’s life in Kulungugu in northern Ghana. During this unsuccessful attack, several people lost their lives, including a child, and 55 people were injured.2 Other attempts on and conspiratorial plots against Nkrumah’s life and coup schemes were carried out beginning with the bombing of his residence on November 10, 1955 (attributed to NLM supporters); in 1958 (pinned to various Opposition party officials, including J. B. Danquah, Reginald Reynolds Amponsah, Modesto Apaloo, Joe Appiah, Kofi Busia, and Victor Owusu); and on January 1, 1964, when a policeman stationed at Flagstaff House fired four shots at the president, but missed.3"
