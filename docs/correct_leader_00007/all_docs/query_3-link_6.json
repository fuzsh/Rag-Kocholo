A referendum in February 1964 on Ghana becoming a one-party state resulted in a landslide victory for the Kwame Nkrumah and the CPP government. There were hardly any votes against the one-party state in all the regions.[12] A year later in June 1965, all 198 candidates of the CPP for parliament were elected unopposed.[13] In February 1965, Nkrumah reshuffled made a big change to his government. Twelve new ministers were appointed and many others changed portfolios.[14]\n\nPortfolio Minister Time frame Notes President Kwame Nkrumah[15] 1 July 1960 – 24 February 1966 Minister for Foreign Affairs[3] Imoru Egala 1960 – 1961 Ebenezer Ako-Adjei[15] 1961 – 1962 Kwame Nkrumah 1962 – 1963 Kojo Botsio[16] 1963 – 1965 Alex Quaison-Sackey[17] 1965 – 1966 Minister for Defence Charles de Graft Dickson[18][2] 1960 – 1961 Kofi Baako[15][19][2] September 1961 – 24 February 1966 Minister for Interior[3] A.
