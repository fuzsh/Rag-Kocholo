        "text": "The Accra West Region\n\nAccra West Region is one of the three operational regions of Ghana Water Company Limited in the Greater Accra Region, with the other two being Accra East and Tema Regions.\n\nThe Region stretches from the Kwame Nkrumah Circle and encompasses the western section of Accra, along the coast to Kasoa. It is bounded on the North-East by the main Accra-Kumasi highway, up to Pobiman.\n\nThe major communities in the Region include Korle-Bu, Kaneshie, Awudome Estates, Avenor, Mamprobi, Chorkor, Russia, Bubuashie, Odorkor Dansoman, Darkuman, Kwashieman, Abeka Lapaz, Sowutuom, Mallam, McCarthy Hill, Weija, Bortianor, Nyanyarno, Kasoa and Amasaman.\n\nWater Supply in Accra West Region\n\nWater supply currently does not cover the entire Region. This is because the existing water distribution network is not enough to match-up with the rapid expansion of the new communities, especially in the Kasoa, Anyaa and Ablekuma areas.\n\nThe supply coverage for the Region is about 60%, and the current total customer strength for the Region is 117,312 (as at April 2020). There are plans underway to embark on sustained pipeline extension projects within the corporate approved planning scheme in the Region.\n\nThe GAMA Project has also helped in expanding the supply network and improving distribution in some low-income communities in the Region.\n\nSource of Supply\n\nThe major source of water to the Region is from the Weija Treatment Plant. About 130,160 cubic meters/day (29 MGD) of the water from Weija is retained in Accra West Region for distribution.\n\nWater demand within Accra West Region is mostly for domestic purposes. There are however a number of low-scale business units, shops, hotels, restaurants and educational institutions scattered across the Region. The few factories located within the Industrial Area are not major water consumers."
