        "text": "Approved For Release 2001/66TINts. CIA-RDP80 .5 JUN 1972 TIIMMUNA11-2: T STATINTL ST. CLAM DRAKE ? Mr. Drake was head of the Department of Sociology at the University of Ghana from October 1958 to February 1961. He returned to Ghana in 1965 as a visicing professor at the university's Institute of African Studies. Today, Mr. Drake is a professor of anthropology and sociology at Stanford Uhiversity and chairman there of the Program in African 'and Afro-American Studies. ? ? When Kwame Nkrumah, former President of the Re- public of Ghana, died on April 27, he was in the sixth year of an exile imposed upon him by a military coup d'etat. Nkrumah was out of the country when the over- throw came, en route to Hanoi for the publicly announced purpose .of persuading Ho Chi Minh to open peace nego- tiations with President Lyndon Johnson. But Nkrumah also ? took with him a group of advisers on trade and finance, presumably to seek vital financial aid in Moscow and Peking that Washington was refusing to give Ghana. ?A high point in verbal euphoria between Ghana and the United States had occurred a month earlier, when .Nkrumah dedicated the Volta River dam and praised the United States for the $160 million it lent in 1961 for the, publicly owned hydroelectric project and the .alurhinum smelter owned by Kaiser and associates. Then Nkrumah took off to visit the East, since the United States Government had made clear that criticisms ex- pressed in his resent book, Neocolonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism, and what Americans called his ir- responsible extravagance, had put an end to his hope of getting aid in raising $300 million desperately needed for . payments on short-term loans. But Ghana's policy of \"positive nonalignment\" did not concede that an approach to the East was an act hostile to the United States. The coup came while Nkrumah was in Peking, the United States recognizing the junta within three days and. proffering immediate financial assistance. Whatever pro- Nkrumah resistance there had been evaporated quickly, and the deposed head of state accepted Sekou Toure's invitation to come to Guinea as co-President, since the Ghana-Guinea Union established in 1958 had never been dissolved. The extent of American complicity in Nkrtimah's overthow, if any, will not be assessed until State Department archives are opened several decades ? from now. A comment appearing in s New York Times obituary the day after his death was announced is, how- ever, significant: ? ? Mr. Nkrumah suggested that the \"criminal insurrec- , /lion\" was the work of the imperialists, sp.gcifically the 'United States Central Intelligence Agency. Although neutral observers did not discount his allegation in view ? of increasingly warm relations with the Soviet Union and China, they also noted that Mr. Nkrumah had per- mined power to go to his head and had become a despot who had alienated thousands of his once fervent supporters. (Author's italics.) The implication is that the Americans might have moved against him, but that the success of the coup to be explained in 144019rdEfliletdriE013iReriSatSekiedaii hint that power had gone to his head may be found in Newsweek's comment that \"T 77 - 1 his way to Hanoi to seek an African solution to the Vietnam war when, during a stopover in Peking, he learned that he had been overthrown. . .\" (Author's italics.) The American press was jubilant when the military and police seized power in Ghana. A widely disseminated picture accompanying the news showed a statue of Nkrumah lying on the ground, presumably toppled by an irate people fed up with his arrogance and tyranny. The statue had stood in Accra since the early 1950s, a modest, life-size creation in front of the legislative as- sembly. The Western press had seldom mentioned it be- fore, except in 1961, when some members of the Ga tribe expressed grievances against the government by bombing it. Two of Nkrumah's maxims were carved on its base: \"Seek Ye First the Political Kingdom and All Other Things Shall Be Added Unto Thee,\" and: \"The Liberation of Ghana Is Meaningless go Me Without the Liberation of All of Africa.\" The statue seemed to sym- bolize to journalists what they referreno as Nkrumah's. \"megalomania,\" \"narcissism\" and \"despotism.\" Rumor multiplied the number and size of such monuments, al- legedly erected at Nkrumah's insistence between 1960 and 1966. Psychoanalytic jargon was useil to explain his acts. In addition to a fixation on statues, existent 'and non- existent, Western journalists added \"blasphemy\" to what- ever political 'sins they attributed to Nkrumah by ats- torting and misinterpreting a historical event. When ? Ghana adopted a new constitution in 1960 to transform the country from a British dominion with the Queen as head of state into a republic with an African President elected for five years, the' legislative assembly was re- decorated in African style. The traditional staff of office' carried by a chief's linguist was substitnted for the British mace in ceremonials, and the role of President was in- vested with chiefly attributes. So, the. title, \"Osagyefo,\" was added to 'President.\" This word means in the Akan languages \"Warrior Chief Who Defeated .the Enemy and Saved the Nation.\" Time, however, like other magazines and newspapers, insisted upon translating it as \"Saviour\" and \"Redeemer,\" thereby giving it overtones of divinity. Insofar as the term \"Redeemer\" was ever associated with the title \"Osagyefo\" it would only have been in the sense that Southern anti-Republicans during Reconstruction called themselves \"Redeemers,\" or Marcus Garvey spoke of the \"redemption of Africa\" from colonialism. Yet, in Commenting on Nkrumah's death, Time, in addition to presenting a very unflattering photograph, captioned its' article \"Death of a Deity.\" This was echoed by other pub- lications?thus, the San Francisco Sunday Examiner and Chronicle headed its obituary \"The Redeemer Dies.\" Time's \"Death of a Deity\" article referred to Nkrumah's \"despotic ruling style,\" describing it as \"devious, ruthless, and thoroughly effective.\" The New York Tunes diag- nosed him as being afflicted with \"galloping megalo- mania\" and \"narcissism.\" Newsweek commented that \"several attempts on his life only drove him to new levels of megalomaniacal excesses.\" Those of us who lived and worked in Ghana between 1958 and 1965 do not recog- . or in The New York Times's charge gat rum insti- tuted \"one-man rule .clothed in sycophancy.\" The de- 08/04itivelcSARDPM01801R019 SVCIOROticer ypic a y e ougi tie was on ?

French President Charles de Gaulle offered %a so-called \"choice\" to France's West African colonies i a place within the French Union (a euphemism for French neo-colonialism) or a total, abrupt severance of all formal ties with the \"mother- country. Alter long and varying periods of plunder by French imperialism, all but one colony decided they couldn't make a clean break with their dependent status. It was obvious that de Gaulle had manipulated and counted on just that reaction. Some 14 years later, most of the countries that followed his script have yet to gain true national liberation. The one colony that picked up de Gaulle's other option was Guinea. To the surprise and fury of Paris. President Sekou Toure led his finanCially bankrupt people out of the French -embrace. For the colonial , metropolis, his decision was as intolerable (as a precedent for others) as was -Fidel ? Castio's opting out of the U..S. empire in Latin. America. Every conceivable measure was devised to make an eXample of the uppity upstart from \" Guinea. All programs .of economic aid in .every field were abruptly terminated. Teachers. doctors, technicians and other . experts were summoned home to France, leaving behind a trail of economic sabotage and a colonized people with almost none of the educated cadres needed to keep a society afloat. Toure acceded to \"Power,\" only to find that his treasury had been literally - rifled by the departing French \"civiiizgrs\" and that the free and in- dependent country was on the verge of collapse and imminent starvation. 6, I ,character, sections of the- Western press periodically invented \"rifts\" between the two close friends. Numerous assassination attempts, usually traceable to outside intervention, dotted Nkrumah's years in power. In one instance, by unintentionally arriving a few 'minutes late for a dedication ceremony, he, avoided being killed by a time-bomb planted in a bouquet of flowers that had been given to a small child to present to him. Knowing how eagerly the West sought his ouster because of his strong anti-colonialism, Nkrumah was naive to absent himself iron; home and thereby to make a coup that much easier tostage. From reports at the time, British intelligence seemed to have played the major outside role in the coup, with the CIA lending active support. Those two closely meshed agencies may well have instigated the naive and futile Vietnam \"peace mission\" . that Nkrumah allowed the British prime minister and other Commonwealth leaders to talk him into undertaking. As long ago as 1966, both Hanoi and the National Liberation Front' of -South Vietnam had already made clear the basic terms on which the war could be settled and there was no role for the London- dominated British Commonwealth to play in reaching such a settlement. Knowledge of neo-colonialism By no means should it be implied that Kwame Nkrumah had no understanding of the devious workings of imperialism. That he knew much about his enemies is clear from his 1965 book \"Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism,\" which he dedicated to \"the freedom fighters of Africa, . living and dead.\" While Nkrumah was in power, his country was a home away from home for countless Solidarity in practice African exiles and liberation fighters. In the Into this dire gap stepped President early 1960s, our own W.E.B. DuBois and his Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, with $20 million wife gave up their U.S. citizenship to move to tide Guinea over the immediate crisis. For to Accra and to become highly honored a country itself only a year or so out of the citizens of Ghana. Nkrumah personally sponsored DuBois' last great scholarly grip of classic British Colonialism, $20 undertaking (at age 90): the projected 10- million was a good-sized loan that probably year editorship of an encyclopedia of Africa put a strain on Ghana's own treasury. (Shortly after the 1966 coup, DuBoise. But it saved the day for Sekou Toure. who widow, Shirley Graham, left Ghana.) remained eternally grateful.

Both \"in retrospect and in analysis, it is clear that Brussels had not the slightest intention of giving up its control over that colony's priceless resources. The quick, greased downfall of Congo Premier Patrice Lumumba had been plotted long before the formal lowering of the Belgian flag in June 1960 at so-called independence ceremonies. Former UN diplomat Conor Cruse O'Brien and others have thoroughly documented the record of Belgian-British-U.S. duplicity. UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold ,allowed the world organization to be used in the re-enslavement of the Congo. By the autumn of 1960, when events were closing in on the trusting Lumumba?events that culminated in his foul and brutal murder in February 1961?Kwame Nkrumah, as president of Ghana, wrote to him with the classic warning: \"The only colonialist or imperialist that I trust is a dead one.\" Believing that the UN would playa neutral, role. Lurnurnha (to N'rrtrrIll's clisnvw) had called in UN forces after a Belgian-insti,gatea rebellion in his own army. Had Nkrumah not died of cancer while under medical treatment in Bucharest, might he ultimately have regained power? No one Can say for sure. But an official invitation to return home to Ghana after the recent overthrow of the repressive pro- Western regime amounted to a vindication of his efforts, if not of his complete ad- ministrative record, as father and first president of his country. After six years, the right wing generals of Ghana and their civilian supporters had shown they had no socio-political-economic program to r;teet the many problems of a new nation. The policy of reopening Ghana to unlimited western investment and exploitation had 41'orsened the economy and the condition of the people. Discontent was massive. Corruption was everywhere. Universities were closed because the students were in active rebellion.

The peo- ple of this troubled but newly hopeful little West African country think they offer a les- son to the dozens of other new :nations of Africa and Asia: 'don't try to purchase rapid economic progress at the price of the people's liberty. . But the foregin minister of ? Ghana, Victor OWLISU, is con- vinced that all the nations of 'Africa will learn that bitter lesson the way Ghana did ? by going full circle from a liberal democracy to dictator- ship to military rule and even- tually back to a democratic civilian government. Ghana's passage full-circle was tragic, classic, and rapid. When the British turned power over to Kwame Nkrumah in 1957, Ghana appeared to be a model of democracy which other countries might emulate. But, as B. J. Darocha, general secretary of the ruling Prog- ress party, explains it, Nkru- mah became a hero because of lucky timing. He confused luck with some special or superna- tural quality in himself. As he got more and more in trouble, he reacted as all des- pots have done and will do? be shut the people off. Almost ham before Ghanaians knew it, Nkrumah had closed down newspapers that printed the slightest criticism of him. He put political opponents in - jail, some of them to die there. With the advice of the Rus- sians, he set up a private army and a network of secret police and informers to insure his personal safety and the maintenance of his power. With the help of the Chinese Communists, he set up secret camps to train Africans from other countries to go home and overthrow their governments, a scheme Ghana's present leaders claim was part of Nkrumah's dream of becom- ing emperor of Africa. Within eight years, Nkru- mah had transformed Ghana into a pro-Communist police state. In doing so he had wrecked the economy to the point that basic foods and medicines were not available to ordinary citizens. Ghanaians are galled by blacks in the United States or the West Indies who persist in arguing that the overthrow of Nkrumah in February 1966 was engineered by the CIA and/or British intelligence. I asked Prime Minister K. A. Busia about foreign involve- ment. He simply recounted ft Enters STATI NTL ei New Phase what he called Nkrumah's tyr- anny, adding that the whole country gave its support to the military people who overthrew him. Ghana has just dissolved the Presidential Commission, the three-man body headed by Lt. Gen. A. A. Afrifa, which has been serving as head of state, since a single civilian will soon be elected head of state. And it is a point of considera- ble talk here that the constitu- ent assembly drafted a new constitution setting 40 as the minimum age of a President. This rules out Afrifa, the main figure in Nkrumah's overthrow, for he is 36. The new constitution was clearly designed with the intention of preventing the rise of another Nkrumah. \"You cannot sacrifice per- sonal freedom for economic development,\" the deputy speaker of parliament told me. \"Personal security must stand first, for all else flows out of that.\" \" In pursuit of personal securi- ty, Ghanaians have given their /courts power over actions of the executive branch that seem to exceed the powers of the U.S. Supreme Court. But already Ghanaians note uneas- ily the angry reactions of Bus- ia and the ruling group when the courts decide against them on important matters. The people are also saying that constitutional safeguards - are of dubious value where the: government controls the radio and television stations and vir- tually all the newspapers. I asked Darocha if he felt the constitution was impregna- ble or if it could be subverted by another would-be dictator. \"The new constitution can be run over as easily as the peo- ple will permit,\" he said. All Africa must be watching these days, what with Uganda apparently where Ghana was just prior to Nkrumah's over- throw, with Nigeria under mil- itary rule but looking for a return to civilian control, and a lot of other countries some- where along that rocky circle that Ghana has just negotiat- ed. But Ghanaians expressed cer- tainly that they have learned something from the past, something about the need to resist at the outset preventive detention laws and the similar, tools of tyranny. And they . seem happiest to have learned that a small new African coun- try has proved durable enough to survive a fling with autocra- cy and near chaos.
