        "meta_description": "On March 6, 1957, Ghana became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve independence from a European colonial power. The new state was made up of the former British colony of the Gold Coast and the Trusteeship Territory of Togoland. The country's first prime minister (and later president) was Kwame Nkrumah (1909-72), a U.S.-educated political activist who led the fight for independence from Britain. In this speech, delivered to the parliament of Ghana and circulated internationally by the country's newly-established embassies, Nkrumah gave a progress report on the first six months of independence. He emphasized three themes - non-alignment in international affairs, economic development, and the importance of improvements in education and social services. He also spoke of the need to show \"how an African society can be transformed without losing its essentially African character. We must seek methods by which the old and the new can be blended.\" World Digital Library.",
