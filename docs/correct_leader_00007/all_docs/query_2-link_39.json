Arising at a time when Nkrumah was moving away from welfarism in favor of a ‘big push’ for industrialization, rehabilitation sought to integrate disabled citizens into the national economy as productive workers. Nkrumah's program was preceded by a colonial rehabilitation project during the 1940s for disabled African soldiers. The colonial initiative drew heavily on the British model of social orthopaedics, which equated citizenship with work. This philosophy resonated with Nkrumah's vision of national development based on full employment. Although its economic focus had troubling implications for citizenship and welfare, Nkrumah's rehabilitation program was unique among newly independent African states, and it arguably produced a positive legacy.\n\nKeywords\n\nGhanadevelopmenthealthwelfare\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nThe Journal of African History , Volume 52 , Issue 2 , July 2011 , pp. 179 - 199\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021853711000260 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2011\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

During the 1950s, the Annual Reports of the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development made no mention of disability policy except for the provision of public funding to the Ghana Societies for the Blind and Deaf. The Ghana Society for the Blind was most active, running a school in Akropong as well as two vocational training centers in Accra and Bolgatanga. Support for the deaf began in 1959, when the Government began to support an experimental mission school. See for example Ghana, ‘Annual Report of the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development, 1959’ (Accra, 1960), 13–15; Ghana, ‘Annual Report of the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development, 1960’ (Accra, 1962).\n\n7\n\n7 Michael Cowen and Robert W.

H. and L. J. Lewis Hilliard (eds.), Perspectives in Mass Education and Community Development (London, 1955), 36–40. As Cooper observes, this project sought to protect peasant production in order to limit the drift into urban wage employment, which could lead to social unrest caused by labor protest. Significantly, colonial officials referred to the transformation of peasants into workers as ‘detribalization’.

Killick notes that Nkrumah did not operate in a vacuum in promoting rapid state-directed development. To the contrary, his policies reflected the consensus among development economists that a ‘big push’ was needed in developing countries to break out of their poverty trap (Killick, Development Economics, 11, 19). Other African leaders espoused a similar need for state-directed policies. In Tanzania, for instance, Julius Nyerere drifted towards this position during the late 1960s.
