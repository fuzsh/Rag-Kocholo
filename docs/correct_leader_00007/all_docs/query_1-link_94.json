        "text": "Image\n\nJointly organized by Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (Kumasi, Ghana), Lincoln University (Pennsylvania, USA)\n\nVenue\n\nKwantlen Polytechnic University\n\n8771 Lansdowne Rd.\n\nRichmond, British Columbia\n\nCanada\n\nTheme\n\nRe-engaging the African Diasporas: Pan-Africanism in the Age of Globalization\n\nKwantlen Polytechnic University, Vancouver, Canada, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana, and Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, USA are pleased to invite you to participate in the Third Biennial Conference, Kwame Nkrumah International Conference (KNIC3).\n\nThe interdisciplinary conference will provide a platform for scholars and students from educational institutions from across the globe to share ideas on how to pool resources and to provide a synergy of knowledge, efforts, projects and programs in Africa and throughout the African world community that are designed to develop the intellectual, social, economic as well as cultural life opportunities of people of African heritage.\n\nWith its theme “Re-engaging the African Diasporas: Pan-Africanism in the Age of Globalization” the conference has as its cardinal aim to harness intellectual, academic, technological, and pedagogical resources in addressing the brain-drain scourge that bedevils the continent. It will seek to debate the causes, effects, and dynamics of the scourge of brain-drain in Africa. The conference will bring together leading scholars and researchers to discuss and share innovative and creative ideas, projects and solutions that would aim at turning the brain-drain loss into a brain-gain gain for the mutual benefit of Continental Africans and people of African descent in the Diaspora.\n\nKeynote/Plenary Speakers\n\nDr. Molefi Kete Asante will provide the keynote address for the conference. Dr. Asante is Professor in the Department of African American Studies at Temple University. Considered by his peers to be one of the most distinguished contemporary scholars, Dr. Asante has published sixty-eight books. The KNIC has attracted other scholars of similar calibre and talent.\n\nGuest Speaker\n\nThe Honourable Samia Nkrumah, ex-Member of the Ghanaian National Assembly, daughter of Kwame Nkrumah and his Egyptian wife Fathia Rizk.\n\nTribute to Nelson Mandela\n\nA special tribute to Nelson Mandela will be held on the opening day of the conference to honour Mandela’s life and work and celebrate 20 years of South African independence. While Mandela is widely considered one of the greatest men in modern history, he is first and foremost an African. The program consists of an inaugural Mandela Lecture, two panel discussions and a number of cultural events celebrating South African music and dancing. It brings together world-renowned South African scholars and community activists working in South Africa and abroad. It therefore speaks eloquently to the conference theme, “Re-engaging the African Diaspora” and operationalises the conference aims of building bridges between the Global South and North, academics and non-governmental organizations.\n\nInaugural Mandela Lecture\n\nDr. Jay Naidoo was recently voted one of the top 100 most influential Africans. He was at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid, leading the largest trade union federation in South Africa. After Independence he held ministerial positions in Mandela’s Cabinet. He currently volunteers for international NGOs such as UNESCO.\n\nThe Tribute to Mandela is sponsored by the Kwantlen University Students’ Association (KUSA).\n\nThe conference is a sequel to, and builds on, the very successful SSHRC-funded inaugural Kwame Nkrumah International Conference held at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in the summer of 2010 and the 2nd Biennial KNIC held at KNUST in the fall of 2012, The two conferences attracted a combined total of over 250 participants globally. The Journal of Pan-African Studies has published a special issue on the KNIC1 and the Cambridge Scholars Publishing plans to publish a combined volume on the proceedings of the two conference by the end of this summer.\n\nKNIC3 takes off from where the first two conferences ended by seeking to mobilize cutting edge research and innovative ideas on African development within context of 21st century global trends. KNIC3 targets international and Canadian scholars, and while it is expected that the majority of the presenters will be academics, submissions have been invited from both graduate and undergraduate students in any Canadian and foreign institutions of higher learning.
