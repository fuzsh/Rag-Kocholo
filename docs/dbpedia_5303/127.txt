WLW Radio in Cincinnati was a pioneering station in broadcasting’s early days. Crosley Broadcasting Corporation owned the station until 1945, when it became a subsidiary of Aviation Corporation (later known as Avco).

The company started experimenting with TV in 1946, airing signals over Channel 1 as W8XCT. It signed on with a commercial license in 1948 as WLWT, operating on Channel 4. WLWT was reassigned to Channel 5 in 1952.

The company aslo started WLWC in Columbus, WLWD in Dayton and WLWI in Indianapolis. The four stations were branded on the air as the “WLW Network.” As seen in this 1963 advertisement, hyphens helped set apart the famous WLW call letters. For instance, Dayton’s station was branded “WLW-D.”

The Ohio stations were NBC affiliates (WLWI in Indianpolis was an ABC affiliate) and shared programming produced in Cincinnati at WLWT. Shows like “The Ruth Lyons 50-50 Club,” “The Paul Dixon Show” and “Midwestern Hayride” were syndicated around the region. WLWT branded itself as “5, The Originator” in the 1970s to promote all of the programming it produced.

WLWT started color broadcasting in 1957 and later became the nation’s first station to broadcast completely in color.

The FCC tightened ownership regulations in 1969. WLW-AM’s tremendous nighttime signal could be heard across much of the country at night. In the ad above, you can see how much of the region received the WLW TV stations. The FCC enacted a “one-to-a-a-market” rule, banning common ownership of AM and TV stations with overlapping coverage areas under certain conditions. WLW and it’s sister TV stations were grandfathered.

When Avco decided to leave the broadcasting business in the 1970s, the stations lost their grandfathered status. Multimedia, Inc., bought WLWT in Cincinnati. New owners bought the other stations and renamed them. Dayton’s WLWD is now WDTN Channel 2, WLWC in Columbus is WCHM and WLWI in Indianapolis is now WTHR.
