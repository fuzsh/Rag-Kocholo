I enjoyed your site and it brought back some memories. Al died almost 4 years ago. Thank you for remembering him.\n\nGreg\n\nOctober 12, 2001\n\nEditor's note: \"Jazzbo\" was one of radio's most innovative personalities, known around the country. His broadcasts from the \"Purple Grotto\" were staples of San Francisco and New York radio for decades.\n\nComments: Dennis: Love this month's updates -- keep 'em coming.\n\nThe more I visit the website, the more it jogs my memory. Lately I've been trying to remember a song that I heard only on Monitor. It was a novelty type song that someone made because some psychic or some such person made a prediction that there was going to be a major earthquake in California and the state would tumble into the sea (to quote the totally unrelated Steely Dan song). All I can remember about the lyrics is a line that says once the quake comes \"we'll tie up the boats in Idaho.\"\n\nDo you remember that song? This would have been in the mid-to late '60s time frame.\n\nThomas J. Frieling\n\nBainbridge College\n\nOctober 1, 2001\n\nComments: Hello. I just saw your website and enjoyed it. Just curious, but how would I go about getting a tape from a broadcast in the late 60s or 70s? Are there any out there for purchase or loan or other?

It was a great series.\n\nJack Person\n\nWashington DC\n\nAugust 23, 2001\n\nComments: Thought you'd be interested in this snippett from a Tom Shales cloumn in a 1983 Washington Post. I found it doing a Lexis/Nexis search on \"NBC Monitor\".\n\nI'd forgotten that in the early '80s NBC TV tried to compete with 60 Minutes with a similar news magazine called NBC Monitor. It apparently quickly bombed, but it this news magazine that Shales is writing his review about. At the end of his review he pays this two sentance homage to THE Monitor:\n\nThe Washington Post March 12, 1983, Saturday, Final Edition\n\nBYLINE: By Tom Shales\n\n\"The name \"Monitor\" previously was used by NBC radio for its pioneering weekend news and feature service, the forerunner of today's all-news and all-talk radio stations. Listeners would hear electronic boops and beeps and be told by an announcer, \"You're on the Monitor beacon.\" No matter when you tuned in, you had an 85 percent chance of catching something worth catching.\"\n\nThomas J. Frieling\n\nBainbridge College\n\nAugust 20, 2001\n\nComments: Thanks for the Monitor memories. I've been searching the web for some time to find a place like this -- I was beginning to wonder if I was the only one who remembered Monitor at all. I'm glad to see Monitor still has lots of fans.\n\nI listened as a kid when I lived in Ohio in the late '50s, driving around in the car with my Dad. And later in my teen years in Birmingham, AL where I believe WAPI AM ran Monitor. I was the only one of my circle of friends who listened -- they all thought Monitor was square (to use the lingo of the day) and thought I was weird for liking it. Ok, so maybe it was, but for some reason it still appealed to me.\n\nI guess I really liked the personalities and the ever changing nature of what I'd likely hear next. And I'd search the several clear channel radio stations like WLW in Cincinnati to find the late night segments those times when my local station wasn't taking the Monitor feeds. Those were great memories. I still remember the little transistor radio I bought around 1968 or so and between baseball games and Monitor, I must have worn that thing out!\n\nIs it too much to think Monitor could be revived today? Radio could use the authentic diversity that Monitor gave its listeners. That would be a great antidote to the artificial, compartmentalized radio programming we've got today. I'd sure take a few of my weekend hours to sit back and enjoy Monitor again if it ever returned! Thanks again and please keep adding to the site.\n\nThomas J. Frieling\n\nBainbridge College\n\nAugust 3, 2001\n\nComments: I am a former radio D.J. (WONE, Dayton, Ohio and college station WMUB, Oxford, Ohio) and have radio in my blood, I think. I collect radio jingles, commercials and also TV theme songs.\n\nI was surfing the web today, thinking of TV and Radio trivia, and somehow when I saw the letters \"NBC\" on some web page, the phrase \"NBC Monitor\" sprang into my head. I did a search on NBC Monitor, and found your pages.\n\nI can't tell you the memories of my preteen childhood (I'm 49 now) that were resurrected by hearing the Monitor Beacon and some of those themes that you have montaged on your site. The recording of the Beacon that I've downloaded is a sound that I will keep and treasure forever as a reminder of my growing-up years.\n\nThank you.\n\nEarl S. Jones\n\nJuly 24, 2001\n\nEditor's note: Thank YOU, Earl, for making our day with your kind comments.\n\nComments: Well, first of all let me say thank you for the Monitor website. It was great to listen to all of those old sounds.\n\nMy main reason for writing is I'm looking for someone that has a copy of the old NBC News and Information Service sounders. I had a copy until 1994 when my home was broken into and some boxes were taken. Of course that tape was in one of the boxes.\n\nIf you happen to have a copy I would be very happy to pay you for any copying costs.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKyle Wesley\n\nJuly 20, 2001\n\nComments: Hello! I was directed to your site and I am so glad it is there.\n\nI listened to it in its last five or six years and often taped parts of it...alas only parts of it...and have those tapes SOMEWHERE. I especially liked Gene Shepherd's commentaries and enjoyed all of their DJs which introduced me to some very cool music, some of which I have yet to find. Their intros and outros were just as beguiling as what they played.\n\nByron Caloz\n\nJuly 14, 2001\n\nComments: Do you know where I can get a copy of the instrumental \"Where or When\" by the Bill (or Bob) Mitchell orchestra/band? This tune was a regular feature on the \"Monitor\" weekend series. I've looked and looked for 35+ years. I can't find it anywhere!\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTom\n\nJuly 11, 2001\n\nComments: WOW!! What a pleasant surprise when I discoved your website thru the Jeff Miller links.\n\nI worked for WGIR in Manchester, NH as a staff engineer and we used to carry Monitor and also tape- delay it when we had the Red Sox on. I was involved with a broadcast of Monitor -- we did cut-ins from Laconia, NH on a particular Saturday and Sunday. A 15kc loop, a network line (for cue) and a dial phone...all for three five-minute, or so, segments.\n\nI fondly remember the programs and always looked forward to working the weekends. Thanks for the trip down memory lane.\n\nNorm Gagnon\n\nwww.ggninfo.com\n\nJune 27, 2001\n\nComments: The Monitor Site.....What a discovery!!!!! I was thrilled to find the site on the web. What great memories.\n\nI was first introduced to NBC's \"Monitor\" during my college days at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, La. I worked weekends at KVOL, 1330AM which carried Monitor each Saturday & Sunday. I inserted the station's I.D.'s and commercials (we called them \"spots\" in those days.) Many segments were run live and some were taped. I remember so well taping some of the network feeds for delayed broadcast...we had peg boards filled with reels of tape.\n\nI became absolutely fascinated with the shows. I admired the hosts and came to realize what a wonderful gift of \"communicating\" they all had. In fact, Gene, Gary, Joe and all the hosts had such a positive impact on my career in broadcasting.\n\nThanks for the memories!\n\nTom Voinche, Jr.\n\nHost, Good Morning Acadiana\n\nKATC-TV 3(ABC)\n\nLafayette, La.\n\nJune 26, 2001\n\nComments: The earlier reference to Monitor's Gordon Frasier struck a responsive chord with me.\n\nI worked at NBC affiliate WLBZ in Bangor, Maine, in the mid-sixties and also picked up a few extra bucks doing Monitor features -- usually in partnership with newsman John Wellington. Gordon Frasier was a most supportive liaison, giving helpful suggestions and editorial advice. As a relatively inexperienced youngster, I found in Frasier a truly nice man who always had time to offer friendly advice and encouragement.\n\nI did local news cut-ins on Sundays when Henry Morgan was the Monitor host. \"You don't think we do this show live?\" he said one afternoon. \"All right, tell me 36 across in the New York Times crossword puzzle if you're so smart.\"\n\nDan Everett\n\nJune 24, 2001\n\nComments: I discovered \"Monitor\" the weekend it hit the air, as my local NBC affiliate, KVOO-AM, Tulsa, promoted it rather heavily. I was about 15 years old, and had already begun fantasizing about a radio career, even though my father had other plans for me.\n\n\"Monitor\" was what radio was supposed to be. Comedy (e.g. Bob & Ray, Fibber McGee and Molly), sports scores, plenty of live remotes, Miss Monitor's weather, and, above all, hourly newscasts I COULD SET MY WATCH BY!\n\nIn 1958-60 I was listening to \"Monitor\" on WINA, while attending the University of Virginia. Even on those rare Sunday nights when it wasn't necessary to study until midnight, I would find an excuse to stay up until 11:56 pm EST so I could hear Patricia Clark with the Norrie Paramor Orchestra sing \"I'll See You in My Dreams,\" as I fell asleep.(Capitol T-10130)\n\nThose were the days when network radio was truly an art form. If it weren't for \"Morning Edition\", \"All Things Considered,\" and \"Weekend Edition,\" today's generation would have no idea......\n\nChris Astle\n\nProducer, WHRV-FM, Norfolk, VA.\n\nJune 10, 2001\n\nComments: Hey, this was a great trip down memory lane.\n\nI seem to remember Monitor being on NBC television for a brief period. Correct me if I'm wrong, I was eleven years old at the time around 1955. Thanks for the memories.\n\nRich\n\nJune 10, 2001\n\nEditor's note: You're welcome, Rich. Monitor's first hour -- 4 to 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, June 12, 1955 -- was simulcast on NBC Radio and TV.\n\nComments: How fitting that I should discover the \"Monitor\" memorial website on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI remember the program well, for I was in the audience for broadcast #1 from NBC's new Radio Central (that name actually originated around 1920 for RCA's worldwide listening post and transmitters at Rocky Point, Long Island). While I was in college at the University of North Carolina in the early 60s I was a stringer for Monitor. They never used any of my material, but were still very supportive. My contact at NBC was Gordon Frasier, who may be one of the people who deserves to fill one of the ? boxes on the Communicators page.\n\nThe program went through a lot of phases, from its first days when it really was something of a phantasmagoria to its final years when it turned into more or less a network disc jockey show. But it was still good to beam onto the Monitor beacon (and hearing it here again brought as much of an emotional rush to me as a piece of electronic music can). A query and an observation: Does anyone remember an NBC weekend series called \"Road Show\"? It was a national long-form weekend series designed for drivers, hosted by Bill Cullen, and I think it could have served as a prototype for \"Monitor\".\n\nAlso, does it ever occur to you that there's a lot of \"Monitor\" in NPR's news-&-feature programs, especially \"All Things Considered\" and\"Weekend Edition\"? I hope Pat Weaver enjoys listening to them.\n\nBill Jaker\n\nJune 9, 2001\n\nComments: Hello there! Thanks for a most fascinating web site dedicated to one of my top three or four radio programs. I have had a fabulous day simply checking out what's there.\n\nNot knowing of your site's existence, early last year (possibly before the site was created?) I wrote an extensive piece on Monitor for inclusion in one of my OTR books. McFarland & Co. will release it probably in late 2002. Meanwhile, I circulated much of that material recently in a couple of OTR newsletters that you may have seen.\n\nThanks for preserving this important and valuable piece of American communications, information and entertainment heritage. While I have nothing to trade and own very little of the show's excerpts, anything that I may do to contribute to helping renew the pleasure that this series provided I am more than willing to do.\n\nMeanwhile, thanks profusely for what you have done.\n\nJim Cox\n\nJune 8, 2001\n\nComments: Dennis,\n\nCongrats on the 6,000 mark! Last night I posted messages on two usenet boards. (BTW, I hope you don't mind. I think it's important that people remember the importance of Monitor in NBC AND radio history.)\n\nTake care,\n\nTerry Morgan\n\n(G-E-C)\n\nJune 7, 2001\n\nEditor's note: Of course we don't mind, Terry, and thanks. By the way, Terry is a big-time media fan who says that when he was growing up, he followed broadcasting like most kids follow sports. Besides contributing to this site, Terry is a frequent contributor to the New York Radio Message Board.\n\nComments: Dennis,\n\nThis is certainly a great site & a great tribute to Monitor. I enjoyed listening during the mid to late sixties over WNBC. I am enjoying all of the Monitor theme packages that you have put together.\n\nThere is one theme that was played during the sixties that I wish could be found and added to the collection. It goes something like this: \"Wonder what's on? No matter where you stare with your ears, There is only one Monitor.\" Behind the announcers voice is the sound of a radio scanning the dial looking for Monitor.\n\nI believe this would make a great contribution to the theme package. Looking forward to the months ahead of a great site. Thanks for the memories.\n\n(No name provided)\n\nJune 7, 2001\n\nComments: Ah, what a wonderful web site.\n\nAround here, our Monitor signal came from WHO in Des Moines or KFAB in Omaha. My Monitor listening goes back to the very first program and also to the days when Monitor was on all night long, on, as I recall, Friday and Saturday nights. The overnight host was Al \"Jazzbeau\" Collins and the newscaster was Leon Pearson, brother of the famous columnist Drew Pearson.\n\nLots of jazz remotes were done from various night spots during the late night and early morning Monitor shows, some from New York and some from Los Angeles. The telco circuit \"reversing\" was done, literally, on the air when Al Collins would say something like, \"Now from the famous XYZ Club (or wherever) in Hollywood, here comes the music of The Gerry Mulligan Quartet--after we pause for fifteen seconds to reverse our NBC network.\" Outside of Monitor, that business was handled in the station break periods, and listeners never heard it.\n\nThanks for the memories.\n\nDon Forsling\n\nJune 6, 2001\n\nComments: Thanks for the great site.\n\nI worked on Monitor until the last weekend show. I was a production assistant for the \"Saturday\" shows with John B.Tucker and Big Wilson. John was a opportunistic letch and Biggie was an absolute delight.\n\nI only worked on the show for about 8 months but what an education it was. I met Steve Allen, Milton Berle, Bob Hope, every star NBC had under contract back then. Those of us who were not NABET or DGA were let go. I went on to be an Associate Director for ABC Radio Networks, Staff Announcer Producer at WOR-TV and finally worked my way back to 30 Rock as a News/Traffic Reporter at WNBC-AM in NYC with Howard & Imus. Later I was news anchor in Chicago at WLS-FM (WYTZ) and now do only commercial voice-overs. But I owe my blessed life and career to MONITOR.\n\nI'll never forget the thrill of doing a live show. Anything could happen. Wrong tapes played, wrong page in the script, host in the bathroom! You name it! We were always searching for an interview to do on each show. Someone new, someone with a book, an actor with a play or movie -- anything! We timed segments, selected the music, back-timed the openings, figured out the cut-aways and played the Monitor Beacon sounders. God what fun.\n\nJesse Upchurch\n\nJune 5, 2001\n\nComments: Dear Dennis:\n\nAs a lover of broadcasting history, I absolutely enjoyed your \"Monitor\" website. I believe \"Monitor\" was aired on KFAB in Omaha while I was growing up in nearby Fremont, Nebraska, but I'm not sure. It was great to hear the clips of Gene Rayburn, Bill Cullen and Ed McMahon -- some of my heroes.\n\nI'm currently Associate News Director at KMA-AM 960 in Shenandoah, Iowa, which just celebrated its 75th anniversary last summer. We are trying to do some of the things \"Monitor\" used to do--interspercing local interviews and features with country music in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon hours (though I don't think the resemblence to the \"Monitor\" format is intentional).\n\nI think it shows that there is still an audience out there that is starved for a program like \"Monitor,\" and who are tired of stations playing 18,250 hits in a row, and loud-mouth announcers like Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. I wonder how many others on this guestbook would agree?\n\nAgain, congratulations!!!!\n\nMike Peterson\n\nJune 1, 2001\n\nComments: Hi Dennis. Just wanted to let you know...you did a great job at putting together the new batch of Monitor jingles. It was great listening. There are 3 or 4 in there that I forgot about, until I heard them.\n\nAnyway, keep up the EXCELLENT web site.\n\nKen Smith\n\nMay 29, 2001\n\nComments: Dennis, thank you for a good laugh with the June sound bits of Monitor. I bet the phone lit up at every NBC affiliate when the word B--- S--------- went out over the network. Do you know how much the FCC fined NBC for that slip?\n\nCharles Gossett Jr.\n\nMay 28, 2001\n\nEditor's note: No, Charles, I don't know. Maybe one of our website visitors will tell us.\n\nComments: Hello. Hopefully, this is going to Dennis Hart who composed the \"Monitor\" site. It's great.\n\nMy name is Stan Zabka. I was an AD in television at NBCNY for some 22 years and was there when \"Monitor\" was launched, broadcast out of the \"Fish Bowl\" (Radio Master Control also) on the 5th floor.\n\nDennis. I look forward to re-visiting your Monitor page and examining its contents more fully. Having spent so many years with NBC at the Rock, one can't help be become nostalgic over those wonderful times.\n\nKind regards,\n\nStan Zabka\n\nGrass Valley, CA.\n\nMay 23, 2001\n\nComments: Thanks for bringing back Monitor.\n\nI worked for NBC San Francisco from 1942 as an announcer and newsman. In 1954 I took a leave of absence and worked on a freighter as a radio operator on a round the world trip. I filmed an episode for TV's Kingdom of the Sea on the life of a seaman. I also had a tape recorder that required an automobile battery to run. Monitor had not yet been created but I decided to record interesting sounds in the ports I visited. There were about six, but I can only recall: Back stage at a Chinese Opera in Hong Kong. A snake charmer in Karachi, Packistan.\n\nWhen I got back to San Francisco I called NBC in New York and told themwhat I had. They were not interested. Then in 1955 I got a call from NBC to get down to the Hollywood studios at Sunset and Vine right away. Monitor had been born and I had the first foreign segments. In Hollywood I did the voice overs for the spots and they were featured on Monitor that weekend.\n\nI returned to NBC San Francisco and wrote and voiced many Monitor segments during its life time. Did you know that Pat Weaver is Sigourney Weaver's father? I've put down some of my NBC memories on my web site and would be happy to exchange links with Monitor.\n\nBill Roddy\n\nMission Viejo, CA\n\nMay 19, 2001\n\nhttp://americahurrah.com/NBCmemoriesIndex.htm\n\nEditor's note: Done, Bill -- we're linked. It's great to hear from a former Monitor contributor!\n\nComments: What a terrific website!! Gene Garnes from NBC pointed me in this direction.\n\nI have 2 of the 4 Radio Central Consoles, a \"School Desk\" and about 12 of the original Central Equipment racks. It is about 20% restored. I made a \"Boomerang\" Correspondents table at about 1/2 original size (outta space) as the one in your Gene Rayburn pic was tossed out years before when 5B was upgraded. Also have most of the blueprints and can answer any tech questions about this unusual facility. Keep in touch!\n\nBill Kuhar\n\nMay 8, 2001\n\nComments: Hey Dennis,\n\nCongratulations on 5,000 hits for your Monitor Website. I guess there must be more people than just you and me that are interested in NBC Monitor. Keep up the good work.\n\nDon Spuhler\n\nMay 4, 2001\n\nEditor's note: Don wrote our very first guestbook entry on Oct. 22, 2000 -- the day this website premiered. He also wrote a very kind note on our 3,000th visit on Feb. 17, 2001. He is bigtime Monitor fan who listened to network radio's greatest show on KFI Radio in Los Angeles and other stations. And, yes, the response to this website has been overwhelming and gratifying. There ARE lots of you Monitor fans out there, and I hope what we're doing brings back some great memories!\n\nComments: I interned at Monitor during the first half of 1973, as a high school junior, at the tender age of 15. It was New York City's \"Executive Internship\" program, offered through my highs chool -- Hillcrest -- in Jamaica, Queens. I received credits for \"real\" field work during the week. It was one of the earlier internship programs being offered. I worked at NBC Tuesdays to Saturdays. Off Mondays!\n\nFast forward: these days I'm one of the staff announcers at C-SPAN in DC. My broadcast career has included radio work, freelance voice-overs, great contacts & experiences over the years--and many generous people.\n\nAt Monitor, I was interviewed & hired by Bob Maurer, interviewed by and assigned to Danny Sutter--a gem. He had been one of the people who helped start AFTRA when it was just AFRA (no T, for Television) and he was an early radio actor and director (\"X-Minus One\"). I remember Bill and Louise Malcolm, Cappy Petrash (sp?), Joyce (a P-A), Jim White, Charlie Garment (a writer, whose brother was Nixon friend Leonard Garment), Jeff Kulliver, an executive who was a relative of Guy Lombardo, Gene Garnes--a big man, and another engineer whose name I can't recall (he was also involved in theatre projects) who showed me how to edit like a whiz with Edit-alls and razor blades. (Now, there's a skill that's disappeared!)\n\nI remember vacationing in Maine during my internship, dropping in to the local Monitor affiliate in Portland, and--showing off!--bringing a copy of the weekend rundown to listen along with! I remember Monitor's going-away gift after my months there: signatures from all the staff with comments on a backward-rolled yellow news teletype.\n\nI remember meeting Art Fleming, the Lettermen, Robert Goulet, Ed McMahon, Bill Cullen, Cindy Adams. I remember being part of the team that interviewed Ryan O'Neal in his hotel suite at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Ave. Dinner at the corner bar (Hurley's!) with Stiller & Meara. The smell and feel and lighting and wonder of the studios Wandering 'round 30 Rock on the Saturdays before we were on air and finding those old radio \"echo chambers,\" tiptoeing inside, all musty-smelling, doors padded with what looked like old mattresses.\n\nBeing accepted, fitting right in--just right. I was so welcomed, and recall fond memories of that time. More memories come rushing...\n\nThank you so, for your terrific site, and the chance to reconnect & remember.\n\nJosh Cohen\n\nMay 3, 2001\n\nComments: I worked on Monitor in 1965 doing turntables for eight hours one summer. Jerry Schneider was Big Wilson's Engineer on WNBC. I left NBC and went to WHN in 1966. WHN became WFAN and Emmis bought WNBC in 1988. I am still here. Big Wilson died a number of years ago. He was a great human being. We all miss his talent.\n\nDick James\n\nApril 30, 2001\n\nComments: At the suggestion of Scott Marinoff in San Diego, your web site has been added to our links page on the DCNYRadio Memories Web Site. http://www.dcnyradio.8m.net/.\n\nEnjoyed hearing those tones again...\"You're on the Monitor beacon...\" It's a wonderful site. Brings back a LOT of memories. I worked for NBC as a Summer Relief Engineer in Washington in 1966. Monitor was always one of my favorite programs.\n\nBill\n\nApril 22, 2001\n\nComments: Hi! Love the site. I used to listen to Monitor in good old San Jose, CA. It was great for long motor trips. It was on KNBC. Is it possible to buy tapes of MONITOR?\n\nAgain thanks,\n\nKent\n\nApril 18, 2001\n\nComments: First of all, thanks for bringing back some great memories for me. I first listened to \"Monitor\" back in 1970 when my dad discovered it while on a family weekend outing one Saturday afternoon. I was 11 years old and I remember my dad saying how much he liked listening to the show.\n\nFrom that time on, we (me, my sister, and Mom and Dad) became regular listeners. Some of my favorite memories growing up were the afternoon drives my family would take on a Saturday or Sunday...and the car radio would be on with \"Monitor\" tuned in. We listened to \"Monitor\" on WSJS-AM in Winston-Salem, NC in the early 70's until they dropped it from their schedule. We re-discovered the show in it's last couple of years of existence on WMVA in Martinsville, VA.\n\nI credit \"Monitor\" for being a huge influence in my career choice...broadcasting. I spent 15 years in radio before moving on to television as a technician. It just so happens that I currently work for the TV station that at one time was the sister station to WSJS. It used to be known as WSJS-TV before a change in ownership and is now known as WXII-TV.\n\nKeep up the great work and I look forward to more \"sounds\" from \"Monitor\" being added to your superb site.\n\nLewis Bode\n\nCana, VA\n\nApril 12, 2001\n\nComments: Hello Dennis!\n\nI want to commend you on your wonderful Monitor website, which I just\n\ndiscovered. I’m delighted that someone else remembers this unique radio\n\nconcept and was enthusiastic enough to assemble this kind of tribute.\n\nFor my part, I’d be very happy to share some of my own Monitor memories.\n\nW.T. KOLTEK\n\nMarch 26, 2001\n\nEditor's note: You can see W. T.'s memories on the Monitor Memories page.\n\nComments: Dennis, Hi again.\n\nFirst off, continued great work on the website. I was able to download the Beacon and the themes package, and am enjoying them greatly in my time off-line. In fact, those themes are running constantly through my head now - thanks!! Plus, the Rayburn package is great to listen to as well. It seems kinda sad that only now are people finding out just how multi-talented he was, and he's been gone just over a year.\n\nKenneth Johannessen\n\nThat's all from East Wenatchee at this time.\n\ng-e-c\n\nMarch 26, 2001\n\nComments: Greetings! I did a web search for \"NBC Monitor,\" figuring somebody would have done what you've done. But I didn't expect to find it done this well. Many thanks for your wonderful site.\n\nI was born in 1958 and fell in love with radio at a very early age. My interest intensified when my family moved to Louisville in the fall of 1965, and I spent many, many hours listening to rock 'n' roll and play-by-play...both from local stations and from around the Midwest on my Philco radio. The ballgames\n\nwould be on the more \"square\" sounding stations, but I would also listen to those stations sometimes when the games weren't on, so I got a good grounding in musical standards and classics, and I was introduced to some wonderful personalities.\n\nThe NBC station in Louisville was WAVE, and I remember this exotic-sounding Monitor program. I never really knew for sure when it would be on or where it would becoming from, but it sounded so...important!\n\nInteresting!\n\nIn 1968 we moved to Long Island and I became a regular listener to WNBC. While I really don't recall Monitor being part of my life after leaving Kentucky, I do recall the Monitor hosts of that era from the regular shifts on WNBC. They were all great influences on me, adding to my lifelong desire to go into\n\nbroadcasting...which I did as soon as I graduated from high school in 1975. Today I work as the morning show host and program director at WJON-AM in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\n\nCan you tell me, do you know who would have any untelescoped tapes of Monitor programs that I could get copies of? I would be happy to provide blank cassettes, postage, and any fee that would be necessary. For that matter, I would be interested in sources of untelescoped radio airchecks from AM stations, especially for the years 1965-74. I have found some sources for scoped airchecks, but I would dearly love to hear things as they were.\n\nAgain let me express my appreciation for your work on the Monitor web site--what a great gift to the world! Take care.\n\nJ.G. Preston\n\nMarch 20, 2001\n\nComments: I am so glad I found the Monitor web site. I grew up listening to Monitor on WHIS in Bluefield,WV, a long time NBC affiliate.\n\nMonitor was really the last vestige of what I remember as network radio and provided a balanced, thoughtful mix of different facets of life including news, politics, humor, music, sports, and art. Monitor stands in sharp contrast to radio today which is dominated by canned music, religion, immature DJ's with a fetish for the disgusting, right winged talk, and not-so-well done sports.\n\nThanks bringing back memories of better radio.\n\nMarch 18, 2001\n\nComments: I enjoyed the 45-year remembrance, Dennis, and I look forward to more weekend memories.\n\nAlan Buckley\n\nNewbury Park, CA\n\nMarch 18, 2001\n\nEditor's note: Alan is referring to the Monitor This Weekend Page, in which we list many of the events and guests on Monitor exactly 45 years ago each weekend.\n\nComments: Dennis,\n\nWow! Those jingles and clips bring back memories! Monitor was always on in our house on the weekends in the 60s and 70s on WIBA. Do any of your sources remember Jeopardy's Art Fleming as a Sunday afternoon host, c. 73-74? Talking up soft rock songs, he sounded like a fish out of water.\n\nTim Brickner\n\nMadison, Wis.\n\nMarch 11, 2001\n\nComments: I was in Ft Monmouth NJ electronics school when I heard Monitor (Morgan Beatty, R C Harkness, etc.) Thanks!\n\nMarch 11, 2001\n\nComments: Dennis:\n\nWhoa! What a find! I was doing a search on Bob and Ray and I found this! This brought me back to my childhood in Madison, Wis. when Monitor always on WIBA-AM radio and was playing in our house and in my folks' cars.\n\nI was especially floored by the Monitor Beacon and the theme I hadn't heard in over 30 years (all I know it's that \"galloping news theme\" with Frank McGee's introduction I remember from TV and radio stations in the mid-1960s). Actually I was going to get around to doing a net search for that theme, but now my search is over even before I started!\n\nThanks for your work and research.\n\nDennis LaBissoniere\n\nWauconda, Ill.\n\nMarch 10, 2001\n\nComments: Thank you so much for your wonderful website. NBC Radio Network's Monitor was a very important part of my youth and I remember it so fondly.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nAlan D.

AND WHO HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING AND BRIEFLY CONVERSING WITH PAT WEAVER... THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PROJECT. AFTER THREE DAYS OF JUST LOGGING ON AND READING, I'M STILL COMING UP WITH SOMETHING NEW TO ENJOY AND REMEMBER FROM THE DAYS OF WORKING THE BOARD AT KOB, ALBUQUERQUE, DURING MONITOR HOURS. IT'S LIKE RE-MEETING A LONG-LOST FRIEND AND FINDING THAT...CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU THOUGHT... THE FRIEND ISN'T DEAD, AFTER ALL. MAYBE A LITTLE ILL... BUT TREATABLE, IF SOMEONE CARED ENOUGH TO SPEND THE TIME AND EFFORT. LET'S HOPE IT DOES MAKE A COMEBACK. NOMINEE FOR BEST SEGMENT: DAVE GARROWAY THE SUNDAY AFTER MARIAN JORDAN (MOLLY MC GEE) DIED.

The flood of memories has been overwhelming as I have read about and listened (after all these years!) to what has always been my favorite radio program. When I heard the Beacon again after all this time... well, let's just say, \"profoundly moving\".\n\nI became a fan of Monitor while in high school in north Jersey during the late 60's. While my friends were listening to WABC and WMCA, I usually listened to WNBC, WCBS, WINS and then Monitor on weekends. It was a window on the world for me, and of course that was such a tumultuous time. Every weekend there was something new to listen to and learn.\n\nI had just gone back to college for my last semester in January '75. To this day I remember hearing the show the Saturday before departure. Two weekends later I tuned in from school, but there was no Monitor to be found. When I discovered the show had been cancelled I was very upset. You are so right. There was nothing like it before, and certainly nothing even remotely close to it since.\n\nDo you think there is any chance the show could be re-born, possibly through syndication, at some point? What do you think it would take to get Monitor back on the air?\n\nThanks again for a marvelous website. I look forward to coming back here often.\n\nRandy A. Krakower\n\nFebruary 22, 2001\n\nEditor's note: Yes, I think Monitor could be re-born, and I think it would work well. The AM radio climate has changed considerably since the mid-70's, and many AM's are just dying for decent weekend programming. Monitor would fill the bill quite well. Before GE sold NBC Radio in the late '80's, the network was working on a pilot project to bring Monitor back. Maybe, just maybe, GE will decide that network radio can, indeed, be profitable, and get back into the business.\n\nComments: Fascinating Website. Learned about it from Monitoring Times magazine.\n\nReally enjoyed Bob Dreier's stories. As a career broadcast engineer-type, I can understand his frustrations with \"talent\" (mis-)handling the \"goodies.\" His \"reverse-Dorsey\" is a great idea!\n\nAnd, yes... the \"Monitor Beacon\" still evokes memories of radio in a \"kinder and gentler\" time.\n\nRegards & \"73\"\n\nMichael Shovan, WB2KHE\n\nFebruary 20, 2001\n\nComments: Hi, Dennis. Congratulations on 3,000 hits on your NBC Monitor Beacon website. I certainly think this proves that there is an interest for a program that you and I thoroughly enjoyed. I am looking forward to March and the Gene Rayburn information.\n\nAgain, congratulations on 3,000 hits.\n\nDon Spuhler\n\nSaturday 2-17-2001 9:02 p.m. Pacific Time\n\nEditor's note: Don wrote our first guestbook letter on October 22, 2000 -- the day this website premiered.\n\nComments: Really cool, Dennis.\n\nKimba Livesay\n\nFebruary 15, 2001\n\nComments: Dennis:\n\nI scanned the Monitor home page and saw my name as a contributor!

Well I enjoy and I am sending the email.\n\nKeep it up.\n\nDon Spuhler\n\nJanuary 30, 2001\n\nComments: I remember listening to \"Monitor\" in the back seat of my dad's car. In fact, he worked at NBC affiliate WROC-AM, Rochester through the late 60s.\n\nDuring the week the station had a tired MOR format. But \"Monitor\" played more contemporary music, something I certainly appreciated during that golden age of Top 40 radio. The \"sounds of 'Monitor'\" are terrific! I burned them onto a CD so I can hear them in the car!\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing more new audio like, \"More news and late information, next on this \"Monitor\" station\", and anything from my all-time favorite game show host, the late, great Gene Rayburn. Thanks, Dennis!\n\nDoug Thomas\n\nOrlando, FL\n\nJanuary 26, 2001\n\nComments:\n\nTHANKS !\n\nJanuary 26, 2001\n\nComments: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU\n\nI grew up listing to MONITOR with my uncle. On the weekends I would stay at my aunt and uncle's house. He had an \"old\" Zenith radio, you know the \"LARGE\" models that was able to pick up around the world. We'd listen to MONITOR then stay up late to listen to RFE (radio free Europe) broadcast. He could speak French, German, Italian and some Russian.\n\nYou have brought back a wonderful memory for me. Again THANK YOU\n\nC. Braunm\n\nCincinnati OH\n\nJanuary 18, 2001\n\nComments: Congratulations, Dennis!\n\nThis is an absolutely great tribute site to a genuine radio legend, Monitor! I remember listening to Monitor since I was 10 years old, over WSAN 1470 AM in Allentown, PA. As years went by, my fascination with this program prompted me to choose a career in radio. At age 15, I auditioned at\n\nWSAN and 2 years later, I received my big break!\n\nI ran many hours of Monitor from 1969 through 1971, practically living at WSAN on weekends! We cleared all segments of Monitor. Some were aired live, and others were taped delayed do to Phillies baseball or local church remote broadcasts. I remember as a youngster listening to NBC Monitor broadcasts, played out of sequence beyond 2 or 3 in the morning on Monday! WSAN was determined to receive their compensation for these broadcasts one way or the other.\n\nAs a board op at WSAN, I thoroughly enjoyed Gene Rayburn and Ted Brown's segments. Ted Brown became my mentor! At times, I was responsible for tape recording Monitor for playback later in the day. Over the years, I've collected many segments of Monitor dating back to 1961.\n\nI have so many wonderful memories of Monitor, including the Christmas Eve segments. The announcer would conclude Monitor by saying \"This is NBC, the Night Before Christmas.\" In 1973, my wife and I visited RCA, NY for the very first time! We toured the NBC Radio & TV studios. I was thoroughly impressed with Murray the K, conducting an interview for Monitor.\n\nToday I own and operate the nation's first commercial cable radio station, WALN Cable FM 92. I started this station in 1974. Currently we serve cable TV/FM subscribers on the RCN and Service Electric Cable systems, throughout Eastern Pennsylvania and Western New Jersey. WALN also streams on the internet 24/7 at http://www.polkas.com/waln. In a few days, I will create a link\n\nfrom WALN's web site to yours.\n\nIf I can assist in the future, please feel free to contact me.\n\nJack Burns, owner\n\nWALN Cable FM 92\n\nAllentown, PA\n\nJanuary 16, 2001\n\nEditor's note: You can see a picture of a young Jack Burns running the board for his radio station during a Monitor segment at The WALN Homepage.\n\nComments: Your guestbook is THE big attraction for me. I'd like to add my congrats to you for acknowledging and paying tribute to a wonderful part of broadcast history.\n\nI worked with some of those you've heard from already. Beryl Pfizer, who wrote MONITOR and other shows even before that. (More later.) Jeff Kulliver who AD'd, directed, then in the late sixties succeeded me as Director of Program Operations for the Radio Network. Ed Hanna who mentioned he worked for Russ Tornabene, as I did in the mid '70's during the last days of MONITOR. Don Blair, Bob Dreier, Gene Garnes...all worked on the show at one time or another in different capacities. It's great to read their reminiscences and comments.\n\nMy first job at NBC in 1957 was as Production Assistant (or Associate Producer as I noted I was titled at one time in a newspaper review) for NIGHTLINE, with Walter O'Keefe. It lasted almost three years...8-10PM Monday through Friday. Exec Produced by Peter Lassally who later became exec producer for Johnny Carson and then David Letterman. Then in 1960, I was selected as producer of a new and kind of experimental extension of MONITOR..called WEEKNIGHT MONITOR. 8-10PM Monday thru Friday.\n\nBeryl Pfizer was a writer on my segment. Hosts were Walter Kiernan, George Putnam, George Skinner, Todd Russell and others whose names fail me at this time. It lasted eight months then I went over to EMPHASIS as director and worked with all the then members of NBC News' stable...Brinkley, Huntley, Bill Ryan, Frank McGee (I was in the booth with Frank when he interviewed Martin Luther King)...Irving R. Levine, Edwin Newman, earlier on with Morgan Beatty, Richard Harkness, Bob Mccormick, Joseph C. Harsch, John Rich, George Clay (killed in Africa), Welles Hangen (MIA in Vietnam)...then entertainment talents like Arlene Francis, Bill Cullen, Lindsay Nelson (sports), Curt Gowdy.\n\nI could go on and on...as any of us could that worked in production in those days. Anyway...keep it going. It's great.\n\nPeter Flynn\n\nJanuary 15, 2001\n\nComments: Thx so much for the Monitor website. I started listening to Monitor where I grew up in Ohio over WHIZ Radio in Zanesville from 1973 to 1975. It brought back great memories. Thx and keep up the great work!\n\nJanuary 11, 2001\n\nComments: I just discovered your Monitor webpage and want to congratulate you on it.\n\nI look forward to future updates on your page.\n\nDavid Schwartz\n\nJanuary 8, 2001\n\nComments: Hello, Dennis!\n\nI worked for the NBC radio affiliate in Madison, Wisconsin, when Monitor was still operating, and was just leaving when NBC scapped its original format and went to all-news. WIBA dropped its long-time NBC affiliation at that point and became a CBS affiliate. I loved Monitor. Was sorry to see it end.\n\nThomas L. Beell, Professor of Journalism, Iowa State University\n\nJanuary 8, 2001\n\nComments: I've been meaning to tell you about a PROMO for Monitor I heard on a mid-50's NBC Radio daytime program:\n\nAbout two years ago, on WTIX-690's \"Golden Era of Radio\", George Buck (the station owner and OTR \"nut\" and I don't mean that insultingly because we are *ALL* old-time-radio \"nuts\"! :-) played an episode of \"Just Plain Bill\", a M-F daytime serial which may have gone back to the 1930's.\n\nThe episode he played was from 1955 or 1956.\n\nIt started out with the traditional \"organ\" music, and the announcer came on \"And now, the National Broadcasting Company brings you 'Just Plain Bill'...\"\n\nI recognized the voice (and he did it in his KNOWN 'sing-songish' jovial style) as that of Don Pardo. He didn't identify himself until the END credits, though...Don Pardo's voice was heard again, and\n\nstarted off:\n\n\"How's your portable?...\"\n\nI started thinking WHAT the heck is he talking about? A portable vacuum cleaner? A portable dishwasher? Is this a commercial for a portable appliance or something?\n\nPardo then continues talking about the many *new* compact portable models that also can pick up *FM* and even have Hi-Fi phonograph players! Then, I thought he was doing a commerecial for RCA-Victor radios... he didn't mention RCA though, so it really wasn't a \"commercial\" for\n\nRCA-Victor though... but he continued that the new model portables are PERFECT for bringing to the park or the beach for radio listening enjoyment.\n\n\".... And, on the weekends, when you take that portable radio to the beach or to the park, be sure to hear the NEW WEEKEND RADIO service from NBC... MONITOR.\" \"Yes, Mon-i-tor... News, Sports, Music, Interviews, Entertainment, Variety. All weekend long, on this NBC Radio station!\"\n\nThe organ music started up again, and Pardo started to give the closing announcements: \"You've been listening to 'Just Plain Bill', presented by the National Broadcasting Company... heard in the story were.....\"\n\n\"Be sure to listen again tommorrow, for another in the continuing stories of 'Just Plain Bill'. THIS... is Don Pardo, speaking. This is the NBC Radio Network\" [Bong-bing-bung]\n\nMark J. Cuccia\n\nJanuary 7, 2001\n\nComments: Thanks for the site.\n\nI recall listening to Monitor as a kid in the late 1950s, again as so many others did, in the back seat of my parent's car. Bob and Ray were always a welcomed feature. Then, there was \"On the Line\" with Bob Considine.\n\nLee Kline of WHO, Des Moines, would show up from time to time with a feature report.\n\nIn 1970 while working part time at WHO Radio, I handled the Sunday afternoon and evening Monitor segments. We would \"join\" Monitor after the Minnesota Twins baseball game.\n\nAt the time during station breaks, we used the slogan, \"The 50 thousand watt, clear channel voice of the Middle West, WHO, Des Moines.\" This would take about 5 seconds. I was trying to do the station break and station identification on the half hour before returning to Monitor.\n\nFor some reason, my mind told me that what I was saying was not right. I started and restarted the announcement several times before finally just giving up and giving the legal ID, \"WHO, Des Moines\", closing the microphone and turning up the network feed. The control room engineer had been recording the break on audio tape, and needless to say, that station break was retained in the WHO bloopers file for some time (for all I know it is still there, as I left the station in 1974).\n\nAgain, a great site and tribute to a program which influenced a number of us in the broadcasting business. Monitor demonstrated what radio could and should do. Maybe the time is right to bring it back.\n\nGeorge F. Davison, Jr., Des Moines, IA\n\nJanuary 6, 2001\n\nComments: Isn't it incredible how a sound can bring back such a flood of memories? When a co-worker at a Dallas TV station downloaded the Beacon my first thoughts were not \"where is that strange noise coming from?,\" but of the smell of Wrigley's Spearmint Gum and my father's green, 1969 Impala.\n\nThis is only place I ever heard Monitor -- on the way to camping trips or just down the street running errands. And in those days, my father always chewed Wrigley's Spearmint, I think to help him quit smoking cigars.\n\nWhen my co-worker downloaded the Beacon, I was nowhere near his office, but quickly made my way toward the wonderful old sounder, through a reception area, down two hallways and into his office. Hearing the Beacon after all those years was just incredible. Thank you!\n\nPaul Perdue\n\nDallas, TX\n\nJanuary 6, 2001\n\nComments: Hi Dennis\n\nI worked as an announcer and newsman for an NBC affiliate station, WBOW in Terre Haute, Indiana when Monitor went on the air in June of 1955.\n\nI spent many a Saturday afternoon during my board shift listening to and enjoying this new radio concept.\n\nThe station sold in May, 1957 and the new owner dropped the NBC affiliation.\n\nIt was not until I discovered your web site that I found out how long Monitor really lasted and how it finally came to its end.\n\nYou might be interested to know that I have the original 12\" vinyl record that NBC sent to its affiliates in which Pat Weaver and James Fleming explain the Monitor concept. As a matter of fact the recording is the closed circuit info fed to the affiliates. Its dated April 1, 1955. Fleming presents a portion of the Monitor progamming and Weaver gives his views on the new concept of programming and urges that stations support it.\n\nThe Monitor Web site is terrific. Keep up the good work.\n\nregards,\n\nMartin Plascak\n\nDecember 31, 2000\n\nComments: I first remember listening to the Monitor Beacon on my Dad's Studebaker radio while he was doing errands in the Boston area. I think it was on WBZ. A couple of years later we had moved to Phoenix, and I would sneak out to the Studebaker to listen to Monitor on KTAR.\n\nJonathan Winters was my favorite. 1969 had me working at KCLS in Flagstaff as a board-op during Saturday afternoon Monitor broadcasts. What a treat to be part of the Network I had listened to as a kid!\n\nYour site brings it all back...Thanks I made a copy of the Beacon. In the late seventies I had to chance to visit NBC Radio on business. I asked several of the engineers if they could make me a copy of the Beacon. They searched for the couple of days that I was there, but no Monitor audio could be found. I've been looking ever since.\n\nRalph Gould\n\nDecember 30, 2000\n\nComments: Hi there. Nice site on Monitor.\n\nDo you know if the proximate cause for its demise was the introduction of the NIS scheme?\n\nregards\n\nBarry Mishkind\n\nDecember 30, 2000\n\nEditor's note: On July 15, 1974, NBC announced the appointment of Jack Thayer as president of the NBC Radio division. In early December, Thayer announced the demise of Monitor. Monitor's last program aired on Sunday, Jan. 26, 1975. In early February, Thayer announced the creation of NBC's National News and Information Service.\n\nComments: Funny, when I was a teenager in the mid 1960's (and as a teenage DJ working on and off air for Gordon McLendon's top 40 WYSL Buffalo and later other stations) Monitor seemed like a stogy old presentation that was well.....good for nothing.\n\nHey, I was a Good Guy and a Boss Jock. There was nothing better than talking in and out of a PAMS jingle into a slamming record and walking up to the cue. What else was radio for?\n\nNow, after almost 40 years in the radio and musical jingle business I can really appreciate how much work it took to crank out Monitor each day.\n\nThose \"old\" NBC announcers and their \"scripted\" presentations - and very little ad libs - sure sound a lot better now that I am age 51. The work, the effort and the true professionalism of Monitor can now be appreciated by this tribute site.\n\nGee, I hope I won't appreciate Rap music when I reach age 91.\n\nGood work guys!!\n\nBen Freedman\n\nChancellor\n\nJingle University\n\nDecember 30, 2000\n\nComments: Do your Monitor archives turn up the name, Paul Mason?\n\nFrom the late 50's into the early 60's Paul supported himself roaming, first the Southeastern states, and later South America, filing Monitor feature reports. Buck Prince was his mentor at NBC. Paul had a piece on practically every weekend.\n\nI went with him on a few interviews. The most memorable was a late 1950's interview with a county sheriff and a deputy deep in the back woods of Western North Carolina.\n\nPaul asked the sheriff if he personally knew any moonshiners. His deputy chimed in, \"He oughta, he's on the payroll of all of 'em.\"\n\nFor a tense moment it appeared a shootout was a possibility.\n\nPaul occasionally got pieces on the air at WBT and especially WINS New York. As a result of stringing for WINS, Westinghouse's Joel Chaseman hired him as an anchor at KYW Philadelphia. That didn't last very long. Paul was a great feature digger to have out in the jungles, but bringing him into the home office was not a good idea. Paul was missing some people skills.\n\nMy last contact with Paul was about two years ago. He was living in Charleston SC.\n\nJames Wright\n\nDecember 29, 2000\n\nComments: Listening to the Monitor clips has jogged and triggered my memory from the late 1960's and early 70's, when I was 7/8/9/10/11/12 years old, listening to Monitor on the radio in my parents' kitchen, or in their bedroom, or when we were in the car \"GOING PLACES AND DOING THINGS\"!\n\nALL of the jingles I *DO* remember hearing! :-) I had somewhat forgotten them, but hearing them at your site is DEJU-VU! I KNOW I'd heard them when Monitor was still on, but I didn't have a tape recorder to tape them... the Beacon/Beeper and the \"chimes\" and a few\n\nWell, I've gotta get back to work now... my boss could pop-in at any minute!\n\nMark J. Cuccia\n\nDecember 29, 2000\n\nComments: Hi, Dennis:\n\nOne piece of music I remember Monitor using in the late 50's was an instrumental version of \"You Make Me Feel So Young\" -- from Nelson Riddle's album The Joy of Living. If I'm not mistaken, it was used as a bump-back from the local breaks and was usually picked up in the middle --acknowledging the fact that while the local stations had inserted their contributions, Monitor hadn't gone anywhere. Predictably, it was a perfect piece of program music.\n\nIt's interesting to see how many people remember listening to Monitor in their (families') cars, and sad that ratings never include car radios. My suspicion is that Monitor had a much larger audience than advertisers believed.\n\nHappy New Year to all Monitor fans.\n\nAndy Fisher\n\nDecember 29, 2000\n\nComments: My main memory (and I'm not alone on this, I see) is listening to Monitor in the '60s and early '70s, driving home from Yosemite with my family on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nPat Dodds\n\nDecember 28, 2000\n\nEditor's note: Pat listened to Monitor on KMJ Radio in Fresno, CA.\n\nComments: I've got a question I've been looking for an answer for over 35 years! NBC Radio \"Monitor\" used to play an upbeat version of the song \"Where or When\" by an orchestra/band by the name of Bill (or Bob) Mitchell. I know the record exists and I'd like to get my hands on a copy. Any ideas?\n\nAlso, \"Monitor\" used to do a \"double-play\" of a single tune done by different artists at the bottom of the hour after a station break. Most popular, I believe was \"Fly Me to the Moon\" - usually a vocal version followed by Joe Harnell's instrumental version.\n\nThanks!\n\nTom Vasiloff\n\nDecember 28, 2000\n\nComments: Most people my age (mid-40's) probably remember listening to Monitor from the back seat of the family car on weekend trips. As a kid I had my own concept of what the Monitor Beacon really was (I always envisioned one of those rotating airport light beacons, satellites, the Morse-Code-like bloops and bleeps). Hearing that sound again after so many years caused the memories to flood in; it's almost like hearing a ghost!\n\nGreat radio site; keep up the great work!\n\nRandy Phillips\n\nDecember 27, 2000\n\nComments:\n\nI found the \"monitorbeacon.com\" link from Jeff Miller's \"Broadcast Sound Files\" geocities page (which I've been visiting from time to time for over a year now), and I must say that the Monitor page BRINGS BACK FOND MEMORIES!\n\nAll thru-out the late 1970's and into the 80's, everytime I heard \"MacArthur Park\" (which runs something like 10 minutes) on an AM MOR station or an FM station, there was a part of the song in the instrumental part that made me keep humming to myself:\n\nMon-i-TOR N-B-C\n\nMon-i-TOR N-B-C\n\nAnd I never really KNEW WHY! Except that maybe MacArthur Park was a song regularly played on Monitor in the late 60's/early 70's!\n\nNOW, I listen to the \"Monitor Music/Jingles\" at your site! And, I hear the Monitor musical jingle, with those few strains of MacArthur's Park, followed by:\n\n\"You're on the Monitor Beacon, N-B-C's Monitor's Beacon.....\"\n\nAND I REMEMBER THAT JINGLE!!!!!! :-)\n\nThis site is a REAL nice Christmas gift for me!\n\nMerry Christmas, and have a Monitor Holiday Weekend!\n\nMark J.

If my memory serves me correctly, WCOP was the original NBC affiliate that carried the program; during the latter years, WEZE (Both stations in Boston) became the NBC outlet for the area.\n\nI remember taking the NBC Studio Tour with my uncle, and visiting \"Radio Central.\" Monty Hall was the communicator for the hour or so our group watched the activities of both the technical staff and Mr. Hall. One thing that does stand out in my mind about this trip was that, when the top of the hour was approaching the show ran short, so Monty had to fill for a few minutes. He got into a subject area that ran long, and was cut off on the hour. He was not happy, threw scripts all over the place, not realizing we were watching him !! When he turned around and saw us, He was embarassed, came out of the studio, introduced himself, and apologized for his actions. We were invited into the studio, and chatted with him during the news, which was not normally part of the tour. Having an interest in broadcasting, I found this day to be most interesting.\n\nI am currently working for two municipalities in the area as a Public Safety Dispatcher.\n\nContinued good luck with the site !!\n\nTom Turner\n\nDecember 16, 2000\n\nComments: Just wanted to drop you a quick note to tell you how much I am enjoying the Monitor Beacon site. I'm 47 now, but remember well the sounds of Monitor on my father's car radio as we drove along the Belt Parkway to my grandfather's house in Brooklyn on countless weekends. In fact, the style of Monitor popped into my head when a friend at the VOA asked me what kind of format I thought might work for this country's international broadcaster.\n\nIt was a grand old program--one more thing that we used to have but don't anymore. But you've done a great job bringing it back to life for those of us who remember and want to continue remembering. Thanks and best of luck in the future.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn A. Figliozzi\n\nEditor and Publisher\n\n\"The Worldwide Shortwave Listening Guide\"\n\nDecember 10, 2000\n\nComments: What a great website! Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nI'm a child of the '50s and '60s --- grew up loving Top 40 radio, was an avid fan of Dan Ingram and Cousin Brucie on WABC as well as many other deejays on many other Northeast stations, but for some indefinable reason I always listened to \"Monitor\" on weekends. Perhaps it was because I appreciated the variety. The program was always interesting, the hosts (\"communicators\") were witty and great, and the whole enterprise --- along with NBC Radio in general --- had class.\n\nHow could I forget those weekend hours spent on WTAG in Worcester with Bill Cullen, Henry Morgan, Murray the K, Gene Rayburn, Jim Lowe, David Wayne and all the others? And how I could forget the legendary, weird but wonderful \"Monitor Beacon\" and the galloping rhythm of \"Night Flight to Madrid\" as it introduced the show?\n\nNBC Radio, like the Old Gray Mare, ain't what she used to be. But we can remember. . . and we can celebrate. . . and we can hope that someday we might just hear that \"Beacon\" again.\n\nRev. Doug Drown\n\nBingham, Maine\n\nDecember 4, 2000\n\nComments: Dennis, the first time I remember listening to Monitor was back in 1965 or 1966. From then on till it went off the air in 1975 I would listen to Monitor on WSM.\n\nThere was a weekday version of Monitor called Midday Monitor which WSM did not carry. Frank Blair was not able to do commercials because of his contract restrictions so when Blair was on Monitor Don Russell had to do the commercials.\n\nThanks for putting the dates of Monitor's weekend broadcast on the site each weekend. I enjoy visiting the site every weekend.\n\nCharles Gossett Jr.\n\nDecember 2, 2000\n\nComments: Just perused the Monitor web site. Great stuff! Saw a pix of Durward Kirby. He was a close friend of my Dad's in the early days. Ah yes..the sounds of Monitor. That was radio in the good old days.\n\nPaul Sullivan\n\nDecember 1, 2000\n\nComments: Dennis, Just a note to let you know that I continue to thoroughly enjoy your site. It certainly brings back memories of listening to Monitor on KFI until they dumped it and then picking it up where ever I could, KOB, KOA, KOGO etc. I am looking forward to January.\n\nDon Spuhler\n\nNovember 26, 2000\n\nEditor's note: Don was referring to stations in Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Denver and San Diego, respectively.\n\nComments: Oh Boy, do I love this site. I grew up in the sixties listening to WNBC -- The Conversation Station, when talk radio had real talk, not idealogues.\n\nMonitor on the weekends was an active part of the station and my life. I remember being thrilled at the connections to the wider world and even the cheesy interviews where the hosts would intersperse live questions to taped replies. Will visit often. Hope you're able to post hour long clips from particular weekends. Thanks\n\nLawrence Eisenberg\n\nNovember 26, 2000\n\nComments: In the early 1970's, my airshift included Saturdays at KGBX, Springfield MO, one of the original NBC (Blue) network affiliates. I have fond memories of those old Monitor logs and my work popping in the local ads and breaks.\n\nI especially enjoyed listening to the work of Big Wilson. I wrote him a fan note once and he was kind enough to send me a friendly reply in longhand. :) I'd like to know more about Big's story and career. Can you fill in a few details and post a bio?\n\nRick Hoover\n\nLakeland FL\n\nNovember 22, 2000\n\nComments: Thank you, Thank you. This is a website that I have been looking for. I am writing from Colorado. I'm 43 years old and many a summer afternoon and early evening was spent listening to Monitor while our family was spending time at our cabin in Eldora, Colorado as we listened to KOA radio, an NBC affiliate at the time.\n\nI recently retired from radio after nearly 25 years, a career inspired, in part, by listening to Gene Rayburn, Bill Cullen, Joe Garagiola (my late fathers favorite), and others. I remember hearing Marrakesh Express by CSN on Monitor as well as MacArthur Park, and Perry Como singing \"Seattle.\"\n\nThanks for taking the time to do this website. If you can find some things from Gene Rayburn on Monitor, boy that would really take me back.\n\nThanks again.\n\nTim Shafer\n\nGrand Junction\n\nNovember 19, 2000\n\nEditor's note: I wonder how many other people went into broadcasting because of Monitor? If you did, we'd love to hear from you! And if you have any tapes of Monitor you'd like to share with this website, just write!\n\nComments: Bravo on a site that's been long overdue. Though I came along rather late (I was born in 1960), I remember hearing \"Monitor\" back in the late 60s over KING in Seattle. That \"Monitor Beacon\" brings back memories, and is still quite haunting to listen to.\n\nOne bit of news I could pass along to you - there was some thought by Westwood One/NBC as to a revival of \"Monitor\" in the late 80s. I quote from the minutes of the 11-13-89 joint meeting of the NBC Affiliates Executive Committee and WW1/NBC executives:\n\n\"Network officials wanted input about bringing \"Monitor\" back to life in an abbreviated form. It was suggested by The Committee that network poll affiliates on this and other proposed program offerings.\"\n\nApparently it didn't get too far, because nothing else was ever mentioned about it, as far as I know. Pity.\n\nAnyway, keep up the great work. Looking forward to more additions to the site.\n\nWell, here's another tidbit I found while thumbing through my folder of NBC stuff: from the report of the NBC Radio Affiliates Committee Fall 1987 Meeting:\n\n\"With regards to weekends, the Network indicated that they still want to bring back Monitor and now that the ownership transition is over, they hope to have it ready soon.\"\n\nSo apparently, this had been in the planning stages throughout the mid- to late-80s.\n\nJust thought you'd be interested.\n\nBest wishes...\n\nKenneth Johannessen\n\nEast Wenatchee, WA\n\nNovember 13, 2000\n\nThat's all from East Wenatchee at this time.\n\ng-e-c\n\nEditor's note: In the late 1980's, Broadcasting Magazine reported that NBC was studying bringing back Monitor at the time GE sold off NBC Radio. Someday, maybe, just maybe, GE will re-establish the NBC Radio Network --and Monitor, the greatest network program of all time. We can hope, can't we?\n\nComments: Wonderful...wonderful. Am enjoying the website as no other. It brings back great memories to an old broadcaster. Thanks\n\nHal Kennedy\n\nNovember 13, 2000\n\nComments: I never knew how much I missed Monitor until a recent weekend drive from Oshkosh, Wisconsin to Baltimore. I sure could have used all my 30 Rock friends and the beacon. Radio has officially replaced television as the vast wasteland.\n\nKenneth Schwartz\n\nVoice of America\n\nNovember 12, 2000\n\nEditor's note: I wonder how many others have had the same experience Mr. Schwartz had -- driving and trying to find decent programming on radio. I have. And at those times, I often think of how good Monitor would sound today on weekend radio. Have you ever thought that?\n\nComments: I found it interesting that Don Blair joined NBC in 1974. That's the year I came to NBC as well. I was on WNBC radio but loaned out to the radio network in Monitor's final days to do a voice or two. Today I'm an announcer for the NBC television network as well as MS-NBC and CNBC.\n\nThe reason I'm so excited about old Monitor stuff is because I grew up listening to the show and it probably had a great deal of influence on where I ended up in this business. As a kid I used to love to listen to Bob and Ray. For some reason I remember a bit they did when I was about eight years old. It had to do with \"living next door to the worst person in the world\". In fact there was a sign on their front lawn which read \"the worst person in the world lives here\". They were really ahead of their time with their brand of humor. I also have fond memories of the Monitor Beacon sounder.\n\nProbably the best thing the internet does is allow old memories to never die. Thanks for the site.\n\nBill Rock\n\nNBC-TV\n\nNovember 9, 2000\n\nComments: Congratulations! I hope you are justifiably proud of your efforts, and that it connects you with even more people who share your interest in that great radio series. I'll add a link to it on my Bill Cullen page shortly.\n\nAgain, great job!\n\nMatt Ottinger\n\nNovember 5, 2000\n\nEditor's note: You can access Matt's great tribute page to Bill Cullen (who hosted Saturday afternoon Monitor for years) at The Bill Cullen Homepage.\n\nComments: I just found your site and once again I am amazed by this thing called the www. I remember as a youngster listening to Monitor on WMC-AM 790 in Memphis and thinking how cool it was that the host of The Match Game, Gene Rayburn, was also a DJ! Will be checking back with you often.\n\nSteve Forrest, Somerset, KY\n\nNovember 3, 2000\n\nComments: thanks....great site\n\nBurt Sherwood\n\nOctober 31, 2000\n\nComments: Dennis,\n\nNice job with the Monitor site. I was a maintenance engineer with NBC radio begining in 1982; long after Monitor was gone, but when they were still using most of the same equipment (!), and in that same historic location, Radio Central.\n\nJeff Baker\n\nOctober 31, 2000\n\nComments: It's about time someone started a website for one of the best Network radio shows in the history of broadcasting. I look forward to visiting the site often.\n\nCharles Gossett Jr.\n\nNashville TN\n\nOctober 29, 2000\n\nComments: Your Monitor web page is nicely done. You are to be congratulated. You may recall that I was a summer replacement writer on Monitor in... I think it was the summer of 1967... and then went to work fulltime for the news department, first as a news writer-deskman, later as a producer, senior producer and executive producer of radio news, working for Russ Tornabene.\n\nI know Joe Garagiola was a host in the latter year or two of Monitor, as was Johnny Carson's sidekick, whatshisname. (My memory has faded with the years.)\n\nThanks for bringing back the memories I CAN remember.\n\nBest to you,\n\nEdward B. Hanna\n\nOctober 27, 2000\n\nComments: Great job, and much appreciated as a wonderful touch of nostalgia for an ex-NBCer and, I'm sure, for the NBC audience who enjoyed Monitor for all its great years.\n\nBob Kimmel\n\nOctober 27, 2000\n\nComments: Hi!\n\nI was only a small footnote on the Monitor show. - an engineer in 5C behind the glass,twisting knobs,etc. But I must admit when I saw this web site,it brought back wonderful memories of the happy days of radio when Monitor added substance to the NBC Radio Network.\n\nI do remember the days of 'start-stop' tape interviews where a reporter would ask the questions in the field. The tape would come back to the tape editing room right beside Radio Central. The reporter's voice was editied out and the Monitor host then asked the questions live. This razed hell 'upstairs' and we had to discontinue the practice.\n\nTo all those with whom I worked on weekends - Greetings,and Love!\n\nBob Dreier AM radio Engineering\n\nOctober 27, 2000\n\nEditor's note: Bob Dreier shares more Monitor stories on the \"Monitor Memories\" page.\n\nComments: Hi, my name is Jeff Kulliver. I was an AD and a Director and a Producer for Monitor. Thanks for the web site, it sure brings back memories.\n\nI'm glad someone is still on the Monitor Beacon.\n\nJeff Kulliver\n\nOctober 27, 2000\n\nComments: hi..it's mort hochstein here and if my memory serves, I did pr for monitor along with the inimitable Harvey Victor Fondiller in the late fifties and I hope some of you remember him, now, sadly, long departed\n\nOh, memories of Fitzgerald Smith and Buck Prince and all those people whose commentaries I wrote for $50 bucks a throw, Frank Blair, Arlene Francis, and watching Nichols and May tape impromptu. Cliche coming==those were the days. . I have my own memories and once i digest all that material you have on that super site, I will try to add some ==as they now call it==content., Best..mort\n\nMort Hochstein\n\nOctober 27, 2000\n\nComments: Dennis,\n\nGreat site. Brings back lots of memories. By the way, are you the same Dennis Hart that spent years in TV as a producer, Exec Producer and Asst. News Director (Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco, L.A.)?\n\nIf so, kudos for the tribute to great radio. I fear that really good radio, in this age of megalopolies and satellite and internet radio is going the way of the dinosaur.\n\nRoger Gadley\n\nOctober 26, 2000\n\nComments: Hello there,\n\nI joined the NBC Radio Net as Monitor was winding down in '74 and subsequently ended up doing many of my network hourlies in the body of that weekend radio service....watching Big Wilson, John Bartholomew Tucker, Gene Rayburn and a few others do the last few months shows.\n\nAlso some pretty good guests dropping in...Uncle Miltie for one. Bill Cullen was around doing light commentaries in those days as well. Our good pal Jeannie Houston (now Walden) was always one of my producers.\n\nDuring some clean-outs of storage space at 30 Rock I became the new owner of a classic RCA Red Label 45 rpm with the Monitor sounder on both sides...just slightly different presentations of it...but lots of beep beep, boop, boop et al. I still intend to donate it to one of the broadcast museums. NYC probably has one...but University of Maryland may not. Anyway...I'll be dipping into your website, having been a small part of the end of an era.\n\nDon Blair (I retired from NBC in '89)\n\n(Editor's note: After receiving his e-mail, we asked Don Blair if he was related to NBC's \"other\" Blair, Frank, who hosted Monitor and did the news on the Today Show for years.)\n\nNot related to Frank...but he was on the way out at Today when I arrived. They lived down on the water in Stamford..we were in nearby Darien. One late night...my train broke down near Greenwich as I was on my way in for an early morning weekend shift. I was unable to contact NBC to tell them I was stalled.\n\nNot being in the NBC directory (free-lance for most of my 15 years there) they (NBC operators) called the only Blair they saw...waking Frank at around 3 am on a Sunday to ask him why he wasn't at 30 Rock. A few well-chosen bleeps later...they knew why. We met sometime later at the Stamford Yacht Club and laughed about it. He had his wife and daughter with him..daughter's name was Pat. So I introduced my wife to her...Pat Blair...this is Pat Blair.\n\nHo ho.\n\nOctober 26, 2000\n\nEditor's note: Don Blair shares another story on the Monitor Memories page.\n\nComments: For those of us with memories of radio's glorious past, you have provided an outstanding resource that brings the days of yesteryear into dramatically sharper focus. Monitor was a proud institution for two decades, and as an NBC News hourlies correspondent from January of '74 through June of '75, I have fond memories of concluding my Saturday and Sunday morning shifts about noon with NBC Monitor News On The Hour, and the update feature on the half hour.\n\nHaving the opportunity to see the likes of Big Wilson, Ted Brown, Jim Lowe and John Batholomew Tucker work was always a built-in perk of being a part of that fifth floor world of NBC Radio News.\n\nCongratulations, Dennis, on your labor of love and may you receive many more back-slaps as you add to this marvelous website!\n\nBob Gibson\n\nOctober 25, 2000\n\nEditor's note: Mr. Gibson did the news update during the last live hour of Monitor on Sunday, Jan. 26, 1975, at 5:30 p.m. EST.\n\nComments: Great site! Really enjoyed all of it! I had the pleasure of working for Dick Jennings, who had been the Assistant Managing Editor of Monitor under Buck Prince. Dick and I still talk regularly today. I worked for him from 1962 to 1972 after he left Monitor. In 1976, I started working for CBS Radio, and I'm with Westwood One today, owned in part by CBS (Viacom).\n\nBob Leeder\n\nAffliate Sales\n\nWestwood One\n\nOctober 24, 200\n\nComments: Thanks for your work. I will be checking back from time to time to see if you add anything. I would really like to see some photos of the 5th. floor.\n\nI was an engineer at NBC, Washington starting in 1968 and was involved in Monitor. In addition to taking the programming on the local station, WRC (please see http://www.98wrc.com) we originated some of the hourly newscasts. I was the board op for many of those. We also did many interviews for Monitor...especially field interviews. I remember\n\nlugging my trusty Ampex 602 and a pair of RCA BK-1 microphones with Murray the K to interview Richie Havens at the Cellar Door, a Washington, DC club.\n\nThis indeed was wonderfully interesting programming. Mr. Weaver was a genius!\n\nMike Berry\n\nformer NBC radio engineer\n\nOctober 24, 2000\n\nComments: I want to add my kudos to the accolades you've received for this website. I also want to thank the New York Radio Message Board (don't remember who posted the announcement) for first bringing it to my attention. Once I saw it, I was hooked.\n\nDuring my childhood, my family moved quite a bit, with the result that I heard \"Monitor\" on a number of stations--from WTMJ Milwaukee and KSTP Minneapolis/St. Paul to WGIR Manchester N.H. It must have been about 20 or so in all. WGIR must have been one of the last to carry \"Monitor\" pretty much non-stop on weekends, because even in its last years I remember hearing it at times not listed on the network schedule. I loved the variety and immediacy of it, and the calibre of talent assembled. I'm sorry I missed Bob & Ray's time on \"Monitor\"--I didn't start listening until a few years after they left.\n\nIn \"Monitor\"'s last couple of years, it could be very hard to find. At this time I was living in Tampa, Fla., and the NBC station there, WFLA, didn't carry it. I listened to it, when I could pull it in, at night on WJAX Jacksonville. Sadly, I missed the last broadcast. I knew it was coming, and wished I could have heard it.\n\nI haven't been able to find much on \"Monitor\", so I'm glad you've put all this information together, and look forward to reading and hearing the updates. \"Monitor\" is truly a milestone in radio history, yet it's been overlooked. I hope your site helps give it its due.\n\nAnd Pat Weaver should feel vindicated--I love the \"Beacon\". Even as a child listening to \"Monitor\", I couldn't get enough of it. It must have sounded very futuristic 40 or so years ago, and it's still a great \"theme\".\n\nWill Burpee\n\nOctober 23, 2000\n\nComments: Dennis:\n\nCongratulations on a fantastic salute to a formerly great network service. I look forward to any further information you may add.\n\nThe site certainly brought back many memories for me, especially Gene Rayburn and the 7 second Morton Salt spots... \"no salt salts like Morton Salt salts.\" One could always tell if Rayburn had to stretch, turning a 7 second spot into one of 12 to 15 seconds, or, if he were running short, compressing it into 3 seconds.\n\nIt was great to hear the Monitor beacon again. Thanks for your efforts!\n\nRegards,\n\nDave Coopman\n\nOctober 23, 2000\n\nComments: Informative Site! Love It!

Is it possible he ever popped up on Monitor in its additional couple of years?\n\nGodfrey of course was an NBC staff announcer in Washington in the 1930s before he moved to CBS. After his CBS contract was severed, he appeared on ABC and NBC television shows as well as some syndicated things. I'm open to anything!\n\nIf anyone has any information, reminiscences, memorabilia or whatever relating to Mr. Godfrey, his activities and associates from any time or any where, I will appreciate knowing of same.\n\nWonderful web site! Keep up the great work.\n\nLee Munsick\n\n\"That Godfrey Guy\"\n\nOctober 23, 2000\n\nComments: Dennis;\n\nGREAT SITE!! As one who longs for the REAL NBC to get back into radio, your Monitor site is terrific! I vaguely recall that stations could pick up Monitor in different configurations: the full package of news and features and the Communicator/personality; News and features without the personality/music programming; or News only and wildspotting network ads. I remember listening to NBC O&O WKYC in Cleveland on weekends when it was a Top 40 station and it would only pick up \"NBC Monitor News on the Hour.\"\n\nCongrats!\n\nTerry Morgan from action central (& on the Monitor Beacon)\n\n(G-E-C)\n\nOctober 23, 2000\n\nComments: Wow, what a terrific site! Can't wait to see it grow...with guestbook\n\ncomments, etc. One of my favorite memories comes from 1967...I was 11, and my Aunt\n\nFlorence and Uncle Charles took me on the NBC Tour...when we got to the Monitor\n\nstudios...Ed McMahon was on the air...I waved and he smiled and waved back! A big deal for this kid who dreamed of getting into broadcasting!\n\nI loved listening to Jim Lowe-and if I recall correctly, he was on Monitor and working concurrently at WNEW-AM(and later, or earlier, I'm not sure which), WNBC-AM. I also remember Jim hosting nighttime segments from the Newport Jazz Festival in the early '70s...terrific live performances!\n\nPeter King\n\nCBS News Radio\n\nOctober 22, 2000\n\nComments: A fantastic website that brings back memories of radio in its quality heyday.How many wonderful talents stepped before the NBC mics to send the monitor beacon to listeners from coast to coast.\n\nThanks for the memories!\n\nTed David, Anchor\n\nCNBC\n\nOctober 22, 2000\n\nComments: I have just finished looking over your Monitor website.
