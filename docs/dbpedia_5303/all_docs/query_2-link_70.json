Born into Cincinnati's West End as one of ten siblings, he attended the historical Harriet Beecher Stowe School in his early years and graduated from Hughes High School. His initial music instruction came from participating in church and school choirs, and he was encouraged to study violin and piano at Cincinnati's Cosmopolitan School of Music, the first Black-owned and operated music school in the USA.\n\nIn 1946, Herndon made his début at age 14 at the Cincinnati May Festival, as the Wren in Gabriel Pierne's oratorio St Francis of Assisi conducted by Eugene Goossens.

American opera stages were closed to Herndon as an African American artist in the 1960s, so he sought professional opportunities in Europe. Thomas Schippers invited him to sing at the Spoleto Festival, and Herndon was the first African American to be engaged as the leading tenor at a German opera house, the Stadtstheater in Kassel. He was also contracted at the Bremerhaven Opera.\n\nIn 1971, Herndon returned to America to join the faculty at Central State University in Wilberforce, OH.

Renowned musician and conductor Theodore Thomas became the College's music director. Much of his and the College's funding was provided by Reuben Springer, another wealthy Cincinnatian. At first, the College of Music was located in Dexter Hall, a part of Cincinnati's Music Hall. Later, it moved to a permanent location known as the Odeon, eventually consisting of multiple buildings connected to Music Hall in Over-the-Rhine.\n\nIn 1955, facing financial hardship and internal management conflicts, the College of Music merged with the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music to form the College-Conservatory of Music (CCM).

The company held their first auditions in 1963, and the original troupe consisted of 41 dancers. Oleg Sabline served as the first artistic director, and John A. Spain was the first president of the Board of Trustees. The first performance took place at the University of Cincinnati's Wilson Auditorium in March 1964.\n\nIn 1966, the ballet became more closely affiliated with University of Cincinnati (UC) when David McLain, Head of the Dance Division at UC's College-Conservatory of Music (CCM), became director of the Cincinnati Ballet Company. This connection with CCM allowed the ballet the use of CCM's facilities for classes and rehearsals and UC's Wilson Auditorium for performances. In 1969, Carmon De Leone became music director. Soon after, the company hired ten salaried dancers. During this time, the company gained national recognition for training dancers in the Lester Horton technique. After McLain's death, Hungarian dancer Ivan Nagy was named artistic director from 1986, and he recruited a number of experienced foreign dancers. During Nagy's tenure, the company’s standard of performance was elevated. When Nagy left, Richard Collins became artistic director (1989-92), followed by Nigel Burgoine (1992-94) and Peter Anastos (1994-96).\n\nIn 1994, the company opened a new facility on Central Parkway at Liberty Street that allowed dance studios, rehearsal space, a training school, and offices to be in the same location.
