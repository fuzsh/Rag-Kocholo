Girls in bikinis dancing...er, may have been guys too. later became indoors as Disco 2possibly. Think I saw the McCoys once. roge\n\n91 posts\n\nDec 03, 2010\n\n11:22 AM I remember it well, the host of the show was a guy by the name of Jack Parker RCINKY\n\n25 posts\n\nDec 04, 2010\n\n7:29 AM Best guess would be 65-68, maybe. Kind of a bandstand type format...except for bathing suits. I recall a dark haired girl by the name of chi chi(?) as a fairly regular dancer.

I wasn't much into TV at that time (working long hours) but I suppose that the program originated at the Red Horse.\n\nSounds cool, sorry I missed it. Did they have a restrictive policy on the girls suits?\n\n----------\n\nMikey, Gatlinburg, TN Last Edited by on Dec 04, 2010 8:54 AM RCINKY\n\n28 posts\n\nDec 05, 2010\n\n5:14 PM I think it was the Red horse. I don't think there were restrictions on the girls suits. I was about 13-14 at the time and the girls were a few years older, but as you can imagine i liked the format. One song I remember them playing was summer in the city, by maybe the Loving Spoonful. There was a place in the song where it sort of stopped and the dansers would freeze at that point. Pretty cool.

There was a swimming pool at the motel immediately North of the station's parking lot, with the motel being further north. The pool was filled in to make the Channel 2 parking lot bigger. I think they did a few Phil Donahue shows from the pool area too when it seemed appropriate to the subject of the day and when the weather cooperated.\n\nThere were tons of local shows in the early days of TV and this was one of them. Now open spots in the schedule are filled with syndicated TV game shows and reruns. Hazel\n\n9 posts\n\nDec 06, 2012\n\n10:09 PM I was on Disco 2 when I was in High School. A bunch of us kids from Stebbins and Northridge were dancers on the show that night when they taped. It was a lot of fun. Was anyone else on the show? I believe it was around '65 - '67. Not sure of the year. Last Edited by on Dec 06, 2012 10:10 PM Ronda Richley\n\n1 post\n\nMay 08, 2015\n\n7:17 AM I was on the show too. Disco2 as a regular. I was from Centerville. I was in 8th grade I think so that would put the show in 1965. Any videos????"
