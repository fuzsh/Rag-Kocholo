        "text": "You can’t live in the world of talk radio without eventually having an opinion or two. Darryl Parks has lived talk radio as both a successful radio station program manager and something rather unique in the business: he’s actually a successful talk show host! You mean you can be a corporate suit and a radio personality too? Yep.\n\nBest known for his programming and as a personality at the legendary 700WLW in Cincinnati (you’ll never hear him use the word legendary because he’ll tell you it means “old”), Darryl has set a course focused on the future of audio entertainment in traditional media (traditional means “old” too)…like television, print and radio…and in new media or as industry wonks call it “digital media.” As a consumer you receive it on a computer, an iPad or iPhone…stuff like that. When he says audio entertainment’s future will be on-demand, believe it. OK don’t believe him. Believe NetFlix.\n\nDarryl was named Best Large Market Programmer by Radio Ink Magazine 3 times and was a runner up a bunch of times too. Darryl and the programming team of 700WLW were recognized as the Best Large Market News and Talk station by Radio & Records 4 years in a row. After a record forth year, R&R realizing 700WLW was a radio station they didn’t understand gave up and went out of business, leaving one R&R editor to ponder, “How is this possible? Only occasionally do they discuss politics and they don’t have Rush, Sean and Glenn babbling about Obama being feckless hour after hour.”\n\nFor over a dozen years Darryl’s radio show on 700WLW was consistently the most listened to show in its time period.\n\nDarryl lives in Cincinnati, Ohio with his wife Kathie. He likes to garden and cook. Don’t hold that against him.\n\nDisclaimer: The content, posts and opinions expressed on this site are my own and not that of Simply Money Advisors."
