        "text": "iHeartMedia News/Talk 700 WLW Cincinnati has eliminated political talk from its overnight “America’s Truckin’ Network” show hosted by Steve Sommers.\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer reports that Sommers told listeners of the change on Monday morning’s show after multiple unspecified complaints.\n\nIn the on-air statement, Sommers blamed the change on a group of individuals who took offense with comments made by a caller a few weeks ago. He said, “My father told me that many years ago the least you can deal with your boss the better off you are because if the boss isn’t having to pay attention you’re not in trouble right. Typically anytime you hear from the boss if you’re not doing contract discussions you’ve probably done something wrong. Suffice it to say, somethings are going to change starting right now this morning. That’s where you’re going to be helping to participate because there are somethings we’re not going to talk about anymore. We all know in this country for whatever reason in recent months I guess you can say it all started with George Floyd and the atmosphere has become so politically charged, so divisive talking about the race issues, the confederate flag, bringing down monuments and statues everybody has opinions. Everyone’s entitled to differing opinions. I feel that I’ve always tried to give a balanced approach to my content on the program. Some apparently don’t feel that is the case but just suffice it to say we’re going to avoid such topics.” He went on to explain that he believed that his job was on the line and that they needed the callers help to keep the show focused on issues related to trucking.\n\niHeartMedia Cincinnati SVP/Programming told the Enquirer, “The ATN has been on the air for over 30 years. We regularly review all our shows to ensure they provide the best and most compelling programming, and we have always relied on comments and feedback from our listeners to help us make these decisions.”\n\nSteve Sommers has hosted “America’s Truckin’ Network” on WLW since the retirement of his father Dale ‘The Trucking Bozo’ Sommers in 2003."
