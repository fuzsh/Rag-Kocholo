        "text": "This is the Introduction and two chapters from my 1997 book, Radio Voice, published by University of Minnesota Press. The two chapters are The Disembodied Voice and Under Cover of Daytime, both of which trace the history of women and radio in the US from the 1920s through the 50s, and the creation of daytime radio as a gendered space. Other chapters cover radio and national identity, race and early radio, the discursive tactics of prime time radio, and radio during World War II.\n\nRadio debuted as a wireless alternative to telegraphy in the late 19th century. At its inception, wireless technology could only transmit signals and was incapable of broadcasting actual voices. During the 1920s, however, it transformed into a medium primarily identified as one used for entertainment and informational broadcasting. The commercialization of American broadcasting, which included the establishment of national networks and reliance on advertising to generate revenue, became the so-called American system of broadcasting. This transformation demonstrates how technology is shaped by the dynamic forces of the society in which it is embedded. Broadcasting's aural attributes also engaged listeners in a way that distinguished it from other forms of mass media. Cognitive processes triggered by the disembodied voices and sounds emanating from radio's loudspeakers illustrate how listeners, grounded in particular social, cultural, economic, and political contexts, made sense of and understood the content with which they were engaged. Through the 1940s, difficulties in expanding the international radio presence of the United States further highlight the significance of surrounding contexts in shaping the technology and in promoting (or discouraging) listener engagement with programing content.\n\nBetween the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, the possibilities of three different types of wireless communication technology were made evident to the western world. Instead of uncritically presenting US-based accounts, this article delineates the relationship between radio technology and communication, moulded by the notion of modern science, which bears as a consequence the establishment of broadcasting as a mass phenomenon in western societies. The above-mentioned relationship is explained without downplaying at the same time the existence of relativism in particular social settings. Thus, the article is underpinned by the interplay among the cultural, economic and political factors that finally led to the development of radio broadcasting during the 'Roaring Twenties'.\n\nRadio’s first fifteen years were filled with experiment and innovation, as well as conflicting visions of what broadcasting’s role in society ought to be. But while there was an ongoing debate about radio’s mission (should it be mainly educational or mainly entertaining?), radio’s impact on daily life was undeniable. To cite a few examples, radio was the first mass medium to provide access to current events as they were happening. It allowed people of all races and social classes to hear great orators, newsmakers, and entertainers. Radio not only brought hit songs and famous singers directly into the listener’s home; it also created a new form of intimacy based on imagination -- although the listeners generally had never met the men and women they heard on the air, they felt close to these people and imagined what they must really be like. Radio was a medium that enhanced the importance of the human voice-- vii politicians, preachers, and performers were now judged by their ability ..."
