For the next 16 years Steve solo hosted the program from the studios of the midwestern blowtorch, 700 WLW, which on a good night, reaches a large portion of North America.\n\nIf you’ve listened to the radio at night, odds are, you’ve listened to Steve Sommers.\n\nIn January 2021, Steve rebranded & re-launched the show, as The Steve Sommers Overnight Drive (SSOD). It’s the same great talk show, still originating from the Heart of America, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and engaging with fans, truckers, and listeners from across America.\n\nAffiliates of SSOD appreciate Steve’s coverage of the news of the day, breaking news, topical discussions, major weather events, his guests & interviews, and most of all … the truckers and listeners to the show who act as a massive field reporting team blanketing North America. Quite often, they provide insight and information into important news events and stories they have first-hand knowledge about because they live or travel in or near where the news originates. Truckers are like the canaries in the supply chain coal mine, they know where there are bottlenecks and what prices are rising — especially when it comes to fuel & oil. Along with travelers of all kinds, they see and experience the impact of dangerous weather systems, floods, tornadoes, and their results, and they share that with the SSOD audience.\n\nBacked by his newly & fully equipped Hot Shot’s Secret Studios, listeners can call or text to speak direct with Steve during the live show by calling: 844-844-3388\n\nSSOD is one of the few shows that is feeding LIVE on Sunday night (technically Monday, Midnight – 5 am ET), so even if you just want to add more LIVE programming to your Sunday nights, SSOD can help you do just that.\n\nBe LIVE more, be more engaging, and never let breaking news pass you by at night, when you add The Steve Sommers Overnight Drive to your station."
