During the first decades of the 20th century this river city was not only significant in steamboat commerce, but was also a central railroad transfer point for Jazz bands traveling to Chicago and Detroit, as well as points east(Pittsburgh or Washington DC), and west (St. Louis and Kansas City). Thus the Queen City became known as an early Mecca for Jazz in the heartland.\n\nEqually important to the growth and proliferation of the music, Cincinnati was located only 70 miles south of the historically important recording studio, Gannett Records in Richmond Indiana, which distributed some of the earliest recordings of this music.\n\nIn addition, Cincinnati was a significant contributor to a newly emerging media, broadcast radio. Crosley Broadcasting’s WLW, known as the “Nation’s Station”, was a clear channel 50,000 watt station, capable of reaching both coasts, Canada and Mexico. Among the talent heard on WLW in the early 30’s was Fats Waller, the Mills Brothers, and other regional artists.\n\nTune to Excursions, Saturday Jan. 13th for a historical appreciation of the artistry that emerged from this midwest Jazz mecca."
