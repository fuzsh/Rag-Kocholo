        "text": "Are we still in the so-called golden age of television? Probably not. In the streaming age, quantity has taken precedence over quality. Our screens are flooded with thumbnails for thousands of shows across half a dozen streaming services. Whenever I switch on my home projector, I simultaneously feel like I have too much to watch and nothing at all. Often, by the time I’ve found something worthwhile, I’m too tired to actually press play.\n\nThat’s why this year, I’m doing all the work up front. The era of The Wire and The Sopranos may be behind us, but there’s still plenty of excellent TV being made, and it’s queerer than ever before. From reality shows to comedies to sci-fi adventures, LGBTQ+ representation on the small screen has been expanding dramatically over the last decade, opening up new possibilities for storytelling. I spent the holiday break combing through the release calendar, highlighting the queer shows I think are most likely to be automatic watches. Hopefully this list cuts down on my unsatisfying couch time — and helps you find something to watch, too.\n\nFrom favorites like Yellowjackets that are returning after the Hollywood strikes to Ncuti Gatwa’s first full series as Doctor Who, there are delightful options here for every mood. This year will also include some bittersweet moments: We’ll be saying goodbye to Sort Of after three seasons, and Reneé Rapp will be leaving The Sex Lives of College Girls to focus on her flourishing music career. At the same time, it will be nice to say hello to old friends like Hacks and the criminally underrated Girls5Eva, which are both coming back after two-year hiatuses.\n\nMaybe we’re not in a golden age anymore, but it’s certainly a rainbow one, and there are still plenty of gems to be found. Below, check out our list of 11 anticipated 2024 TV shows.\n\nThe Traitors — January 12\n\nAs TV competition formats proliferate, only a select few have actually broken out from the pack to achieve more lasting success. (It’s almost like reality shows are in a competition themselves…) The Traitors, which now airs versions in multiple countries after the popularity of the 2021 Dutch original, is the most refreshing reality concept in years, capturing all the fun of the party game Mafia without actually having to leave your couch. In the show, a group of people living in a castle race to root out the eponymous “traitors” in their midst, which means everyone has to act like they’re “faithful” even if they’re not. If the traitors make it to the end, they can take the prize pool and run. The American version of the show is hosted by the absolutely legendary bisexual actor Alan Cumming, and its forthcoming second season has plenty of LGBTQ+ representation on the cast, including Peppermint and Survivor winner Parvati Shallow.\n\nFeud: Capote vs. The Swans — January 31\n\nComing to FX and Hulu at the end of this month, the latest Ryan Murphy-created series chronicles the story of gay writer Truman Capote’s betrayal of his coterie of female socialite friends, originally told in the book Capote’s Women. The cast is absolutely stacked, including Naomi Watts and Chloë Sevigny as two of the eponymous “swans”, but it’s Tom Hollander’s take on Capote I’m most excited to see. This is Real Housewives before Real Housewives, complete with fantastic wardrobing and set design.\n\nAbbott Elementary — February 7\n\nThis beloved mockumentary series is due to make its triumphant post-strike return with a ten-episode season. Following a group of put-upon Philadelphia public school teachers, Abbott Elementary manages to capture the woeful state of education funding in this country without ever becoming nihilistically dour about it. Quinta Brunson’s Janine Teagues shines as the Leslie Knope-esque heart of the show, and Chris Perfetti’s turn as the awkwardly “woke” teacher Jacob Hill is one of the funniest characters on TV today. I never thought I’d say this as an adult, but I’m happy school is finally back in session.\n\nSort Of — early 2024\n\nA longtime Them favorite, Sort Of is coming to an end with its third season, due out on Max early this year. (The final season has already aired in Canada, where the show originated.) Following a nonbinary Pakistani Canadian millennial living in Toronto (Bilal Baig), this sitcom has impressed with its sharply observed depiction of gender-expansive life, and the ways in which transition itself is a broadly relatable concept. “Some transitions are major, some transitions are tiny little shifts that are barely noticeable,” Baig told Them when the show first premiered. We will certainly notice Sort Of’s absence, but we’ll always be grateful this story made it to a major streamer.\n\nRipley — TBA\n\nIf Saltburn didn’t make it clear enough, we’re officially in the midst of a Talented Mr. Ripley renaissance. (A Ripley-sance?) Netflix is continuing the grifting trend with an eight-episode limited series that casts Andrew Scott (All of Us Strangers) as the aspiring con artist. Featuring Johnny Flynn as Dickie Greenleaf and Dakota Fanning as Marge Sherwood, Ripley is aiming to be more “faithful” to the original Patricia Highsmith novel, as creator Steven Zaillian told Vanity Fair. We hope that includes the novel’s ample homoerotic subtext.\n\nGirls5Eva — March 14\n\nPremiering on Peacock, Girls5eva flew under the radar for its first two seasons. But it’s probably the sharpest and funniest industry comedy this side of The Other Two, and it deserves to be rediscovered. Fortunately, Netflix resurrected the show for a third season set to debut this March. This musical comedy series follows four women (Sara Bareilles, Busy Philipps, Paula Pell, and Renée Elise Goldsberry) as they reunite their Y2K-era girl group to cash in on a wave of unexpected nostalgia for their act. Featuring the rapidfire, absurdist humor of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and sharing much of the same creative team, Girls5eva is a delightfully zany distraction. But it’s Paula Pell’s performance as a divorced lesbian dentist that packs the series full of queer heart.\n\nHacks — Spring 2024\n\nHacks is coming back, to which I can only say, “Thank God.” We need as much smart comedy on TV as possible. The Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder-starring series went on a literal gay cruise in season two, so I can only imagine what kind of queer misadventures might unfold when the third season makes it to Max this Spring. Hopefully there are more endearing Hannah Einbinder awards show moments in our future, too.\n\nThe Sex Lives of College Girls — Spring 2024\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe spirit of Sex and the City is alive and well — and no, I’m not talking about And Just Like That…, which, while improving, is definitely Its Own Thing. The Sex Lives of College Girls, returning for its third season sometime this spring, is maybe the closest anyone has ever come to capturing the magic of that “four best friends have romantic misadventures” energy. It’s no surprise that the project has proved to be something of a breakout for Reneé Rapp, who is now starring in Mean Girls and touring as a musical artist. While this season will be Rapp’s last, that’s plenty of time for some more sapphic antics. I particularly enjoyed the subplot in which her character, Leighton, hooked up with her “doppelbänger.” I’m hoping for a few more entries in the lesbian lexicon before Leighton leaves campus.\n\nDoctor Who — May 2024\n\nAfter appearing in the well-received Christmas specials, Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor will get his first full series this May. As the first Black gay doctor, Gatwa’s take on the character sets an important historical precedent, especially considering what a fixture Doctor Who has been in the television landscape, but it’s the actor’s charismatic performance that matters most here. From the holiday specials alone, it’s clear how much unbridled fun Gatwa is having, so I’m excited to see what he does with a full set of episodes. Plus, the new season features Yasmin Finney reprising her role as Rose and Jinkx Monsoon in a mysterious role.\n\nWe’re Here — TBA\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis Emmy- and Peabody-winning HBO docuseries will get a brand new set of hosts in its fourth season: Drag Race legends Sasha Velour, Jaida Essence Hall, and Priyanka will be joined by Latrice Royale in season 4 for another year of political outreach under the guise of drag performance. This show is particularly close to my heart: ever since I documented the vibrant LGBTQ+ communities found in red states in my book Real Queer America, I have been passionate about ensuring that we represent the experiences of Americans who live outside of major urban centers. We’re Here isn’t just great television, it’s an important corrective to a media environment that refuses to see the true diversity of Middle America.\n\nYellowjackets — TBA\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nYellowjackets understood two things with absolute clarity: the nineties are cool again, and the Gen Z girlies are absolutely unhinged. How else do you explain the smash success of a show about a girls’ soccer team resorting to cannibalism in the Canadian wilderness? Delayed by the strike, Yellowjackets is expected to air its third season sometime this year, promising more Melanie Lynskey, more Jasmin Savoy Brown, and more Liv Hewson. This is one good thing we can’t get enough of.\n\nGet the best of what’s queer. Sign up for Them’s weekly newsletter here."
