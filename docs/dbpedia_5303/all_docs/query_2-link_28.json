This study explores teaching practices in UK institutions, focusing on modes of bringing lesbian literature into the classroom in an environment which is safe for queer students. The purpose of the study is to capture why it is important to bring queer identities into the classroom, taking a student-centred approach to teaching and learning. The four key focal points of the study are how to create a safe environment for teaching, teaching seminars, teaching lectures, and the purpose of teaching lesbian literature. The study employs numerous UK higher education frameworks to show how lesbian literature fits into the system educators strive to work within."
