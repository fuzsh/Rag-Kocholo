        "text": "Salem to Acquire Miami Signals for Conservative Spanish News/Talk Format. The company announces it has entered into an agreement with Actualidad Media Group, LLC to purchase the assets of Class B daytimer WMYM-AM, Kendall, Florida and translator W254DT (98.7 FM) for an undisclosed sum. Salem Media Group executive chairman Edward Atsinger says, “Salem is beginning a new chapter in Miami as we expand our conservative and family themed programming to the Spanish-language audience. Miami is an obvious market for this expansion, and we’re excited to add great signals like WMYM AM 990 and FM 98.7 to our portfolio.” The company says it has a long history in Spanish-language broadcasting starting in 1984 in New York City with WNYM AM 1380, which was sold in the late 1980s and remains in the Spanish-language format today. Currently Salem owns Spanish-language radio stations in Dallas – KLTY-FM 94.9 HD2 and translator FM 102.5 (Spanish Christian Contemporary Christian Music); KTNO-AM 620 (Spanish Christian Teaching and Talk) in Portland; KRYP-FM 93.1 “El Rey” (Regional Mexican); and in Denver – KBJD AM 1650 (Spanish Christian Teaching and Talk).\n\nCumulus Makes if Official: Rich Valdés to Host Jim Bohannon Show. Last week’s news of Jim Bohannon’s health-related retirement from his longtime late-night Westwood One program indicated that Mark Levin show associate producer Rich Valdés would be assuming hosting duties for the show. Now, Cumulus Media makes it official and says Valdés will be the permanent host for the program that will continue to be called “The Jim Bohannon Show.” Valdés welcomed Levin as his first guest on the program last night (10/170. Levin comments, “Jim Bohannon is a legend. He’s also the #1 gentleman of talk radio. His absence from radio will be deeply felt. But there is no better person to assume that slot than my dear friend and colleague, Richie Valdés. Richie V, aka Mr. Call Screener, has been a fill-in host for me and is superb. He is compelling, entertaining, smart, and an unapologetic patriot. I could not be happier for him and, even more, the great radio audience.”\n\nRadio Hall of Fame Names WTOP’s Julia Ziegler ‘One to Watch.’ The Museum of Broadcast Communicationsannounces today that the Radio Hall of Fame names Julia Ziegler, director of news and programming for Hubbard Broadcasting’s all-news WTOP-FM, Washington as the recipient of its “One to Watch” award. The “One to Watch” award was created in 2018 in honor of radio legend and 2012 Radio Hall of Fame inductee Art Laboe, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 97. Each year, the nominating committee selects what it considers a promising radio personality or team who has demonstrated ratings success, audience growth, and impact on one or more radio stations and their communities. Ziegler began her career at WTOP in 2002 as an intern. From 2015 to 2019, she served as WTOP’s digital news director, where she oversaw the creation and development of WTOP’s digital news products, including WTOP.com, the WTOP app, social media, video, podcasts, smart speakers and more. She was part of the WTOP team that created and produced the award-winning true crime podcast, “22 Hours: An American Nightmare.” She rose to her current position in 2019. Nominating committee chair Dennis Green comments, “It is with great pride that we honor Julia Ziegler with this year’s ‘One to Watch’ award. Julia has literally done it all at a station that is one of the most highly respected in the nation. From interning at WTOP to working her way up to director of news and programming while setting the station’s path in digital and social media, this recognition is well deserved. On behalf of the Radio Hall of Fame nominating committee, congratulations, Julia, and continued success!”\n\nWayne Allyn Root Inducted into Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Pictured above is Las Vegas-based, nationally syndicated talk show host Wayne Allyn Root with his wife Cindy at the Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame Gala on October 15.

Melania and I send our best wishes to you, your wonderful family, and all those attending the 26th Broadcasters’ Hall of Fame Gala to celebrate your success and the success of your fellow inductees. This extraordinary honor is the result of your lifelong commitment to excellence, principled leadership, and perseverance. Your hard work and determination have provided the foundation for your continued success and exemplify the American Dream.”\n\nNew Fisher House Program Available November 1.

Data from the third quarter of 2022, according to Comscore, FOX News Digital finished the period as the top-performing news organization in the competitive set in multiplatform minutes and views. FOX News Digital closed out the quarter delivering over 8.5 billion total multiplatform minutes, over 4.3 billion total multiplatform views, and averaged 80 million monthly multiplatform unique visitors…..NRG Media’s news/talk KXEL-AM, Cedar Rapids-Waterloo, Iowa reports that it is replacing “The Jim Bohannon Show” with two programs – an expansion of Starnes Media Group’s “The Todd Starnes Show” and Key Networks’ “No Spin News” with Bill O’Reilly. Station program director Jeff Stein says, “Our audience loves Todd Starnes’ common-sense conservativism and has asked us to find a way to carry the full program. There’s no better way to fill the shoes of a radio hall-of-famer than to provide more of a show that has already proven to be popular with Iowans. Adding ‘No Spin News’ is a logical move, based on the success of both the ‘O’Reilly Morning Update’ and ‘Bill O’Reilly Update’ we air each morning.”…..FOX Sports Radio’s LaVar Arrington – co-host of the network’s weekday morning program “Two Pros and a Cup of Joe” with Brady Quinnand Jonas Knox, and co-host of the nationally-syndicated weekend program/podcast “Up On Game” with TJ Houshmandzadeh and Plaxico Burress – announces today the addition of comedian and social media influencer Bubba Dub to the “Up On Game Presents” lineup with his new show, “Trashh Talk Podcast with Bubba Dub.”\n\nMidterm Elections, Russia-Ukraine War, The Economy, Trump Legal Issues, China Politics, Ye-Parler Deal, and British Politics Among Top News/Talk Stories Yesterday (10/17).

One of the most proficient and classiest talk/radio personalities the country has ever heard – Jim Bohannon – will hang up the headsets on his eponymous program this Friday (10/14).

Beginning next Monday (10/17), Rich Valdes will succeed Bohannon on the weeknight, three-hour (10:00 pm – 1:00 am) Cumulus Media Westwood One broadcast. Bohannon states, “It’s been a great 40 years with Westwood One – the last 30 of which as host of ‘The Jim Bohannon Show.’ I’ve enjoyed every minute of our daily nighttime town hall with my guests, callers, and all of America. “Now, I’d like to introduce Rich Valdes, a very bright, vibrant young man who will be taking over in the same tradition.” Cumulus Media executive vice president of corporate marketing/Westwood One president Suzanne Grimes remarks, “We celebrate Jim’s long radio history and all his achievements, including his induction into the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame; the First Amendment Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association; the Lifetime Achievement Award from TALKERS Magazine; and his inductions into the National Radio Hall of Fame and the Missouri Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. We are especially proud that Jim has been an invaluable member of our Westwood One family these many years – he is truly an industry legend. As we pass the baton to Rich Valdes, we’re excited to bring a new name and voice to talk radio. We look forward to continuing our tradition of providing the best programming to our affiliates and listeners.” Valdes notes, “No one can ever fill Jim’s shoes. I consider it a blessing and great honor to be part of the next generation of late-night talk show hosts, following the tradition of Jim Bohannon and Larry King.” TALKERS founder/publisher Michael Harrison has a very candid conversation with Bohannon on PodcastOne’s “The Michael Harrison Interview,” which drops tomorrow (Tuesday, 10/11).
