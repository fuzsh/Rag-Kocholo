        "text": "Madidi National Park in Bolivia is one of South America’s most amphibian-rich protected areas, new research has found.\n\nThe park is home to at least 127 species of amphibians, the study’s authors write, representing nearly 46% of Bolivia’s total amphibian diversity.\n\nMadidi’s diversity is a reflection of the park’s “extraordinary altitudinal gradient,” Robert Wallace, co-author of the study and an ecologist at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society, told Mongabay in an email.\n\nSpanning an area of 18,958 square kilometers (7,320 square miles), the park ranges in elevation from 180 meters (590 feet) in the Amazonian lowlands, to towering mountain peaks at 6,044 m (nearly 20,000 ft) in the Andes. This creates a “wide variety of habitats with different climate conditions,” Wallace told Mongabay.\n\n“At the scale of amphibians, this variety of conditions creates very distinct scenarios, where different species eventually emerge as a result of adaptations to each particular environment,” Wallace said.\n\nToday, amphibians are one of the world’s most threatened groups of animals, facing pressures from habitat loss, climate change, fungal diseases and the illegal wildlife trade. This is why documenting amphibian diversity in places like Madidi is crucial, the researchers write.\n\nTo establish a baseline, Wallace and his colleagues scoured various scientific publications, technical reports, photographs and museum collections for records of amphibians. They also surveyed 15 sites within Madidi between 2015 and 2017 as part of the “Identidad Madidi” expedition. This expedition previously added nearly 1,400 records of plants and animals to Madidi.\n\nIn the latest study, the team confirmed the presence of 127 amphibian species in Madidi. Of these, three frog species are new records for Bolivia: the canelos tree frog (Boana appendiculata), diadem robber frog (Pristimantis diadematus), and Jiménez’s robber frog (Pristimantis lacrimosus).\n\nFifteen species are also first records for Madidi, including the Demerara Falls tree frog (Boana cinerascens) and Cochranella nola, a type of glass frog.\n\nMoreover, 10 amphibian species could be entirely new to science. This initial hypothesis of the frogs’ novelty is based on physical traits like body size, weight and color that differ from other known frogs, Wallace said.\n\nThe researchers are conducting several analyses, including genetic studies and comparisons of vocalizations, to confirm whether these amphibians are truly new to science.\n\nThe researchers also documented 31 amphibian species in the areas surrounding the park, which they say could also be found inside Madidi. The park’s amphibian checklist is also likely to grow longer as more surveys are conducted, the researchers write, and Madidi could surpass other megadiverse South American national parks like Yasuní in Ecuador and Manu in Peru in amphibian diversity.\n\n“This would position Madidi as the most diverse protected area in terms of amphibian diversity,” the authors write.\n\nBanner image of Manaus slender-legged tree frog (Osteocephalus taurinus) by Moraes L. J. C. L. et al. via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nBrazilian authorities announced a recommendation to suspend all ongoing and future REDD+ and carbon credit projects on Indigenous and traditional territories in the state of Amazonas. The announcement follows a series of reports by Mongabay and others highlighting the potential problem of timber laundering associated with REDD+ projects.\n\nREDD+, short for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, is a United Nations mechanism to cut global carbon emissions by paying local people to keep forests intact that might otherwise be cut down. The U.N. estimates deforestation and forest degradation accounts for roughly 11% of global carbon emissions so keeping forests intact is a high priority.\n\nIn theory, companies, countries and individuals offset their emissions by buying carbon credits, which are generated by forest communities, many Indigenous, keeping their forests standing. It’s a win-win for cutting emissions, protecting biodiversity, and helping forest communities defend their land from illegal logging, mining and agriculture.\n\nHowever, an analysis by the Center for Climate Crime Analysis (CCCA), a Netherlands-based nonprofit, at the request of Mongabay, found two major carbon offsetting projects in the Brazilian Amazon were used to launder timber from illegally deforested areas. The carbon credits generated by the projects led by Ricardo Stoppe Jr., a doctor from São Paulo, were sold to companies like Nestlé and Toshiba.\n\nThe CCCA analysis found inconsistencies between the amount of logged timber declared to authorities and the amount logged based on satellite imagery. The inconsistency amounted to roughly 4,200 truckloads of wood illegally harvested from the forest.\n\nA month after the Mongabay investigation, Brazilian authorities launched a raid on the projects in question. In the country’s largest raid on carbon credit projects, authorities found that three projects named by Mongabay — Fortaleza Ituxi, Unitor and Evergreen — sold carbon credits and issued fake documents to launder timber taken from illegally deforested areas. Authorities estimate the companies made 180 million reais ($34 million) from selling “rotten” carbon credits. The government also found the projects engaged in land grabbing of public land valued at 820 million reais ($155 million). Five people, including Stoppe, were arrested in the operation.\n\nThe Public Ministry intervened after the Amazonas government selected several companies to carry out REDD+ projects in the state, including Carbonext, which was involved in the Stoppe case. The timing suggests federal authorities are asking for the projects to be suspended now before further damage can be done by fraudulent REDD+ projects.\n\nBrazil’s Federal Public Ministry cited the Mongabay’s reporting in its announcement to suspend REDD+ projects in Amazonas. The ministry also outlined several requirements that must be met before projects can resume. These include showing scientific proof that the projects are effective at reducing climate impacts via carbon credits or REDD+. Projects must also demonstrate they don’t violate the rights of the Indigenous and traditional communities involved, and show they have the communities’ free, prior and informed consent.\n\nThe announcement also says that failure to comply with these measures could result in legal action.\n\nBanner image: courtesy of Vicente Sampaio/Imaflora.\n\nIndigenous peoples in Peru living in voluntary isolation or only recently contacted by the outside world face continued threat from expanding oil and gas activities in their reserves, a new report by the nonprofit Earth Insight has found.\n\nAccording to Peru’s Ministry of Culture, the country has some 7,500 Indigenous people living in isolation and initial contact, or PIACI. These communities’ established and proposed Indigenous territorial reserves cover nearly 8 million hectares (20 million acres) of Amazon Rainforest. However, new maps by Earth Insight show that currently active and proposed oil and gas concessions overlap with 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) or 20% of PIACI reserves.\n\n“The amount of hectares threatened in established and proposed reserves is shocking, along with the fact that there are so many oil and gas blocks, varying from promotional blocks to production blocks, surrounding these reserves and threatening around 435 Indigenous communities,” Edith Espejo, program manager at Earth Insight, told Mongabay.\n\nPIACI live in some of the remotest, most intact and biodiverse parts of the Amazon. They’re also highly vulnerable to exchanges with outsiders like loggers, miners, drug traffickers and missionaries: the Indigenous communities typically lack immunity to otherwise common diseases, and contact with the outside world increases risks of violent encounters. In July, for instance, members of the Mashco Piro community, thought to be the world’s largest isolated Indigenous group, reportedly had a violent altercation with loggers on the fringes of their officially recognized territory.\n\nSimilarly, oil-related activities have “significantly impacted Indigenous territories, affecting 41 out of 65 recognized Indigenous tribes in Peru,” the Earth Insight report notes.\n\nFor example, exploration, production and transportation of oil in the Peruvian Amazon resulted in some 474 oil spills between 2000 and 2019. Many of these spills have contaminated important rivers that the Indigenous peoples rely on, like the Marañon, compromising the communities’ food and health. Oil and gas operations also open up the forests to illegal logging and drug trafficking. “Over the past decade, 143 cases were filed against 16 oil companies for environmental violations,” the report notes.\n\nYet, new oil and gas blocks continue to be announced. In February 2023, Peru’s state energy agency, Perupetro, announced 31 new oil and gas exploration areas in the basins of rivers like the Marañon and Ucayali. That same month, the agency announced the reactivation of Lot 192, Peru’s biggest oilfield, which overlaps with several Indigenous territories, for a period of 30 years.\n\n“If you look at the map, a large portion of the proposed Napo Tigre reserve is covered by oil and gas blocks,” Espejo added. “It was important to report on because reserves like this can get caught up in bureaucratic processes for decades, in part because they overlap with oil and gas blocks. The Napo Tigre Reserve was first proposed back in 2003 and has not moved forward in the approval process, which is supposed to only take about two to three years.”\n\nUpdate (08/13/2024): The story was updated to include comments from Edith Espejo.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa recently signed into law a new climate change act, the first of its kind for the country. The legislation aims to both reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change already baked into the global system.\n\nThe new law aims to set South Africa on a path to meet its commitments to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. To achieve this, the legislation requires more than 20 government departments and state-owned entities to develop strategies to adapt to climate change and meet national emission goals. For example, the legislation establishes that ministers must set emissions reduction targets for each sector of the economy, including energy, transport and agriculture, that are in line with the country’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction trajectory.\n\nWhile pivotal, the climate change legislation has received some criticism for “watering down” penalties and compliance measures, following corporate lobbying.\n\n“But what it lacks in teeth, it makes up for in equal measure in its substantive provisions on adaptation, sector targets, generous principles and cooperative governance,” Olivia Rumble, a climate change policy expert with the South Africa-based consultancy Climate Legal, wrote for the news outlet African Climate Wire. Rumble co-led the drafting team of the first iteration of the climate change bill.\n\nSouth Africa is among the world’s top 15 largest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The country is also the largest economy in Africa and the largest per capita emitter of GHGs on the continent. Most of the country’s emissions, 83%, come from burning coal. The new law is potentially a radical change in terms of how the country is powered.\n\nAt a recent press conference, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, South Africa’s minister of electricity and energy, said he was going to be “ultra-aggressive” on renewable energy, according to a Reuters report. “We are going to be the leaders on this continent in relation to renewables,” he said.\n\nIn July, President Ramaphosa addressed a climate resilience symposium in South Africa where he said he aims to reach net-zero emissions for South Africa by 2050. He also outlined the damage climate change has already caused the country, including floods that destroyed homes, drought that hurts the most vulnerable small scale farmers, and severe storms that stopped shipping offshore.\n\n“It is critical that we strengthen systems for adaptation and mitigation, build resilience in communities and accelerate our decarbonization efforts and the pace of the just energy transition,” he said at the symposium. “If we work together, if we understand the risks and if we appreciate the urgency, we can make our country climate resilient. And in doing so, we can build a sustainable future for generations to come.”\n\nBanner image of Arnot Power Station in South Africa.

Industrial whaling until the mid-1900s severely depleted their populations, and the species is classified as vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThe recently hunted fin whale was a male measuring 19.6 m (64.3 ft) and weighing more than 55.8 metric tons, according to Japanese media. It was caught off Japan’s coast by the Kangei Maru, a mega whaling ship owned by Tokyo-based company Kyodo Senpaku Co.\n\n“Australia is deeply disappointed by Japan’s decision to expand its commercial whaling program by adding fin whales,” Australia’s environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said in a statement.\n\nJapan resumed commercial whaling in 2019, after some 30 years of hiatus. Prior to that, the country was part of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), an intergovernmental body that governs whaling and the conservation of whales. In 1986, the IWC implemented a blanket moratorium on whale hunting. Japan protested against it, citing the country’s historical whaling tradition and whale-eating culture. However, after stiff resistance and threats of economic sanctions from the U.S., Japan withdrew its resistance.\n\nFollowing the moratorium, Japan stopped “commercial whaling” on paper, but continued to hunt whales under an exception provided for scientific research, with the help of whaling company Kyodo Senpaku. Using the research loophole, Japan hunted hundreds of whales every year, including Antarctic minke whales (B. bonaerensis), common minke whales (B. acutorostrata), Bryde’s whales (B. brydei), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and sei whales (B. borealis).\n\nJapan has now been hunting whales commercially along with Iceland and Norway. Last year, Japan caught nearly 300 common minke, Bryde’s and sei whales in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. A quota of 59 fin whales was added to Japan’s list of commercial whaling species in May 2024, a decision that drew criticism from international conservation organizations, governments as well as Japanese citizen groups. Additionally, Kyodo Senpaku launched its largest-ever whaling ship, the Kangei Maru, earlier this year, prompting concerns that Japan might have plans to hunt whales outside its maritime territory.\n\nJapan’s latest whale kill comes days after Paul Watson, founder of U.S.-based marine conservation activism group Sea Shepherd, was arrested in Greenland for his anti-whaling protests against Japanese vessels.\n\n“It is very disappointing to see fin whales now being added to the list of whales being killed by the Japanese whaling fleet. It sets us back 50 years,” Alex Cornelissen, the global CEO of Sea Shepherd, said in a statement on X. “With whale populations already under increased pressure from climate change and dwindling krill numbers, we need more protective measures to safeguard the great whales.”\n\nBanner image of fin whale by chris buelow via Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0).\n\nPlants that grow under the glare of artificial lighting like streetlights have tougher leaves that insects find hard to eat, new research has found.\n\nThis finding suggests that artificial light at night could be a potential threat to urban biodiversity, study co-author Shuang Zhang, an ecologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Mongabay in an email.\n\nOn the lit-up streets of Beijing, Zhang and his colleagues observed something peculiar. Tree leaves on these streets showed little sign of insect damage compared to natural areas outside the city.\n\nThe researchers suspected the streetlights could have a role to play. So they chose 30 sites on Beijing’s streets from where they collected nearly 5,500 leaves from 180 trees, belonging to two common species in the city: Japanese pagoda (Styphnolobium japonicum) and green ash trees (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). The team calculated the amount of night-time artificial light each site was exposed to and measured various aspects of the leaves, including their size, toughness, and signs of insects chomping on them.\n\nThe study found that leaves collected from brightly lit-up spots had tougher leaves than those picked up from relatively low-light sites. Moreover, the tougher the leaves, the less insect damage they had. Leaves collected from the brightest spots had no sign of insects feeding.\n\nThe researchers don’t yet know why these patterns exist. However, Zhang told Mongabay one hypothesis is that trees exposed to artificial lights at night may be extending their photosynthesis period. The additional light could also be altering where the plants allocate their resources, whether toward growth of the trees themselves, or to create tougher leaves that herbivorous insects find hard to eat.\n\n“These leaves might allocate a greater proportion of resources to structural compounds, such as fibers, which could lead to an increase in leaf toughness,” Zhang said in a statement.\n\nArtificial light also introduces a different type of light than sunlight, moonlight or starlight. So the type of light emitted by Beijing’s streetlights could also be influencing the tree leaves, Ellen Cieraad told National Geographic. Cieraad is a plant ecologist at New Zealand’s Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology and wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nIt’s not just insect food preferences that are affected by artificial lights. Light pollution can wreak havoc on wildlife in many ways. It messes up turtle hatchling navigation, confuses migratory birds, interferes with how bats move and feed, and is thought to be a major driver of insect population declines.\n\nThe effects of Beijing’s streetlights don’t end with tough leaves that insects find hard to munch on. Less food for insects also affects other urban animals up the food chain, the researchers write in the paper. This suggests that nighttime artificial light “may have far-reaching effects on the maintenance of urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning,” they add.\n\nBanner image by Lamiot via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)"
