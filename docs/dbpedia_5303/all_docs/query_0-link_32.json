Its weak signal cannot be heard indoors.\n\n570 WWRC Washington, DC\n\n“570 The Answer” – conservative talk\n\n32 miles from my home\n\nWWRC is a local-grade signal almost all day and night at my home. It is simulcast on nearby Warrenton, VA’s 1250 WRCW. From the late 1950s until 1992, the signal was the AM side of classical WGMS, which was heard on DC’s 103.5 FM until 2006.\n\n600 WCAO Baltimore, MD\n\n“Heaven 600” – religious\n\n59 miles from my home\n\nWCAO is much more stronger in my car than indoors. It broadcasts HD Radio, but I have never decoded it at my home.\n\n630 WSBN Washington, DC\n\n“The Sports Capitol; ESPN Radio” – sportes\n\n25 miles from my home\n\nWSBN is Washington, DC’s ESPN Radio affiliate. The signal, up until 2019, was WMAL with a talk radio format. WMAL was also simulcated on 105.9 WMAL-FM Woodbridge, VA. The FM side of WMAL still exists today.\n\n730 WTNT Alexandria, VA\n\n“La Capital” – spanish\n\n10 miles from my home\n\n“La Capital” is a very strong signal heard 24 hours at my home. It can also be heard on 102.9 W274BH Chantilly, VA in the western suburbs of Washington, DC. It was first logged in 2006 as “Triple X ESPN Radio” WXTR with a sports format.\n\n780 WAVA Arlington, VA\n\n“105.1 WAVA” – religious\n\n17 miles from my home\n\n780 WAVA is co-owned with 105.1 WAVA-FM. It airs a religious format, including mostly preaching programs.\n\n820 WWFD Frederick, MD\n\n“The Gamut” – AAA\n\n53 miles from my home\n\nWWFD is the first all-HD Radio signal in the United States, meaning those with analog AM radios cannot receive the station at all. It dropped analog programming and went all-digital in 2018. It airs “The Gamut,” an AAA-formatted signal heard on multiple FM translators in the Washington, DC area, including an HD Radio subchannel of Washington’s 103.5 WTOP. At my home in Virginia, WWFD is a weak signal, often subdecoding on my radios but rarely decoding fully. It was first logged in 2008 as politics-formatted “Federal News Radio.”\n\n900 WCLM Laurel, MD\n\n“Radio America 900” – spanish\n\n36 miles from my home\n\nWCLM has been airing Spanish music since I first logged them in as WILC in 2010. The call letters changed to WCLM in 2018. They are a strong signal in my car, but very weak to undetectable indoors.\n\n920 WURA Quantico, VA\n\n“Radio Unida” – spanish\n\n7 miles from my home\n\nWURA first signed on in 2010. It is a very strong signal that can be heard all day and night at my home, often clobbering 910 and 930 AM to the point where other signals cannot be heard.\n\n980 WTEM Washington, DC\n\n“The Team 980” – sports\n\n25 miles from my home\n\nWTEM was “Sports Talk 980” for years, but it recently changed its name to “The Team 980.” It is a very strong signal heard all day, although it battles with Troy, NY’s 980 WOFX at night. The signal has a long history as WRC, which aired NBC radio in the 1940s and had a news and CHR format from that point until the 1970s. It began its current sports format in 1998.\n\n1030 WWGB Indian Head, MD\n\n“Poder 1030” – spanish\n\n25 miles from my home\n\nWWGB is a strong signal at my home. It has aired a Spanish format since my first logging of them in 2006.\n\n1050 WBQH Silver Spring, MD\n\n“La Mera Mera” – spanish\n\n27 miles from my home\n\nFirst logged as an AM simulcast of Washington, DC’s 103.5 WTOP news format, the station flipped to Spanish as WBQH by 2011. It is a strong daytime signal that cannot be heard at night. WBQH is also heard on translator 93.5 W228DI in Silver Spring, MD. The signal has been home to over a dozen callsigns and formats over the years, most notedbly WGAY upon its debut in 1946.\n\n1090 WBAL Baltimore, MD\n\n“WBAL Radio 1090” – news/conservative talk\n\n55 miles from my home\n\nWBAL is a news/talk station that can be heard strong during the day, but weak at night.\n\n1120 WUST Washington, DC\n\n“New World Radio” – ethnic from my home\n\n17 miles\n\nWUST is a daytime-only signal that often renders adjacent frequencies useless on all of my home radios due to its strength. It airs brokered ethnic programming and is co-owned with 1190 WCRW.\n\n1190 WCRW Leesburg, VA\n\n“China Radio International” – ethnic\n\n17 miles from my home\n\n1200 WAGE Leesburg, VA, a talk station, signed off in 2011 and moved to 1190 AM. The new signal, WCRW, had an AC format. In 2019, I noticed the station had an ethnic format.
