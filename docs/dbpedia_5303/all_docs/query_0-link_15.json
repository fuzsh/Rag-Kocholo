        "text": "Origins\n\nOn September 29, 1934, four AM radio stations—WXYZ in Detroit, WGN in Chicago, WOR in New York, and WLW in Cincinnati—agreed to form a cooperative, program-sharing radio network. WGN and WOR controlled the operation (first dubbed the Quality Group), and the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated in Illinois one month later. When WXYZ (which had contributed the popular western adventure program The Lone Ranger) withdrew to join the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in 1935, Canadian station CKLW in Windsor, Ontario (serving the Detroit market), replaced it. (The Lone Ranger remained on Mutual until 1942 under contractual obligation.)\n\nAfter a year on the air, the new network carried 40 hours of sustaining (non-advertiser-supported) programs and 20 hours of commercial programming per week. The network’s first coast-to-coast broadcast came in September 1936, and by 1940 Mutual had 160 affiliates, nearly 20 percent of the stations then on the air. As Mutual’s stations in rural areas often had less power than the affiliates of the older national networks, many stations held primary affiliations with the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) or NBC and only a secondary relationship with Mutual. Nevertheless, Mutual had more affiliates than any other network—a record it held into the 1980s.\n\nWhen Mutual won the rights to carry the 1938 and 1939 baseball World Series broadcasts, CBS and NBC would not allow their affiliate stations to contract with Mutual for the popular sportscasts. Mutual’s complaints to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) led to an investigation of network radio from 1938 to 1941. In 1943 the FCC’s new network rules were upheld in a landmark Supreme Court decision, helping to even the playing field for Mutual.\n\nMutual news\n\nMutual began to carry more news as the European political crisis worsened in the late 1930s. Listeners heard correspondents via shortwave during the Munich Crisis of 1938, including London representative John Steele and Berlin correspondent Sigrid Schultz (who may have been the first woman to serve as an overseas radio news correspondent). Mutual also picked up reports from various news agency stringers, including Walter Kerr of United Press.\n\nMutual took advantage of a cost-saving technique in 1938 when WOR began recording English-language news broadcasts transmitted by European shortwave stations (especially the British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] Empire Service), and Mutual rebroadcast them unedited, often juxtaposing opposing sides of a story. This technique drew considerable praise from radio critics as a way of allowing listeners to hear all the points of view on the news of the day and enabling them to judge the propaganda for themselves without the commentary offered on CBS and NBC.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Mutual affiliate WOL provided many of Mutual’s public affairs and commentary programs, including that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis, Jr., the public affairs panel American Forum of the Air, and similar offerings. Mutual soon became known for controversial news commentators, including columnist Drew Pearson, Gabriel Heatter (who covered the trial and execution of the kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby in the mid-1930s), and Raymond Clapper (who replaced Swing). Pickups from other Mutual stations were usually confined to special events. The local affiliate was expected to feed any major event to the whole network. Mutual was the first on the air with the news of the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, six minutes ahead of CBS and NBC. By 1945 Mutual’s newscasts were a 24-hour operation, and Mutual was the first national network to include FM stations as affiliates after World War II, by which time the network reached nearly 85 percent of the country’s homes.\n\nBy the mid-1940s Mutual was offering more sportscasts, including boxing matches, the World Series, and such football contests as the Cotton Bowl. Sports continued to be a Mutual mainstay for decades. By the 1970s Mutual also had radio rights for several golf and tennis tournaments. By the mid-1980s the network was carrying five weekday sportscasts plus nearly 40 weekend reports.\n\nIn 1978 interviewer Larry King inherited the nightly Mutual talk-show slot that had been pioneered by Herb Jepko and taken over by “Long John” Nebel until his death. King was on for 90 minutes, and listeners could call in for another 90. The program ran until 1994, airing in the afternoon for its final years.\n\nDecline\n\nMutual ended its cooperative operation in 1952 when the network was purchased by General Tire and set up in New York. In the late 1950s network ownership changed several times, often within months, and none of its owners had sufficient funding to move Mutual into television. On at least two occasions, a shortage of funds threatened to close network operations, and Mutual filed for bankruptcy in 1959. The number of employees dropped to only 50, compared with 350 at its peak in the 1940s. The network faced a scandal when it was discovered that one short-term owner had secretly accepted money from a Caribbean country in return for favourable comment on the air, and Mutual lost 130 of its affiliates.\n\nOwnership changes continued as the network shifted its headquarters from New York to Washington, D.C., in 1971. In 1972 Mutual began special network feeds to African American and Spanish-programmed stations with news and sportscasts. In 1977 then-owner Amway bought Mutual’s very first outlet owned and operated by the company, WCFL in Chicago, followed in 1980 by the purchase of WHN in New York. Mutual also signed a contract with Western Union to use its satellite facilities, thus becoming the first radio network to employ satellite distribution. Aided by its satellite network, Mutual served 950 affiliates by 1979, but the number slowly declined.\n\nMutual was purchased by Westwood One in 1985. In its last 15 years Mutual largely produced newscasts. Westwood One closed Mutual on April 18, 1999, but its newscasts continued under the marketing name of CNN Radio.\n\nChristopher H. Sterling"
