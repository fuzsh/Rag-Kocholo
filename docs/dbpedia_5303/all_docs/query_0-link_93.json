Gerry was born and raised in a tiny town in the south, Columbia, Mississippi. \"I was raised with southern values and enjoyed the opportunities available in small town America. I spent my time swimming, hunting, fishing and riding horses. From an early age I was in love with horses and began working at a horse ranch when I was 12. I even rode in some rodeos for two years (bareback bronco and calf roping) before selling my horses and beginning college. I attended Mississippi College, majoring in English and Speech as a part of Pre Law. I also attended classes at Jackson School of Law. It was during this time that I first became interested in radio. Mississippi College offered a radio course that I took as an easy way to earn credits, but the class hooked me on radio. My first real job in radio was at WRBC in Jackson. I later worked at WWUN and WJDX while continuing my education. At the same time I was working my way through college, I formed Mid South Talent Associates and began booking bands across the south. My partner and I showcased The Animals, Jimi Hendrix, The Who and other acts in venues from Ft. Worth to New Orleans to Jackson to Miami. It was while I was in Miami cutting commercials for The Who show where I caught the attention of the program director of WFUN who offered me a job.

I had been through [count 'em] 4, yes FOUR, marriages and I decided I didn't want to do this anymore. I actually sought counseling. It was probably the fourth or fifth session when my counselor asked me ‘what kind of woman do you want in your life?’ I thought for about a millisecond and blurted out the usual guy thing, ‘good looking, loves sex, easy to get along with....’ and then that was about all I could come up with. The therapist asked me to go home and start making a list of all the positive aspect of my ideal woman and maybe even more important, what I didn't want and couldn't tolerate. After a couple of weeks, I had three typed pages and a growing realization that I hadn't ever given it much thought. I brought the list back to her but I didn't need her approval. I finally had a clear picture of who I wanted in my life. About two weeks later, it was as if God opened a door. I did something I thought I'd never do. I logged onto an online dating service. Within a week I was conversing with a sweet lady from Bogota, Colombia named Martica. She was educated, world traveled and funny. She almost signed off when I told her I had been married four times. I told her about my ‘list’ that my counselor had me write. Martica said, ‘Send it to me.’ I didn't intend it as a test but she scored herself on it anyway and came up with a 98% agree rate. Less than two months later, I flew to Colombia. I fell in love with her and her family. She flew to Michigan for two weeks to meet my family and friends. I was in love. We were married in October 2001. Now I want to live forever just so we can be together forever.\n\nCampbell, Wendell: KGBS, 1965. Wendell is deceased.\n\nCampos, Raul: KCRW, 1999-2023.

From his menagerie of influences, Raul dreamed of becoming a radio broadcaster. His youthful affection for music began with the 8-track and vinyl collection of his Mexican parents and six older siblings. Their musical influences ran the gamut of genres and styles. Before even developing the ability to speak, Raul would regularly babble tunes from the radio using his own made up words. By age eight, Raul was avidly playing the likes of the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Donna Summer and the Beatles, sprinkled with the rancheras, cumbias and mariachi music of his parents. His assorted collection expanded as tapes became the format of choice and Raul began to experiment with cutting and \"mixing\" tapes on a boombox. At the age of 14, he finally put the needle to the record and stepped behind the decks as a dj. Specializing in house parties, college mayhem, nightclubs and underground events, Raul quickly developed a reputation across Los Angeles. Laying his urban planning career aside, Raul followed his dream into the world of radio. He established a residency on Power 106FM's longest running after hours mix show Power Tools, along with Richard Vission and Swedish Egil, cutting his teeth banging out mega-mixes. But it was in a basement in Santa Monica that Raul would find a home for his motley musical influences at public radio station KCRW.

His podcast boasts 350,000 downloads daily. Adam appeared on the 2012 edition of Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nHe was the subject of a front-page story from Los Angeles magazine titled: “Inside the Brain of Radio Bad Boy.” Some of the highlights from the Steve Oney article: The Adam Carolla Show is built around its namesake’s unscripted rants, and there can be no distractions. No one does it as well as Carolla. He attended North Hollywood High, is an equal opportunity offender. The ability to shuttle between the topical and the personal, the exasperated and the inspired, gives Carolla’s rants unexpected depth. Every day something thoughtful, pointed, or moving comes out of his mouth.\n\nJimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla are so close, says a friend, that if they were gay, they’d be life partners. Carolla wants to make listeners laugh, think, and do the right thing. Not only this, he’s a blue-collar guy who’s as interested in psychology and highbrow debate as in power tools and strippers, as comfortable in the studio as on the site.\n\n\"I’m pompous in that I don’t think there’s anyone on the planet funnier than me. But then my next thought is always the same: Who cares?” Remodeling homes is Carolla’s obsession – he’s done five in the past several years. In 1994, Carolla was 29 and earning $15 an hour as a carpenter. He installed baseboards, built home entertainment units, and put up exterior siding. The son of divorced parents, who, as he puts it, disliked each other so much they ‘practically needed mutual restraining orders,’ as he was raised without much nurturing or structure. Carolla attended L.A. Community, an experimental school in Silver Lake that featured grade-free classes. For five years he did little more than make pottery and build forts. When he entered Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood, he could barely read or write, for which he blames his parents.\n\nCarolla is most comfortable around men and tools, for it is in such company that he pieced together his life, once a neighborhood eyesore. He builds, therefore he is. At North Hollywood High, Carolla oscillated between flashes of football glory and high jinks. As a star guard and linebacker, he won a spot on the 1982 All Central Valley first team. But what he remembers most about the games is that his parents weren’t in the stands.\n\nApproaching 30, Carolla was dating a stripper and sharing an apartment with five guys on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. By day he worked as a carpenter, while on mornings and weekends he taught boxing at the Pasadena branch of Bodies in Motion. The program is an audio midway that over the course of a week presents segments that are by turns salacious, juvenile, comedic, brainy, and subversive – sometimes all at once. Most of Carolla’s interactions are with Danny Bonaduce and Teresa Strasser, for whom he functions as a tough-love-dispensing counselor, alternately haranguing them for their foibles and advising them on how to change their behavior. In a career that saw Danny Bonaduce go from the cover of TV Guide to living in his car, he has been stabbed twice, shot by a girlfriend, arrested in Phoenix for beating up a transvestite prostitute and has battled cocaine addiction and alcoholism. Strasser is a former host of the Learning Channel’s While You Were Out. She earned an Emmy as a writer on Comedy Central’s Win Ben Stein’s Money.\n\nCARPENTER, Craig: KEZY, 1977-81; KROQ, 1981-82; KNX/fm, 1983; KKHR, 1983-86; KMET, 1986; KEZY, 1987-88; KXMX, 1999-2000; KLAA, 2008. Craig hosts Friday Lunch Box Radio Show on 101.5FM KOCI/Newport Beach.\n\n“After 25 years as an on-air at 12 stations, production director at five stations and program director of three stations here in Southern California, I chose to learn the sales side of the business from the ground up to give me the abilities and experience to be a much more effective general manager or station owner one day,” emailed Craig. “It’s amazing to work in an industry your whole life long, and not really know how half of it works! My programming experience has helped me market and sell my stations from a much broader perspective. My sales experience has helped me learn what I could have done to be a more effective pd and how I could have helped create even more opportunities to help my stations earn lots more traditional and NTR dollars.\n\n“I think there are hundreds of stations across the country that are ratings challenged and/or leaving lots of money on the table because their sales and programming teams don’t understand or share the same visions to create a success path for both ratings and revenue. As a general manager, one of the first things I would instigate would be a cross training seminar for sales, marketing and programming management. These once or twice a year, weekend long events would allow each team member a chance to learn how and why the other jobs really function as they do on a day to day basis. Once they understand and appreciate the current successes and challenges of each department and position, the management team as a whole will be able to more effectively redesign the departments or job functions within those departments to work more cohesively together. Once they do that, they’ll be able to effectively realign their success path for both ratings and revenue.”\n\nCarpenter, Scott: KLAC, 1984-87.

Carole began her Los Angeles radio career in 1977 after working as news anchor and eventually news director at WESL- East St. Louis and KXLW, KADI and KKSS in St. Louis.\n\nCarole came to KGFJ as Don Mac was changing the call letters to KKTT. Inner City Broadcasting bought the KKTT/KUTE franchise and named her news director at KUTE making her the first Black female news director in Los Angeles. She eventually worked at KDAY.\n\nCarole wrote the \"West Coast Scene\" column for Black Radio Exclusive for several years. Jerry Boulding brought her to Urban Network where she would spend the next 21 years as a writer, vice president and business office manager for the Urban Network PowerJam music conferences.\n\nCarr, Firpo: KTLK, 2005. The spiritual advisor to Michael Jackson started a weekend talk show at Progressive \"K-TALK\" in the late spring 2005.\n\nCARROLL, Larry: KJLH, 1970-71; KIIS, 1971-72; XPRS, 1972; KFWB, 2001-08. Larry worked as an anchor at all-News KFWB until the fall of 2008 when the company went through downsizing.\n\nThe longtime television newsman from KABC/Channel 7 and KCAL/Channel 9 got his start at KJLH as news editor in June 1970. Larry grew up in Chicago and came to California to attend Pomona College in Claremont and be pd of the campus station in the late 1960s. He graduated from Pomona College with a B.A. in economics. At KIIS he worked evenings and was assistant nd at XPRS. In the spring of 1972 Larry worked at The White House as the California director of broadcast relations for President Richard Nixon and served there until a few days after Watergate.\n\nIn the same year a number of jobs overlapped; he worked as assistant nd at XPRS, was the West Coast bureau chief of Mutual Black Network and started at Channel 7 on October 30, 1972, and stayed 17 years with the station. By the end of 1972, he was devoting full-time to tv. In 1989, Larry became the principal anchor for Channel 9's Prime Nine News, Weekend Edition, which included anchoring the station's prime-time coverage for the duration of the Persian Gulf War. In 1993 he was a correspondent for NBC's Nightly News with Tom Brokaw and a regular contributor to the Today show. He has won numerous awards including two 1992 Golden Mike awards. In 1996 he won an Emmy as anchor of the best daytime 30-minute newscast. He's now a media relations consultant.\n\nIn 1983, when KROQ's ratings dipped while KIIS began its strong ascent, the LA Times asked, \"Has the fabled 'Rock of the '80s' already bitten the dust?\" When he started, KROQ was the only station playing \"New Wave\" music. When Rick instituted some structure to the format and music selection, the jocks picketed and advertisers pulled out, resulting in a compromise. He described the new rock listener: \"A KROQ listener may be carrying a skateboard or a briefcase.\"\n\nRick was plagued by a troubled personal life. He made two attempts at rehabilitation for a drug problem. Rick died on July 10, 1989, of complications of pneumonia at the age of 42. KROQ personality Richard Blade gave this on-air testimonial: \"I've lost a friend. In fact, everyone lost a friend who loves music. You might not have known his name, but you surely felt his influence.\" In R&R's 1993 special edition of \"Twenty Years of Excellence,\" Rick was cited as a \"pioneer.\" Rick's contribution was noted thusly, \"His balance of carefully researched music and anarchic on-air attitude has built a heritage any station would envy.\"\n\nCARROLL, Roger: KABC, 1946-59; KMPC 1959-79. Roger, a versatile personality for decades on the L.A. airwaves, died July 30 2019, at the age of 90. “His passing was peaceful, and he was surrounded by family,” wrote his son.\n\nBorn Kolman C. Rutkin III in 1930, he grew up half-way between Baltimore and Washington, DC. Roger never another thought but to pursue a career in radio. His older brother was an announcer at WCAO-Baltimore and at the CBS network in New York. Roger’s brother never returned from World War II, so Roger became the announcer in the family.\n\nHis first radio job was WFMD-Frederick, Maryland at the age of 15. At 18, he was the youngest staff announcer in the history of the ABC network. During his two decades at KMPC, he was also the tv announcer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, plus for shows hosted by Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Tony Orlando and Dawn, Redd Foxx and Pearl Bailey. He was the announcer on NBC's Bobby Darin Show and the nationally syndicated Mancini Generation, as well as hundreds of commercials.\n\nInterestingly, for all his voiceover success, he never made an audition tape. Roger was one of two announcers represented by William Morris, and he attributes much of his work to the agency. “I believe you get assignments because of relationships, but you have to be very good at what you do.” Roger offered some real creativity on the air.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Roger ran a nightly five-minute feature called “The Golden Days of Radio,” which he considered “one of the most successful segments I’ve ever featured.” He loved to broadcast from unusual venues. In a promotion co-sponsored by United Airlines, Roger’s show was broadcast live from a 747 en route to Hawaii. Long before the accessibility of satellite transmission, KMPC leased transmitter equipment from NBC to beam the radio signal from the airplane off a satellite stationed in the Pacific. On arrival in Honolulu, he broadcast four one-hour shows live from the beach at Waikiki evenings preceding KMPC’s coverage of Angels baseball.\n\nIn 1979, Roger moved to evening talk, as KMPC moved out of its MOR/full-service status. When the station changed formats in 1980, Roger became head of Golden West Syndication Features, a new wing for Gene Autry’s company. In 1981, he resigned from Golden West to become executive producer of the “Lawrence Welk Radio Show” and owner of KWIP-Salem, Oregon, which he sold in 1991.\n\nRoger claims the enormous success of KMPC was a direct result of “management of attitude. The station manager treated us like professionals and we, in turn, performed like professionals.” “My 22 years at KMPC were the best years of my career and ending my time at Golden West Broadcasters / KMPC as a Vice President of GWB,” Roger said.\n\nCARROLL, Tom: KPPC, 1964-65. Tom was a radio personality, TV-film actor and commercial spokesman. He, died March 18, 2001, at the age of of natural causes in Hollywood. He was 69.

While in Hawaii, Carroll narrated NBC’s radio series “Monitor” and the as well as for the Armed Forces Radio Service and emceed 64 segments of the nationally syndicated Aloha Game TV Show. In San Francisco, while playing Bozo the Clown on his daily KEMO TV show, Carroll endured the wrath of a lad who, on live television, told the clown to “cram it” and made an obscene gesture with his middle finger. Local and national newspapers picked up the story, and Carroll entered broadcast history.

In the 1970s he worked on national programming with Robert W. Morgan (“Record Report”) and Steve Lundy (“Hitbound from Billboard”) among others.\n\nIn 1982 he was the voice of The Best of the Midnight Special and narrated a series of “Spotlight Specials” for the ABC Radio Network. For over 15 years, Mike produced a daily 90-second feature called \"Something You Should Know,\" a short form radio feature, syndicated to hundreds of radio stations around the U.S and Canada. After more than 8,000 episodes of the feature, Mike co-founded Omnicast Media with Ken Williams, a veteran Network Radio executive and co-founder of Dial Global, to create and launch the \"Something You Should Know\" podcast.\n\nBorn in Columbus, Ohio, he grew up in Connecticut where he started his radio career at WJZZ-Bridgeport. Mike is a graduate of the USC Journalism School. While in college Mike began his L.A. radio career at KPSA. When the station became KLVE and changed format to Spanish, Mike was the last English announcer on the station. “That night we all left the station, out of work and headed to a Mexican restaurant where we hoisted a few margaritas!” He became president of Strand Media Group.\n\nCARSON, Corbin: KFI, 2018-23.

He got started at KNAK-Salt Lake City. Johnny's response to a request to track his career for Los Angeles Radio People resulted in a three-page letter. The following excerpts reflect on some of his stops: \"1967: Ogden 1st Phone was the only thing I ever did that amounted to anything. 1967, KSTN: first crack at mornings. 1969, KEZY: Replaced, or more correctly, succeeded Emperor Hudson for a month. Too young! 1969, KYNO: My call to the Big Time. Named 'Big John Carter' over the phone by programming genius Bill Watson.\n\n1970-71, KGB: Charlie Van Dyke hired me and was the reason I got the big jobs. If it weren't for him, no one would have ever heard of me. I quit unceremoniously when some of my friends got fired. My heroism got me nothing but a lot of bad press. 1972, KCBQ: Jack McCoy was talked into hiring me by some well-intentioned but foolish friends. I screwed up mornings for a couple of months. Jack was always nice to me. I can't imagine what I was thinking.\n\n1972, KFIG: My one and only turn at bat at FM “underground.” Lasted a month. 1973, KCPX-SLC: It was the one and only time I got a woman in trouble. Some sort of chastity record for a dj. 1974, KPOI: Hired to do mornings as Maxx Mahimahi, and I victimized the Islands with the notorious election day gag of 1974. I got fired for my trouble. 1975, KHJ: Charlie hired me again. After some months I began to feel extremely unwelcome and bailed. 1976, Eugene: I thought I'd try the small time, and I hated it. I hung around a few months and managed to meet the woman I married, a wonderful gal who nearly killed me a few years later. If she calls, I'm not in. 1976, KEZY: No boss was ever more of a radio person than Rick Carroll, God bless him. 1984 to 1986, KHJ \"CAR RADIO.\" It was like going to a funeral every day.\" 1986-present: I'm on the beach.

After KROQ I worked at KMXN-Anaheim and KFSD-San Diego (with Jeremy Pritchard).\n\n\"When those stations were sold, I returned to the midwest to work at FM 102/1. After a few years in Milwaukee and the brutal winters, I remembered why I had left the midwest in the first place, and returned to Southern California. Found Jeremy at FM 94/9, and moved to San Diego in 2012 to do weekends/fill-in and promo at the station. After several months of doing that, I was SUPER lucky to get the night shift at my beloved FM 94/9, and life is GOOD!\"\n\nHow did she become interested in radio? \"I was a music junkie at a young age, which took me to the natural progression of doing college radio. From that moment on, I was HOOKED. I've been privileged to be able to make a career out of following my passion,\" Christy told AllAccess.\n\nCarter, John: KMPC, KYSR; KCBS; KLIT, 1989-94.

KPPC/fm 106.7 in Pasadena only broadcast all day Sundays and on Wednesday evenings, sometimes broadcasting church services and sometimes as an fm simulcast. KPPC was the first FM ROCK radio station in Southern California beginning in November of 1967 (at midnight on Halloween with KBCA jazz deejay Les Carter moonlighting as \"Sleepy Gross\"). The stations' broadcast studios were in the basement of the Pasadena Presbyterian Church (the PPC in the call letters). It was known as \"Underground Radio\" (in spirit as well as in location).\n\nBy April 1970, KPPC/fm had moved into new broadcast studios at 99 South Chester Avenue near futuristic Cal Tech with a state-of-the-art sound board custom designed by creative engineers Matt Rubin and Mike Callaghan. On April Fools Day 1970, Les began the eighteen amazing months of KPPC consciousness that would come to a sudden end \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" on October 24, 1971.\n\nLes, as pd, brought many amazing personalities to the airwaves at KPPC during 1970 and 1971 including: The Obscene Steven Clean (Steven Segal, nasty hip riffer); Dr. Demento (Barry Hansen, naughty roots musicologist); \"The Incredible\" Credibility Gap satirical news team extraordinaire featuring Richard Beebe (news voice extraordinaire), David L.

He left the station to have back surgery with the understanding he could return, but the back surgery was only partially successful, so he is in semi-retirement. “Though there are sometimes days when I miss radio, I realize that what I miss is what radio was, not what it is. One day I hope that it will again be on the upswing, but right now, with consolidation, it seems that the non-broadcast managers are content just to achieve a level of competitive mediocrity. There are still exceptions, yes, but they're getting harder and harder to find!” wrote Hulston.\n\n“I had over 30 years involved in radio and much of it was a lot of fun. I don't think that the radio I enjoyed exists much anymore – I know I listen a lot less. But, just when I think it's behind me, someone asked me to do some casual consultant work, based on what I've done and what I remember.\n\nCARUSO, Maryann: KLSX, 1997-98.

Dwight taught us his folder system for managing salespeople: He wanted them to keep a folder for each client, and asked the sellers to open every folder every day. When I attempted to modernize the system, he showed me why that wasn’t a good idea. We went into a sales meeting, and the sellers had all brought in every folder they had. He asked one of the sellers, “Did you look at every account? Look in every folder?” When she said yes, he opened a folder and pulled out a $100 bill he had planted earlier. “You would have gotten to keep this if you had been looking, but since you didn’t look, it’s mine again.”\n\n“Dwight Case was a true leader and visionary of the radio industry,” wrote Erica Farber, ceo of RAB, in Radio Ink.\n\nCASEY, Steve: KHJ, 1977-79.

He spent 10 years with Westinghouse, working later at WIND-Chicago, then going to KFWB in January 1968 when it was still a music station.\n\nIn August 1971, Paul went to KHJ, where he was named manager just after two weeks at the iconic station. “My best memory of LA Radio, was 1971 when Don Imus and Robert W. Morgan were cavorting with the Billy Sol Hargus Act live in the KHJ studio. Reverend Billy was healing the hole in the records that Robert was playing! I called Robert to tell him that the FCC was on the way to the station and to get back to reality. Guess what, he did! Then came upstairs to ask, ‘are they really?’”\n\nThe RKO position lasted about a year, then Paul joined KLOS in sales before being moved to ABC sister station, KSFX-San Francisco. In October 1974 he moved back to L.A. to run KGBS AM & FM. In 1976, station owner Storer Broadcasting switched their AM property to rock ‘n roll, while KGBS/fm became “Gentle Country.” Paul became titular head of both operations. He was named vp in 1977. Paul was active in making KGBS/AM a 50,000 watt 24 hour operation rather than just a daytimer.\n\nThe New Ten-Q was positioned to challenge long-time Top 40 leader KHJ, Paul calling it a “street fight” between the two stations. He was let go shortly before the station was sold to the Liberman Brothers in 1979. His last radio job in the Southland was as gm at KWST.\n\nWhen he left radio he spent 19 years in television!

He took the station from 12th to 1st in less than a year. He commented on his time in Utah: \"It’s hard to find a colder, crueler world than the radio business. And local talk radio—in an industry that has all but killed the format in favor of cheaper, syndicated programming—can be the chilliest place of all. I don’t know how they make these decisions. I’m just the meat in the seat. But the math doesn’t add up as far as budgets go. We’re in the middle of a ratings book. We’re the No. 1 show in [the 7 p.m. to midnight] time slot in this market. I don’t know what you say to someone—‘Sorry, next time we’ll try to be No. 2 or 3?’ In this industry, they call it ‘pushback. It’s when someone hears something they don’t like and complains, but you never know exactly who or what set it all in motion. There were times I wondered when someone in ‘pushback land’ was going to drive into a wall, make a phone call and then it will all be over.”\n\nCastro, Daniel: KPCC, 1984-2000.

A combination of all those sources made such an impression on the producers of Live With Regis & Kelly that Psycho Mike has been selected as one of five fill-ins for Regis Philbin this week while he is on vacation.\n\nThe co-host of Loveline with Dr. Drew Pinsky is an integral part of the Kevin & Bean show. Adding to the silliness of replacing Regis on tv, Kevin & Bean offered Mike $1,000 if he farts on the national show and it can be heard. “I was informed by the producer of Regis and Kelly, who let me know I was in the top ten,” said Mike. That’s when all of Mike’s sources including his social networking sites were called into action to vote for him.\n\nIn 2010, Mike was named as co-host at Loveline. At the time he said, \"I can't properly describe how honored I am. I'm a local guy who grew up listening to Kevin & Bean and Loveline, so to be a part of both shows is downright surreal. Dr. Drew is what makes Loveline special, so I'm going to do my best to add something positive to the show without getting in his way.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Psycho Mike has an eclectic background from the city that made him the person he is today. Michael's a mixed race Hispanic who immersed himself in the LA punk and hard rock scene as early as he could remember. He then moved to the East Coast to study Theatre at Rutgers University.

For a while I was Wolfman Jack’s sidekick on the Graffiti Gold show. I was also one of the jocks on WNBC’s legendary recreation of WABC’s sound in the ‘60s known as the ‘Time Machine.’”\n\nMemories from Westwood One: Working in Hollywood during Rodney King with armored vehicles patrolling Sunset Blvd. and not being able to reveal on the network we were in LA in the middle of it so as to not destroy the notion we weren't in affiliates local towns. Also, getting locked in the studio and having to have the LA Sheriff and Fire department use the 'jaws of life' to bend open the metal studio door to let me out!\" said Lee.\n\nChampagne, Robert: KEZY/KXMX, 1999-2000.

In fact, before American Graffiti and Star Wars the handyman at Jon’s school was Harrison Ford.\n\nWhile in school he started listening to police and fire scanners. Jon found listening to scanners exciting, because this was real life drama and not make believe. He attended Cal Lutheran College on a pre-med scholarship. While in his first year of college, an art history professor noticed that Jon was an extrovert in front of a crowd, but an introvert in one-on-one situations. The professor told Jon he should be an entertainer and not a doctor and because of his deep voice got him a gig on the college radio station. The next year Jon transferred to Los Angeles Valley College and graduated with a degree in radio and television broadcasting. Also while at Valley College he won an award for Outstanding Excellence In Broadcasting from the State Of California and graduated with scholastic honors.\n\nFrom there it was on to various radio stations working as a disc jockey and news reporter throughout the Antelope Valley, Ventura County and Palm Springs areas, before ending up in Los Angeles.

Chandler was rushed to a Denver hospital where doctors saved his life. Chandler made a miraculous recovery and returned to the field later in the season.\n\nAter his football career, Bob was an Oakland Raider radio commentator.\n\nBob died on January 27, 1995, after a four-month battle with cancer.

The mountains of Santa Rosa are a world apart from the glitz, glamour and neon of Hollywood. For David , he chose the refuge of familiar territory. Born in Australia, he grew up in the Monterey/Salinas area.\n\n“I loved the mountains and as a kid would split my time between Big Sur and Lake Tahoe.” In the late 1970s, David was visiting his recording engineer brother in Los Angeles and ended up doing the all-night show at KMET. It is impossible to talk to David about his Southern California radio experiences without hearing about B. Mitch Reed. David referred to his B.M.R. relationship in almost reverent terms. \"The time was far more important than I realized at the time. It was larger than life.\" He talked about the volume of mail with photos and drugs that would arrive daily for all of the jocks. After leaving Southern California radio, he hooked up with the \"most amazing thing in my life.\" In 1984, David became a jock on the Pirate ship Laser558.

Ken started as program director at all-News KNX in July 2016.\n\nHe joined the CBS/LA cluster from a lengthy journey with iHeartMedia (Clear Channel), most recently in Ft. Lauderdale. Ken stepped down from KNX in July 2022. He's now with WSB/WSBB-Atlanta as program director.\n\nKen had his challenges during his 7-year run. How will KNX broaden the demographics and attract the younger listener? When a current listener dies, there isn’t a younger one to replace him. “The young people don’t trust anyone over 27,” said Ken. “I get it. They’ve been bombarded with so much stuff their entire lives that it’s hard to know who to trust and who to believe in. Just look at the news. When guys like Dennis Hastert was positioned as ‘the most moral and the most this’ and now look what he’s been accused of who do you trust? It’s a different time, that’s for sure.”\n\nKen believes that stations like KNX have real futures beyond just radio, whatever that delivery system is. “We just have to figure out the secret sauce and make sure we deliver it. We can’t blow off the existing audience. You can’t destroy the station’s heritage and what it is but we’ve got to bring it into a position to attract new people to grow and be successful.”\n\nHis philosophy: “When you look at what news was in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, we thought, as news people, that our judgment was right and we knew what to tell the audience. We believed that we knew better than them and that the stories we thought were important would also be important to the audience. It’s not about us anymore. It’s about them. And we have to provide them with stories that they think are relevant. We have to stop thinking like news people and start thinking like normal people. We need to present stories that are relevant to everyone. I believe this will make the station grow.”\n\nChase: KLYY, 1997-99. Chase was working at \"Y107\" until early 1999.\n\nChase, Eric: KIQQ, 1974-75; KHJ, 1975; KFI, 1975-81; KRTH, 2003. Eric briefly worked swing at \"K-Earth\" during the summer of 2003.

Born in Minnesota, Chase moved to California to attend UCLA. She majored in English and then worked in politics and state government before getting a broadcasting job at KNX.\n\nShe joined the staff of CBS News in New York in 1971 and moved to ABC a few years later. She received a range of broadcasting rewards and was dubbed “the most trusted woman on TV” by TV Guide. During her time at 20/20, a survey by the magazine also pegged Chase as the top investigative reporter on any of the national newsmagazines.\n\nChase moved to San Francisco’s NBC station to be a local anchor. KRON touted her arrival with the slogan “The Chase Is On.” Her decision to move to the Bay Area came just two months after ABC killed an investigative segment she did on the links between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedy family. Chase at the time brushed aside suggestions that the two incidents were related, but later wrote that the decision by ABC was a factor in her departure. Whatever the cause, Chase became one of the Bay Area’s most visible news personalities of the late 1980s — not only anchoring newscasts but hosting prime-time news documentaries each year.\n\nChase returned to ABC News at the end of 1990. “I hate to leave the Bay Area, but if I’m going to get mugged it might as well be in New York,” Chase quipped to Chronicle columnist Herb Caen. She remained at ABC until 2001, then retired and purchased a home in Marin County. One of her colleagues remarked: “She belonged everywhere.” Sylvia died January 3, 2019, at the age of 80.\n\nChastain, Jane: KBRT; KLTX, 1999-2000.
