        "text": "Welcome to the second annual Barrett News Media Top 20 series recognizing News/Talk radio’s best for 2023. This series is voted on by news/talk radio program directors and executives all across the country. To stay informed on each day’s results please bookmark our website, follow BNM on Twitter at @BNMStaff, visit us on Facebook at Barrett News Media or sign up for our daily newsletter, ‘The Rundown‘ by clicking here. We appreciate the support.\n\nThe six categories featured this year are news/talk radio’s Major and Mid market morning, midday, and afternoon shows, the top program directors and radio stations, and the format’s best national talk shows. Major Markets represent shows, stations, and PDs operating in markets #1-#20. Mid Markets are for markets #21 and below. Not included in our lists are NPR brands and shows. Maybe in the future we’ll change that or add an extra category but for now, mainstream talk radio outlets are our main focus.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs you review the results in this category, please remember that they represent the collective opinions of fifty four (54) news/talk radio programmers and executives. We try our best to make sure the top shows, hosts, programmers and brands are listed for voting consideration. Industry decision makers are then asked to vote on market categories based on where their stations/shows operate. We don’t participate ourselves in the voting process, we simply add up and present the results.\n\nI want to thank Barrett Media’s Digital Director Alex Reynolds for doing an awesome job on this year’s graphics, as well as each PD and executive who participated in this process. We had representation from fourteen companies and forty different cities, which was even better than last year. For those who didn’t vote and were invited to do so, I hope you’ll change your mind next year. It’s good for the format if you’re involved, and depending on the final votes, it can benefit your staff, sales team, and company, and excite your audience and advertisers.\n\nMoving on to the voting, here are a few things I’d like you to be aware of.\n\n#1 – Our executive voters are asked to rank their Top 20 selections for each category based on a few key factors; quality of show (ear test), originality, ability to entertain-inform-connect across multiple platforms, ratings success, clearance (national shows) and industry buzz. Remember, our voters live in different cities, have different tastes, work for different groups, and value certain factors higher than others. This is not a perfect system but it’s the best one we’ve come up with to showcase the industry’s best. Having run it for eight years with the sports talk format, we’re going to stick with it until another option arises that makes it better.\n\n#2 – The executive panel consists of program directors and corporate executives from a number of top broadcasting companies including Audacy, iHeart, Cumulus, Hubbard, Cox Media Group, Townsquare Media, Salem Media Group, Radio One, Alpha, Bonneville, FOX News Radio, Westwood One, Federated Media, and Zimmer Communications. We involve a large number of people in this process in order to receive feedback from all parts of the country, and to avoid the results heavily favoring one company. Given the variety of people in this process, it means there’s no guarantee that success last year will be duplicated this year.\n\n#3 – A total of 98 mid market morning shows were eligible for votes from our executive panel in the Mid Market Morning News/Talk Shows category. These programs are counted on across the nation to create compelling local content, and produce strong ratings and revenue for their respective brands. Many of these shows enjoy great success in their local cities, but only one can stand atop the rankings.\n\nWhich brings us to this year’s winner. The top honor once again goes to Mike McConnell of 700 WLW. The popular Cincinnati morning host pulled off the repeat thanks to a category best six (6) 1st place votes. BNM congratulates Mike, Scott Reinhart, and the entire WLW team on grabbing the top spot again, as well as every other show which gained a spot on this year’s list.\n\nNow, here are the full results of “Barrett News Media’s Top 20 Mid Market News/Talk Morning Shows of 2023!”\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nMike McConnell finished comfortably in front of WTAM’s Wills & Snyder with a 133 point lead, courtesy of a category best six (6) first place votes.\n\nSpots 21-25 belonged to A New Morning with Susan & Brian, Utah’s Morning News, Bo Thompson & Beth Troutman, C4 & Bryan Nehman and Kevin Miller In The Morning.\n\nThe closest contests saw Total Information AM nip Ben Ferguson by 3 points, and Pete Mundo edge Dan Mandis by 4 points.\n\nOf the 98 shows to appear on submitted ballots, seventeen (17) received at least one 1st place vote.\n\n*** Boxer has since left mornings in Columbus, replaced by Mike Elliott. His show was on 610 WTVN in morning drive when voting took place.\n\nHere is the remaining schedule for the BNM Top 20 of 2023."
