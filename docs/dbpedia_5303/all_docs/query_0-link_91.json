Initially created as the radio extension of the Cincinnati College of Music, this program became the first collegiate broadcasting department in the country. During its first year, the College produced 51 half-hour broadcasts on WLW and WSAI, a 15-minute program for NBC, 30 half-hour broadcasts of \"Music of the Masters\" and 10 half-hour \"Odeon Radio Workshops\" for WSAI.\n\nIn 1955, the Cincinnati College of Music merged with the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and brought the Radio-Television arts department into the newly formed College-Conservatory of Music (CCM). The department was renamed the Electronic Media Division in the late 1980's, and in 1999 it moved into its current facilities in the state-of-the-art CCM Village complex for the performing and media arts. The department was renamed the Division of Media Production in 2021.\n\nThe program and its thousands of distinguished alumni are still making history through the country and around the world. The current Media Production program offers a BFA in Film and Television Production, Broadcast Media Production and Multimedia Production, as well as a minor in Media Production. The program emphasizes creative multi-platform storytelling and allows students to gain production expertise in filmmaking and digital cinema, episodic and commercial television production, broadcast news media and talent development, interactive and new media, social media, audio and video production and sports media."
