Update 3/28: March Format Madness has declared a winner.

Following the Reds season opening game on Monday, 94.5 will become “Cincy Rock 94.5” programmed by Florence, KY’s Josh Fields for the entire month of April. The microformat will feature local artists and “undiscovered music” interrupted only for simulcasts of WLW’s Reds broadcasts.

On May 1, the translator will revert to a 24/7 simulcast of 700 WLW.

Original Report 3/11: Clear Channel Cincinnati has launched a cluster-wide promotion to help launch its newest translator in Cincinnati.

94.5 W233BG Port Union, OH signed on in January as a simulcast of News/Talk 700 WLW following Clear Channel’s purchase of the translator for $40,000 from Northern Kentucky University and moving it to downtown Cincinnati. It is currently licensed to operate with 99 watts rebroadcasting 107.1 WKFS-HD2.

Now WLW and all of its Clear Channel Cincinnati brethren are promoting “The Final Format“. The contest promises the ability to allow a listener to program the translator for the entire month of April.
