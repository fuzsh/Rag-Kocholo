As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past.

BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch hasn’t seen his brothers since. But when Branch’s bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of nefarious pop-star villains — Velvet (Schumer) and Veneer (Rannells) — Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the other brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity.\n\nPlot\n\nCast\n\nMain Characters\n\nAnna Kendrick as Queen Poppy\n\nJustin Timberlake as Branch\n\nIris Dohrn as Baby Branch\n\nKenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond\n\nEric André as John Dory\n\nDaveed Diggs as Spruce\n\nTroye Sivan as Floyd\n\nKid Cudi as Clay\n\nCamila Cabello as Viva\n\nAmy Schumer as Velvet\n\nBrianna Mazzola as Velvet's singing voice\n\nAndrew Rannells as Veneer\n\nZosia Mamet as Crimp\n\nZooey Deschanel as Bridget\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse as King Gristle Jr.\n\nTiny Diamond was seen in the late 2022 promotions and had his Trademark updated on Jan 31st, 2023.[19]\n\nMinor Characters\n\nAino Jawo as Satin\n\nCaroline Hjelt as Chenille\n\nAnderson .Paak as Prince Darnell\n\nRon Funches as Cooper\n\nKunal Nayyar as Guy Diamond\n\nDavid Fynn as Biggie\n\nKevin Michael Richardson as Mr. Dinkles\n\nRuPaul Charles as Miss Maxine\n\nPatti Harrison as Brandy\n\nDillon Francis as Kid Ritz\n\nWalt Dohrn as King Peppy and Cloud Guy\n\nGloZell Green as Grandma Rosiepuff\n\nKismet:\n\nLance Bass as Boom\n\nJC Chasez as Hype\n\nJoey Fatone as Ablaze\n\nChris Kirkpatrick as Trickee\n\nAdditional Voices\n\nNina Bakshi as BroZone Fangirl\n\nMelissa Mabie as Aunt Smead\n\nWalt Dohrn as The Interdimensional Hustle Traveler\n\nJames Ryan as Mount Rageous Stage Manager\n\nTim Heitz as Lone Pooper\n\nRyan Naylor as Radio Announcer\n\nNick Fletcher as Concert Announcer\n\nSecunda C.

At the same time, it was announced that a third Trolls film would be released in theaters on November 17, 2023.[25][26] Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake are confirmed to reprise their voice roles as Poppy and Branch, respectively.\n\nWhen asked if they would get a trailer for Trolls 3 in December 2021, Tim Heitz claimed that the movie is still too early in the process for a trailer.[27]\n\n2022\n\nWhen speaking of Trolls: TrollsTopia, Matthew Beans noted that movie characters come with restrictions in related 2D-animated media of the Trolls franchise, and in comment mentioned that he had no idea about what they planned to do with the new characters from Trolls World Tour, only claiming that they're being handled by the movies' crew.[28]\n\nIn July 2022, the Supervising Animator Kevan Shorey stated that they had no idea when the first trailer would come out.[29]\n\nCollin Jack has mentioned that he's the head of story for the movie.[30]\n\nIn May 2022, the first teaser poster was shown revealing an upcoming female Troll.[7]\n\nWhile replying to a birthday wish request, Kevan Shorey noted that he had just finished a scene involving Poppy and Branch.[31] He later explained that what he meant was the basics of the scene were done, so further members of the movie's production team were now going to be brought in to complete the scene, including fuzz, lighting and effects. He also stated that by then, Poppy and Branch had what was their \"temporary hair\".[32] Furthermore, he confirmed that the audio of the scene was already done, as he couldn't start work without audio recordings.[33] The tweets Kevan posted were removed later.\n\nWhile the new female Troll character was known to exist at this point, her name was still not allowed to be stated.[10]\n\nIn October 2022, the first 8 images of concept art were released, acting as the first look ideas that had been produced for Trolls 3.[34][35] However, the tweets were later removed.\n\nIn mid November 2022, leaks of the logo were released showing the full name as \"Trolls Band Together\".\n\nIn early December at the Brazilian CCXP2022 expo, more promotions for Trolls 3 were since, including the official Logo, some renders of Poppy and Branch, and Tiny Diamond sitting on said logo, confirming the return of the aforementioned characters.\n\nIn late December, a synopsis was posted.[18] Netflix streaming for Illumination and DreamWorks movies was posted, revealing a expected May 2024 release of the Trolls 3 film.[36] As part of Universal's deal with Netflix, the film will stream on Peacock for the first four months which started in March 2024 starting on of the pay-TV window, then will move to Netflix for the next ten starting in July 2024, and then will return to Peacock for the remaining four starting in May 2025.[37][38]\n\nNote from the Trolls Trollpedia wiki staff, in Q4, the name \"Viva\" was leaked and fans began to use this name, however, the origin of this leak is currently unknown. If origin is found, please leave source in \"comments\" or edit onto the page.\n\n2023\n\nIn March 2023, Universal Studios took part in the 'French Licensing Day & Licensing International Awards'. The result was a number of franchises and upcoming films were mentioned to have news dropped on them, with Trolls 3 being mentioned amongthem.[39]\n\nOn March 6, 2023, Theodore Shapiro was confirmed to compose the score for Trolls Band Together, returning from its predecessor.[40]\n\nThe movie's official poster, alongside with first trailer was released in March 28, 2023 on Universal Pictures and Peacock Kids' YouTube channels. The same day of these announcements, DreamWorks Animation revealed the official title, Trolls Band Together. At the same time, new cast members of the film were officially announced, including Eric André, Kid Cudi, Daveed Diggs, Troye Sivan, Camila Cabello, Amy Schumer, Andrew Rannells, RuPaul Charles and Zosia Mamet. Walt Dohrn returned to direct the film after its predecessor, while Gina Shay returned to produce the sequel. Tim Heitz was later announced as co-director.[41]\n\nAccording to Shay, the idea for the film came about right after Trolls. Although Trolls Band Together was predominately CGI animation, the film includes some 2D animation sequences with some animation styles inspired by Yellow Submarine and Fantasia.[42][6] In addition, some additional animation was provided by DNEG, around six animators worked a bit on the film including Nimona animation director Ted Ty.\n\nIn June 2023, a fan reported a copyright claim came up on a video a friend had submitted to YouTube. The copyright claim against the 3rd parties video seems to confirm that the Trolls Band Together movie was complete and had already been submitted to YouTube for copyright claim and checks purposes.[43]\n\nNote from Bureaucrats to readers, this is common see this article to explain why, though there may be other factors not mentioned by this article, such as other projects from the same studio may have been considered a risk to ticket sales. At this time, no further information is available to confirm any details.\n\nOn September 14, 2023, in addition to the release of the second trailer, DreamWorks announced that NSYNC would perform an original song for the film, entitled \"Better Place\", which is set to be released on digital music streaming platforms on September 29, 2023.[44]\n\nTrolls Band Together had its early screenings in select United States theaters on November 4, 2023, and it was theatrically premiered in all United States cinemas on November 17, 2023. The movie was also digitally released in Video-on-Demand (VOD) streaming platforms on December 19, 2023.[45]\n\n2024\n\nOriginally set for January 8, 2024 for Digital HD and January 22, 2024 for Blu-ray, DVD and 4K UHD release respectively,[46] The film was also released in Digital HD, 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on January 16, 2024.[47]\n\nThe theatrical Trolls Band Together film (along with the sing-along version of the film) was available to stream on the streaming service Peacock on March 15, 2024.[48] It will be streamed on Netflix starting on July 15, 2024.[49]\n\nDevelopment\n\nThemes\n\nA main focus as well for the film is \"families\", particular as COVID-19 had impacted families during the last film (Trolls World Tour) and about how Branch and his 4 brothers had an open wound which needed time to heal. The focus is less on other countries like in Trolls World Tour, but continues to open the world of Trolls more and more. Since the focus is more on families this time, the Bergens were brought back after their absence in Trolls World Tour, by highlighting the matrimonial union of King Gristle Jr. and Bridget.\n\nAs for Branch's brothers, they each had to have their own personalities to explore and relationships within their family. Like the first film, Poppy sees the brothers as a challenge to explore and Branch himself has a bigger emotional hurdle to explore as a result which Poppy will help him through.[6]\n\nThe movie is meant to be a emotional rollercoaster for Branch especially, as he expected his brothers to return but they never did, as the same time it was confirmed he was 3 or 4 when they left (though the movie itself contradicts this). In addition, the movie intends to create a family tree.[16] This is reinforced with how Floyd is the glue of BroZone that eventually brings them back together.\n\nIn contrast, abusive and unbalanced family dynamics are brought to light through Velvet and Veneer. By using their unhealthy relationship to contrast with BroZone's, it demonstrates how a toxic family relationship can intoxicate a person's mind, like how Veneer is stripped from making proper life decisions and has become mentally broken, due to Velvet's narcissism, thus his need to remove her from his life. This also brings out the concerns of how the pursuit of fame, such as in the materialistic society of Mount Rageous can turn people into monsters who neglect and mistreat their families.\n\nPoppy meanwhile wanted a sister, believing she didn't have one and was supportive of fixing the issues with Branch and his brothers because she believed it was a unbreakable bond. Then when her wish of having a sister came true and she discovered Viva, it was at first a perfect relationship. But it quickly falls apart when Viva can't let go of her own past and Poppy faced her own family problem. A short time after this, Branch found himself also addressing his brother's behaviors. This shows that families have to work their ways through the obstacles, instead of staying in an imaginary bubble of the perfect family, or blaming others for their imposed problems.\n\nChange is also present as a major theme of this movie. This is firstly presented by BroZone, with John Dory, Bruce and Clay accepting that Branch is now a full-fledged adult, and that John Dory becomes more willing to change his own attitude towards his brothers' choices and also himself by trying to become less egotistical. Viva is also shown to have gone through changes, by accepting that Poppy has grown and that the Bergens have indeed changed for the better. Branch has also changed on how he views his three oldest brothers, now finally understanding their perspectives. Even Veneer has undergone a positive change, by accepting that he is wrong with his actions and that he shouldn't let Velvet change who he is inside; through changing into a responsible person who accepts his own punishment and comes clean with his honest confession, he is able to make peace with the Trolls and himself, and earning Floyd's forgiveness, respect and friendship.\n\nA minor theme is also about the price of fame and that Velvet and Veneer may have fame and fortune, but it comes at the cost of Floyd's life. Veneer even starts to question his own morals, eventually leading to his own revelation about what he is doing is wrong. It also corresponds to how fame and fortune cannot purchase or exchange for healthy, happy relationships, as Velvet has never changed her abhorrently abusive attitude towards Veneer even after becoming famous, and only further hurts him in different ways to fuel her own ego.\n\nSoftware Usage\n\nLike Trolls World Tour, this movie is animated via the MoonRay software.\n\nMuch of its 2D animation is also inspired by Adventure Time and Steven Universe.\n\nCharacter Development\n\nThe only thing noted so far is that the official status of Poppy and Branch's relationship is confirmed in this movie.[50] Tim Heitz also said that the two are \"going on a epic adventure\", but told fans to wait and see if the pair kiss on the lips.[51]\n\nIn a French interview to Little Big Animation, it was noted the film would focus much on Poppy and Branch's relationship with each other as it became closer to \"Broppy\" (this is a fan dubbed term by fans that has existed since Trolls that was first officially used in Trolls: Holiday in Harmony).[6]\n\nPlot Changes/Scene Deletions\n\nStorylines\n\nPerfect Family Harmony\n\nOriginally in concept artworks, the perfect Family Harmony could only be achieved by having BroZone singing out their songs and lending their talent essence to Branch. This would later be changed to them harmonizing and glowing as the finalized effects of the perfect family harmony.\n\nVelvet and Veneer's characterizations\n\nIn early concepts, Velvet and Veneer were originally going to be hideous villains, who were Bergens or resembled them. While Velvet's characterization had been more consistent with her being irredeemably evil and narcissistic, despite at one point being characterized to use sophisticated words albeit wrongly at times, Veneer has undergone more layers of changes. For example, he is given more sympathy with the implied background of having a sister that dictates his decision-making, while also having him accept his punishment to atone himself and becoming friends with Floyd in the end to let him have a change of heart and rediscovering his true self.\n\nUnlike the movie, Trolls Band Together: The Junior Novelization, due to being a beta manuscript that appears to have undergone very late changes, has no happy closure for Veneer and Floyd. He and Velvet were originally going to try escaping, only to fall off the yacht and into the river. This differs from how the movie actually gives him a second chance in life through Floyd who chooses to forgive and become his friend, despite receiving his punishment.\n\nVelvet and Veneer's twin status is also more pronounced in one of the deleted scenes' storyboards (back when they were designed to be Bergens), where Veneer protested that Velvet was only older than him by two minutes.\n\nFloyd's Plight\n\nThe presentation of Floyd being harmed was different. He was originally going to have his essence drained from his throat, rather than from his entire body. At one point during storyboard stage, Velvet was also planning to exploit Floyd's hair in a fantasy sequence as well.\n\nAt another earlier stage of development, the draining device used to suck Floyd's essence was a necklace, rather than a shoulder pad.\n\nCrimp's Species and Characterizations\n\nCrimp initially wasn't the only assistant Velvet and Veneer had. In fact, there were more of Crimp's kind who were also the twins' assistants.\n\nAnother deleted scene also showed that Crimp was more obviously complicit with Velvet and Veneer's scheme by pushing the four older BroZone brothers' bottles into the shoulder pads.\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nIntroduction and Wedding Scene\n\nThere are many changes for the wedding scene.\n\nFor instance, Fuzzbert was going to be part of the wedding guests. The guest Bergens also opened many umbrellas together to welcome Bridget arriving from descending from the sky, instead of her rollerblading onto the red carpet.\n\nBranch was also going to wear a tux for this occasion, rather than the varnished vest he wears at the wedding.\n\nThere was also going to be a scene where Gristle and Branch, as well as Bridget and Poppy, interacting with each other by letting the Bergen royal couple having their two Troll companions on their palms.\n\nBroZone Reunion Party Planning Scene\n\nMany characters, such as those from The Snack Pack, are also cut or have reduced screen-time during the movie, especially from a deleted scene about planning BroZone's reunion. King Trollex was originally going to be shown as the DJ, Smidge initially had involvement in wedding preparation, and Cloud Guy also was supposed to have more dialogues regarding his false advertising. In fact, there was going to be more Cooper and Prince Darnell interactions, like Cooper getting frightened over a nonexistent cupcake monster when checking out what's inside Fuzzbert, which causes Cooper himself to poop out cupcakes.[52]\n\nChad was also going to appear with King Gristle Jr., but he was not able to make through the final cut.[53]\n\nPeppy's Photo Album Scene\n\nKing Peppy was originally going to have a scene where he looked at a photo album that he retrieved from beneath his bed, reminiscing about Poppy's younger days, and missing Viva. Poppy's egg was seen and Viva was also supposed to be introduced at this point in a photograph which showed her holding Poppy as a baby.[54] Though it is known that Viva's removal was made a big reveal later in the movie. Branch's family loss would become the soul focus of the introduction.\n\nWall Climbing and Chipped Teeth Scene\n\nThere was originally a scene of John Dory, Branch and Poppy climbing up a tall hill with grappling hooks. During the climb, John Dory teased about Branch's baby teeth, which offended Branch, who unfortunately resulted in having chipped teeth and other injuries. This scene was cut likely due to graphic imagery and time constraints.\n\nBroZone Practice Montage\n\nThere was originally going to be a training montage inducted by Poppy to train three of the BroZone brothers' vocal chords and harmony, after Bruce, then called Selleck, was recruited. This was done through testing how the three brothers would manage to use their singing to shatter fragile objects.\n\nThis scene included a joke of Tiny Diamond not knowing John Dory's name as well.\n\nVelvet and Veneer's Spraying Scene\n\nThere was originally a scene where Velvet forcibly sprayed Floyd's essence into Veneer's mouth without warning, and then used her fingers to close his mouth.\n\nIllegal Pet Monkey\n\nVeneer's pet monkey was originally shown in one of the deleted scenes, being a monstrous monkey named Snorkels.\n\nBridget and Gristle's Honeymoon\n\nBridget and Gristle were originally going to have an entire montage of them enjoying their honeymoon at a water park, before Bridget rode their motorcycle into the sunset. This montage was likely cut due to time constraints.\n\nTrapped in Hole N' Fun\n\nClay was originally the one who orchestrated the plan of trapping his brothers and Poppy, with Viva and the other Putt Putt Trolls being his minions instead.\n\nPost-Argument in Rhonda Scene\n\nAfter Branch snapped at John Dory, Bruce, and Clay, Poppy was originally going to prevent Branch from exiting Rhonda.\n\nCrimp and Tiny Romancing\n\nThere was originally going to be a scene of Tiny and Crimp romancing each other, and leaving Branch and Poppy to continue with the rescue mission. Although this scene is intended to be a one-off gag, it became questionable due to both characters having a huge age gap, evidently with Tiny being a baby and Crimp implied to be older than him. This presumably led to this particular scene being cut.\n\nCar Chase Scene and Climax\n\nVelvet and Veneer originally had a different car, and they also had scarves instead of complete makeovers with their costumes and hairstyles like they have in the movie. The scarves were, in fact, tools to conceal the other BroZone brothers. Veneer initially was also shown to have concerns over the plan, but Velvet insisted that there would be no problem.\n\nRhonda was also going to pop out from the ground and onto the carpet, and Veneer could be seen covering his face in embarrassment during the confrontation. Both twins were additionally horrified to see Branch's face broadcast across the screens before they hurriedly leave.\n\nDuring the scene where Branch was trying to grab Floyd, Velvet was originally going to inhale Floyd's essence to break free from Branch's grip, rather than just swatting him.\n\nBoth Velvet and Veneer also descend differently onto the Rage Dome stage, falling with microphones without catching the cameras.\n\nVillains Singing Scene\n\nThere was originally a storyboard of a montage with prototype Velvet and Veneer singing while sucking Floyd dry to highlight their then undecided personalities, and that Crimp was going to interact with some rather scornful production crew who spat in disrespect.\n\nBranch and Poppy Kissing Scene\n\nBranch and Poppy originally kissed at a different angle during one of the storyboards.\n\nWorld Building\n\nDesigns\n\nMount Rageons\n\nMount Rageons were originally nonexistent as a species. Instead, they were intended to be a division of Bergens. Their addition is likely added much later into production.\n\nAlso, in earlier designs, many of them were illustrated in the shape of the letter \"V\", or presented as fuzzy or ugly monsters.\n\nMount Rageous\n\nAside from the Mount Rageons, their habitat Mount Rageous is introduced. It is designed to be a bustling hub inspired by 80's to 90's aesthetics, with constantly partying teenagers that the Mount Rageons are based on. It is also evident that it is more technologically advanced than most Troll tribes' settlements, having wide flat-screen televisions and even internet access. It is highlighted by visuals to be extremely night-less, glamorous, and bright, which is to correspond with the Mount Rageons' restlessness and vibrancy, but also their materialism and shallowness.\n\nMount Rageous is also entailed to have incorporated elements of a classic shoegaze band, and albums like Loveless. Furthermore, it was intended to have aesthetics of ribbon-like noodle streets, stacked gems, and floating signs. There was also intended to be jellybean cars as vehicles.\n\nVacay Island\n\nThe habitat Vacay Island is introduced. It is intended to visually convey relaxation and exuding paradise vibes. Early concept artworks showcase creatures outside of Vacaytioners living on the island.\n\nHole N' Fun\n\nThe habitat of the Putt Putt Trolls is also introduced, and it is evident with elements of abandoned golf courts. It was originally much wilder, more unkempt, and desolated as presented in concept artworks.\n\nMusic\n\nFor the score of the film, see Trolls Band Together (Original Motion Picture Score).\n\nMain article: Trolls Band Together (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n\nWhile Trolls World Tour was inspired by 80s Hard Rock music, the focus of Trolls Band Together is 90s boyband music. Theodore Shapiro returns as the main composer for the film while Justin Timberlake returns as the main music executive. They are joined by other musicians both some returning from Trolls World Tour as well as new ones. 5 original songs are set for the movie alongside more jukebox music, including classic songs and familiar upbeat ones. Like Trolls and Trolls World Tour, the same sequence choreographer, who worked with Justin for NSYNC, returns for dance sequences.[6]\n\nAs 2023 progressed, midway through the year, a rumor was spread that NSYNC was reuniting for a song related to the promotion of the movie. At the end of August, a website called \"Take You To a Better Place\" appeared with what seemed like NSYNC personified Trolls of the band, with Justin Timberlake's \"Troll\" being of course Branch.[55]\n\nPromotional Songs\n\nLet's Get Married\n\nBroZone's Back\n\nHustle Dimension\n\nBetter Place\n\nMovie Songs\n\nMovie\n\nPerfect - Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Kid Cudi and Troye Sivan\n\nLet's Get Married - Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Zooey Deschanel, Anderson .Paak, Kenan Thompson, Kunal Nayyar, Icona Pop and Ron Funches\n\nSweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) - Andrew Rannells and Brianna Mazzola\n\nWatch Me Work - Andrew Rannells and Brianna Mazzola\n\nLonely People - Troye Sivan\n\nVacay Island - Daveed Diggs, India Carney and Ty Taylor\n\nBroZone's Back - Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs and Anna Kendrick\n\n9 to 5 - Zosia Mamet\n\nHustle Dimension - Joseph Shirley\n\nIt Takes Two - Camila Cabello, Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs and Kid Cudi\n\nMount Rageous - Andrew Rannells and Brianna Mazzola\n\nBetter Place (Family Harmony) - Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Kid Cudi, Troye Sivan, Anna Kendrick and Camila Cabello\n\nEnding Credits\n\nBetter Place (Reunion) - *NSYNC, Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Troye Sivan and Kid Cudi\n\nFamily - Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Camila Cabello, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Kid Cudi and Troye Sivan\n\nPerfect - Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Kid Cudi and Troye Sivan\n\nIt Takes Two - Camila Cabello, Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Eric André, Daveed Diggs and Kid Cudi\n\nSoundtrack\n\nSee Trolls Band Together (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack).\n\nSuccess and Critical Response\n\nThe Metro writer LI-Z reviewed the movie. LI-Z reported having a soft spot for Trolls and enjoyed that movie but likened Trolls Band Together to a \"punch to the face\" and said it was \"painful to watch\". LI-Z applauded the visuals as a position as the animation was a positive but criticized the storyline as a negative and quoted that \"AI could have done better\". LI-Z summed it up as nothing but a cash grab when commenting on the desire for Justin Timberlake to make 7 films.[56]\n\nWendy Ide of The Guardian meanwhile also sided with LI-Z, noting like LI-Z that as a series Troll is \"wearing thin\".[57] Cath Clarke meanwhile presented a more positive overall review, but noticed a lot of elements of the movie were just backdrops to its bonkiness. While she didn't think the movie would become vintage family material, but noted it was gloriously odd in its own way.[58]\n\nHelen O'Hara of the Telegraph presented a more positive but critical review noting once again the animation and visuals were to be praised. Helen said the film was mostly weightless but fun. Helen criticised the film for aiming wierd but playing it safe at the last moment. [59]\n\nTrolls Band Together has grossed over $103 million in the United States and Canada, and $106.5 million in other territories, garnering for a worldwide gross of $209.5 million.[60][61] In the United States and Canada, Trolls Band Together was released alongside Next Goal Wins, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, and Thanksgiving, and was projected to gross $27–32 million from 3,800 theaters in its opening weekend.[62][63] The film made $9.4 million on its first day, including $1.3 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut $30.6 million, finishing second behind The Hunger Games.[64] The film made $17.8 million in its second weekend (a drop of 40.6%), finishing in fourth.[65]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 60% of 85 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Trolls Band Together serves up another amusing, eye-catching outing that should entertain young fans of the franchise while remaining perfectly painless for parents.\"[66] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[67] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, same as the first film, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 85% overall positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[68]\n\nFrank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Elizabeth Tippet's screenplay garners laughs thanks to the sheer volume of jokes (the hit-to-miss ratio is pretty unbalanced), and there are several amusing one-liners about the music business.\"[69] Tatiana Hullender of Screen Rant earned the film 2.5 out of 5 score, writing \"Trolls Band Together shows clear signs of franchise fatigue, but a few new songs and vivid animation choices keep it afloat a little longer.\"[70]\n\nAwards & Accolades\n\nYear Award Category Recipients Result Ref. 2023 Hollywood Music in Media Awards Original Song – Animated Film \"Better Place\" – Shellback, Justin Timberlake, and Amy Allen Won [71] Song – Onscreen Performance (Film) NSYNC – \"Better Place\" Nominated Music Supervision – Film Angela Leus Won Music Themed Film or Musical Trolls Band Together Won Soundtrack Album Trolls Band Together (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Nominated 2024 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Favorite Animated Movie Trolls Band Together Nominated [72] Favorite Female Voice from an Animated Movie Anna Kendrick Won Favorite Male Voice from an Animated Movie Justin Timberlake Nominated Favorite Villain Amy Schumer\n\nErrors\n\nWhen she appears Grandma Rosiepuff is shown sat at her table. However, in the shot of Branch and Floyd, it can be seen she is no longer at the table and has vanish.\n\nDuring Crimp's 9 to 5 segment, a half-body model of Veneer can be seen after he has finished pouring his coffee.\n\nWhen Velvet immediately wears the shoulder pads to test out the vacuum, her necklace is colored gold instead of purplish magenta.\n\nClay and Floyd's bottles in Velvet's shoulder pads are supposed to be left and right, respectively. However, in some of the scenes such as when Velvet and Veneer are both on the red carpet greeting their fans, the bottles' order are swapped.\n\nThe movie's partnership page was created in December 2022.[73][18]\n\nEarly \"coming soon\" promotions for merchandise began to appear in March and April 2023.\n\nIn addition, Universal and DreamWorks will also collaborate with several brands and product partnerships to promote the film for its marketing campaign, including ShineWater Beverages[74], ICEE[75], Shake Shack[76], Southwest Airlines[77], Candy[78], CAMP Store[79], Puma[80], and UK brands such as Zing Flowers.\n\nToys\n\nIn 2022, a licensing agreement with Mattel was announced. This comes ahead of the film, Mattel's merchandise distribution will begin in Fall 2023 in line with the release of Trolls 3.[81] In the process, Hasbro will no longer be producing toys under the \"Trolls\" brand.[82]\n\nToys began to be promoted from mid-2023, including Trolls Mineez[83][84], Imaginext[85] toys and Little Live Pets.[86] The first plush toys also began to appear.[87] Tie-ins for the movie also included a Polly Pocket tie-in.[88]\n\nMattel also created their own range of standard toys, these were similar to the Hasbro line.[89]\n\nSpecial\n\nWhen asked about any upcoming specials after Trolls: Holiday in Harmony, Tim Heitz mentioned that there none are being planned at the moment, but it doesn't mean there won't be any more.[90]\n\nBooks\n\nLike previous movies, The Art of DreamWorks Trolls Band Together was created for the movie. Unlike the concept art book for Trolls World Tour, The Art of DreamWorks Trolls World Tour, this book was set for a general release like the original The Art of DreamWorks Trolls book.\n\nThe Trolls Band Together: The Junior Novelization is due for released on the 10th October 2023, releasing both a normal and deluxe version.[91][92] There was also a Little Golden Book on the movie.[93]\n\nHome Video Releases\n\nThe DVD, Blu-Ray and 4K Ultra HD releases of Trolls Band Together were released on January 16, 2024.\n\nThere were several buyer options, including:\n\nA \"Sing-along\" edition, which featured bonus content only included in this version, such as the short It Takes Three.

One is a returning Trolls World Tour cake that features Poppy and Viva, while the other is a new brownie cake based on Branch and BroZone. Funables also ran a promotion with their Fruit Flavored treat snack bags featuring the characters of Branch and Floyd on them.\n\nApps & Video Games\n\nTrolls Remix Rescue was released on October 27, 2023. Though other apps have existed based upon Trolls, this is the first video game based upon the series.[96] In addition, the Trolls will also make an appearance in DreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing, which was released on November 3, 2023, though not as racers. Both games are available on the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Nintendo Switch.[97]\n\nEtymology\n\nSimilar to other puns in titles for the franchise, \"Band Together\" is likely a pun between two definitions of \"band\": a group of comrades and a group of musicians.\n\nThe title can also refer to the movie's premise, which is Poppy and Branch bringing the former band BroZone back together.\n\nAccording to a interview with Little Big Animation, the reason in the French version the name Trolls Band Together isn't translated and the movie is still being called \"Les Trolls 3\" (translation; \"The Trolls 3\") is simply that it is not possible to accurately translate it directly, due to \"band together\" being an idiomatic phrase in English, and the English title being a pun on its own right.[6]\n\nThis likely explains why the movie title is not translated in other languages as well. This would also explain past installments of the franchise seeing their titles renamed in other languages.\n\nCultural References\n\nDuring Velvet and Veneer's arrest, Clay notes they were commiting tax fraud and that there would be consequences. This is a popular cultural nod to the gangster Al Capone. Al earnt the reputation for being untouchable, as he would make people disappear or paid off corrupt law officials to look the other way. However, Al gained money illegally and thought he didn't have to declare it on his taxes, thus unwittily owed the IRS a lot of money.\n\nThe resulting charges meant officials above the local law enforcement were allowed to come in a cease him; these law enforcement officials could not be easily be bought/bribed by the gangster.\n\nAl was finally held accountable for a crime he could not get away with.\n\nAs a result, the IRS became a infamous threat to many for its ability to take down gangsters, celebrities, politicians and religious figures who remain untouchable where all other law enforcements could not do a thing to stop corruption. Thus, out of all the crimes committable in the Unite States of America, tax fraud is considered the only crime an individual cannot get away with.\n\nAs it is referencing this situation, while Velvet and Veneer may be able to get away with the events of Trolls Band Together, they cannot escape that particular charge, this is why Veneer also willingly accepts jail.\n\nIn the finale, Rhonda makes the Wookie sound from Star Wars, the same sound Chewbacca makes at the end of episode 4, when they celebrate at the end.\n\nWhen Velvet references her and Veneer's childhood, the first fake story is based upon Oliver Twist.\n\nThe movie makes many references to real boybands. In their departure, the Brozone references to real boy bands such as NSYNC, Boyz II Men, One Direction and the Backstreet Boys. The poster meanwhile notes the name of New Kids on the Block.\n\nThe Vacaytioners resemble \"Anything Muppets\", and the Mount Rageons resemble Betty Spaghetty doll range. Both are notable for their \"noodle arm\" style of design for their characters.\n\nVelvet and Veneer are nods to fake-celebrities. This happened from time to time in the 80s and 90s, wherein people with talent were deemed not good enough to promote so their talent was used and a someone else much more marketable was taught how to pretend. The most famous example of this being Milli Vanilli.\n\nThe chart show seen \"The Bop on Top\" is most likely a nod to song chart shows like the British chart show Top of the Pops.\n\nContinuity\n\nGeneral\n\nTrolls, Trolls Holiday, Trolls World Tour and Trolls: Holiday in Harmony all occurred within the first year of the storyline. Trolls Band Together is the first storyline to take place outside that of the first year. Despite this, only a short timespan has happened since the events of the previous movies and Trolls Band Together takes place 1 month after Trolls World Tour.\n\nThe 2D animation Trolls: TrollsTopia takes places over months, this is why 2D animations for the franchise is generally noted to be non-canon as it often contradicts the movies.\n\nThe franchise is fond of only giving estimations for ages. This meant that prior to this movie, age estimations by fans could only be made using Poppy's notable age of 20+ from Trolls, so all ages for other Trolls were estimated based around it this only. As of this movie, Branch's age is now confirmed to be 24+, making him at no older then 23+ in the previous movies and specials and giving a second age estimation for other Trolls.\n\nTiny Diamond is one month old, making him the only character so far to have an estimated age.\n\nPoppy didn't know Branch was in BroZone because he went by the name of \"Bitty B\".\n\nPoppy's Hug Time Bracelet she is known to wear in Trolls and Trolls World Tour is revealed to be Viva's.\n\nFloyd says upon meeting Branch he is more like a Trunk now. In many dubs, his name is translated to mean \"Trunk\" instead of \"Branch\".\n\nIn Trolls, the Bergens name means \"mountain\", the Mount Rageons name also contains the word \"Mountain\", which is both the name of the place they live and like the Bergens a reference to how they appear as big as a mountain to the Trolls. The name Mount Rageons itself, \"Mount\" as mentioned means \"mountain\" and \"Rageous\" means \"extreme anger\", is a pun on \"Outrageous\" meaning \"shockingly bad and excessive\" and likely refers to their culture and how they Rageons live.\n\nTrolls\n\nThe movie reveals John Dory tried to return but found no one there because of The Last Trollstice.\n\nBranch's 'Survival Bunker' was revealed to be originally a 'Fun Bunker' for him and his brothers to live in. It was started being built 10 years before Trolls. He built it as the Survival bunker after being left alone for more then 10 years with no family.\n\nThis movie also confirms that aside from BroZone and Rosiepuff, he had no other family members growing up, meaning that Branch grew up as an orphan with the location of their parents being lost or unknown.\n\nFloyd was the only one who had promised to return originally.\n\nViva's separation from her family most happened when Peppy was told some Trolls were behind in Trolls, he is seen going back for Darius and others. By this time the Trolls were under attack from the Bergens who had figured out about the tunnels. Peppy notes he was calling \"No Trolls Left Behind\" but Viva and her Trolls were separated by a boulder. This forced Peppy to escape with the Trolls he had and force him to leave the Trolls behind that he couldn't reach.\n\nThis story also reveals Clay was a witness to the event as he was with the Putt Putt Trolls.\n\nPresuming all other details are correct, Darius was the slowest member of Peppy's group and the last member of the Pop Trolls. Though non-canon, Trolls: The Junior Novelization states Darius injured his leg during the escape, so he was still able to get quite far away from the Troll Tree before the others were cut off.\n\nGrandma Rosiepuff, who is seen at the beginning of the moive, died before The Last Trollstice. Her death is generally one of the series indications of time since the cage around the Troll Tree is seen in Branch's flashback, which allows the placement of when BroZone broke up in the Trolls Timeline.\n\nDuring the Let's Get Married, Bridget sings part of the song Hello which she sung in Trolls.\n\nViva states The Last Trollstice escape happened at night.\n\nFor this statement to be correct, the escape would have had to occurred in the early morning while it was still dark, and was still taking place when the Bergens woke up as no night scenes were shown in Trolls during the escape, and the only night shown was later that day when Chef was banished by King Gristle Sr..\n\nThe tunnels are long and it is possible this was the case, but otherwise would be an error.\n\nIn addition, what was shown was according to Poppy's re-telling of the story as read from a scrapbook, thus may have inaccurate elements for this reason. The version said in this movie is based upon the eye witness accounts of Viva, Clay and King Peppy themselves. As exampled in Trolls World Tour with the recount of the Strings, Pop Trolls embellish stories.\n\nThe Water Park sign has a Wingdingle on it, this is mentioned in Trolls and is noted in the non-canon Branch and the Cooking Catastrophe as a bird that is a hazard to both Troll and Bergen alike.\n\nBranch is at his grandma's pod in the introduction of the movie, and again at the same pod just before the wedding. This places the BroZone break up at the Troll Tree as thats where the Pod is in present day.\n\nTrolls World Tour\n\nFloyd's is at least 2 months into captivity, meaning that he was already being held by Velvet and Veneer while the events of Trolls World Tour are occurring.\n\nViva's note about Peppy liking to keep secrets in regards to her is also a reference to Trolls World Tour where he didn't tell Poppy about the other Tribes.\n\nJohn Dory calls Queen Barb's world tour The Rock Apocalypse and notes this is the only reason he found out Branch was still alive because of his involvement with it.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe poster shows all 5 members of BroZone with their current (adult) hairstyles. From the front to back; Floyd, John Dory, Branch, Spruce and Clay can be seen.\n\nThis is the first time a Trolls franchise movie to:\n\nNot have Trolls lose colors on a massive scale.\n\nHave an antagonistic character redeem solo.\n\nThis is the first Trolls film to not star James Corden as Biggie. Instead, David Fynn, who voiced the character in the television series Trolls: The Beat Goes On! and Trolls: TrollsTopia, provides his voice.\n\nUnlike the Bergens, currently the Vacaytioners and Velvet and Veneer's respective species were not been named by official sources. However, the latter were named Mount Rageons in the movie.\n\nThe Palace Theatre in Gorleston played the 15 rate film \"Dream Scenario\" instead of Trolls Band Together by accident. This included 45 minutes of age appropriate ads, including a beheading.[98]\n\nThe movies plot happens in 3 days and two nights.\n\nPoppy is never referred to by a royal title in this movie, despite being Queen of the Pop Trolls.\n\nThis is the last Trolls movie to be made entirely by DreamWorks Animation in-house at their Glendale campus before it was reported that DreamWorks was moving away from producing films in-house to rely more heavily on outside Studios.\n\nTaglines\n\nVideos\n\nOfficial Trailers\n\nMovie Clips\n\nMusic Videos/Credits\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nCommercials\n\nPromotional Videos\n\nHow to Draw + Crafts\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial website\n\nDreamWorks Animation Wiki: Trolls Band Together\n\nBroZone Twitter account\n\nBroZone Website\n\nSoundtrack Website\n\nDreamWorks Trolls franchise Movies Trolls • Trolls World Tour • Trolls Band Together • Trolls 4 TV Specials Trolls Holiday • Trolls: Holiday in Harmony TV Series Trolls: The Beat Goes On! • Trolls: TrollsTopia Mini-series Troll 2 Troll • Trolls Holiday Digital Shorts • Ask Poppy • Tiny Diamond Goes Back To School • Trolls: Pump up the Party! • Trolls Scrapbook Stories • It Takes Three\n\nTrolls Band Together characters Trolls - Main Characters Queen Poppy • Branch • John Dory • Spruce • Floyd • Clay • Viva • Tiny Diamond Trolls - Minor Characters Guy Diamond • Satin & Chenille • Biggie • Cooper • Prince Darnell • King Peppy • Grandma Rosiepuff • Ablaze • Hype • Boom • Trickee Bergens King Gristle Jr. • Bridget • Miss Maxine • Aunt Smead Mount Rageons Velvet • Veneer • Kid Ritz Vacaytioners Brandy • Bruce & Brandy's Children Other Characters Mr. Dinkles • Cloud Guy • Crimp • Rhonda Cut Unknown"
