        "text": "Excerpt\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nHOW THE BOSS WON HIS TITLE\n\nLate last Thursday evening one Jonas Rodney Potts, better known to this community as \"Upright\" Potts, stumbled into the mill-race, where it had providentially been left open just north of Cady's mill. Everything was going along finely until two hopeless busybodies were attracted to the spot by his screams, and fished him out. It is feared that he will recover. We withhold the names of his rescuers, although under strong temptation to publish them broadcast.Ð²ÐâLittle Arcady Argus of May 21st.\n\nLooking back to that time from a happier present, I am filled by a genuine awe of J. Rodney Potts. Reflecting upon those benign ends which the gods chose to make him serve, I can but marvel how lightly each of us may meet and scorn a casual Potts, unrecking his gracious and predestined office in the play of Fate.\n\nOf the presentÐ²Ðâto meÐ²Ðâsupreme drama of the Little Country, I can only say that the gods had selected their agent with a cunning so flawless that suspicion of his portents could not well have been aroused in one lacking discernment like unto the gods' very own. So trivially, so utterly, so pitiably casual, to eyes of the flesh, was this Potts of Little Arcady, from his immortal soul to the least item of his inferior raiment!\n\nThus craftily are we fooled by the Lords of Destiny, whose caprice it is to affect remoteness from us and a lofty unconcern for our poor little doings.\n\nThere is bitterness in the lines of that Argus paragraph, and a flippant incivility might be read between them by the least discerning.\n\nArcady of the Little Country, however, knows there is neither bitterness nor real cynicism in Solon Denney, founder, editor, and proprietor of the Little Arcady Argus; motto, \"Hew to the Line, Let the Chips Fall Where they May!\" Indeed, we do know Solon. Often enough has the Argus hewn inexorably to the line, when that line led straight through the heart of its guiding genius and through the hearts of us all. One who had seen him, as I did, stand uncovered in the presence of his new Washington hand-press, the day that dynamo of Light was erected in the Argus office, could never suppose him to lack humanity or the just reverence demanded by his craft.\n\nWe may concede without disloyalty that Solon is peculiar unto himself. In his presence you are cursed with an unquiet suspicion that he may become frivolous with you at any moment,Ð²Ðâmay, indeed, be so at that moment, despite a due facial gravity and tones of weight,Ð²Ðâfor he will not infrequently seem to be both trivial and serious in the same breath. Again, he is amazingly sensitive for one not devoid of humor. In a pleasant sense he is acutely aware of himself, and he does not dislike to know that you feel his quality. Still again, he is bound to spice his writing. Were it his lot to report events on the Day of Judgment, I believe the Argus account would be thought too highly colored by many persons of good taste.\n\nBut Little Arcady knows that Solon is loyal to its welfareÐ²Ðâknows that he is fit to wield the mightiest lever of Civilization in its behalf on Wednesday of each week...."
