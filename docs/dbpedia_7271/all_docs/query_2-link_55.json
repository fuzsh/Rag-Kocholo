        "text": "This digital facsimile edition of a Motion Picture Magazine issue from 1918 is packed with articles, photos, film novelizations, and trade and commercial advertisements. Motion Picture Magazine was the top fan film magazine of the silent era in the United States, and often relayed facts (and sometimes billious exaggeration) on films, actors and directors.\n\nThe issue contains the articles âMy Devilish Ambitionâ (Alla Nazimova) by Hazel Simpson Naylor, âA Double Exposureâ (Charles Chaplin) by Fritzi Remont and Martha Groves McKelvie, âWill You Sanction This?â by Rex Beach, âMy Ideal Girlâ with responses from William Desmond, Edward Earle, William S. Hart, Harold Lloyd, Wallace MacDonald, Antonio Moreno, Charles Ray, Wallace Reid and Bryant Washburn, âLetting George Do Itâ (George Fisher) by Fritzi Remont, âScenarioizing a Great Playâ (The Yellow Ticket) by Tarleton Winchester, âInterviewing a Star Behind Barsâ (Gladys Leslie) by Herbert Howe, âTempered Steelâ (A stirring Olga Petrova story) by Beulah Livingstone, âA Eulogy to âLittle Maryââ by Arthur C. Brooks, âSunshine Mayâ (May Allison) by Roberta Courtland, âEntertaining Our Soldiers in Trainingâ by Stanley W. Todd, âThe Quest of the Holy Yaleâ by Maym Kelso, âFunny Happenings in the Studio and on Locationâ by Harold Lockwood, âTo the People of the Moviesâ by Frances Morrissey, âA Little of My Lifeâ by Marguerite Clark, âThe Story of Sylvia Breamer and How She Nicked Outâ by Eleanor Brewster, âOn the Appropriateness of Dressâ by DâIrwin Nemerov, âThe Diplomatic Directorâ (Robert Vignola) by Joseph Franklin Polan, âThe Latest and Greatest in the Rivoli Theater,â and the columns âPhotodrama in the Makingâ by Henry Albert Phillips, âLittle Whisperings from Everywhere in Playerdom,â âThe Answer Man,â âQuestions That Stumped the Answer Man,â âWho's Who in Starland,â âOpportunity Market,â âStage Plays That Are Worth While,â and more, illustration of Alla Nazimova (cover portrait), plus featured photographs of Nigel Barrie, George Beban, Enid Bennett, Miriam Cooper, Jane Cowl, Grace Darmond, Marjorie Daw, Madge Evans, Elsie Ferguson, Margarita Fischer, Clara Horton, Baby Marie Osborne, Wallace Reid, Alma Rubens, Pauline Starke, Constance Talmadge, George Walsh and Bryant Washburn, and film reviews in âOur Animated Monthly of Movie News and Viewsâ by Fritzi Remont and Sally Roberts, âAcross the Silversheetâ by Hazel Simpson Naylor and âThe Exhibitors' Verdictâ of A Dog's Life (1918), The Face in the Dark (1918), Friend Husband (1918), Hearts of the World (1918), The Hillcrest Mystery (1918), His Majesty, Bunker Bean (1918), Humdrum Brown (1918), The Lie (1918), The Life Mask (1918), Love Me (1918), Over the Top (1918), Social Hypocrites (1918), The Splendid Sinner (1918), Tarzan of the Apes (1918), La Tosca (1918), Twenty-One (1918), Unclaimed Goods (1918) and The Whispering Chorus (1918). Advertisements by Louise Huff for Ingramâs Milkweed Cream, Mary Pickford for Pompeian Beauty Powder, and Anita Stewart for Bonnie-B Veil. As always, some of the ads are a hoot.\n\nWe examined the edition on a Macintosh OS X computer with a DVD/CD drive. The Javascript-controlled, web-browser dependent disc operated as intended with OS X browsers Safari, Camino and Firefox. The disc should function properly in Windows browsers.\n\nThe page scans are clear and free of moirÃ©s, especially in the largest views, and all body type in the magazine in readable in all three page view sizes.\n\nWe are pleased with the ongoing production of facsimile editions of publications from the silent era. Some publications may survive only in a single copy, others may be rare but obtainable from specialty dealers (as is the case with this magazine). Collectors and historians alike can have ready access to contemporary reference materials in this digital form.\n\nWe recommend this CD-R edition of a typical issue of Motion Picture Magazine."
