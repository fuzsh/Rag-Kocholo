I'm trying to get some sleep here!”\n\n― Killer Bean telling the DJ to turn down the music.https://killer-bean.fandom.com/wiki/File:Killer_bean_Quote_1.mp3\n\nJack Bean, better known by his alias Killer Bean, is a former Shadow Bean and titular protagonist of the Killer Bean franchise. His first appearance was in The Killer Bean, and has appeared in every installment to the franchise since. He is portrayed by Vegas E. Trip in Killer Bean Forever and in the Killer Bean game, and by Jeff Lew in all other media.\n\nProfile[]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nThe Killer Bean[]\n\nIn The Killer Bean, Killer Bean looks like a red-pink jelly bean wearing purple gloves and purple footwear. His lips are the same hue as the gloves and footwear. Though he appears to be naked, this may just be the limited technology of the time. Killer Bean looks very different from his other counterparts in Killer Bean media, as he was going through his 'Jelly Bean Stage'.\n\nKiller Bean 2 - The Party[]\n\nIn Killer Bean 2 - The Party, Killer Bean seems to have grown, and is now a coffee bean. He still looks bare chested, but again, that is probably due to the limited technology of the time. He wears a black belt now, which holds what appear to be 5 rifle rounds. The belt also sports a golden buckle in the middle, with the initials \"KB\" on it. Killer Bean has 2 golden Beretta PX4 Storm-shaped pistols, but without a hammer. Killer Bean is now wearing black sleeves and leggings, with red gloves and shoes.\n\nKiller Bean 3 (Previz)[]\n\nIn the previz scenes of Killer Bean 3, his \"KB\" bullet belt has been replaced with a default one, and his boots have more detail (although it is low poly). It might be that this model was used for previz, hence the belt and low poly model.\n\nKiller Bean Forever[]\n\nIn Killer Bean Forever, Killer Bean now has red body armor covering his front, likely given to him by the Shadow Agency. He appears much more stylized, with black buckles on his sides and black quarter-circles around his hip area. He has green eyes with black pupils, and retains the black belt, but this time instead of 'K.B' on it, it's just plain gold, as well as the fact that the bullets to the side are gone now. He keeps the black sleeves and leggings as well. He retains the red shoes, but this time they have Velcro, with gold buckles. They also have grooves on the bottom. On the bottom of his armor are two holsters, where he keeps his guns. The gold Berettas have undergone some drastic design changes, this time with black rectangles on the sides, along with golden dragons with their mouths facing towards the muzzle. It is unknown where he got these new guns, but it is very likely that he got them from the Shadow Agency as well. He uses the same golden bullets as the did in Killer Bean 2, but he now has smaller bullets. He also has a golden bullet magazine.\n\nKiller Bean Unleashed[]\n\nIn Killer Bean Unleashed, his appearance is identical to his appearance in Killer Bean Forever, except for the green irises which have been removed for whatever reason.\n\nVersion 3.52[]\n\nHe is now in 3D, and his model is less detailed because of performance issues.\n\nKiller Bean (series)[]\n\nIn Killer Bean, his appearance is identical to his appearance in Killer Bean Forever. However, if you take a closer look at his shoes in the new series, you will see that they have a black shoe buckle and a black bottom. His model along with other bean models also received an HD upgrade.\n\nKiller Bean (game)[]\n\nHis appearance is the same as in Killer Bean Unleashed, but with improved quality. His model doesn't have the same quality as in the series and in Killer Bean Forever.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nKiller Bean is often seen as cocky and reckless. He is shown doing things like engraving his name in his own bullet casings and not taking Cappuccino seriously while being interrogated by him. He also occasionally cracks jokes and quips.\n\nSkills[]\n\nKiller Bean seems to be very athletic and flexible, being able to perform flips and jumps with ease. He has a lot of upper and lower body strength, climbing up high places and kicking other beans a few feet away. Along with this, Killer Bean is very talented when it comes to assassination. He is shown taking out two warehouses full of beans, an insurgency, Vagan, and Jet Bean. Killer Bean seems to have undergone prior Martial Arts training, as he was able to hold his own against Jet Bean, although he was losing- in Top 10 Kills, Killer Bean says that his Martial Arts wasn't to the same degree as Jet Bean's. Killer Bean also seems to have very good aim along with showing high skill with guns, being able to wipe out a warehouse full of Cappuccino's beans with ease, as well as killing all of the elite Mercenary Beans that Vagan hired.\n\nHe is also very intelligent, shown in Killer Bean 2: The Party when he used an explosive can to kill the 2 remaining beans by shooting at the can, and killing Jet Bean by the use of precise calculating and geometry.\n\nKiller Bean is also shown having the skills of breakdancing, usually using it to dodge incoming bullets.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Killer Bean[]\n\nA red bean is shown strapped to a chair in a room by The Mafia. He is first shown asleep, until the Mafia Boss slaps him awake. The Mafia Boss then asks the bean who he is. He proceeds to not answer and instead observes his chains. The red bean is then slapped again. He threatens the Mafia Boss, and is then asked again who he is. The bean finally answers and reveals himself to be Jack Bean, otherwise known as the notorious Killer Bean. The Mafia Boss is shocked by the bean's identity, and the other beans in the room prepare their guns. The boss runs away in fear, only to be shot by one of his own men with a shotgun. Killer Bean is then approached by the Mafia Enforcer, and is punched several times before being knocked out of his chair and picked up by two guards. He then steals the guns from the guards and shoots the Mafia Enforcer. After killing the two guards, a grey bean armed with a submachine gun approaches him. He rolls away from the incoming bullets before killing the grey bean with several gunshots. The bean with the shotgun fires at Killer Bean, who dodges each shot. Killer Bean then jumps onto the Mafia Enforcer, points a gun at his head, and shoots him with a grin on his face.\n\nKiller Bean 2 - The Party[]\n\nKiller Bean is once again shown sleeping, this time, in his own apartment. He is woken up by the loud music playing down the street in a nearby warehouse. He promptly calls them and tells them to turn down the volume of their music, which prompts them to turn it up instead, Killer Bean gets angry, grabs his guns, and jumps from his 4th story apartment into his car. Killer Bean drives his car on a ramp through one of the warehouse windows and crashes into the speaker system the partying beans are using. Killer Bean focuses on the DJ bean, but then he notices a motorcycle trying to crash into him, and he promptly shoots it down. He then jumps up into the air and onto one of the hooks of the warehouse. After getting shot at, the hook proceeds to move closer to his attackers. Killer Bean shoots a bean, and the hook he is hanging on to gets shot by another bean, causing him to fall. The bean who shot the hook attempts to shoot him but then gets shot by Killer Bean. After killing a few more beans, he rolls under one of the platforms and shoots one of the beans on top of it. After the beans listen for each other for a few seconds, Killer Bean notices what appears to be a propane canister; he throws it up the platform and shoots it, causing it to explode. The beans who were on the platform get caught in the explosion and are blown off the platform burning. Killer Bean proceeds to laugh at the burning corpses, until he notices the DJ running away with the disc onto the roof. Killer Bean follows him, and has a standoff sequence with the bean, ultimately ending with Killer Bean winning. He then takes the disc, and throws it into the air and shoots it.\n\nKiller Bean Forever[]\n\nKiller Bean is sent to Beantown to assassinate Dark Bean, a rogue member of the Shadow Agency. He is awoken by a bunch of gangster beans having a loud party. After initial warnings, he finds himself aggravated and ignored. As an act of annoyance he crashes the party in Killer Bean fashion, guns blazing. His rampage did not slip by the local authorities, which find the massacre he left behind, as well as his engraved golden bullets all over the warehouse. Detective Cromwell leads the case, initially believing this shooting to be a professional killing, carried out as a gang attack.\n\nAfterward, he is seen awakening, scolded by his mysterious contractor on his communicator for his recklessness and killing those he was not assigned to kill. Meanwhile, Cappuccino, boss of the local mafia, is seen enraged at his Nephew's death, who was one of the victims of Killer Bean's rampage. He tasks Vagan, his right hand man, with taking down Killer Bean.\n\nAfter an encounter with Vagan at another of Cappuccino's warehouses, he meets Detective Cromwell at a local bar. Cromwell reveals his knowledge of the warehouse battle and suggests they team up. Killer Bean declines Cromwell's offer. The Bartender eventually runs in with a shotgun demanding that they leave, presumably prompted by the two beans revealing their guns. This causes a quick standoff between all three of them that ends with Cromwell leaving the Bar. A quick fight breaks out after Killer Bean leaves the bar, related with Vagan's note from the warehouse, and Cromwell is defeated.\n\nKiller Bean heads to yet another warehouse, where he takes out more of Cappuccino's beans. Mercenaries hired by Vagan arrive soon after, but none can defeat him. Vagan arrives and is finally able to capture Killer Bean. Killer Bean awakes tied to a chair, and is interrogated by Cappuccino. After learning nothing, Cappuccino signals for Killer Bean to be killed, since according to him, \"His time was wasted\". Killer Bean escapes from the chair and has a standoff with Vagan. Killer Bean reveals he has been sent to kill Vagan, who is actually Dark Bean. Cappuccino promptly flees, not before firing Vagan on the spot. Vagan then shoots Cappuccino in annoyance. He explains how the Shadow Beans are now merely guns-for-hire and have lost all honor. Killer Bean denies this and shoots him, killing Vagan.\n\nAfter taking down Dark Bean, Killer Bean notices that his communicator is disabled, confirming Dark Bean's story. Killer Bean notices that he is in grave danger, and the police arrive. Killer Bean turns himself in, not wanting any fights with the authorities.\n\nHis Assailant, the martial artist Jet Bean, arrives in Beantown and attempts to locate Killer Bean in an effort to dispatch the now compromised Operative. As Jet Bean stumbles across the bloodbath that Dark Bean and Killer Bean have left behind, he attacks one of the police officers who are busy cleaning the mess up.\n\nJet Bean is arrested for assaulting the officer, but escapes with little effort, completely destroying the police force along the way. He finds Killer Bean in his cell and throws him his pistols to make the duel equal. After a long fight, Killer Bean wins by tossing a bullet and shooting it mid-air, propelling the round into Jet Bean's stomach. He calls the Shadow Agency voice to inform them that he is coming to kill them. Killer Bean claims all the police weapons and prepares to go to war against the Shadow Beans.\n\nThe Return of Killer Bean[]\n\nKiller Bean's car is stolen by unknown enemies. Killer Bean kills them with little effort, but the last one threatens to shoot his car. Killer Bean says he can have it and throws the car keys into a pile of garbage. As the bean digs for searches, Killer Bean gets into his car. When the bean finally finds them, it is revealed to be a bomb. It explodes and sends the Mercenary Bean flying through the air. Killer Bean asks the bean if he enjoyed the ride, which he replies he did not. Killer Bean says \"I did,\" and drives away.\n\nKiller Bean (series)[]\n\nKiller Bean after claiming the police vehicle, Killer Bean understands that the shadow agency has a teleportation system keeping them on the move, so to find their current location, he drives to the home of Kessler, an agent that defected from the agency. Kessler, in an attempt to test Killer Bean, sends his specially developed drones to kill him. After he defeats the drones, he finds Kessler hiding in his bathroom bunker, refusing to leave citing he has every single streaming service known to man, 6 months of food and a toilet. Killer Bean out destroys the WiFi router to get Kessler out. When Killer Bean explained his desire to destroy the shadow organization, Kessler mentions that the agency upgraded it making it nearly untraceable without a special computer prototype: the CPU that Killer Bean destroyed in the fight. Kessler sends him to find the second computer owned by Reximus. He also sends MAX, an A.I. drone with him.\n\nKiller Bean then arrives at Reximus' Base, along with M.A.X, who asks him a lot of questions. He starts running on a pipe with M.A.X as his eyes and managed to kill most of Reximus' thugs. However, one thug alerted Reximus and he assigned two of his thugs and Sniper to kill Killer Bean. After he managed to kill his backup thugs, Sniper is seen standing on a roof aiming her rifle at Killer Bean and firing a shot at him. In some unknown way, Killer Bean survived the shot.\n\nKiller Bean (game)[]\n\nKiller Bean will serve as the main and playable character of the game. It will take place during and after Episode 2, which means Killer Bean has survived Sniper's shot. However, the plot is procedurally generated, meaning that there is no true plot to the game.\n\nGallery[]\n\nMain article: Killer Bean/Gallery\n\nQuotes[]\n\nMain article: Killer Bean/Quotes\n\nTrivia[]"
