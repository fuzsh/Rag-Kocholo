        "text": "August 28, 2024 . It’s hard to believe that another Labor Day weekend is on the doorstep of time and the end of summer is insight. And, folks, the older we get, the faster it happens. Beach trips will be replaced by many in the coming days with Friday night lights and excitement on the football fields, and locally, as we also know, Saturdays at the stadium; each game will be preceded by tailgating, which has become an event all its own and something we’ll explore soon. This year has been a blur to me for reasons most of you all know, and I won’t continue to rehash the personal setbacks I’ve encountered with health scares and family loss, but “it’s been real,” as the saying goes. At the same time, however, I am blessed to be here to share food, fun and fellowship ideas with you through each season. The High Country of North Carolina is such a great place to call home, so let’s make memories, eat well, love well and enjoy life while we can. Hope you have Labor Day off from work to spend with your loved ones and are able to cook up a few favorites for your family and friends. Maybe these suggestions will help. By Sherrie Norris\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 28, 2024 Grandfather Mountain, the not-for-profit nature park run by the Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation, has announced that it will be hosting its annual Junior Naturalist Day on Saturday, Sept. 7. Activities, included with admission, will be provided specifically for children ages 5 to 12 – though all ages are welcome – to explore their environment and experience all that Grandfather has to offer. Programming takes place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and will feature birding with a naturalist, nature journaling, insect investigation and more.\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 28, 2024 On Thursday, August 22, Mayor Charlie Sellers called for a special meeting of the Blowing Rock Town Council. The meeting took place on August 26, 2024 at 5:00 p.m., which adhered to the town’s bylaws requirement that a special called meeting be scheduled and announced at least 48 hours in advance. The meeting topic was a discussion of the Blowing Rock Planning Board’s membership. “I am very concerned with the conversations going on in town,” Sellers said prior to the meeting. “We have a planning board that is not functioning in the way it should be. Gregg Bergstrom has made comments that the mayor and town council have not been transparent,” Sellers said. “Calling the meeting was a decision I had to make.” Sellers opened the meeting by stating, “This is special meeting that I called. We should all act in a professional manner. Some people can’t do that.”\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 27, 2024 After years of speculation, research, interviews and more, local historian, Terry L. Harmon, is pleased to announce that his long-awaited book about the Durham family murders is now available. Released on August 17, 2024, CONVOLUTED: The 1972 Durham Family Triple Homicide is currently available only on Amazon and is quickly gaining momentum among High Country residents who have been captivated for years by the horrific crime occurring in Boone’s backyard. Harmon’s indepth research comes alive on 581 pages of the paperback book, with many pictures and personal accounts and memories of those closest to the situation helping to tell the story. By Sherrie Norris\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 27, 2024 One of the North Carolina High Country’s most popular, and downright beloved annual events– the Avery County Agricultural and Horticultural (A&H) Fair–will run this year from Wednesday, September 4 through Saturday, September 7 at Heritage Park (Avery County Fairgrounds), located at 661 Vale Road in Newland. The Fair will start at 5:00 p.m. and last until 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 4; Thursday, September 5; and Friday, September 6. The Fair will begin at 1:00 p.m. and last until 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, September 7. Admission at the gate each day/evening/night of the Avery A&H Fair is free.

The college’s student body has increased by nearly 100 students since the start of the 2023–24 academic year, with impressive growth across the college’s main campus and online and distance learning programs. This growth reflects both improved enrollment numbers and an improved retention rate, which has increased to 69% this year, up from 62% in the 2023–24 year.\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 27, 2024 Grandfather Mountain, the not-for-profit nature park run by the Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation, recently wrapped up construction on the Ginny Burton Education and Animal Care Facility, part of the nature park’s growing Conservation Campus. While the new space is not open to general guests, it will be a stop on Behind-the-Scenes Tours (one of the mountain’s special add-on experiences) offered by habitat staff. The facility is tailored to the needs of Grandfather’s growing education and habitat teams, providing more collaborative work space, a break room and private offices, while also allowing keepers to give top-level care for the animals that call the mountain home.\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 26, 2024 I was on vacation two weekends ago, so I missed the chance to review this movie when it nearly took down “Deadpool & Wolverine” for the #1 spot at the box office. Two weeks later, the film has dropped to #3, but it still outperformed everything that opened this past weekend, not to mention racking up an impressive $120 million domestic total. It is time to officially take a look at this movie, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to do so. Blake Lively stars as Lily Bloom, a woman who loves flowers. Fortunately the movie is only this annoyingly on-the-nose this one time. She meets handsome neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni, also the film’s director) on the roof of her apartment building while he’s in a furious mood over a dead child. She’s put off by his violent anger, but supposes that anyone can lash out over something so horrific.\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 23, 2024 Letters to the Editor. By Greg King / First, I labored under the impression that volunteers serving the Town in elected or appointed positions had a duty to promote confidence in Town decisions and contribute to the public trust fairly and honestly. They are, after all, part of the Town administration and if they found themselves unable to perform as required, they could or should resign. Bergstrom writes “…Blowing Rock has not been open, honest or transparent…”\n\nAnd “The Town attempted to skirt…”. These do not sound like confidence building or building public trust. It may be better for Bergstrom to resign and simply state he is unable to fulfill his obligation.\n\nRead more\n\nAugust 23, 2024 Letters to the Editor. By Craig Dudley / In ‘our’ democracy which isn’t, you vote in primaries to choose your candidate. We were established as a democratic republic: not a democracy. There’s a difference. Kamala wasn’t chosen in elections but installed by party bosses when the survival of old joe became questionable against the orange man. So the current ‘dance’ in Chicago touting a non-existent democracy is a sham designed to obfuscate. Mindlessness rules the Western world. This is even true of Trump supporters where one would hope awareness prevails. It doesn’t. There are many examples in American history in which the choice of the people was ignored in favor of the ruling ‘elite’. The Vietnam war is a good example as were our other various wars, all begun without congressional action, using doublespeak to ‘authorize’ them.\n\nRead more"
