        "text": "When a shy, withdrawn office clerk is told by a fortune teller he is a reincarnation of both Napoleon and an Egyptian pharaoh, his personality goes through some radical and certainly comic changes. The mouse becomes a lion, taking on his boss and winning the heart of the boss's daughter. A nice little comedy with an excellent cast. Don't miss Ball in one of her first films. Two silent versions of the story were also made: the first by Paramount in 1918, the second by Warner Brothers in 1925."
