Out of necessity, I learned the basics of filmmaking: acting, writing, directing, editing, visual effects, scoring…you name it; I was the Robert Rodriguez of morning announcements.\n\nAll of these skills came in handy when I attended the University of Miami’s film school. After making the leap to Los Angeles, I’ve continued to hone my craft by working in the editing room for studio films like “Hot Tub Time Machine” and “The Muppets”, on the sets of films like “The Hangover Part III” and as a Producer for ESPN. All the while, I continue to write, direct and edit my own films.\n\nIMAGES FROM THE FILM:\n\nTRAILER: N/A\n\n_____________________\n\nBUG BITES (USA)\n\nSYNOPSIS: Some house guests are a real pain in the ass.\n\nRATINGS GUIDE: Violence, Strong Language, Adult Content, Intense Imagery\n\nDIRECTOR: Daniel DelPurgatorio\n\nGENRE: Horror, Comedy\n\nPREMIERE STATUS: Regional Premiere\n\nSCREENING DATE: Wednesday, Nov. 2nd @ 11:00 AM\n\nDIRECTOR’S BIO: Daniel DelPurgatorio most recently directed the award – winning short films Bug Bites , Third Wheel , Body(s) , OTHER , and in 2009, Watchmen: Tales of the Black Freighter for Warner Bros .
