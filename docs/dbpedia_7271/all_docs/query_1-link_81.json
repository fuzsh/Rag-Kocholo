        "text": "Hello Supercult West! This is Supercult South Bad Movie Professor Cameron Coker (BS in “Jeff Lew” with a minor in “Double-Flushers”) and I’m reaching out to you from across the country to help hype tonight’s screening of Killer Bean Forever!\n\nBack in the 90s when 3D animation was just becoming accessible and YouTube hadn’t been founded yet, Jeff Lew taught himself 3D animation with a 3-minute short film called Killer Bean: The Interrogation. Though it was only meant as a learning exercise, the video still got several thousand hits when he posted it on the internet. Jeff eventually joined the animation industry, working as an animator on films like X-Men (2000) but Killer Bean was still Jeff’s outlet for practicing animation and expressing his personal style and in 2000, Kller Bean 2.1: The Party, was released. Clocking in at 7 minutes, the short film took 3 years to create and it received over a million views, which is probably hundreds of millions of views in modern times if you factor in inflation.\n\nThe success of his pet project prompted him to keep at it while still keeping up with his visual effects animation career for Hollywood, but after receiving numerous calls from movie producers that never developed, Lew decided to make a full feature animated film himself. 5 months for a rough screenplay, 1 ½ years for previz, 3 years in animation, a posted ad on Craigslist for voice talent, and finally in 2008 he had done it. Killer Bean Forever, an 85-minute 3D animated feature was screened at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nConsider that most animators at a major studio are given several weeks to complete a single shot of animation. While previsualization and post production can add years to a feature’s production time, the bulk of the production, such as animation, effects, and lighting, are often crammed into a year or perhaps just a few months. That’s over 100k man hours, over 12 years of work, crammed into just one year with the combined efforts of an army of skilled artists and technicians. Jeff Lew did it all himself in just 3 years while maintaining his day job working on Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, Supercult Classic The Matrix Reloaded, and acting as an animation consultant on Looney Tunes: Back in Action.\n\nJeff wrote, produced, directed, animated and starred in Killer Bean as Jet Bean. He was also the cinematographer, the editor, the lighting department, the art department, the music composter, and the sound designer. And though he’s not credited on IMDB for it, we’re pretty sure he was also the costume department, location scout, casting department, stunt coordinator, hair and makeup, dance choreographer, and caterer. Killer Bean is a miracle of dedication, ambition, and the self-made man; a shining example of the power of a single human bean’s perseverance.\n\nIs Killer Bean Forever a good film? No! It’s an amateurish, crude, poorly-lip synched dumpster fire about sentient coffee beans killing each other. Is it a great Supercult Film? You bet your ass it is. Not only that, but since it’s wide release on DVD in 2009, Killer Bean has spawned a cult following, a mobile game, Killer Bean: Unleashed, and plans for a 10-episode series were announced in early 2020. Simply put, it’s the best damn film about sentient coffee beans killing each other you’ll see all year.\n\nHe’s just a bean trying to get some sleep!\n\nSupercult West is proud to present, Killer Bean Forever!"
