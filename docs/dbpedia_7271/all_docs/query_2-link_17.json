        "text": "There is no gainsaying the fact that the title, \"Souls for Sables,\" is a fitting one for the story of the new production now holding forth at the Colony. It is a photoplay which begets little sympathy as it treats its female characters in an ignoble fashion. From this film one would judge that most women would forget hearth and home when they find themselves confronted with a soft glossy sable coat. Nothing else matters apparently if the two women in this effusion do not own sable coats, and once they find themselves in possession of such costly garments, they have to hide them from their husbands. In one case the woman is deceitful and in the other it is only a combination of circumstances coupled with a degree of stupidity.The continuity of \"Souls For Sables\" is weak. It lacks imagination, even in scenes where there is an opportunity to bring out something like dramatic action. There is one scene where Alice Garlan, has just concealed her fur coat in a closet when her husband crosses the threshold of her room. He wants his dressing gown and searches for it. One expects that Mrs. Garlan will endeavor to assist her husband on the pretence that he might disturb her gowns, but she remains at a distance fearful that the sable coat may be seen. Fred Garlan then finds his dressing gown, but in taking it off the hanger he causes one of his wife's frocks to fall to the floor. Here was another chance for Mrs. Garlan to pounce on her husband and keep him away from the closet. She does no such thing, and Garlan runs his hands along the row of frocks and accidentally observes an inch of the precious sable coat peeping from under the dress that was put over it. Thereupon we have a scene in which the husband is infuriated at his wife. Where did she get the money for the coat? She tells him truthfully that she won it by a little gamble in stocks. Where did she get the money to invest in stocks! She won it in a poker game from the notorious Harrison Morrill.In the first place, Mrs. Garlan, although she was peeved with her husband for working night after night, had such a spacious and well-furnished home that one sable coat more or less should have meant nothing to her.Garlan is general manager of an important soap factory, and his dark-eyed secretary appears only to take an interest in the back of his head. Garlan, with one of his directors, carries on his business in a restaurant to which the notorious Morrill takes Esther Hamilton and Mrs. Garlan. Both the women have sable coats, Mrs. Hamilton's having been purchased by Morrill at an early stage of the story, while Mrs. Garlan's was bought on the day of the dinner. No wonder comment is made on Morrill and his sable coats.In their honeymoon days, only a year before, Mrs. Garlan called her husband \"Lambykins,\" while the deceitful and weak Mrs. Hamilton always helped her husband with his overcoat and said: \"Good-bye Jimsy.\"Claire Windsor is lavishly dressed and quite pretty in the rôle of Mrs. Garlan. One of her gowns is of silver metallic cloth, trimmed with lace. Eugene O'Brien figures in the rôle of Garlan, and, considering the situations, he handles the character fairly well. Eileen Percy is cast as Mrs. Hamilton. She is attractive in her less demonstrative scenes, but once she strikes the emotional notes she appears to be giving a bewildered imitation of how a woman would act in the circumstances.\"Souls for Sables\" is said to have been suggested by David Graham Phillips's novel. \"Garlan & Co.\" In film form this story has no soul, but more than its quota of sable coats.\n\nTwo Sable Coats.\n\nSOULS FOR SABLES, with Claire Windsor, Eugene O'Brien, Claire Adams, Edith Yorke, George Fawcett, Eileen Percy, Anders Randolf and Robert Ober, suggested by David Graham Phillips's story, directed by James McKay; \"Colony Melody Masters\"; divertissement with Olga Mishka and a harp orchestra. At the Colony.While it has been fairly well stripped of the spirit of Harry Leon Wilson's charming story, the picturization of \"His Majesty Bunker Bean,\" the current offering at Warners's Theotre, still possesses certain amusing moments, which yesterday occasionally aroused a round of laughter. It is a pity that the truly humorous incidents have been spoiled by a repetition of action, which manifests a tendency on the part of the director to employ the sledge hammer rather than the gimlet. Therefore, although one is never actually annoyed by this feature, it is obvious that the influence is that of the illustrious Mack Sennett.The idea of a young man who believes that his astral body is that of Napoleon and also one of the early Egyptian potentates has possibilities for a shadow entertainment, but this theme has been handled in such a clumsy fashion that it appeals only as a mediocre diversion. One cannot hold Matt Moore to blame for the exaggeration which courses through this picture, as it is evident that he was only obeying the instructions of the director, Harry Beaumont.Here we have Bunker Bean, the stenographer, who visits the clairvoyant or crystal gazer. Countess Casanova, and is informed that he last lived as Napoleon, which notion is one intense gratification to him, until he dwells in subsequent conversation on the way in which Napoleon is supposed to have tramped over women. He later learns from a Professor Balthasar that his spirit occupied the body of an Egyptian King, and for the nominal donation of $5,000 the Professor promises to produce the mummy of Bunker Bean's ancestor. The stenographer, who had inherited just that sum, is so anxious to get away from the destructive memory of Napoleon that he proffers the check he received as a bequest and eventually finds himself in possession of a supposed mummy. He arrays himself as a Pharoah of old and causes no little concern by his conduct. There happens, however, to be a dog in his household, an animal with infinitely more common sense than the gullible Bunker Bean. This dog takes an instant dislike to the mummy and forthwith leaps upon the precious effigy and separates the head from the torso, with the result that Bunker Bean is a sadder and wiser young man. In the mummy's head he discovers a comparatively recent issue of an afternoon newspaper in which the main headline announces a victory of the Giants.In a struggle with the villain of the narrative, Bunker Bean finds that his worries at any rate have added to his muscular strength. Here was a man who in the past Bunker Bean looked upon as his superior, but who after a tussle Bunker Bean discovers to be hardly his equal. They both fight on until they fall into the pond. Marie Breede, the sympathetic daughter of Bunker Bean's employer, greets the wet and straggling hero when he emerges from the water, and one divines from her demeanor that she will soon fall into the water herself. Such is the case, and in the last scene one perceives Bunker Bean and Marie, ignoring the presence of the drowning villain, as they embrace in the artificial lake.This is a story which should have been filmed with the assistance of the author, for it is certain that he would never have permitted the idea to sink to such slapstick depths."
