        "text": "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (116 mins, 15) Directed by Callie Khouri; starring Sandra Bullock, Ellen Burstyn, Maggie Smith\n\nMa femme est une actrice (95 mins, 15) Directed by Yvan Attal; starring Charlotte Gainsbourg, Yvan Attal, Terence Stamp\n\nHappy Times (96 mins, PG) Directed by Zhang Yimou; starring Zhao Benshan, Dong Jie\n\nVan Wilder: Party Liaison (93 mins, 15) Directed by Walt Becker; starring Ryan Reynolds, Tara Reid, Kal Penn\n\nThe Bunker (90 mins, 15) Directed by Rob Green; starring Charley Boorman, Jason Flemyng, Christopher Fairbank\n\nThe Eye (99 mins, 15) Directed by Oxide and Danny Pang, starring Angelica Lee, Lawrence Chow\n\nFor a decade, we've been waiting for Callie Khouri, the author of Thelma and Louise, to direct her own movie. Sadly, she's come up with the appallingly sentimental Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, a half chick-flick, half boiler-flick. The chick is Sandra Bullock, a playwright who affronts her wilful, neurotic, abusive, alcoholic mother (Ellen Burstyn, hovering as usual on the brink of hysteria) by spilling the beans about her childhood to Time magazine. The boilers are the quartet of cracked Southern belles made up of Mom and her protective, lifelong friends (Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight). The latter three abduct Bullock from New York to Louisiana to show her, via flashbacks, what a wonderful woman Burstyn was. Mom calls Bullock 'Sunflower', Dad calls her 'Butterbean', which would make any girl leave home. As Burstyn's husband, James Garner broods like a man with murder or suicide on his mind; as Bullock's understanding fiancé, Angus MacFadyen sports an accent normally used by tone-deaf Englishmen for telling bad Irish jokes.\n\nIn Yvan Attal's directorial debut, Ma femme est une actrice, Attal and his real-life wife, the enchanting Charlotte Gainsbourg, play a French sportswriter called Yvan and his wife, a movie star called Charlotte. In addition to being a boorish philistine the way all sports journalists are in films (eg Spencer Tracy in Woman of the Year, Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple, Dermot Mulroney in My Best Friend's Wedding ), Yvan becomes pathologically jealous after fantasising about his wife making love to other actors in the movies. The jokes are extremely poor (especially those in the subplot in which Ivan's pregnant sister rows with her gentile husband about circumcision), and the script is as shaky as the Millennium Bridge which Yvan crosses to Tate Modern while visiting London to see Charlotte perform opposite screen heartthrob Terence Stamp in a cheesy movie she's making in Britain. Stamp acts as if he's expecting to be dubbed into French.\n\nThe estimable Zhang Yimou, director of such masterpieces as Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern, comes a cropper with the embarrassing tragicomedy Happy Times, a patronising twist on City Lights set in a Chinese city where skyscrapers are rising along with unemployment. The slight plot turns on a middle-aged, out-of-work artisan being inveigled by his fat, two-timing fiancée into taking her blind stepdaughter off her hands. Together with equally dim friends, he tricks the girl into believing he's the head of a smart hotel that is in reality an abandoned warehouse. It's a bland, patronising piece with little in the way of social observation, and one is astonished to see that the co-producer is Terrence Malick, one of the most fastidious directors at work today.\n\nThe hero of the dreadful Van Wilder: Party Liaison is an eternal student who has deliberately put off graduating from college because he loves the life of endless partying, boozing, screwing and playing such tricks as getting thick sorority kids to eat eclairs stuffed with semen from his pet bulldog. Appropriately enough, the hero's rich father is played by Tim Matheson, the former child actor who starred in Animal House and later became chief executive officer of the National Lampoon organisation, whose latest production this is.\n\nThe week's other two movies are passable horror films from Britain and Hong Kong. The better of the two, Rob Green's The Bunker, is set in a blockhouse and adjacent underground corridors on the border of Germany and Belgium in late 1944. As their occupants, exhausted members of the Wehrmacht, crack up, they become aware of some subterranean force threatening them. Are they being menaced by ghosts from long ago, psychological tricks performed by the advancing Americans or guilty memories of their own past? A capable cast of British actors eventually convince us they're Germans. This murky movie is well designed and edited, but it's inferior to Michael Mann's not dissimilar Second World War horror flick, The Keep."
