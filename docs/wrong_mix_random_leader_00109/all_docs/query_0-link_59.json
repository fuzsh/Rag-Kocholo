Evans, 91, of Galva, died at 1:55 p.m., Friday, July 12, 2024, at Toulon Rehabilitation and Health Care Center.\n\nHe was born Nov. 10, 1932, in LaFayette, the son of William and Lena (Shoff) Evans.

Likes on Oct. 13, 1961, in Altona and she preceded him in death on Dec. 27, 2020.\n\nSurvivors include his daughter, Gretchen (Shane) Hickman of Galva; his son Eric Evans of Altona; two grandchildren, Brooke (Aaron) Bachman of Annawan and Taylor (Eli) Beinke of Washington, D.C.; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; daughter-in-law, Tammy Lynn Evans; and half-brother, Bill Briggs.\n\nRichard graduated from LaFayette High School and served his country in the U.S. Army during the Korean Conflict.\n\nHe worked at Hyster in Kewanee until his retirement. He was also a Galva resident entrepreneur earning the name, “Trader Dick.”\n\nHe was a member of the Galva American Legion and especially enjoyed telling stories and, of course, visiting the junkyard.\n\nCremation will be accorded and graveside services will be held at 10 a.m., Friday, July 19, at Galva Cemetery where military rites will be accorded by the Galva Fusiliers. Memorials may be directed to the Galva American Legion Hagberg-Hamlin Post 45. Rux Funeral Home in Galva is in charge of arrangements.\n\nFrancis J. Waldinger\n\nGALVA – Francis “Frank” Joseph Waldinger, 83, of Bradford, Ill., passed away peacefully on July 15, 2024, at Genesis East Medical Center in Davenport, Iowa, after a brief illness.\n\nFrank was born on April 12, 1941, in Princeville, Ill., to Emilie (Lang) Waldinger and Franz Waldinger. He graduated from Bradford High School in 1959.\n\nAfter first noticing her at church on Aug. 15, 1961, Frank met up with Alice Parkin at a football game. They dated for two years before marrying on Aug. 10, 1963, at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Bradford.\n\nTogether, they had four children and farmed in Buda, Ill., for 41 years, raising corn, soybeans and hogs. He had the straightest rows of corn and the cleanest beanfields (with the help of his wife and children!) in Bureau County. Early in his farming career during the offseason, he also worked as a carpenter, building houses for Colgan Brothers Construction.\n\nFrank was a lively teller of jokes, and, if he could overcome his own laughter before he got to the punchline, his jokes were always funny.\n\nHe loved watching Jeopardy! with Alice, making sure to write down the final questions to quiz the kids and grandkids when they came to visit. He avidly solved crossword puzzles – often with the help of his friend, Siri. Frank also had an exceptional memory, recalling farming details, people’s names and sports facts like no one else while his family had to refer to Google just to join the conversation.\n\nHe was well known in his family for his witty, pithy sayings, including one that would always come after hearing of the deals and savings from shopping excursions: “You’re going to go broke saving money!”\n\nOne of Frank’s proudest moments came when his first grandchild, Ryan, was born on his birthday. They shared many special days together over the 27 years, often savoring a bunny cake Alice would bake for them.\n\nThose surviving to cherish his memory include his doting wife of nearly 61 years, Alice; his devoted children, Kyle Waldinger (Danielle Svetcov) of Corte Madera, Calif., Corey (Laura) Waldinger of Naperville, Ill., Cynthia (Todd) Carlson of Amboy, Ill., and Teresa Waldinger (Tom O’Connor) of North Aurora, Ill.; his adoring grandchildren, Charlotte and Jo Waldinger (Corte Madera, Ryan Waldinger (Chicago), Alex Waldinger (Nashville, Tenn.), Sarah Waldinger (Chicago), Emma Waldinger (Naperville) and Avery and Beckett O’Connor (North Aurora); his beloved siblings, Ginny (Ted) Gilles, Henry (Paulette) Waldinger, Ruth (Don) Stahl, Clarence (Kathy) Waldinger and Tom Waldinger; his amazing Parkin “out-laws”; and 36 dear nieces and nephews.\n\nFrank was preceded in death by his parents; his sister, Liz Code; his brother, Willie Waldinger; four brothers-in-law, Phil Code, Bill Hinkle, Rodger Woodley and Jim Parkin; and two nephews, Travis Parkin and Billy Hinkle.\n\nA visitation will be from 4-7 p.m. with the recitation of the rosary at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, at Grant-Johnson Funeral Home in Bradford. Mass of Christian Burial will be at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Bradford with Rev. John Thieryoung, officiating. Burial will immediately follow at St. John’s Cemetery.\n\nMemorials can be made to St. John’s Cemetery or to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nJohnathon L.

He ETS’d in November 2016 after 13 years of service in our nation’s defense.\n\nHe spent time working in maintenance at Gates Rubber Company and with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He most recently worked as a highway maintainer for the Peoria County Highway Department. He did his due diligence in maintaining the county roads and keeping them safe to travel for the last year and a half.\n\nJohn was a member of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association, Chapter 24-1, since 2021 and was most recently the newest committee member for the Red Ride of Central Illinois.\n\nJohn was a simple man. We all knew him for his tall masculine stature that was intimidating to those who didn’t know him. For those who were in his circle, his dedication to them was like no other. He took pride in working hard and providing for his family. His true love was Stephanie, his boys, his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and the Dallas Cowboys football team.\n\nCremation rites have been accorded.

While he was both athletically and academically gifted, his sense of work ethic was established at home on the farm where he helped his father. His academic pursuits took him to Bradley University where he achieved his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, which was the catalyst for his 39-year career at Caterpillar Inc.\n\nHe demonstrated consistent excellence in his career and was an ever-present loving husband and father. He and his wife, Joyce, spent their years in partnership; building a home and home-educating all four of their children, but most importantly, as a team, worshiping God in the everyday.\n\nAlan is survived by his wife, Joyce; their four children Rachel (Bradley) Schmoyer, David (Angela) Dremann, Hannah (Daniel) Watson and Sarah (Benjamin) Swenor; and nine grandchildren.\n\nAlan is also survived by his father, Ivan Dremann, though he was preceded by his mother, Lois. He is also survived by his siblings Nancy Leichty, Herb Dremann, Mary King and Janet Farra along with their families.\n\nAlan’s love of Christ his Savior came first, followed by his persistent and sacrificial love of his family. He was characterized by a love of dry and absurd humor which enlivened many dinners at home and get-togethers with friends. His perseverance and steadfastness was inexhaustible whether at work, at home, or most important, in his faith. His ability to hold firm to truth was a gift that strengthened those around him. His joy in life and wisdom was shared by all he knew. The lack of his earthly presence will be a chasm in our lives, but our joy and hope is in the promise of life eternal though Jesus Christ our Lord. Oh, what a Love the Father has for us.\n\nAlan’s family was to be present at Bethany Baptist Church for a visitation on Friday, July 5th from 4-7 p.m. and again on July 6th from 10-11 a.m. with a funeral service to follow at 11 a.m..

Rosenberg\n\nCRYSTAL LAKE – Vicky Lynn Rosenberg (née Bloomberg) died June 6, 2024, at Advocate Christ Medical Center after years of valiantly fighting both heart failure and breast cancer. She was 76.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 54 years, James Rosenberg; their two daughters, Amanda (Whit) Chaiyabhat and Katherine (Kirk) Douglas; her sister Tracy (Charlie) Jaco; six grandchildren; her niece Rachel Bloomberg; and nephews Donovan and Dustin Jaco.\n\nVicky was born in Kewanee on May 3, 1948, to parents Richard Bloomberg and Mildred Scott. Vicky was the first of three Bloomberg girls, big sister to Gail Bloomberg and Tracy Jaco. As a child, she lived a rural life in Toulon, Ill., some of it on a farm. She often lamented the hour-long bus rides to and from school and decided she wanted to raise her family in a larger town.\n\nShe got her wish after she began attending Illinois State University where she met Jim Rosenberg. The couple was married Nov. 22, 1969, and the following year Jim accepted a teaching position at Crystal Lake Central High School and the couple moved to the northwest Chicago suburb, where they made their home the remainder of her life. Later Vicky would finish her studies at Northern Illinois University, from which she graduated with a bachelor of science in education in 1971.\n\nShe gave birth to her first child, Mandi, at the age of 30, on Mother’s Day 1977. Three years later the family welcomed Kate.\n\nAn ever-dedicated mother, she chose her jobs and the location of their home specifically to maximize time together as a family. The girls could walk to all of their schools from K to 12 and they never came home to an empty house – in fact, most friends who visited the girls after school were met with delicious homemade baked goods. She loved to cook for her family to show her love, which she continued to do even throughout her illness. Not a single special occasion ever passed without a special meal, treat, or a thoughtful gift or card sent cross country.\n\nHer first professional job was working as a teller at Home State Bank but she also spent time working at Thunderbird Nursery School while her girls were enrolled and volunteered at Husmann Elementary School. She then worked as a librarian at the Fox River Grove Children’s Library, where she frequently took the girls on the weekends. She later worked as an assistant librarian at McHenry County College, which her daughters also attended, until she retired.\n\nAlthough she wasn’t a natural traveler, with Jim by her side she pushed herself out of her comfort zone so the pair could see the world together. They traveled everywhere from Spain’s Canary Islands to Budapest, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Dublin, Prague and Krakow among countless other globe-trotting adventures. When her daughters were young the family also took multiple vacations each year, driving all across America (with the girls bickering in back).\n\nOnce they were grown, she also made frequent visits to see her children as they moved around the country to places including Washington D.C., Arizona, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, California, Texas and Florida. She witnessed the birth of all six of her grandchildren: Mackenzie Chaiyabhat (19), Carter Chaiyabhat (18), Kayleigh Chaiyabhat (15), Cameron Chaiyabhat (6) and twins Alexandria and Andrew Douglas (9).\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Dick and Millie Bloomberg and her sister Gail Bloomberg – the mention of whom as she was gravely ill made Vicky smile for the last time; she was at peace thinking of reuniting with her sister in heaven.\n\nFierce, pragmatic, logical and determined, Vicky was always athletic, strong and capable. She played basketball in high school and took jujitsu classes as a young wife. She handled home renovations including demolition and building a deck on her own. She wasn’t often openly emotional, which belied the fact she was the most loving and thoughtful person you’d ever encounter. Of the grief we all are feeling, she would offer the warmest of hugs, a kiss on the cheek and simply say, “This too shall pass.”\n\nVisitation will be held from 4-8 p.m. on Friday, June 14, 2024, at Querhammer and Flagg Funeral Home, 500 W Terra Cotta Ave, Crystal Lake, IL 60014.\n\nAgnes E.

Her childhood was spent on a farm near Greybull, Wyo. Fran attended the University of Wyoming, studying business. She married Merrill H. Johnson on Nov. 9, 1948.\n\nThe couple lived in Wyoming and built their family, as Merrill worked for the railroad. For several years they resided in Worland, Wyo., while Merrill worked for the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company, until he was transferred to Peoria in 1962. Here Fran found a home with her family for the rest of her days. She never lost her connection to Wyoming and the mountains.\n\nMerrill and Fran used their “spare time” to start and run a custom home-building business named HarVeMer Builders. The homes they built are scattered about the Peoria area, a legacy to this day. Fran became a self-taught draftsperson and office manager for the business. Her creativity, artistry and intellect touched every facet of the business from the blueprints to the finished homes.\n\nIn her leisure time Fran loved to sew and was a volunteer for many years at the Methodist Hospital gift shop, making beautiful items to raise money for the hospital foundation. She always took her sewing machine on vacations to Wyoming, where many a summer was spent in the Big Horn Mountains, at the family cabin built by Merrill’s father. Here she also enjoyed hiking, jeeping and relaxing in the company of numerous friends and family who still resided in the Wyoming area. All her life Fran was an avid reader, even in her later years routinely reading the Peoria Journal Star cover to cover.\n\nFran’s husband, Merrill, passed July 9, 2015. She is survived by her four children and their spouses, Donald Johnson and Celia (Thompson) Johnson of Brimfield, Ill., David Johnson and Julie (Morrison) Johnson of Plainfield, Ill., Merilyn Kearney (Johnson) of North Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Sheri Beintema (Johnson) and Terry Beintema of Brimfield.
