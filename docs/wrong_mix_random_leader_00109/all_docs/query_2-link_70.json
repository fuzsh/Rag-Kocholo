        "text": "New Jersey earthquake calls attention to ancient, potentially unmapped fault lines\n\nThe fault that ruptured beneath New Jersey on Friday morning was likely an ancient, sleeping seam in the Earth, awakened by geologic forces in a region where earthquakes are rare and seismic risks are not fully understood.\n\nThe magnitude-4.8 earthquake was the strongest in New Jersey in over 200 years. As the shaking calmed on Friday, scientists began working to pinpoint where exactly the rupture occurred.\n\n“This is a region with many older faults that may be reactivated at any time. At this time, the fault that caused the earthquake isn’t yet known,” said Jessica Jobe, a USGS research geologist.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAt least a dozen aftershocks reported since morning quake\n\nand\n\nThere have been at least a dozen aftershocks following this morning’s earthquake, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist said.\n\nThough they can revive fear triggered by the initial temblor, they can also serve as reminders of the decreasing possibility a larger quake will strike, geophysicist Timothy Clements said.\n\n\"The likelihood of larger earthquake happening is going down with time,\" said Clements, a California-based former Harvard earth and planetary science researcher.\n\nToday's aftershocks include the 4.0 magnitude temblor just before 6 p.m. and at least 11 others, which registered at least magnitude 1.8 on the Richter scale, Clements said.\n\nThere may have been more aftershocks, but they were not detected if they were under magnitude 1.8, he said.\n\nEarthquakes near the epicenter are considered an aftershock for a year or up to five years, Clements said. Shakers away from the epicenter can be considered their own quakes.\n\nAnd anything with a larger magnitude in the same location will be its own earthquake, and today's 4.8-magnitude quake will be redesignated as a foreshock, according to the USGS.\n\nVideo: Statue of Liberty shakes during earthquake\n\nEarthCam video footage shows the Statue of Liberty trembling during the earthquake this morning.\n\n'No reports of significant damage,' N.Y. governor says following aftershock\n\nAftershock felt in New York and New Jersey\n\nA 4.0-magnitude aftershock was recorded this afternoon, triggering a fresh wave of social media posts.\n\nAccording to the USGS, the 4.0-magnitude temblor occurred 4.3 miles southwest of Gladstone, New Jersey, at 5:59 p.m. ET.\n\nShortly after, Gov. Phil Murphy said on X that New Jersey \"just experienced an aftershock.\"\n\nNew York City Emergency Management said it “experienced shaking in our facility” around that time.\n\nThe Empire State Building seemed to notice the shaking as well.\n\nThe pictures didn’t even rattle: Earthquake veterans say they are unfazed\n\nAs those in the New York tri-state area attempt to make sense of the 4.8-magnitude earthquake that rumbled residents on Friday morning, many transplants from quake-prone areas aren’t processing the rare temblor with the same degree of shock.\n\nMany whose loved ones are from Taiwan, which just experienced a massive 7.4-magnitude quake, as well as those from California, where the seismic events are a regular occurrence, weren’t fazed by the tremor that shook parts of the East Coast.\n\n“As someone who’s from the West Coast, I was very much like, ‘Oh, this is an earthquake,’” said Cameron Kim, who hails from the Bay Area. “I didn’t hear the pictures on the wall rattle so for me, that’s usually a good indicator of how big the shake is.”\n\nHowever, after seeing confusion and uncertainty from those around them, several pointed out that the lack of government preparedness and safety instruction is undeniable.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nNew York City store wasted no time making 2024 earthquake T-shirts\n\nWhen the earthquake shook his New York City store this morning, Kerry Colley had an idea: Why not sell some merchandise to commemorate the event?\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, Colley said, he had tees for sale in his Upper West Side store, Big Frog Custom T-Shirts & More. The shirts, which read \"I SURVIVED THE NYC EARTHQUAKE\" and have today's date on them, immediately attracted attention on social media and brought in customers.\n\n\"We are a little slammed,\" Colley said in a phone interview Friday afternoon, adding that he has sold an estimated 100 shirts already.\n\nAnd customers aren't waiting to change into their new shirts, Colley said.\n\n\"We just had a guy that took a subway for 45 minutes, went in the bathroom and put the shirt on,\" he said.\n\nBig Frog was able to quickly print out the shirts on a garment printer that it has in-store, Colley said. They are selling for $10 each.\n\n\"We print on-demand,\" he said. \"We have not been able to keep up.\"\n\n'Everything started to shake': Reactions to 4.8 earthquake run gamut from mild surprise to outright shock\n\nSo yes, by West Coast standards, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake might not seem like something to get too ruffled about. A quick look at the memes dominating the internet the past few hours attest to that. But, for those in the tri-state area less accustomed to such rumblings, Friday’s unexpected turbulence still came as something of a jolt. A few people shared their experiences with NBC News.\n\n“Our whole home shook in New Jersey,” Jon Seiler said. “My kids were in their bedrooms. My son saw bobbleheads shaking. We were in the kitchen and felt it shaking. Everybody kind of ran to the center of the house, and we all kind of stood there not knowing what was going on.”\n\nSeiler added: “We felt it, it was a crazy noise, we thought first it was from outside. Thought that there was construction happening across the street ... maybe something dropped over there. We all just kind of stood in the center and kind of held on to a wall, and braced ourselves and kind of stood there. My kids’ hearts were racing, and it was a wild little moment. Unforgettable for the kids for sure.”\n\nNadine Rizzo was sitting at her desk when the earth started to move underneath her feet.\n\n“Everything started to shake. And I looked around and nobody moved, so I just went and kept working. And then, the phone blew up, and teams chat and Google and everybody, ‘Did you feel that, is everybody OK?’ And everybody seemed fine.”\n\n“I looked out of the office and nobody moved, nobody flinched, nobody — everybody just kept working! Another day in New York City!”\n\nChristine O’Brien was on a New Jersey Transit train to NYC when the quake occurred and she suddenly started getting alerts from her family and neighbors. “They said in Hopewell, New Jersey, near Princeton, that it felt like thunder coming up from the ground. A few things falling off shelves and then it just stopped. Some people ran out of their homes, just not recognizing what else to do. Because in New Jersey, we are really not prepped for earthquakes.”\n\n“We don’t really practice like our brethren out in California to find a door frame or a bathtub or get under your desk,” O’Brien said. “So, I think it took everybody by surprise.”\n\nElaine Basinger was sitting in a rocking chair when the ground started to shake.\n\n“And then, it seemed like the walls were kind of shaking also. I knew right away it was an earthquake,” she said. “I’ve lived through shocks like in visiting different places, like Chile.”\n\nEarthquake was strongest to hit East Coast since 2011\n\nThe magnitude-4.8 earthquake that shook the Northeast this morning was the strongest earthquake to hit the East Coast since a 5.8-magnitude quake struck Virginia in 2011.\n\nThat earthquake forced evacuations of buildings in New York; Washington, D.C.; and other cities, and it disrupted air and train traffic across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. Parts of the Pentagon, White House and U.S. Capitol were among the areas evacuated. The Washington Monument was damaged as a result.\n\nPeople near quake's center describe 'loud roaring'\n\nResidents near the quake's center recalled the moment the 4.8-magnitude temblor hit this morning.\n\nAmy Hoffman, 23, of Lebanon, was in her room getting ready for work when, she said, her house started to shake and she heard a \"really loud\" sound.\n\n“When my house initially started to shake, I actually thought it was a helicopter flying overhead,” she said. “A couple of pictures fell off my wall and it felt like it lasted forever.”\n\nDaniyal Khan, 21, lives just minutes away from the epicenter in Califon.\n\n“I was sitting upright in bed when a loud roaring started all around me,” he said, adding that lightweight items started rattling on his desk.\n\nKhan texted his friends, who confirmed they felt the rumbling, too.\n\n“It was pretty surreal, as nothing like this has happened in the 15 years I’ve lived here,” he said.\n\nThe earthquake didn’t appear to damage Khan's home.\n\n“I mostly found myself laughing at how strange it all was. Just two days ago there was a huge storm. And in three days, there’s a total eclipse,” he said.\n\nUSGS funding for seismic monitoring network in Northeast lapsed years ago\n\nA monitoring network that could help researchers pinpoint the exact location and nature of today's earthquake was not operating at full capacity when the quake struck.\n\nFelix Waldhauser, a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said that the USGS in 2019 cut funding for the system, known as the Lamont-Doherty Cooperative Seismographic Network. The network once had 45 stations collecting seismic data across the Northeast, but it's now down to about 20 operational stations, Waldhouser said.\n\n“In an ideal world, we would have our network running and recording data and analyzing the data, figuring out where exactly the event was,” he said. “But we were cut off from funding for our network here.”\n\nThe Ramapo fault zone, where researchers think the earthquake took place, is difficult to interpret. It was not immediately clear which specific fault line the earthquake ruptured on.\n\n“The fault zone itself is complicated and not well understood, mainly because we don’t get many earthquakes,” Waldhauser said. “The instrument coverage we have here is not very good.\"\n\nHe added that he is trying to round up colleagues to deploy seismometers around the epicenter of the earthquake, near Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, to record aftershocks, which could help identify the main fault line.\n\n“We’re trying to get people together. I’m not sure if it’s going to happen,” he said.\n\nHowever, Dara Goldberg, a USGS geophysicist, said a dense local network of equipment would be most important for monitoring smaller earthquakes, determining the epicenter of an earthquake and conducting detailed science after an event.\n\n“Anything in the magnitude 4 range, we can determine in a global set of stations,” Goldberg said. “For the size of earthquakes relevant to society and people’s daily lives, we can do a fine job without that density.”\n\nEarthquake interrupts U.N. Security Council meeting in NYC\n\nThe chief executive of the nonprofit organization Save The Children was briefing an emergency Security Council session this morning on Gaza when things at the meeting got shaky — literally.\n\nAs Janti Soeripto spoke, meeting attendees looked around the room and at each other. Today's earthquake was making the room at the United Nations headquarters in New York City shake.\n\nSoeripto paused.\n\n\"Is that an earthquake?\" she asked.\n\n\"You're making the ground shake!\" someone quipped back.\n\nUSGS: More earthquakes, aftershocks possible\n\nMore earthquakes could hit the New Jersey area in the coming weeks, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nSara McBride, a research social scientist with the USGS, said that at least two aftershocks have been reported so far following this morning’s magnitude-4.8 quake. She said USGS researchers’ aftershock forecasts suggests there is a small chance of an even stronger earthquake in the coming weeks.\n\n“There’s a 3% chance for one or four aftershocks larger than a magnitude-5 in the coming weeks. A larger than magnitude-5 can be damaging,” McBride said.\n\nShe explained that the aftershock forecast is calculated using statistical data from thousands of past earthquakes of similar size. It’s a generic model, and not specific to the New Jersey region.\n\nJessica Jobe, a USGS research geologist, said there have been at least three magnitude-5 earthquakes in the region since the 1700s.\n\n“This is a region with many older faults that may be reactivated at any time at this time. The fault that causes the earthquake isn’t yet known,” she said.\n\nCounty at quake's center ‘very fortunate’ there isn’t more damage, official says\n\nThe New Jersey county where the earthquake struck this morning has sustained some structural damage to private property but has received no reports of injuries so far, according to officials.\n\nThe magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck near Lebanon shortly before 10:30 a.m. ET and was followed by two aftershocks, Brayden Fahey, Hunterdon County’s Office of Emergency Management coordinator, said at a news conference.\n\nAuthorities are assessing the damage and do not yet have a sense of how many properties may have been affected. But there have not been reports of any issues with gas or other utility lines, officials said.\n\n\"I think all of us collectively were jarred by what we experienced,\" Fahey said. “All of us probably feel very fortunate that there’s not more damage and more issues facing us.\"\n\nHaitians on the East Coast share traumatic responses from the earthquake\n\nShortly after the earthquake, Faces Of Haiti, a social media account for Haitian people, posted that the tremors might “bring severe PTSD in the following days” for those who experienced the devastatingly deadly quake in 2010. “Keep checking on your loved ones’ mental health in the Tri-State area, even when they say they are ok.”\n\nAlmost immediately, followers shared their experiences this morning as the earthquake rippled down the East Coast.\n\n“Thank you for this. I was the first in my workplace to understand what was happening, and I’m the last one to be over it,” one person wrote in a comment on the post. “Still shaking typing this.”\n\n\"you and I both,\" another user responded. \"I screamed right away, ‘It’s an earthquake, it’s an earthquake, guys,’ and my coworkers were calm about it and didn’t say anything. My heart was racing, and I was thinking about the nearest exit. Nahhhhh. We don’t play that over here. I had enough in 2010. Whatever the magnitude is, I’m traumatized for life.”\n\n“Thank you for acknowledging and sharing this message,\" one person wrote. \"Haiti was the first image in my mind once I realized what I was experiencing as everything around me was shaking/rattling.”\n\n“My sisters called me crying and scared,” said another.\n\nIn 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, leaving its capital, Port-au-Prince, in ruins. An estimated 220,000 people were killed, some 300,000 people were injured, and 1.3 million lost their homes during the 35-second temblor.\n\nAt least one aftershock reported\n\nThe earth shook for a second time this morning.\n\nThough it was subtle, a second earthquake hit the New Jersey area at about 11:20 a.m., according to U.S. Geological Survey data.\n\nThe aftershock registered as a magnitude 2.0. It was roughly 4 miles west of Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nConnecticut emergency officials say no major damage or injuries reported\n\nThere have been no major damage or injuries reported in the state in today's earthquake, Connecticut emergency officials said during a news conference this afternoon.\n\nHowever, officials are still working with state agencies to ensure there are no threats to buildings or critical infrastructure. Deputy Commissioner Brenda Bergeron said that the state's Transportation Department is also doing visual inspections of bridges and critical infrastructure critical bridge infrastructure \"in an abundance of caution.\"\n\n\"We are not seeing any significant damage but we are in partial activation and continuing to work with our state local, federal and private sector partners on making sure that everyone is safe and sound,\" Bergeron said.\n\nNo power outages or damage detected, N.J. utility says\n\nNo power outages or damage have been detected in connection with today’s quake, according to PSE&G, the energy utility that serves New Jersey.\n\nThe company said it completed initial system inspections of its electric infrastructure.\n\n“As part of our earthquake response protocol, we are currently performing a strategic system check of our electric and natural gas infrastructure near the epicenter, Tewksbury,” PSE&G said. “The safety of our customers and employees is the number one priority.”\n\nBill Nye: 4.8-magnitude earthquake is ‘unusual’ for Atlantic coast\n\nA 4.8-magnitude earthquake on the Atlantic coast is \"a little unusual, but it happens from time to time,\" science educator Bill Nye told MSNBC.\n\n\"It just shows you everybody the importance of being prepared,\" he said.\n\nNye encouraged people to secure their cabinet doors and keep flashlights, food and water on hand in case of an electricity outage.\n\nNo increase in ER volume, NYC hospital system says after quake\n\nAll NYC Health + Hospitals facilities are operating normally, the system said in a post on X.\n\n\"All our patients & staff are safe, and we are not seeing an increase in volume at our emergency departments,\" the hospital added in the post.\n\n25 adults, 3 children evacuated after quake-related structural damage in N.J.\n\nStructural damage at multiple addresses led to evacuations in Newark, New Jersey, the city's public safety director said.\n\nWhile the epicenter of the earthquake was more than 30 miles away from Newark, firefighters responded to 313, 315 and 317 7th Avenue, which were impacted by the quake, Fritz Fragé said.\n\n\"As a result of this incident, 10 families, comprising 25 adults and three children, have been relocated from these buildings,\" he added.\n\nAll city buildings, including City Hall and recreation centers, are closed. The closures do not affect police and fire facilities.\n\n\"The city is currently inspecting buildings for any potential damage and power outages,\" Fragé said.\n\nJetBlue says flights resumed, expect ‘a small number of delays’\n\nJetBlue said flights have resumed after the FAA issued brief ground stops at some New York area airports.\n\n“We expect mostly normal operations to continue with a small number of delays as a result of a pause in air traffic control operations,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey said there were flight disruptions as of this afternoon, and advised people to check their flight status with their individual airlines.\n\nDelta Air Lines said that it was also experiencing minor departure delays, but did not anticipate cancellations.\n\nLive radio show captures moment earthquake hit Philadelphia\n\nThis morning’s earthquake was captured live on Philadelphia’s 93.3 WMMR radio show, “The Preston & Steve Show.”\n\nThe show shared footage from its Philadelphia office at 10:23 a.m. ET, showing mic booms shaking.\n\n“Did you feel the room shake?” co-host Kathy Romano asked.\n\n“Are we having an earthquake?” another host, Nick McIlwain, asked.\n\n“You’re right. I feel my butt kind of moving a little bit. Look at my microphone, it was waggling a little bit there,” host Preston Elliot said.\n\nCo-host Steve Morrison wondered if it could have been construction going on in the building.\n\nThen the hosts started reading texts from friends and messages sent in to the show confirming it was an earthquake felt well beyond the city.\n\n\"That's the second earthquake I've ever felt,\" Elliot said.\n\n'I don't want to die': Video captures moment quake terrified N.J. coffee shop patrons\n\nSurveillance video from a coffee shop in Boonton, New Jersey, about 35 miles southwest of the earthquake's epicenter, shows customers' terrified reactions as the quake hit. Many rush out of Boonton Coffee Co. in one video and another clip shows a young girl yelling, \"I don't want to die!\"\n\nDelta Air Lines reports two diverted flights and minor departure delays\n\nDelta Air Lines flights are moving normally, a spokesperson said, with the exception of two flights bound for Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, which were diverted elsewhere.\n\nThe airline is experiencing \"some minor departure delays but we expect to absorb those without any cancelation effect at this time,\" said Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesperson.\n\nThe company has not received any reports of damage or injuries, he added.\n\nNewark airport reported flight disruptions on Friday afternoon.\n\n“Please check with your airline to determine the status of your flight,” the airport said in a statement on X.\n\nMajor museums say no damage so far\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History said it has not identified any damage to museum artifacts, but is doing a full inspection.\n\nThe Guggenheim Museum has not sustained any damages or interruptions to museum operations, either.\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) said it’s operating as usual.\n\n“Our security staff and engineers have conducted facilities wide patrols and found no damage to MoMA’s infrastructure. Registrar, art handling, and conservation teams have reported no issues seen in the galleries, conservation labs, or art storage,\" the museum said in a statement.\n\nMaggie Fairs, vice president of external affairs for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, said the museum has protections in place for events such as earthquakes.\n\n\"There was no damage to the artwork at the museum from today’s earthquake,\" Fairs said. \"As you can imagine with the collection such as ours, safeguards are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of the museum’s art collection.\"\n\n'There is a known earthquake risk in New Jersey,' FEMA says\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency's Region 8 said there is a known earthquake risk in New Jersey, according to a post on X.\n\n\"While many folks may have been caught off guard by the #earthquake in New Jersey on Friday, you may be surprised to know there is a known earthquake risk in that area,\" the post read.\n\n'My house shook for 45' seconds, N.J. resident says\n\nMonica Hlinka, who lives in Whitehouse Station, near the epicenter of this morning’s earthquake, said her “whole house shook for 45 seconds.”\n\nHlinka was working from home when she thought \"something hit my house.\"\n\n\"It just kept going. The house just kept shaking,\" she told NBC News. \"I was looking around my office, things were falling off my shelves, books were falling off, pictures frames.\"\n\n\"I've never experienced anything like that and it was insane to say the least,\" she added.\n\nHlinka said that she felt another temblor last month — a 2.2-magnitude quake on March 15 centered north, northeast of Whitehouse Station.\n\n\"When that occurred, it felt like something really big had fallen in my house, When it happened today, I thought the same thing was happening but then it just kept happening and I was like, OK, this is actually an earthquake.\"\n\nThe hashtags “earthquake,” “epicenter,” and “NY and NJ” were trending on X today with locals through the tri-state area freaking out over the quake.\n\nNYC schools chancellor: Students safe, no reports of damage to schools\n\nAll students in New York City's public schools are safe after the earthquake, and there are no reports of structural damage to any schools, said David Banks, New York City's public schools chancellor.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference along with NYC Mayor Eric Adams and emergency management officials, Banks said that \"at this moment, there is no indication that any of our buildings were compromised.\"\n\nHe praised facilities staff for quickly and thoroughly inspecting school buildings and said parents do not need to pick their children up early from school. Principals have been instructed to hold regular dismissals and after-school programs will operate normally.\n\nBanks encouraged parents to not be anxious.\n\n\"We ask the school staff and families to remain calm and to model that for all of our students,\" he said.\n\nUSGS expert explains how geology of Northeast affects intensity of earthquakes\n\nWhile earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, when they do strike, they are felt widely, said William Yeck, a research geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n“Because of the geology of the region, the seismic waves propagate much further, so people can feel them further away,” Yeck said.\n\nMTA says no damage to infrastructure\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which provides bus, subway and commuter rail service in greater New York, said it was business as usual as of this afternoon.\n\n\"MTA services are operating safely and normally following the 4.8 magnitude earthquake felt throughout our region this morning,\" it posted on X. \"Initial inspections show there was no damage to any MTA infrastructure, but we will continue to monitor the situation closely. Thank you for riding with us.\"\n\nWhere is New Jersey's governor?\n\nGov. Phil Murphy is not in New Jersey today, according to his public schedule.\n\nThe New Jersey governor was scheduled to depart the state yesterday for a Democratic Governors Association meeting. He is set to return tomorrow morning, according to his public schedule.\n\nHowever, Murphy did speak with President Joe Biden today about the earthquake, according to a statement from the White House. The White House added that Biden is in touch with state and local officials and will provide assistance if needed.\n\nWhile Murphy is away, Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way is serving as acting governor, the schedule noted.\n\n'New Yorkers should go about their normal day,' NYC mayor says\n\nThere have been no reports of major impacts to infrastructure or injuries so far in New York City from the earthquake, Mayor Eric Adams and emergency management officials said at a news conference this afternoon.\n\nWhile aftershocks are possible, \"New Yorkers should go about their normal day,\" Adams said. \"First responders are working to make sure the city is safe.\"\n\nOfficials encouraged everyone to check in on their loved ones and neighbors to make sure everyone is OK. The likelihood of aftershocks at this point is low, but if you feel one, drop to the floor and cover your head and neck, officials said.\n\nAdams said that because earthquakes don't happen frequently in the area, \"this can be extremely traumatic for New Yorkers.\" But, he added: \"We are ready for the unexpected. This is New York City and we responded accordingly.\"\n\nPrinceton seismologist says quake's shallow depth made it feel strong\n\nThis morning's earthquake occurred on a shallow fault system in New Jersey and shook for about 35 seconds, a Princeton seismologist said.\n\n“The shallower or the closer it is, the more we feel it as humans,” said Frederik J. Simons, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University.\n\nThe quake originated at a depth of less than 3 miles, according to USGS.\n\nEarthquakes on the East Coast can be felt at a great distance and can cause more pronounced shaking in comparison to those on the West Coast because rocks in the region are often older, harder and more dense.\n\n“These are competent rocks that transmit energy well,” Simons said.\n\nThe earthquake ruptured on the Ramapo fault system, he said. The system is relatively old and considered mostly tectonically inactive. It's at a boundary where the continental and oceanic tectonic plates meet and are stuck together. The plates grind against one another slowly and accumulate stress until something slips.\n\n“There are cracks in it and now and then a little motion accumulates, the stress keeps growing, at very slow rates,” Simons said. “It’s like an old house creaking and groaning.”\n\nHe said this was one of the largest earthquakes in New Jersey in recent history. The last notable one was a magnitude-3.1 temblor in Freehold Township in September 2020.\n\n“I’m on campus at Princeton University for the biggest one I’ve felt in a lifetime,” he said. “This shaking was violent, strong and long.”\n\nWATCH: Video shows the moment earthquake struck New Jersey\n\nVideos circulating online appear to show the moment today's quake hit the East Coast.\n\nIn one, a man recording himself playing his guitar captured the moment the quake hit.\n\nUnfazed Long Island electrician says ‘back to work’ after experiencing quake\n\nA Long Island electrician said he was working when the earthquake struck.\n\n\"I just felt like we were close to where a train was, like a railroad,\" he said. \"You know, just shaking in the legs. That's about it. We didn't really think much of it.\"\n\nThe electrician said he planned to \"get back to work,\" after the quake, adding that he wasn't even sure it was an earthquake until after he received a text confirming the area had been hit by one.\n\nHochul says no reports of damage, assessment teams still out\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state hasn't felt an earthquake of today's magnitude since 2011, calling it one of the biggest to shake the East Coast in the last century.\n\n\"We’re taking this extremely seriously and here’s why. There’s always the possibility of aftershocks,\" she said.\n\nStructural and damage assessment teams are checking bridges, state roads, major transmission lines and dams and thus far \"we haven’t identified any life-threatening situations.\" The state has also been in contact with utility companies, cell service companies and hospitals and all systems appear to be running as normal.\n\nShe noted that while there may be general anxiety in the wake of the Taiwan 7.4-magnitude earthquake this week, today's 4.8 temblor was significantly smaller and weaker.\n\nHolland Tunnel closed briefly for inspections\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed the Holland Tunnel briefly today for inspections following the earthquake.\n\nThe tunnel was closed at about 11 a.m. ET and the PANYNJ announced its reopening on X at about 11:15 a.m. ET.\n\nThe agency said that all lanes were again open for passage through the tunnel and no damage was reported in the tunnel.\n\nToday's earthquake is the strongest to hit N.J. in almost 250 years\n\nThe earthquake that rumbled this morning was the strongest in almost 250 years and the third-strongest for the state in 280 years of record-keeping.\n\nThe only two stronger ones were a 5.2-magnitude quake in 1737 and a 5.3 temblor in 1783, according to state data.\n\nDelays should be expected, Amtrak says\n\nAmtrak customers should expect delays in the wake of today's quake, the company said.\n\n\"Amtrak regrets any inconvenience,\" the company added in a statement on its website and on its social media accounts.\n\nEast Coast earthquake felt as far north as New England\n\nReports to the U.S. Geological Survey and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre suggest that people felt the shaking as far north as New England, including northern parts of Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nNo phone outages after the quake, Verizon and AT&T say\n\nand\n\nBoth Verizon and AT&T say their networks are running without interruption following the earthquake.\n\nVerizon said there have been no reported problems with phone services or on stores or employees, while AT&T said its wireless network is \"operating normally in areas affected by the earthquake.\"\n\nHow to stay safe during an earthquake\n\nFlying debris is a major source of injury during an earthquake. Here are some of the best ways to protect yourself during a quake, according to Ready.gov, a U.S. government-run site that helps people prepare for and respond to emergencies and disasters:\n\nStay where you are. If you are inside when the shaking starts, stay indoors and resist the urge to run outside. Avoid doorways. If you are outside, stay away from buildings. If you are driving, pull over and set your parking brake.\n\nDrop, cover and hold on. Wherever you are, drop to your hands and knees to best protect your vital organs and hold onto something sturdy. Then, cover your head and neck with your arms. If there is a sturdy table or desk nearby, crawl underneath it for shelter. Finally, hold onto the table or desk with one hand and be ready to move with it if it moves during the shaking.\n\nIf you use a wheelchair or walker, lock your wheelchair or walker wheels and cover your head and neck with your hands.\n\nBe prepared for aftershocks. Be ready to drop, cover and hold on should there be any aftershocks immediately following the earthquake.\n\nBe ready for future quakes or other emergencies. Make an emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact on it. Plan where you will meet loved ones if you get separated. And have a supply kit that includes several days' worth of food and water, a flashlight, a fire extinguisher and a whistle.\n\nNo reports of structural damage or service disruptions to NYC transit\n\nThe New York City Police Department’stransit chief said there are \"no current reports of any structural damage and/or service disruptions to the NYC Transit system\" from the earthquake.\n\nThe transit team is surveying all lines and stations.\n\nUnited says a few flights diverted from Newark\n\nUnited Airlines said it has diverted a few flights from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after the Federal Aviation Administration put ground stops there.\n\n“We’re monitoring the air travel situation after the East Coast earthquake today.
