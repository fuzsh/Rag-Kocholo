        "text": "Hysterical investigates a mysterious illness that spreads among a group of high school girls in upstate New York. What is causing their sudden, often violent symptoms? Is there something in the water or inside the school? Or is it “all in their head?” The series examines the outbreak in LeRoy, NY, believed by some to be the most severe case of mass hysteria since the Salem Witch Trials. In his search for answers, Dan Taberski (9/12, Missing Richard Simmons, Running from Cops) explores other seemingly inexplicable events of the last few years – CIA officers being crippled with nausea and vertigo; cops OD'ing from exposure to fentanyl – and discovers they’re far more connected than we realize.\n\nFrom Wondery and Pineapple Street Studios, this 7-part series forces us to grapple with the mysteries of our own minds, and reckon with a contagion that we thought was long dead, but may be the defining disorder of our time.\n\nFollow Hysterical on the Wondery App or wherever you get your podcasts. You can binge all episodes of Hysterical early and ad-free right now by joining Wondery+ at Wondery.fm/Hysterical_Morbid.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nWhen Peter Smart failed to show up for work on the morning of January 6, 1958, officers in Lanarkshire, Scotland were dispatched to Smart’s home to conduct a well-being check. When no one came to the door, the officers forced their way inside, where they found Smart, his wife, and their eleven-year-old son all dead from gunshot wounds to the head. A week later, Peter Manuel was arrested and charged with the murders of the Smart family, but in time the police in Lanarkshire would learn that was only one of Manuel’s horrific crimes.\n\nThank you to the incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research!\n\nReferences\n\nBirmingham Post and Gazette. 1958. \"3 shot dead: no gun found.\" Birmingham Post and Gazette, January 7: 1.\n\nCoventry Evening Telegraph. 1956. \"Three dead in bungalow beds.\" Coventry Evening Telegraph, September 17: 1.\n\nDaily Record. 1956. \"Fifth tee murder.\" Daily Record, January 5: 1.\n\n—. 1956. \"Fifth tee murder: dramatic appeal.\" Daily Record, January 6: 1.\n\n—. 1957. \"Teenager vanishes.\" Daily Record, December 30: 1.\n\n—. 1958. \"Two sensations as trial opens.\" Daily Record, May 13: 7.\n\nDaily Telegraph. 1958. \"1958.\" Daily Telegraph, May 15: 15.\n\nEvening Sentinel. 1956. \"Bloodstains found on bed sheets.\" Evening Sentinel, September 17: 1.\n\n—. 1957. \"Tjhick snow hampers moors hunt.\" Evening Sentinel, December 11: 1.\n\nHull Daily Mail. 1957. \"Police seek fresh clues in murder mystery.\" Hull Daily Mail, December 10: 5.\n\nLundy, Iain. 2007. \"Psychopath who brought terror to the west.\" Evening Times, December 27.\n\nMacLeod, Hector. 2009.

Julia often travelled by herself on moment’s notice, so neighbors thought nothing of her absence; however, when several female body parts were discovered in the Thames, police uncovered a gruesome crime that not only involved theft and impersonation, but also the ghastly murder of Julia Martha Thomas.\n\nThomas’s maid, Kate Webster, was quickly arrested and charged with Julia’s murder. Through their investigation, detectives discovered that Thomas had recently given Webster notice of termination after only one month. Days before she was to leave Thomas’ home, Webster murdered her employer, then dismembered her body and posed as Julia in order to sell off the murdered woman’s belongings for a quick profit. Although she maintained her innocence, Kate Webster was tried, convicted, and executed for the crime, finally confessing her guilt just hours before she went to the gallows.\n\nThe ”Richmond Murder,” as it was dubbed by the press, captivated Londoners for months and Webster’s trial and execution became something of a public spectacle. In Victorian-era England, few people believed a woman capable of committing murder, much less dismemberment and rendering of a human body. Given that, and the shocking viciousness of the crime itself, the Richmond Murder remains one of London’s most notorious murders of the late nineteenth century.\n\nThank you to the incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research!\n\nReferences\n\nBirmingham Evening Mail. 1879. \"Solution of the Barnes mystery.\" Birmingham Evenign Mail, March 26: 3.\n\nBlake, Matt. 2011.

Patrica was nude and had been bludgeoned with a candelabra. Suspicion quickly fell on her estranged husband, Wayne Lonergan, who had fled the country to Canada, where he was serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nWayne Lonergan was apprehended a few days later and returned to New York, where he was charged with the murder and two days later confessed to killing Patricia in a jealous rage. Despite his confession, Lonergan’s case went to trial and quickly became one of the most sensational trials of the decade. While the murder itself was a terrible tragedy, the extensive press coverage and intense public interest was on Wayne’s sexual identity and the supposedly scandalous lives of the two high society figures at the center of the case.\n\nWayne was ultimately found guilty of the murder and served more than two decades in prison, after which he was deported back to Canada, where he resided until his death.

After talking his way past a guard, Whitman climbed to the twenty eighth floor of the campus clocktower and walked out onto the observation deck, then began firing at the people on the ground below. In the span of a just over an hour and half, Charles Whitman killed fifteen people and wounded thirty-one others before finally being shot and killed by a police officer who’d managed to make his way to the top of the tower. Investigators later learned that, prior to arriving on the UT campus, Whitman had also murdered his mother and his wife.\n\nIn 1966, mass shootings were virtually unheard of in the United States and Whitman’s spree killing shocked the nation. By most accounts, Charles Whitman was the picture of an all-American man, which made his actions all the more confusing. He was well-liked, had a successful military career, a beautiful wife, and once out of the military, he began pursuing a college degree in preparation for the next phase of his life. But behind the façade of American middle-class success lurked a deeply troubled man whose personal history and acute medical problems would eventually go a long way to explaining his actions on the morning of August 1.\n\nThank you to the incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research!\n\nReferences\n\nAustin American-Statesman. 1966. \"U.T. sniper shoots 33.\" Austin American-Statesman, August 1: 1.\n\nColloff, Pamela. 2006. \"96 minutes.\" Texas Monthly, August 1: 104.\n\n—. 2016. \"Memorial day.\" Texas Monthly, August 1: 22.\n\nFlemmons, Jerry. 1966. \"UT tower sniper kills 14, dies in hail of police gunfire.\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, August 2: 1.\n\nGovernor's Committee. 1966.

Gorrell had been shot in the head twice with his own gun and his wallet and other valuables were missing, leading police to conclude he had been killed in a botched robbery. Just one day later, the residents of Tulsa were shocked to learn that Gorrell hadn’t been killed by a robbery, but by his friend Phil Kennamer, and his motive wasn’t robbery.\n\nAt the peak of the Great Depression, newspaper reports of violent crime were nothing new. In this case, however, the victim was the son of a prominent local physician and his killer the son of a well-known US District Court judge. The privileged backgrounds of the victim and killer were enough to captivate the residents of Tulsa, but as the strange details of the story slowly emerged in the days that followed, the case quickly grew from local sensation to national fascination. In the weeks and months that followed, countless front pages (and then some) were dedicated to the lurid details of what the press soon dubbed the “Society Gang Killing;” a story of disaffected youth who, bored with their wealth and privilege, turned to crime and violence for the sake of entertainment and excitement.\n\nThank you to the incredible Dave White of Bring Me The Axe Podcast for Research!\n\nReferences\n\nBiscup, Walter. 1935. \"Verdict of jury leaves punishment of Gorrell's slayer to Judge Hurst.\" Tulsa World, February 22: 1.\n\nFrates, Kent. 2014. \"The Society Gang Killingg.\" This Land, July 15.\n\nFreese, Jim. 2016.

Though many would speculate as to the identity of perpetrator, including the theory that a single individual was responsible, many of these murders would remain unsolved and contribute to macabre urban legends that endure to this day. In New Orleans, however, the brutal axe murders of at least five Black families in 1911 and 1912 are attributed to Clementine Barnabet, an African American teenager who confessed to the crimes.\n\nDespite having confessed to as many as thirty-five murders, and having been convicted and incarcerated for one, the veracity of Barnabet’s claim has long been in doubt. Tried and convicted on very little evidence, Barnabet’s story changed many times following her arrest and eventually came to include sensational and highly questionable claims of her belonging to a Voodoo religious sect that engaged in human sacrifice. Not only were these claims unsupported by any real evidence, but they also suggested the girl may have been suffering from profound mental illness and had nothing whatsoever to do with the murders in and around New Orleans. But if Clementine Barnabet wasn’t the killer, why did she confess to such brutal, wicked crimes?\n\nThank you to the incredible Dave White or Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research!\n\nReferences\n\nCrowley Daily Signal. 1911. \"Brutal murder of negro family is discovered in West Crowley.\" Crowley Daily Signal, Janaury 26: 1.\n\n—. 1909. \"Rayne scene of brutal murder.\" Crowley Daily Signal, November 13: 1.\n\n—. 1911. \"Six murdered in Lafayette.\" Crowley Daily Signal, November 27: 1.\n\nCrowley Signal. 1911. \"Negro murderer was convicted.\" Crowley Signal, October 28: 5.\n\nFort Wayne News. 1912. \"Seventeen murders were confessed to.\" Fort Wayne News, October 25: 17.\n\nLafayette Advertiser. 1912. \"Clementine Barnabet sane.\" Lafayette Advertiser, October 22: 4.\n\n—. 1911. \"Horrible crime.\" Lafayette Advertiser, February 28: 1.\n\nMonroe News-Star. 1911. \"Butchery of human beings.\" Monroe News-Star, November 28: 1.\n\n—. 1912. \"Sacrifice sext slaughter 26.\" Monroe News-Star, January 23: 1.\n\nNew Iberia Enterprise and Independent Observer. 1913. \"Blood lust cut out of Clementine Barnabet.\" New Iberia Enterprise and Independent Observer, August 9: 1.\n\nOsborne, Jeffery. 2012.

The Gedeon’s had been separated for some time but had agreed to have dinner together as a family, which included their other daughter, Veronica, a moderately successful pulp magazine model. When they entered the apartment, it appeared as though no one was home; however, upon checking the bedroom where his daughter slept, Joseph Gedeon found the nude body of his daughter lying lifeless on the bed and immediately called the police.\n\nDuring an initial search of the apartment, investigators found the body of Mary Gedeon stuffed under her bed; like her daughter, she had been strangled to death. In a third bedroom, police also found the body of Mary’s boarder, Frank Byrnes, who’d been stabbed several times in the head and neck with a long, thin implement. There was no sign of a forced entry, no sign of a struggle, and nothing appeared to be missing from the apartment. Given that Veronica had been found nude, and Mary was clothed but her underwear had been torn away, investigators assumed the murders were a sex crime.\n\nStill caught in the grip of the Great Depression, New Yorkers welcomed anything that could distract from the unpleasant realities of daily life and the salacious murder of a pulp magazine model—a sex crime, no less—was exactly what they were looking for. The story dominated the press, as reporters and tabloid journalists dug into Veronica’s personal life and dating history and published lurid photos from her past. But when the killer was finally caught and the motive revealed, the story was far stranger and tragic than anyone had imagined.\n\nThank you to the wonderful David White of the Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research!\n\nReferences\n\nBrooklyn Daily Eagle. 1937. \"Cops question ex-lodger in triple murder.\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, March 29: 1.\n\n—. 1937. \"Doubts student is killer.\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 6: 1.\n\n—. 1938. \"Irwin's guilty plea.\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, November 15: 10.\n\nBuffalo Evening News. 1938. \"Irwin, ruled insane, sent to Dannemora.\" Buffalo Evening News, December 10: 1.\n\n2015.

During his interrogation, Hickman confessed to kidnapping and murdering Marion, claiming that a god he referred to as “Providence” had instructed him to do it. That confession prompted Hickman’s attorneys to take advantage of the state’s new law accepting a legal defense of not guilty by reason of insanity; however, a jury disagreed, and Hickman was found guilty and executed at San Quentin Prison the following year.\n\nBecause of the shocking cruelty and brutality of the murder, the well documented and exciting search for the killer, and the sensational nature of the defense, the story of Marion Parker’s murder and the trial that followed dominated the media and occupied several pages of all the major papers across the state for months. For these reasons and more, it remains one of the most notorious murders in California history.\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1928. \"Hickman to have new judge.\" Fresno Bee, January 25: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Confession stuns mother.\" Los Angeles Times, December 23: 4.\n\nBerger, Jackson. 1927. \"Kidnapper tries to dash out brains in frenzy.\" Los Angeles Times, December 25: 1.\n\nLos Angeles Record. 1927. \"Hunt kidnappers of girl.\" Los Angeles Record, December 16: 1.\n\nLos Angeles Times. 1927. \"'Fox' ponders 'crazy' plea.\" Los Angeles Times, December 24: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Fugitive caught in breakneck race with Oregon officers.\" Los Angeles Times, December 23: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Hickman believed in Seattle.\" Los Angeles Times, December 22: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Hickman pronounced sane.\" Los Angeles Times, December 24: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Hickman's finger-prints found in apartment.\" Los Angeles Times, December 21: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"'I liked her' declares youth while he sobs.\" Los Angeles Times, December 23: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Kidnapper grows sullen when 'pal' proves alibi.\" Los Angeles Times, December 24: 1.\n\n—. 1928. \"New crimes confessed by Hickman.\" Los Angeles Times, October 14: 3.\n\n—. 1928. \"New horror in Hickman case.\" Los Angeles Times, February 2: 1.\n\n—. 1928. \"Slayer makes self-analysis.\" Los Angeles Times, February 2: 2.\n\nNeibaur, James. 2016.

The man claimed Parker had been in an accident and he was to bring the girl to see her father, but this was just a ruse to abduct the girl. The following day, Marion’s parents received several cryptic ransom letters demanding $1,500 in gold in exchange for the safe return of their daughter. On December 17, Perry Parker delivered the money to the kidnapper, who took the money, then dumped Marion’s dead, mutilated body out of the car before speeding away.\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1928. \"Hickman to have new judge.\" Fresno Bee, January 25: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Confession stuns mother.\" Los Angeles Times, December 23: 4.\n\nBerger, Jackson. 1927. \"Kidnapper tries to dash out brains in frenzy.\" Los Angeles Times, December 25: 1.\n\nLos Angeles Record. 1927. \"Hunt kidnappers of girl.\" Los Angeles Record, December 16: 1.\n\nLos Angeles Times. 1927. \"'Fox' ponders 'crazy' plea.\" Los Angeles Times, December 24: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Fugitive caught in breakneck race with Oregon officers.\" Los Angeles Times, December 23: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Hickman believed in Seattle.\" Los Angeles Times, December 22: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Hickman pronounced sane.\" Los Angeles Times, December 24: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Hickman's finger-prints found in apartment.\" Los Angeles Times, December 21: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"'I liked her' declares youth while he sobs.\" Los Angeles Times, December 23: 1.\n\n—. 1927. \"Kidnapper grows sullen when 'pal' proves alibi.\" Los Angeles Times, December 24: 1.\n\n—. 1928. \"New crimes confessed by Hickman.\" Los Angeles Times, October 14: 3.\n\n—. 1928. \"New horror in Hickman case.\" Los Angeles Times, February 2: 1.\n\n—. 1928. \"Slayer makes self-analysis.\" Los Angeles Times, February 2: 2.\n\nNeibaur, James. 2016.

Agnes and her husband followed the girls into the nearby wooded area, where they found the badly beaten and obviously dead body of Honorah Parker. The couple wasn’t able to get much out of either girl, only that the woman had slipped and hit her head, but their behavior was strange and something about the whole scene didn’t feel right.\n\nJust two days later, Parker and Hulme were charged with the murder of Pauline’s mother, Honorah Parker. According to the prosecution, the girls had developed an intense bond and had created romantic fantasy in the months leading up to the murder that bordered on obsessiveness. In 1954, the girls’ relationship became threatened when Hulme’s parents divorced and began talking of relocating. Fearing they would be separated and never see one another again, Parker and Hulme killed Honorah, believing that her death would put an end to any plans to relocate.\n\nThe story of Honorah’s murder and the trial that followed quickly spread across New Zealand and Australia and eventually made its way around the globe. Among other things, the case challenged existing beliefs about young women and their capacity for violence, but just as important were the sensational and salacious mentions of insanity and homosexuality that were often more implied than explicitly stated.\n\nThank you to David White, of the Bring Me the Axe Podcast, for research :)\n\nReferences\n\nBrisbane Telegraph. 1954. \"Conspired to Kill.\" Brisbane Telegraph, August 23: 1.\n\n—. 1954. \"Teenagers remanded, police blame girl's passion for horses.\" Brisbane Telegraph, June 24: 1.\n\nChun, Louise. 1995. \"Slaughter by the innocents: The case of the schoolgirl killers shocked New Zealand.\" The Guardian, January 30.\n\nGraham, Peter. 2011.

Betty ran to a neighbor’s house to call 911, and police arrived at the Wilson’s house a short time later to secure the scene.\n\nAt first, investigators agreed with Betty’s theory that Jack had surprised a burglar and was then killed. The problem, however, was that nothing appeared to have been taken, nor did it appear that the house had been ransacked. A few days later, a tip led detectives to James White, who quickly confessed that he murdered Jack Wilson at the request of Betty and her twin sister, Peggy Lowe, with whom he was in love.\n\nBetty Wilson and her sister, Peggy, were both arrested and went on to be tried for capital murder, while James White accepted a plea deal in exchange for testifying against both women. After a brief trial, a jury found Betty guilty, and she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Peggy Lowe, on the other hand, was tried for the same crime, but just a few months after her sister’s verdict was read, Peggy was found not guilty. How was it both women could face the same charges, under the same circumstances, and be tried with the same evidence, but receive opposite outcomes?\n\nThank you to David White, of Bring Me the Axe podcast, for research!\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1992. \"Friends of accused express disbelief.\" Montgomery Advertiser, July 13: 13.\n\n—. 1992. \"Suspect's former lover quits post.\" Montgomery Advertiser, June 24: 18.\n\n—. 1992. \"Twin sisters suspects in man's murder.\" Selma Times-Journal, June 7: 7.\n\nBetty Woods Wilson v.
