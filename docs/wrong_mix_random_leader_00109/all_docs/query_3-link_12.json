        "text": "Actress Brittany Murphy, star of Hollywood films such as Clueless and 8 Mile, has died at the age of 32 after collapsing at home in Los Angeles.\n\nCoroners said that Murphy, who was pronounced dead in hospital, appeared to have died of natural causes.\n\nThe Reuters news agency is reporting that the actress died of a cardiac arrest.\n\nAshton Kutcher, co-star of the 2003 comedy Just Married, paid tribute to her as a \"little piece of sunshine\".\n\nThe official cause of death may not be determined for some time as toxicology tests are required.\n\nMurphy was pronounced dead at 1004 (1804 GMT) on Sunday at a hospital near Beverly Hills.\n\nShe had been taken there after the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call at the Hollywood Hills home she shared with her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack.\n\nShe is reported to have been found unconscious in the shower.\n\nAssistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said the authorities were looking into her medical history.\n\n\"It appears to be natural,\" he added.\n\nLos Angeles police have opened an investigation into the death.\n\n'An absolute doll'\n\nA neighbour, Clare Staples, said she had seen firefighters working to resuscitate the actress on Sunday morning, The Associated Press reports.\n\nMurphy collapsed at her home\n\nThe actress's husband, wearing pyjama bottoms and no shoes, appeared \"dazed\" as the firefighters tried to save her, Ms Staples added.\n\nMurphy's father, Angelo Bertolotti, said: \"She was just an absolute doll since she was born.\n\n\"Her personality was always outward. Everybody loved her - people that made movies with her, people on a cruise - they all loved her.\"\n\nMurphy's publicist released a statement on behalf of her family.\n\n\"The sudden loss of our beloved Brittany is a terrible tragedy. She was our daughter, our wife, our love and a shining star. We ask you to respect our privacy at this time.\"\n\nKutcher, who once dated the actress, paid tribute to her on Twitter: \"2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine.\"\n\n\"My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany's family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon,\" he added.\n\nMurphy left the production of indie film The Caller earlier this month. Her agent said she had quit because of \"creative differences\".\n\nGoing to California\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Murphy grew up in New Jersey but moved to Los Angeles with her mother to pursue acting.\n\nMurphy was married to British screenwriter Simon Monjack\n\n\"When I asked my mom to move to California, she sold everything and moved out here for me,\" Murphy once said.\n\n\"I was really grateful to have grown up in an environment that was conducive to creating and didn't stifle any of that.\"\n\nThe actress got her start in the sleeper hit Clueless and rose to stardom in 8 Mile alongside rapper Eminem.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC about 8 Mile, she said: \"What I love is the way it explores the willingness to get out of where you are, and the fact that you actually can make it, no matter what.\"\n\nHer on-screen roles declined in recent years but Murphy voiced characters for the hit US television series King of the Hill and animated movie Happy Feet.\n\nShe is due to appear in Sylvester Stallone's film, The Expendables, set for release next year.\n\nFuneral arrangements have not yet been announced.\n\nWhat are your memories of Brittany Murphy?\n\nSend your comments using the post form below.\n\nA selection of your comments may be published, displaying your name and location unless you state otherwise in the box below.\n\nName\n\nYour E-mail address\n\nTown & Country\n\nPhone number (optional):\n\nComments\n\nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published.
