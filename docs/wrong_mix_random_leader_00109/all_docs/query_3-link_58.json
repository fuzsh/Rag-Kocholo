        "text": "Britany Murphy's half-brother Tony Bertolotti claims that her estate is controlled by her mother Sharon, an unnamed person who is an editor of a tabloid newspaper along with a doctor who treats diabetes.\n\nTony Bertolotti keeps on saying that she was murdered as her death came as a surprise to all and doctors found \"impurities in her blood, including arsenic.\" But the cause of death was that she had pneumonia, anemia, and prescription drug abuse.\n\nBrittany Murphy's estate is valued in $10 million\n\nTony Bertolotti says that her death 13 years ago left a lot of unanswered questions and said that he \"has no idea where the \"Clueless\" star's $10 million fortune is.\"\n\nThe mom, the editor and a doctor\n\nHe mentioned that \"The estate was left to Sharon, an editor of a major Hollywood newspaper - he was on the paperwork for her estate - and also a diabetes doctor from Miami she was seeing, those were the controlling names on the estate.\"\n\nBertolotti believes that the family members are keeping all the details about the estate under wraps, and when he and other family members tried to find out about it they hit a brick wall.\n\nWhen Murphy died, she was married to Simon Monjack, a British screenwriter that reportedly had also some money problems and his relationship with the law was somewhat complicated.\n\nSimon Monjack was not in her wife's will\n\nMonjack was not in the will and according to the Sun, Bertolotti has constantly underlined that her sister's death was motivated by money.\n\n\"There's no way she died of natural causes. It's impossible. It's bulls-t, total crap,\" Bertolotti mentioned \"It was obvious to me, she was taken out.\"\n\nHer husband Simon Monjack died of the same causes just five months later than Brittany\n\nBrittney's body was found on the bathroom floor, and according to Monjack, he brought her into the shower to try to revive her but nothing happened.\n\n\"Why did they put her in a hot shower? That's how you get the temperature up\" Bertolotti, said that he is not interested in his sister's money.\n\nHe continued, \"The guy that's got the real information is the butler. He knows more than anybody else. He quit because the place was a nuthouse. He confided with my father.\"\n\n\"I just pray for my sister to rest in peace,\" Bertolotti concluded."
