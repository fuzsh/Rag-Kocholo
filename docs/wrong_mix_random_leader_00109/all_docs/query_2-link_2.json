She was 32.\n\nMurphy was pronounced dead at 10:04 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Sally Stewart said. Stewart would not provide a cause of death or any other information.\n\nMurphy was transported to the hospital after the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call at 8 a.m. at the home she shared with her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nLos Angeles police have opened an investigation into Murphy’s death, Officer Norma Eisenman said. Detectives and coroner’s officials were at Murphy and Monjack’s home above the Sunset Strip on Sunday afternoon but did not talk to reporters. Paparazzi were camped outside.\n\nMessages left for Murphy’s manager, agent and publicist were not immediately returned.\n\nNeighbor Clare Staples said she saw firefighters working to resuscitate the actress Sunday morning. She said Murphy was on a stretcher and “looked as though she was dead at the scene.”\n\nMurphy’s husband, wearing pajama bottoms and no shoes, appeared “dazed” as firefighters tried to save her, Staples said. “It’s just tragic,” she added.\n\nTMZ.com first reported Murphy’s death Sunday morning.\n\nMurphy’s father, Angelo Bertolotti, said he learned of her death from his son, the actress’ brother, and was stunned.\n\n“She was just an absolute doll since she was born,” Bertolotti said from his Branford, Fla., home. “Her personality was always outward. Everybody loved her — people that made movies with her, people on a cruise — they all loved her. She was just a regular gal.”\n\nHe said he hadn’t heard much about the circumstances of Murphy’s death. Bertolotti divorced her mother when Murphy was young and hadn’t seen Murphy in the past few years. He said he used to be in the mob and served prison time on federal drug charges.\n\n“She was just talented,” Bertolotti said. “And I loved her very much.”\n\nBorn Nov. 10, 1977, in Atlanta, Murphy grew up in New Jersey and later moved with her mother to Los Angeles to pursue acting.\n\nHer career started in the early 1990s with small roles in television series, commercials and movies. She is best known for parts in “Girl, Interrupted,” “Clueless” and “8 Mile.”\n\nHer on-screen roles declined in recent years, but Murphy’s voice gave life to numerous animated characters, including Luanne Platter on more than 200 episodes of Fox’s “King of the Hill” and Gloria the penguin in the 2006 feature “Happy Feet.”\n\nShe is due to appear in Sylvester Stallone’s upcoming film “The Expendables,” set for release next year.\n\nMurphy credited her mother, Sharon, with being a key to her success.\n\nMurphy dated Ashton Kutcher, who co-starred with her in 2003’s romantic comedy “Just Married.”\n\nKutcher sent a message on Twitter on Sunday morning about Murphy’s death: “2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine,” Kutcher wrote. “My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany’s family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon.”\n\nOriginally Published: December 20, 2009 at 11:01 p.m."
