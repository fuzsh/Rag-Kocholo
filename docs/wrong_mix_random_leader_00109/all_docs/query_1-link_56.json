Cloud’s passing came one week after he buried his father. “It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today. As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways,” the actor’s family said in a statement at the time. “Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend.”\n\nCloud’s loved ones added: “Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence. We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone. We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss.”\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nStephen 'tWitch' Boss\n\nThe former So You Think You Can Dance contestant died at age 40 in December 2022. His wife, Allison Holker, addressed the news in a heartbreaking statement soon after.\n\n\"To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt. I am certain there won't be a day that goes by that we won't honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children,\" she told People. \"Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you.\"\n\nThe couple tied the knot in December 2013 and raised three children together.\n\nCredit: Henry Lamb/Photowire/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nKirstie Alley\n\nThe Emmy winner died in December 2022 after a short battle with cancer. She was 71.\n\n“We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered,” the actress’ family shared in a letter via Alley’s Instagram at the time. “She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead. As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother.”\n\nCredit: Eric Charbonneau/Shutterstock\n\nBob Saget\n\nThe Full House alum was found unresponsive in January 2022 in his Florida hotel room while in town for a comedy show. He was pronounced dead at the scene at age 65. One month later, authorities concluded that Saget passed from “head trauma” after he “accidentally hit the back of his head on something,” according to a statement from his family.\n\n“Every day it feels a little bit better, but then it’ll hit you outta nowhere,” Candace Cameron Bure, who played Saget’s eldest TV daughter on Full House, told Us in February 2022 of his passing. “I will really greatly miss his friendship and the laughs and the hugs.”\n\nCredit: SIPA/Shutterstock\n\nBetty White\n\nWhile the Golden Girls alum lived a long life — and had a very successful career in Hollywood — her death in December 2021 shocked her fans as it came just shy of her 100th birthday. The legendary actress passed away on New Year’s Eve at age 99. Her milestone birthday was on January 17, 2022. Us confirmed in January 2022 that White suffered a cerebrovascular accident, according to her death certificate. The incident causes tissue damage as a result of losing blood flow to the brain. The Hot in Cleveland alum previously suffered a stroke several days before her death.\n\nCredit: Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nWillie Garson\n\nThe Sex and the City alum’s September 2021 death at age 57 came as a surprise to much of Hollywood. It was later confirmed that the actor, who was in production on And Just Like That when he died, had been fighting pancreatic cancer.\n\n“So deeply, deeply sad we have lost @WillieGarson. We all loved him and adored working with him,” former costar Cynthia Nixon tweeted at the time. “He was endlessly funny on-screen and in real life. He was a source of light, friendship and show business lore. He was a consummate professional — always.”\n\nCredit: YouTube\n\nNorm Macdonald\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alum died in September 2021 at age 61. The comedian privately battled cancer for nearly 10 years before his passing. “He was most proud of his comedy,” his longtime producing partner, Lori Jo Hoekstra, told Us in a statement at the time. “He never wanted the diagnosis to affect the way the audience or any of his loved ones saw him. Norm was a pure comic. He once wrote that ‘a joke should catch someone by surprise, it should never pander.’ He certainly never pandered. Norm will be missed terribly.”\n\nCredit: David Fisher/Shutterstock\n\nDustin Diamond\n\nThe Saved by the Bell alum died at the age of 44 in February 2021, just three weeks after being diagnosed with stage IV small cell carcinoma. “In that time, it managed to spread rapidly throughout his system; the only mercy it exhibited was its sharp and swift execution,\" his rep said in a statement to Us. “Dustin did not suffer. He did not have to lie submerged in pain. For that, we are grateful.”\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nChadwick Boseman\n\nThe Black Panther star died at the age of 43 in August 2020 at his Los Angeles home after secretly battling colon cancer for four years. “It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman,” the family said in a statement at the time. “Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016 and battled with it these last four years as it progressed to stage IV. A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much. From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Panther. He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side.”\n\nCredit: John Photography/Shutterstock\n\nNaya Rivera\n\nThe former Glee star died in July 2020, following a boating incident where she went missing. On July 8, the actress, who was 33, was declared missing after taking a pontoon boat out on Lake Piru near Los Angeles with her 4-year-old son, Josey. Her child was found asleep on the vessel by a boater that afternoon, alongside Rivera’s purse, wallet and ID. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department announced on July 13 that they recovered her body following an extensive search and recovery effort.\n\nCredit: David Mendez/Young Hollywood/Getty Images\n\nCameron Boyce\n\nThe Grown Ups actor’s family confirmed his death at age 20 in July 2019. “It is with a profoundly heavy heart that we report that this morning we lost Cameron. He passed away in his sleep due to a seizure which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated,” a statement read at the time. \"The world is now undoubtedly without one of its brightest lights, but his spirit will live on through the kindness and compassion of all who knew and loved him.”\n\nCredit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nLuke Perry\n\nThe Beverly Hills, 90210 and Riverdale star died at the age of 52 on March 4, 2019. He had suffered a massive stroke five days earlier at his Los Angeles-area home, and remained hospitalized until his death. “[Perry] was surrounded by his children Jack and Sophie, fiancé Wendy Madison Bauer, ex-wife Minnie Sharp, mother Ann Bennett, stepfather Steve Bennett, brother Tom Perry, sister Amy Coder and other close family and friends,” his rep said in a statement to Us. “The family appreciates the outpouring of support and prayers that have been extended to Luke from around the world, and respectfully request privacy in this time of great mourning.”\n\nCredit: INFphoto.com\n\nAnthony Bourdain\n\nThe celebrity chef died of an apparent suicide in France at the age of 61. \"It is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain,” CNN said in a statement on June 8. \"His love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nCredit: MTV\n\nDiem Brown\n\nThe MTV Challenge star died in November 2014 at the age of 32, after losing her brave battle with cancer. Having overcome the disease in 2006 and again in 2012, the reality star was diagnosed with cancer for the third time in summer 2014. Still, Brown's fierce fight to survive continued to inspire many. In one of her final tweets, she wrote: \"Whatever option I have to LIVE I'm grabbing! … No is not an option.\"\n\nCredit: Francois Durand/WireImage\n\nPrince\n\nThe icon — who released 39 studio albums, won seven Grammys and an Academy Award, and was known for hits including \"Purple Rain,\" \"Kiss,\" \"Little Red Corvette\" and \"When Doves Cry,\" among many others — died at his Paisley Park residence in Minnesota on April 21, 2016, at 57. While his autopsy results have yet to be released, Prince was found with prescription painkillers in his possession at the time of his death. The DEA and U.S. Attorney’s Office joined the ongoing investigation into his death, and investigators are looking into whether a doctor was prescribing drugs to him prior to his death, and are considering a possible overdose."
