        "text": "8 MILE star and battle rapper Nashawn Breedlove has died at home in New Jersey at the age of 46.\n\nThe actor was best known for his role as Lotto - opposite Eminem in the 2002 film.\n\nNashawn died in his sleep at home in New Jersey on Monday, according to TMZ.\n\nFamily and friends do not yet know the cause of his death, the outlet revealed.\n\nThe 46-year-old starred alongside world-famous rapper Eminem in the film 8 Mile, which was loosely based on the songwriter's own life.\n\nNashawn appeared in a scene where his character Lotto took on Eminem's B-Rabbit in a rap battle.\n\nThe rap star sang: \"I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from 'Leave it to Beaver,'\" and the crowd roared in response.\n\nDespite the wild reaction, Lotto, played by Nashawn, eventually lost the showdown.\n\nBELOVED RAPPER\n\nThough 8 Mile was his big break in showbiz, the rapper was already performing under the stage name OX before he was cast in the film.\n\nHe was featured on the soundtrack of the movie The Wash featuring Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in 2001.\n\nFellow rap star Mickey Factz was the first to reveal Nashawn's death, taking to Instagram to share a heartfelt post for his lost friend.\n\nMickey shared Nashawn's famous scene opposite Eminem along with the caption: \"RIP to one of the few emcee’s to beat Eminem… Lotto from 8 Mile.\n\n\"Who’s friends lovingly called him, OX. You will be missed for your tenacity and aggressiveness.\"\n\nFAN CONDOLENCES\n\nFans and friends flooded the comments with their words of condolences for the deceased rapper.\n\n\"My best friend and brother since 15 years old.We been thru it all Rest Easy my bro luv u and the family and my nephew OX FOREVER,\" one wrote.\n\n\"The first mc who was ever robbed of his win in a rap battle! Rip lotto,\" a second penned.\n\n\"NOOOOOO! I met Ox when we was Teens. He was in a group called The Now. Illest group of emcees I've ever met in my friggin life. They SMOKED my group in a showcase competition but they was humble and cool.\n\n\"Ox stood out. Super good dude. I lost touch with him before 8 Mile. I had high hopes for that man. Sad to hear this news. May he RIP,\" a third recalled.\n\nNashawn's ex-girlfriend Latisha Harper wrote: \"Thank you for posting this. Nashawn was so humble and modest he didn’t even know he had true fans. He was so talented.\n\n\"Not only Wa he an amazing MC he sang better than Luther. He blessed me with my son @youngzaak and I swear that is Nashawn to the 10th power. I will always be his biggest fan.if yal only knew his talent. Please pray for our strength it is needed. Thank you again @mickey.factz.\"\n\nThe pair share one son, 22-year-old Zaak who also published a message to his lost father.\n\n\"RIP to my Father, The Legend of Hip Hop @nashawn.breedlove #lottofrom8mile #brabbit #lotto @eminem @50cent,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Aw man Rest In Peace,\" another fan put shortly.\n\n\"Rest In Peace brotha SALUTE,\" a final remarked.\n\n8 MILE END\n\nNashawn is not the first from 8 Mile to have passed in the years since the film's release."
