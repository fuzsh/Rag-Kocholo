EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Brittany Murphy's final movie opens Friday in Eugene, Ore.

The actress died at age 32 in December 2009. That year she worked on a psychological thriller called "Something Wicked," and much of it was filmed in Eugene.

The movie failed to get a distribution deal with the large studios. But producer and local businessman Scott Chambers told The Register-Guard (http://is.gd/OjF8vD ) that Regal Cinemas is giving the film a test run in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington over the coming month before deciding whether to roll it out beyond the Northwest.

Crews filmed at nearly 30 Oregon locations over a 40-day span in 2009.
