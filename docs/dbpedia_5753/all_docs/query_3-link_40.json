He has single handily change the way the game is played and evolved the sport around him.\n\nMessi wasn’t born into being the greatest, but did succeed after so much dedication was given from him. Lionel Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. At the age of eight, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell’s Old boys, a Rosario based club. He was unlike other kids in his age group, since he was shorter compared to the other kids. Eventually he was diagnosed with a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. His parents tried to help his disease with growth-hormone injections but soon became impossible to pay for the medication (“Lionel Messi Biography”). At the …show more content…\n\nMessi has not only unbelievable stats and amazing accomplishments, he has records that will never be broken in soccer. Messi’s records are quite insane that you would think he’s the one that actually created the record himself. He has so many records that they’re split into different categories. Messi has World records, European records, Barcelona records, Spanish records and Argentinian records.

Moving on from his Argentina records, he was the first Barcelona player to surpass fifty goals in one season, and surpassed it three seasons in a row (“Greig, Stephen”). Messi also was the first Barcelona player to be La Liga top scorer three times. He then made history when he scored fourteen goals in the Champions League, making it the most in a single season for Barcelona (9). In my opinion Messi couldn’t be physical or mentally compared to any player around the world. His European records prove …show more content…\n\n“Messi is the best in the world without any doubt and for me the History of Soccer” said by Luis Enrique Manager of Barcelona. There are more quotes like this from coaches and even players from around the world about Messi but that would take up pages. In my opinion Messi can’t ever be compared to any player in the world, because he is something out of this world. Messi isn’t like any player in the history of soccer and that’s why there will never be another Messi again. You won’t ever see astonishing stats, amazing accomplishments, and unbelievable records from another player to realize in ten years, as Messi has triumphed. The game of soccer will continue to change around Messi but he will still reign over it till he"
