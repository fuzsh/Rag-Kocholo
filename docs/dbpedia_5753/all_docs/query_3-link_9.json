        "text": "After winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina, Lionel Messi got to lift one of few trophies that had eluded him throughout his career.\n\nAt club level, the attacker rarely goes a season without picking up a title and he won four UEFA Champions League crowns with Barcelona.\n\nBut until just a few years ago, Messi's international record didn't make for such great reading, as he lost a number of finals with Argentina.\n\nThanks to his recent success, the iconic No.10 seems to be finishing his career on the global stage with an almighty bang, as he all but completes the trophy bingo of modern football.\n\nMORE: Messi tops list of Argentina World Cup top scorers\n\nLionel Messi trophies with Argentina\n\nMessi's trophy cabinet at the international level has quickly filled over the past two years with the 2022 World Cup proving his crowning glory.\n\nThe Argentine broke his senior international trophy drought in 2021 as he won the Copa America final at his fourth attempt.\n\nPrior to that, Messi had won titles with Argentina's U20 and Olympic team over a decade earlier.\n\nCompetition Titles Year FIFA World Cup 1 2022 Finalissima\n\n(UEFA-CONMEBOL trophy) 1 2022 Copa America\n\n(South American title) 1 2021 Olympic gold medal 1 2008 FIFA Under-20 World Cup 1 2005\n\nLionel Messi trophies with Inter Miami\n\nThe Argentine star had an immediate impact in the United States, joining Inter Miami and instantly leading the South Florida side to their first trophy in club history with the 2023 Leagues Cup. Messi's contributions were nothing short of immense, as the club sat bottom of the Eastern Conference when he arrived, but with his influence they exploded to life.\n\nMessi has the chance to help Inter Miami to another title as the club is set to contest the U.S. Open Cup final against the Houston Dynamo.\n\nHe will need to help the club climb the MLS standings if he wishes to have a shot at the league title, as they must first qualify for the playoffs to be afforded a chance at the championship.\n\nCompetition Titles Seasons Leagues Cup 1 2023\n\nLionel Messi trophies with Barcelona\n\nMessi's habit for picking up titles began from the outset of his club career with Barcelona.\n\nBy the time he left Camp Nou in 2021, he had won a stunning 34 team trophies with the Catalans.\n\nCompetition Titles Seasons La Liga\n\n(Spanish league) 10 2004/05, 2005/06, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11,\n\n2012/13, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2017/18, 2018/19 Copa del Rey\n\n(Spanish Cup) 7 2008/09, 2011/12, 2014/15,\n\n2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2020/21 Supercopa de Espana\n\n(Spanish Super Cup) 7 2006, 2009, 2010,\n\n2011, 2013, 2016, 2018 UEFA Champions League 4 2005/06, 2008/09, 2010/11, 2014/15 UEFA Super Cup 3 2009, 2011, 2015 FIFA Club World Cup 3 2009, 2011, 2015\n\nLionel Messi trophies with PSG\n\nThe Argentine only played two seasons with PSG, but he picked up another three pieces of silverware in France.\n\nHowever, the Parisian giants were really hoping Messi would have helped them to win the Champions League title, which did not come to fruition during his time at the club.\n\nHonor Titles Seasons Ligue 1\n\n(French league) 2 2021/22, 2022/23 Trophee des Champions\n\n(French Super Cup) 1 2022\n\nMORE: Messi's record in finals for club and country\n\nLionel Messi individual awards\n\nAll of those team trophies wouldn't have flowed so freely if it wasn't for Messi himself.\n\nHis magic in the final third has captivated the world for the past 15 years and as a result he's picked up numerous individual honours.\n\nHis seven Ballon d'Or wins is a record that will take some beating with archrival Cristiano Ronaldo stuck on five.\n\nAward Titles Year/Season Ballon d'Or\n\n(World Player of the Year) 7 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015,\n\n2019, 2021 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball\n\n(Best player of tournament) 2 2014, 2022 Argentina Player of the Year 14 2005, 2007-2013,\n\n2015-2017, 2019-2021 La Liga Player of the Year 6 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11,\n\n2011/12, 2012/13, 2014/15 La Liga top scorer\n\n(Pichichi trophy) 8 2009/10, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2016/17,\n\n2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21 European Golden Boot\n\n(Top scorer across Europe) 6 2009/10, 2011/12, 2012/13,\n\n2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19 FIFA World Player of the Year\n\n(Awarded from 1991-2015) 1 2009 FIFA The Best Award\n\n(Player of the Year est. 2015) 2 2019, 2022 FIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball 2 2009, 2011\n\nTrophies Messi has not won?\n\nThe World Cup was long seen as the missing piece in Messi's title collection.\n\nArgentina's 2022 triumph over France meant he claimed the two key pieces of international silverware available to a South American player â€” a World Cup and Copa America.\n\nAt club level, he has won the league with his two sides to date and picked up four UEFA Champions League titles.\n\nWith Barcelona, Messi won all possible team trophies available in Spain. He is yet to match this feat in France with PSG, however, with a Coupe de France title still required after they fell short in the Round of 16 of both the 2021/22 and 2022/23 editions."
