        "text": "Argentina will play exhibition games against Nigeria and Ivory Coast in China next month, meaning Lionel Messi could miss Inter Miami’s Major League Soccer game at the New York Red Bulls on March 23.\n\nThe Argentina Football Association said the Albiceleste will play Nigeria in Hangzhou, and Ivory Coast in Beijing during a tour of China from March 18-26, to coincide with Fifa’s international window.\n\nMessi mania hit China last year when Argentina took on Australia at the 68,000-seat Workers’ Stadium in Beijing. The world’s best player was making his seventh trip to the country, although it was his first since 2017, and fans gave him a rockstar welcome.\n\nA video showing one spectator invading the pitch and hugging his idol went viral, and was watched 400 million times on Weibo alone in the days afterwards.\n\nWorld Cup winners Argentina being the defence of their Copa América title against Canada or Trinidad and Tobago on June 20 in Atlanta.\n\nMiami, who play a Hong Kong XI on Sunday as part of their preseason tour of Asia, begin their first full MLS season with Messi in the squad at Salt Lake on February 21.\n\nThe match at the Red Bulls is the team’s only game during the international fixture period, when clubs are required to release players to national teams."
