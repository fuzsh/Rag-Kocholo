        "text": "Messi Mania is almost here.\n\nFriday night is the night. The reigning World Cup champions Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, will face Guatemala in a friendly match at Commanders Field in Landover, Maryland.\n\nThe legendary forward moved to South Florida last year to play for MLS’s Inter Miami. But he’s yet to play in front of a DMV audience since moving stateside, missing his club team’s away game against DC United in March due to injury.\n\nArgentina's head coach Lionel Scaloni told night that he plans to have the 36-year-old international superstar start the game and would like to give him as much field time as possible.\n\nOn Sunday, Messi came off the bench and played the final 34 minutes in Chicago against Ecuador in Argentina's first friendly before the inaugural Copa America match against Canada on June 20.\n\nOn third-party ticket websites, there are still tickets available for Friday's match. The price ranges from $120 to 180 dollars with midfield seats priced around $300. Officials said about 40,000 tickets have been sold.\n\nALSO SEE:\n\nMessi has played in the DMV region before. Just once though and that was back in 2017 at FedEx Field during Barcelona's USA preseason summer tour.\n\nHe was part of the Argentine squad paired with El Salvador for a 2015 friendly at FedEx Field but did not play because of a foot injury.\n\nCopa América, to be played in 12 U.S. cities from June 20-July 15, is considered the third most important international tournament behind the World Cup and the European Championship."
