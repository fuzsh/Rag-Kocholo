        "text": "At 37 years old, Lionel Messi continues to expand his mark in the history of soccer. This time, reaffirming his position as the player with the most titles. Argentina's victory over Colombia in the final of the 2024 Copa América has been a milestone for the albiceleste team, which has won three consecutive championships (Copa América 2021 and 2022 World Cup). However, it has also marked the 45th professional trophy for the former Barcelona forward.\n\nPlayers with the most titles\n\nIn second place is Dani Alves, with 44 trophies\n\nThe scenario was tough. Messi injured his ankle in the 65th minute and had to be substituted. On the bench, the Argentine star couldn't hold back the tears. Images that have already gone around the world. Nevertheless, even having to wait until the 112th minute of extra time for the game to be decided, the Argentine national team was finally able to lift their 16th Copa América. And with that, Messi reaffirmed his status as the player with the most trophies in history.\n\nWith 45 titles, the Rosario soccer player surpasses the former Barça player Dani Alves, who, now retired, has 44 titles to his name. In third place is Andrés Iniesta, with 37 titles, followed by players like Maxwell, Piqué, and Giggs.\n\nAlthough it may seem like he is in the twilight of his career, Messi continues to accumulate championships year after year. In 2023, he pocketed the Leagues Cup from the MLS with Inter Miami. During his previous stint as a player for Paris Saint-Germain, he added three more trophies: one Trophée des Champions (2022-2023 season) and two Ligue 1 titles. Added to these are the 35 titles he achieved as a Barça player, including four Champions League trophies, 10 league titles, and seven Copa del Rey wins.\n\nWearing the albiceleste shirt, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner has just polished off his collection of collective trophies. With the national team, Messi has managed to bring home four out of the last five titles in competition: the last two editions of the Copa América (2021 and 2024), the much-coveted 2022 Qatar World Cup, and the 2022 Finalissima against Italy. Considering the gold from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2005 U-20 World Cup, Messi would now add up to the 45 titles he currently holds."
