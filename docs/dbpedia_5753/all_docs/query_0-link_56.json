        "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The decisive moment of Argentina’s penultimate step toward a Copa América repeat was just like the rest of the climb: simple.\n\nIt wasn’t easy. The Argentines had to work, and think, and sweat here at MetLife Stadium on a steamy Tuesday night, in the first of two Copa semifinals. They had to stomach the occasional early scare.\n\nBut they brushed aside Canada, 2-0, to reach Sunday’s final. Their clincher was perhaps the most subtle, plain goal Lionel Messi will ever score, his first of the tournament. And their breakthrough, midway through the first half, was straightforward — literally.\n\nIt required only two passes, from center back to central midfielder, then central midfielder to center forward. The first, from Cristian Romero to Rodrigo De Paul, was harmless. But the second found Argentina's Canada killer, Julián Álvarez.\n\nHis first touch was excellent. His second left Canadian defender Moïse Bombito on the grass. His third beat goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau, and put Argentina ahead.\n\nIt was Álvarez who had broken through three weeks earlier, when these two teams met in the 2024 Copa América opener. On that night in Atlanta, Canada lasted 48 minutes. Here, it lasted only 22.\n\nIn those 22 minutes, the underdogs were frisky. They detected openings. They sprung forward on the counter. They threatened.\n\nBut they didn't quite have the quality to pounce on opportunities. And once they conceded, they were toast.\n\nMessi, with a classic feint and a right-footed shot, nearly buried the Reds right before halftime.\n\nSome five minutes after halftime, he did bury them.\n\nHe got off the mark at the 2024 Copa América, ironically, with one of the most Cristiano Ronaldo goals of his glittering career. He slid a pass to De Paul. He continued his run. After some penalty-box pinball, he stabbed his foot at an Enzo Fernandez shot, and half-poked, half-caressed it into the net.\n\nHe glanced at the assistant referee, unsure whether he was onside. But he was, so he gently leapt into Enzo's arms, and felt a feeling he hadn't felt in a competitive Argentina game since October.\n\nHe had looked relatively pedestrian in three prior 2024 Copa América games. And frankly, Argentina had as well.\n\nLa Albiceleste looked vulnerable in that opener against Canada. They needed a late and lucky Lautaro Martinez goal to beat Chile. They rested starters in a meaningless group finale against Peru. They then needed a penalty shootout — and a heroic goalkeeper, Emiliano Martínez — to survive Ecuador in the quarterfinals.\n\nSo they entered this semifinal as unproven as a world champion can be. At times, they seemed to lack attacking ideas.\n\nBut they had enough to beat Canada again; they were occasionally sloppy but sufficient.\n\nThey have had enough to reach a third consecutive major tournament final, where they'll meet their first mighty opponent of the summer, either Colombia or Uruguay.\n\nWhether they have proved anything yet isn't all that relevant. They are 90 minutes away from another title.\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER40 updates\n\nFeatured\n\nFULL TIME: Argentina 2-0 Canada\n\n22' Julián Álvarez scores after a sweet assist from Rodrigo De Paul.\n\n51' Lionel Messi scores his first goal of the tournament off an assist from Enzo Fernandez.\n\n89' Dibu with the save!\n\n88' Nahuel Molina booked\n\nMolina gets a yellow card.\n\n79' Ismael Kone booked\n\n71' Jonathan Osorio replaces Alphonso Davies\n\n63' Eustaquio booked\n\nBoth of these fellas scored goals today\n\n51' GOAL ARGENTINA\n\nMessi flicks it in off an assist from Fernandez inside the box.\n\nSecond half starts now\n\nArgentina is just 45 minutes away from another Copa América final\n\n44' Messi's shot goes wide"
