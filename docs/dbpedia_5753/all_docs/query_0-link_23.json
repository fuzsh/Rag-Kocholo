Five days later, the reigning World Cup champions will play Guatemala at Commanders Field in Landover, Maryland.\n\nThat will be Argentina’s last warm-up game before it opens its Copa América campaign on June 20 against Canada in Atlanta.\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni will have to submit his final 26-man roster for the tournament on June 12.\n\nScaloni is leaning toward selecting most of the players that won the country’s third World Cup title in Qatar in 2022.\n\nArgentina will be in Group A, which also includes Chile and Peru.\n\n___"
