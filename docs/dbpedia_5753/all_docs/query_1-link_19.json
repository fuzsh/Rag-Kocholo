The 2022 World Cup winners will then travel to Brazil for the teamâs second qualifying match during the international break on Tuesday, Nov. 21 at 7:30 p.m. ET at the MaracanÃ£ Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Â\n\nFor Argentina, Messi holds the records for most caps (178), most goals (106), and most World Cup goals (13), while also holding the international record for most World Cup match appearances (26) and being the only player to score in the World Cup group stage, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and final. He has also been key in making history for La Albiceleste, leading the teamâs historic 2021 CONMEBOL Copa AmÃ©rica, 2022 Finalissima and 2022 FIFA World Cup title wins. Messi most recently represented his country and helped the teamâs winning run continue in FIFA World Cup qualifiers in October. In the second fixture of the FIFA window, Messi led the way in a 2-0 win over Peru on Tuesday, Oct. 17, playing the full 90 minutes and registering two jaw-dropping goals in the 32nd and 42nd minutes. Notably, with his brace Messi achieved yet another historic record, as he became the top goalscorer in Conmebol World Cup qualifiers history with 31 goals.\n\nOn the club side, Messi made 14 appearances across all competitions in 2023 after joining Inter Miami in the summer, registering an impressive 11 goals and eight assists. Notably, the Argentine helped Inter Miami to a historic win in the 2023 Leagues Cup to clinch the First Teamâs first official title in Club history, winning Leagues Cup Best Player and Top Scorer awards after recording an impressive 10 goals and four assists in seven games in the competition.."
