        "text": "The Argentine soccer team landed in the United States ahead of what could be a significant week for the team. The defending World champions will kick-start their set of friendlies as they take on El Salvador this Friday. All eyes will surely be on Lionel Messi. This is the first time Argentina will play in the United States after winning the World Cup title in 2022. While fans would be eager to see Messi in action, it seems they might have to wait a little longer.\n\nThe Argentina Football Association issued a statement earlier this week addressing La Pulga’s availability for the international tour. In their press release, AFA confirmed the player’s absence from the squad. The management noted, “Lionel Messi will not be in the squad for the friendlies in the U.S. due to a minor right hamstring injury sustained in the Inter Miami game against Nashville.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nLionel Scaloni has ruled Messi out from the tour and will rely on the other names for the two friendlies. However, fans saw the player training alongside Inter Miami teammates during their practice session. It gave rise to multiple speculations about his availability. However, neither Argentina nor Inter Miami want to put a load on the player. Both teams want him to recover completely before taking to the field.\n\nAccording to reports, there is a possibility that Lionel Messi might not be included in Inter Miami’s lineup for the upcoming match against the New York Red Bulls. It will be interesting to see if Messi will make a return to his national team in the coming months or have to wait until the Copa America to ply his trade.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCan Lionel Messi repeat history with Argentina during the Copa America 2024\n\nWhen the stage is set and the lights are the brightest, some stars have what it takes to shine brighter than the rest, like the North star in a clear sky. Well, Lionel Messi is undoubtedly the crème de la crème when it comes to shining stars. Messi will once again look to prove his mettle as Argentina looks to defend their Copa America title come June. The team then had the perfect fairytale run during the 2022 World Cup. However, that is a story of the past and Argentina is no longer the underdogs!\n\nREAD MORE: Cristiano Ronaldo’s Exit Threw Bruno Fernandes Under the Bus at Manchester United- “His Name Attracted More Attention Than Mine”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe Albiceleste will have tremendous pressure on their shoulders as they return to the United States in June. Lionel Messi’s men have been on a roll, and fans have already labeled them the favorites for the competition. However, things are not going to be as easy as it sounds. All the teams in the tournament will be gunning for the world champions. With a target painted on their back, it will be interesting to see if Lionel Messi can lead his side to a hat-trick of international silverware."
