        "text": "Click here to follow the Copa America on The Athletic and get relevant stories in your personalised feed.\n\nCanada defender Kamal Miller walked through the Mercedes-Benz Stadium mixed zone and took questions from the press. Miller hadn’t played in the game, but the former Inter Miami center-back has unique insight into the influence that Lionel Messi has on team-mates.\n\nAfter Argentina’s narrow 2-0 win over Canada, Miller and Messi embraced. The two shared an MLS dressing room for half a season in 2023.\n\n“I told him I loved him,” Miller said. “It was nice to see him again. I didn’t play today but he gave me the confidence to keep going. He said my opportunity will come.”\n\nMessi is respected by his opponents. But loved? Miller was all smiles as he spoke about his former captain.\n\nClearly Messi has left his mark on the Portland Timbers defender, 27, that will last a lifetime. Messi wasn’t on the final scoresheet but he was the catalyst that inspired the world champions towards a hard-fought victory in the opening match of the Copa America.\n\nMessi provided an assist, several highlight-worthy plays and a willingness to play through Canada’s physical approach. It was a captain’s performance from the 36-year-old.\n\n“He’s always the difference on any given night,” said Argentina defender Nahuel Molina. “We know that. He’s very special to us.”\n\nIn a cagey win, Argentina relied on Messi to find a breakthrough and set the Albiceleste towards a second consecutive Copa America title.\n\nAfter a tense first half in which Canada had the better chances to score, Messi unlocked the backline five minutes into the second half.\n\nMessi’s perfectly weighted through pass found Alexis Mac Allister inside the penalty area. After the Liverpool midfielder collided with Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau, striker Julian Alvarez pounced on the loose ball to score.\n\nThe match remained a see-saw affair until Messi once again split Canada’s two center-backs with an inch-perfect pass to Lautaro Martinez. The Inter Milan forward calmly put his shot past Crepeau to seal the victory. A week prior in a friendly versus Guatemala in Washington, DC, Argentina earned a penalty kick early in the first half.\n\nMessi takes Argentina’s penalties, but on that night, Messi conceded that responsibility to Martinez, who had only recently ended a year-and-a-half scoring drought with the national team.\n\nSensing that Martinez still needed that moment for his own self-confidence, Messi stepped aside and watched Martinez convert. On Thursday night, Messi once again put Martinez in a position to score. That’s what captains do. Argentina will need Martinez to find his sensational Serie A form this summer in the U.S.\n\nMessi wasn’t on the scoresheet but not because of a lack of opportunities. He was denied on numerous occasions by Crepeau — chances that Messi, now 36, has put away countless times.\n\nThe crowd of more than 70,000 in Atlanta still chanted Messi’s name, even as his uncharacteristic lack of precision kept Canada in the match. Messi was tireless, demanding the ball and pushing the team forward.\n\nLate in the second half, Messi recovered from what appeared to be a potentially serious ankle injury. After coming off the field briefly, he returned and continued to take his team forward. When a reporter asked Messi if he felt the Canadians had targeted him, Messi smirked and shook his head.\n\n“We knew they were an intense team with physical players,” Messi said. “Canada is fast and we knew that it wasn’t going to be easy. Every game at this Copa America is going to be played this way. That’s how the (World Cup) qualifiers are in South America and that’s how past Copa America tournaments have been.”\n\nIf you anger Messi or try to kick him out of a game, it drives him on. Canada didn’t cross the line, but they did gamble. Head coach Jesse Marsch told reporters on Monday that he had challenged his players to match Argentina’s “edge” and not focus too much on tactics. Canada was compact in the middle, where most of Argentina’s creativity starts from. It was mostly effective but eventually cracked when Messi found the little space and time he needed.\n\n“Leo was the difference for us in the final third,” said Argentina midfielder Giovani Lo Celso. “His touch put our players right in front of (Canada’s) goal. We should’ve scored earlier. We had to suffer.”\n\nArgentina did suffer and there was a feeling that Canada could leave Atlanta with a surprise result. Marsch’s side did not back down from the best team in the world. Messi was able to break free from his markers — but he was consistently hassled by Canada’s players and he dealt with several physical challenges throughout. Still, even as the end of his career looms, Messi remains influential for his country.\n\nMessi will be 37 on June 24, one day before Argentina’s second group-stage match against Chile. The scene will be a familiar one for him. New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium was the ground where Messi announced his retirement from the national team at the 2016 Copa America Centenario. After a crushing penalty shootout loss to Chile, Messi walked away, briefly.\n\nSo much has changed since then. A celebration will be in order for Argentina’s talisman.\n\n“Of course we’ll plan something for him. We’ll give him something. He’s our captain,” said midfielder Rodrigo De Paul. “He has celebrated many birthdays with us. We’ll want him to enjoy it.”\n\n(Top image: Alex Slitz/Getty Images)"
