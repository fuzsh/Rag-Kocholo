However, after that, the squad will be trimmed down to 26 based on their individual performances and possible injuries for the Copa America tournament.\n\nThe Copa America is a South American football championship and is the world's oldest international football tournament.\n\nScaloni's team includes 22 of 26 names from the 2022 Fifa World Cup winning team in Qatar, including Messi and Angel De Maria.\n\nMessi will lead the Argentina national football team, La Albiceleste, before ultimately heading for the big tournament later on.\n\nThe Inter Miami members, after playing in the friendly matches, will be seen playing in Copa America, which will be held from June 20 till July 14 in the United States.\n\nIn Copa America, Argentina will be seen playing against Canada or Trinidad and Tobago on June 20 in Atlanta, before moving on to New Jersey to face Chile and Peru in Florida."
