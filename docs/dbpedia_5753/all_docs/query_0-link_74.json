        "text": "In the 2004–05 season Messi, at 17 years old, became the youngest official player and goal scorer for the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of soccer). The next year Messi helped FC Barcelona win the Champions League (the European club championship) title. By 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world. During the 2008–09 season Messi scored 38 goals in 51 games and led his team to its first “treble”—winning three major European club titles in one season. He won his first FIFA World Player of the Year honors that year as well. The following season he scored 34 goals, and Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. Messi won the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s top scorer and his second world player of the year award.\n\nDuring the 2010–11 season Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles. He became the first player to win a third straight world player of the year award. In March 2012, at the age of 24, he scored his 233rd goal. This made him Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer in La Liga play. Messi went on to break a 39-year-old major European football league record when he finished the 2011–12 season with 73 goals in all competitions. This performance led to him being the first player to ever win a fourth world player of the year award.\n\nMessi continued to perform at the highest level. In 2014 he broke the career scoring records for both the Champions League (72 goals) and La Liga (253 goals). Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble in the 2014–15 season, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year award. Over the next four seasons Messi led Barcelona to various championships, including numerous La Liga and Copa del Rey (the main Spanish cup competition) titles. In 2019 he won his sixth world player of the year award. In March 2021 Messi broke a Barcelona club record when he played his 768th game for the team. He won his seventh player of the year award that year as well. After playing for Barcelona for 21 years, Messi left the club in 2021. He went on to play in France for Paris Saint-Germain."
