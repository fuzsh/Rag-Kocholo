Among the prominent names of the 2024 final, at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, was Lionel Messi , who represents the feelings of being part of this great occasion well.\n\nChampion with Argentina at the 2021 tournament and then winner of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the number 10 was one of Lionel Scaloni's starters for this year's Final against Colombia. Just by entering the match, he added another important career record: he is now the player with the most Finals played in at the oldest national team tournament in the world, with five finals (2007, 2015, 2016, 2021 and 2024), surpassing Javier Mascherano, his former Albiceleste teammate.\n\nOn the field, Leo made the expectation of his appearance count. He had Argentina's best chance of the first half, hitting a low shot from a Ángel Di María pass that was deflected. He continued to be very involved in the Argentine attacks, with 43 actions with the ball during the time he was on the field, 3 complete dribbles and 3 ball duels won. He hit 85% of the passes he attempted (28 of 33 attempted), including a decisive pass that generated a shot from Argentina.\n\nIn the second half, Messi endured the fight for another 21 minutes, but there was no way. After leaving everything on the field, he had to be replaced by Nico González, and his frustration was visible. He didn't hold back his tears, he wanted to continue until the end as he did the other times: it is the first time that the number 10 left the field in the finals he played representing his country. And also the first time he has been substituted after starting a CONMEBOL Copa América™ match since 2007 – that is, since his first participation in this competition.\n\nAt the age of 37, and even though he is already part of the select group of champions of CONMEBOL Copa América™, Lionel Messi felt the emotion of wearing the colors of Argentina as if it were the first time. And the meaning of having played in what may be one of his last Finals in national team football - that he can now celebrate as a crowned champions once again.\n\nCONMEBOL.com/OPTA"
