        "text": "Record-Setting Club Career\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17 years old, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest soccer division). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kilograms), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. He became known for his keen passing and precise ball control. In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship. The next year Messi and FC Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.\n\nBy 2008 Messi was one of the most dominant players in the world. He finished second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year. In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping Barcelona capture the club’s first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season). The team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. He scored 38 goals in 51 matches during that season. He bested Ronaldo in the balloting for FIFA World Player of the Year honors by a record margin as well.\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season Messi scored 34 goals in domestic games as Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. He earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer. He was also named the 2010 world player of the year (the award was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or that year).\n\nMessi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles the following season, which helped him capture an unprecedented third consecutive world player of the year award. In March 2012 he netted his 233rd goal for Barcelona. It made him the club’s all-time leading scorer in La Liga play. In 2011–12 he guided the team to another Copa del Rey win. He scored 73 goals in all competitions. With that feat he broke Gerd Müller’s 39-year-old record for single-season goals in a major European soccer league. Messi’s landmark season led to his being named the 2012 world player of the year. He was the first player to win the honor four times.\n\nMessi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season. He led the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honor. He scored 41 goals across all competitions for Barcelona in 2015–16. The club won the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey during that season.\n\nMessi scored 53 goals for Barcelona in 2016–17, leading the team to another Copa del Rey title. In 2017–18 he scored 45 goals, and Barcelona won the La Liga–Copa del Rey double once again. Messi scored 51 goals across all domestic competitions in 2018–19 as Barcelona won another La Liga championship. In December 2019 he won his sixth career world player of the year honor. In the 2020–21 season Barcelona claimed the Copa del Rey title.\n\nMessi became a free agent in 2021. He left Barcelona having become the leading goal scorer in La Liga’s history, with 474 goals. Later that year he signed with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of Ligue 1, the French top-division league. At the end of the year Messi received the world player of the year award for the seventh time. Messi teamed with fellow stars Neymar and Kylian Mbappé to guide PSG to Ligue 1 titles in 2021–22 and 2022–23. In June 2023 Messi announced that he was leaving PSG to relocate to the United States to play for Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer.\n\nNational Team Star\n\nDespite his professional success in Spain and France, Messi’s ties with his homeland remained strong. He was a key member of various Argentine national teams from 2005. He played on Argentina’s victorious 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship squad and represented the country in the 2006 World Cup. He scored two goals in five matches as Argentina swept to the gold medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Messi helped Argentina reach the 2010 World Cup quarterfinals, where the team was eliminated by Germany for the second consecutive time in World Cup play.\n\nAt the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display. He scored four goals as Argentina advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. Argentina lost that contest 1–0 to Germany,. Messi nevertheless won the Golden Ball award as the tournament’s best player.\n\nDuring the 2016 Copa América Centenario tournament, Messi netted his 55th international goal. In doing so, he broke Gabriel Batistuta’s Argentine scoring record. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final, Messi announced that he was quitting the national team. Less than two months later, however, he reversed his decision and rejoined the team. At the 2018 World Cup, Messi made only one goal and two assists as Argentina managed to reach the knockout stage. The team was then eliminated by France. Argentina finished third at the 2019 Copa América, but Messi led the team to victory in the tournament two years later.\n\nAhead of the 2022 World Cup Messi announced that this World Cup—his fifth—would be his last. Messi scored 7 goals in the tournament, pushing his number of career World Cup goals to 13. That made him Argentina’s all-time leading World Cup goal scorer. Argentina shockingly lost its opening match of the tournament to Saudi Arabia, but the team recovered and went undefeated thereafter.\n\nArgentina met France, the defending World Cup champions, in the final. The match became an instant classic. France twice came back to tie the game before Argentina won on penalty kicks. Messi scored two goals in the final to lead Argentine scorers. He was the first player in history to have netted a goal in the group stage, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and final of a single World Cup. Messi was awarded the Golden Ball for a second time, becoming the first two-time winner of the prize. Messi’s outstanding play in the tournament helped earn him his eighth career world player of the year award in 2023.\n\nIn 2024 Messi helped lead the Argentine national team to its second consecutive Copa América title. Argentina defeated Colombia 1–0 in the Copa final."
