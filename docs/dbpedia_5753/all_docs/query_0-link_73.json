        "text": "The moment we’ve been waiting for is almost here. Lionel Messi and Argentina will take center stage on Thursday, June 20, when they take on Canada in the 2024 Copa America inaugural match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nLa Albiceleste head into the tournament as one of, if not the strongest candidate to win the title after claiming the last Copa America in Brazil before tasting the ultimate glory at the Qatar 2022 World Cup.\n\nIt will definitely be a challenging but interesting test for the Canucks, who will be looking to make an impression in this tournament ahead of the 2026 World Cup, in which Canada will act as co-hosts along with the USA and Mexico.\n\nArgentina’s lineup vs Canada\n\nLionel Scaloni reportedly deems seven players untouchable ahead of the Copa America debut. Needless to say, Lionel Messi is one of them, as the coach said more than once the Inter Miami star will always have a guaranteed spot in the lineup barring injury or fitness issues.\n\nLeo Messi in action during a friendly win over Guatemala.\n\nsee also\n\nArgentina vs Canada LIVE: Messi starts, lineups, how to watch 2024 Copa America opening game\n\nArgentina’s predicted lineup: Emiliano Martinez; Nahuel Molina, Cristian Romero, Lisandro Martínez, Marcos Acuña; Rodrigo De Paul, Leandro Paredes, Alexis Mac Allister; Lionel Messi, Julian Alvarez, Angel Di Maria.\n\nCanada’s lineup against Argentina\n\nCanada head into the 2024 Copa America debut with a point to prove after raising concern in the June international friendlies. The Canucks lost 4-0 to the Netherlands but managed to hold Kylian Mbappe’s France to a goalless draw.\n\nSo what’s the real potential of this team? That’s what Jesse Marsch will try to find out in this Copa America, and the debut against none other than the reigning world champs could be very telling."
