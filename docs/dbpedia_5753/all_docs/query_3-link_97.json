        "text": "Lionel Messi, often hailed as the 'greatest footballer of all time,' celebrates his 37th birthday, having recently claimed a record eighth Ballon d'Or and leading Argentina to a World Cup victory in 2022.\n\nNew Delhi: The legendary Argentine footballer Lionel Messi, often hailed as the ‘greatest footballer of all time,’ celebrates his 37th birthday on Monday. Born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1987, Messi recently claimed his eighth Ballon d’Or, setting a new record. The closest to his achievement is Portuguese icon Cristiano Ronaldo, with five Ballon d’Or awards.\n\nAt the tender age of 13, Lionel Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, where the football club played a pivotal role in treating his growth hormone deficiency.\n\nMessi began his journey with FC Barcelona’s U14 squad, quickly rising through the ranks to make his senior team debut at just 17. His meteoric rise saw the Blaugranas lean heavily on his young shoulders. At the time, he became the club’s youngest player to compete in a senior match.\n\nMessi’s illustrious 17-year tenure at Barcelona was nothing short of legendary. During this period, he clinched 10 La Liga titles, 4 Champions League trophies, and 7 Copa del Rey titles. He also set the record for the most goals in La Liga’s history, with an astonishing 474 goals, solidifying his status as the league’s greatest player ever.\n\nIn 2009, Messi celebrated his first UEFA Champions League victory when Barcelona triumphed over Manchester United with a 2-0 scoreline. The Argentine captain scored a memorable header in the final.\n\nIn 2020, Messi made history by scoring his 644th goal for Barcelona in a 3-0 win over Real Valladolid, breaking Brazilian legend Pelé’s record for most goals scored for a single club.\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Messi joined French Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain from 2021 to 2023, scoring 22 goals in 58 games. In 2023, he made a high-profile move to David Beckham’s Inter Miami, where he has since scored 13 goals in 18 matches.\n\nMessi’s international career began in August 2005 with a brief and unfortunate debut against Hungary, where he was sent off shortly after coming on as a substitute. However, he soon redeemed himself on the global stage.\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Messi helped Argentina secure the gold medal, providing the decisive assist in a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in the final. In 2021, he achieved another milestone by winning the Copa America, defeating Brazil 1-0 at the Maracana Stadium, ending his long wait for a major international trophy.\n\nThe pinnacle of Messi’s career came in 2022 when he led Argentina to victory in the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. In a thrilling final against France, Messi scored twice, and Argentina ultimately won via a penalty shootout, capturing their first World Cup title in 36 years."
