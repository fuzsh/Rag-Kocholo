        "text": "MIAMI — Superstar athletes, die-hard fans and, yes, even Shakira will all converge for the soccer world’s highly anticipated Copa América final on Sunday. The storied tournament featuring teams from South America, Central America, North America and the Caribbean will conclude at Hard Rock Stadium, kicking off at 8 p.m. ET as Argentina, the reigning World Cup and Copa América champion, faces fellow heavyweight Colombia.\n\nResale site StubHub said ticket prices were starting at $1,600 as of Thursday evening for what would be a thrilling matchup any year. But this event is different, as it could be global superstar Lionel Messi’s last major appearance for Argentina.\n\n“These are the last battles, and I am enjoying them to the fullest,” Messi said after Tuesday’s semifinal win over Canada. The Inter Miami forward has bowed out of the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics, and the next World Cup is almost two years away.\n\n“Let’s enjoy it,” Messi added. “Let’s enjoy everything that we are experiencing, what is happening to us as a national team, as a community, as a group.”\n\nMessi, 37, known as arguably the greatest soccer player of all time, joined Major League Soccer in 2023 after two seasons at Paris Saint-Germain and more than 20 at Barcelona. He has won a record eight Ballon d’Or awards (signifying the best player in the world) and helped Barcelona win the UEFA Champions League four times. His biggest success, however, came in 2022 when he helped Argentina win the World Cup.\n\nMessi and Argentina will face a red-hot Colombia squad led by surging midfielder James Rodríguez. His team has won a team record 28 straight games, a streak that goes back to February 2022 but could be in trouble without defender Daniel Muñoz. He was sent off following an altercation and second yellow card in the first half of Colombia’s 1-0 win against Uruguay in Wednesday night’s semifinal.\n\nThat matchup finished with fireworks at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina — and not just on the pitch. After the final whistle, the teams began to scuffle before several members of Uruguay’s national team climbed into the stands and began fistfighting with fans.\n\nUruguay defender José María Giménez said the team was protecting family members who were seated in an area surrounded by Colombia fans.\n\n“This is a disaster. This is a disaster. Our family are in danger,” he said. “We had to get on top of the stands ASAP to rescue our loved ones with newborn babies. Everything was a disaster. There was not a single policeman. Officers popped in half an hour later.”\n\nCharlotte police declined to comment and deferred to Bank of America Stadium, which told NBC News that tournament organizers took the lead on event logistics.\n\nIn a statement, Copa América organizers said an investigation has been “opened,” adding that “no action will be tolerated that tarnishes this global football celebration. … It is unacceptable that an incident like this turns passion into violence.”\n\nThe tournament was expected to be a coming-out party for the U.S., but a 2-1 loss to Panama on June 27 was followed by a 1-0 loss to Uruguay. The result eliminated coach Gregg Berhalter’s team — and cost him his job. The disappointing performances led the U.S. Soccer Federation to announce the firing Wednesday.\n\n“Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup,” U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said in a statement, “and we have already begun our search process.”"
