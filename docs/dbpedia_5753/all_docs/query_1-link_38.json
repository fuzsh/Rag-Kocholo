        "text": "Timothy Rapp@ @TRappaRTFeatured Columnist IV\n\nJUAN MABROMATA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nArgentina's fantastic run of international football continued on Tuesday night, as the team defeated Canada 2-0 in the Copa América semifinals, setting up a matchup with either Colombia or Uruguay in the final.\n\nLionel Messi—who scored his first goal of the tournament against the Canadians—couldn't help but be impressed with his squad while speaking to reporters after the match. In particular, he shouted out some of the longtime veterans who have played with him on the national team for a number of years.\n\n\"What this team has done, what the Argentina national team has done, because after this everyone gives more importance to all the finals that me and the 'older guys' have played. Me, Fide [Angel Di María], Ota [Nicolás Otamendi], and that Argentina can play another final is amazing.\n\n\"To be honest it has been a difficult tournament, the level has been as equal as ever, very bad field, high temperatures that make it hard to play, very tough rivals. So the fact we made it and we are here again playing a final is something to enjoy and highlight.\"\n\nArgentina has reached the final for the second straight time and has already won the Copa América 15 times, tied with Uruguay for the most in history. The country is both the defending World Cup and Copa América champions, won the 2022 CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions over Italy, won five of its six World Cup qualifiers in 2023—losing only to Uruguay—and has yet to lose in 2024 between friendlies and Copa América, with eight wins and a draw.\n\nSuffice to say, the men's national team has been on an absolute heater. Messi is obviously at the center of that, though it remains unclear if he will call it quits on his international career following the Copa.\n\n\"We leave them calm from our part, we won't be the ones to close the door on them,\" manager Lionel Scaloni said of the uncertain international futures of Messi and Di María. \"[Messi] can be with us until he wants, and even after he retires he can join me if I'm still coach. And if not I'll take him where I go. He would be a great help.\""
