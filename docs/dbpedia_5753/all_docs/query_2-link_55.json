        "text": "Argentina and Colombia will play on July 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida to determine the tournament winner and runner-up.\n\nThe Final could be the last edition for the 33-year-old James Rodriguez and 37-year-old Lionel Messi.\n\nA brilliant Final awaits fans at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on July 14 between defending champions Argentina and the high-flying attack of Colombia. It’s been an incredible run to the competition's last game for both countries, who have been led by their legendary creative captains.\n\nFor Argentina, it’s Lionel Messi. The Rosario born playmaker, who is already considered by many the greatest player to ever play the game, won his first CONMEBOL Copa América™ at the 2021 edition, and is looking for his second continental trophy. Argentina’s number 10 was instrumental in helping his country reach the Grand Final, leading the entire competition in big chances created (7) and the second most key passes (15) providing a creative spark for La Albiceleste. The former FC Barcelona and current Inter Miami midfielder overcame an injury in the Group Stage and was still one of the tournament’s most influential players.\n\nIn what could be his last CONMEBOL Copa América™, and what will certainly be the last edition for teammate and friends Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi, the 2022 FIFA World Cup winner will look to make his country the most successful team in the competition’s history with a victory in the final.\n\nOn the other side of the pitch, Colombia’s James Rodriguez has been a revelation for Los Cafeteros. Rodriguez has already broken Messi’s record for the most assists in a single edition with six recorded, and will be eager to earn his country their first title since 2001.\n\nBorn in Cucuta, Colombia, the midfielder burst onto the scene after helping his country in a fantastic run at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Throughout his career, Rodriguez has played for massive clubs such as FC Porto, Monaco, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Everton. The 33-year-old and his Colombian team currently have a team-record 28 game unbeaten streak going into the final, which was tested but never broken during the tournament. Rodriguez, who is a massive part in his country’s successful tournament run, leads the competition in key passes (17) and is second in big chances created (5).\n\nNow the two captains meet in the Grand Final, which should be a wonderful spectacle for all those in the stadium and watching at home.\n\nThe 10’s have met at the world’s oldest national team tournament twice before, during the 2015 edition Quarterfinals in which Argentina won on penalties, with both players converting their shots in the penalty shootout. The other in the 2019 edition in the Group Stage, where Colombia would win 2-0, and Rodriguez would register an assist.\n\nNow in the 2024 edition with two special teams headlining the match and everything on the line. The two legendary captains should help create one of the most memorable tournament conclusions in recent memory.\n\nTickets are still available here."
