        "text": "Lionel Messi has revealed that he will end his career at Inter Miami, saying the Major League Soccer side will be his “last club”.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with ESPN Argentina, the 36-year-old admitted “there’s not a lot of time left” in his career, adding that he feels “a bit of fear” about the day he decides to hang up his boots.\n\nMessi, who moved to Miami from Paris Saint-German last summer on a contract until 2025, confirmed that the MLS side “is going to be my last club”.\n\nTransfers\n\nMan Utd to make renewed attempt to sign De Jong, Toney attracting Saudi interest - Paper Round\n\nan hour ago\n\n\"I've done this all of my life; I love playing ball,” he said.\n\n“I enjoy the practices and the day-to-day, the games. Yeah, there's a bit of fear that it's all ending. It's always there. It was a difficult step leaving Europe to come here [to Miami].”\n\nMessi, widely considered as one of the greatest footballers to ever play the sport, has won 40 trophies for club and country. He is Barcelona’s all-time top scorer with 672 goals and scored 32 more in a two-year spell with PSG.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d’Or winner finally won the World Cup, the one trophy that eluded him for so long, with Argentina in 2022.\n\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - DECEMBER 18: Lionel Messi of Argentina celebrates with the World Cup Trophy during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Final match between Argentina and France at Lusail Stadium on December 18, 2022 in Lusail City, Qatar.

But I try not to think about it. I try to enjoy it. I do that more now because I'm aware that there's not a lot of time left. So I have a good time with the club, being lucky having good teammates and friends at my side.\n\n\"I enjoy my time with the national team, where I also have good friends, too, and a lot. I enjoy those small details that I know I'll miss when I stop playing.\"\n\nMessi also responded to recent comments made by his former PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe, who suggested that the Euros is a more difficult tournament than the World Cup.\n\n“Well, everybody prioritises their tournament,\" Messi said in response to the France striker's remarks.\n\n\"Obviously, the Euro is very important and has the best teams, but he's leaving out three-time [world] champion Argentina, five-time champion Brazil, two-time champion Uruguay. There are a lot of world champions left off to say that it's the most difficult tournament.\n\n\"The best teams play in the World Cup, which generally includes all the world champions. There's a reason everybody wants to be champions.\"\n\nMessi is preparing to lead Argentina in their Copa America defence in the US, with the tournament kicking off on June 20.\n\nHe made his return to international football for the first time in six months last week, helping Argentina to a 1-0 win over Ecuador, after missing his country’s previous two matches against El Salvador and Costa Rica in March.\n\nArgentina take on Canada in their opening match of the Copa America group stage, before facing Chile and Peru.\n\n- - -\n\nTNT Sports presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Investec Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing and WWE.
