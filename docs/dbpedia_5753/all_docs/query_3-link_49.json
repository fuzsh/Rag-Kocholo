        "text": "Lionel Messi admitted he knows that his days taking to the pitch as a professional footballer are winding down after helping Argentina reach another Copa America final. The legendary forward reflected on cherishing the final days of his international career with his teammates while he still can.\n\nArgentina clinched a 2-0 victory against Canada, with Julian Alvarez lighting up the scoreboard early in the first half and Messi sealing the deal in the 51st minute. During his post-match interview, Messi spoke about savoring each moment in the iconic Albiceleste jersey, acknowledging that his time on the pitch won't last forever.\n\n“I am aware that these are the last few battles, that is why I am enjoying it very much,\" said Messi. \"Let's enjoy everything that we are living and enjoying as a national team. It is not easy to get to another final.\n\nREAD MORE: Lionel Messi leaves opponent looking foolish while doing what Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't\n\nREAD MORE: Man Utd star Lisandro Martinez left feeling unimpressed by Kylian Mbappe’s comments\n\n\"We have to take advantage because it's not something easy These are some of my last battles and I have to enjoy.\"\n\nExpanding into further detail, Messi said, \"It's crazy what this group has been doing, what the Argentine National Team has been doing, because a lot of importance is being given to the finals that I and all of the old team played in. It's amazing that we're in a new final. It wasn't an easy cup: very tough teams, very bad pitches, the heat makes it very hard. It's worth enjoying being in a new final.\"\n\nMessi, who turned 37 last month, acknowledged that performing consistently is becoming increasingly difficult at this career stage. However, after returning to his teammates in the locker room, the Argentine hero shifted gears from reflection to motivation. Rallying his team, Messi excited the energy in the room and his teammates and declared: \"We still have one more step to go.\"\n\nArgentina will face Uruguay or Colombia in the Copa America final in Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14. Albiceleste, which has clinched the title 15 times, is tied with Uruguay for the most victories in the competition's history. A win in the upcoming final would see Argentina emerge as the top nation in tournament history, solidifying their dominance in South American football.\n\nThe career of Messi with Argentina is decorated with multiple notable achievements. He helped lead his nation to glory as the 2022 FIFA World Cup champion, the 2021 Copa America winner, and the 2022 UEFA Cup of Champions winner with a 3-0 win over Mexico."
