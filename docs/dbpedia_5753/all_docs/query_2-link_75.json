        "text": "Lionel Messi will not play for Argentina during their final Copa América group stage match against Peru on Saturday in Miami.\n\nThe Argentina star was ruled out after suffering a right thigh injury during their 1-0 win over Chile on Tuesday night. Messi was seen getting treatment on the sideline in the first half and also disclosed after the game he was dealing with right hamstring discomfort.\n\nMessi, who turned 37 on Monday, has played all 180 minutes during Argentina's two wins, putting them atop Group A and already through to the knockout portion of the tournament.\n\nHe did not take part in Argentina's training session on Thursday and head coach Lionel Scaloni already said after the Chile match that changes were in order for his lineup against Peru.\n\nCanada plays Chile in the other Group A match on Saturday.\n\nShould Argentina, as expected, hold on to the top spot in the group, they will move on to face the second-place team in Group B, which could be any of Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico, or Jamaica depending on how their results go on Sunday.\n\nScaloni suspended for Peru match\n\nCONMEBOL's disciplinary commission has suspended the Argentina manager one match due to the team's lateness returning to the field for the second half in both of their group stage games.\n\nScaloni will also not be permitted to speak to the press after Saturday's match against Peru.\n\nCopa América rules state that players must return to the field promptly after halftime. Argentina had already been warned once after their opening match against Canada."
