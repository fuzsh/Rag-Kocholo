        "text": "SOLDIER FIELD — Lionel Messi’s soccer team is once again scheduled to play a match at Soldier Field, giving fans another opportunity to see the legend in Chicago.\n\nArgentina’s national soccer team will face Ecuador in an exhibition match June 9 at Soldier Field. The national team, led by Messi, will compete in a series of friendly matches in the United States ahead of the Copa America tournament between North and South American countries, Soccer United Marketing announced Monday.\n\nGeneral-admission tickets to the Argentina-Ecuador game go on sale 10 a.m. Monday via ticketmaster.com; pre-sale for American Express cardholders opens 10 a.m. Friday.\n\nThe Soldier Field match could be Messi’s debut in Chicago since joining MLS’s Inter Miami last year. The Inter Miami-Chicago Fire match in October saw ticket prices soar well above normal for a Fire game as fans traveled from all over to see Messi, considered one of the best soccer players of all time.\n\nMessi sat out the match with a leg injury, but more than 62,000 people attended the match despite his absence, making it the largest crowd for a Fire game in the club’s history.\n\nThe Argentine superstar, 36, has pledged to play for his home country during this summer’s Copa America tournament. But there is no guarantee he will play in the Chicago exhibition match leading up to the tournament.\n\nOther Argentina friendly matches are scheduled for this spring and summer in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and the suburbs of Washington, D.C., according to the Sun-Times.\n\nMessi led Argentina to a World Cup win in 2022. He won last year’s Ballon d’Or award, given to the best soccer player in the world, and last year’s Best FIFA Men’s Player award. His eight Ballon d’Or trophies are the most of any player in history."
