        "text": "Lionel Messi, who is set to join Inter Miami, has officially confirmed that he will not participate in the upcoming FIFA World Cup, scheduled to take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 2026.\n\nThe Argentine footballer recently achieved his ultimate goal of winning the World Cup by leading his national team to a dramatic victory in Qatar 2022, beating France in the final 4-2 on penalties after a 3-3 draw in normal and extra time.\n\nMessi's triumph has led many to believe that the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner had accomplished all there is to achieve in football.\n\nTransfers\n\nMessi could become co-owner of Inter Miami with Beckham – Paper Round\n\n06/04/2024 at 07:10\n\nAnd at the age of 35, Messi has decided that he won't compete in the prestigious international tournament, confirming his decision on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of featuring in the 2026 World Cup, Messi told Chinese media outlet Titan Sports, \"I think not.\" He added, \"This was my last World Cup. I will see how things go, but in principle, no, I will not go to the next World Cup.\"\n\nMessi expressed his desire to be present as a spectator during the competition but clarified that he will more likely than not be participating as a player.\n\nGiven Messi's expected move to Inter Miami, it would be convenient for him to witness the World Cup on home soil, should his plans in the Major League Soccer (MLS) unfold as intended. According to reports, Messi is set to sign a two-and-a-half-year contract with Inter Miami, the franchise co-owned by David Beckham, with an option to extend until 2026.\n\nArgentina boss Lionel Scaloni has previously said that Messi would be a part of his plans at the next World Cup, saying when asked about the chances of his captain being a part of the squad that will defend the title: “We have the door open for him and if we see no, we’ll look for an alternative. I hope he makes it to the next World Cup, I can see him there, but I think the first thing is to qualify.”\n\nAlthough he will not be competing in the next World Cup as he approaches his 38th birthday, Messi is likely to play a crucial role in Argentina's attempt to defend their Copa America title at the next edition of the tournament, scheduled to take place in the summer of 2024, also in the United States.\n\nWhile Messi suffered disappointments in previous Copa America campaigns, including three heartbreaking final defeats, he finally achieved success in 2021, defeating Brazil to claim the trophy.\n\nFootball\n\n'The moment I feel I am no longer able to perform' - Messi hints at retirement plans\n\n27/03/2024 at 13:24\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nFrance boss Henry warns of 'long journey' as groups drawn for Olympic football\n\n20/03/2024 at 23:16"
