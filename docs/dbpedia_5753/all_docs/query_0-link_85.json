        "text": "CHICAGO (WLS) -- Soccer fans packed Soldier Field Sunday night as superstar Lionel Messi visited Chicago.\n\nMessi got limited playing time in the friendly match between Argentina and Ecuador, but fans still had Messi fever.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nArgentina manager Lionel Scaloni suggested Lionel Messi would likely be a substitute in Sunday's friendly against Ecuador at Soldier Field in Chicago to ensure the player remains healthy for Copa América.\n\n\"People will be able to see Messi... He will surely play for a while. We are going to think carefully about the minutes that each one will have to be healthy for the debut,\" Scaloni said in his pre-match news conference. \"Messi I imagine he will play, I don't know if the whole game, 30 minutes, 60, whatever. But people are going for it to be able to see what is the most important thing.\"\n\nArgentina fans were in downtown in big numbers, with many wearing the jersey of Messi. Over 51,000 fans showed up to the game.\n\n\"If he scores, that's life-changing for me,\" Argentina fan Martin Juarez said. \"I grew up playing soccer. I look up to him.\"\n\nSome fans were overwhelmed as the Inter Miami star took the field in Chicago.\n\n\"I'm a big Messi fan,\" Argentina fan Wilson Mendez said. \"It's my dream to see him play in person.\"\n\nIn the Loop, hundreds of Messi fans crowded the doors of the Blackstone Hotel Sunday afternoon, hoping to catch a glimpse of the superstar leaving to board the bus for the short ride to Soldier Field.\n\nSEE ALSO | Historic Chicago Red Stars soccer match at Wrigley Field breaks NWSL attendance record\n\nThe Argentina fanbase was not to be outdone by Ecuador fans who were also in the windy city in big numbers, wearing yellow jerseys to show their national pride outside Soldier Field before the match.\n\nSome Ecuador fans drove four hours from Ohio for the game.\n\n\"We couldn't miss the game,\" Ecuador fan Lexi Bonifaz said.\n\nFans without a ticket also crowded into some Chicago bars to catch the action on TV.\n\n\"Anytime Messi plays, there's interest,\" said Charlie Jaimes with Birra N. \"Any time people can get to see their idol play, they're gonna be there.\"\n\nThings get a lot more serious for Argentina and Ecuador in a week and a half. That's when the COPA tournament begins. Argentina is the defending champion, and they'll be playing in this country for the second time in the tournament's history.\n\nMessi last played for Argentina as a substitute on Oct. 12, 2023, coming off the bench in the 1-0 victory against Paraguay at the Estadio Monumental in Argentina.\n\nArgentina has yet to announce its final 26-player roster for the Copa América, waiting until these friendlies to make the final cuts.\n\nESPN contributed to this report."
