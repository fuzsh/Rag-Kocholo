        "text": "It was in 1986 in India when I saw the late Diego Maradona, the Argentinian soccer legend, lift the FIFA world cup. They beat Germany 3–2. This was Argentina’s 2nd world cup since the last one in 1978. Even though India does not participate in the FIFA world cup, many fans follow teams from Latin America, primarily Argentina and Brazil. I happen to be an Argentina fan because of the late Diego Maradona. After he retired, I started following Lionel Messi.\n\nI admit that I only followed Messi briefly because Argentina had not won a world cup for a while. However, they came close to winning in 1990 and 2014 but lost to Germany in both finals 1–0. Interest began when Argentina won the COPA America final in 2021 by defeating hosts Brazil 1–0. Messi was awarded the golden boot as he scored four goals and had five assists out of 14 Argentina goals in the tournament.\n\nThen there were rumors that the 2022 world cup might be Messi’s last. So, when the world cup started in Qatar, I started watching the games with the hope that Argentina would win for the third time and Messi would retire with a world cup win, a desire held by most soccer players.\n\nOn December 18th, 2022, the dream became a reality when Argentina defeated France 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out, and Messi checked the last box of his career.\n\nAs an ardent fan of Messi, I created Tableau Visualization depicting his Soccer journey. Click on the link to view it. Lionel Messi | Tableau Public\n\nEarly years\n\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987. In Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, to a tight-knit, football-loving family. At a very early age, he developed a passion for football, playing with his older brothers and cousins. When he was four years old, he joined the Grandoli club. After a few years, he joined Newell’s Old Boys Club, scoring almost 500 goals.\n\nIt was his grandmother who motivated Messi to play soccer. It was she who used to take him to soccer practice. Messi was attached to her a lot. Her death when Messi was just 11 years had a significant impact. He stopped playing soccer for weeks, and later, he started playing again as he realized that he had to make her grandmother proud. Since then, he has been a devout Roman Catholic and celebrates and pays tribute to his grandmother when he scores a goal by looking up and pointing to the sky.\n\nAt age 10, Messi got diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, for which medical treatment was necessary if Messi wanted to pursue a professional soccer career. His father’s insurance covered the medical treatment for a couple of years, but after that, Messi’s family could not afford to pay for it. During this time, Messi continued to play passionately, and his medical condition seemed not an excuse for him to stop playing.\n\nHe was so good that Club Barcelona noticed him and signed him for a trial period. The contract agreement (which he signed on a paper napkin) stated that if he passed the trial period, the club would pay for his medical bills, and he would have to relocate to Spain, which he finally did.\n\nProfessional Club Career\n\nMessi’s journey at Club Barcelona began in 2003 when he played for the Barcelona C team. In 2004, at 17, he became the youngest player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga (The top soccer division in Spain) when playing for Barcelona. Though Messi was one the shortest players (5ft 7 inches) and weighed only 147 pounds, he proved strong, well-balanced, and versatile. His teammates observed that he had excellent dribbling skills and easily penetrated the opposition’s defense. In addition, he was an unselfish player who liked to pass the ball instead of scoring the goal.\n\nMessi played 778 matches for Barcelona, scoring 672 goals and winning 10 La Liga and four UEFA Champion league titles. He won many awards, but the most significant was that he was the recipient of seven Ballon d’Or titles. In 2021 he left Barcelona because his contract ended, and Barcelona could not extend his contract because of financial issues. The same year Paris Saint-Germain F.C. (PSG) offered him a 2-year contract (set to expire in 2023). He won twice the Ligue 1 title in 2022–23 and then in 2021–22 alongside his teammates Kylian Mbappe and Neymar.\n\nWorld Cup Career\n\nMessi has played for Argentina’s National team. This is despite his having Spain citizenship. He was informally asked if he would like to play for Spain, but he answered, “I wanted to play for my national team because I love Argentina, and these are the only colors I want to wear. I was always an avid fan of the national team. I watched the games on television because I could never go to the grounds and watch them as a fan.”\n\nMessi played in five World Cups starting in 2006. He played 26 matches, of which he won 16 and lost five. The remaining five were a draw. He has received the Golden Ball award twice (2014 and 2022). He holds a record of being captain of Argentina in 19 of 26 games. Messi has scored 13 goals, out of which seven were in the last world cup.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMessi’s soccer journey has been full of commitment, hard work, and passion for becoming the world’s number one soccer player. From childhood, he was driven to play soccer professionally and nationally. He did not make his health issue an excuse to stop playing soccer. Instead, he continued to stay focused and work towards winning the World Cup for Argentina.\n\nHis desire to win was reflected in the recently concluded world cup final. Messi did not want the same result repeated after Argentina’s losses in the 2014 World Cup, 2015 Copa America, and 2016 Copa America Centenario. He contributed by scoring three goals (including a penalty shoot-out) and rallied his team players to ensure that after 36 years, the world cup was back in possession for Argentina.\n\nWith Messi winning the world cup for Argentina, it was not just Argentinians celebrating but other nations like India, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia, where Messi is followed and idolized. In fact, with this accomplishment, Messi became the second person after Cristiano Ronaldo on the planet to hit 400 million followers on Instagram.\n\nUltimately, I would like to say that Messi has been a true patriot for his country. This humble and down-to-earth person contributes wealth via Leo Messi Foundation to provide healthcare services to improve children’s lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he donated one million euros to be shared between Hospital Clinic in Catalunya and another health center in Argentina.\n\nIn addition, he demonstrated his loyalty and sincerity to Club Barcelona by refusing contracts from other clubs offering him more and taking a 70 percent cut along with his teammates during the pandemic to ensure non-playing staff was paid fully. He remembered that Club Barcelona paid for his medical treatment (when other clubs had refused) and gave him the first break when he started his professional career.\n\nSpeculations were that Messi would leave PSG and join a club in Saudi Arabia. This was because the club offered him a lucrative deal of $383 — $656 million. I hoped Barcelona could match it and bring him back, but it did not happen. The latest is that Messi joins the Inter-Miami club and plays in the USA’s Major League Soccer (MLS). The Miami Herald has reported that the deal is valued between $125 million and $150 million over 2.5 years. In addition, Apple (MLS Broadcast partner) and Adidas (MLS major league sponsor) have signed profit-sharing agreements with Messi.\n\nI expect Messi to play for a few more years; probably, the 2026 world cup would be his last, and hand the reigns to an upcoming motivated individual like him. He would want to ensure the Argentina soccer team is in safe hands before he retires.\n\nIn the end, I would want to quote the words of Pep Guardiola (Manchester City — Manager) and what he said about Messi.\n\n“Don’t write about him, don’t try to describe him. Just watch him.”"
