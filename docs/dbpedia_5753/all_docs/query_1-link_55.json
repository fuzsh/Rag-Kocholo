        "text": "Argentina and Ecuador are set to kick off the 2024 Copa America knockout phase. Argentina, despite winning all three of their games, has underwhelmed. Lionel Scaloni has also needed to make adjustments during the group stage due to Lionel Messi‘s slight knock.\n\nMessi has been suffering from a sore right hamstring, an injury that has bothered him during the first half of the MLS season. While Messi has been training lightly, he did miss Argentina’s last group stage match against Peru and was initially doubtful for the match against Ecuador.\n\nHowever, it looks like the Inter Miami superstar is ready to get back to the field. According to Argentine national team insider Gaston Edul of TyC Sports, Leo’s round-the-clock rehab has worked, and Lionel Messi is slated to start against Ecuador tonight.\n\nMessi starts: Argentina’s lineup vs Ecuador\n\nWith Messi on the team, here’s Argentina’s starting eleven to play Ecuador in the 2024 Copa America quarterfinals: Emiliano Martinez; Nahuel Molina, Cristian Romero, Lisandro Martinez, Nicolas Tagliafico; Rodrigo de Paul, Alexis Mac Allister, Enzo Fernandez, Nicolas Gonzalez; Lionel Messi, Lautaro Martinez.\n\nEcuador and Argentina have met multiple times in the Copa America, with Argentina historically holding the upper hand in their encounters, showcasing their dominance in the tournament.\n\nLionel Messi #10 of Argentina controls the ball against Moises Caicedo #23 of Ecuador in the second half during an International Friendly match at Soldier Field on June 09, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nsee also\n\nWhere to watch Argentina vs Ecuador live in the USA today: Copa America 2024 quarterfinals\n\nLionel Messi has scored 13 goals in Copa America tournaments, making him the all-time top scorer for Argentina in Copa America history.\n\nKelvin Loyola is a seasoned content writer and journalist at Bolavip, boasting over 15 years of experience in sports journalism and marketing.
