        "text": "CHRIS ARJOON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAfter missing Argentina's final game of the group stage against Peru on Saturday, Lionel Messi has returned to training, but his status for Thursday's Copa América quarterfinal matchup is still uncertain, per The Athletic's Felipe Cardenas.\n\nAccording to Cardenas, Messi returned to full training and participated in the team's full session on Monday.\n\nArgentina, the defending Copa América champions, will face Ecuador in its first match of the knockout round.\n\nMessi has missed six games of the MLS season so far this year with various injuries, most recently a leg injury in May.\n\nDespite the missed time, Messi has 12 goals on the year, tied for the fourth most in the league this season. He also has the second most assists in MLS with 13.\n\nDespite being without Messi for the final game of the group stages, Argentina won comfortably against Peru to cap off a strong showing through the first three games. Argentina won all three group stage games to win Group A and advance to the quarterfinal with plenty of momentum.\n\nBut now it will face a strong Ecuador team, which picked up a win, draw and loss in the group stages. With a win, it would advance to face the winner of undefeated Venezuela vs. Canada."
