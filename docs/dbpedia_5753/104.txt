Messi started playing soccer at a young age and joined the youth team of Newell's Old Boys when he was just five years old. He quickly rose through the ranks and made his professional debut for the team in 2004, at the age of 17. In 2005, he signed with Barcelona and became a key player for the club. Over the next few years, Messi helped Barcelona win several titles, including the La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League.

In 2009, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or, an award given to the best soccer player in the world. He went on to win the award six more times, a record in the history of the award. In 2012, he scored 91 goals in a calendar year, breaking the previous record of 85 goals set by German striker Gerd Müller in 1972.

In addition to his success with Barcelona, Messi has also had a successful international career with the Argentine national team. He has helped lead Argentina to several international titles, including the 2008 Olympic gold medal and the 2014 World Cup final.

Growing up, Messi faced many difficulties, including a growth hormone deficiency that threatened to end his soccer career before it even began. His family could not afford the treatment he needed to overcome this obstacle, but Messi did not let this stop him. With the help of his family and the support of his coaches and teammates, he continued to work hard and pursue his dream of becoming a professional soccer player.

Despite his success, Messi faced criticism and doubters early in his career, who claimed that he was too small and not strong enough to succeed at the highest level. But he never let this get to him, and instead used it as motivation to work even harder. Through his relentless determination and his tireless effort on the field, he proved the doubters wrong and became one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.
