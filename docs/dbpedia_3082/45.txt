Dawn Wells

A Biography

Dawn Wells is an actress, producer, author, spokesperson, journalist, motivational speaker, and teacher. Most of you know her as "Mary Ann” on “Gilligan's Island,” the longest running sitcom still showing worldwide in over 30 languages; however, there is so much more to Dawn Wells than "Mary Ann". Dawn released a book “What Would Mary Ann Do?” in September 2014 to coincide with the 50th Anniversary of the premiere of “Gilligan’s Island.” The book is part self-help, part memoir and part humor - with a little classic TV nostalgia thrown in for good measure.

Dawn was born and raised in Reno, Nevada. Dawn had dreamed of being a ballerina but bad knees prevented her from pursuing this dream. She attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, where she majored in chemistry. However, she then transferred to University of Washington in Seattle, where she graduated with a degree in theatre arts and design. In 1959, she competed and won in the Miss Nevada pageant and went on to compete in the 1960 Miss America pageant. After graduating University of Washington, Dawn moved to Hollywood to start her acting career.

Dawn has done over 150 Television shows, over 70 theatrical productions, and a number of Feature Films. She was Co-Executive producer of one of the highest rated CBS movie-of-the-week, “Surviving Gilligan’s Island,” in which she starred and hosted.

In 2013, for the premiere of Sandra Bullock’s movie Gravity, Dawn presented her with a Coconut Cream Pie, as the two women both know what it’s like to be stranded. Dawn has been a guest “Chef Du Jour" for a week on the TV Food Network (which is no surprise), as she has also written her first cookbook called, “Mary Ann's Gilligan's Island Cookbook" and her second cookbook is due out soon. Dawn has co-produced and hosted the Children's Miracle Network Broadcast for 15 years in Mid-Missouri as well as her own female fishing show called, "Dawn Wells' Reel Adventures," on which she has gone fly fishing all over the world.

One of Dawn’s most exciting endeavors was establishing the Dawn Wells Film Actors Boot Camp in Driggs, ID, where for one-week intensive sessions during the summer, up-and-coming actors learned the art of Acting on Camera as well as the business of the Film Industry.
