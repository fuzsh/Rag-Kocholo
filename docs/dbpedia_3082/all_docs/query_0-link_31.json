        "text": "Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann Summers on the campy, classic TV show \"Gilligan's Island,\" has died from COVID-19, ABC News confirmed. She was 82.\n\nHer representative noted in a statement that the actress, motivational speaker and philanthropist \"passed peacefully [Wednesday] morning, in no pain as a result of complications due to Covid.\"\n\nTV fans will remember Wells as the wholesome, \"girl next door\" castaway counterpart to Tina Louise's Marilyn Monroe-clone movie star Ginger Grant on \"Gilligan's Island,\" which ran for three seasons from 1964 to 1967 on CBS.\n\nLouise is now the last surviving cast member from the beloved series. All the other stars -- Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer, Russell Johnson and narrator Charles Maxwell -- have previously died.\n\nWells, a former Miss Nevada, made many stage and screen appearances after her pageant days, but it was her stint on the famously popular sitcom -- which saw seven castaways stranded on a deserted island after a three-hour boat tour gone awry -- that cemented her pop culture status.\n\nIn fact, Wells' rep noted in a statement, \"Dawn's gingham dress and famous belly button covering shorts worn on 'Gilligan's Island' are currently on display in the lobby of The Hollywood Museum.\"\n\nWells remained close with the character and its legacy. A constant at autograph signings at pop culture conventions, she published a self-help book in 2014 called \"What Would Mary Ann Do? A Guide to Life.\"\n\nIn it, she noted, \"It’s not my ego talking, but Mary Ann wasn't just a silly and sweet ingenue. She was bright, fair-minded and reasonable. Sherwood Schwartz, the show’s producer and creator, was smart enough to put her in short shorts so you wouldn’t think of her as your bossy sister.\""
