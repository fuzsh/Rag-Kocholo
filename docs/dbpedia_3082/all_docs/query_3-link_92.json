        "text": "Fans of the often zany '60s television sitcoms will instantly recognize “Gilligan’s Island” star Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann Summers, the perky Kansas farm girl shipwrecked on an uncharted Pacific island with six other castaways, including a professor, a movie star and a millionaire.\n\nFifty-one years after the show first aired, some still humorously speculate on the castaways’ fate. Wells offers one possibility in her recent short film, “She’s Still on That Freakin’ Island.”\n\n“I’ve just started a production company called CarterWells Entertainment, and we were looking for projects,” Wells said from Los Angeles. “Terry Ray, a writer and actor, approached me with the idea of doing a short film about Mary Ann, and I just loved it.”\n\nView the video here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5PRtT9dE9k\n\nDespite the obvious connection to the popular TV series, Wells said she and Ray refrained from using the characters’ names to avoid any copyright issues.\n\nThe film opens with Wells sitting on the beach sipping coconut cocktails, as a waterlogged man in tuxedo (Ray) scrambles ashore through the waves, having fallen off a boat. Their conversation soon drifts into quaint “Gilligan’s Island” references, providing a dose of nostalgic charm for fans of the show.\n\n“There’s a reference to ‘Pass the Vegetables, Please,’ a popular episode where everyone gets superhuman powers after eating vegetables grown from radiated seeds that Gilligan finds,” Wells said.\n\nThere’s also some witty payback for the writers of the well-known first season theme lyrics, which famously relegated Wells and Russell Johnson, who played the professor, to “the rest” in the opening credits.\n\n“Fans will appreciate that,” said Wells, indicating that her wardrobe was another subtle nod to co-star and longtime friend Johnson.\n\n“He always wore a pale-blue shirt during the show’s run. So I went to Goodwill for a similar one, sewed on some patches, and wore it.”\n\nWhile Mary Ann was sometimes seen wearing \"short shorts,\" Wells, who turned 77 this year, complemented the shirt with blue jeans for the film.\n\n“I actually have a pair of the original shorts from the show, but I’m not sure if they would fit me now.”\n\nThe film, just under six minutes, was shot in one day by the crew of four, including Leonard Carter as director, cinematographer and editor. The team rolled onto a stretch of California beach between Malibu and Paradise Cove around 8 a.m. on Oct. 20.\n\n“Everyone involved just volunteered their time, and we finished by midafternoon,” Wells said. “Filming was fairly straightforward, with the sound from the wind and waves being the only technical difficulties.”\n\nWhile shooting, she observed about 50 seagulls nearby at the water’s edge.\n\n“Suddenly, a baby seal crawled up onto the beach, and the birds surrounded it as it flapped its little tail,” Wells said. “It lay there for about 45 minutes, then disappeared into the water again. It felt like we were really on an island with no one else around.”\n\nAfter posting the film on her Facebook page, fans seemed delighted. “An adorable riot!” wrote one. “It is too darn cute,” claimed another.\n\n“After all these years, ‘Gilligan’s Island’ is still loved around the world,” Wells said. “It was a show about seven people from various walks of life who were thrown together and had to adapt to get along despite their differences. That’s a lesson we can all learn.”\n\nNick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Alabama, and has written features, columns and interviews for over 600 magazines and newspapers.
