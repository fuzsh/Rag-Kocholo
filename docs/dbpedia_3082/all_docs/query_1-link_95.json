        "text": "Dawn Wells, the actress who played Mary Ann on the CBS sitcom “Gilligan’s Island,” died Wednesday at the age of 82 in Los Angeles due to COVID-19.\n\nHer death was announced by her publicist Harlan Boll, Variety reports. She is survived by her stepsister Weslee Wells.\n\nWells was a native of Reno, Nev., reports Variety, and represented Nevada in the 1959 Miss America pageant before embarking on a long television career.\n\nShe played the character of Mary Ann Summers on “Gilligan’s Island” from 1964 to 1967. With Wells’s passing, fellow “Gilligan’s Island” co-star Tina Louise is the last surviving main cast member of the show.\n\nVariety notes that apart from her acting work, she was also a producer on several TV movies such as “Surviving Gilligan’s Island” and “Return to the Bat Cave.”\n\nSeveral people in the entertainment industry expressed their sadness at Wells’s death online.\n\n“It was such a thrill for me to meet Dawn Wells when she came to see Two and a Half Men. She could not have been more lovely and gracious,” actor Jon Cryer wrote.\n\nActress Erin Murphy, who played Tabitha Stephens on “Bewitched,” wrote, “Absolutely devastated to share the news that my lifelong friend, Dawn Wells, has passed away. She was feisty, funny, talented and beautiful.”\n\nAccording to Variety, those who wish to pay their respects have been asked to donate to the Elephant Sanctuary, Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum or the Shambala Preserve."
