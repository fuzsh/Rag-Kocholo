        "text": "Actress Dawn Wells, who performed at St. Petersburg dinner theaters more times than any other celebrity, died in Los Angeles Wednesday of complications from Covid-19. She was 82.\n\nWells was best known as perky Mary Ann, one of the seven castaways on the classic TV series Gilligan’s Island (1964-67).\n\nTwo years after the series’ cancellation, Wells became the first “name” actor to perform at the then-new Showboat Dinner Theatre, opened by Village Inn founder Dow Sherwood on Ulmerton Road.\n\nWells’ first show here was the comedy The Owl and the Pussycat.\n\nShe maintained a home on Redington Shores for a time in the 1970s, and briefly dated Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary founder Ralph Heath.\n\nBetween that first appearance at the Showboat and the mid 1980s, Wells performed at the Showboat, and at the rival Country Dinner Playhouse in the Gateway Mall, six times.\n\nHer death leaves Tina Louise, 86, as the last surviving member of the Gilligan’s Island cast."
