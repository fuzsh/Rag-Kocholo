        "text": "By Movieguide® Staff\n\nTV producer Lloyd J. Schwartz recently reflected on GILLIGAN’S ISLAND star Dawn Wells and her unmatched relationship with fans of the classic show.\n\nThe 75-year-old told Fox News that Wells, who played Mary Ann in GILLIGAN’S ISLAND, received more fan mail than any other actor on the show.\n\n“Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann, got five times the fan mail than everybody else,” he said. “She was the only normal person in the show. She was the one everyone identified with. All the other folks were extreme characters. But Mary Ann seemed like the girl next door.\n\n“The girls loved her because she was like their best friend. And the guys loved her because she was cute and accessible to them. Ginger (Tina Louis) was a voluptuous movie star,” he added. “She almost seemed untouchable to mere mortals. But Mary Ann was the cute one who you could easily be friends with.”\n\nSchwartz’s father created the persevering classic GILLIGAN’S ISLAND and THE BRADY BUNCH. The younger Schwartz said he cherished the short time they worked together.\n\n“I was only on very briefly, and I was very young,” he said. “But I grew up knowing the show had a special connection with people. My dad always said that a tropical island has been the center of many famous stories, including ‘Swiss Family Robinson.’\n\n“And the story was special because it was about people from different walks of life learning together,” he added. “They had to work together to succeed in life, and it was possible. Look at our lives today. People should learn to live together, so we could all succeed. And I think that’s the message my dad wanted to share.”\n\nWells died in 2020 at age 82, and Schwartz recalled his work with Wells outside of GILLIGAN’S ISLAND.\n\n“We did lots of things together,” Schwartz said. “We did some plays together, and we talked quite a bit. She was a really dear person who embraced her character Mary Ann. She loved what Mary Ann represented and the influence it had on people. She loved how she made people feel years later. And she certainly continued to get fan mail. She adored her fans.”\n\n“I remember we were doing an event somewhere and people couldn’t stop coming up just to say hi to her,” Schwartz continued. “As I stood next to her, I realized what her life must have been like. I remember one guy approached her and said, ‘If I had to pick between Ginger and Mary Ann, it would be you.’ She would always respond with a smile and say how nice that was. And then the next guy would come over and say the same thing. She probably spent her whole life with people coming up to her saying how much they adored her. And she was extremely gracious with every single person.”\n\nA heart of thanksgiving marked Wells’ life, which she vocalized shortly before her death in 2020.\n\n“At a time when it feels like everything is bad news, the good still outweighs the bad,” Wells told Fox News. “So even in tough times, we can and should be grateful for everything around us. I wake up, and I am grateful to have another day. I am grateful to feel a seasonal cool morning through my patio door. I am grateful for those who take the time to say ‘hi’ if to simply show that you matter.”\n\nRead More: GILLIGAN’S ISLAND 82-Year-Old Dawn Wells Shares Her 2020 Gratitudes"
