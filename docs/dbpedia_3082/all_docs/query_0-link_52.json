        "text": "Dawn Wells, the former beauty pageant winner who played Mary Ann Summers on the iconic CBS sitcom Gilligan’s Island, died Wednesday morning. She was 82.\n\nShe died in Los Angeles of causes related to COVID-19, her publicist told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWells, who was Miss Nevada in the 1959 Miss America pageant, also appeared in more 150 television series including Bonanza, Maverick, 77 Sunset Strip and Wagon Train.\n\nThe series about castaways stuck on a desert island ran for 98 episodes between 1964 and 1967 and attracted new fans through decades of syndication. Wells appeared in a handful of sequel movies.\n\n“The series was very good for me, for all of us who were there, because we’re known worldwide,” Wells told Forbes magazine in 2016. “And Mary Ann is loved all over the world. It’s amazing.”\n\nShe noted she earned $750 a week for her work and there were no residuals.\n\nHer death leaves Tina Louise, who played movie starlet Ginger Grant, as the sole surviving cast member.\n\nThe other castaways of the shipwrecked SS Minnow were Gilligan (Bob Denver); the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.); the Professor (Russell Johnson); and millionaire Thurston Howell III (Jim Backus) and his wife, Lovey (Natalie Schafer).\n\nWells suffered a financial setback in 2018 and fans raised more than $205,000 to assist her.\n\nShe was married to talent agent Larry Rosen for five years in the 1960s. She had no children."
