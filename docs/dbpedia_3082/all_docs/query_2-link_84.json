        "text": "Dawn Wells, who played the wholesome Mary Ann among a misfit band of shipwrecked castaways on the 1960s sitcom Gilligan’s Island, died Wednesday of causes related to COVID-19, her publicist said. She was 82.\n\nWells died peacefully at a living facility in Los Angeles, publicist Harlan Boll said.\n\n“There is so much more to Dawn Wells” than the Gilligan’s Island character that brought her fame, Boll said in a statement.\n\nBesides TV, film and stage acting credits, her other real-life roles included teacher and motivational speaker, Boll said.\n\nTina Louise, 86, who played Ginger the movie star, is the last surviving member of a cast that included Bob Denver as the title character; Alan Hale Jr. as the Skipper; Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer as wealthy passengers Thurston and Lovey Howell, and Russell Johnson, known as the Professor.\n\nBorn in Reno, Nevada, Wells represented her state in the 1959 Miss America pageant and quickly pivoted to an acting career. Her early TV roles came on shows including 77 Sunset Strip, Maverick and Bonanza.\n\nThen came Gilligan’s Island, a goofy, good-natured show that became an unlikely but indelible part of popular culture.\n\nWells’ comely but innocent Mary Ann complemented Louise’s worldly Ginger, and both became innocuous ’60s TV versions of sex symbols.\n\nTrending Now\n\nJordan Chiles stripped of bronze medal, USA Gymnastics files appeal\n\nAir safety expert on plane crash in Brazil: ‘I wouldn’t fly ’em’\n\nWells’ wardrobe included a gingham dress and shorts that modestly covered her belly button, with both costumes on display in Los Angeles at The Hollywood Museum.\n\nTV movies spinoffs from the series followed, including 1978’s Rescue from Gilligan’s Island, but Wells also moved on to other TV guest roles and films including the 2002 vacuum cleaner salesman comedy Super Sucker with Jeff Daniels. She starred on stage in dozens of plays, including Chapter Two and The Odd Couple.\n\nTwo years ago, a friend launched a GoFundMe drive to help cover medical and other costs for Wells, although she protested she didn’t need the assistance. She did end up acknowledging her need and accepted more than $180,000 in donations.\n\nDawn is survived by her stepsister, Weslee Wells.\n\n——"
