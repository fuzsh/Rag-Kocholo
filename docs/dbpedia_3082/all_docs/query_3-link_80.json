        "text": "Actinic Keratosis, also known as solar keratosis, is a scaly or crusty lesion on the skin that develops slowly and indicates the presence of sun damage. It is most commonly found on parts of the body frequently exposed to the sun including the bald scalp, face, ears, lips, backs of the hands or forearms, neck, and shoulders.\n\nActinic keratoses are considered precancerous and can develop into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. In fact, some 40 to 60 percent of squamous cell skin cancers begin as untreated actinic keratoses.\n\nBecause of this, your doctor should be diligent in diagnosing, treating and monitoring actinic keratosis.\n\nAnnual Skin Examinations are yearly scheduled skin exams with a dermatologist. Did you know that skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the U.S.? In fact, it is estimated that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Sun damage to the skin is cumulative over a person’s lifetime, so the average risk of skin cancer also increases as our life expectancy gets longer.\n\nJust as you schedule your annual physical or trip to the dentist, it is important to conduct a self-examination of your skin each month and schedule a professional annual skin examination once a year. Skin cancer is a treatable condition, but early detection is key.\n\nBasal Cell Carcinoma, also known as basalioma or basal cell cancer, is the most common type of skin cancer and carries the least amount of risk, though it still requires attention. If caught and treated early, basal cell carcinomas are not likely to be life-threatening, but they do have the potential to cause disfigurement of the skin tissue.\n\nAlmost one million new cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and up to 30% of Caucasians may develop basal cell carcinomas in their lifetime.\n\nSkin cancer is considered low risk when the affected cells remain clustered in a single group. Both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are rarely life-threatening. Though it is unlikely to spread to other parts of your body, if left untreated, basal cell carcinoma can move into nearby bone or other tissue.\n\nBasal cell carcinoma typically begins as a small, shiny bump on the face, although it can occur on any part of the body.\n\nCryotherapy, or “cryosurgery,” is a simple, non-invasive procedure in which liquid nitrogen is used to freeze and destroy growths on the surface of the skin. This is an effective treatment for precancerous skin lesions (actinic keratoses), as well as other skin conditions such as warts, skin tags and moles.\n\nApplying liquid nitrogen to skin lesions allows dermatologists to target the damaged skin cells and destroy them at the cellular level. After freezing, the affected area may blister and scab over, and should heal within three to six weeks.\n\nOur dermatology team uses cryosurgery to treat a wide range of conditions. It offers a number of advantages: Cryotherapy is a simple, affordable outpatient procedure, the discomfort level is minimal, and there is a low risk of infection.\n\nAcne is a dermatological condition caused by inflammation and mild infection in clogged pores. If not properly treated, acne can cause emotional distress, low self-esteem, and depression. In severe cases, it can even lead to permanent scarring.\n\nWhile not a serious physical health threat, acne is an embarrassing skin problem that can be life-altering for many patients. Though it is most common among teenagers, acne can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender, and can be mild, moderate or severe.\n\nEczema, also sometimes referred to as dermatitis, is a common condition characterized by a certain type of inflammation in the skin. There are many different types of eczema and symptoms can range from mild itching and redness to severe blistering and cracked skin. Whether you’re newly diagnosed with eczema or you’ve struggled with this chronic skin condition for years, you know that finding a treatment that works for you isn’t just important – it’s essential. Without proper and effective interventions, people with eczema can experience significant discomfort, itching, and inflammation.\n\nAt U.S. Dermatology Partners, our knowledgeable dermatologists partner with their patients to develop and maintain an effective eczema maintenance plan and provide advanced treatments for serious flareups. Learn more on this page or contact U.S. Dermatology Partners to get started working with us today.\n\nHead lice is a common condition, especially among children. While it may sound creepy or embarrassing to have small mites (or nits) in your hair, it’s actually a very manageable condition that is typically easy to treat right at home. On this page, you can learn more about how to get rid of lice from your head and your home.\n\nHerpes simplex virus, often referred to simply as HSV, is an extremely common viral infection impacting millions of people in the U.S. alone. While there’s no known cure for HSV, some treatments have proven effective in minimizing the number and severity of flare-ups. You can learn more about HSV, its symptoms, and treatment options on this page. You can also work with one of the knowledgeable professionals at U.S. Dermatology Partners to create a treatment plan. To get started, simply complete our online scheduling request form. One of our team members will be in touch soon to finalize the details of your treatment plan.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa is rare skin condition in which small, painful lumps develop under the skin, usually in areas where the skin rubs together (armpits, groin, between the buttocks, under the breasts, etc.) or in areas near hair follicles where many oil and sweat glands are present. Sometimes, the lumps may break open and smell, or they may create tunnels under the skin.\n\nIt can continue for many years, may worsen over time and can have serious effects on your daily life and emotional well-being, particularly during outbreaks.\n\nIf you’re dealing with the itchy, inflamed, painful skin condition called hives, it may be time to call U.S. Dermatology Partners for help. Hives can be very uncomfortable, but recognizing the warning signs and taking appropriate actions to care for your skin can be important to quickly relieve these symptoms and get back to feeling your best. Keep reading to learn more about what causes hives and how your dermatologist can treat this condition.\n\nHyperhidrosis, often referred to as excessive sweating, occurs when people experience disproportionate and/or unnecessary sweat production. While sweating is a natural function of the body’s systems to keep itself cool and maintain the best temperature, sweating too much or sweating that is not necessary to cool the body can create many difficulties that impact your overall health and wellbeing. Generalized hyperhidrosis may affect the whole body. Others have localized cases of excessive sweating that impact only certain areas. Specifically, there are three main types of localized hyperhidrosis: axillary (impacting the underarms), palmar (impacting the palms), and plantar (impacting the feet). If you experience general or localized excessive sweating at least once per week, you should talk to a dermatologist about a treatment plan.\n\nMelasma is a fairly common skin condition that creates the appearance of brown to gray-brown patches of skin, usually on the face. It can also occur on the neck and forearms and is the result of the body producing too much melanin, that natural substance that colors our hair, skin, and eyes.\n\nIf you’re dealing with dark spots or patches on your skin from the chronic condition melasma, the U.S. Dermatology Partners team can help you to improve the appearance of these spots and minimize the risk for future flare-ups of the condition. Read the page below to learn more or reach out to the U.S. Dermatology Partners location nearest you for more information.\n\nMilia is a commonly occurring skin condition that causes small bumps on the skin, and while these bumps may be irritating, the skin condition is harmless. You can learn more about milia, how it’s treated, and when to visit your dermatologist for help managing this skin condition on this page. If you have questions or want to schedule an appointment at U.S. Dermatology Partners, we invite you to take a few moments to complete our simple online request form.\n\nAtypical moles, also known as dysplastic nevi, are unusual-looking benign (noncancerous) moles.\n\nA dysplastic mole is one that, when viewed on a cellular level, has features unlike those of a healthy, benign mole. A benign mole will have a regular pattern of coloration and pigment, even borders, symmetry, and a tan or pink color. Dysplastic moles can be asymmetric, have indistinct borders, or contain multiple colors or very dark pigment.\n\nDysplastic moles are often spotted as the “ugly duckling” on a patient’s skin. Any departure from the typical mole a person’s skin makes may be dysplastic. They can appear anywhere on the body, but in most cases are found on the back, chest, buttocks, breasts, or scalp.\n\nMolluscum contagiosum is a contagious skin disease that appears as pink or flesh-colored bumps on the skin. It is caused by skin-to-skin contact as well as from sharing towels, clothing or touching infected surfaces. It can also be acquired through sexual contact.\n\nFor adults, bumps are most often found on the face, neck, armpits, arms and hands. They may also appear on the genitals, abdomen and inner thighs.\n\nOnce you are infected with the virus, it can spread to other parts the body, especially if you pick or scratch at the bumps or touch other parts of your skin after touching the bumps. (This is called self-re-infection.)\n\nTelemedicine, also known as online dermatology, telehealth, or teledermatology, is the use of telecommunications technology to provide care across a distance. This includes using the Internet, cell phones, SMS messaging and even satellites to allow physicians and patients to communicate medical information. This technology has been available for over a decade now, but as it has gotten better and better, telemedicine has now become much more available, easy to use, and secure. If used in the right way, it is one of the best ways that we can improve access to care.\n\nBecause dermatology is a very visual field and a specialty in high demand, patient access is often challenged by long wait times. Meeting a dermatologist online can be a great way to provide patients with increased access to skin care. Teledermatology involves the use of real-time video streaming, or more commonly the transmission of still images, pictures, and video in combination with a patient’s medical information collected via questionnaire. Teledermatology can be utilized in many ways including physician-to-physician consultations, triage, follow-up care, and patient education.\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory condition that causes patches of skin to become red, inflamed, and bumpy. This disease affects more than 8 million people in the U.S.\n\nPsoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakes skin cells for a virus or other infection and responds by producing more skin cell growth. This can be triggered by stress, anxiety, injuries to the skin, infections and hormonal changes.\n\nDespite the name, ringworm is not caused by worms; it is a skin infection caused by a fungus. It can be caused by touching another person who has the infection, or by sharing items that the person has been in contact — such as towels, bedding, chairs and clothes. It can also be caught from animals with fungal infections and, rarely, from contact with fungi in the soil.\n\nRosacea is a fairly common skin condition that causes redness in your face. In some cases, it may also produce small, red, pus-filled bumps. Typically these signs and symptoms may flare up for a period of weeks to months and then diminish for a while.\n\nRosacea may sometimes be mistaken for acne, an allergic reaction or other skin problems. It is believed to be caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors.\n\nLearn more: 4 Types of Rosacea\n\nShingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash that occurs when the virus that causes chickenpox reactivates.\n\nTypically, shingles appears on a small area on one side of the face or body. The rash is often painful because it travels up nerve roots (which supply sensation to your skin) to the area of skin supplied by those specific nerve roots.\n\nSkin tags are small, soft skin growths that can occur anywhere on the body but are most common on the eyelids, neck, armpits, groin folds and under the breasts. They are harmless but they can be annoying, particularly if they are in an area where they are rubbed on by clothing. They may be flesh-colored, pink or may darken.\n\nIndividuals who are prone to sunburn are thought to be genetically predisposed to skin cancer. Risk is also increased when exposure to UV rays is excessive. Sunscreen helps prevent the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation, including skin aging and skin cancer like melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nSunscreens are rated and labeled with a sun protection factor (SPF) that measures the fraction of sunburn-producing UV rays that reach the skin. The higher the SPF, the greater the protection.\n\nVitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which white patches of skin appear on different areas of the body. This happens when melanocytes, the cells that make pigment in the skin, are destroyed. In addition to the skin, it can affect the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose as well as the eyes. Its cause is not known.\n\nBotox, the commercial brand name for botulinum toxin (BTX), is an injectable cosmetic dermatology treatment that reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the face.\n\nUnlike injectable wrinkle fillers, which work by filling a crease in your skin with another substance, Botox actually relaxes targeted muscles to reduce the look of lines in the face. This results in smoother skin with a more youthful appearance.\n\nEach Botox injection relaxes key facial areas by temporarily paralyzing specific muscles. This temporarily removes wrinkles and improves the look of laugh and frown lines, skin bands on the neck, crow’s feet, forehead creases and more.\n\nAlthough it was originally developed to treat eye muscle disorders, Botox has become popular cosmetically and this is now its primary use. In fact, Botox injections are now the most common cosmetic treatment in the U.S., with 6.3 million procedures done in 2013. Because Botox inhibits the release of certain neurotransmitters, it is also sometimes used to treat chronic migraines.\n\nLoss of facial fullness and volume is one of the many age-related changes that people want to address with their dermatologist. From store-bought topical treatments to advanced dermatologic and surgical procedures, there are numerous cosmetic dermatology treatments available to help restore youthful volume. However, dermal and soft tissue fillers are often the most conservative and impactful solutions to restore volume without undergoing more invasive treatments. There are many different types of dermal and soft tissue fillers, and each one is formulated to address a specific area or issue related to volume loss. You can learn more on this page.\n\nAt U.S. Dermatology Partners we offer premier dermatology services for patients of all ages. Book your appointment today to find the best facial filler treatment for you and your skin, using our simple, online scheduling request form.\n\nDysport is a prescription injection used for the temporary improvement in severe frown lines between the eyebrows. As the muscles relax and prevent contractions, wrinkles in and around the brow and frown area will disappear.\n\nDysport, also known as Reloxin, is made from a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum; it is the same neurotoxin used in BOTOX Cosmetic.\n\nKeloids are raised, red scars created by excessive healing of skin wounds, such as burns, cuts and acne. They are the result of an overproduction of collagen as the skin tries to repair itself. Keloids also can occur after piercings, tattoos or surgery and often times are itchy and painful. They can grow for years and sometimes show up three months or longer after the injury occurred.\n\nKeratosis pilaris is a common skin condition characterized by small, hard bumps that may make your skin feel like sandpaper. Most often they appear on your upper arms, thighs and buttocks, and sometimes are accompanied by redness or swelling. In some cases they may appear on your face.\n\nIt is caused by a buildup of keratin, a protein that protects skin from infections. When a buildup forms, it blocks the opening of a hair follicle and creates the bumps, but doctors don’t know what triggers the buildup."
