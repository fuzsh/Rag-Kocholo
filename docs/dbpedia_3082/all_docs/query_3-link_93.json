        "text": "Embed from Getty Images\n\nLOS ANGELES — Dawn Wells, who played the wholesome Mary Ann among a misfit band of shipwrecked castaways on the 1960s sitcom “Gilligan’s Island,” died Wednesday of causes related to COVID-19, her publicist said. She was 82.\n\nWells died peacefully at a living facility in Los Angeles, publicist Harlan Boll said.\n\n“There is so much more to Dawn Wells” than the “Gilligan’s Island” character that brought her fame, Boll said in a statement.\n\n“With over 540,000 fans on her Facebook page and fan clubs across the U.S., her following has remained faithful,” Boll wrote in a social media post announcing her death.\n\n“Dawn would say that Mary Ann fits today just as she fit three generations ago, because she is timeless. In a world where the industry and society has been celebrating their ‘bad girls,’ Mary Ann continues to be, for man, the breath of fresh air as the ‘good girl.”‘\n\nBesides TV, film and stage acting credits, her other real-life roles included teacher and motivational speaker, Boll said.\n\nBorn in Reno, Nevada, Wells represented her state in the 1959 Miss America pageant and quickly pivoted to an acting career. Her early TV roles came on shows including “77 Sunset Strip,” “Maverick” and “Bonanza.”\n\nWell struck gold when she was cast as Kansas farm girl Mary Ann Summers on “Gilligan’s Island,” the tale of seven castaways on an uncharted island. The goofy, good-natured show became an unlikely but indelible part of popular culture. The show ran from 1964-67, but lived on for generations through syndication. The show was also parlayed into a series of made-for-TV movies.\n\nWith Wells’ death, Tina Louise — who portrayed starlet Ginger — is the only surviving original cast member from the show, which also featured Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer and Russell Johnson.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made in name to The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee, the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum or The Shambala Preserve, Boll said.\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report."
