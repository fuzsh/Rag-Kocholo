Her death leaves co-star Tina Louise, who played Ginger, as the sole surviving cast member of the beloved show.\n\nFollowing the news of Wells' death, famous friends and fans took to social media to pay tribute to the actress whom many grew up watching and loving.\n\n\"It was such a thrill for me to meet Dawn Wells when she came to see Two and a Half Men,\" Jon Cryer shared. \"She could not have been more lovely and gracious. Iâ€™m so grateful that I got to enjoy the work she loved doing.\"\n\n\"Condolences to the family of Dawn Wells. Very sad,\" William Shatner wrote.\n\nSee more tributes below.
