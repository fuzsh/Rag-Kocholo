        "text": "Gilligan’s Island star and Reno native Dawn Wells died Wednesday, Dec. 30 in Los Angeles due to complications from COVID-19. She was 82.\n\nWells died at 7:30 a.m., representative Harlan Boll reported. He told USA Today in an email that she “passed peacefully &mldr; in no pain.”\n\nWells is best known for her role as Mary Ann in the sitcom \"Gilligan’s Island.\" The show aired from 1964 to 1967.\n\nWells was a fourth-generation Nevadan born in Reno on Oct. 18, 1938. She graduated with honors from Reno High School.\n\nShe attended the all-women’s Stephens College in Missouri, where she originally planned to become a pediatric surgeon. But, “I took a theater course and my professor said I was so good that I should major in it,” she said in a 2014 interview in the RGJ.\n\nShe transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle to major in theater, and in 1959, she ran for Miss Nevada and won.\n\n\"I thought it would be fun to get up in front of an audience and do a dramatic scene for the contest but never thought I would win because I was so tiny and short,\" she said. \"But I won! After graduating, I told myself I would give acting a chance for one year and if it was not successful, would go back to medicine.\"\n\nShe later competed in the Miss America contest, but she never did return to med school.\n\nShe beat out 350 other actresses to earn the role of Mary Ann, her most well-known role. \"Gilligan’s Island\" focused on a shipwrecked crew of passengers that included a the ship's captain and his bumbling first mate, Gilligan, a movie star, a millionaire couple, a professor and the girl next door, played by Wells.\n\nWells said she had performed in more than 60 theatrical productions and more than 150 film and television roles.\n\nGoFundMe: Dawn Wells, of 'Gilligan's Island,' is 'amazed' at support from GoFundMe topping $50K\n\nShe also wrote the books, \"A Guide to Life: What Would Mary Ann Do?\" and \"Mary Anne's Gilligan's Island Cookbook.\"\n\nHer cousin, Terry Lee Wells, donated around $5 million to The Discovery Museum, a hands-on museum in downtown Reno.\n\n“We are saddened by the loss of Dawn Wells. Dawn was a huge supporter of the museum and instrumental in the founding of the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum in her role as a trustee of the Terry Lee Wells Foundation,\" said Patrick Turner, the museum’s vice president of marketing and communications. \"Dawn’s passion for the museum and the community it serves will be missed tremendously.”\n\nWells made several return visits to events in Northern Nevada, including to serve as grand marshal of the Sparks Hometowne Christmas Parade in 2005.\n\nCommenting on her death, actor Jon Cryer tweeted that after he met Wells while filming “Two and a Half Men,” “She could not have been more lovely and gracious. I am so grateful that I got to enjoy the work she loved doing.”\n\nWells is survived by her stepsister, Weslee Wells. No services are scheduled at this time, according to Boll."
