        "text": "Much energy was expended among \"Gilligan Island\" watchers over who was hotter: cheerful Mary Ann or slinky seductive Ginger (Tina Louise). I definitely fell in the Mary Ann camp due to her kind nature, winsome smile and great legs. Always envied Gilligan's and the Professor's proximity to Mary Ann.\n\nWhile old enough to appreciate Dawn, I was too young to understand the implied \"Skipper / 'Little Buddy'\" potential relationship.\n\nNoooooh. It's sad when a loved one dies, and 82 may be considered to be a ripe old age ##-## maybe all that was left ahead for her was not much to which to look foward, but oh heck we will remember her from the '60's, and what a beautiful nice sweetheart gal she was.\n\nGilligan's Island had all the jokes that were missed as a kid but are funny as an adult. I also never thought it was odd that Gilligan had no interest in getting busy with either Mary Ann or Ginger. But today all I can think of is: JUST HOW SLOW ARE YOU GILLIGAN? MAKE A MOVE ON ONE OF THE GIRLS!\n\nAveragesupernova said:\n\nGilligan's Island had all the jokes that were missed as a kid but are funny as an adult.

He was still afraid of girls I guess. Just like most young grade school boys who watched it.\n\nAveragesupernova said:\n\nI do. He was still afraid of girls I guess. Just like most young grade school boys who watched it.\n\nWe had our choice to admire besides Marie Ann.\n\nBarbara Feldon( Get Smart-Agent 99 ), Susan Dey(Partridge Family-Laurie), Barbara Eden(I Dream of Jennie-Jennie), and Batman. Batman was the only one with lunchboxes.\n\nAveragesupernova said:\n\nJUST HOW SLOW ARE YOU GILLIGAN? MAKE A MOVE ON ONE OF THE GIRLS!\n\nHe couldn't. The alpha males were in the same paddock as the females, and made direct eye contact with Gilligan to assert dominance.\n\nSkipper claimed Ginger, The Professor claimed Mary Ann and Mister Howell: Lovey. (remember the beauty contest?)"
