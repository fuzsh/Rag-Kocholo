        "text": "Actress and TV movie producer Dawn Wells, who became internationally famous as the stranded girl-next-door on the mid-1960s TV sitcom \"Gilligan's Island,\" died Wednesday of complications related to the coronavirus. She was 82 years old. Wells' publicist, B. Harlan Boll, announced her death on social media.\n\nWells was a native of Reno, Nev. and started out as a beauty queen. In 1959, as Miss Nevada, she competed in the Miss America pageant. It was her ticket into show business; soon after, she had minor roles in such shows as \"77 Sunset Strip,\" \"Maverick,\" \"Bonanza,\" and \"The Joey Bishop Show.\" In 1964, Wells became the wide-eyed, pig-tailed Mary Ann — a sharp contrast to another female castaway, the sexpot movie actress Ginger (played by Tina Louise). The Ginger-vs.-Mary Ann rivalry was a very mid-1960s, straight male fantasy of feminine ideals.\n\nAfter Well's signature success in \"Gilligan's Island\" — which ran on primetime for only three years on CBS, but endlessly for decades in syndication — she later appeared on such shows as \"Vega$,\" \"Growing Pains,\" \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" and \"Baywatch\" — on which her character was once again named Mary Ann. She also voiced Gumbalina Toothington on the children's show \"The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,\" and as a producer, brought movies to CVS, Showtime and Amazon.\n\nBut after \"Gilligan's Island,\" Wells was always the wholesome Mary Ann. Wells titled her 2014 self-help book (written with Steve Stinson) What Would Mary Ann Do? A Guide to Life.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Wells posted a holiday message and short video to her Facebook page. She wrote, \"Keep you heart light and share a few laughs and conversation with someone near and far... Please find joy amidst the pandemic and be cognizant of our overwhelmed first responders. Let's not let our actions make a bigger burden for them. I am thankful and in awe of the dedication of our health care professionals.\" She did not make reference to her own health.\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org."
