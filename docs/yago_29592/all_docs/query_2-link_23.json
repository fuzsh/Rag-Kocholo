        "text": "Michael Nader, the soap opera star best known for playing Dex Dexter on ”Dynasty” and Dimitri Marick on ”All My Children,” died Monday following a battle with cancer.\n\nHe was 76.\n\nNader died in his Northern California home with his wife Jodi Lister and their rescue dog Storm by his side, his manager Richard Schwartz confirmed.\n\n“With heavy heart, I’m sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael,” Lister said via a statement. “He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nLister and Nader were married for nearly two decades: “We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted.”\n\nNader played Dex Dexter, the third husband of Joan Collins’ character Alexis Colby, on the primetime ABC soap opera “Dynasty” from 1983 to 1989. The cast reunited in March for a virtual fundraiser for research into COVID-19 survivors experiencing long-haul symptoms, like “Dynasty” star Emma Samms.\n\n“Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of ‘Dynasty,’” Lister said in her statement.\n\nNader is also known for playing Dimitri Marick, the husband of Susan Lucci’s character Erica Kane, on the ABC soap opera “All My Children” from 1991 to 2001. He reprised his role in 2013. His other TV acting credits include “Gidget,” ”As the World Turns” and “Lucky Chances.”\n\nHe is survived by Lister, his daughter Lindsay with ex-wife Robin Weiss, son-in-law Trevor and granddaughter Juniper."
