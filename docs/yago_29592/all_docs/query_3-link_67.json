        "text": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers tease that viewers are in for a big week on the ABC soap. The new GH preview for the week of February 8 is out, and it promises some major action on several storyline fronts.\n\nFirst off, the preview shows Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson) opening up the door of the Quartermaine mansion and exclaiming, “Oh, my God.” Clearly, something or someone has caught Monica off-guard, but what or whom could it be?\n\nWell, one possibility is that it could be Brook Lynn Quartermaine (Amanda Setton), who is set to make a comeback to Port Charles at some point. Might we see Brook Lynn back on the Port Charles scene…and possibly pregnant?\n\nIt’s an exciting possibility, and it would be sure to shake things up during February sweeps!\n\nNext, the new GH preview shows Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) quizzing Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud) about Liesl Obrecht’s (Kathleen Gati) current location.\n\nAnna thinks that Obrecht is her biggest threat right now, but little does she know that Peter August (Wes Ramsey) is the bigger threat to her and the people she loves.\n\nSpeaking of Peter, Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) will find out the whole truth about what Peter did – namely, that he arranged for Drew Cain’s (Billy Miller) private plane to go down, and that he was heavily involved in Drew’s abduction from Afghanistan back in the day.\n\nValentin is shown in the GH preview warning Peter that Anna and Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) will eventually learn the truth.\n\nNext, the preview shows an intriguing scene in which an unidentified man prepares a special delivery for Peter…from Hungary. The man peruses the last will and testament of Alex Devane Marick (Finola Hughes), then puts together an envelope for Peter containing a flash drive.\n\nInterestingly, the return address on the label is from a “D. Marick,” suggesting that Dimitri Marick (Michael Nader), Alex’s former husband, could be the man assembling the envelope.\n\nNext, the GH preview turns to Sonny Corinthos’ (Maurice Benard) funeral, and both Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) are shown reacting to something unsettling during the event.\n\nThen Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) is shown confronting Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) and Jasper “Jax” Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) at the funeral.\n\n“I know what you both did to my daughter!” Nina fumes at Jax and Carly. It looks like Sonny’s funeral is going to be full of fireworks.\n\nWe should point out that Nina will make this big revelation at the funeral after talking with Phyllis Caulfield (Joyce Guy), whom she’ll bring to Port Charles, so it’s looking like Nina won’t have realized that Sonny is alive and well."
