        "text": "Dynasty star Michael Nader has died at the age of 76.\n\nThe actor was best known for playing Dex Dexter, the boyfriend and eventual husband of Joan Collins' character, Alexis Carrington, on the much-loved 80s TV show.\n\nHe also played Susan Lucci's husband Dimitri Marick on soap opera All My Children.\n\nThe sad news of Michael's passing was shared by his wife, who revealed he had suffered a long battle with cancer.\n\n\"With heavy heart, I'm sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael,\" Nader's wife said in a statement shared to MichaelFairmanTV.com.\n\n\"We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted.\"\n\nShe described Michael as a 'beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills.'\n\n\"I will miss him forever,\" she added.\n\nThe statement also revealed how Michael had been thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the Dynasty cast of Dynasty during Emma Samms' virtual event to help raise funds for long-COVID research.\n\nSamms was the second actress to play Fallon Carrington Colby on the soap.\n\nMichael joined the cast of Dynasty in 1983 where he played the tall, dark handsome hunk who caught the attention of scheming Alexis, played by Collins.\n\nHis character Dex refused to be another boytoy to the man-eater and succeeded in convinced Alexis to marry him.\n\nMichael stayed with the show until it ended in 1989.\n\nHe went on to join All My Children, where he played Dimitri Marick from 1991 to 2001 and again in 2013.\n\nMichael later popped up in shows including Law & Order and Magum, PI.\n\nDynasty was conceived by ABC to compete with rival CBS' prime time hit Dallas.\n\nRatings for the debut season had been unremarkable but within four years the drama had become the Number One show in the States, in part due to the arrival of Collins' character Alexis.\n\nIt was cancelled in 1989 after nine seasons and 220 episodes."
