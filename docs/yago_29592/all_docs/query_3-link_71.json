        "text": "Michael Nader, the actor known for his performances as Dex in the original Dynasty series and Dimitri Marick in All My Children, died earlier this week of cancer, his rep confirmed. He was 76.\n\nFairman's wife Jodi Lister gave a statement to news site Michael Fairman TV, saying, \"With heavy heart, I'm sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael. We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted. Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of Dynasty during Emma Samms' virtual event to help raise funds for long COVID research. Michael was working on a book about his life and addiction at the time of his death. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.\"\n\nNader was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1945. He got his start in television as Siddo in Gidget, the Sally Field ABC sitcom that ran from 1965 to 1966, before entering the world of both primetime and daytime soap operas, which became his career focus.\n\nHe played Kevin Thompson in CBS' As the World Turns from 1975 to 1978, then Alexi Theopolis in NBC's Bare Essence in 1983. Later that year, he gained more notoriety when he joined the cast of Dynasty. He played Farnsworth 'Dex' Dexter until the show was cancelled in 1989. In 1991, Nader joined All My Children as Dex, playing the role until 1999 and then again from 2000 to 2001, plus a revival season in 2013.\n\nAs Lister mentioned, Nader struggled with addiction throughout his life. In 1997, he was arrested for drunk driving with his then-13-year-old daughter in the car and in 2001, he was arrested for selling cocaine.\n\nNader was married three times, first to Robin Weiss, with who he had his daughter Lindsay, then to Beth Windsor. Nader and Lister were married for 18 years leading up to his death.\n\nNader is survived by Lister, daughter Lindsay and granddaughter Juniper.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox"
