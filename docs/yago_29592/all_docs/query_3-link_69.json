We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted.”\n\nShe continued, “Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of Dynasty during Emma Samms virtual event to help raise funds for Long-Covid research. Michael was working on a book about his life and addiction at the time of his death. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nNader was born in St. Louis in 1945 and raised in California. His screen career began in 1963 in William Asher’s comedy Beach Party, which promoted several more appearances in beach movies such as Bikini Beach and Pajama Party.\n\nHis first recurring role began in the series Gidget, which starred Sally Field and Don Porter.
