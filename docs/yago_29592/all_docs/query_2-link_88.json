        "text": "All My Children launched online in April after its 2011 cancellation without the legendary Erica Kane but Susan Lucci and her character may be returning to Pine Valley.\n\nLucci spoke to TV Guide about the possibility of returning to the soap opera. It began airing again through Hulu on April 29. Lucci had been with the former ABC daytime drama since its inception in 1970. The Emmy winner said she was open to coming back to the online version in an interview with TV Guide that was published May 9.\n\n\"I hope so. We're trying,\" Lucci said.\n\nAccording to spoilers on She Knows Soaps, the Kane matriarch will be needed by her daughter Bianca and granddaughter Miranda. Miranda could learn the truth about who her father really is in the upcoming weeks. The teen does not yet know she was a product of a brutal rape. Miranda will also get a surprise at her birthday party in June.\n\nOther scoops revolve around the kidnapping of Cassandra, Jesse and Angie's daughter. On June 3, Jesse, \"finds a message at the place where Cassandra is being held.\"\n\nDaytime Confidential also teased that by the week of June 10, Jesse would be forced to make a deal with the devil. The cop will do the bidding of the Russian mobsters who are holding Cassandra as a sex slave. In other developments, Michael Nader will be returning to the canvas as Dimitri Marick after more than a decade since his last appearance.\n\nNader opened up to Michael Fairman about what fans could expect on May 18. The actor, who played one of Erica's many husbands, did not want his character to be a bad guy in his latest incarnation but feared by the pariahs in town.\n\n\"I want Dimitri to be a caring man, but very, very tough when s**t comes his way. If \"Jr\", or David, or anybody gets in his way, they need to watch out,\" he said.\n\nNader is expected to begin airing in June."
