        "text": "Soap fans and performers alike were shocked by the sudden death of legendary actor Michael Nader, the handsome star who played ALL MY CHILDREN’s Dimitri Marick and DYNASTY heartthrob Dex Dexter. The 76-year-old actor passed away at home on Aug. 23.\n\nIn an emotional statement on Nader’s Facebook Fan Page, his wife, Jodi Lister, revealed that her husband had terminal cancer. “He was diagnosed with untreatable cancer on Friday the 13th and died 10 days later with me and his best fur friend, Storm, by his side,” she wrote. “His death and diagnosis was sudden and unexpected and I have never experienced such agony as watching my soulmate die before my eyes. He was loved by so many and treasured his fans and their letters and emails. He responded to them all. He was working on a book about his life and addiction before he passed. He had so many talents and skills and it’s hard to imagine living life without his beautiful and wonderful presence, joy, and laughter.”\n\nIn addition to playing the lover of iconic Joan Collins’ Alexis Carrington on the primetime soap DYNASTY, Nader also played the lover of an iconic daytime character on AMC: that of Susan Lucci’s Erica Kane. Nader made his soap debut back in 1975 as AS THE WORLD TURNS’ Kevin Thompson, a role he played for three years, and he also played Alexi Theopolis on NBC’s primetime soap BARE ESSENCE."
