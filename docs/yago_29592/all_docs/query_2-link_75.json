        "text": "Performer of the Week - Colby\n\nThis week was Colby's week to shine! She started out strong, standing up to big brother JR for his lack of family leadership. She told him off but good and personally I think he needed to hear it. Colby was kidnapped and held hostage by JR's maniacal girlfriend that he thought he could talk down from her mania. Colby called him out on his ego, his belief that he could get Annie under control, how the family business is going down the tubes under his leadership and the how the family is falling apart. She said it best when she said, \"You are in so far over your head, it's actually pathetic, because you think that you can be Dad, but you will never ever be Dad.\" Go Colby! It's about time someone put JR in his place.\n\nBut that was just the beginning for Colby this week. After receiving a call from Damon, Colby went to talk to her mother only to be discouraged from the possible reconciliation that Damon was proposing. Liza brought up her own volatile relationship with her mother, Marian, saying that there are some things that can never be forgiven. Confused, Colby wanted to know what her relationship with Marian had to do with what was going on with Colby and Damon. Liza backpedaled but Colby kept pushing and eventually Liza mentioned Tad and their past, confusing Colby even more.\n\nDetermined to find out what Liza was comparing her and Damon to, she went to seek out some answers and luckily she ran into loose lips Opal. With only a few pointed questions, Opal revealed to Colby that Marian had slept with Tad while Liza was dating him. Did history repeat itself? It couldn't be. Colby didn't want to believe it. But she had to know so she went to confront her mother.\n\nIt was the confrontation that many have been waiting for, myself included. How would Liza explain herself? She can't, there is no justification. There is no excuse good enough to explain how a mother slept with her daughters boyfriend. The performances of both Natalie Hall and Jamie Lunar were stellar. From Colby's disbelief that her own mother could hurt and betray her so completely and profoundly, to Liza's horror all over again at what she had done. I felt for Colby, who was so hurt she wants Liza out of her life, declaring, \"You're not my mom anymore.\" And then I even felt for Liza who, with nowhere to turn, turned to Tad for comfort and understanding. He tried to assure Liza that Colby would forgive her just as she had forgiven Marian, but Liza didn't think it would ever happen.\n\nColby's devastation is extensive. Will she ever be able to look at her mother as a mother again? Will Liza be able to make this up to her daughter? It will take a lot of work on Liza's part. With Natalie and Jamie portraying this duo, I can only imagine how great it will be to watch it unfold.\n\nCOMMENTARY: Let's Talk Couples\n\nNew ones, old ones, potential ones... let's dish! Up first, a new couple who can potentially end up my fave couple... Scott and Madison.\n\nThe closer they get, the more I love them. Having Daniel Cosgrove back as Scott has been a revelation! He's gone from fast forward material to the one I want to watch. I love this chemistry with, well, with everyone! But I am truly loving the Scott/Madison dynamic. But is it destined for failure? It was Greenlee who pushed Scott towards Madison to keep her and the baby she is carrying away from Ryan. Scott agreed to it and Greenlee helped him get out of prison. Ever since, Scott's been trying to be a more stand up guy. But what he really needs to do is come clean with Madison before it's too late. Hell it might already be too late. The two are falling for each other. But when Ryan and Madison find out all the deception going on behind their backs, might it just push Ryan and Madison back together?\n\nWhich brings us to Ryan and Greenlee.\n\nTo hear some fans talk, you'd think that everyone on planet earth hated these two as a couple. Well that is just not true. They aren't my favorite couple together, although I like them both apart. And I don't hate them as a couple, but I really did like Ryan with Madison and Greenlee with David before David went from just being devious to the devil incarnate. Greens though, she went into her latest marriage to Ryan carrying the huge secret that Madison is having his baby. Things are eventually going to blow up. And really, let's face it, it's pretty much a no brainer that they aren't even married. The Rev. Ricky has proven to be anything but what he says he is. So they won't even have to get divorced when Ryan finds out Greens knew about his latest progeny. And really, does Ryan need another kid? For that matter did Tad?\n\nAs of today, Tad is engaged to Cara to throw off INS. This opens up a whole interesting can of worms. Clearly they are going to end up getting married. How is Jake going to feel about that, Cara being his ex-wife and all? I'm reserving judgment for now on Cara and Tad as a couple because I'm just thrilled Tad has a storyline. And I kind of like Cara anyway. So we'll see how that one plays out.\n\nJake and Amanda are the quintessential couple. They've got it all and that, as you all know, is the kiss of death on soaps. So here comes the conflict! It was Amanda who called INS on Cara in the first place. She didn't know it could potentially put Cara in a lot of danger, she just wanted the saucy wench away from her man. This is going to blow up and it's not going to be good. Amanda needs to trust their love and her husband. Just because Cara is back doesn't mean a damn thing. Jake is true blue and she knows it.\n\nJR and Marissa are done. I can't see her ever taking him back again.... then again, he did way worse to Babe and she kept going back for more, so who knows! But I keep hearing little rumblings about a deep friendship that Marissa and Bianca are going to form. Bianca hired Marissa to handle her divorce from Reese, an unfortunate development IMO. So Tamara Braun didn't want to come back as Reese, why not recast? I really hate when TPTB undo things that broke ground on the show. So now not only the first legal abortion on television was undone, but now the first gay marriage on soaps is being dissolved. It's a shame. But that frees up Bianca and Marissa already is single... might there be something developing between these two? I'm hoping!\n\nAnd the rest we shall save for another time. Then again what is there left to say? Colby and Asher? Snore. Caleb/Erica/Jack? Meh. Put Caleb with Opal and leave Jack and Erica alone, they can self destruct all on their own, without outside help. As always, I adore Angie and Jesse. I am interested in seeing something develop between David and Liza. I might be down with Kendall and Griffin eventually. I'm liking how it's going slow and let's face it, he is not hard to look at! I'd definitely like to see Krystal get a story and some lovin! And JR? Dude needs to be single for a while. So who did I miss? Frankie and Randi? Really... did I actually miss them? Is there anything to say?"
