Best known for playing the dramatic role of Erica Kane on All My Children, Lucci is a soap icon — so much so, she’s been dubbed “Daytime’s Leading Lady” by TV Guide, with both The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times citing her as one of the highest-paid actresses on daytime television. Decade after decade, she’s won the hearts of viewers and fans with her stunning looks, affable charm, and energetic personality — and this remains true today.\n\nAlthough Lucci is known and loved by soap fans as the unforgettable Erica Kane, she’s appeared in quite a few television shows and films throughout the years, including a cameo in Young Doctors in Love and a special guest-star appearance in both The Love Boat and Hot in Cleveland, for which she appeared in six separate episodes."
