        "text": "I’ve been wanting to write something about ALL MY CHILDREN for quite awhile, but it’s been difficult for me to accept that it’s actually coming to an end. Today. ALL MY CHILDREN is ending today. What a sad sentence to write.\n\nCreated by soap legend Agnes Nixon, ALL MY CHILDREN debuted on ABC on January 5, 1970. Even if you’ve never seen an episode of the soap, you at least know its most famous resident, Erica Kane, portrayed by daytime queen Susan Lucci. As with all of her daytime dramas, Nixon sought to create a show grounded in humanity and social issues. ALL MY CHILDREN was the first show to discuss the Vietnam War in depth, and most famously, it was the first television series in daytime or primetime to feature a legal abortion. Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter were daytime’s first African American supercouple. Bianca Montgomery (Erica’s daughter) and Lena Kundera were the first characters to share a same-sex kiss in daytime. ALL MY CHILDREN has held a significant place in pop culture and television history for 41 years.\n\nI’ve been watching ALL MY CHILDREN for about 20 of those years. Maybe longer. People don’t believe me because I’m only 25, but what can I say? My mother stayed at home when I was young, and if I wanted to spend time with her between noon and 3 p.m. on weekdays, I had to watch soap operas. Therefore, I became addicted to ALL MY CHILDREN, ONE LIFE TO LIFE and GENERAL HOSPITAL at roughly the age of 3. I’ve fallen away from all three soaps at different points, and I would always eventually come back. But a few years ago, I stopped coming back to ALL MY CHILDREN except to watch a few episodes here and there when an old character returned.\n\nI can tell you the exact storyline that made me turn away, and I know its the same storyline that turned others away as well. Remember that historic abortion I just mentioned? In 1973, Erica Kane was married to Dr. Jeff Martin when she became unexpectedly pregnant. Erica didn’t want her modeling career to end, so she had an abortion without telling Jeff. Nothing ever stays secret for long on a soap opera, and eventually everyone found out about the abortion once Erica developed an infection from the procedure. The storyline immediately took on historical significance and was cited and lauded for decades.\n\nAll that was destroyed in 2005 with Erica’s “unabortion.” That’s right. We found out that Dr. Greg Madden, the doctor who was supposed to perform Erica’s abortion, was so obsessed with Ms. Kane that he removed the embryo from Erica’s uterus and implanted it into his wife’s. Fast forward to 2005, and meet Josh, the son that Erica thought she had aborted in 1973. But the revisions didn’t stop there. Suddenly, Erica was saying that the reason she had the abortion was because she was scared and confused. The real reason she had her abortion (to protect her modeling career) was swept under the rug, forever changing the character of Erica Kane. And that’s when ALL MY CHILDREN lost me. Sure, I tuned in during Dixie’s numerous returns and when Jesse and Angie reunited after everyone believed Jesse had been dead for 20 years. But I never stuck around for long. Even a hardcore soap fan like myself has a breaking point. By the way, the show ended up killing off Josh in 2009. How pointless.\n\nI don’t want to focus too much on the negative today because I truly do love ALL MY CHILDREN. There are so many characters that I have loved and followed for 20 years, and it’s hard to believe we won’t be seeing their stories anymore. Soap operas are not written to end, so it’s been strange watching storylines wrap up and (gasp!) people actually getting happy endings. Yes, Prospect Park has plans to move ALL MY CHILDREN online, but I can’t imagine that the Pine Valley that we see a few months from now will be the same Pine Valley we see today. Vets like Susan Lucci (Erica Kane) and Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) won’t be moving online. Other actors like Jacob Young (JR Chandler) and Debbie Morgan (Angie Hubbard) are moving on to other soaps. I can only assume that Prospect Park’s ALL MY CHILDREN will be filled with recasts and young actors who won’t need to be paid as much. I hope I’m wrong. Despite my bleak predictions, I applaud Prospect Park for recognizing the entertainment value of soap operas and for doing something to save soaps from being lost forever.\n\nSo as ALL MY CHILDREN closes out its 41-year run on ABC, I’m reflecting on some of my favorite moments and storylines from the two decades I have been a fan of this soap opera. In no particular order:\n\n– Susan Lucci finally won the Daytime Emmy in 1999 after 19 nominations. I totally cried. And I just cried again watching this video. It really is delightful. Even Oprah is thrilled!\n\n– Erica Kane finally married Jackson Montgomery in 2005. Even though she’s had seven other husbands, he’s the man she was always meant to be with.\n\n– Haley and Mateo fell in love on screen as their portrayers, Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, fell in love off screen. I was 9 or 10 and was obsessed by the fact that they were together in real life.\n\n– Erica’s daughter Bianca developed anorexia in 1997. I was 11 years old, and I now realize what an important storyline that was for me to see at that age.\n\n– Erica married Dimitri Marick twice in the 1990s. In between, she stabbed him with a letter opener because she was having hallucinations of her rape at age 14. Despite the stabbing and the affairs, I LOVED them.\n\n– Stuart Chandler’s wife Cindy died of AIDS, leaving him to care for her son, Scott. Apparently Cindy died in 1989, so either I have an amazing memory, or I saw clips of her death at a very young age. I swear I remember watching this happen.\n\n– Julia Santos’ face was scarred when a chandelier fell on her during a tornado. She ran away and fell in love with Noah Keefer. I was only 8 years old, but I remembering absolutely loving these two together.\n\n– GENERAL HOSPITAL’s Anna Devane was revealed to be alive on the wrong soap. I’ll always be resentful that Anna and Robin had their reunion in Pine Valley instead of Port Charles.\n\n– Simone Torres, one of my favorite characters who never got enough screen time, was murdered by the Satin Slayer in 2006. She had a fun relationship with Tad Martin that I always wished would have become something more.\n\n– Bad boy Ryan Lavery and Hungarian princess Gillian Andrassy fell in love, but then Gillian died tragically. Like “We’re about to leave for our honeymoon, but whoops, you got shot in the head first” tragically.\n\n– Bad boy Leo du Pres (Josh Duhamel!) and bad girl Greenlee Smythe fell in love, but then Leo died tragically. So much tragedy all the time on these soaps.\n\n– Tad fell off a bridge into a raging river and was presumed dead. I for real thought he was dead and was a very sad child.\n\nThose are some moments that stand out to me. And now I realize I’ve gone this entire post without expressing my undying love for Adam Chandler. That is tragic!\n\nI’d be interested to see what moments stand out to other fans. If you have ever been a fan of ALL MY CHILDREN at any point in your life, please share some memories in the comments. And I encourage you to not only watch today’s episode but also every episode from this week, which you can find here.\n\nI leave you all with the following poem written by Agnes Nixon for the All My Children photo album in the opening credits. And I would just like to say thank you to Agnes and to all the actors, writers and fans who have kept ALL MY CHILDREN alive for 41 years. And thank you to those who are trying to keep this great drama alive even longer. If soap operas have taught me anything, it’s that anyone can come back from the dead. ALL MY CHILDREN can do it, too.\n\nThe Great and the Least,\n\nThe Rich and the Poor,\n\nThe Weak and the Strong,\n\nIn Sickness and in Health,\n\nIn Joy and Sorry,\n\nIn Tragedy and Triumph,\n\nYou are ALL MY CHILDREN.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nWho cares about Sunday Night Football? The Emmys are here! (What’s that? Everyone cares about Sunday Night Football? Then this post is for TV nerds only.) I hope you have your watch parties planned because the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards air Sunday at 8ET/5PT. On FOX! Ugh, FOX. Remember this disaster? Hopefully no one tries to pull off that dumb circular stage again. The poor UGLY BETTY cast had to face everyone’s backs all night.\n\nRead on to see my predictions, and get your ballots out and start making your own! I didn’t include my guesses for the Miniseries or Movie categories, but I’m really crossing my fingers that Maggie “What is a weekend?” Smith wins for DOWNTON ABBEY.\n\nPlease make your own predictions in the comments. Let’s fight!\n\nOUTSTANDING DRAMA SERIES\n\nNominees: BOARDWALK EMPIRE, DEXTER, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, GAME OF THRONES, THE GOOD WIFE, MAD MEN\n\nWhat will win: MAD MEN. It’s hard enough for a show to win one Emmy in this category. It’s even harder for it to win four years in a row. MAD MEN would join THE WEST WING, HILL STREET BLUES, and L.A. LAW as the only series to win best drama four times. Even with the absence of BREAKING BAD, MAD MEN had an incredible amount of competition this year. But as long as the series keeps churning out episodes like “The Suitcase,” it’s going to stay on top.\n\nWhat I want to win: FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. It’s a miracle FNL was even nominated in this category, not because it doesn’t deserve the nomination but because it seemed doomed to join THE WIRE as a show that would never receive proper recognition from the voting academy. FNL should have been nominated far earlier than 2011, but I’ve been so abused by the Emmys that I’ll take what I can get. What if FNL did manage to pull off the upset on Sunday? Well then I’d be crying like the baby I turned into during the series finale.\n\nOUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES\n\nNominees: THE BIG BANG THEORY, GLEE, MODERN FAMILY, THE OFFICE, PARKS AND RECREATION, 30 ROCK\n\nWho will win: MODERN FAMILY. This was the best comedy on television last year, so it’s going to take the Academy a little while to catch up. The series had an uneven season, but even the worst episode of MODERN FAMILY is better than the best episode of GLEE. Seriously, what is that show even doing in the category this year? This isn’t the GOLDEN GLOBES. (Snap!)\n\nWho I want to win: PARKS AND RECREATION. My love for this show should be no secret by now. Simply put, it was the best comedy on TV in 2011.\n\nOUTSTANDING LEAD ACTOR IN A DRAMA\n\nNominees: Steve Buscemi (BOARDWALK EMPIRE), Michael C. Hall (DEXTER), Kyle Chandler (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS), Hugh Laurie (HOUSE), Timothy Olyphant (JUSTIFIED), Jon Hamm (MAD MEN)\n\nWho will win: Jon Hamm (MAD MEN). For as many awards as MAD MEN has received, Hamm has never actually taken home the Emmy himself. Blame that on Bryan Cranston and his performance as Walter White in BREAKING BAD. Cranston has won the category three years in a row, each time beating a nominated Hamm. But BREAKING BAD missed the Emmy window this year, so the race is Hamm’s to lose. Will victory be as sweet with Hamm’s biggest competitor on the bench this year? I have no doubt it will be. M-I-Z.\n\nWho I want to win: Kyle Chandler (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS). I love Jon Hamm. And I will be so happy for him if he wins on Sunday. But it breaks my heart that Chandler wasn’t nominated until his final two seasons on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. And it breaks my heart even more that he’ll never actually have an Emmy for his incredible work as Coach Taylor.\n\nOUTSTANDING LEAD ACTRESS IN A DRAMA\n\nNominees: Connie Britton (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS), Julianna Margulies (THE GOOD WIFE), Kathy Bates (HARRY’S LAW), Mireille Enos (THE KILLING), Mariska Hargitay (LAW & ORDER: SVU), Elisabeth Moss (MAD MEN)\n\nWho will win: Julianna Margulies (THE GOOD WIFE). It was supposed to happen last year. Margulies was a lock for this category. She had already won the Golden Globe, the SAG Award and the TCA Award. All that was left was the Emmy. But sometimes a lousy episode submission is all it takes to derail your Emmy dreams, and that’s how experts explained her loss last year. Even though her competition is stronger this year, Margulies should win the category on Sunday.\n\nWho I want to win: Elisabeth Moss (MAD MEN). The best part of “The Suitcase” (the episode Moss submitted) was when I found out Peggy Olson and I had the same birthday. May 25th! The rest of the episode was pretty great, too. Watch it, and you’ll see why this Emmy should go to Moss, who will always be Zoey Bartlet from THE WEST WING to me. And that girl from the migraine commercials.\n\nOUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTOR IN A DRAMA\n\nNominees: Peter Dinklage (GAME OF THRONES), Josh Charles (THE GOOD WIFE), Alan Cumming (THE GOOD WIFE), Walter Goggins (JUSTIFIED), John Slattery (MAD MEN), Andre Braugher (MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE)\n\nWho will win: Alan Cumming (THE GOOD WIFE). This race could really go to anyone except for Josh Charles. That’s no slam against his acting ability. He just doesn’t have much Emmy buzz surrounding him right now. Several experts are predicting John Slattery, especially because of his strong submission. But I’m giving the edge to Cumming, whose ruthless Eli Gold was humanized in THE GOOD WIFE’s stellar second season.\n\nWho I want to win: Peter Dinklage (GAME OF THRONES). I only recently jumped on the GAME OF THRONES bandwagon, and Dinklage has been my favorite part of the show. I would be thrilled if the scene stealer took home the prize for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister. But it’s at least just nice to see him nominated at the Emmys after his Oscar snub in 2003 for THE STATION AGENT.\n\nOUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A DRAMA\n\nNominees: Kelly Macdonald (BOARDWALK EMPIRE), Archie Panjabi (THE GOOD WIFE), Christine Baranski (THE GOOD WIFE), Margo Martindale (JUSTIFIED), Michelle Forbes (THE KILLING), Christina Hendricks (MAD MEN)\n\nWho will win: Margo Martindale (JUSTIFIED). She’s the favorite among prediction experts. I haven’t watched JUSTIFIED since the beginning of its first season, so unfortunately I can’t speak about Martindale’s performance. But I would say that her biggest competition comes from last year’s winner Archie Panjabi or BOARDWALK EMPIRE’s Kelly Macdonald.\n\nWho I want to win: Christina Hendricks (MAD MEN). I’ll always choose Joanie. Here’s why:\n\nOUTSTANDING LEAD ACTOR IN A COMEDY\n\nNominees: Jim Parsons (THE BIG BANG THEORY), Johnny Galecki (THE BIG BANG THEORY), Matt LeBlanc (EPISODES), Louis C.K. (LOUIE), Steve Carell (THE OFFICE), Alec Baldwin (30 ROCK)\n\nWho will win: Steve Carell (THE OFFICE). Carell should have won this award long ago, but all the experts agree this will finally be his year. It’s one of those “Just give it to him already!” awards. Carell turned in a fine performance in his final year at THE OFFICE, and it will be lovely to see him with the Emmy in his hand on Sunday.\n\nWho I want to win: Steve Carell (THE OFFICE). Even when I couldn’t stand Michael Scott, I always thought Carell did a hell of a job with the character. Plus, I just really like this guy. Sad he’s gone from THE OFFICE. Glad I get to keep watching him at the movies.\n\nOUTSTANDING LEAD ACTRESS IN A COMEDY\n\nNominees: Laura Linney (THE BIG C), Melissa McCarthy (MIKE & MOLLY), Edie Falco (NURSE JACKIE), Amy Poehler (PARKS AND RECREATION), Martha Plimpton (RAISING HOPE), Tina Fey (30 ROCK)\n\nWho will win: Laura Linney (THE BIG C). I’m so tired of Showtime’s stars getting nominated in comedy categories for work that is largely dramatic. I love Laura Linney. I really do. She’s been nominated for an Oscar three times, and I really hope she wins one soon. But her perfect record at the Emmys (3-0) scares the crap out of me because it gives her an edge when this award should be going to a comedic actress.\n\nWho I want to win: Amy Poehler (PARKS AND RECREATION). Poehler has the best chance of beating Linney in the category, but I’m just too pessimistic about the Emmys to believe it’s going to happen. This is the SNL alum’s fourth Emmy nomination, but according to IMDB, her only major award is “Best WTF Moment” at the MTV Movie Awards for peeing in a sink in BABY MAMA. She deserves so much more. (But to be fair, that was a really funny scene.)\n\nOUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTOR IN A COMEDY\n\nNominees: Chris Colfer (GLEE), Jesse Tyler Ferguson (MODERN FAMILY), Ed O’Neill (MODERN FAMILY), Eric Stonestreet (MODERN FAMILY), Ty Burrell (MODERN FAMILY), Jon Cryer (TWO AND A HALF MEN)\n\nWho will win: Ty Burrell (MODERN FAMILY). Four actors nominated from one show could result in vote splitting, giving the edge to Chris Colfer or Jon Cryer. But Ty Burrell seems to have enough buzz surrounding him this year to pull off a victory. The only actor in this race that I think could best him is Ed O’Neill, who was outrageously snubbed last year.\n\nWho I want to win: Ed O’Neill (MODERN FAMILY). Somehow this is O’Neill’s first Emmy nomination. That seems impossible when you think of how MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was on air for 11 seasons and how O’Neill’s Al Bundy is now considered one of the classic sitcom characters of the 1990s. But that’s the Academy for you. Now make it up to him by giving him an Emmy.\n\nOUTSTANDING SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A COMEDY\n\nNominees: Jane Lynch (GLEE), Betty White (HOT IN CLEVELAND), Julie Bowen (MODERN FAMILY), Sofia Vergara (MODERN FAMILY), Kristen Wiig (SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE), Jane Krakowski (30 ROCK)\n\nWho will win: Betty White (HOT IN CLEVELAND). Even though she could probably care less if she wins another Emmy, everyone loves her too damn much to deny her anything.\n\nWho I want to win: Sofia Vergara (MODERN FAMILY). Word has it she submitted a less-than-stellar episode. I would hate it if that hurt her chances because Vergara was the MVP of MODERN FAMILY in its second season. The writers finally let her be funny, and she truly came into her own as a comedic actress.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nFinally! Part 3 of 3 of “Returning Shows You Should Watch.” And this is just in time because some series begin premiering this week! Read Part 1 and Part 2 to see what else made my list, and read below to see why I think you should be watching PARKS AND RECREATION and FRINGE this fall.\n\nPARKS AND RECREATION (NBC)\n\nSorry MODERN FAMILY, but you weren’t the best comedy on network television this year. That honor goes to another mockumentary-style sitcom, PARKS AND RECREATION. It’s a shame we only got 16 episodes in the series’ third season, but who can complain when such a short season gave us a moment like this?\n\nPARKS & REC stars Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, an optimistic and loyal government worker who is second in command at the parks and recreation department in Pawnee, Indiana. Joining Leslie at the department is her libertarian boss, Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), and her co-workers Tom (Aziz Ansari), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O’Heir) and Donna (Rhetta). Rashida Jones plays Leslie’s best friend, Ann Perkins, and Chris Pratt plays the lovable and dumb Andy Dwyer. Joining Season 3 as regulars and government bureaucrats were Rob Lowe as Chris Traeger and Adam Scott as Leslie’s love interest, Ben Wyatt.\n\nI wasn’t always a fan of PARKS & REC. Please just skip its first season. (It’s only six episodes anyway.) After writing it off in the beginning, I picked it back up again in Season 2 when critic after critic told me I was missing out. Thanks, critics! By Season 2, PARKS & REC had found its heart and the right tone, and main character Leslie Knope had become warm, smart, relatable and funny. The credit for Leslie’s transformation goes to both the writers and to Poehler, who deserves the Emmy this year for her performance (even though she’ll unfairly lose to Laura Linney).\n\nThere is so much to love about PARKS & REC, but mostly I love the world that Greg Daniels and Michael Schur have created. Pawnee has drawn many comparisons to Springfield because of all the recurring townspeople who can be used at any time. My favorite scenes are the exasperating town hall meetings, which are much like Michael Scott’s conference room meetings if Michael invited every crazy person in Scranton instead of just the crazy people in his office. I love the Snakehole Lounge, I love the Bulge, and I hate the public library. I want Eagleton to suck it, and I genuinely fear Tammy 1. I love Pawnee so much that I want to move there and help expose the malpractices of the Sweetums candy factory. I can just room with April and Andy and buy them more frisbees to use as dinner plates.\n\nCan you watch Season 4 without having see the previous seasons? Yes, but you really should go back and watch Seasons 2 and 3 because they’re just so good and so funny. Skip Season 1.\n\nReturns Thursday, September 22 at 8:30/7:30c on NBC.\n\nFRINGE (FOX)\n\nFRINGE shares the honor with CHUCK as being “The Little Show That Could.” The sci-fi drama didn’t always attract such a small audience, but for the past two years it has been on the brink of cancellation before being saved at the 11th hour. The third season of FRINGE was moved to Friday, a time slot change that usually means the end for a series. But the show performed well for a Friday, and thank God it was renewed because it ended on a cliffhanger that has changed the entire multiverse. I’ll admit that I didn’t really watch FRINGE until this summer. I must have been crazy because I was missing out on one of the best TV mysteries out there.\n\nYes, FRINGE is a weekly procedural, but as the series has progressed, it has focused more and more on its mythology. Unfortunately, that makes it more difficult for new viewers to dive in, but FOX is trying to help with recap specials you can find here. The drama follows a group of people in the FBI’s Fringe Division, which investigates mysterious events that fall under the realm of “fringe” science, meaning the science that exists outside of established theories. The group includes FBI Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), troubled scientist Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and his brilliant and estranged son Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson).\n\nThe greatest character of them all is Walter, the archetypal mad scientist. While Olivia and Peter are compelling reasons to tune into FRINGE, Walter is the reason to stay. And John Noble plays Walter so expertly that I don’t even want to imagine what the character would be like in the hands of a lesser actor. Walter is brilliant, funny and warm, but he suffers from a history of dangerous arrogance and insanity, which has turned him into a sad and troubled man who has to cope with overwhelming guilt and the dark sins of his past. What I wouldn’t give to put Walter Bishop in a room with John Locke and just watch them debate faith, science and human nature. J.J. Abrams could arrange that, couldn’t he?\n\nCan you watch Season 4 without having seen previous seasons?
