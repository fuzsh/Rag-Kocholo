        "text": "In God, and Nobody Else, We Trust\n\nGidget tells Russ she hasn't a date for Saturday's Luau. Suddenly both seize on John, Anne's husband, as the logical last minute choice as an escort. Gidget's appeal for sisterly help puts Anne in a generous mood. She overrules John's protests, convincing him he could use his research at the Luau for a term paper. Before the Luau, Anne begins to worry when she sees how mature some of Gidget's girl friends are, particularly \"Treasure.\" Anne and Russ wait for the pair's return, until Anne, jittery, decides to go home. At the Luau, John achieves a unique notoriety with the kids by the direct, sensational nature of his field work questions. Unable to contain herself, Anne dons a Luau outfit and sets out for the party. Russ, deciding Gidget and John need protection from Anne, also heads for the beach. Arriving while John is really swinging, Anne lights into him, just as Russ is dragged from the bushes. At home, Russ moans that he'll never live down his reputation as a \"Peeping Tom,\" but Gidget concludes her friends will talk about her family for one reason, the love and protectiveness they showed for Gidget.\n\nThe Great Kahuna\n\nTwenty-eight year old Cass Cobb, known to the surfing set as the Great Kahuna, takes up with Gidget to fend off Buff, a blonde beauty who has followed him from Hawaii. Not only does her relationship with the older man fill her waking hours, but Gidget dreams of an idyllic life with him on a native island. Russ goes to the beach to meet Kahuna. To Gidget's disgust, they become friendly. Russ gets Gidget to invite Kahuna to dinner. Kahuna arrives, having completely divested himself of all traces of his unconventional way of life. Gidget is stunned when Kahuna tells of his plans to settle down to a normal, completely unromantic existence. Although Gidget feels she is the victim of a plot hatched by Russ and Kahuna, she tries to fit herself into Kahuna's plans. Before he leaves, Kahuna suggests she have a talk with her father. The next day, at the beach, Gidget reads two letters, one from Kahuna, the other from Jeff, at college. Kahuna's letter announces he is settling down with Buff in Oahu; Jeff's tells of his plans to roam the world until he is about thirty.\n\nDaddy Come Home\n\nProfessor Russell Lawrence complains that surfing has become an obsession with Gidget. Pointing to his involvement in his professional duties, Gidget persuades her father to spend time at the beach with her. There Russ meets Sally Combs, an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. Gidget becomes alarmed by her father's interest in Sally, especially when Larue refers to Sally as a gold digger. When Russ takes Sally to dinner, Gidget gets really worried. Her efforts to arouse Anne and John fail, particularly when John, echoing her father, says that she is projecting herself into a mother role. At a late hour, when Russ doesn't return, Gidget, imagination working overtime, decides he has met with an accident. Gidget phones the police. Officer Joe Hanley locates Sally and Russ and is nonplussed when he discovers Russ' age. He tells Russ his mother wants him. Russ arrives home, furiously decrying the fact that he believed he could treat Gidget as an adult. He relents when Gidget makes him understand that she was genuinely concerned about his wellbeing. Gidget concludes that the world's problems arise because there is some adult in every child and some child in every adult."
