        "text": "Michael Nader, star of the original 1980s soap opera “Dynasty” and “All My Children,” passed away on August 23, his wife said. He was 76.\n\nNader was best known for playing Dex Dexter on “Dynasty” and Dimitri Marick on “All My Children.”\n\n“With heavy heart, I’m sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael,” Nader’s wife Jodi Lister said in a statement via MichaelFairmanTV.com.\n\n“We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted,” said Lister. “Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of ‘Dynasty’ during Emma Samms’ virtual event to help raise funds for long-COVID research. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nNader died in his northern California home and the cause of death was an incurable type of cancer.\n\nThe Missouri native joined “Dynasty” in 1983 in the episode aptly named, “Dex.” As fans know, his character had an intense and passionate affair with Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins. He also played Dimitri Marick, the husband of Erica Kane (played by Susan Lucci) on “All My Children,” from 1991 to 2001 before reprising the role in 2013. Nadar’s résumé also included roles on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” the original “Flash,” “Magnum, P.I.” and “Gidget.”\n\nNader previously had a drug problem and came clean about it in 1984. He became sober in 1980, however, was charged with drunk driving in 1997. In 2001, he was arrested for attempting to sell cocaine to an undercover police officer, The Post reported.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and daughter Lindsay Michelle Nader. He was also the nephew of legendary “Sins of Jezebel” actor George Nader."
