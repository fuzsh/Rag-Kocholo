        "text": "The television world has lost a true icon. Michael Nader, known for his roles on iconic soap operas Dynasty and All My Children, has died. The veteran actor reportedly passed away this past Monday, August 23 following a bout with an untreatable form of cancer. Nader was 76 at the time of his death.\n\nMichael Nader’s wife, Jodi Lister, confirmed the news of his death to MFTV and revealed that she was by his side when he passed away at their Northern California home. In her statement, she remembered her husband fondly and reflected on he spent his last days:\n\nMichael Nader was born on February 19, 1945 in St. Louis Missouri though, after his parents divorced, he ultimately moved to California with his mother. The young Nader began his acting career in earnest in 1963 when he appeared in several Beach Party films from American International Pictures. And just a few years later, he began a recurring stint as the character of Siddo on the Sally Field-led comedy Gidget.\n\nBy the ‘70s, Michael Nader had earned the role of Kevin Thompson on As the World Turns, which he’d remain with from 1975 to 1978. But it wasn’t until the ‘80s that Nadar would truly mark his place in TV history. In 1983, he landed the role of the smooth Farnsworth \"Dex\" Dexter on ABC’s Dynasty, which paired him with his TV wife Joan Collins. Nader would stay with the show until it ended its run in 1989.\n\nAnd just a few years later, Michael Nader would get another shot at soap opera stardom when he was tapped to play Dimitri Marick in All My Children in 1991 and quickly became one of the show’s marquee stars. The actor was eventually let go from the show in 1999 due to budget constraints but was brought back in 2000, before being let go again in 2001 due to a highly publicized lawsuit. Nevertheless, he returned to the role of Dimitri one more time in 2013.\n\nMichael Nader leaves a lasting impact on the history of TV that goes beyond soaps. He also appeared in shows like The Flash, Cold Case and even Law & Order: SVU. He also starred alongside Christopher Reeve in The Great Escape II: The Untold Story. Nader leaves a significant void in the television industry, and his smooth and respectable presence will certainly be missed.\n\nWe here at CinemaBlend extended our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Michael Nader during this difficult time."
