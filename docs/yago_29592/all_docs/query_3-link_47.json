        "text": "Brooke and Dimitri\n\nby Santos and Marcie\n\nDimitri and Brooke had been acquaintances for many years, but they were\n\nnot close friends nor had they ever been romantically involved. They first met when Brooke did a story on Dimitri's wife Angelique in 1992. Edmund came to town because he and Angelique had grown up together and he wanted to make sure she was alright. He fell in love with Brooke and soon found out he and Dimitri were half brothers- they both had the same father.\n\nDimitri refused to believe that his father had an affair with Edmund's mother, who was a servant. This led to many, many fights between Edmund and Dimitri. Brooke often served as a peace-maker between the two brothers and continued in that role right up until Dimitri left town in 2000. Dimitri always listened to Brooke and she stood up to him on many occasions during the time Edmund was trying to prove his paternity. This was the basis of their friendship.\n\nIn 1997 there was a plane crash in which Maria, Edmund's wife, was killed. Brooke became romantically involved with the man responsible for the crash, Jim Thomasen, although she didn't know he was responsible at the time. Brooke became involved with Dimitri when Edmund asked Dimitri to help him investigate Jim Thomasen. When Brooke was told that Jim was responsible for the crash that killed Maria she was shattered and Dimitri put his arms around her and comforted her.\n\nEdmund was tracking down more information when he was abducted by\n\nThomasen and held captive in an aqueduct. Dimitri followed him there\n\nand rescued Edmund. Meanwhile, Brooke thought that both Edmund and\n\nDimitri were dead. She lured Jim to Stuart's Art Gallery and when he\n\nthreatened Jamie and taunted Brooke about what he was going to do to Jamie\n\nand that Edmund and Dimitri were dead, she shot him with a gun that\n\nDimitri had given her for protection.\n\nDimitri came to the Gallery and found Brooke holding the gun and Jim\n\ndead on the floor. When the police arrived he said that he had killed\n\nJim. After much questioning, Brooke was allowed to leave the Police\n\nStation and attempted to fly to Jamie on Dimitri's plane. While they\n\nwere in the airport, Brooke asked him why he was helping her and he\n\nadmitted that he was trying to improve his tarnished image. She\n\nlaughed at him....that he was using her, a woman who had just shot a man\n\nfour times in the back to improve his image. They talked more and became\n\ncloser. The assitant DA arrived arrived and arrested them both. They\n\nended up in adjoining cells. The spent part of the time singing old\n\ncamp songs and talking. [This was a very good episode as Dimitri stayed with her all night to keep up her spirits. This was when there were first\n\nsigns of attraction between them]. Dimitri paid Brooke's bail and they\n\nwere both released in the morning.\n\nBrooke's trial got underway and things were not going well, so Dimitri\n\nconvinced Brooke to take Jamie and leave the country.\n\nAfter much pressure from Tad/Dixie and Edmund, ...Dimitri told them\n\nwhere Brooke was and she returned and finished the trial. Thanks to\n\nsome pictures that Tad manufactured, she was found innocent.During the\n\ntrial, Brooke came to depend more and more on Dimitri and they became very\n\nclose. Dimitri had begun to have a romantic interest in Brooke and\n\nthey shared many close and tender moments.\n\nAt the party celebrating Brooke's acquittal Dimitri talked with Brooke\n\nand asked if they could continue their friendship. She turned him down\n\nand said that their relationship could go no further, that she was not\n\nready for a complicated relationship. Dimitri was crushed but\n\nunderstood.\n\nJust before the Crystal Ball, Brooke asked Dimitri if he would be her\n\nescort. She admitted to him that she regretted having turned him down\n\nafter her trial. But it was too late, he had already agreed to be\n\nErica's escort.\n\nBrooke and Edmund celebrate at Brooke's victory party after her acquittal for murder.\n\nEdmund and Dimitri talk to Belinda Kiefer during Brooke's murder trial."
