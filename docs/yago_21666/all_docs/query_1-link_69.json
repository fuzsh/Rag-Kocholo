Puppet Tales took place over four to six weekends in late winter /early spring. Wonder, tradition, storytelling, and music abounded in this series, where young, old, and everyone in between were invited to “step outside the (cardboard) box”; to imagine together; to be delighted and challenged by creatures of newspaper and cloth; to share our time, our dreams, and our tales.\n\nMore About Puppet Tales\n\nFeatured in Puppet Tales:\n\nOriginal works by Wise Fool artists: The Secret of Joy – a story of friendship, fear, and the persistence of honeybees; Sail – a puppet and aerial adaptation of the classic folktale The Crane Maiden; Coup de Circ: A Revolution in One Ring – an inspiring tale of compassion and rebellion set in the fantastical world of traveling circus; A Spoon for Every Fool; David and Dolliath; and more.\n\nGuest performances by regional artists including Puppet Theatre Los Titiriteros and Glad as Knives.\n\nCommunity experiences: Make-and-take puppet workshops, Puppet Slams, and Shadow Puppet Slams.\n\nWise Fool’s Repertory Puppet and Circus Shows\n\nH2O (2002)\n\nH20 is an outdoor physical theater performance set in a living visual installation. Cast and audience alike entered a landscape built by water and drought; home to creatures falling through the air, lumbering on stilts, and flickering by torchlight. Through their distinctive and highly physical combination of movement, stilts, puppetry, and aerial arts, Wise Fool pondered this substance on which all life depends, exploring the myriad ways in which water and lack of water impact our lives.\n\nThe Curtain (2001)\n\nWise Fool’s original work, The Curtain, performed for sell out audiences in Peñasco, Santa Fe, and Tucson AZ in late March and early April 2001. The Curtain addressed issues of borders and migration, personal, political and cultural. Created/directed by Wise Fool’s four core founding artists (coming from different cultural and social backgrounds) the making of the piece was a journey into each of our perceptions and fears. It was a piece which reached out and deeply affected many audience members, as well as changing the artists and their relationships to each other.\n\nThe piece involved seven performers, two musicians and two media artists in a rich weaving of the arts of puppetry, shadow puppetry, aerial fabric and ropes, stiltdancing and bungee, spoken word, slide and soundscape, dance, music and fire."
