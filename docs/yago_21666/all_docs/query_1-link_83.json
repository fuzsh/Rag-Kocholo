        "text": "Dear Moviegoers,\n\nPierce Brosnan‚Äôs charm can make almost any movie enjoyable. Almost. I remember the trailer for the family drama The Greatest, and how, during a particularly emotional moment on a beach, he delivers some heavy feeling with expressions one could just die for. Of course, his James Bond flicks were top-tier charismatic too, even the poorly considered Die Another Day. Indeed, the man is a star, and stars shine bright amid pure darkness.\n\nWhat of a black hole?\n\nFast Charlie, a Gulf South revenge thriller, features Brosnan as a wise hitman with a difficult-to-decipher accent that comes off as a Saturday Night Live impersonation of Hugh Hefner. It‚Äôs funny to hear him say gang member names like Beggar, which sounds like ‚ÄúBe-gah!‚Äù in his interpretation. His character, Charlie Swift (the fast one of the movie‚Äôs title), is one of three in the film that comes off as normal and competent, the two others are played by a female taxidermist (Morena Baccarin) and his aging boss (James Chan). Everyone else, some youngsters, is weird or entirely stupid and baffling.\n\nThe opening features one such dummy shooting himself in the face by accident, and crashing his car into an electric pole. Brosnan looks on and shrugs with a sigh. Fast Charlie is made up entirely of shrugs and sighs, and is a pathetic genre attempt set in the humid Deep South. Directed by Clear and Present Danger‚Äôs Phillip Noyce, I suspect some anxious post-production cutting that may have ruined an otherwise simple tale of contract killers and humorously dark and sticky situations. Outweighing the sometimes fun scraps and scrapes of Charlie‚Äôs adventure is lots of dialogue about taxidermy and confusingly boring anti-twists in the story that turns dull into bad.\n\nIt‚Äôs just bad. So‚Ä¶why does it have a Rotten Tomatoes score of 88% (at the time of this writing)? Brosnan being there, perhaps. One fine chase scene in a hotel, maybe. Grace for James Caan‚Äôs final performance could be. I don‚Äôt know why others like Fast Charlie, but I do know why I don‚Äôt. And, frankly, that‚Äôs all I can offer.\n\nThis movie is a black hole for good talent, sucking out most of the interesting from what should‚Äôve been a decent outing of a fun thriller. Instead, I couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle throughout to numb the ache in my heart. For that reason alone, I suppose I had an ok time with Fast Charlie. Wham, bam, thank you, Pierce.\n\nSuch a shame, and such a waste of New Orleans-area effort. One of Charlie‚Äôs hideouts is a building that ‚Äúnobody knows about‚Äù in the famous French Quarter. Inside was a very nice loft that shocked me big time, as it was NOT an Airbnb. That would‚Äôve been useful for someone. Bad for the city, but at least it‚Äôs nice to look at and be around. 1.5/5\n\nFast Charlie is now available for purchase and rental on demand.\n\nSincerely Yours in Moviegoing,\n\n‚öúÔ∏èüçø\n\nTip Jar"
