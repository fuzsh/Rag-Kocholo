        "text": "Mark of the Fool is an interesting story to me in how it epitomises the clich√© of \"in a good compromise, no one is happy\". The writing style is both solid and consistent, and chapters and scenes all flow together smoothly. Both the hook (the fool mark) and the world building are full of potential. Most reviews agree up to this point. But then the negative reviews diverge dramatically in exactly why they didn't like the story. Judging purely by the number of followers versus similarly ranked trending stories, I would say the author has done well to attract the broadest range of readers (even if many are not completely satisfied).\n\nThe story has an overarching 'big bad' plot that slowly advances in the background while, as expected from the title, the progression part of the progression fantasy occurs through both deceptively-relevant-slice-of-life and miniature combat story arcs. Both primary characters and secondary characters fit general archetypes and are developed with varying degrees of depth. It all fits together almost too neatly, with scene and chapter breaks sometimes being intentionally contrived and almost every new ability or description being a Chekhov's gun for a later chapter. However, it makes the narritive solid and easy to recall whilst cutting out narrative bloat, which I enjoy for a web serial doled out in small doses. Further, the sometimes-artificial construction ensures that every chapter shows some level of the progession promised by the story title (either of character growth or the main plot).\n\nBoth the author and his protagonists make clear and often obvious plans for the story direction and, given how solid the writing is, I for one enjoy it. Love it or hate it, I think most will find at least some aspect to enjoy if they give Mark of the Fool a chance.\n\nThe protagonist works so hard to overcome his weaknesses in magic and combat that he forgets about his strengths. Alex is neither a magician nor a fighter, he is a fool.\n\nThis doesn't mean that he shouldn't learn magic or how to handle himself in combat, but that the odds are heavily stacked against him, and he has to put in double the effort for half the gain. Again, he is ignoring what makes him strong.\n\nAlex's mark makes anything unrelated to combat, magic or divinity pathetically easy, by showing him the correct ways of doing what he wants to do.\n\nSo then, what could alex do to capitalize on his strengths? He could easily abuse the mark to do things like:\n\nIncrease his persuasion skills, skyrim style, and then gather many allies and subordinates; Learn how to read expressions to see if someone is lying; Become a merchant or something and get rich; Learn about strategy and tactics...\n\nThere are just so many things that alex could abuse, but I didn't see him even considering these other options, that suit him so well.\n\nThis story would be 100x better if Alex stopped obssessing on the weaknesses he can't fix, and learn to compensate them with his true strengths and with other people he can trust.\n\nAlex has to accept this reality or he will never take advantage of his full potential, and the story will never be more than just decent.\n\nPeople are super critics for the weirdest stuff on this site.\n\nI am not a super critic. The only times I will write a review is when I feel a story really deserves recognition, because the truth of RR's ranking system is anything less than a perfect 5.0 has a negative impact on the story's rank and I'd rather not do that to people.\n\nAnyways: Are there some things in this story that are not perfect? Well, yeah. Duh. It's a web-serial you can read for free on the internet. There are going to be a few tiny problems you can nitpick. But are any of these problems enough to make me feel this is less than a perfect 5 star story, relative to the other garbage I see all over this website?\n\nNo.\n\nThis story is fantastic.\n\nIt updates frequently and it's well thought out. The characters are interesting. The lore is great. The world building and magic systems are really fascinating. And unlike so many stories on this website: the protagonist is not a murder-hobo. Each chapter also does a good job of introducing another useful piece of information you can build with, which snowballs as the story continues and paints a larger picture of the world at work. There is also no real \"filler\" to be found, which I've found is extremely common once authors start realizing they're popular enough to make money.\n\nI'm not sure exactly how to describe this story, but D&D meets harry potter, meets something extra... that's probably close. This is all just my opinion (for whatever that's worth these days) but I feel this is a really good story. I recommend it, and I wish there were more stories like it.\n\nI think the story at heart has all the elements of being a great story. But it's way too childish for my liking sadly. I would have loved this story if it wasn't so pg-13. The thing is it still had great parts in between and thats what got me so far. But almost every chapter there is an interaction that makes me cringe. The best way I can explain it is, it's too sweet. The interactions are so sweet sometimes that I get a toothache. For example, mc creates some new thing with magic and shows it to his friends and it goes like this. \"omg guys look at this awsome thing I made\", \"wow mc that is so cool, it's going to be perfect when we need to use it\". \"Yeah I am so happy it's frigging great I love it\". And this goes through the entire group. If this happens once or twice, I am ok with it. But a lot of interaction go like this often times and it bothers me.\n\nNow despite that I don't think I should score the novel low. The author advertised it as pg-13 and gave a clear indication of what to expect. So I am still giving it a 4.5 because deep down it's really a nice story that I wish was more aimed at adults.\n\nAs a novel geek, I found the beginning of the series very interesting. mc is a smart and self-interested person. In addition, the family that has taken care of him since he was a child is too devoted to him and this is blinding. At the bottom, there is an article that I don't like about the series and contains spoilers. . .\n\n. mc decides to run away after the sign appears and wants to move on with his life despite everything. I respect that and thought that at least 1 volume would never see war. But mc tries to enter the first dungeon he sees alone? even at the end he enters the dungeon with his sister and the daughter of the accompanying family. mc and his gang somehow survive (no other explanation than the consecration of the lead). Then you say \"Okay, now he will take steps slowly while focusing on his own life, but no matter what trouble he is, he will be a head. Even the jokes repeat themselves in the series. Frankly, I even recommended it to my friends after reading the first 10 episodes. But I released it after the 30s. If I offended you, the author sorry."
