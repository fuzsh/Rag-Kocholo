        "text": "Romance is a game for fools\n\nI used to say\n\nA game I thought I'd never play\n\nRomance is a game for fools\n\nI said and grinned\n\nThen you passed by\n\nAnd here am I\n\nThrowing caution to the wind\n\nFools rush in where angels fear to tread\n\nAnd so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.\n\nThough I see the danger there\n\nIf there's a chance for me, then I don't care\n\nFools rush in where wise men never go\n\nBut wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?\n\nWhen we met, I felt my life begin\n\nSo open up your heart and let this fool rush in\n\nFools rush in where wise men never, never, never go\n\nEh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?\n\nAhh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin\n\nSo open up your heart and let this fool rush in\n\nJust open up your heart and let this fool rush on in\n\nJust open up your heart because I am coming in\n\nOpen up your heart and let this fool rush in\n\nWriter(s): RUBE BLOOM, JOHNNY MERCER<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
