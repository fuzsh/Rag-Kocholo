        "text": "1923\n\nWatchlist\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nEleanor Boardman and William Haines came to Hollywood when they were winners in the same contest held by the Goldwyn studios. While Boardman's star rose faster than Haines' (with Brown of Harvard, he would eventually catch up), they appeared together in this comedy-drama adapted from the play by Austin Strong. Claude Gillingwater, who played Findley on Broadway, reprises his role. Three men -- Findley (Craig Biddle Jr.), James Trumbull (Creighton Hale), and Gaunt (Raymond Hatton) -- are all in love with the same woman. Although none of them win her, the men remain lifelong pals. As old bachelors (Findley is played by Gillingwater, William H. Crane is Trumbull, and Gaunt is Alec B. Francis), they're surprised when Sydney Fairchild (Boardman) shows up. Sydney is the grown daughter of the girl they lost, and her mother has willed her to the three men. She brings light into their lives until a con who knows her father tries to kill Trumbull, a judge. Findley's nephew, Gordon Schuyler (Haines), helps her untangle the mess, and weds her in the bargain. Eventually, a real-life wedding would happen as a result of the film -- director King Vidor met Boardman while casting the picture, and they married in 1926."
