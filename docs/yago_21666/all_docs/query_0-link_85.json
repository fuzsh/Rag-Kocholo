Photo: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).\n\t\n\t<b>William 'Billy' Haines</b> (1900–1973) was an American film actor and interior designer. By the end of the silent era he was regularly named as the no. 1 male box-office draw of Hollywood. \n\t\n\tCharles William Haines was born in 1900 in Staunton, Virginia. He was the third child of George Adam Haines, a cigar maker, and Laura Virginia Haines (née Matthews). As a teenager, he ran off to live life on his own terms, moving to New York City and becoming friends with such later Hollywood luminaries as designer Orry-Kelly and Cary Grant. In 1922, Billy was discovered by talent scout Bijou Fernandez discovered Haines as part of the Samuel Goldwyn Company's 'New Faces of 1922' contest and the studio signed him to a $40 a week contract. Haines' career began slowly, as he appeared in extra and bit parts, mostly uncredited. His first significant role was in <i>Three Wise Fools</i> (King Vidor, 1923). His career gained momentum when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures where he received favourable reviews for his role in <i>The Midnight Express</i> (George W. Hill). Haines then was cast in <i>Little Annie Rooney</i> (William Beaudine, 1925) with Mary Pickford, and <i>Brown of Harvard</i> (Jack Conway, 1926). The latter role solidified his screen persona as a wisecracking, arrogant leading man. Haines' string of hits continued with <i>Show People</i> (King Vidor, 1928), costarring Marion Davies. \n\t\n\tWilliam Haines was a top-five box office star from 1928 to 1932. He made a successful transition into sound films in the part-sound film <i>Alias Jimmy Valentine</i> (Jack Conway, 1928). His first all-sound film, <i>Navy Blues</i> (Clarence Brown, 1929), was released the following year. He starred in the comedy <i>Way Out West</i> (Fred Niblo, 1930). The 1930 Quigley Poll, a survey of film exhibitors, listed Haines as the top box office attraction in the country. In 1933, Haines was arrested in a YMCA with a sailor he had picked up in Los Angeles' Pershing Square. Louis B. Mayer, the studio head at MGM, allegedly delivered an ultimatum to Haines: Choose between a sham marriage (also known as a 'lavender marriage') or his relationship with his life partner Jimmy Shields. Haines chose Shields and they remained together for almost 50 years. Mayer subsequently fired Haines and terminated his contract. Haines made a few minor films at Poverty Row studios and quit acting in 1935. He started a successful interior design business with Shields, and was supported by friends in Hollywood, like Joan Crawford and Marion Davies. He did major work for Jack L. Warner and the Bloomingdales, and refurbished the American ambassador's residence in London. William Haines died of lung cancer in  1973 at the age of 73.\n\t\n\tSources: Tony Adam (IMDb), Wikipedia and IMDb.",
