        "meta_description": "Legendary child star Margaret O'Brien, is considered by most film critics and historians as the greatest \"little\" actress of all times. O'Brien, a gifted dramatic performer, was one of the most popular movie stars of the 1940's. At age three she expressed a serious desire to pursue acting while posing for magazine covers for photographer Paul Hesse, and the rest is movie history.Her film debut was a one-minute scene in \"Babes on Broadway\" (1941). Studio Executives were amazed at her extraordinary talent and cast her in \"Journey For Margaret\" (1942), as the little orphan girl during the war. Overnight, Margaret O'Brien soared to major stardom! She was heralded as a \"sensation,\" a \"child genius,\" and MGM wisely signed her to as long-term contract.Margaret remained the biggest child star throughout the 1940's, being a number one box office attraction. Her unforgettable performance as \"Tootie\" in Vincente Minnelli's \"Meet Me In St. Louis\" (1944), with Judy Garland as her co-star, earned her an Academy Award and the position of the highest paid entertainer in the nation.Margaret turned out spectacular performances in such classics as \"The Canterville Ghost\" (1944) and \"Unfinished Dance\" (1947). Her brilliant work in \"The Secret Garden\" (1948) and \"Little Women\" (1949) immortalized her in the tear-filled eyes of audience's worldwide. Additional movie successes (more than thirty in all) included \"Three Wise Fools,\" \"Jane Eyre,\" \"Bad Bascomb,\" \"Tenth Avenue Angel,\" and \"Music for Millions.\"Margaret O'Brien masterfully performed roles requiring acting experience far beyond her years. The admiration of her acting colleagues and her loyal audience won her the title \"America's favorite sweetheart.\" Margaret was a beloved treasure of the movies and the adoring public. Her millions of fans collected Margaret O'Brien dolls, hats, paper dolls, coloring books and dozen of other Margaret O'Brien products. In fact, film star product endorsements reached an all time high in the mid-forties, due largely because of Margaret O'Brien.Achieving super star status during Hollywood's \"Golden Era,\" provided a career most actors can only dream of. Today Margaret continues to receive film and starred on many television shows, including, \"Murder She Wrote\" and \"Tales From the Darkside.\" Margaret remains very active in charitable affairs and most recently completed the new film, \"Natasha\" for ABC television. Margaret was born Angela Maxine O'Brien on January 15, 1937 in Los Angeles, California. Her father, a circus rider, died shortly before she was born. Her mother, Gladys, was a flamenco dancer. Margaret found work at a tender age as a child model, often appearing on magazine covers. MGM spotted her and hired her for a bit part in Babes on Broadway (1941). She can be seen at the ripe old age of four auditioning for James Gleason, \"Please, Warden, don't send my brother to the chair!\"Gladys worked to get Margaret tested for the lead role in Journey for Margaret, which she easily won, and she was on her way to being the premiere child star of the 1940s. Margaret was not, however, a typical child performer. She displayed a pathos on the screen unlike any other child performer before her. Her presence is almost eerie at times, transcending precociousness to the point of seeming like a mature, wizened person trapped in a child's body.Journey for Margaret was successful, and so was Margaret. MGM signed her to a seven-year contract. Unfortunately, Margaret's acting ability was far beyond that needed for most child roles, so scripts were hard to find for her. She found small roles in films such as Thousands Cheer and Jane Eyre, before finally landing the role that vaulted her to stardom: Tootie in Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), for which she won a special Oscar, and the affection of the movie-going public.",
