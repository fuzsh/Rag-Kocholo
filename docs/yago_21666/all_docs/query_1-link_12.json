        "text": "You will need a soft heart—and, quite likely, an even softer head—to get any satisfaction out of Metro's \"Three Wise Fools\" which came yesterday to the Capitol with Margaret O'Brien as its star. For the whimsical gentlemen at the studio have given the old Austin Strong play such a merciless Peter Panning, such a messing up with quasi-Barrie mores, that it oozes the most egregious sentiment and drips verbal lollipops.Perhaps you will comprehend us when we tell you that the story is told as to a group of scoffing pixies by an ancient leprechaun who has ears like a yearling donkey and lives in an old oak tree. And it is of an arch young maiden who comes from Ireland in 1910 to live under painful sufferance in the home of three crabby old men. Being a native of Ireland, this young lady quite naturally believes in the actual presence of fairies and in their supernatural powers, and she spends a great deal of time endeavoring to persuade the three old men of same.Finally it comes to a question of whether the old oak tree is to be felled, with the three old men arguing for it and the Irish lass arguing against. And when they try to confuse her with midgets, dressed up as leprechauns, she runs away to a convent and tries to take the veil. Whereupon the mother superior gives the old men a piece of her mind, which immediately changes their sentiments and the old oak tree is saved—all of which makes the little maiden, the fairies and, presumably, us very glad.But it did not dispose this observer any more kindly towards the film, for the few sparks of interest that were kindled in earlier moments had been thoroughly drenched by then. So liquefied is the whimsey that John McDermott and James O'Hanlon have penned and so oleaginous is the sentiment that umbrellas and raincoats are urged.Miss O'Brien, who has thoroughly mastered all the juvenile attitudes intended to pulverize fond parents, puts them all to full use in this film and adds the prodigious accomplishment of speaking in a winsome Irish brogue. As her bibulous bodyguard and servant, Thomas Mitchell kicks the brogue around, too, and generally calls up recollections of an Irish comic on the vaudeville stage. Lionel Barrymore, Lewis Stone and Edward Arnold grump and grin as the three old men, and Harry Davenport drools benignly as the ancient leprechaun. The writers and Director Edward Buzzell exercised one restraint, at least: they didn't permit Mr. Davenport to ask the audience if they believe in fairies at the end.On the stage at the Capitol are Roddy McDowall, the youthful film star, making a personal appearance; Martha Tilton, Jimmy Edmondson and Paul Whiteman and his orchestra.\n\nTHREE WISE FOOLS, screen play by John McDermott and James O'Hanlon, based on the play by Austin Strong; directed by Edward Buzzell; produced by William H.
