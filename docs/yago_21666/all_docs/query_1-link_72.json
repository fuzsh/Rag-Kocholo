        "text": "When “Black Swan” came out last year, it brought back memories for former child star Margaret O’Brien. She played a dancer in another dark ballet drama set against “Swan Lake” back in 1946 — “The Unfinished Dance,” recently released on DVD by the Warner Archive Collection manufacture-on-demand service.\n\n“My mother, who had seen a French movie based on the story, brought the idea to MGM,” says O’Brien. “She was a famous dancer, a lead dancer with the Cansinos — Rita Hayworth’s parents. When she was touring, I slept in a dresser drawer at the Waldorf-Astoria.”\n\nO’Brien, who became a major star in movies like “Journey for Margaret” (1942) and “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944) spent six months training to play a ballet student in “The Unfinished Dance.”\n\n“I was seven years old and I had some ballet teachers from Russia who wanted me to go to Russia and live with them and become a ballerina. When MGM found out, they got very angry and hired another teacher who completed the movie.”\n\nIn the film, O’Brien plays a student who becomes fantatically devoted to the lead dancer in the ficticious New York ballet company, played by Cyd Charisee. When her idol is passed over for the lead in “Swan Lake” in favor of a foreign ballerina played by Karen Booth, O’Brien plays a prank that goes horribly awry and ends the interloper’s career.\n\n“Cyd Charisse was one of the most beautiful dancers,” O’Brien recalled. “She also played my grandmother from Ireland in [a flashback sequence of] ‘Three Wise Fools’ ” O’Brien says. “Karen Booth was a beautiful woman, but she didn’t do every dance. They had to use a double. At first, they were going to have someone else double my dancing, but I’m proud to say it’s all me in the final film.”\n\n“The Unfinished Dance” is the screen debut of Danny Thomas, who plays the boyfriend of O’Brien’s aunt and the child’s default guardian. He also supported O’Brien in her next film, “The Big City” (1947). “He was wonderful to work with, and I used to play with his daughter Marlo when she would come to visit the set. Her name was Margaret at the time.”\n\n“I loved my life at MGM,” she says of the studio where she was under contract for seven years. “Mostly I had a private tutor because I was working so much, but sometimes I took classes at the little schoolhosue on the lot,” she recalls. “Most of the girls were older and not in my grade, so I went to classes with Dean Stockwell, Butch Jenkins and Bobby Blake. Bobby was a lovely child. He was so sweet and he really remembers when you were nice to him. I always made sure he had a Christmas present, and whenever somebody honors me Bobby is always there. I was also in class with Claude Jarman Jr. I had sort of a crush on him.”\n\nShe notes sadly that with the passing of Elizabeth Taylor, she’s the last surviving cast member of the 1949 remake of “Little Women” with June Allyson and Janet Leigh. “We all thought we were so lucky to appear in a movie based our favorite book,” she says. “Elizabeth was sweet and wonderful and did so much for people besides being an actress. There are many people alive today because of Elizabeth Taylor.”\n\n“I loved working with Charles Laughton on ‘The Canterville Ghost,’ ” O’Brien says, referring to a 1944 comedy that’s also available from the Warner Archive. “I imagined he would be scary to work with but he was the nicest person. He treated me like an adult actress,” she says.\n\n“Everbody I worked with at MGM was wonderful except for Wallace Beery [in 1946’s ‘Bad Bascomb’]. He didn’t like children, but he was a great actor. Everybody thought he adored me when they saw the movie!”\n\nO’Brien says she “really admires what Natalie Portman did in ‘Black Swan,’ which was a wonderful movie. Dancing is very hard on your toes. I want to thank the [Warner Archive Collection] for bringing back these movies, particularly ‘The Unfinished Dance.’ I think young people will love it.”"
