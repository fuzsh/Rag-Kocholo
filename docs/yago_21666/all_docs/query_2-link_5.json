When the girl is falsely suspected of involvement with a robbery, the old men come to her aid and the real culprit is ultimately apprehended.[5]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nClaude Gillingwater as Theodore Findley\n\nEleanor Boardman as Rena Fairchild / Sydney Fairfield\n\nWilliam H. Crane as Hon. James Trumbull\n\nAlec B. Francis as Dr. Richard Gaunt\n\nJohn St. Polis as John Crawshay (as John Sainpolis)\n\nWilliam Haines as Gordon Schuyler\n\nLucien Littlefield as Douglas\n\nZaSu Pitts as Mickey\n\nMartha Mattox as Saunders\n\nCreighton Hale as Young Trumbull\n\nRaymond Hatton as Young Gaunt\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of producer Samuel Goldwyn’s many outstanding literary acquisitions, Three Wise Fools was written by playwrights Austin Strong and Winchell Smith. Vidor approached the “prestigious property” with alacrity. He would make one more film for Samuel Goldwyn Productions, Wild Oranges (1924) shortly before Goldwyn’s outfit was absorbed by Louis B. Mayer under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios.[6]\n\nThree Wise Fools is noted as an early high-profile role for the then-up and coming William Haines. Haines would later recall that he felt distracted by the top hat he wears in the film and, as a result, felt that his performance was terrible. However, his performance received positive notices in contemporary reviews, and Haines was offered a choice of four new film roles after the film's success.[3] The other members of the movie cast also enjoyed successful careers, including Eleanor Boardman, Creighton Hale, Raymond Hatton, Zazu Pitts and Claude Gillingwater, the only cast member from the original 1918 Broadway play.[7][8]\n\nIt showed in Germany at the Union-Theater Nollendorf, Berlin, on November 10, 1924.[4] The cinema was built in 1913 by Joe Goldsoll, aka F. J. Godsol, who was president of Goldwyn Pictures from 1922-1924.[5]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nMoving Picture World wrote approvingly “King Vidor has reproduced the atmosphere, comedy and romance [of the stageplay] with great success, and elaborated considerably on the suspense angle.” [9]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBaxter, John. 1976.
