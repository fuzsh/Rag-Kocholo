The US Army’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) has awarded a contract to Robotic Research on autonomous unmanned systems teaming and collaboration (AUSTC) for counter weapons of mass destruction (counter-WMD).

Valued at $9m, the contract will continue for a period of three years and will also help support a range of additional missions in challenging subterranean and other environments.

Under the deal, the company will be responsible for carrying out AUSTC technical demonstrations of autonomous unmanned systems sensing technologies, in addition to designing and developing new and more advanced unmanned systems technologies.

AUSTC focuses on enhancing autonomy, 3D / 4D mapping, localisation, target identification, tracking, collective 3D visualisation, weapons system integration of unmanned autonomous systems, and subterranean communications.

“The Robotic Research team shares the army leadership’s commitment to rapidly fielding effective autonomous counter-WMD solutions for our nation’s troops.”

Robotic Research president Alberto Lacaze said: “It is a great honour to expand our work for the US Army, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the special forces community on the family-of-systems for autonomous collaborative robotic teaming in support of challenging subterranean missions.

“The Robotic Research team shares the army leadership’s commitment to rapidly fielding effective autonomous counter-WMD solutions for our nation’s warfighters.”

The AUSTC effort follows Robotic Research’s ongoing small business innovative research contracts in support of the mobile autonomous counter-WMD system, increment B (MACS-B) programme.
