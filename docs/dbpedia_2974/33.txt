The US Army’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) has taken delivery of a two-arm highly dexterous manipulation system (HDMS) from RE2 Robotics.

The HDMS has been supplied as part of an Army Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II extension contract.

The dual-arm HDMS technology can be used for explosive ordnance disposal, as well as combat engineering and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosives (CBRNE) operations.

The manipulator’s arms allow operators to perform complex tasks, such as securing an object with one arm and manipulating with the other.

"The direct benefit of the HDMS technology to army personnel is significantly increased performance and capability over currently fielded manipulators."

RE2 Robotics president and CEO Jorgen Pedersen said: "The direct benefit of the HDMS technology to army personnel is significantly increased performance and capability over currently fielded manipulators for both tele-operated and semi-autonomous use on mobile robot platforms.

"These manipulation improvements directly correlate to a reduction in time-on-target and overall mission time, resulting in increased safety for all mission personnel."

RE2 Robotics said that HDMS provides capabilities that exceed currently fielded, single-manipulator robots, which are often limited in their dexterity, reach and lifting capacity.

In February, the company obtained a $1m Phase II SBIR programme to develop a biomechanical exoskeleton simulator system for the army.

The simulator will allow the army to more accurately predict musculoskeletal stress on military personnel wearing devices, such as robotic exoskeletons.

The company is collaborating with biomechanical exoskeleton experts at Ekso Bionics, Stanford University, and the University of Pittsburgh to design and test the simulator.
