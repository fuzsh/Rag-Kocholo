The United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center (CCDCAC), or Armaments Center, headquartered at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, is the US Army's primary research and development arm for armaments and munitions. Besides its Picatinny headquarters, the Armaments Center has three other research facilities, including Benét Laboratories.[3] The Armaments Center works to develop more advanced weapons using technologies such as microwaves, lasers and nanotechnology. The Armaments Center was established in February 2019, when it was aligned with the United States Army Futures Command along with its senior organization, the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command. Armaments Center was called the U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC).

The Armaments Center is the R&D center for armaments used by the U.S. Army, United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and other U.S. military organizations. It is one of the specialized research, development, and engineering centers within the U.S. Army Futures Command. Armaments Center's purpose is to provide battlefield supremacy for U.S. troops through “overmatch capabilities.” Over the past 10 years, Armaments Center has developed and released more than 20 products that have provided U.S. troops with “world’s best” capabilities, compared with products from foreign military and other U.S. defense organizations.[4]
