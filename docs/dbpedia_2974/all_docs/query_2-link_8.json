        "text": "Our Mission\n\nEnsuring continued U.S. military dominance against current and future threats requires a vigorous and innovative Defense Research Enterprise. Managing this enterprise under budget and resource constraints, however, requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology to optimally balance effectiveness and efficiency while working to fulfill the national priorities defined by Departmental guidance. Defense Research Operations supports the ASD(R&E) mission by delivering comprehensive, cogent insight into and oversight of the activities and capabilities of the DoD laboratories, a significant facet of the broad array of governmental, academic, and industrial research and engineering efforts.\n\nDoD FFRDC\n\nDoD-supported FFRDCs are independent, not-for-profit, private-sector organizations that are established and funded to meet special long-term engineering, research, development, or other analytic needs that cannot be met as effectively by other private-sector or government resources.\n\nDoD UARC\n\nDoD-supported UARCs are non-profit research organizations affiliated with universities and have a set of core competencies – areas of domain expertise or specialization – that are tailored to the long-term needs of the Department.\n\nDoD Science and Technology Reinvention Laboratories\n\nAn STRL is an organizational designation, historically through a National Defense Authorization Act or designated as such by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, that conveys certain legislated flexibilities to a Military Service research laboratory or center.\n\nDefense Laboratory Enterprise\n\nARMY\n\nalabama-army-2\n\ntransparent\n\n600\n\n#112e51\n\nArmy Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences: Aviation Training Research (Institutional Training) ARI (ATR(IT))\n\nLocation: Ft Rucker • State: AL\n\nARI’s Science and Technology (S&T) research mission is to create and provide innovative behavioral and social science solutions that enable the Army to provide ready forces and force capabilities. As part of ARI’s effort to maximize personnel readiness and combat effectiveness, there are three main areas of focus; ARI is working (1) to develop innovative measures and methods to improve/enhance the Soldier lifecycle and human capital management, (2) to conduct scientific assessments and provide behavioral and social science advice to human resource policies, (3) to develop fundamental theories and investigate new research areas in the behavioral and social sciences with high potential impact on Army issues.\n\nAviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center AMRDEC (Headquarters)\n\nLocation: Redstone Arsenal • State: AL\n\nThe U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), a subordinate laboratory to the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), is the Army's focal point for providing research, development, and engineering technology and services for aviation and missile platforms across the lifecycle.

Since 1957, when the Army created the first program office for ballistic missile defense, the command has dedicated itself to missile defense research, development and deployment. In December 1962, the command made history with the first successful intercept of an ICBM reentry vehicle with the Nike-Zeus. History was repeated in the 1980s with a new non-nuclear technology. The kinetic energy concept of “hitting a bullet with a bullet” was first proven in June 1984 with the intercept of an ICBM warhead in the Homing Overlay Experiment. In 1987, the Flexible Lightweight Agile Guided Experiment confirmed the concept against shorter-range tactical missiles. Nearly a decade later, the command demonstrated the missile defense applications of directed energy systems.\n\nUS Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory USAARL\n\nLocation: Fort Rucker • State: AL\n\nThe USAARL's mission is to preserve and enhance the health, safety, combat effectiveness, and survivability of the U.S. Army Aviator and the Soldier.

Researchers at ARL West hope to use concepts that have been instrumental to simulation training for another purpose--advancing human interaction and decision making in theater. Most of the early collaboration at ARL West will support high-performance computing and computational data fusion--ultimately allowing ARL to effectively present data from the laboratory in a way that enhances the warfighter's tactical edge. ARL West will bring together experts with several distinct fields, with backgrounds in areas such as computational sciences, sensors, and human factors. Thus far, the Department of Defense has had limited engagement with the small technology start-ups and the venture capitalists on the West Coast.
