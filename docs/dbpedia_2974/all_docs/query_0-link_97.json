        "text": "ARDEC’s Innovation Initiatives • Social Media: • Social Media applications. Since we are a US Government defense agency, we need to be cognizant of what technical or operational information can be disseminated in a public forum. Generally we are not allowed to discuss that type of information in a public forum, but can provide approved generic information in those forums. Obvious this challenges what we can provide to the public to inform them of the great work we are doing and to get potential feedback on some of our ideas.\n\nARDEC’s Innovation Initiatives • Crowd Sourcing Tools: • We are piloting a “crowd sourcing” tool that allows employees to enter ideas into a system and have other employees either vote or “buy stock” in an idea and allow the most likely idea to succeed to rise to the top to be selected for funding.\n\nARDEC’s Innovation Initiatives • General Discussion: • ARDEC’s customer is the Warfighter. • Although they are based in the US, when deployed they sometimes generate new requirements to satisfy their immediate needs. • Solutions can come from local sources (not the best solution, but can be done quickly) or usually are provided by the DoD components (best solution, but not timely). • Feedback from your customers is critical! • Describe your approach for reaching out to your global customers and how you provide them with Innovative solutions."
