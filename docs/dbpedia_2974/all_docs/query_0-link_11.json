        "text": "How Establishing a Standard-Based Asset Management System Can Increase Manufacturing Efficiency\n\nCommercial manufacturers have begun searching for ways to improve system and equipment availability, traceability, and real-time production monitoring while reducing the cost of operations. Major contributors to increased cost, inferior quality and reduced system utilization are unplanned outages, non-integrated processes and redundant capital and infrastructure costs. TechSolve can help manufacturers implement a standard-based asset management system that is not only cost effective, but also flexible enough to accommodate various technical requirements and changing business processes.\n\nAn Intelligent Manufacturing System\n\nUnder a cooperative agreement, TechSolve and the U.S. Army’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Benét Laboratories developed the Intelligent Manufacturing Applications and Practices (IMAP) system. The goal of the project was to establish a machining system that employs both pre-process and in-process technology applications to analyze the performance of machining-based manufacturing systems. This would therefore enable informed decision-making that can achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings in manufacturing facilities, while continuously supporting manufacturing process optimization.\n\nThe first demonstration of this state-of-the-art technology and process occurred with a U.S. Army mortar system component. Improvements to the manufacturing process for the mortar system component highlighted the importance of combining a variety of advanced machining technologies. In this instance, the time to machine one side of the component was reduced by over 70%.\n\nReduction in Cost, Cycle Time, and Scrapped Components\n\nThis collaboration between ARDEC Benét Labs and TechSolve showed the impact of developing methods to test and implement a unique combination of advanced technologies such as stability zone analysis, along with intelligent process planning, to yield a more favorable outcome than either technology could have provided separately.\n\nTransition technology disseminated and developed under the Smart Machine Platform Initiative into a DoD production environment resulted in reduced costs, reduced cycle time and fewer scrapped components. It also:\n\nIncreased productivity through optimization of machining parameters;\n\nReduced part costs;\n\nEnhanced facility efficiencies;\n\nBrought safety improvements;\n\nEstablished process verifications; and\n\nGuided machinability testing and evaluations.\n\nTechnology That Benefits the Bottom Line\n\nAt TechSolve, we help manufacturers understand technology so they can adopt it confidently—enabling you to manufacture parts more efficiently and benefit the customers you serve. Whether it’s gleaning data from your system to find improvements, conducting advanced sensor studies or running simulations without taking your process offline, contact us at info@techsolve.org or complete the form below to find out how we can help."
