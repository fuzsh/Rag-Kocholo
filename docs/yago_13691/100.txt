The Officers' Ward (La chambre des officiers)

(Francois Dupeyron, 2001, 135 min, France, in French with English subtitles, Color, Blu-Ray)

The Officers' Ward gives us a very different vision of battle, when horses and cavalry charged for the last time and men had their faces destroyed beyond recognition for the first time. This award-winning film gives us a sober meditation on the Great War and its terrible new casualties: from a one night stand between a soldier and a nurse, to the front, to the hospital clinic. Through poignant performances, we see soldiers, nurses,and ordinary men and women confront what is inhuman about war.
