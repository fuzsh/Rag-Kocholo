        "text": "The Art of Walking: Pedestrian Mobility in Literature, Philosophy, and the Arts from the Eighteenth to the Twenty-First Century\n\nInternational Conference – École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, October 10-12, 2013\n\nOrganizers: Klaus Benesch (LMU Munich) and François Specq (École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, CNRS LIRE)\n\nThey are looking for papers that engage the conceptual, cultural, textual, and visual dimensions of walking. Contributions may deal with how walking has become an aesthetic program, a form of reflection or a complex, frequently ambivalent metaphor; they may also discuss walking in light of its historical, ideological, aesthetic, philosophical, and poetical implications, or investigate two or more of these aspects jointly. Or they may ask how one can delineate the semantic field of ‘walking,’ which may evoke, among others, the notions of ‘rambling,’ ‘sauntering,’ ‘roaming,’ ‘hiking,’ or ‘perambulating,’ but also of the Aristotelian ‘peripatetic’ and, following Baudelaire and Walter Benjamin, of the “flâneur.” What are the values attached to these practices? How does walking enhance our knowledge of a specific place or environment? Are there differences between walking in ‘nature’ and walking in an urban environment? To what extent has walking reinforced or, perhaps, questioned the distinction between the rural and the urban? If major texts in this tradition, such as Rousseau’s Reveries of a Solitary Walker and Wordsworth’s The Excursion, focus on the countryside, walking is not only, nor even primarily, a rural phenomenon, but is also typical of urban modernity. How has walking as a literary genre evolved throughout the modern period, and, how, following its heyday during the Romantic period, has it been redefined in connection to modernist issues? To what extent does the aesthetics of the ordinary and of chance, which seem to be associated with walking, relate to aspects of postmodern nomadology? Is walking gendered?\n\nThey encourage submissions from scholars in a variety of fields and disciplines. Interdisciplinary approaches are especially welcome.\n\nProposals for 20-minute papers (title and 200-word summary) should be sent to both Klaus Benesch and François Specq, by email before April 15, 2013.\n\nklaus.benesch@lmu.de\n\nFrancois.Specq@ens-lyon.fr\n\nCall for Expressions of Interest in joining.\n\nSunday 16 June – Sunday 7 July 2013.\n\nProject initiated by Mick Douglas and Beth Weinstein.\n\nA rising awareness of and interest in mobility. A road trip starting and finishing in Tucson, Arizona. Collaborative creative investigation in the space-times of American deserts. Engaging the performing body, the mobile social body, a body of mobile infrastructure, and relations to desert ecologies. Learning from land art. Performance presentations in process and en route, with a finale event in Tucson. Twelve people temporarily collected.\n\nThis practice-based performance research project aims to enable collaborative peer-to-peer conditions for a group of creative practitioners and researchers to extend their performative practices and generate new works and working relationships that engage with mobility. The Performance Studies International (PSi) conference is enfolded into the middle of the 3-week journey. For the conference, the project collaborators will present a daily morning praxis event in the grounds of the Stanford campus. The project is intended to inform practices for PSi Fluid States 2015 as a mobile and distributed event process.\n\nPSi conference attendees and lingerers are invited to submit an expression of interest to collaborate. Travel will be via two vehicles, and overnight camping. Estimated on-ground costs to be shared (excluding PSi conference and accommodation costs) will be US$800, plus camp equipment hire if needed. Whilst preference will be given to collaborators wishing to collaborate in the full journey, we are accepting expressions of interest to participate in only the pre-PSi Tucson to Palo Alto passage (June 16 – 26), or the post-PSi Palo Alto to Tucson passage of the project (June 30 – July 7). Selection will be based on contribution to a collaborative and open process.\n\nExpressions of interest due 5pm Friday 29 March 2013. For more info go to:\n\nwww.performingmobilities.net\n\nQueries: info(at)performningmobilities(dot)net\n\n# # Note for walking artists: whilst the project is dependant upon traversing large tracts of land via vehicles, it is intended that a significant aspect of the creative research focus will be toward experience in landscape on foot.\n\nSaturday, 23 March 2013 from 13:30 to 17:25\n\nLincolnshire, United Kingdom\n\nAlison Lloyd is walking at the same time as Andrew Brown on the 23rd March 2013, between two methodist chapels in Lincolnshire. Alison will walk North and Andrew will walk South between the chapels in Wellingore and Waddington.\n\nThe commission is from the Post Methodists and part of their Broadcaster. Here is a link to the Post Methodists and a link to the walk and booking.\n\nhttp://www.postmethodists.org/page2.htm\n\nMeet at Wellingore, Reading Room & Chapel, High Street, Wellingore, Lincoln LN5 0HW at 1:30pm and walk NORTH to Waddington, The Methodist Chapel along six miles of the Viking Way, with extensive views out across Lincolnshire by way of Harmston, Coleby, Boothby Graffoe, and Navenby, also known as the ‘Cliff Villages’.\n\nOR\n\nMeet at Waddington, The Methodist Chapel, High Street, Waddington, Lincoln LN5 9RF at 1:30pm and walk SOUTH to Wellingore, Methodist Chapel along six miles of the Viking Way, with extensive views out across Lincolnshire by way of Navenby, Boothby Graffoe, Coleby, and Harmston, also known as the ‘Cliff Villages’.\n\nYou will need suitable footwear and clothing for the walk and be prepared to walk the six miles one way. Bring snacks for extra energy, food and drink, and a rucksack to carry it all in. The walks will take place whatever the weather brings on the day.\n\nBuses run between the two villages and to provide an added incentive the respective chapels will provide refreshments at the end of the walk.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SUNDERLAND AND NORTHERN GALLERY FOR CONTEMPORARY ART\n\n28-29 JUNE 2013\n\nThe last decade seen an upsurge in the study of walking across many disciplines; many walking-related events and research groups have been established in the arts and within academia. This two-day conference, held at the University of Sunderland, and organised by the research group W.A.L.K. (www.WALK.uk.net), and in association with WALK ON, an exhibition at the Northern Gallery of Contemporary Art, aims to provide a critical and discursive meeting-point for artists, writers, thinkers, and academics who are engaged in the study of walking, documenting the many diverse approaches to the study of walking.\n\nON WALKING seeks to examine and interrogate the practice and process of walking in all its cultural, ethnographic, poetic, and geographical ramifications. It seeks to bring together innovative and speculative ideas on walking, to consider walking in relation to landscape, social, cultural, artistic, vocalic, and geographical constructions of space. Papers that consider any aspect addressed in the titular acronym of the research group (walking, art, landskip (/landscape), and knowledge) will be considered, as will theoretical views of walking and not-walking, writing on specific walking experiences, and writing on the links between walking and memorialisation, walking and artistic expression / creation, and walking and literature.\n\nConventional papers and panel proposals are accepted as well as creative-critical papers, and innovative panel proposals (pecha-kucha sessions, etc).\n\nThere will be a limited number of postgraduate bursaries available.\n\nPlease send all enquiries as well as 250-word proposals for 20-minute papers or 600-word proposals for 60-minute panel presentations, along with brief bio-notes for each participant, to WALK@sunderland[dot]ac[dot]uk by 15 March 2013.\n\nFurther information will be available in the upcoming months here: http:// onwalking.wordpress.com/cfp\n\nA walk with Amy Sharrocks via mobile phone\n\nEach walk will take approximately 30 minutes\n\nAt an agreed time Amy Sharrocks in London calls you on your mobile telephone number. Together you take each other on a 30-minute tour of your respective locations. You collaborate to choose which way to go, describing the places and people you encounter and the surroundings you find yourselves in. Guiding each other’s footsteps, the conversations are as open-ended as the walks are.\n\n‘A walk with Amy’ functions as an urban drift, in which each participant is simultaneously a spectator and traveling companion, tourist and tour operator. The intimacy of an unknown voice can lead to unexpected insights and connections, noticing details we might have overseen, as we share cities across a remote landscape. ‘A walk with Amy’ asks what is worthy of attention – without road names or landmarks, what will function as signposts and how will we make our choices?\n\nPREMIERE on the 4th of AUGUST\n\nFurther walks on the 5th of August\n\nMeeting point\n\nin front of the\n\nLinden Museum\n\nHegelplatz 1\n\n70174 Stuttgart\n\nA series of urban performances developed with different members of the Southwark community.\n\nFor this project FrenchMottershead chose to work with individuals who showed varying degrees of control or conscious resistance, amidst the urban and socio-economic environments of their lives. Following the participants on their normal walks, FM explored different ways in which they could intervene in to these every day acts and reframe them in to a performance which posed questions about where these people want to go and how they want to get there. These collaborations aim to transform everyday actions into conscious performances, which are personal, poetic, and political and will resonate with most people’s experience of urban life.\n\nReg’s Calling\n\nThursday 26th July 2012, 5pm\n\nAt the junction of East Street and Walworth Road, London SE17.\n\nReg, a retired engineer, one-time stand up comic and life-long customer of East Street Market, normally keeps in the loop by cracking jokes and swapping news with every vendor he knows. But today with a piece evoking the decline of the market, Reg takes a slow procession down the street following clean-up crew after a day’s trade, performing the gimmicks of the sellers that have long populated the marketplace.\n\nMelisha’s Pilgrimage\n\nSaturday 21st Aug 2012, 10.00 – 17.00\n\nDot’s Path\n\nSaturday 4th Aug 2012, 12.00 & 15.00\n\nThese walks will be filmed and screened at Tate Modern at the end of August 2012.\n\nWalkways Launch\n\n18.30 – 20.00 Friday 31 August 2012\n\nin the East Room, Tate Modern\n\nWalkways Screening\n\n10.00-18.00 from 22 – 28 August 2012\n\nin the Clore Screening Room, Level 0, Tate Modern\n\nA Tate Modern collaborative commission.\n\nEmail: info@frenchmottershead.com\n\nWeb: www.frenchmottershead.com\n\nT: +44 (0)20 8525 5340 / M: +44 (0)7951 537012\n\nA walking work by Ana Laura Lopez de la Torre\n\nCommissioned by the Art Exchange and\n\nESCALA (Essex Collection of Art from Latin America)\n\nEssex University\n\nTo coincide with the exhibition Margins: Walking Between Worlds, the Art Exchange has commissioned me to produce a new work for the University Colchester Campus.\n\nDuring December 2011 I will be collecting Instructions for a Walk from staff, students and regular visitors at the Campus.\n\nOn 3rd February 2012 I will Test Drive the walks recommended, and comment upon their merits for the benefit of all Campus walkers. Everybody is welcome to join me on the Test Drive walks, and a time table will be available closer to the date.\n\nAll recommended walks will be compiled into a guide, annotated and illustrated by myself. The guide will be available as a hard-copy from ESCALA and downloadable from the new ESCALA website.\n\nThis work is in line with my interest in creating shared resources and communal knowledge with groups of people, built from partial, individual and smaller knowledges on a given subject.\n\nIn response to the invitation by Art Exchange to propose a walking event for communities at Essex University, I was inspired by the many different forms of walking that are already present in Campus. From the purposeful and practical daily routes of postmen and cleaners, to the many different research projects and social activities organised by staff and students that involve walking in and around the Campus, there is already much walking going on. As an outsider, I felt it would be more pertinent to make good use of this existing expertise, and lent myself to testing the suitability of these modes of walking for the novice.\n\nGet involved (If you are familiar with the Colchester Campus)\n\nRecommend a walk\n\nGive your walk a title, a starting and ending place, and approximate duration.\n\nWalks can be of any duration, but shorter ones will be more suitable for Test Driving them. However, all walks, regardless of duration, will be considered.\n\nPlease submit your proposed walk, including any instructions for a person who is not familiar with the Campus, to be able to do the walk on their own.\n\nWalks can be of any nature: practical, conceptual, focused on a particular topic or even impossible to perform. If relevant, please specify instructions for the walk, such as suggested attire, form of documentation, particular things to notice or activities to carry out.\n\nPlease note that your submission of walking instructions will be compiled into a work that will be freely available to the public. I would like to credit the author of each walking instruction, but if you want to remain anonymous, that’s fine too.\n\nPlease send your proposed walk to arts@essex.ac.uk, or drop it in/send it to\n\nthe Arts on 5 Office, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester CO4 3SQ.\n\nHelp Test Drive the walks\n\nA timetable of the walks that I will be testing on Friday 3rd February will be available closer to the date from the ESCALA website and on posters around campus. Please feel free to join me on any of the Test Drive walks. Just come on time to the location specified in the schedule.\n\nOrganise your own Test Drive\n\nAfter the event, a guide of all walks will be available to download from the ESCALA website. You might want to Test Drive some or all the walks yourself, or organise group Test Drives with your friends, colleagues or those you always wanted to meet but never had a silly\n\nenough excuse."
