        "text": "Set in France during and after the first World War, this is the story of a young officer who is horribly maimed in battle and sent to the 'Officers Ward' to recuperate. While sketching his rehabilitation with subtlety and grace, Dupeyron focuses on the prejudice with which the outside world treats the disfigured."
