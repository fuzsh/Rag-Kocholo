        "text": "âItâs a shame youâre blackâ¦. you couldâve been my daughter,â quips an old (white) lady as home-help Sonia (FelicitÃ© Waoussi) tends to her with the kind of loving attention and patience most mothers could only dream of receiving. Sonia, a kind of Mother Courage struggling to bring up her 4 kids on a sink estate in the Paris suburbs, is the leading lady in the film Aide-toi, le ciel tâaidera (God helps those who help themselves).\n\nOne the day Soniaâs elder daughter gets married, one of her sons gets busted for drugs and her husband dies of a heart attack. Her younger daughter later announces sheâs seven months pregnant at the age of 17.\n\nMeanwhile everyday life goes on with trips to the hairdresser, launderette, the odd party and a bit of love interest from an ambulance driver.\n\nDirector FranÃ§ois Dupeyron says he wanted to show the everyday ups and downs of a family in Franceâs multi-racial, underprivileged suburbs, in the style of Italian comedies of the 1970s.\n\nâIt happens to be an African family, and itâs quite rare to see that in France,â he says. âBut above all itâs a familyâ¦ black, white, yellow, greenâ¦ they all have problems.â\n\nHe says that blacks are ânot represented in French cinemaâ, and there is little doubt this film shows more black faces on the big screen in one go than you would see in a year in France. In fact, Dupeyron admits heâs only filmed one black actress in his 20-year career.\n\nThe CSA or French television watchdog, recently said the lack of non-white faces on French television was deplorable. Cinema isnât much better.\n\nWhile Mata Gabin (who plays a man-eating hairdresser and Soniaâs confidante) had already acted in one of Dupeyronâs earlier films Monsieur Ibrahim, the majority of the actors were new to cinema, and some were complete beginners. FelicitÃ© Wouassi came from theatre. âI saw her in a play directed by Roman Polanski,â says Dupeyron. âIt was a small role but her charisma shone out. She was a real âMother Courageâ.â\n\nWouassi received the best actress award at this yearâs Tokyo film festival.\n\nAide-toi, le ciel tâaidera isnât afraid to confront clichÃ©s about immigrants in rough suburbs, such as teenage pregnancy and drug dealing.\n\nStereotypical? Dupeyron admits some members of the black community were worried about the film, denying that black tramps (like the one hiding out in the launderette spin dryer) or elderly black violent fathers (like Soniaâs husband) exist in real life. But the director defends his subjects and the way he treated them.\n\nâItâs a reality and you have to show things how they are, but be fair, not fall into caricature,â he says, adding itâs a mistake to show any community in a perfect light.\n\nThe lead-up to the filmâs release coincided with the United States presidential elections, and the poster featured the slogan âObama, le ciel tâaideraâ (Obama, God will help you).\n\nSo were they riding on the âObama waveâ? Dupeyron says just as Obama was elected despite being black, not because of it, âwe have to get to the point where FelicitÃ© gets acting roles not because sheâs black but because of her talent,â he says. âAnd weâre a long way off,â he adds ruefully."
