        "text": "Kind of a mixed bag. It had good acting and cinematography, but there were things that just didn't work. Like the juxtaposition of these images and punk music, the effect they're going for is obvious, but it didn't get to me. Also the story didn't go in the right direction, in my opinion.\n\nPretty good, I liked the story, and in a way it's a film about depression, mysticism, religion, addiction, infidelity, friendship, etc. It dragged on though, and could lose 25 minutes or so and be better for it.\n\nMotorcycles are great in films because you can just cut to them at almost any point.\n\nThis film played at the Palm Springs film festival under the strangely inappropriate title One of a Kind. It's the story of Frédi, a troubled 30-something Frenchman who apparently has inherited from his mother the ability to heal by laying on of hands. But the film becomes an exercise in \"healer, heal thyself,\" as Frédi stumbles through strained relationships and personal disasters mostly by riding to and fro on his motorcycle. The film is shot in a super-artistic style, lots of sun-splashed back-lit scenes, long tracking shots that go nowhere with a raucous English language punk song on the soundtrack. Yes, somewhat pretentious; but also after a while, it just becomes difficult to deal with the unremitting depressives portrayed by the film."
