        "text": "MADRID — Kinology, Gregoire Melin’s new Paris-based sales company, has picked up international rights outside France to Francois Dupeyron’s feel-good drama “Aide-toi, le ciel t’aidera” (With a Little Help From Myself).\n\nDupeyron’s follow-up to “Inguelezi,” “Monsieur Ibrahim” and “Officer’s Ward,” “Help” turns on Sonia, a struggling black mother whose world falls in on the day of her daughter’s wedding. She turns for help to her eightysomething neighbor, who subsequently asks her for aid.\n\nWritten as well as directed by Dupeyron, and toplining Claude Rich, Mata Gabin and Felicite Wouassi, “Help” is the first pick-up on a completed film for Kinology, which launched strongly at Cannes.\n\n“We fell under the movie’s spell. Ultimately, it’s an uplifting, feel-good movie with a strong universal message about hope and love. This is a very human story in the vein of ‘Baghdad Cafe,’” said Kinology managing director Melin.\n\n“Help” is produced by Michele and Laurent Petin at France’s ARP Selection, which also produced Dupeyron’s “Officer’s Ward” and “Ibrahim,” as well as Laetitia Masson’s “The Repentant” and the Dardenne brothers’ “Rosetta.”\n\n“Help” will be released in France Nov. 26. It is tipped for major late-summer festival bearths before that."
