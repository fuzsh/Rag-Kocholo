        "meta_description": "This deftly made French psychological thriller terrifies with its exploration of an experiment gone horribly wrong. Dr. Marc Lacroix, a psychiatrist specializing in brain functions, is obsessed with the link between mind and spirit. To find his link he studies the criminally insane. He builds a secret machine, known only to his mistress Marianne, in which he hopes to exchange minds between humans. He simultaneously wants to help the mentally ill recover, and he wants to experience their madness. He chooses the psychotic killer, Zyto, a man who stabbed at least three women, for his experiment. The initial experiment is successful and the two exchange minds. But trouble ensues when Zyto refuses to reverse the switch. There is little Marc can do when Zyto takes over Marc's life, and more ominously his wife and child whom are unknowingly in mortal danger. Marc, encased in Zyto's body, is returned to the asylum. Will Marc's wife recognize the danger? Will Zyto kill again?",

        "text": "The clinical French thriller La Machine is like a bombastic Hollywood film in structure, but without the Hollywood ending. And what I mean by that, it's a downer. A brutal downer. Pushing the boundaries of science and losing yourself in your work can have unexpected and dire consequences in what is a cautionary tale of the damaging domino affect on not just yourself, but also those around you.\n\nBrain specialist/psychiatrist Marc Lacrox has developed a groundbreaking machine that can transfer parts of the human brain between two people. He's looking to test it out on someone, and that's where he becomes infatuated by one of his patients (a deranged serial killer of the criminally insane). Wanting to cure, and understand…\n\nThis French thriller is a variant on the bodyswap theme used in a number of fantasy films – see the likes of Freaky Friday, All Of Me, Like Father, Like Son, and Vice Versa. However, it uses the theme to horror ends – something that had only been done before in The Mephisto Waltz, although we had seen treatments in films of the mad scientist era such as The Man Who Changed His Mind and Black Friday – and gives it a thin science-fictional rationale of the titular \"machine\".\n\nUnfortunately, the very familiarity of the theme tends to work against the film – much of the business of the killer slotting into Gerard Depardieu’s life seems overly familiar. Annoying too…"
