First you LOAD the web page in Safari. If the page contains an image that’s fairly large, this can take a while on a modem connection. Then you control-click on the image and you get the following three […]\n\nThis day has lived up to the billing, if not in sheer football value, at least in excitement and drama. Southampton did a really good job of containing Manchester United, who only had a couple of chances in 90 minutes, and were rewarded for it with a last-gasp winner by — who else? — James […]\n\nChelsea weren’t impressive, and it’s not looking good for Newcastle United… Chelsea were really fortunate to be awarded a penalty kick for an alleged handball against Blackburn. There was little flow to their game, and almost every pass by Veron made me cringe. How on earth this player is valued so highly is beyond me. […]\n\nAfter a few fairly quiet days, it looks like we are getting a new wave of nastiness. I’ve received at least 20 infected emails in the past couple of hours — of course, each of them weighs approximately 100 KB and, even though they are harmless in Mac OS X, it’s a pain. Grrr.\n\nSpeaking of blue halos… Does anyone have any idea what the blue halo in the following picture (taken from Mac OS X’s Installer application) means? We already have the blue tint used for default buttons in Aqua windows: This blue tint is used to indicate that this is the default button and that it can […]\n\nIf you have more than one email account and you are using Mac OS X’s Mail application, you can probably reproduce the following. Compose a new message. This opens a new window, with the “To:” field highlighted using the “blue halo” effect. Now go to the “Account:” pop-up menu to SELECT a different account to […]\n\nIf, like me, you have been using Mac OS X’s Mail application for a while and have a fairly large archive of old email, you might want to take a look at this tip provided courtesy of MacOSXHints.com. Quit Mail. Do a complete backup of your “Mail” folder (inside your home library, unless you’ve located […]\n\nWe had to endure Manchester United yet again here in Canada… They were far from impressive against Wolverhampton, who should at least have earned a point. Former Sedan striker Henri Camara had half a dozen chances and wasn’t able to convert any of them. Amazingly enough, Ruud van Nistelrooy didn’t get a single chance, let […]\n\nSalon has a look at the virus/worm vulnerabilities of Windows in an article titled “Dumb software for dumb people“. I don’t think using such a title will help much. It effectively echoes Microsoft’s own approach, which is to constantly blame the end user for software issues. But at least the article itself offers a more […]\n\nThe autocompleting feature of web browsers such as Safari or Explorer are a good idea in theory. Type the first few letters of a URL, and the browser scans its long history of existing URLs that you’ve used and lists a number of possible matches. Then you use the up and down cursor keys to […]\n\nThat was fun… Manchester City beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 on their home turf, with an amazing 40-yard free kick by Michael Tarnat, a great goal by Joey Barton, and a hilarious last-gap winner by Anelka, who shot from a seemingly impossible angle through the legs of the man who was easily the best keeper in […]"
