        "text": "There is no mistaking the attraction Canadians have for the greater Palm Springs area.\n\nSo in turn, the Palm Springs International Film Festival is returning that admiration by spotlighting Canadian Cinema in its 2014 edition.\n\n“We've selected Canadian films for a special focus at this year's festival for many reasons, not the least of which is the wealth of talent emerging from its relatively small, indigenous film industry, and the depth and richness of story and character portrayal its films exemplify,” says Festival Director Darryl Macdonald. “Whether it's established auteurs like Denis Coté, Denis Villenueve and Atom Egoyan, gifted actor/directors like Don McKellar and Sarah Polley or newly emerging talents like Chloé Robichaud, Craig Goodwill and Sébastien Pilote, Canadian creative ingenuity is on abundant display in its films.”\n\nIn addition, films selected to compete for the FIPRESCI Award in the Awards Buzz section, and Modern Masters. The Festival will screen 45 of the 76 official submissions to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Best Foreign Language Film. Additional film programs will be announced in the upcoming weeks.\n\n“In years past there have usually been five to seven films that were considered obvious choices from countries whose films often make the shortlist,” says Artistic Director Helen du Toit. “But this year there are more obvious choices than usual as well as very exciting group of \"dark horses\" emerging from countries whose entries rarely make the shortlist.”\n\nAwards Buzz\n\nThe Awards Buzz section is selected by Festival programmers as the strongest entries in this year’s Academy Awards® race.

Cast: Mahendra Saini, Suman Saini, Ranjit Gahlot, Meena Gahlot, Roshni.\n\nStay (Canada) – An appealing romantic drama, about a young woman ¬– living in Ireland with an ex-professor – whose unplanned pregnancy causes her to question her future. Director: Wiebke von Carolsfeld.

Under the supervision of Guillaume, a young, sympathetic parole officer, she tries to get her life back on track along with Florence, her former cellmate with whom she shared years of intimacy in prison.

Cast: Pierrette Robitaille, Romane Bohringer, Marc-André Grondin.\n\nModern Masters\n\nThe Modern Masters section features 10 films from international directors who set the standards for contemporary cinema including from the Canadian Cinema program Denis Villeneuve’s Enemy along with films from directors Vinko Bresan, François Dupeyron, Agnieszka Holland, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Claude Lanzmann, Hayao Miyazaki, Errol Morris, Avi Nesher, and François Ozon.\n\nBurning Bush (Czech Republic) – An epic docudrama examining the emotional, political and societal fallout from Czech student Jan Palach’s 1969 self-immolation. Director: Agnieszka Holland. Cast: Tatiana Pauhofovå, Jaroslava Pokomå, Petr Stach, Jan Budar, Martin Huba, Ivan Trojan.\n\nThe Last of the Unjust (France) – Claude Lanzmann, whose epic, landmark film Shoah is certainly the definitive film about the Holocaust – returns to one of the interview subjects from that film to unravel the tale of the ‘model’ concentration camp, Theresienstadt, and the ambiguous leader of its Jewish Council, Benjamin Murmelstein, a former rabbi who spent the war years negotiating on a day-to-day basis with Adolf Eichmann. Director: Claude Lanzmann. Cast: Benjamin Murmelstein and Claude Lanzmann.\n\nLike Father, Like Son (Japan) – Two couples are devastated to learn that their children were swapped at birth six years ago.

A deeply satisfying chronicle of personal redemption. Director: François Dupeyron. Cast: Grégory Gadebois, Céline Sallette, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Marie Payen, Philippe Rebbot.\n\nThe Priest’s Children (Croatia) – In this acerbic satire, a naïve Catholic clergyman tries to boost the birth rate among his Dalmatian island flock, but his plan sparks a host of unintended consequences. Director: Vinko Bresan. Cast: Kresimir Mikic, Niksa Butijer, Marija Skaricic, Drazen Kuhn, Jadranka Dokic, Lazar Ristovski.\n\nThe Unknown Known (USA) – In his new documentary, Errol Morris takes on the enigma that is Donald Rumsfeld.

Cast: Donald Rumfeld and Errol Morris.\n\nThe Wind Rises (Japan) – Anime sensei Hayao Miyazaki has always been fascinated by flight. In what he says will be his swansong, he has conjured an extraordinarily lyrical biopic of sorts, inspired by the experiences of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed the famous Japanese Zero fighter plane. Director: Hayao Miyazaki. Cast: Hideaki Anno, Miori Takimoto, Hidetoshi Nishijima, Masahiko Nishimura, Jun Kunimura, Mirai Shida.\n\nThe Wonders (Israel) – A genial slacker, a private investigator and a femme fatale join forces to rescue a kidnapped holy man in this unusual dramedy.
