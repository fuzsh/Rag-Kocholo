        "text": "Reading time: 16 minutes\n\nAugust means summer! And summer means hot days that will make you want to sip a lemonade (une lemonade) with your loved ones, while laying back in comfort in front of your TV.\n\nOnce again, as part of my monthly ritual, I will give you another list of movies to watch for the month of August. Most are inspirational films created to convey deep and meaningful perceptions about life, war or happiness.\n\nI hope you will like the films in my list for the second month of summer.\n\nBefore we proceed to the list, here's a quick question. Would you like to have a FREE copy of the e-book 365 Days of French Movies?\n\nDay 1: Sauve qui peut (la vie) (Every Man for Himself)\n\nYear: 1980\n\nDirected by: Jean-Luc Godard\n\nWritten by: Jean-Claude Carrière; Jean-Luc Godard; Anne-Marie Miéville\n\nSource: filmstudiesforfree\n\nAnother movie list beginning with a Godard movie, Every Man for Himself stars Jacques Dutronc (as Paul Godard), Isabelle Huppert (Isabelle Riviera) and Nathalie Baye (Denise Rimbaurd). It is a powerful, dark and surreal film examining different sexual relationships through the interactions of the three protagonists.\n\nBut the film is not without a comedic touch: balancing the combination of early experimental cinematic forms, such as its various slow motion scenes, with its pessimistic ideology about life, perversity, love and work.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 2: Aliyah\n\nYear: 2012\n\nDirected by: Elie Wajeman\n\nWritten by: Gaëlle Macé, Elie Wajeman\n\nSource: unifrance\n\nWith a drug addict brother and a dream to pursue, Alex, a 27-year-old Jewish drug dealer living in the working-class Paris neighbourhood is working hard to pursue his Aliyah: a Jewish term for immigrating to Israel. In order to achieve his dream however, he must leave his home, his former love, his best friend Mathias, Jeanne, the woman he’s having a relationship with, and his stubborn brother.\n\nHe is being torn between his Aliyah, his drug business, complicated love life and his love for his brother. This movie received praise from many critics due to its representation of different social classes in Paris and its focus on the culture of the Jewish community in France.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 3: Mélo\n\nYear: 1986\n\nDirected by: Alain Resnais\n\nWritten by: Alain Resnais, Henri Bernstein\n\nSource: kebekmac\n\nThe plot of Melo is simple and quite predictable: two best friends fighting over the love of a woman. The difference in comparison to most such dramas is its beautifully crafted story of a woman dealing with a complex ménage à trois without hurting either man.\n\nYou will find a story of undying love, faith, friendship, adultery and lies; skilfully blended with Resnais’ directorial magic in this wonderful movie. Watch how Romaine, Marcel and Pierre fight for their love, sacrifice life and happiness, and treasure friendship and dignity till the end.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 4: Le Cinquième Élément (The Fifth Element)\n\nYear: 1997\n\nDirected by: Luc Besson\n\nWritten by: Luc Besson , Robert Mark Kamen\n\nSource: grazia\n\nSet during the twenty-third century, The Fifth Element is an English-language French science fiction film starring Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, and Milla Jovovich. The film’s plot revolves around an alien invasion, a cynical reluctant hero, and a beautiful and enigmatic woman with mysterious powers.\n\nAt the time of its release, The Fifth Element was the most expensive European film ever, and the most successful French film until the release of The Intouchables. So, if you are asking yourself what is the fifth element? Find out by watching and enjoy the performance of the blue diva, the search for the mystical stones, and the impending battle between humans and aliens from the dark and mysterious outer space.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 5: Vénus noire (Black Venus)\n\nYear: 2010\n\nDirected by: Abdellatif Kechiche\n\nWritten by: Abdel Kechiche, Ghalya Laroix\n\nSource: bengale\n\nVenus noire is a special and one-of-a-kind true story movie about Sarah Baartman (Yahima Torres), a Khoikhoi woman who was exhibited in Europe under the name “Hottentot Venus” in the early 19th century. Venus noire (Black Venus) shows a life of a young woman from the ’dark continent’ of Africa brought to Europe.\n\nShe is treated as a sideshow attraction and viewed as part human and part animal by most people. The term ’Hottentot Venus‘ was devised by Hendrick Caezar (Andre Jacobs) as Sarah’s stage name. The most unusual thing about Sarah’s story is her conscious acceptance of becoming an exhibit, and her willingness to be staged in such a seemingly derogatory way.\n\nVenus Noire explores important questions about life, immigration, racism and exploitation.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 6: Kirikou et la Sorciere\n\nYear: 1998\n\nDirected and written by: Michel Ocelot\n\nSource: toutlecine\n\nNow, let’s turn to a happier story that also concerns Africa. Kirikou et la Sorciere is a cartoon drawn from the different elements of West African folk tales. The story takes place in a little village somewhere in West Africa, which is plagued by the wrath of an evil sorceress. The witch dries up their spring and takes all the males of the village except for one---the uncle of a brave little boy called Kirikou.\n\nUnfortunately, his uncle must pay a visit to the evil sorceress, and this will be the beginning of Kirikou’s use of wit and cunning to save his people from the hands of the sorceress\n\nThe film garnered controversy in the US as it showed scenes of female and male nudity, which was still the norm in in pre-colonial Africa, but not clearly not in the U.S during its release. Nevertheless, the movie was successful and was followed by two sequels, and a stage musical.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 7: Couleur de peau: miel (Approved for Adoption)\n\nYear: 2012\n\nDirected by: Laurent Boileau\n\nWritten by: Jung\n\nSource: koreanfilmfestivalinaustralia\n\nThe second animated film will bring you back to your childhood dreams and imagination. The artist Jung Henin has adapted his popular graphic novels about his life as an adopted child. He was one of the thousands of children adopted by Western families by the end of the Korean War.\n\nThe story revolves around the life and struggles of an adopted child, his period of identity crisis at being stranded in between two very different types of culture, and his success in finding himself. The film is a combination of witty humour and inspiring snippets which will capture those soft spots of yours.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 8: Astérix et Obélix : Mission Cléopâtre (Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra)\n\nYear: 2002\n\nDirected by: René Goscinny, Lee Payant, Albert Uderzo\n\nWritten by: Eddie Lateste, Jos Marissen, Pierre Tchernia\n\nSource: cineclap\n\nAsterix and Obelix:Mission Cleopatra is a movie based on a French comic book written by Rene Goscinny.

How will these unlikely warriors help Numerobis to finish the pyramid project in time? For an amusing evening, watch Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 9: Au Galop (In Rush)\n\nYear: 2012\n\nDirected and written by: Louis-Do de Lencquesaing\n\nSource: delhi\n\nPaul (Louis - Do de Lencquesaing) who is contemplating suicide, meets Ada, a beautiful mother of one, who is about to get married with a businessman. Paul is an accomplished author with a daughter, but still lives with his domineering mother. When he meets Ada (Valentia Cervi), his world is changed forever.\n\nHe admires her beauty, while she adores his wit and intelligence. The two begin their forbidden love, and face the consequences attached to it. The movie dramatically depicts the torment of a suicidal novelist, his gorgeous mistress, a dying patriarch, love, children and an insight into l Parisian archetypes\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 10: One Night (38 témoins)\n\nYear: 2012\n\nDirected by: Lucas Belvaux\n\nWritten by: Yvan Attal, Patrick Quinet, Patrick Sobelman\n\nSource: alliancefrancaise\n\nWhat will you do if, after returning from a business trip, you discover a murder committed in your hometown, but no one is interested in solving the case? Will you keep out of the trouble, or you will be like Louise Morvand and give your all to ensure that the local police will investigate the case?\n\n38 témoins means 38 witnesses in French, but is ironic in that, in the film, only one of the thirty eight people living in the area is willing to speak of the event, deciding to break his silence and provide some truths that the town doesn’t want to hear.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 11: Parlez-moi de vous (On Air)\n\nYear: 2012\n\nDirected and written by: Pierre Pinaud\n\nSource: futureshop\n\nMolina is a famous agony aunt in France.

One day, however, she decides to search for her mother whom she never knew.\n\nIn her search, she discovers more about her past and regains her heart. “Parlez moi de vous” is a light comedy drama which makes perfect watching after a day of work.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 12: Un conte de Noël (A Christmas Tale)\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirected by: Arnaud Desplechin\n\nWritten by: Arnaud Desplechin, Emmanuel Bourdieu\n\nSource: fan-de-cinema\n\nJust before Christmas, the Vuillard family is forced to reunite to deal with negative news about their mother’s need for a transplant.

This film has a particular focus on colonialism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some have called it poetic, some journalistic, but the unique thing about this film is its philosophical analysis of the war and its representation from the lens.\n\nNotable for its adaptation of Dante’s tripartite style, it is divided into three segments: “Hell”, “Purgatory”, and “Heaven”. He examines how he can broaden understanding of social-political issues from the context of filmmaking. Godard stars as himself in this mixture of documentary, fiction and montage. This is ideal for those looking for a deep and provocative movie.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 14: Hors Satan (Outside Satan)\n\nYear: 2011\n\nDirected and written by: Bruno Dumont\n\nSource: imdb\n\nThis next movie is as deep and dark as Notre Musique, but more abstract in terms of its focus and ideals. Dumont attempts to explore the issues of good and evil and their symbiosis-as well as the transformation of one from the other.\n\nThe movie is about a drifter’s relationship with young woman who suffered abuse. Though it could be extremely slow in pace, it serves to highlight the striking use of the French countryside, and the underlying themes.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 15: L'Heure d'été (Summer Hours)\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirected and written by: Olivier Assayas\n\nSource: wikipedia\n\nL’ Heure d’ete (Summer Hours) will make you think about the profound struggles between culture and modernity, tradition and change.

For the three siblings in the movie, this donation is equivalent to the disappearance of their childhood memories- as they must abandon the house and all the art inside to they return to their thoroughly modern lives.\n\nThe movie received great praise because of its detail-oriented approach and its portrayal of how objects of value lose their context when taken from their original setting, yet regain it, when placed in one in which they become part of a greater heritage.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nSpeak, Listen, and Write French like a Native with Talk in French Complete Courses\n\nLearn French on your own terms with our comprehensive, self-paced beginner, intermediate, and advanced courses, each with a step-by-step plan tailored to your level.\n\nMaster French pronunciation and sound like a native with our pronunciation course.\n\nReceive personalized feedback and guidance from a dedicated French teacher.\n\nDay 16: Va Savoir (Who Knows?)\n\nYear: 2001\n\nDirected by: Jacques Rivette\n\nWritten by: Pascal Bonitzer, Christine Laurent, Jacques Rivette\n\nSource: way2enjoy\n\nCamille is the lead actress of an Italian theatre company touring Europe.

After the incident he feels guilty for his gruff manners, so he tries to apologize in return-leading to an increasingly complicated series of events. The difficulties of human emotions, and how they impact on others are subtly examined in this perceptive film.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 20: L'Anglaise et le Duc (The Lady and the Duke)\n\nYear: 2001\n\nDirected and written by: Éric Rohmer\n\nSource: film-cine\n\nOur next film is inspired by the memoirs of Grace Elliot, a Scottish aristocrat and royal who lived and fought during the French Revolution. L’Anglaise et le Duc (The Lady and the Duke) aroused strong condemnation from many French citizens due to its perceived monarchist sympathies.\n\nEric Rohmer created the film at the age of 81 and he proves that age does not matter, nor does age necessarily make a person rusty and ineffective. The active negative response of so many certainly proved that! Moreover, Rohmer brings the 18th century Paris to the modern period through adapting the style of paintings during the era. The actors look like a part of a pop-up book, and the effect is strange and animated.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 21: Le Fils (The Son)\n\nYear: 2002\n\nDirected and written by: Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne\n\nSource: worldscinema\n\nOlivier, a woodwork teacher at a vocational school becomes obsessed with Francis, the man who killed his son.

A period when many men sacrificed their chance of a happy life with their loved ones for the sake of fighting for their country. Adrien is one of these soldiers- left injured after a mortar shell explodes in his face.\n\nDupeyron adds ambiguity to La Chambre des Officiers by creatively conveying the extent of Adrien’s injury, and the war as a whole, through minimalism and lighting. La Chambre des Officiers presents the inherent paradox of a period when machines and science aided the war greatly, but still lacked the ability to revive the ripped and shredded bodies of the dead and injured soldiers.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 23: Eloge de l'amour (In Praise of Love)\n\nYear: 2001\n\nDirected and written by: Jean-Luc Godard\n\nSource: hoodedutilitarian\n\nEdgar (Bruno Putzulu) is looking for the right leading lady for his next film without much success when he encounters Elle (Cecile Camp). Elle fascinates him and he is somewhat certain that he already met her somewhere before, but cannot tell exactly when, where and how.\n\nJust as everything seems perfect to start the filming, Edgar receives the news that Elle dies. Lacking a conventional narrative of linear chronology, In Praise of Love is Godard’s contemplation of how we perceive the past, and the effects of culture and subjectivity on memory and history. Be warned, this film is not for American patriots--as you might find some aspects of the film offensive.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 24: Etre et avoir (To Be and To Have)\n\nYear: 2002\n\nDirected and written by: Nicolas Philibert\n\nSource: allocine\n\nHow can a person utterly devote their lives towards a vocation that helps others?
