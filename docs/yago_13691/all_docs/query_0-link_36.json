The sister about whom I was told nothing, or nearly nothing, and of whom my parents had oddly never kept a single photograph. It was to make up for the missing images that I decided to make this film. Thinking that I would simply chronicle a forgotten life, in fact I opened up the hidden door to a past that I was unaware of, to the subconscious memory that lies inside each of us and who makes us what we are.\n\nCredits\n\nDirector\n\nEric Caravaca\n\nScreenwriter\n\nEric Caravaca\n\nProducer\n\nLaetitia Gonzalez\n\nProduction Company\n\nLes Films du Poisson\n\nProduction Company\n\nLes Films du Poisson\n\nAbout the Director\n\nEric Caravaca was trained at the School of Performing Arts in Rouen and at the Actor’s Studio. He appeared in plays directed by Phillipe Adrien in the 1990s before being noticed onstage. His first major role in a feature-length film was in Diane Bertrand’s ‘Un samedi sur la terre’ (1996), a singular work about fate. Caravaca went on to work with several great directors like François Dupeyron (‘The Officers’ Ward’, 2001), Patrice Chéreau (‘His Brother’ 2003) and Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud (‘Chicken with Plums’, 2011). He directed his first feature-length film, ‘The Passenger’ in 2004; it was selected for the Critics’ Week a the Festival de Cannes and the Venice Film Festival.
