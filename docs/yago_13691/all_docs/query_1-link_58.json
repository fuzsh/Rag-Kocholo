        "text": "Dec. 5\n\nFIVE SIDES OF A COIN A documentary about the power and culture of hip-hop, with Run DMC, Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash, De La Soul and at least three dozen other artists. Paul Kell directed.\n\nFORGET BAGHDAD A documentary about Jewish and Arab stereotypes, especially as seen in 100 years of film. Examples include Hollywood features, Israeli boureka comedies and Egyptian musical comedies. The film also focuses on the experience of Sephardic Jews, who may feel like foreigners in their own country. Directed by the Iraqi-born video artist Samir, whose family moved to Switzerland when he was a child.\n\nFROM HERE TO ETERNITY The love scene on the beach (Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster clinched and drenched) is well known. Frank Sinatra's performance, as the scrappy Private Maggio, revived his stalled career and won him the Oscar for best supporting actor (one of eight Oscars the film received, including best picture). Montgomery Clift is Private Prewitt, the reluctant boxer, and Donna Reed is the ladylike hooker he falls for. The film, based on James Jones's novel about a military base in Hawaii just before Pearl Harbor, is exactly 50 years old. Fred Zinnemann, who did \"High Noon\" and went on to do \"A Man for All Seasons,\" directed.\n\nHONEY Jessica Alba (who made her name in the futuristic Fox series \"Dark Angel\" ) stars as an inner-city dancer who makes it big as a choreographer of music videos. Then she encounters sexual harassment. The cast also includes Lil' Romeo and Mekhi Phifer. Directed by Bille Woodruff.\n\nTHE LAST SAMURAI It's been a long time since Tom Cruise appeared on screen in period costume (and that was as a vampire). In this 19th-century epic, he's Nathan Algren, an alcoholic Civil War veteran who's been called to Japan to teach its army all about modern warfare. Which will mean the end of the samurai, and Algren becomes unsure that that's a good thing. Edward Zwick (whose film credits include \"Glory\" ) directed, and he wrote the screenplay with his former \"thirtysomething\" partner, Marshall Herskovitz, and John Logan. Tony Goldwyn, Billy Connolly and Ken Watanabe are Mr. Cruise's co-stars.\n\nMONSIEUR IBRAHIM Omar Sharif plays a Muslim grocer who becomes good friends with an emotionally needy Jewish boy (Pierre Boulanger) in 1960's Paris. Mr. Sharif shared the best-actor audience award (with Benicio Del Toro for \"21 Grams\" ) for this role at the Venice International Film Festival. FrancÌ§ois Dupeyron directed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
