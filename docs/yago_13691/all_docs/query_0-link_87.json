        "text": "On Christmas Eve, 1914, soldiers from both sides on the Western Front spontaneously laid down their arms, momentarily inciting music, carousing, and soccer instead of killing. This temporary truce is the inspiration for director Christian Carions sophomore film.\n\nIn a recent Q and A, Carion recounted an anecdote he had discovered in his research that he thought would be too incredulous to include in his film. A wandering cat, shared between two factions, was tried and executed for treason by the French after the Germans sent back the cat with a note tucked in its collar. But this handsomely-produced film is hardly more believable. Beautiful soprano Anna Sörensen (Diane Krüger) visits the German troops that evening and spends the night with her boyfriend, a tenor. A French officer runs off disguised as a German soldier in order to visit his mother in the occupied territory. The trenches are like an open-air Grand Hotel; people come, people go. The snow looks like asbestos, and the trenches are far from muddy with not a single rat in sight.\n\nTwo things give away Joyeux Noëls Francophile point of view. All but two are observant Catholics, even those from predominantly Protestant Scotland, Germany and Denmark. And while the films overtones of universal brotherhood would strongly appeal to those who flocked to The Passion of the Christ or End of the Spear, a gratuitous love scene between the war-torn singers instantly throws a roadblock to that potential core audience. Make love and not war is fine for France, but tell that to the American ratings board."
