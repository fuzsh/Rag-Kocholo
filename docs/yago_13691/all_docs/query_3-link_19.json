        "text": "After studying filmmaking at the Sorbonne, François worked for about 10 years as an assistant director on feature films, commercials and videos for world-renowned directors including Robert Altman, François Dupeyron, Christian Fechner, Claude Zidi, Dominique Issermann and Jean-Baptiste Mondino…\n\nDuring this time, he wrote, produced and directed several short films including “La Plage”, which was selected for several prestigious international film festivals (New York, Berlin, Paris, Uppsala, Cork…) and broadcast on Canal + in France and Belgium.\n\nFrançois has recently shot “making of” films for luxury houses and brands including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Darphin, Philippe Starck, as well as for the Aéroport de Paris and selected websites of glossy magazines, among them Vanity Fair France, Madame Figaro and American GQ.\n\nHe also directs documentaries, notably on young creative talents. Recurring projects include short films on the winners of the HSBC and BMW prizes for photography, which have been shown publicly as a part of the Rencontres d’Arles and Paris Photo.\n\nFor the past decade, François has covered Paris Fashion Week for some of the world’s most glamorous publications. He collaborates regularly with Vanity Fair France, Vogue.com (US) and Women’s Wear Daily (WWD), among others.\n\nIn 2016, he published his first book: “A NIGHT ON THE TOWN IN PARIS” is a collection of mostly never-before published photographs taken during fashion week parties and events. After an exclusive launch and signing at Colette, the book was distributed through some of the world’s most prestigious bookstores, among them Colette, Galignani, La Fondation Louis Vuitton, Les Arts Décoratifs museum, Artcurial auction house, the Palais de Tokyo, the Ritz Paris and 10 Corso Como (Milan), McNally Jackson (New York) and the Château Marmont (Los Angeles).\n\n​\n\nA second volume, \"LAST NIGHT ON THE TOWN IN PARIS,\" was published in September 2021. This new compilation of 182 photos taken during Paris Fashion Week and other events — for the media (Vanity Fair, WWD, Vogue) as well as for the brands themselves (Chanel, Fendi, LVMH, Kering) —"
