        "text": "The Toronto International Film Festival starts in only three weeks and today we've got a list of another 20 films that are premiering at the festival in the \"Special Presentation\" category. Back in June we announced the first batch of titles from some of the more obscure categories, but today we've got a line-up that should make any cinephile excited. From Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno to Stephen Soderbergh's Che double feature to Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler to Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York - they're all playing at this year's TIFF. I will of course be up in Toronto this year at the festival and although I didn't have the best experience last year, I'm excited to be traveling up there again.\n\nThe full line-up for the fest and more info can be found at the official website: tiff08.ca. This list only includes the 20 films from the \"Special Presentation\" category. The director is listed next to each film.\n\nThe Brothers Bloom - Rian Johnson, USA\n\nThe brothers Bloom (Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo) are the best con men in the world, swindling millionaires with complex scenarios of lust and intrigue.

The Brothers Bloom also features Rinko Kikuchi, Maximilian Schell and Robbie Coltrane.\n\nThe Wrestler - Darren Aronofsky, USA\n\nBack in the late '80s, Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a headlining professional wrestler. Now, twenty years later, he ekes out a living performing for handfuls of die-hard wrestling fans in high-school gyms and community centres. Randy lives for the thrill of the show and the adoration of his fans; but when he suffers a heart attack after a match, he is forced into retirement. He begins to evaluate the state of his life but the allure of the spotlight and the passion for his sport threatens to pull him back inside the ring. Directed by Darren Aronofsky (The Fountain, TIFF 2006), The Wrestler also stars Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei, Judah Friedlander and the Necro Butcher.\n\nMe and Orson Welles - Richard Linklater, United Kingdom\n\nZac Efron, Claire Danes, Ben Chaplin and Christian McKay star in this entertaining ode to Orson Welles from the director of The School of Rock (TIFF 2003) and Before Sunrise.

He gets his big break when he happens upon Orson Welles (McKay) and his fledgling Mercury Theatre company. Richard impresses Welles with an impromptu audition and lands a bit part in the Mercury's forthcoming run of Julius Caesar.

And how does he know all the answers?\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno - Kevin Smith, USA\n\nSeth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks star in this bawdy tale of love and friendship from Kevin Smith.

When the electricity and plumbing get cut off, the two seize upon the idea of making a homegrown porno movie for some quick cash, enlisting the help of their friends. The two vow that having sex will not ruin their friendship; but as everyone starts \"doing\" everyone, what started out as a friendly business proposition turns into something much more.\n\nChe: Part One - Stephen Soderbergh, USA/Spain\n\nOn November 26, 1956, Fidel Castro sails to Cuba with eighty rebels. One of those rebels is Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, an Argentine doctor who shares a common goal with Fidel Castro - to overthrow the corrupt dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.

Then he disappears, re-emerging incognito in Bolivia, where he organizes a small group of Cuban comrades and Bolivian recruits to start the great Latin American Revolution.

He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their constructed lives in a growing mockup of the city outside. The years rapidly fold into each other, and Caden buries himself deeper into his masterpiece but the textured tangle of real and theatrical relationships blurs the line between the world of the play and that of Caden's own deteriorating reality. Synecdoche also stars Jennifer Jason Leigh, Catherine Keener, Dianne Wiest, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Emily Watson and Hope Davis.\n\nGenova - Michael Winterbottom, UK\n\nSeeking a new life after the sudden death of his wife, Joe (Colin Firth) moves his family to the Italian town of Genova, hoping for a fresh start for himself and his two daughters.

And while paying the toll for refusing to compromise his dignity, this everyday David tried the unthinkable: to bring Goliath to his knees. Flash of Genius also stars Lauren Graham, Dermot Mulroney and Alan Alda.\n\nFaubourg 36 - Christophe Barratier, France\n\nA dazzling musical from the director of Les Choristes (TIFF 2004), Faubourg 36 is set between December 1935 and July 1936 in a working-class neighbourhood on the northeastern edge of Paris. The springtime election of a left-wing government brings wild new hopes, yet also sees the rise of extremist ideas. Three unemployed stage workers decide to produce a \"hit show\" and occupy the music hall where they formally worked. The stage is set for a short-lived but wonderful adventure.\n\nThis is definitely an exciting line-up with so many great movies I've been anxious to check out. I really can't wait for TIFF this year - it's another great opportunity to see so many of the best indie films while we wait for Sundance to roll around again. We'll be covering the festival in its entirety for all 10 days, so stay tuned for our updates starting in early September. Anything that I should be sure to catch this year?"
