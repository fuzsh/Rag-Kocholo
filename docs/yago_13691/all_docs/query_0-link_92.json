        "text": "The camera pans across a white hospital ward. Veiled figures speak in hushed tones and there are no reflective surfaces anywhere. A man scrawls a single word on a blackboard: \"mirror\". Not yet, says his nurse reassuringly.\n\nBut moments later the man is unravelling his bandages and studying the reflection of his ravaged profile in the window pane. It is the first time we have seen his face. For a full 35 minutes of screen time, since a German shell first exploded, the camera has avoided revealing this soldier's injuries.\n\nFran√ßois Dupeyron's First World War drama The Officers' Ward is a war movie without violence, a \"disfigurement\" film that refuses to equate looks with self-worth. It may be French arthouse, but it's a lot more radical in its treatment of scarred bodies than modern Hollywood films like Vanilla Sky and Pay It Forward which shamelessly hijack disfigurement as a clever plot mechanism or a bid for pathos (poor, wounded Tom, tragic brooding Spacey).\n\nBased on a book by Mark Duigan, The Officers' Ward focuses on a dashing officer, Adrien F, who is injured before fighting even starts. He spends the next five years in the specialist Val de Grace hospital near Paris ‚Äì the birthplace of 20th-century plastic surgery ‚Äì having his jaw and mouth rebuilt. While Adrien's distress is acute, the film is never manipulative or sensationalist. And much of this is to do with the way Dupeyron makes us complicit in Adrien's experience. His face is our face. When we see the extent of the damage we wince, but it is still recognisably a human face.\n\nAt least 500,000 people are severely affected by disfigurement in the UK alone. And yet according to James Partridge, director of the charity Changing Faces (which helps people address the psychological and social effects of disfigurement), they rarely see cinematic representations that bear any relationship to their own lives. \"There's always this myth of the disfigured person as a superhero who gets through,\" he says. \"They're never just allowed to be.\"\n\nFilm writer Paul Darke, who has cerebral palsy, agrees \"There's a sense that you're more real as a human being if you've been damaged in some way ‚Äì which is just another tired old clich√© that we've got an extra link to humanity, whereas we're as likely to be arseholes as anyone else.\"\n\nPartridge suffered severe facial burns in a car accident at the age of 18. He continually looks to film and literature for role models ‚Äì and cites The Elephant Man and The English Patient as humane, rounded examples. Mel Gibson's The Man Without A Face, however, was a major disappointment. \"It could have been a fantastic vehicle,\" he insists. \"Unfortunately he's presented as a sly fellow, always hiding from the spotlight, even taking pleasure in frightening the children with his burns.\"\n\nBut cinema has always had a complex relationship with disfigurement, starting with the birth of horror films in the 1920s when it was presented as family entertainment ‚Äì Lon Chaney in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Phantom of The Opera, Tod Browning's Freaks, James Whales' Frankenstein. Images of facial injury improved in the 1940s with the return of the noble war hero. But from the 1950s onwards, disfigurement came to be seen as \"other\" ‚Äì the loner, the sexual dysfunctional. Eventually, of course, studios cottoned on to the fact that disfigured stars are Oscar gold (remember Tom Hanks's lesion ravaged face in Philadelphia?). Though even today we're not above using it for pure titillation ‚Äì Gary Oldman's hideously devoured face in Hannibal, or Willem Dafoe in Shadow Of A Vampire.\n\nAnd it's nearly always men. With honourable exceptions like Joan Crawford in A Woman's Face, you very rarely get disfigured heroines. As Paul Darke observes, \"It's too risky because cinema and popular culture are so wrapped up with the beauty of women.\"\n\nIn an industry where the Hollywood star's best friend is her plastic surgeon it's little wonder that anxiety exists around facial difference. The camera comes in so close these days, that even mature beauties like Annette Bening and Isabella Rossellini are left looking haggard. Furthermore, Hollywood \"polices\" its stars so that Cameron Diaz's acne or Catherine Zeta Jones's tracheotomy scar are digitally erased on film (but revealed in websites like www.skinema.com).\n\nIs Paul Darke worried about the extent of stereotyping disfigured people in films? \"I would say cultural representations are only dangerous if they consistently portray only one kind of version of what it is like to live with a certain condition,\" he says. \"Films like Vanilla Sky are so deeply rooted in the stereotypes of abnormality that it's better to escape into a virtual reality world which breaks down occasionally than to deal with the reality of being disfigured.\"\n\nLike Vanilla Sky, The Officers Ward tackles the unsayable about the body. Is it worth living when you are considered \"abnormal\" looking? (Long-term inmates keep suicide watch on new patients who have to confront their destroyed faces.) If you wear a surgical mask, who are you protecting? Can anyone ever love you again?\n\nIn fact all three male protagonists discover that they are fundamentally loveable. But Dupeyron is also aware of the political dimensions of the story. They are men, officer class, and privileged. The only disfigured woman in the hospital is Marguerite, a modern woman who volunteered as a nurse to escape her bourgeois family. Deprived of female company, the officers fall half in love with her ‚Äì until the war ends. Unlike the men, Marguerite senses she will never marry. \"Women are different. Different things matter to them,\" she tells Adrien.\n\nPaul Darke is currently compiling a BFI catalogue of disability films, to be released in October at the same time as the re-release of the 1937 film Freaks. Refreshingly he has little time for PC flannel. The catalogue title is Deformed People Depress Me after a favourite line in the Vincent Price movie Dragonwyck. \"I think often there's a lot more to be got from a truly bad disfigurement film than one that is moderately good,\" he explains. \"A bad film reveals far more about the nature of society, where a good one tries to dress it up in modern politics and equality and diversity. I think that even the worst kind of films ‚Äì if it's your impairment ‚Äì give you something to hold on to.\"\n\n'The Officers' Ward' is out on Friday"
