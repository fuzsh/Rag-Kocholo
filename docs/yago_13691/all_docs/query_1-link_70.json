        "text": "The art film series presented by The Valley Film Society of Saginaw Valley State University begins Friday, Sept. 11, in Curtiss Hall 100 on the campus of SVSU, 7400 Bay in Kochville Township.\n\nScreenings begin at 7:30 p.m. Cost to attend is by membership; or by individual film, $6 for two trial memberships.

A massively quirky family. Small gem, sparked by sterling cast.\n\nSept. 25\n\n\"The Tracker\" (Australia, 2002; Rolf de Heer, 90 min.)\n\nIn the 1922 Australian outback three white men, led by an aboriginal tracker, hunt an aboriginal fugitive. In the course of their beautifully filmed quest the supposedly subservient tracker is more in control than they realize.\n\nOct. 2\n\n\"84 Charing Cross Road\" (USA, 1987; David Jones, 97 min.)\n\nA 20-year correspondence between a feisty NYC woman and a London bookseller who provides her with rare books leads to friendship. Ideal performances by Anne Bancroft, Anthony Hopkins and Judi Dench.\n\nOct. 16\n\n\"L'Auberge Espagnole\" (France/Spain, 2002 ; Cedric Klapisch, 116 min.)\n\nA French graduate student goes to Barcelona for his year abroad, then finds himself in a cramped apartment with six strangers of different nationalities. Mirthful adventure.\n\nOct. 30\n\n\"Color of Paradise\" (Iran, 1999; Majid Majidi, 88 min.)\n\nA blind 8-year old Iranian boy, deeply sensitive to nature, returns to his home in mountainous northern Iran, where he must cope with a father who considers him a burden.\n\nNov. 6\n\n\"Bread and Tulips\" (Italy/Switzerland, 2000; Silvio Soldini, 114 min.)\n\nA suburban Italian housewife/mother is stranded in a roadside cafe when her family leaves without her, so she hitchhikes to Venice. There she settles in and meets strange, but fascinating, people and perhaps a new life.\n\nNov. 20\n\n\"Monsieur Ibrahim\" (France, 2003; Francois Dupeyron, 94 min.)\n\nA Jewish teen in 1960s Paris befriends an elderly, philosophical, Muslim Turkish neighbor (Omar Sharif).

Brilliant, literate, absorbing film, with Gerard Depardieu outstanding in the title role.\n\nJan. 29\n\n\"Saraband\" (Sweden, 2003; Ingmar Bergman, 107 min.)\n\nA dysfunctional couple are reunited 30 years after their divorce, and are involved in family turmoil. Rich, deep emotional complexity that characterized director Bergman's best films.\n\nFeb. 12\n\n\"Mifune\" (Denmark, 1999; Soren Kragh-Jacobsen, 99 min.)\n\nA newlywed must take care of his mentally retarded brother after their father dies. Complications follow when his new housekeeper turns out to be an ex-hooker with her own problems.\n\nFeb. 26\n\n\"Secret of Nicola Tesla\" (Yugoslavia, 1980; Krsto Papic, 115 min.)\n\nA biography of Tesla, outstanding inventor of electrical applications in the late 19th to early 20th century. Orson Welles plays J.P. Morgan. Among Tesla's inventions were radio and alternating current.\n\nMarch 19\n\n\"Taxing Woman\" (Japan, 1987; Juzo Itami, 126 min)\n\nA comedy about a tireless, zealous woman investigator for the Japanese IRS and her confrontation with a businessman who considers himself a pro in evading taxes.\n\nApril 2\n\n\"The Prisoner of Shark Island\" (USA, 1936; John Ford, 95min.)\n\nThe story of Dr. Samuel Mudd, who treated the injuries of Lincoln's assassin, then was imprisoned for life. Gripping story. Leonard Maltin awards it ***1/2.\n\nApril 9\n\n\"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring\" (South Korea/Germany, 2004; Ki-duk Kim, 103 min.)\n\nThe tenets of Buddhism as illustrated by cyclical patterns of a young monk's life: he confronts birth, death, rebirth via violence, danger, love and compassion."
