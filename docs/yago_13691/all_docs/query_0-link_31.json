This award-winning film gives us a sober meditation on the Great War and its terrible new casualties: from a one night stand between a soldier and a nurse, to the front, to the hospital clinic. Through poignant performances, we see soldiers, nurses,and ordinary men and women confront what is inhuman about war.\n\nCost: Free and Open to the Public\n\nSponsors: The Center for French and Francophone Studies, the Department of Romance Studies, and the Program in the Arts of the Moving Image (AMI)"
