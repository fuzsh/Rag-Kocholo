        "text": "I thought I had played this game in the past. Clearly, I have not, because I don’t recall the opening level at all. In Action/Adventure games, where I’m learning the controls, I tend to remember the fine details.\n\nThe game is a Playstation port, which never bodes well for PC players. Someone’s wires always seem to get crossed as they try to make the PC game controls do what the console controls do. You’ll find your character almost unresponsive in some situations that should be simple movements.\n\nUnlike in my beloved Tomb Raider games, you can’t save early and often. Before and after jumps being the traditional spot. Here, you need to finish a chapter fully, and then when you exit the game saves you there.\n\nSo, those wily Ivory Hunters are around to teach you the basics of combat. Punching with your fists is a favorite mode. It does not help at all, for instance, to try “punching” with your machete in one hand to do extra damage. Nope.\n\nPut up your fists and fight like a man.\n\nUnless. There are two hunters at their little camp. They laugh at your fists.\n\nYou missed the little room off to the side with the shovel.\n\nAs you go whaling into the camp with your best friend the shovel, the game lets you know you might take a moment to try a bottle or chair on the guys. I’m sure the Ivory Hunters will wait while I get positioned just right to pick up the bottle or chair.\n\nThe shovel was great. Whap, whap.\n\nNow that those guys are gone, you get to the good stuff. Using your whip to leap across chasms by wrapping it around handy crocodile heads.\n\nA bit trickier for me was the “Wall Hug”. This is a simple movement in most games, you just make your way along a narrow ledge, then jump to your next spot. Here, you’re supposed to walk up to the wall, press E, and Indy puts his back to the wall and sidles sideways. Except he doesn’t, several times, and you drop below and have to climb and swing back up. Getting him to go the direction you want once he is in position….But I finally got it.\n\nThe broken floor tile and break through pillars leaps were nothing after the Wall Hug.\n\nAh, what’s the real bane of your existence in these games? Swimming. Drowning.\n\nLook at that tiny bit of water. Indy can’t swim. If you use the spacebar (Jump) as is intuitive to get him to go up to the surface, he dives down. I got him to his first objective here, but as soon as he went back in to try to climb higher, he seemed to be pulled to the bottom. I couldn’t control him at all or get him to the surface for air. Yup, he died. And, if I can only get a save once he’s through the Hunter’s Camp Chapter, I will need to do these sequences all again. Not missing the shovel next time."
