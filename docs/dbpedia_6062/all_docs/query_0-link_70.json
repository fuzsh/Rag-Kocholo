        "text": "Not to be confused with Collective Digital Studio.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Collective was a California-based development studio founded in 1997 by industry veterans. In April 2005, the company entered a venture with Backbone Entertainment, which led to the creation of Foundation 9 Entertainment. In 2007, The Collective and Shiny Entertainment were both merged into a single entity named Double Helix Games.\n\n1st Logo (September 30, 1998)\n\nVisuals: On a deep blue background, one half and two quarter purple ring outlines fade in and fly to the center to form a full ring. A checkered circle zooms in behind the ring, with \"THE\" and \"COLLECTIVE\" following it under. The formation then pulsates and the ring gains silver sides, then a concentric light shines through it and the text, which gains a metallic look.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: A quick electronic tune with whooshes.\n\nAvailability: Seen on The Game of Life for PS1.\n\n2nd Logo (November 23, 2000-August 29, 2003)\n\nVisuals: The Collective logo, in red and made out of steel, slowly rotates to the screen.\n\nVariant: On Star Trek, the still logo is used and the name says \"COLLECTIVE STUDIOS\". The background is cosmic, but on the demo version, it's black.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A dull windy sound.\n\nAvailability: Can be found on Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb. The still version appeared on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - The Fallen.\n\n3rd Logo (February 10, 2004)\n\nVisuals: The camera moves across a stone peak with evening skies in the background. Two shadows move on the peak, depicting creatures in combat with each other. As they fight, the camera moves up and reveals the Collective logo in the same color as the dusty stone. The dust is wiped off the stone and the background becomes gray concrete, while the logo remains red and steel. Then the logo shines.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The sound of raging creatures, then the dust falling off.\n\nAvailability: Can be found on Wrath Unleashed.\n\n4th Logo (May 4, 2005)\n\nVisuals: The logo, with the company name now being in a different lowercase font, is carved in a stone while lava pours and fills it. Then it flashes and becomes still, taken into a box.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A chanting ambient sound.\n\nAvailability: Appeared on Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.\n\n5th Logo (February 14, 2006)\n\nVisuals: There is a sped-up live-action clip of a black man drawing the logo on a wall. While every space is covered in paint, the logo pattern remains white. Then the action blurs out and becomes red with white drops of paint. Then it segues to the Foundation 9 logo, which itself quickly fades.\n\nTechnique: Live-action combined with blurring and fading effects.\n\nAudio: A kind of ethnic tune with paint gas hissing out.\n\nAvailability: Appeared on Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure.\n\n6th Logo (May 19, 2006)\n\nVisuals: A red tile flies in, viewed in perspective, and flashes as a wiping line proceeds through its surface and a myriad of red particles zoom into the tile in a flood of light, creating the white Collective logo. The tile moves during the action, and turns full view, shining a bit. The Foundation 9 byline fades in below.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A choir with a whoosh."
