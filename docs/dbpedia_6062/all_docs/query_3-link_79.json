        "text": "Harrison Ford first picked up Indiana Jones’ whip in 1981., the year in which ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’, the legendary film by Steven Spielberg, premiered. The beginning of the adventure saga per excellence in cinema, whose last film arrived last year (‘Indiana Jones and the dial of destiny’). More than 40 years of history in which its influence has inspired countless works.\n\nThe fact that we are talking about Indiana Jones is not by chance, but rather the spectacular announcement of the new game in the saga developed by MachineGames (Wolfenstein) for Xbox Series X|S and PC. But since its launch is still several months away, we have decided to look back to the best Indiana Jones video games that have been released so far.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n\nShortly after the premiere of the legendary film, LucasArts was brave when it came to releasing what automatically becameone of the most acclaimed graphic adventures of all time, since it was not exactly a prosperous time for film adaptations in video games. One of its main attractions is thatIt was not an exact representation of the film’s script, but rather a complement to it that expanded the story in a very interesting way.. One of those video games that you have to try once in your life.\n\nIndiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis\n\nIt is very likely that if this were a poll, this would be the winner. Because the passing of the years has not prevented it from being at the top of the lists of fan favorites of both Indiana Jones and the graphic adventure genre.A completely original story set in World War II in which the objectives are to locate Atlantis, and at the controls - or rather, the keyboard and mouse - a title full of exploration and puzzles that forced us to bring out our ingenuity.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Infernal Machine\n\nIt may not be one of the most popular, but that doesn’t mean we should forget about it. It was developed by LucasArts and came exclusively to Nintendo 64 as far as consoles are concerned, in addition to also landing on PC.Graphically it was very powerful for the time (1999) and the playable proposal was quite similar to that of the first Tomb Raider. As for the story, it is set in 1947 and focuses on the figure of a group of Soviet scientists who try to unravel a mystery related to travel between parallel dimensions.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb\n\nJust like what was seen in Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machines, this time we are also faced with a game similar to the adventures of Lara Croft. A title with a very careful design in which the soundtrack was practically identical to those of the films, whose starting point is located in the Jungle of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and in which Jones, played by Harrison Ford, was on a mission to find an idol of the goddess Kouru Watu. The game stands out for immersing us in an action-packed journey that takes us to places as diverse as Prague, Hong Kong and Istanbul, among others.\n\nLEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures\n\nThe popularity achieved by video games in which LEGO adapts film franchises to its exclusive style is due, in large part, to the success of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures. It was 2008 when Traveler’s Tales surprised everyone with a trilogy based on the first three films: ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’, ‘The Temple of Doom’ and ‘The Last Crusade’. A simple proposal at the controls, with a lot of action, exploration and the occasional puzzle that also allowed us to play with our friends thanks to the cooperative mode."
