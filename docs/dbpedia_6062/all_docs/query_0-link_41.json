        "text": "Globetrotting archaeologist Indiana Jones embarks on another video game adventure with Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb. Unlike the previous Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, the game is designed to be more action-oriented with hand-to-hand combat against martial artists and Nazis throughout the streets of Hong Kong and 1935 China. Objects in the environment can also be used as weapons, so Indy can clang heads with a shovel or knock foes back with a chair in addition to using his bullwhip and pistol.\n\nDr. Jones will also be able to zip through the narrow, crowded streets, and canals on board a rickshaw and gondola, respectively, to elude his pursuers. As Indy makes his way through the humid jungles of Cylon, the mysterious underwater cities of Istanbul, and across the South China Sea, he will be joined periodically by the beautiful Mei Ying. Together they must prevent a variety of hostile groups from getting their hands on the legendary Heart of the Dragon, a relic with unimaginable power.\n\nThe game's score was composed by Clint Bajakian, utilizing The Raiders March by John Williams. Thirty-three minutes of music were recorded by a 65-piece orchestra at the Bastyr University Chapel. Additional, synthesized music - mostly in the realm of softer, non-action music - was created by Bajakian. Samples of the score were for a time available for download on the game website.\n\nPLOT:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb begins in the jungles of Ceylon, where Indiana Jones is searching for the idol of Kouru Watu. After retrieving the idol, Jones meets a Nazi named Albrecht Von Beck, who is attacked by a giant albino crocodile, allowing Jones to escape. Back at school in New York City, Chinese officials Marshall Kai Ti Chan and his assistant Mei Ying inform Jones of the Heart of the Dragon, a black pearl buried with the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huangdi. Mei Ying breaks open the Ceylon idol to find the first piece of the \"Mirror of Dreams\", an artifact that will help navigate through the Emperor's Tomb and reveal the entrance to Huangdi's crypt.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Guide the whip-cracking hero through Hong Kong, Ceylon, Istanbul, and other exotic locales\n\n* Indy can rely on weapons or his fists to defeat an assortment of enemies\n\n* Jump, swim, swing, climb, and perform other acrobatic maneuvers to traverse the dangerous terrain\n\nMANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION:\n\nAs Indiana Jones, you'll travel to 1935 China to prevent a powerful artifact from falling into evil hands.
