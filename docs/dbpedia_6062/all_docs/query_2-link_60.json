It's pretty obvious that whoever did the writing for the game was not under the same religious scrutiny the EU materials of Star Wars receive.\n\nTo the new guy: Please use the search before opening new threads. That's how we roll here. If there's an existing thread, no matter how old it is, stick to it. Merged.\n\nTo myself, four years in the past: Now available from GOG.com. Costs peanuts, is DRM free.\n\nMy take hasn't changed much over the years: As a game, it's decent enough and fun to play. As an Indiana Jones story, it's garbage.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is the Wu Han introduction.\n\nAnd maybe the lack of Doug Lee.\n\nOtherwise I thought it was solid and leaps and bounds beyond Staff of Kings in terms of quality.\n\nWell I am not sure if the developers ever considered hiring Doug Lee again to voice the role of Indiana Jones, I am not sure if they even remembered him from Fate.\n\nStaff of Kings could have been so much more. I have the PS2 game for the sake adding it to my Indy games but I honestly don't want to play that game ever again.\n\nWell Infernal Machine was still by Hal Barwood, perhaps he and his team remembered Doug Lee from the last time they worked with him.\n\nBy the time Staff of Kings was made, hadn't Hal Barwood already left Lucasarts?\n\nWell there is of course Indiana Jones and the Fountain of Youth but I don't see another Indiana Jones coming so soon unless Indy 5 is made or Disney really plans to reboot the franchise.\n\nI had hoped that Dark Horse would at least have continued with new comic mini series and installments of Indiana Jones Adventures after they started making Indy comics again."
