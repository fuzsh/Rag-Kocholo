        "text": "Don't know if the voice work follows the files exactly. I edited it through Excel, Text, then Word. Every level's file starts with new in-game Indy lines, which I sprinkled in as seemed logical. I know it's not perfect. Read it all here.\n\nM01_SRI LANKA: INDY\n\nM01 INTRO SEQUENCE: THE HEART OF KOURU WATU\n\nIDY According to the map, that stone head marks the secret entrance into the lost city. (to self)\n\nIDY Beyond the city lies the temple of the black river goddess and inside, the Idol of Kouru Watu. I’m close now.\n\nIDY Good thing I brought my whip\n\nIDY I'll need to cut through these vines\n\nIDY I can use this water to fill up my canteen\n\nIDY Looks like that Pillar is ready to topple. I just have to give it a push in the right spot.\n\nIDY Hmm… This looks interesting.\n\nIDY The stone has been weakened here. If I could get my hands on some explosives, I could blast a way through.\n\nIDY That bat statue is some sort of trap mechanism. It seems to be triggered by sounds. Maybe I can trick it into shooting at something else.\n\nIDY Whoa… looks like somebody's been overfeeding the fish.\n\nIDY If I don't get that monster out of the way this is going to be a real short swim.\n\nM01: INDY SPOTS THE IVORY HUNTER CAMP\n\nIDY Ivory Hunters. These guys are no boy scouts. I’d better watch my back.\n\nIHR Keep an eye out for the American. Von Beck wants his head!\n\nIHR Damn mosquitoes!\n\nIHR Von Beck isn’t paying us enough for this.\n\nIHR There he is!\n\nIHR Oi! He’s over here!\n\nIHR Get him lads!\n\nIHR I’m gonna make you eat that whip!\n\nIHR I’ll gut you like a fish, pretty boy!\n\nIHR Eat this, Yankee!\n\nIHR You fight dirty, eh? Well so do I!\n\nM01: INDY SURVIVES A TRAUMATIC FALL AFTER A BRIDGE COLLAPSES\n\nIDY That was too close.\n\nM01: INDY SEES THE GODDESS STATUE\n\nIDY There it is….the Heart of Kouru Watu\n\nIDY There must be away to get that thing open.\n\nIDY There she is, Kouru Watu. Not exactly my idea of a hot date. (to self)\n\nIDY There’s got to be a way inside.\n\nM01: INDY RUNS INTO VON BECK AS HE CLIMBS OUT OF A CROC-INFESTED POOL\n\nVBK Guten Tag, Dr. Jones. It’s a beautiful day for a swim, is it not? I would join you, but I seem to have forgotten my bathing suit.\n\nIDY No problem. I can lend you mine. It’s back at the hotel.\n\nVBK Ah, the famous American sense of humor! (chuckling)\n\nVBK I never really understood it. (draws a mauser)\n\nIDY Look, Hans or Klaus, or whatever your name is… I don’t know what you’re talking about, but whatever it is, I’m sure we can cut a deal. (angry)\n\nVBK Very well, here is the “deal”… you will give me the idol. (raises his pistol)\n\nVBK Now!\n\nIDY Okay, okay, you’ve made your point. I’ve got what you want right here. (raises hands)\n\nVBK Aarrgh! Kill him!\n\nM01: INDY MEETS KAI & MEI YING AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM\n\nKAI Excuse me…\n\nIDY The exhibit hall is upstairs. (not looking up)\n\nKAI We are not tourists, Dr. Jones.\n\nKAI I am Marshal Kai Ti Chang of the Chinese Republic. This is my assistant, Mei Ying.\n\nIDY So... what can I do for you? (playfully at Mei Ying)\n\nMYG Are you sure this is the right Dr. Jones? It’s a very common name… (in Cantonese to Kai)\n\nKAI Don’t let appearances fool you. Dr. Jones comes highly recommended and as someone who is not afraid to get his hands dirty. (in Cantonese to Mei Ying)\n\nIDY Hands, knees, elbows... whatever it takes to get the job done. What did you have in mind? (in Cantonese to Mei Ying)\n\nKAI What do you know about Ch’in Shi-Huang-ti?\n\nIDY The first emperor of China? He built the Great Wall and established a dynastic government that lasted for centuries. His reign lasted from 255 B.C. to--\n\nKAI That information can be found in a schoolbook, Dr. Jones. My interests concern the stories surrounding the Emperor’s tomb. (interrupting)\n\nKAI As you’re undoubtedly aware, Emperor Ch’in is buried under Mount Li near the city of Sian.\n\nIDY Yes. That’s about all anybody really knows for sure.\n\nIDY According to the legends, Ch’in’s tomb is an immense underground city filled with unimaginable riches, which took thousands of workers several years to build.\n\nIDY After its completion, all those involved with the construction of the tomb were sealed inside.\n\nIDY At least that’s what the stories say. Due to Chinese superstition nobody really knows for sure.\n\nKAI Yes, the Chinese people have always held that excavation and desecration of the tomb are one and the same. As a consequence, no one has ever been allowed to explore it.\n\nKAI Until now.\n\nIDY Why are you coming to me with this? Chinese history isn’t exactly my specialty. (ponders Kai’s last line)\n\nKAI It’s your non-academic reputation that interests me. Have you ever heard of the Heart of the Dragon?\n\nIDY Only in Chinese folklore. It’s a mythological artifact, like Excalibur or the Holy Grail.\n\nKAI Ah, but unlike those flights of western fancy, the Heart of the Dragon is quite real.\n\nKAI A flawless black pearl that was buried with the Emperor, it’s said that the Heart possesses the power to control the will of men.\n\nIDY Look, I know you traveled a long way to see me, but I’m an archaeologist not a mystic.\n\nKAI Then it’s a good thing I came looking for an archaeologist.\n\nKAI Superstitious folk tales aside, the Heart is a priceless treasure of the Chinese people; one that must never fall into the wrong hands.\n\nKAI That is why China wants you to find it.\n\nIDY Okay, let’s say I’m interested. It’ll take months of meticulous excavation to find the entrance to Ch’in’s crypt... I wouldn’t even know where to begin.\n\nKAI On the contrary, Dr. Jones, you’ve already begun.\n\nIDY Hey!\n\nIDY What the heck is that?\n\nKAI It is one-third of the Mirror of Dreams. The Mirror is the key to finding the crypt’s entrance within the tomb.\n\nMYG You do not realize the magnitude of the events you have set in motion, Dr. Jones. Even as we speak, others are pursuing the two remaining pieces. (interrupting)\n\nMYG If they get the Mirror, nothing will stop them from entering the crypt, stealing the Heart, and using its power to enslave the world!\n\nKAI My apologies, Professor. My assistant is cursed with a vivid imagination and an impetuous tongue.\n\nIDY Reminds me of my last date.\n\nKAI In any event, the British government has graciously allowed me to take possession of this artifact on China’s behalf.\n\nKAI We want you to recover the final two pieces of the Mirror, enter Ch’in’s crypt, and recover the Heart of the Dragon.\n\nKAI You’ll become the most famous archaeologist in history. Will you help us?\n\nIDY A chance to become the first man in the Emperor’s Tomb? (Kai nods)\n\nIDY When do we leave?\n\nKAI I’ve already booked you a flight to Prague. It leaves tomorrow morning.\n\nMYG This contains everything you need to know. Read it on the flight.\n\nMYG Be careful, Dr. Jones. The path to the Dragon’s Heart is more dangerous than you can imagine.\n\nIDY It always is, sweetheart.\n\nHere's the generic lines file I couldn't integrate.\n\nNotice the Die Hard reference, \"shoot the glass\"?\n\nGENERIC LINES: INDY\n\nIDY I can’t take much more of this.\n\nIDY Whew… I’m exhausted. I sure could use a drink.\n\nIDY That’s the way to the gondola station. If I had the right change of clothes, I might even get a ride.\n\nIDY This looks important.\n\nIDY This belongs in a museum…\n\nIDY She might not be pretty, but she’s got it where it counts.\n\nIDY Sweetheart, we have a date with destiny\n\nIDY Pull the pin, throw, run like hell.\n\nIDY I think the odds just changed in my favor.\n\nIDY Time to do a little redecorating…\n\nIDY Party of one?\n\nIDY Bill me\n\nIDY Put it on my tab…\n\nIDY Bottoms up!\n\nIDY This ones on me!\n\nIDY Time to do a little gardening\n\nIDY Its full.\n\nIDY I've had enough.\n\nIDY Times like this…. I realize I should have kept that teaching job.\n\nIDY We can do this the easy or hard way\n\nIDY Why do they always pick the hard way…\n\nIDY These guys just DON’T give up!”\n\nIDY Now you're really getting on my nerves…\n\nIDY I don’t hit women… but in your case… I’ll make an exception.\n\nIDY This’ll hurt more than your feelings, sweetheart\n\nIDY You mugs ever hear of a shower?”\n\nIDY Just when I thought things couldn’t get any worse…\n\nIDY You've gotta be kidding me\n\nIDY Have a nice trip…\n\nIDY Watch that last step…\n\nIDY Homerun!\n\nIDY Score!\n\nIDY We have a winner!\n\nIDY Four!\n\nIDY Sharks. I hate sharks.\n\nIDY This looks important.\n\nIDY This could come in handy.\n\nIDY Trust me.\n\nIDY It's not the years...it's the mileage\n\nIDY I don’t know…I’m making this up as I go\n\nIDY This could come in handy.\n\nIDY “Lock n load.”\n\nIDY \"I hate it when there are more Nazis than I have bullets.\"\n\nIDY Not good! I need an edge …\n\nIDY That’s it. I’m empty.\n\nIDY Hmmm…\n\nIDY This oughtta even up the odds.\n\nIDY Boom.\n\nIDY I’ll try not to blow myself up.\n\nIDY Fortune and glory, here I come.\n\nIDY I’m gonna be a rich man. If I ever get out of this alive...\n\nIDY Jackpot.\n\nIDY That’s not going to work.\n\nIDY Not bad. Sometimes I impress even myself.\n\nIDY Nice.\n\nIDY Indiana Jones, world famous archaeologist. Got a nice ring to it.\n\nIDY Hey, what’s that?!\n\nIDY I think someone just stepped on my grave.\n\nIDY It's too quiet. (emphasis on too)\n\nIDY I’ve got a bad feeling about this.\n\nIDY That was too close. (emphasis on too)\n\nIDY I think it's time to find a new career.\n\nIDY It's jammed shut.\n\nIDY I’ll have to find another way around.\n\nIDY Hmm… It’s locked from the other side.\n\nIDY Nazis. I hate these guys.\n\nIDY Look out!\n\nIDY Behind you!\n\nKAI GIVES SPOOKY MOD HINT\n\nKAI The mirror is the key to finding the crypt's entrance within the tomb\n\nGENERIC LINES: MARSHALL KAI\n\nKAP At last, I have returned to claim my destiny!\n\nKAP No mere mortal can stand against me!\n\nKAP Behold! The power of the Dragon!\n\nGENERIC LINES: MEI YING\n\nMYG Don’t get fresh with me. We have a job to do.\n\nMYG Exactly what do you think you’re doing?\n\nMYG Why are you looking at me like that?\n\nMYG Hmmph… I thought you were supposed to be some sort of world famous Archaeologist.\n\nMYG I’m waiting…\n\nMYG The Black Dragons will answer for their crimes.\n\nMYG Watch your back, Indy. The Black Dragons know we’re here.\n\nMYG Behind you, Indy!\n\nMYG Indy, look out!\n\nMYG Try my Jade Phoenix technique! (in Mandarin)\n\nMYG You’ll have to do better than that Triad scum!
