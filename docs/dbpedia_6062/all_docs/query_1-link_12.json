        "text": "LucasArts has in the past relied heavily on the success of the Star Wars franchise... perhaps a little too much. That however, appears to be changing as the company attempts to diversify its portfolio with a number of new and original titles. Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb -- a third-person action adventure -- is one such title currently in development. Controlling the titular archeologist is relatively simple; controls mimic those found in most third-person action titles, though the camera work is little more than serviceable.While searching the ancient ruins Indy comes across a number of villains, no doubt tomb raiders or thieves of some kind. Regardless of their motives, they'll set upon the player as soon as you come into view. A whip, pistol and machete were the only offensive weapons I came across in the showfloor demo, however should the need arise, Indy can fight with his bare hands. When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, it's possible to block as well as throw both, left and right-handed punches. Combat, at least at this stage, is a mindless affair, requiring little more than a combination of punch, block, punch... ad infinitum. Multiple opponents should make things more exciting, well, you'd think so, wouldn't you?Fighting multiple opponents is extremely frustrating. Enemy characters have a habit of circling behind and punching you (and thereby sending you flailing to the ground) before you're able to reciprocate. Indy then gets back up and re-orients himself, only to be sent sprawling by a blow from the other enemy who is now behind him. It's possible to capably manage all enemies, but that requires throwing punches, running away, then returning for a few more quick hits. In short, tedious and mind-numbing.Other than that, the game appeared to offer little in the way of innovation or in fact, fun of any kind. The expected jumping puzzles and item-finding quests are all present, as are virtually every single other genre cliché possible. Ironically enough, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb borrows heavily from Tomb Raider, a title that drew inspiration from ol' Indy in the first place. I experienced a handful of collision detection problems, specifically relating to climbing ledges and outcroppings, though this happened only once across multiple play-sessions, and will no doubt be cleaned up before release.Visuals are much improved over early footage, but still lag far behind many of the more promising titles at the show. The Collective, the development studio responsible for the title, have a fair amount of time to improve it before it's release, but as it stands Indy latest adventure will be in mediocrity, not the Emperor's Tomb."
