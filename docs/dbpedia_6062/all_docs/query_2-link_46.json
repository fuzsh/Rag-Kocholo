        "text": "Hello All! I have been a member for a while now, but I never really posted anything, so I'm glad I can contribute in some way with this.\n\nMore than a decade ago, I started a thread in the old Club Obi Wan (nowadays called Indy Gear.com I think?) about recreating some of the fake documents and inserts that appear as theming in the manual for the 2003 game Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb.\n\nLink to an online pdf of the manual\n\nAlso a link to the original 2010 thread, back at the Club Obi Wan forum (sorry for my english back then, it was a while ago XD)\n\nI recently found some files, some of them not avaliable anymore, of the different props some members were able to recreate. I find the concept that interesting, and some of the recreations were that well made, that I though about bringing it up again, and trying to pinpoint and remake these inserts, as if they were actual documents.\n\nI am not going to share the files I have that were made by other members, but if any of them are still online, and want to participate again, they are more than welcomed.\n\nI will post for now the unedited, historical documents that were found back then, and some of my own recreations. Hope you guys are interested on this little project, its very rare to see theming and historical research as deep and complex on a videogame manual like this one.\n\nDavid\n\nAnd here you have some of the assets I made myself:\n\n- All the post stamps that appear on the manual are slight modifications of stamps from the 30s. Members from the old thread made really good recreations of those stamps, but I didnt manage to recover the red 1 Luffpost one from page 18, so I remade it again with the resources I found.\n\n- The luftpost round stamp from page 18, and the Frankfurt Police seal from the page 16 envelope.\n\n- The pages of the training manual that appears on pages 20 and 21\n\n- The german steamship ticket from page 6, based in part on an actual ticket from the era.\n\nAttachments\n\nlufpost1.png\n\nluftpost_stamp.png\n\nTraining guide 1.jpg\n\nticket_back.jpg\n\nticket_front.jpg\n\npolice_insignia.png\n\nSome of the assets I am having more trouble with are\n\n-The photo from page 13. For some reason, the designer labeled it as Hong Kong, when it is actually The Bund, on Shanghai. The photo was taken from roughly the same place as this one, but it has what I assume is a truck near the kiosk looking structure. I haven't found that particular photo so far.\n\n- The map on pages 18 and 19. With the little amount of detail that it has I assume it is a world map.\n\n- There is part of a banknote hidden on page 23. I dont think anyone identified it yet.\n\n- The playing card on page 29\n\n- The assets of the classified page of pages 34 and 35, and the bullwhipping diploma on pages 36 and 37\n\nIf anyone has any info about any of those I would be very thankful\n\nIf anyone wants to try to recreate the different drawings that appear across the manual, I found some of the inspirations behind the ones that are partially hidden, so there is a reference point to complete them. All are different locations and artifacts found in the countries where the game takes place, most of them unrelated to the main plot, as far as I know.\n\n- The one on page 17 represents Prague's Astronomical Clock, including the spire at the top of it\n\n- Both from page 11 come from Ceylon, nowadays Sri Lanka. The one at the bottom of the page is a coin bar, from their dutch occupation period, and very hard to find, as it seems. The one I am posting is actually a forgery stored in the British Museum, but very similar on design to the illustration.\n\nI suspect that the illustration at the upper side of this same page is a traditional sri lankan dance. I found photos with very similar poses. But I havent found any match with the headpiece that the figure wears. It is maybe from a very specific source image, or from a piece of art, but I am not sure.\n\n- Finally, the one in page 25 is one of the terracotta warriors from the mausoleum of the First Emperor of Qin. In this case, a kneeling archer.\n\nThank you guys!\n\nWell, today I have been in a little adventure trying to identify the logo of Club Swank, from page 33. It took me most of the day XD.\n\nObviously such club doesn't exist, but it mentions Chicago, and that has to be an actual skyscraper, so that's a starting point. Looking through different photos of Chicago's skyline during the 30s, I found this.\n\nThat's it! It has to be that building!\n\nLooking for the name of such building has been the most difficult part. The websites about Chicago's history that I found mentioned all the other skyscrapers that appear on the photo, except that particular one. And I found very few maps of chicago during the 30s, and with very little info.\n\nI was about to give up, when I decided to enter google maps, and search for the building myself. Using the other skyscrapers on the photo as references I finally found it.\n\nNowadays part of the Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile Hotel, this used to be the Medinah Athletic Club, built on 1929, according to wikipedia.\n\nI though I found the source when I found that painting (by Frank Raymond btw), but it didn't match yet.\n\nThe designer used stamps, postcards and matchbooks for other pages already, so I decided to look for memorabilia related to the Medinah Club.\n\nWith matchbooks I started to find very promising results.\n\nUntil I finally found it\n\nI'm pretty sure this was the original, with some added modifications later.\n\nThe matchbook was on sale on Ebay, so I bough it. If nothing goes wrong I will be able to scan it in the future.\n\nBut hey, it is great to finally find the original picture. I am exhausted XD\n\nThank you guys!\n\nWell, today I have been in a little adventure trying to identify the logo of Club Swank, from page 33. It took me most of the day XD.\n\nView attachment 1531540\n\nObviously such club doesn't exist, but it mentions Chicago, and that has to be an actual skyscraper, so that's a starting point. Looking through different photos of Chicago's skyline during the 30s, I found this.\n\nView attachment 1531546\n\nThat's it! It has to be that building!\n\nLooking for the name of such building has been the most difficult part. The websites about Chicago's history that I found mentioned all the other skyscrapers that appear on the photo, except that particular one. And I very little maps of chicago during the 30s, and with very little info.\n\nI was about to give up, when I decided to enter google maps, and search for the building myself. Using the other skyscrapers on the photo as references I finally found it.\n\nView attachment 1531548\n\nNowadays part of the Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile Hotel, this used to be the Medinah Athletic Club, built on 1929, according to wikipedia.\n\nView attachment 1531549 View attachment 1531550\n\nI though I found the source when I found that painting (by Frank Raymond btw), but it didn't match yet.\n\nThe designer used stamps, postcards and matchbooks for other pages already, so I decided to look for memorabilia related to the Medinah Club.\n\nWith matchbooks I started to find very promising results.\n\nView attachment 1531551\n\nUntil I finally found it\n\nView attachment 1531552\n\nView attachment 1531553\n\nI'm pretty sure this was the original, with some added modifications later.\n\nThe matchbook was on sale on Ebay, so I bough it. If nothing goes wrong I will be able to scan it in the future.\n\nBut hey, it is great to finally find the original picture. I am exhausted XD\n\nVery nice detective work!\n\nLooking back at the routine, I think it is too intense for what it seems more like the doctor telling indy to take it easier, and take better care of his body. Doing a little more of research, I found about the Daily Dozen, a workout plan very popular in the 20s. Maybe Doctor Frodente is a bit old school, who knows XD.\n\nIt is way more text, that's for sure.\n\n(EDIT: A few typos fixed, and now the main text is slighly weathered, so it looks less harsh to the eye)"
