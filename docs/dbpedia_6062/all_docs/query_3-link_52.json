For full details on how to activate please follow this link: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5414-TFBN-1352\n\nDescription\n\nAs Indiana Jones, you’ll travel to 1935 China to prevent a powerful artifact from falling into evil hands. This globe-spanning adventure pits you against evil Nazis and the Asian underworld. It’ll take more than just a trusty whip and pistol to avoid the perils of the Emperor’s Tomb.\n\nIndy's latest adventure plays out in dramatic fashion thanks to new gameplay features such as brawling combat. This time, in addition to using his trademark whip and pistol, Indy can engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat against foes, many of whom are well-versed in martial arts. Improvised weapons such as shovels, chairs and table legs also can be used to fend off adversaries. The result is a more immersive and more Indy-like gameplay experience, set amidst spine-tingling movie-like action sequences, such as a rickshaw chase in Hong Kong and a spectacular battle atop moving gondolas in the South China Sea area.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nOS: Windows XP or newer Processor: 1.4 GHz Memory: 1 GB RAM Graphics: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c and 256 MB VRAM DirectX: Version 9.0c Storage: 2 GB available space Sound Card: 16-bit sound card Additional Notes: Mouse, Keyboard\n\nLegal Notice / EULA\n\nLucasArts, the LucasArts logo, INDIANA JONES and related properties are trademarks in the United States and/or in other countries of Lucasfilm Ltd. and/or its affiliates. © 2003-2018 Lucasfilm Entertainment Company Ltd. or Lucasfilm Ltd.
