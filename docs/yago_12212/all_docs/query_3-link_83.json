        "text": "Michael Fassbender will take the lead in The Agency, a political espionage thriller described as a “fresh take” on French series Le Bureau des Légendes (The Bureau).\n\nFilming is now underway in London on the series, which will air on Paramount+ with Showtime in the US. It will also air on Paramount+ in the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, Germany, Latin America, Brazil and Japan.\n\nThe Agency follows Martian (Fassbender), a covert CIA agent ordered to abandon his undercover life and return to London Station. When the love he left behind reappears, romance reignites. His career, his real identity and his mission are pitted against his heart; hurling them both into a deadly game of international intrigue and espionage.\n\nJoe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, The Darkest Hour) will direct and executive produce the series and writer Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari, Edge of Tomorrow) will executive produce and write all 10 episodes.\n\nFassbender (X-Men series, Prometheus) is also an executive producer on the project. George Clooney and Grant Heslov will executive produce through their Smokehouse Pictures with Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios set to produce.\n\nThe series is co-distributed internationally by Paramount Global Content Distribution and Federation Studios.\n\nLe Bureau des Légendes centres on the daily life and missions of agents within France’s principal external security service (DGSE). It focuses on the “Bureau of Legends” service, responsible for training and handling deep-cover agents on long-term missions in areas with French interests. Living under false identities for years, these agents’ missions are to identify and recruit good intelligence sources.\n\nIt was created by Eric Rochant and is a CANAL+ Creation Originale series produced by TOP – The Originals Productions and Federation Studios."
