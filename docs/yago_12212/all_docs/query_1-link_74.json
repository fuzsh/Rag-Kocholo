        "text": "Coline is a bilingual French-English screenwriter. After studying philosophy at the Sorbonne, Coline joined the writing team on the hit French TV The Bureau (with Eric Rochant for Canal Plus) and The Returned season 2 (with Fabrice Gobert for Haut et Court / Canal Plus.) Recent English language shows include Brie Larson’s LIFE UNDERCOVER for Apple, DANGEROUS LIASIONS for Starz and THE WALKING DEAD (Europe) for AMC. She has written and served as a supervising producer on AMC’s recent reboot of INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE alongside Rolin Jones and most recently returned for season 2, also serving as a co-executive producer on the series. Coline’s original pilot SISTERS, for Iconoclast and Laure de Cleremont-Tonnerre (MUSTANG.), is the story of three very different women who confront terrifying forces on a migrant boat to the French colony of Louisiana in the early 18th century. Coline is also writing original pilots for AMC, Left Bank (think CHERNOBYL meets THE RETURNED) and New Regency TV, the latter of which is a high-concept body horror set in the French Alps; a cross between Touching The Void and Titane.\n\nColine also co-wrote and directed her first feature documentary, Last Dance, about Vinsantos Defonte, an iconic Drag Queen from New-Orleans. This follows their journey to have a last show in Paris. Charades Films handles the international sales and Condor will distribute in France, with a release date expected later this year.\n\nhttps://www.galerievinsantos.com"
