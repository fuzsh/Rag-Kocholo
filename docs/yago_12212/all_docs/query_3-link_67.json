        "text": "James Bond he is not. In “The Bureau,” Mathieu Kassovitz slips into the role of Malotru, an undercover agent for the French intelligence service, who, returning home to Paris after a six-year mission in Damascus, struggles to relinquish his alias — and a forbidden affair with a married Syrian woman. And suddenly a small untruth, juxtaposed with the lie that is his life, begins to snowball.\n\n“He gets himself into a situation where he wants to do good — but the more he wants to do good, the worse it gets,” said Mr. Kassovitz, 49, best known to Americans for his roles in “Amélie” and “Munich,” and as the director of the César-winning “La Haine,” about a riot in a multiethnic French housing project.\n\n“The Bureau,” Éric Rochant’s cerebral spy thriller, is a smash in France and a chart-topper on iTunes in the United States (you can download the first episode free), and it was named best television series by the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. Focusing on the human toll of espionage, but with enough cutting-edge gadgetry and au courant story lines to keep things provocative, the series was granted access during production to the Dírection Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure, or D.G.S.E., France’s equivalent of the C.I.A.\n\nSo just how much does the show get right?\n\n“When we asked them, they said, ‘Of course I cannot tell you — or if I tell you, I’ll have to kill you,’ ” Mr. Kassovitz recalled. “But they gave DVDs of the first season to their wives and kids and said, ‘Look at these characters, and you might find me in there.’”"
