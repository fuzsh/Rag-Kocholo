They are allies or enemies in the field and in cyberspace. Rochant will serve as showrunner and executive producer, alongside EPs Adelstein and Clements.\n\nThe Bureau centers around French intelligence officer Malotru, played by Matthieu Kassovitz, who after six years of undercover work in Syria, returns home, where he struggles to forget his undercover identity under which he’s in love with a Syrian teacher. He makes a mistake and then has to pay the consequences beyond all expectation, putting everybody around him in danger, especially his country and the ones he loves. The series, which has run for five seasons, was commissioned by Canal+ and has been an international hit.\n\nThe deal was brokered by Tom Lane, Executive Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs at ITV Studios America for Tomorrow Studios and by Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Jackoway Austen for Rochant. ITV Studios will distribute the series internationally.\n\n“I’m really excited to start this new journey with Becky and Marty at Tomorrow Studio,” said Rochant. “I felt so flattered that they wanted me to do my next show with them and I appreciated them asking for me to continue being myself, because they really enjoyed The Bureau. With them I will examine our contemporary world of intelligence and geopolitics by creating a moving and tense show about those involved in secret operations as we learn that they are just like us.”\n\n“Thanks to modern technology, Becky and I were able to have incredible conversations with Éric during the last few months, to really get to know him and to understand the creative vision he’s formulated for his next television project. We are big fans of his and, after a highly competitive bidding situation, we are honored that he is entrusting us with such an exciting project,” said Adelstein.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nCoronavirus: New U.S. Cases Near All-Time High; California, Florida and Texas See Record Spikes- Update\n\nCoronavirus: Movies That Have Halted Or Delayed Production Amid Outbreak\n\nHong Kong Filmart Postponed Due To Coronavirus Fears; Event Moves Two Weeks Before Toronto"
