        "text": "Pierre Langlais: Why did you choose the spy genre?\n\nHugo Blick: A secret is a really interesting floor. “The honourable woman” is about controlling secrets. Who controls your secrets? If they do, how will you defeat it? And by defeating it, will you become a whole person? It’s also about the idea of coming home, of becoming more honest.\n\nEric Rochant: I’ve been told once that intelligence business is about trying to know what one country doesn’t want you to know; trying to find what they want, what are their goals. Intelligence is about trying to know secrets, so you have to hide yourself, to wear a mask. Intelligence officers do what we used to do when we were kids: they disguise themselves with masks, they lie, and they pretend to be someone else. Also, when somebody lies, it creates fiction, because it creates a lot of troubles. Lying is like cheating, seducing… all these behaviors are very interesting for fiction. It can create passion or pain. When I hear your pain, I hear a good story! I think that’s why the spy genre is a good one, even if I prefer saying that I’m making a show about intelligence business. It’s like a thriller, it tells a story about people who take risks. They have death instinct, and that is why it is so strong. But, on the opposite of a thriller, you speak about the world as it is. It is not personal affairs, but stories about the whole world.\n\nPierre Langlais: Hugo Blick, do you share this vision of the spy, the intelligence or the thriller, as a tool and not as a genre?\n\nHugo Blick: Yes, I think a genre would be the vehicle. I’m not particularly interested in spies. I am interested in people who are lying to themselves. The audience wants to find out: which one is he? And that’s why it’s interesting, because you can’t find him. In “The Honourable Woman”, you do find her and who she is, but actually what you find is broken. I guess I’m more interested in the interior space than I am in the external. The only thing that I’m really interested in is finding out what she thinks, what he thinks, why they think like this.\n\nPierre Langlais: There is a common reflection but different angles between you two. In the Bureau des légendes, Eric Rochant, your main character has several names. Do you share what Hugo says, that he’s also lying to himself? Is Malotru clear about who he is?\n\nEric Rochant: I always say to my actors: “When you act, you have to lie to yourself, you have to pretend that you are somebody else, but you have to feel it”. It is a very complicated process, because you have to be somebody else being yourself. If you’re not yourself, you don’t act well. The best way to lie is to be sincere, to believe in what you say, what you feel; that’s why sometimes he hides the truth with the truth. Suddenly, it’s like a collapse, and I think being an actor is a very dangerous job, because you don’t know where you are. When I go off the set I know when somebody acts well, because the actor doesn’t really know what he has done, and he can’t do it again.\n\nHugo Blick: Someone once told me that to be a good spy, you mustn’t lose yourself. For example, your mother is not Margaret anymore; she’s Maxim, or something that is not that far from reality. The lie needs to be close to yourself, just off the line from yourself because if you go too far, you won’t cover it. When I work with actors, I’m interested in taking everything away. My relationship with an actor usually begins by going to his house and meeting him. I want the actors just to be themselves. I’m not looking for them to be anybody but who they are. The more they become who they are, the more transparent they strangely become, and the more their character lives through. If they reach too far off the branch of their own identities, the lies in the performance can be seen. So I say to them: “Don’t do anything else than be you.”\n\nEric Rochant: The first thing I say is “Don’t act, don’t play. You are not on the screen. You have to think. If you have the desire of your own text, you will say it, no matter how you will say it.”\n\nPierre Langlais: Are you “liars” as storytellers, or do you stay yourself? Is your point of view reflect or create a reality?\n\nHugo Blick: You have to believe in your project. This baby needs to be in the world, because it hasn’t been seen before. For me, there are only two parts of the production process: one is the final line of the final episode, the final part of the story. Then, two years after, I have another version of the final part of the story, and I can say “that’s better”. Thanks to that, it feels authentic, not like a documentary, but because it’s the expression that I was hoping and attending to explore and deliver, and therefore allow to be interpreted by everybody who will watch it. And that is harmony; it’s like a singularity. You’ve got to believe in that purpose, and never lie to yourself.\n\nEric Rochant: I think I’m a liar, because I’m trying to be as realistic as possible. I want my story to take place in the real world, because I think that in the real world, people will believe in my story. This is the best way to lie: being realistic. Your personality is in your lies. You can’t hide. If you want to write, you have to be exposed, you have to be yourself, to show yourself without any modesty. When you’re an author, it’s complicated to write with your own body, your own soul, because you have to reveal something. I really don’t like writing, it’s a nightmare, it’s painful, you are in front of yourself and you are facing your own capacity. Anyway, if I don’t do it, it will be fake.\n\nHugo Blick: I write because I’m angry. I lie to be better in my stories, because I want people to behave better. I want them to do something that matters. Even if I’m always looking to stop writing! But I can’t help it, I’m too angry. Once, I went to a therapist, and it was all about me, my anger. After the six sessions of therapy, I’ve got a postcard from the therapist saying “I really think you should come back”; but creating series is like going to the shrink.\n\nEric Rochant: If you go to the shrink, you cannot create!\n\nPierre Langlais: Let’s talk about the ethnicity of the material you’re working with.\n\nEric Rochant: I came to spy stories reading John le Carré. What I find fascinating is that he could write ten pages of a scene with ten different people around the table, speaking about whatever matters. It was very tense, because they were different. They speak about technical matters, but in reality it is about power struggles. When I like the scene I wrote, I can direct it, and I really feel that I’m inside. I feel inside the real room, the real office, and I watch them speaking about the world. When I feel it’s like in real life, I can tell myself “it’s ok”.\n\nHugo Blick: I don’t think the office itself is interesting. I don’t make realistic drama, I think I’m trying to make truthful drama. So the scenes are a little bit more poetic than realistic. I put the camera just to see the best psychological change.\n\nPierre Langlais: In that kind of genre, can you be totally unrealistic? Where do you both stand on the realistic scale?\n\nEric Rochant: I think we are both looking for poetry, even if there are many different ways to be poetic. We want to speak about the world.\n\nPierre Langlais: Love is the thing that is going to disrupt the machine. “The Honourable Woman” isn’t only about geopolitics; there is a very intimate story. Is that how you put some flesh in your stories?\n\nHugo Blick: “The Honourable Woman” is entirely linked to one woman’s journey. In the next project, “Black Earth Rising”, it wasn’t just intimate. I think “The Honourable Woman” taught me that secrets own you, but you don’t own them. After this miniseries, I wanted to explore the societal, cultural level. “Black Earth Rising” tells a story in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide from one woman’s perspective. It was extremely difficult to deliver, because it went into a world where things aren’t settled.\n\nEric Rochant: What interested me is that you have some things bigger than you. You speak about the sense of your life: what should I do with my life? Maybe I have to do something for my world? It is about collective calls and intimate calls. Very often, you don’t know what your life should be. Sometimes you think you’re useless. Therefore, you are ready to die for collective causes. That’s what interested me.\n\nHugo Blick: The opposite of love is hate. The bad guys motivate the nuance of love and hate, and that is interesting to explore. It is almost impossible to recognize evil when you use it without cause. But in finding cause you find nuance, and you find reason, justification, understanding. That is why this kind of genre is extremely interesting. I think writing is about exploring those two nuances, between love and hate as extremes. When you hate, how do you understand it? To understand it is to possess it.\n\nPierre Langlais: How do you deal with the reality of geopolitical tensions? What responsibility do you have towards history? How do you deal with the political matters you inject in your stories?\n\nHugo Blick: It’s difficult. With “Black Earth Rising”, it was six months of footfall, research… you don’t know your destination. I didn’t know where my destination would end. Instead, I followed the thread, and the thread led me to the conclusion of “Black Earth Rising”. In a way, this miniseries, specifically, was a story that led me. I had to rewind it, the drama was necessary, because many of the issues that I’ve explored within the story have yet to be resolved, and the resolution was the purpose of the tale. I took a historical perspective and in order to find a resolution direction, I used fiction.\n\nThere is a responsibility to understand the scene, and there is a liberty to explore the scene and push it towards a resolution that allows fiction and drama.\n\nEric Rochant: Intelligence services in democratic countries have one job: telling the government about the world as it is. They have to be lucid. They have to respect the complexity of the world, and it’s not so easy. They have to deal with its complexity. It’s painful, sometimes it’s even tragic, and that’s why it’s so fascinating. I always do that in the Bureau des légendes: people facing dilemmas. We have a lot of stories to tell, because this is so complex!\n\nHugo Blick: I try to find human truth. In the spy world, they have to believe in their country, more than they believe in truth. Truth is their country’s truth, not their individual truth.\n\nEric Rochant: There is a struggle between those two truths. We are spies like them, because we have these kind of struggle, we have to deal with two opposite sides.\n\nPierre Langlais: What is your relationship with creative control?\n\nHugo Blick: I made miniseries so I make one story at a time. The one thing I know is when I find the last line, I finished the series. I communicate my vision to every department, and if we share the same vision of the last line, I let them go. If I’m working with a designer, I won’t see what he designs. I trust him to interpret the vision by himself.\n\nEric Rochant: I don’t make miniseries, and that is the difference. Season after season, you always tell the same story. If you’re lucky, you will go deeper and cut the piece of reality, of life. That’s the specificity of the series; there is no end. Every year you produce, you write… it’s a nightmare! You know exactly that you will do it again the next year. When will I stop? Can I stop? I have to give a season a year; that is why I have to be with a team of directors, of writers. I have to work with a team, so that I can delegate everything. I try to keep the unity’s point of view. That is the show-runner’s job.\n\nHugo Blick: You’ve got to have courage in the morning and go for the things you need to worry about.\n\nEric Rochant: If I can give one tip, it would be this one: the first three days of the shooting will be lost. It’s the first days with the actors, the team… thus, organize yourself to do it again at the end.\n\nHugo Blick: Maggie Gyllenhaal did a particular scene on day three of “The Honourable Woman’s set. She was crying her eyes out, and I thought, “that’s interesting, I’ve never imagined the scene like that”. But she told me that she actually didn’t know what she was doing! I think it’s true that the first three days are weird, but they might be great on camera.\n\nPierre Langlais: Eric, are your stories based on real facts, did you talk with real spies?\n\nEric Rochant: Spies won’t tell us anything and thank god, they can keep a secret. We don’t ask them anything. We find anything we want on the Internet, also on the technical things like hacking a phone. Then, you just have to imagine the things you can’t find.\n\nPierre Langlais: How do you manage the real dramas in your themes, like Syria, hacking in Russia, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Do you have some red lines?\n\nEric Rochant: We have rules of writing. The red lines are ethical, there’s an ethic of writing: don’t be cheap with the emotions, with people’s suffering. We are very careful with terrorism, because it is easy to use it just to create emotions.\n\nHugo Blick: I don’t have many red lines. You’re going to leave a mark when you’re writing and you just have to deal with it. Be honest with yourself, step forward.\n\nPierre Langlais: How important is the editing after the story, does it change the narrative of the story? Are you involved in the editing?"
