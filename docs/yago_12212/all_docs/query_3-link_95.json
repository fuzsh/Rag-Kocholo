        "text": "In TV, there is the delight of discovery (I May Destroy You! Floor Is Lava!) and then there is the long game—that show that you’re still watching, many seasons after the buzz has died down. Long-game shows don’t get you much traction at cocktail parties (remember those?) but they’re where your heart lies—in quarantine most of all. My favorite long-game show is The Bureau, the intricate French espionage drama I began back in 2016 when it first appeared in the U.S. Even then, there wasn’t much buzz around its debut—a passing review in The New York Times clued me into its existence. But after a season, I was irretrievably hooked by the show’s Le Carré–level of complexity and its slow-burn suspense. The Bureau combines the pleasures of a workplace drama, set at the French spy service the DGSE, with the beats of a globe-hopping suspense thriller as it follows spies on missions to places like Iraq, Algeria, Russia, and Cambodia.\n\nFive seasons! It’s an investment, especially for a show that almost no one I know is watching. (The Bureau is huge in France; in French airports I have seen the show’s handsome star, Mathieu Kassovitz, lovingly photographed in Gala and Voici.) But this week and next offers a lavish payoff for a loyalist like me: The final episodes of the fifth season, which appear on Sundance Now on successive Thursdays, are nothing less than Event TV. After years of steering the show, its creator Éric Rochant turned these episodes of The Bureau over to celebrated French director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet, Rust & Bone, Dheepan) and reportedly gave him free creative rein. It’s a bit like Terrence Malick taking over The Good Fight: Audiard transforms The Bureau from a lean-and-mean spy drama into a kind of impressionistic art film. It’s dazzling.\n\nBe advised: Little in the two Audiard episodes will make sense if you’re new to The Bureau. And you probably are. So, please start all the way back with Season One, where we meet a master spy codenamed Malotru (Kassovitz’s performance mixes brooding vulnerability with leading-man steel), who has fallen in love with a Syrian professor named Nadia while on assignment in Damascus. Sex and seduction are routine elements of spycraft, but Malotru’s feelings are real and they scramble his loyalties and lead him into perilous collaborations with the CIA and eventually Russia. The B and C plots in The Bureau’s early seasons are just as satisfying: DGSE recruit Marina Loiseau (Sara Giraudeau) goes from graduate student to a French double infiltrating Mossad; Raymond Sisteron (Jonathan Zaccaï) is horrifically injured by jihadists and remains the DGSE’s unlikely lothario nonetheless.\n\nLate summer is the time for a binge, so if you get busy on Sundance Now (which streams all episodes of The Bureau) it won’t be long before you’re up to date. The first of the two-part Audiard finale begins Thursday. I previewed both episodes over the weekend and was rapt by the auteurist leap the director takes—just the way Audiard lights The Bureau’s characters gives them hidden depths—and by the risks in storytelling. The finale was controversial in France for its dramatic plot decisions and impressionistic set pieces (dream sequences, et cetera). To me this was the best two hours of TV I have seen in some time—and reconfirmed the pleasures of the long game. How long till Bureau season six?"
