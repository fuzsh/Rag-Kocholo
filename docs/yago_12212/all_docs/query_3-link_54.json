Diaz of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios; David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin and Bob Yari of 101 Studios; George Clooney and Grant Heslov for Smokehouse Pictures; Alex Berger for The Originals Productions and Ashley Stern and Pascal Breton for Federation Studios/Federation Entertainment of America.\n\nJez and John-Henry Butterworth will serve as writers and executive producers; Joe Wright will executive produce and serve as director for the first two episodes.\n\nThe critically-acclaimed Le Bureau centres on the daily life and missions of agents within France’s principal external security service, particularly the ‘Bureau of Legends’, responsible for training and handling deep-cover agents on long-term missions in areas with French interests.\n\nLe Bureau was created by Eric Rochant and is a CANAL+ Creation Originale series produced by TOP – The Originals Productions (Alex Berger, Eric Rochant) and Federation Studios (Pascal Breton).\n\n“Joe Wright is a visionary director with a gift of focusing on intricate details to craft immersive and visually striking stories,” said Chris McCarthy, President/CEO Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. “And, Jez and John-Henry are masterful writers whose witty and emotionally charged language dives deep into their characters’ moral complexities, while simultaneously creating a propulsive narrative.\n\n“Bringing these powerhouse creatives together alongside George Clooney and Grant Heslov is sure to give The Bureau the reinvention it deserves.”"
