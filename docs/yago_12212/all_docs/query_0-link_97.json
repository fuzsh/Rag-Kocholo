Excellent state of conservation for the oldest objects.MintMay have hung in a theater. If the item is rolled, it may have tiny holes in the corner borders and very slight edge wear. If it is folded, it could also have slight creases on the fold lines.Near MintMay have hung in a theater. If the item is rolled, it may have more than one hole in each border corner. It may also have minor edge wear and slight creasing. If the item is folded, it could also have slight separation along a fold line(s) and slightly more creasing.Very GoodMore than likely hung in a theater. There will be edge wear and it should have small tears or holes on the border that will not affect the artwork. Each tear should measure no more than one inch. Tiny pieces of border may be torn or missing. The item could have minor fading or condensation wrinkles. There could be some tape marks. If the item is folded, it could have separations in some places along the fold lines.FairWill have hung in a theater. This item will potentially share all the same characteristics as an item in good condition. There could be larger tears and holes. There may also some bleed through, stains or other defects that could affect the poster's artwork. With restoration these items can be restored to their original shape before framing."
