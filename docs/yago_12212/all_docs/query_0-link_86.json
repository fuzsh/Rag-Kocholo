        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, CA – Tomorrow Studios, a partnership between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios, has successfully landed the first television project since The Bureau from acclaimed French producer Éric Rochant. For his U.S. television debut, Rochant will serve as showrunner and executive producer, alongside Adelstein and Becky Clements of Tomorrow Studios (Snowpiercer, Cowboy Bebop).\n\nThis project continues the substantial growth of Tomorrow Studios, after recently announcing a series order of 10-Year-Old-Tom through Work Friends, its newly formed animation studio with Nick Weidenfeld. The studio is also generating tremendous buzz with Snowpiercer - the #1 new cable entertainment series that has reached over 25 million viewers to date for TNT (streaming on Netflix outside of the U.S and China). Other forthcoming series include the highly anticipated television adaptations of the hugely popular anime series Cowboy Bebop and One Piece for Netflix, and Physical for Apple+.\n\n“Thanks to modern technology, Becky and I were able to have incredible conversations with Éric during the last few months, to really get to know him and to understand the creative vision he’s formulated for his next television project. We are big fans of his and, after a highly competitive bidding situation, we are honored that he is entrusting us with such an exciting project,” said Adelstein.\n\nThe series (title TBD) centers on the lives of intelligence officers from different countries (USA, China, Russia, UK and France) who are involved in missions that make them meet, fight or manipulate each other. They are allies or enemies in the field and in cyberspace. It's the great, big carousel of intelligence from the world's secret layer.\n\n“I’m really excited to start this new journey with Becky and Marty at Tomorrow Studio,” said Rochant, adding, “I felt so flattered that they wanted me to do my next show with them and I appreciated them asking for me to continue being myself, because they really enjoyed The Bureau. With them I will examine our contemporary world of intelligence and geopolitics by creating a moving and tense show about those involved in secret operations as we learn that they are just like us.”\n\nRochant has been creator, director and showrunner of the critically acclaimed French series Le Bureau des Légendes (The Bureau) since 2013 with producer Alex Berger, the CEO of their production company TOP the Oligarchs Productions. A graduate of IDHEC (former name of FEMIS), Rochant previously was a writer-director on Canal+ series Mafiosa. He also wrote and directed features Möbius , The Patriots and Love Without Pity, among other credits. He won the César Award for best first work for his 1989 film Love Without Pity and was nominated for the Palme d’or for his 1994 film The Patriots.\n\nThe deal was brokered by Tom Lane, Executive Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs at ITV Studios America for Tomorrow Studios and by Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Jackoway Austen for Rochant. ITV Studios will distribute the series internationally."
