        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Director , Screenwriter , Actor more\n\nNationality French\n\nBirth February 24, 1961 (Paris – France)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAfter studying philosophy, Eric Rochant joined, at the age of 19, Idhec (former name of FEMIS), a prestigious film school on whose benches a bond was formed with future filmmakers such as Pascale Ferran , Eric Barbier and Arnaud Desplechin . The latter also served as cinematographer on some of the short films that Rochant shot from 1984. He obtained a certain visibility with Présence feminine in 1987, which won a César.\n\nIn 1989, Eric Rochant moved to a feature film with Un Monde Sans Pity , the funny and touching portrait of a disenchanted youth, which delighted critics and the public. A whole generation recognizes itself in the daily life of Hippo ( Hippolyte Girardot ), a lazy and disillusioned boy in love with the brilliant Nathalie ( Mireille Perrier ). Louis-Delluc Prize, Critics’ Prize in Venice, César for Best First Work, the film is a huge success and it marks the debut of actor Yvan Attal , rewarded with the César for Most Promising Actor.\n\nEric Rochant once again trusted Attal to play the heroes of his next two films, firstly In the Eyes of the World in 1991, the story, inspired by a news item, of a young man who, through romanticism, diverts a school bus, then, in 1994, Les Patriotes , an ambitious dive into the world of the Israeli secret services, presented in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. If the screening was a success, the critics did not share the enthusiasm of the spectators and the film was a failure upon its release.\n\nThe filmmaker then tried different genres: the dreamlike tale with Anna Oz (1996), the civic comedy with Vive la République! (1997), the offbeat thriller with Total Western (2000). But he struggles to find his way back to success. After a long eclipse, in 2006 he signed L’Ecole pour tous , an amused and warm portrait of a dunce who became a teacher in spite of himself in a suburban college, played by Arié Elmaleh .\n\nRochant then moved away from film sets for a time and directed numerous episodes of the second and third seasons of the series Mafiosa . This stint on television made him want to return to cinema again and that’s what he did with Möbius (2013), where Jean Dujardin and Cécile de France try to love each other against the backdrop of a spy story, alongside by Tim Roth and Emilie Dequenne ."
