JJA feels very strongly that The Bureau is due for a big shake-up: believing it had been under Malotru's influence for far too long. The Bureau nevertheless goes ahead and launches two large-scale operations: one to infiltrate Russian hackers in Moscow, the other to track French jihadists across the Middle East. Both missions push the Bureau agents to their limit, and up against the unavoidable shadow of Malotru.\"--, Container"
