        "text": "The title of this French show (on Sundance Now), created by Eric Rochant, refers to the bureau des légendes—a fictional undercover operation run by France’s foreign-intelligence service, the D.G.S.E. Guillaume Debailly, an agent with the code name Malotru (Mathieu Kassovitz), has just returned home from a mission to Syria, where he lived as a French teacher named Paul Lefebvre, gathering information under the eye of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. But Guillaume discovers that it’s not so easy to break character, especially once his lover from Damascus, the historian Nadia El Mansour (Zineb Triki), arrives in Paris to attend secret talks between the Syrian government and the opposition. At great cost to his colleagues, and to his country, Guillaume clings to the fiction of being Paul—though who’s to say at what point a role, played with total conviction, crosses over and becomes the truth? Following in the tradition of John le Carré, “The Bureau” succeeds both as an exemplary spy drama and as a critique of the same: it detonates the genre from within. (Reviewed in our issue of 2/8/21.)"
