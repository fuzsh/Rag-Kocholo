        "text": "The Bureau (French Spy Thriller) review\n\nAuthor Jeremy Duns shares his thoughts on the highly acclaimed French Spy Thriller TV series The Bureau.\n\n‘The Bureau (original title: Le Bureau des légendes) is a French political thriller television series created by Éric Rochant and produced by Canal+, which revolves around the lives of agents of the DGSE (General Directorate of External Security), France's principal external security service. Originally aired in France from 27 April 2015, it was first launched in the US and Canada on iTunes on 1 June 2016 as part of a new international “Episodic Cinema” label, quickly reaching the Top Five.[1][2] In the United Kingdom, the series was released exclusively by Amazon Prime on 17 June 2016.[3][4]\n\nThe first season received positive reviews in both France and other countries, and won several awards. The second season has been universally acclaimed, and has even been seen by some as the best television ever produced in France.[5] The show was renewed for a third season and it began airing in France on 22 May 2017.'
