Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari, Edge of Tomorrow) are writing all ten episodes of the adaptation.\n\nThe Department is being produced by Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios. Executive producers are the Butterworths; George Clooney and Grant Heslov for Smokehouse Pictures; and David C. Glasser for 101 Studios. Production s slated to begin later this year. It will debut on Paramount+ for subscribers with the Paramount+ with Showtime plan later this year.\n\nLe Bureau was created by Eric Rochant and is a CANAL+ Creation Originale series produced by TOP and Federation Studios.\n\n“Joe Wright is a visionary director with a gift of focusing on intricate details to craft immersive and visually striking stories,” said Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. “And Jez and John-Henry are masterful writers whose witty and emotionally charged language dives deep into their characters’ moral complexities, while simultaneously creating a propulsive narrative. Bringing these powerhouse creatives together alongside George Clooney and Grant Heslov is sure to give The Bureau the reinvention it deserves.”"
