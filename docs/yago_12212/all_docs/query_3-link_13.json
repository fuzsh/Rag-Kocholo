Dispatched to key locations all around the world and living under false identities for years, their mission is to identify potential sources.\n\nThe series begins with the return to the DGSE headquarters of our hero, after a six-year mission in Syria.\n\nBut his return to “normal” life is proving difficult especially when he is informed that Nadia, a woman he was madly in love with in Damascus is actually in Paris. For love, he is willing to take risks…for him and the Bureau."
