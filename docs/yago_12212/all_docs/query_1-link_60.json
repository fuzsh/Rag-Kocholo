        "text": "It has just been announced that French director Jacques Audiard (The Sisters Brothers, The Beat My Heart Skipped) will direct a few of The Bureau episodes for the new season. Audiard is a multi-award-winning director having received the Palme d’Or and the Grand Prix at the Cannes Festival in 2015 for his film Dheepan and in 2009 for A Prophet. He has also won several awards for his films at the César ceremony (the equivalent to the Oscars in France). This will be his first time at directing a TV series. According to Canal Plus, Audiard will direct the last two episodes of the upcoming fifth season of The Bureau.\n\nThis gives me an opportunity to write about one of my favorite series at the moment. The Bureau (Le Bureau des légendes) is an award-winning French series created by Eric Rochant (Moebius) and starring Mathieu Kassovitz (La Haine, Amelie) amongst an amazing choice of actors, such as Sara Giraudeau, Florence Loiret-Caille, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Léa Drucker and in the fourth season Mathieu Almaric, to name only a few. Four seasons, each with ten episodes, have now been aired and the fifth season is now being filmed.\n\nThe Bureau begins with an agent of the DGSE (Direction générale de la Sécurité extérieure which is France’s external intelligence agency, the equivalent to the CIA in the U.S. and MI6 in the U.K.) returning to Paris after six years undercover in Damascus, Syria. Guillaume Debailly, codename “Malotru,” played by Mathieu Kassovitz, has difficulties returning to his “normal life” and in reconnecting with his daughter, his colleagues and his old self. He decides to contact Nadia, his lover in Damascus, when she tells him that she too is in Paris. He meets her. From there springs Debailly’s fundamental error, which leads him into a situation he no longer has any control over. To protect her and himself, he is forced to become a double agent. The series shows how Debailly’s actions reverberate throughout the DGSE and its missions as he incessantly tries to fix his initial mistake which only leads him further down the rabbit hole.\n\nSeason after season, the series is intensely gripping and this is largely due to the brilliant writing. The Bureau is based on real accounts by former spies. Eric Rochant and his team of writers spent exclusive time with the DGSE to learn how the agency works. The series shows in a very effective way how espionage is a game of linguistics. No one ever says what they mean literally, everything is inferred, implied or completely unsaid. How a single word is used has its importance. For example, when the DGSE try to buy back one of their agents from the Algerians in season one, Debailly talks about a scooter he would like back, the missing agent is never mentioned. It is about knowing how to lie and who to lie to. Every message has a double, if not a triple, meaning. The series shows how the agency spends its time decoding these signs.\n\nThe style of the series is not too distant from Audiard’s cinematic world, where the image is raw and realistic enhancing the actors’ performances. This is where the series’ strength lies. The casting for this series is really on point. Kassovitz is brilliant as Debailly. Jean-Pierre Darroussin is amazing as Henri Duflot the director of the unit for spies within the DGSE, who wears different types of colorful and playful ties. Sara Giraudeau is equally brilliant as the newly-recruited spy. The fifth season is said to be the final season of the series and will have a new addition to its cast, Louis Garrel. I am impatient to see what Audiard will make of the last two episodes of this series. Audiard has also already directed Kassovitz before, as the latter starred in Audiard’s film, A Self-made Hero.\n\nThis is one of the most intelligent, gripping and brilliantly written and directed series at the moment about espionage with some amazing performances. The Bureau is available to watch in the U.S. on iTunes and in the U.K. on Amazon Prime. In France, the series has been available to watch on the encrypted channel Canal Plus. The fifth season will air on Canal Plus in 2020."
