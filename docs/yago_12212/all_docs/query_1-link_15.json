        "text": "After an almighty cliffhanger the hit spy thriller is back for a third series – and with a turncoat agent captured by ISIS, it promises to be closer to the bone than ever. But enough with spoilers…\n\nAn instant phenomenon in France, the gritty American-style espionage drama stars Mathieu Kassovitz as Malotru, an undercover agent for the French intelligence service who, returning home to Paris after a six-year mission in Damascus, grapples to relinquish his alias – and a forbidden affair with a Syrian woman. His erratic scramble to cover his tracks soon raise the suspicions his team. Tangled in an inextricable web of deception and threatened with exposure, he commits the irreparable."
