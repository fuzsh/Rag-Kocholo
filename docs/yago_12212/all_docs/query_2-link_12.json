        "text": "Imagine spending years painstakingly building and calibrating a superlative car. Then you gift the keys to someone else and tell them they are free to drive off into the sunset — or crash the car into a wall.\n\nFor Éric Rochant, that fancy roadster was the stylish, critically acclaimed French espionage series “The Bureau,” which he created and oversaw. Until the very end of his run.\n\n“When I was sure Season 5 would be my last, I decided to close it with someone else,” he explained in a recent Zoom conversation. (He’ll stay on as a producer.) For the season’s final two episodes, he gave carte blanche to the award-winning film director Jacques Audiard, a virtual newcomer to television. That included power over life-and-death decisions about the characters.\n\nIn a Zoom interview, Audiard gleefully ran with the automotive analogy. “There was a British guy named Tyrrell who built incredible Formula 1 cars,” he said. “He said you had to tune up a good one in such a way that it would win the race and collapse right afterward.”\n\nAs exit strategies go, Rochant’s took some chutzpah given the success of his creation. “The Bureau,” known in France as “Le Bureau des Légendes,” has been a commercial and critical hit since it debuted in 2015, airing currently in 112 markets. An American remake is in development at Paramount, said Rochant’s producing partner, Alex Berger, and there is talk of British, German and South Korean versions. In December, The Times’s Mike Hale ranked it third in his list of the best international TV shows of the decade.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
