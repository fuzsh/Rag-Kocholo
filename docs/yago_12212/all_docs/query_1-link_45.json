        "text": "Have an idea for Hollywood? Do you dream of writing a script? How about acting in film or TV? Or maybe even directing or producing that next big blockbuster? You can turn your vision into a market viable product, and with this book you can discover how to creatively get into the film industry on your own merits. ‚ÄúAbsolutely fantastic, very readable, insightful, honest, and from the heart. Rather than coming from a place of an authority figure on the topics, it was presented rather from someone's actual genuine and humble experiences.‚Äù ~ Gary A. Familathe, Independent Producer ‚ÄúIf you are just starting out or have been in the business for 20 years, Jonathan gives you the proper tools and a new perspective on the business of marketing yourself to studios. A book that should be part of any film majors curriculum.‚Äù ~ Ryan Crissey, CEO, Watch Us Fly Studios ‚ÄúJonathan Thompson is the go to guy of go to guys. The lessons he shares in this book can and will apply to anyone looking to break into the business. I liked the bits of humor interjected throughout, and combined with the knowledge and experience Jonathan has, gives the entire book a warm inviting feel that doesn't detract from the educational points.‚Äù ~ Rob N., Screenwriter, Author, Artist. ‚ÄúThis book is a must-have eye-opener for anyone trying to break into Hollywood! There is an entire business side to this industry that they didn‚Äôt teach me about in screenwriting courses. Avoid making some common and costly mistakes on the road to achieving your dreams by taking advantage of the years of wisdom within. Learning how EPs, Producers, Directors, and Investors operate and work together has caused me as a writer to better understand the entire process and appreciate the enormity of bringing my story to the screen. This should be required reading in every screenwriting course!‚Äù ~ Christie E. Hayman, Multi-Optioned Screenwriter Read \"Navigating Hollywood: How Writers, Actors, Directors & Producers Can Achieve More By Thinking Creatively\" today. Written by Jonathan Thompson with Rob Anspach and Produced by Anspach Media\n\nA rule here at RedShark Media is that everyone gets involved in writing, regardless of their role. Although proofreading the work of non-writers like myself is probably shaving years off of editor Andy Stout's life, the rule is a great way to keep the news and writing at the heart of what we do. So, it's my first full week in the (home) office, and alongside my core tasks, I've been writing. Really writing! (Not ChatGPT writing.) It's been refreshing! My first piece going live on the site gave me a real thrill‚Äîprobably more than it should have. It's nothing special‚Äîjust a turnaround on a press release with added context. And yet, I am absolutely buzzing! If I'm being frank, I was apprehensive about the writing rule simply because I wanted to focus on the core mission of what I've been brought in to do. But understanding the process and what goes into the writing, even for just a press release, reminded me that IS the core mission. This is what we do. Everything else I'm here working on is to serve that purpose, not the other way around. It's easy to forget the basics, but they're what everything else is built on. Now, I'm off to clear some of my kid's art off the fridge so I can hang up my article. It's Dad's turn for a gold star! üåüüòÅ https://lnkd.in/eNhtKVVA #Writing #Video #VideoProduction #VideoTech #RedShark #VideoNews\n\nIndie filmmakers should be the highest paid people on their projects. (Exceptions made for name talent, because that‚Äôs just the way that goes). But otherwise? Don‚Äôt shortchange yourself when budgeting. Here‚Äôs why: - More money gives you more time to focus, in addition to your other job(s) - Respecting your own time can increase your confidence - Paying yourself fairly well sets a precedent for how you treat others The production‚Äôs success probably starts and ends with you, right? So budget accordingly. Do I get permission to do this from my investors? Of course I do. They see the sense in it. I also don‚Äôt go crazy. I save us all a ton of money through my non-traditional choices. And this all isn‚Äôt just about the money, actually. It‚Äôs about maximizing value, in a balanced and reasonable way. Hollywood doesn‚Äôt always do well with balance and reason. So why play their game, when you don‚Äôt have to? And if you don‚Äôt value yourself, who will? Be smart about it. Own your work. Believe in your worth. Build something sustainable, for you as well as others. (Even if sometimes it feels counter-intuitive). #indiefilm #indiefilmmaking #independentfilm #independentfilmmaker #filmproducer #filmproduction #filmmaking #startupfilmmaker #screenwriting\n\nThe Importance of Being Formatted Properly (Script edition) We all remember our English teacher in primary, secondary school, and college spending months teaching us formatting for different types of papers right? The MLA, Chicago, APA, and other forms of formatting might still haunt our dreams and writing but they were and are an extremely important written form of communication. This allows people to immediately recognize what they are reading and what type of information is being shared. Scripts have the same need, they need to be formatted properly. Scripts are the framework, we all know that as filmmakers, however, if they are not formatted in a standard way it halts everything beyond that framework phase. If you have chills thinking about it, fear not formatting is built into screenwriting software such as Final Draft, Celtx, and others if you know where it is and how it helps development, pre-production, production, and eventually the final product! The screenwriting software automatically gives the margins to the screenwriter and puts them into the standard font that is expected for the scripts. 1. Margins a. top margin of 1 inch b. left margin of 1.5 inches c. right margin should be 1 inch d. this should allow for about 55 lines per page 2. Fonts: 12-point Courier font There is a fantastic article from MasterClass that gives an in-depth formatting lesson for those who may not be using screenwriting software at: https://lnkd.in/gaC8MH25 This will help anyone who needs a refresher or is looking to learn more about the formatting of screenplays into the expected industry standard formatting. Screenwriters write to see their words come to life on screen, formatting properly, helps every step of the way from the first time the script is read by an agent, manager, or producer to allowing for the team to break it down into the format needed to put all the pieces together. Once the screenplay is in the producer/line producer‚Äôs hands to be budgeted and broken into the different pieces and departments a properly formatted screenplay saves days of work for them, which in turn means that schedules, budgets, materials, departments, etc can be accounted for and allows the project to move a step forward. Formatting may give people nightmares, but as any foundation has taught us, it is vital to creating success and saving real nightmares from happening later or vital information getting lost in translation."
