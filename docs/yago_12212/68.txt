For the director: a key figure in the spy film genre

Éric Rochant charms the critics in 1989 with his first film Un monde sans pitié (Love Without Pity), which wins him the César for best first feature film. Since making Les Patriotes (The Patriots), he continues to explore the world of espionage, which he showcases in the cinema with Möbius and on television, with Mafiosa, le clan. A master of the genre, we have him to thank for the four seasons of Le Bureau des Légendes (The Bureau), an outstanding series about the DGSE (the French external intelligence agency) and one of French television's biggest successes.

For his five-star casting

After winning the César for most promising actor for his performance in Un Monde sans pitié (Love Without Pity), Yvan Attal returns to the cinema of Eric Rochant in Les Patriotes (The Patriots). He is surrounded by a top-quality cast, including leading figures of French cinema Emmanuelle Devos and Richard Masur. Éric Rochant also introduces Sandrine Kiberlain, who will be nominated for the César for most promising actress for her first major role.
