Established in 1973, the college came into being as a result of the unwavering support and steadfast determination of those noble personalities who had the vision, dream and the commitment to set up an institution for higher education in the remotest part of Western Assam. Named after the 16th Century’s greatest warrior scholar Biswa Mahabir Chilarai of Koch Dynasty the college has emerged as beacon of grass root empowerment and a potential tool of social engineering among mostly the economically challenged communities in the western region of Assam. Brought under the deficit grant-in-aid system in the year 1987 and enlisted under UGC Act of 2(f) and 12(B) in the year 2001 the college has successfully completed its 2nd cycle of NAAC Assessment and Accreditation in 2015 with Grade B .\n\nThe college was established in 1973 with a vision to make higher education accessible to the students of different underprivileged sections of the society.

Initially, some committed faculties of the college envisioned to set up the centre with a view to exploring the cultural repositories of the region embedded in oral traditions of the Rajbangsi community. Since inception, the centre has been a leading source of inspiring and motivating the faculties to pursue research on folk theatre, folk and performing arts, myth, legends and folk tales, translation studies, local language etc.\n\nThe in-house Museum of Chilarai College was founded in 2004 and at present, it houses a plethora of artefacts displaying the cultural heritage of diverse communities of Western Assam. The museum was developed by the college to showcase the vibrant and colourful cultural elements and heritage of the region. Objects preserved here can be classified under different heads: ethnographic objects and anthropological objects. Objects like bamboo crafts, musical instruments, basketry, metal objects, jewellery, textiles, masks, terracotta etc. The valuable artefacts displayed in the Museum include a few rare pieces of Koch coinage or coins of Koch dynasty, originally called “Narayani Mudra” which was introduced by Nara Narayana.
