        "text": "My name is Kanishk Shetty, a research intern in the Reserve Bank of India. Previously, I was an intern at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). I did my Bachelor's in Economics from NMIMS Mumbai and my Master’s in Economics from Mithibai College. When I was in school where my father would often tell me about the history of many countries and how some of them shaped their destiny by becoming militarily, technological and economically stronger. This made me curious to know more about the tools used by policymakers to influence development outcomes, and it drew me to Economics, which I took along with Physics, Chemistry and Math in Class 11 and 12. Then, I enrolled in BSc. Economics, NMIMS Mumbai. Here I was exposed to a wide range of perspectives. There was once phase in my UG when I was being an unfair critic of Marxian socialism without understanding the actual problem which Marx was trying to address. Some of my false notions were dispelled as I became familiar with the grim realities of inequality and that economic growth does not necessarily trickle down to the masses, though I still don’t consider myself as a supporter of Marxian thought. However, I feel some of his claims with respect to how mechanisation of production are relevant even today. I realised the necessity of a country to have stronger, fair and independent institutions that provide its basic economic foundations. I was inspired by people like Jamsetji Tata and Dhirubhai Ambani who became great not by just by accumulating wealth but by uplifting the people around them. Now, I wish to be a part of a collective initiative that seeks to bring new opportunities for all people. My interest in research was ignited when I began reading the works of different economists like Jagadish Bhagwati, Amartya Sen etc. And found out that it was only through empirical analysis and critical thinking that such brilliant minds could study the economic issues at depth and suggest remedies. During my UG years, I wrote my first paper in 2021 on Decoupling the Indian Economy from China. I constantly kept myself updated with the latest economic trends and events by reading the newspaper every morning and always reading the opinion columns. This enabled me to build up on my analytical thinking. It also enabled me to apply the concepts studied in college to understand real world economic problems. There is a vast sea of knowledge out there and while building up on my skills I seek newer insights from the realm of the unknown by reading and writing more. I believe in building a community of professional economists, professors, and students so that there is exchange of views and perspectives. Furthermore, it helps you to become familiar with many career options and research interests to further explore. Additionally, it can enable access to better resources and courses for improved knowledge and upskilling. https://lnkd.in/e_S4mjTR"
