        "text": "Sontali Anchalik College was established in the year 1987 with an aim to open up the doors of opportunities to acquire higher education in the economically and educationally backward region the Southern part of Kamrup district of Assam. By selfless and relentless efforts of some intellectual genius of Sontali Mouza of Kamrup and Baguribari Mouza of South Barpeta district, it was possible to make the dreams of thousands of people of this locality into reality and as a result the Sontali Anchalik College is now showering its light of knowledge among the community. Since its inception the college has fervidly and persistently followed its motto of creation of a sound mind in a sound body.\n\nIn this context, I would like to offer my heartfelt gratitude to those who took the pain to establish this great institution of higher education.\n\nIt give me immense pleasure to announce the beginning of the new academic session 2022-23 of Sontali Anchalik College and sincerely invite all the aspiring students to take admission in to three years degree course under CBCS system of Gauhati University.\n\nAs we all know that the NEP 2020 will be implemented from 2023 and the college is all set ready to cope with the changing scenario.\n\nIn the illuminating words of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, one can seek inspiration from the following quote – ‘We are all born with a divine fire in us. Our effort should be to give wings to this fire and fill the world with the glow of its goodness.’ [Wings of Fire]\n\nAnd it is this divine fire which has been burning bright in the brigade of the faculty of Sontali Anchalik College to strive continuously in the path of knowledge acquisition, preservation and propagation amongst students and the community as well as bolster each with wings to fire and spread the goodness of remarkable knowledge with an equal thrust towards the holistic development as well. Therefore with deep faith and belief ourselves, we are un-daunting in the path of progress of our college with invaluable co-operation, association of various communities to achieve higher and nobler goals.\n\nWith this note I again welcome all the aspiring new comers on behalf of the College family with an assurance to offer quality and value based education at Sontali Anchalik College.\n\nFrom The Principal's Desk"
