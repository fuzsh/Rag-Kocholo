He stressed on the importance of imparting holistic education that aims to bring about complete human being.\n\nThe freshers were introduced into the new academic year through a meaningful programme which gave a perfect blend of information and entertainment. This is the final year at DBCET for the first batch of B.Tech and MCA students.\n\nWelcoming the assembly, Vice Chancellor of Assam Don Bosco University Dr. StephenMavelysaid, “It is a wonderful feeling to be back, starting all over again, looking forward with hope to the year ahead, nursing big dreams while, at the same time, taking determined steps day by day to achieve them.”\n\nCommenting on the theme chosen of the academic year, “Get on board – new horizons beckon!”, he said, “It’s a phrase rich with meaning, for all of us staff and students alike. But it has a special significance for our first batch of engineering and MCA students getting ready to flap their wings and fly, dreaming of the world of work where they want to make a mark as thorough-going professionals and good human beings.”\n\n“This motto is challenging you to look beyond at the larger horizons that beckon you.” he added.\n\nThe gathering was formally welcomed by Prof Manoranjan Kalita, the Principal of Don Bosco College of Engineering and Technology. Glimpses of the past academic year, presentation of the important events and programmes of the semester, introducing of the new faculty members, prize distribution to the academic achievers, a choreography that brought out the meaning of a true Bosconian, dances and song formed the part of the function.\n\nFr. StephenMavelytook the occasion to felicitate the Chief Guest, Prof Okhil with a special medallion containing the inscription of the great educator of youth, saint, Don Bosco.\n\nDBCET Azara is also the temporary administrative office of Assam Don Bosco University with its new site at Tapesia Gardens some 16 kms off the state capital Dispur."
