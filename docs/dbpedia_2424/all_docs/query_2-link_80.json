        "text": "It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Scholar's Institute of Technology and Management (SITM), located at the Gateway of North-East, Guwahati. The Institute began functioning as a full fledged organization in July, 2011 and it is a great moment that SITM has completed three years of journey that it has undertaken to impart quality and excellent technical education to the young engineering aspirants of our country. This Institution is promoted by the Scholar's Academy Education Trust, founded on 8th May, 2008 under the Indian Trust Act, 1882.\n\nFrom the commencement of the first session till now, we have made enormous improvements and the progress is going on. Today, with sprawling college buildings, updated laboratories, a computer lab with internet facilities, well-equipped workshops, well growing library, a modern refreshment centre and to cap them all with highly qualified and experienced faculty, the college is aspiring for global recognition. Academic growth of the students is our main guiding principle. Our motto is not only to give this country some of the best engineers, but also to make them socially responsible citizens of our country.\n\nWe are always at work in unison to ensure a tremendous value addition among our students during their four years of stay with us. At the same time, we are confident that the alumni of this college will always feel proud of this institution in the days ahead.\n\nWhen parents hand over their children and their future in our hands, they also lay their trust and confidence with us and we at SITM, undertake this opportunity as our foremost responsibility to uphold their trust on us and guide and motivate their children to become one among the best engineers of our country. Our staff and faculty are always ready to extend their helping hand for solving any query and providing all inputs.\n\nI am honoured to be the Advisor of this great institution and for the response of students and staff to my vision and the progress and growth of the college has been excellent. I believe in high expectations and clear boundaries; an environment in which the student can flourish. We are working hard to provide a safe, supportive and positive learning environment in the Institute so that all the students can realize their full potential."
