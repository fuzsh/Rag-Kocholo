        "text": "A Brief History Of The College:\n\nDalgoma Anchalik College an undergraduate educational institute is one of the premier institutions of higher education in the Assam state of India. The college was established with a ceremonial inaguaration in an auspicious moment on 25th of August, 1993 in a sylvan setting of Dalgoma as a cumulative consequence of the noble initiative and painstaking efforts collectively undertaken by a host of leading personages and the general public of greater Dalgoma area the abode of both the educationally and socio-economically backward people in the western part of Assam.\n\nDalgoma Anchalik College is located attractively at mid-place of Matia and Dalgoma almost 13 kilometres to the north of Dudhnoi the Head Quarter of Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council and 28 kilometres to the east of Goalpara town. The college strives to achieve excellence in every possible human endeavour by expanding the landscape of quality education to the students of the locality, and by making them able to excel in their interests and strength to the best of their ability. The college is surrounded by a beautiful landcape of greenery with the basic amenities like revenue circle, development block office, post office, police station, banks, hospitals and road communication.\n\nA vision turned into reality for the knowledge thirsty masses of the locality Dalgoma Anchalik College is a co-educational institute affiliated permanently to Gauhati University, imparting undergraduate level of teaching in the faculty of Arts. Dalgoma Anchalik College also offers Distance Education under Institute of Distance and Open learning (IDOL), Gauhati University. The college obtained the first Government Concurrence in 1995 and the final Government Concurrence in 1998. Dalgoma Anchalik College is under the umbrella of “Assam Venture Educational Institution (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011 and Amended, 2012”, and provincialised with effect from 1st January, 2013 by the Government of Assam. It is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and under section 2(f) 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956.\n\nDalgoma Anchalik College continues to retain its glory of excellent performance since its inception as the students from a very alarming socio-economic condition and poor educational background of greater Dalgoma, its neighbourhood in Goalpara district and some char areas of Barpeta district have been showing shining results in the examinations. It has become possible only because of their own endeavour and the selfless service and untiring contribution of the diligent teachers who have dedicated themselves to light persistently the lamp of knowledge and ignite the mind of the young generation to make them innovative, self-reliant and responsive to the needs of the society. To reach this goal the college has undertaken adequate steps and made diverse facilities open for all the students so that they can hopefully achieve a healthy and harmonious blending of mind and soul and face the challenges of life quite intellectually and appropriately and become dignified and responsible citizens armed with knowledge and ability. The ready reference may be viewed easily in the scene of the higher degrees and engagement in different fields of the beloved alumni of the college. Our Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) has been upholding constant pains in this regard.\n\nWith the advancement of the 201st century, the college has been busy with its best possible endeavour to produce not the aimless degree holders but the ones poised to excel the world with clarity of vision, career and needs of the job market. On the march of progress in the world of globalisation, the college, despite many bottlenecks, is getting ahead in co-operation with various committees of the teachers, other employees, students, members of the hon’ble governing body of the college, alumni as well as the local leadership. With a view to catering to the need of higher education, honours courses (previously known as major courses) in all the six subjects were introduced in the college since its inception. The examination centre for the undergraduate level (B. A.) has been running smoothly in the college without any interruption since 1998. So far as the academic as well as the infrastructural facilities are concerned, the college has a library with a good number of books, journals, magazines, newspapers, reading room, laboratory (Education), vast playground, principal’s chamber, office room, girls hostel, boys common room, girls common room, separate departmental chambers, bicycle stand, separate toilet for both boys and girls, running water facility and so on."
