        "text": "The Department of Business Administration started functioning from July 2008 with a mission to impart quality education in a stimulating and innovative environment where students can be empowered with knowledge and professional skills that are required to be a good manager and administrator. Initially, the department offered a full-time MBA Programme under Gauhati University. However, from 2013, the department has been offering a full-time two-year Master in Business Administration (MBA) programme under the Assam Science & Technology University (ASTU). The course offers dual specialization in the areas of Finance, Human Resource, Marketing and Production.\n\nThe Department boasts of its excellent young team of Faculty members with interdisciplinary background who are drawn from the premier institutes. ‘The urge to learn and make others learn’ has been the motto of our teaching fraternity. Moreover, the Faculty represents an excellent conglomerate of industry-academia exposures. Accordingly, the latest trends in Management education are incorporated in our teaching methodology. This, however, is reflected from the fact that our first batch of MBA students has the distinction of securing top positions (1st & 3rd) in GU MBA Final Examination and getting job offers from various reputed organisations. Our subsequent batches of young managers have also come out very successfully in the University Examination and almost all of them have been placed in reputed organisations. Similarly, for the outgoing batch of 2016 also, 100% placement is expected and efforts are being put in order to achieve the same.\n\nVision\n\nTo produce leaders who possess knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to adapt to the dynamic business environment and thereby contribute towards the growth of the nation.\n\nMission"
