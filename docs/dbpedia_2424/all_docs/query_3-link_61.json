        "text": "Profile\n\nThe Centre for Studies in Philosophy is one of the latest Centres on campus and was started in July, 2009, by the Dibrugarh University. The emergence of the Centre could fulfil the demand of the students from various colleges to pursue higher studies in Philosophy at Dibrugarh University. Since then it has expanded its activities to provide philosophical foundations to acquaint students with various fields of Philosophy such as Epistemology (Indian & Western), Metaphysics (Indian & Western), Ethics, Logic, Philosophy of Religion, Social & Political Philosophy etc.\n\nThe Centre invites eminent scholars from various reputed institutions and organizes lecture programmes on a regular basis to provide an environment for the students where they can get proper exposure in different areas of Philosophy. In order to encourage the students to understand the holistic and interdisciplinary nature of Philosophy, the Centre regularly organizes a Talk programme under the Studentsâ€™ Philosophical Forum.\n\nThe Centre for Studies in Philosophy initially started offering programmes of teaching in Philosophy at M.A. level and also introduced Ph.D. programme since 2010 covering various fields of Philosophy. Though the Centre began with non-CBCS mode in M.A. level but it was converted to CBCS mode in 2016 with a number of new specialized Courses along with revamped syllabi."
