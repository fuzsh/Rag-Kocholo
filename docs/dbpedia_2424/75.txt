The very long unattended demand of the people of Assam for a higher education institution came true in the form of Gauhati University on the 26th of January 1948 and it was the only university in the entire eastern region of the city of Kolkata for a very long time.

The university meets the educational requirement of not only the people of Assam, but also the people of Assam, Orissa and Bihar as well. Initially, the university started functioning as a residential, teaching and affiliating university with some temporary buildings in Guwahati and the motto of the university is ‘achievement through learning’. The main aim of the university is to bring spiritual, moral, cultural, economic and social upliftment of the people of the state of Assam.
