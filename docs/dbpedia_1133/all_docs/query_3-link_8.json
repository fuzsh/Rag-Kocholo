        "text": "In his weekly political column, Post Opinion Editor Jim Davis discusses a looming shake-up in the Cabinet, good news for Yulia Tymoshenko, other disturbing details of the new ad law, and the latest Big Brother moves by state security.\n\nsage, most consider Economy Minister Valery Khoroshkovsky as the prime candidate to be first to walk the plank. Khoroshkovsky’s fate, if not yet a fact, was probably sealed when he spoke ill of President Leonid Kuchma’s plans to sign Ukraine up as a charter member of the new CIS Common Economic Space agreement.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Yanukovych’s Cabinet revamp is believed to be at least partially motivated by his own presidential ambitions. While he may be successful in removing from office such rising stars as Khoroshkovsky, others, such as NBU head Serhy Tyhypko and Transport Minister Heorhy Kirpa, are considered untouchable, at least by Yanukovych.\n\nA parliamentary present for a lady\n\nOct. 1, the parliament’s committee on procedures recommended to Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn that he return without any action Prosecutor General Svyatoslav Pyskun’s request that former deputy prime minister and parliamentary faction head Yulia Tymoshenko be stripped of her parliamentary immunity from prosecution. Deputies believe that the PGO will continue its attempts to put Tymoshenko on trial, but the Oct. 1 action means that it may be some time before another attempt is mounted.\n\nAn undiplomatic diplomat?\n\nSome 122 deputies on Oct. 1 endorsed an official inquiry into Russia’s Ambassador to Ukraine Viktor Chernomyrdin. They want Chernomyrdin to explain why he insists on conducting press conferences in Russian, and why he threatened a journalist from the weekly newspaper Za Vilny Ukrainu (For a Free Ukraine) for asking questions in Ukrainian during a Sept. 26 press conference. The Rada inquiry was floored by Our Ukraine deputy Ivan Stoyko, who asked Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych to report back with the answer.\n\nAd law’s ugly other side\n\nMuch of this paper’s last edition dealt with various negative aspects of the new amendments to the advertising law. However, the disastrous provisions of Article 6 are only a part of the potential damage.\n\nPoint 9 of Article 13 says: “Transmission (re-transmission) of advertisements, found in programs and broadcasts of foreign TV and radio organizations which are transmitted (re-transmitted) on the territory of Ukraine, is permitted only if transmission (re-transmission) of such advertisements is paid to a legal entity of Ukraine, irrespective of the means of such transmission.”\n\nThis particular provision would seem to be moot, since BBC World, CNN, and German, Russian and other TV outfits now entering the Ukrainian market would have no interest in translating their advertising into Ukrainian, to comply with Article 6. They would probably be even more resistant to allowing some portion of their advertising revenues to be paid to “a legal entity” in Ukraine.\n\nIt is also likely that strict enforcement of the law would result in a booming market for individual satellite dishes, since they would be much harder to bring into compliance with the various provisions.\n\nAt this point, it is also unclear how Ukraine will deal with the fact that the new amendments, particularly Article 13, are in disagreement with the European Convention on Trans-frontier TV Broadcasting, to which Ukraine became a signatory in June, 1996.\n\nGeorge Orwell, where are you?\n\nSoon Big Brother will have gotten a lot bigger in Ukraine, if the draft of the bill “On monitoring of telecommunications,” developed by the State Security Service (SBU), becomes law. Ukrainian telecommunications experts are unanimous in claiming that this bill would transform monitoring of the Ukrainian Internet into an instrument of political investigation and surveillance.\n\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on Sept. 29 ruled to continue monitoring of Ukraine. Despite the desperate undertakings of Ukrainian envoys, such as Prosecutor General Svyatoslav Pyskun and Anatoly Rakhansky, deputy head of the Ukrainian delegation to PACE, to prove that Ukraine meets EU democracy standards, the assembly was almost unanimous in passing a strong resolution. Point 10 of the resolution states: “The Assembly is concerned about attempts of the Presidential Administration to establish more rigid control over state, oligarch-managed and independent mass-media.”\n\nAs the telecommunications monitoring bill seems almost certain to pass, PACE will likely have more even grounds for concern."
