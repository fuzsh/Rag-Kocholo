IKEA WANTS IN\n\nJuggernaut multinational furniture retailer IKEA plans to hit Ukraine\n\nBy Roman Olearchyk, Kyiv Post Staff Writer\n\nKyiv Post, Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, July 15, 2004\n\nJuggernaut multinational furniture retailer IKEA plans to hit Ukraine hard\n\nin the near future, amping up local production and building the retail\n\noutlets and shopping centers it needs to sell its brand.\n\nSwedish IKEA founder and current senior consultant Ingvard Kamprad says\n\nthe company's operations in Ukraine will resemble those in Russia, where in\n\nrecent years it has pumped hundreds of millions of euros into building IKEA\n\nretail stores and the IKEA-built shopping malls - lavish consumer and\n\nentertainment complexes - that support them. The Swedish company also plans\n\nto open a third production facility in Zakarpattya oblast, where it already\n\nemploys 3,000 people at its own saw mill and furniture production plant.\n\n\"Ukraine will be a part of the European Union and it is really a big\n\ninterest of ours to develop our relationship with Ukraine,\" Kamprad said\n\nJuly 13, days after a short Ukrainian visit. During the July 7-9 visit, his\n\nfirst to Ukraine, he met with President Leonid Kuchma to discuss investment\n\nopportunities in the country.\n\n\"The shopping center alone would involve roughly 250 million euros ($308\n\nmillion) in investment,\" Kamprad added.\n\nFor nearly 10 years IKEA has operated the saw mill and a furniture plant in\n\nZakarpattya oblast, but its well-known furniture outlets and shopping\n\ncenters remain to be seen. The Dutch-registered conglomerate has not yet\n\nbuilt any such stores or entertainment complexes in Ukraine, such as those\n\nit developed in recent years in Russia, but Kamprad told the Post July 13\n\nhis company would like to open a third production facility in Zakarpattya\n\nand launch a retail business in the country soon.\n\nThe all-in-one malls IKEA is developing in Russia are comprised of IKEA\n\nstores, DIY stores, hypermarkets, retail boutiques, a food court and movie\n\ntheaters.\n\nIrena Vanenkova, a spokesperson for IKEA in Moscow, said the company has\n\nexpanded steadily in Russia since opening its first store in Moscow in March\n\n2000. The second IKEA store opened in December 2001 and was followed\n\nby a MEGA shopping mall, which opened in December 2002.\n\nIKEA, which has invested nearly $500 million in Russia since 2000, owns four\n\nstores in Russia: two in Moscow, one in St. Petersburg and one in Kazan.\n\n\"Another shopping mall will open this December and we have about 12\n\nadditional projects which we would like to develop in Russia,\" Vanenkova\n\nsaid. IKEA would like to apply the concepts used in Russia in its expansion\n\nefforts in other CIS countries, she added.\n\nThe IKEA network consists of more than 180 stores in more than 30 countries.\n\nIt posted sales of more than $9 billion last year with retail sales in\n\nEurope accounting for the majority of sales.\n\nFOREIGN RETAILERS\n\nGermany's Metro Cash & Carry, a large wholesaler that owns membership-\n\nonly hypermarkets, opened its first retail outlet in Teremky district of\n\nKyiv last year. Like IKEA, Metro is pushing forward with expansion plans\n\nthat involve more stores in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, but has faced\n\nhurdles from local retailers who feel threatened by Metro and its\n\ncompetitive price policies. Since Metro opened its first store, local\n\nretailers have lobbied Kyiv city officials, urging them to halt Metro's\n\nexpansion and not issue Metro with plots of land on which to build new\n\noutlets.\n\nIKEA's plans to develop shopping malls in the country are also expected to\n\nclash with the interests of local business groups, which have in recent\n\nyears built shopping malls throughout the country.\n\nThe arrival of IKEA's retail furniture outlets could also pose stiff\n\ncompetition for a handful of Ukrainian furniture retailers, such as current\n\nmarket leader Merx-Mebli, majority owned by the former Economy Minster\n\nValery Khoroshkovsky. Merx-Mebli is just part of Khoroshkovsky's business\n\nempire, which includes Ukrsotsbank, one of Ukraine's top five banks in\n\nnetwork size and assets.\n\nOfficials at Merx-Mebli would not reveal their company's fiscal status, but\n\nthey did say the company has more than 35 furniture stores throughout\n\nUkraine. Director of Merx Mebli Yury Zboyev says IKEA will be a big,\n\nbut not feared competitor.\n\n\"We're happy that IKEA is entering our market, as they will help bring more\n\ncompetition to the market - competition needed to help [the market]\n\ndevelop,\" he said. Zboyev cited IKEA's low furniture prices as an added\n\noption for Ukrainian consumers. \"They will immediately affect the segment of\n\nthe market that is looking for less expensive furniture, but those looking\n\nfor high quality furniture will remain loyal to our company,\" Zboyev\n\ninsisted.\n\nKamprad said he was well aware of the hurdles IKEA could face in Ukraine,\n\nthough he remains impressed with how economically developed the country is.\n\n\"I had a very good meeting with Kuchma,\" Kamprad said. \"I think we will get\n\nall the information and support we need. \"Of course it's a long road and\n\nthere are many problems in the country, but a lot of investment is needed,\"\n\nhe said, adding, \"I was delighted with everything I saw.\" (END) (ARTUIS)\n\n=======================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No. 117: ARTICLE NUMBER FOUR\n\nHelp Distribute The Action Ukraine Report Around The World\n\n=======================================================\n\n4.

The funds will also be used to construct a\n\ntoll-free alternative road.\n\n\"The Ministry received the Hr 2.5 billion ($480 million) loan on July 8. The\n\nmoney has already been transferred,\" Interfax-Ukraine quoted Transportation\n\nMinister Heorhy Kirpa as saying on July 12. Construction of the highway,\n\nwhich has been stalled for months due to lack of funds, was resumed July 12.\n\n\"About Hr 1.35 billion has been spent by the Ministry on the construction\n\nproject, but [before the Deutsche Bank loan] we had only been reimbursed Hr\n\n920 million. This led to a delay in construction,\" Kirpa said.\n\nWhen the four- to six-lane highway is complete, it will operate under a toll\n\nsystem. Revenues generated through toll payments will go toward repaying the\n\nDeutsche Bank loan. Cars and trucks will be charged Hr 0.12 and Hr 0.31 per\n\nkilometer, respectively, to travel along the 454-kilometer route between\n\nKyiv and Odessa.

VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO SURE BAN ON SALE OF UKRAINIAN\n\nLAND WILL BE PROLONGED DESPITE PRESIDENTIAL VETO\n\nUNIAN news agency, Kiev, Ukraine, in Ukrainian, 14 Jul 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, in English, UK, Wednesday, Jul 14, 2004\n\nKIEV - Viktor Yushchenko, the leader of the Our Ukraine bloc, is sure that\n\nthe presidential veto placed on the law which prolongs the moratorium on the\n\nbuying and selling of land will be defeated.\n\nYushchenko's press service reports that commenting on the presidential veto\n\nagainst introducing changes to the Land Code, Yushchenko stressed that if\n\nthe moratorium on selling land is not prolonged, \"we will once again make\n\nthe same mistake as was made with voucher privatization when several\n\nfamilies bought up everything for a pittance. We will definitely defeat the\n\nveto. Land should belong to people who work on the land and not to two or\n\nthree latifundists\".\n\nYushchenko is convinced that in the future land should, without any doubt,\n\nbecome a commodity, as this is general world practice. However, he said that\n\n\"under the current authorities the moratorium cannot be suspended\" and that\n\n\"today, the privatization of land is one of the biggest points of\n\nspeculation of the authorities.\n\nEveryone who is connected to the land and who works on it, in accordance\n\nwith Ukrainian legislation, should be a landowner. However, a land market\n\nhas not been formed in Ukraine yet, and if privatization were to be allowed\n\nin this sector, then tomorrow we shall have several plantation owners who\n\nwill simply buy up all he land for a pittance.\"\n\nYushchenko also stressed that Ukrainian peasants should be real landowners\n\nonly when they have a state document stipulating this. [Passage omitted:\n\nreiterates need for such documents]\n\nOn 17 June, the Ukrainian Supreme Council [parliament] adopted amendments\n\nto the Land Code which envisage that the owners of land plots do not have\n\nthe right to sell them before 1 January 2007, but can only exchange or\n\nbequeath them.

THERE'S NO APPARENT REASON FOR UKRAINE TO REVERSE\n\nPOLICY ON OIL PIPELINE, SAYS U.S. AMBASSADOR JOHN HERBST\n\nBy Anna Melnichuk, Associated Press, Kiev, Ukraine, Thur, July 15, 2004\n\nKIEV, Ukraine - U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst on Wednesday\n\nquestioned the Ukrainian Cabinet's decision to open a never-used pipeline\n\nfor shipments of Russian oil, instead of pumping European-bound shipments\n\nfrom the Caspian Sea region.\n\n\"Shipment of oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe would be a great step toward\n\nUkraine's independence in the energy sector,\" Herbst said in Russian during\n\na telephone conference with readers of the Fakty daily newspaper. The U.S.\n\nEmbassy press office confirmed the quotes. \"There is no apparent reason to\n\nreverse the flow,\" he said.\n\nUkraine's government in February approved the use of its prized US$500\n\nmillion pipeline to move oil from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to western\n\nEuropean markets instead of running Russian crude in the opposite direction.\n\nBut the government reversed itself last week.\n\nThe February decision had been seen as a victory for Washington, which\n\nstaunchly opposed reversing the flow, warning it would increase this former\n\nSoviet republic's dependence on Moscow and the chances of a major oil spill\n\nin Turkey's already clogged Bosporus Strait. Sending the oil westward would\n\nalso benefit Caspian Sea suppliers, such as the American oil behemoth\n\nChevronTexaco which controls one of the world's largest oil deposits in\n\nKazakhstan.\n\nHerbst urged Ukraine's government to explain why they reversed their\n\ndecision so that \"Ukrainian people can see the reasons for taking such a\n\ndecision.\"\n\nThe Cabinet has said the reversal is temporary, blaming it on technical\n\nproblems involved in pumping crude to Poland and Germany. Ukraine also\n\nplans to extend the existing pipeline from Brody to the Polish town of\n\nPlotsk, a move which would enable the flow of oil to European customers.\n\nLast week Ukraine's state-owned pipeline operator Ukrtransnafta launched\n\nan initiative aimed at creating a joint venture with the Poland's Przyjazn\n\noil company to complete the 300-mile extension for the estimated cost\n\nof some $500 million.\n\nUkraine built the 413-mile long Odessa-Brody pipeline in 2001, but it has\n\nremained idle due to bickering between exporters of Russian and Caspian oil.\n\nOil companies from Russia's Ural Mountains plan to use the pipeline to pump\n\ntheir lower-grade oil from the Ukraine's western terminal in Brody to the\n\nBlack Sea port of Odessa.

UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER REJECTS EUROPEAN UNION\n\nCONCERN ABOUT DANUBE RIVER CANAL CONSTRUCTION\n\nUNIAN news agency, Kiev, in Ukrainian, 15 Jul 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, Thursday, Jul 15, 2004\n\nKIEV - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Hryshchenko has said that the\n\nconstruction of the Danube-Black Sea canal will have no adverse impact on\n\nthe environmental situation in the region. Hryshchenko said this at a news\n\nconference, commenting on the EU's warning Ukraine about the need to halt\n\nthe construction of the canal until a final environmental expert conclusion.\n\n\"This is not about constructing a canal but about resuming the functioning\n\nof something which has long been in existence. Therefore, there can be no\n\ntalk at all that the environmental situation in the Danube delta has been\n\nchanging,\" he said.\n\nHryshchenko noted that the Ukrainian side provided the EU with all\n\nexplanations from the outset of the canal's restoration. During his stay in\n\nBucharest yesterday [14 July], Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr\n\nMotsyk, too, made the Ukrainian position known both to EU representatives\n\nand to all attendees of the Danube cooperation conference.\n\n\"Romania has three navigation canals. We are only restoring something that\n\nis absolutely necessary for the revival of the region, which is in a\n\ndepressed state,\" the minister said, adding that the Biosfera [biosphere]\n\nnatural reserve has substantially been enlarged in the years of Ukraine's\n\nindependence [since 1991], with a decree of Ukrainian President Leonid\n\nKuchma.\n\nHryshchenko also said that Ukraine has been taking all measures for the\n\nreserve to remain an important part of the environmental future of our state\n\nand of Europe and to ensure that not only Ukrainian cargo ships but also\n\nEuropean transport routes in general could function efficiently and in\n\ncompliance with all environmental standards.\n\nOn 14 July the European Union asked Ukraine to suspend the construction\n\nof a navigation canal in the Danube delta until ecologists fully examine the\n\naftermath of navigation through the Ukrainian canal. Earlier, Romania\n\nprotested against the project, while two months ago the United States\n\nreminded the Ukrainian government that the area was given UNESCO\n\nprotection and was recognized as an environmental zone at the request\n\nof the Ukrainian government itself.

IF MURDER WON'T WORK, TRY CRYING LIBEL\n\nHer partner was kidnapped and beheaded. Now, charges Ukrainian journalist\n\nOlena Prytula, the government is using the courts to shut down her crusading\n\nWeb site.\n\nBy Katharine Mieszkowski, Senior Writer\n\nSalon.com Technology, Internet Media Company\n\nSan Francisco, CA, Thursday, July 15, 2004\n\nThe beheading of Georgi Gongadze, a crusading journalist who uncovered\n\ncorruption and cronyism in the Ukrainian government, couldn't silence\n\nUkrayinska Pravda, the muckraking Web site he founded.\n\nBut almost four years after the 31-year-old's headless body was discovered\n\nin a ditch in a suburb of Kiev, a libel lawsuit threatens to do what murder\n\ncouldn't achieve: shut Ukrayinska Pravda down. The plaintiffs are contesting\n\narticles that allege their involvement in a coverup of who was really behind\n\nthe murder of Gongadze.\n\nThe details are murky, as the plaintiffs were unavailable for comment to\n\nelaborate on the details of their lawsuit. But the key point, according to\n\nOlena Prytula, the editor in chief and co-founder of the Web site, is that\n\nthe lawsuit isn't just demanding a retraction but is also aiming to close\n\ndown the publication. And the timing for that couldn't be better for the\n\nvery same politicians against whom the Web site has been on the warpath:\n\nA national election in October will determine the successor to President\n\nLeonid Kuchma, who is accused by a former bodyguard of personally\n\nordering Gongadze's killing.\n\nFor now, Ukrayinska Pravda, powered by a half-dozen journalists and led\n\nby Prytula, is still publishing articles that rip into Kuchma's loyalists\n\nwith headlines like \"Who Really Wears Pampers in Ukrainian Politics?\" and\n\n\"10 Ways Ukraine Is a Neo-Soviet Country.\" The notoriety of the Gongadze\n\ncase has been a protection of sorts -- any further heavy-handedness would\n\nspur more worldwide attention to an already controversial case. Still,\n\nUkrayinska Pravda's breed of outspoken opposition journalism is unusual\n\nin the post-Soviet Ukraine, which suffers from state censorship of its\n\nbroadcast and print media.\n\n\"Internet was and still is the only place without censorship,\" explains\n\nPrytula, sipping coffee in a Starbucks in San Francisco. Overseeing the site\n\nremotely while on a John S. Knight fellowship at Stanford University,\n\nPrytula is an athletic-looking, fair-skinned blonde who recently hiked the\n\nInca Trail to Machu Picchu and enjoyed the strenuous trek so much she\n\nwants to do it again. But instead, she will return to Ukraine at the end of\n\nJuly to fight the lawsuit and continue covering the run-up to the election.\n\nThe tale of Gongadze, Prytula, Kuchma and Ukrayinska Pravda reads like a\n\n1950s film noir plot transplanted into a 21st century post-Soviet morass.\n\nParts of the story have been well reported, but the twists just keep on\n\ncoming. In the years since Gongadze's death, as his lurid murder remained\n\nunsolved, secret tapes made by a former presidential bodyguard, who now has\n\nasylum in the United States, surfaced suggesting that Kuchma himself ordered\n\nthe killing. The government argued that the tapes had been doctored to put\n\nwords in Kuchma's mouth. Then, a key witness in the case mysteriously died\n\nin police custody, and his body was quickly cremated. Now, the government\n\nclaims to have a confession, although they refuse to name the killer,\n\ncalling him only \"K.\"\n\n\"They said nothing about him, just that he is in prison, and he will be\n\nthere for the rest of his life because he murdered several people,\" says\n\nPrytula. \"Nobody believes it.\"\n\nOLD SOVIET TACTICS REBORN\n\nWhen Gongadze went missing, his disappearance, followed by the\n\ncircumstances of his death, became a national cause c√©l√®bre, prompting\n\nprotests in the streets that continued for years. In Ukraine, an agrarian\n\ncountry of some 50 million people, most of whom do not have Internet\n\naccess, the story of the beheaded Internet journalist who'd taken on the\n\ngovernment, and perhaps been murdered for his stance, spread beyond\n\ncomputer screens.\n\nFor months, Prytula found herself with state-funded bodyguards. But if the\n\nstate had been responsible for the death of her partner, who were they\n\nprotecting her from? Paradoxically, the attention following Gongadze's death\n\nmeant that Ukrayinska Pravda was untouchable, and it continued to publish\n\nas it liked.\n\n\"It's been a very well publicized case, and it seems as if that's one of the\n\nreasons why the authorities have kept their hands off this Internet site,\n\nbecause it would have been pretty obvious if they had stifled it,\" says Nina\n\nOgnianova, a research associate for Europe and Central Asia for the\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists.\n\n\"Over the past three and a half years, the authorities did not dare to\n\nundertake any serious attempts to pressure the Ukrayinska Pravda,\" stated\n\na May 22, 2004, editorial on the site. Then came the libel suit, which the\n\neditors consider an indirect attack from the government. In the editorial,\n\ntitled \"We Shall Overcome,\" the editors reiterated their argument that the\n\nplaintiffs in the case against them are agents of the presidential chief of\n\nstaff who were involved in covering up a presidential involvement in the\n\nGongadze murder.\n\nBut libel isn't really the issue, Prytula argues. A contentious presidential\n\nelection, scheduled for Oct. 31, is fast approaching, and the journalists at\n\nUkrayinska Pravda are convinced the case is simply another attempt by the\n\ngovernment to silence them. Prytula also maintains that it will be\n\nimpossible for Ukrayinska Pravda to get a fair hearing in the court that\n\nwill be hearing the case.\n\n\"They [the plaintiffs] want not just money from us. They also want to arrest\n\nall our bank accounts, and all our computers,\" Prytula says. Pointing out\n\nthat the two plaintiffs in the case are supposedly journalists, she adds:\n\n\"If the truth is the most important thing, why do you want to arrest all our\n\ncomputers and bank accounts?\"\n\nThe editorial says that one of the plaintiffs, Maria Sambur, then working\n\nfor another site, the Institute of Mass Information, doctored the letters of\n\nthe witness in the Gongadze case who died in jail. The omitted passages\n\nallegedly accused Kuchma of involvement in the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Sambur and Valeriy Vorotnik, did not respond to requests\n\nto be interviewed for this article.\n\n\"It's a common technique in the former Soviet Union to try to cripple media\n\noutlets that are very critical of the government or associated with the\n\npolitical opposition by filing for civil damages, and by the granting of\n\nreally prohibitive civil damages,\" says Rachel Denber, acting director of\n\nthe Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. \"Sometimes\n\nthe damages awarded seem more aimed at crippling the outlet than at\n\nredressing a tort -- a civil wrong.\"\n\nBut the Committee to Protect Journalists, a group that has sharply\n\ncriticized the Ukrainian government for its treatment of journalists -- it\n\nnamed Kuchma one of the 10 worst enemies of the press in 2001 in part\n\nbecause of the Gongadze murder-- cautions against assuming that the\n\nlawsuit against the site is an example of the nefarious workings of the\n\ngovernment's tightening grip.\n\n\"So far there hasn't been anything out of the ordinary in the case,\"\n\nOgnianova says. \"It seems like it's a case in which two private citizens are\n\nlooking for civil redress,\" although she does say that her organization is\n\nmonitoring it. \"Because it's a civil claim we have to really wait and see\n\nhow the courts will react and whether they will make a fair decision.\"\n\n\"I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE\"\n\nThe government's statement that the killer has been found and is already in\n\nprison seems a little too convenient to most observers of the case,\n\nespecially following on the heels of a story in the London-based Independent\n\nuncovering new evidence that Kuchma sought to impede the investigation.\n\nThe prosecutor's official announcement of a break in the case has been\n\neyed askance by international watchdog groups. \"We urge the prosecution\n\nto pursue every lead in the case and to investigate fully allegations\n\ninvolving President Kuchma,\" said Ann Cooper, the executive director of\n\nthe Committee to Protect Journalists, in a statement.\n\n\"We do not know who killed Gongadze, but we know there have been\n\nserious failures in the way that the case has been investigated,\" writes\n\nSimon Pirani, chairman of the London Freelance branch of the National\n\nUnion of Journalists, in an e-mail. \"If Gongadze's killers get away with it,\n\nthis will be a green light to bullies and dictators all over Europe to kill\n\njournalists as and when they please. The assassination of the investigative\n\njournalist Paul Klebnikov in Moscow last week shows that the danger\n\npersists.\"\n\nThe atmosphere for journalism in Ukraine is becoming ever more stifling,\n\nas witnessed by the recent closing of two radio stations. \"We just feel the\n\ngrip around the media is getting tighter and tighter,\" Ognianova says. \"It\n\njust seems as if the government is trying to stifle opposition voices right\n\naround election.\"\n\nDoes that make Prytula apprehensive about going back to Ukraine after\n\nher lengthy sojourn in the United States? Is she afraid for her own life?\n\nAbsolutely not. \"I'm not afraid of death,\" she says. \"Georgi's death taught\n\nme that that I have to enjoy every moment of my life, because it maybe the\n\nvery last second.\" (END) (ARTUIS)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the writer: Katharine Mieszkowski is a senior writer for Salon\n\nTechnology.

POLISH ORGANIZATIONS CALL FOR EU DECLARATION\n\nON UKRAINE'S EUROPEAN ASPIRATIONS\n\n\"Support for Ukraine's European Aspirations\"\n\nPolish Newspaper Rzeczpospolita web site, Warsaw, in Polish 13 Jul 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, Tuesday, Jul 13, 2004\n\nWARSAW - A number of Polish non-governmental organizations have\n\nappealed for \"bold and distinctive initiatives [to] be undertaken in the\n\nforum of the EU\" on the future European prospects of Ukraine. They\n\nave also prepared a draft set of proposed tenets for an EU resolution\n\non Ukraine and the forthcoming Ukrainian presidential elections.\n\nThe following is the text of an open letter to President Aleksander\n\nKwasniewski signed by non-governmental organizations in Poland, the letter\n\nitself dated 23 June 2004 and entitled \"Support for Ukraine's European\n\naspirations\", as carried by Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita web site on 13\n\nJuly:\n\nThe community of civil organizations and initiatives, for years engaged in\n\ncooperating with our eastern neighbours, and in particular in the process of\n\nPolish-Ukrainian reconciliation and supporting Ukraine's European\n\naspirations, perceives our country's membership in the EU as a great\n\nopportunity. We want Poland to become a key co-creator of the EU's\n\nneighbour policy, now emerging, although in our opinion this demands\n\nthat bold and distinctive initiatives be undertaken in the forum of the EU.\n\nThis year, Ukraine faces a great challenge - presidential elections will\n\ndemonstrate to what extent this country's democratic and European prospects\n\nare real. In our opinion, Europe's voice should not be missing in this\n\nregard.\n\nWe are appealing for Poland, together with the countries of the Visegrad\n\nGroup, to come forth in the EU forum with an initiative to have the Council\n\nof the European Union adopt a political declaration on the issue of Ukraine.\n\nWe are proposing for the declaration to express the EU's explicit support\n\nfor Ukraine's European aspirations, by outlining a realistic path to\n\nmembership and showing the prospects for corporation and integration in\n\nthose spheres that are truly important to Ukraine. The declaration should\n\nthe same time call for absolute respect of the rules of democracy in the\n\nupcoming elections, and observance of human rights. In an attachment\n\n[below], we present the tenets that, in our opinion, could be included in\n\nsuch declaration.\n\nWe are sending the present letter to the president of the Polish Republic,\n\nthe chairman of the Council of Ministers, the minister of foreign affairs,\n\nand the Speaker and deputy Speakers of the Sejm [lower house of parliament]\n\nof the Polish Republic.

Upon the expansion of the EU, Ukraine has become one of the largest and\n\nmost important neighbours and partners of the EU. The EU has a vital\n\ninterest in Ukraine being perceived as a stable, democratic, and dynamically\n\ndeveloping European state, tied to the EU by close economic, political, and\n\ninterpersonal bonds. We recognize that Ukraine has repeatedly expressed\n\naspirations for full integration with the EU.\n\n2. We are counting on Ukraine to actively exercise the instruments that the\n\nEU's neighbour policy provides. Putting the plan of action into force and\n\nsystematically adapting Ukrainian institutions and the Ukrainian economy to\n\nEuropean standards will lay the foundations for Ukraine's real integration\n\nwith the EU. At the present moment, the issue of Ukraine's full integration\n\nwith the EU remains an open question, pursuant to the provisions of article\n\n49 of the Treaty on European Union.\n\n3. We note with concern that discrepancies in the field of human rights and\n\nthe current state of reforms are serious obstacles in the process of\n\nUkraine's rapprochement with the EU.\n\n4. We call upon the authorities of Ukraine and all political forces in the\n\ncountry to demonstrate in the forthcoming months, via their actions and\n\nattitude, that fully democratic, fair, and free elections can take place in\n\nUkraine, which will be preceded by an election campaign in line with\n\ndemocratic standards, whereby all the candidates have guaranteed access to\n\nthe mass media and the opportunity to present their agendas to the voters.\n\nThe way in which the presidential elections are held will show how the rules\n\nof democracy, the fulfilment of which is a necessary condition for EU\n\nintegration, are respected in Ukraine.\n\n5. We desire for the EU's neighbour policy to meet Ukraine's authentic needs\n\nhalf-way. The EU is declaring the possibility of incorporating Ukraine into\n\nthe zone of the four freedoms. Ukraine's full implementation of the plan of\n\naction will enable significant progress to be achieved in such fields as the\n\nliberalization of the traffic of individuals, simplifications for exports of\n\nUkrainian goods to the EU market, Ukraine's incorporation into EU\n\neducational, cultural, and scientific programmes, including making it\n\npossible for Ukrainian youth to undertake study in EU countries. We want to\n\nintensify dialogue with Ukraine in the field of security, which will lead to\n\nthe gradual incorporation of Ukraine into the common foreign and security\n\npolicy, including the European policy of security and defence.\n\n6. We want to bring about the better utilization of aid funds presently\n\nallocated for cooperation with Ukraine, inter alia by coordinating the\n\ninstruments of trans-border corporation. Within the new EU budgetary\n\nperspective spending in 2007, we are planning significantly greater funding\n\nfor cooperation with neighbours, including Ukraine.\n\n7. Ukraine's observance of democratic norms, such as the freedom of the mass\n\nmedia, the independence of the judiciary, free and fair elections, and the\n\nconsistent performance of the plan of action will enable a new agreement to\n\nbe reached, which would replace the agreement on partnership and cooperation\n\nand would constitute the foundation for Ukraine's further integration with\n\nthe EU.
