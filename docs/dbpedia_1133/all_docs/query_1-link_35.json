        "text": "KYIV, September 5 /UKRINFORM/. Trade and economic cooperation between Ukraine and Hungary is successful, Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovsky said at a meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice of Hungary Tibor Navracsics, which took place on September 4 as part of Khoroshkovsky's visit to Poland.\n\nIn particular, the trade between the two countries has increased by more than four times over the last decade, Khoroshkovsky said.\n\n\"The trade has increased by more than four times over the last decade. Last year we had an increase of nearly 30%. This is a sign of the success of trade and economic cooperation and a high level of bilateral trust,\" Khoroshkovsky's press service quoted him as saying.\n\nHe also stressed the need to maintain the positive dynamics of bilateral trade in future.\n\nDuring the meeting the sides also discussed cooperation in the visa area, both in the context of bilateral cooperation, as well as in the context of the implementation by Ukraine of an action plan on the liberalization of the EU visa regime.\n\nUkraine's first deputy prime minister praised the increase in the number of visas issued by the Hungarian side to Ukrainian citizens. At the same time, he expressed hope that the number of multiple-entry visas for Ukrainians for a period of two to five years would be increased.\n\nKhoroshkovsky noted that such a step was very important for Ukrainian citizens who have relatives and business connections in Hungary.\n\nIn addition, the sides discussed issues of border cooperation. According to Khoroshkovsky, Ukraine is interested in the development of infrastructure on the joint state border. \"This foresees the construction of new checkpoints and the expansion of the existing ones,\" he said."
