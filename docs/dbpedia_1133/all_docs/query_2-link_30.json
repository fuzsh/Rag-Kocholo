        "text": "Citation preview\n\nMichael Johnston, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Colgate University, New York\n\n“Ukraine is an exemplary case to demonstrate the complexities of the fight against corruption. In her book, Oksana Huss does not simply illustrate this over a longer time period and with more details than usual. Crucially, she provides a systematic analytical framework which coherently and convincingly brings together the numerous and diverse aspects of the political economy of corruption.” Heiko Pleines, Professor of Comparative Politics, University of Bremen\n\n“At a time, when quantitative analyses of dubious quality have come to dominate research on corruption, Oksana Huss presents a masterfully crafted study that deserves the attention of every scholar who seriously tries to understand the political dynamics of corrupt practices and anti-corruption campaigns. It is also a must-read for students of modern Ukraine. Her fine analysis traces how patterns of corruption and anti-corruption shaped and were shaped by Ukraine’s three presidential regimes from 1994 until 2014. It leaves the reader with a central message: to understand today’s hybrid regimes, a solid understanding of institutionalized corruption is indispensable.”\n\n218\n\nHow Corruption and Anti-Corruption Policies Sustain Hybrid Regimes\n\n“Huss, in this provocative study of Ukraine, shows that the conventional wisdom is misleading. Both corruption and reforms can be means of control, solidifying rather than undermining the power of presidents—even those who govern badly. In a time of international awareness of corruption, that might seem surprising—but top figures can skew our perceptions by the ways they ‘frame’ corruption and reform. In struggling societies dealing with corruption is much more than just a matter of making and enforcing rules.”\n\nSPPS\n\nHuss\n\nLeaders of hybrid regimes in pursuit of political domination and material gain instrumentalize both hidden forms of corruption and public anti-corruption policies. Corruption is pursued for different purposes including cooperation with strategic partners and exclusion of opponents. Presidents use anti-corruption policies to legitimize and institutionalize political domination. Corrupt practices and anti-corruption policies become two sides of the same coin and are exercised to maintain an uneven political playing field. This study combines empirical analysis and social constructivism for an investigation into the presidencies of Leonid Kuchma (1994–2005), Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010), and Viktor Yanukovych (2010–2014). Explorative expert interviews, press surveys, content analysis of presidential speeches, as well as critical assessment of anti-corruption legislation are used for comparison and process tracing of the utilization of corruption under three Ukrainian presidents.\n\nThe author: Dr Oksana Huss is a Research Fellow at Bologna University. She earned her PhD at the University of Duisburg-Essen and held a postdoc position at Leiden University. Huss taught at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy as well as Kyiv School of Economics, and consulted the Council of Europe, EU, UNESCO, and UNODC.

Corrupt practices and anti-corruption policies become two sides of the same coin and are exercised to maintain an uneven political playing field.

The study is based on a Most Similar Systems Design through an intracase comparison of three presidencies: Leonid Kuchma (1994– 2005), Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010) and Viktor Yanukovych (2010–2014). The book investigates the following research questions: Why do presidents in Ukraine use different political strategies and discursive framings to address corruption? How do they utilize corruption as a tactic to maintain political domination in hybrid regimes? The book applies both positivist and constructivist approaches. The empirical analysis reveals the role of corrupt practices in sustaining political domination. Furthermore, it demonstrates impressively that anti-corruption policies in a hybrid regime like Ukraine can be understood as discursive framing strategies applied by political leaders to ensure and legitimize their political domination. The book studies how different regime trajectories under authoritarian or semi-democratic rule led to different corruption practices. In a cartel-like deal, Kuchma managed to construct a centralized system of corruption that traditionally framed the problem along a principal-agent approach. Yushchenko, on the other hand, could not centralize elites and attempted to secure power through a decentralized system in which he discursively emphasized European values in the fight against political corruption. However, he was unable to present himself credibly to the population as a politician of a new type. In a way, as Oksana Huss contends, he became the victim of his own discourse. Yanukovych, in turn, succeeded in monopolizing corruption because of his “political machine”, the Party of Regions. His political discourse remained deliberately vague and shaped by metaphors, which made it difficult to measure the success of anti-corruption policies.\n\nxxiii\n\nDespite these differences, the three presidents shared a willingness to adapted their framing strategies to account for the constellation of their political opponents and addressed the expectations of external actors. Furthermore, their administrations were all initially supported by the population—and failed to adjust their strategies appropriately as their popularity ratings declined. In summary, this book provides an important contribution in a challenging empirical research field. It corresponds to the state of the art and provides an in-depth case study based on an analytically attractive theoretical and methodological framework.

The leading studies of hybrid regimes identified endemic political corruption as those regimes’ immanent characteristic (Åslund 2015; Hale 2015; Havrylyshyn 2017; Levitsky and Way 2010). Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic research concerning the interdependence between hybrid regimes, their trajectories, and corruption (Pech 2009). This thesis aims to enrich transformation studies by incorporating corruption research and closing the knowledge gap between the “(dys)functionalities” of corruption practice and framing (Debiel and Gawrich 2013), in particular in hybrid regimes. Ukraine demonstrates an appropriate empirical example to study such interdependencies. On the one hand, a turbulent transformation process and several regime oscillations occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union. With regard to the transformation process, since its independence Ukraine has been host to three different regime trajectories of high volatility. The administration of President Leonid Kuchma (1994–2005) saw shades of authoritarian tendencies. After the Orange Revolution in November 2004–January 2005, hope grew for a democratic reorientation. Between 2010 and 2014, however, President Viktor Yanukovych reverted to the authoritarian trajectory, which was violently abandoned in the course of the Maidan Revolution in 2013–2014. Thus, the transition process in Ukraine has oscillated between semi-consolidated democracy and semi-consolidated authoritarianism but remains stable in its hybridity. On the other hand, rather counter-intuitively, through all these years, the level of corruption in Ukraine has perennially been well above average, even though Ukraine’s Freedom House democracy score improved between 2005 and 2009 (see Figure 1). Both revolutions—the Orange Revolution and the Maidan Revolution—were initiated because of widespread discontent among the population at corruption. During the Orange Revolution, electoral fraud was the spark that inflamed a popular uprising against the ruling elite. During the 2013– 1\n\n2\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\n2014 Ukrainian revolution, one of the main demands of the protesters included the removal of the corrupt Yanukovych regime and punishment of those involved in political corruption.1 Figure 1:\n\nFreedom House Nations in Transit democracy score 1999–2014 Nations in Transit Democracy Score 1999-2014\n\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nLocal Democratic Governance\n\nNational Democratic Governance\n\nGovernance\n\nElectoral Process\n\nCivil Society\n\nIndependent Media\n\nJudicial Framework and Independence\n\nCorruption\n\n20 14\n\n20 13\n\n20 12\n\n20 11\n\n20 10\n\n20 09\n\n20 08\n\n20 07\n\n20 06\n\n20 05\n\n20 04\n\n20 03\n\n20 02\n\n20 01\n\n19 99 -2\n\n00 0\n\n0\n\nDemocracy Score\n\nSource: Freedom House Nations in Transit democracy score, 1999–2014.

The reason for this focus is the decisive role that presidents have due to Ukraine’s semi-presidential political system (Carrier 2012; Choudhry et al. 2018; Matsuzato 2005; Protsyk 2003). 1\n\nAccording to the December 7–8, 2013 survey conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, 75 % of Maidan participants claimed that the dismissal of the government and early presidential elections were necessary, and 50 % considered it crucial to punish the corrupt political elite. 1,037 respondents were questioned.

The definition of competitive authoritarianism is based on the partial relevance and selective application of formal democratic rules. Political competition and the existence of an uneven playing field between incumbents and the opposition are crucial for this concept. The in-between-ness between democracy and authoritarianism is an important characteristic of competitive authoritarian regimes. As with democracies, in competitive authoritarianism elections shape actors’ strategies, even though competition is not necessarily fair. Because elections are not merely a façade, wide popular support is highly desirable to remain in power. At the same time, similar to authoritarian regimes, incumbents are able to manipulate state institutions and resources to such a degree that political competition is seriously limited. Another limitation is that ruling elites are fragmented, and control over political, administrative and economic resources is divided among several oligarchic groups. In this situation, to strengthen political power and to secure co-optation of elites, incumbents need to gain the acceptance and support of elite networks. The constant need of incumbents to balance between public and elite support under conditions of competitive authoritarianism makes corruption a controversial issue for the ruling elite. This controversy constitutes, in turn, the research puzzle of this project. The basic assumption is that every political leadership aims to maintain political domination by all means (Levitsky and Way 2010; Way 2005a; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2005). However, in hybrid regimes, elites face permanent challenges to their political domination, which may interrupt incumbent political control and challenge their re-election (Levitsky and Way 2010, p. 20). These permanent challenges to political domination cause a serious dilemma for the ruling elite: On the one hand, thwarting the challenge requires a blatant assault on democratic institutions (i.e., stealing elections or closing parliament). Because such challenges are legal and generally perceived as legitimate (both at home and\n\n4\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES abroad), openly repressing them may be quite costly. On the other hand, if incumbents allow democratic procedures to run their course, they risk possible regime change and losing power. In effect, such challenges force incumbents to choose between egregiously violating democratic rules, at the cost of international isolation and domestic conflict, and allowing the challenge to proceed, at the cost of possible defeat (Levitsky and Way 2010, 20).\n\n1.2.\n\nThe research question\n\nThe research question of this study addresses the core of the dilemma described above: Why do presidents in Ukraine use different political strategies and discursive framings for dealing with corruption? How do they practice corruption as a tactic to maintain political domination in hybrid regimes? It is assumed that the political leadership of a hybrid regime needs to practice corruption as a rational action in order to maintain its dominance. Since corruption is an expected behavior, political leaders risk losing the support of the strategic elite if they refuse to favor their clients during the redistribution of public resources. However, the costs of blatantly practicing corruption can be too high due to international pressure and the risk of losing popular support and the resulting damage to electoral prospects. Especially since the mid-1990s, corruption, as a topic, has become increasingly important in international politics, and has resulted in the establishment of several international anti-corruption regimes by the mid2000s (Moroff 2005). International actors, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN), the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as well as Transparency International (TI) have developed a variety of instruments—from conditionality during financial assistance (IMF, EU) to control and peer review mechanisms (OECD, CoE) as well as mechanisms of “shaming and blaming” (e.g. TI Corruption Perception Index)—in order to force national governments to introduce anti-corruption\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nmeasures.2 Thus, considerable credits and development assistance are reliant upon the implementation and success of anti-corruption measures. Citizens, too, are increasingly aware of the negative consequences of political corruption and they condemn blatantly corrupt practices. As indicated above, the main trigger of the Orange Revolution was electoral fraud. Also, removing the corrupt political elite was among the chief demands during the Euromaidan. Both revolutions witnessed a change of political leadership, although they did not change the regime.\n\n1.3.\n\nThe central argument\n\nThe central argument of this study is that under conditions of instability and permanent oscillation, political leaders in pursuit of political domination instrumentalize both public framing and the hidden practice of corruption. They engage in corruption in order to increase their power and material resources. The practice of corruption allows cooperation with strategic partners or exclusion and coercion of one’s opponents. Framing corruption is applied to develop anti-corruption policies in a particular way that legitimizes and institutionalizes the political domination of a presidency that has been achieved by means of corrupt practices. In other words, corrupt practices and anti-corruption policy are two sides of the same coin: they are highlighted and exercised to maintain domination on an uneven playing field by maintaining a prevalence of resources and hierarchies in the constellation of actors. The theoretical assumption of this study is that different patterns of corrupt practices and framing fulfill varying functions. The analysis of corrupt practices and framing under different regime trajectories will be applied to demonstrate the interdependencies of political tactics utilizing corrupt practices and the trajectories of a hybrid regime. Thus, the answer to the empirical question about\n\n2\n\nFor the evolution of international anti-corruption regimes and their instruments and mechanisms, see Moroff 2005; Chene and Dell 2008; Sousa, Larmour, and Hindess 2010.\n\n6\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\nframing and practicing corruption as tactics for political domination in Ukraine will contribute to the theoretical question: What functions does political corruption have in hybrid regimes and how do different tactics of framing interdepend with hybrid regime trajectories? At the edge of transformation and corruption studies, this work combines theoretical concepts from both fields of research. In transformation studies, this combination enriches the explanatory potential of political corruption as an intervening variable in hybrid regimes. Corruption research will be enriched through the concept of the system of corruption as an immanent part of a hybrid regime. Studying the system of corruption marks an important shift from the focus on quantitative assessment of the level of corruption to the in-depth assessment of the dynamic mechanisms and implications of the system of corruption. The system perspective assumes that the features and implications of corruption are not the same in all contexts, even though high scores on the quantitative scale of corruption may suggest that they are. This approach allows analyzing different patterns of how the system of corruption operates, and what implication the system has on political and economic development. Most importantly, it assists in explaining the failures of the anti-corruption policies in place and designing innovative tools to counteract corruption.\n\n1.4.\n\nMethods of data collection and analysis\n\nFor the data collection and analysis, the following methods have been applied: Explorative expert interviews, process tracing, qualitative content analysis and textual legislation analysis. Explorative expert interviews At the outset of this study, ten explorative expert interviews were conducted (Gläser and Laudel 2010). The aim of the expert interviews was twofold: to review initial theoretical assumptions about the particularities of political corruption in Ukraine, and to identify specific assumptions about varieties of the system of corruption\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nunder different presidents and the factors that influenced these variations. The explorative interviews were designed as open-ended questions. Three central questions were posed to all experts, while clarifying questions differed depending on the specific subject of conversation and the area of expertise. The three central questions were: Q. 1: What are the particularities of political corruption in Ukraine? Q. 2: Are there any differences in the evolution of political corruption under different presidents in Ukraine? Q. 3: Why do you think the respective differences occurred? The length of the interviews varied between 30 and 90 minutes. Upon agreement with the experts, most of the interviews were recorded and transcribed for further analysis. The criteria for the expert selection were knowledge of the issue of political corruption in Ukraine, ability to provide precise information and willingness to share it, and availability of the expert (based on Gläser and Laudel 2010, 117 ff.). In addition, experts from different fields of work were selected in order to obtain a holistic overview of political corruption in Ukraine. As a result, experts from anti-corruption civil society organizations, international organizations, journalists, academics, and parliamentary employees were interviewed (Annex 1: Overview of the expert interview partners). It is worth highlighting the important role of civil society as a source of information on political corruption and the assessment of anti-corruption. In Ukraine, multiple CSOs, in particular at the national level, professionalized their political role as watchdog organizations (Beichelt et al. 2014; Solonenko 2015; Worschech 2017). In the context of a politically dependent judiciary and prosecution, CSOs (among others, Anti-Corruption Action Centre, Chesno, Opora, Transparency International Ukraine) as well as the investigative journalists of Nashi Hroshi, Ukrainska Pravda, Hromadske Radio became the only sources of societal control over executive and legislative branches of power, while investigating and revealing political corruption. Besides, very few independent and established think tanks (among others, the Centre of Policy and Legal Reform, Ilko Kucheriv\n\n8\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\nDemocratic Initiatives Foundation, Razumkov Centre, the Ukrainian Centre for Independent Political Research) became a critical source for the analytical assessment of Ukrainian policymaking, including anti-corruption policies. For this reason, the investigations of the publicly renowned journalists and activists and the expertise of selected think tanks are an important source providing information about corruption practices and an impartial assessment of anti-corruption policies and infrastructure for this study. At the same time, the critical voice of civil society evolved in the course of time. For instance, there are very few investigations about political corruption in the mid-1990s, while there were several murders of investigative journalists, including the prominent case of Heorhiy Gongadze, in that decade. In the third case study, however, there are multiple organizations and individual journalists working and publishing on the issue of corruption. Thus, the change of political context that provided a window of opportunity for politically critical CSOs to evolve is, indirectly, an object of interpretation in the elaboration of regime trajectories. Process tracing For the analysis of the research question “How do presidents in Ukraine practice corruption as a tactic to maintain political domination in hybrid regimes?” process tracing has been applied. Compared to other methods for structuring case studies, the use of process tracing offers several advantages. First, the purpose of this study is to analyze the functions of corruption in the trajectories of different regimes. Process tracing made it possible to tackle the dynamic of the regime and trace changes in political tactics. Second, this method is “commonly defined by its ambition to trace causal mechanisms” (Beach and Pedersen 2013, 1). This explicit focus on causal mechanisms differentiates process tracing from the typical congruence methods (George and Bennett 2005) that are restricted by the strict causalities between dependent and independent variables (Wendt 1998, 105). As Beach and Pedersen (2013, 4 ff.) summarize:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nCongruence investigates correlations between X and Y, whereas processtracing investigates the working of the mechanism(s) that contribute to producing an outcome. Process-tracing methods go beyond correlations by attempting to trace the theoretical causal mechanism(s) linking X and Y.\n\nThus, in the empirical case studies, process tracing of corrupt practices in pursuit of political domination reveals the functions of corruption in the process of regime oscillations with regard to prevalence of resources and the constellation of actors. Third, the internal process of strategy building by the actors is hidden and only the assessment of external activities makes statements about actors’ strategies possible. Process tracing reveals how the political tactics of each president changed and adapted according to the regime dynamic, which in its totality allows generalization about a general strategy and its success. Qualitative content analysis In order to conduct framing analysis, qualitative content analysis of presidential speeches, citations, and press conferences mentioning corruption between 1994 and 2014 was conducted. The data covers about 1,200 news articles, from the databases of Factiva and Integrum, texts of speeches, and autobiographies. The data was collected in two steps. In a first step, official speeches of each president, such as the annual address to the parliament or to the nation, were collected in the digital archive of the Verkhovna Rada—the Parliament of Ukraine and its official publication “Holos Ukrainy.” By means of an electronic search for the term “corruption,” only relevant speeches were selected for the content analysis. In the second step, in the databases of the electronic newspapers Factiva and Integrum, I conducted a search for direct quotes or interviews by the presidents published in the press. The search inquiry included the term “corruption” (in both Ukrainian and Russian spelling), the name of the president and a verb that indicates an action by the president (e.g. “said,” “mentioned,” “indicated,” etc.). The search inquiry was limited to a text unit of 5 words. The final data set excluded duplications and contained only articles with direct quotes by a president. The central unit of analysis was a direct quote of a president with regards to the term “corruption” and not the\n\n10\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\ninterpretation of a journalist. Given this focus, reflections about political affiliation or ownership of the media are not of interest for this analysis. The list of sources exploited for the search in the databases is provided in Annex 2. Data analysis was conducted with MaxQDA. The essence of the qualitative content analysis is “assigning successive parts of the material to the categories of a coding frame” (Schreier 2014, 170). Coding was done in a systematic and simultaneously flexible way that aimed at reducing the data and selecting relevant aspects of the meaning (Schreier 2014, 170). The concept-driven approach was selected to analyze data in line with the four main theoretical approaches to corruption and the concept of framing (elaborated in Chapter 3.2). This means that main framework of categories was developed in advance, covering the description and definition of corruption, its causal interpretations and judgment, as well as recommended remedies (Entman 1993). However, in the process of data analysis, the categories were revisited and expanded (Schreier 2014, 174). The codebook is summarized in Annex 3. Given the large number of sources, the use of numerical data for internal generalizability was useful for revealing framing patterns, although the research was designed and conducted as a qualitative study (Maxwell 2010). The book provides only selected citations of presidential speeches as examples that reflect each framing pattern most precisely.3 Textual legislation analysis In order to analyze how public framing of corruption influences anti-corruption policies, textual analysis of anti-corruption legislation was conducted. Annex 4 contains the list of anti-corruption legislation between 1991 and 2014, analyzed in the study. Importantly, the legislation was analyzed independently of its implementation, since the aim is to analyze the anti-corruption policy as a contested space between multiple political actors. The analytical framework 3\n\nThe sources cited as an example for the framing are listed in the bibliography as “Primary sources for the framing analysis.” Several online newspapers, such as Ukrainska Pravda and UNIAN, serve also as a source of information for the overall analysis in this study and are included in the list of references.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nof this analysis follows the framing analysis of corruption. It examines the assumption that, depending on the conceptual framing of corruption, anti-corruption policy is exploited by the political leadership to increase their political domination.\n\n1.5.\n\nThe structure of this study\n\nThe study is structured into theoretical and empirical parts. The theoretical part, chapters 2 to 5, conceptualizes corruption, hybrid regimes, and theorizes the interdependency between the system of corruption and the dynamic of hybrid regimes. The conceptualization of corruption is done in two different research paradigms—the empirical-analytical approach (Chapter 2) and social constructivism (Chapter 3)—in order to unfold the complexity of the corruption phenomenon. Chapter 2.1 introduces the empirical-analytical and social constructivist approach, while the rest of the chapter conceptualizes corruption in line with the first research logic. In particular, chapter 2.2 identifies corrupt practices by defining the core characteristics of corruption. Further, in chapter 2.3, a variety of different forms and mechanisms of corruption are presented, while focusing on the difference between two equilibria—corruption as an exception or as a norm. Chapter 2.4 aims to analytically sharpen the blurred lines between corruption and other forms of particularism. Chapter 2.5 theoretically conceptualizes the system of corruption and its variation. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the analysis of corruption through the constructivist lens as well as its systematic confluence with the empirical-analytical approach. In particular, this chapter elaborates how different empirical concepts of corruption can be utilized through framing. Chapter 3.1.1 defines corruption as an empty signifier and discusses the implications of such an approach for the construction of political identities. Further, this chapter introduces the concept of framing as a key tool for using the topic of “corruption” in political tactics and synthesizes the implications of a poststructural perspective for political domination. Chapter 3.2. discusses a variety of agency- and institution-centered explanatory approaches to corruption that can be exploited for different framing\n\n12\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\ntactics. These approaches are summarized in Table 2, Chapter 3.3 includes an overview of the possible functions for different framing tactics. Chapter 4 conceptualizes hybrid regimes in the context of transformation studies and the role of corruption therein. Chapter 4.1 provides a general overview of the concept of hybrid regimes in order to contextualize this research within the field of transformation studies. Chapter 4.2 introduces the characteristics of hybrid regimes and focuses in particular on the uneven playing field. It contextualizes the idea of uneven playing in the literature on presidentialism and discusses the interplay of formal and informal institutions in hybrid regimes. Chapter 4.3 elaborates an interdependence between the type of corruption system and trajectories of hybrid regimes. In particular, the type of corruption system is connected to the patterns of elite interaction and distribution of public resources. Chapter 4.4 operationalizes actors’ action and conceptualizes political strategy and tactics for political domination in regime dynamics. Chapter 5 applies the theoretical concept of the system of corruption to the political system of Ukraine, which allows the combination of transformation studies and corruption research and the application of relevant concepts to the case of Ukraine. Chapter 5.1 introduces the term “oligarchs” and elaborates upon their role in the political system. Chapter 5.2 tackles a model for the system of corruption within Ukraine. While most corruption researchers work with rather static structural typologies, a dynamic model of the system of corruption was developed for this study. It is essential to be able to analytically consider dynamics, when researching corruption in hybrid regimes, because permanent oscillation is one of their defining characteristics. The model of the system of corruption explains the role of corruption in regime dynamics and allocates distinct forms of political corruption in the political cycle. This model arrays different forms and mechanisms of political corruption in a coherent interdependency. Additionally, the model allows locating individual actors and their agency in a time-specific context. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the role of political\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\ncorruption in the durability of the hybrid regime in Ukraine (Chapter 5.3). The empirical part of the study consists of three case studies of corrupt practices and framing as political tactics under three Presidents: Leonid Kuchma (Chapter 6), Viktor Yushchenko (Chapter 7), and Viktor Yanukovych (Chapter 8). All three case studies are structured in the same way and consist of five parts. The first part identifies the point of departure for the strategy of the president with a focus on the initial power resources and constellation of actors in the political system. Next follows an analysis of the particularities of the corrupt practices as tactics for political domination. The synthesis of the second part summarizes the implications of corrupt practices for the president’s access to power resources and dynamics in the constellation of actors, which is crucial for the trajectory of the regime. The third part is dedicated to the analysis of corruption framing as a tactic for political domination. Framing tactics are considered the basis for the anti-corruption policy, analyzed in the fourth part. The synthesis aims to show how different frames of corruption influence anti-corruption policy. Further, it demonstrates how anti-corruption policy is exploited by presidents for political domination. The conclusion in the fifth part provides an assessment of the general strategy for political domination, its success and the tactics utilized to achieve it. The focus of the analysis is on the functions of corrupt practices and framing for the prevalence of power resources and interaction with other actors (external points of reference) in order to create hierarchies in the constellation of actors. Chapter 9 concludes the study with a synopsis and comparative analysis of the empirical research. It discusses implications of this research for further anti-corruption activities and provides recommendations. Finally, the chapter provides prospects for future research.\n\n2.\n\nConceptualizing corruption: Definitions, typologies and explanatory approaches\n\n2.1.\n\nFrom worldview to the concept\n\nThe approach adopted in this book begins with conceptualization as a bridge between worldview and abstract thoughts on the one side and empirical evidence on the other (Figure 2). Worldviews remain mostly hidden (Creswell 2014; Stykow et al. 2010, 146 ff.), leaving conceptualization as the only visible façade to allow assumptions about the basic philosophical ideas of the researcher to become known. To grasp the differences of the worldview, it is useful to examine how the connection between language and reality is presented. Figure 2:\n\nFrom worldview to the concept Worldview Theory/Theoretical approach Concept => Definition Operationalization Indicator\n\nSource: Own depiction\n\nAt one pole, a positivist worldview clearly distinguishes between language and reality, shaping the empirical-analytical approach in the research. In this paradigm, knowledge is based on observation and measurement of objective reality (Creswell 2014). Accordingly, a definition or concept is meaningful only if tested via empirical evidence. Thus, language is only a tool to relay empirical reality (Stykow et al. 2010, 146). Methodologically, such a paradigm requires that all theoretical concepts present in the research must be operationalized and proven by nominal indicators. At the other end of the spectrum, social constructivists consider reality closely interconnected with language. Language\n\n15\n\n16\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\nrepresents an independent system, able to evolve and influence reality (Ball, Farr, and Hanson 1989; Berger, Luckmann, and Plessner 2016, 38 ff.). In the context of the constructivist paradigm, concepts and definitions become the object of research. The focus shifts to the deconstruction of concepts, or the analysis of their varying and sometimes contradictory meanings, as well as their political power as it unfolds in language. A “pragmatic worldview” combines both paradigms, mentioned above (Creswell 2014, 39). Stykow et al. explain this paradigm as “realism.” As in the empirical-analytical approach, the existence of reality independent of language is accepted; however, those concepts and definitions that are impossible to grasp are also real (Stykow et al. 2010, 148). The pragmatic worldview allows inference about the influence of language on political reality. Reflecting on the fundamental understanding of how language and reality are interrelated is crucial for this work, as this study aims to create an analytical bridge between rhetoric and the hidden practice of corruption and political reality. This work argues that only the combination of both the empirical-analytical and constructivist perspectives allows one to unfold the complexity of the phenomenon of corruption. It implies that the practice of corruption is real, with all its negative societal consequences, acknowledged and underpinned by extensive research.4 Therefore, it is crucial to elaborate a working definition of corruption in order to differentiate corruption from other malpractices (see Chapter 2.2–2.5). The operationalization of corruption in existing research will allow identification and analysis of the role of corrupt practices in political tactics. At the same time, the crucial role of framing is recognized, and the 4\n\nRothstein and Tannenberg (2015) provide an extensive overview of literature on the negative effects of corruption: on development in society and its deterrence of foreign direct investment (Méon and Sekkat 2005; Mo 2001); its negative relation to private investment (Mo 2001); its stifling of innovation and entrepreneurship (Anokhin and Schulze 2009); its undermining of the legitimacy of the state (Dahlberg and Holmberg 2014); its negative impact on healthcare spending (Transparency International 2006); its decrease in the return on investment in the health sector (Lewis 2006); its lowering of education attainment (Akçay 2006); and its depreciation of social trust and social capital (Rothstein 2005; Rothstein 2011).\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING CORRUPTION\n\n17\n\nargument is made that different meanings assigned to “corruption” as a term carry different consequences in politics and for society accordingly (see Chapter 3).\n\n2.2.\n\nCore characteristics of corruption\n\nWith an increasing academic interest in the topic of corruption— from hardly any articles and panels on corruption in the 1990s to a large number of special issues and conferences dedicated to corruption less than thirty years later (Rothstein and Varraich 2017, 7)— attempts to define corruption have understandably increased. The most common definition refers to corruption as an “abuse of entrusted power for private gain.” Researchers have highlighted several potential shortcomings inherent in this definition (Debiel and Pech 2010, 54; Gawrich and Debiel 2016, 634): First, the phrase “abuse of power” suggests a violation of formal rules. Formal rules might be adopted under corrupt influence, making them in the process corrupt as well. Second, the phrase “private gain” is problematic, since corruption might be used to gain political power, primarily but not solely for material enrichment. Finally, the phrase “entrusted power” is usually associated with public office; however, entrusted power can encompass situations where the public places its trust in an individual who is expected to make impartial judgments, similar to a referee in sporting contests. In this regard, Arnold Heidenheimer differentiates between those definitions of corruption centered on public office, and those on public trust (Heidenheimer, Johnston, and Le Vine 1989; Heidenheimer and Johnston 2002). While the first type considers public office a prerequisite to identify corruption, the second type is broader and shifts the core of corruption to the violation of public trust with or without political office. Despite a broad critique of the definition of corruption (Olteanu 2012, 39), the phrase “abuse of entrusted power for private gain” contains the central characteristics that allow identifying corruption, differentiating it from other malpractices (Köbis and Huss 2017, 153 ff.). The first characteristic is entrusted power, which means that both sides—public and private—are involved. In other words, an actor is exposed to corruption only if the public has placed its trust\n\n18\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\nand empowered the aforementioned actor to act in the interests of the public. However, the actor needs to permanently weigh his or her public position against private interests, which leads to the second core characteristic of corruption—crossing the line between public and private interest. In this study, it is important that entrusted power results in public office, so that political corruption can be focused upon. Thus, the second characteristic of corruption is a deviation from the rule of separation between public and private—the abuse of public trust. This characteristic is central in one of the classic definitions of corruption (Nye 1967): Corruption is behaviour which deviates from the formal duties of a public role because of private-regarding (personal, close family, private clique) pecuniary or status gains; or violates the rules against the exercise of certain type of private regarding influence (cited in Philp 2005, 44–45).\n\nCritical researchers increasingly point out that not all societies distinguish as strongly between public and private spheres as Western democracies do (Gephart 2009). But in support of a universal concept of corruption, Rothstein (2014) introduced the “public goods theory of corruption.” Rothstein argues that all societies produce some set of public goods and when those who are responsible for managing the public goods convert them into private goods, people generally condemn it as abuse (Rothstein 2014, 741). For this reason, “damage to public interest” by trespassing the line between public and private, which is implied in the word “abuse,” is an inevitable element of the definition, independently of varying normative context. Should an individual entrusted with public office combine their work for the public with private interest, it should not be immediately regarded as corruption. The presence of only the two above-mentioned characteristics is not sufficient to denote corruption if a third, private advantage, for the person in power, is absent. Corruption can only be positively identified if the actor was entrusted with public power but used this position for private advantage. Private advantage is not necessarily personal but can include advantage for the members of the family or a private clique. Instead of the term “gain,” this work uses the term “advantage,”\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING CORRUPTION\n\n19\n\nwhich indicates that not only monetary gain is considered, but also forms of corruption that aim to gain advantages over opponents by using public resources. Usually, this leads to another characteristic, which is the social cost of corruption to the public incurred through reduced (by monetary corruption) or mismanaged (by social corruption) public resources. These core characteristics allow distinguishing corruption from other malpractices, like theft, collusion, nepotism, extortion, etc. All malpractices can be related to corruption or even be a form of corruption, but only in circumstances where they combine the above-mentioned characteristics.\n\n2.3.\n\nVarieties of corruption\n\nAlongside the definition and elaboration of core characteristics, the differentiation of varying forms of corruption allows operationalization of the term for the purposes of this study. The decision regarding which forms will be emphasized depends largely on the discipline and research foci in which the study is located. Recently, there have been a few attempts to cluster different approaches of the forms of corruption. For instance, Jennifer Bussel argues for a more explicit but pragmatic approach to typologies of corruption and states that “a diversity of typologies, rather than one primary typology, may be most analytically useful” (Bussell 2015, 22). Together with a researcher in behavioral economics, Nils Köbis, the author of this work has developed an atlas of forms of corruption that allows better interdisciplinary communication in collaborative corruption research (Köbis and Huss 2017). Based on the three core characteristics of corruption, we elaborated several dimensions for each characteristic, so that corruption researchers from different disciplines can easily locate the form of corruption they are researching in a broader context and show how their research is related to other forms of corruption. In the context of the interdisciplinary atlas of forms of corruption, this work highlights the difference between the high political and low administrative forms of corruption, grand and petty corruption, corruption\n\n20\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\noccurring on the input and output side(s) of the political processes as well as monetary and non-monetary forms of corruption. In addition to these forms of corruption, two other characteristics that influence the researcher’s choice of definition of corruption are added: First is the difference in frequency of corrupt practices, that is, whether we are dealing with corruption in a context in which it is an exception, or in a context in which it is the rule. This difference is essential to contextualize subsequent research in this study, to be elaborated below. Second, we introduce a three-level zoom factor to contextualize the subject and actors in corruption research: the individual micro-level, the organizational meso-level, and the country and society macro-levels. In this study, the aggregation of the macro and micro levels is explored, since the focus on the country’s president means that individual behavior should be considered, alongside the context in which it takes place. 2.3.1.\n\nDistinguishing context: Corruption as an exception vs. corruption as the norm\n\nIdentifying the frequency of corruption, whether as a systemic problem or only an occasional deviation from the rules, is widely applied in existing research. In the atlas of forms of corruption, we highlighted this differentiation not as a form of corruption, but rather as a governance context in which corruption takes place (Köbis and Huss 2017, 168). The context influences the perceptions, definition, characteristics and forms of corruption, as well as problem-solving approaches. Thus, even if one uses the term “corruption,” since its core characteristics remain the same, the phenomenon has different implications and varying meanings depending on the context. Alina Mungiu-Pippidi provides a very useful and clear comparison of both contexts (see Table 1: Governance context of corruption practices). The point of departure for analytic differentiation is to identify the central “norm” of governance, represented as “ethical universalism” (Mungiu-Pippidi 2015, 15). The norm is set with regard to an impartial distribution of public goods. Mungiu-Pippidi identifies two contexts, A and B. In “Context A,” the ideal type of governance is ethical universalism where corruption\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING CORRUPTION\n\n21\n\nis an exception. Alternatively, “Context B” describes a state in which public goods are distributed based on particularism and can be expropriated by the most powerful individuals at nearly unlimited discretion. In the latter scenario, we analyze the “clusters of corruption” rather than singular instances or particular forms: If particularism is the rule of the game, we are likely to find a cluster of corruption practices: vertically structured favoritism (clientelism, patronage), horizontally structured favoritism (negative social capital networks, “old boy networks”), kinship-motivated particularism (nepotism, ethnic favoritism), but also embezzlement, bribery, and extortion.

(Cartier-Bresson 1997, 440)\n\nHere, corruption can manifest itself through patron-client relations in the form of a vertical network, or through a horizontal network, connecting decision-makers beyond their public offices (Stefes 2003, 123). Under these conditions, when political decision-makers are able to organize corruption (in terms of rent-seeking) through legislation and through patronage in the state apparatus, society is very rarely able to make a difference for its own advantage. In other words, institutions facilitate corrupt exchanges, by producing stable expectations for the parties involved (Cartier-Bresson 1997). In contrast to occasional market corruption as evidenced in “Context A,” corruption in “Context B” demonstrates a kind of stability, which rests on a peculiar mix of asymmetrical power and solidarity, implicit and actual coercion, as well as an emphasis on mutual benefits and voluntarism (Roniger 1994, 4 [cited in Stefes 2006, 19]). As a result, corruption is even able to adapt to revolutionary changes like those occurring as a result of regime collapse. This fact further stimulates interest in studying the qualitative, rather than quantitative, changes in corruption during societal transformation processes. In this study, corruption will be analyzed according to the parameters of “Context B.” In order to systematize “corruption clusters” on the political level, in chapters 2.5 and 5, a model of the system of corruption that demonstrates the role of different mechanisms of corruption for the hybridity of political regimes is provided. 2.3.2.\n\nDistinguishing relevant forms of corruption\n\nFor this study, several forms of corruption are of particular interest. Analytically, this work differentiates between high political and low administrative corruption, grand and petty corruption, corruption on the input and output side(s) of political processes as well as monetary and non-monetary forms of corruption.\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING CORRUPTION\n\n23\n\nPolitical (“grand”) corruption in this research is distinguished from administrative (“petty”) corruption (Stefes 2006; Stykow 2004; von Soest 2013) (Figure 3, vertical axis). Even though the distinction between petty and grand corruption is ambiguous, it is important to separate them in analytical terms: petty corruption is what citizens experience daily, in their encounter with public administration and when using public services. It occurs in the law implementation process and involves lower-level officials and smaller amounts of bribes. In contrast, political corruption usually occurs at the higher levels of the government and within varying parts of the state apparatus, targeting the process of law formulation (input legitimacy). Political corruption, therefore, represents more than a deviation from formal and written legal norms. According to Andvig and Fjeldstad: Political corruption is when rulers abuse laws and regulations, or sidestep, ignore and tailor laws and regulations to benefit their private interests. (2001, 11)\n\nFigure 3:\n\nDimensions of corruption Corruption in the lower levels of the policy implementation process (output legitimacy) administrative corruption Monetary tools\n\npetty corruption\n\nNon-monetary tools corruption form: nepotism, patronage, particularism, clientelism, patrimonialism\n\ncorruption form: bribery (active), extortion (passive) Corruption in the the policy formulation process (input legitimacy) grand corruption political corruption\n\nSource: Author’s depiction, relying on Stykow (2004).\n\nIn addition to distinguishing types of corruption by actor (highand low-level politicians) and goal (law implementation or law\n\n24\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\nformulation process), it is also important to distinguish by method or tool utilized (Figure 3, horizontal axis). In the narrow sense, corruption is always associated with bribery, which entails “illegal payments to public officials in return for receiving special privileges and/or services that the briber is not entitled to” (Stefes 2006, 15). This kind of corrupt activity usually refers to monetized corruption. However, this narrow concept is not sufficient for the analysis of corruption in transitioning post-communist countries with systemic corruption (“Context B”). In this study, the tools and methods of corruption are conceptualized more widely. As suggested by C. von Soest (2013) in his research on systemic corruption, acts of corruption have to be integrated into a larger conceptual framework, which also encompasses other features of personal rule. Accordingly, “systemic corruption is an expression of personalised politics” and it is embedded in a web of personal or neo-patrimonial relations (von Soest 2013).\n\n2.4.\n\nCorruption as an umbrella concept\n\nThere is a broad variety of concepts, related to corruption, that scholars use to describe corruption-based hybrid regimes, and in particular Ukraine. These include preventive and coercive clientelism (Matsiyevsky 2016), oligarchic neopatrimonialism (Fisun 2012), patronal politics (Hale 2015), blackmail state (Darden 2008), and machine politics (D’Anieri 2005) among others. What all epithets share is an emphasis on the importance of the role of corruption; however, they do not elaborate a clear interdependency between all these concepts and corruption. Conceptual clarification is needed in order to correctly identify the mechanisms of corruption and distinguish them from other forms of informal politics. Rothstein and Varraich treat corruption as an “umbrella concept” that links multiple interrelated concepts such as patrimonialism, patronage, clientelism, since they share a sort of family resemblance to corruption (Varraich 2014; Rothstein and Varraich 2014, 2017) (see Figure 4). At the same time, however, these are established concepts and need to be differentiated.\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING CORRUPTION Figure 4:\n\n25\n\nCorruption as the connecting core\n\nClientelism Blat\n\nPatronage\n\nState Capture\n\nCorruption\n\nKruhova poruka\n\nPatrimonialism Nepotism\n\nSource: Author’s adapted depiction, based on Varraich 2014; Rothstein and Varraich 2014, 2017.\n\nOn this basis, conceptual clarification, based on the work of Varraich and Rothstein (2014, 2017), is provided below. However, the overviews are modified and include supplementary concepts, relevant to the specific context of Ukraine. The focus of this conceptual work will be on the functions of corruption-related phenomena (Debiel and Gawrich 2013). 2.4.1.\n\nParticularism and conflict of interest\n\nRothstein and Varraich define particularism as a “central ingredient of corruption” (Rothstein and Varraich 2014, 64). The opposites of particularism are impersonal rule (North, Wallis and Weingast 2009), ethical universalism (Mungiu-Pippidi 2006), or impartiality (Rothstein and Teorell 2008). Thus, in Figure 4, particularism is depicted as the broader context for clientelism, patronage and patrimonialism. All these phenomena can be described as corruption if the three core criteria from the previous chapter are met. Thus,\n\n26\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\ncorruption always means particularistic behavior, but particularism is not always corruption. The stage preceding particularistic exchange is conflict of interest. Rothstein and Varraich indicate that “the root of conflict of interest is the distortion of impartiality” (Rothstein and Varraich 2014, 64). While all concepts mentioned above, including corruption, denote action, conflict of interest delineates a situation in which there is a risk for a particularistic exchange to unfold.6 Although a conflict of interest per se is not wrong, the action which is subsequently taken may lead to corruption. In order to differentiate situations, in which there is only a risk of corruption, from those in which corruption already exists, the terms “potential” and “real” conflict of interest are useful (Hughes and Huss 2017, 18). Corruption occurs in the event of a genuine conflict of interest, when the potential for the private interests of the involved officials to affect impartiality in decision-making is not resolved. Blat as a regional example of particularism The practice of blat in the (former) Soviet Union serves as a very good example to illustrate the ambiguity of particularism in a gray zone between corruption and the legitimate use of social capital. Although blat usually refers to petty and everyday corruption, which is not explicitly the subject of this study, it is important to explain this region-specific, cultural feature, since—as Martin Carrier states—“institutional history shapes individual and collective preferences, and consequently affects perceptions” (Carrier 2012, 88). In other words, understanding this informal practice as a cultural background is useful to illuminating the pervasiveness of corruption on the political level.\n\n6\n\nThe International Encyclopaedia of Ethics defines conflict of interest as “a situation in which some person (whether an individual or corporate body) stands in a certain relationship to one or more decisions. … On the standard view, a person has a conflict of interest if, and only if, that person (a) is in a relationship with another requiring the exercise of judgment on the other’s behalf and (b) has a (“secondary,” “unusual,” or “adverse”) interest tending to interfere with the proper exercise of such judgment” (cited in: Rothstein and Varraich 2014, 63).\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING CORRUPTION\n\n27\n\nLedeneva conducted the most prominent research to study this informal practice in the Soviet Union. She defines blat as: … the use of personal networks for obtaining goods and services in short supply and for circumventing formal procedures. Blat networks channelled an alternative currency—an informal exchange of favors—that introduced elements of the market into the planned economy and loosened up the rigid constraints of the political regime. (Ledeneva 2009, 257)\n\nAlthough blat is sometimes considered a corrupt practice, Ledeneva points out that such an assumption is misleading. Blat can be useful in gaining access to a decision-maker and perhaps to pay a bribe (Ledeneva 2009, 262), which makes blat a precursor of corruption. In the economy of shortage, in order to survive and solve daily problems, blat networks had an important function to obtain “food, goods, and services that people were entitled to have” (Ledeneva 2009, 259). However, the author also states that these “grassroots networks that balanced the rigidity of [the] authoritarian regime” were not able to channel their power into the creation of a robust civil society in the post-Soviet period, which resulted in the disproportionate influence of “networks of power” (Ledeneva 2009, 267). By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, blat was widespread among political elites. This informal practice led to the exclusion of ordinary people from the rights and opportunities new market economies offered (Ledeneva 2009, 266). Blat had the following implications for the functioning of the networks of power: Networks on the top operate on familiar principles of informality that impose certain norms of reciprocity and informal constraints on people in official positions: blurred boundaries between friendship and the use of friendship; helping friends at the expense of public/corporate resources or access; recruitment into networks according to a particular logic—it could be loyalty, dependence or transgression/compromised recruit—rather than the logic of competition and professionalism. (Ledeneva 2009, 269)\n\nA prominent researcher on blat in Ukraine, Tetiana Kostiuchenko defines it “as the use of interpersonal connections for obtaining services and ‘getting things done’ when interacting with institutions and authorities” (Kostiuchenko 2018, 57–58). Her sociological\n\n28\n\nCORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES\n\nfindings suggest that there are considerable differences in understandings and practices of blat between those born in the Soviet Union and subsequent generations of Ukrainians (Kostiuchenko 2018, 57–58). 2.4.2.\n\nClientelism\n\nVarraich relies on the widespread definition of political clientelism in Hopkin, namely, “the distribution of selective benefits to individuals or clearly defined groups in exchange for political support” (Hopkin 2006, 2, cited in Varraich 2014, 5). This definition allows the derivation of two characteristic conditions of clientelism that will be discussed below: reciprocity and trust. Another condition, often referenced as a central one in existing research, is asymmetry of power. However, recent research on clientelism shows that this condition can be questioned. According to Hopkin’s definition, reciprocity is the central element of clientelism: on one side is the delivery of goods or services, which pay for political support, mostly in the form of voting, at the opposite end. A prerequisite for clientelism is the existence of trust between both parties, since there is a time difference in the exchange. Trust can be built through iteration of the exchange. Despite reciprocity and mutual benefit from the exchange, clientelism is based on asymmetrical power relations. Matsiyevsky (2016, 134) derives this characteristic from an argument relating to the political monopoly on resources: A patron needs to have access to resources before he is able to divide them in a particularistic way. Thus, political monopoly is immanent to clientelism. The stronger the political monopoly on resources, the higher the power position of the patron in the hierarchy and the weaker the competition will be. Kettering (1988, 425) likewise argues that, despite reciprocity, clientelism is an unequal and vertical relationship, where the patron is the superior and the client, the inferior. Kettering defines asymmetry of power "
