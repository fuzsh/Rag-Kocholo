        "text": "The first Azarov government (Ukrainian: Перший уряд Миколи Азарова, Russian: Первое правительство Николая Азарова) was Ukraine's cabinet from its appointment on March 11, 2010 until its dissolution on December 3, 2012. It continued to serve as a caretaker government[1] until 24 December 2012, when the second Azarov government was appointed by president Viktor Yanukovych.[2]\n\nThe cabinet was formed as part of the \"Stability and Reform\" coalition between the Party of Regions, Lytvyn Bloc and the Communist Party of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament. The government was led by prime minister Mykola Azarov, who succeeded the ousted second Tymoshenko government led by ex-prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The Azarov government worked in cooperation with President Yanukovych.\n\nA November 2010 Razumkov Centre nationwide survey showed that only 13.2 percent of respondents fully supported the Azarov Government while 45 percent stated they did not.[3]"
