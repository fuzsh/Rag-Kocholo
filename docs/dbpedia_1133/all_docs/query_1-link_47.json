        "text": "Ukrainian protesters have lifted a blockade of Inter TV, a news channel in Kiev attacked by arsonists for being allegedly pro-Russian.\n\nOne protester, a volunteer soldier called Olexiy Seredyuk, told the BBC that the blockade would resume in five days' time if Inter TV reneged on a pledge to \"change its news content\".\n\nA statement (in Russian), external from Inter TV said there was no such agreement but confirmed that the blockade was over.\n\nStaff fled a blaze at the TV on Sunday.\n\nPresident Petro Poroshenko has ordered Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate the arson attack, which drew condemnation from the EU, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the International and European Federation of Journalists (IFJ/EFJ)., external\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said a \"free and independent media is essential\" in a democracy, and \"violence is an unacceptable response to a disagreement over editorial policy\".\n\nUkrainian officials accuse Russia of arming pro-Russian separatists who control a swathe of eastern Ukraine, and of spreading propaganda in the media.\n\nInter TV said some of its staff needed hospital treatment for smoke inhalation and one suffered a broken leg after fleeing the fire on Sunday.\n\nA metal fence was erected outside the TV offices, daubed with the slogans \"Burn, Inter, burn!\" and \"Russia is here!\"\n\nProtesters' tents have been removed from the scene, but piles of tyres remain there.\n\nOlexiy Seredyuk, of the Ukrainian volunteer battalion Svyataya Maria (Holy Mary), said the activists had also told Inter TV to sack a Russian senior news editor, Igor Shuvalov.\n\nBut the Inter TV statement said there had been no negotiations with the protesters. Those who caused the fire in Sunday were \"terrorists\", it said, demanding that they be prosecuted.\n\nThe blockade ended, Inter TV said, after pressure from Ukrainian security forces, public opinion and the actions of journalists. The channel had continued broadcasting despite the disruption by activists."
