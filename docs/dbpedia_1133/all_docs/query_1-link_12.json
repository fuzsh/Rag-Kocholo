        "text": "Young journalists-turned-politicians lost a court case on Sep. 30 as they sought to challenge an official registration for an oligarch to run in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election.\n\nThe oligarch in question, former deputy\n\nPrime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovsky, has lived in Monaco in the past\n\nfew years. Under Ukraine’s law, only Ukrainians who have lived\n\nin the country permanently for the past five years are allowed to run\n\nfor parliament.\n\n“It is clear the rule of law isn’t\n\nworking in Ukraine,” said prominent journalist Serhiy Leshchenko,\n\nwho is running in parliamentary election for the first time. “I am\n\nafraid some high ranking Ukrainian officials ordered to\n\nregister Khoroshkovsky as part of an unofficial agreement with former\n\nregionals (Party of Regions members).”\n\nValeriy Khoroshovsky, an ex-prime minister who fled Ukraine for Monaco after a falling out with ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, is back in Ukraine and running for parliament. The election is on Oct. 26.\n\nKhoroshkovsky is one of Ukraine’s\n\nrichest men. He recently returned home to run in the Oct. 26\n\nparliamentary election on the party list for Sylna Ukraina headed by\n\nanother mogu, ex-Deputy Prime Minister Sergiy Tigipko.\n\nKhoroshkovsky made his fortune in the\n\nmetallurgy and media sectors, among others. He served as deputy prime\n\nminister between February 2012 and December 2012 under now ousted\n\nPresident Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nFormer journalists running on the party\n\nlist of Ukrainian President Petro Proshenko, Leshchenko and Mustafa\n\nNayyem, filed a complaint to the Kyiv Appelate Administrative Court\n\nstating that Khoroshkovsky’s registration was in violations of the\n\nUkrainian law.\n\nRecords from the Ukrainian border\n\nservice provided by the plaintiffs showed that Khoroshkovsky left\n\nUkraine in December 2012 after leaving office and did not return\n\nuntil September 2014.\n\nHowever, journalist lost the case as\n\nthe oligarch was allowed by court to run for parliament.\n\nKhoroshkovsky did not attend the\n\nproceedings, but sent lawyers from the Kyiv Legal Company he owns to\n\nrepresent them. The registration documents presented to the\n\nCentral Election Committee by Khoroshkovsky first stated he was\n\nunemployed before later stating he was employed by the Kyiv Legal\n\nCompany and had been on a business trip abroad for the time in\n\nquestion.\n\nYaroslav Porokhnyak, one of the men\n\nrepresenting Khoroshkovsky, said he had not seen the contradictory\n\ndocuments before that day.\n\nSvetlana Chernyuk from the Central\n\nElection Committee’s legal department defended the Committee’s\n\ndecision to approve Khoroshkovsky’s candidacy stating that his\n\ndocuments were in order.\n\nAfter a long recess the three judges in\n\nthe case ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to show that\n\nKhoroshkovsky’s election registration documents were not in order.\n\nLeshchenko and Nayyem vowed to appeal the decision.\n\n“The decision shows you that to the\n\nstate and (presidential) administration an oligarch matters more than\n\njournalists,” said their lawyer Tatyana Kozachenko."
