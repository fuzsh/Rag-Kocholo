President Viktor Yanukovych announced the appointment of Yuriy Kolobov as finance minister. He replaces Valeriy Khoroshkovsky who held the position for one month before becoming first deputy prime minister on February 22.

Brad Wells: Kolobovâ€™s appointment to the cabinet is yet another move in the last month by Yanukovych to strengthen his influence over the body and place loyal people in key positions (notably, following the appointments of Khoroshkovsky, Defense Minister Dmytro Salamatin on Feb. 8, and Security Service Chairman Ihor Kalinin on Feb. 3). We do not expect any change in fiscal policy as a result of this move.
