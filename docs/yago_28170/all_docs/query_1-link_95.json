The baby's grandmother said \"around 7:00 AM,\" but Gauricus and Junctinus were the astrologers of the wife and mother, so presumably had the correct time. Junctinus gave 5:24 AM, with an MC of 8 Capricorn 30, ASC 10 Aries27, Moon 27 Aries51. Harvey printed a chart in Nativitas I for 5:51 AM with an MC of 16 Capricorn, ASC 5 Taurus and Moon 28 Aries 26.\n\nIn the Astrological Journal January/2000, Jaroslav Mixa gives a birthplace of Fontainebleau.\n\nBarbault quotes the Journal of Louise de Savoie for a location of Versailles, where Britannica gives St. Germain en Laye.\n\nPenfield Collection and Taeger both quotes NN for 5:00 AM, however NN No.535 has 7:15 AM LMT on March 31 OS \"according to Gauricus.\"\n\nDesmond Seward's biography \"Prince of the Renaissance\" has only the year, 1519.\n\nMixa quotes Comitis de Flisco in \"Decas de Fato,\" Frankfurt, 1663, p.51 for a given time of 7:09 AM LAT: March 30, 1519 plus 19:09 = 7:09 of the next day, with an MC of 3 Aquarius 09 and ASC of 3 Gemini. He states that a similar chart is printed in \"Collectio Genitutarum\" by John Gadbury, 1662.\n\nSy Scholfield quotes 7pm in \"Histoire de la Maison Royale de France, et des grands officiers de la Couronne\" by Anselme de Sainte-Marie, Ange de Sainte-Rosalie (libr. associés, 1726), p. 133: \"Henry II. du nom, roy de France, naquit au chateau de S. Germain en Laye le jeudi d'apres le troisieme dimanche de careme 31. mars 1518. sur les sept heures du soir...\"\n\nCategories\n\nTraits : Personality : Ambitious\n\nTraits : Personality : Bigot (Religious bias)\n\nTraits : Personality : Persistent\n\nDiagnoses : Body Part Problems : Accident/Injury (Jousting wound)\n\nDiagnoses : Psychological : Depression (Melancholy temperament)\n\nFamily : Relationship : Mate - Noted (Catherine de Medicis)\n\nFamily : Parenting : Kids 1-3 (Three)"
