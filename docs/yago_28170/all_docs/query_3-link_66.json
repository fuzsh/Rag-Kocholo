        "text": "Born into nobility, Phillippe-Emmanuel of Lorraine owed his rise to power to the protection of Henry III, who married his sister, Louise of Lorraine. The king favoured his marriage to Marie of Luxemburg, heiress to the rich appanage of the Penthièvre and consequently descendent of the Dukes of Brittany. Moreover, her father was the governor of Brittany between 1562 and 1569. Henry III accorded him the government of Brittany in 1582 when he was only 24 years old because he was hoping to be able to rely upon a loyal ally in Brittany during the troubling times of civil war.\n\nBut Mercoeur was equally a cousin of the Guises, the youngest branch of the Lorraine family and organisers of the Catholic League. The assassination of the Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Lorraine under the orders of Henry III on December 23rd 1588, led Mercoeur to gradually join the opposing side namely the Catholic League and in turn make Brittany enter the civil war. Indeed in general, Brittany followed its governor and joined the Catholic League camp, with a few noteworthy exceptions, such as Rennes, Vitré and Brest."
