        "text": "Henri III (September 19, 1551 – August 2, 1589) was King of France from 1574 until his assassination in 1589, as well as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1573 to 1575.\n\nPrince Henri de Valois of France was born at the royal Château de Fontainebleau, the fourth son of King Henri II of France and Catherine de’ Medici. Catherine was born in Florence to Lorenzo de’ Medici, Duke of Urbino, and Madeleine de La Tour d’Auvergne.\n\nIn 1533, at the age of 14, Catherine married Prince Henri, the second son of King François I and Claude de Valois of France, Duchess of Brittany, the eldest daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany.\n\nPrince Henri would become Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother François in 1536. Catherine’s marriage was arranged by her uncle Pope Clement VII. During his reign, King Henri II excluded Catherine from state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him.\n\nPrince Henri de Valois of France was a grandson of King François I of France and Claude de Valois of France, Duchess of Brittany His older brothers were King François II of France, King Charles IX of France, and Prince Louis de Valois of France. Prince Henri was made Duke of Angoulême and Duke of Orléans in 1560, then Duke of Anjou in 1566.\n\nAs the fourth son of King Henri II of France, Prince Henri was not expected to inherit the French throne and thus was a good candidate for the vacant throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he was elected monarch in 1573. During his brief rule, he signed the Henrician Articles into law, recognizing the szlachta’s right to freely elect their monarch.\n\nSexuality\n\nReports that Prince Henri engaged in same-sex relations with his court favourites, known as the mignons, date back to his own time. He was known to have enjoyed intense relationships with them. The scholar Louis Crompton maintains that all of the contemporary rumours were true.\n\nSome modern historians dispute this. Jean-Francois Solnon, Nicolas Le Roux and Jacqueline Boucher have noted that Henri had many famous mistresses, that he was well known for his taste in beautiful women, and that no male sex partners have been identified.\n\nThey have concluded that the idea he was homosexual was promoted by his political opponents (both Protestant and Catholic) who used his dislike of war and hunting to depict him as effeminate and undermine his reputation with the French people.\n\nThe portrait of a self-indulgent sodomite, incapable of fathering an heir to the throne, proved useful in efforts by the Catholic League to secure the succession for Cardinal Charles de Bourbon after 1585.\n\nMarriage\n\nPrincess Louise of Lorraine was the third daughter and youngest child born to Nicholas of Lorraine, Duke of Mercœur, and his first wife, Countess Margaret of Egmont (1517–1554). She was the only surviving child of her parents; her older siblings, two sisters and one brother, died in infancy.\n\nLouise’s mother died shortly before her first birthday in 1554, and her father quickly remarried, in 1555, Princess Joanna of Savoy-Nemours (1532–1568).\n\nPrincess Louise of Lorraine would first meet Prince Henri in the autumn of 1573, when Henri, Duke of Anjou, was on his way to Krakow, as the new King Henryk of Poland-Lithuania. She attracted Henri’s interest during a celebration in honor of Henri’s election as King of Poland-Lithuania .\n\nFollowing the death of Charles IX of France on May 30, 1574, King Henryk of Poland-Lithuania succeeded him under the name of King Henri III of France and he returned clandestinely to France.\n\nLouise was with her family traveling to Reims for Henri’s coronation, when Philippe Hurault de Cheverny and Michel Du Guast arrived to make Henri’s marriage proposal.\n\nLouise and Henri’s wedding took place at the Cathedral of Reims in a ceremony celebrated by Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon two days after Henri’s coronation, February 15, 1575. At the end of the month, the new King and Queen of France made their official entry into Paris.\n\nFrance was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion, and Henri’s authority was undermined by violent political factions funded by foreign powers: the Catholic League (supported by King Felipe II of Spain and Pope Gregory XIII), the Protestant Huguenots (supported by Queen Elizabeth I of England and the Dutch) and the Malcontents (led by Henri’s own brother the Prince François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon, a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king). King Henri III was himself a politique, arguing that a strong and centralised yet religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse.\n\nAfter the death of Henri’s younger brother François, Duke of Anjou, and when it became apparent that King Henri III would not produce an heir, the Wars of Religion developed into a succession crisis, the War of the Three Henry’s.\n\nKing Henri III’s legitimate heir was his distant cousin, King Henri III of Navarre, a Protestant. The Catholic League, led by Henri I, Duke of Guise, sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic Charles, Cardinal of Bourbon, as Henri III’s heir.\n\nIn 1589, Jacques Clément, a Catholic fanatic, murdered King Henri III. He was succeeded by the King Henri III of Navarre who, as King Henri IV, assumed the throne of France after converting to Catholicism, as the first French king of the House of Bourbon.\n\nThe Bourbon succession\n\nAt the time of the accession of Henri III, upon the death of his brother, Charles IX on May 30, 1574, France was plagued by the Wars of Religion, and Henri III’s authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers: the Catholic League (supported by Spain and the Pope), the Protestant Huguenots (supported by England and the Dutch) and the Malcontents, led by Henri III’s own brother, the Duke of Alençon, which was a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king. Henri III was himself a politique, arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse.\n\nHenri III, King of France.\n\nHe was expected to produce an heir after he married Louise of Lorraine, age 21, on February 1575, no issue resulted from their union. Louise was the third daughter and youngest child of Nicholas of Lorraine, Duke of Mercœur, and Countess Marguerite d’Egmont. However, as early as the death of François, Duke of Anjou, brother of Henri III of France, in 1584, the succession of Henri of Navarre, Head of the House of Bourbon, had been a likely eventuality. Henri III was the sole remaining representative of the House of Valois, and he was still childless.\n\nReports that Henri III engaged in same-sex relations with his court favourites, known as the mignons, date back to his own time. Certainly he enjoyed intense relationships with them. The scholar Louis Crompton maintains that all of the contemporary rumours were true. Some modern historians dispute this. Jean-Francois Solnon, Nicolas Le Roux, and Jacqueline Boucher have noted that Henri III had many famous mistresses, that he was well known for his taste in beautiful women, and that no male sex partners have been identified. They have concluded that the idea he was homosexual was promoted by his political opponents (both Protestant and Catholic) who used his dislike of war and hunting to depict him as effeminate and undermine his reputation with the French people.\n\nLouise of Lorraine\n\nThe laws of succession designated the head of the next branch of the Capetian family as heir presumptive. Normally this would not have been controversial; but the 16th century was a period of religious discord in France, and Henri of Navarre was the chief of the Protestant party and he was also next in line to the French throne.\n\nThis was an unacceptable choice for Catholic France which was considered the eldest daughter of the Church; and anointing the king implied that he must belong to the Catholic faith. Ultra-Catholics rejected Henri of Navarre as a relapsed heretic; they would not accept him even if he converted. Moderate Catholics supported Navarre, provided that he would convert.\n\nHow did Henri of Navarre derive his claim to the French throne? And the objection to his claim was not predicated solely on religious reasons, but also upon genealogical issues.\n\nBourbon claim to the throne\n\nHenri of Navarre was descended through his father from King Louis IX of France, via Robert, Count of Clermont (d. 1317), the sixth and youngest son of Louis IX, and the only son besides Philippe III to produce a surviving line. Robert married Beatrix of Bourbon and assumed the title of sire de Bourbon. Bourbon was elevated into a duchy for Robert’s son Louis, who became the first Duke of Bourbon.\n\nAt the death of Charles IV, Duke of Alençon in 1525, all cadet branches of the House of Valois had become extinct, with the only remaining Valois being the royal family itself. The chief of the Bourbons became the first prince of the blood, the closest to the succession to the throne should the immediate family of the king become extinct. At the death of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon in 1527, the Vendôme branch of the House of Bourbon became the senior line of the family. At that time, represented by Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme. His son Antoine de Bourbon was the King of Navarrethrough his marriage (jure uxoris) to Queen Jeanne III of Navarre. Antoine’s son, Prince Henri of Navarre, inherited the throne of Navarre on his death from an arquebus wound at the siege of Rouen in 1562.\n\nDespite meeting the criteria for the crown under the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, the legitimacy of Henri of Navarre’s claim to the throne was still questioned, however. In similar cases, the throne had earlier passed to successors with a much closer blood link to the throne. Louis XII had succeeded Charles VIII as his second cousin once removed in the male line. François I had succeeded Louis XII as his cousin five times removed in the male line. The successions were legally unproblematic because consanguinity was acknowledged in law to the tenth degree.\n\nHenri of Navarre\n\nHenri of Navarre, on the other hand, could claim only an agnatic relationship to Henri III in the twenty-second degree. When Henri of Navarre had become the heir presumptive to the throne in 1584, on the death of François, Duke of Anjou, polemicist Jean Boucher had been among those who protested that such a distance in blood meant Henri of Navarre’s claim to the throne had effectively lapsed and that therefore the French States-General had the right to elect a new king."
