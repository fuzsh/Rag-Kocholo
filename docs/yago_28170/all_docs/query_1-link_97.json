        "meta_description": "This article examines a major figure of the court of Louis XIV who has never received a full academic study. It demonstrates how a royal favourite in a same-sex context in the early modern period can be analysed in a similar manner to more well-known royal mistresses, or “maîtresses en titre”. It presents a thorough portrait of Prince Philippe of Lorraine, better known as the Chevalier de Lorraine, in the full context of his family (a cadet branch of the princely house of Lorraine), his friends (the household of Monsieur, Philippe, Duke of Orléans, brother of the king), and court culture more generally at the end of the seventeenth century. Such an analysis demonstrates a number of things: that, contrary to much recent scholarship on homosexual identities and relationships in the early modern period, long-term partnerships did exist, although they were unorthodox; and that, like other royal favourites, the Chevalier de Lorraine maintained his position at the top of a powerful court hierarchy through both the support of his family and a prominent patronage network. Patronage in particular is examined, citing both usages of clientage and brokerage, as the chief means for self-enrichment and survival at the court of France in this period. By the end of his life, the Chevalier de Lorraine had become one of the most successful courtiers due to the combined factors of his princely birth and continued support of this family, his long-term cultivation of his position as “maître en titre” of Monsieur, and the effective management of a large patronage network.",

        "text": "Introducing the male favourite\n\n38 Cosnac 1852, II, p. 359.\n\nso long as the Chevalier wished to dream of the gloire of Monsieur, of his interests, and to distance him from trifles [la bagatelle], it would not be perhaps a disadvantageous thing that there would be a man who would have some power over his spirit. Madame demonstrated to me that she believed to have enough control over the spirit of the Chevalier, to oblige him to act in good conduct.\n\n13Madame would soon find herself seriously mistaken. As the relationship progressed it was the Chevalier de Lorraine who was running the Palais-Royal and Saint-Cloud, Monsieur’s two primary residences. He was thus by implication in charge of one of the largest patronage networks in all of France, the apanage of Orléans.\n\nThe rise to prominence\n\nFavourite\n\n36If the relationship was therefore common knowledge in courtly and diplomatic circles, where its sexual nature per se did not seem to matter, what about the broader “public”? Madame herself relates a song sung in Paris about her late husband in a letter to her Aunt Sophie, which – although it does not mention the Chevalier or any of the other favourites by name – leaves no doubt that the Parisian public were well aware of Monsieur’s tastes. After a verse lampooning the king’s secret marriage to Madame de Maintenon, it continues:\n\nPhilippe n’est pas de ce goût:\n\nC’est malgré lui qu’il est époux.\n\nS’il tâte jamais du veuvage,\n\nPour pleinement vivre à son gré,\n\nNous le verrons avec un page\n\n161 Quoted in Van der Cruysse 1988, p. 420: Philippe is not of this preference: / It is despite himself (...)\n\nBientôt à Saint-Cloud retiré.\n\nPatronage and brokerage\n\nAll in the family\n\nConclusion\n\n49By looking at the relationship between Philippe, Duke of Orléans, and Philippe, Chevalier de Lorraine, we can see clearly the latter’s success as a princely favourite, as a patron and broker, and as contributor to his family’s overall success at court and in society. The Chevalier de Lorraine was only one member of a large clan of foreign princes, but he (along with his brother, Armagnac) was undoubtedly the most successful, and looked to, even by his senior cousins, as head of the cadet branches of the House of Lorraine in France, and indeed, as one of the primary links to the head of their clan, the Duke of Lorraine himself. Through status given by birth, the Chevalier had easy access to the court and its royal masters. Using his looks, charm and skill, however, he established himself as a trustworthy favourite, obtained lucrative posts, and operated a successful network of patronage and brokerage for over four decades. He facilitated unofficial links between the king and his courtiers, the court and the government, and between France and Lorraine. Arriving at court in the precarious position of inherited debt and an uncertain career, he left behind a position of unchallenged dominance and fiscal health that maintained his family – and indeed, the princes étrangers as a group – at the top of the French court hierarchy for the remainder of the Ancien Régime.\n\n50Whether or not we can detect in this relationship resonances of a modern homosexual identity, there is nevertheless a constancy of four decades that is indubitable and noteworthy. And although certainly talked about spuriously by the gossips of Europe, we have seen that the relationship caused more sparks over the appropriateness of a single favourite as opposed to many, questions of disparity in rank, and the excessive dispersal of royal funds, and not specifically over a sexual relationship between two men. As a relationship built on trust, love, sex, companionship and patronage power, and in its fairly public nature, both at court and in the country, Monsieur’s “singular favourite” can deservedly be placed among the great royal favourites of early modern France, a true “maître en titre”."
