        "text": "Château de Chenonceau is undoubtedly tops for exterior architecture and gardens. I absolutely love the architectural design of Château de Chenonceau in the Loire Valley. The expanse of the Château that spans the River Cher constitutes the great gallery/hall, used as used as a ballroom. It is 60 meters by 6 meters (approximately 197 feet by 20 feet) and has 18 windows. This gallery spans the river that was the line of demarcation between occupied France and free France during World War II.\n\nThe opulence inside is sometimes overwhelming as you can see in the following photographs. The first is of the Five Queens Bedroom which is lined in 16th century Flemish tapestry.\n\nThe next bedroom is Louise de Lorraine’s. Black walls made this room oppressive! After the assignation of Henry II, Louise retreated here in 1589 for meditation and prayer. She has been dubbed the White Queen as mourning wear of this period was typically white.\n\nDiane de Poitiers was King Henry II favorite lady but when Henry was killed in battle, his Queen Catherine de Medici forced Diane to move to Chaumont. Note the H and C in the fireplace carvings for Henry and Catherine. When enter twined they form a D for Diane.\n\nFrançois I bedroom has a beautiful 16th century Italian cabinet which was a wedding gift to Francoise II and Mary Stewart.\n\nLouis XIV’s Drawing Room, with a portrait of Louis XV.\n\nChateau de Chenonceau has two beautiful gardens, one for each of the women in its life.\n\n<< Back to Loire Chateaux"
