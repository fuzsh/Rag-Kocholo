In 1589 their son is 14 years old.\n\nWhat happens when Henry III is assassinated?\n\nWho would support Henry III's heir? Would there be a regency council?\n\nWould Henry of Navarre seize the throne? If so, what would he do with the son?\n\nThis son is undisputed heir to the throne of France.\n\nThe regency would be appointed and formally the greatest right to this position belongs to Henry of Navarre. In 1589 both Henries are united against the Catholic League so unless somehow the League manages to capture the young prince Henry is the regent and the war is going on. People like Marshal Biron are joining the royal party and the League is in a worse political situation than in OTL after HIII was killed because there is a legitimate king instead of the questionable (religion wise) pretender. The same goes for the strategic situation: in OTL after assassination many of the Catholic lords accompanying HIII refused to recognize HIV and siege of Paris was abandoned. Now there is no dissension and Paris is taken or forced to capitulate in 1589. The most rabid leaders of the League are executed (in OTL at his had been done later by the Duke of Mayenne) and after receiving some beating the leading aristocrats are going to negotiate.\n\nIn this scenario the last thing that Henry of Navarre wants is an early death of his royal nephew because he is going to be accused in it. He is a Kung of Navarre, the Regent and the most influential person in France. Probably conversion still makes political sense but the Huguenots are getting something close to Edict of Nantes.\n\nPOD: Henry III and Louise de Lorraine have a wedding night baby.

But with Philip of Spain probably still pushing his daughter as an heir to France, residuals of the Catholic League, and the king being locked out of Paris, Queen Louise would look for help from Henry of Navarre. With all of these problems, Henry of Navarre would be a regent, or co-regent with Louise until the king is officially crowned in Paris and the royal authority is restored.\n\nThe nobility of France would probably have the same happy reaction they had in the IOTL when King Henri was assassinated.

HIII was kicked out of Paris, had a big part of France in an open rebellion against him and found that his own resources are not adequate for the task of defeating the League. These problems would not disappear for the 14 years old boy and he would need troops, loyal commanders and experienced advisors. His uncle is in the best position to become power behind the throne both because he is the closest male relative and he does have a power and political skills. His grandmother is dead, his mother is not a political figure backed by a strong party (or Mazarin-like figure) so who is there capable of keeping Uncle Henry away from the court?\n\nBeing 14 the new king would not need a formal regency (if maturity is declared at 13 as for LXIV) but an idea that Henry of Navarre would be kept far away completely ignores the fact that the civil war is going on and the King of Navarre was an ally of his father against the League and, besides having a army of his own, is the best general available to him.

The OTL one here would be much reduced as one of his major components was the fact who Henry III had NO son and the Protestant Navarre was the next-in-line\n\nWhat civil war? The OTL one here would be much reduced as one of his major components was the fact who Henry III had NO son and the Protestant Navarre was the next-in-line\n\nThere was still a lot of hate between Henri III and the Guises. It goes back to Mary, Queen of Scots and her relatives dominating the reign of Francois II and even before then where Catherine de Medici felt disrespected and insulted by Queen Mary and her relatives. Queen Catherine continually tried to get rid of the Guises by various means and Henri, Duke of Guise made it worse by developing a relationship with Princess Marguerite, in which she wanted to marry him. No one wanted to see them have so much power again.\n\nThe Guises also had the help of Philip of Spain to destabilized France, make King Henri look bad, and make things difficult for him. The civil war was still going to exist because the new king was the son of Henri III and I am sure there would have been no love lost between them, despite him being a Catholic. They would still need Henri of Navarre because he was a great general, had extensive knowledge of the situation, had his own kingdom, and he was next in line. I’m sure the Catholic League would use this against the new king.\n\nIf Henri III has a legitimate, Catholic son it's going to completely change the picture before the Way of Three Henrys even starts. Henri of Navarre isn't the heir, he lacks the quasi-immunity that his position as the only alternative to the Guise gave him OTL so he will be staying well away from potential Royalist ambushes and probably focusing on securing the Huguenot position as a state-within-the-state and making alliances with the English and German Protestants. Henri of Guise can't present himself as a potential heir - or even a potential Regent as he has no reason to think Henri III will die young - and will have to split his attention between fighting the Huguenots and building up his influence at Court. As long as Henri III doesn't openly break with the Catholic faction - and why should he? - it's likely there's no Holy Catholic League, no Day of the Barricades and ultimately no assassination.\n\nThat's likely to leave France in a similar situation as it was before the death of Charles IX, with the Huguenots in arms in the south-west but too weak to seriously threaten the crown, the Guises and the ultra-Catholics pushing for a military solution to the Huguenot problem and the King trying to avoid an all-out civil war which will bankrupt the country and leave the Spanish faction too powerful. Cue an endless round of uprisings and minor clashes ending in treaties which are either seen as too anti-Huguenot (triggering another round of uprisings) or too Huguenot-friendly (and end with the King being pressured into revoking them by the Catholic faction). Probably the Huguenots eventually lose and we get an early Huguenot migration to England and the Low Countries.\n\nOf course, if Henri III then does go and die and leave an under-age heir, all bets are off...\n\nNeither the League nor the Huguenots are going to disappear just because HIII has a son. The League is on the Spanish payroll and the war keeps going on until the issues are settled.\n\nHe did not have to push his daughter anywhere: his interest was in maintaining the civil war in France.\n\nThe league was already on Spanish payroll during Charles IX’s reign? Because if they were not then, they would have ZERO REASONS to doing it ATL (and payroll mean who they were doing what the King of Spain wanted/ordered NOT simply taking his money if he offered to finance them)\n\nThe league was already on Spanish payroll during Charles IX’s reign? Because if they were not then, they would have ZERO REASONS to doing it ATL (and payroll mean who they were doing what the King of Spain wanted/ordered NOT simply taking his money if he offered to finance them)\n\nIt was on Phillip’s payroll during the reign of HIII and Henry de Guise was quite open about requiring certain amount of money annually to keep fighting in France going. This is a fact and your opinion on the subject is not going to change it. The war cost money, especially when you are hiring the foreign mercenaries, but even the national contingents had to be paid.\n\nThe League wasn't formed until after Henri III's accession OTL - in fact it appears right around the time his son would be born TTL. Its leaders were taking subsidies from Philip II from the start, but the existence of a Catholic heir makes several major differences TTL\n\n- For Henri III, having an heir means the Henri of Navarre is a potential rival to his son rather than an heir to himself. OTL he left France to the Huguenot leader rather than see it fall to the Spanish faction. TTL, to secure his son's interests, he'll want to break the power of the Bourbon faction - and the Guise if they get too pushy.\n\n- For the League, the prospect of France \"falling to heresy\" via Henri of Navarre's succession is much weaker. They're going to focus more on keeping France Catholic and undivided, opposing both Huguenot influence at Court and Huguenot quasi-successionism in the south-west.\n\n- For Philip II, the Huguenots are weaker but the prospect of getting an outright puppet on the French throne is also weaker. Making the Guise a bigger threat to the Valois succession than the Bourbons is about the only way to push Henri III into cutting a deal with the Huguenots. So he may still fund the League - but he'll be funding it to fight the Huguenots, not push the Guise candidacy.\n\n- For Henri of Guise, his best path to power is making himself a better spare heir than Henri of Navarre - or eliminating the man outright. So he'll try to make himself the hero of the Catholics via his deeds against the Protestants while at the same time making himself indispensable at Court. Regent of France - should Henri III die young - is a real possibility.\n\nNote that Philip II's main motivation in funding the League was not to get his own candidate on the French throne - though that would have been a nice bonus - but to stop the Huguenots getting powerful enough to act on the European stage. He really doesn't want a Huguenot state on his border, nor Huguenot support for the English or Dutch. France stuck in an endless cycle of religious wars, with the Huguenots restricted to a few strongholds but refusing to go away, suits Spanish interests just fine - and TTL, Henri III is going to have to fall in with the plan."
