        "text": "Like so many other fascinating historic places, they often hide a dark past of political mishaps, rivalry, jealousy, revenge and great love affairs. As we explored the stunning Château de Chenonceau the plot of an intriguing Royal love triangle started to unfold.\n\nHenry II married Catherine de Medici, who was a member of the powerful ruling family of Florence, they were both fourteen years old when they got married.\n\nThe following year, he became romantically involved with the thirty-five-year-old widow, Diane de Poitier, who was beautiful, well educated and politically astute. She influenced many of the decisions made by the King who was madly in love with her. Her powers of persuasion did not take long to convince the King to gift her the charming Château de Chenonceau.\n\nHis wife Catherine was not impressed with Henry’s generosity, she wanted the Château for herself.\n\nDiane moved into the Château de Chenonceau and did not lose any time or spared any expenses on renovation work, during her time living at the Chateau she commissioned the famous bridge over the river Cher, so she could go hunting on the other side of the river.\n\nWhen Henry died following a jousting accident, Catherine forced Diane to exchange Chenonceau for the less glamorous and smaller Château Chaumont-sur-Loire.\n\nSoon after taking possession of Chenonceau Catherine de Medici embarked on a campaign of renovation and removing many of Diane’s ideas. Catherine wanted the mistress out of her life once and for all. Who would blame her for finally being able to put her own mark on Château de Chenonceau. . She made it into her favourite Royal residence, she hosted many lavish Royal parties at the Château.\n\nCatherine completed the construction of the arched bridge that straddles the Cher River which was started by Diane, giving its unique look that continuous to be enjoyed by so many visitors to the Chateau today.\n\nShe landscaped the gardens, making changes to Diane’s garden and refining the more intimate garden, which became known as Queen Catherine de Medici’s garden.\n\nThere is a lot to explore inside the Château, including all the bedrooms of former Royal residents. The present owners have done an incredible job of recreating and maintaining all the original features, furnishings. There is incredible attention to detail.\n\nYears later, the Chateau was passed on to Louise de Lorraine, following the assassination of her husband King Henry III (son of Catherine de Medici). Louise de Lorraine’s death in 1601 marked the end of Royal presence at Chenonceau.\n\nChenonceau during the World Wars I and II\n\nChenonceau was turned into a military hospital during the WWI.\n\nIt also played an important part during WWII when the gallery of the château was used by the French Resistance to smuggle people out of the occupied part of France.\n\nThe border between the occupied part of France was on the banks of the River Cher.\n\nTherefore, the main entrance to the château was under German occupation and the exit at the other side of the Gallery was under French control, facilitating the escape of many people towards freedom.\n\nChâteau de Chenonceau has been nicknamed Le Château des Femmes (the Women’s Castle) due to the women that have influenced its many transformations.\n\nThe flower displays at Château de Chenonceau\n\nAs we walked around exploring all the rooms there was the smell of sweet fragrances in the air, the rooms are filled with fragrance and beautiful flower displays that are in itself a good reason alone to visit the Chateau.\n\nColourful displays of amaryllis, hyacinths, orchids, roses, tulips etc and a variety of grasses and even vegetables are used to create the extraordinary floral masterpieces. The flowers and vegetables are grown at the Chateau’s own flower nurseries\n\nChenonceau later passed into private ownership and is today owned by the Menier family, the world famous French chocolatier family.\n\nTips for visiting Château de Chenonceau\n\nWe visited during our stay at Amboise. The Chateau was just 30 minutes from the motorhome Aire we had been staying at during our three days visit to the Loire Valley. If visiting by motorhome like us, there is allocated free parking spaces, although overnight parking is not allowed.\n\nIf travelling by train Chenonceau station is right by the Château, but I guess if you are coming from Paris or other areas you would first have to stop at Tours and change trains there for Chenonceau.\n\nI would recommend visiting during the low or shoulder season, since it can get very crowded in the summer. If visiting in the summer arrive early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the worst of the crowds.\n\nOur visiting tickets cost us 14.50 Euro each, which included a visiting guide booklet. We both really enjoyed our visit and felt the ticket price was totally worth it. Altogether we spent about 2 to 3 hours exploring the Château and its gardens, there is lots to see.\n\nAu Revoir France\n\nLeaving the Chateau and the Loire Valley on our rear mirror we made our way towards Ruffec on France’s Charente region. Staying two nights at the campsite Le Rejallant GPS position N 46°00’53”, E 0°12’54” we used our ACSI discount card for the first time and got a motorhome pitch for 12 Euro per night all services and electric hook up included.\n\nApart from a very short walk around the site and towards the river, we did not venture far and spent our time relaxing, reading books and doing our badly needed clothes washing…the glamorous side of motorhome travelling.\n\nWith clean clothes we pointed our motorhome wheels towards Bergerac. We thought it would be nice to stay at the nearby Aire and explore the town, but on arrival we did not like the look of the Aire.\n\nWe hot footed right out of there and continued driving for another hour to stay overnight instead at the lovely free Aire by the side of a canal at Caumont Sur Garonne (N 44. 44202 E 0. 17877). It was quite tight to get in, but a peaceful and beautiful location. No electric hook up here though.\n\nLeaving the flat terrain of the Charente behind we stated climbing towards France’s Basque region, with the Pyrenees Mountain Range on our sight we arrived at the pretty town of St. Jean Pied de Port, where we stayed for one night at the town’s Aire, GPS position N43.16502 W1.23182 costing 8 Euro for 24 hrs, all services and electric hook up included.\n\nGetting into the Aire required befriending a French couple, since the machine would only accept French bank cards…very weird. So, we gave them cash and they bought the parking ticket for us.\n\nPilgrims walking the Camino Frances will usually be starting from St Jean Pied de Port. It can take them about 35 days to complete the almost 800kms/ 500 miles to Santiago de Compostela. Brian and I had planned to walk the Camino Frances last September, but due to family commitments we have postponed it. We are still keen to do it in the near future.\n\nSince we felt that we will be back here in the future for our “Camino” walk we did not linger here for long and just did a quick exploring around the little town.\n\nWe left mid-morning the next day bidding au revoir to France…for now at least, but we will certainly be back soon. Using the toll roads we crossed the border into Spain and the next leg of our adventure continued."
