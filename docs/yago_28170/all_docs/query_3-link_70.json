        "text": "My work is informed by my fascination with history, mostly European. I am struck by how history repeats itself. George Santayana said it best: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Lessons are never truly learned and the French renaissance is one example.\n\nThe reasons for this are because the French renaissance is a lot like today, but without the comforts. It was a time of extreme violence, economic disparity, bigotry, religious wars, pandemics, fanaticism and, surprisingly, a flowering in the arts. The parallels to the world today are dismaying and surprising.\n\nThe French renaissance was defined by the struggle for power between various warring factions; the Catholics versus the Protestants( Huguenots), Catholic extremism versus Catholic compromise, the after effects of the Reformation, aristocracy versus the peasant class and the burgeoning middle class. In the end very little was resolved and France and Europe were left bankrupt and exhausted.\n\nThe Valois presided over much of this. Ambitious, greedy, ruthless, sensuous, sickly and arrogant, the Valois personified their times. Their dynasty weakened over time with each successive generation, becoming more and more divisive, decadent and distant from their subjects. The last Valois, Henry III, was a cross dressing( to me a plus!), murderous fanatic who was stabbed to death by a mad monk.\n\nThe duality of the French renaissance is exemplified by my use of a technique used mostly by carnivals and Cracker Jacks, the lenticular flip where one image ”flips” or transitions into another image using a grid of grooved lenses. I have taken the official portraits and sculpture Valois kings( and some queens) and digitally manipulated them with images that define their reigns. When the image flips to the second layer one can see the “other side” of both the person and the time they lived in. This second layer can be an image tied to the renaissance or to the world today, natural phenomenon, crime scenes, cinema, science.\n\nThis series was created to provide a vehicle for people to rethink their perceptions of the world around them using history as a springboard. The use of the playful carny flip technique makes the disturbing images accessible on a gut level. With the addition of the image’s the artworks becomes more and more alarming."
