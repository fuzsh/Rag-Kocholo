        "text": "César was the eldest of Henri IV’s three children with Gabrielle d’Estrées.\n\nHenri had given the widowed Queen Louise of Lorraine the right to continue to live at Chenonceau for the rest of her life but a deal was done that Chenonceau would be given to Louise’ niece and heiress Françoise of Lorraine who would marry César.\n\nAt the time of the deal, Françoise was six and César four. At fifteen César married Françoise as planned.\n\nThe following year Henri IV was assassinated. His eight year old son became King Louis XIII. Louis’ mother Marie de Medici acted as Regent for the next seven years and César was involved in ongoing intrigues against her. Later the conflict continued with his half brother King Louis XIII and the First Minister Cardinal Richelieu. César was accused of plotting to assassinate Richelieu, leading to him being imprisoned and exiled more than once.\n\nCésar was widely known to be gay but he and Françoise had three children. Francoise inherited a fortune from her mother and the two were destined to live long (separate) lives.\n\nCésar’s conflicts with the royal family came to an end in the next generation. Louis XIII and Richelieu died within six months of each other. Louis XIV, the new King, was less than five years old. When Louis XIV was twelve, his mother the Regent Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin, the new First Minister, accompanied the young king to attend a lavish party hosted by César at Chenonceau.\n\nAs evidence of the new relationship, the following year César’s son Louis married Mazarin’s 15 year old niece Laura Mancini.\n\nCésar was also named Grand Admiral of France.\n\nHe died fourteen years later at the age of 71."
