        "text": "Philippe-Emmanuel de Lorraine, duke de Mercoeur (born Sept. 9, 1558, Nomény, France—died Feb. 19, 1602, Nürnberg [Germany]) was a prince who led the resistance in Brittany against King Henry IV of France when that monarch was trying to consolidate his kingdom.\n\nPhilippe was the son of Nicolas de Lorraine, who became Duke de Mercoeur in 1569, and was a half brother to Louise de Vaudémont, wife of Henry III of France. He succeeded to his father’s duchy in 1577. Mercoeur served as governor of Brittany from 1582, but after Henry III had his cousins of the house of Guise assassinated in 1588, Philippe rebelled; when Henry III was himself assassinated (1589), Mercoeur rallied most of Roman Catholic Brittany against the Protestant Henry IV."
