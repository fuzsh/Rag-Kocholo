        "text": "The post 12 Iconic Soundtracks That Influenced Composer Bear McCreary appeared first on Consequence.\n\nCrate Digging is a recurring feature in which we take a deep dive into a genre and turn up several albums all music fans should know about. In this edition, composer Bear McCreary shares some very personal picks.\n\nBear McCreary has become one of the industry’s most prolific composers since his critically acclaimed breakthrough work on Battlestar Galactica, scoring such projects as The Walking Dead, the God of War games, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. This is what makes his newest project, The Singularity, so unique: A 25-track original concept album (with an accompanying graphic novel)\n\n“I’ve spent the last 25 years of my life professionally writing music to fit other people’s stories,” McCreary tells Consequence. “So The Singularity, as it exists today, really began as a purely musical expression — I had other things to say musically that I wasn’t able to say through the films and television and video games that I was fortunate enough to be scoring.”\n\nMcCreary feels very passionately about the art of composing music for the screen — so passionately, in fact, that when Consequence asked him to select the movie (and TV) scores that represent his personal favorites, we allowed him to expand his list of picks from ten to twelve: A list that includes some iconic pillars of science fiction, fantasy, and horror… as well as one of the 20th century’s wildest sequels of all time, and the movie that made him first realize the power of music in film.\n\nConan the Barbarian (1982), composed by Basil Poledouris\n\nThe most significant fantasy film score of all time, which is also an easy contender for the best film score of all time for me. You listen to this score, it has everything. It has power and beauty, might and majesty. It’s a masterclass in orchestration. It wasn’t his first score, but it was very close. If you go back and listen to some of his other highlights — Lonesome Dove, Starship Troopers, Robocop — there are all these huge anthems.\n\nBut Conan the Barbarian is maybe one of the only scores that can make me feel absolutely invigorated and then, in the same cue, can almost make me want to weep and takes me to another another realm. I just can’t say enough good things about it. Basil [Poledouris] is often, I think, overlooked from the list of the greats. And he shouldn’t be, he was one of them.\n\nBatman: The Animated Series (1992-1995), composed by Shirley Walker and others\n\nShirley Walker and her team… There are too many to list here but some of her graduates, Lolita Ritmanis and her crew at Dynamic Music Partners and others, all collected together under [Walker’s] leadership, created this remarkable score that was cinematic at a time when television scores were not cinematic, especially not animation. She and her team wrote themes for these characters that rival anything that has been written for the big or small screen. Some of my favorite themes ever written for television, for sure, are from that show.\n\nWhen I started my career, I started on a show called Battlestar Galactica. I grew up loving film scores and Batman: The Animated Series, so when I started Battlestar, I had no context for what television should sound like. I watched TV shows, but I never dreamed of scoring 22 hours of narrative. So when I thought, well, who should I model this after? I realized, ah, Shirley Walker, that’s what I want to do. I want it to be that.\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch (1990), composed by Jerry Goldsmith\n\nI love it. Here’s why. The score, like the film itself, is so irreverent. He’s making fun of the movie and making fun of you for watching it and making fun of the entire film industry. But he is also doing it so skillfully with great melodies. And he took his synth aesthetic from the original Gremlins and modernized it for a kind of 1990 aesthetic. It’s an incredible score, and one I listened to nonstop.\n\nAlso, at the same time, Jerry Goldsmith wrote a fantastic score for Total Recall — he had two weeks off in the middle of doing Total Recall, and he did Gremlins 2 in that. The fact that he stepped away from this action masterpiece and instead of taking two weeks off, he wrote one of my favorite scores ever. I mean, I just gotta give it up.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), composed by Jerry Goldsmith\n\nThe ultimate mic drop. John Williams had reestablished the classical style as the language of science fiction, so Jerry Goldsmith writes a score for Star Trek in this big symphonic style, not sounding like Alexander Courage’s very cool sixties music from the show. The title theme would go on to become the theme for The Next Generation and in many ways is the defining defacto theme of the entire franchise for many people. That alone would be an achievement — and he also crafted the musical language for the Klingons that would last forever, and wrote a very catchy theme for them.\n\nDelete both of those, and he still wrote a theme called “Ilia’s Theme.” That is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written for film. That’s why I call it the mic drop. He looks at this character, this bald woman who merges with a machine and has a weird pseudosexual romance with Kirk, and he’s just like, “I’m going to make the most beautiful music ever.” That’s one of my desert island pieces. If I could only listen to three pieces of music and I had to pick ’em right now, “Ilia’s Theme” is right there. It’s got everything. It is to science fiction, I think, what Conan is to fantasy, where pretty much everything can be found there. Not the first, just one of the best.\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990), composed by Danny Elfman\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\n, in many ways, showed a maturation on his part. It was a sort of crossing over, a leaving behind of his childhood aesthetic that he brought to Batman and Beetlejuice and Pee-wee. And around this time, I think he emerged more as an artist in a more pure sense — he had done it enough times that you start hearing this voice emerge in the choral writing, in the melodic writing, in the harmonic language. It’s this perfect balance between being sophisticated and being spontaneous and childlike. I love it.\n\nSpirited Away (2001), composed by Joe Hisaishi\n\nOh, this is a tough one. Sometimes Joe Hisaishi’s scores are so beautiful, they cause me physical pain because I’m just thinking like, “Why am I doing this? Why am I even trying to work in this medium?” I’m gonna go with Spirited Away — it represents this inflection point where I think Hisaishi and Miyazaki are both so sophisticated at what they’re doing and so confident in what they’re doing that you just hear that in the music. I mean, Princess Mononoke is like that too, but for my personal melodic tastes, I lean towards Spirited Away.\n\nStar Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980), composed by John Williams\n\nWe gotta get a John Williams in here, but I’m not gonna cite some obscure John Williams and be cool. I’m not cool, and Empire Strikes Back is my favorite. I love A New Hope, and I love Return of the Jedi. But Empire Strikes Back has the hits. The main theme is in there, that melody for Han Solo and the Princess, that melody for Yoda — mic drop, boom.\n\nAnd then the big one, “The Imperial March,” that fans almost forget wasn’t even in the first movie — he had a different theme for Darth Vader [in A New Hope] that was vastly inferior. I sort of admire the fact that he thought, “You know, let’s just throw that out. We’ll just retcon it out of existence.” And to the best of my knowledge, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say in the feature films, I don’t think that [original Darth Vader] theme ever even came back. It was rewritten to be “The Imperial March.” Which I find amusing. That’s how good it was.\n\nPsycho (1960), composed by Bernard Herrmann\n\nThis is not complete without Bernard Hermann, and you can’t talk about Hermann without talking about Hitchcock. And for me, it’s Psycho. This guy’s pushing the envelope to score a film with only strings for purely creative reasons, which was so daring and so alienating and weird for the audience. I mean, that that score does its job. He understood the assignment. The score is strings-only when it didn’t need to be, just like the film is black and white when it didn’t need to be. He’s using this monochromatic texture to upset you and to drive the story.\n\nThe other thing he did though, he made the most famous cue in film history. I don’t mean the most famous theme, I don’t mean the most famous main title, I don’t mean the most famous song. I mean the most famous cue that just happened once in a movie to score some scene and became famous. The shower scene in Psycho is the king of them all. The shower scene alone puts it in the top 10 for me. It is upsetting in the best possible way.\n\nThe Mission (1986), composed by Ennio Morricone\n\nEnnio Morricone is the most prolific film composer to have ever lived. Also among the most accomplished, also among the most melodically gifted. The Mission is my favorite score of his — it’s less impactful than his other scores in pop culture, but it moves me to tears when I even think about it. And it’s just so much better than the movie it was associated with, which is a good movie. It’s sort of like Jerry Goldsmith and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, where a movie comes in, it’s a good movie, it’s fine. And then there’s a composer who looks at this film and decides to write one of the greatest pieces of music that someone would write in that century. I find that fascinating.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962), composed by Elmer Bernstein\n\nLike The Mission, the main title is from on high. The main title is this divine piece of work that came out of this guy’s brain in 1960 and sounds like all of the future blended together. It didn’t sound like drama in the ’60s. If I had told you that James Horner wrote that for some Academy Award-nominated drama in 1994, you’d go, “Yeah, that sounds like him.” Or if I said, “No, Hans Zimmer wrote that for some drama that came out last year,” you’d be like, “Yeah, I can hear that.” It’s so cinematic and so rich and so thoughtful and timeless. It’s literally timeless.\n\nBraveheart (1995), composed by James Horner\n\nThis really is just personal preference, right — you hear [Braveheart] everywhere in my music, and I work with some of the same musicians. The bagpipe player I work with was the bagpipe player from Braveheart — I had him sign my Braveheart CD on my first session I did with him. It really spoke to my Scottish and Irish heritage: I loved Scottish music, I’d been going to the Highland Games since I was a kid, but hearing it in that big cinematic context really rewired my brain.\n\nBack to the Future (1985), composed by Alan Silvestri\n\nI was six when I went to see that in the theater. That was the one that made me fall in love with film music. You could argue there’s no score that’s influenced me more, because when I got home, I got my little Fisher-Price tape recorder, and I said to my mom, “Take me back.” The next night we went back and I told her, “don’t laugh, don’t have fun,” and I held up the tape recorder because I wanted to hear that music again, and I didn’t know you could buy a soundtrack.\n\nI took it home and I listened, and I’m like, I wish Marty would stop talking, listen to that music. And then I discovered there was a soundtrack album. That melody, that main theme is filled with so much bravado and joy and confidence in its cinema… I mean, that’s what cinema is to me.\n\nFor more on The Singularity, visit the official website.\n\n12 Iconic Soundtracks That Influenced Composer Bear McCreary\n\nLiz Shannon Miller\n\nPopular Posts\n\nThe Black Keys Quietly Cancel Tour, Likely Due to Poor Ticket Sales [Updated]\n\nEddie Murphy Returns as Axel Foley in Trailer for Beverly Hills Cop 4: Watch\n\nMillie Bobby Brown Marries Jake Bongiovi\n\nWheel of Fortune Contestant Goes Viral for NSFW (and Totally Incorrect) Answer\n\nLimp Bizkit and Corey Feldman Drop Outrageous Promo Video Ahead of Joint Tour: Watch\n\nStray Kids Talk New Music, Summer Memories, and Upcoming Lollapalooza Performance"
