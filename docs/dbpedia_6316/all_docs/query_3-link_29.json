        "text": "For Glenn Silber, the co-director of “The War at Home,” rereleasing his 1979 documentary about the anti-war movement during the Vietnam War isn't about nostalgia. He believes that screening it now is more of a moral imperative.\n\n“I was inspired by the women's marches,” says Silber, speaking from his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “I thought that the movie would have relevance to the present, a cinematic ramp-up to the November midterm elections.”\n\nThe Oscar-nominated movie, which recently underwent a 4K digital restoration, opens Friday at Cinema Detroit, where it will play for a week. Friday's 7:30 p.m. opening night screening will include a Q&A with Free Press columnist John Gallagher and Wayne State University Professor Emeritus Fran Shor. The opener is part of Freep Film Festival's monthly screening series.\n\n“The War at Home” chronicles 10 years of anti-war resistance in the college town of Madison, Wisconsin, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s. The film includes interviews with student activists, police and veterans, accompanied by TV news footage.\n\n“The movie is a reminder that when people are organized, when they join together for a common purpose, with morality on their side, they can make a difference,” says Silber.\n\nSilber, who attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, began working on “The War at Home” not long after the Vietnam war ended in 1975. “Research was slow at first,” he remembers. “It was hard to find footage of the key events that needed to be covered.”\n\nOn what Silber calls “the luckiest day of his life,” an archivist from the University called to say that a local ABC-TV affiliate had just donated to the school boxes and boxes 16mm news footage stretching from 1959 to 1972. If he helped catalog the film, he could use anything he found free of charge.\n\nSilber, with research partner and co-director Barry Alexander Brown, spent the next four years putting the film together. The resulting documentary includes often violent clashes between protesters and police, including the 1967 sit-in against Dow Chemical that began as peaceful but quickly turned violent.\n\n“The War at Home” also explores the 1970 Sterling Hall bombing, in which protesters set out to blow up an Army research center on campus. Their action ended up destroying other parts of the building, leading to the death of a researcher.\n\nKey to the film's artistic success, Silber says, is its clear vision and focus. Part of this, he says, comes from advice received from legendary documentarian Emile de Antonio (“Point of Order,” “Millhouse: A White Comedy”). As Silber recalls: “He said, 'Don't leave Madison. Don't go running off to Columbia in 1968 or Berkeley. Don't be a mile wide and an inch deep. Go the other way. Go deep into Madison,' and that became our guiding principle.”\n\nWhen the movie was released in 1979, it had strong reviews, a healthy art house run and was nominated for best documentary feature at the 1980 Academy Awards. (It lost to Ira Wohl's “Best Boy.”)\n\nThe movie resurfaced earlier this year when Silber and Brown launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $25,000 needed to transfer the film's original 16mm negative to high-resolution 4K digital for use in modern theaters. They earned $38,000 for their efforts, enabling the film to make a multi-city tour this fall.\n\nReviews of “The War at Home” have again been solid. Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore tweeted that it is “One of the best documentaries ever made.” (Scheduling conflicts have so far prevented the film from playing in Traverse City, Moore's home base.)\n\nSilber, who has spent the past four decades as a TV news producer, is encouraged by reaction received during recent screenings.\n\n“I think it plays better today than when we originally released it,” Silber says. “When we first showed it, it was just four years after the war. Of course people were proud of what they had done, but there was no burning issue. Today I feel that zeitgeist of resistance, and this is our contribution to it.”\n\n'The War at Home'\n\nBeginning Friday\n\nCinema Detroit\n\n4126 Third St., Detroit\n\n313-482-9028\n\nwww.cinemadetroit.org\n\nThe 7:30 p.m. Friday showing is part of the Freep Film Festival monthly screening series. It will include a post-film Q&A with Free Press columnist John Gallagher and Fran Shor, a professor emeritus at Wayne State University who has spoken about the anti-war movement.\n\n$10"
