        "text": "Hmm, my first film soundtrack that I’ve actually bought in awhile ((I think Horner’s Sneakers and Gorky Park from La LA Land were the last ones). I don’t know if that’s a reflection of the state of modern film music, or that most of my ‘wants’ have already been released over the past decade or so by the boutique labels. These days not much gets my attention, or seems worth the expense of importing.\n\nBasil Poledouris’ 1999 score for Sam Raimi’s baseball film For Love of the Game was an unknown quantity for me. I have never seen the film or was ever interested in doing so, really, even though you’d think they would have had me at ‘baseball movie starring Kevin Costner’ considering that Field of Dreams is one of my favourite films. Maybe back in 1999 I thought it was a cynical, even lazy, box-tricking exercise- Costner/baseball had been done ten years prior far as I was concerned; what was the point other than being an easy pitch (sic) to the Studio? I still haven’t seen the movie, so I never even realised that Basil Poledouris had done the soundtrack. Maybe I’d have shown more interest if I did, as I’m a huge admirer of Poledouris’ work- Conan the Barbarian, Lonesome Dove, Robocop, Cherry 2000 and many more were hugely elevated by his music. At any rate, curiosity got the better of me, and Varese having an International store now makes it so much easier and cheaper to buy their releases, making a blind-buy much more palatable.\n\nAs it turns out, For Love of the Game is a fantastic score, and strikes me as an ideal entry-point for anyone curious about Poledouris’ music. as it encompasses many styles. There’s obviously an epic, Americana, almost Western-style theme, at time similar to his magnificent Lonesome Dove music, but there’s also tenser romantic music, and some more modern-sounding rhythm and blues, even some jazzy material (not all of which was used in the film, and I’ve noticed the original soundtrack album was dominated by source music/songs etc, relegating Poledouris’ score to a ten-minute suite, reminding me why I disliked so many soundtrack albums back in the day). Some of the music also reminds me of his mostly overlooked Cherry 2000 score. There’s a lot to like in its 78 minutes on this new Deluxe edition and its really quite varied. Particular highlights are the thoughtful track The Decision and .the hugely uplifting, triumphant Last Pitch, in which Poledouris seems to throw in everything but the kitchen sink- orchestra, choir, even electric guitar, its hugely impressive scoring (both tracks well worth checking out on YouTube).\n\nFilm music today is more sound design and ambient mood than music how it used to be, supporting visuals etc rather than leading them, a trend that is pretty depressing, but that’s just how things are and films are largely the lesser for it. One used to walk out of a movie whistling its main theme (Superman: The Movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc) but most movies these days you hardly notice a theme at all and if there is one its hardly memorable enough to remember. In Poledouris’ heyday things were different, hence his brilliant Conan The Barbarian opus etc, but by the time For Love of the Game came around, that was already on the wane and Poledouris’ career scoring film music was drawing to a close. His untimely passing in 2006 still remains as much a shock and loss as it did at the time, just as was the passing of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner- films are much the lesser for their passing. This score is just another reminder of how great Poledouris was when given the opportunity, and Varese should be commended for releasing this expanded, deluxe edition. Even the extensive liner notes are a surprise, considering Varese’s booklets of old.\n\nIntrigued by this wonderful music, I’ll have to keep an eye out for the film and give it a try sometime.\n\nWell, as if that expanded Alien 3 soundtrack wasn’t enough to boggle the mind- Varese Sarabande have announced a deluxe edition of John William’s Dracula score, a soundtrack album widely considered impossible as the masters had been thought lost for decades. I suppose the discovery of how it eventually came to pass will be revealed shortly – producer Mike Matessino, whose hands and ears have been behind most if not all the expansions of John Williams score over the past several years, has always been quite candid about the work behind these releases. But what a surprise this is.\n\nDracula dates from 1979, just when Williams was at his creative peak. Star Wars, Close Encounters, Superman and The Fury were just behind him, and The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders were just ahead. TESB is my very favourite Williams score and its wonderful when listening to material I’m not familiar with, like his score for The Fury, and hearing hints of Empire’s beating heart in the melodies and orchestrations. Dracula is not a score I am particularly familiar with, so like with 1941 and The Fury, I am looking forward to it as if it were a new Williams score.\n\nAnother Christmas treat, as was La La Land’s Close Encounters expansion last year. Mind, a bittersweet one- inevitably as the boutique labels work their way through John William’s filmscores with these expansions and remasters, there won’t be all that many remaining. Each of these projects are special, particularly these from my favourite period of his work.\n\nMind, I have noticed Varese seem to have applied a little bit of judicious digital paint/editing on the racier aspects of the original poster art that they have used for the cover. Sign of the times, no doubt, but quite ridiculous.\n\nVarese Sarabande in the States have just announced the release next week of a deluxe edition of James Horner’s 1988 score for Cocoon: The Return. Listening to samples takes me back to when I bought the first disc back in ’88 (God, so long ago!). While it’s not one of the composer’s most important or likely even most popular scores, and indeed the film wasn’t particularly special as I recall, it’s nonetheless great to see the score available again, especially now remastered in complete form on a disc lasting some 70+ minutes. And that cover, boasting boosted colours that better match the cover of the Cocoon album, sure is a beauty, yes? That poster art is by the late John Alvin, who of course also did the magical poster for the original Cocoon film and, amongst many others, also Blade Runner‘s original 1982 poster. I really do miss those days of painted posters for movies. Very often they were beautiful images in their own right, and when done well, they perfectly captured the essence of what a movie was far better than the photoshop monstrosities we see so often now.\n\nThis new Varese edition is limited to 2500 copies, and I would imagine it will take awhile to sell out, but just incase I have mine ordered already. Okay, it may not, in the great scheme of things, be one of Horner’s greatest scores but it’s a welcome release of an OOP score and any expanded release of a Horner score needs supporting.\n\nThe soundtrack of the original Cocoon soundtrack came out in expanded form a few years ago on the Intrada label. Buying these expanded releases and hearing them again is like revisiting old friends and brings those old days rushing back. The 1980s were probably the best years for Horner’s music, back when he was a rising star and truly on fire with some incredible scores, and this music takes me back to those heady days when every new Horner score was something new and fresh and yes, exciting. His music was so well orchestrated and melodic, I loved all that stuff, and hearing it again now really takes me back. It was a wonderful time to be ‘into’ film soundtracks and looking back, it was more special than I realised at the time. This score was certainly a part of that.\n\n(Amendum: The disc arrived a little while ago and is a great listen. Old times indeed. It sounds great and Varese has actually made an effort with the liner notes which is a nice surprise.The only weakness of the disc is that much of the music is shared with the original Cocoon soundtrack. I can understand why Horner returned to the earlier films themes as it maintained thematic unity but it does sound very familiar. Fortunately an enriched orchestration keeps things interesting and on the whole the score is more intimate than the first. It’s a welcome expansion.)\n\nIts funny how spoilt we have been over the past few years by soundtracks being released in expanded/complete form. Some are more deserving than others of course, and I often give news of a release a curious double-take wondering why bother, as I guess the definition of ‘great’ is wholly subjective- we all have our funny preferences/favourites. For myself, I always liked both the movie and soundtrack for THE ABYSS, but never thought it was a score that would ever get an expanded release. It was widely considered a good score, but I doubted anyone would think it deserving of the deluxe treatment. Well, how wrong I was, and here it is, the first notable soundtrack release of 2014 (for me anyway)-Varese’s rather literally-out-of-the-blue THE ABYSS: THE DELUXE EDITION.\n\nAs might be expected the sound quality is a vast improvement on the original album from 1989, but the real surprise is the music itself and how the restored cues and sequencing elevates the score. The original disc was nearly 50 minutes long, which was quite reasonable for the time and covered most of the highlights of the score, but in complete form (something like 80 mins or more, with addl alternates bringing it to nearly two hours of music in all) it reveals itself as a rather varied and challenging work, mixing moments of ambience and suspense with precise (albeit rather ordinary) action scoring and quite melodious classical pieces. As a whole the entire thing just seems to work better than memories of the film or the earlier release would suggest, and its a more interesting score than I expected. The atmospheric, suspenseful ambient electronic pieces are very effective bookended by the more traditional melodious orchestral cues, and the whole score feels more balanced than on the original album.\n\nCuriously I was struck by similarities with James Horner’s score for BRAINSTORM, particularly the main title (both the music and, in the film, the actual title reveal, are very similar to that of BRAINSTORM). For some reason I don’t recall this ever occurring to me before, but its blatantly obvious here, particularly as the main title here does not segue into the military drum music as it did on the original album. Wouldn’t surprise me if Cameron hadn’t temp-tracked the film with some of Horner’s BRAINSTORM score as there are a few other moments in the score that are very similar (interestingly, Cameron had worked with Horner previously on ALIENS and perhaps Cameron originally intended to hire Horner for THE ABYSS?).\n\nLikewise there are some illuminating alternates that reveal a warmer, more emotional/traditional score that director James Cameron apparently rejected. The alternate version of The Only Way coupled with Lindsey Dies indicates greater use of the film’s love theme which were dropped in favour of a perhaps more radical, ambient approach. Both pieces are very effective and while its debatable which approach was best for the film (I prefer Cameron’s final version, but I can see how some would prefer the warmer approach Silvestri originally intended), its a fascinating glimpse at how differing pieces of music can effect a scene. I love this kind of thing, hearing how the composer originally saw a scene and what music he thought functioned better, before the director or producer gets involved as the film is being cut together.\n\nI’ve always been a bit ambivalent regards Alan Silvestri’s scores in general (although he certainly has his followers), but I really think THE ABYSS is revealed here as one of his finest works. Both the complete score and its many alternates included here reveal an ambitious score and how much effort Silvestri clearly put into it.\n\nAlthough Silvestri seems to have been rather quiet of late, his work perhaps out of favour in Hollywood, I read recently that he has been signed to write the score for the remake of Carl Sagan’s COSMOS tv series. Ordinarily I wouldn’t have been too impressed at the news, but listening to THE ABYSS and its varied score, I think it may turn out to be a bold and interesting development. We shall see."
