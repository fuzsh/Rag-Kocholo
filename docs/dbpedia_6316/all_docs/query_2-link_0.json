        "text": "American composer (1945–2006)\n\nMusical artist\n\nBasil Konstantine Poledouris ( ; August 21, 1945 – November 8, 2006) was an American composer, conductor, and orchestrator of film and television scores,[1] best known for his long-running collaborations with directors John Milius and Paul Verhoeven. Among his works are scores for the films Conan the Barbarian (1982), Red Dawn (1984), Iron Eagle (1986), RoboCop (1987), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Free Willy (1993), Starship Troopers (1997) and Les Misérables (1998).\n\nPoledouris won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special for his work on the four-part miniseries Lonesome Dove in 1989, and was a four-time recipient of the BMI Film Music Award.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Missouri, to Greek immigrant parents from Messenia, he credited two influences with guiding him towards music: the first was composer Miklós Rózsa; the second his own Greek Orthodox heritage. Poledouris was raised in the Church, and he used to sit in services enthralled by the choir's sound.[2] At the age of seven, Poledouris began piano lessons, and after graduation from Garden Grove High School, he enrolled at the University of Southern California to study both filmmaking and music. Several short films to which he contributed are still kept in the university's archives. At USC, Poledouris met movie directors John Milius and Randal Kleiser, with whom he would later collaborate as a music composer. He appeared as a background extra in several episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series.[3] In 1985, Poledouris wrote the music for Paul Verhoeven's Flesh & Blood, establishing a durable collaboration.\n\nPoledouris became renowned for his powerfully epic style of orchestral composition and his intricate thematic designs. He scored the soundtrack for The Blue Lagoon (1980; dir: Kleiser); Conan the Barbarian (1982; dir: Milius); Conan the Destroyer (1984); Red Dawn (1984; dir: Milius), Iron Eagle (1986); RoboCop (1987; dir: Verhoeven); The Hunt for Red October (1990); Quigley Down Under (1990 Simon Wincer); Free Willy (1993) and its first sequel Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995); Starship Troopers (1997; dir: Verhoeven); and For Love of the Game (1999).\n\nPoledouris' studio, \"Blowtorch Flats\", was located in Venice, California, and was a professional mixing facility specializing in film and media production.\n\nPoledouris married his wife Bobbie in 1969; they had two daughters, Zoë and Alexis. His elder daughter, Zoë Poledouris, is an actress and film composer, who occasionally collaborated with her father in composing film soundtracks.\n\nIn 1996, Poledouris composed \"The Tradition of the Games\"[4] for the Atlanta Olympics opening ceremony that accompanied the memorable dance tribute[5] to the athletes and goddesses of victory of the ancient Greek Olympics using silhouette imagery.[6]\n\nPoledouris spent the last four years of his life residing on Vashon Island, in Washington state. He died on November 8, 2006, in Los Angeles, California, aged 61, from lung cancer.[7] [8]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nWinner Best Score for Miniseries – Emmy Awards (Lonesome Dove)\n\nNominee Best Score – Saturn Awards (Conan the Barbarian)\n\nWinner Special Recognition Music Award – BMI Film & TV Awards (Olympic Tribute for \"The Tradition of the Games\")\n\nWinner Film Music Award – BMI Awards (Free Willy)\n\nWinner Film Music Award – BMI Awards (The Hunt for Red October)\n\nWinner TV Music Award – BMI Awards (Lonesome Dove)\n\nWinner Film Music Award – BMI Awards (RoboCop)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Director Studio(s) Notes 1970 The Reversal of Richard Sun John Milius USC School of Cinematic Arts Student film 1973 Hollywood 90028 Christina Hornisher Parker National Distribution Extreme Close-Up Jeannot Szwarc General Cinema Corporation 1974 Vrooom Ken Rudolph Pyramid Films 1977 Tintorera René Cardona Jr. Hemdale Film Corporation\n\nUnited Film Distribution 1978 Big Wednesday John Milius Warner Bros. 1980 The Blue Lagoon Randal Kleiser Columbia Pictures 1982 Conan the Barbarian John Milius De Laurentiis Entertainment Group\n\nUniversal Pictures (North America)\n\n20th Century Fox (International) Nominated:\n\nSaturn Award for Best Music Summer Lovers Randal Kleiser Filmways Pictures 1984 Making the Grade Dorian Walker Cannon Films Conan the Destroyer Richard Fleischer De Laurentiis Entertainment Group\n\nUniversal Pictures Red Dawn John Milius United Artists\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Protocol Herbert Ross Warner Bros. 1985 Flesh & Blood Paul Verhoeven Orion Pictures 1986 Iron Eagle Sidney J.
