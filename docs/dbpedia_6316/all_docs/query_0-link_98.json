        "text": "Boy, this is quite the task! I grew up with film scores ringing in my ear and playing through my mind. I remember sitting in the back of my grandparents’ motor home during a road trip, with my hip yellow boom box and thirty five cassette tapes of my favorite film scores.\n\nScience fiction has always been a regular feature throughout the history of film. As early as the silent film era we’ve had memorable takes on the genre such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World (1920) and Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927). In the 1930s H.G. Wells brought us Things to Come (1936) and we also saw the birth of the Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers characters in several low budget film serials.\n\nSadly, due to the events of World War II, science fiction wouldn’t become popular again until the 1950s when the world was looking for escapism and they found it in the guise of aliens. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), The Thing From Another World and Invasion of the Body Snatchers all excited viewers with alien invasions. Meanwhile, When Worlds Collide (1951), The War of the Worlds (1953) and The Time Machine (1960) showed us that there was a taste for turning science fiction novels to the big screen.\n\nThe space race of the 1960s saw the focus shift to space travel with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Planet of the Apes (1968) both hugely successfully. But it wouldn’t be until 1977 when George Lucas’ Star Wars arrived that the history of science fiction wouldn’t be changed forever. The genre became a guaranteed money maker and all the major studios looked to cash in. We saw the Star Trek TV series become a film franchise in 1979 and other franchises started to grow throughout the 1980s and 90s such as Alien, Back to the Future, Terminator and Robocop.\n\nSince the turn of the century, this trend has continued, most noticeably with The Matrix Trilogy. The recent focus has been on prequels and sequels (Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Terminator), remakes (The War of the Worlds, Total Recall) and reboots (Star Trek, Robocop) but science fiction is still as popular as ever.\n\nThe genre has also often inspired composers to be at their most creative. Whether it is looking into the future, the past or into space, science fiction has produced some of the very best film scores. It’s also hard to pin down one particular style for the genre; composers have used various successful techniques over the years to help us to escape into an unknown world such as symphonic orchestras, synthesizers and unusual sound effects.\n\nAnd here we go…\n\nI still enjoy discovering new film scores as much as I do of music for the concert hall. This list changes day to day. However, I think you will find a great representation of scores, both old and new.\n\nLet the film music games begin! In no particular order…\n\nSTAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN (1982) – James Horner\n\nJerry Goldsmith made music for Star Trek a must listen with Star Trek: The Motion Picture. James Horner had a big task filling those shoes. Horner busts right out of those shoes with one of my all time favorite scores. Whereas Star Trek: The Motion Picture had wowed audiences with all the majestic fantasy elements that a $45 million budget could buy, many of which overextended into lengthy sequences to accentuate their mere brilliance of color and sound, Meyer’s approach to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was strictly a plot-driven one (and a necessary move because his budget was limited to roughly $11 million for the sequel). With the elements of brutal power, surprise attacks, character development, emotional turmoil, and, most of all, primal revenge all driving the basis of the sequel, there was finally appealing substance to go with the franchise’s impressive special effects.\n\nThis is in my opinion, the greatest score to come out of the Star Trek series."
