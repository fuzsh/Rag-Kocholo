        "text": "Scoring lawless futures & savage pasts is a job for Basil Poledouris, by David Hirsch\n\nOriginally published in Starlog Magazine #243, October 1997\n\nText reproduced by kind permission of the author David Hirsch\n\nPhoto of Basil Poledouris by Julio Rodriguez\n\nSome might consider composer Basil Poledouris a contradiction. His passion for the ocean, whether on his sailboat or surfboard is perhaps only exceeded by his desire to create the lush, melodic scores that have graced such films as CONAN THE BARBARIAN, LONESOME DOVE, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and ROBOCOP.\n\nThis fall, the long-delayed ROBOCOP 3 will explode onto local theater screens, backed by his pulse-pounding themes. The selection of Poledouris to score another ROBOCOP adventure may have resulted from the filmmakers’ desire to recapture the first movie’s tone, an ambiance some fans claim was missing from the sequel. It was the composer’s musical depiction of RoboCop’s soul that stayed with audiences, who were able to identify with Officer Murphy’s mechanized alter-ego. This idea was reinforced by Orion Pictures continual use of the original ROBOCOP theme in all ROBOCOP 2 advertising.\n\nRecorded in fall 1991, the ROBOCOP 3 score is less mechanical, more humanistic than its predecessor. Since the film’s focus isn’t on Murphy’s inner struggle, Poledouris had to pull his musical images from other dramatic points. His ability to do this comes not just from formal training , but from his own talent for observing life differently than many of his contemporaries.\n\nPerhaps it was a childhood cross-pollinated with California living and a classical musical education that developed Poledouris’ ability to weave life’s emotional experiences into a rhythmic sound. “I didn’t hear much rock ’n’ roll,” he remembers. “I was always a fan of Miklós Rózsa (TIME AFTER TIME, THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD) as a kid and I studied piano since I was seven. Basically, everything I listened to was classical until I got interested in film scores. There wasn’t much available — Alfred Newman’s BEN-HUR, THE ROBE; I wore that record out.\n\n“I had always been interested in photography, and knew I wanted to write music to go along with my slide shows. This had much to do with my career choice.”\n\nDiscarding thoughts of being a concert pianist, Poledouris eventually decided to attend USC because Rózsa taught composition there. But Rózsa had left. “Fortunately, his class was taken over by David Raksin (LAURA), a fine composer and teacher. I continued in the school of music for another year, until I became disenchanted with what they were doing with modern composition. It really didn’t speak to me. I discovered the cinema department, spent a lot of time there and found that I really wanted to become a filmmaker. It had much more to say to my generation, so I became a film student and got my degree.\n\n“While I was at school, I was scoring my films and those of other students. That led me back to music. I agonized for over a year about whether I wanted to give up music completely. It had been my life up to that point and, interestingly enough, my parents were more upset when I didn’t want to become a musician. Usually, it’s the other way around.\n\n“I started working as a film editor for an educational house; it was the only job I could get. We had an understanding that I could write music for their movies, which I did after the second film. I did about 100 educational and industrial films. That’s where I learned how to handle each choir of the orchestra, what’s possible and what their limitations are.”\n\nSymphonic Sequels\n\nPoledouris’ first full feature was the 1971 TV movie CONGRATULATIONS, IT’S A BOY! for producer Aaron Spelling. Since then he has scored a variety of genres from horror (TINTORERA) to comedy (PROTOCOL).\n\nROBOCOP 3 is his third film sequel, after CONAN THE DESTROYER and RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON. Like many of his contemporaries, Poledouris found himself faced with the choice between utilizing themes from his earlier scores and composing new material. “It really depends on the requirements,” he explains. “On RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, the producer and director didn’t want me to use any of the material from the first score with the exception of the ‘Love Theme,’ when we see the two characters (from the first film) dead at the sequel’s beginning. After that, they wanted it to be perceived as a new film instead of a rehash. The require­ments for CONAN THE DESTROYER and ROBO­COP 3 were exactly the opposite. They wanted to use all the thematic material.”\n\nThe producers’ wish to draw from ROBOCOP’S score wasn’t simply a matter of restructuring the music to fit this film’s ac­tion. Since new supporting characters are in­troduced and director Fred Dekker took a less violent ap­proach. Poledouris was easily inspired to create new musical voices. “In the first film, the arch-villain was Clarence. He had his own theme which suggested his kind of evil and, since he was killed off, you can’t bring that theme back. For ROBOCOP 3, we have a Samurai robot, which represents a different brand of evil. Its theme has notions that sug­gest moments of Kabuki, the ceremonial Kodo drum, and those great films like THE SEVEN SAMURAI. All those notions are blended together into something that works in a score context, and gives you this bad guy’s theme.\n\n“In addition, there’s a heroine in this film who helps RoboCop. She’s 11, and her char­acter needed a motif that certainly wasn’t in the first film. There’s also a theme for the Resistance, which is heroic but very hu­man — the triumph of the human spirit, tak­ing destiny into its own hands.”\n\nBoth of Poledouris’ RoboCop scores must, of course, orbit around the film’s central focus, Murphy. For the first adventure, the composer anchored his motifs within the story of a man who becomes a machine, and eventually gains back some of his lost hu­manity. “I was trying to hint at what it would be like, through the blend of electronic and acoustic music, to capture that kind of feeling. Every time he walked, we hit a fire ex­tinguisher with a hammer.” Poledouris reveals. “There are two major themes for RoboCop. The first is actually a fight theme which we used any time he did something heroic or action-oriented. The second was his ‘Home Theme,’ which deals with his humanity, his past, his wife, his child. That one comes up in flashbacks, or when there are similarities in his present life to his past life, his memories. That really represents\n\nRoboCop’s softer side.\n\n“In ROBOCOP 3, he’s not trying to redis­cover his humanity. He knows who he is, so he has fewer sharp edges. Since I felt his character was more resolved, the score isn’t as electronic. It blends more so that you don’t have that distinct electronic feel. The music is much more integrated as a whole, as I feel his character is. His dilemma in this film is to make the choice to disobey his OCP masters and go with the resistance.” The result is a score that’s more grounded in human emotions. Even the original RoboCop theme has less of a mechanical feel this time, symbolizing a man of flesh and blood, not steel and hydraulics. Only the Samurai robot echoes the composer’s earlier intent.\n\n“This is a mellower movie. It isn’t in­volved with the extreme violence which di­rector Paul Verhoeven used, to comic effect, in the first one. That was his intention, to just push the limits of what you can depict as violence on the screen. This new film doesn’t concern itself with violence. It’s much more plot-oriented. It deals with very timely issues, such as homelessness and people who are being shoved around. OCP is again the corporate ogre, cast in the role of a greedy pirate profiting at the expense of this country’s citizens. RoboCop becomes more like a freedom fighter than a police officer. Fred is a very talented young director.”\n\nFortissimo Features\n\nThe score for the first ROBOCOP is actu­ally a showcase for Poledouris’ versatility. The film is peppered with TV clips ranging from the “Media Breaks” to absurd com­mercials and a raucous sitcom. Each seg­ment was scored with original music and approached as a separate dramatic piece by the composer. The “Big Is Back” 6000 SUX spot, inspired by THE BEAST FROM 20.000 FATHOMS, had a typically ’50s-style ominous mood, while the sitcom clips bounced along with a brassy BENNY HILL-type motif. Even the OCP corporate promotional film, shown prior to ED-209’s introduction to the board of directors, had its own muzak-inspired theme. As in ROBOCOP 2, the TV spots this time are less pronounced, but the composer still had a few opportunities to deviate from the film’s style.\n\n“I used the same ‘Media Break’ theme, and got to compose another commercial. They also brought back the comedy show, but it’s a scene where an apartment complex is being knocked down by a wrecking ball. There’s so much noise and effects that all you hear is his ‘I’ll buy that for a dollar!’ line. We had a whole bunch of cues from the original, including a theme, but I didn’t get to use that, which was too bad.”\n\nIn his search for inspiration, Poledouris found it was unnecessary to visit the set. “I’m really against that, because I have to deal with the movie’s ‘reality.’ Sometimes you can get terribly misled by the actors’ personalities when it’s their characters for whom you’re writing. I would rather read the script, and then look at a rough cut. But I was on the sets for CONAN THE BARBARIAN and BIG WEDNESDAY, because some music was needed prior to shooting.”\n\nPoledouris was given the chance to con­duct the ROBOCOP 3 score, a task he couldn’t undertake on the first film because it was recorded in England. He was never far away, however, when conductors Howard (FLASH GORDON) Blake and Tony Britton took the podium for ROBOCOP. “I was in the re­cording booth, and we put everything together live. The score wasn’t mixed down from multi-tracks. The orchestra was on the main floor, and the electronics were in another studio. We had a video hook-up so the electronic musician, Derek Austin, could see the orchestral conductor.\n\n“Our engineer was Eric Tomlinson (Star Wars). His work is phenomenal. I al­ways enjoy working with him, because he’s both an extraordinary engineer and a musician. That’s good. He knows what to look for, and has it pretty well in mind after the second run-through.” Much of RoboCop’s score was written through the night, as the composer and or­chestrator Steven Scott Smalley camped out in the Beatles’ old studio at Abbey Road in an effort to meet a crushing deadline.\n\nPoledouris didn’t return to tune up ROBOCOP 2, for the simplest of reasons: “I was never asked. Irv Kershner had a rela­tionship Leonard Rosenman and I truly believe the director should hire the composer. It’s a very important relationship. It should be, but every so often it isn’t. That’s how you end up with a score that sounds like mashed potatoes. If the director is truly in control, then it should be his choice. You don’t want to work with a director who doesn’t want you on the picture. That’s a miserable prospect for both parties.”\n\nThroughout his career, Poledouris has been fortunate to link up with several direc­tors whose styles have blended harmo­niously with his own. His own first marriage of vision and sound was the result of his college friendship with John Milius (CONAN THE BARBARIAN). “We used to have a piano in the front living room of my fraternity,” the composer reminisces. “John used to come over and sit in this big chair by the piano and make up stories. I would create music that would go along with them — that was our pastime. And that’s all we do now, only we get paid to do it.\n\n“We went through film school together. He liked the kind of stuff I wrote. We both admired composers like Ennio Morricone and Jerry Goldsmith. He introduced me to the films of Akira Kurosawa, which were new to us then. At that time, the big-name directors were Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Stanley Kubrick and Stanley Kramer. They sort of glossed over the Japanese filmmakers, and John was the one who really introduced all of us, Matthew Robbins, George Lucas and everybody to Kurosawa – THE SEVEN SAMURAI, YOJIMBO – great movies! John put much of that influence into the first CONAN and Lucas put it into STAR WARS. The Jedi Knights are very samurai.”\n\nAfter several years of doing his own stu­dent films, documentaries and television, Poledouris linked up with Milius for BIG WEDNESDAY. They teamed again for the first Conan screen adventure. Poledouris’ score became so identified with the Cimmerian that he was called back to score CONAN THE DESTROYER and, later, to compose the music for Universal Studios’ live CONAN SWORD AND SORCERY SPECTACULAR stage show.\n\n“That was really interesting,” he remarks. “It was more like doing a ballet because the music came first. I worked with the director, Gary Goddard, who went on to do MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. All we had, basically, was a script and a stopwatch. He would come over to my place and act out all the parts, and we would time them. The speech took 22 sec­onds, so I would write 22 seconds of music. It was done to an imaginary film, and that was terrific! I enjoyed the process immensely. It’s very much like cutting the movie to music. I was much more in control. The music could grow, because all I had was a start and stop timing and a couple of things to change in the middle. The hardest part was the fight, because we had no idea how long it would play. As it turns out, they choreographed the whole thing to that very lengthy piece of rhythmic stuff, the CONAN main theme. That’s the difference between concert music and film scoring: Concert mu­sic doesn’t have the constraints that writing for film has.”\n\nTwo other pieces of Poledouris’ work on continual public performance are the Circlevision film at Disneyland, AMERICAN JOURNEYS, a spectacular 180-degree travel­ogue, and the IMAX film FLYERS. “It’s a completely different kind of writing,” he says. “There’s no dramatic impetus. You’re not dealing with conflicts and characters.”\n\nPhilharmonic Fantasy\n\nPoledouris has also teamed with director Randal Kleiser on several films, including the original BLUE LAGOON, and with Simon Wincer for LONESOME DOVE, HARLEY DAVID­SON AND THE MARLBORO MAN, QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER and FREE WILLY. After working with Milius again on RED DAWN, Poledouris joined up for the first time with Dutch director Paul Verhoeven for the Rutger Hauer medieval adventure FLESH+BLOOD. A fan of CONAN, Verhoeven wanted a similarly rousing score to this barely-released film, which was a forerunner of ROBOCOP in its presentation of graphic violence.\n\nOne of the composer’s favorite scores is CHERRY 2000, the offbeat adventure starring Melanie Griffith as a futuristic tracker who helps her client find a female robot in the badlands. “It was so bizarre, so strange,” Poledouris comments. “I like it a great deal, and enjoyed working with (director) Steve De Jarnatt. It was a difficult story to con­ceive, but I was strongly attracted to it be­cause it was so off-the-wall. We ran the gamut of musical styles in early talks. The first thing everyone said was that it had to be really modern, hip and cool, all the words that are meaningless when you’re talking about a specific project. I then realized that CHERRY 2000 was a modern Western. I call the score the ‘3 M’s,’ a mixture of (Wolf­gang Amadeus) Mozart, Morricone, and (Giorgio) Moroder.\n\n“CHERRY was the first time I had used electronics so strongly in the forefront of the acoustic instrumentation. I had used synthe­sizers in RED DAWN and many TV shows. Actually, the music for TV’s MISFITS OF SCIENCE was the progenitor of CHERRY 2000 and ROBOCOP. That was the first time I con­sidered the possibility of scoring solely with electronics in a dramatic context. I think that’s when the synthesizers started showing their voices in my scores as an important, in­tegral part of the orchestration. ROBOCOP was the fruition, but the seeds were planted back with MISFITS and CHERRY. I did a lot of electronic experimental scores with educa­tional films early on, but that was with older, clumsy equipment. They’re certainly more controlled now. In the last five years, they’ve taken a quantum leap.”\n\nAnother notable foray into television was the scoring of three episodes of the CBS re­vival of THE TWILIGHT ZONE in 1986. “A Message from Charity” was the story of a young girl in colonial New England who de­velops a telepathic bond with a boy in pre­ sent-day New England; “Monsters” focused on a child who believes his elderly next-door neighbor is a creature of the night; and “Profile in Silver,” concerned the adventures of a time traveler who prevents John F. Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nOrchestral Overtones\n\nPoledouris, who never seems to shirk any challenge, took on scoring the 14-hour mini­ series AMERIKA just prior to ROBOCOP. Over five full hours of music was required. “It was overwhelming. We were scoring the fi­nal segment as the next to last one aired! The mixing was done only three hours be­fore it went on the air in New York. It was right down to the wire. They had to satellite feed it and, in fact, I think the program be­gan airing while they were feeding it, so if anything had messed up, they might not have had the last half-hour!”\n\nDespite such a frantic, down-to-the-wire schedule, Poledouris was not unaware of the bad press that crippled public interest in the mini-series with regards to its “Red Menace” premise during normalization of U.S.-Soviet relations. “I try to remove myself as much as possible from the rest of the world when I’m writing. I don’t read a newspaper, listen to the radio, music, or go to the movies at all. I just try to stay completely in the world I’m writing about. I can’t turn it on and off like a water tap. There are writers who do, but I haven’t reached that point, and I don’t know if I ever will.”\n\nSimilar pressures came into play three years later in the 1990 blockbuster THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. When the Soviet Union fell, Paramount Pictures put everyone on red alert to get the picture out while it was still timely. “We lost the trappings of East and West,” Poledouris observes. “During edit­ing, communism started unraveling.” For RED OCTOBER, the composer had to give each submarine its own musical identity. In the case of the Russian sub, electronics represented the mysterious new technology, while the timeless souls of the crew spoke in song. As far back as 1984’s RED DAWN, Poledouris has recorded Russian lyrics and, as in CONAN, he wrote the words. “In the novel, Ramius’ wife was butchered due to some doctors’ bungling. This sets his whole plan in motion to turn over Red October to the Americans. It’s alluded to in the final film. The opening musical state­ment is:\n\n‘Cold, hard, empty.\n\nHow was I to know you would die.’\n\n“It sounds great in Russian and sets the mood. It’s as bleak as the landscape he’s looking at, an ice field when they’re leaving Vladivostok. I took the approach that I was a Russian songwriter hired to write the sub­marine’s hymn. What the song speaks to is the generation-long struggle it took to reach this level of technology. What I did was ab­stract that so it literally translates to:\n\n‘Hail to our fathers and forefathers,\n\nWe will keep the covenant with you,\n\nWe will keep the covenant with the Revolution.’\n\n“That refers to the 1912 revolution the whole society was based on, and the struggle it took, at the people’s expense, to come up with this masterful weapon of war. It’s ironic. The bridge section goes on to say:\n\n‘Sail on, sail on,\n\nQueen of the northern seas.’\n\n“Then, it speaks to the Revolution.”\n\nRecently in theaters are two more films he scored, FREE WILLY, a tale of a whale and the boy who loves him, and HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX. Currently, he’s scoring Steven Seagal’s new thriller. “I don’t mind working like a dog,” Basil Poledouris sighs, “because I love it!”"
