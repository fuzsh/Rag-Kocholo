        "text": "I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for movies to watch for a film score fan. I'm pretty open minded, I don't really care what genre the movie is. Even some horror movies have cool scores, infact the score is pretty important in a good horror movie. I'll go ahead and list some of my favorites:\n\nThe Village\n\nBatman Begins\n\nTitanic\n\nArmageddon\n\nDeep Blue Sea\n\nThe Island\n\nCharlie and THe Chocolate Factory\n\nThe Ring / Ring 2\n\nThe Rock\n\nCrimson Tide\n\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron\n\n-------\n\nIt's probably pretty obvious I like Hans Zimmer and guys that sound like him, but tell me what scores you guys like. It never hurts to broaden your musical tastes.\n\nHave you seen \"Der Untergang\"? I really think that´s a great movie... Of couse it´s not that kind of movie you can watch over and over again, but if you haven´t seen it, then I will recommend you to do so!\n\nMy favourite movies are \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", and \"Moulin Rouge\".... Popular all over the world I think\n\n- Any Hitchcock film with music by Bernard Hermann (and The Birds is probably worth seeing too from a soundtrack point of view)\n\n- Taxi Driver (another amazing score by Bernard Hermann)\n\n- Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name' trilogy i.e. A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly - music by Ennio Morricone\n\n- Dario Argento's horror films (also scored by Ennio Morricone) most notably The Bird With The Crystal Plumage/L'Uccello Dalle Piume Di Cristallo\n\n- Most of Angelo Badalamenti's scores are brilliant i.e. Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, Fire Walk With Me, City Of Lost Children\n\n- A Clockwork Orange (Wendy Carlos)\n\n- Contempt/Le Mepris (Georges Delerue)\n\n- The Usual Suspects (John Ottman)\n\nI am sure someone else probably mentioned it, but you should really add the Lord of the Rings soundtrack to the list. All of the songs are beautifully composed on a broad range of instruments. Also the soundtrack is on sale for $6.99 at Target, you should pick it up when you get a chance. Some of it I find very relaxing to listen to at night, or when I get back from work.\n\nI have all three LOTR albums (already on my Hardrive )\n\nBut you guys already have a thread about it... I was thinking this would be about more obscure stuff...\n\nBTW, John Barry's Dances with Wolves score is also damn good...\n\nLast of the Mohicans (forget the composer) but they have this extraordinary track called \"Promentory\"\n\nBy far my favorite track from Conan is \"Theology\". Basil Poledouris outdid himself in this film... don't think he ever topped it...\n\nI have all three LOTR albums (already on my Hardrive )\n\nBut you guys already have a thread about it...

Basil Poledouris outdid himself in this film... don't think he ever topped it...\n\nI agree, those are good scores. Last Of the Mohicans was actually composed by two different composers: Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman. But it was Trevor Jones that composed \"Promentory\" - which is truly an excellent track!!\n\nBand of Brothers (Its a seires, yes, but its soundtrack was composed by Michael Kamen, may he rest in peace)\n\nBackdraft (I havent seen the movie but the soundtrack is great. And like many of my favorites, its composed by Hans Zimmer.)\n\nThe Last Samurai (Also Hans Zimmer, very awesome score indeed)\n\nGreat Expectations (It has a nice score by Patrcik Doyle)\n\n13th Warrior (Soundtrack composed by Jerry Goldsmith, one of the soundtrack-masters)\n\nAnd ofcourse, you have to see anything involving Danny Elfman. Such as Nightmare before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, The Simpsons .\n\nFifth Element (Awesome music by Eric Serra)\n\nPrincess Mononoke (Soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, very very very nice)\n\nSpirited Away (Also soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi)\n\nThe Last of The Mohicans (One of the best scores in my opinion, composed by Trevor Jones and also a number of songs by Randy Edelman)\n\nBubba Ho-Tep (Not many people have seen this movie but its really cool and awesome. Its soundtrack was made by Brian Tyler.)\n\nI could go on and on..\n\n[edit] Ooups, looks like you guys already mentioned The Last of the Mohicans\n\n<u>The Lord Of The Rings:</u> Masterpiece! Both the movie and the score of course. The best there is!\n\n<u>The Unsaid:</u> Extremely haunting and beautiful score by Don Davis, and a very sad and gripping drama/thriller. Andy Garcia is superb in this film, as always.\n\n<u>The Secret Garden:</u> This is what got me into scores in the first place. Zbigniew Preisner delivers a magical and enchanting score, and the movie is just as magical even if it's a family/kids movie.\n\n<u>Tuck Everlasting:</u> Again a gorgeous, enchanting and magical score by William Ross. The movie is just as enchanting (I'm talking about the 2002 version now). The score reminds me a lot of <u>The Horse Whisperer</u>, by Thomas Newman, which I also definitely recommend.\n\n<u>The Cider House Rules:</u> Rachel Portman delivers a sweet, warming and beautiful melodic score in this completely adorable and touching family drama/tearjerker by Lasse Hallström.\n\nI highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend to ANYONE who loves orchestral music and ESPECIALLY film scores. It's probably the most beautiful theme I've ever heard for a movie and, in my opinion, definitely a high point for Jerry Goldsmith's career (my #1, favorite composer). The entire soundtrack is excellent but if you want a taste, download the theme.\n\nStar Trek First Contact\n\nEven if you're not a Star Trek fan, you don't need to be, there's nothing intrinsically Star Trek about the score unique to this movie.\n\nIn fact, I am so convinced it is worth having everyone listen to that I saw this post, and made a forum account just so I could make this post.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding a good clean version or don't have the means to acquire it, email me at [email protected] and I will hook you up over the 'net."
