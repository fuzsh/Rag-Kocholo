        "text": "Based on James Duff's play Homefront, this film follows a Vietnam veteran (Emilio Estevez) who returns home, but has problems adjusting to his old lifestyle and family. As Thanksgiving approaches, the tension escalates between Jeremy (Estevez), his mother (Academy-Award winner Kathy Bates), his father (and real-life dad, Martin Sheen), and his sister (Kimberly Williams), and it's not long before family tradition turns into war. Bates has an amazing edge as the victimized mother, and Estevez and Sheen provide an intense relationship that's ready to blow at any minute. Director Estevez keeps a perfect pace and never lets his actors overperform or run wildly, a difficult skill for many actor-turned-directors. The War at Home is perhaps most amazing in its depiction of interfamilial politics and roles. Recommended. (L. Russo)"
