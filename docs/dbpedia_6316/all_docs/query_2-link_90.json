        "text": "Composed by Basil Poledouris\n\n1982 saw the arrival of pulp author Robert E. Howard’s most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, on the big screen in a movie of the same name. Having read a lot of Howard’s short stories, I will say that it’s a pretty faithful adaptation, though the title character, played by a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger, is much more reserved than his more bodacious literary counterpart. Those familiar with Howard’s work will also find a bit of Kull the Conqueror in the story elements. The story is set in a fictional prehistoric age. Raiders led by serpent-worshipping sorcerer Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) destroy Conan’s village, slaughter the adults, and enslave all the children, including Conan himself. When he comes of age, Conan hones his combat skills in the gladiatorial arena then gets free to engage on a string of adventures. Finding some companions, he seeks to rescue a king’s daughter from a cult. This cult is led by none other than Thulsa Doom.\n\nJohn Milius directed Conan the Barbarian, and had his longtime friend Basil Poledouris score it. Despite the producer’s insistence that they use pop music, Milius and Poledouris wanted an epic orchestral score and went in that direction. Poledouris’ final product is a masterpiece. It’s got the epic scope of the big budget Biblical and ancient productions from the 50s and 60s, but Poledouris infused it with a prehistoric spirit to reflect the story’s brutal setting. Also, many scenes featured little to no dialogue, meaning that Poledouris got to cut loose with a variety of large, sustained pieces from the bitter and tragic “Gift of Fury” to the pomp of “The Orgy.” Some of the less thematic underscore, even very simple pieces like “Wolf Witch,” are engaging because of how successful the composer is at evoking a primitive world. One can imagine marching wooly mammoths or a small tribe painting cave walls for ritualistic purposes.\n\nThere have been four releases of the score. The first is the original 49 minute album, which does a great job featuring every distinctive highlight. The only downside is that a few of the themes don’t get their chance for encore performances. Varese Sarabande issued an expanded, but far from complete release in 1992. Concerns over the sound quality of these releases led Prometheus Records to issue a near-complete score in 2010, with recreations of the score from Poledouris’ notes. Finally, capitalizing on the discovery of the original tapes, Intrada released a three-disc set. The Intrada release has all the music, plus alternate takes and the original score album. I definitely recommend the latest album and I will be referring to its tracks and timestamps in my review.\n\nThe main theme for Conan the Barbarian and its titular character is introduced in “Prologue/Anvil of Crom.” Specifically it appears after a minute of drums. Depending on the version you check out, you might get Mako’s opening dialogue promising “high adventure” before the theme bursts forth. Conan’s theme is lengthy, so much so that Poledouris only uses it in its entirety a few times. It nevertheless has a heavy presence throughout the score, with Poledouris using pieces or alterations of it depending on the scene. 1:10 sees the A-theme, which gets expanded or contracted at various points. It’s backed by a primal drum beat 1:58 sees the B-theme, a more heavily emotional section. Poledouris attaches a portion of this for the love theme (“The Wifeing”). The love theme is a melancholic romantic piece which underscores Conan’s little seen tender side and the difficulty of finding love while also seeking revenge.\n\nThe most famous piece of music is “Riders of Doom.” This introduces an action theme that usually appears on choir. It is identified with the villains, but can also be seen as a general theme for Conan’s action highlights. It’s apocalyptic and lays on the epicness thick. Poledouris put a lot of effort into the choral elements of his score, sometimes putting together real lyrics from Latin. Even the various iterations of the Riders of Doom theme have different lyrics. For example, “The Kitchen” invokes a variation of the name Hephaestus, a god of fire, as the heroes follow servants bearing cooked meat. One of the least-referenced themes is that for Friendship. This only appears twice, first for Conan’s bonding with Subotai in “Theology/Civilization” and then later on when his friends come to the rescue in “Tree of Woe.”\n\nPoledouris’ theme for Thulsa Doom and Cult of Seth does not underscore its villainy, but rather its allure. In fact this theme is really two variations of the same idea. “The Tower of Set” puts both of these together in a more restrained fashion. “The Mountain of Power Procession” turns the first version in a fanfare and march, underscoring the outwards pomp of the Cult of Seth. “The Orgy” one of the definite highlights, lets loose with the second version of the Cult theme. This piece captures the degenerate party atmosphere of the titular orgy, and also plays off ironically as it’s an uplifting tune for the villain’s lair. At 4:49 on the Intrada version the theme finally sees a change, with cymbal crashes accompanying the main melody after an unusual transformation sequence. The theme now repeats with much more power before dropping off before a reprise of Riders of Doom.\n\nNow for a rundown. I will skip over some of the shorter cues and focus on the really great stuff. After the opener in “Prologue/Anvil of Crom,” it’s “Riddle of Steel/Riders of Doom.” “Riddle of Steel” is a more peaceful rendition of Conan’s theme backed by pleasantly swirling strings as at this point he’s happily living as a child. At 1:37 a fanfare heralds the approach of Thulsa Doom’s raiders, introducing the Riders of Doom theme. “The Gift of Fury” scores a wordless and tragic sequence. It starts with a grandiose fanfare. Poledouris then uses mournful choir and lamenting portions of Conan’s theme. “Column of Sadness/Wheel of Pain” is another tragedy-laden piece against a wordless scene. “Column of Sadness” is an escalating sad piece that leads into creaking iron amidst a sinister melody around 1:20. This metallic aspect represents the children’s enslavement at a mill and goes on for a quite a while until 3:06. Here Conan’s theme gloriously bursts out as we fast forward many years to Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n“Pit Fights” is an effectively repetitive action cue that brutally builds up when Conan builds up a string of gladiatorial successes. “Atlantean Sword” is yet another wonderful cue for a wordless scene. It contains its own motif, a mystically laden piece that underscores an important discovery. Pieces of Conan’s theme are interspersed throughout as he claims the titular weapon for himself. “Warm Welcome” and “Wolf Witch” are a pair of simple yet entrancing cues based around percussion. “Theology/Civilization” showcases the Friendship theme “Hopefuls at the Tower of Set” is another primitive and repetitive piece where a sinister religious chant alternates with a horn/gong combo. I’ve already discussed “Tower of Set.” “The Snake/Infidels” is an action piece which hearkens back to “Pit Fights” before getting into a waltzy trumpet and string piece with a singular fanfare.\n\n“Wifeing” focuses on the love theme along with a sweeter iteration of Conan’s theme. After a couple short regal cues based at the Hall of King Osric, it’s on to Intrada’s first disc ender, a wonderful five minute piece called “The Leaving/The Search.” “The Leaving” centers around the love theme on clarinet and flute. Around 1:45 swirling strings lead to an outpouring of emotion and then subsides for another iteration of the love theme. Nearly three minutes in “The Search” starts. It’s a mix of drama and adventure with some alterations of Conan’s theme, constantly building on itself with more and more emotion and lush strings. 5:08 introduces a three-note trumpet fanfare that brings to mind the scores for spaghetti westerns. This accompanies Conan’s arrival on the skeleton-laden site of an old battle.\n\nDisc two on the Intrada set focuses on the Cult of Seth processional with “The Mountain of Power Procession.” The second version of the Cult of Seth theme makes a brief appearance at one point as well. “Capture” stands out for an evil glistening bit. “Tree of Woe/Recovery” is another two-piece track. “Tree of Woe” is effectively dismal with listless horns and strings and tinkling that suggests the oncoming of death. Two minutes in there’s an about-face in mood with the Friendship theme. Over halfway we get to “Recovery” a presentation of Conan’s entire theme with some heavenly choir thrown in. “The Kitchen/The Orgy” starts with a reiteration of the Riders of Doom theme and then the already discussed material in “Orgy.” “The Defilers’ features a wordless Riders of Doom theme. At 1:20 Conan’s theme returns in a straightforward lift from “Anvil of Crom.” This bridges into another wordless reprise of Riders of Doom. “Funeral Pyre” is an even more morose than usual version of the Love theme. The theme gets a large reprise on overwrought strings about 2:55.\n\nThere are three tracks labeled “Battle of the Mounds.” “Part I” starts with a preparation rhythm prep music as Conan and friends get ready for a big showdown. Over a minute in there’s a variation of Conan’s theme. Two minutes in a choir lends some assistance to the preparation rhythm. Conan’s theme makes a brief appearance as the character makes an unusual prayer to Crom. The rest of the track is the Riders of Doom theme with full choir. “Part II” features sneakier action material as the heroes lure the villains into their trap-laden area. “Part III” features a dramatic melody on horns as the battle reaches its climax. Over 20 seconds a lone trumpet heralds a helpful vision and then Conan’s theme comes in victoriously. At 1:22 the track segues into “Night of Doom.” This cue directly references “Gift of Fury” as Conan prepares for his final confrontation with Thulsa Doom. This track is full of religious choir and a softer version of Conan’s theme. 2:38 sees a brief reference of the Love theme before the haunting choral motif returns. The final confrontation is not a raucous version of Riders of Doom, but a low-key contest between Conan’s theme and the choral motif.\n\n“Head Chop” is a long tense string that leads to a brief reference to the Riders of Doom theme. “Orphans of Doom/The Awakening” is a wonderful climax. “Orphans of Doom” is a peaceful choral piece, backed by harp and woodwinds, that represents the end of Thulsa Doom’s influence over his cult. It contrasts wonderfully with all the violence, melancholy, and bombast of previous cues. “The Awakening starts with a likewise very peaceful version of Conan’s theme as he reflects on his adventure and ponders what to do next. After more peaceful material that actually briefly presents the motif from “Night of Doom” in the major key, the music lifts off at 3:13 with victorious horns. After 4:25 the music builds up with a repeating, three-note horn fanfare that explodes in glittering triumph. “Conan the King/End Title” goes back to the beginning, reprising “Prologue/Anvil of Crom” while also giving the Riders of Doom theme one last go.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite film scores. The themes are massive in scope. Poledouris’ use of the Conan theme, from full refrains to partial variations, shows great flexibility. There are so many spectacular cues to choose from and almost every track is a highlight you’re happy to get to. Poledouris also wonderfully gave off a prehistoric feel without losing the epic flavor from swords-and-sandal epics. I’m not lying when I rank this among the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings scores.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nTracklistings\n\nOriginal Album\n\nAnvil of Crom (2:30)\n\nRiddle of Steel/Riders of Doom (5:31)\n\nGift of Fury (3:47)\n\nWheel of Pain (4:05)\n\nAtlantean Sword (3:53)\n\nTheology/Civilization (3:10)\n\nWifeing (Theme of Love from “Conan the Barbarian”) (2:07)\n\nThe Search (3:05)\n\nThe Orgy (4:10)\n\nFuneral Pyre (4:28)\n\nBattle of the Mounds (4:48)\n\nOrphans of Doom/The Awakening (5:28)\n\n3-Disc Intrada Set\n\nDisc 1\n\nDisc 2\n\nDisc 3"
