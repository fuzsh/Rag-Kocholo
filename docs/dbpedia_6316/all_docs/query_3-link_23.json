The film vividly depicts a decade of antiwar resistance from the earliest Vietnam war protest in 1963 (with male protestors wearing suits and ties); to some of the most violent antiwar demonstrations of the era (1967-72); to the signing of the Paris Peace Agreement (1973) that formally ended the U.S. role in the war that tragically cost 58,220 American lives, and more than three million Vietnamese deaths.\n\nUsing a treasure trove of all the local TV news film shot in Madison in the 1960s, illuminated by more than twenty original on-camera interviews with student antiwar activists, university officials, Vietnam veterans, community leaders and police, The War at Home details the actions and events that turned the Midwestern city of Madison into one of the major domestic battlegrounds of the Antiwar Movement.\n\nGlenn Silber\n\nGLENN SILBER is a documentary film director and long-time network television news producer who has produced 90 primetime newsmagazine stories for various CBS News and ABC News broadcasts, as well as ten independent documentaries, mostly for PBS.\n\nSilber was twice nominated for an Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary.\n\nHe has also received two Emmy Awards, the George Polk Award, a Columbia-DuPont Silver Baton, the IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors) Award; and a Writers Guild Award, among dozens of awards and citations for his work as an independent producer/director and TV network broadcast journalist.\n\nHis most recent documentary work includes: Producer/Director/Writer on the one-hour investigative report, A DEATH IN ST.
