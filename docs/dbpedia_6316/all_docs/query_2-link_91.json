        "text": "I don't know if you've noticed those sections consistently shrinking. . .\n\nNo, what's killing movie themes and musical development is the movies: abbreviated or nonexistent opening credits sequences for a decent overture of statement of theme. Sound effects mixed so loud (and occurring so frequently) that the music necessarily takes a backseat. Directors specifically requesting a certain \"sound\" -- loud, simplistic, manipulative scoring. Brian Tyler, David Arnold -- there's a whole bunch of guys who have written fine music, but are now mostly reduced to nonstop aggressive action with very little structure (sound and fury, signifying nothing) because that's what the director wants. The whole Bruckheimer movie phenomenon, for which they want big dumb \"power anthem\" scores to accompany the big dumb films.\n\nThere's no shortage of composers in and out of Hollywood doing, and more importantly, capable of doing when given the chance, exciting things with film music. Don Davis, Howard Shore, Ed Shearmur, Adrian Johnston, Alexandre Azaria, Frederic Talgorn, Javier Navarette, John Powell, James Newton Howard, Harry Gregson-Williams, Alexandre Desplat, David Arnold, Aaron Zigman, Bruno Coulais, Philippe Rombi, Mark McKenzie, Cliff Eidelman not to mention all the new guys, Scott Glasgow, Ryan Shore, Guy Farley, etc etc. It's not that the good composers have gone anywhere. It's that films welcoming what can be recognized as good music are rarely being made anymore, at least in the most commercial and visible venues.\n\nIt seems like that guy's complaint is that film scores are not as hummable. While interesting to note that films don't have blaring anthems as much any more, that hardly means film composers are gone.\n\nTake, for example, John Williams. Our author asks us to provide composers who replaced him, but John Williams is still scoring movies His last major hummable/anthem score was Jurassic Park. Harry Potter came close, but for the most part, Williams has preferred to do more subtle and complex work than continue developing major anthems. Even with the Star Wars Prequels, the hummable bombastic music was variations on the original themes while the new music was much more complex and subtle.\n\nI simply don't accept the author's premise.\n\nThe reason why there are less bombastic soundtracks is because there are less bombastic movies being made.\n\nFurthermore, its kind of like asking where are all the great painters have gone because nobody does baroque or romantic pieces anymore.\n\nI see you mention al ot of composers but what a bout James Horner\n\nHis sound Track are just fantastic !\n\nNext: 10 Great Movie Composers by Ken Nail\n\n\"Music is as important a part of the movie experience as the popcorn. The right music will complement and comment on the visual story and dialogue, taking the film to higher levels of emotion and excitement. Sometimes movie music is familiar ? well-known pop, jazz, or classical melodies. More often the music is composed specifically for the film. While modern audiences take a musical background for granted, it was once a novelty. Watch classic early sound movies like the original Dracula (1931) or Frankenstein (1933), and you'll be struck by the lack of music behind the on-screen action.\n\nKing Kong (1933) changed that. Max Steiner's music was an integral part of the film, supporting the action and lending suspense. The success of the film and his score ensured that the sound of movies would never be the same. Since that time many fine composers have contributed some great music to the movies. Film composers don't have an easy job ? they must meld their ideas to fit the action and flow of the movie, often rearranging and cutting material as the film is edited. Usually the composer is working under a strict deadline, and there is little time for rewrites or revisions. While the best movie composers are in great demand, they're not \"ivory-tower\" artists ? they're hard-working musical craftsmen who know how to make the music complement the film without overshadowing it.\n\nLet's look at 10 composers whose work represents some of the best in movie music. For each composer I've picked a soundtrack album or a compilation album to introduce their work. If you've never explored the music of the movies, I hope this list gives you a good starting point. Give them a listen!\n\nJohn Barry\n\nThunderball\n\nOriginal motion picture soundtrack (remastered)\n\n(Capitol 72435-80589-2-5)\n\nJohn Barry's long and prolific career as a film composer now spans five decades, highlighted by three Academy Awards. He's best known to most moviegoers as the man who defined the musical style for the many James Bond films. Thunderball (1965) is one of his best scores, combining the bold, brassy, and percussive action themes you expect in a Bond film with haunting motifs that complement the movie's many underwater scenes. The 2003 remastering of the original soundtrack album includes almost 45 minutes of excellent music left off of the original release. The recording sounds great ? crisp stereo separation, with a nice warm tones in the low, undulating flute and string melodies, contrasted by brilliant brass that is powerful, precise, but never \"tinny.\" The score's many sudden changes in volume provide an excellent test of your system's amplifier.\n\nTo experience the excitement of Barry's action scoring, check out the 11th track, \"007,\" a taut reworking of a percussive theme Barry originally composed for 1963's From Russia with Love. Then listen to \"Bond Below Disco Volante,\" for an interesting development of several of the themes employed in the movie. While Thunderball isn't my favorite Bond movie (I'll stick with Goldfinger), this installment has some of the most memorable music.\n\nBarry trivia: John Barry has been nominated for an Academy Award nomination in four different decades ? the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.\"\n\nBernard Herrmann\n\nThe Film Scores\n\nLos Angeles Philharmonic, Esa-Pekka Salonen\n\n(Sony Classical SK 62700)\n\n\"Bernard Hermann's film scoring runs the gamut, beginning with Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece Citizen Kane to his final film score, for Martin Scorsese's dark and disturbing Taxi Driver (1976). Perhaps Herrmann's best work came in his collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock. Herrmann composed the music for some of Hitch's greatest works, notably Psycho (1960), Vertigo (1958), and North by Northwest (1959). It's fitting that this 1996 recording includes music from six of his collaborations with Hitchcock, as well as selections from Francois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 (1966) and Taxi Driver.\n\nHermann departed from the lush melodic style of most of his contemporaries, emphasizing short rhythmic motifs to propel the action forward. The resulting musical tension is palpable in \"The Rainstorm,\" from Psycho, where the tense music emphasizes the nervousness of Janet Leigh's character. In the energetic \"North by Northwest: Overture\" note how Herrmann utilizes repeated rhythms to create a bright, sharp-edged tension. This recording is a real treat for Herrmann fans ? the L.A. Philharmonic sounds robust and bold, and conductor Salonen isn't afraid to let the orchestra run at full stride. The stereo CD disc is encoded with Dolby Pro Logic for a more enveloping experience if you've got a surround sound system, and is also available as a 2-channel SACD disc. If you want a good test of your system's low-frequency performance, go to \"The Man Who Knew Too Much: Prelude\" and see how well your speakers handle the explosive opening bars.\n\nHerrmann trivia: Herrmann appeared in front of the cameras, playing a conductor, in Hitchcock's 1956 film The Man Who Knew Too Much.\"\n\nBrilliant scores, all of them.\n\nErich Wolfgang Korngold\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood\n\nMoscow Symphony Orchestra, William Stromberg\n\n(Marco Polo 8.225268)\n\n\"Among the great film composers of Hollywood's \"Golden Era\" ? Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, and Alfred Newman, to name a few ? the composer with perhaps the greatest long-term impact was Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Korngold set new standards for compositional and scoring excellence during his career, thanks to his memorable use of melodic themes and bold orchestrations. Listening to a Korngold score is more akin to listening to a complete symphonic tone poem than a simple collection of musical cues.\n\nKorngold's Oscar-winning film score for 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood is a masterpiece of film composition. Korngold introduces distinct themes for all of the major characters, and then continually intertwines and develops these themes as the story develops. The strong musical narrative flows to match the story we're seeing on screen, one moment lush and romantic, the next suddenly bursting with energy, projecting a muscular vitality that matches the swashbuckling style of the movie. This excellent 2003 recording, on Marco Polo (a small label with a strong dedication to recreating classic film scores), benefits from William Stromberg's energetic conducting and the solid musicianship of the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. The recording has a lively palate of orchestral colors, with a lush, full sound that presents the mid to low frequencies particularly well. If your surround sound system has a DVD-Audio player, Marco Polo has released a multi-channel version of this album on DVD-Audio as well. To listen to an excellent example of the verve and energy Korngold invested in the music, go straight to \"The Battle ? The Duel ? The Victory,\" an exhilarating set piece with a strong, emotionally satisfying climax. My advice though, is to get out the excellent liner notes and listen to the disc straight through. You'll be glad you did!\n\nKorngold trivia: In 1936, while an Austrian citizen, Korngold had his music banned by the Nazis as \"decadent.\""
