Starship Troopers is a cult-classic sci-fi action film which follows the story of Johnny Rico and his friends as they serve in the military during a war with an alien species known as the Arachnids. This 2-LP deluxe edition marks the first-ever vinyl release for Basil Poledouris’ score for the film, and features newly commissioned album art, as well as a fold-out poster, and exclusive new liner notes from director Paul Verhoeven and musician/daughter of composer Zoë Poledouris.
