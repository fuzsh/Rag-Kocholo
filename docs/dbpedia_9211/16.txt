Description

The forint is the official currency of Hungary. The official currency symbol; Ft. The name forint, comes from Florence, where gold coins known as fiorino d’oro have been struck since 1252. From 1325 under Charles Robert, Hungary adopted florentinus (later forint), a gold-based currency, with several other countries following Hungary’s lead. The forint was the name used for the currency of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1868 and 1892. The introduction of the forint in 1946 was a critical step in stabilizing the Hungarian economy following World War II, as the pengõ had become nearly unusable due to significant hyperinflation between 1945 and 1946. Consequently, of the currency introduction, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Hungarian National Bank) issued notes in denominations of 10 and 100 forint, followed by a better quality series whose denominations were 10, 20, and 100 forint in 1947 and 1948. The 50 forint note was introduced in 1953, followed by the 500 forint in 1970, 1,000 forint in 1983, and 5,000 in 1991. Between 1997 and 2001, a totally redesigned new series of banknotes in values of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 forints was gradually issued. Nonetheless, a newly redesigned version of the 1997 banknote series entered circulation in 2014, starting with the 10,000 forint banknote and ending with the 500 forint banknote in 2019.

The 2000 forint note front design presents the portrait of Gabriel Bethlen (1580 – 1629) was Prince of Transylvania from 1613 to 1629, and Duke of Opole from 1622 to 1625. He was also the King-elect of Hungary from 1620 to 1621, but he never controlled the whole kingdom. The portrait is accompanied by the Shield of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Hungarian National Bank) logo and the silhouette of a royal hat, on a background the walls of the prince’s castle. The reverse of the note illustrates the Viktor Madarász’ (Hungarian painter, 1830 – 1917) painting “Gábor Bethlen among his scientists” and the Gabriel Bethlen’s Transylvanian Thaler, with his portrait (1621), on a background with a written parchment. The lettering of the note is presented in the Hungarian language. This note is part of the 2016 – 2020 series, and its color is brown and olive.
