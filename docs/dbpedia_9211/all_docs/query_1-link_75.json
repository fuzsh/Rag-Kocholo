        "text": "There are likely to be times in Hungary when cash is handy - for smaller purchases, tipping and taxis for example. Having some cash in your pocket is also reassuring in case your preferred payment card isn’t available or can't be accepted for some reason. Carrying too much cash is a security risk, so do be careful as tourists are often prey to opportunist thieves - in Hungary and the world over. Take out cash from ATMs little and often if you can.\n\nIdeal for: Those times when only cash will do - market purchases, tipping and taxis for example\n\nHow much cash should I bring to Hungary?\n\nThe budget you need to set for your trip depends a lot on what type of trip you’re expecting – you may be travelling or a shoestring, or you might be all up for a big blow out, with the very best of everything available in Hungary. In either case you can avoid spending money unnecessarily with a bit of advance planning, booking accommodation online before you travel, and looking out for deals and offers.\n\nHow much money do I need per day in Hungary?\n\nWhile the amount of money you need depends a lot on the type of trip you’re taking, there are some things pretty much all travellers need to consider, including:\n\nAccommodation\n\nMeals\n\nTransportation\n\nEntry to tourist locations\n\nActivities and entertainment\n\nTips and discretionary spend\n\nAny tourist taxes or visas that apply\n\nYou can start to set your budget for different spending types long before you travel - it’s also worth taking into consideration less obvious costs like the fees you’ll pay for currency conversion.\n\nThe exchange rate between the AUD and Hungarian Forint changes all the time, but getting a better rate means your money goes further when you’re in Hungary. Right now, 1 AUD/HUF = 239.522. Get familiar with the exchange rate by using a reputable online currency converter, so you know what to expect.\n\nIn Hungary, the average accommodation typically costs around 122 AUD per night, offering a wide range of options from cozy hostels to luxurious resorts, ensuring there's something to suit every traveler's budget. Local transportation, like buses, trains, and trams, provides convenient and affordable ways to explore the cities and other areas, with an average price of 18 AUD.\n\nDining experiences in Hungary offer many options, from fresh seafood to multicultural cuisines, with meals averaging around 33 AUD. For people seeking hassle-free adventures, organized tour packages are readily available, showcasing the country's iconic landmarks, wildlife encounters, and cultural highlights, with prices starting from 22 AUD.\n\nOutgoings average for one dayCosts in HungaryAccommodation122 AUDPublic transportation18 AUDMeal33 AUDEntertainment22 AUD\n\nIs Hungary expensive?\n\nThe amount of money you’ll spend in Hungary depends a lot on the type of travel you like - whether that’s low cost or luxury. You can always make sure you stick to your planned budget by booking accommodation well in advance, and looking for great local places to eat rather than sticking to tourist hotspots where the prices tend to be cranked up. There are loads of great, and up to date, online resources to help you plan your trip to Hungary which include hot tips and ways to save - do some research before you go to make your money go further.\n\nWhat is the best way to pay in Hungary?\n\nIt’s worth having a mixture of payment methods with you when you’re in Hungary, including cash and cards. While cards have reasonable acceptance, it’s not universal, so carrying one or more cards, and some cash means you can combine the convenience of card payments with the flexibility of having cash on hand for situations where cards may not be accepted.\n\nCan I use my bank card in Hungary?\n\nGenerally you can use your bank card in Hungary wherever the network is accepted. However you might find you can get a better deal with a specialist provider like Wise. Using a bank card issued in Australia for spending in Hungary may come with a few headaches. You might need to inform your bank of your travel plans in advance, you could run into fees such as foreign transaction fees - and there’s a good chance you won’t get the very best exchange rate available either.\n\nIs it better to exchange money in Australia or in Hungary?\n\nThere’s no strict right and wrong when it comes to exchanging currency in Australia versus Hungary. Ultimately, the best option comes down to the exchange rates and fees you can find both here and on arrival - and the convenience. Changing money on arrival means wasting precious time looking for a good deal, but carrying too much with you when you travel might not be the safest option.\n\nHaving some cash on hand can be very useful and reassuring, as you know you’ll always be able to pay for immediate expenses, or for emergencies. It’s also a handy back up if your preferred card isn’t accepted.\n\nBecause carrying lots of cash can make you a target of thieves, be sure to use the safety box in the hotel where you can, and split funds between a few different spots in your baggage as well. No matter whether you exchange at home or abroad, it’s also a smart idea to keep an eye on exchange rates so you’ll know you’re getting the best available deal on currency exchange.\n\nHow to buy HUF on arrival in Hungary?\n\nIf you plan on changing your money on arrival in Hungary you’ll want to research currency exchange options in advance to avoid wasting time on your trip. In many cases physical exchange offices are clustered in one area of a city, such as the CBD or financial area. Compare your options based on fees and rates available before you hand over any money. It’s also worth stressing the importance of using a licensed money changer to avoid scams.\n\nIf you don’t want to waste time changing your money to Hungarian Forint on arrival, consider an alternative like the Wise card. With the Wise card you can add money in AUD and tap to pay in HUF without needing to do a manual exchange. Your money is changed using the mid-market rate and low, transparent fee - with no extra foreign transaction fee to worry about.\n\nDoes Hungary accept AUD?\n\nGenerally it’s not possible to pay in AUD anywhere except in Australia. The official currency in Hungary is Hungarian Forint - and in most cases this is the only currency you can use to pay.\n\nConclusion - Best ways to take money to Hungary\n\nThere’s no single best way to spend in Hungary - and for most people, having a blend of payment options gives flexibility and reassurance. Consider getting a low cost debit card from an international provider like Wise, alongside your regular bank debit or credit card, and some cash in HUF. That way you’re prepared no matter what happens.\n\nFAQ - Best ways to take money to Hungary\n\nWhat is the best way to take money internationally?\n\nThe best way to take money with you when you travel depends on your personal preferences and where you’re headed - usually having an international debit or prepaid card, alongside your bank debit or credit card and a little cash is a smart plan.\n\nShould I exchange money before I travel to Hungary?\n\nWhile you can exchange money before you travel, it’s not necessary and can eat up your precious planning time. If you don’t want to change your money in advance you can get a low cost international card from a provider like Wise, to make ATM withdrawals with low or no fees when you arrive in your destination.\n\nCan I withdraw HUF from a local ATM?\n\nYou can’t withdraw Hungarian Forint from a local ATM in Australia. You’ll need to wait until you arrive to make a cash withdrawal - ATMs are often found in airports, train stations and other travel hubs to make this easier.\n\nAre debit travel cards a good way to take money to Hungary?\n\nGenerally debit travel cards are cheap and flexible for international spending and withdrawal. Pick a low cost international card from a provider like Wise, to get flexible international services and low overall fees.\n\nCan I use cash in Hungary?\n\nYou can often use cash, but carrying a lot of cash isn’t a smart move for safety. Using a mix of cards and cash, and making ATM withdrawals as and when you need to can give you the best of all worlds when it comes to your travel spending.\n\nData sources & references\n\nData on the cost of accommodation, meals, travel and entertainment is kindly provided by BudgetYourTrip.
