        "text": "How did the Jáchymov thalers become US dollars? The Czech Mint's bullion coin minted from one troy ounce of pure gold with the year 2024 and a renewed relief will remind you of this incredible story.\n\nThe lightning rod, the propeller, blood groups, genetics, contact lenses, sugar cubes and the word robot - all this is the work of our ingenious compatriots. But it is a little-known fact that we have also given the world its most famous and respected currency. Which is it? The dollar! Somewhere in Texas, no one probably knows that the roots of their famous currency go back to a mountain town in a small country in the heart of Europe. That's why it's worth remembering this forgotten Czech heritage, whose history began five centuries ago... The Jáchymov tolar was a silver coin that originated on the estate of the Šlik family in the Ore Mountains in 1520. The exceptionally high quality of the coin spread from the Bohemian Kingdom to the whole of Europe and its success prompted the minting of many imitations. From Hungary we know the distorted taller, from Poland the talar, from Greece the tàliro, from Italy the tallero, from Persia the dare, from Iceland the dalur and from Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands the daler. It was Dutch currency that spread around the world thanks to the boom in international trade in the 17th and 18th centuries. Dutch coins were used to pay in the Middle East, Indonesia and the Dutch colony in the New World, which later became New York. From there it was only a short step to the proverbial dollar - the Dutch pronunciation of the word daler is strikingly similar to the English pronunciation of the word dollar.\n\nAt the Czech Mint, we proudly adhere to the legacy of the Jáchymov mintmasters. It is fitting that in addition to coins with a nominal value in crowns, we also mint dollar coins - New Zealand, Fijian or Samoan. After five hundred years, the circle has come full circle and the dollars have returned to where they came from... In 2024, the bullion coin, which is the work of designer Ladislav Vraný and medallist MgA. Martin Dašek, the designer of the Mint of Prague, has a new relief - with a new decoration and a modified composition. While the reverse side presents three Jáchymov thalers, the obverse side features a pair of US dollars. Specifically, this is the motif of the very first coins minted by the United States in 1794, which borrowed not only the name but also the weight and purity of the metal used from their Czech ancestor. Since the coins of the Czech Mint are issued with the licence of a foreign issuer, which is the island of Niue, their obverse side still bears its necessary attributes - the national emblem, the nominal value of 50 DOLLARS (NZD) and the year of issue 2024.\n\nInvest smart, stylish and without VAT! In our offer you can also find other variants of the bullion coin \"Tolar\" made of gold and silver. This allows you to easily regulate how much money you invest in precious metals."
