        "text": "This page provides general instructions on using immigration records to do genealogical research. Individual guides for select sources are also available.\n\nOn this page\n\nBefore you start\n\nPlaces to look\n\nAbbreviations and terminology\n\nAccess the records\n\nRelated resources\n\nBefore you start\n\nGather information such as:\n\nname(s)\n\napproximate year of birth\n\ncountry of birth\n\napproximate year of arrival\n\nWhat to do if you don’t know when your ancestor immigrated\n\nKnowing the approximate year of arrival for your ancestor can help when you search databases. If you are not sure when your ancestor arrived, there are other resources you can search for clues.\n\nStarting in 1901, most census records indicated the year of arrival for immigrants.\n\nLand records may be helpful because immigrants often applied for land shortly after arrival, such as homesteaders in the prairie provinces.\n\nThe annual city directories can sometimes help. For example, if a person's name first appears in the directory in 1910, it is possible that they arrived in 1909.\n\nSome provincial death records indicated how many years the deceased person had lived in Canada.\n\nThe National Registration of 1940 asked “If an immigrant, in what year did you enter Canada?”\n\nSome immigration records and databases are held at provincial archives.\n\nPlaces to look\n\nThere are several kinds of immigration records, and each provides different information.\n\nRecords of arrival\n\nThe government recorded the names of people arriving by sea and by land.\n\nPassenger lists to 1935\n\nPassenger lists are an official government record of incoming passengers arriving in Canada by ship. These lists were not standardized until the twentieth century. They can contain information such as:\n\nthe name of the ship\n\nport and date of arrival\n\nname, age and country of origin\n\noccupation\n\ndestination\n\namount of money carried\n\nThere are no comprehensive collections of passenger lists before 1865. Most of our passenger lists date from 1865 to 1935.\n\nExplore these pages and databases:\n\nPassenger lists before 1865 – French Regime, 1608 to 1760\n\nPassenger lists before 1865 - British Regime, 1760 to 1865\n\nPassenger Lists for the Port of Quebec City and Other Ports, 1865-1922 (search by name)\n\nPassenger Lists, 1865-1922 (search by ship)\n\nPassenger Lists and Border Entries, 1925-1935 - Nominal Indexes\n\nManifest indexes, 1906-1920\n\nFor the years 1919 to 1924, individual Form 30A records were used to document arrivals by sea.\n\nBorder entry records, 1908 to 1935\n\nThe federal government started recording information about individuals arriving in Canada through the United States border in 1908. Since then, several different border entry forms have been used. They each collected different kinds of information, such as:\n\nname and age\n\ncountry of birth or citizenship\n\noccupation\n\ndestination\n\nport and date of entry\n\nFor the years 1908 to 1918 and 1925 to 1935, they used border entry lists.\n\nFor the years 1919 to 1924, they used individual Form 30 records to document arrivals by land.\n\nThere are no border entry records before 1908.\n\nImmigration records after 1935\n\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) holds the records of immigrants who arrived from 1936 to the present. Library and Archives Canada does not have copies of those records.\n\nYou can submit an application to IRCC by using one of their forms:\n\nAccess to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Online Request\n\nApplication for a Verification of Status (VOS) or Replacement of an Immigration Document\n\nYou can address questions about those forms to IRCC.\n\nOther records relating to arrivals\n\nYou may find references in various federal government records, including these:\n\nImmigration Branch Central Registry Files (RG76): Most of the records relate to administrative, policy and operational matters from 1893 to the mid-1900s. There are only a few files on individual immigrants and for those files, the person’s name usually appears in the title. There are other files relating to groups of immigrants. The word “lists” usually appears in those file titles. Examples include records relating to:\n\nimmigration reception buildings, sometimes called “sheds”, detention buildings and hospitals where immigrants were treated\n\nmedical examinations\n\nrefugees\n\nimmigrants from specific countries or ethnic and religious groups\n\nthe Empire Settlement Act, such as the 3000 British Families Settlement Scheme\n\norganizations that helped immigrants come to Canada, such as the Salvation Army and the Overseas Settlement Committee\n\nDepartment of Agriculture (RG17): That department was responsible for the administration of immigration from 1868 to 1892. Some of the files include names of immigrants. The file titles do not always specify if names are included.\n\nSome RG17 files relate to home children. You can search those files by name in our Home Children records database.\n\nDepartment of the Interior (RG15): There are some records relating to immigration to the western provinces in the period from 1892 to 1916.\n\nTo search for these types of government records:\n\nGo to Collection Search.\n\nSelect Advanced Search.\n\nIn the Database field, select Collections and Fonds.\n\nIn Any of these words, enter a keyword. Examples of keywords:\n\na person’s name\n\nimmigration, immigrant, emigrant, settler, settlement, refugees\n\nlists\n\nRG number, such as RG76, RG17 or RG15\n\na place or province in Canada or another country\n\nthe name of an organization\n\nbuilding, hospital, shed, detention, medical examination\n\nRecords of departure\n\nThe Government of Canada generally did not keep track of people leaving the country. There are no Canadian outgoing passenger lists or border entry records. However, records do exist in some select cases.\n\nDeportation records\n\nThere was no central register of deportees until the 1960s. Few deportation case files before that have survived. You can find lists of deportees in some government records. For information on finding those resources, consult our guide on deportation records.\n\nEnemy aliens\n\nIn times of war, the government has identified certain segments of the population as “enemies of the state” or “enemy aliens.” In some instances, such individuals were deported from Canada.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Japanese Canadians were designated as “enemy aliens.” From 1941 to 1947, Japanese Canadians were offered two options:\n\ndeportation to Japan (referred to at the time as “repatriation”)\n\nbeing sent to internment camps outside of British Columbia\n\n10,000 naturalized Canadian citizens of Japanese descent were deported to Japan.\n\nLAC holds this record relating to Japanese deportation:\n\nRepatriation of Japanese (RG76, volume 647, file A66589, parts 1 and 2, starts on microfilm C-10586 and continues on C-10587)\n\nThis file includes lists of naturalized Canadians repatriated to Japan from 1941 to 1947.\n\nTo learn more about Japanese Canadian internment and to find more archival records, see our guide on the topic.\n\nOther records relating to departures\n\nIf your ancestor left Canada, there may be other sources available:\n\nDuring the Second World War, women and children wanting to leave the country needed permission to do so. For example, a woman wishing to marry a serviceman in England or a widow or orphan returning to Scotland to live with family. You can find names and details in lists in this file:\n\nRegulations to control travel of women and children entering or leaving Canada during wartime, 1940-1946 (RG76, volumes 455-456, file 694686, microfilm C-10397 and C-10398)\n\nThe National Archives in England has a collection of inward passenger lists, 1878 to 1960. Many of those lists are for ships departing from Canadian ports. The lists are digitized and indexed on the subscription website Ancestry. It's available free at many libraries including Library and Archives Canada.\n\nThe names of Canadians entering the United States were usually recorded in American government border records, 1895 to 1956. Those lists are often referred to as the St. Alban’s lists. Most of the records are digitized and indexed on Ancestry and the free website FamilySearch.\n\nIf your ancestor moved to Maine, there may be a record of them in the Maine State Archives’ collection of digitized Alien Registrations.\n\nPublished sources\n\nKnowing the historical background about when and where your ancestor arrived can help you understand more about their experiences.\n\nTo search for books in our Aurora catalogue, use subject keywords such as “emigration and immigration”, immigrants, history and Canada or a particular province.\n\nHere are a few examples that show the range of books available.\n\nA bittersweet land: the Dutch experience in Canada, 1890-1980\n\nEmigrants and Empire: British Settlement in the Dominions Between the Wars\n\nLes Vendéens au Canada : une épopée migratoire, 1880-1920\n\nPionniers : l'avant-garde de l'immigration portuguaise : Canada 1953\n\nSettling Saskatchewan\n\nStrangers at our gates: Canadian immigration and immigration policy, 1540-1990\n\nAbbreviations and terminology\n\nThis list includes terminology relating to immigration and abbreviations found in immigration records, such as passenger lists and border entry records.\n\nNumbers found on immigration records might refer to a train ticket number, a passport number or an obsolete file number.
