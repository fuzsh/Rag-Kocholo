It is a unique and interesting currency that has been a key part of Hungary’s financial stability and success over the years. The forint used to be divided into 100 fillér but these fillér coins are no longer in circulation. The plural for the forinto is the forintok.\n\nThe name of the currency is derived from the city of Florence where gold coins called fiorino d’oro were minted way back in the 13th century. The forint is issued by the Hungarian National Bank, printed in Budapest and minted by the Hungarian Mint. Today, the Hungarian forint plays an important role in the economic health of the nation and is a vital part of Hungary’s relationship with neighbours like Austria, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\nHow is the Hungarian forintrecognised?\n\nThe Hungarian forint is recognised by the international currency code HUF and by the currency sign Ft. The ISO number for the forint is 4217. This is useful to know if you are looking for the Hungarian forint on any currency exchange boards or if you are dealing with the currency online.\n\nToday, the frequently used coins include the 5 Ft, 10 Ft, 20 Ft, 50 Ft, 100 Ft and the 200 Ft. The banknotes in current circulation include the 500 Ft, 1,000 Ft, 2,000 Ft, 5,000 Ft, 10,000 Ft and the 20,000 Ft.\n\nThe history of the Hungarian forint\n\nThe Hungarian forint has gone through periods of inflation and stability. The pengő was the currency used before the forint. The pengő was brought in between 1927 and 1946 to try to stabilise the post-World War 1 economy within Hungary.\n\nFollowing the pengő, the Hungarian forint was introduced to combat the inflation throughout the country. At the time the forint was introduced its value was linked directly to gold. As a result 1 kilogram of gold was equal to 13,210 forints in 1946.\n\nSince then the forint has fluctuated in value. During the 50s and 60s the currency was relatively stable but in the following decades the forint began to lose its purchasing power. In the 80s and 90s the Hungarian forint saw steep yearly inflation. Thankfully, in recent years the currency has stabilised and it has become competitive throughout the region once again.\n\nExchange rates\n\nNeed to send money to Hungary? If that’s the case then it may help to compare the Hungarian forint to other currencies around the world and the currencies of neighbouring countries like Austria, Romania or Serbia. Learning more about exchange rates will allow you to understand how the Hungarian economy is performing. You will then be able to identify the best time to send money to your family and friends. So, let’s take a look…\n\nIn 2022, the average exchange rate of the Hungarian forint to the Euro has been hovering around 1 EUR to 370 HUF. This should give you an indication of the size and power of the forint compared to major international currencies like the Euro. For example, in 2022 the average exchange rate of the Hungarian forint to the US dollar is close to 1 USD to 360 HUF.\n\nWhat about Hungary’s neighbours? Well, the average exchange rate of the Hungarian forint to the Serbian dinar during 2022 is around 1 RSD to 3.2 HUF. Unlike the Euro or the Dollar, the Serbian dinar provides a more revealing comparison to the Hungarian forint.\n\nThese exchange rates will help you to understand how the Hungarian forint is seen and valued around the world. They should provide you with a good understanding of the worth of the Hungarian forint in today’s market.\n\nThe Hungarian forint is growing in significance on the international stage. While the Hungarian government intends to replace the forint with the Euro at some point in the future, its unique local currency continues to play a vital role.
