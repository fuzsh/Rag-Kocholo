        "text": "Hungary, a country rich in history and thermal spas, provides a distinct combination of cultural heritage and natural beauty. Hungary captivates visitors with its diverse attractions, which range from the architectural splendour of Budapest to the rolling vineyards of Tokaj, the historic castles of Eger, and the serene waters of Lake Balaton. Understanding the local cash, ATMs in Hungary, and payment options is critical for navigating the financial landscape and providing a seamless experience. This guide will provide you with the financial knowledge you need to comfortably and confidently explore Hungary’s enchanting landscapes and vibrant cities, immersing yourself in its rich traditions and culinary delights.\n\nWill I need cash in Hungary or can I use only a card?\n\nIn Hungary, urban areas such as Budapest widely accept credit and debit cards, reducing the need for cash. Carry cash for smaller purchases or in more rural areas where digital payments are not popular.\n\nCash, while less important in cities, is essential for transactions in smaller towns, local markets, or for services such as public transport where digital payments may not be available.\n\nYou’ll need cash for:\n\nPurchasing local transport tickets\n\nTraditional markets and small vendors, especially in rural areas and at outdoor events.\n\nTips\n\nSmaller cafes and eateries, particularly in more remote locations.\n\nEntry fees for many local baths and thermal spas\n\nYou can use your card at:\n\nHotels\n\nCar rentals\n\nTourist attractions in Budapest and other major cities.\n\nUrban restaurants and bars.\n\nMajor retail chains and shopping malls\n\nCultural sites such as museums, galleries, and theatres.\n\nPlease keep in mind that some restaurants in touristy areas require a minimum spend to swipe a card.\n\nWhat currencies are accepted? Can US dollars, euros, or pounds be used in Hungary?\n\nHungary’s primary and most accepted currency is the Hungarian Forint (HUF). Note denominations include Ft 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000.\n\nEuros are accepted in many tourist destinations, large hotels, and some shops, particularly in Budapest. However, for the majority of transactions, particularly in small towns or for everyday purchases, the local currency is strongly preferred. US Dollars and Pounds are generally not accepted.\n\nHow to obtain local currency and money in Hungary?\n\nThere are three main ways to get cash in Hungary – ATMs, currency exchanges, and money transfers.\n\nPro Tip: Avoid purchasing Forint in your home country as its not a widely popular currency around the world. So it will be difficult to find at home (outside Europe), and if you do, the exchange rate will be low.\n\nWhere can you find ATMs in Hungary?\n\nThere are more than 4,800 ATMs in Hungary. More than 15 commercial and specialised banks in Hungary run them. Many of them can be found on main streets in cities, with a few options also available in smaller towns in Hungary.\n\nATMs are commonly found at:\n\nMajor airports\n\nMarket and town squares.\n\nEvery major town has its main tourist streets.\n\nShopping malls.\n\nFood lanes.\n\nBank branches.\n\nSome corporate buildings.\n\nThe following are the locations where ATMs will be difficult to find:\n\nSmall airports.\n\nIslands.\n\nRegional bus stops.\n\nInterior of the villages.\n\nIn small towns, off the main roads.\n\nRemote resorts and retreats.\n\nCurrency exchanges in Hungary\n\nYou can use these places to exchange money in Hungary:\n\nAuthorised currency exchange centres: You will find them in all touristy destinations branded as currency exchanges mainly near the market square in Budapest.\n\nBanks: Bank branches can also easily convert your currency to forint, especially from currencies like US dollars, Euros, Pounds, Japanese Yen, Thai Baht, and Singapore dollars.

Don’t expect them to accept American Express, Diners, Discover, or Rupay cards.\n\nVisa and MasterCard are widely accepted for swipe transactions. You may be able to use your Amex only in a few places.\n\nCurrency exchanges prefer hard cash to exchange. If you need to swipe a card, use Visa or Mastercard. Please be aware of the fees you will incur if you use your card at a currency exchange.\n\nAre ATMs in Hungary comparable to other countries?\n\nYes, very much. The ATMs are modern in appearance and operation, similar to those found in the US, UK, Europe, Australia, and India. Some of them take your card completely inside during the transaction, so remember to take it after withdrawing cash from such ATMs.\n\nATMs can also offer currency conversion options such as ‘With Conversion’/’Accept Conversion’ or ‘Without Conversion’/’Decline Conversion’. To avoid optional extra fees, select ‘Without Conversion’ or ‘Decline Conversion’.\n\nATMs in Hungary are most commonly found in the following banks:\n\nUnicredit\n\nOTP Bank\n\nK&H Bank\n\nRaiffeisen\n\nErste Bank\n\nCIB Bank\n\nOther banks have ATMs that accept international debit and credit cards.\n\nWhat are ATMs called in Hungary?\n\nThe words ‘ATM’ or ‘Bankomat’ are commonly used, or signage displays the bank name without the word ‘ATM’.\n\nATM PIN types\n\nATMs in Hungary typically accept 4-digit PINs.\n\nFor swiping, Chip-and-PIN cards are common, but merchants also accept magnetic stripe cards.\n\nLanguages at ATMs and currency exchanges in Hungary\n\nATMs and currency exchanges in Hungary offer two language options by default: Hungarian and English. Some provide additional options, such as German and French. You get to select this option at the start of the transaction itself. If you don’t understand these languages, that’s okay. Use Google Translate’s camera function to translate the options on your phone in real-time. Please keep in mind that these translations are not always completely accurate, so don’t rush through the transaction.\n\nYou can also interact in the two languages mentioned above at currency exchanges in Hungary to get your money.\n\nATM fees and withdrawal limits in Hungary\n\nWithdrawal limit: ATMs typically limit withdrawals per transaction to between Ft 100,000 and Ft 200,000.\n\nATM fees: Here’s some good news.
