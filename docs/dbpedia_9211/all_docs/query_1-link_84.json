        "text": "Determinants of reserve management policy\n\n566. There are four special country characteristics that guide Hungary’s reserve management policy:\n\nsmall open economy\n\nemerging/converging country\n\nrelatively high foreign currency debt\n\nquasi-ERM-II exchange rate regime with no capital controls\n\n567. Hungary is a small open economy with an export/GDP ratio above 60 percent. This means that exchange rate developments have substantial influence on inflation. Hence, to run a successful exchange rate policy, Hungary must have sufficient foreign exchange reserves.\n\n568. Hungary is an emerging/converging country, with fast developing but still less liquid domestic financial markets. This means that the central bank cannot easily build up and down reserves via foreign exchange market operations. In addition, the costs of holding foreign exchange reserves (spread between borrowing and investment rates) are, although decreasing, still negative. These facts must be taken into consideration when determining the adequate size of reserves.\n\n569. Around 30 percent of the state debt is in foreign currency. The primary source of the annual EUR 2–3 billion debt service is the NBH’s foreign exchange reserves. Hence, the size and currency structure of the debt service are an important input to set the reserves management policy.\n\n570. The country’s primary objective is to join the European Union and then the Economic and Monetary Union. The NBH is already running a quasi-ERM-II exchange rate regime with no capital controls. The currency is pegged to the euro with a plus/minus 15 percent fluctuation band. In order to give credibility to the band, the NBH must have adequate reserves in the current “quasi” and later in the real ERM-II system."
