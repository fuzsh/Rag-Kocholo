As the Hungarian Forint (HUF) is the official currency in Hungary you’ll need to find convenient ways to spend in HUF while you’re there.\n\nThis guide walks through how to use the Wise card in Hungary for convenient and secure transactions, and offers some handy hints about making your money go further when you’re abroad.\n\nCan I use the Wise card in Hungary?\n\nIf you are a resident of the USA and have a Wise card - or if you’re thinking of getting one - you’re probably wondering: can I use my Wise card to pay for things in Hungary?\n\nThe answer is yes, you can use the Wise card for everyday spending in Hungary. You can use the card to pay for things in Hungarian Forints with competitive exchange rates and low transaction fees. This guide walks through how you’ll be able to use your Wise card to help manage your travel spending.\n\nIf you live in Hungary, the good news is that the Wise card is available for residents as long as they have the documents needed for verification - usually just an ID and a proof of local address.\n\nLearn more about the Wise card\n\nWhat happens if I move to Hungary?\n\nYou can continue using your Wise card in Hungary; simply update your home address in the app. You may also be asked to provide proof of residence by Wise.\n\nYes. Access to ATMs shouldn’t be a problem during your stay in Hungary.\n\nIt’s good to know that Hungary is well developed and ATMs can be found in most towns and cities - you’ll only usually run into a problem if you’re heading somewhere really off the beaten path. If that’s the case, plan in advance and stock up on HUF from an ATM while you can.\n\nGenerally having and using a low cost ATM card when you’re in Hungary is convenient, reliable and secure. You can take out cash little and often to avoid the need to carry too much at any one time, and spend with your card in stores and restaurants. Keep more than one way to pay in your pocket at any given time, so you’re prepared no matter what happens.\n\nThe Hungarian Forint (HUF) is the official currency in Hungary.\n\nYou can exchange your USD before you leave the USA if you’d like - but bear in mind that you won’t be able to spend USD in Hungary. If you arrive with cash in your pocket you’ll need to exchange it locally, which may come with unexpected costs, and take time out of your trip unnecessarily.\n\nA better plan for lots of people is to get a travel card for spending in HUF while in Hungary, with low costs and secure transactions."
