It is both the primary de facto global tender and the worldâs unofficial gold standard. According to the International Monetary Fund, 62% of the planetâs financial reserves are held in US dollars â more than double the total foreign holdings of euros, yen and renminbi combined. Thirty-one nations have either adopted it as their official currency or named their money after it; more than 66 countries peg the value of their currencies to it; and itâs now accepted in places as far-flung as North Korea, Siberia and research stations on the North Pole.\n\nYet, one place where the dollar is not accepted is in the tiny Czech town of JÃ¡chymov Â­â which is ironic, because it was here, tucked deep into the wooded folds of Bohemiaâs KruÅ¡nÃ© hory mountains, where the dollar originated 500 years ago in January 1520. But as I pulled a George Washington one-dollar bill from my wallet in JÃ¡chymovâs 16th-Century Royal Mint House museum, the very spot where the dollarâs earliest ancestors were coined, docent Jan FrancoviÄ smiled and stopped me.\n\nâI havenât seen one of these in a long time,â he said, calling over two colleagues. âIn JÃ¡chymov, we only accept koruna, euros or sometimes Russian rubles. Youâre the first American to come here in more than three years.â\n\nYou&rsquo;re the first American to come here in more than three years\n\nWelcome to JÃ¡chymov: a sleepy 2,700-person town near the Czech-German border thatâs both the home of the dollar and the home of no dollars. Chances are youâve never heard of the place. You probably didnât know that it was just named one of Unescoâs newest World Heritage sites. And you likely never realised that the currency that powers the free world originated in this one-road town still reeling from the collapse of communism that has more brothels than banks.\n\nIn fact, you could spend a day walking up and down JÃ¡chymovâs main drag, past its abandoned Gothic and Renaissance buildings that tumble down the hill, around its opulent cluster of day spas at the base of the valley and up to its 16th-Century castle, and never realise it was the birthplace of the dollar.\n\nâHow could you? There are no signs advertising it anywhere â most people living here donât even know!â said Michal Urban, director of the non-profit development Mountain Region KruÅ¡nÃ© hory â Erzgebirge and one of the authors of the regionâs Unesco nomination, as he led me down a dark staircase and into the mintâs vaulted basement where the coins were assayed. âNo other mining town in the world has had such a big influence as JÃ¡chymov, but weâve forgotten our history.â\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nâ¢ The top-secret meeting that helped win D-Day\n\nâ¢ The city that launched the publishing industry\n\nâ¢ The buried secrets of the deadliest location on Earth\n\nLong before JÃ¡chymov existed, the rolling mountains separating modern-day Bohemia and Saxony were ruled by wolves and bears who roamed its virgin forests. When vast quantities of silver were discovered in 1516, enterprising local nobleman Count Hieronymus Schlick christened the area Joachimsthal (âJoachimâs valleyâ) after Jesusâ grandfather, the local patron saint of miners.\n\nâAt the time, Europe was a continent of city-states with local rulers vying for power,â explained local historian Jaroslav Ochec. âWith no standard monetary unit among them, one of the most effective ways rulers could assert their control was to mint their own currency, and thatâs what Schlick did.â\n\nThe governing Bohemian Diet officially granted Schlick permission to mint his silver coins on 9 January 1520. The count stamped an image of Joachim on the front, the Bohemian lion on the back, and named his new currency âJoachimsthalersâ â which soon became shortened to âthalersâ.\n\nIn an age when the metal content of coins was the sole determinant of value, Schlick did two smart things to ensure the thalersâ spread and survival. First, he made the thaler the same weight and diameter as the 29.2g Guldengroschen coin used throughout much of central Europe, which made it easier for neighbouring kingdoms to accept it. More importantly, he minted more coins than the world had ever seen.\n\nIn just 10 years, Joachimsthal transformed from a 1,050-person hamlet to the largest mining centre in Europe â a bustling 18,000-person hub with 1,000 silver mines employing 8,000 miners. By 1533, Joachimsthal was the second-largest city in Bohemia after Prague, and by the mid-16th Century, Urban estimated that some 12 million thalers minted from these mountains had spread across Europe â far more than any other currency on the continent.\n\nJoachimsthalâs silver deposits soon ran dry, but by 1566, the thaler was so well known across Europe that when the Holy Roman Empire sought to establish a standard size and silver content for the many local currencies in its kingdom, it chose the thaler, calling all acceptable silver coins âReichsthalersâ (âthalers of the empireâ).\n\nâFor the next 300 years, many countries around the world modelled their money after the thaler,â Urban said, staring across JÃ¡chymovâs rusted metal roofs towards the hulking white shaft of Europeâs oldest continuously operated mine and the Schlick castle, which both still loom over the town. âSoon, the thaler started to live a life of its own far from here.â\n\nAs rulers across Europe began remodelling their coins after the thaler, they also renamed them in their own languages. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the thaler became known as the âdalerâ. In Iceland, it was the âdalurâ. Italy had the âtalleroâ, not to be confused with the âtalarâ (Poland), the âtÃ liroâ (Greece) or the âtallÃ©râ (Hungary). In France, it was âjocandaleâ, and âbefore long, there were some 1,500 imitations circulating among the tiny, tightly packed statelets of the Holy Roman Empire,â writes Jason Goodwin in his book Greenback: The Almighty Dollar and the Invention of America.\n\nThe thaler soon spread to Africa where it was used in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania as late as the 1940s â and across much of the Arab Peninsula and into India, where it was still in circulation through the 20th Century. The official currency of Slovenia was the âtolarâ until 2007. The money in Samoa is still called âtÄlÄâ. And the currencies in Romania (âleuâ), Bulgaria (âlevâ) and Moldovia (âleuâ) today all take their names from the lion stamped on the first thaler 500 years ago.\n\nBut it was the Dutch leeuwendaler (âlion dollarâ, or âdalerâ for short â pronounced nearly identically to the English âdollarâ) that gave the US currency its name. After first arriving in New Amsterdam in the 17th Century with Dutch colonists, the dalers quickly spread throughout the Thirteen Colonies and English-speaking settlers began calling them â and all similarly weighted silver coins, including the widely used Spanish real de a ocho (âpiece-of-eightâ) coin â âdollarsâ. The dollar became the USâ official currency in 1792 and ever since, the thaler-inspired dollar has continued its march across the globe to places like Australia, Namibia, Singapore and Fiji.\n\nYet, as Urban and Ochec led me out of the mint and past a barbed-wire fence holding a military lookout tower on a nearby hillside, I learned that the mines of JÃ¡chymov also have a much darker claim to fame.\n\nWhen the townâs shiny silver deposits dwindled, miners began to encounter a mysterious pitch-black substance that led to an alarmingly high incidence of fatal lung diseases. They called the uraninite mineral âPechblendeâ (âpechâ means âbad luckâ in German). While sifting through the townâs mines in 1898, a physicist named Marie Curie identified that the same ore that had produced the first dollars contained two new radioactive elements: radium and polonium. The discovery disfigured Curieâs hands, eventually killed her and led her to become the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. But it also set the stage for the town's unlikely second act: the same mines that coined the worldâs currency would now power the nuclear arms race.\n\nFor the next several decades, the townâs reopened silver mines became the worldâs foremost source of radium. The Nazis experimented with a nuclear reactor here. The âfather of the atomic bombâ, J Robert Oppenheimer, wrote his thesis on Joachimsthalâs uranium-rich shafts. And after Czechoslovakia reclaimed Joachimsthal from Germany after World War Two â renaming it JÃ¡chymov and expelling the German-speaking population that had lived here for centuries with Czech settlers â the government signed a secret treaty with Stalin that turned the town into a Russian gulag.\n\nâThis began a very doomed period of our history,â said Urban, crunching through the woods along the newly opened 8.5km JÃ¡chymov Hell trail that traces the valleyâs development from silver mining hub to Soviet concentration camp. âBefore the war, the people who lived here were very proud of creating the dollar. But when the population changed, this memory was lost and the mines became exploited to help Russia create the A-bomb.â\n\nToday, JÃ¡chymov is still grappling with its tumultuous past. The vast slagheaps that once scarred the valley are starting to be swallowed by evergreen trees. The rows of boarded-up 19th-Century homes built with toxic levels of uranium residue are slowly being gutted and restored to their former glory. And JÃ¡chymovâs last operational mine, Svornost, which supplied silver for the very first dollars, now pumps radioactive water to a trio of eerie, lavish resorts advertising âradon-water therapy.â\n\nThere are still no signs anywhere in JÃ¡chymov stating its rightful claim as the birthplace of the dollar. But if you head inside the townâs Royal Mint House museum and ask the docents to show you whatâs new for this yearâs quincentenary, theyâll proudly point behind the desk and show you a small frame holding a crisp new George Washington.\n\nPlaces That Changed the World is a BBC Travel series looking into how a destination has made a significant impact on the entire planet.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
