        "text": "The national day of the Hungarian currency in the calendar is 1st August because after the WWII on 1st August 1946 the forint became again the official currency of the country. But why we use a currency in Hungary whose name originated from the city of Florence?\n\nIn the Duchy of Florence, the coinage begun in 1252. This currency was called florentinus (golden forint), so in Hungarian florint and then forint. In Hungary only during the reign of the Italian Charles Robert (1308-1342) we started using coins minted from gold. The model was certainly the golden forint of Florence. Compared to the currency used in other European countries, the Hungarian golden forint had stabile value and was very searched. Considering that the counterfeiters spread more and more the false Hungarian golden forints in Europe, Charles Robert’s son, Luis I. (1342-1382) had to change the image on the coins to the image of St. Ladislav. Later, the Hungarian forint was minted with the image of various Hungarian kings.\n\nDuring the Ottoman occupation of Hungary (1526-1686) there was unsettled period in the history of the country. At this time two mintages worked in Hungary: the first one was located in Nándorfehérvár (nowadays Belgrade, Serbia), the other one in Modava (nowadays Romania). In these two mints the Ottoman coins “akçe” were minted. In the Ottoman territory of Hungary various Ottoman coins were used, just like akçe and penz (dinar). In Transylvania during this period the corona was used, while in the last land of Hungary, in the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom (part of the Holy Roman Empire) the forint remained in use.\n\nIn 1686 Hungary was liberated from the Ottoman occupation and became the part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1750, during the reign of Mary Theresa (1740-1780) a new currency based on silver was introduced. These new silver forints (Gulden in German) were used until 1857. Mary Theresa needed this change because she wanted to unify the various monetary systems in the territory of the Empire. In 1762 the first banknotes of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 forints were presented and in 1771 the new ones of 500 and 1000 forints were introduced. These banknotes were changed during the reign of Joseph II. (1780-1790) and Francis I. (1792-1835).\n\nThe economic and financial reforms were blocked during the Napoleonic wars. The French emperor occupied Vienna and due to this fact the Viennese mintage was moved to Pest and later to Nagyvárad (nowadays Oradea, Romania). Napoleon ordered to continue stamping banknotes in the mint of Vienna; therefore various types of banknotes were used in the territory of the Austrian Empire. The value of the currency tainted continuously. Therefore, the imperial court ordered the devaluation of all currency.\n\nDuring the revolution of 1848-49, Lajos Kossuth minister of finance tried to stabilize the financial situation in Hungary minting again forints that after the revolution were called emigrational forints or Kossuth banknotes. In Hungary the Hungarian forint and later the Austro-Hungarian forint remained in use until 1892 when the corona based on gold was introduced. The new coins contained 90% of gold.\n\nAs Hungary lost the WWI and the country was consequently separated from Austria, in the ’20 years the various governments tried to stabilize again the Hungarian corona and in 1927 the pengő was presented. The new currency was minted in Budapest and remained in use until 1st August 1946.\n\nThe first minted forints after the WWII were gold-based. The small change of the forint was the filler what was withdrawn from circulation in 1999 just like the coins of 1 and 2 forints in 2008.\n\nAs Hungary became the member of the European Union in 2004, probably the euro will be introduced that has been already accepted in several premises in Hungary though it has not become yet the official currency of the country."
