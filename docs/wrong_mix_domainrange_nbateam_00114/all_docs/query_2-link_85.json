        "text": "GUANGZHOU (FIBA World Championship) - Shane Battier is the \"ultimate team player\".\n\nThat's how Mike Kzryzewski felt about his All-American when he coached him at Duke, and that's how he feels about him now with the two together once again with Team USA.\n\nAfter Battier's work in Monday's 119-73 win over China on Monday, Team USA boss Kzryzewski said: \"Shane is the ultimate team player who generates an enthusiasm or work ethic that helps everyone.\n\n\"He's very selfless but still had a huge impact on the game. His importance on the game will never be measured by stats. But you can feel his performance when you watch it.\"\n\nThe USA squad currently numbers 14 and must be pruned down to 12 before the start of the tournament with the United States taking on Puerto Rico in their first game on August 19.\n\nBattier, it would appear, has a very good chance of making it to Japan.\n\n\"By the way, he`s very excited to be Yao`s team-mate, very excited,\" Kzryzewski said, referring to his Battier's switch from the Memphis Grizzlies to the Houston Rockets where Chinese basketball icon Yao is on the books.\n\nKzryzewski also praised his opponents for their endeavour and dogged display, which he feels made his team perform at their best.\n\n\"They played hard the whole game,\" Kzryzewski said. \"Our guys played hard the whole game so it was very good basketball. We`re proud of our performance and China made us play well.\"\n\nTeam USA Roster :\n\nCarmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets); Gilbert Arenas (Washington Wizards); Shane Battier (Houston Rockets); Chris Bosh (Toronto Raptors); Bruce Bowen (San Antonio Spurs); Elton Brand (Los Angeles Clippers); Kirk Hinrich (Chicago Bulls); Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic); LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers); Antawn Jamison (Washington Wizards); Joe Johnson (Atlanta Hawks); Brad Miller Sacramento Kings); Chris Paul (New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets) and Dwyane Wade (Miami Heat).\n\nPA Sport"
