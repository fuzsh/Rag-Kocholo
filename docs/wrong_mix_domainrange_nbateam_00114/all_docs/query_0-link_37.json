        "text": "HOUSTON - The Houston Rockets not only beat the Los Angeles Lakers without Yao Ming, they made it look easy.\n\nAaron Brooks scored a career-high 34, Shane Battier sank five 3-pointers and added 23 and the Houston Rockets routed the Los Angeles Lakers 99-87 on Sunday to even their Western Conference semifinal at two games apiece.\n\nLuis Scola had 11 points and 14 rebounds as the Rockets got exactly the team effort they needed after Yao broke his left foot in the Lakers' win in Game 3.\n\nGame 5 is Tuesday night in Los Angeles, and anyone who thought the Rockets were finished without their best player only needed to watch the first few minutes on Sunday, when Houston built a 22-7 lead.\n\nPau Gasol scored 30 points and Kobe Bryant had a quiet 15 for Los Angeles.\n\nLakers coach Phil Jackson warned his team about taking the Rockets too lightly after hearing about Yao's injury. But the Lakers looked lethargic from the start, giving away careless turnovers and playing lax defense.\n\nThe Rockets opened the game with a 22-7 run, starting 4-of-5 from 3-point range. Bryant scored the Lakers' first three baskets, but the rest of the team missed its first seven shots.\n\nHouston led 54-36 at the break. The Lakers grabbed only two offensive rebounds and generated only four fast-break points in their lowest-scoring half of the season. Battier had 15 points at halftime, two more than Bryant.\n\nCeltics 95, Magic 94\n\nORLANDO, Fla. - The defending champions aren't giving up their crown easily.\n\nGlen Davis made a 21-foot jumper as time expired to help the Boston Celtics hold off a furious rally and defeat the Orlando Magic 95-94 on Sunday night to even their Eastern Conference semifinal at two games apiece.\n\nDavis took the pass on the wing from Paul Pierce, swished the jumper over a charging Rashard Lewis and ran to half-court, where he was mobbed by teammates, leaving the Orlando home crowd silenced."
