        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Heading into the start of the regular season on Tuesday, Los Angeles Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said this year’s team has the best depth he’s ever been a part of on an NBA roster in recent memory.\n\nSo, it begs the question: Is this the best team ever that LeBron James has been a part of during his NBA career?\n\nIt’s hard to argue against the 2012-13 edition of the Miami Heat that won the second of back-to-back titles for the franchise.\n\nThat squad included one player already in the Basketball Hall of Fame in Ray Allen, and three others that should follow in James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nAdd Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, Mike Miller, Mario Chalmers and Rashard Lewis and it’s a pretty impressive roster that’s hard to top.\n\nBut this year’s Lakers are no slouches, with James and Anthony Davis leading them.\n\nAlong with Marc Gasol, Montrezl Harrell, Dennis Schröder, Kyle Kuzma, Wes Matthews and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, L.A. offers a deep, talented and versatile roster that rivals the Heat.\n\nHere are the full rosters for both teams:\n\n2012-13 Miami Heat: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Mario Chalmers, Joel Anthony, Shane Battier, Norris Cole, Chris Anderson, Terrel Harris, Udonis Haslem, Juwan Howard, James Jones, Mike Miller, Dexter Pittman, Josh Harrellson, Jarvis Varnado.\n\nHead coach: Eric Spoelstra"
