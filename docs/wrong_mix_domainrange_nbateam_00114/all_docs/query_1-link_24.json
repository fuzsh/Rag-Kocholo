        "text": "Shane Battier was recruited by the Spurs and Thunder last offseason, with the Spurs envisioning him as a “stretch four,” which is the position he’s playing with Chris Bosh out. That doesn’t mean he’s watching their series. “I haven’t watched San Antonio, other than one time we played them,” Battier said.\n\nMcCain, who was the 16th overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, already has over 3 million followers on TikTok thanks to his dances and other viral videos. The 20-year-old even said that he hopes to include All-Star teammates Paul George and Tyrese Maxey in his content, during an exclusive interview with ClutchPoints. “If I could one day get Tyrese Maxey or Paul George in a TikTok that’d be amazing, but I’m not gonna force it in their faces by any means,” he stated. “Hopefully, I can get them in one after a big win or something.”\n\nDraymond Green on Klay Thompson leaving: I'm happy he's gone because he wasn't happy being here anymore\n\nSo, seeing his son Brent join new Phoenix Suns head coach Mike Budenholzer’s coaching staff as an assistant makes the 80-year-old papa feel good. Brent Barry announced the hire Tuesday evening on Twitter. “I’m happy for him that he is getting the opportunity to do something that he has wanted to do,” Rick Barry said. “I think any parent always wants the best for their children.”"
