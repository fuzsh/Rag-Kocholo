        "text": "LOS ANGELES — On a chalkboard in their locker room, right above the time they’re supposed to report to begin preparations for the Nuggets and the Western Conference finals, there was a single number, a simple message for all the Los Angeles Lakers to see.\n\n8.\n\nThat, of course, is the number of games the team would have to win to become NBA champions, a countdown that continued as a result of Sunday’s 89-70 victory over Houston in Game 7 of the conference semifinals.\n\nThe triumph may have saved the Lakers — for now — from the ignominy of falling woefully short of a title that seemed to be virtually conceded to the supremely talented squad from the moment the basketballs were rolled onto the floor last autumn.\n\nAnd, judging from the revelry that permeated the Staples Center for much of the afternoon, one got the sense David Stern was hovering somewhere in the building, ready to issue a proclamation that the playoffs were over, awarding the Larry O’Brien trophy to Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant.\n\nBut the truth is this game didn’t provide many answers for a team that came within one loss of elimination, one which will face renewed questions about its fortitude — perhaps as soon as Kenyon Martin pops Pau Gasol with a forearm shiver.\n\nThe Rockets, so gritty and gutty in extending the series to seven games in the face of crippling injuries, were DOA on Sunday. The visitors were held scoreless for the opening 5:08 of the game and didn’t get their first field goal until 4:43 remained in the quarter.\n\nBy then, Houston was down by nine. By midway through the second quarter, the deficit was 16. At that point, the flight attendants were already collecting the Nuggets’ boarding passes for their flight to California for the opening two games of the series, which will be played Tuesday and Thursday nights.\n\n“They picked up their aggression, and it’s not like we didn’t talk about that. We should have been ready for that and we weren’t,” Rockets coach Rick Adelman said. “We didn’t respond the way we needed to and we got down.”\n\nHouston guard Shane Battier admitted his team didn’t have the energy to match the Lakers’ opening burst, perhaps an understandable situation, given the effort it took to reach the decisive game.\n\n“Losing guys like Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming, they had a lot of role players who had to step up for them,” Lakers forward Luke Walton said. “That’s a lot easier to do when you’re playing on your home court.”\n\nPerhaps that’s why Lakers role players such as Trevor Ariza and Andrew Bynum came up so big. Bynum, in particular, had been a virtual ghost for much of the series, averaging just 14.5 minutes and 4.7 points in the opening six games against a team that, without Yao, had no inside presence.\n\nBut Sunday, the 7-footer was dominant from the start. Gasol finished with better numbers, a game-high 21 points with 18 rebounds, but he, like the rest of his teammates, fed off of Bynum, who finished with 14 points, the same as Bryant.\n\nNow comes Denver, which is far more talented than Houston and, unlike the Rockets, is healthy.\n\n“It’s not like we won this game and so we get a sigh of relief and say, ‘We’re going to the conference finals, these games will be easier,’ ” guard Derek Fisher said. “They’re as gifted a team in terms of physical ability, talent and strength as anybody.\n\n“We’ll definitely be challenged . . . but maybe now we understand how difficult it is to advance. You can’t just show up for games in the playoffs. I’m not saying that’s what we did this series, but now we should know that if you’re not ready to play from the start, you can get into a lot of trouble.”\n\nAnthony Cotton: 303-954-1292 or acotton@denverpost.com\n\nSeries schedule\n\nTuesday: 7 p.m. at L.A. Lakers\n\nThursday: 7 p.m. at L.A.
