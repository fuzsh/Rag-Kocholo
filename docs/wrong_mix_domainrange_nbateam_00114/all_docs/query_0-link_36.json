        "text": "A former Duke basketball player will win the NBA Finals this season.\n\nJayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics won the Eastern Conference on Monday night, booking their second trip to the final series in three years. On the other side of the bracket, the Dallas Mavericks couldn’t close out the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals, but Kyrie Irving and Dereck Lively II’s team still leads the series 3-1. Even if Minnesota pulls off the miracle comeback, former Duke star Wendell Moore Jr. is on their bench.\n\nTatum, already the first Blue Devil with multiple All-NBA First Team nominations at 26 years old, could cement himself as the best NBA player in school history with a ring. Irving could make a similar claim with a title, however, as he already won a championship with the Cavaliers in 2016.\n\nWith the final stretch nearing, here’s a look back at every Duke basketball player who won an NBA title.\n\nJeff Mullins\n\nYear: 1975\n\nTeam: Golden State Warriors\n\nDanny Ferry\n\nYear: 2003\n\nTeam: San Antonio Spurs\n\nShane Battier\n\nYears: 2012, 2013\n\nTeam: Miami Heat\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nYear: 2016\n\nTeam: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nDahntay Jones\n\nYear: 2016\n\nTeam: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nQuinn Cook\n\nYears: 2018, 2020\n\nTeams: Cleveland Cavaliers (2018), Los Angeles Lakers (2020)\n\nJack White\n\nYear: 2023\n\nTeam: Denver Nuggets\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nYear: 2024\n\nTeam: Boston Celtics"
