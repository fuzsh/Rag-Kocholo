        "text": "March can reveal parity or bring out excellence, even the pursuit of perfection.\n\nThe 1957 North Carolina team survived a pair of three-overtime thrillers and went unbeaten. The 1974 N.C. State team avenged an early loss in a 30-1 season. And a dominant run from the 1999 Duke team ended in disappointment.\n\nAs Kentucky enters this year’s NCAA tournament with a 34-0 record, Triangle standouts Lennie Rosenbluth, David Thompson and Shane Battier reflect on their own March experiences and how they compare to what the Wildcats are about to face.\n\nMore NCAA Tournament coverage\n\nThompson recalls facing 'darlings of basketball' in UCLA\n\nAt 34-0, Kentucky is the clear-cut national championship favorite. The next six teams in the AP Top 25 each have less than five losses, giving the NCAA tournament a measure of title-worthy depth that's been missing since 2008, when four No. 1 seeds reached the Final Four.\n\nIn 1974, a deserving set of challengers finally interrupted UCLA's dominance.\n\nThe Bruins had won seven straight NCAA championships and nine of the last 10, but they entered that postseason with three losses and a No. 2 national ranking. The top spot belonged to N.C. State, which had crumbled in the last 10 minutes of an 84-66 loss to UCLA in mid-December.\n\n\"We were embarrassed by how much we lost,\" Wolfpack star David Thompson said last week. \"At the time, we thought we were the best team in basketball. We finally had a chance to prove it in the NCAA tournament.''\n\nN.C. State redeemed itself at the Final Four in Greensboro, beating UCLA 80-77 in two overtimes and defeating Marquette in the championship game to finish 30-1.\n\nAs Duke, Virginia and a handful of other teams prepare for the possibility of a deep postseason run, Kentucky is the targeted powerhouse with UCLA-sized expectations.\n\n\"You're playing against UCLA, and they are like the darlings of basketball,\" Thompson said. \"You're going up against stars, and there was a lot of pressure on us. To be able to beat them in that game was very special. Going against legendary (figures) like John Wooden, Bill Walton, Jamaal Wilkes, Marques Johnson - they had (eight) guys on that team that were first-team All-Americans or played in the NBA. That was just a fantastic team.\"\n\nThe Wolfpack had Thompson, 7-foot-2 center Tommy Burleson, 5-7 point guard Monte Towe and Tim Stoddard as key returners from a 27-0 team that was ineligible for the 1973 NCAA tournament due to charges of recruiting violations. Mo Rivers and Phil Spence stepped in as impact transfers in 1974, and N.C. State had replaced UCLA as the top-ranked team by the time a 103-100 overtime victory against fifth-ranked Maryland in the ACC final gave coach Norm Sloan's club its much-anticipated NCAA berth.\n\nTo succeed as much as they did in that era, the UCLA and N.C. State teams possessed qualities that are present with modern-day Kentucky.\n\n\"To be undefeated, you have to be a little bit lucky and you have to have great guys who refuse to lose,\" Thompson said. \"That's what we had. We had guys like Monte Towe, Tim Stoddard, all those guys. They wouldn't accept defeat. We'd do whatever it took to win the basketball game.\"\n\n- Sammy Batten contributed to this story\n\nRosenbluth: It takes depth, and a little luck, to chase perfection\n\nLennie Rosenbluth, a Smith Center staple during North Carolina home games, had a second-row seat Saturday for the ACC tournament final in Greensboro.\n\nCollege basketball has changed dramatically since Rosenbluth, 82, led UNC's unbeaten national title run in 1957, but he still follows the sport closely enough to have valuable perspective on Kentucky's challenge.\n\nThe Wildcats are 34-0 entering this year's NCAA tournament.\n\n\"We had five really good shooters, good substitutes coming off the bench, a lot of confidence, great rebounders,\" Rosenbluth said. \"We outrebounded almost every team we played, but you have to be lucky. Kentucky, so far they've had a couple overtime games, so they've been lucky a couple of times, too.\"\n\nWith Rosenbluth averaging 28 points as a senior in 1957, North Carolina memorably won a pair of three-overtime games against Michigan State and a Wilt Chamberlain-led Kansas team at the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar Heels were the second school to go undefeated during an NCAA championship season, and Kentucky has a chance to become the eighth team with that distinction.\n\nThe Wildcats have survived a fair share of late-game drama. In an SEC opener, they trailed by one point in the final 30 seconds of regulation against visiting Ole Miss before tying the score and watching the Rebels miss a buzzer-beating jumper. Kentucky won 89-86 in overtime.\n\nFour days later, the Wildcats beat Texas A&M 70-64 in a two-overtime thriller. Kentucky's Trey Lyles made tying free throws with 6 seconds left in the first overtime, and a long 3-pointer from the Aggies missed at the buzzer, sending the game to a second extra session.\n\n\"When it comes to the NCAA tournament, not hitting a hot team against you, it's tough, and we were lucky,\" Rosenbluth said.\n\nUNC needed overtime to win 90-86 at South Carolina early in the 1957 season, and Rosenbluth recalled coach Frank McGuire telling the Tar Heels that they were beat during an early February visit to Maryland. They trailed by four points with 2 minutes left in regulation but forced overtime and improved to 17-0 with a double-OT victory.\n\nAfter defeating Wake Forest three times by a combined 16 points during the regular season, UNC met the 20th-ranked Demon Deacons in the semifinals of the ACC tournament, which determined the league's only NCAA tournament representative. Rosenbluth converted a three-point play on a hook shot in the closing seconds to give the Tar Heels a 61-59 victory, and they beat South Carolina by 20 points in the final.\n\nHow important is luck? It played an even bigger role in the NCAA semifinals than the final, when Rosenbluth fouled out with 1:45 remaining in regulation against Kansas and center Joe Quigg hit two free throws with 6 seconds left in the third overtime of a 54-53 victory. A day earlier, with Michigan State and UNC tied late in regulation, the Spartans' Jack Quiggle sank a halfcourt shot after time had run out.\n\nMichigan State had a two-point lead with 11 seconds left in the first overtime, but future All-America forward Johnny Green missed a free throw for the Spartans and UNC's Pete Brennan converted a coast-to-coast layup to force a second overtime.\n\nThere was no 3-point shot in college basketball then, so a successful free throw would have given Michigan State a two-possession advantage. Instead, the Tar Heels tied the score and won 74-70 in two overtimes.\n\nThe introduction of a 3-point arc created more opportunities for comebacks, and mid-major teams in the one-and-done era often have enough experience to upset high-profile programs.\n\nKentucky has plenty of young talent and unparalleled size, which prevents opponents from scoring efficiently close to the basket. The Wildcats could always run into a hot team, though.\n\n\"You've got so much parity,\" Rosenbluth said, \"and the 3-point shot makes a difference.\"\n\nBattier: 'Pressure of March is real'\n\nDuke wasn't undefeated when it entered the 1999 NCAA tournament, but the Blue Devils were undeniably dominant.\n\nAs Kentucky (34-0) attempts to complete the first perfect season since 1976, ESPN analyst Shane Battier can relate to what the Wildcats are feeling. In the history of college basketball, he played on one of the best teams that didn't win a national title.\n\n\"The pressure of March is real,\" Battier said Friday, moments after he was honored as an ACC Legend in Greensboro. \"You talk about Kentucky, the pressure you feel in conference play is markedly different. The pressure you're feeling in March, you're not just playing against the other team, you're playing against history, and you feel it.\n\n\"We felt it.\"\n\nBattier won a national championship as a Duke senior in 2001, leading the Blue Devils to a 35-4 record with a roster that included fellow stars Jay Williams, Carlos Boozer and Mike Dunleavy.\n\nIn 1999, with Elton Brand, Trajan Langdon, William Avery, Corey Maggette, Chris Carrawell and Battier playing prominent roles, the Blue Devils took a 37-1 record into the NCAA title game. Their only loss had occurred in November, when Cincinnati's Melvin Levett converted a tiebreaking dunk with 1 second left in the final of the Great Alaska Shootout.\n\nFour months and 32 consecutive victories later, top-seeded Duke suffered a stunning 77-74 loss to third-seeded Connecticut in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\n\"We went on an amazing run, really a historic run, one of the great runs in college basketball,\" Battier said. \"It's unfortunate - we didn't cap it off with a championship, so our team is forgotten. That's just the way it is if you don't win the championship. You aren't fully appreciated.\"\n\nThat Duke team had four players taken in the top 14 of the 1999 NBA draft, a future ACC Player of the Year in Carrawell, a future NBA All-Star in Boozer, and a career 1,000-point scorer in Nate James. The Blue Devils were so dominant that they averaged 91.8 points per game, allowed only 67.2 and went 19-0 with an average margin of 24.4 points against ACC competition.\n\nThe closest call in league play was an 87-79 win at Georgia Tech, and Duke rolled through four NCAA tournament games before posting a season-low point total in a 68-62 victory against Michigan State at the Final Four. UConn outshot and outrebounded the Blue Devils two days later, benefiting from Richard Hamilton's 27 points and a 10-minute stretch in which Ricky Moore scored all 13 of his points.\n\nKentucky, with a roster full of past McDonald's All-Americans and future NBA draft picks, is averaging 74.9 points per game while allowing only 54. The Wildcats trailed at halftime of five regular-season games and won five times by eight points or less against SEC competition, but the high stakes of NCAA tournament play are a different matter.\n\nJust ask Battier.\n\n\"We didn't play our best game against an excellent, excellent UConn team,\" Battier said. \"It'll be interesting to see how they handle that pressure the next few weeks.\""
