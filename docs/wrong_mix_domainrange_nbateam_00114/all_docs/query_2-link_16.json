        "text": "Kansas City, Mo. — Former Duke star Shane Battier, a product of Detroit Country Day, was selected Tuesday for the College Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nLongtime coach Lute Olson and the late Rick Majerus headline the 2019 class of six former players and three influential coaches. Joining them during the induction ceremony this November are former Indiana star Calbert Cheaney, Purdue’s Terry Dischinger, Ernie DiGregorio of Providence, UNLV’s Larry Johnson, Stanford standout Todd Lichti and longtime Valparaiso coach Homer Drew.\n\nOlson won 781 games during a decorated career at Long Beach State, Iowa and Arizona, taking the Hawkeyes to the Final Four and the Wildcats to a trio of Final Fours and winning the 1997 title.\n\nMajerus, who died in 2012, won 517 games at Marquette, Ball State, Utah and Saint Louis. He was best known for his time with the Utes, leading them to the national championship game in 1998.\n\nBattier played at Duke from 1997-2001, helping the Blue Devils win the national title in 2001. He played 13 seasons in the NBA, with stops at Memphis, Houston and Miami."
