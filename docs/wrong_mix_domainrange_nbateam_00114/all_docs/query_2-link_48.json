        "text": "Rockets GM Daryl Morey was on the Proper Gentlemen of Sports radio show on SportsTalk 790 FM on Thursday, to promote Shane Battier’s Clutch City Battioke event on September 17 (with special guest Roger Clemens[?!]). But while he was on the air, he was asked how he was feeling about Ty Lawson, the newest and most interesting Rocket. Feeling very good. The players organized, led by James Harden and Jason Terry, led them getting together for the entire week last week in L.A. Whereas team officials are allowed to watch, we can’t really do anything, but we were there to watch and support him. Ty was there everyday and looked great. You know who else looked great though? It’s Pat Beverley.\n\nCarmelo Anthony hated Battier and he had good reason. Battier had tremendous success against Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant during his career (yet oddly struggled against Jason Richardson) and at least one of his superstar opponents took offense. Battier recalled how much opponents hated going against him, whether it be due to disrespect or dread. “The looks of disdain I got from Carmelo Anthony every time,” Battier recalled. “I didn’t even try to shake his hand.”\n\nBattier managed to pull off the feat while also feeding his teammates bits of information here and there. The former Heat forward said he would give teammates “a baby spoon of data and they’d taste it and say, ‘Hey, it’s not bad. What else do you got?'” Battier said he stopped short of telling players like LeBron James what to do, but he would give tips such as what shoulder an opponent prefers to shoot over. “He’d have some success and you’d see him a little more open to the information,” Battier said.\n\nWhile he admitted having difficulty guarding the game’s elite scorers regardless, there was one player that was so predictable in the way he played that Battier felt good in his ability to consistently shut him down: Carmelo Anthony. “I had some success against him,” Battier said. “The numbers really play out with him, and as he’s gotten older, he has not been about reinvention. The last two years I played him, he did exactly what the scouting report said he was going to do, every single time. “A lot of players will deviate — Kobe was so tough in his prime, or Durant or LeBron. But Carmelo, I knew what he was doing. He was on the left block, he’s going to dip his right shoulder and go to his left hand every single time — he travels every time, by the way; he travels every single time. But if I made him use his right hand and go over his left shoulder, he didn’t want to do that. And as a result, I was able to drain his efficiency.”\n\nOn the player side, Shane Battier came up with a number of games that he believes would be ideal — not only to protect the athletes, but also to make the games that are played much more compelling. “Personally, I think a 60-game season would be perfect,” Battier said. “Every game matters more. You can’t sleepwalk through a few weeks of the season — it does happen — and then all of a sudden wake up near the All-Star break and turn it on. Fans just want to see the best basketball players in the world at their highest level going head-to-head. Every team has a certain number of throwaway games. You just know. You just know you’re not winning tonight. You don’t have it. And then after the game, coach knows it, everybody knows it, coach comes in, says ‘Alright, bring it in guys. We’ll get ‘em tomorrow. 1-2-3 team!’”"
