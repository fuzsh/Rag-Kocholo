        "text": "Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nOne of the intriguing situations of free agency is exactly where forward Shane Battier will end up when the NBA's free-agency period begins on December 9.\n\nThe ultimate preference of Battier would be to stay in Memphis. The Grizzlies have around $37 million on their books for the upcoming season but signing center Marc Gasol to a long-term deal is their top priority.\n\nAfter that, would Battier take a multi-year, mid-level-type of deal and would Memphis offer him one?\n\nIf not, several teams could use a good locker-room guy such as Battier, including the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he would fit in fantastically.\n\nHe's also a guy the Lakers could have a good bit of interest in.\n\nBattier would be respected immediately in the Lakers locker room and by their fans. He can guard the opposition's best player every night. He takes good shots and he's known as a great locker-room guy.\n\nWith a new coach in Mike Brown, Battier seems like the perfect fit for Brown's defensive, sometimes offensively challenged system.\n\nBut the thing that makes Battier the most attractive is all the intangibles he brings to a team.\n\nLoose balls, boxing out, smart decision-making, etc. You name it and Battier does it well.\n\nOn a team that already has that type of player in Kobe Bryant, Battier would fit in nicely with the Lakers.\n\nHe won't be exceptional offensively, but he won't have to be.\n\nHe'll be just a guy who does all the little things that sometimes today's athlete forgets about doing."
