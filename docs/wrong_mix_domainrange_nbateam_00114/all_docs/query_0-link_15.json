        "text": "About 90 minutes before Thursday's game, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said he had a \"couple of different\" starting lineups in mind.\n\nSpoelstra made the right choice when he decided to go with the one that included veteran Shane Battier.\n\nBattier provided the defense and LeBron James the offense as the Heat continued its quick recovery from its three-game losing streak with a convincing 98-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in a playoff-type atmosphere at AmericanAirlines Arena.\n\nThe Heat, who ended its recent road trip with three straight losses, have now won consecutive games against two of the best teams in the league, the San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers.\n\nAnd neither was close.\n\nWith the 6-foot-8 Battier bothering Kobe Bryant, the Heat raced to a 15-point halftime lead, equaling the Lakers' largest deficit all season. That lead swelled to 21 by the end of the third quarter before the Lakers cut into the lead in the final minutes.\n\nThe game lost some of its star power with Dwyane Wade (sprained ankle) inactive for the fifth time this season and second consecutive game. The Heat is 5-0 this season without Wade in the lineup.\n\nWith dueling \"MVP\" chants for James and Bryant - yes, enough Lakers fans were among the 20,004 in attendance to be heard - James clearly had the upper hand.\n\nJames scored 31 points, while Bryant, who surpassed 40 points in four of his last five games, finished with 24 on 8-of-21 shooting. Bryant scored 11 points in the final three minutes.\n\n\"Kobe and I have had 10 years of battles,\" Battier said. \"There is no one I respect more in this game than Kobe, for all that he is. You have to have a short memory because he's going to make tough shots on you. You have to move onto the next play and maintain your game plan.\"\n\nSpoelstra called Battier \"one of the most disciplined intelligent players\" he's been around.\n\n\"This game (is) a clear reason why we went after Shane and why we wanted him for four or five years,\" Spoelstra said. \"He simply does not make mistakes.\"\n\nBryant missed his first six shots, all jumpers, before making a short baseline jumper for his lone basket of the first quarter.\n\nBattier, meanwhile, helped pick up some of the early scoring load with two three-pointers. He finished with 11.\n\n\"Kobe is a roamer,\" Battier said. \"He doesn't really guard me when I play him.\"\n\nThe Heat got a boost from center Eddy Curry, who played for the first time since Dec. 17, 2009. Curry, who has dropped 60 to 70 pounds to around 320, finished with six points and three rebounds in six minutes.\n\n\"He's come along way,\" Spoelstra said. \"We know his history and he's put a lot of work, the majority on his own. It's good to see him get that opportunity and take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe Heat was able to counter the Lakers' size advantage with their outside shooting. Miami sizzled from long distance for the second consecutive game, making half of its 18 three-point attempts. The Heat is 25-of-44 (56.8 percent) from beyond the arc the last two games compared to 16-of-168 (36.3 percent) in its first 12 games.\n\n\"It'll continue to be a weapon for us,\" Spoelstra said. \"That's a manageable number. It wasn't a barrage. Some games we'll be able to get to the rim and attack and get all of the paint opportunities that we want but this team is big. They have trees under the rim and they make it tough on you.\n\n\"If they're offering up open threes we have the personnel that can make you pay for that.\"\n\nPau Gasol did his best to keep the Lakers in the game, finishing with 26 as the Lakers attempted to take advantage of their decided height advantage.\n\nThe Heat countered by bringing in a player that has logged more minutes sitting on the end of an NBA bench in a suit than any other on the last three years.\n\nSpoelstra said this was Curry's \"second hurdle\" - his first was making the team - and he was not sure Curry even would play.\n\nCurry entered late in the first quarter, soon after Josh McRoberts was hit with a technical for throwing a forearm shiver at James as James was driving to the basket."
