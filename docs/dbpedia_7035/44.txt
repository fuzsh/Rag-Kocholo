A brief history of Vaporwave

Vaporwave is a genre of electronic music that emerged in the early 2010s. It is characterized by its heavy use of sampling from ‘80s and ‘90s music and pop culture, slowed-down and re-pitched vocals, and an overall surreal, nostalgic aesthetic.

The roots of Vaporwave can be traced back to the experimental music scene of the ‘00s. Artists like James Ferraro and Daniel Lopatin (better known as Oneohtrix Point Never) were creating music that blurred the lines between ambient, glitch, and electronic music, often incorporating found sounds and obscure samples. Ferraro’s album “Far Side Virtual” from 2011 is often cited as a major influence on the Vaporwave movement.

In 2010 and 2011, two anonymous online collectives, named “Macintosh Plus” and “Chuck Person”, released two albums titled “Floral Shoppe” and “Chuck Person’s Eccojams Vol. 1” respectively. These two albums would become the touchstones for what would become Vaporwave.

“Floral Shoppe” was the first album to use the term “Vaporwave” in its artwork. It featured slowed-down samples of ‘80s pop songs, Japanese city pop, and smooth jazz, among others, all filtered through a dreamlike, nostalgic lens. The album’s aesthetic was heavily influenced by the glitchy, neon-soaked imagery of early internet days, such as old computer desktop screensavers.

“Eccojams Vol. 1” was a similar project, with samples from ‘80s pop hits chopped up and looped, creating a surreal and ethereal atmosphere. The album’s artwork featured a picture of Eliot Spitzer, the former Governor of New York who resigned amid a prostitution scandal, with his face heavily distorted.

Both “Floral Shoppe” and “Eccojams Vol. 1” quickly gained a cult following on online music forums like 4chan and Reddit, with listeners drawn to the hazy, hypnotic soundscapes they produced. Soon, other artists began to emerge, using the Vaporwave aesthetic to create their own unique sonic landscapes.

One of the most prominent Vaporwave artists was Saint Pepsi, who released a flurry of EPs and albums in the early 2010s. Saint Pepsi’s music was characterized by its upbeat, sample-heavy sound, drawing heavily from ‘80s pop, R&B, and disco. Despite the use of these upbeat samples, the overall atmosphere of Saint Pepsi’s music was still dreamy and surreal.

Another influential artist in the early years of Vaporwave was James Ferraro. Ferraro’s music was more experimental, often incorporating elements of noise and industrial music. Nevertheless, his work had a clear influence on the Vaporwave aesthetic, with its use of found sounds, obscure samples, and surreal imagery.

By 2013, Vaporwave had become a fully-fledged musical movement, with a vibrant online community and a range of subgenres and sub-movements. However, it was not long before the genre started to attract criticism, with some accusing it of being little more than a cynical nostalgia trip, devoid of any real substance.

What people have said about Vaporwave

One of the most notable books written on the subject is “Vaporwave and the Commodification of Ghosts” by Mark Fisher. In this book, Fisher explores the cultural and philosophical implications of vaporwave. He argues that vaporwave is a reaction to the hyperreal and consumerist nature of contemporary society, and that it offers a nostalgic escape from the present. He writes, “Vaporwave’s fascination with the outmoded is both reactionary and utopian. It proposes a kind of time-travel paradox, whereby the past is summoned as an escape from the present, yet its resurrection is only possible through present-day technology.”

Another book that delves into the world of vaporwave is “Asyncronous City” by Sean Han Tani. In this book, Tani traces the development of the genre from its early roots on 4chan to its current status. He examines the aesthetic and cultural elements of vaporwave, and argues that the genre is a commentary on the commodification of nostalgia. He writes, “Vaporwave represents a cultural moment in which nostalgia has been commodified, repackaged, and marketed, in much the same way as every other aspect of our society.”

Vaporwave has also been the subject of numerous articles and essays. In a piece for The Atlantic, journalist Robinson Meyer examined the political implications of vaporwave. He argued that the genre is a reaction to the growing inequality and political polarization of contemporary society. Meyer writes, “Vaporwave is a form of musical resistance to the dominant narrative of contemporary capitalism, one that rejects the artificial barriers between genres and aims to create a space for reflection and introspection.”

Musician and critic Adam Harper has also written extensively about vaporwave. In an essay for Dummy Mag, he explored the gender and racial politics of the genre. He argued that vaporwave reflects a nostalgia for a time when white men held cultural dominance. He writes, “Vaporwave is a music of white male privilege, a sound that yearns for a time when the boundaries of race and gender were more clearly defined.”

Despite the criticisms of some, vaporwave has a devoted fanbase who are passionate about the genre. In an interview with The Fader, musician Blank Banshee described the emotional appeal of vaporwave. He said, “There’s something about the sounds and the nostalgia that just pulls at your heartstrings. It’s like going home to a place that no longer exists, but you still remember it vividly.”

Vaporwave in context

In terms of the social context, Vaporwave emerged during a time of economic recession and cultural malaise, particularly among the millennial generation. Many young people found themselves struggling to find employment and purpose in a society that seemed to have little to offer beyond consumerism and superficial entertainment. Vaporwave’s nostalgia for a time when consumer culture was at its peak, combined with its critique of that same culture, resonated deeply with this disillusioned audience.

Culturally, Vaporwave drew on a range of influences, from Japanese ambient music and smooth jazz to 80s and 90s corporate aesthetics. Many of the genre’s early adopters were involved in online subcultures like 4chan and Tumblr, where they shared and discussed Vaporwave-inspired images, videos, and music. This sense of online community helped foster a DIY ethos that permeated the genre and helped it spread to a wider audience.

Technologically, Vaporwave emerged in a time when sample-based music was easier than ever to create thanks to new software and digital sampling technology. Early Vaporwave producers often used cheap or outdated gear to create their distinctive sound, drawing heavily on samples from sources like elevator music, infomercials, and corporate training videos.

Notable record labels played a key role in promoting and shaping the Vaporwave genre. One of the earliest and most influential labels was Dream Catalogue, which released seminal Vaporwave works like Macintosh Plus’ Floral Shoppe and 2814’s Birth of a New Day. Another important label was Business Casual, which released works by artists like waterfront dining and VAPERROR. These labels helped create a sense of community and identity around the genre, and helped popularize it among online music communities.

Journalists and critics played a crucial role in shaping the discourse around Vaporwave. Although mainstream music publications largely ignored the genre, online music writers began to take notice and write about its significance. Some writers like Adam Harper and Simon Reynolds praised Vaporwave’s subversive and innovative qualities, while others criticized it for being overly nostalgic or simply derivative. Regardless, these writers helped to place Vaporwave within a broader cultural context and raise its profile among music fans.

The rise of social media and online platforms like Bandcamp and Soundcloud were crucial to the popularity of Vaporwave. These platforms allowed producers to share their work and reach a large audience without the need for conventional distribution channels. Online communities like Reddit’s r/Vaporwave and 4chan’s /mu/ board helped to further popularize the genre and connect fans with like-minded individuals.
