        "text": "I discovered Vaporwave by chance in a blog (of which I don’t remember the name) back in 2014. It was just a paragraph of 9 or 10 lines and a couple of links to Youtube. One of the videos was evidently the Floral Shoppe of Macintosh Plus. Since that day I declared myself a fan of this genre and since then I have discovered countless very interesting artists, although the information I found about the origins of the genre and its structuring was scarce and/or confusing (at least for me). But one day in June 2022 the wonderful and necessary radio show El Club Lento presented by Álvaro Tarik premiered on Radio 3 Extra. Thanks to many of his episodes dedicated entirely to Vaporwave and its subgenres I understood better the idiosyncrasy that surrounds it.\n\nIn the hope of getting to know Vaporwave a little better, in this project I analyze and visualize interactively with data extracted from various sources the relationships between the different genres and subgenres associated with Vaporwave, the underlying feelings in the music of 100 songs, the geographical location of about 400 artists of the genre and the clustering of 1000 albums published between 2008 and 2023. It is an attempt to bring new approaches on how to explore this fantastic universe for newcomers and for those of us who have already enjoyed it for a while.\n\nBut before moving on to the visualizations it is pertinent to briefly explain what Vaporwave is and I think there is no better way than to go to the words of Álvaro Tarik, on June 24, 2022, in his first program of El Club Lento, where he exposed this brilliant definition of the genre:\n\nMore than a musical genre, vaporwave could be described as an aesthetic current, which is why the word aesthetics appears so recurrently linked to it. What is so special about this genre, or this micro-genre, of electronic music that, since its most important irruption in the music scene -back in 2011, with the release of the already legendary Floral Shoppe by Macintosh Plus-, so many people around the world have been captivated by its sounds and its aesthetics, that is to say, by its visual art?\n\nTo define vaporwave as concisely as possible, it is first necessary to understand that it is perhaps a mistake to get too serious in doing so. It is true that there is an arty will behind the music, a rather irreverent attempt to break with the imposed by the marketing in the background and in the form, even a tacit dystopian message that can justify it. But it is also true that, in tangible terms, vaporwave exudes a lot of irony, digital ugliness in many cases and musical principles that, without needing aggressiveness or histrionics, irritate reactionaries.\n\nThis is one of the things I like most about vaporwave: it sets a milestone in the history of popular music and, as it has happened with the different milestones that have marked currents through the decades, it has also aroused aversion among conservative positions. This underlines my motto that I have already made public on more than one occasion: If the music you listen to starts to please your parents, maybe it’s time to look for new things.\n\nI recover the words of Michael Nesmith, charismatic member of the Monkeys, in an interview for Rolling Stone in 2018 in which he confessed his enthusiasm at having discovered vaporwave. In his 70s and quite a few years he said:\n\n“I’d never heard anything like it before and I was passionate about it. I listen to it quite regularly now. I love it. The first reaction as you listen is that it’s abnormally slow. You think, this is weird, why are they singing like this? I don’t know, I like this. If you get the slightest bit distracted and turn to another train of thought, the music fading into that pool of liquid blue becomes captivating. It’s the most psychedelic thing I’ve heard since the psychedelics.”\n\nThe psychedelic aspect of vaporwave he refers to is striking. The fact is that it is a musical and aesthetic current with its own personality and that we should not confuse it with synthwave, trap, outrun, new age music, ambient, darkwave or smooth jazz, although sometimes styles overlap and artists mix music from different sources.\n\nThis trend has turned around a popular music that had been stagnant for a long time. And the truth is that not only has it achieved this, but it has also clearly influenced artists from other fields both musically and visually. The most critical and detractors, or simply those with reactionary attitudes, can become scandalized by what they simplistically consider stolen music or provocation in bad taste. Curiously, the same thing that already happened with hip hop, house music and, going back in history, with disco and rock and roll. In this, history will not cease to repeat itself in a loop of bold steps that are contested by those who prefer to remain legitimately in the comfort of the familiar. It is, as the psychologist Erich Fromm said, “the fear of freedom”. And curiously, vaporwave leapt into the future dragging behind it, as if in a tailwind, echoes of the past and returning them to our brains in a confused fog, as if it wanted to make us doubt that the past ever existed. Or if it is simply that some higher being has implanted it in our memory.\n\nOr maybe it is not that the world is going to disappear soon, but that perhaps it no longer exists and we have not yet realized it.\n\nÁlvaro Tarik, El Club Lento"
