        "text": "Simply put, Vaporwave is a musical genre and “art form” enjoyed by denizens of the internet. It was born circa 2011 on sites like 4Chan, BandCamp and Soundcloud, but its nicheness has worn off these past years, becoming more popular and thus becoming mainstream.\n\nVisually, Vaporwave can involve a combination of classical western art and modern east Asian writing systems and other motifs. Geometrical shapes and bright, saturated colors are also an accessory. True connoisseurs of Vaporwave additionally like underlying messages of nihilism, and a general feeling of emptiness. While most classical art is meant to make the observer feel something, Vaporwave is unique in that the goal is to make the observer feel nothing.\n\nMusically, Vaporwave is just as empty and nihilistic as it is visually. It takes inspiration from the 80’s and 90’s, exploiting the sentimentality many people hold from those decades. Vaporwave music is also usually high pitched and hollow-sounding, distorted and layered with even more high pitched sounds.\n\nExample.\n\n“But in strict regard to Vaporwave, I think that kind of coverage encourages people to over-intellectualize it, which in turn makes the people behind it appear unjustifiably pretentious (and in turn, completely moronic) given the type of music we specialize in. How much context can you really give to a doctored loop of a jazz instrumental?\n\n-Vektroid"
