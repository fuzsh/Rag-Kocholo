        "text": "221\n\nShare this\n\nVaporwave, a genre that has captivated a generation with its unique blend of nostalgia and critique of consumer culture, has emerged from the depths of the internet to influence contemporary art, music, and even fashion. Originating in the early 2010s, vaporwave’s aesthetic and sound have created a distinct cultural footprint, intertwining the past and present in a digital tapestry. It is an internet-based subculture that combines retro aesthetics from the 1980s and 1990s with electronic music, often featuring neon colors and glitch art.\n\nOrigins and Early Musical Influences\n\nVaporwave’s roots can be traced back to various subgenres of electronic music, particularly chillwave, hypnagogic pop, and seapunk. However, it distinguishes itself with a specific focus on the sounds and visuals of the 1980s and 1990s. Artists such as Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and James Ferraro played significant roles in shaping the early sound of vaporwave with their experimental use of retro samples and electronic distortion.\n\nThe genre is characterized by its heavy use of slowed-down samples of smooth jazz, elevator music, lounge, and corporate muzak. These samples are often manipulated through pitch shifting, reverb, and various effects to create a surreal, almost dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nA notable example of the vaporwave genre is the album “Floral Shoppe“, from 2011, by Macintosh Plus, a pseudonym of musician Vektroid. This album became a defining work for the genre, particularly due to its track “リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー” (pronounced “Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing“). This track is one of the most iconic and well-known pieces in vaporwave. It features a slowed-down and heavily manipulated sample of Diana Ross‘s song “It’s Your Move.” Both “Floral Shoppe” and this track have become emblematic of vaporwave’s distinctive sound and aesthetic, contributing significantly to the genre’s popularity and influence.\n\nVisual Aesthetics\n\nThe visual component of vaporwave is as crucial as its sound. It features a mishmash of early internet iconography, glitch art, 3D-rendered objects, and classical art references, often tinged with neon colors and retrofuturistic designs. Greek busts, Japanese text, Windows 95 interfaces, and tropical imagery are recurring motifs, creating a paradoxical sense of nostalgia for a past that never truly existed.\n\nThis aesthetic reflects a longing for the pre-digital era, evoking memories of a time when technology and media were just beginning to shape our daily lives. It also serves as a critique of late capitalism and consumer culture, highlighting the disposable nature of modern media and the emptiness of commercialism.\n\nCinema\n\nWhile there are no mainstream movies that can be explicitly classified as “vaporwave films,” several movies have drawn inspiration from the aesthetic and themes associated with the vaporwave movement. These films often feature retro-futuristic visuals, neon colors, nostalgic references to the 1980s and 1990s, and a critical take on consumer culture. Here are some notable examples:\n\n“Blade Runner” (1982). While not directly influenced by vaporwave (as it predates the genre), Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” has been a significant inspiration for the vaporwave movement. Its cyberpunk visuals, neon-lit urban landscapes, and Vangelis’ electronic score have had a lasting impact on the aesthetic and thematic elements of vaporwave.\n\n“Blade Runner 2049” (2017). Directed by Denis Villeneuve, “Blade Runner 2049” is heavily influenced by retro-futurism and cyberpunk aesthetics, which align with vaporwave’s visual style. The film’s neon-lit cityscapes, electronic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, and dystopian themes resonate with the vaporwave ethos of blending nostalgia with a critique of modernity.\n\n“Drive” (2011). Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, “Drive” features a moody, neon-soaked aesthetic that has been influential in the vaporwave community. The film’s soundtrack, composed by Cliff Martinez, includes synthwave tracks that complement the film’s retro yet modern vibe, similar to the music and visuals associated with vaporwave.\n\n“The Neon Demon” (2016). Another film by Nicolas Winding Refn, “The Neon Demon,” delves into the dark side of the fashion industry with striking neon visuals and a haunting electronic score by Cliff Martinez. The film’s aesthetic and themes of beauty and consumerism align with the critical undertones of vaporwave.\n\n“Her” (2013). Directed by Spike Jonze, “Her” explores themes of technology and human relationships with a soft, pastel-colored visual palette that evokes a sense of nostalgia and futurism. The film’s introspective and melancholic tone, combined with its retro-futuristic design, resonates with the emotional and visual aspects of vaporwave.\n\n“Spring Breakers” (2012). Directed by Harmony Korine, “Spring Breakers” employs vibrant neon colors and a disorienting narrative style to critique the hedonistic and consumerist culture of contemporary youth. The film’s aesthetic and soundtrack, featuring artists like Skrillex and Cliff Martinez, align with the surreal and satirical nature of vaporwave.\n\n“Turbo Kid” (2015) Directed by François Simard, Anouk Whissell, and Yoann-Karl Whissell, “Turbo Kid” is a homage to 1980s post-apocalyptic films and video games. Its retro aesthetics, synth-heavy soundtrack, and nostalgic references to 80s pop culture make it a film that resonates with the vaporwave sensibility.\n\n“Beyond the Black Rainbow” (2010). Directed by Panos Cosmatos, “Beyond the Black Rainbow” is a visually striking film that combines elements of 80s sci-fi and horror with a retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its use of neon colors, electronic score by Sinoia Caves, and surreal narrative align closely with the vaporwave aesthetic.\n\nCultural Critique and Nostalgia\n\nVaporwave’s relationship with nostalgia is complex. On one hand, it romanticizes the past, celebrating the aesthetics and sounds of a bygone era. On the other hand, it serves as a critique of that era’s underlying values, particularly the rise of consumer capitalism and the homogenization of culture through mass media.\n\nThe genre’s use of corporate muzak and advertising jingles underscores a sense of irony, juxtaposing the superficial cheerfulness of these sounds with a deeper sense of disillusionment. This duality makes vaporwave a form of social commentary, questioning the very systems that it appears to celebrate.\n\nInfluence and Legacy\n\nOver the past decade, vaporwave has influenced various other art forms and subcultures. It has spawned numerous subgenres, including future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour, each exploring different facets of the vaporwave aesthetic. The genre has also impacted mainstream music, with artists like Carly Rae Jepsen and Charlie XCX incorporating vaporwave elements into their work.\n\nIn the realm of visual art, vaporwave’s aesthetic has permeated fashion, graphic design, and even architecture. The genre’s distinct style can be seen in everything from streetwear brands to album covers, reflecting its broad cultural impact.\n\nConclusion\n\nVaporwave remains a fascinating and evolving genre that encapsulates the contradictions of modern life. It celebrates and critiques the digital age, offering a unique lens through which to view the intersection of nostalgia, technology, and consumer culture. As both a musical and visual movement, vaporwave continues to resonate with audiences, reflecting their anxieties and dreams in a rapidly changing world.\n\nThrough its haunting melodies and evocative imagery, vaporwave invites us to reflect on the past while questioning the future, making it a profound and enduring cultural phenomenon."
