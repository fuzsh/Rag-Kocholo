        "text": "Previous research on vaporwave has had a narrow focus on the most successful artists from the early period of vaporwave thus characterizing the genre’s aesthetic features as globalized music with nostalgia towards North American popular media from the 1980s to the early 2000s. In this paper, I study the perspective of Caribbean Hispanic vaporwave producers by analyzing the music scene through subjective spatiality as a new form of space on the internet. Drawing from online interviews with four producers from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba, I will discuss the cultural materials that are used in Caribbean vaporwave music from producers like Bloomstrad, S.a.x, 悲惨な forever, and Cubalibre.exe. I argue that Caribbean Hispanic vaporwave producers are great examples to understand how cultural context is reflected in vaporwave according to their geographical experiences. The preliminary findings of this research challenge defining vaporwave as drawing fromnostalgia based on aesthetic features from North American popular culture. With these data, the outcomes are used to argue that Caribbean vaporwave is an example of how the internet is an amplification of reality and a social lived space.\n\nThe slogan “vaporwave is dead” has haunted discourse about the genre since the mid-2010s. What exactly does this popular sentiment mean, and how can it be reconciled with today’s continuous stream of new vapor artists, performances, and releases? In this paper, I explore the wide range of statements that fans and artists alike have made regarding the nature of vaporwave’s death. I place these claims in conversation with a discussion of live vaporwave performance and its growth in the last half-decade. These multidimensional and multivalent phenomena offer a complex and fruitful site for examining the tangible manifestations of virtual music scenes. By combining a digital ethnography of vaporwave’s “death” with participant observations of live events, I demonstrate the complementarity of this seemingly contradictory superposition. Rather than identifying vapor’s continued liveness as a simple counterclaim to exaggerated reports of its demise, I pose vaporwave’s pairing of a morbid self-diagnosis and a vibrant live scene as an idiosyncratic expression of the genre’s broader preoccupations with the tension between memory and futurity, utopia and dystopia.\n\nThis paper serves as an attempt to make sense of fashwave, a short-lived attempt on the part of the alt-right movement to coopt vaporwave aesthetics toward a new subgenre of far-right music. While most of the writing on fashwave has focused on the alt-right’s attempt to make its extremist politics accessible through a departure from the abrasive soundscapes of previous far-right subgenres, this chapter focuses on the choice of vaporwave as a medium for fascist propaganda. The paper begins by situating fashwave within a legacy of far-right musical subgenres such as RAC (Rock Against Communism) and NSBM (National Socialist Black Metal). It goes on to argue that what made vaporwave so compelling as a medium for fascist appropriation is its use of nostalgic cultural signifiers from the 1980s and 1990s in an effort to create a totalizing and immersive synaesthetic world which evokes the alienation of Western millennials on the internet. The paper suggests that while fashwave may have failed in its effort to make fascism cool on the internet, its attempted cooption of vaporwave aesthetics offers an opportunity to critically reflect on the affective semiotics of popular aesthetics, and the political potential of atmospheres in the digital age.\n\nIn Retromania (2011) Simon Reynolds describes plunderphonics as resembling ‘an audio version of Pop Art, but with Warhol’s blank affection for mass culture replaced by a Zappa-esque sneer’ (Reynolds, 2011) but he also goes on to elucidate examples where the subject is treated with rather more reverence than is evident in works such as John Oswald’s visceral deconstruction of Michael Jackson in Plunderphonic (1989) – Oswald’s Grayfolded (1994)comes to mind. However,all plunderphonic compositions do have a shared engagement with the ghostly—dead sound archives, dead singers, dead fashions— and it is this ghostly chase that I shall be discussing. Utilising Jacques Derrida’s Specters of Marx (1993)as a starting point, I propose a three-way approach to plunderphonics and crate digging, extending both the historical and aesthetic boundaries of the genre: i. by intent, in Stockhausen’s affectionate deconstructions of global music traditions and anthems in Telemusik (1966) and Hymnen (1966-67), and The Caretaker’s ghostly dance with Al Bowlly’s long dead voice in the Haunted Ballroom Trilogy (2001-2003); ii. by chance in Cage’s anarchic Radio Music (1956), and iii. by progressive ablation in Christian Marclay’s Record Without a Cover (1985).\n\nContemporary modular approaches to sound synthesis selectively embody creative idioms and the often utopian ideals of historically counter-cultural approaches to electronic music composition. Within a distinctly post-digital approach to electronic music that embraces both limitations and affordances of historical analog workflows and more recent digital approaches, elements of Buchla and Serge systems can be found nestled among the diverse products of a contemporary modular cottage industry that has proliferated with the eurorack format of the 1990s. This proliferation meets a limited concept of ‘democratisation’ of music production, but beyond industry hyperbole equated with increased affordability and consumption we can see more interesting iterations of the domestication of electronic music production that was an often overlooked ideal in the developmental context of the early Buchla systems: electronic music in the home. This domestication of sound synthesis has located not only modular instruments and approaches but accompanying concepts of systems and a diverse aesthetics of ambience in the home. This proliferation and domestication associated with the modular scene exemplifies Attali’s epoch of Composition, wherein the creation of music is radically localised and entwined with the creation of instruments, yet with the historical advantage of seeing its co-option into ‘prosumerism’. Exploring the ambient aesthetics and workflows of contemporary modular approaches to electronic music this paper considers how the continuing domestication of modular synthesis entails a conceptual synthesis reappraising aspects of systems theory and industry narratives around ‘democratisation’.\n\nRecent years have seen a proliferation of Instagram profiles that showcase short videos of carefully arranged modular electronic musical devices. Each of these videos features a fragment of music being produced in real time by combinations of pocket synthesizers, guitar pedals, vintage cassette players, and modern digital devices. The resulting installations focus as much on the quality of the music produced as on the visual placement of the devices, their physical characteristics, and the sonic consequences of interacting with them. In American composer Emiliano Melis’s Instagram account, the configuration of his installations in connection to his general artistic production offers the possibility to explore modern conceptualizations of nostalgia in the intersection of aurality, visuality, and tactility.\n\nIn my paper, I explore the tactile nature of Emiliano Melis’s installations, their situatedness in the realm of social networks, and the relationship between physicality and nostalgia prompted by his work. Drawing from Judith Peraino’s research on cassette tapes, I conceptualize the physicality of cassette players in the context of Melis’s installations, and their interaction with other analog and digital devices. Building on Vivian Sobchack’s theorizations of synesthesia and tactility in film, I explore the tactile interaction of sound and image in Melis’s videos. I argue that Melis’s installations are a site of convergence of different conceptions of tactility and nostalgia in deep contrast with their contextualization within an ever-increasing digital medium.\n\nWith its stylized imagery of Los Angeles by night and its nihilistic story elements, Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive (2011) has been called a neo-noir film by both critics and academics. However, its hybrid score that features pre-existing but contemporary electronic tracks such as Kavinsky’s ‘Nightcall’ (2010) differs significantly from the musical topic traditionally associated with film noir: the cool jazz idiom and its ‘lone saxophone in the night’ cliché (Miklitsch 2009; Butler 2013; Ivănescu 2015). Still, there is an important analogy between Drive and traditional neo-noir, with representatives like Chinatown (1974). Both function as an ‘audiovisual imaginary’, an ‘invented tradition’ (Hobsbawm & Ranger 1983) that connects musical topics to cinematic iconography: early synthesizer timbres to close-ups of gleaming muscle car hoods in the case of Drive, jazz idioms and instruments to fedoras and trench coats in historical neo-noirs.\n\nThis paper characterizes the audiovisual imaginary of Drive by considering the role of the film’s pre-existing music in the history of synthwave. Synthwave, a mostly instrumental electronic music genre centered on 1980s nostalgia (Diak 2018), relies heavily on iconography and musical features that can be traced via Drive to a handful of specific cinematic and televisual moments from the 1980s. Through this historical connection, Drive’s soundtrack has played an important role in the proliferation of a musical aesthetic in contemporary audiovisual media beyond the noir genre, as exemplified by Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Stranger Things (2016). Much like 1970s neo-noir invented a jazz-inflected imaginary of the 1930s and 1940s, so did Drive’s ‘neon-noir’ invent a synthwave imaginary of the 1980s.\n\nSynthwave music is inextricably tied with cinema, and in this presentation I am going to investigate the archetypical forms of that connection, focusing on their functions and connotations. My main point is that we can find both first-order and second-order associations between cinema and synthwave music, for a total of at least four of them (association with sci-fi cinema, association with B-movies, age-synecdoche and aesthetic mediator). These associations are partly to be found in contemporary cinema and partly to seek in films from the 1980s, in a dialectical process in which cinema and music are constantly implied one in the other (even when it comes to synthwave music not used for cinematic purposes). After a brief overview of first-order associations – which are important for understanding the whole idea, but are not so directly linked with the contemporary synthwave music genre – I will mainly focus on a selection of contemporary films defined by online communities as ‘synthwave movies’, and thus on second-order associations, showing how these contribute in rendering synthwave a simulacrum representing not only cyberpunk worlds and cheap productions, but an entire era and its (retro-)futuristic dreams and aesthetic idiosyncrasies.\n\nThe music of the 2020s is filled with ‘retro’ sounds and styles; musical characteristics from the 1980s have crept their way into current mass-consumed songs. This neo-80s trend has perhaps been realised by Dua Lipa’s 2020 album, Future Nostalgia. Filled with anachronistic references, the album brings nostalgia, desire for familiarity, outdated futurism, and recycled sounds to the fore, and may be considered as a hauntological product. Hauntological art, as is widely posited by scholars, and as is seen within the Future Nostalgia album, features various paradoxes. New and old, retro and futurist, nostalgic and fresh, familiar and strange, past and present; all of these binaries meld together to foreground a new sound and style. The proposed paper will consider hauntological theory, late-stage capitalism and the failure of futurism in relation to Dua Lipa’s album, in an effort to understand what the 21st-century hauntological product looks like, particularly to younger generations.\n\nMark Fisher’s concept of “hauntology” has often been accused of being an ill-founded exercise in nostalgia for a passé modernist futurism. But what is missed in such replies is that for Fisher, what is crucial in the “retro-future” is not the historical actuality of that bygone era, but its virtual, still unfulfilled utopian promises. “Looking back” isn’t a matter of orienting oneself to the empirical past, but to futures that have been lost, what Fisher calls “lost futures”. This concept has strong affinities with Theodor W. Adorno’s notion of the new in art. For him, the “utopian new” always exists in a subtle, dialectical, liminal space between the old and the new. It can only be captured in the form of an “experiment”, an artistic venture with possibility for failure that is not merely a mining of already-proven pastichés from the past (Jameson).\n\nI am going to relate these broader philosophical issues with the practical musical object of “lost futures” in electronic dance music, which is a problematic that Fisher has specifically commented upon in multiple locations. What is the status of the new in music who’s “future” has now itself become historical?\n\nThis project explores the digital revival of 1990s Memphis trap music, which has become its own subgenre of hip-hop known as “phonk” (pronounced like funk). Phonk can be characterized by the use of samples from Memphis trap that are then slowed down, chopped, and screwed to create a relaxed listening experience. The phonk scene initially proliferated on SoundCloud, but has since become popular on platforms such as Spotify and TikTok, where it has come to be associated with other “Internet genres” like vaporwave and lo-fi hip-hop. While the term phonk and the Memphis trap revival were initially associated with Black artists like Lil Uzi Vert and SpaceGhostPurrp, many of the most well-known producers who have emerged on the scene in recent years are white. Examinations of the linguistic and aesthetic elements used by producers thereby reveal certain problematic patterns around appropriation and commodification of Black culture within the phonk scene, such as the use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) by white producers. Ultimately, this project sheds light on the more subtle, but nevertheless insidious instances of appropriation that can occur in online music scenes through the example of phonk, and the complexities of musical revival in the digital age.\n\nWhile brainstorming for an orchestral program, Alan Pierson, the director of Alarm Will Sound, noticed that Strauss’s Four Last Songs and Messiaen’s Turangalîla Symphony were both composed in 1949. Pierson thought it remarkable that two very different composers were both writing “seminal works” in Europe after World War II, and he wondered when else such “confluences” might have occurred. Some Wikipedia research yielded the year 1969. Pierson later came across an anecdote of a meeting that had been set up to plan a joint concert between Stockhausen and the Beatles. This meeting was the spark for 1969, a performance created and developed by Andrew Kupfer, Nigel Maister, and Alan Pierson for Alarm Will Sound, which premiered in 2011.\n\n1969 strings together selections by such artists as the Beatles, Stockhausen, Berio, and Bernstein; the work is a kind of musical history-writing. My paper is a meditation on the ethics and aesthetics of what I am calling the historiographic minimalism of 1969: the impulse to concentrate history – nostalgically, aspirationally, efficiently – into a single year. That impulse finds its counterforce in the genre-crossing stylistic maximalism of the performance. This meeting of minimalism and maximalism is a metahistorical clash of its own, I argue – one that speaks to the urge toward comparing twenty-first-century resistance with the progressive energies of the 1960s.\n\n‘Everything begins with the music. My private joke about Luke Cage is that it’s basically a bulletproof version of Lemonade. It’s one big concept album’, says music journalist turned show runner Cheo Hodari Coker of his series Luke Cage (2016-18). Coker uses the rich history of black music to map the black ‘ecosystem’, as he calls it, giving depth and breadth to the visual depiction of Harlem and complementing the complex conversations and street slang.\n\nNow, a Spotify playlist from Luke Cage, full of loving homages to the blues, funk and soul of the late 1960s and early 70s, as well as actual tracks from the period, could certainly be made to fit in with the comfortable wood panelling and distressed-leather-sofa aesthetic that we so commonly find in coffee shops and book stores these days—an aesthetic Ian Buchanan describes as ‘home value’. However, in the context of the BLM themes explored in the show, I argue that the live performances incorporated into the narrative, original hip-hop-inspired score, and compiled score come together at the higher level of Coker’s ‘concept album’ to generate something like the critical musical hauntology identified by Mark Fisher. In particular, Luke Cage draws attention to and utilizes in its story-telling the fact that music of the Black Atlantic has always been out of time—both retro and futurist as well as neither retro nor futurist. I conclude by exploring how the out-of-joint time (not to mention space) of Luke Cage might allow for a more persuasive political vision (really audition) than Fisher’s listening in musical hauntology ‘for relics of the future in the unactivated potentials of the past’.\n\nThrough decades of (sub)cultural appropriation, chiptune has come a long way from vitalising the pixelated geometries of in-game worlds. Yet the hypermediacies of its micro-audio technologies remain as the consistent distinctiveness of its ludomusicality (cf. Bolter and Grusin 2000, pp. 31-44; Hodkinson 2002, pp. 30-31). Chip-musicians unabashedly foreground early digital aesthetics, timbral qualities are unmistakably gritty and anachronistic, and obsolescence is both celebrated and remediated beyond commercial abandonment. As a result, questions about the role of nostalgia in chiptune’s longevity are common, dramatically dividing opinion: either relegated to gamers of a certain age and demoscene veterans or dismissed as bearing no influence on chiptune’s progression (see McAlpine 2018).\n\nTypically overlooked in this discourse are younger participants who didn’t live through the late 20th century, yet they cite nostalgia as integral to their chip-musicking. Far from nostalgia’s typically ascribed bittersweet pessimism, some have paradoxically highlighted the liminality and uncanniness of nostalgia itself as a means of identification and belonging – playing in and with the hazy interstices of cultural memory, time, and place. Why is this phenomenon occurring for these demographics? In which ways do such experiences of nostalgia become an affirmative form of identification, and how does chip-musicking engender these responses? Through empirical accounts, autoethnographic reflections, and interdisciplinary critical theory, my paper will zoom in on this audience demographic and explore these questions. Homing in on the links between remediation, nostalgia, and identification in chiptune culture, I will not only illuminate how chip-musical aesthetics mediate listening subjectivity – which remains underexplored in its academic works – but also point to similar phenomena occurring in other heavily remediated musical aesthetics such as those of lo-fi, synthwave, and vaporwave.\n\nDuring a server migration in 2019, Myspace lost all content uploaded by users before 2016. Myspace was the ecosystem within which much of the early development of synthwave took place. Many of the artists who were instrumental in defining the sound of the genre posted material here, and used the platform to communicate, often for the first time, with other creators. While some of synthwave’s early history has been later recounted in interviews, most primary material was lost with Myspace’s data wipe.\n\nThis paper will reflect on how researchers can engage in an interdisciplinary analysis of genre formation in the internet age, in turn highlighting the importance of digital preservation to musicological research. I will do so through focusing here on synthwave and its limited archives. Combining internet archaeology and social network analysis, my research explores the genesis of the synthwave community, mapping key connections between artists and collectives. Illuminating such a network will highlight the ways in which early participants constructed musical identities on the concept of nostalgia–central to subsequent definitions of the genre. The hope is that doing so will also provide a model for similar explorations in the future.”"
