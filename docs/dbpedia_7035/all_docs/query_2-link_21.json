        "text": "History of VaporWave\n\nVaporWave emerged in the 2010s, mostly on the Internet. It is often seen as an evolution of New Age music and ambient music, with the use of synthesizers and drum machines.\n\nIt is often considered as a music making a pastiche of the 80s by denouncing in particular the consumerist logic of the years. The name of VaporWare comes from VaporWare,\n\nVaporWave is a genre of electronic music and an artistic movement that emerged in the 2010s. It is often considered as a music making a pastiche of the 80s by denouncing in particular the consumerist logic of the time. The name VaporWave comes from VaporWare, which was a term used in the 1980s to describe computer products that were advertised but never actually released.\n\nEarly VaporWave artists were influenced by elevator music, mall music, and lounge music. They were also influenced by the aesthetic of the 80s and 90s, with the use of pastel colors and geometric patterns.\n\nVaporWave gained popularity on the internet through online forums, blogs, and music sharing platforms like Bandcamp and SoundCloud. Much of VaporWave is based on samples of existing music, often songs from the 80s and 90s.\n\nVaporWave artists take these samples and modify them using effects such as reverb, delay and pitch-shifting. In this way, they create pieces of music that are both familiar and strange.\n\nHere are some examples of VaporWave artists:\n\nMacintosh Plus\n\nSaint Pepsi\n\nBlank Banshee\n\nYung Bae\n\n2814\n\nThese artists have all contributed to the popularity of the VaporWave and have created fascinating tracks that have become classics of the genre such as the album Floral Shoppe by Macintosh Plus.\n\nTechniques for making VaporWave\n\nThere are several techniques for making VaporWave.\n\nHere are some of the most common ones:\n\nUse samples of 80’s songs\n\nSampling is at the heart of creating VaporWave tracks. Artists in this genre use samples of existing songs and modify them to create a unique aural experience. For example, Macintosh Plus (previously mentioned) sampled Diana Ross ‘“It’s Your Move:\n\nIf you want to know which artists have been sampled by other artists, you can use WhoSampled.\n\nIt’s important to note that using samples of copyrighted songs can lead to legal risks for VaporWave artists. VaporWave is often created from samples of existing music, which can cause copyright issues. Artists should be aware of their country’s copyright laws and obtain the necessary permissions to use samples of existing music. Otherwise, they may face legal action and large fines. Some VaporWave artists have already run into legal problems for using samples of existing music without permission.\n\nWhen using samples in your work, it is important to modify them enough so that they are no longer identifiable. This will allow you to create a unique work that reflects your creative style while respecting the copyrights of other artists. You can use techniques such as manipulating tempo, changing the order of notes, altering sound effects and adding new layers of sound to give your music a personal touch.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different techniques to find the ones that work best for your style of music.\n\nUse effects to add a retro feel\n\nEffects are an essential part of VaporWave that help create the nostalgic vibe characteristic of the genre. Artists use various effects such as reverb, delay and pitch-shifting to transform existing music samples into unique sound textures. Reverb adds depth and makes the music sound like it is being played in a large space.\n\nDelay creates an echo effect and makes the music sound like it is being repeated. Pitch-shifting changes the pitch of the music, creating strange sounds and distorted melodies. Effects can be added to music using DAW plugins or hardware effects such as effects pedals. Artists can also use mixing techniques to create a specific mood using effects such as compression, equalization and distortion.\n\nSlow down a song and sample it\n\nAmazingSlowDowner is a music slowdown software created by Ronimusic.com available for Mac and Windows. It allows artists and producers to slow down music tracks without affecting the sound quality.\n\nUnlike other music slowing software, AmazingSlowDowner eliminates the compression artifacts that can occur when music is slowed down, allowing the user to hear every note and nuance of the music. It is also possible to change the song speed and pitch independently of each other. It has different algorithms for slowing down the song, each with a different sound.\n\nIt is an ideal tool for artists who are looking to study and analyze music tracks in detail, or for producers who are looking to slow down samples to integrate them into their productions.\n\nHere is an overview of the interface and features offered by the software:\n\nUse retro synths and drum machines\n\nSynthesizers and drum machines are two key instruments in the creation of VaporWave. Synthesizers are used to create a wide variety of sounds, from keyboard sounds to pads to sound effects. Drum machines, on the other hand, are used to create repetitive drum patterns, which are often associated with VaporWave.\n\nVaporWave artists tend to use vintage drum machines, such as Roland’s TR-808 and TR-909, to create retro-futuristic sounds reminiscent of the 80s and 90s. Synthesizers and drum machines can be used alone or in combination to create a wide variety of sounds and moods.\n\nUse a retro aesthetic to illustrate your songs\n\nTo make your single or album cover stand out, you can use a retro aesthetic. This aesthetic can help you create a vintage and nostalgic vibe for your music.\n\nYou can use past colors, retro typography, and images or illustrations that evoke a bygone era, typically the 80s and 90s. Use graphic elements from the technological advances of the 80’s and 90’s and retro (or even cheesy) objects such as Windows 95 icons, pastel colors, Greek statues, checkerboards, sunsets, plastic plants, low quality 3D objects, etc."
