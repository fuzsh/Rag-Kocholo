        "text": "Advertisements\n\nI just discovered vaporwave, and I'm hooked.\n\n\"Vaporwave is a musical micro-genre that emerged in the early 2010s among Internet communities. It is characterized by a nostalgic fascination with retro cultural aesthetics (typically of the 1980s, 1990s, and early-mid 2000s), video games, technology, post-modern Japanese culture, and advertising, and styles of commercial and popular music such as lounge, smooth jazz and elevator music.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave\n\nHere is an example. Saint Pepsi's \"Private Caller\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki-fATpXa00\n\nI LOVE it, except for the obnoxious \"Soul\" and \"Funk\" minority male vocals. I hate \"Soul\" and \"Funk\", and there's no way to make those less vile.\n\nBut as long as the music is generic, and not a Vaporware rendition of a Muzak rendition of some obnoxious Top 40 song, then I think it's WONDERFUL.\n\nDAN BELL is doing some surreal things with Vaporwave, in his tours of DEAD MALLS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-c...&nohtml5=False You think the music is being recorded there, as he walks through the malls. But actually, it's Vaporwave, which he has added later.\n\nJust as a passive observer, I see vaporware discussions here and there 'round the Internet. Personally, I'm not much for nostalgia when it comes to new artists making \"new\" music. To be sure, a television show set in a different time period with a nostalgic focus doesn't bother me at all.\n\nOf the two videos posted, the images/advertising have no overall message, nor do they mesh with the music. If they are supposed to mesh, I'm either missing the message, or it simply doesn't work. Vaporware seems like a genre invented by people who were bored and wanted to create a new genre out of thin air, as a side project by amateur music-lovers incorporating some of their favorite old clips and such. Which is perfectly fine, although to me, the music still sounds like '80s music. But '80s music is already '80s music, so it doesn't need any help.\n\nLike what you like. Not trying to diss the genre outright, and if people are having fun making this type of thing, then cool beans. Just my opinion.\n\na lot of it i really don't like. However, there are certain things that have come from it that are great.\n\nOne example is George Clanton. His more vaporwave based stuff was just 'ok' to me. But his album last year that veered away from that slightly is absolutely fantastic. It was one of my favorite records last year."
