        "text": "By Spencer Ostrowsky, Contributing Writer\n\nYou’ve seen the memes and A E S T H E T I C S. Bright pinks and neon colors, grids, busts of Alexander the Great. Vaporwave is self-aware and ironic while triggering feelings of nostalgia for the 1980s and 90s, while having a commentary on capitalism.\n\nA lot, right? Vaporwave is meant to be experienced. It is hard to put into words how the combination of music, album art work, and overall aesthetic effect you. It’s unique, but strangely familiar.\n\nVaporwave relies heavily on Plunderphonics, music that takes pre-existing music and alters it. You may recognize some songs you know in these albums, but slowed down almost beyond recognition, pitch shifted, and drenched in reverb.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is a starter pack of albums to check out if you are looking to get into Vaporwave.\n\n1. Macintosh Plus – Floral Shoppe\n\nI almost didn’t include this on the list because of how well known it is. You will recognize the first track from the ever popular “I thought you were American” video on Vine. This album has become the basis of the Vaporwave meme, but for good reason. This album exemplifies all of the aesthetics of vaporwave in an interesting, but not intrusive way. Macintosh Plus, more widely known as Vektroid, is one of the forerunners of the Vaporwave scene even today.\n\n2. Daniel Lopatin – Chuck Person’s EccoJams Vol. 1\n\nHere it is. This is the album that started Vaporwave. Although the artwork aesthetic does not have the signature pink and neon that would later become the norm, this album evokes sounds and feelings of both the years 1992 and 2092. There are no “tracks” on this record. More like about 15 movements that are meant to flow into each other. Start here and see how the genre matured.\n\n3. Blank Banshee – 0\n\nAlthough Vaporwave is a micro-genre, there have been countless spinoffs. When you listen to this debut album from Blank Banshee, you will realize that is ever so slightly different than what you expect from the genre. There is a clear trap beat, but you do not feel like dancing to it. There is a groove, but you have a hard time singing it back in your head. Many call this the pioneer album in Vaportrap and Hypnogogic Pop. Either way, this album is compelling and very approachable. Listen to the track “Deep Space” with headphones in. Trust me.\n\n4. Luxury Elite/Saint Pepsi – Late Night Delight\n\nI wanted to stick to a one artist per list rule, so Saint Pepsi’s Hit Vibes didn’t quite make the cut (but you should still check it out, it’s really good.) Late Night Delight is a collaboration between two giants in the genre. The album takes samples and aesthetics from old fast food commercials, play list the next time you go on a late night fast food run and you’ll get it.\n\n5. 식료품groceries – 슈퍼마켓Yes! We’re Open\n\nHave you ever wondered what it is like to be locked in a grocery store all alone? Well, here’s your soundtrack. At times cold, plastic, and fake, and in others uplifting, bright, and funky. This album zig-zags you through the aisles with a fun bonus track thrown in.\n\nHonorable Mention: death’s dynamic shroud.wmv – I’ll Try Living Like This\n\nIf you have listened to any vaporwave in the past, you will know that the genre typically has a hint of creepiness or uneasiness. This album\n\nbrings that and much more to the forefront. This album exemplifies the loneliness and frustration that comes with a robot trying to process\n\nemotion and feeling, but not quite being able to and experiencing breakdowns. This is an honorable mention because at times, this\n\nalbum is difficult to listen to. It is wonderfully produced, the production and sampling are creative. But at times, this album is so sad and bittersweet at times, that it can be hard to listen to all of the way through on the first try. Maybe don’t start here, but definitely pass through here at some point.\n\nThere is a LOT of vaporwave out there. The genre is constantly growing and progressing with new movements being started almost weekly. It’s easy to get lost in the micro-genres and plethora of releases. Here is a breakdown of some of the more popular spin-off genres sorted roughly from most to least “friendly:”\n\nUtopian Virtual – Squeaky clean production, optimism and idealism of pre-recession capitalism.\n\nMallsoft – Similar to Utopian Virtual, this is music that you would hear in a mall in your dreams.\n\nFuture Funk – Similar to the above two, but with nostalgia for the past, not the future.\n\nVapornoise – Choppier samples intertwined with static and noise.\n\nHardvapor – Anti-Vaporwave. Hard, techno-type beats that are concussive.\n\nSignalwave/Broken Transmission – Vaporwave at its most uncompromising. Confusing, Disorienting, Hypnotic, Cathartic.\n\nThis list was meant to give a smattering of different flavors of what Vaporwave can be, as well as explain where and how the genre came from. Use this list as a jumping off point to explore and find new aesthetics that suit your taste.\n\nBandcamp, last.fm, and YouTube will be your best friends, as many releases are not on Spotify or Apple Music. Have fun, and remember… Vaporwave is dead, long live Vaporwave."
