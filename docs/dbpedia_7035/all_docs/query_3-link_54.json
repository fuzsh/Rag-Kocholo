It can be viewed as a type of music, visual art, fashion style, subculture and for some a way of life. Lets start with music.\n\nVAPORWAVE MUSIC\n\nVaporwave music is essentially a background music. Something that you would play at home while working on your computer or just chilling. It is a mixture of sounds from three decades ago with the modern music created by programs. It often has little jingles from old TV commercials and added 80's and 90's soft pop or jazz music done in a slow motion to make it sound almost surreal or imaginary. Same when it comes to music video clips - they usually show that nostalgic, romantic picture of the past mixed with surreal and futuristic themes.\n\nVAPORWAVE ART\n\nVaporwave is also a visual art movement. Often described as art born from the internet, it has surreal 80's/90's style, often mixed with geek, ancient statues. The color palette usually has a lighter base of pastel colors, with pink, purple and teal often paired together. It also often relies on 2D and 3D computer generated graphics with purposely distorted pictures that creates that television static impression. For Varporwave artists, whatâ€™s old is new again with a touch of nostalgic feel.\n\nVAPORWAVE FASHION STYLE\n\nFrom music to art and fashion, everything that surrounds us is in some way entangled with the internet. Vaporfashion and its incorporation of the past, present and future is especially important for us. We love its obsession with retro video games, grainy TV footage's, retro tapes and the use of pastel colors.
