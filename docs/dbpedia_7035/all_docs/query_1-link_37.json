        "text": "“I will have spent my life trying to understand the function of remembering, which is not the opposite of forgetting, but rather its lining. We do not remember. We rewrite memory much as history is rewritten.”\n\nSans Soleil (1983, Chris Marker)\n\nVaporwave is a sub-genre of music and internet art trend that emerged in the 2010’s. Laura Glitsos expands on this description in the article, “Vaporwave, or Music Optimised for Abandoned Malls” defining vaporwave, “As a genre, vaporwave is a style of music collaged together from a wide variety of largely background musics such as muzak®, 1980s elevator music and new age ambience. The vaporwave song structure is usually short and repetitive, often slow (sitting around 60–90 bpm) with vocal samples positioned low in the mix saturated with heavy reverb and often slowed down to produce a ‘stretched out’ effect or a ‘melting’ quality.” (100)\n\nVaporwave blurs the reality of memory through incorporation of internet historicity, ironic repurposing of capitalistic imagery/space and assemblage of visuals and sounds to achieve a floating nostalgic feeling of an artificially constructed time and space.\n\nTo simulate and expand on this experience I have collected stills, GIFS, and tracks from a variety of time periods. Through the archiving of these tactile elements, I have coalesced an audio-visual project that strives to embody the affect of this internet genre. The images and music paired together crafts a subjective experience that could spark different “memories” or feelings for different individuals. In an attempt to capture the affecting essence of vaporwave, I’ve steered away from some of the kitschier imagery and tried to focus more on audio-visual elements that are ethereal and atmospheric."
