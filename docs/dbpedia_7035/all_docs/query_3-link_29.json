        "text": "In this article, we introduce you vaporwave and show you how to make retrowave, or chillwave music with the software instrument Vapor Keys. Including some great tracks for inspiration.\n\nThe born of digital retro\n\nThe retrowave style is making a comeback with the recent surge in the 80s and 90’s music. By the emergence of atmospheric 80s synth in film and videogame scoring, vaporwave has made its way onto movie soundtracks such as Drive or games like Mirror’s Edge with fresh new momentum adding retro flavor to modern genres. But what is this phenomenon? Why are people suddenly so interested in it? Vaporwave is morphing into a new form of popular music that we will hear for years to come.\n\nOk, so what is vaporwave anyway? Vaporwave is an electronic music subgenre that combines 1980s-inspired synth sounds with modern techniques to create a surreal listening experience. The genre has roots in late 1990s internet culture and early web 2.0 experimentation. Artists began appropriating corporate logos or retro pixels from old computer games as album art on their blogs or MySpace pages. Musically it has been noted for its disco-esque, relaxed, or “chill-wave” rhythmic structure: the sounds have been likened to 1980s synthpop, smooth jazz, R&B, lounge music, and video game sounds. Also, vapor artists often sample from these genres and use other 1990s cultural influences such as Japanese culture or cyberpunk themes.\n\nEarly adopters\n\nThe term “vaporwave” was coined by James Ferraro and originally referred not just to music but an entire subculture involving synth-based nostalgia for 1980s popular culture. Some argue that the first vaporwave songs were originally posted to online platforms such as Tumblr and Reddit back in 2010. One of these original tracks, “Chuck Person’s Eccojams Vol 1” by Electronic artist Oneohtrix Point Never (OPN), is widely considered to be the very first-ever vaporwave album.\n\nHow to sound “vapor”?\n\nVaporwave is typically created by sampling and manipulating synthpop, synthwave, or other synth-heavy music from the 80s to 90s. These songs are typically characterized by their ethereal melodies, retro-futuristic sounds, heavy use of sampling (often obscure), loops with long delays or reverb effects, heavily processed vocals (typically male) often making it difficult to understand what lyrics are being said. It primarily operates with ambient textures reminiscent of the droning synthesizers used in horror films such as John Carpenter’s “Halloween,” instrumentation consisting of synth pads, often in the form of mallets, bells, pianos, or guitar simulations.\n\nVaporwave’s soft and atmospheric tones make it a perfect soundtrack for film scores that want to portray nostalgia. It is also less harsh than other styles, like synthwave, making it the great music choice to create an understated mood in modern films or video games.\n\n6 tips for vaporwave music production\n\nThere are many ways to manipulate your sound and add some retro mood for your following music composition. Whether you want authentic sounds or something more modern, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a retro-futusistic sound palette, like japanese mallet or plucked sounds played on an early samplers or FM synths. Use classic gears like Yamaha DX7, Fairlight CMI, Korg M1 or Prophet 5 – or\n\nResample (8-bit or 16-bit) analog synth and drum sounds from classic synths like Casio CZ-101, Korg Polysix, Roland Juno 106, or literally any analog synth from the 80s or 90s\n\nPlay back your samples and themes on extremely slow speed (like drums, pop vocals, synths, or sampled track parts\n\nComspose soft-sounding pads and synth themes\n\nCreate a nostalgic, ambient atmosphere with a large reverbs and delays\n\nResample your themes or use tape simulation plugins – like VHS or audio cassette emulation plugins\n\nHeavy comrpess your sounds with a lot of artificial recording noise\n\nAdd instability to your pitch (like wow or fluffer)\n\nCreate your own tunes!\n\nGot inspired?
