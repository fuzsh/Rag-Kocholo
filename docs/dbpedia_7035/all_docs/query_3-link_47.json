        "text": "I can’t think of a musical genre more reflective of 2016 than this thing going by the name of vaporwave. That is not to say that the genre defies all conventions or is wildly avant-guardist though. It draws heavily from 80’s rhythms and 90’s aesthetic. What vaporwave is beyond all is a postmodern form of music which blends decades together with no consideration for where these bits and pieces from the past came from and what they meant at the time of their inception. Rap of course does that too, especially in Kanye’s seemingly out-of-place Nina Simone samples, but not to the same extent. From what I’ve seen of it, vaporwave’s golden rule seems to be style over substance. Or perhaps finding substance in style. The visual presentations of songs which fit the designation are just as important as the music itself. It’s a multimedia-based musical genre. That is not to say that every other genre that came prior hasn’t taken a life of its own stretching way beyond the sonics and into philosophy, lifestyle and clothing but with vapor wave the music and the aesthetic seem to be, from the start, indistinguishable from one another. There is also an embedded irony in the music and the culture it has spawn which is reminiscent of the now hard to define “hipster movement”.\n\nIn a way what vaporwave is doing, at least aesthetically, is to trace the evolution of technology for its audience. The vaporwave artists are essentially techno-archaeologists who dig up something like VHS and clash it with present day tech or themes. It seems as if vaporwave, when done right, is a sort of admittance that people grow complacent in regards to their technology and it is ironically by going backwards a step or two that novelty can be brought back into the picture.\n\nGlitch Art is also a big part of the vaporwave culture but it is put side by side jazzy tempos or classic riffs; both things which were probably once seen as “musical glitches” by an older generation.\n\nAn embodiment of the spirit of the internet. That’s what vaporwave is. It is what happens when the memes come to life.\n\nThere’s also a certain creepiness to the whole thing which is made obvious in the music videos of an artist like Saint Pepsi for his song Enjoy Yourself (https://youtu.be/_hI0qMtdfng). This darker side to vaporwave, or to what it is a response to, is obvious even in the stage names of some of the acts, Saint Pepsi especially. His music often feels like your average corny commercial run a muck and backed by drums and synths. The themes of capitalism, through the use of seemingly out-of-context corporate logos, can’t thrown at the viewer again and again throughout his video and a lot of others."
