In the vast landscape of contemporary music, the emergence of niche and micro-genres reflects the endless creativity and diversity of the digital age.

One such fascinating micro-genre is vaporwave, a unique and enigmatic style that has captivated listeners with its retro-futuristic aesthetics and cultural commentary.

This article explores the essence and influences of vaporwave and highlights the three indie artists who are making “vapor” waves.

Vaporwave Defined: Sound & Aesthetics

Vaporwave is a micro-genre of electronic music that emerged in the early 2010s, characterized by its use of nostalgic and retro elements from the 1980s and 1990s. It often incorporates samples from pop culture, smooth jazz, elevator music, and early internet aesthetics, transforming them into dreamy, surreal soundscapes.

The genre is heavily influenced by consumer culture, digital art, and the technological optimism of past decades, often presenting a satirical and critical perspective on modern capitalism and consumerism.

Vaporwave Origins

Vaporwave draws inspiration from a wide array of genres and cultural phenomena:

1980s and 1990s: Pop and Lounge

Vaporwave heavily samples music from these decades, including smooth jazz, Muzak, and early electronic music; it often repurposes these sounds to create new, surreal compositions.

Plunderphonics

This experimental genre involves the use of existing audio recordings to create new compositions; artists often use this technique, manipulating samples from old songs and media.

Chillwave and Synth-wave

These genres also explore retro aesthetics and sounds from the 1980s, focusing on synthesized music and a nostalgic atmosphere. Vaporwave shares this affinity for the past but with a more critical and deconstructed approach.

Early Digital Aesthetics

The visuals and themes of vaporwave are deeply rooted in early internet culture, including old websites, pixel art, and the utopian visions of technology from the 1990s.

Vaporwave Sound

Vaporwave’s distinct sound is marked by slowed-down tempos, reverb-heavy production, and a fondness for lo-fi, degraded audio quality that evokes a sense of faded memories and lost futures.

Vaporwave Aesthetics

The visuals associated with vaporwave are equally iconic, featuring retro computer graphics, neon colors, Greek statues, and other elements that evoke a sense of nostalgic futurism.
