Queen Amalie was the wife of King Johann of Saxony. She was born Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria in the Electorate of Bavaria, later the Kingdom of Bavaria, now in the German state of Bavaria, on November 13, 1801, the daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Princess Karoline of Baden.

Amalie had six siblings including her twin sister Elisabeth Ludovika

Prince Maximilian (1800-1803) – died in childhood

Princess Elisabeth Ludovika (1801-1873) – married King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, no issue

Princess Sophie Friederike (1805-1872) – married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, had issue including Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria

Princess Maria Anna (1805-1877) – married King Friedrich August II of Saxony, had issue

Princess Ludovika Wilhelmine (1808-1892) – married Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria, had issue

Princess Maximiliana (1810-1821) – died in childhood

From her father’s first marriage to Princess Auguste of Hesse-Darmstadt, Amalie had five half-siblings:

King Ludwig I of Bavaria (1786 – 1868), married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, had nine children including King Maximilian II of Bavaria and King Otto of Greece

Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788 – 1851), married Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, the son of Empress Joséphine of the French from her first marriage, had seven children including Joséphine who married King Oscar I of Sweden, Auguste who married Queen Maria II of Portugal, and Amélie who married Pedro I of Brazil

Princess Amalie (1790 – 1794), died in childhood

Princess Caroline Augusta (1792 – 1873), married (1) the future King Wilhelm I of Württemberg, no children (2) Emperor Franz I of Austria, no children

Prince Karl Theodor (1795 – 1875) married (1) Maria de Pétin, had three children (2) Henriette Schöller, no issue

On November 21, 1822, in Dresden, Amalie married Prince Johann of Saxony, the son of Prince Maximilian of Saxony and Princess Caroline of Parma. At the time, Johann was 4th in the line of succession for the Saxon throne, with little expectation that he would ever become King. From all accounts, the marriage was a happy one, and the couple had nine children:

Princess Marie Auguste (1827-1857) – unmarried

King Albert of Saxony (1828-1902) – married Princess Carola of Vasa, no issue

Princess Maria Elisabeth (1830-1912) – married (1) Prince Ferdinando of Savoy, Duke of Genoa, had issue; (2) Niccolò, Marchese Rapallo, no issue

Prince Friedrich August (1831-1847) – unmarried

King Georg of Saxony (1832-1904) – married Infanta Maria Ana of Portugal, had issue

Princess Maria Sidonia (1834-1862) – unmarried

Princess Anna (1836-1859) – married Ferdinando IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany, had issue

Princess Margaretha (1840-1858) – married Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria, no issue

Princess Sophie (1845-1867) – married Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria, had issue

Amalie’s husband became the heir presumptive to the Saxony throne in 1836, when King Anton died and was succeeded by Johann’s elder brother, King Friedrich August II. Amalie and her husband were close with the King and his wife (who was Amalie’s younger sister), and the two women worked together to support numerous charities and institutions. In 1851, Amalie became Chairwoman of the Women’s Association of Dresden, which had been founded by her sister some years earlier.

Upon King Friedrich August II’s death in August 1854, the throne passed to Johann, and Amalie succeeded her own sister as Queen of Saxony. Her husband would reign until his death on October 29, 1873, succeeded by the couple’s eldest son, King Albert.

Queen Amalie Auguste survived her husband by four years, dying in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, now in Saxony, Germany, on November 8, 1877. She is buried in the Wettin Crypt at the Dresden Cathedral, formerly known as the Katholische Hofkirche (Catholic Church of the Royal Court of Saxony).
