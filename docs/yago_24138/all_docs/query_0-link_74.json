        "text": "The marriage of Dauphin Louis, son of King Louis XV of France, and Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain, daughter of King Philip V of Spain, was celebrated by proxy at Madrid on December 18, 1744.\n\nHer older sister The Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain had previously been engaged to Louis XV of France but it was later broken off!\n\nThese marriages were part of sealing the contracts between two nations and had little to do with love. But when the countries modernized and became democracies with prime ministers negotiating terms between nations there was less of a need for sacrificing the kids as part of the package. It became more of mutual economic and military support and exchange of goods with not pressure to force a marriage.\n\nGiven the difference in Religion following the Reformation in the 16th Century the Pool of Princesses to be married off split into Catholic and Protestant and there were very few Catholic-Protestant unions.\n\nCharles I of and Henrietta Marie of France and Navarre\n\nCharles II and Catherine of Braganza\n\nJames II and Maria of Modena\n\nPhilippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans and Henrietta Anne of England (later converted to Catholicism)"
