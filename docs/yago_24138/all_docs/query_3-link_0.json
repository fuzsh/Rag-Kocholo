        "text": "Queen Amalie was the wife of King Johann of Saxony. She was born Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria in the Electorate of Bavaria, later the Kingdom of Bavaria, now in the German state of Bavaria, on November 13, 1801, the daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Princess Karoline of Baden.\n\nAmalie had six siblings including her twin sister Elisabeth Ludovika\n\nPrince Maximilian (1800-1803) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Ludovika (1801-1873) – married King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, no issue\n\nPrincess Sophie Friederike (1805-1872) – married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, had issue including Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria\n\nPrincess Maria Anna (1805-1877) – married King Friedrich August II of Saxony, had issue\n\nPrincess Ludovika Wilhelmine (1808-1892) – married Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Maximiliana (1810-1821) – died in childhood\n\nFrom her father’s first marriage to Princess Auguste of Hesse-Darmstadt, Amalie had five half-siblings:\n\nKing Ludwig I of Bavaria (1786 – 1868), married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, had nine children including King Maximilian II of Bavaria and King Otto of Greece\n\nPrincess Augusta of Bavaria (1788 – 1851), married Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, the son of Empress Joséphine of the French from her first marriage, had seven children including Joséphine who married King Oscar I of Sweden, Auguste who married Queen Maria II of Portugal, and Amélie who married Pedro I of Brazil\n\nPrincess Amalie (1790 – 1794), died in childhood\n\nPrincess Caroline Augusta (1792 – 1873), married (1) the future King Wilhelm I of Württemberg, no children (2) Emperor Franz I of Austria, no children\n\nPrince Karl Theodor (1795 – 1875) married (1) Maria de Pétin, had three children (2) Henriette Schöller, no issue\n\nOn November 21, 1822, in Dresden, Amalie married Prince Johann of Saxony, the son of Prince Maximilian of Saxony and Princess Caroline of Parma. At the time, Johann was 4th in the line of succession for the Saxon throne, with little expectation that he would ever become King. From all accounts, the marriage was a happy one, and the couple had nine children:\n\nPrincess Marie Auguste (1827-1857) – unmarried\n\nKing Albert of Saxony (1828-1902) – married Princess Carola of Vasa, no issue\n\nPrincess Maria Elisabeth (1830-1912) – married (1) Prince Ferdinando of Savoy, Duke of Genoa, had issue; (2) Niccolò, Marchese Rapallo, no issue\n\nPrince Friedrich August (1831-1847) – unmarried\n\nKing Georg of Saxony (1832-1904) – married Infanta Maria Ana of Portugal, had issue\n\nPrincess Maria Sidonia (1834-1862) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Anna (1836-1859) – married Ferdinando IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany, had issue\n\nPrincess Margaretha (1840-1858) – married Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria, no issue\n\nPrincess Sophie (1845-1867) – married Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria, had issue\n\nAmalie’s husband became the heir presumptive to the Saxony throne in 1836, when King Anton died and was succeeded by Johann’s elder brother, King Friedrich August II. Amalie and her husband were close with the King and his wife (who was Amalie’s younger sister), and the two women worked together to support numerous charities and institutions. In 1851, Amalie became Chairwoman of the Women’s Association of Dresden, which had been founded by her sister some years earlier.\n\nUpon King Friedrich August II’s death in August 1854, the throne passed to Johann, and Amalie succeeded her own sister as Queen of Saxony. Her husband would reign until his death on October 29, 1873, succeeded by the couple’s eldest son, King Albert.\n\nQueen Amalie Auguste survived her husband by four years, dying in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, now in Saxony, Germany, on November 8, 1877. She is buried in the Wettin Crypt at the Dresden Cathedral, formerly known as the Katholische Hofkirche (Catholic Church of the Royal Court of Saxony).\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
