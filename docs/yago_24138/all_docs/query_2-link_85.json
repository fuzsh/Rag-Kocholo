Johann; b. Dresden, 12 December 1801 &ndash; d. Pillnitz, 29 October 1873) was a King of Saxony and a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nHe was the third son of Maximilian, Prince of Saxony --younger son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony-- by his first wife, Caroline of Bourbon, Princess of Parma.\n\nEarly life\n\nDuring most of his life, Johann stood little chance of inheriting the Saxon Crown: he was preceded by his father and two older brothers, Frederick Augustus and Klemens. However, in 1822 Klemens died unmarried in Italy, and Johann was now only preceded in the line of succession by his older brother Frederick Augustus .\n\nWhen his uncle Anton succeeded his older brother as king (1827), Johann became the third in line to the throne, and after the father Maximilian renunciated his succession rights in 1830, Johan became in the second in line. Johann's older brother became King Frederick Augustus II in 1836; now he was the first in line of succession to the throne as Crown Prince (de: \"Kronprinz\"). The King, married twice, was childless. Johann remained as Heir presumptive during all the reign of his brother.\n\nKing of Saxony\n\nJohann became King of Saxony after the death of his brother Frederick Augustus II on 9 August 1854.\n\nThe Judiciary Organization of 1855, the extension of the railroad network, the introduction of the freedom of trade are mainly to be owed to his suggestion and promotion. Under his government, came the acceptance of the French Commercial Treaty (1862) and the acknowledgment of a contract with Italy. He exerted himself under influence of his minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust for the Great Germany Solution (de: \"Großdeutsche Lösung\") of the imperial arrangement (under inclusion of Austria). In 1866 Saxony fought on the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War. Finally, after the defeat of the Battle of Königgrätz, Saxony joined the North German Confederation and in 1871 the German Empire under the hegemony of the Kingdom of Prussia. The King died two years later, aged seventy-one.\n\nBeyond his political work, Johann was busy with literature. Under the pseudonym \"Philalethes\" he translated to German the Dante's Divine Comedy; some parts of this work were placed in the Schloss Weesenstein. The Dresden district of Johannstadt was named after him.\n\nAncestors\n\nMarriage and Issue\n\nIn Munich on 10 November 1822 (by proxy) and again in Dresden on 21 November 1822 (in person), Johann married with the Princess Amalia of Bavaria (Amalie Auguste), daughter of King Maximilian I of Bavaria. They had nine children:\n\n#Maria Auguste Fredericka Karoline Ludovike Amalie Maximiliane Franziska Nepomucena Xaveria (b. Dresden, 22 January 1827 - d.

Monza, 15 September 1858), known as \"Margarete\"; married on 4 November 1856 to Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria, her cousin.\n\n#Sophie Maria Friederike Auguste Leopoldine Alexandrine Ernestine Albertine Elisabeth (b.
