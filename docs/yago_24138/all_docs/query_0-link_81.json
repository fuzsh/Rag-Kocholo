        "text": "No serious political gain to be gained from marrying Louise-Marie. There is an unfortunate dearth of Russian grand duchesses of course and marrying a Greek for all the obvious advantages it would bring within Greece runs at the problem of every other royal in Europe getting horrified at not marrying a blueblood.\n\nI've spent more time looking for an appropriate wife for Leopold than I would like to admit. The OTL marriage between Leopold and Louise-Marie of Orleans was primarily due to his close proximity to France, and the very legitimate need for a French alliance. As he is King of Greece, that need no longer exists and while marrying the princess of from a Great Power like France would be nice it has some added problems as well, namely religion. As far as I know, Louise-Marie was a very devout woman and I can't see her converting from Roman Catholic to Greek Orthodox, nor would I see the Greek Government and people accepting a Catholic as their Queen so she is likely out as a first choice.\n\nThe best candidate would be a Russian Princess, but unless I missed someone, all of the Russian Grand Duchesses are either too young, too old, married, or dead.\n\nNicholas' daughters Maria Nikolaevna, Olga Nikolaevna, and Alexandra Nikolaevna are 11, 8, and 5 respectively in 1830.\n\nTsar Alexander had no surviving legitimate issue.\n\nGrand Duke Konstantin Pavolich had no legitimate issue.\n\nGrand Duke Michael's daughters are too young to be married anytime soon, the oldest Maria Mikhailovna is 5 in 1830.\n\nGoing back a generation, Tsar Paul's daughters are similarly not available as well as they are all married or dead as of 1830.\n\nI've spent more time looking for an appropriate wife for Leopold than I would like to admit.

I don't remember much about the family trees of the time besides the most notable facts) seems to be the only choice. Is Catholicism really such a big obstacle though, given that the chldren will inevitably be raised Orthodox? For that matter, will Leopold himself convert? He didn't OTL.\n\nSome German princess(or Scandinavian? I don't remember much about the family trees of the time besides the most notable facts) seems to be the only choice. Is Catholicism really such a big obstacle though, given that the chldren will inevitably be raised Orthodox? For that matter, will Leopold himself convert? He didn't OTL.\n\nGenerally the Greeks were pretty tolerant religiously so it really shouldn't be that big of an issue, but it would certainly help the stability and legitimacy of the monarchy if the King and Queen either were born Orthodox or converted to Orthodox before their coronation. I don't believe Leopold was ever asked to convert to Catholicism or under any pressure to convert as his marriage to Louise-Marie did much to dampen any religious fervor against him. Otto did have a lot of problems in Greece because of his strong Catholic faith, and it was one of the reasons behind his ousting in 1862 among other things. Leopold, strikes me as a man who would do whatever is needed to secure himself firmly upon his throne and if that means converting I believe he would convert. Now would he like to, probably not, but he was a realist and a pragmatist.\n\nAfter the Russian Grand Duchesses, the next best candidates would probably be German Princesses or British Princesses. But there again there really aren't many candidates available at first glance.\n\nAs of this moment though, I have not checked the Scandinavian countries or the minor German Principalities yet.\n\nBritain:\n\nGeorge III’s surviving daughters are all in their fifties and sixties by 1830 which rules them out for childbearing reasons.\n\nGeorge IV, Frederick, and William IV don’t have any legitimate daughters that have survived to 1830.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex does have a daughter, Augusta Emma d’Este, but given the hoopla over her parent’s marriage I’m not sure this is a viable option.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge had a daughter as well, also named Augusta, but she is only 8 as of 1830.\n\nPrussia:\n\nKing Frederick William III of Prussia’s daughters are all married.\n\nHis brother, Prince Louis’ daughter Frederica Wilhelma who was married to duke Leopold of Anhalt Dressau in 1818.\n\nTheir brother Prince Henry has no children.\n\nTheir sister Frederica Charlotte had no children.\n\nTheir second sister Wilhelmine had one daughter, Marianne, who survived to adulthood, and she does marry in September 1830 so it would have to be a quick arrangement to circumvent the OTL match for her.\n\nTheir last sister Augusta does have two daughters, but the youngest Marie was married in 1825 and I can’t find any information on the older daughter Karoline which implies to me that she had some unfortunate disability or she died young.\n\nTheir final sibling Prince Wilhelm, has two surviving daughters, Marie Elisabeth Karoline Viktoria and Marie Fredericka Franziska Hedwig, but they are both relatively young, being 14 and 5 respectively.\n\nAustria:\n\nFrancis II doesn’t have any available daughters as they are either married, dead, or mentally disabled.\n\nHis son and successor Ferdinand has no children.\n\nLeopold could marry Ferdinand’s sister and Francis’ daughter Marie Louise, the former wife of Napoleon for shits and giggles but she is probably too old for any viable children and I’m pretty confident she is politically unviable as well.\n\nMaria Leopoldina’s daughters are too young for marriage anytime soon as is her sister Clementia’s daughter Maria Carolina.\n\nMaria Caroline had no children and Archduke Franz Karl’s children aren’t born yet.\n\nBavaria:\n\nKing Ludwig's daughter Princess Mathilde Caroline is available as she didn't marry until 1833, so it could be a possibility but her OTL marriage was childless so that may not be the best.\n\nThe rest of Ludwig's daughters Adelgunde, Hildegard, and Alexandra are only 7, 5, and 4 respectively as of 1830.\n\nLudwig's sister Princess Caronline Augusta is married to Emperor Francis of Austria and she has no daughters.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Ludovika was married to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1823, but she was childless.\n\nPrincess Amalie Auguste was married in 1822 to King John of Saxony and as of 1830 they have two children.\n\nPrincess Sophie was married to Archduke Franz Karl of Austria in 1824.\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Bavaria is available in 1830. She is 25 years old and her OTL marriage isn't until 1833. So this match could happen. However she had no children in her OTL marriage.\n\nLudwig's last sister, Princess Ludovika was married to Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria in 1828.\n\nLudwig's older sister Augusta is technically available, but it may not be the best match considering she is the widow of Eugene de Beauharnais and she is 42 as of 1830.\n\nI believe they are all married as of 1830.\n\nGrand Duchess Elena Pavlovna's daughter, Marie Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was married in 1825 to Duke George of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Pavlovna's daughter, Princess Maria of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach married Prince Charles of Prussia in 1827 and her younger sister Augusta married Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (OTL Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany) in 1829.\n\nGrand Duchess Catherine Pavlovina's daughters, Maria Friederike Charlotte and Sophie Friederike Mathilde are unmarried, but they are only 14 and 12 respectively in 1830.\n\nThe last granddaughter of Tsar Paul is Princess Sophie of the Netherlands, but she is only 6 in 1830."
