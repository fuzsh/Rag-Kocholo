An autograph letter signed A by Queen Amalie of Saxony. Responding to a prior correspondence, Amalie discusses her recent poor health and a visit from her oldest son Albert and his wife Karola. The letter is written on both sides of an envelope and is accompanied by an English translation on a separate sheet: Dear Therese, Pardon me that I have no yet answered your first letter & that I only today reply to the last. I was very miserable & have trouble to recover my strength. I think you heartily for your sympathies in our joy to have Albert with us again. It will unfortunately not last long, as he leaves already Thursday & takes Karola with him which will be for me a great sacrifice. I hope you are well again! It is to be hoped I shall soon be able to see you. Entirely yours A. The translation is accompanied by a brief gloss: Translation of Queens letter. Albert is her son & Karola is his wife.
