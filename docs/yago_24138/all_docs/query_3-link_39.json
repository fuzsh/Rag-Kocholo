        "text": "On a veined marble socle. Worked in the round. The head inclined slightly to the right. The Princess wears an opulent hair style, pearl collier and an Empire waisted dress. With a label inscribed “A.A. Herzogin v. Sachsen” on the reverse with a red heraldic seal with an arms of alliance. A breakage to the side of the socle, a smaller one to the back of the hair comb. H 70.5 cm.\n\nGermany, ca. 1825 - 35.\n\nAmalie Auguste was born on 13th November 1801 as Princess of Bavaria, daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Karoline Friederike Wilhelmine of Baden. She was married to Johann of Saxony on 21st November 1822, and this portrait was almost certainly made in the first few years following this marriage.\n\nThe bust is highly reminiscent of a portrait of Princess Auguste of Liegnitz made in 1829 by Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann which is now kept in the National Gallery in Berlin. Both portraits plainly display the style of this era."
