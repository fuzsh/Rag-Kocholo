        "text": "Duchess of Urach\n\nDuchess Amalie Maria in Bavaria (Full German name: Amalie Maria, Herzogin in Bayern[citation needed]) (24 December 1865[citation needed] – 26 May 1912[citation needed]) was born in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, the only child of Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria and his first wife Princess Sophie of Saxony.[citation needed] Amalie was a member of the House of Wittelsbach and a Duchess in Bavaria by birth. She was a member of the House of Württemberg, Duchess of Urach and Countess of Württemberg through her marriage to Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach, the future King-elect of Lithuania.[citation needed] She was called by the French version of her name, Amélie, and was lifelong friends with her cousin, Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\n[edit]\n\nAmalie married Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach (later Mindaugas II of Lithuania), eldest son of Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach and his second wife Princess Florestine of Monaco, on 4 July 1892 in Tegernsee, Kingdom of Bavaria.[citation needed] Amalie and Wilhelm had nine children:[citation needed]\n\nPrincess Marie Gabriele of Urach (1893–1908)\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Urach (1894–1962) who married Prince Karl Aloys of Liechtenstein (1878–1955), an uncle of Franz Joseph II of Liechtenstein, and had issue.\n\nPrincess Karola of Urach (1896–1980)\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Urach (1897–1957), who morganatically married Elisabeth Theurer (1899–1988) and had two daughters, Elisabeth and Marie Christine, neither of whom married.\n\nKarl Gero, Duke of Urach (1899–1981), 3rd Duke, who married Countess Gabriele of Waldburg of Zeil and Trauchburg (1910–2005).

He divorced both of them and had children by both. His daughter Marie-Gabrielle (aka Mariga) was the first wife of Desmond Guinness, a diplomat and artist turned journalist and expert on the Far East.
