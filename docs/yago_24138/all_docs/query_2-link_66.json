        "text": "Hardcover. Etat : Near Fine. JOHN ABBOT (BRITISH, 1751-1840) Drawings in Natural History - Birds An album containing two hundred and twenty-one watercolors The first signed and dated J. Abbot ad vivum delin. Nov. 1815 in red ink in the lower margin, the majority titled in pencil in the lower margins, the sheets numbered from 1 to 221 (upper right), several inscribed (or with cropped inscriptions) on the upper edge on the reverses ( Its note in March, is like the creacking of a sign board in Windy weather [Lanius Excubitor Carolinensis, Grey Shrike]), Knowsley library location recorded on the front free endpaper ( Knowsley / . Library / East Division / North Bookcase B / Shelf 2 No 6 ) Pencil and watercolor on paper, large quarto, marbled endpapers, the 13th Earl of Derby s bookplate on the front pastedown, contemporary red morocco gilt, spine lettered Drawings in Natural History / Birds / by J. Abbot, gilt edges 1802-1815 Sheets 11 7/8 x 9 ¼ in.; the album 12 1/4 x 10 1/4 in. Provenance: John Abbot to Joshua Elder White, to Edward Smith Stanley, later the thirteenth Earl of Derby, in 1817. Georgia was John Abbot s Eden. He declared the pine woods of Georgia a beautiful Garden, consisting of a great variety of beautiful flowers, as if Flora, conscious of approaching winter, put on her most gorgeous suit, before she retires, till the return of Spring. [Abbot to Heinrich Escher, 15 November 1834.] This collection of 221 striking and distinctive bird watercolors is a pristine example of one of the foremost bird artists in American natural history and Georgia wildlife. Very few of Abbot s original works have been published or otherwise reproduced. Thus, they have never been popularized like illustrations by Mark Catesby (1683-1749) and John James Audubon (1785-1851). His original watercolors are exceedingly rare. During his career as an artist, John Abbot created five-thousand drawings, but only a rare one-thousand were related to birds; the remaining concentrated on insects and spiders. The present set of 221 watercolors is most closely related to the artist s set of drawings at the Houghton Library, Harvard University. Marcus Simpson Jr. s 1984 assessment of the present set and the Harvard set found that 106 of the Harvard watercolors species are also found in the present set from Knowsley. Comparatively, he also found that the Chetham Library set and the British Library set share many similarities. However similar these compilations may seem, Abbot did not keep a master set of bird drawings on which he drew for future commissions. Instead, he painted from fresh specimens. This is evident in the manuscript notes that accompany a number of his watercolors they include the specimen s size, which varies from one set to another. When one compares the same species painted in more than one collection, he is painting from different specimens. The artist generally ordered his sets similarly to Alexander Wilson s American Ornithology. The Knowsley set dates from 1802-1815. For thirty-nine of the compositions, Abbot used paper dated 1802, 1804, 1805, 1808, and 1810. Some have graphite notes on the verso, several of which the writing trimmed when they were originally bound. But why the lag between start to finish? Abbot s letter of 1814 to George Ord explains the hiatus: \"At the commencement of the War I had undertaken to make a collection of stuffed Birds & as a complete collection of Drawings of them in colors as I was able for a Genrleman in England but last fall in despair of seeing peace restored, I retired to the Country after having made about 220 Drawings throwed away a large collection of stuffed skins, have entirely laid it aside, & entered into another line of employment, where I am in hopes the mad and destructive Ambition of the rulers of the world can but little interfere.\" Loca: 6.3BC.19F.\n\nHardcover. Etat : Good. REV. CHRISTOPHER ATKINSON (1754-1795) Two albums of original watercolor drawings, titled on spines: English Birds. Cambridgeshire, Essex and Cheshire: c. 1784-1795 2 volumes, large 4°. With a near-contemporary 6p. manuscript list of the original contents of the albums. Dark, purple-toned paper throughout, loose mounted with 76 original pencil, watercolor and gouache drawings, some heightened with gum Arabic, most with identifying inscriptions in ink or pencil giving Latin binomial and common name, occasional notes regarding when and where the drawing was executed or where the specimen was obtained, two signed with initials CA, seven dated. Condition: About 26 drawings browned, 13 with staining to margins. Original half roan, the flat spines in seven compartments divided by a double fillet and roll tool, blue Morocco spine label lettered English Birds and green Morocco label lettered Vol II or Vol III, green cloth ties (joints split, upper covers detached). TWO ALBUMS OF VERY FINE ORIGINAL DRAWINGS Christopher Atkinson was the son of the vicar of Thorp-Arch, Yorkshire. He was based at Cambridge from 1773 to 1775, firstly at Trinity College as Pensioner and Fellow, and then as vicar of St. Edward s and Fellow of Trinity Hall. He married Catherine Leicester of Tabley, Cheshire, in 1785, and from that year until his early death remained vicar of Wethersfield, Essex, where he was buried. The majority of the drawings are on wove paper (three of these are watermarked J. Whatman , there is the occasional image on laid paper (one of these is watermarked C. Taylor .) The spine labels imply that there was at least one other volume of drawings, and a number of individual drawings did appear on the market in the 1980s. Despite this, the present albums include a wide range of subjects from most of the families of British Birds: the raptors (the Kestrel, White Owl , Moor Buzzard and Kite), water birds (the Little Grebe, Little Bittern, White fronted Goose), waders (the Red Godwit , Ruff, Long Shanks , Stone Curlew, Green Sandpiper, Avocet, Dunlin and Snipe), seabirds (Kittiwake, Shag, Guillemot, Puffin), warblers ( Mountain Linnet , Grasshopper Lark , Sky Lark, Woodlark), finches (Bullfinch, Goldfinch) and others. There are enough inscriptions to indicate that, in addition to any drawings made at his home, Atkinson also drew whilst in Bridlington on the Yorkshire coast, and at Tabley.\n\nHardcover. Etat : Very Good. VIEWS OF BEIJING DOCTOR GEORGES AUGUSTE MORACHE (1837-1906). THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF TWO KNOWN EXISTING SIGNED AND DEDICATED COPIES BY DR MORACHE. THE OTHER KNOW COPY IS CURRENTLY IN THE TOKYO BUNKO LIBRARY, TOKYO (previously George Morrison Collection). THESE ARE AMONG EARLIEST SURVIVING GROUPS OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEKING AND ITS INHABITANTS, PRECEDED ONLY BY FELICE BEATO S IMAGES TAKEN IN OCTOBER 1860 WHEN THE CITY WAS DESERTED FOLLOWING ITS OCCUPATION BY THE ANGLO/FRENCH FORCES. GEORGES MORACHE WAS IN PEKING IN OCTOBER 1860 AS A MEDECIN AIDE-MAJOR PART OF THE ANGLO-FRENCH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WHEN IT OCCUPIED THE CITY. HE RETURNED TO PEKING IN LATE 1862 AS THE MEDICAL DOCTOR ATTACHED TO THE FRENCH LEGATION WHERE HE REMAINED UNTIL EARLY IN 1866. Oblong folio (470 by 355 mm). Thirty albumen photographs (200 by 160mm.), pasted one to a page, mounted to cream border, titled in French manuscript in lower margin (photographer s handwriting)., The photographer s dedication to his sister in law on the front endpaper in French manuscript, signed by Morache himself A ma chere belle-soeur, madame Eugenie [Marie Laure Eugenie Cailliot 1836-].Paris, February 1867, Morache . Two red pasted scrolls in Chinese Calligraphy besides dedication. \"Neither commercial photography studios nor foreign merchants were able to operate in Beijing until the late 19th-century. Consequently, early surviving commercial images of the capital were the work of visiting professionals such as Felice Beato (1860), William Saunders (1866), John Thomson (1871) and Lai Fong (1879). Other than that, some surviving photographs came from amateur enthusiasts attached to the diplomatic corps at the foreign legations. Perhaps the best-known examples were the Englishmen Dr John Dudgeon (1864-1890s) and Thomas Child (1871-1879). To this exclusive list, we can now add the name of Dr Georges Morache. As medical officer attached to the French Legation between 1862 and 1866 Morache (1837-1906), a talented and enthusiastic photographer, would have had access to and detailed knowledge of scenes and locations little known to those just passing through the capital. In the same way that visiting professional David Griffith sought the help of Thomas Child when he travelled to Beijing in 1872, we now know that Paul Champion had earlier sought the assistance of his fellow Frenchman, Morache, in 1865. They travelled and worked together, photographing variants of the same scenes. Photography in 1860s Beijing is exceedingly rare. The recently attributed work of Georges Morache is of great importance to the history of Photography in the Chinese capital\" (Terry Bennett, 2016).

In very good condition. An exceptional rarity.\n\nOne of three copies for the family. One of three copies for the family. 35 black and white silver prints on 11 x 14 inch heavy paper. Oblong Folio. One of 3 Copies. Rare collection of photographs taken and, likely, developed and assembled all by Avedon himself, rather than by his studio, and characteristic of his private life, but not of his public oeuvre. The negatives are said to have been destroyed, to make this series irreproducible. The first photo, of the Avedon house in Bolinas, is titled and signed by Avedon. The last, a still life, is signed \"27. 28. 29. 77 / Dick / XXX / OOO\". The thirty-fifth photo, of Lucy Saroyan, whose set this was, is detached, and cropped at the bottom, with a crack on the image where something has fallen on it. Aram Saroyan started working with Avedon in the 1950s, starting out after school for $10 per week. They stayed in touch with each other's work and remained friendly over the years. In May 1977, Avedon came to visit Aram, Gailyn, Strawberry, Cream, and Armenak Saroyan at their house in Bolinas. Aram's sister Lucy, an actress and model of Avedon's, came with. Avedon left his box camera at home, but after a few days missed his vocation and borrowed a Leica from the poet Bill Berkson, the Saroyans' neighbor. A few weeks after his return to New York, a package arrived from the studio: \".a book of 35 photographs he'd taken during his visit. Spiral bound, the book was a series of images printed on heavy 11\" x 14\" photo paper, each sheet glued back-to-back to another sheet with another photograph. \"During the period I'd worked in the studio I'd heard whispers here and there in the photography world that without his support staff of assistants and master printers, Dick would be more or less helpless. As we beheld this marvel that rumor died an instant death. Different as it is, in its off-the-cuff fluency this work might even be reckoned a precursor to In the American West. \"There's a loving intimacy in these photographs which, while it isn't a recognized hallmark of the Avedon oeuvre, was nonetheless, as my relationship with him reflects, very much a part of his nature. It still troubles me that he would adamantly suppress this side of his practice in the work he made public.\" (Saroyan, My Own Avedon, which features five of the photos). Saroyan, Aram. My Own Avedon. A Memoir with Photographs.

With 13 full-page gouaches and ornamental frames on each leaf, all heightend in gold. Contemporary red velvet with gilt-stamped spines and moiré silk endpapers. All edges gilt. Stored in custom-made slipcase. Exceedingly prestigious and luxurious friendship album with the signatures of Alexander II and Alexander III of Russia, the German Emperor Wilhelm I, Queen Victoria, seven kings including Frederick William IV of Prussia, Ludwig I, Maximilian II, and Ludwig II of Bavaria, five empresses including Alexandra Feodorovna, Maria Alexandrovna, and Elizabeth of Austria, seven queens consort, and several ruling princes. - The album is beautifully illuminated by the eminent Russian architect and designer Ippolit Monighetti, who was also responsible for the sumptuous book decorations of the famous imperial coronation album of Alexander II and Maria Alexandrovna published in 1856. It is organized as a calendar, each volume comprising three months and each month being represented by a title gouache with biblical quotes and illustrations and one decorated page for each day. An additional title gouache in the first volume shows the calendar year 1855 and the arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, as Elisabeth of Prussia (1815-85) was by marriage a Princess of Hesse and by Rhine. The Hessian Lion reappears in the illustration for November, whereas the illustration for June includes a beautiful veduta of St Petersburg. Monighetti signed the title gouache as well as those for January and February; the latter is additionally dated to 1853, which indicates the time and effort invested in this exceptional work of art. - The 145 entries - mostly from members of the aristocracy, of which 131 could be identified - are unrelated to the calendar. They include, in volume I (January-March): Maria Alexandrovna, née Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine, Empress of Russia (1824-80), her son Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia (1850-1908), Duke Elimar of Oldenburg (1844-95), Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Princess of Orléans (1814-58), Princess Sophie of Bavaria, Archduchess of Austria (1805-72), Maria Anna of Bavaria, Queen of Saxony (1805-77), Alexandrine of Prussia, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1803-92) and her son, Grand Duke Frederick Francis II (1823-83), Caroline Augusta of Bavaria, Empress of Austria (1792-1873), Louise Frederica of Anhalt-Dessau, Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg (1798-1858), Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine (1823-88), Emperor Alexander III of Russia (1845-94), Luitpold, Prince regent of Bavaria (1821-1912), Caroline of Hesse-Homburg (1819-72), Adelgunde of Bavaria, Duchess of Modena (1823-1914), and German Emperor Wilhelm I (1797-1888). - Among the signatories of volume II (April-June) are Alexander of Battenberg, Prince of Bulgaria (1857-93), Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia (1847-1909), Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine (1843-78), Ferdinand, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg (1783-1866), Otto of Bavaria (1848-1916), later king but who never actively ruled because of his mental state, Emperor Alexander II of Russia (1818-81), Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (1850-1942), Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia (1857-1905), Archduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria (1842-1919), Princess Sophie of Sweden, Grand Duchess of Baden (1801-65), Queen Victoria (1819-1901), Anna of Hesse and by Rhine, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1843-65), Princess Helena of the United Kingdom (1846-1923), King Otto of Greece (1815-67), Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse (1806-77), and Prince Charles of Prussia (1801-83). - Volume III (July-September) comprises the signatures of Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria (1795-1875), Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine (1866-1953), Alexandra Feodorovna, née Princess Charlotte of Prussia, Empress of Russia (1798-1860), Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine (1823-88) and his daughter Princess Marie of Battenberg (1852-1923), Prince Adalbert of Bavaria (1828-75), Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, Duchess of Cambridge (1797-1889), Carola of Vasa, Queen of Saxony (1833-1907), Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1844-1900), King Ludwig I of Bavaria (1786-1868) and the later King Ludwig II of Bavaria (1845-86) on one leaf, Stéphanie de Beauharnais, Grand Duchess of Baden (1789-1860), Princess Ludovika of Bavaria (1808-92), the mother of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden (1826-1907), Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, Queen of Württemberg (1822-92), Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse (1837-92), and the German Empress Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1811-90). - The fourth and final volume (October-December) includes signatures by Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia (1860-1919), King Frederick William IV of Prussia (1795-1861), Marie of Prussia, Queen of Bavaria (1825-89), Frederick William, Elector of Hesse (1802-75), again Maria Alexandrovna and her daughter, the Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1853-1920), Prince Gustav Vasa (1799-1877), Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, Queen of Prussia (1801-73) and her sister Amalie Auguste of Bavaria, Queen of Saxony (1801-77) on a single leaf, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge (1833-97), King Maximilian II of Bavaria (1811-64), King John of Saxony (1801-73), Amalia of Oldenburg, Queen of Greece (1818-75), and Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837-98). The final entry was written by Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. - Ippolit Monighetti studied design at the Stroganov Art School in Moscow and later architecture at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St Petersburg. He started his career as an architect with several villas for the Russian nobility in Tsarkoye Selo (Pushkin). These early successes led to his discovery by Emperor Nicholas I, who commissioned Monighetti with the design of the Turkish Bath in Catherine Park in 1850. Man.\n\nHardcover. Etat : Very good. First. AN ALBUM OF PACIFIC WATERCOLORS. 25 October 1843-10 October 1846. Individual sheets of wove paper window-mounted onto uniform paper (8\" x 5 7/8\", 202mm x 149mm). The ink sketch over graphite, the watercolors heightened in gum arabic. Most captioned in ink recto. All with manuscript in Burney's hand verso, signed (or initialed) by him and dated. Bound in later (ca. 1880?) half morocco over marbled boards. On the spine, \"'PACIFIC COAST SKETCHES. 1845-46'\" gilt. Rubbed generally. All but 5 watercolors (and the ink drawing) with pin holes at the four corners, in one case having pulled through with loss; some with old fill. The only official record of William James Burney (perhaps it is too fanciful to seek a connection to James Burney, the rear-admiral who accompanied Captain Cook on his last two voyages) is that he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Royal Marines 8 May 1843. Some five months later, the first item in the present album finds Burney aboard a corvette, H.M.S. Talbot, laid down in 1821 and launched in 1824. The first item, captioned verso \"Napoleon being informed that Marmont had been Suprised [sic] during the night. . .\" shows someone familiar with cartoons mocking the First Consul in the British press -- despite recounting the battle at Laon from early March 1814. Carefully hatched, it shows a capable artist not without a certain amount of training. Following the careful ink sketch is a gap of more than two years (25 October 1843 to 11 November 1845), and the paintings (a full list with measurements and dates is available) show the Lieutenant in Lima. The first 24 watercolors -- the first 22 located in Lima, the last two more generally Peru -- have been attributed not to Burney but to an artist of the Lima School; cf. an album with 63 \"costumbrista\" watercolors owned by Dr. Archibald Smith, resident surgeon in Lima, which was sold at Christie's London 25 September 2003 (lot 432). These must be the work of a local artist working from either a pattern-book or else a standard repertoire. The following three pictures (nos. 26-28) depict Mexican subjects, as does no. 30; no. 29 is captioned \"Peruvians.\" verso. These show much more curiosity on Burney's part, with an analysis of the grinding of pozole (although he is unaware that the corn is soaked in lime) into masa and the making of tortillas. No. 27, \"A Man dragging a Water Cask\" has an additional drawing in ink of the water cask but viewed at 90 degrees from the depiction recto, suggesting that Burney saw the water cask himself, and, presumably, painted the picture -- and therefore all those that follow (10). Perhaps most intriguing are the four pictures from Hawaii (nos. 31-34), the first depicting taro and poi (\"Tarro and Poë\") with a description verso of the nature of taro and the making of poi. The second depicts a Hawaiian woman horseback, and the final two of outrigger canoes (canoes with a lateral support), both with descriptions verso. Hawaii, still an independent kingdom, was nevertheless engaged with the United Kingdom as well as with France and the United States; doubtless the Talbot was sent there to maintain open trade. The final picture, of a Chilean mounted horseback, shows Lieutenant Burney in Valparaíso about six weeks after his last picture from Hawaii. Five of the pictures (nos. 9, 10, 29, 33 and 34) have part of a J. Whatman watermark, and two of the dates end in 2 (and the preceding digit is almost certainly a 3). All but the ink sketch are numbered in Burney's hand verso, from 5 to 93, with some consecutive runs but also gaps as large as 12. Those numbers correspond roughly to the dates; no. 21 is dated November 14th 1845, and the subsequent picture, no. 33, July 16th 1846 (eight months). This suggests some sort of editorial process -- or perhaps even the loss or destruction of material -- from a larger group of paintings. The pinholes suggest that the pictures were displayed, perhaps in Burney's cabin or in a communal space aboard ship.\n\nOblong folio (488 x 292 mm). 1 leaf (calligraphic ink title), 21 salt paper print photos including two panoramas. Near-contemporary Qajar lacquered papier-mâché binding, likely Persian, with court motifs on both panels, front flyleaf with sticker of \"E. Picart, Papétier, 14 Rue du Bac, Paris\". Pink and silver decorative floral endpapers. Early, uncommonly extensive album of photographs of Constantinople (including some of Athens and Crimea), most signed by the photographer, James Robertson, created during his stay in Istanbul between 1853 and 1857. Of the 21 photographs present, no fewer than 14 show Constantinople and Scutari: they include a magnificent panorama of the city and across the Golden Horn, seen from Camp Daoud Pasha, sweeping views of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and other mosques, the ancient hippodrome with its obelisks, views of the Seraglio, Nusretiye Mosque and Tophane Square, the Fountain of Ahmed III, Süleymaniye Mosque, street scenes, etc. Comparable albums with Constantinople photographs by Robertson are located at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (including the magnificent four-volume album of the Comte de Paris), the Getty Research Institute, Harvard (12 photographs, of which only a few show Constantinople), and other institutions with loose prints such as Princeton (four photographs, one of Constantinople) and the State Library of Victoria (31 photos, of which only four are of Constantinople). In all this is one of the strongest albums known with Constantinople content. The five photographs of Athens include a view of the Acropolis, the Tower of the Winds, the Erechtheion, the Parthenon, and the Temple of Hephaestus (Theseion); the latter two photographs are also in the large Robertson album at the Getty. Two final images show Sevastopol in Crimea (the docks and a large, cloth-backed panorama). Each image is accompanied on the opposite leaf by a handwritten French caption of the place recorded. - Far too little is known about the pioneering Scottish photographer James Robertson (1813-88), who moved at an early date to Constantinople to take the position of Chief Engraver for the Royal Mint, as part of the modernization of the country. He was related by marriage to the younger Felice Beato, a pioneer of 19th century photography, with whom he later opened a studio and recorded the Crimean war, the earliest conflict to be thus recorded. It is possible that the Beato brothers - Felice and Antonio - learnt their craft from Robertson; this album, however, pre-dates that partnership, as the photographs are signed by Robertson only. From 1853 onwards, a collection of Robertson's photographs was published with the title \"Photographic Views of Constantinople\" (by Joseph Cundall at the Photographic Union). - Upper cover shows severe chipping to polychrome lacquer; lower cover in better condition though also with defects. In excellent condition internally, photographs in general in good to very good prints, a few a little faded. - N.

He studied at Metz and first went to Paris in 1869, exhibiting at the Salon in the same year. The war of 1870 forced him to return to Metz and he did not come back to Paris until after the period of the Commune, when he worked successively at the ateliers 'de Suisse' and 'Bonnat'. During this period, he was known almost exclusively for his paintings of cattle set in luminous landscapes, flooded with light. He was able to give a life to his animals in a way that few of his contemporaries could emulate. He received a gold medal at the Paris 'Exposition Universelle' of 1900, was a member of the paintings jury of the 'Salon des Artistes Franais' and a Chevalier of the 'Legion d'Honneur'.

Red morocco with giltstamped borders and cover stampting inspired by the royal arms of Sardinia. Silk endpapers. All edges gilt. Exceptionally plentiful friendship album owned by Comtesse de La Bédoyère, daughter of the senator Henri de La Rochelambert (1789-1863), wife of Georges Huchet de La Bédoyère (1814-67) and court lady to Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III. Indeed, the first entry in the album belongs to the the emperor himself; this is followed on the same page by Eugénie with a quotation from Sophie d'Arbouville's poem \"Je crois\": \"Je crois au Souvenir, au long regret du cur, / Regret que l'on bénit comme un dernier bonheur, / Crépuscule d'amour, triste après la lumière / Mais plus brillant encore que le jour de la terre!\" This is succeeded by the signature of the couple's only son, the eight-year-old Napoléon Eugène Louis; at the bottom of the page is a four-line German quotation from Schiller, which Napoléon III adds in Biarritz on 8 Oct. 1865. Another entry by Eugénie is on fol. 27r, and there are further entries by her son on fol. 21r and 27r (with a little drawing). - Two other noteworthy entries are on pages 21v and 23v: the first is by Bismarck, who signed in Biarritz on the 19th of October 1865, the very month when the secret negotiations between Prussia and France had begun over possibly coalitions before the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The second, written at about the same time, is by Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern and his wife Antonia (fol. 23v). Leopold is considered a pawn of the high politics of his age. In 1870 Bismarck would urge him to accept the Spanish Crown, a move fiercely opposed by Napoléon III. Although Leopold quickly yielded, it was this affair that would ultimately spark the Franco-Prussian War. - The numerous other contributors include: Alexander II of Russia (9r); Amadeus I of Spain (16r); Isabella II of Spain and her children Isabella and Alfonso (17r); Sophie Queen of the Netherlands (8r); Emperor Franz Joseph I and his wife Elisabeth (14r), as well as Elisabeth's lady-in-waiting, countess Caroline Hunyady (12v); Frederick Grand Duke of Baden, and his wife Louise (9a); Marie, Princess of Baden and Duchess of Hamilton (10r); Charles, King of Württemberg, and his wife Olga (37r); Frederick, Prince of Denmark (24r); Umberto I of Italy (7r); Marie Clotilde of Savoy (wife of Prince Napoléon, 7r); Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna of Russia (27v); Grand Duke Charles Alexander of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his wife Sophie Princess of the Netherlands (22r); Louis I of Portugal and his wife Maria Pia of Savoy (19v); Frederick, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg (13r & 17r); George, Duke of Mecklenburg, and his wife Catherine, Grand Duchess of Russia (18r); Marie, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (4v); Adolf, Duke of Nassau (9r & 14v); Pauline, Princess Metternich (2v, 8v, 14v with her daughter Sophie and her aunt Hermine, 31r with her daughters Sophie, Antoinette Pascalina, and Clementine Marie, as well as Rosa, Duchess of Hohenlohe-Sternberg); Richard, Prince Metternich (9r); William I of Prussia and his wife Augusta (10r); Francis, Duke of Harrach (4v); Joseph Joachim Napoleon Murat (2r & 20v); Field Marshal Frederick of Wrangel (7v); the Duchess of Castiglione Colonna (known as a sculptor under the name Marcello, née Adèle d'Affry, 3v); Mélanie Renouard de Bussière Comtesse de Pourtalès (14v); Admiral Edmond Jurien de La Gravière (a four-line poem signed, 9v); Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff (28v); Gustav Prince Blücher von Wahlstatt (9v, born 11 Oct. 1837, knight of the Order of Malta); the Mexican monarchist and ambassador to the court of Napoléon III, José Manuel Hidalgo y Esnaurrízar (3v); the philosopher Elme Marie Caro (a three-line poem, 11r); the politician and economist Félix Esquirou de Parieu (a nearly full-page poem, 10v & 11r); the artist Gustave Doré (with a fine drawing, 11r); the writers Hortense Cornu (7v), Edmond About (28r), and Prosper Mérimée (19r & 20v); Princess Alexandrine Dolgorouky (1834-1913, the mistress of the Tsar, 2v, with two lines from Byron); Ignacio Álvarez de Toledo y Palafox Portocarrero, Conte di Sclafani (son of the 16th Duque de Medina Sidonia, 1812-78, full-page sonnet 22v); Alexandre conte Colonna-Walewski (14v; possibly with his second wife Anna Maria Ricci, daughter of count Zanobi di Ricci and Isabelle née Princess Poniatowska, signing \"Maria Walewski(y)\".

Oblong 4to. Original green cloth, rebacked. Madagascar, 1895 - A well-executed album compiled and drawn by Henri Letrillard, a French officer serving in Madagascar, transformed by the 19 watercolours in his hand, which are made with wit and vigour and vividly illuminate the domestic life of the military administration of the island. The years 1896 to 1904 saw a series of insurrections led against the French military and other foreign influences. The French, using their experience in Indo-China employed the counter-insurgency ?oil-spot? principle, where secure bases were established, from which a ring of stability would spread. Letrillard appears to have served in two such settlements, Madirovalo and Namoroka, both some way inland from the north-west coast. Both Madirovalo and Namoroka had defended bases, with lookout towers, surrounded by wooden ramparts and drawbridges. These stockades are shown several times in Letrillard's watercolours but not in the photographs, nor in any other photographs we have seen before of Madagascar. The photographs capture scenes of daily life showing both settlers and natives, views of Diego Suarez, Vohemar, Nossi Bè [sic], Antananarivo and Mahajunga (sometimes spelt here Majunga), and one photograph of Djibouti. One large photograph is of a firing squad ?le peloton d'éxecution? at Majunga: the victim is not in the frame, but the event is well attended by onlookers. The caption records the officer in charge of the firing squad was later killed by the enemy in Lampasika. The album concludes with numerous shots of French soldiers at camp including an exceptional photograph of soldiers on a hunting trip, posing very theatrically in front of their tent. The watercolours are titled: 1. Garde Principal - Garde Civile Indigine de Madagascar Tenue d'Europe. 2. Souvenir de Madagascar - L'apperitif au Cape du Cercle a Majungae. 3.

Six years later, he was sent to the Congo where he worked as a clerk in the department of native affairs. He was promoted again in 1909 to assistant administrator and retired in 1923.\n\n2 folio albums containing approximately 200 illustrations on 100 leaves: (a) Winsor & Newton artists' drawing book (36 x 26.5cm), between original light green paper covers, with title 'Scrapbook for 1950' on first page, original colour illustration to upper cover, plus 20 leaves of original hand coloured illustrations, some full page, many with more than one to a page, most with handwritten ink joke captions, 7 signed with the artist's monogram. (b) C. Roberson & Co. artists' sketch book with vendor's stamp of Hibbert Bros, Art Dealers, Sheffield to inside front cover, (36 x 24cm), dark grey cloth-covered card boards, black cloth to spine, with title 'This and That' on first page, with illustrations to inside front and rear covers, plus 80 leaves of original hand coloured illustrations and 2 leaves of uncoloured pencil sketches, again many full page, many with more than one to a page, most accompanied by handwritten ink joke captions, 3 signed with the artist's monogram. Some light wear to bindings but contents generally very clean with vibrant colour. The monogram appears to be that of Arnold Taylor, the foremost artist for Bamforth & Co. Although not formatted as postcards these brilliantly executed cartoons are wonderful evocations of the rude saucy seaside culture of the day, the most famous exponent of this genre being of course Donald McGill, whose work they distributed in America. Bamforth & Co. began as a photography business founded by James Bamforth in 1870 in Yorkshire, and became the most prolific publishers of this form. Arnold Taylor joined the firm in 1926 training under Douglas Tempest who had originated the house style. After serving in the Second World War he went back to civilian life as a freelance illustrator and then returned to become a full time artist for Bamforth and a director. Only four illustrators worked for Bamforth: Douglas Tempest, Arnold Taylor, Philip Taylor (no relation) who emigrated to New Zealand after the war and Brian Fitzpatrick (born 1932) who trained under Arnold Taylor. The dating on these albums (1950 to 1957), the distinctive individual style which sets them apart from his protégé, and the monogram in the same style as his printed signature (Taylor) on the cards clearly point towards these being the work of Arnold. After the war, distributors of the cards were subjected to numerous prosecutions under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 and vast numbers of cards were destroyed. Postcard censorship committees were set up in the major seaside resorts, and Bamforth's artists themselves were often subjected to prosection. Few if any of the illustrations in these albums would seem to have made as far as postcard production, being probably too risqué for the age (if not by the standards of today) but would appear to be the private sketchbooks of the artist providing the vivid background to his commercial output.\n\nContemporary photo album in leather binding. More than 210 black and white photos, the majority captioned with typewritten labels. Picture size varies, the majority are 65 × 90 mm; some are up to 180 × 130 mm. . 19 album card leaves with photographs (and 5 blank). 13 unpublished photos of Amelia Earhart in Saint-Louis, Senegal, and a photo of Anita Conti, the pioneer French female oceanographer. Interesting private photo album of a French Colonial commissioner in Africa (Mr. Moiret), with more than 210 contemporary black and white photographs taken mostly in French West Africa. Among them thirteen unpublished photos of the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart in Saint-Louis; an inscribed photo of Anita Conti the first French female oceanographer; an original photograph of a Senegalese woman used as the illustration of a noted local postal stamp in 1938; besides several images of different aircraft, and various colonial themes. The album starts with thirteen hitherto unknown images of Amelia Earhart taken in Saint-Louis, Senegal (French West Africa) on June 8, 1937, after setting a 13 hours and 22 minutes time record for the 1,900 miles of the eastward South Atlantic crossing from Natal, Brazil to the coasts of West Africa, part of her ill-fated second attempt of circumnavigational flight. Due to navigational errors and the weather circumstances on their South Atlantic crossing from Brazil, Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan missed Dakar, their original destination in West Africa, and landed eventually some one hundred miles to the north in Saint-Louis, Senegal on June 7, 1937. As the arrival to this city was unexpected there was no official press coverage, only amateur photos were taken by the few local French officers who greeted the aviators. Besides the present ones, we couldn't find any other photographic records of Amelia Earhart in Saint-Louis. The photos were taken in the morning on June 8, before Earhart's flight forward to Dakar, showing the aviation pioneer in short sleeve checkered shirt around her twin-motored Lockheed (Model 10E) Electra, and the local French officers. Another important piece of the album is Anita Conti's inscribed portrait. This is the only colored picture of the collection, and it shows the first French female oceanographer with a huge manta ray hanging next to her in a fishing net, among local people in a fishing port. The picture is inscribed in ink: \"Pour M. le Commissaire Moiret en grande sympathie Anita Conti 1949\". The album contains a copy of the photo picturing a half-naked Senegalese woman, wearing necklaces, and head-carrying a large pot, which image was used as the model of the illustration for a series of Senegales postal stamps published in 1938. The rest of the album consists of images of the funeral of the victims of an aerial accident of the Béarn squadron at Kayes; several pictures of various aircraft; visits of important French colonial officials and a minister: Colonel Jean-Baptiste Marchand(?), Louis Lefebvre (Governor of Senegal) Boresy (commissioner), and Marius Moutet (Minister of the Colonies); lion hunting; different pictures from Saint-Louis, Ziguinchor, Dakar, Pastoria, Kindia, Louga and Kaolack; an explosion of gasoline barrels in Conakry in 1948; and some pictures of Commissioner Moiret and his wife at their home and garden.

Expertly bound to style in half dark purple morocco over period cloth covered boards, spine lettered in gilt, marbled endpapers A remarkable album of early Chicago photography by John W. Taylor: a major photographic record of Chicago in the late 19th century. Taylor was a bookseller and stationer before advertising himself as a commercial photographer in the late 1880s. He concentrated his work on Chicago-area architecture and city infrastructure. Today he is recognized as a pioneering photographer of architecture, working in Chicago at the very beginning of the skyscraper era. This superb photograph album presents a fairly comprehensive view of Chicago's architecture and life during one of the city's most interesting and vibrant periods, from the highest of the skyscrapers to the interiors of pig pens in the stockyards, with numerous residences, parks, lush interiors, the 1893 World's Fair, and more. Taylor's importance as one of the earliest significant architectural photographers is addressed in Peter Bacon Hales' Silver Cities: Photographing American Urbanization, 1839-1939: \"Photographers of the older generation managed to retain their identities even as they adjusted to their more prosaic role as visual adjuncts to the architects who designed the buildings they photographed. J.W. Taylor of Chicago, for example, made an extensive survey of the \"modern\" buildings of Chicago and its environs, many of which traveled throughout the globe as architects and engineers converged on the city in the later 1800s and beyond to see the miracle of the Chicago style of building. Taylor's pictures went as far as Melbourne, Australia, in the collection of Australian architect E.G. Kilburn, who made his pilgrimage to the architects' mecca in 1889. Kilburn stared, sketched, and took notes; then he brought back photographs by Taylor of everything from the Pullman company town to the Palmer House.\" Chicago has been an especially important architectural center since the period represented in this collection. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed most of the buildings in the downtown area, a special class of architects and engineers flocked to the city, resulting in an architectural boom unequaled in the history of 19th century urban development. Hallowed names such as Louis Sullivan, Dankmar Adler, John M. Van Osdel, Daniel Burnham, William W. Boyington, William LeBaron Jenney, John Wellborn Root, William Holabird, Martin Roche, Edward Baumann, Harris W. Huel, Solon Spencer Beman, and Clinton J. Warren stamped their unique architectural character on the Chicago landscape. Each of these architects is amply represented in the photographs contained herein. There is even one photograph of the magnificent lobby of the Rookery Building, considered the grandest lobby in Chicago at the time. This view is especially interesting to architectural historians because this interior was remodeled a short time later, in 1905 by Adler & Sullivan's former head draftsman, Frank Lloyd Wright. The late 19th century was also a transitional time in building construction, when architects were beginning to leave behind cast iron frames and experiment with steel-frame construction and large areas of plate glass, especially in the \"Commercial Style\" made famous by Sullivan and others in the Chicago School. As a result, some of the earliest modern skyscrapers are found in Chicago. A general summary of the photographs in the album is as follows: forty-two buildings including the Masonic Temple (the tallest skyscraper in the world at the time), the Woman's Temple, the Rookery Building, the Chamber of Commerce, the Monadnock Building, the Northern Hotel, the Home Insurance Building, the Tacoma Building, the Caxton Building, the Pullman Building, the Oakland Hotel, the Grand Pacific Hotel, Palmer House, the Auditorium Building, Marshall Field's, the Lester Building, the Hotel Metropole, Libby Prison, the New Regiment Armory, depots, and churches; seven downtown street scenes; seventeen residential streets, including Lake Shore Dr. and Michigan Ave., and residences of prominent citizens, including Potter Palmer and Lambert Tree; twenty parks, pavilions, and recreation scenes; three of Grant Monument and its unveiling; ten Lincoln Park scenes, some with animals; three of Garfield Park; ten featuring World's Fair building construction; nine views of the October 1892 World's Fair dedication, showing ceremonies and a large parade; two scenes of boating; twelve views of stockyards and meat processing, six exterior and interior views of an auditorium; eight interiors including Palmer House and a bank; and three scenes of horse racing at Washington Park. Taylor's photographs reside in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago (fifty-six images) and the Chicago History Museum (150 images). The subject matter of those collections, and the present work overlap significantly, testament to the prodigious nature of Taylor's output. For example, this collection has a significant number of images related to the World's Columbian Exposition (a.k.a., the Chicago World's Fair) of 1893; the Chicago History Museum collection contains no images from this monumental event in Chicago's history. A truly remarkable record of Chicago architecture by a significant photographer.\n\nHardcover. Etat : Fine. This magnificent, imposing album was made by a prominent late-Victorian hostess, patron of the arts, and gifted artist. Folio. Approx. 225 pages, heavy card. Brown morocco gilt-stamped \"H.R.H.,\" metal lock and corner-pieces, gilt edges (rubbed at joints). Excellent condition. Helen Rose Huth was the wife of the banker Louis Huth. The Huths were major art collectors who displayed their art in the gallery built for the purpose at their home, Possingworth. Helen sat for both George Frederic Watts and James Abbott McNeill Whistler who painted the celebrated Arrangement in Black, No. 2: Portrait of Mrs Louis Huth. Whister required many sittings, and when she complained that Watts never treated her that way, Whistler replied, \"And still, you know, you come to me!\" After Louis Huth's death in 1905, she married Archibald Howe. The album, the product of vast labor, contains 50 watercolors (all but four by Mrs. Huth) comprising studies of flowers, landscapes, and other scenes in Possingworth, East Sussex, and Scalpay (and other Hebridean locations); 70 photographs of buildings, landscapes, people, and paintings; and six pen-and-ink or pencil sketches. Many of the watercolors bear signatures, dates, and places. The album is filled with elegant calligraphic transcriptions of poems and prose pieces by Victorian writers (the Brownings being particular favorites), often with pen-and-ink floral borders. A number of the unsigned poems appear to be by Helen Rose Huth herself. The earliest watercolor in the album is dated 1879, and work continued until at least 1905. In that year Louis Huth died. A photograph of his tombstone is displayed opposite a portrait of the banker. A fine seated studio portrait of Helen Rose Huth, dated 1895, appears early in the volume. The photographs are often connected to the subjects of the poems they accompany. Provenance: Helen Rose Huth (1837-1924). The Huths' fine country house Possingworth Park (completed in 1866) \"was a highly ornate, neo-Gothic mansion The house contained 42 bedrooms, large oak panelled reception rooms and a conservatory named the Winter Garden. There was also a large picture gallery. Louis Huth was a passionate art collector and his house was designed to display artwork at its best. A large picture gallery on the ground floor was designed specifically to exhibit his most treasured artworks. Possingworth was also the venue of a secret meeting between Major Generals Montgomery and Eisenhower in 1942. There they laid plans for the cross-channel invasion that was to take place two years later\" (Holy Cross Priory website). The house is now Holy Cross Priory. Signed by Author(s).\n\nHardcover.

The certificate is hand signed by both the lieutenant and the commander of Heyn's flying corps. Two weeks prior this, Wilhelm (Willi) Heyn represented Germany in the Men's 3000 metres steeplechase at the Berlin Olympics, where he finished ninth. The competition took place on August 3 and August 8, and the final was won by Volmari Iso-Hollo of Finland. Unique photo-album annotated throughout containing 718 original silver gelatin prints, 164 memorabilia (including a military pass, an authorization to take pictures, propaganda leaflets, as well as 105 stamps) documenting German Luftwaffe Unteroffizier Wilhelm Heyn's six-month service in Nationalist Spain (October 1936 -April 1937) as a volunteer in the Legion Condor* during the Spanish Civil War. The Legion Condor was composed of German volunteers sent by Nazi Germany to help Franco defeat the leftist Republican forces. The Legion provided the Luftwaffe the opportunity to develop and perfect tactics of aerial warfare that would fuel Germany's blitzkrieg through Europe in 1939 and 1940. Wilhelm Heyn was a part of it, as he was doing engineering work at Tablada, Seville's military airport. In some photographs he is seen assembling German planes and weapons. The photographs contained in this album generally follow a chronological order, starting with Heyn's arrival to Spain in the Fall of 1936 onboard the infamous German ocean liner MS \"St. Louis\"**, and ending with the impressive victory parade for the Legion Condor in Berlin, on June 6, 1939. The album opens with a large 9 1/4 x 7\" portrait of Wilhelm Heyn in uniform. It is followed by 16 photographs taken onboard the MS \"St. Louis\" during his voyage from Hamburg to Cadiz (Nationalist Spain). Underneath this first series of photographs features a long handwritten inscription by Willi Heyn that says: \"Though prohibited, I took my Leica. With a few exceptions, over a period of 6 months, I took all the photos under cloudless and sunny skies. Speed: 1/100, aperture 3.5, at a distance of 10 meters.\" The next series of silver gelatin prints documents the greeting of the German volunteers by a sizeable crowd of civilians giving the fascist salute; Views of Cadiz; Bomb craters and the ruins of bombed houses seen during Heyn's roadtrip from Cadiz to Seville; Views of Seville with the occasional inscription \"Viva el Generalissimo Franco!\" on the walls; The ruins of Complutum, a Roman city near Madrid (Alcalá de Henares); With the Phalange legion in Córdoba; Views of Bilbao. The following photographs depict the gypsy market at Aracena, Portugal; Granada and the alhambra; Aerial views of Seville; Positions abandoned by the \"Reds\" near Málaga; Views of Málaga, with burned out and bombed out buildings, including the German consulate. The flags of Nationalist Spain, Nazi Germany, and Italy can be seen coming out from windows and balconies. A series of twenty-two pictures depicts Moroccan fighters from Franco's African army, the feared vanguard of a force that, ironically, Franco portrayed as a Christian crusade against godless communists. Another series of photographs (11) shows \"Italian comrades,\" including pilots, men from the \"Brigatta Sevillano,\" and Colonial soldiers. These are followed by views of Gibraltar from Algeciras; Tarifa, including photographs of gypsies begging for money; Seville's military airport of Tablada: a photograph showing a series of mattresses on the floor is captioned \"Meine Falle (my trap), indicating that Heyn had, for a time, shared this rather rudimentary comfort. Another picture shows a He 111 flying overhead; General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano reviewing a military parade in Sevilla on May 1, 1937; Views of León and its anti-aircraft defenses. A series of 15 silver gelatin prints show General Franco among his troops in Seville; Twelve others document a bullfighting in the arenas of the Andalusian capital, immediately followed by three photos showing the ruins of a munition factory (also in Seville) after its explosion; Views of Huelva. After a series of pictures showing various types of Spaniards in and around Seville, the next series of 11 pictures shows the assembling of Me 109 and MG 17 machine guns at Tablada airfield; These are followed by images of the Holy Week procession in Seville. The following 54 photographs show various German and Italian planes at Tablada, such as Ju 52, Ju 87, He 51, He 70, He 111, Me 108, the Italian Fiat CR.32, a twin-engined Savoia bomber, etc. In between photographs of planes, five silver gelatin prints show a dog race in Seville. Three photographs of noteworthy importance show the arrival of the first He 111, then the best and fastest of the German bombers (they made their combat debut in March 1937). These pictures are followed by others showing the painting of German planes with Nationalist Air Force insignia. It is interesting to note that Wilhelm Heyn and other German volunteers of the Legion Condor are seen wearing Spanish khaki-brown uniforms with Nationalist rank insignia. Preceding a series of 22 military photographs taken on the North front, are pasted seven Hotel stickers (Gran Hotel Suizo, Zamora; Hotel Madrid, Las Palmas; Hotel Francia, Vitoria; Gran Hotel Carlton, Bilbao; Hotel Oliden, León; Gran Restaurant Hotel La Vascongada, Burgos; Hotel Norte y Londres, Burgos), as well as the entrance ticket for the bullfighting Heyn attended in Seville (dated December 13, 1936) and its one-leaf.\n\nHardcover.

Etat : Very Good. 1st Edition. Complete set of the \"Two-Brushes\" edition of \"The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido Road\" By Utagawa Hiroshige and Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III). Published by Maruya Kyushiro from 1854-57. Vertical Oban format (37.2 x 25.7)55 (of 55) prints - complete (no title page). Print series on the Tokaido road - the famous road between Kyoto (the ancient capital) and Edo (modern day Tokyo) - are the most celebrated in the Ukiyo-e format. This work brings together two of the most famous artists of Japanese woodblock prints - Hiroshige and Kunisada. Condition: Original decorated silk covered boards with some wear. Restored binding&nbsp; and joins between some prints. Occasional small losses and wear to prints. The prints are backed and bound with some trimming of outer border but no losses to the image or seals. Colours, especially the blues and reds, are bright as the prints have been protected from sunlight by remaining in the binding. Housed in a protective solander box. Hiroshige was famous for his beautiful landscape prints, often in the vertical format rather than the previously used landscape view. His most famous series, 100 views of Edo, is one of the most famous of all series of Japanese prints, and he is rightly celebrated on account of his mastering of the meisho-e art. Kunisada was the best known actor print maker of his day - bringing to the masses images of their favourite \"Kabuki\" actors in vividly drawn and accessible prints. This series allows the two artists to bring together their skills to illustrate scenes along the Tokaido road. Some of the most beautiful prints include those with snow filled backgrounds, deep blue sea scapes and views of mount fuji. It is uncommon to find a complete set of Hiroshige prints in an original album. The prints are bound into the album and therefore have not been displayed, allowing them to maintain their vivid colours which would otherwise have been faded by sunlight.

Une émouvante lettre de son maître et ami Charles E. Kuwasseg (1833 - 1904) débute l'album où figurent une soixantaine d'uvres de ce célèbre peintre de la mer et des paysages maritimes qui fut marin au long cours. La lettre manuscrite bordée de noir datée du 18 juin 1897 placée par Clavel au début de son album nous renseigne sur le fort lien d'amitié fraternel qui l'unissait à son maitre. Dans ce touchant courrier illustré d'un dessin à l'encre noire représentant deux voiliers, Kuwasseg évoque d'abord son quotidien: la perte très récente de son épouse (Ernestine Caroline Chavaroche (1832-1897)), les sorties, la difficulté à se mouvoir, les projets de voyage et de travail entravés par son état. Viennent ensuite les précieux conseils prodigués à son ami et élève: \"Travaillez bien toujours et encore et toujours. Largement et sûrement, ne faites pas en deux coups ce que vous pouvez faire en un seul. Finissez bien les premiers plans. C'est là le côté faible et difficile. Je vous écrirai aussi souvent que le Barbillon me donnera le plaisir de causer avec vous. Mais je vous le dis encore, en vérité, en vérité, ne négligez pas les premiers plans de vos études. C'est là, la science. Pas de sciences, pas de vérité. Votre vieil ami que vous devez croire. C. Kuwasseg.\" Cette lettre est suivie d'un poème introductif: \"L'album est cette galerie, Où chacun suspend son portrait, En jabot l'esprit y paraît, C'est un cours de coquetterie. Mais l'âme s'y montre pourtant, Car il n'est besoin d'un volume, Pour trahir l'artiste content, De son crayon ou de sa plume. De l'encrier, les hannetons, Sortant pour s'essuyer la patte, Viennent dérouler à tâtons, Un trait où leur bêtise éclate. Un bon cur s'y livre d'un mot, Un fat en dix lignes s'étale, Un sage reluit plus qu'un sot, Et l'or pur, que le chrysocale. Pour moi, comme un humble tambour, Je conduis ici la colonne! Je me tais : car le clairon sonne, Et la musique attend son tour! Paris 31 mars 1874. Oscar h.\" Peintre académique dans la mouvance de l'école de Barbizon, Charles Euphrasie Kuwasseg (1833 - 1904) est le fils du peintre autrichien Karl Joseph Kuwasseg, qui lui prodigue les bases du métier d'artiste. Avant de poursuivre dans la voie de son père, le jeune homme s'embarque pour quelques années comme marin au long cours et parcourt le Monde. Cette expérience lui donne une parfaite connaissance des navires et du milieu maritime, talent qui le distingue de ses contemporains. De retour à terre, il devient l'élève de Jean-Baptiste Henri Durand-Brager (1814 - 1879) et d'Eugène Isabey (1803 - 1886). A partir de 1855, Kuwasseg expose régulièrement au Salon de Paris où il obtient de nombreux prix. Soucieux de transmettre son savoir, il devient professeur d'art. Il tisse ainsi une forte relation avec ses élèves, parmi lesquels le plus proche sera Emile Clavel (1848 - 1932) avec lequel il entretiendra une abondante relation épistolaire. L'uvre de Kuwasseg est considérable. Maîtrisant à la perfection l'art du contraste et faisant preuve d'une finesse exceptionnelle, il demeure l'un des peintres français les plus admirés du XIXe siècle. Ses uvres sont exposées dans de nombreux musées, dont les musées des beaux-arts de Rouen, de La Rochelle, de Pontaise, Digne, Périgueux et de Rennes, le Musée maritime de Tatihou, le British Museum ainsi que le Maltwood Art Museum de l'Université de Victoria (Canada). Ses sujets de prédilection sont les rivages, les habitants et les bateaux de Bretagne, de Normandie et de la Mer du Nord. Des thèmes récurrents ressortent des uvres hyperréalistes de ce peintre qui fut marin avant d'être artiste: naufrages, tempêtes, marins pêcheurs au travail (ff. 4, 23, 27, 44). Les nombreux dessins et esquisses de Kuwasseg dont Clavel a garnis son album n'ont pas été choisis par hasard: ils nous offrent une palette très complète de l'uvre de son maître. Parmi ces dessins, nous avons pu identifier une ébauche d'une de ses uvres emblématiques: Le retour des pêcheurs (1862) représentant des marins poussant leur embarcation sur une gréve (f. 44). Cette embarcation est un élément présent dans un grand nombre de ses uvres. Outre sa passion pour la peinture, Clavel poursuit une carrière politique. Il sera entre autres administrateur de la chambre des députés. 6 de ses dessins sont présents dans cet album (ff. 35, 45, 60, 62, 88, 91). Ils représentent des paysages et des scènes maritimes. Le dessin au f. 88 est très proche du style de son frère, Léon Iwill Clavel (1850 - 1923), artiste peintre et mari de Pauline Lacher Ravaisson-Mollien (1856 - 1910). Dans l'album, une dizaine de dessins sont de la main d'Iwill (ff. 7, 11, 14, 48, 51, 52, 53, 54, 59, 61 et 64) et deux croquis portent la signature \"F. Ravaisson-Mollien\" (ff. 18 et 24), le beau-père d'Iwill: Félix Ravaisson-Mollien. Il y a également 3 caricatures au crayon gris (ff. 29, 33 et 34) de la main de Paul de Laubadère (1859 - 1931), artiste peintre, graveur, dessinateur et illustrateur chez Larousse ; 2 dessins (ff. 5 et 8) d'Adrien Louis Bruneau (1831 - 1884), artiste peintre et aquarelliste français ; 1 portrait (f. 15) de Fanny Geefs (1807 - 1883), portraitiste et peintre de scènes de ge."
