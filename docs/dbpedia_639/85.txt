Original Items: Only One Set Available. This is a very nice set of German WWII Heer Army Infantry Hauptmann (Captain's) insignia, consisting of the correct Shoulderboards, collar tabs, and a silver Bullion Hoheitszeichen (National Eagle), also known as the Wehrmachtsadler (Armed Forces Eagle). Most German insignia are quite specific, giving not just the rank, but also the branch and corps. The set is in great condition, and would make a great addition to any uniform devoid of rank insignia.

This lovely set consists of the following items:

- One PAIR of Heer Army Infantry Hauptmann (Captain) Schulterstücken (Shoulderboards). These are the correct company officer version, with 4 rows of silver bullion "Russia Braid" that loop around the button hole. They have the correct two square silver "pips" for Hauptmann Rank. The have white felt fabric backing, which shows around the entire perimeter, the correct Waffenfarbe (Corps Color) for infantry and motorized infantry.

- One PAIR (left and right) of Heer Army Infantry Hauptmann (Captain) Collar Tabs / Patches. Known as Kragenpatte in German, these were attached to the collars to indicate the rank and branch of the wearer. These have two parallel bullion Litzenspiegel, symbolising the double braid of the 19th century. Each of these has a white Mittelstreifen (median strip), the correct Waffenfarbe (Corps Color) for infantry and motorized infantry.

- One Silver Bullion Embroidered Wehrmachtsadler (Armed Forces Eagle) breast eagle.

Condition of all the items is very good, with just some light wear from storage, and some age toning. A great set, ready to display!

The Heer as the German army and part of the Wehrmacht inherited its uniforms and rank structure from the Reichsheer of the Weimar Republic (1921–1935). There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.

These ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Kriegsmarine (Navy), were different, as were those of the SS which was a Party organization outside the Wehrmacht. The NSDAP Party also had its own series of paramilitary uniforms and insignia.
