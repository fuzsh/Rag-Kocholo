When the Germans cut through the door into the gun tunnel, they only cut one of the two doors. By cutting out the wheel that pushed the locking rods up and down into the locking receptacles, the locking rods are freed up so that one side can be opened. The top rod would naturally fall down and unlock, but the bottom rod would have to be pulled up out of its receptacle and held there while the door was being opened. However nobody is reaching through the hole to hold up that rod when the doors are opened (in reality the steel that was cut with the torch would be too hot for a while to do this, and they were in a great hurry to reach the guns before they were sabotaged). Furthermore, only one door was 'freed' yet both doors were opened at the same time, right after the wheel on the one door was cut out with a torch.

Oberleutnant Muesel calls SS officer Sessler by the rank of "Hauptmann". This is a German Army rank, equal to Captain, but was not used by the SS. The equivalent SS rank was "Hauptsturmführer," or "head storm leader". Further, Sessler's collar insignia appears to have only two stripes below the three pips, which is correct for an SS Obersturmführer, which was one rank lower. The insignia for an SS Hauptsturmführer had four white stripes below the three pips.
