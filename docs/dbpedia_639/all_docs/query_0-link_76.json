        "text": "Castles (Burgen und SchlÃ¶sser) near CFB Lahr and CFB Baden-Soellingen, Germany\n\nMost Canadians who lived in or near Baden-Soellingen and Lahr until 1993, will be familiar with the numerous medieval castles within a short drive of the two bases. Â The aim of this page is to tell you a bit about them.\n\nCanadian Forces Base BadenâSoellingen or CFB BadenâSoellingen, formerly known as RCAF Station BadenâSoellingen (Baden), was located near the farming community of SÃ¶llingen, part of the municipality of RheinmÃ¼nster in the West German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. Â It is now a commercial area called Baden Airpark, which also includes the regional airport, Flughafen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden.\n\nCanadian Forces Base Lahr was operated primarily as a French air force base, and later as a Canadian army base, beginning in the late 1960s. Â Lahr is located on the western edge of the Black Forest where the Schutter Valley merges with the Upper Rhine River Plains from the east, in western Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. Â It is approximately 50 km north of Freiburg im Breisgau, 40 km south east of Strasbourg, France, and 95 km south west of Karlsruhe. Â The military base was closed in 1994 and converted to civilian use. Â It is now known as Flughafen.\n\nCanadian Forces Europe (CFE) consisted of two formations in what was known as West Germany before the Berlin Wall fell in November 1990. Â These formations included Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Lahr with 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (4 CMBG) (1957-1993), and No. 1 Canadian Air Division (1 CAD), RCAF, at CFB Base Baden-Soellingen and CFB Base Lahr, which later became No. 1 Canadian Air Group (1 CAG). Â Both formations were closed in 1993 with the end of the Cold War, and the remaining staff came home in 1994.\n\nMy father served with the RCAF at 3 (F) Wing, Zweibrucken, Germany, (1959-1963), and he took our family castle hunting often throughout our time there. Â This generated a huge interest for me in exploring and examining these historic time capsules. Â I joined the Army and had the extraordinary privilege of serving with HQ CFE in Lahr from 1981 to 1983, and with 4 CMBG based at CFB Lahr, from 1989 to 1992. Â I have explored, photographed, painted pictures and documented castles from one end of Europe to the other, and you will find other pages describing some of them on this website, but this page is specifically dedicated to castles in Germany within an hour or two's drive from Baden-Soellingen and Lahr. Â I hope you find them interesting.\n\n(Author Photo)\n\nStorchenturm (stork tower), the only remaining tower of four that formed the corners of the 11th century medieval castle that Lahr was built around. Â The Lahr Storchenturm, also known as Lahr Castle, is the surviving remnant of a medieval moated castle and the landmark of the city of Lahr. Â It takes its name from the storks that regularly brooded there until the 1960s and found food in the wet meadows around the city. Â\n\nLahr developed around the Storchenturm, which was owned by the House of Geroldseck around 1220. Â In 1278 Lahr was granted a city charter, which was renewed in 1377. Â Lahr served as the foundation for municipal independence through to the end of the Old Empire (aka the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation), which was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. Â The significant tax privileges enjoyed by Lahr allowed the city to quickly grow into a centre of trade during the eighteenth century. Â The original Lahr castle may have been built by the von Geroldseck lords between 1220 and 1235. Â In 1250 there are documents that record Walter I von Geroldseck and his son were arrested \"in his castle in Lahr\" by Konrad von Freiburg.\n\nAfter the division of the Geroldseck house in 1277, it became the family seat of the Lower Lordship. In 1426 the Lahr line of the Geroldsecker died out, whereupon the Lahr castle went to various Nassau family members (Nassau-SaarbrÃ¼cken, Nassau-Weilburg, Nassau-Usingen). The castle survived the Thirty Years' War without damage, but was destroyed on 15 September 1677 by the French under FranÃ§ois de CrÃ©quy. It was also damaged in an earthquake on 3 August 1728, after which it was bought by the city of Lahr in 1757. The Storchenturm functioned as a prison until 1861.\n\nThe layout of the castle (Niederungsburg) was a regular rectangular system with four round towers in the corners and thus followed the well-known late Staufer type as its pattern is also found in Sicily with the Castello Ursino in Catania and the Castello Maniace in Syracuse. From this period in German history, it only occurs in the design of the neighbouring Dautenstein Castle in Seelbach and at Neuleiningen Castle. Â The stork tower was the north tower of the complex and now houses a small exhibition on the history of the moated castle. Â Its viewing platform offers a beautiful panoramic view of the old town and the foothills. Â The east tower was uncovered in the 1980s and is located in the basement of the former Cafe Kopf, on Marktstrasse, but can no longer be visited. Â The foundations of the south tower were exposed and removed during the construction of the department store in the 1960s; the west tower was buried under a concrete foundation in 2003. In June 2011 the stork tower was closed because pieces of sandstone threatened to fall and cracks in the masonry were discovered. Â After an extensive renovation, during which the statics of the tower were stabilized and extensive sandstone restorations were carried out, it was reopened in September 2016. (Wikipedia)\n\nLahr history\n\nThe city and surrounding land with the same name remained the property of the Geroldsecks from 1220 until 1426. Their successor was the House of Moers-Saarwerden, which gave half the land to Baden as collateral for loans and in 1497 legal ownership was transferred to it. Â The other half was transferred to the House of Nassau-SaarbrÃ¼cken in 1522. Â Both Baden and the House of Nassau-SaarbrÃ¼cken implemented the Reformation in the areas under their control and ruled the city jointly until the Baden half also became the property of the Nassaus in 1629.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War reduced the city's population significantly and during the Dutch War in 1677 it was burned to the ground by French troops under the leadership of Marshall de CrÃ©quy. Â Later on, during the eighteenth century, the citizens of Lahr sued the House of Nassau in the \"Lahr Law Suits\" in 1726 and 1778. Â The suits were decided in favour of the citizens of Lahr and thwarted Nassau's attempt at absolute rule.\n\nIn 1803 Lahr and the surrounding land in Baden became the seat of a court, whose areal boundaries were modified several times. Â During the 19th century Lahr was highly involved in the printing industry and the Burda Publishing Company, currently located in neighboring Offenburg, had its start at least partially in Lahr.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1919 and again between 1936 and 1945, the city was home to a garrison. Â After the Second World War, Lahr became one of the bases for the French until France left the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1966. Â From 1967 until 1994, the Canada's NATO forces came to Lahr. Â Following the closing down of the \"old\" Brigade Area in North-Rhine Westphalia centred around Iserlohn, Hemer, Deilinghofen as well as Werl and Soest (1970â1971), the Land Forces and their families were transferred to the Lahr area to join the existing Air Force contingent. Â On 6 May 1994, Werner Dietz, Mayor of Lahr/Schwarzenwald presented the Canadian Forces a plaque from \"the City of Lahr/Schwarzenwald, in the Black Forest, thanking the Canadian Forces for their contribution to Peace, Security and harmonious relations between Canadian and German populations of Lahr during their presence from 1967 to 1994.\" After the Canadian Forces left in 1994, a small Canadian contingent of former civilian employees remained in Lahr (approximately 200).\n\nLahr's boroughs also enjoy a long history. Hugsweier, Burgheim, Dinglingen, Langenwinkel, Mietersheim and Sulz used to be ruled by the same rulers as Lahr itself and therefore shared a great deal of the city's history. Â In 1803 they became part of Baden and were communities in a previous district of Lahr until they were merged and\n\nbecame part of the city.\n\nHugsweier was first mentioned in 1341 as \"Hugelswilre\", Burgheim in 1035 as \"Burcheim\", Dinglingen in 961 as \"Tuntelinga\", Mietersheim in 762 as \"Mutherisheim\" and Sulz in 1270 as \"Sulz\". Langenwinkel is a village with a fairly short history. Â It was built starting in 1787 in the area of the Nassau forest, which was cut down to make room for the new village, on land that belonged to Dinglingen. Â In 1790 the first house was built and in 1797 Langenwinkel became an independent community that was also made part of Baden in 1803. Â After 1951 the airfield for the Canadian Forces was built in Langenwinkel's immediate vicinity and the associated noise and traffic became a tremendous hardship for the residents of Langenwinkel. Â In 1965 the German Ministry of Defense decided therefore to move the village and Langenwinkel was recreated between 1968 and 1971 several kilometres southeast of the Hurster Hof.\n\nKippenheimweiler was first mentioned in 1427 as \"Wilre\" and then in 1462 as \"Kippenwiler\". Â It was an extension of Kippenheim and like Kippenheim it became part of the Baden House of Mahlberg in 1629. Â In 1810 it was assigned to the Ettenheim court and only Ã­ts subsequent dissolution did it become part of the district Lahr. Kuhbach was first mentioned in 1035 as \"Cuobach\". Â Initially it belonged to the Geroldsecks. Â After the family divided into two in 1278 was it made part of Hohengeroldseck (Vogtei Seelbach). Â Ecclesiastically, it was first part of the Burgheim parish and was later assigned to the Lahr parish. Â After the counter-reformation the town became Catholic again, and was only made part of Baden in 1819 when it was assigned to the district of Lahr.\n\nReichenbach was first mentioned as \"Richenbach\" in 1270. Â The town was divided up between the Houses of Geroldseck and Tiersberg. Â During the fourteenth century the part owned by the Tiersbergs came after several detours into the possession of Baden and was given to the RÃ¶der vassals as a fief. Â The Hohengeroldseck part eventually became the property of the Counts van der Leyen. Reichenbach was initially Protestant, but returned to Catholicism in 1658. Â The Baden-RÃ¶der part was then passed on to the County of Geroldseck in 1806 and with the County came into the possession of Austria in 1815. Â In 1819 it was returned to Baden and became part of the court of Hohengeroldseck. Â In 1832 was it made part of the Lahr district.

Â Located in the Ortenau region of Swabia, the area of the state never exceeded 72 square km (45 square miles). Â Despite its small size, Hohengeroldseck had many neighbours. Â At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was bound clockwise by the Free Imperial City of Zell to the north, the Lordship of Hausen (a possession of the Prince of FÃ¼rstenberg) to the east, the Ettenheim territory of the bishopric of Strassburg to the south as well as an enclave within the territory of Hohengeroldseck itself, an estate of a Free Imperial Knight of the autonomous Ortenau District to the southwest, territory of Nassau-Usingen to the west with portions of Baden-Durlach above and below it, and finally a tiny exclave of Further Austria to the northwest.\n\nIn addition, two small exclaves to the northwest of Hohengeroldseck shared numerous borders. Â The larger exclave was surrounded on three sides by three different estates of Free Imperial Knights of the Ortenau District, with an exclave of Further Austria to the north and the Free Imperial City of Gengenbach to the northeast, while the smaller exclave of Hohengeroldseck was bound to the south by the Schutterwald knightly estate (held in condominium with Austria), another exclave of Further Austria to the west, and the Free Imperial City of Offenburg to the north and east. Â Both exclaves were held in condominium with Austria. Â The Baden authorities referred to the territory as \"the Provisional District of Hohengeroldseck\" until 1 March 1831, when it was merged into the District of Lahr and and it then disappeared from history.

Â The castle originally served to secure the pass road into the Kinzig valley. Â From the 11th century on, the southern Ortenau came under the influence of the ZÃ¤hringer. Â The construction of the castle can also be traced back to this family in the early 12th century. Â It was probably managed by a ZÃ¤hringen ministerial family. Â However, there are few written records. In the course of disputes between the Hohenstaufen and the bishops of Strasbourg, the castle was probably destroyed around 1245 by the neighboring Geroldseckern, who belonged to the episcopal party. Â After that, the security of the pass road was taken over at the newly built Hohengeroldseck Castle.\n\nIn the 12th century, ZÃ¤hringer ministerials were mentioned repeatedly, bearing the name \"von LÃ¼tzelhardt\". Â A branch of this family or this community of heirs rose to imperial ministry around the middle of the 12th century. Â\n\nKonrad von LÃ¼tzelhardt became one of the most important officials of the Hohenstaufen imperial administration in Italy. Â The name Mosca-in-Cervello or Mosca-in-Cerebro (MÃ¼ck-im-Hirn) has been handed down in the records. During the conquest of the Kingdom of Sicily by Henry VI, Konrad von LÃ¼tzelhardt as Margrave of Molise served as an impoortant military leader. Â Descendants of Konrad appear in the records of the 13th century under the name de Lucinardo. Â They opposed the Emperor Friedrich II in the late 13th century and no further records of their history have been found.The legend of the GrÃ¼selhorn surrounds the castle, according to which a gentleman from Geroldseck was abducted to LÃ¼tzelhardt, but was able to discover his whereabouts through a familiar horn call and then freed himself. Â Shortly\n\nafter his escape, the LÃ¼tzelhardt was destroyed.\n\nThe three parts of the castle lie on three rocks of different sizes, up to 10 meters high, and were originally probably connected by a palisade. Â Most of the rising walls of the castle go back to excavations and reconstructions from 1926 to 1929. The remains of the main house with Romanesque palace windows and a dragon relief are particularly impressive. Â Inside the main castle there is a medieval cistern and a pouring stone.

Â Heidelberg was first mentioned in 1196 as \"Heidelberch\". Â The castle ruins are among the most important Renaissance structures north of the Alps. Â The castle has only been partially rebuilt since its demolition in the 17th and 18th centuries. Â It is located 80 metres (260 ft) up the northern part of the Konigstuhl ,hillside, and thereby dominates the view of the old town. Â The earliest castle structure near this site was built before 1214 and later expanded into two castles c1294; however, in 1537, a lightning bolt destroyed the upper castle. Â The present structures had been expanded by 1650, before damage by later wars and fires. Â In 1764, another lightning bolt caused a fire which destroyed some rebuilt sections.\n\nWhen Ruprecht became the King of Germany in 1401, the castle was so small that on his return from his coronation, he had to camp out in the Augustinians' monastery, on the site of today's University Square. Â What he desired was more space for his entourage and court and to impress his guests, but also additional defences to turn the castle into a fortress. Â After Ruprecht's death in 1410, his land was divided between his four sons. During the reign of Louis V, Elector Palatine (1508â1544) that Martin Luther came to Heidelberg to defend one of his theses (Heidelberg Disputation) and paid a visit to the castle. Â He was shown around by Louis's younger brother, Wolfgang, Count Palatine, and in a letter to his friend George Spalatin praised the castle's beauty and its defences.\n\nIn 1618, Protestants rebelling against the Holy Roman Empire offered the crown of Bohemia to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who accepted despite misgivings and in doing so triggered the outbreak of the Thirty Year's War. Â The Thirty Years' War was a religious war fought primarily in Central Europe Â between 1618 and 1648. It resulted in the deaths of over 8 million people, including 20% of the German population, making it one of the most destructive conflicts in human history.\n\nIt was during the Thirty Years War that arms were raised against the castle for the first time. Â This period marks the end of the castle's construction; the centuries to follow brought with them destruction and rebuilding. After his defeat at the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620, Frederick V was on the run as an outlaw and had to release his troops prematurely, leaving the Palatinate undefended against General Tilly, the supreme commander of the Imperial and Holy Roman Empire's troops. Â On 26 August 1622, Tilly commenced his attack on Heidelberg, taking the town on 16 September, and the castle few days later. When the Swedes captured Heidelberg on 5 May 1633 and opened fire on the castle from the KÃ¶nigstuhl hill behind it, Tilly handed over the castle. Â The following year, the emperor's troops tried to recapture the castle, but it was not until July 1635 that they succeeded. Â It remained in their possession until the Peace of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years War was signed. Â The new ruler, Chalres Louis (Karl Ludwig) and his family did not move into the ruined castle until 7 October 1649.\n\n(Author's artwork.)\n\nHeidelberg Castle c1616.\n\nHeidelberg Castle before its destruction in 1689.\n\nHeidelberger Schloss on the Neckar River showing the Alte Bruecke (Old Bridge), Heilgigeistkirche (Church of the Holy Ghost), from an engraving by Matthaeus Merian. After the death of Charles II, Elector Palatine, Louis XIV of France demanded the surrender of the allodial title in favour of the Duchess of OrlÃ©ans, Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine, who he claimed was the rightful heir to the Simmern lands. Â On 29 September 1688, the French troops marched into the Palatinate of the Rhine and on 24 October moved into Heidelberg, which had been deserted by Philipp Wilhelm, the new Elector Palatine. Â At war against the allied European powers, France's war council decided to destroy all fortifications and to lay waste to the Palatinate (BrÃ»lez le Palatinat!), in order to prevent an enemy attack from this area. Â As the French withdrew from the castle on 2 March 1689, they set fire to it and blew the front off the Fat Tower. Â Portions of the town were also burned, but the mercy of a French general, RenÃ© de Froulay de TessÃ©, who told the townspeople to set small fires in their homes to create smoke and the illusion of burning prevented wider destruction.\n\nImmediately upon his accession in 1690, Johann Wilhelm, Elector palatine had the walls and towers rebuilt. Â When the French again reached the gates of Heidelberg in 1691 and 1692, the town's defenses were so good that they did not gain entry. On 18 May 1693, the French were yet again at the town's gates and took it on 22 May. Â However, they did not attain control of the castle and destroyed the town in attempt to weaken the castle's main support base. The castle's occupants capitulated the next day. Â The French then took the opportunity to finish the destruction of Heidelberg that they began in 1689, after their hurried exit from the town. Â The towers and walls that had survived the last wave of destruction, were blown up with mines.\n\nIn 1697 the Treaty of Ryswick was signed, marking the end of the War of the Grand Alliance and finally bringing peace to the town. Â Plans were made to pull down the castle and to reuse parts of it for a new palace in the valley. When difficulties with this plan became apparent, the castle was partially repaired. Â In the following decades, basic repairs were made, but Heidelberg Castle remained essentially a ruin. Â In 1767, the south wall was quarried for stone to build Â Schwetzingen Castle. Â In 1784, the vaults in the Ottoheinrich wing were filled in, and the castle used as a source of building materials. The question of whether the castle should be completely restored was discussed for a long time. Eventually, a detailed plan was developed for preserving or repairing the main building. Â The planners completed their work in 1890, which led a commission of specialists from across Germany to decide that while a complete or partial rebuilding of the castle was not possible, it was possible to preserve it in its current condition. Â Only the Friedrich Building, whose interiors were fire damaged, but not ruined, would be restored. Â This reconstruction was done from 1897 to 1900 by Karl SchÃ¤fer at the enormous cost of 520,000 Marks.\n\nThe forecourt is the area enclosed between the main gate, the upper prince's well, the Elisabeth gate, the castle gate and the entrance to the garden. Around 1800 it was used by the overseer for drying laundry. Later on, it was used for grazing cattle, and chickens and geese were kept here. Â The approach to the forecourt takes you across a stone bridge, over a partially filled-in ditch. Â The main gate was built in 1528. Â The original watchhouse was destroyed in the War of the Grand Alliance, and replaced in 1718 by a round-arched entrance gate. Â The gate to the left of the main entrance was closed by means of a drawbridge. Â The former harness room, originally a coach house, was in reality begun as a fortification. After the Thirty Year's War, it was used as a stables as well as a toolshed, garage and carriage house. Â (Harry B.

Â The complex is made up of over 50 buildings. These include a three-winged residential building with an attached chapel, four pavilions separated by a road, some smaller utility buildings, and a garden. Â It is noted for its fine Roccoco decoration and in particular its entrance staircase, which is regarded as one of the finest examples of its kind in any Baroque palace.\n\nThe palace was built in the first half of the 18th century by Damian Hugo Philipp von SchÃ¶nborn, Prince-Bishop of Speyer. Â SchÃ¶nborn drew on family connections to recruit building staff and experts in the Baroque style, most notably Balthasar Neumann. Â Although intended to be the permanent residence of the Prince-Bishops, they occupied it for less than a century.\n\nOn 1 March 1945, only two months before the end of the Second World War, much of the palace was destroyed in an American air raid directed against nearby railway installations. Â It has since been completely rebuilt in a restoration project that lasted until 1996. Â The interiors have been partly restored and the palace now houses two museums. Â The two main museums at Bruchsal Palace are the Deutsches Musikautomaten-Museum (German music machine museum), maintained by the Baden State Museum, and the Municipal History Museum.\n\n(Gunter Josef Radig Photo)\n\nKarlsruhe Palace was erected in 1715 by Margrave Charles III William of Baden-Durlach, after a dispute with the citizens of his previous capital, Durlach. Â The city of Karlsruhe has since grown around it. The first building was constructed by Jakob Friedrich von Batzendorf. Â The city was planned with the tower of the palace (Schloss) at the centre and 32 streets radiating out from it like spokes on a wheel or ribs on a folding fan, so that a nickname for Karlsruhe in German is the \"fan city\" (FÃ¤cherstadt).\n\nOriginally partially made of wood, the palace had to be rebuilt in 1746, using stone. Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden-Durlach at the time, and who eventually became Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, then had the palace altered by Balthasar Neumann and Friedrich von Kesslau until 1770, adding larger windows and doors, pavilions and wings. Â In 1785, Wilhelm Jeremias MÃ¼ller shortened the tower, adding a cupola.\n\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848, Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, was expelled in 1849 for some time.

Â Shortly after this purchase the castle was burnt down during the Peasants' revolt. Â The rebellious peasants had to pay 5000 Gulden for the rebuilding of the castle. Â After a lightning strike in 1777 caused heavy damage, the castle was left in disrepair. Â Since 1973 the castle has been owned by the Sinsheim council, who had large parts of the castle restored.

Â The original structure was built in 1100 as the primary residence of the Counts of Eberstein, but by the end of the 16th century had been abandoned and much of the castle was torn down to provide materials for other structures. Â\n\nA spur castle situated on a once-strategic mountain peak, the fortress was constructed as the seat of the Counts of Eberstein perhaps as early as 1100. Â The oldest part of the castle remaining intact are the ramparts. Â The first historical mention of the castle occurs in 1197 as Castrum Eberstein. Â In the second half of the 13th century, the Ebersteins began construction on Castle Neu-Eberstein and the older seat declined in prominence and ultimately fell into disrepair; by 1573, it was uninhabited and thereafter became a quarry used by both the Eberstein descendants and locals. Â Starting in the 1800s, efforts have been made to preserve the site (which now consists solely of elements of the curtain wall and keep) and it is presently one of the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-Wuerttemberg, housing a restaurant and garden open to tourists.

Â It was originally a spur castle of the Counts of Eberstein with a shield wall on the slope, the mountain side of which was reinforced by the rectangular keep. Â The complex was expanded several times and converted into a country palace at the beginning of the 19th century by the ruling family from Baden. Â Today Eberstein Castle is used as a hotel, restaurant, winery and private residence.\n\nThe castle is 130 meters above the valley floor of the Murg on a mountain nose in the north of the Obertsrot district of Gernsbach, which marks the transition from the deeply cut central Murg valley to the lower Murg valley, which widens near Gernsbach. Â The rock of Forbach granite exposed on the slope of the Murg is known as the Grafensprung. Neu-Eberstein was first mentioned as Novum Castrum Eberstein in 1272 and, in addition to Alt-Eberstein Castle, served as the seat of the lords of the Eberstein County. Â Otto I. von Eberstein (1207â1279) is considered the builder and first lord of the castle. Â The shield wall and the stump of the keep are among the oldest components. Â The complex was significantly expanded in the 16th century under Wilhelm IV von Eberstein (1497â1562), who had fountains, stair towers, the upper\n\nfloor of the residential building, an archive building, a castle chapel and various walls built. Â In the early 17th century, Philip III von Eberstein (â 1609) added the new gatehouse, the outer works in the east and west as well as additional walls.\n\nAfter their extinction with the death of Count Casimir (1639â1660), the property of the Ebersteiner fell partly to the margraviate of Baden and partly to WÃ¼rttemberg-Neuenstadt. Â In the future, the complex was no longer used as a manor house, but was only the residence of the Baden and WÃ¼rttemberg administrators. Â At the time of the Palatinate War of Succession, the castle was a safe place for Prince Leopold Wilhelm, the Baden-Baden archives and for the nuns of the Holy Sepulcher. In 1691 part of the complex burned down. After that, the castle was only used as a workshop and warehouse. Over time, the WÃ¼rttemberg shares of the former Eberstein property gradually came to Baden. In 1798 the Margrave of Baden, Karl Friedrich, handed the complex over to his son Friedrich. From 1802 he had the castle converted into a palace in the neo-Gothic style by the Karlsruhe builder Friedrich Weinbrenner.\n\nFrom around 1830, under Grand Duke Leopold, the buildings were also redesigned in the neo-Gothic style. Â According to plans by Weinbrenner's student Heinrich HÃ¼bsch, today's restaurant building was also built in place of the old stables. The executive foreman Johann Belzer was also responsible for further renovations in the late 19th century. Â Grand Duke Leopold also acquired numerous art treasures that he exhibited in the palace, including historical glass paintings from the parish church in DÃ¼hren and Ottersweier, a Gothic crucifixion group from 1464 from the former Cistercian monastery Herrenalb and Romanesque reliefs from the 12th century from the demolished monastery church in Petershausen. Â Leopold had the house chapel furnished with paintings by Moritz von Schwind and the court painter Albert Graefle.\n\nDuring the Baden Revolution, at the end of June 1849, Palatine militants under the command of Ludwig Blenker and Elise Blenker looted the castle. Â The local poet, gardener and farmer Heinrich WÃ¼rtenberger worked as a castle administrator at Eberstein Castle in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Â In 1902, Grand Duke Friedrich I appointed him economic councilor. The keep took its present shape in 1951 according to plans by Otto Linde. Â\n\nIn 2000, Max Markgraf von Baden sold the castle to Gerd Overlack, a Cologne-based industrial insurance broker from Gernsbach, who also bought Gymnich Castle in 2012. Â He had the listed castle extensively restored. Â The vineyard was also newly laid out and terraced on five hectares facing south. Â The vineyard had been cleared by the margrave in 1994 because the management no longer seemed profitable. Â The clearing had led to considerable resentment in Gernsbach and Obertsrot,\n\nas the vineyard shapes the landscape. Â Schloss Eberstein is a four-star restaurant and hotel.

Â The Fautsburg is a ruined castle above the RehmÃ¼hle in the Aichelberg district of the city of Bad Wildbad in the Calw district in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. Â With the exception of the keep rebuilt in the 20th century and some remains of the wall, there are no more visible traces of the hillside castle. It is assumed that the castle was built by the Counts of Calw, as the castle was mentioned in their possession in 1276. This is also the year of the first written mention, which is dated 23 February 1276. Â It is possible that the castle was built by the Counts of Hohenberg at the end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century. Â Several documents from this time indicate a ministerial seat of the knights from Vogtesberg. Â Their heirs, the Lords of Hornberg, sold half of the castle to Count Eberhard von WÃ¼rttemberg in 1323 for Â£ 300 Heller. Â The other half later came to the House of WÃ¼rttemberg via Count Palatine Rudolf IV of TÃ¼bingen. Â The administration of the castle was incumbent on the lower nobility of the region. Â\n\nIn 1476, Count Eberhard von WÃ¼rttemberg granted Domdechant Count Johann von Helfenstein refuge in the castle from the Strasbourg Bishop Rupprecht, whom he had previously criticized. Â In 1561 the reformer Johannes Brenz received the Fautsburg as a fief. Â In 1570 Brenz returned the fito the WÃ¼rttemberg people. Â In the same year, Duke Ludwig von WÃ¼rttemberg enfeoffed the Hirsau monastery with the property. Â In 1594 the forester Eberhard Zangmeister was enfeoffed with the property by Duke Friedrich von WÃ¼rttemberg, which fell back to WÃ¼rttemberg in 1603. Â In 1604 a forester was named as a resident of the already dilapidated Fautsburg. Â It later came into the possession of the RehmÃ¼ller family, who used the walls as a quarry. Â In the middle of the 19th century the forest usage rights were bought up by the state and redistributed. Â The property with the Fautsburg was added to Johann Georg Rentschler. Â In 1910 and 1939, security work was carried out on the ruins for the first time. Â At the beginning of the 1960s, the keep was rebuilt as a lookout tower and in 1967 the ruins were opened to the public, although shortly afterwards the walls grew over again and were forgotten.\n\nIn 2000 the castle was exposed again and the first castle festival was held in 2004. Â In 2007 the tower received a roof. The keep has a footprint of 7.15 by 6.7 meters and a wall thickness of around two meters. Â In addition, some remains of the wall have been preserved. A superficial examination of the castle complex took place in 1930. Â To the west of the tower there was probably a shield wall three meters thick. Since no interlocking with the tower could be established in 1930, the wall may be younger than the tower. The hall was probably connected to the shield wall, opposite were the farm buildings. Â A gate kennel was found in the northeast.\n\nWith the roof, the tower reaches a height of around 20 m. Â Access is from the higher north side via an access path with stairs to a small wooden bridge at the high entrance, which is now covered and flanked by a man-high wooden figure. Â In the tower there is a wooden staircase with 33 steps, which leads over an intermediate platform to the 14.3 m high viewing platform. From here there is a good view of the valley of the Kleine Enz. Â (Friedrich-Wilhelm Krahe: Burgen des deutschen Mittelalters.\n\nGrundriss-Lexikon.

Â The ruins of Liebeneck cannot be reached by car; only forest tracks such as the Ostweg lead to it.\n\nThe original castle was probably built in the 12th century. Â It is first mentioned in 1236 on the occasion of the transfer of the castle and village of WÃ¼rm from the lords of WeiÃenstein at KrÃ¤heneck to Margrave Rudolph of Baden. Â The castle was intended to guard the rafting toll station by the river. Â Later the castle was an inherited fief of the lords of WeiÃenstein before ending up in the possession of the lords of Leutrum von Ertingen.\n\nIn 1692, during the Orleans War, the castle was razed. Â In 1828 it was transferred to the state of Baden. Â The site was then deliberately destroyed so that \"no riff-raff will find shelter there\" (\"Gesindel dort keinen Unterschlupf findet\"). Â From 1968 to 1977 the 30-metre-high bergfried was renovated. Of the original castle, the bergfried and several walls surrounding the castle courtyard survive.

The hill consists predominantly of porphyritic rock. The ruins represent a relatively well-preserved 12th-century castle. The keep behind the curtain walls, a tower in the north-western corner of the complex as well as the outer ward with half-round and angular towers, are still visible. There appears to have been a moat around the castle. An early medieval fortification was possibly erected at the location of the future castle around 750 by Count Ruodbrecht, one of Charlemagne's uncles. Â The original castle was built around 1100 by the Counts of Nagold, who became the Counts Palatine of TÃ¼bingen in 1145. Â The castle complex was extensively expanded between 1153 and 1162.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century the castle passed into the possession of the Counts of Hohenberg. Â Thereafter, one branch of this family called itself Counts of Nagold and had the castle transformed into their residence in the 13th and 14th century. Â In 1364 they sold the castle to the Counts of WÃ¼rttemberg. Â The new owners added bastions and towers to the outer ward and had the castle occupied by their ministeriales. Â Towards the end of the Thirty Years' War, the castle was conquered by Bavarian troops in 1645 and severely damaged. Â In 1646 the remnants of the castle were pulled down. In 1945 the northwest tower was destroyed by a low-level attack carried out by Allied aircraft.

They named themselves after the castle, which gave the state of Baden its name. Â The castle was built as the first dominion center of the Margraves of Limburg after the relocation of their rule to the Upper Rhine on the western slope of the rocky mountain Battert above what was then called Baden. Â The construction of the upper castle, the so-called Hermannsbaus, by Margrave Hermann II (1074â1130) is assumed to have started around 1100. Â From 1112 the Margraves of Baden named themselves after the castle. Under Margrave Bernhard I of Baden (1372â1431) the Gothic lower castle was built, which was expanded by Margrave Jakob I (1431â1453) to become the representative center of the margravate.\n\nThe most important component is the Bernhard Building (around 1400), whose column on the ground floor with a coat of arms carried by angels once supported the mighty vault. Â In its heyday, the castle had 100 rooms. Â In the same century, Margrave Christoph I expanded the New Castle, which was begun in 1370, in the city of Baden and moved the residence there in 1479. The old castle then served as a widow's residence, but in 1599 it was destroyed by fire. Â The ruins were not structurally secured until after 1830. Â It was later looked after by the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.\n\nThe old castle has belonged to Wolfgang Scheidtweiler since 2017. Â From its tower you have a good panoramic view of Baden-Baden and a distant view of the Rhine plain and the Vosges. Â The castle courtyard of the ruin is also worth seeing. The castle and tower can Â be visited free of charge. Â There is a restaurant in the castle. Â The castle is a popular starting point for hikes on the Battert with its scenic, protected climbing rocks and a protected forest. Â A large wind harp stands in the ruins of the great hall of the old castle. The harp, which was set up in 1999, has a total height of 4.10 meters and 120 strings, it was developed and built by the local musician and harp maker RÃ¼diger Oppermann, who called it the largest wind harp in Europe. Â The nylon strings are stimulated by the draft to produce the basic notes C and G. Â From 1851 to 1920 there was a small wind harp in the knight's hall of the old castle. (Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg I.

The layout of the Yburg includes a bergfried (tall tower) to the west, built around 1200, and the enceinte (main defensive enclosure of the fortification) to the east, built in the 13th or 14th centuries. Â An elliptically-shaped curtain wall at the top of the Yberg encloses both portions and is one of the castle's oldest features. Â The castle was entered through a tower-zwinger. Â The bergfried stands 20 meters (66 ft) tall and has an entryway 9 meters (30 ft) tall itself. Â There was a residential building and a keep in the enceinte.\n\nA zwinger is an open kill zone area between two defensive walls that is used for defensive purposes. Â Zwingers were built to improve the defence of castles and town walls. Â The term is German and is linked with zwingen, \"to force\", perhaps because the Zwinger forced an enemy to negotiate it before assaulting the main defensive line. The main purpose of this feature was so that the besieging force could not reach the actual castle wall very easily with battering rams or belfries, forcing them to stop at the lower, outer wall. Â This also enabled two ranks of archers, behind and above one another, to fire upon the approaching enemy.\n\nIn 1190, Herman V, Margrave of baden-Baden, inherited the rights to the villages of Steinbach and Sinzheim. Â As the Yburg would have secured the Margraviate of Baden's new southwest border, it can be assumed that they built it at this time. Â The surrounding territory increasingly came under Baden's influence from mid-13th century on. Â Eberstein Castle was constructed nearby, Hohenbaden Castle was enlarged, and Steinbach was fortified and given the status of a township. Â Until 1369, the Yburg was administered by the RÃ¶der von Rodeck family, who served the House of Baden as civil servants. Â In the 15th century, under Margrave Bernhard I, a bailiff resided at Yburg, and it is likely the castle received its eastern annex for their residence.\n\nThe Yburg was destroyed in 1525 during the German Peasant's War. Â In 1535, the Margraviate of Baden split into the rival Margraviates of Baden-Durlach and Baden-Baden, which then further split with the Baden-Rodemacher line. Â When the Baden-Baden line died out in 1588, Baden-Rodemacher's scion, Edward Fortunatus inherited Baden-Baden. Â According to legend, he and two alchemists practiced black magic in the castle. Â Edward Fortunatus attempted to assassinate his cousin and rival Ernest Frederick, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, who proceeded to occupy Baden-Baden. Â The Margraves of Baden-Durlach would control the margraviate from 1594 to 1622, when Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperoro, reinstated Edward Fortunatus's son William as Margrave of Baden-Baden. Â Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, rebuilt the Yburg in 1620. Â The castle was again destroyed in 1689 by French troops participating in the Nine Years' War. Â The castle's ruins were partially restored from 1888 to 1913. Â A restaurant was established within the castle in 1892.

Â The old castle emerged from a high medieval castle. Â The New Palace was built in the early 17th century. Â Today there is a museum in the old castle. The castle, on the walls of which the old castle was built, probably dates from the 12th century. Â The castle was first mentioned in 1287, owned by the Counts of Hohenberg. Hermann, son of Margrave Rudolf von Baden, conquered the city, but had to return it to Count Burkhard von Hohenberg in 1288. [1] In 1398 the Hohenbergers sold the Altensteig estate to the margraves of Baden. Â The castle became the seat of the Baden bailiffs.\n\nIn 1603 Altensteig came to the Duchy of WÃ¼rttemberg as part of an area swap. Â From 1605 Heinrich Schickhardt built the New Palace as the official and residence of the WÃ¼rttemberg Obervogts. Â The old castle served as a fruit store from the 18th century. Â The lower part of the striking residential tower with a floor area of around 11 meters by 16 meters consists of sandstone masonry. Â The construction method suggests that it was built in the 12th and 13th centuries. Â An Alemannic timber frame building was probably built on top of it in the 15th century. Â The cellar, DÃ¼rnitz, kitchen, living room and servants' rooms were housed on the six floors. Â The largest room,\n\nknown today as the âKnight's Hallâ, is located on the second floor.\n\nOn the north side, the palace complex was protected by a wall with a battlement and two towers. Â The towers were once used as a prison. While the western tower called \"Heaven\" allowed a view of the outside through barred windows, the eastern tower called \"Hell\" contained a 15-meter-deep dungeon. Â The city wall was attached to the fortification. Â The half-timbered building on a stone base is in front of the old castle on the valley side. In between there is a small courtyard. Â In Jacob Ramminger's Seebuch from 1613, the new castle is shown with two bay windows on the south side, which are no longer preserved.From 1977 the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg had the new castle renovated, which later housed the forest administration. Â In 1982, the renovation work began in the old castle. Â With the support of the Heimat- und Geschichtsverein founded for this purpose, the museum in the Old Castle was opened in 1985 and expanded in the following years.

Â 44 km (27 Mi) North of Lahr. The castle was built around 1200 by the lords of Windeck. Â The family, probably of Franconian origin and based in the Oretnau, owned wealthy estates and held numerous fiefs from various liege lords. Â The first documentary evidence dates to 1212 when a certain Melchior von Windeck comes to light, and, in 1248, the lords of Windeck are mentioned in a document at Schwarzach Abbey. Â The castle itself, however, is first mentioned in 1335. Â It became a jointly-managed castle or Ganerbenburg very early on as a result of divisions of inheritance. Â In the early 13th century the New Windeck Castle (Burg Neu-Windeck) was built by a branch of the family near Lauf within sight of Old Windeck. Â During the course of the 13th and 14th centuries, the lords of Windeck came into conflict many times with neighbouring territorial lords, the city of StraÃburg and the counts of WÃ¼rttemberg in alliance with the MartinsvÃ¶gel during the so-called Schlegler Wars, during which the castle was besieged, but never captured and so remained largely undamaged. Â In the late 14th century, however, it was damaged by a devastating fire. Â Stables and domestic buildings were razed, and the valuable archives, the basis of numerous legal titles, were destroyed. Â Reinhard von Windeck had the damaged buildings rebuilt.\n\nIn 1466, the last heir of Old Windeck, Anna, only child of Burkhard von Windeck, married and so the castle went to the family of her husband, Baron Berthold IV of New Windeck. Â His descendants occupied the castle until the 16th century, but from 1561 it was used as a quarry for other buildings in BÃ¼hl, such as the Kappelwindeck Church. Â Its owner thus moved into the more modern Schlosshof (today a hotel) in BÃ¼hl. Â The last heir, Jakob von Windeck, died in Venice in 1592. Â The fief was returned to the Empire, the remaining allotments went in equal portions to his two sisters: Old Windeck to Ursula and New Windeck to Elizabeth.\n\n(Christian Barth Photo)\n\nBurg Alt Windeck at night. All that remains of the castle today is a bergfried, a tower and parts of the curtain wall. Â They may be visited in good weather. Â The castle probably consisted of an outer and an inner ward that each had its own bergfried and palas. Â The smaller, northern bergfried, with a ground plan measuring 8.5 metres square, guarded the castle gate and the downhill side of the site. Â The surviving southern bergfried, 27.6 metres high, has a floor area of 9.6 x 9.8 metres. Â Its lower floor was probably used as a dungeon or store room. Â In wartime, its thick walls made it a strong refuge for the castle's residents. Â On the first and second floors of the attached palas were probably reception rooms such as the great hall.

Â The castle was built c1050 by Duke Berthold II of ZÃ¤hringen, and was first mentioned in a written text in 1120. Â The well-preserved ruin includes the remains of two towers with living quarters, a gate tower, a rampart, and a shield wall with a chapel attached. Â The original castle included at least one additional tower with living quarters. Â The remains of an outer bailey are surrounded by a dry moat and a second shield wall. There is a small museum in the cellar of the former castle chapel and a restaurant.\n\nThe Schauenburg was held in the Platinate by Gottfried von Calw (d 1131). Â The castle came into the possession of the Count of Calw, Count-Palatine of bei Rhein, (1113â1126) through his marriage to Liutgard von ZÃ¤hringen. Â On his death it passed to his granddaughter Uta, Duchess of Eberstein. Â The Schauenburg became part of the dowry upon Uta's marriage in 1131 to Duke Welf VI, a brother of Henry X, Duke of Bavaria. Â After Uta's death, it is recorded in the Sindelfinger Chronicles that the castle passed to Uta's brother Eberhard, founder of the All Saints' Abbey. Â The Schauenburg remained in the possession of the Counts of Eberstein until the financial ruin of Wolf von Eberstein. Â In 1386, half of the possessions of the Ebersteins, including Schauenburg Castle, were sold to Rudolf VII, Margrave of Baden-Baden (d 1391).\n\nThe knights of Schauenburg became a separate noble family, under the Ebersteins, working as \"Ministerialis\" (German knights). Â Both men and women held ministerial status, and the laws on ministeriales made no distinction between the sexes in how they were treated). Â Many served as \"Burgmann\" (a member of the nobility), who weres obligated to guard and defend the castle. Â The role is roughly equivalent to the English castellan and the name derives from the German word for castle, Burg. Â After the death of Ludwig Winterbach von Schauenburg, the last of his line, there was a dispute between Heinrich TruchseÃ von HÃ¶fingen and the other line of the Schauenburg family as to who possessed the fiefdom. Â The family Schauenburg wanted the Schauenburg to remain a Ganerburg (a castle occupied and managed by several families or family lines at the same time. These families shared common areas of the castle including the courtyard, well and chapel whilst maintaining their own private living quarters.They occurred primarily in medieval Germany. Â The Heinrich family, however, wanted sole fiefdom. Â This led to the Feud of the lords of Schauenburg with Bernhard von Baden, a two-year war from 1402 to 1403. Â This resulted, in 1404, with the Schauenburg remaining with the Eberstein family.\n\nDuring its time as an active castle, it was besieged many times and overrun twice. Â After at least two different demolitions (probably during 1689 by Vuban and MÃ©lac in the Nine Year's War, the castle was ruined, and, in the 17th Century, stones from the castle were used in the building of Gaisbach Castle by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen. Â The castle has been a preserved ruin since the 18th century and is currently owned by the Freiherren von Schauenburg.

Â From 1832 the castle was expanded into a palace by the Margraves of Baden in the Romantic style and is still privately owned by the Baden family as the Margravial Badische Weinkellerei.\n\nThe castle complex rises 10 meters above the neck ditch, which today serves as a parking lot.

Â Dautenstein Castle, also known as Tutenstein, Duttenstein or Dutenstein, is a former moated castle near Dautenstein in the area of what is now the community of Seelbach in the Ortenaukreis in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. This Hohenstaufen low level castle was constructed using a Hohenstaufen building layout, with a rectangular floor plan and four round corner towers. Â It was initially known as the Tiefburg Lahr, and was probably built c1235 by the Reichsministeriale von Dautenstein. Â It formed a fortress line with the Schwanau and Lahr Tiefburgs. Â The Tiefburg Dautenstein was destroyed in the Peasants' War, bought by Jakob von Hohengeroldseck in 1584. Â It was enlarged to make a residence for the Hohengeroldseck rule in the late Renaissance style until 1599. Â Jakob died in Dautenstein in 1634 without male descendants. Â Two years later the castle was burned down by Count von Gallas and remained in ruins for decades. Â In 1812, the privy councilor of Prince Leyche, Philipp Carl Schmidt, acquired the partly restored property and had it rebuilt.The current building complex, which is privately owned, goes back to the new building in the first half of the 19th century and only takes up part of the complex. Â Dautenstein is included in the list of monuments of the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and was raised in 2005 by the regional association Badische Heimat to the status of a \"cultural heritage of the state\".

Â Landeck Castle, also known as Schadelandeck, is the ruin of a spur castle at 285 m above sea level, on a limestone rock in the village of the same name Landeck, a district of Teningen, north of the city of Emmendingen in the district of Emmendingen in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. The ruin is one of the few well-preserved ruins in the Breisgau. The time of origin of the upper and lower castle can be dated to around 1269. Â In 1260 \"Dietrich, the Vogt von Landecke\", a follower\n\nof the Lords von Geroldseck, is mentioned in a document. Â In 1277 the castle came into the joint ownership of the brothers Heinrich and Walther von Geroldseck. Â In 1298 it was besieged by Count Egino II of Freiburg and the citizens of Freiburg, in 1300 it came from Heinrich von Geroldseck via the Order of St. John to the Freiburg citizen Johann Snewlin. Â There was a âlittle townâ near the castle, which went down again before 1400. Â\n\nThe castle chapel of St. Katharina was first mentioned in 1315 by the co-owner Heinrich von Rappoltstein. In 1354 Konrad Snewlin first called himself \"Schnewlin von Landeck\", from 1394 Hanmann Snewlin von Landeck lived in the castle with his cousin Heinrich von Wiesneck. In the same year Snewelin pledged half of the castle to him, namely the \"lower castle\" including the goat barn, bakery and the cellar under the chapel. In 1428 Hanmann's three sons shared the castle. In 1490 Anthony and Bastian Snewlin von Landeck litigated about the division of the castle, eight years later the indebted Landeck family had to take Margrave Christoph von Baden's fief. In 1511 Bastian Snewlin von Landeck sold half of the castle to his feudal lord, the Margrave of Baden. In 1525 the castle was destroyed by rebellious farmers and not rebuilt. Â Margrave Ernst von Baden bought the rest of the castle site with the village of KÃ¶ndringen in 1538.\n\nThe castle complex was divided into an upper and a lower castle. Â The upper castle presents itself as a roughly longitudinally rectangular system, which is surrounded on all sides by a circular wall. The main building of the upper castle is a high, tower-like hall, the most representative part of the castle. It had four floors with three chimneys and rich windows, especially on the north side, its front side. Â\n\nThree sides of the palace are formed by the curtain wall, the south side faces the former courtyard. Â The upper one is separated from the lower castle by a section ditch that is now only shallow. Â The roughly triangular lower castle is also dominated by a wide hall (20 Ã 10 meters) with late Romanesque and early Gothic double windows. Â A castle chapel with a Gothic choir arch, windows with a ribbed vault and console figures is attached to its narrow northeastern side. Â Immediately to the west of the two parts of the castle, remains of masonry indicate a presumable outer bailey.\n\nPlan view of Burg Landeck.\n\n(Joergens Photo)\n\nBurgruin Landeck, Emmendingen.\n\n(Joergens Photo)\n\nBurgruin Landeck, Emmendingen.\n\n(Joachim Haller Photo)The Schwarzenburg (Black Castle), historically called Schwarzenberg (Black Mountain), is a fortified castle ruin near Waldkirch in the district of Emmendinger in the southwest of Baden-Wurttemberg. Â Along with the Kastelburg, the less well known Schwarzenburg is one of two ruined castles owned by the town of Waldkirch. Â The ruins of the former hill castle, 656.2 m (2153 ft) above sea level on the top of the Schwarzenberg ('Black Mountain'), a spur of the Kandel have decayed to such an extent that only a few wall foundation are visible.\n\nThe castle was probably built as a refuge as well as for security, possibly to protect the political power of the Schwarzenberg family. Â Such a castle, on a vantage point visible from far away in the Rhine valley, was clear evidence of their status as free noblemen, subordinate in rank only to the Holy Roman Emperor. Â In sharp contrast to Waldkirch and the Kastelburg, which was built later, the Schwarzburg was not a fief of Further Austria, but the allodial property of the Schwarzenbergs until they died out\n\nin the mid-15th century.\n\nThe Schwarzenburg was built around 1120 by the patrons of the St. Margaret monastery in Waldkirch under Conrad Waldkilcha, who after 1120 called himself Conrad of Suarzinberg and thus became the founder of the noble family of Schwarzenberg. Â With Conrad, the male branch of the Conradines of Waldkirch died out. Â In 1213, their estates were transferred to Conrad's sister, Adelheid, wife of Walter I of Eschenbach-Schnabelburg. Â In 1270, John, a descendant of Adelheid who came with his nephew William from Switzerland, inherited the territory and called himself John I of Schwarzenberg. Â On 8 August 1300, John and William of Schwarzenberg granted Waldkirch town privileges. Â In 1315, the territory was divided: John took over the Kastelburg and William remained on the Schwarzenburg. Â The Schwarzenberg family line died out in 1347 with Lord Ulrich II of Schwarzenberg. Â He was succeeded by John III of the Kastelberg line. Â This led to the reunification of the two lines.\n\nAfter the death of Hans Werner of Schwarzenberg in 1459, his son-in-law, Henry of Rechenberg zu Hohenrechberg, inherited the estate and the office of bailiff (Amtmann). Â In 1503, Martin of Rechenberg succeeded his late father, Henry; he, in turn, was succeeded in 1540 by his son Hans Louis of Rechberg. Â After the death of Hans Louis in 1542, Sebastian of Ehingen acquired the estate. Â During the wedding ceremony of his daughter in 1559, he was stabbed by his son, whereupon the rule of Schwarzenberg was transferred to Hans Raphael Reischach as a fief in 1560.\n\nIn 1567, Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, took over the debt-ridden territory. Â He ordered the demolition and removal of the dilapidated Schwarzenburg castle in 1578. Â This order was not carried out, however. Â An inspection in 1583, by the Further Austrian government agency of Ensisheim led to a report indicating the castle was badly dilapidated. Â In accordance with the report of an annalist of the Margarethenstift Waldkirch of 1590, very little was left of the roof-structure and the walls had collapsed. Â The ruin was eventually used as a quarry. Â Since 1975, the castle has been successively researched and restored and, since 1980, has been accessible to the public. Â In 1995, the town of Waldkirch erected an information board of the history of the castle next to the ruins. Â (Alfons Zettler, Thomas Zotz: Die Burgen im mittelalterlichen Breisgau, I.

It stands on a hill about 100 meters (330 feet) above the center of Waldkirch in Breisgau. The Kastelburg was built between 1260 and 1270 by the Lords of Schwarzenberg. Like the Schwarzenburg on the opposite side of the valley, its purpose was to defend the town of Waldkirch and to control the trade route through the Elz valley. The first inhabitant of the castle was Johann I of Schwarzenberg. Â The Schwarzenbergs died out already in 1345 and the castle was sold to Martin Malterer from Freiburg who fell in 1386 in the Battle of Sempach. Â In 1429 the castle was passed on to Berthold of Staufen. Â\n\nIn the Thirty Years' War the castle was destroyed by troops of the Kaiser on 14 March 1634, so that it would not fall into the hands of the advancing Swedish troops. In recent years attempts have been made to conserve the edificial structure of the ruin that is standing romantically above the historic center of Waldkirch (Action Kastelburg).

In 1161 Hartmut von Keppenbach (Hartmuot de Keppenbach) was mentioned as the ZÃ¤hringer ministerial. Â The castle became the headquarters of the Lords of Keppenbach. Â In 1276 the castle was first mentioned in a feudal letter. From 1336 at the latest, Keppenbach Castle was a Ganerbeburg, in which the Schnewlin family also held a share. Â After the Keppenbachers had become robber knights, the castle was destroyed in 1396 at the behest of the Habsburgs, who had extended their sphere of influence to the Breisgau and Freiburg im Breisgau. Â\n\nThe castle was rebuilt by the lords of Keppenbach - now Habsburg feudal people - at the beginning of the 15th century. Â In 1525 the castle was destroyed again in the Peasants' War.The former hilltop castle was a small, compact, three-sided shield wall castle, which consisted of an upper, middle and lower castle with a double-folded shield wall, which was 2.3 meters thick and 7.5 meters high, surrounded by a neck ditch with a width of about 30 meters. Â It apparently served to protect the silver mining in the Brettenbachtal. Â From the former castle complex there are still considerable remains of the main castle wall. Â Since the castle complex does not have a keep, it is\n\nassumed that the tower 70 meters further north and 38 meters below the castle belonged to the complex as a keep and was connected to the outer bailey.

Â In 1219 the castle was mentioned as \"castro nostro Kvrinberc\". Â In the 13th century the Lords of Ãsenberg expanded the outer bailey. Â In 1352 the castle and the associated rule went to Heinrich IV von Hachberg, who temporarily resided at the castle. Â Later, the castle and the rule of Kirnberg were pledged to regional noble families, such as the influential Freiburg noble family the Schnewlin-Landeck, the knights Martin Malterer and Konrad von Weinsberg and, from 1424, the bishops of Strasbourg, who expanded the castle one last time and according to the time fortified.\n\nIn 1372 the rule of KÃ¼rnberg fell to the Dukes Albrecht and Leopold of Austria when the Landgraviate of Breisgau was taken over. Â It remained with the Habsburgs and was awarded as a fief until the end of Upper Austria. Â In 1515, a few years before the outbreak of the Peasant War, Wolf von HÃ¼rnheim zum Tuttenstein acquired the Kirnburg as a fief. Â After the castle was in poor condition at the beginning of the Thirty Years War, it was quickly captured and razed by the troops of Duke Bernhard von Weimar, who passed through.

It was presumably built in the 11th century and was originally known as castle Hachberg. The line of nobles known as the Margraves of Baden-Hachberg most likely derive their name from this castle and before it was razed by the French it was the second largest fortification in Baden.\n\nHistorians are uncertain about where the name Hachberg comes from. One theory is that an estate in the region was given to a man referred to as Hacho who was a part of Charlemagnes retinue. This hypothesis is also supported by an engraved plaque added to the castle by Karl II and a document dating back to 1161 mentions it as Castro Hahberc. In any case, whoever the true builder of the castle is most likely chose its name for their lineage, resulting in the family sidebranch of the house of Baden known as Baden-Hachberg. Dietrich von Emmendingen (who later called himself von Hachberg) most likely founded the castle to harvest the forests surrounding it for lumber. Its first mention dates back to a document from 1127. The further development of later property documents suggests that Erkenbold von Hachberg, the last of his name, gave his holdings to the ZÃ¤hringer to finance his participation in the crusades (1147â1149).\n\nA Â document on the talks about the founding of the monastery Tennenbach from 1161 implies that Herman IV von Baden was the reigning lord of castle Hachberg at the time. When his sons Herman V and Heinrich I divided the margraviate among each other in 1212 the castle became the centre of power for the Margraves of Baden-Hachberg. The Margraves of Baden-Hachberg 1212-1415: Margrave Bernhard I of the main family of Baden acquired the castle from the highly indebted Margrave Otto II von Baden-Hachberg.\n\nThe Margraves of Baden 1415-1535. The castle survived the war of the Oberrheinischer StÃ¤dtebund versus Bernhard I in 1424 and even withstood siege during the German Peasant's War in 1525. The Margraves of Baden-Durlach 1535-1771: Karl II greatly enhanced the castle's defences in 1553 and turned it into a more modern, renaissance style fortification. Margrave Georg Friedrich added 7 bastions around the castle's perimeter and gave some the names of Hachbergs sister castles in Baden all of which laid in the realm of Margraves of Baden-Durlach. (Bastion RÃ¶tteln; Bastion Sausenberg; and Bastion Badenweiler).\n\nThe castle was besieged for two years during the Thirty Years' War in 1634 and was slighted for the first time after surrendering to the attackers. Â However, in 1660 Margrave Friedrich VI induced the reconstruction of the castle. Â In 1681 the defences were destroyed voluntarily by the French after they had taken many of the holdings in Baden through the Treaty of the Peace of Nijmegen and a manned castle Hachberg could have posed a sizable threat to their new territory. Â Only three years later peasants caused a fire which destroyed the remaining living quarters. In 1688 French troops destroyed what little remained of the fortification, turning it into a ruin.\n\nThe first steps at preserving the ruin were taken towards the end of the 19th century and continue to this day. Â In 1991 a small museum was added in the cellar. Â The castle has been depicted in several paintings and has many mythical tales surrounding it, speaking of hidden treasure and restless knights, waiting to return.

Â In 1684, a fire destroyed the upper castle.\n\nIn 1688, the castle was occupied by the troops of the French King Louis XIV and the remaining inner fortifications were demolished. In 1698, a plan for reconstruction was rejected because of the high costs and the proven ineffectiveness of the fortress without the appropriate support from field armies.

Â Umkirch Castle, also called Hohenzollern Castle or Royal Romanian Castle, is a castle of the Swabian Hohenzollern in Umkirch in the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. Â In the 14th century, the moated castle of the Lords stood on the site of today's castle. Â Among the various noble families who had their seat in Umkirch in the Middle Ages, the lords of TÃ¼bingen are believed to have lived in the castle in 1474. Members of the Roggenbach and Beroldingen families succeeded in increasing their property before it was transferred to the Kageneck Majorat in 1740. Â After the old castle was demolished in 1743, the middle section was rebuilt. The two side wings followed between 1788 and 1789. Â\n\nIn 1785 the property was converted into an allod for Flora von Kageneck (1779â1857). Â She was the daughter of Friedrich von Kageneck and Maria Theresia von Salm-Reifferscheidt and the cousin of the Austrian statesman Metternich. Â Flora von Kageneck married Count Eugen von Wrbna on June 20, 1798. Â In 1816/17 the castle was expanded in the Italian country house style and the belvedere was added. The coat of arms of the Kageneck-Wrbna can still be found in the gable.\n\nIn 1827 the palace was acquired by Grand Duchess StÃ©phanie von Baden for 345,000 guilders. Â The building served as a summer residence in July and August. In the inheritance contract of 29 June 1860, the Grand Duchess decreed that her daughter Princess Josephine von Baden should receive the castle property. Â The princess was the wife of Karl Anton von Hohenzollern. Â On 3 May 1887, Josephine made Umkirch an ancestral property, that is, an inalienable property. Â The property came on 19 June 1900 to her son Karl, who was the Romanian king. Â The king died in 1914. Â At the end of 1916, the castle went to Prince Friedrich Victor von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen,\n\nwho used it as a summer residence. Â The onset of the First World War had delayed inheritance. In addition to Friedrich Wilhelm von Hohenzollern (1924â2010), the two princes Ferfried von Hohenzollern and Leopold von Bayern were born in the palace in 1943.\n\nDuring the Second World War, from September 1944 to April 1945, the princely family was forced to be evacuated and interned at Wilflingen Castle. Â After the war, the south of Baden became part of the French occupation zone and General Pierre PÃ¨ne resided in the castle as governor for the state of Baden on behalf of the French occupying forces from 1946 to 1952, so that Friedrich Wilhelm partly lived in his sisterâs country house next door. Â After Friedrich Victor's death in 1965, his son Friedrich Wilhelm received the castle property, which is still owned by the Swabian Hohenzollern.

Â The ruins of ZÃ¤hringen castle is what remains of the ancestral seat of the ZÃ¤hringer Alemannic noble family, located near Freiburg im Breisgau. Â The ZÃ¤hringer family became a powerful ducal dynasty in the area of what is now Southern Germany and Switzerland in the high-medieval period. Â They founded several cities, including Freiburg im Breisgau, Villingen, Neuenburg, Freiburg im Ãechtland, Bern, Thun, Rheinfelden and Murten. Â The name ZÃ¤hringen is mentioned for the first time in records dating back to the early 11th century. Â However, it is not clear without ambiguity whether they refer already to a fortification on the hilltop or to the village, the present day suburb of Freiburg. The first unambiguous mention of the castle is in the \"Rotulus Sanpetrinus\", a parchment roll issued in the nearby Abbey of St. Peter,\n\ndated to 1128. Â The document was written in Latin and contains the passage \"apud castrum Zaringen\" (castrum is the Latin word for castle).\n\nThe castle was the seat of Berthold II of ZÃ¤hringen until 1091, when he moved out of this castle to Freiburg Castle on the Schlossberg of Freiburg. Â He had ordered the construction of that new castle, because he considered that location to be more advantageous both from commercial and strategical perspectives. Â The castle was besieged and taken in the context of the feud between Welf VI and Conrad III by the young Frederick Barbarossa in 1146. Â After the House of ZÃ¤hringen died out in 1218, Emperor Frederick II confiscated ZÃ¤hringen castle as imperial fief.\n\nBetween 1275 and 1281, in the wake of controversies between the emperor and the Counts of Urach regarding territorial possessions, the castle was destroyed and rebuilt. Â In 1422 the Margrave of Baden acquired a part of the compound. Â The castle was destroyed during the German Peasant's War in 1525. Â In 1815 the castle hill became the property of the House of Baden and today the area belongs to the municipality of Gundelfingen. Â What remains intact is a large round tower that was built in the 13th century. Â It has an observation deck that is surrounded by merlons.

Â The castle site lies in a triangle formed by the entrance of the HÃ¶llental valley â the Lower HÃ¶llental and the Engenbach valley, not far from the Buchenbach village of Falkensteig, 617.6 m above sea level on a rocky crag that is very difficult to get to today. Â Of the castle itself only a few wall remains are left. Â It is one of the less well preserved ruins in the Breisgau.\n\nThe castle may have been built around 1200 on a steep eminence at the lower entrance to the HÃ¶llental, also known as the Falkensteige, by a ZÃ¤hringen ministerialis family. Â (The aristocratic surname \"von Falkenstein\" could however also indicate an earlier construction date of around 1150, but no records confirm this). Â Its founders probably came from the Wittental valley from the lords of Weiler and Blankenberg and are first recorded from 1137 to 1148 as the lords of Falkenstein. Â In the ensuing period they rose to become one of the circle of important aristocratic families in the Breisgau. Â The valley was named Falkensteiner Tal after them and their castle, and only changed to HÃ¶llental later on. Â The castle was supposed to guard the important communication route through the valley which linked the Breisgau the Baar region and Lake Constance. Â The lords of the castle soon reigned over an area that extended up the valley to Hinterzarten and Titisee. Â Other castles built by the Falkensteins were FalkenbÃ¼hl Castle, Bickenreute near Kirchzarten and Bubenstein Castle, also called Neufalkenstein (\"New Falkenstein\").\n\nAfter the toll road, which had brought the Falkensteins substantial revenue, met with competition from the route through the Wagensteig valley built in 1310-1379, according to legend, the knights are said to have operated more and more as robber barons. Â In a conflict between an aristocratic coalition under the leadership of Count Eberhard II of WÃ¼rttemberg against the Swabian League, Â Werner von Falkenstein, on the orders of his overlord, blocked roads and plundered the League's citizens.\n\nAffected by the economic decline of the low nobility in the late 14th century, it was probably financial pressure that drove the Falkensteins to extend this approach to innocent travellers. Â This behaviour was the reason that, on 6 December 1388, Freiburg attacked and destroyed Falkenstein Castle. Â Other historians blame its destruction, however, on Freiburg's hunger for power. Â The castle chapel apparently survived the demise of the castle. Â In 1460, it is first mentioned as St. Nicholas' Chapel. Â In 1606 it was moved into the valley by the HÃ¶llenbach stream, today known as the Rotbach.\n\nThe irregular and very inaccessible castle site rises through four levels. Â It is described here in four sections. Â First, is the lower ward (Unterburg, A) whose fragmented wall remains are up to six metres high and three metres thick, and run from the southwest side of the castle rock up to, and along, its northern flank. Â Here, there are more, very substantial, staggered sections of wall and what is assumed to be the old entrance area and castle gate (5) above the Engenbach valley and present day entrance at its western tip. Second, there is an adjoining neck ditch, about 20 metres long, 4 to 6 metres wide and up to 12 metres deep (D), cutting through the ridge to the northeast. Third, is a small middle ward (Mittelburg, B) on a roughly six-metre-high rock step rising above the lower ward - which lies to its west and north - on the upper part of the castle rock, and extending northeast to a point above the neck ditch.\n\nFourth, is the upper ward (Oberburg) or inner ward (Kernburg) (C) on the ascending, elongated rocky ridge that is up to 55 metres long, between 12 and 16 metres wide and runs from southwest to northeast. Â Among other large sections of surviving wall at the south and southwestern tip are: a wall about ten metres long and three metres high facing the valley which is believed to belong to the castle kitchen (10); another wall, six metres wide and about 2.5 metres high (11), which could be the site of the chapel; a further prominent, tooth-like wall in the centre on the southeastern cliff edge - easily visible from the HÃ¶llental valley when approaching from Hirschsprung - and finally the remains of a quadrangle with walls measuring about nine by nine metres - probably the former bergfried - on a lofty site at the northeastern end of the castle rock.
