Historical case studies present contrasting topics and themes that not only vary geographically and ideologically but also overlap in significant ways, pushing back the boundaries of the ‘music as commerce’ discussion. Through diverse, multidisciplinary approaches, the volume opens up significant paths for conversation about how musical concepts, practices and products were shaped by interrelationships between culture and commerce.\n\nThe Idea of Art Music in a Commercial World, 1800 -1930\n\nArt and money, culture and commerce, have long been seen as uncomfortable bedfellows. Indeed, the connections between them have tended to resist full investigation, particularly in the musical sphere. The Idea of Art Music in a Commercial World, 1800–1930, is a collection of essays that present fresh insights into the ways in which art music, i.e., classical music, functioned beyond its newly established aesthetic purpose (art for art’s sake) and intersected with commercial agendas in nineteenth- and early twentiethcentury culture. Understanding how art music was portrayed and perceived in a modernizing marketplace, and how culture and commerce interacted, are the book’s main goals.\n\nIdea of Art Music in a Commercial World, 1800 -1930 The\n\nEDITED BY\n\nChristina Bashford and\n\nRoberta Montemorra Marvin\n\nThe Idea of Art Music in a Commercial World, 1800–1930\n\nIdea of Art.indb 1\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nMusic in Society and Culture issn 2047-2773\n\nSeries Editors vanessa agnew, katharine ellis, jonathan glixon, & david gramit Consulting Editor tim bl anning This series brings history and musicology together in ways that will embed social and cultural questions into the very fabric of music-history writing. Music in Society and Culture approaches music not as a discipline, but as a subject that can be discussed in myriad ways. Those ways are cross-disciplinary, requiring a mastery of more than one mode of enquiry. This series therefore invites research on art and popular music in the Western tradition and in cross-cultural encounters involving Western music, from the early modern period to the twenty-first century. Books in the series will demonstrate how music operates within a particular historical, social, political or institutional context; how and why society and its constituent groups choose their music; how historical, cultural and musical change interrelate; and how, for whom, and why music's value undergoes critical reassessment.

It was to be a gift for the Paderewski Singing Society in Chicago. The writer revelled in the marketplace advantage for any firm that could boast a linkage with such a famous figure, commenting: To have the name of the great pianist, whose earnings in America this season exceeded something over $200,000, associated with any piano is a distinct point gained in favor of that instrument, and the Huntington manufacturers have every reason for feeling elated over the high compliment paid them by the eminent pianist.1\n\nClearly, Paderewski’s alleged earnings were understood as astronomically high (and to gain perspective here, we might note that average annual wages at the time in the United States amounted to a mere $438).2 They were also a telling articulation of the pianist’s artistic celebrity, which – as the writer suggests – was poised to be leveraged by others in the marketplace. In this respect, Paderewski was an integral part of music’s modernizing commercial world. That commercial world – including the relationship of art, money and performers – has become a fairly well-rehearsed topic in musicological literature, and it forms the background for the essays in this book. Yet, as the reader will discover, the essays approach the discussion from new directions to investigate (among other things) how the ideas that became attached to art music in the nineteenth century, and even the very idea of art music per se, were intertwined with the technological advances and socio-economic shifts that were then in train. To bring those changes into focus, we might consider that, even by 1900, Paderewski (born 1860) would have witnessed some remarkable developments in the music business during the course of his career. Those developments had begun in the early nineteenth century and were catalysed by industrialization and the swathe of advances in science, manufacturing and transportation that followed on from it. Over the one hundred years from 1800 to 1900, 1 Music Trade Review, 9 June 1900, p. 13. 2 http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/his/e_prices1.htm [accessed 25 February 2015] (based on Scott Derks, ed., The Value of a Dollar: Prices and Incomes in the United States, 1860–1999 [Lakeville, CT: Grey House, 1999], p. 52 [averaged from standard jobs, including farm labour]).\n\n1\n\nIdea of Art.indb 1\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n2\n\nChristina Bashford\n\nmarkets for music increased in size and socio-geographic spread, and they diversified; technology improved and enhanced musical goods, from sheet music to instruments; prices fell; new products entered the marketplace, most significantly – in the early 1900s – with the arrival of recorded sound; and it became possible to transport musical commodities (both people and artefacts, carrying information and ideas) across and between continents with relative ease and affordability. Moreover, support systems for the promotion and advertising of musical goods developed, creating publicity mechanisms that would have been unimaginable in their size or sophistication a century or so earlier. In 1800, Beethoven gave his first benefit concert in Vienna, where he was living, to a socially elite audience that was gathered largely by word of mouth or simple advertising – notably playbills in public places, or information in the local court newspaper, the Wiener Zeitung.3 In 1900, news about musical culture moved around widely – and with speed – like never before; the telegraph and, increasingly, the telephone were becoming staples of commercial life; and more extensive rail and steamship travel networks facilitated mobility. Besides these transformations, the packaging and the advertising of musical goods were ever more striking visually, thanks to advances in printing and photographic reproduction, and to growing awareness of consumer behaviour. Of course, more than a century further on, and to a generation that has grown up with instant global communication and subtle mechanisms for advertising, the sort of infrastructure that Paderewski benefitted from can seem outmoded, even crude. Yet the beginnings of the mass marketing and international dissemination of music that we recognize today in our own media-driven, computer-led culture can also be identified in that world of 1900. Historical continuities are sometimes as striking as differences. Perhaps with such connections in mind, scholars in musicology and other disciplines have found music’s commodification an attractive area of enquiry, especially with regard to the development of popular music and recorded-sound technology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The studies of Tin Pan Alley, cabaret culture, folk and popular music, mechanical pianos, and the nascent recording industry in the United States and Europe by Charles Hamm, Daniel Goldmark, Derek B. Scott, Steven Whiting, Karl Hagstrom Miller, Timothy D. Taylor and James J. Nott are cases in point, as is cultural historian David Suisman’s book Selling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music (2009) – an important treatment of the American music industry in the early twentieth century.4 Embracing the commerce of popular song, player pianos 3 On the local press, see Mary Sue Morrow, Concert Life in Haydn’s Vienna: Aspects of a Developing Musical and Social Institution (Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon, 1989), pp. 191–9.

Admittedly several important market-focused histories of art music’s institutions, agents, instrument manufacture, and music publishing have appeared over the last thirty years;6 and there have been studies of art-music performers who fit the paradigm of the mass-market artist, such as Jenny Lind – whose tour of the United States was engineered with unprecedented commercial acuity by the businessman P. T. Barnum – and Enrico Caruso and Amelita GalliCurci, stars of the early recording era.7 But for a long time, the general idea that commercialization impacts works of art negatively held considerable sway, likely stemming from the trenchant remarks on the subject made by Theodor Adorno and Carl Dahlhaus and expressing their underlying assumptions that music written for sale to large markets (i.e. popular music) could not be of high artistic quality.8 In such a context, art music and money seem to have become Age of Jim Crow (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2010); Timothy D.

The\n\nIdea of Art.indb 3\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n4\n\nChristina Bashford\n\nuncomfortable bedfellows, as evinced by the frequent avoidance of any serious treatment of economic dimensions in studies of creativity,9 or by the sidelining or explaining-away of serious, hallowed composers, such as Beethoven, publishing novelty works that made considerable money.10 More recently, musicologists and historians have probed the roots of this negative ideology in studies of nineteenth-century European culture, many of which have illuminated the complexities and contradictions that played out when composers began to write art music for aesthetic ends (‘art for art’s sake’) at the very time that popular music and a new commercialism were arriving on the scene. For instance, David Gramit (one of the authors in the current volume) has shown that even by 1800 German composers were embracing the need to market serious music on the one hand, yet denying that such music had a commercial identity on the other; and Simon McVeigh has documented related findings in the workings of nineteenth-century London concert life, where ‘commercial aspirations were submerged under an artistic veneer’.11 Historian T. C. W. Blanning positions the sacralization of high culture, including art music, in nineteenth-century Europe as a reaction against the emerging commercial sphere that was replacing older patronage systems – up until then the main means for supporting musical activity – and he points up the tension between exclusive high art and mass-market popular culture that the situation created.12 Derek B. Scott’s survey of major nineteenth-century cities as sites of much-cited essay by Walter Benjamin (‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’, 1936) concerning an artwork’s loss of its special ‘aura’ when subject to technological duplication may also have added to ideas of the contaminating effects of commercialism on music. 9 There are some notable exceptions, namely Julia Moore, ‘Mozart in the MarketPlace’, JRMA 114 (1989), 18–42; Moore, ‘Beethoven and Inflation’, Beethoven Forum 1 (1992), 191–223; and John Drysdale, Elgar’s Earnings (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2013). 10 On composers writing for both art and popular music worlds, see Lydia Goehr, The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music (Oxford: Clarendon, 1992), pp. 209–10; and for a nuanced case study, see Anthony Newcomb, ‘Schumann and the Marketplace: From Butterflies to Hausmusik’, Nineteenth-Century Piano Music, ed.

One important article is Thomas Christensen’s 1999 discussion of how the practice of transcribing music that was conceived for concert hall or opera house into four-hand piano-duet transcriptions intended for performance in the home altered the music’s identity and affected the manner of its reception.15 In a more focused study of similar repertoire for the home piano, Catherine Mayes has unravelled the constructed understanding of eastern Europe that was perpetrated in the many dances, variations and other genres with ‘national flavour’ published for the Viennese drawing room, c. 1800, showing them to have been grounded in a homogenous musical style and based on a collective imaginary of eastern European countries, one that emphasized simplicity, artlessness and primitivism.16 A different and productive tack has been to consider musical performance as a commercial good: there are many models one might cite here but two may suffice to indicate range and potential. Leanne Langley’s essay on the building of a new market (audience) for a new product – promenade concerts – in late-nineteenth-century London shows, among many other things, the significance of the incipient era of department-store shopping in the development of a successful and distinctive brand of musical experience.17 And Annegret Fauser, in her study of music at the Paris World’s Fair of 1889, establishes how the stunt of charging people a tiny sum 13 Scott, Sounds of the Metropolis, pp. 3–7. 14 Nicholas Vazsonyi, Richard Wagner: Self-Promotion and the Making of a Brand (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010).

By necessity it discusses the workings of the commerce of music, but it pushes beyond the usual questions of markets and economics that anchor much of the existing scholarship on the history of the music business. Showcasing fresh research into the ways in which art music functioned in tandem with commerce in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe and North America, the contributions explore how the idea of art music – and its associated culture, including performers, institutions and instruments – played out in the modernizing musical marketplace (‘the commercial world’ of this book’s title). The authors thus offer a series of insights into how art music was portrayed and perceived in commercially oriented locations during the era before recorded sound became widely available, often indicating how particular ideas about art music were affected by commercial concerns; they also explore some of the diverse ideas and values that became attached to that music in the process, sometimes unearthing tensions, inconsistencies and fears along the way, particularly regarding how the discrete cultures of commerce and art were intersecting. Unusual topics and nuanced explorations of established subject matter are further features of the book, which aims to challenge some of the reductive explanations of music’s life and identity as a commercial good, explanations that persist in the topic’s historiography. Complexities are indeed ripe for study for, as Suisman points out in Selling Sounds, there are many questions about music’s commodification that need answering, not least because commodification ‘is a social and political process, populated by human actors, and one that includes various dimensions and phases’.19 Much of Suisman’s study is concerned with the recording industry, a point worth making because once technology ushered in the possibility of capturing musical sound – and star performers – on player piano and (later) wax cylinder, the nature of what a musical commodity was, or could be, changed dramatically, and it became possible to ‘fix’ music in time and to experience it repeatedly. In most of the scenarios and for most of the characters described in The Idea of Art Music in a Commercial World, 1800–1930, such possibilities were unimagined, or at best in their infancy. To those people, musical sound was inherently transient (unlike most other commercial goods), and music’s principal commodified forms were printed music (the most concrete ‘trace’ of a musical work, as packaged for sale by publishers), or concert or staged live performances for which admission was charged. But there were additional objects and social experiences for sale to help people connect with musical experience or to participate in its creation themselves:\n\n18 Annegret Fauser, Musical Encounters at the 1889 Paris World’s Fair (Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press, 2005), pp. 279–97. 19 Suisman, Selling Sounds, p. 9.\n\nIdea of Art.indb 6\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nmusical magazines, newspapers, books, instruments, lessons, subscriptions to amateur choirs or bands, and so on. Many of these goods, as well as the mechanics of their promotion and advertising, are under discussion in the thirteen essays in this book. A repeated theme is administrative and artistic agency, with many authors highlighting the concepts and practices arising from the interactions – of people, venues, institutions, businesses and networks – that occurred when musical goods were pushed for sale. This book does not attempt to create a comprehensive history of the complexities of art music’s relationship with commerce, which is in its infancy as a research topic and is not developed to an equal extent for all countries that fall under the book’s umbrella. Rather, it takes a step in a new direction, by presenting case studies of contrasting topics that vary by time and place, yet overlap in terms of themes and ideas in significant ways, in the hope of encouraging broader dialogue and further scholarship. Our historical scope is a long nineteenth century, covering the period from 1800 into the 1930s. This is not to suggest that musical commerce itself was new in the period – far from it. The circulation of identical copies of music, for instance, dates back to the Renaissance and gained much momentum in the 1500s after the breakthroughs in printing music from moveable type; there was further growth in the music-publishing industry from around 1700. But, as we have seen, new trends were emerging in the early nineteenth century, affecting both how music was perceived aesthetically and how it interacted with a modernizing commercial world. This book’s essays reflect the gathering momentum and internationalism in commercial musical life, in a cluster of contributions that deal with the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. At either end of the historical continuum sit essays that signal pasts and futures in the commerce that attached to art music. The essay by Jeffrey S. Sposato, which considers overlaps between church music and concert repertoire in Leipzig, serves to acknowledge that many of the precedents for commercially driven concert life had been ground out across Europe in the eighteenth century, during which period sacred music was already establishing an identity beyond the spiritual realm. The essay by Catherine Hennessy Wolter, which draws out the subtle messaging that can be detected in American magazine advertising of mechanical player pianos, is emblematic of the era of commercially available sound recording and of modern media techniques that was starting to dawn. Geographically, the essays include both studies of national cultures (Britain, United States, France, Italy) and focused treatments of specific urban centres and adjacent regions (London, Paris, Leipzig, Edmonton). The growth of international markets and the ways in which musical commerce moved across national boundaries are also addressed. Readers may observe a focus on Britain, especially London, which reflects both the size and historical importance of its ‘free’, unrestricted market for musical performances during the nineteenth century, and the current state of research, for many scholars have been working in this area for several years.20 At the same time, the present volume helps contextualize 20 For instance, Simon McVeigh and Cyril Ehrlich, ‘The Modernisation of London Concert Life around 1900’, The Business of Music, ed. Michael Talbot (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2002), pp. 96–120. Much of the scholarship that\n\nIdea of Art.indb 7\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n8\n\nChristina Bashford\n\nthe overstated view of nineteenth-century Britain’s musical culture as exclusively commercial – lacking the extensive state, civic or private subvention that could be found across the Channel – and thus an anomaly in European music history. Some of the essays reveal the workings of the marketplace in Europe (a topic often sidelined by scholars emphasizing government or civic subvention), and also in North America: in the United States, at least, market economics acquired a similar centrality in musical life to how things worked in Britain, although with some notable differences, a few of which are teased out in passing by some contributors. The term ‘art music’, as reflected in the volume’s title, is the jumping-off point for the essay topics. However, that very category – as it plays out in the culturalhistorical context – was not always firm, and the definitions of art music that our authors embrace are necessarily loose. Such flexibility is all to the good, for it allows historical intersections between musical styles, genres and cultures to come into view. So, as much as this volume acknowledges the shift in earlynineteenth-century aesthetics that brought many composers to see themselves as writing ‘serious’ music for the sake of art, and not for commercial ends or worldly function, a couple of the essays consider repertoires of sacred music that were originally conceived for functional ends, albeit for the ‘higher’ purpose of religion. In many instances, this music aspired to the learnedness or erudition that the term ‘art music’ invokes (and Sposato’s essay demonstrates how several such sacred works became melded with art music in the commercial sphere); though, equally, it might strike a populist tone while maintaining appeal as elevating art (as David Wright’s essay on John Stainer’s sacred output shows). In addition, although the volume acknowledges that a perceived dichotomy between an autonomous ‘art music’ and a commercially driven ‘popular music’ started to emerge in the nineteenth century, it insists on the importance of the marketplace for the composition and consumption of art music. (In this respect, the developing national laws of copyright and performing rights for music publication and performance during this period have symbolic significance.) Moreover, the volume recognizes that boundaries between the cultures of art music and popular music were ultimately blurred, creating zones of crossover and interaction that several authors have found productive to interrogate. The essays by George Biddlecombe, Denise Gallo and Jann Pasler discuss works that were written or adapted for use in the domestic parlour: these include ballads, celebrated arias associated with opera singers, and piano transcriptions of waltzes, polkas or military marches. Rather than ‘art music’, such repertoire might equally be designated today as ‘light’ or ‘middlebrow’, or categorized as ‘Hausmusik’ or salon music, to account for its ‘easier’ (less learned) style or the large-scale commercial success it engendered; and it is a measure of the slipperiness of the topic that in the hands of other scholars these works might be discussed in a\n\nhas emerged in relation to the consumption of art music in London has been influenced by Ehrlich’s work, which gathered acceptance from the late 1980s (see his ‘Market Themes’, JRMA 114 [1989], 1–5, and the preface to Music and British Culture, pp. v–viii).\n\nIdea of Art.indb 8\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nstudy of nineteenth-century popular music.21 Some of the contributors suggest that, at least historically, both the providers of musical products and their consumers often viewed genres and styles on much more of a continuum. As noted above, several of the contributors to The Idea of Art Music in a Commercial World, 1800–1930 deal with the culture of art music as opposed to artworks per se, but it is worth reiterating that the book’s overall concern is with the idea of art music and its culture in commercial settings, be that the idea of a specific work, group of works or broader repertoires; of art music in general; of a composer, conductor or singer; or of a musical instrument. To this end, the essays consider not only how commercial culture around music was manifest (e.g. through the development of markets, advertising techniques and strategies, and through consumer activities, especially amateur music-making), but they also probe the ways it intersected with other cultural values and ideologies – aesthetic, social, moral, ideological, political or personal – since selling the idea of art music often amounted to selling something other than the commodity tout court. The essays demonstrate entanglements with civic identity, national identity, an imagined (or reimagined) past, modernity, home and family, the feminine, and moral character, to name a few. The historiographical and theoretical approaches that the contributors have adopted for their research and interpretation are diverse, extending beyond traditional musicological frameworks. Some authors take their bearings from histories of print, advertising and marketing, while others invoke or adapt concepts from cultural history, art history, sociology, semiotics and cognate disciplines. Unsurprisingly given the overall topic, the use of art music to define taste and social class – and the theories of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu – surfaces several times. In the first group of essays, authors focus their investigations on the publishing industry. Denise Gallo (‘Selling “Celebrity”: The Role of the Dedication in Marketing Piano Arrangements of Rossini’s Military Marches’) examines how European music publishers in the 1830s and 1850s packaged two- and four-hand piano arrangements of military marches originally composed by Rossini, using new titles as well as dedications (some new) to men and women with significant public roles or reputations. She describes the complex processes by which the pieces made their way into the domestic sphere, arguing that such celebrity repackaging made the marches into desirable and money-making commodities. (Rossini, who by this point had ceased to produce new operas, had little interest in the initiative, but for the firms in question it was a useful way of keeping the composer’s name before the public and making sales.) Gallo’s analysis demonstrates how the idea of celebrity was leveraged to enhance marketability. She shows how the publishers used striking, carefully designed sheet-music covers to foreground the dedicatees – Charlotte de Rothschild, the Duc d’Orléans and his bride, and the Sultan Abdul-Medjid – and thus entice would-be consumers to buy the marches. It was a savvy ploy, since once purchased and prominently placed on the parlour piano, the marches could endow a household 21 Scott, Sounds of the Metropolis, for example, includes as one of his case studies the Viennese waltz, particularly the music of Johann Strauss sr and jr.\n\nIdea of Art.indb 9\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n10\n\nChristina Bashford\n\nwith fashionability by association or indicate their owners’ awareness of current affairs. Michela Ronzani’s ‘Creating Success and Forming Imaginaries: The Innovative Publicity Campaign for Puccini’s La bohème’ also deals with an Italian opera composer, albeit one who was active much later in the century. Her study puts the spotlight on the publicity created for the inaugural production of Puccini’s La bohème, exploring a large-scale operation that was carefully orchestrated by the composer’s publisher, Ricordi. Taking full advantage of new techniques from the emerging advertising industry, and having established its own Poster Design and Printing Department, Ricordi ensured that the opera was publicized in a unified, highly visual manner. Posters, postcards and sheet-music covers, as well as magazines, envelope seals and even porcelain plates and bowls, all carried similar graphic art, stemming from the drawings for the opera’s costumes and sets that their designer, Adolf Hohenstein, had created, and which – because the images were reprinted for many years – rammed the idea of the opera into Italians’ consciousness. Ronzani argues that Ricordi’s marketing initiative was significant in the eventual construction of Puccini as a cultural icon. And yet, as she explains, in the late 1890s, Ricordi’s campaign spawned criticism; many commentators had difficulties reconciling the use of blatant commercialism with the dignified art form of Italian opera and felt that the genre was being sullied in the process. This litany would become a familiar theme in the modernizing world. The agency of music publishers comes under yet more scrutiny from David Wright, whose contribution, ‘Novello, John Stainer and Commercial Opportunities in the Nineteenth-Century British Amateur Music Market’, considers how the firm of Novello shaped compositional output in Britain – especially sacred repertoire – during the nineteenth century. Aware of the potential for commercial success that Britain’s amateur singing culture presented, and able to craft market-savvy contracts with composers, Novello made low-cost vocal scores for amateur choirs, Anglican churches, and schools the backbone of its catalogue. This music generated extraordinarily large sales (larger, Wright suggests, than has ever been appreciated), and British composers, always dependent on market economics, responded accordingly, writing sacred choral music in seeming perpetuity. The author focuses on John Stainer, one such composer, whose rights and royalty payments from Novello brought him considerable wealth. His cantata The Crucifixion, a knock-out ‘hit’ with the amateur market, demonstrates his ability to craft satisfying, even uplifting, ‘middlebrow’ religious music that sold well over decades. Wright shows that for British composers who were published by Novello, there were not only considerable financial gains to be had from supplying the choral domain with sacred music, but there was also a disincentive to write large-scale symphonic works. In sum, the idea of writing art music was often tempered by the commercial realities of a publishing house that pushed composers towards supplying the sacred-music market. A second group of essays treats personalities, both the universally known and the less familiar: Jenny Lind (George Biddlecombe), Richard Wagner (Nicholas Vazsonyi), and Julius Benedict and Frederic Cowen (Fiona Palmer). The role of\n\nIdea of Art.indb 10\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nimagery in promoting an idealized notion of Jenny Lind in Britain and the United States is a significant focus in Biddlecombe’s chapter, ‘Jenny Lind, Illustration, Song and the Relationship between Prima Donna and Public’. What interests him is how constructions of Lind’s persona in sheet music and other material commodities ran counter to cultural associations of prima donnas with women of dubious lifestyles and questionable character. By analysing images of Lind on the sheet-music covers of ballads that she sang publicly, Biddlecombe demonstrates that most of the illustrations were based on two paintings of her that signal femininity, innocence and physical attractiveness. Some of the covers, along with commercially available prints of Lind, also enhanced her body and facial features to create an aura of beauty and unimpeachable morality. Biddlecombe argues that, since sheet music was mostly intended for the middle-class domestic sphere and likely purchased, played and sung by young, often unmarried, women (for whom music-making was an important part of courtship), the Lind products were targeted at this group, in the hope of encouraging consumers to identify with the soprano and even to believe that a famous female singer was endorsing their own domestic space. Moreover, he explores the qualities that attached to the English-language ballads Lind sang in concerts in both Britain and the United States, arguing that this repertoire connoted modesty, domesticity, emotional restraint, and even national character and political values. Her performance of the repertoire created, he suggests, an ideology that further revealed the singer’s ‘internal self ’ and complemented the idea of Lind that was circulating in printed imagery. In ‘A German in Paris: Richard Wagner and the Masking of Commodification’, Nicholas Vazsonyi delves into the deep-rooted contradictions in Richard Wagner’s positioning of himself and his music in the growing commercial environment of mid-nineteenth-century Paris. The backdrop for Vazsonyi’s analysis is both the distinction between lofty art music and the tawdry commercial world (a concept that was already embedded in German thought), and the paradox of Wagner’s insistence on the purity of his music as works of art on the one hand and his denial of his reliance on the marketplace on the other. Vazonsyi’s discussion, like Wright’s, puts significant emphasis on how commerce affected composers, and it takes a critical look at Wagner’s manipulation of the print media and his anti-French (often anti-Semitic) rhetoric, which exploited the idea of the impoverished, morally superior German composer in a moneydriven, artistically moribund French capital. Vazsonyi focuses on two serialized novellas by Wagner that feature penniless German musicians in Paris (‘Une visite à Beethoven’ and ‘Un musicien étranger à Paris’), and he posits that they strongly suggest Wagner was self-identifying with the protagonists while masking the reality of the situation, namely his commitment to finding commercial success with his operas there. Vazsonyi traces continuities in this ‘masking’ rhetoric into the 1880s, a period when Wagner inveighed against the increasingly mass audience for music in the commercial world; at the same time, the composer was cannily manipulating markets in his creation of an exclusive aura around his last opera, Parsifal. Fiona Palmer (‘Conductors and Self-Promotion in the British NineteenthCentury Marketplace’) also studies conscious manipulation of self-image, here\n\nIdea of Art.indb 11\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n12\n\nChristina Bashford\n\nin relation to two conductors in Britain, and at a time when the notion of the conductor as a leadership figure endowed with celebrity was only just emerging. Her subjects, Julius Benedict and Frederic Cowen, were no Linds or Wagners. They led what she dubs ‘portfolio’ careers, mixing orchestral conducting with other activities in a marketplace that still set greater store by European-born musicians than it did by native British ones. Each man learned to promote his own value and individuality, emphasizing, with varying degrees of success, a different set of attributes. These included international connections, service to Empire, championship of British music, association with the social elite, and alignment with the pantheon of ‘great’ (European) composers of the immediate past. Palmer compares and contrasts the two careers, demonstrating how each man constructed a professional image – and an idea of himself as a British conductor – through commercial outlets. She shows that writing and publishing, as well as concert programming, interviews with journalists, and posed photographs, proved vital tools – as did a more subtle management of the press, the use of the power of association, and the manipulation of social connections. Of the two men, Cowen (who was the younger) appears to have had greater agency in the process of reputation-building; he also took an outspoken position on the marketplace’s discrimination against native conductors and called for high artistic standards on the podium, perhaps contributing to eventual shifts in thinking in British culture about its own conductors. Two essays focus on cultural constructions of musical instruments in the commercial world. Catherine Hennessy Wolter’s ‘“ What the Piano[la] Means to the Home”: Advertising of Conventional and Player Pianos in the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies’ Home Journal, 1914–17’ addresses the connotations of the player piano in American advertising – an important topic in the literature on music and commodity – and offers fresh interpretations and a nuanced understanding of the instrument’s commercial identity. Her analysis zeroes in on the mid 1910s, when the player piano was finding its place in the market and its technology was still in flux, and she sets the instrument beside the conventional piano, which was still being widely purchased and used, though clearly entering a period of change in regard to its cultural position. The nature and placement of a wide variety of highly visual ads from two mass-circulating periodicals with complementary profiles, the Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies’ Home Journal, are at the heart of Wolter’s work, and she untangles a tight, sometimes contradictory, knot of ideas in her sources around piano ownership, gender, class and family, through her close observation of the ads’ iconography for both types of instrument. Selling the modernity of the player piano or the value of the conventional piano as furniture are among several ideas that the ads reference. Wolter further shows how ads accentuate ways in which player-piano operators could make an active contribution to the music that the instrument emitted (through levers, pedals etc.) to imply that this was no mere machine, but had expressive and artistic potential and could give the consumer agency in his or her experience of music. At root, the varied ideas of the player piano and the conventional piano that she uncovers in this newspaper advertising seem linked to changing concepts of music-making in American life in the 1910s. In ‘Art, Commerce and Artisanship: Violin Culture in Britain, c. 1880–1920’,\n\nIdea of Art.indb 12\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nChristina Bashford looks at a less-studied area: the development of a craze for playing instruments of the violin family in late-nineteenth-century Britain and its intersections with the commercial sphere. She shows that from the outset, the industrialization of supply and the availability of inexpensive ‘factory fiddles’ fuelled the phenomenon, bringing the instrument into the reach of many new socio-demographic groups, including working-class adults and schoolchildren. Meanwhile, a web of products and commercially driven activities emerged, including violin magazines with advertising potential, and they established a strong infrastructure for violin-playing. This in turn whipped up demand among middle-class women, for whom the long-seated cultural taboos (some psychosexual) that had barred them from playing the instrument were now crumbling. The principal issue underpinning Bashford’s study is the paradox of the popularity of an ‘organic’ instrument made of wood and (traditionally at least) constructed by hand in an era that celebrated instruments that were associated with industrial manufacture, technological advances and the modernizing world. She notes that commerce sometimes cannily masked the debt to the machine age when promoting factory-produced violins. Moreover, she argues that an intertwining cultural ideology that linked the instrument with a lost artisan past (itself established by many scholars as a tenet of Englishness) was a strong driver for the craze and was exploited in advertising, thus perpetrating a particular, almost nostalgic, idea of the violin. A further two essays treat repertoires in specific contexts. Jon Solomon’s ‘Read All About It! Ancient Greek Music Hits American Newspapers, 1875–1938’, on the emergence and commercialization of ‘ancient Greek music’ in the United States, places emphasis on the role of the newspaper press, both nationally and locally, in creating and stoking market demand for a new repertoire. An interest in what the music of the Greeks might have amounted to was fuelled initially by the findings of scholars, and it led to some contemporary composers writing incidental music for Greek tragedies that was informed by a sense of history, and thence to performances of those plays (some of them commercial productions). These in turn gained considerable attention from the press, which Solomon documents. In addition, news of recovered fragments of notation circulated in newspapers, and some of the music was even transcribed and marketed. The discovered ‘Hymn to Apollo’, for example, was published in book form in 1894, and recordings of it by Victor were sold from 1912, including as part of a home-study course (‘educational commerce’ is the term that Solomon uses for this corner of the marketplace). The broader context for these developments was growing international interest in ancient Greek culture, which enabled those with commercial acumen in the United States to capitalize on the craze, aiding the process of popularization and demonstrating that many American consumers with musical interests were willing to buy into the idea of antiquity. In ‘Selling a “False Verdi” in Victorian London’, Roberta Montemorra Marvin unravels the complex interaction of aesthetic ideas and commercial forces in the London operatic marketplace. She demonstrates that, for Verdi’s operas, spin-off products (among them ‘Englished’ operatic excerpts published as sheet music, and comic adaptations of works in English translation staged in venues beyond the opera house – both features prominent in the 1840s and 1850s) and critical\n\nIdea of Art.indb 13\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n14\n\nChristina Bashford\n\ncommentary (newspaper previews of works not yet heard and reviews of actual performances) educated the English public about the composer’s output, creating expectations of what a new work by Verdi ‘should be’. Her essay explores how those expectations both shaped and were shaped by critical opinion, and how they affected notions of marketability and actual market demand for Don Carlos (in 1867) and Aida (in 1876) – operas in different styles from Verdi’s previous works. Marvin argues that in the case of Don Carlos, Verdi’s French grand opera, which transferred from Paris within a matter of weeks of its world premiere (to be performed in Italian translation), there was not only little time for audiences to become adequately prepared for the work, but also the press pushed the idea that the work was problematic. With Aida, however, there was ample time for audience demand to be stoked by journalists, who reiterated the opera’s success abroad and its distinctive qualities (including its Egyptian-ness) while acknowledging the music’s modern (German) flavour. In revealing much about the English reception of Italian opera as exemplified by Verdi’s works, Marvin unmasks important complexities in the relationship between ideas about the art form of Italian opera and its commercial aspects in Victorian London. The final three essays in the volume all treat interrelationships of musical activities, cultural ideas and commercial concerns in specific settings. Jeffrey S. Sposato (‘Schicht, Hauptmann, Mendelssohn and the Consumption of Sacred Music in Leipzig’) provides a surprising twist to the collection by revealing the shifting interactions in early-nineteenth-century Leipzig between the city’s commercial concert institutions and its churches. After a long period (beginning in the 1700s) when sacred music, such as motets, masses and cantatas, strongly infiltrated concert programming, the church began including in its services some of the sacred works chosen for the concert hall, in a bid to attract the archetypal art-music consumer into the church (attendance was dwindling). Sposato shows that close ties between the Gewandhaus Concerts and some Leipzig churches were significant factors in this cultural exchange, as was the agency of individuals who were involved professionally in both domains – most notably, Johann Gottfried Schicht, Felix Mendelssohn and Moritz Hauptmann. In an era of increasing secularization, Schicht, as Thomaskantor, successfully used the tested techniques of the commercial world (press announcements of the music for forthcoming services; long works ‘serialized’ over a number of weeks; and the programming of music known to be popular in concerts) in his endeavours to increase church attendance. Hauptmann, in the same job in the 1830s and 1840s, imitated the sophisticated repertoire choices and programming formats favoured by Mendelssohn, the Gewandhaus director (who had been instrumental in Hauptmann’s appointment). Sposato explores not only how the church became influenced by the way the commercial world worked for art music, but also how the sacred and the secular spheres became closely intertwined. Civic culture is the focus of David Gramit’s ‘The Business of Music on the Peripheries of Empire: A Turn-of-the-Century Case Study’ too, though here the setting is Edmonton in Canada during the period from the 1890s into the 1920s. Gramit’s interest is in how music was used in the building of ‘settler colonial cities’, where life was strongly tied to the commercial and where culture was a powerful tool for asserting modernity. Piecing together the workings and diversity\n\nIdea of Art.indb 14\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nof Edmonton’s growing musical culture, he shows how the dynamics of boom and bust affected not only the music retail business but also the provision of art music and professional musicians, noting that with greater material prosperity in the early twentieth century came a growth in both the demand for ‘high-class music’ and its supply. These trends are contextualized against the city’s use of art music to symbolize its new identity as a sophisticated metropolis, as opposed to its previous life as a frontier trading town. Gramit offers thoughts on how the idea of art music was framed in this environment, emphasizing less any polarization with popular traditions and more the use of both art and popular musics as symbols of ‘metropolitan legitimacy’. As part of this legitimization, the older music of the local indigenous culture was deliberately distanced, he says. In addition, he argues that, as much as musical culture contributed to Edmonton’s economic growth, it could also be presented as a corrective to the mercantile and as a civilizing influence on the population. Yet, although settler cities were playing a significant role in building nations and empire, in Britain there was little willingness to recognize that fact; instead, there was a tendency within the musical press to insist on Edmonton’s peripheral and inconsequential cultural status. In a similarly wide-ranging discussion, Jann Pasler (‘“Disguised Publicity” and the Performativity of Taste: Musical Scores in French Magazines and Newspapers of the Belle Époque’) unearths an array of commercial and cultural meanings that were signalled by the phenomenon of publishing music in French newspapers and magazines from the 1870s into the 1920s. She shows that the issuing of pieces that could be played on the home piano was not only a keen marketing strategy for music publishers who were eager to generate future sales and stoke demand, but also a form of ‘disguised publicity’ for other stakeholders in the music business, such as theatres, concert societies, composers and performers, whose current activities were often referenced in the newsprint that accompanied the musical notation. Moreover, the practice itself, Pasler argues, played a role in the ‘production and circulation of taste’, and she goes on to show the astonishing range and amount of music – from ‘highbrow’ grand opera to popular song – that was regularly issued in newspapers that, taken together, served a broad crosssection of society. What emerges is a remarkable fluidity of musical genres and styles circulating across class boundaries: art music was issued in the populist press and popular song appeared in elite newspapers. These findings challenge existing assumptions about the alignment of class and taste in France. Pasler also discusses in depth Le Figaro’s patterns of music provision, suggesting that particular score selections – aided by visual layout on the page – referenced French politics, current affairs, intellectual fashions, national identity, foreign cultures and more. She goes on to suggest that readers were equally being led to a new understanding of contemporary French art music, including its expanded tonalities, its use of dances from the Ancien Régime, and the significance of works by women composers.\n\nA\n\nbook of this size and scope could never adequately address every country, musical genre or topic that the subject matter suggests.

Whatever gaps may be identified in the present collection, its range of topics and approaches lays groundwork for future investigations into this area of study. By providing a fresh understanding of how the very idea of art music and its culture was forged and renewed in an evolving commercial world, the volume aims to precipitate a broader and sophisticated discussion in musicology about the nature of the commercializing world’s impact on music in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As we open up the field in this way, we may even begin to lay to rest those residual, but powerful, taboos around the discussion of art music and money.\n\nIdea of Art.indb 16\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nPart I Publishers\n\nIdea of Art.indb 17\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n1 Selling ‘Celebrity’: The Role of the Dedication in Marketing Piano Arrangements of Rossini’s Military Marches Denise Gallo\n\nB\n\ny the mid nineteenth century, every European household that could boast knowledge of culture owned a piano. Purposefully placed in the salons and parlours that were sites of ritual evening musicales, these instruments created an artistic environment that Thomas Christensen has described as ‘bourgeois banality’.1 Dedicated domestic dilettantes and their audiences quickly wearied of repeated repertoire, whether solo renditions or four-hand duets, and created a classic case of economic ‘demand’. Music publishers were only too willing to comply, generating a stream of sheet music for piano in much the same way that internet music services in the early twenty-first century inundate their markets with downloads. At the centre of a network that included composers at one end of the production process and shop owners at the other, publishers explored approaches to increase their catalogue offerings and to promote sales. The surest strategy was to feature music that consumers had actually heard, or at the very least that they had heard of. Some of the most popular piano arrangements were excerpts from famous symphonic works and, pandering to the public’s desire to be au courant, from the latest operas. Advertisements in sales catalogues and editorial puffery in publisher-owned journals heralded these new pieces, often by composers of international repute but also by well-known (but now-forgotten) local and regional personalities. Publishers also resorted to less transparent measures that extended beyond an appeal to their customers’ musical taste and acumen. As businessmen, they acknowledged that sheet music was a ‘product’ that required ‘packaging’, so effort went into its design, particularly of the first page that would attract a buyer – the cover. Some frontispieces bore engravings, often as elaborate or colourful\n\nSincere thanks to Prof. Charles Brauner, Prof. James Parsons, Patricia B.

Beyond visual elements, sheetmusic covers might also display something with powerful subliminal appeal: a ‘celebrity’ dedication. Appearing within or near the title, such declarations either stated outright or at least implied that the very music that customers held in their hands had been written expressly for a noble or person of elevated social status; possessing a copy was proof that its owner was among the cognoscenti. In essence, whether a piece had musical merit or not, its dedication triggered elitism, affording Christensen’s bourgeois a link to a social class to which they could otherwise only aspire.4 Consumers who brought home ‘celebrity’ to display on their pianos made as much of a statement about their awareness of who or what was à la mode as about their ability to perform the piece itself. The sales strategy of placing notable names on sheet-music covers perfectly illustrates how music publishers marketed piano arrangements of what were then (and still are) Gioachino Rossini’s least familiar works: his military marches. Originally composed as gifts for nobles for exclusive use by their court military bands, the marches later came into the hands of publishers who had them transcribed into two- and four-hand piano arrangements. In all but one case, the compositions were stripped of their original dedications and retitled with others that spotlighted personalities whose names resonated with the broader public. For his part, Rossini appears to have shown little interest in this activity. Nevertheless, the rationale behind his publishers’ eagerness to market these arrangements can be intuited easily. After the success of Guillaume Tell in 1829, rumours flew that Rossini had abandoned not only the stage but also his creative life as a composer, a myth that survived well into the twentieth century. If there were to be no more operas from which publishers could cull selections for sheet music, offering any ‘new’ Rossini music was good business. Even though Rossini’s name had been associated with march selections from his stage works, the public would not have known of these pieces for military bands, all of which had been 2 A celebrity performer’s image or name was often a selling point for vocal selections, but that does not seem to have been the case for piano music. 3 Christensen (‘Four-Hand Piano Transcription’, pp. 276–9) mentions this seamless flux between the worlds of art and music. 4 Hans Lenneberg has described a growing number of lower middle- and workingclass customers for music shops as well as for sheet music lending libraries, but Anita Breckbill and Carole Goebes’s more recent work speaks against this class shift. In France, for example, a lending library subscription, or abonnement de musique, cost more than the average working-class annual salary. See Lenneberg’s ‘Music Publishing and Dissemination in the Early Nineteenth Century: Some Vignettes’, Journal of Musicology 2 (1983), 174–83, at p. 182, and Breckbill and Goebes’s ‘Music Circulating Libraries in France: An Overview and a Preliminary List’, Notes, second series, 63 (2007), 761–97, at p. 782. The label on the cover of the Sultan’s March in Figure 1.1 (p. 35 below) indicates that this sheet music was part of W. C. de Vletter’s music lending library in Rotterdam.\n\nIdea of Art.indb 19\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n20\n\nDenise Gallo\n\ncomposed as private gifts. So publishers took advantage of marketing them as piano sheet music to fill what was perceived as a gap. By creating an illusion of activity, publishers could keep the composer’s name before the buying public and, by extension, maintain interest in Rossini arrangements already in their sales catalogues. The simple addition of a ‘celebrity’ dedication to this ‘new’ sheet music lured customers even more. Of course, Rossini did continue to compose after Tell, working – albeit sporadically and never producing another opera – up to 1868, the year of his death, and the four marches discussed below come from this period.5 Since they are virtually unknown today outside of the arena of marching-band music, a brief outline of the composer’s life helps to frame their narrative. During the 1830s, Rossini spent most of his time travelling between France and Italy, enjoying the fame garnered from his operas, many of which were still produced on stages throughout Europe. In 1837, he decided to settle in Bologna, the city that had nurtured him musically as a student. It was here in this political hotbed, however, that his life took a decidedly difficult turn. He soon found himself at the middle of the city’s Risorgimento machinations. His attempts to appear cordial to both radicals and conservatives failed, and he quickly became a political lightning rod, claimed (and conversely attacked) by both sides. As fears for his personal safety redoubled, his health, already aggravated by ongoing symptoms arising from gonorrhoea, continued to deteriorate. Despite fleeing to Florence and trying a series of fruitless spa cures, he continued to plummet into severe physical decline and depression. Only after returning to France in 1855 did he improve. It is through this biographical filter that one must consider the piano arrangements of the military marches, all of which were published between 1836 and 1854. At his lowest ebb physically and psychologically, Rossini appears to have shown no interest in his publishers’ efforts to make these rather ordinary pieces into extraordinary commercial successes.\n\n5 This article deals with marches published before Rossini’s death, hence it does not include La corona d’Italia, sent to King Vittorio Emanuele II in recognition of his having named the composer a Grand Knight in the Order of the Crown of Italy (La corona d’Italia) in 1868. Nor does it include the Fanfare modelled on La corona sent to Emperor Maximilian of Mexico three years earlier.

In its earliest form, military ‘music’ meant trumpets and bugles signalling charges and retreats, and drums setting the pace for marches and attacks.6 With the inception of national standing armies in the seventeenth century, military musicians were assimilated into regiments and trained to play on the march, becoming the crucial units that kept regular troops in step on parade grounds and battlefields.7 Unlike orchestras that employed specific numbers of musicians for each section, military bands were forced to rely on those who agreed to enlist.8 Thus when Rossini and others offered such hommages to noble dedicatees, they created scores for generic ensembles of portable winds, brass and percussion. It then fell to the bandmaster, generally the first clarinettist, to tailor parts for the specific instruments available to him. Composers like Rossini were used to working in this fashion whenever they included stage bands in their operas, since these band parts generally were played by military musicians on loan to theatre orchestras.9 The term ‘march’ – Marsch, marche or marcia – mimicked the action it described, but specific types of marches took their names from the tempos at 6 Ludwig van Beethoven demonstrated the use of instruments in battle in ‘Wellington’s Victory’ (op. 91, 1813). Using drum cadences and national melodies to introduce the arrival of French and British troops, the work celebrates the Duke of Wellington’s triumph at the Battle of Victoria on 2 June 1813. Many military music histories offer full treatments of musicians on the battlefield. Military music histories include Henry George Farmer, The Rise & Development of Military Music (London: William Reeves, 1912), and David Whitwell, The Nineteenth-Century Wind Band and Wind Ensembles in Western Europe, The History and Literature of the Wind Band and Wind Ensemble 5, 2nd edn (Austin, TX: Whitwell Publishing, 2012). 7 On the importance of rhythm in marches, see August Kalkbrenner, ‘Über Marschmusik im allgemeinen und auf dem Paradefelde im besondern’, reprinted from Militär-Wochenblatt (1884) in Musikalische Studien und Skizzen: Gesammelte ausgewählte Aufsätze über militärmusikalische und allgemeine fachwissenschaftliche Themas (Berlin: Arthur Parrhysius, 1908), pp. 81–7, at p. 81. 8 Military ensembles varied radically in size, often totalling as few as fourteen or sixteen men, the average size of the first violin section in a contemporary orchestra. 9 See the letter dated 12 January 1819 from the (unidentified) Lieutenant General of regimental bands to Giovanni Carafa, Superintendent of Naples’s theatres, writing about a collaboration with Rossini at the Teatro San Carlo, in Lettere e documenti / Gioachino Rossini, ed. Bruno Cagli and Sergio Ragni, 2 vols (Pesaro: Fondazione Rossini, 1992), vol. 1, p. 352. Rossini used military musicians both in the orchestra pit and as stage bands in Semiramide, Maometto II and Le siège de Corinthe. See Philip Gossett, ‘Musicologi e musicisti: Intorno a una rappresentazione di Semiramide’, Italian trans. by Paolo Fabbri, Bollettino del Centro Rossiniano di Studi 32 (1992), 17–31.\n\nIdea of Art.indb 21\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\n22\n\nDenise Gallo\n\nwhich troops were to move when they were played. The grande marche or pas ordinaire, for instance, was a slow, majestic ceremonial piece that maintained a pace of roughly seventy-five steps a minute.10 The most common march, though, amply reflected in the titles of band pieces and compositions inspired by military music, was the pas redoublé or passo doppio, indicating a ‘double time’ gait of 108 to 118 steps per minute. Although amateur pianists may not have understood the tempo significance of these designations, they would have recognized these familiar march terms from sheet-music arrangements. Leipzig publisher Friedrich Hofmeister’s Monatsberichte, a catalogue published from 1829 to 1900 (accessible online since 2004), records some 810 items as ‘marche’ and 172 more as ‘marcia’ . Another twenty-five compositions were specifically marked ‘pas redoublé’ and seventy-nine were labelled ‘grand marche’; among these were twoand four-hand arrangements of the four Rossini marches under consideration. A general search of the Monatsberichte yields some interesting statistics. Of the catalogue’s 330,000 entries, some 145,450 (just under 44%) are arrangements for piano alone or for piano in a variety of vocal and instrumental combinations, demonstrating the remarkable popularity of piano sheet music.11 Included in this number are piano arrangements of Rossini’s music, the majority excerpts from his operas and from the Stabat mater. Yet from the catalogue’s inception in 1829 (the year of Tell’s premiere) to 1868 (the year of the composer’s death), Hofmeister recorded only 131 new piano arrangements of Rossini’s music.12 By comparison, sheet music for piano arranged from works of Rossini’s opera contemporaries Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini totalled 481 and 334, respectively;13 the latter’s total seems especially imposing in contrast to Rossini’s, since Bellini was active professionally for only eight years before his death in 1835.\n\n10 The funeral march was even slower. Rossini used one in the Act II finale of La gazza ladra; other composers who exploited the drama of the funeral march included Beethoven, Berlioz, Liszt and, of course, Chopin. 11 Hofmeister’s Monatsberichte tracked music and music books published primarily (but not exclusively) in German-speaking countries, even though all publishers and all music in that arena do not appear. The music generally was published eight weeks before it appeared in the catalogue. This rich resource is available as a searchable database, Hofmeister XIX (http://www.hofmeister.rhul.ac.uk), maintained by the Department of Music at Royal Holloway, University of London [accessed 14 July 2015]. The number of piano pieces was calculated by doing a ‘free search’ on the mutually exclusive terms ‘piano’, ‘pianoforte’ and ‘pfte’ (http://www. hofmeister.rhul.ac.uk/2008/content/database/search/free_text.html). 12 The database was searched on ‘Rossini’ and the terms ‘pianoforte’, ‘piano’ and ‘pfte’, using ‘and’ but ‘not’ to eliminate duplicate phrases such as ‘Pfte à 4 Mains’. Marches arranged for full band, on the contrary, are classified in the database as ‘musique militaire’ . 13 Similar searches on the terms cited in n. 12 produced 1,141 records for Mozart and 1,078 for Beethoven.\n\nIdea of Art.indb 22\n\n02/02/2016 15:13\n\nThe Role of the Dedication in Marketing Rossini’s Military Marches\n\n23\n\nThe Original Marches and their Dedicatees Rossini had a cordial relationship with Tsar Alexander I, whom he met at the Congress of Verona,14 but had never encountered his brother and successor, Nicolas I. Yet in 1834, the composer sent the latter a set of marches, Trois Marches militaires: a grande marche and two pas redoublés, designating each as ‘Composed and Dedicated / to His Majesty Nicolas I / Emperor of all the Russias’. 15 These scores – the only marches written entirely in the composer’s hand – are bound in one volume in the following order: a grande marche and two pas redoublés (hereafter GM, PR1 and PR2). More intriguing than the gift are the marches’ titles, for each memorialized a victory of Nicolas’s army.16 ‘Passage du Balcan’ (GM) recalled the Russians"
