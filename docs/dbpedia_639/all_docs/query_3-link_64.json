        "text": "Methods\n\nWe conducted a systematic literature review of epidemiological studies on cancer risk published after the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report in 2006 through December 31, 2017. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were epidemiological studies of human populations exposed to low-dose (mean absorbed dose <100 mGy), predominantly low-linear energy transfer radiation. We required individualized dose estimates for the study participants and that the publications provided estimates of a cumulative radiation dose–response association and associated confidence intervals.\n\nFor each eligible study, two reviewers independently reviewed the variables that the authors accounted for in a study. We included design variables (eg, those controlled via restriction) and analytical variables (eg, those controlled via stratification or regression modeling). We also considered those variables that the authors analyzed but were found to have minimal impact on dose response estimates. Where information was available, we summarized the impact of adjustment for the confounder as an assessment of the magnitude of the bias.\n\nNext, we described the major uncontrolled confounders of potential concern in the analysis of associations between radiation and solid cancers and leukemia. Two reviewers independently reviewed the factors that were either described by the authors or are of common concern for the exposure and population setting (eg, occupational, environmental, or medical) as unmeasured variables that were potential confounders of associations between radiation and solid cancers and leukemia in a study. For example, such factors of common concern are routinely adjusted for in studies of the exposed population [e.g., duration of employment in studies of nuclear workers as a means of partially controlling for the healthy worker survivor effect (7)] or have been identified as known human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and are likely to either occur frequently in the population (eg, asbestos exposure) or to be differentially distributed by radiation dose (eg, smoking). We also considered the potential for residual confounding, in which the adjustment method may have incompletely adjusted for the confounder (eg, socioeconomic status [SES] and birth cohort as a means of adjusting for smoking). We noted the potential for selection bias as a result of restriction or conditioning on variables affected by radiation exposure.\n\nWe then reviewed each paper and related studies to collect information on indirect assessment of evidence of confounding by those major uncontrolled (or under-controlled) confounders identified (eg, evaluating radiation dose response for mesothelioma as a way of indirectly assessing whether asbestos exposure was related to dose or analyzing smoking-related and nonsmoking related cancers separately). In addition, we reviewed each manuscript’s Discussion section to collect information on plausibility of substantial confounding by the major uncontrolled confounders identified.\n\nFinally, when studies lacked data on factors that could plausibly confound, we applied an extension of the Axelson indirect adjustment method to evaluate the impact of the factor to materially influence a trend in radiation risks (2,8,9). Several approaches have been proposed for calculating externally corrected relative risks (RRs) or the maximum potential confounding bias (1,10,11). Our calculations illustrate the range of a potential bias in estimates of radiation–cancer associations under assumptions about the magnitudes of the confounder–exposure and confounder–disease associations (1). Briefly, suppose RRDOBSi is the observed RR for category i of radiation dose (D) relative to category 0, i = 0, …, I. For our evaluations, we further suppose that the confounder (C) is binary. Assuming a multiplicative model and that the parameters in the equations do not depend on important determinants of the outcome, such as age, we can express RRDOBSi as\n\nRRDOBSi=RRDi1+π1|i(RRC-1)1+π1|0(RRC-1)Equation(1),\n\nwhere π1|i=P(C=1|D=i) is the conditional probability of the confounder at radiation level i, and RRDi and RRC are the “true” RR and the confounder RR at the referent level of the other. From equation (1), the indirectly adjusted associations for radiation exposure are thus given by\n\nRRDi=RRDOBSi/1+π1|i(RRC-1)1+π1|0(RRC-1)Equation2.\n\nGiven external information on π1|i and RRC, equation (2) provides indirectly adjusted estimates of the true radiation RRs RRDi. Additionally, suppose we assume there is no radiation association, that ia, RRDi=1 for all i. Then given RRDOBSi, equation (2) yields a solution forπ1|i, the probability of the confounder at exposure i, in terms ofπ1|0 and RRC:\n\nπ1|i=RRDOBSi{1+π1|0(RRC-1)}-1RRC-1Equation(3),\n\nor equivalently the odds ratios for D and C, ORD,Ci=π1|i1-π1|0/π1|0(1-π1|i). Equation (3) enables an assessment of the plausibility that a binary factor C fully explains the observed radiation–disease association. The equation holds for any joint association (eg, multiplicative, submultiplicative, additive) between dose and C because the true joint model no longer involves dose when RRDi=1 for all i [(11); Mark Little, unpublished data].\n\nEquations (2) and (3) provide adjustment formulae for observed RRs of a categorical exposure in the presence of a categorical confounder. Given an observed linear excess RR (ERR) model, RRObs(D)=1+βD, where β is the ERR per milligray, we did not directly evaluate bias of an ERR-per milligray estimate, because with non-null confounding the adjusted “true” association is no longer linear. Although we are not aware of a published formula, we can assume that the dose category–specific confounder prevalences π1|i needed to fully explain the observed RRDOBSi in the absence of a radiation effect would be approximately similar to those required to explain the observed linear ERR per milligray under a linear model. The inputs to this evaluation for pediatric computed tomography (CT) and nuclear worker studies were very similar to those published previously (1), except that here we calculated the radiation risks using fitted linear ERR models rather than a categorical model as in Lubin et al. (1). For the CT studies, we rounded the prevalence of Down syndrome to 0.002 and for the nuclear worker study we used a slightly different collapsing of dose categories to simplify the table presentation.\n\nTo assess potential confounding from smoking status in nuclear worker studies, we used equation (3) to calculate the dose-specific proportions of ever-smokers, P(C = 1|X = i), for a given overall smoking prevalence P(C = 1), and the RRC for all cancers except leukemia by smoking status. [Notably, the prevalence of ever-smokers was 0.55–0.70 among US veterans in 1954–1957 (12) and among males in the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System for 1984 and 1990, 0.75 in controls in German Wismut uranium miners (13), and 0.70–0.80 in a pooling of underground uranium miners’ cohorts (14). The RR for ever-smoking was 1.6 in US veterans (12) and in a meta-analysis of international studies (15).]\n\nTo evaluate possible confounding by asbestos exposure in nuclear worker studies, we assumed that high exposure to asbestos increases the risk of death from all cancers except leukemia by 1.3-fold and that about 10% of nuclear workers might have been highly exposed to asbestos. This RR estimate is based on pooling the all-cancer standardized mortality ratios observed in two cohorts of textile workers highly exposed to (chrysotile) asbestos (16,17). The prevalence of asbestos exposure was from that observed in a nested lung cancer case-control study among Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers [≥2 Threshold Limit Value-10, which = 240 fiber-days/cm3 = 0.1 fiber/cm3/d*240 working d/y*10 years (18)].\n\nResults\n\nEligible Studies\n\nWe identified 26 eligible studies including eight studies of environmental, four of medical, and 14 of occupational exposure. The studies of environmental exposures included residents near the sites of the Chornobyl and Three Mile Island nuclear plant accidents (19,20), residents of villages along the Techa River contaminated by radioactive waste from the Mayak nuclear weapons facility in Russia (21), and residents of a building in Taiwan, China, contaminated with cobalt-60 (22). Four studies evaluated populations from China (23), Finland (24), Switzerland (25), and the United Kingdom (26) exposed to background radiation ( ). The Chinese study assessed cancer risk in adults, and the other three studies focused on the risk of cancer in children.\n\nTable 1.\n\nStudy no.Study nameReferenceOutcomeMeasured covariatesUncontrolled potential confounders or potential for selection bias Environmental studies 1Chornobyl residentsDavis et al. 2006 (19)Childhood acute leukemia incidenceCalendar time, sex, birth year, and residence (matching)SES/selection of controls differed by country and results suggest possible selection bias in Ukraine2Three Mile IslandHan et al. 2011 (20)Cancer incidence (all, leukemia)Age, race (restriction), education, smoking, background radiation, and sexOther adulthood cancer risk factors, eg, alcohol, BMI3China backgroundTao et al. 2012 (23)Cancer mortalityAge, sexOccupation, smoking, and other lifestyle factors potentially related to residential location, radon4GB backgroundKendall et al. 2013a (26)Childhood leukemia incidenceAge, sex, radon concentration, SES (Carstairs score, father's social class)5Swiss backgroundSpycher et al. 2015 (25)Childhood cancer incidenceSex, birth year, distance to nearest highway, electromagnetic fields from radio and TV transmitters (based on a geographic model) and from high-voltage power line, degree of urbanization of municipality, SES, education of household reference person and number of persons per room, birth weight, and birth order of childRadon6Techa RiverDavis et al. 2015 (21)Cancer incidenceSex, ethnicity (Slav, Tartar/Bashkir), smoking status (ever/never/unknown), birth cohort, calendar period of follow-up, attained age, time since exposure, and age at exposureResidual smoking confounding (unknown status for 54%), chemical exposures from contaminants from river.

Chornobyl accident recovery workers in Baltic countries, Belarus, Russia (32), and Ukraine (38); and atomic test participants (43) and radiological technologists in the United States (44–46).\n\nMeasured Confounders\n\nStudies of environmental exposures and cancers in adulthood generally controlled for potential confounders such as age and birth cohort (or, roughly equivalently, calendar time and age) and sex ( ). Studies of environmental contamination (ie, Chornobyl and Techa River studies) often controlled for region of residence or background radiation, whereas studies of natural background radiation typically controlled for lifestyle-related factors (eg, smoking, education, or SES). Childhood leukemia studies controlled for age, sex, parental smoking behavior (or surrogates) and (in one study) Down syndrome, a cancer-predisposing condition. Studies of medical exposures typically adjusted for age, sex, calendar period, and time since exposure and excluded children with conditions predisposing to cancer [as a potential source of confounding by indication (CBI)]. Studies of occupational exposures generally adjusted for sex, age, birth cohort, and SES (as a means of controlling for confounding by lifestyle factors such as smoking or alcohol consumption or by occupational exposure to other carcinogens). Most studies also adjusted for employment duration as a means of controlling for healthy worker survivor bias (HWSB), because the HWSB is a type of bias that can lead to attenuation of the cumulative dose response in occupational cohort studies.\n\nUnmeasured Confounders and Selection Bias\n\nThe population-based environmental studies exhibited limited potential for confounding or selection bias ( ). Two exceptions may be the Chornobyl residential study and the Techa River study. In the Chornobyl study, the authors reported evidence of control selection bias for Ukraine that may have caused an upward bias in risk estimate (19). The Techa River study experienced migration among 21% of cohort members outside (and back into) the cancer registry catchment area; however, the authors asserted that such migration would be expected to result in a loss of power without causing bias in the risk estimates (21).\n\nAmong the medical studies, the Canadian cardiac imaging study (27) did not control for CBI, and the CT studies (28,29) used information on cancer susceptibility syndromes (CSS) available for all or a subset of participants.\n\nFor the occupational studies, adjusting for duration of employment was an important means of partially controlling for the HWSB ( ): adjustment was found to increase the magnitude of the ERR–per unit dose for all cancers excluding leukemia in the United Kingdom (33) and US nuclear worker studies (40) and therefore in INWORKS (42). A greater potential for uncontrolled confounding from HWSB existed for the Korean worker (31) and Japanese nuclear worker (36) studies, which did not adjust for SES or duration of employment, and the German nuclear worker study (39), which did not adjust for birth cohort and SES. Prevalent hire bias is a form of selection bias in which follow-up begins after the start of exposure, which could result in unobserved exposure-related dropout of the most susceptible workers. This type of bias potentially existed for the German (39) and Japanese worker studies (36), because follow-up began decades after the highest exposures occurred and to a lesser extent for the French (47) and Korean worker studies (31) because follow-up began sooner after doses began accruing. All occupational studies involving hazardous exposures are potentially susceptible to residual confounding bias from the HWSB; standard analytical techniques, such as adjustment for duration of employment in a regression model, provide incomplete adjustment for this source of bias. Little evidence of selection bias was observed from incomplete questionnaire response in the US Radiologic Technologists study (44–46) ( ). Studies of nuclear workers are also potentially confounded by coexposures to other carcinogenic agents in the workplace, including benzene and asbestos, discussed below.\n\nTable 2.\n\nRelevant study no.Relevant study name (reference)Confounder(s) consideredOutcome(s) for confoundingEffect of adjustment on ERRCommentReference for confounding Environmental studies 3China background (23)Diet and nutrition, drinking water, pesticide residue, and Aflatoxin B1 in food, medical exposures, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumptionAll cancers excluding leukemiaNot reportedDistributions of these potential confounding factors did not differ much between high background radiation and control areasTao 1996 (48); Zha et al. 1997 (49); Tao et al. 2012 (23)5Swiss background (25)Residential mobilityChildhood cancer+43% when restricting to children with stable residenceMain risk estimate is not adjusted for residenceSpycher et al. 2015 (25)RadonChildhood cancerNot reportedIn a separate study, radon exposure was not associated with all childhood cancers combined (HR at 90% radon percentile = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.16, compared with median radon)Hauri et al. 2013 (50)6Techa River (21)SmokingSolid cancer−11%Smoking status available for 46% of the cohort; 33% of men vs 2% of women reported ever smokingDavis et al. 2015 (21)ChemicalsSolid cancerNot reportedReference states potentially prevalent chemicals are not known to be carcinogenicKrestinina et al. 2005 (51) Medical studies 9Canadian cardiac imaging (27)IndicationAll cancerNot reportedDose–response relationships observed for cardiac and noncardiac proceduresEisenberg et al. 2011 (27)10, 11French & UK pediatric CT (28, 29)SESBrain tumorsNoneNo consistent evidence that brain tumors in children or young adults are associated with SESSESBrain tumors+2%SES approximated by quintiles of household income per postal area (average population, 40 persons)Meulepas et al 2019 (52)CSSBrain tumorsNoneSimulations found radiation risks unlikely substantially confoundedMeulepas et al. 2016 (53)Tuberous sclerosis complex (a CSS)Brain tumorsNot reportedERR decreased by 8% when 66 TSC patients were excludedMeulepas et al 2019 (52)10French pediatric CT (28)CSSBrain tumors–45%Adjustment for presence of any brain tumor-specific CSSJourny et al. 2016a (28); Journy et al. 2016b (54)11UK pediatric CT (29)CSSBrain tumorsNoneExclusion of patients with CSS did not alter dose–response relationshipBerrington et al. 2016 (29)Previous unreported cancersBrain tumors−30%Based on confounder data for 40% of cohortBerrington et al. 2016 (29)IndicationBrain tumorsNot reportedMost head CTs were unrelated to cancer suspicion.

SES, for example, was weakly related to background radiation dose in the UK case-control study, and adjustment for smoking in the Techa river cohort reduced the ERR–per unit dose by only 11%. Among the medically exposed populations, most known risk factors for brain cancer and leukemia were unlikely to be associated with radiation dose and therefore are not likely to be confounders. We found little evidence of residual CBI through CSS because these conditions were very rare and not strongly related to number of CT scans. Exclusion of patients with previous unreported cancers in the UK pediatric CT study reduced the ERR–per unit dose for leukemia by 15% and for brain tumors by 30% (29). Lack of adjustment for SES is not expected to cause positive confounding of the ERR–per unit dose for leukemia, because participants from high-SES households have fewer CT scans and a higher baseline risk of leukemia (66,67). Other countries show little association between CT scans and SES (70). In the UK study and a Dutch study (52), SES adjustment did not materially affect the leukemia or brain tumor results.\n\nInformation for an indirect assessment of confounding in the environmental and medical studies was available either from secondary analyses of those studies or from external studies (54). In the study of cardiovascular imaging, there was indirect evidence of CBI, because there was a much weaker ERR–per unit dose for radiation exposure from other imaging and cancer risk than for cardiovascular imaging (27). An evaluation of the reason for pediatric CT scans in the UK study, based on a subset of all CTs, found that most CTs were unrelated to cancer suspicion. The main indication for repeated head scans over time was management of hydrocephalus (54). In addition, the start of follow-up in these studies is several years after the first CT, suggesting that the reason for the CT does not confound risk estimates. Meulepas et al. (53) calculated confounding bias in CT studies due to CSS under various scenarios and concluded that radiation risks for leukemia or brain tumors are unlikely substantially confounded. Direct adjustment for tuberous sclerosis complex, a brain tumor susceptibility syndrome and potential confounder as patients undergo routine brain imaging from time of diagnosis, changed the brain tumor ERR–per unit dose very little in a Dutch study of CT-related radiation risks (52).\n\nIn the occupational studies, adjustment for sex, age, birth cohort, and SES was performed to indirectly control potential confounding from smoking and occupational coexposures ( ); after doing so, there was little evidence of positive confounding by smoking in studies of nuclear workers (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was negatively associated with radiation in the UK, US, and INWORKS studies, and the ERR–per unit dose was similar for lung cancer and for all solid cancers). In the US nuclear worker study, liver cirrhosis was positively associated with radiation dose (although to a much lesser extent than all nonsmoking related cancers), indicating that in this study alcohol intake could be a positive confounder for liver cancer. In the US and UK cohorts, pleural cancer and other mesothelioma were strongly positively associated with dose, suggesting that asbestos exposure may be a positive confounder for lung cancer in these studies and INWORKS. For leukemia, we found little evidence of confounding by benzene or other leukemogens based on information from related studies in US workers (60,69,71).\n\nand summarize our assessment of the evidence regarding confounders for each study based on the information provided in and , respectively. For most environmental studies, potential confounders were generally either adjusted for or found not likely to actually cause bias. An exception is the study of background radiation in China, which did not adjust for lifestyle-related factors. The pediatric medical studies exhibited some potential for residual confounding from predisposing factors. For the occupational studies, direct and indirect evidence suggests that smoking, alcohol consumption, and other occupational exposures might cause confounding, especially those that did not adjust for birth cohort and SES.\n\nConfounderLifestyleOccupationalMedicalNo.Study name (reference)SmokingAlcoholBMISESChemicalIndication/predisposing factors Environmental 2Three Mile Island (20)AdjAdjNA3China background (23)NoNoNANA5Swiss background (25)NANANAAdjNANA6Techa River (21)AdjNoNA8Taiwanese residents (22)NANA Medical 9Canadian cardiac imaging (27)NANo10French Pediatric CT (28) (brain/CNS)NANANANANASome (CSS)11UK Pediatric CT (29) (brain/CNS)NANANANANANo (CSS), some (previous cancers)12PIRATES (30) (thyroid)NANANANANA Occupational 13Korean workers (31)PossiblyPossibly YesPossibly NA15UK NRRW (33)NoAdjPossibly NA16Korean nuclear workers (34)AdjYes Possibly NA17Rocketdyne nuclear workers (35)AdjPossibly NA18Japanese nuclear workers (36)YesYesYesPossibly NA19Canadian nuclear workers (37)AdjPossibly NA21German nuclear workers (39)PossiblyPossiblyYesPossibly NA22US nuclear workers (40)NoPossiblyAdjPossibly NA23INWORKS (42)NoPossiblyAdjPossibly NA25USRT (breast) (44)NoNoAdjNoNANA25USRT (brain) (45)NoNoAdjNANANA25USRT (BCC) (46)AdjAdjAdjAdjNANA26French nuclear workers (47)PossiblyNoAdjPossibly NA\n\nTable 5.\n\nConfounderLifestyleOccupationalMedicalNoStudy name (reference)SmokingSESChemicalIndication/predisposing factorEnvironmental1Chornobyl residents (19)NA NoNANA2Three Mile Island (20)AdjAdjNA3China background (23)NoNANA4GB background (26)NAAdjNANA5Swiss background (25)NAAdjNANA7Finnish background (24)NoNANo8Taiwanese residents (22)NANAMedical10French Pediatric CT (28)NAPossiblyNANo (CSS)11UK Pediatric CT (29)NANoNANo (CSS)Occupational13Korean workers (31)YesPossibly NA14Chornobyl liquidators: Belarus, Russia, & Baltic countries (32)NoNoNoNA15UK NRRW (33)NoPossiblyNA17Rocketdyne nuclear workers (35)AdjPossiblyNA18Japanese nuclear workers (36)Yes PossiblyNA19Canadian nuclear workers (37)AdjPossiblyNA20Chornobyl liquidators: Ukraine (38)NoNoNoNA21German nuclear workers (39)Yes PossiblyNA22US nuclear workers (40)NoAdjPossiblyNA23INWORKS (41)NoAdjPossiblyNA24Smoky nuclear test (43)AdjNA26French nuclear workers (47)PossiblyAdjPossibly NA\n\nQuantifying Potential Bias Due to Unmeasured Confounders\n\nUsing indirect methods, we evaluated potential confounding from smoking status in nuclear worker studies. In , we assumed no radiation association and calculated the distribution of smoking required to explain the dose response observed for all cancer mortality except leukemia in the INWORKS study of nuclear workers (42). For overall smoking prevalences of 50–70% and a smoking-related all cancer RR of 1.6, calculated smoking prevalences in the highest dose categories exceeded 1.0, indicating smoking status cannot explain the full range of observed radiation risks ( ). At an overall smoking prevalence of 50%, a minimum RR for smoking of 1.81 is required for valid probabilities in all categories. In this case, smoking prevalences increasing from slightly below 50% for low-dose categories to almost 100% at 500 mGy or more are required to entirely explain the observed association with radiation exposure. Results support the authors’ conclusion that smoking could not explain the RR trend.\n\nTable 6.\n\nRadiation dose D (mGy)<55 to <2020 to <100100 to <200200 to <300300 to <500≥500Observed result‡Mean dose0.610.644.2138.1240.6368.0630.8 RRDOBS 1.001.001.021.071.121.181.30 RRC For fixed P(C = 1) = 0.10‖, computed P(C = 1|D = i), I = 1,…,61.30.060.080.130.290.450.66(>1.00)§1.60.080.090.120.200.280.390.612.00.090.090.110.160.210.280.423.00.090.100.110.130.160.200.274.00.100.100.110.120.150.170.23 RRC For fixed P(C = 1) = 0.20‖, computed P(C = 1|D = i), I = 1,…,61.30.160.180.240.400.560.78(>1.00)§1.60.180.190.220.300.390.510.742.00.190.190.210.270.320.400.553.00.190.200.210.240.270.320.404.00.190.200.210.230.250.290.35 RRC For fixed P(C = 1) = 0.30‖, computed P(C = 1|D = i), i = 1,…,61.30.260.280.340.500.670.90(>1.00)§1.60.280.290.320.410.500.620.872.00.290.290.310.370.430.510.673.00.290.290.310.340.380.430.534.00.290.300.310.340.370.400.48 RRC For fixed P(C = 1) = 0.50‖, computed P(C = 1|D = i), i = 1,…,61.30.460.480.540.710.89(>1.00)§(>1.00)§1.60.480.490.520.620.720.86(>1.00)§2.00.480.490.510.580.650.750.933.00.490.490.510.550.600.660.794.00.490.490.510.550.580.640.74 RRC For fixed P(C = 1) = 0.70‖, computed P(C = 1|D = i), i = 1,…,61.30.660.680.740.92(>1.00)§(>1.00)§(>1.00)§1.60.670.680.720.830.94(>1.00)§(>1.00)§2.00.680.690.720.790.870.98(>1.00)§3.00.690.690.710.770.820.90(>1.00)§4.00.690.690.710.760.810.871.00\n\nAssuming heavy asbestos exposure increases all cancer risk 1.3-fold, the prevalence of exposure would have to increase with radiation dose from 6% in the lowest radiation dose category to greater than 100% in the highest radiation dose category in order to explain the observed radiation dose–response association for all cancer excluding leukemia in INWORKS. This is impossible. If the asbestos-related RR were 1.6, asbestos prevalence would have to increase from 8% to 61% in the highest dose category, which is implausible; even in the US site with highest asbestos exposure (the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard), the correlation between asbestos and occupational radiation dose was quite low (r = 0.09) (18).\n\nFor studies of leukemia following radiation dose from pediatric CT exams, an evaluation of bias shows that for a CSS such as Down syndrome, which carries a 20-fold increased leukemia risk (72), prevalence would have to increase from the population level of 0.2% (53) in the lowest dose category to 4% in the highest dose category to fully explain the observed radiation dose response ( ). This is implausible, because the UK study found a Down syndrome prevalence of just 0.03% and no evidence of association with radiation dose (29).\n\nTable 7.\n\nRadiation dose D (mGy)<55–910–1415–1920–29≥30Observed results ‡Mean dose2.37.112.316.524.751.1 RRDOBS 1.001.151.311.441.692.50 RRC For fixed P(C=1|D=0)=0.002‖, computed P(C=1|D=i), i=1,…,52.5§0.0020.100.210.290.461.0010.00.0020.020.040.050.080.1720.00.0020.010.020.030.040.08 RRC For fixed P(C=1|D=0)=0.005‖, computed P(C=1|D=i), i=1,…,52.5§0.0050.100.210.290.461.0010.00.0050.020.040.060.080.1820.00.0050.010.020.030.040.09 RRC For fixed P(C=1|D=0)=0.01‖, computed P(C=1|D=i), i=1,…,52.5§0.010.110.210.300.461.0010.00.010.030.050.060.090.1920.00.010.020.030.040.050.10 RRC For fixed P(C=1|D=0)=0.10‖, computed P(C=1|D=i), i=1,…,53.0§0.100.190.280.360.511.0010.00.100.130.160.190.240.4220.00.100.120.150.170.200.33 RRC For fixed P(C=1|D=0)=0.20‖, computed P(C=1|D=i), i=1,…,54.0§0.200.240.360.430.571.0010.00.200.250.300.340.410.6720.00.200.270.280.310.370.58\n\nSummary Regarding Potential Biases\n\nAfter considering evidence from direct and indirect confounding assessment as well as theoretical assessment of the potential impact of confounding, summarizes our results with respect to potential biases and provides an overall assessment of the likelihood and direction of possible confounding and selection bias for each study. Few studies exhibited serious potential for confounding (eg, a change in dose response estimate of >20%) or selection bias. The most consistent finding across studies is the likelihood of downward bias (towards the null) in nuclear worker studies due to a HWSB of unknown magnitude, because direct adjustment is not possible with conventional statistical methods. Although confounding from coexposures was not directly evaluated in most occupationally exposed cohorts, our hypothetical adjustments in using INWORKS as an example suggest that these coexposures are unlikely to cause serious confounding, particularly after adjustment for birth cohort and SES.\n\nTable 8.\n\nOverall likelihood (direction*) of uncontrolled confounding?Overall likelihood (direction*) of selection bias?Study (reference)No.All cancers excluding leukemiaLeukemiaAll cancers excluding leukemiaLeukemiaComment Environmental Chornobyl residents (19)1NAUnlikelyNALikely ↑Exclusion of subgroup with potential recall bias substantially reduced risk estimatesThree Mile Island (20)2UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyNo information on confounding by alcohol and BMI for all cancers excluding leukemiaChina background (23)3UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyGB background (26)4NAUnlikelyNAUnlikelySwiss background (25)5UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyStudy directly assessed many factorsTecha River (21)6UnlikelyNAUnlikelyNANo information on confounding by alcohol, SES, and BMIFinnish background (24)7NAUnlikelyNAUnlikelyNo information on confounding by SESTaiwanese residents (22)8UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyNo information on confounding by smoking, alcohol, SES, and BMI Medical Canadian cardiac imaging (27)9Likely ↑↓UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyLifestyle factors causing uncertain bias directionFrench Pediatric CT (28)10UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUK Pediatric CT (29)11UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyIndirect adjustment suggests predisposing factors cause little biasPIRATES (30)12UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikely Occupational Korean workers (31)13Likely ↓UnlikelyLikely ↓Likely ↓HWSB and prevalent hire biasChornobyl liquidators: Belarus, Russia, & Baltic countries (32)14UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUK NRRW† (33)15Likely ↓UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyHWSBKorean nuclear workers (34)16Likely ↓NAUnlikelyNAHWSBRocketdyne nuclear workers (17)17Likely ↓UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyHWSBJapanese nuclear workers (36)18Likely ↑↓UnlikelyLikely ↓Likely ↓Smoking, HWSB, prevalent hire biasCanadian nuclear workers (37)19Likely ↓UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyHWSBChornobyl liquidators: Ukraine (38)20UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyGerman nuclear workers (39)21Likely ↓UnlikelyLikely ↓Likely ↓HWSB and prevalent hire biasUS nuclear workers† (40)22Likely ↓UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyHWSBINWORKS (41, 42)23Likely ↓UnlikelyUnlikelyUnlikelyHWSBSmoky nuclear test (43)24NAUnlikelyNAUnknownUSRT (BCC) (46)25UnlikelyNAUnlikelyNAUSRT (breast cancer) (44)25UnlikelyNAUnlikelyNAUSRT (brain tumors) (45)25UnlikelyNAUnlikelyNAFrench nuclear workers† (47)26Likely ↓UnlikelyLikely ↓Likely ↓HWSB and prevalent hire bias\n\nDiscussion\n\nAll epidemiological studies have strengths and limitations that may affect their ability to quantify the association between radiation and cancer risk, especially at low doses and low dose rates (73–75). Confounding and selection bias are important considerations in observational epidemiology, particularly in low-dose radiation studies, where the excess risk at average study doses may be quite small. We have reviewed recent literature on low-radiation dose–cancer associations with regard to potential confounders and summarized the measured confounders that were included in these analyses as well as considered the impact of unmeasured confounding on radiation risk estimates for solid cancers and leukemia. Overall, we found little evidence that confounding or selection bias was likely to entirely explain the observed positive relationships between low-dose radiation and cancer. For confounding, this was either because the relationship between the confounder and radiation exposure was relatively weak or the confounder was only a weak risk factor for all solid cancers or leukemia, the two outcomes of primary interest in this monograph.\n\nFor confounding to occur, there must be imbalance between exposure groups in the distribution of the confounding factor. How might such imbalance arise? One possibility is that the potential confounder is a cause of radiation exposure. For example, in , we reviewed several studies of medical radiation exposures for diagnostic procedures in which there was concern that clinical conditions associated with an increased cancer risk might also lead to more diagnostic radiation exposure. Another possibility is that there is common cause of both radiation exposure and the confounding factor. For example, in we pointed to potential concerns in occupational studies that employment in a specific work location might lead to benzene exposure and radiation exposure. However, our evaluation of confounding by other occupational carcinogens suggests that such bias is likely to be modest, particularly after adjusting for sex, attained age, birth cohort, and SES (which are related to exposure to other occupational carcinogens).\n\nA confounding factor must also cause (or be associated with another cause of) the disease of interest. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert, in general, that a factor is an important confounder of radiation effects for all diseases: a factor may be an important confounder in analysis of one disease and irrelevant as a confounder in analysis of a different disease. Accordingly, judgment regarding potential for confounding depends on the outcome under study. For example, cigarette smoking is a strong risk factor for lung cancer and is often viewed as an important potential confounding factor in investigations of lung cancer. The RR of lung cancer for moderate to heavy smokers generally exceeds 10 (76) and is greater than the RR associated with exposure to relatively high doses of radiation, which rarely exceeds 2 (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation) (77). Therefore, even moderate associations between radiation dose and smoking can lead to potentially important bias in studies of radiation–lung cancer associations. In contrast, the smoking-related RR of most other cancers generally does not exceed 2, and is 1 (ie, null) for cancers that are not smoking related; therefore, much stronger radiation–smoking associations would be required for smoking-related cancers other than lung cancer to induce substantial confounding bias (and no bias would be expected for nonsmoking related cancers). In and , we separated our considerations of confounders of the radiation associations with cancers other than leukemia and leukemia.\n\nConfounding can lead to bias toward the null or away from the null. A disease risk factor that is distributed more frequently among the exposed than unexposed may lead to spurious evidence of a positive association between radiation and cancer where none exists (or lead to exaggerated evidence regarding the magnitude of association between radiation and cancer where an association exists). Conversely, a risk factor that is distributed more frequently among the unexposed than exposed may obscure evidence of a positive association between radiation and cancer, or even lead to spurious evidence of an inverse association between radiation and cancer. For example, in some nuclear facilities, higher radiation doses tend to be accrued in areas where people are prohibited from smoking cigarettes, whereas lower radiation doses tend to be accrued in areas where smoking may be permitted (56,78).\n\nConcerns regarding the impact of confounding on a radiation–cancer association tend to be greater when investigating an association of small magnitude than when investigating associations of large magnitude because modest imbalances in confounding factors between radiation exposure groups may be sufficient to lead to meaningful distortion in the former. We reviewed external evidence regarding the strength of the association between the confounding factor and disease. Under the assumption of no radiation association, we calculated the degree of imbalance in the distribution of unmeasured confounding factors between categories of radiation dose required to explain the observed radiation dose–response association. Even for these small effects, for example, for low-dose occupational radiation and all solid cancers, we showed from these theoretical calculations that confounders were unlikely to completely explain positive findings. This is because the degree of confounding depends, in part, on the prevalence of the confounder among the exposed and unexposed. We illustrate this in and . Exposures or conditions that are rarely observed in a study population are unlikely to be strong confounders. For example, it has been suggested that CSS may confound studies of cancer risk following pediatric CT examinations. However, in we show that such predisposing conditions are rare among patients in the French and UK pediatric CT studies, suggesting that the degree of confounding due to predisposing conditions is likely to be small. Another example pertains to smoking or asbestos exposure in nuclear workers: several studies have found that smoking is only weakly positively or even negatively associated with radiation dose in the cohorts included in the US pooled nuclear worker study (18,59,60,79). Directly adjusting for smoking in a lung cancer study among Hanford workers (59) and for asbestos exposure among Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers (18) changed risk estimates little.\n\nConfounding may be handled through various approaches to account for the effect of the factor itself (if the study collected information on the factor) or to control for variables that are associated with that factor. For example, in a study that lacks individual information on smoking, an investigator might adjust for variables that are associated with smoking (eg, SES and birth cohort) and thereby reduce potential confounding of the radiation dose–cancer association by smoking. Similarly, although body mass index was not adjusted for in most occupational studies, it is unlikely to be associated with radiation dose, particularly after adjusting for birth cohort and SES. However, it is important to distinguish between factors that are potential confounders and factors that are associated with radiation exposure because they are effects of exposure. Control for the former may reduce bias due to confounding, whereas control for the latter may induce bias. One example of the latter is an exposure (or other factor) intermediate in the chain of causation from radiation exposure to the disease of interest. Careful consideration, rather than statistical tests, is needed to distinguish between variables that are confounders and those that are intermediate variables; these judgments are central to deciding whether to control for a factor. Temporality often is an important consideration. For example, knowledge that one was exposed to radiation may lead to subsequent behavior changes later in life (eg, change in alcohol consumption or smoking behavior). In such a setting, current smoking status is a risk factor for cancer and associated with prior radiation exposure, but it is not a confounder. Rather, it is an indirect effect of prior radiation exposure operating via a pathway that involves behavioral changes affected by the conditions that also led to radiation exposure. In such a setting, it is possible to estimate the direct effect of radiation on cancer, separate from any indirect effects, but such models often require strong assumptions.\n\nIt is also unwise to adjust for factors that are related to exposure but not plausibly independently related to disease risk. For example, in occupational studies one might control for calendar period, or time period of hire, in a model for lung cancer that also adjusts for birth cohort and attained age (ostensibly as an approach to reduce bias due to secular changes in smoking patterns). Occupational exposure is frequently higher in earlier time periods before hazard and control methods were well understood. Yet, after adjusting for important correlates of smoking, like age and birth cohort, time period of hire would not be expected to be associated with smoking, and adjustment could inflate variance estimates and distort risk estimates for the exposure of interest.\n\nA potential source of confounding that has not been fully considered in the occupational studies is bias due to healthy worker survivorship. The HWSB occurs when workplace exposures cause ill health or other conditions that lead to early departure from the workforce and thereby eliminate the potential for future radiation exposure [eg, see (80)] and is especially important when studying hazardous or highly selective workplaces where dose is accrued over a working lifetime. Furthermore, due to the highly sensitive nature of nuclear weapons work, these workers are subject to initial and ongoing stringent medical and security screening (81), which may exacerbate the HWSB. Although conventional statistical methods (eg, regression modelling) are not currently capable of adjusting for the HWSB, this is an area of active research (82), including in radiation-exposed worker populations (83).\n\nThe indirect adjustment approach employed here did not estimate the impact of bias correction on the precision of the effect estimate. Although the application of the indirect adjustment approach to adjust the observed confidence limits is possible, a full and comprehensive adjustment requires knowledge of the uncertainties associated with the joint distribution of the confounder and radiation dose as well as of the rate ratio, and the methodological approaches are not straightforward (1,84). We considered this to be beyond the scope of this article, because the required information does not exist for most studies, but recognize that it is an area of active research.\n\nIn our review, we found that epidemiological analyses controlled for relatively few factors ( ). The primary reason for this is the study design in radiation epidemiology, which is most commonly a retrospective study conducted via record linkage rather than direct participant contact. This design is used to facilitate the large sample size needed for studying low doses and because radiation-related cancers can take many decades to occur. The disadvantage as we have shown here is that this often limits the ability to collect information on confounding factors unless they are also available in historical records. It is common in systematic reviews to evaluate quality of studies based on whether they address sources of potential bias and then to exclude or consider uninformative studies that are evaluated as low quality. Based purely on such quality assessment, many of the studies we evaluated might be considered low quality because they did not have direct information on potential confounders like smoking. However, this approach does not consider the direction and magnitude of the potential bias. We have shown that there are a number of approaches to assess the potential for bias via substudies, other outcomes known to be related to the confounder but unlikely related to radiation or indirect calculations via the Axelson approach. Our in-depth analysis showed that confounding was generally unlikely to be a major source of bias in these recent studies of low-dose radiation and cancer. Nevertheless, we urge authors to publish the impact of adjustment for potential confounders to facilitate the assessment of confounding in their own and other related studies. We have also laid out a rigorous approach for assessing the potential for confounding using a variety of data sources and methods that can be used more broadly in systematic reviews of observational data."
