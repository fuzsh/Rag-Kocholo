        "text": "The Modern artist doesn’t stand for himself. He is a pale reflection of all the others, of the outside world as if he would carry a mirror all the way. At the very beginning of the 20th century, aware of their uncertain aesthetic condition, the artists couldn’t avoid the nature of the dispersion that deeply infused their reality. Soon, the diseased European atmosphere became a symptom for the disembodied space and for the whole world’s disenchantment. Hence, building imaginary spaces out of words prevails in all Modernist programs and ideas and came as a quick response to the extremely perished state of the dissolved Ego but also as an imperative need of regaining a lost unity. Extremely eloquent for staging the psychological evolution of the subject, the space textuality comes to re-establish the relation of the underworld fire and the celestial light. Inner and outer space echoes the individual’s quest of himself just as microcosm and macrocosm mirror each other. For that reason, the tremendous effort of building (a book, an imaginary city, a library as utopian space of vegetal memory) fuses iconic figures with a coherent vision of a spiritual universe. Keywords - imaginary city, modernist artist, allomatic experience, catabasis, utopian space.\n\nQ: Revolutionary ideas can be proposed through art and design. Compare and contrast two revolutionary creative works, one from the 20 th century and one from the 21 st century. How has the context contributed to the approach, medium and presentation of the works? \" Art cannot change the world, but it can contribute to changing the consciousness and drives of the men and women who could, \" states Marcuse (1977). A critique of revolutionary architectural design in both the Cold War and present day eras can be seen to reveal a homogenised thematic thread. This being that as technology continues to advance, our world becomes increasingly uninhabitable-an effect that may be felt both ecologically and existentially. The technological revolutions of the 20 th and 21 st centuries have greatly informed and influenced the approach, medium and presentation of art, and more specifically, architectural design. The 20 th century was an era of unprecedented technological expansion, and the effect of this cultural upheaval can be regarded as the catalyst for shifts in societal values and anxieties. The Viennese multidisciplinary group Haus Rucker Co. (1967-1992) were known for their pneumatic spatial forms that attempted to examine the contextual impact of nuclear warfare and the threat of imminent annihilation during the Cold War period.\n\nSeveral years ago I was involved in an online pedagogical and theoredcal discussion. The center of this discussion was how one might usefully differendate modernism, the avant-garde, postmodernism. The following is my attempt to do just that; to differendate how each of these terms might describe contrasdng ardsdc strategies, contrasdng ways of thinking about and making art. And in their own ways, each is Utopian. I will establish this framework by analogy. The overarching analogy is that each of these three ardsdc strategies can be compared to \"places\" in a rite of passage. After discussing insights that anthropologists have shed on the contours of rites of passage, I will compare the avant-garde with liminality's freedom, iconoclasm, and u-topianism or placelessness. In contrast with the avant-garde, modernisms are various \"new orders\" or teleological ordering systems that ardsts put forward and support. Modernisms in many ways parallel the \"new status\" that inidates enter at the end of a rite of passage. Finally, postmodernists are those who see the advantages and pitfalls of each approach, playing on the gap between avant-garde freedom (and silence) and modernist asserdon (and dogmadsm). Such a theoredcal framework is only valid if it seems to account for the ardsdc strategies of real ardsts and their 60 I Interdisciplinar)' Humanities\n\nIn the first half of the 20 th century, the relations between the social revolution, the processes of modernization, and avant-garde art and architecture were very close. Piotr Juszkiewicz, analyzing the relations between modernism and totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, stated that \" totalitarian regimes did not reject a certain form of artistic language by default because they were interested in their utility \". \" Fundamental elements of our architecture are conditioned by the social revolution \" , wrote El Lissitzky. In the face of such declarations, the relations between avant-garde designers and social or Communist trends should not come as a surprise. Post-revolutionary Russia became a true test site for new movements, whereas modernist and Constructivist artists enthusiastically proceeded to build the new (better) reality. The development of industry (primarily heavy industry) was to become a driving force behind the modernist processes. Examples of industrial plants built in the 1920s and 1930s in the Soviet Union show the enormous impact exerted by modern construction and urbanism on the formation of the \" new man \". Numerous products of avant-garde architecture reflected the image of the \" new world \" and became the transmitters of the new Soviet ideology. For the inhabitants of Ekaterinburg, Magnitogorsk, or Kharkov, modernist buildings and landscape layout formed a permanent image of the city and its concept. Urban designs, such as the \" Linear City \" of Ernst May in Magnitogorsk, were utopian modernist dreams executed on an enormous scale. The circumstances of their creation, followed by the times of their greatness and fall, form a portrait of the avant-garde architecture understood as a utopia, the future that never arrived.\n\nUtopias create an imagined world of possibilities and allow for the visualization of impossibilities; like a dream, they allow for the triggering of the imagination, opening spaces for new possibilities to emerge. At the heart of modernism, was a utopian desire to create a better world, and the belief that design, art and architecture could transform society and move towards better ideals. In contemporary art and architecture, this utopian desire still defines creation, however in a new and distinct way. Two case studies are presented exemplifying two types of contemporary utopia in art and in architecture. In architecture, with John Pawson, the research clarifies a type of utopian spiritual depuration through minimalism, creating a space that allows for a contemplative way of life. In art, with Anselm Kiefer, the work explores a metaphysical and cosmological utopian type of existence, allowing for a deeper connection with the primitive and natural order of the universe. The research shows that not only is utopia part of contemporary art and architecture, but that those utopian visions do in fact, to some extent, come alive in reality. In doing so, we become closer to More's utopian dream, where men are led by the soul and by spirituality.\n\nThe particular field of urban design is profoundly influenced by ideas about the ideal city, which have very deep roots in utopian discourse and thought. In tracing the relationship between urban planning and utopia from its origins to the present day, the author attempts to put his finger on what town planners, in trying to organize and control space, have made of utopia. The relationship between utopia and urban design is approached here from the starting-point of two questions. (a) How does the city impart its morphology to utopian discourse? (b) Can urban design be the science of the ideal city?\n\nThe present article considers the avant-garde as experience, and primarily as the experience of perceiving avant-garde art in terms of interruption, estrangement, and arrest. The focus is on the “internal”—utopian—time of the avant-garde, or the dimension of the social imagination. This is directly related to Walter Benjamin’s concept of history, and his idea of the interruption of time (and thinking). The article analyzes the connection between the continuing interest in the avant-garde and the problem of representing utopia. Avant-garde art is considered as a “sign of history” according to Kant: it takes on the function of an index in that it delineates space for new social relations. Avant-garde art is a form of mapping out a new community, which precedes any institutionalization. Such an intrusion of the “invisible” into avant-garde imagery is explored with the example of Jean-Luc Marion’s reflections on Rothko and Marie-José Mondzain’s conception of the icon as the forerunner of modern abstract art.
