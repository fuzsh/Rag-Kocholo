During the 1930s and 1940s dozens of well-known artists, collectors, writers, musicians, architects, actors, di- rectors, and producers emigrated to Los Angeles from Europe. During the early 1950s, in fact, the codirector of the Los Angeles County Muse- um of History, Science, and Art, William R. Valentiner, was a German refugee who had had a long-standing interest in the German Expression- ists. Valentiner encouraged members of the Hollywood emigre commu- nity to collect and donate to the museum works by the German Expres- sionists. The connection with Germany was strengthened in 1967, when Los Angeles was named the sole sister city of Berlin. We are delighted to be able to extend this relationship in a center dedicated to connoisseur- ship and scholarship. With the acquisition of the Robert Gore Rifkind collec- tion in 1983, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art became in a single stroke a major force in the collection, study, and display of German Ex- pressionist art, the home of the largest single holding of German Expres- sionist graphic art, and the repository of an exceptional library of more than four thousand volumes, many containing original graphics. The opening in 1987 of the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expres- sionist Studies, a handsome space of twenty-eight hundred square feet, was a momentous step for the museum and one in a recent series of ex- pansions that has included the construction of the Robert O. Anderson Building and the Pavilion for Japanese Art and the addition of new gal- leries for the departments of Prints and Drawings and Photography. Mr. Rifkind has frequently made reference to a great pri- vate library established by Wilhelm F. Arntz, who lived in Haag, a small town outside of Munich. He visited Arntz many times and acquired works for his own collection from him. The Arntz collection, which comprises sixty thousand books, periodicals, and manuscripts devoted primarily to twentieth-century art, contains an extensive body of works on German Expressionism. In April 1986, following Arntz's death, the J. Paul Getty Trust acquired his library, bringing together in Los Angeles a truly extra- ordinary collection of materials on German Expressionism. Many Ger- man newspapers, reporting the acquisition, commented that with the Rifkind holdings at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Arntz holdings at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, many German scholars would now find it necessary to come to Los An- geles to do extensive original research. The center, along with the Robert Gore Rifkind Founda- tion, will continue to make it possible for distinguished scholars-in- residence (who have included Wolf-Dieter Dube, Peter Guenther, and Gunther Thiem) to come to Los Angeles to pursue research in the field, drawing upon the center's resources. The museum will also carry on its series of exhibitions drawn from the center's collection. It is extremely gratifying that Mr. Rifkind has continued to augment the center's hold- ings. Since the museum's acquisition of the collection he has added exten- sively to the library and has filled lacunae in the print collection. These volumes— the complete illustrated catalogue of the print collection and the accompanying commemorative collection of Foreword scholarly essays— allow the scholar access to the collection and provide an extraordinary visual record of the graphic achievement of the German Expressionists. The publication of these volumes was an ambitious un- dertaking. The catalogue, intended primarily for scholars, is perhaps the largest fully illustrated volume documenting a single collection ever pub- lished by an American museum. For his extraordinary commitment to its compilation I am grateful to Bruce Davis, curator of prints and drawings. The commemorative essay volume is intended primarily to encourage a world of interested readers and museumgoers to enhance their experi- ence of German Expressionist prints and drawings. For their dedication to this goal I am grateful to Victor Carlson, senior curator of prints and drawings, and to the staff of the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies, headedby Timothy Benson, associate curator. Other staff members who were involved in this project include Mitch Tuchman, managing editor, who coordinated these volumes and negotiated with our copublisher, Prestel-Verlag, and Deenie Yudell, head graphic designer, who designed the handsome volumes despite the rigors of her administra- tive responsibilities. Stephanie Barron, curator of twentieth-century art, contributed valuable advice on all phases of the project in addition to writ- ing an essay for the commemorative volume. The other authors— Wolf- Dieter Dube, Alexander Diickers, Peter Guenther, Rose-Carol Washton Long, Paul Raabe, and Ida Katherine Rigby— all of whom took time from their schedules to write essays, are gratefully acknowledged. Karen Jacobson undertook the editing of both volumes, achieving the highest standards of consistency in this complicated bilingual project. I am above all thankful to Robert Gore Rifkind, who in enriching the museum's collections in such an extraordinary way has also enriched our community and the world of scholarship. Earl A.

Over the centuries certain individuals have built collections that reflect their own interests and tastes and have donated them to museums, which have in turn made the works available to the public. I believe that my own efforts have been in this tradition. The building of a great art collection requires the col- laborative efforts of the collector and of many other individuals, and my collection is no exception. With pleasure I take this opportunity to thank the many people who have helped build the Rif kind collection, many of whom have become good friends and shared memorable experiences with me. Although the seventeen years I have spent collecting German Ex- pressionist art have not been without their disappointments, for the most part collecting has been one of the great joys of my life. My relationship with other collectors, dealers, curators, and art historians has been truly symbiotic. They have taught me, in- spired me, and helped shape my collection, while I have stimulated their collecting and scholarship. I should therefore like to acknowledge this group generally and three distinguished collectors of German Expres- sionist art in particular: Morton D. May of Saint Louis, Wilhelm F. Arntz of Haag, and Lothar-Giinther Buchheim of Feldafing. Each of them gave me much encouragement. I should also like to thank the many scholars who have so graciously and generously imparted their knowledge to me. To begin with, I should like to thank the coauthors of this catalogue for their contri- butions to the study of German Expressionism. Each one is a friend who has fostered my collecting. In addition I want to thank other scholars who have inspired me. I regret that contributions to this catalogue could not be made by the late Ernst Scheyer and the late Donald Gordon, who were both more than generous in offering advice and encouragement. It is also a pleasure to thank Gunther Thiem, former curator of the Staats- galerie, Stuttgart, who has been a supporter of the collection almost from the beginning. Thanks are due as well to Isa Lohmann-Siems, former curator of the Barlach Haus in Hamburg, who introduced me not only to the works of Ernst Barlach but also to German Expressionist sculpture in general. I must also acknowledge the contributions of Hans Bolliger of Zurich and Elmar Seibel of Boston. Without them I would not have been able to build the great library that is now in the possession of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Obviously I cannot individually acknowledge everyone who has assisted me, but I must single out Orrel P. Reed, Jr., the first curator of the collection, who guided me in all aspects of building the collection; Karin Breuer, currently assistant curator of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, who served as curator for almost five years and was responsible for much of the preliminary cataloguing of the collection; and Susan Trauger, who has served as librarian of the Robert Gore Rifkind Foundation and the Rifkind Study Genter for several years, bringing order to an extraordinar- ily complex collection. Finally, I should like to express my gratitude to Earl A. Powell III and the trustees of the Los Angeles Gounty Museum of Art for Preface their support of this enormous project. I am particularly grateful to trustee Franklin D. Murphy, a longtime admirer of German Expression- ist art whose early support of the museum's acquisition of the collection was invaluable; to Julian Ganz, Jr., chairman of the board of trustees, who spent many hours negotiating the acquisition; and to the board's presi- dent, Daniel N. Belin. It is an enormous satisfaction to me that the aforemen- tioned persons have made possible the publication of this volume and the accompanying catalogue of the collection. I believe that these publica- tions will stand as landmarks in the field of German Expressionist graphic art for many decades.

Every collection is, as it were, an autobiography, a testament to the wishes, dreams, and even the obsessions of an individual and to that person's capacity for sensual and spiritual perception. A collection bears the marks of the struggle toward realization, of ambitions and of actual achieve- ments. Thus every collection is unique and, above all, much greater than the sum of its parts. This is why we are so dismayed when a collection is dissolved, for it is the destruction of a life's work, an accomplishment that developed from loving dedication. Collector's stamps on graphic works, bookplates in private libraries, collection catalogues are all attempts to preserve the traces and to keep the individual's intellectual contribution from being forgotten. An effective way to prevent such a disappearance is to make a collection available to the public, either by establishing an inde- pendent institution or by making it part of a larger one. Yet it is not appro- priate for every collection to become part of a large museum collection, and this often causes problems. Even for those collectors who claim that they love their collection more than life itself, personal considerations often outweigh concern for the collection when the time comes to donate it to an institution. The significance of the Rifkind collection can perhaps be better understood in light of other great collections of German Expres- sionist art in both Germany and the United States. The earliest collec- tions were formed by contemporaries of the movement who were often friends of the artists. These include the collections of Walter Hess of Erfurt, Markus Kruss of Berlin, and Gustav Schiefler of Hamburg. Of these only the Kruss collection has remained relatively intact; parts of it can be seen today at the Bayerische Staatsgemaldesammlungen in Mu- nich, which acquired it by bequest. More extraordinary is the history of the collection formed by Sofie and Emanuel Fohn, painters living in Rome. The Fohns had assembled a collection of German Romantic draw- ings, which they were able to offer the Nazis during the \"degenerate art\" campaign of 1937 in exchange for the protection of their collection of Ex- pressionist masterworks. Today their paintings and watercolors are part of the collection of the Staatsgalerie Moderne-Kunst in Munich. Like other great, publicly minded collectors, the Fohns saw themselves as trustees of their collection, and it was inevitable that it would be given to the public. Other important collections reflect the collectors' love of a particular aspect of Expressionism. In Saint Louis Morton D. May, un- der the influence of Max Beckmann, amassed an extensive painting col- lection, which today is the core of the Saint Louis Art Museum's holdings of German Expressionist paintings. More recently it was announced that the collection of Jacob and Ruth Kainen of Washington, D.C., a fine group of Expressionist prints, would become part of the National Gal- lery's holdings. In Germany the collection of Expressionist paintings and prints formed after the war by Lothar-Giinther Buchheim remains an independent collection. The collection assembled by Robert Gore Rifkind since 1971 distinguishes itself from those already mentioned in a unique way: it A Salute is an extensive and systematically built print collection, which traces in a comprehensive way the development of German Expressionism in the graphic arts and is supplemented by a very complete library. For Rifkind, a lawyer who has long been attracted to a systematic way of thinking, the formation of a collection of this type may be especially appropriate. He has also collected masterworks of Expressionist painting and has formed one of the most comprehensive collections of German Expressionist sculpture as well as an extensive collection of German posters from the early twentieth century. But when one speaks of the Rifkind collection, it is immediately understood that one means that unique combination of prints, drawings, and primary and secondary literature that is now housed in the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It is interesting that the library of works on German Expressionism and twentieth-century art formed by Wilhelm F. Arntz is now part of the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, also in Los Angeles. Yet the Arntz library is quite different; it is a great personal library, not one built as systematically and carefully as the Rifkind collection. It remains an extraordinary phenomenon that in 1971 a Jewish lawyer, a third-generation resident of Los Angeles, decided to col- lect German Expressionist graphic art and from the very beginning also collected illustrated books and periodicals, literature of the era, and important interpretative and descriptive writings on art. All this was care- fully collected, documented, conserved, and catalogued. His ambition was great and his goal, a distinguished one. Yet this goal could not be attained alone in occasional weekend and evening hours. It was necessary to find advisers and colleagues. These were found, and they were of the highest quality. Rifkind cast a wide net and drew into it all those con- cerned with German Expressionism: collectors, dealers, auctioneers, schol- ars, and interested admirers. Overcome by his passion, these advisers have devoted their expertise and experience to the fulfillment of his ambi- tious goal. But what was and has remained Rifkind's cause? It is first and foremost the collecting itself. But there is more. Sometimes it seems to me as if he, the lawyer, were conducting a trial, methodically assem- bling the witnesses and the evidence. This always impressed me when- ever I had the opportunity to do research in the original study center, which was housed within Rifkind's law offices in Beverly Hills. Now, with the transfer of the collection to the museum and the opening of the new study center, the situation is different. Yet the collecting process contin- ues. It was a wise decision to entrust this collection to a bigger institution whose mandate is the preservation of works of art; for now future genera- tions will benefit from its richness and complexity.

They are not only remarkable creative achieve- ments by individual artists but, of equal importance, documents of what must be called the Expressionist movement. Even a cursory glance at the holdings shows clearly that they do not represent a single style. A study of the painting, sculpture, literature, theater, music, dance, and film of this period only reinforces this. Neither in form nor in content is there a com- monality that would permit a stylistic definition. Yet there was an underlying trend, a shared vision of the world, that allied many artists with the Expressionist movement. At its roots it consisted of two specific and seemingly diametric positions. One was a profound no to the parent generation, the dominant historicism, the restrictive patterns of society, and the strains caused by rampant industrialization and the materialism that accompanied it. The other was a deep-seated hope for a revolutionary change that would bring greater freedom for the arts, a truly humane existence for all, and a brotherhood of man, which pronounced an equally emphatic yes. This hope was grounded in the belief that the arts could bring about change by making the viewer, reader, or listener a participant in the building of a better society. A virtually religious or spiritual attitude toward life and freedom underlay the Expressionist movement. It appears difficult at first to understand the no, since the German Empire, barely thirty years old, was politically stable, had adopted advanced social laws, and was undergoing rapid economic growth and phenomenally swift industrialization (aided by indemnities imposed on France after Germany's victory in 1871). The administrators and politicians were not corrupt, and their prestige was nearly as high as that of the military. Nationalistic pride was evident everywhere. There were, however, problems behind this impressive facade that caused the younger generation to rebel. Industrialization had brought about the rapid growth of cities in which the individual lived in virtual anonymity. The urban population had grown from about two million in 1871 to more than fourteen million by 1910.' The grimy facades of the ugly, dark apart- ment houses in which the majority of the workers lived, often in deplora- ble conditions, stood in sharp contrast to the palatial villas and grandiose apartment houses to which the upper middle class retreated. It was this bourgeoisie, with its eagerness to maintain the status quo, that set the rules of everyday life for its own segment of society while paying little attention to the masses. In this patriarchal society the unquestioned authority of the \"higher rank\" was considered a praiseworthy value. Sus- tained by William 11, the aristocracy retained at least a visual prominence, although it had lost much of its economic strength and the idea that rank and intelligence were not inseparable had begun to surface. Although most of the artists who were part of the Expres- sionist movement came from the dominant middle class, their no was directed against the predictability of life that society treasured. They rejected the measurement of progress in material terms, derided the value accorded possessions, and spurned reliance on historical examples in dealing with contemporary issues.

The Expressionist movement's yes was for a different world, a better world, a world in which the emotions of the individual were important, even sacred, and in which injustices and social inequities were eliminated. This Utopian vision was vague since the young artists shared neither a common philos- ophy (although Nietzsche's influence cannot be overlooked) nor a specific political program. While their various nos can be defined quite clearly, their yes remained general and was stated mostly in emotional terms. The Expressionist movement began inconspicuously in Dresden, the rather provincial capital of the kingdom of Saxony, on June 7, 1905, when four former architecture students decided that work in the visual arts could give them the creative freedom that architecture, with its prevalent historicism, could not.

They formed a community they called the Briicke (bridge), in which they learned with and from one another. They were eager to find forms that would not so much imitate nature as make visible on paper and canvas their emotional responses to it. Their works were to be documents of per- sonal perception and feeling, permitting the viewer to see even familiar sights with new eyes. They taught themselves to sketch quickly, concen- trating on significant form and choosing bright colors to enhance emo- tional appeal. It was not accidental that they discovered the power of the woodcut, with its inherent demand for abbreviation; its imposition of pure, flat colors; and thus its innate requirement for deformation. These young men did for the first time what most later groups in the Expressionist movement would do from then on: state their fundamental concepts and goals in a manifesto (see fig. 2). \"With faith in evolution, in a new generation of creators and art lovers, we call together all youtli, and as youth, which bears the future, we want to gain freedom of move- ment and life against die weU-enbenched older forces. Eveiyone who renders what impels him to create direcdy and without adulteration is one of us.\"^ Their appeal won a few new members.

Small exhibitions in 1906, two of them in a lamp-factory show- room, elicited few responses, and their first larger exhibition, in 1907 at the reputable Galerie Emil Richter in Dresden, earned mostly negative criticisrii. Traveling shows were sent to any gallery that would have them. Yet the large number of graphic works and paintings that the group pro- duced in various studios (a former butcher's shop and later a cobbler's shop) indicates the strength of their creativity and determination. Their stylistic innovations are most evident in representations of the nude and the landscape (see figs. 4, 97), which defied the idealization and academic posturing of the past by depicting freely moving human forms in colors that heightened the underlying eros and made them appear as essential parts of their surroundings.

Shortly thereafter the others also left the staid city of Dresden for vibrant Berlin. By this time, however, each was beginning to find his own style, and the group dissolved in 1913. Each became a significant force in the Expressionist movement on his own. The history of the Briicke artists consists therefore of two parts. Between 1905 and 1911 they were influenced by the artists of the Jugendstil (the German version of Art Nouveau), Vincent van Gogh, the Fauves, and especially Edvard Munch, and they developed a short-lived communal approach. Their later works cannot be associated with the Briicke; individual biographies and achievements demand a different focus. During the first period the young artists tried to gain sup- port and enlisted \"passive\" members, to whom they offered annual port- folios of prints with a report of their exhibition activities. The published membership list of 1907 includes eight active and twenty-nine passive mem- bers, a number that increased to forty-eight in 1909 and reached sLxty-eight in 1910 (see fig. 3). The names of the supporters (six lived in Switzerland, one in Sweden, the rest in Germany) furnish a clue to where these young artists found acceptance: among open-minded middle-class intellectuals.^ While the artists of the Briicke developed a new vision in their works, poets and writers also began to search for new themes and forms of expression. In 1909 the polemicist Kurt Hiller formed Der neue Club (the new club) in Berlin and shortly thereafter the public Neopathetisches Cabaret (see fig. 5), in which young poets read their works to one another and to a public that at first considered them laugh- able entertainment.\"* The list of participants forms a Who's Who of early Expressionist poetry: Ernst Blass, Paul Boldt, Golo Gangi (Erwin Loew- enson), Georg Heym, Alfred Lichtenstein, Ernst Stadler, and Jakob van Hoddis (Hans Davidsohn), whose poem \"Weltende\" (End of the world), published in 1911, the poet Gottfried Benn considered the beginning of literary Expressionism. Johannes R. Becher, another important early E.xpressionist poet, recalled that this poem \"elevated us out of a world of dull bourgeoisie, which we despised and which we did not know how to leave.'^The poem became the first in the famous anthology Menschheits- ddmnieriing (Twilight of humanity), in which many of the important Expressionist poems written prior to 1919 were assembled. ^The editor of this epochal collection, Kurt Pinthus, divided the poems into four groups that categorized the dominant moods of the poets: fall and scream, awak- ening the heart, appeal and redemption, and love for humanity. Other anthologies proclaimed the same emotions, as their titles indicate: Die Gemeinschaft (The community, 1919), Kameraden der Menschheit (Com- rades of humanity, 1919), Die Botschaft (The message, 1920), Verkiln- dung (Annunciation, 1921), and Die Entfaltung (The unfolding, 1921).'^ The main vehicles through which the poets reached their public were two important journals founded just a year apart, one in 1910 and the other in 1911. Herwarth Walden, after editing a number of other journals, founded Der Sturm (The storm), whose title was suggested by his first wife, the notable poet Else Lasker-Schiiler. In the pages of this remarkable publication the new poetry and prose were combined with Guenther Oskar Kokoschka Austria, 1886-1980 Morder: Hoffnung der Frauen. 1910 (Murderer: Hope of women) Reproduction of a drawing 15 X ii'/i in.

Some illustrations were originals printed from woodblocks; others were reproductions, among which portraits by Oskar Kokoschka as well as drawings accompanying his drama Morder, Hoff- nung der Frauen (Murderer, hope of women; see fig. 6) were the most outstanding in the early issues. Walden and his various assistants (Lothar Schreyer, for example, and the well-known reciter Rudolf Bliimner) became the self-appointed spokesmen for the Expressionist movement as they understood it. Intolerant of other interpretations of the new arts, they engaged in heated arguments, especially about aesthetics, which oc- cupied increasing space in the journal. Without Der Sturm the Expres- sionist movement would have lacked one of its most significant voices. A slightly different trend was followed by Die Aktion (Action; see fig. 7), subtitled \"weekly for politics, literature, arts.\" Franz Pfemfert, its only editor, was the first to combine politics with the arts. From its beginnings and increasingly over the years, the journal dis- played pronounced socialist tendencies. Pfemfert at first supported the Spartakus Bund (Spartacus league), the most radical of the Communist factions, and welcomed the Russian Revolution of 1917, but he later became as outspoken an opponent of the Communist party as he had been of the First World War.

(32.4 X 15.9 cm) M. 82.288. 106 Davis 1363 Die Aktion and Der Sturm covered all aspects of the Ex- pressionist movement. They published the new literature and art, they criti- cized public institutions as well as individuals if they were not progressive, and they reported on and criticized, sometimes savagely, the theater and other artistic activities if they did not support the new direction. In their different ways both journals were strongholds of the movement. While these publications made Berlin the center of Expressionist polemics, another aspect of the movement within the visual arts developed in Munich. It began in 1896, when a Russian named Wassily Kandinsky gave up a promising academic career and moved to Munich to become a painter. Having studied with various teachers and become acquainted with the modern French schools, he began a career of extraordinary creativity.* After freeing his work from the restrictions of Jugendstil, he achieved a style that permitted the omission of recogniz- able objects (see figs. 8, 9) and thus by 1910 had significantly contributed to the Expressionist movement. The burst of energy to which his biog- raphy bears witness led to the formation in 1909 of an influential artists' group, the Neue Kiinstlervereinigung Miinchen (new artists' association Munich), or NKVM. The following year he was instrumental in present- ing to the Munich public within an exhibition of this group the first large- scale show of modern French and Russian artists. The list of participants remains impressive. Georges Braque, Andre Derain, van Dongen, Henri Le Fauconnier, Pablo Picasso, Georges Rouault, and Maurice de Vla- minck were shown side by side with Vladimir Bechtejeff, David and Vladimir Burliuk, Wassily Denissoff, Moyssey Kogan, Alexander Mogilewski, and the Munich painters whom Kandinsky had united in the NKVM: Alexej von Jawlensky, Gabriele Miinter, Marianne von Werefkin, and others. Quarrels ensued the following year, and in December 1911 Kandinsky, Alfred Kubin, Franz Marc, and Miinter left the group, imme- diately planning a counterexhibition, since the artistic differences within the group had become irreconcilable and a break inevitable when Kandinsky's Composition v was rejected by the jury. During the same year Kandinsky and Marc worked on an almanac that they envisioned as a voice for the new arts. They used its proposed title to announce the Erste Atisstellung der Redaktion der \"Blaue Reiter\" (First exhibition of the editors of Der blaue Reiter). It was not a large exhibition, consisting of only forty-three works, including two by Henri Rousseau, who had died in 1910, and five by Robert Delaunay. Kandinsky, after hearing a concert of Arnold Schonberg's music, initiated an exchange of letters with the composer.^ He felt a commonality in their strivings and insisted that three of Schonberg's paintings, a self-portrait and two works called Vision, be included in the show. The other works were by Kandinsky's friends Albert Bloch, the Burliuks, Heinrich Campendonk, Elisabeth Epstein, Eugen Kahler, August Macke, Marc, Miinter, and Jean Bloe Niestle. Although the exhibition was significant, the almanac Der blaue Reiter (The blue rider, 1912; fig. 10) became one of the most impor- tant documents of modern art. 1° While the Briicke had begun as a com- munity of artists, the Blaue Reiter consisted only of Kandinsky and Marc (with the support of Macke), both of whom attracted individuals who had Guenther Wassily Kandinsky Russia, 1866-1944 Lyrisches, 1911 (Lyrical) Color woodcut 5\"/i6 X 8'/2 in. (14.5 X 21.6 cm) From Wassily Kandinsky, Kldnge 83.1.102.5 Davis 1368.3 already developed their own styles and approaches. In short, the Blaue Reiter was not a community, and the participants' styles were as different as their personalities. A statement in the catalogue of the first exhibition ex- pressed the group's philosophy; \"We wish to propagate in this small exhibi- tion not one precise and special form, but we intend in the variety of the forms represented to show how the inner wish of the artists expresses itself.\"^^ This acceptance of diversity was based on a concept that was central to the Expressionist movement: the Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art), which found its finest expression in Der blaue Reiter. Assem- bled in its 143 pages were theoretical essays, discourses on the modern arts, explorations of modern music, an introduction to modern Russian painting, as well as musical scores by Schonberg and his most famous students, Alban Berg and Anton von Webern (see figs, ii, 12). The span of the articles was remarkable, and the 144 illustrations represented an astounding new view of the arts. Reproductions of sculptural works from Africa and Mexico were interspersed with paintings by Paul Cezanne, Henri Matisse, Picasso, members of the Briicke (Kirchner, Mueller, Pechstein), children's drawings, Bavarian paintings on glass, Egyptian shadow-play figures, and Renaissance woodcuts. Much space was devoted Guenther 11 Alban Berg at his home in Vienna, with a portrait of him by Arnold Schonberg, c. 1932 Anton Webern, 1911 to Kandinsky's article \"Uber Biihnenkomposition\" (Concerning stage composition), followed by his play Der gelbe Klang (The yellow sound). The lead article by Marc, entitled \"Geistige Giiter\" (Spiritual goods), la- mented the general lack of interest in spiritual values and also expressed the editors' belief that their ideas were elements of a new movement whose \"vibrations were felt all over the world. \" Using the term Wilden (wild ones), obviously a reference to the French Fauves, Marc nearly re- peated the manifesto of the Briicke in another article: \"In our epoch of the great battle for the new arts, we fight as wild ones against an old, or- ganized power. The fight seems uneven, but in spiritual matters it is never the number but the strength of ideas that will be victorious. \"^^ Among the other \"wild ones,\" he listed the Briicke (with which Kandinsky had had connections since 1906, when he sent woodcuts to their graphics exhibition in the lamp factory); the Berlin Neue Sezession (new seces- sion), formed in 1910 by Pechstein, his Briicke friends, and other Expres- sionist artists as a counterorganization to the more conservative Sezession; and even the NKVM. Each of the artists in these groups used different forms, Marc stated, but all desired \"to create through their works symbols for their times, which belong on the altars of the coming spiritual religion and behind which their technical creator will disappear.\" In the draft of an announcement he repeated, \"[The Blaue Reiter] shall be the call that summons the artists who belong to this new time, and it shall awaken the ears of the laymen.\" The second Blaue Reiter exhibition, held in Munich in 1912, was called Der blaue Reiter: Schwarz-Weiss (The blue rider: Black and white) and presented 315 graphic works in a wide variety of styles. In the same year Kandinsky's important theoretical work Uber das Geistige in der Kunst (Concerning the spiritual in art; fig. 13) was published by Reinhard Piper in Munich. ^^ Along with the various manifestos and the Blaue Reiter almanac, which express the mood as well as the spirit of the young artists, this small booklet has become an often quoted and studied document of the Expressionist movement. By this time Expressionist works of art were being shown in several galleries. The first Blaue Reiter exhibition, for instance, went from Munich to the Gereonsclub in Cologne and from there to Der Sturm in Berlin, the gallery that Walden had opened to provide a showcase for the artists whom he supported in his journal. In 1913 this gallery showed the largest international modern art exhibition ever held in Germany and called it, following the French example, Erster deutsche Herbstsalon (First German autumn salon). Seventy-five artists from twelve countries contributed 366 works, which represented all of the contemporary styles, including Expressionism. Although the latter remained primarily a Ger- man development, it had become obvious to critics and the public that the \"old\" arts had found successful challengers in all of Europe. At the openings for his exhibitions (he organized more than two hundred, many of which traveled to other galleries in Germany and abroad) as well as at his later soirees, Walden propagated the Gesamt- kunstwerk by offering recitations from works of authors published in the journal and performances of contemporary music. (Walden himself was a gifted pianist who had won the Liszt Prize; he composed a number of Guenther Wassily Kandinsky Russia, 1866-1944 Holzschnitt fur den Ahnanach \"Der hlaue Reiter,\" 1911 (Woodcut for the almanac Der blaue Reiter) Color woodcut (electrotype) 11 X 8\"/\"' in.

In short, Expressionist hterature and music as well as painting and graphics found support in Berhn. Other galleries had also begun to present works by the still-controversial artists. Gallery own- ers Paul Cassirer, Fritz Gurlitt, and I. B. Neumann became spokesmen for their artists and thus for the movement. But it was not only in Berlin that these new works could be seen. In Munich the Blaue Reiter exhib- ited in the Heinrich Thannhauser and Hans Goltz galleries, and in Dres- den Emil Richter and Ernst Arnold provided space for the former Briicke members and other contemporary artists. Many gallery owners, including Alfred Flechtheim in Diisseldorf, Karl Nierendorf in Cologne, and Lud- wig Schames in Frankfurt, were eager to show new works just as publish- ers such as Ernst Rowohlt and Kurt Wolff in Leipzig, A. R. Meyer and Erich Reiss in Berlin, and R. Weissbach in Heidelberg were eager to print the new poetry and prose. It was a hectic period, and although the general public still rejected and derided Expressionism, new voices were heard and new images were seen. The Expressionist movement had gained a strong foothold in the artistic life of Germany. And then the war broke out. The year 1914 was a true caesura, a divide; a wave of patriotism that quickly became chauvinistic engulfed all of Europe and especially Germany. Many writers and artists welcomed the war, includ- ing Alfred Doblin, Rudolf Leonhard, Ernst Wilhelm Lotz, Thomas Mann, and Paul Zech. Marc's diaries and letters echoed this sentiment. Many artists volunteered, as they and countless others believed that the war would be short and would truly bring about a totally new beginning. Although, as expected, artistic activity declined because of censorship and the scarcity of paper and canvas, there were still exhibitions. Der Sturm and Die Aktion continued pubhcation; the latter strongly opposed the war from early on. Kandinsky returned to Moscow, and Jawlensky and Werefkin moved to Switzerland, but other artists were able to remain active in Germany. In the Red Cross unit led by the art historian and curator Walter Kaesbach, Heckel, Otto Herbig, Max Kaus, Anton Kerschbaumer, and others found time to paint. The early news of German victories on all fronts that had fanned so much enthusiasm was soon replaced by tragic accounts. Macke had died, as had Lotz, Marc, Wilhelm Morgner, Stadler, and Georg Trakl. The list grew steadily. Accounts of victories became rare, and by 1916 the number of dead and maimed changed the public's mood. At home hunger stalked the streets of the cities, and hopes for a new world grew dimmer. One example of this change must suffice: in 1914 Paul Cassirer, the gallery owner and publisher, initiated a series of illustrated broadsides entitled Kriegszeit: Kunstlerflugbldtter (Wartime: Artists' broadsides), which were prowar, chauvinistic, and popular. Many of the better-known artists, such as August Gaul, Otto Hettner, and Max Liebermann, contributed, as did Ernst Barlach, Germany's greatest sculptor and an extraordinary graphic artist, writer, and dramatist, who had been represented by Cassirer since 1907. Among the eleven works that Barlach published in 1914 and 1915 were lithographs that suggest that he was following the chauvinistic trend. In issue number 17 a print entitled Der heilige Krieg (The holy war; fig. 14) appeared, and in number 20, Erst Sieg, dann Frieden (First victory, then peace). In 1916, however, 10 Guenther 14 Ernst Barllach Germany, 1870-1938 Der heilige Krieg, 1914 (The holy war) Lithograph i6V<i X 10 in. (41.3 X 25.4 cm) From Kriegszeit, no. 17 (1914) 83.1.1416 c Davis 74 Cassirer recognized the changed mood and appointed a new editor, the well-known musicologist and pacifist Leo Kestenberg, and changed the title of the publication to the more neutral Der Bildermann: Stein- zeichnungen fiirs deutsche Volk (The picture man: Lithographs for the German people). By then Barlach too saw the war differently. In issue number 14 of Der Bildermann, his lithograph bears the title Anno Domini MCMXVi post Christum natiwi (The year of our Lord 1916; fig. 15) and shows a figure of Christ confronted by the Tempter, who points to a vast landscape filled with crosses on the graves of soldiers. Two issues later Barlach s print Selig sind die Barmherzigen (Blessed are the merciful) appeared, and in number 18 a symbolic kneeling figure is presented, with the title Dona nobis pacem (Give us peace; fig. 16). The Expressionist movement was stalled: Kirchner was hospitalized with a nervous condition. Max Beckmann had been fur- loughed after a collapse, Kokoschka was recovering from a wound he had received a year earlier, Karl Hofer was interned in France, and Pechstein was in Palau. Rene Schickele had moved his pacifist journal Die weissen Blatter (The white papers) to Bern, and Hugo Ball had left Germany for Zurich, where he founded the Cabaret Voltaire, the birthplace of the Dada movement. The horrors of the war became more visible every day. The growing strength of the Allies, the hunger and deprivation at home, mounting strikes in industry, and the mutiny of the navy brought the Ger- man war effort to an end. Within days an uprising swept over Germany, the kaiser and various princes and dukes resigned, and on November 9, 1918, the birth of the German Republic was proclaimed. Nobody, how- ever, seemed to have made any plans for this event. In the streets of the larger cities armed battles broke out between political factions, each of which had a different concept of this new Germany. The political left was deeply divided. Some wanted to duplicate the Russian form of govern- ment using a system of Rate, or councils (the Russian Revolution of 1917 had made a great impression as a possible model for Germany), while another faction wanted a socialistic republic. The new government was unable to quell the unrest and called on the political right to volunteer for quasimilitary service in the Freikorps (armed volunteer corps), which brutally suppressed various uprisings and protest marches. The artists who had expressed their fervent hope for an end to the war in their works were ready to help build the new society. Even before the election for the Constitutional Assembly had been announced (November 29, 1918), the young artists had made their pres- ence felt in the political arena. On November 9 a group of writers appeared in the parliamentary building in Berlin under the leadership of Hiller, the founder of the Neopathetisches Cabaret and the later Aktivis- ten Bund (activist league) and publisher of the yearbook Das Ziel (The goal). They established themselves with the permission of the Arbeiter- und Soldatenrat (workers' and soldiers' council) as Rat geistiger Arbeiter (council of intellectual workers). This group presented a radical, socialist political program that had been signed by many writers, artists, and intel- lectuals. The council, self-appointed and self-renewing, wanted to be- come the intellectual counterpart of the provisional government and its 11 Guenther ^ergBtrdetmaim z>evA7^iU>txmam Nil* iy e rau s ^ eye fen ao.OffoStr,t9tf EUSTtK. fAHAOANt fSTEINZtlCHNUNGEN FUllS DEUTSCHE VOLK ANNO DOMINI MCMXVl POSTCHW5TVM NATVM -%i^2ar-*=' ^ e raus j eyeSen p aut tafftrer iO.Stjmttr, iSii 16 15 Ernst Bariach Germany, 1S70— 1938 Anno Domini mcmwi post Christum natwn, 1916 (The year of our Lord 1916) Lithograph 7^16 X g'/j in.

The organization existed through the middle of 1919 and weathered a number of internal disagree- ments, yet it remained powerless and isolated from the government. Al- though the activist wing of the Expressionist movement existed for only a short time, many of its ideas later became law even without its participa- tion. (Several such councils existed in Munich, where Heinrich Mann was the president, and in Dresden, Hamburg, Leipzig, and other cities. Their effectiveness, however, was minimal.) Another council made its appearance at the same time. The Arbeitsrat fiir Kunst (working council for art) was formed by a group of architects, painters, sculptors, and critics who had a common goal: \"Art and people must form a unity. The arts shall no longer be just the delight of the few, but the happiness and life of the masses. The unification of all of the arts under the wings of a great architecture is the goal. \"''* Among the founders were many prominent Berlin Expressionists. Two outstand- ing architects— Bruno Taut and, slightly later, Walter Gropius— the painter and stage designer Cesar Klein, and the critic Adolf Behne formed the executive committee. On the board were former members of the Briicke, including Heckel, Pechstein, and Schmidt-Rottluff; the sculptors Georg Kolbe and Gerhard Marcks; the painter and poet Ludwig Meidner; Heinrich Richter-Berlin; and many others. A committee as- signed the task of recruiting additional adherents consisted of Lyonel Feininger, Otto Freundlich, Karl Jakob Hirsch, and Georg Tappert, among others. They proclaimed: \"The most important task for the imme- diate future . . . lies in the common planning of a comprehensive Utopian building project that should combine in equal parts architecture, sculp- ture, and painting.'i^ 12 Guenther 17 Hans Luckhantt Germany, 1890-1954 Sketch for the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum, Dresden, 1920 While rejecting governmental interference, the Arbeits- rat demanded that the new government recognize that all building activi- ties were of a public nature and thus a cultural activity in which the council was to participate. In every town Volkshduser (peoples' houses) were to be erected, which would have the task of introducing the people to all of the arts, especially the modern arts. The council also demanded that museums be reorganized, that lectures be given to all museum visi- tors, and that more exhibition space be made available. Aware of the public's reluctance to accept modern art, the council emphasized its edu- cational program, demanding the complete restructuring of all art schools and academies. \"Convinced that political change must be used to free the arts from decades of tutelage, \" it also called for the destruction of all \"artistically valueless\" monuments in public spaces and an immediate end to the planning of war museums. '^ Among the council's first activities were the distribution of a radical architectural program by Taut and a manifesto by P. R. Henning demanding greater use of terra-cotta for sculpture as well as in and on buildings; an exhibition for the \"unknown architect \"; and the pub- lication of a booklet, Riifzum Baiien (Call to building), with an introduc- tion by Behne. Due to the cessation of construction during the war, many of the Utopian plans and models designed by architects allied with the movement were now introduced to the public for the first time. Some of these, by Hermann Finsterlin, Wenzel A. Hablik, Carl Krayl, Hans and Wassily Luckhardt, and others, remain impressive to this day (see fig. 17). It had to be expected that the press and the public were startled by what they perceived as the impracticality of these plans. Far more important and indicative of the shared goals within the Expressionist movement was a booklet entitled Ja! Stimmen des Arbeitsratesfiir Kiinst in Berlin (Yes! Voices of the working council for art in Berlin; fig. 18), which contained answers to a questionnaire that had been sent to many artists in the spring of 1919.'''' The artists\" proposals embraced a wide range of topics, including reforms of the education of 13 Guenther ^ AR.BeiT>RAT£3 FUR.

The Arbeitsrat tried to translate many of the Expressionist dreams into reality. Since neither the populace nor the government reacted positively, it merged in 1921 with another group formed during the 1918 revolution, the Novem- bergruppe (November group), which took its name from the month of the revolution, when hopes for the construction of a new state and a new society were still intact. ^^ Unlike the Arbeitsrat, the Novembergruppe never intended to be more than an organization of \"radical artists, radical in the use of new means of expression. \" The letter sent to prospective members began: \"The future of the arts and the seriousness of this hour forces us revolutionary artists of the spirit (Expressionists, Cubists, Euturists) to unity and close association.\" The executive committee consisted of Rudolf Belling, Klein, Moriz Melzer, Pechstein, Richter-Berlin, Tappert, and others. They declared that they wanted to be more than just an exhibition organization; their aim was to influence all artistic questions that the new republic would face. Paralleling much of the program of the Arbeitsrat, they announced, in addition to an annual exhibition each November, sev- eral publications and performances of modern music. It is not surprising that many members of the Novembergruppe (which lasted, albeit as an exhibition organization, until the 1930s) had also been members of the Arbeitsrat or signatories of its program. Both organizations as well as the Rat geistiger Arbeiter were part of the Expressionist movement, and the majority of their members were Expressionists. It was not by accident that the opening sentences of the Novembergruppe manifesto read: \"We stand on the fruitful ground of the revolution. Our motto is: Ereedom— Equality— Brotherhood!\" Ten years after its formation the influential critic Will Grohmann recalled: \"The miracle happened— that, with very few exceptions, all artists felt [themselves] to be a community, morally obligated to believe in the goodness of man and to create the best possible world. That pathos was genuine and had an ethical accent. \"^^ The ter- minology used, the characteristic overstatement, and the Utopian goals were an integral part of the Expressionist movement. The pronouncements of the Arbeitsrat and the Novem- bergruppe reached other cities and towns, where new artists' groups were formed. Many, if not most, began with a manifesto, exhibitions, and a flurry of other artistic activities. There was Der Wurf (the throw) in Bielefeld, Die Schanze (the trench) in Miinster, Die Kugel (the sphere) in Halle, the Krafte (forces) group in Hamburg, Rih in Karlsruhe, Freie Be- wegung (free movement) in Vienna, and many others. The two that deserve special attention since they exemplify the variety within the Expressionist movement are the Dresden Sezession: Gruppe 1919 (Dresden secession: group 1919) and Das junge Rheinland (the young Rhineland). The Dresden group was typical of postwar artists' orga- nizations: a small group of very young artists began to meet at the end of 1916 and called themselves Expressionistische Arbeitsgemeinschaft (Expressionist working group). They were painters, poets, writers, and Friihzeitig von der Neuen Kanst gepackt, erkaimte ich in ihr meiiien Weg. Sludierte schnell, um zu gestalten, was mich bewegte.

Beginning in January 1918 they found an outlet for their ideas in the characteris- tically expressionistic journal Menschen (Humanity; see fig. 19). The Gruppe 1919 was officially formed shortly after the Novembergruppe and announced that it was \"founded by a number of artists who wished to realize ideal projects that— like their art— necessarily separated them from previous artists. Basic principles are: truth— brotherhood— art. '^° In the catalogue for the group's first exhibition, at the Galerie Emil Richter, the artists repeated the familiar no as well as yes, stating that the group was formed out of the \"inner necessity to take final leave of the old ways and means\" and that the members considered them- selves \"mature [enough] to take on the leadership of the young local forces.\"2i Soon, however, internal dissension disrupted the group. Con- rad Felixmiiller, the guiding spirit of the group, was convinced that only in connection with a strong political force could they expect to transform their hopes into reality and that this required membership in the Com- munist party. While Constantin von Mitschke-Collande sided with Fehxmiiller for a while, the others refused to take this step. Otto Dix, Wilhelm Heckrott, Otto Lange, and Lasar Segall continued to exhibit with the group and were later joined by Gela Forster, Christoph Voll, and others. Peter August Bockstiegel (Felixmliller's brother-in-law). Otto Schubert, and the architect Hugo Zehder left for personal reasons. Even Felixmliller's political-artistic drive vanished not long thereafter. The journal Menschen remained important, but even there the change from the revolutionary to the purely artistic did not take long. In its first issues the editors stated that it was \"the expression of poets, writers, painters, and musicians for whom the arts were a means to change man\" and only slightly later expanded its concept to include what \"in literature, painting, music, and criticism is called Expressionism . . . and in politics ... a national socialism.\" In March 1919 the word \"politics\" was dropped from the masthead, and in September 1920 the new editor, Walter Hasenclever, simply informed its readers: \"We begin the editor- ship of this journal under the condition of strict political neutrality.\" The history of the Gruppe 1919 and Menschen illustrates the speed with which the mood among artists changed. Berlin, Dresden, and Munich had produced very dif- ferent strands of the Expressionist movement. It was therefore to be expected that the movement's development in the Rhineland would like- wise take a different form. There the first important event was the exhibi- tion held in Cologne in 1912 by the Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Kiinstler (special association of west German friends of art and artists), which proclaimed in its exhibition catalogue that it pro- vided an overview of \"that movement that has been called Expression- ism.\"22 Significant was the large number of works in this show by Ce- zanne, Paul Gauguin, van Gogh, and, among the living artists, Picasso. Many Expressionists were represented, including the former Briicke members (Heckel and Kirchner were given the honor of painting the chapel) and the artists who had exhibited with the Blaue Reiter. (It was this exhibition that sparked the famous Armory Show of 1913 in New 16 Guenther 1919-1923 Cover oi Staatliches Buuhaus in Weimar, 1919-1923 83.1.41 York.) It remained an isolated event, however, because the organizing group disbanded in 1915. In January 1918 another group, Das junge Rheinland, made its appearance with an exhibition called Rheinische Expressionisten (Rhenish Expressionists), in which Heinrich Campendonk, E. M. Engert, Max Ernst, Otto Freundlich, Franz Henseler, Heinrich Nauen, and others participated. Macke, who had died in the war, was repre- sented by thirty paintings. It is noteworthy that this group was consider- ably less demonstrative and that its emphasis on politics was far weaker than that of the Novembergruppe and many other groups.-^ In 1922 Das junge Rheinland became instrumental in forming the Kartell fort- schrittlicher Kiinstlergruppen in Deutschland (cartel of progressive art- ists' groups in Germany), in which the Gruppe 1919 as well as the Novem- bergruppe and the Darmstadter Sezession (Darmstadt secession) also participated. The only political platform that the group retained was the demand for the immediate dissolution of the art academies. The Expres- sionist movement had lost its revolutionary impetus in the Rhineland. That the call for the dissolution of the art academies was still on the agenda is intriguing because this was one of the few demands of the radical artists' groups that were realized, in the form of the estab- lishment of the state-supported Bauhaus in Weimar, a truly new and inno- vative school.-'* In 1919 Gropius was able to persuade the government of Thuringia to allow him to combine the Grossherzogliche Hochschule fiir bildende Kunst (grand-ducal high school for fine arts) and the Grossher- zogliche Kunstgewerbeschule (grand-ducal school for applied arts) into a single institution. He hired an extraordinary faculty that shocked the populace of Weimar and delighted the Expressionists: Feininger, Johan- nes Itten, and Marcks. Later additions included Kandinsky, Paul Klee, 21 Oskar Schlemmer Germany, 1888-1943 Die erste Bauhaus Ausstellung in Weimar, Juli his September 192.3. 1923 (The first Bauhaus exhibition in Weimar, July to September 1923) Publicity pamphlet written and designed by Schlemmer jVb X 2^Vb in.

The pamphlet in which Gropius announced the program of the new school echoed statements made by the Arbeitsrat and the Novembergruppe: \" 'The final aim of all artistic activity is building.' Let us desire, conceive, and create together the new struc- ture of the future, which shall be all in one form— architecture and sculp- ture and painting— and which will one day rise toward heaven from the hands of a million workers as the crystalline symbol of a new and coming faith. \" The pamphlet's cover was a woodcut by Feininger depicting a crys- 17 Guenther talline cathedral (fig. 23). The accomphshments of the Bauhaus during the years in Weimar and after 1923 in Dessau are too well known to require an extended account. That the school's approach to the education of artists and designers was innovative is unquestionable, yet it should be noted that architecture did not become a part of the curriculum until after the move to Dessau. By that time, however, the Expressionist ardor had dis- sipated, and a new, Constructivist-influenced approach had gained the upper hand.

The young artists who founded these groups proclaimed in manifestos and programs that their art was no longer pretty, decorative, or imitative in nature, but was a philosophical, spiritual, or even political statement. These artists were willing to subordinate their individuality by exhibiting with like- minded colleagues and friends. By presenting a common front, they would demonstrate to gallery owners, museums, critics, and the public that their vision of man and the world was a shared one. While most of the Expressionist breakthroughs in the visual arts and in literature occurred before the war, the horrors of war and the restrictions imposed during wartime make the stridency of these groups' revolutionary pronounce- ments understandable. To make a movement out of a \"trend \" (if that term may be used for Expressionism), however, requires that the other arts follow a parallel course. Only a few groups were formed by poets and writers. We know of their endless discussions in coffeehouses, but the coherence of the visual artists within their groups remained singular. To attempt to find group structures among poets and writers by comparing the appearances of their works in the many journals and magazines of the era is not productive, since the same author can be found in different journals at the same time. Yet the titles of some of these publications do suggest a common denominator, since they reflect the direction of their editorial policies: Anbruch (Beginning), Feuer (Fire; fig. 26), Der Friede (Peace), Kiindung (Annunciation; fig. 24), Die Rettung (Deliverance), Revolution (fig. 25), Der Ruf (The call; fig. 28), and Der Weg (The way; fig. 27). The parallel to the titles of the poetry anthologies is obvious. A careful study of Der Sturm, Die Aktion, and some of the other periodicals reveals that the graphic works and the poems and stories published in them have little in common as far as content is concerned; they do, however, have the same roots. One can offer proof of the basic soundness of calling Expressionism a movement by sketching its develop- ment in an art form in which literature and the visual arts are combined, such as theater or film. The German theater always had a pronounced social function. The Expressionist theater frequently came close to being a pul- pit, a place from which the transformation of man and thus of society could be effected. 2^ The psychological dramas of Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Frank Wedekind were the forerunners of the later Expressionist dramas and, like them, suffered from censorship as well as a hostile public. They inspired their directors to develop a new kind of stagecraft, which became one of the characteristics of the plays within the Expressionist movement. The earliest of these new plays came, not surprisingly, from two great visual artists: Kokoschka, whose Morder, Hoffnung der Frauen (see fig. 32) was first performed in Vienna in 1907 and created a scandal (the second performance took place in Dresden in 1913 before an invited audience), and Barlach, whose Der tote Tag (The dead day, 1907-10) was first performed in Leipzig in 1919. Both plays included fea- tures that influenced many later playwrights, such as the transformation of specific characters into types and a stylized linguistic structure that 20 Guenther Ernst Deutsch in Walter Hasenclever's Der Sohn, Deutsches Landestheater, Prague (first performance, September 30, 1916) 30 Sketch for a production of Walter Hasenclever's Der Sohn, Stadttheater, Kiel (first performance, October 31, 1919; director: Gerhard Ausleger; set designer: Otto Reigbert) substituted a staccato of highly emotional statements accentuating the intensity of the action for the well-constructed explanatory sentences and dialogues of conventional drama. Ideas and psychological events v^^ere transformed into symbolic characters and actions. The Expressionist play- wrights saw themselves as visionaries, as prophets whose voices were raised for the Erneuerung des Menschen (regeneration of humanity). The importance of drama within the Expressionist move- ment was very great. The theater was once again a moral institution. Reinhard Sorge's Der Bettler (The beggar, 1912) portrays the transforma- tion of a young man, an incarnation of pure emotion, who kills his parents and then ascends to heaven, having freed himself from all bonds, even that of love. In importance this drama was paralleled by Hasenclever's Der Sohn (The son, 1914; see figs. 29, 30), in which a young man thirsts for self-determination. When his father has him brought home in hand- cuffs by the police, the son aims a pistol at the father, who dies of a heart attack. In Arnolt Bronnen's Vatermord (Patricide, 1915), the conflict was widened, and the influences of the social milieu and of genetic inheri- tance were accentuated. In Georg Kaiser's Die Burger von Calais (The burghers of Calais, 1914), which was inspired by Rodin's sculpture, sui- cide is interpreted as bravery if one willingly becomes a martyr for a good cause but not if one fights senselessly for one's honor. Schickele's once- famous Hans im Schnakenloch (Hans in Schnakenloch, 1920) revolves around an Alsatian's love for both France and Germany, a conflict that was well known in both countries. Like many other Expressionist plays, it emphasizes the ideals of pacifism and socialism. Merely to summarize the plays' content, however, makes little sense. Indeed Ernst Toller's deeply moving play. Die Wandlung (The transformation, 1919; see fig. 33), which the playwright completed while imprisoned for his activities in the Bavarian revolution, defies sum- mary. The play is essentially a lyrical monologue about the love of human- kind, calling on spectators to transform their lives; it is, in other words, a call for Utopia. In all of these plays and in many, many others, reality and dream, actual events and visions interact in new ways and establish new forms. The plays furiously denounce the past and the present (most were written before the war), and many project a redemption that relates them to the old mystery plays. The new plays required new directors and actors as well as new stage designers capable of translating the texts into appropriate visual forms. Some of the directors who made these plays famous and who in turn became famous by staging them have not been forgotten: Ludwig Berger, Jiirgen Fehling, Karl-Heinz Martin, Max Reinhardt, and Ber- thold Viertel, among others. The same holds true for the actors who became known for their performances in these dramas, for instance, Ernst Deutsch (see fig. 29), whose interpretation of Hasenclever's Der Sohn set a new standard. Heinrich George, Eugen Klopfer, Fritz Kort- ner, Werner Krauss, Gerda Miiller (see fig. 31), Agnes Straub, Alice Verden, and many others became personifications of these unconven- tional heroes and heroines. The stage designer's role gained new promi- nence, since the plays demanded new visual interpretations. Designers became something like codirectors, transforming stages into haunting 21 Guenther Gerda Miiller in Fritz von Unruh's Platz, Schauspielhaus, Frankfurt am Main (first perfor- mance.

Many of the works of designers such as Cesar Klein, Robert Nep- pach, Emil Pirchan, Otto Reigbert, Ludwig Sievert, and Ernst Stern are now known only from photographs and sketches (see fig. 34), most of which would fit perfectly into any Expressionist art exhibition. It was not only in Berlin that these new theatrical experi- ences were available. Theaters in Darmstadt, Diisseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Mannheim, and Munich also dared to confront the public with controversial plays. The theater critics of the larger newspapers traveled to the premieres of these plays and thus encouraged other directors to stage new works. That the theater was central to Expressionism becomes obvious when one recalls that as early as 1916 Hasenclever had demanded the \"stage for art, politics, and philosophy!\" terms that are at the core of the movement. ^^ 22 Guenther 35 Scene from Der Golem, directed by Paul Wegener, 1920 Scene from Nosferattt, directed by F.

Director Robert Wiene, writers Hans Jano- witz and Carl Mayer, designers Walter Reimann, Walter Rohrig, and Hermann Warm (who were allied with Der Sturm), and the actors Lil Dagover, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Werner Krauss, Hans Heinz von Twar- dowsky, and Conrad Veidt created an outstanding work of Expressionist art in this new medium. The original story was mellowed on the insis- tence of the producers, but the painted background decorations, the highly stylized performances, the costumes, and the makeup set an unfor- gettable mood. The film's graphic quality nearly overshadowed the horror story, with its themes of murder, hypnosis, somnambulism, and mental derangement. Doktor Caligari also broke a pattern that had been estab- lished soon after the abolition of censorship in 1918: explicit sex films, frequently under the guise of sex education or condemnation of prostitu- tion, competed with historical films such as Madame Dubarry or Anne Boleijn and with film versions of Hamlet or Othello. Once Wiene had proven that Expressionism could be successfully translated into the me- dium of film, other directors quickly followed suit. Karl-Heinz Martin filmed an adaptation of Kaiser's 1916 play Von morgens bis mitternachts (From morning till midnight, 1920), the story of a bank clerk who makes a nightmarish attempt to break out of poverty by embezzling money but finds that he cannot buy anything of lasting value and finally commits suicide. Martin had become famous as a director of Expressionist plays in Frankfurt and founded a theater in Berlin, Die Tribiine, with Rudolf Leonhard in 1919. There he directed Toller's Die Wandlung, using a black stage on which the actors were isolated by bright spotlights. The film ver- 23 Guenther 38 Frames from Rythmus 21, directed by Hans Richter, 1921 Scene from Die Strasse, directed by Ciirl Grime, 1923 38 sion of the play made use of this device and, with Neppach's designs, was another outstanding example of expressionistic film. In this case it was not only the form that was striking but also the typical Expressionist con- demnation of materialism and glorification of the poor and downtrodden. There were other films that were important to the move- ment primarily because they reached a wide public. Genuine (1920)— directed by Wiene, based on a script by Mayer, and with designs by Klein— serves as a good example. Once again it was the visual form that made the film important, since the story is a melodramatic tale of a femme fatale. This type of horror fairy tale was typical of the Expressionist imagi- nation, as was the second version of Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam (The Golem and how he came into the world, 1920; see fig. 35). Based on a script by the actor Paul Wegener, who also directed the film and played the lead role, Der Golem retold the story of the terrible clay figure in the possession of Rabbi Loev in Prague, which in the end is destroyed by the innocence of a child. The sculptor Rudolf Belling made the mask for the Golem while the architect Hans Poelzig re-created medieval Prague as background. The atmosphere is as dense and haunting as that created by Albin Grau in another well-known film, Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu: A symphony of horror, 1921; see fig. 36). F. W. Murnau, one of Germany's great directors, used Henrik Galeen's adapta- tion of Bram Stoker s Dracula, in which the plague is symbolized by a vampire who lives on human blood. Again the story was secondary to the visual impact of this most horrible of films. Meidner created expressionis- tic designs for the film Die Strasse (The street, 1923; see fig. 39), which Carl Grune directed, although they were tamer than the apocalyptic vi- sions he had painted around 1912. •w^ >?, • ics^ 24 Guenther Lino Taut, c. 1911 Attempts to make abstract films show another interrela- tionship among the arts. Viking Eggeling, a Swedish painter, made the first such film, Diagonal-Symphonie (Diagonal symphony), in Berlin, using animated linear designs. Hans Richter's Rhythmus 21 (Rhythm 21; see fig. 38) was also a work of pure abstraction. G. B. R. Hoboken and Walter Ruttman experimented with moving planes and colors. A few art- ists, among them Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, worked with the same concepts in later years. Many other films were part of the movement, but the public soon began to prefer more entertaining, less challenging fare. After 1924, when political conditions permitted the importation of films from Amer- ica, there was no longer a market for expressionistic films. The most frustrated artists within the Expressionist movement were the architects.-* As prolific as they were in producing sketches, models, and theoretical writings in the postwar period, the great new tasks and commissions for which they had hoped never materi- alized. Germany needed new factory buildings and new apartment houses, not Utopian designs. Bruno Taut (see fig. 40) became convinced that large groups like the Arbeitsrat or the Novembergruppe, contrary to their manifestos, were not conducive to the development of new architec- tural forms. At the end of 1919 he initiated an informal exchange of letters and drawings among a small number of colleagues to spur the develop- ment of a new architecture in order to be ready for new commissions. They shared the conviction that architecture, through its visual and spa- tial impact, could be a forceful device for social change. Architecture needed to be the symbol of the new world, and Taut called on his friends to become \"imaginary\" architects, recognizing that \"the bourgeoisie, our colleagues included, belittled the revolution by proceeding as if nothing had happened.\"^^ The Glaserne Kette (glass chain), as the group called itself, also shared the concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk that Kandinsky, Gropius, and many others advocated. Wenzel A. Hablik, a member of the group, stated: \"We need new ideals. One of these is the Gesamtkunst- werk, the building. Not the brick box or the minimal living-space box, but architecture as a living element comparable to the cosmic laws.\"^\" 25 Guenther 42 Erich Mendelsohn Germany, 1887-1953 Sketch for the Einstein Tower, Potsdam, 1917-21 43 Erich Mendelsohn Germany, 1887-1953 Einstein Tower, Postdam, 1917-21 Rudolf Steiner with a model for the first Goetheanum, 1914 The architects beheved that the centers of the cities, the \"crowns of the cities' as they called them, would be templelike structures in which all of the arts would be brought together and which the populace would regard as the spiritual axes of the cities. Taut and the others recog- nized, however, that before such projects could be built, a larger segment of society had to be willing to accept the new ideas; \"The direct carrier of the spiritual forces, molder of the sensitivities of the general public— which today is slumbering but tomorrow will awaken— is architecture. Only a complete revolution in the spiritual realm will create this new architecture. \"•\" This was stated in 1918, but the expected spiritual revo- lution never took place. Very few of the buildings erected during this period can be called expressionistic. One of the best examples of expressionistic architecture was created not by an architect but by the founder of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner. Between 1913 and 1920 he designed a number of ingenious wooden buildings in Dornach, Switzer- land, which were to provide a harmonious frame for the activities of his society (see fig. 41). After a fire on New Year's Day of 1923 destroyed the buildings, they were replaced between 1924 and 1928 by concrete struc- tures that were more conservative in form. Another example of expres- sionistic architecture that is often cited is the Einstein Tower in Potsdam (1917-21; see figs. 42, 43), an observatory designed and built by Erich Mendelsohn. Its powerfully curving forms and the imaginative stacking of the floors give it the appearance of a monolith. (It was reconstructed after the Second World War.) No other large commissions were offered. Gro- pius designed a complex triangular structure as a memorial to the workers who were killed by government troops in Weimar in March 1920. It is far more dynamic than the massive memorial Ludwig Mies van der Rohe built in Berlin for Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, two Communist leaders who were murdered by right-wing militarists. A third memorial could be added here, the sculptural arcade built by Max Taut for the Wissinger family at the cemetery in Stahnsdorf-Berlin. Major commissions that would have demonstrated what expressionistic architecture could achieve simply did not come about. Only in modern church buildings did expressionistic forms become visi- ble. The use of more imaginative forms to enhance the spirit of the faithful was more readily accepted by religious organizations. Domenikus Bohm built the Church of Saint John the Baptist in Neu-Ulm (1921-26), and Otto Bartning built the Church of the Resurrection in Essen (1929-30), both of which display an architectural vocabulary that is clearly expres- sionistic. After the Second World War, when many churches had to be rebuilt, expressionistic forms were revived. Examples include such diverse structures as Rainer Disse's Church of the Transfiguration in Feldberg (1961-65) and Gottfried Bohm's Pilgrimage Church in Neviges (1966-68). As far as interior design is concerned, two well-known expressionistic solutions must be mentioned. Poelzig reconstructed the interior of a former circus building, transforming it into the largest the- ater in Berlin, the Grosses Schauspielhaus (see figs. 44-46), in which Max Reinhardt staged some of the great performances of 1919-20. The archi- 44-46 Hans Poelzig Germany, 1869-1936 Grosses Schauspielhaus, Berlin, 1919 27 Guenther tect covered the wide dome structure with stalactite forms and designed a color lighting system that could evoke various moods. On a much smaller scale the interior of the Tanzkasino (dance casino) Skala in Berlin, designed by Belling and the architect Walter Wiirzbach, was dependent upon cubistic crystalline forms (see fig. 47). It is typical of the period that Behne concluded his critique of this interior with the comment; \"Plastic conception of space and movement can be splendid when a free will car- ries the art. Whether or not that [spirit] can be active in rooms for playboys and profiteers remains doubtful.\"''^ One other aspect of architecture within the Expressionist movement must be mentioned. It was introduced by Bruno Taut and con- cerned the use of color in architecture. The uniformly gray facades of urban buildings and the lack of green spaces in the cities contributed to the oppressive atmosphere that many of the young Expressionist poets had lamented. Blass, Albert Ehrenstein, Heym, Lotz, Stadler, and Franz Werfel all inveighed against the inhumanity of the cities and the individ- ual's isolation. Ehrenstein asked, \"I beg you, destroy the city,\" and Berthold Viertel wrote, \"I call you hell of the contaminated—/ City, con- structed without soul. ' To alleviate the gloominess, Taut advocated the use of bright colors on buildings. When he became city architect of Halle (1921-23), he immediately put his idea into practice. The lower parts of the city hall were painted fire-engine red, the loggias green, the statues and capitals yellow, and the horizontal courses of the seventeenth-century building black. Assisted by his office, many houses quickly put on new coats of paint, and blue, green, pink, and yellow buildings soon gave the inner city a new look. The Barasch department store was decorated with multicolored cubistic designs in complete disregard of the underlying fa- cade. (Taut's garden city of Falkenberg, near Berlin, was called Kolonie Tuschkasten [paint-box colony].) The public was critical, however, and the program was discontinued. It is possible that this color experiment 47 RudoH Belling (iermaiu, 1886-1972 Walter Wurzbach Tiinzkasino skala, Berlin, 1921 28 Guenther 48 Arnold Schonberg 49 Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schonberg, Anton Webern, and Hermann Scherchen outside the Atelier Grill in Donaueschingen, Germany, 1924 strengthened the trend toward the predominant use of white in modern architecture. Although considered Utopian, some of the architects al- hed with the Expressionist movement were highly gifted and found a way to prove it after 1924. At that time many large apartment blocks and sat- ellite settlements were being built, and these architects designed and built some outstanding socially conscious developments. Taut, together with Martin Wagner, built the influential Horseshoe settlement in Ber- lin, and Gropius created a satellite in Torten, near Dessau. The Uncle Tom's Cabin settlement in Berlin was designed by Taut, Hugo Haring, and O. R. Salvisberg, and Hans Scharoun developed the plans for Sie- mens-Stadt. The settlements integrated practical layouts of apartments, kindergarten buildings surrounded by wading pools and sandboxes, public libraries, shops, and green spaces (frequently achieved only after conflicts with community leaders). The mixture of single dwellings and larger apartment blocks and the configuration of the streets broke the monotony of the typical city. These projects were based on the dreams of the prewar period and the social idealism ol the Expressionist movement. Music, an art form that is undoubtedly an important part of the movement, nevertheless defies stylistic classification. Neither composers nor even specific works can be called \"expressionistic, \" yet Schonberg (see fig. 48) is certainly the most important composer who contributed to the movement. The confusion of terms is obvious in a statement about the composer by his student. and friend Webern: \"His feelings create entirely new values of expression; therefore they also need new means of expression. \"^•'' Schonberg himself struggled with the ter- minology.
