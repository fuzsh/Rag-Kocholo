        "text": "This thread will be dedicated to the study of one of the lesser known Luftwaffe suborganizations.\n\nThis intent of this thread is to bring out participation. Any information including details and photos of uniforms, insignia, and the actual men themselves are greatly encouraged.\n\nI will start off by going over a few of the uniform regulations.\n\nLuftwaffe Corps of Engineers:\n\nBy decree of the the Fuhrer and Reichs Chancellery on 20Apr1935, the \"Corps of Engineers of the Luftwaffe\" was created. It was further deemed on 18Oct1935 that the members of this newly formed corps were not soldiers but \"members of the Luftwaffe\" with a status very similar to that of Officials.\n\nThis was an Officer only career field.\n\nRequirements for entry into the Corps of Engineers changed several times, yet the basic requirement was a University(equiv to a Masters Degree?) or College(Basic four year, Bach. Degree) degree in engineering. University graduates were brought in at the rank of Fl. Hauptingenieur and College degree qualified for the rank of Fl. Ingenieur.\n\nMembers of the Corps of Engineers wore the basic Luftwaffe style uniform. Insignia comprised of:\n\n1. Tabs- Rose Pink. Rank was denoted with the use of the wreath and blades of the propeller(instead of gulls like the Luftwaffe proper).\n\n2. Boards- Standard style, with pink waffenfarbe.\n\nReserve members are identified by a blue secondary piping on the tabs and shoulder boards.\n\nThe role or purpose of this formation is not noted in my Angolia or Davis books. Did they design aircraft? Plan and construct Airbases? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCorps of Engineer Officers:\n\nAn order dated 11May1940 created the \"Corps of Engineer Officers\" with the eventual disbanding of the \"Corps of Engineers\" in mind. The many delays in acting on this order, the Corps of Engineers was never disbanded and both the Corps of Engineers and the Corps of Engineer Officers co-existed for the duration of the war. The only difference in the two services was the collar tabs.\n\nTabs: Rose Pink. Rank was denoted with the use of the wreath and gulls, like regular Luftwaffe Officers.\n\nWartime Members of the Corps of Engineers:\n\nThis was not a career area. They were civilian engineers brought into the service of the Luftwaffe for the duration of the war to fill billets. These men were given a ranking based upon their age, experience, and schooling. Once assigned a rank, they were non promotable.\n\nStarting on 15Jan43, the Wartime Members of the Corps of Engineers wore the same uniforms as those used by the Corps of Engineers. The insignia differed as stated below:\n\n1. Tabs- Rose pink, as the Corps of Engineer tabs. Ranking consisted of the embroidered wreath only. No propellers or gulls were used. The exact ranking was noted on the shoulder cord.\n\n2. Shoulder Cord- As with other Sonderfuhrer shoulder cords, these were to be unpiped(although this rule was frequently broken). The rank exact rank was noted on the shoulder cord by the use of yellow \"sliders\".\n\nDocument #1 Service Review (Translation provided by Rosenberg)\n\nService-Review\n\nfor Fl.Stabsingenieur Horst H?drich, born 6/1/1908 at Weimar\n\nOn 11/1/1934 Fl.Stabsingenieur Horst H?drich entered service of the National German Aerial Industry Association at the Testing Site Travem?nde. After its incorporation in the LW-Testing-Unit Travem?nde he continues service still today.\n\nThrough April 1937, Mr. H?drich was an expert with the Flight-Device-Group. He then became leading-expert for Testing & Serial with the Group-Leader.\n\nHis tasks included the testing of experimental planes, propellers, devices etc.\n\nHe worked on the Guidelines for Master-Tests, especially those on testing flight characteristics while simultaneously developing the necessary measuring instruments. As a Test-Pilot, he took part with the testing of the German Seaplanes, Airships and special purpose planes of any kind, also fighter planes, catapult planes as well as with the testing of planes designated for carriers. He was responsible for the technical correctness & scientific documentation of testing reports.\n\nFrom May 1937 through August 1937, he was technical director and as such prepared the German Team to take part in the Zurich Military Air show.\n\nUpon his return, he was appointed head of the shipyard at the testing-site and promoted to Group-Leader. A short time later, he was appointed vice-director of the testing-site facilities.\n\nAs such, his tasks covered replacements and repairs of planes, devices and add-ons of any kind. They included the building and rebuilding of parts and experimental parts as well as the design of the aforementioned. He was head of 200 workers and 20 administrative servants.\n\nMr. H?drich was responsible for the flight safety of the planes in the shipyard, also for the correct processing of experimental parts. He did shipyard and testing-flights himself.\n\nAs director of the shipyard he managed several workshops for metal & wood, engines, propellers, tool-making, paint, leather and tapestry and the lab for galvanic baths. The aforementioned were always in perfect condition under his management. We explicitly respect the low-rate of complaints on work performed during his time as shipyard-director.\n\nApart from the prior he was also responsible for the Materials-,Tooling-and Replacements-Procurement, technical field-service, all types of communications with Companies, Administration and superior offices in matter of his sphere of responsibility.\n\nOn April 1st 1940, he was appointed Director of the shipyard facilities and promoted to Section-Leader in recognition of his skills and performance.\n\nHe was head of the entire facilities at the testing-site, leader of 1000 workers, servants, technicians and engineers. The facilities consisted of the following: shipyard, engine-workshops with testing-ability up to 5000HP, flight service, naval service, facility controlling, energy supply, civil engineering and repair of the facilities, technical administration, human resource management, quality control and the teaching of apprentices in an apprentice-workshop (120 apprentices).\n\nAs a section-leader Mr. H?drich was only responsible to the Director of the testing site.\n\nFl.Stabsingenieur always fulfilled given tasks perfectly and justified our trust in him at any time. It is worth mentioning that his tasks were much more complicated than those of a facility-director within a unit using serial-planes as opposed to his ever changing experimental planes. The industry was by far depending on findings made by the Testing-Unit.\n\nFl.Stabsingenieur H?drich is an open minded, honest, reliable, diligent and trustworthy person. He has perfect manners, is highly motivated, result orientated and a generous engineer. He is well minded, has a wealth of knowledge and experience. These combined with his durability make him ideal for experimental research.\n\nHis use of subordinates in accordance to their skills was very well, based on his fact-based and just treatment of subordinates combined with his always good point of view, his sensitivity and review-ability. Unstoppable on duty he became not only an idol but a care-taking superior.\n\nThis review was made on request due to a transfer to the Command\n\nSigned,\n\nSchenck (Paul Schenck)\n\nOberstingeneiur and Leader of the\n\nLuftwaffe Testing site at Travem?nde"
