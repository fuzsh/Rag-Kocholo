        "text": "On 1st December 1918 the Saxon 40. Infanterie-Division concluded its long march back from Flanders at Hamm in Westphalia. From there it awaited transported by rail back to Leipzig, and (according to the regimental history of IR 104) began the process of discharging some categories of soldiers. Sachsen in Grosser Zeit notes obliquely that IR 134 and 181 \"occupied the magazine [in Hamm] as a last deed for the fatherland\", which implies at least a perceived threat of civil disorder during this period. On 6th December, the Freiwilligen-Verband der 40. Infanterie-Division was formed with volunteers from multiple arms. IR 104 and FAR 32 both mention their contributions in their regimental histories - FAR 32 donated a full Freiwilligen-Batterie under the highly decorated Somme veteran Obltn. Bernhard Heydenreich. This Freikorps was led by Major Wilhelm Michaelis, last field commander of II. Abt. / FAR 32. In some Freikorps-related secondary sources, Michaelis is incorrectly referred to as a Hauptmann. He had been one in 1914, when he had also held the post of brigade adjutant in 32, Feldartillerie-Brigade (32. Infanterie-Division). By the end of the war he was definitely a Major, and he later retired from the Reichswehr as an Oberstleutnant a.D.\n\nAccording to Sachsen in Grosser Zeit, the rail transportation of the 40. Infanterie-Division back to Saxony began on 14th December. The Freiwilligen Abteilung, Freiwilligen-Verband or Freikorps Michaelis is said to have been employed with success against civil disorder in Hamm, presumably during this waiting period. It did likewise return home, but would not be settling into barracks for demobilisation and reduction to a cadre. Sachsen in Grosser Zeit states that it was officially intended for Grenzschutz (border defence) duty in the east, and it did indeed become part of a much larger force of Freiwillligen Grenzjäger at the disposal of the new republican Saxon government. These 'volunteer border troops' served as a mobile reserve to support the purely defensive and immobile border guard battalions, in the event of an invasion by e.g. the Czechs. They also (and arguably primarily) served to defend the government against revolutionary upheaval. By early 1919 there were two Freiwillligen Grenzjäger-Brigaden, each consisting of two Freiwilligen Grenzjäger-Regimenter (infantry regiments), two Freiwilligen Grenzreiter-Eskadronen (cavalry squadrons), a light artillery regiment and a heavy artillery 'detachment' (Abteilung) of uncertain size. Freikorps Michaelis is said to have become the Stammtrupp (the core cadre) for \"Grenzjäger-Abteilung 1\". Since the Freikorps was a mixed formation with at least infantry and artillery components, I surmise that this Grenzjäger-Abteilung was simply an earlier designation for the later Freiwillligen Grenzjäger-Brigade of the same number.\n\nGiven the very short existence of Freikorps Michaelis as a separate entity, I believe that the cuff title \"Freiw. Verb. 40. I.-D.\" was probably worn commemoratively by its former members within the 1. Grenzjäger-Brigade. The metal hunting horn collar insignia and the red cloth hunting horn sleeve insignia seem to have been worn widely in combination within the Grenzjäger-Brigaden, though some photos also show men wearing only the metal or only the cloth insignia.\n\nI have a modest collection of Grenzjäger photos, but sadly none with the cuff title. This is the largest group picture, taken in Löbau in 1920. Note that almost all of them are young men without any WW1 decorations - it's easy to see why the hardened combat veterans of the 40.ID would wish to distinguish themselves from these 'kids'... The specific sub-unit is unidentifiable - maybe an infantry MG company?"
