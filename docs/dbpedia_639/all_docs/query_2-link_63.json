        "text": "Sparrow Avengers universe - Soldiers, ranks and rank insignia of the Zemplín Federation (1918 - mid-to-late 1940s)\n\nOK, here's my concepts and artworks for soldiers of the Zemplín Federation, one of the ATL post-WWI, interwar era central European nations from my Sparrow Avengers Universe (a.k.a. TL-37, a.k.a. my very European take on a Crimson Skies style allohistorical setting). A preliminary look into the history and terminology of the Zemplín Federation's military, into the rank insignia of its soldiers and the equipment of its soldiers.\n\nA look at some interwar era soldiers of the Zemplín Federation's armed forces\n\nPechota Zemplínskej federácie (medzivojnové obdobie) = \"Infantry of the Zemplín Federation (interwar period)\"\n\nfľintar - equivalent of \"rifleman\". Fľintar is an ATL word derived from the Zemplín dialect's generic word for a rifle or long gun - fľinta. The closest direct translation of fľintar into English would be akin to \"fusilier\". The Zemplín riflemen are equipped with green or brown standard issue uniforms, leather highboots (particularly good for the marshy parts of south Zemplín, or soggy terrain and rainy weather in general) or sturdy leather boots and shin-protecting puttees (both largelly inherited from WWI Austria-Hungary and worn in dryer weather and most terrain types), modified Russian Adrian helmets on their heads (these are being slowly supplemented with more modern Polish and Czech models), webbing, a backpack and often also a bandolier, and last but not least, a bayoneted Steyr-Männlicher M1895 or Mosin-Nagant 1891 bolt-action rifle (once again, captured leftovers or surplus from the times of the Great War). In more recent years, the riflemen have started to also use some Czech-designed newer bolt-action rifles, but these still aren't the most common in their arsenal.\n\noficir - an \"officer\" in Zemplín Slovak (predictable, ey ?). This one's wearing much of the same outfit as the average rifleman, but with a durable Austro-Hungarian-style kepi (also worn by riflemen and other footsoldiers, but less often than officers). He's holding a decorated officer's sword and, in his sidearm holster, carries a Rast & Gasser M1898 or a Nagant 1895 revolver, or one of the many WWI surplus Austro-Hungarian pistols. (These are not directly visible in the picture, but are yet another example of repurposed older equipment left over in the region after the end of WWI.) In more recent years, they had also started to carry Czech-designed pistols or Belgian-designed Browning pistols.\n\nhorský strelec - mountain marksman (horski štriľec in Zemplín Slovak), mountain infantryman, a mountain warfare subset of the Zemplín jaegers (jager in Zemplín Slovak), the irregular infantry skirmishers. The Zemplín Federation's homebrewn, somewhat DIY answer to the likes of Austro-Hungarian mountain troopers or Italian Bersaglieri of WWI. They're part of the irregular skirmisher infantry, a fairly elite part at that, akin to nearly special forces or commandos. As you can see in the picture, they have both summer (leto) and winter (zima) versions of their kit and uniform and carry combat knives instead of bayonets. Unlike regular riflemen, they wear hats or hoods on their head and always wear puttees, simple kneeguards and combat boots on their legs. Though they mostly travel on foot, after their initial establishment, the Zemplín Federation eventually started experimenting with gradually adding snowshoes and skis to their wintertime equipment, and the relevant showshoe travel and skiing to their wintertime mobility training. Often performs border guard operations in the mountainous area of the federation's borders.\n\n(The ATL terms present in the image are noted in parentheses.)\n\nJednotky na koni Zemplínskej federácie (medzivojnové obdobie) = \"Mounted units of the Zemplín Federation (interwar period)\" (encompasses the cavalry consisting of lancers and hussars, as well as the horseman mounted infantry consisting of dragoons)\n\nulan - equivalent of \"uhlan\" and \"lancer\". Ulan is an OTL as well as ATL Zemplín dialect term for such a cavalry soldier. Zemplín was one of the few Slovak-speaking regions of former Austria-Hungary whose successor statelet kept a lancer tradition in their military, carrying it over from the Austro-Hungarian days. This was because the central and southern parts of the new country represented a rare area with predominantly lowland or low-hill terrain, a type of terrain better-suited to lancers than others. The Zemplín Federation's uhlans/lancers are equipped with green standard issue uniforms, leather highboots (particularly good for the marshy parts of south Zemplín, or soggy terrain and rainy weather in general) or sturdy leather boots and shin-protecting puttees (both largelly inherited from WWI Austria-Hungary and worn in dryer weather and most terrain types), modified Russian Adrian helmets on their heads (slowly supplemented with more modern Polish and Czech models), webbing, a bandolier (not finished yet and therefore not visible in this version), a cavalry lance (their primary melee weapon), a hanger or trench knife (melee sidearm), pistol or revolver (ranged, handgun sidearm), and the carbine version of a Steyr-Männlicher M1895 bolt-action rifle (their primary ranged weapon, though carried mainly as a backup to the lance). In more recent years, the uhlans/lancers have also started to use the carbine versions of some Czech-designed newer bolt-action rifles, but these still aren't the most common in their arsenal. By the latter half of the 1930s, uhlan units also started including at least one uhlan carrying an anti-tank rifle, an element inspired by Polish and CMSR mounted units of the era.\n\nhusar - equivalent of a \"hussar\", specifically one in the vein of a traditional 19th century hussar or WWI hussar of Austria-Hungary, but with the distinction that the Zemplín Federation's hussars eschew all ceremonial clothing elements and wear only an ordinary WWI style uniform, much like the Zemplín Federation's uhlans and dragoons (see below). Husar is, of course, an OTL as well as ATL Zemplín dialect term for such a cavalry soldier. The Zemplín Federation's hussars are equipped with green standard issue uniforms, leather highboots (particularly good for the marshy parts of south Zemplín, or soggy terrain and rainy weather in general) or sturdy leather boots and shin-protecting puttees (both largelly inherited from WWI Austria-Hungary and worn in dryer weather and most terrain types), modified Russian Adrian helmets (slowly supplemented with more modern Polish and Czech models) or modified kepis on their heads, webbing, a bandolier (not finished yet and therefore not visible in this version), a sabre (their primary melee weapon), a hanger or trench knife (melee sidearm), pistol or revolver (ranged, handgun sidearm), and the carbine version of a Steyr-Männlicher M1895 bolt-action rifle (their primary ranged weapon). In more recent years, the hussars have also started to use the carbine versions of some Czech-designed newer bolt-action rifles, but these still aren't the most common in their arsenal.\n\ndraguň - equivalent of \"dragoon\" or \"lighthorseman\". Draguň is an OTL as well as ATL Zemplín dialect term for such a mounted infantry soldier soldier. The Zemplín Federation's dragoons / light horse are equipped with green standard issue uniforms, leather highboots (particularly good for the marshy parts of south Zemplín, or soggy terrain and rainy weather in general) or sturdy leather boots and shin-protecting puttees (both largelly inherited from WWI Austria-Hungary and worn in dryer weather and most terrain types), modified Russian Adrian helmets (slowly supplemented with more modern Polish and Czech models) or skirmisher style hats on their heads, webbing, a bandolier (not finished yet and therefore not visible in this version) and a bayoneted Steyr-Männlicher M1895 bolt-action rifle, or Mosin-Nagant 1891 bolt-action rifle, or the Steyr-Männlicher M1895 short rifle. Though the dragoons originally only carried hangers, trench knives and bayonets as their melee sidearms, a decision was made in the early days of the Zemplín military to equip them with sabres as well, just in case. (Making them the only non-cavalry soldiers to carry sabres.) They are also the only mounted troops to occassionally carry and use the sniper variant of the Steyr-Männlicher M1895 bolt-action rifle, which brings them closer than any other mounted unit to the jaeger and mountain marskman soldiers of the ZF's infantry. In more recent years, the dragoons have also started to use some Czech-designed newer bolt-action rifles and carbines, but these still aren't the most common in their arsenal. By the latter half of the 1930s, dragoon units also started including at least one dragoon carrying a light machine gun, which distinguished them even more greatly from the largelly similar armaments used by the hussar units.\n\nMale and female pilot of the Zemplín Federation's air force in standard issue flight gear (male master sergeat and female lieutenant)\n\n\"In day as well as the black night\n\nat the border I stand guard.\"\n\nYes, siree. Keepin' Zemplín's borders safe and secure from that silly Horthy junta and any of those damned, no-good, crazy-ass falangists, fascists and other shady authoritarian bastards !\n\n(1920s and 1930s Zemplín Federation border guard soldier propaganda poster. It's good-natured, almost peppy, I'll grant you, but still propaganda, ho-hum. Hope you're diggin' the French-by-way-of-Austria-Hungary look and feel to the kit. )\n\n----\n\n♫\n\nRanks in the Zemplín Federation's armed forces (in multiple languages)\n\nAn overview of ranks and how they sound in the individual main languages of the Zemplín Federation, including Zemplín dialects.\n\nUnlike standard Slovak, the Zemplín dialect of the Slovak language does not use long vowels, only short vowels.\n\nThe Rusyn variations of the rank names are written in the Русиньскый алфавіт (Rusyn alphabet), followed by an English transliteration.\n\nThe Yiddish variations of the rank names are written in the Hebrew script used for Yiddish, followed by an English transliteration.\n\nEnglish termZemplín\n\nSlovak termZemplín\n\nHungarian termZemplín\n\nRusyn termYiddish\n\ntermAustro-Hungarian termStandard Slovak termSoldierVojakKatonaсолдат (Soldat)זעלנער (Zelner)Soldat / KatonaVojak prvého stupňaSoldier First ClassSlobodnikŐrvezetőСтарший солдат (Starshyy soldat)פּריוואַט (Privat)Gefreiter / ŐrvezetőVojak druhého stupňaNon-commissioned\n\nofficer (NCO)PodoficirAltisztПідофіцір (Pidoficir) נידעריקאָפיציר (Niderikofitsir) / יינגעראָפיציר (Eyngerofitsir)Unteroffizier / AltisztPoddôstojníkCorporalKapraľTizedesДесятник (Desyatnyk)קאָרפּאָראַל (Korporal)Korporal / TizedesDesiatnik, KaprálSergeantStražmešterŐrmesterЧотовий (Chotovyi)\n\nСержант (Serzhant)סערזשאַנט (Serzhant)Zugsführer / ŐrmesterČatár, SeržantMaster sergeantŠtabnikTörzsőrmesterСтарший Чотовий\n\n(Starshyy chotovyi)\n\nСтарший сержант (Starshyy serzhant)סערזשאַנט-הויפּט (Serzhant-hoypt)Feldwebel / TörzsőrmesterRotmajster / NadrotmajsterStaff sergeantŠtabmešterFőtörzsőrmesterСтаршіна\n\n(Starshyna)שטעקן סערזשאַנט (Shtekn serzhant)Stabsfeldwebel / FőtörzsőrmesterŠtábny nadrotmajsterCadetUčeňHadapródПідхорунжий (Pidkhorunzhyi)קאַדעט\n\n(Kadet)Kadett / KadetKadetOfficerOficirTisztофіцір (Oficir)אָפיציר\n\n(Ofitsir)OffizierDôstojníkEnsignFenrichZászlósХорунжий (Khorunzhyi)ענסיגן (Ensin)Fähnrich / ZászlósPráporčíkSub-lieutenantPodporučikHadnagyПідпоручпик (Pidporuchnyk)סובליעוטענאַנט (Sublyeutenant)Leutnant / HadnagyPodporučíkLieutenantPoručikFőhadnagyПоручпик (Poruchnyk)לוטענאַנט (Lutenant)Oberleutnant\n\n/ FőhadnagyPoručíkCaptainKapitaňSzázadosСотпик (Sotnyk)קאַפּיטאַן (Kapitan)Hauptmann / Rittmeister (cavalry) / SzázadosKapitán (archaically Stotník)MajorMajorŐrnagyМайор (Maior)הויפּט (Hoypt)Major / ŐrnagyMajorLieutenant ColonelPodplukovnikAlezredesПідполковпик (Pidpolkovnyk)לוטענאַנט-פּאָלקאָווניק (Lutenant-polkovnik)Oberstleutnant / AlezredesPodplukovníkColonelPlukovnikEzredesПолковпик\n\n(Polkownyk)פּאָלקאָווניק (Polkovnik)Oberst / EzredesPlukovníkGeneralsGeneraľeTábornagyokгенералі (Henerali)גענעראלן (Generaln)GeneralenGeneráliBrigadier generalBrigadni generaľDandártábornokБригадний генерал\n\n(Brihadnyi heneral)בריגאדיר גענעראל (Brigadir general)Brigadengeneral / DandártábornokBrigádny generálMajor generalGeneraľmajorVezérőrnagyГенерал-майор (Heneral-maior)הויפּט גענעראַל (Hoypt General)Generalmajor / VezérőrnagyGenerálmajorLieutenant GeneralGeneraľporučikAltábornagyГенерал-лейтенант (Heneral-leitenant)\n\nГенерал-поручник\n\n(Heneral-poruchnyk)גענעראל לוטענאַנט (General lutenant)Generalleutnant / AltábornagyGenerálporučíkColonel GeneralGeneraľplukovnikVezérezredesГенерал-полковник (Heneral-polkovnyk)גענעראל-פּאָלקאָווניק (General-polkovnik)Generaloberst / VezérezredesGenerálplukovníkGeneralGeneraľTábornagyГенерал (Heneral)גענעראל (General)General / TábornagyGenerál\n\n(Rank insignia images TBA.)\n\nSoldier -

Mountaineer soldier / Mountain skirmisher / Mountain marksman (2)\n\nMašinkvernik - Machine gunner (3)\n\nJager motorov, Pancerfľintar - Anti-tank rifleman (4)\n\nJezdzec - Cavalryman, Horseman\n\nDraguň -

Night watchman, Night time guard\n\nKasareň - Barracks (not a soldier term per se, but soldiers have to be accomodated somewhere)\n\n(1) - the term can be loosely translated as both \"fusilier\" and \"rifleman\", since the Zemplín dialect uses flinta or fľinta interchangeably for any long firearms, be they muskets, fusils or rifles, including modern 19th-20th century cartridge rifles and bolt-action rifles.\n\n(2) - these \"mountain marksmen\" are members of a special unit of two of the conventional jagers, i.e. \"skirmishers\", but with additional training and equipment for operating in mountainous areas, including in winter (when some of them even use skis or certain types of snowshoes). The standard Slovak term for these would be the similar-sounding horský strelec (\"mountain marksman\"). Along with the paragan paratroopers, they're the closest thing the Zemplín Federation has to commando units.\n\n(3) - originally derived from the German term Maschinengewehr, \"machine gun\", close to various similar Slovak and Czech colloquial and dialect terms, e.g. mašinkver, mašinkvér, etc. The Zemplín Rusyn variation is машінквірнік (\"mashinkvirnik\"). The suggested Zemplín neologism strojfľintar (\"machine-rifleman\"), coined in the 1920s, had not caught on. The low-in-numbers submachine guns used by the ZF in the 1930s and 1940s were dubbed simply mašinpištoľe (\"machine-pistols\").\n\n(4) - literally meaning \"motorcar hunter\", this is a Zemplín interwar neologism for a soldier equipped with an anti-tank rifle (or similar early anti-tank weaponry), used to take out enemy motor-s, i.e. \"cars\", \"motorcars\" (the term motor a general term for both a vehicle engine and a motor vehicle in the Zemplín dialect). Some of the armoured cars in the Zemplín Federation's armed forces are equipped with repurposed and modified anti-tank rifles instead of full-blown tank barrels. The Zemplín Slovak and Zemplín Rusyn term for an anti-tank rifle itself, invented concurrently in the late 1910s and 1920s, was pancerfľinta (\"armour-rifle\", панцерфльінта in Rusyn), hence also the alternate soldier term pancerfľintar (\"armour-rifleman\", панцерфльінтар in Rusyn). A related term added to the Zemplín Slovak and Zemplín Rusyn vocabulary during the later WWII years was pancermolotok, \"armour-hammer\", referring to handheld anti-armour rocket or missile launchers.\n\n(5) - originally derived from Hungarian ágyu, \"cannon\" and ágyus, \"artilleryman\"/\"cannoneer\" in the Zemplín Hungarian dialect, and the German Kanonier (\"cannoneer\", \"bombardier\", \"artilleryman\").\n\n(6) - analogous to the Austro-Hungarian Feuerwerker, an \"artillery sergeant\" or \"sergeant-bombardier\". The new Zemplín-coined term originally derived from Hungarian őrmester, \"sergeant\", \"watchmaster\", and secondarily from the newly-established Zemplín rank term stražmešter (\"watchmaster\", \"sergeant\") or German Kanonier (\"cannoneer\", \"bombardier\", \"artilleryman\"), thus meaning \"cannon-master\", \"artillery-sergeant\".\n\n(7) - the first term is based on the Zemplín verb for \"to fly\", ľecec, and the homonymous noun for a \"flyer\", a flying person, ľecec, (also analogous to standard Slovak letec), with the second term originally derived from German Flieger, \"flyer\", \"aviator\".\n\n(8) - derived from the equally newly-established Zemplín term ľuftšif (or ľuftšifa), borrowed from German Luftschiff and the already long-existing Zemplín terms ľuft (\"air\" and \"aerial space\") and šif or šifa (\"ship\").\n\n(9) - the paratroopers of the Zemplín Federation, trained for parachuting behind enemy lines and so on, from transport aircraft or even military airships. Along with the \"mountain marksmen\", they're the closest thing the Zemplín Federation has to commando units.\n\nThe military doctrine for the quarter century long existence of the Zemplín Federation during the interwar years and WWII was to \"always try to do more with less, with the most effective and careful use of what we have\", and in terms of infantry, \"the well-trained rifleman is the backbone of the ground forces, with the machine gunners, AT riflemen, mounted troops, vehicles, sappers and all other ground forces personnel to be combined with the use of the common rifleman soldier as best as possible, depending on the context\". Partly based on this doctrine, the ZF military rejected the introduction of semi-automatic rifles throughout its history, considering them more of a novelty usable for paratroopers, but not for typical soldiers (despite the fact that early semi-auto rifle designs had been gaining traction since WWI - example 1, 2, 3). Given the humble origins of the Zemplín Federation's military and frequent improvising in its earliest years, the ZF prided itself in a pro-active, disciplined and flexible NCO and lower officer leadership, rather than relying on blind and rigid obedience to orders of higher-up officers. This approach, also used by many other Austro-Hungarian statelets, and initially often ridiculed by more old-fashioned post-war European powers, proved its worth in the occassional military clashes prior to WWII, and particularly during the harsh wartime years of WWII.\n\nBesides various local dialect nicknames for soldiers, Zemplín Federation soldiers as a whole became commonly nicknamed the \"Grains-Acorns-and-Grapes\" or the \"Fishes-and-Grains\". This is because of some of the prominent heraldic charges (ears of grain, sprigs with acorns, bunches of grapes and fishes, among others) on the great coat of arms of the Zemplín Federation, adopted from the coats of arms of the Zemplín and Ung counties, heraldic charges that even found their way on some of the military's more general emblems and roundels.

Similarly, in that same timespan, the Zemplín dragoon units would do the same, including in terms of numerical ratio per squad, but with light machine guns instead of anti-tank rifles. This was a precaution, inspired by similar measures done by the Polish, Galizian and Czech-Moravian mounted units of the time, that was adopted due the increasing importance of armoured vehicles throughout the interwar era and the years before WWII. During WWII, the uhlans would gradually stop using their lances altogether, with only occassional auxilliary usage seen during the latter half of the war (marking the last recorded cases in central European history of spears and lances still used in war), and with the anti-tank rifle now the primary weapon of the uhlans. Also, the interwar era distinctions between Zemplín dragoons and Zemplín hussars would start to diminish due to the tactical and logistical demands of the war, with both types now largelly mounted infantry in a battlefield context, and frequently armed with submachine guns and light machine guns in addition to rifles.\n\n----\n\n♫\n\nOne of the inherited-from-Austria-Hungary WWI era military trucks, still in use by the Zemplín Federation during the early 1920s\n\n----\n\nLinguistic notes on the military terminology of the Zemplín Federation (with a spotlight on the country's linguistic situation)\n\nIn a fitting irony for a post-war successor state to Austria-Hungary, the multicultural Zemplín Federation uses multiple languages as its official languages, namely the Zemplín dialect variety of Slovak (zempľinčina, or in standard Slovak, zemplínčina), the Zemplín dialect variety of Hungarian (zempléni tájszólás, zempléni nyelvjárás), the Zemplín varieties of the Rusyn language (Lemko and Boyko dialects and their own sub-dialects, e.g. the Lemko \"Labiric Rusyn\", the Boiko \"Cirochan Rusyn\") and Yiddish, the lingua franca mother tongue of the Jewish communities in the Zemplín Federation.\n\nThe Zemplín varieties of Slovak consist of the Slovak Zemplín sub-dialects of the southern, central and northern member regions of the Zemplín Federation. These sub-dialects include the Soták sub-dialect of Zemplín from the Cirocha river valley, as well as more conventional sub-dialects of the Zemplín dialect, with smaller and more subtle variations. Over the many centuries, Hungarian-inspired and German-inspired terms and words have found their way into the Zemplín dialect, in several waves of loanwords and derived words, and the more recent creation of a more codified, standardised version of the Zemplín dialect has kept these loanwords and even invented new terms from them.\n\nThe Zemplín varieties of Hungarian consist of a smaller range of the Hungarian Zemplín sub-dialects, from the southern and parts of the central member regions of the Zemplín Federation. These sub-dialects have a certain degree of variety, but most of the variations are relatively subtle and down to local nuances and traditions, than vastly different. The Zemplín Hungarian dialect is itself a branch of the northeastern dialects of Hungary. Just as a fair few expressions and terms from the vocabulary of the Zemplín Slovak dialect don't exist in other Slovak dialects or in standard Slovak, so too do a fair few expressions and terms from the vocabulary of the Zemplín Hungarian dialect don't exist in other Hungarian dialects or in standard Hungarian.\n\nThe Zemplín varieties of the Rusyn language consist of the two main dialects, Lemko Rusyn (most apparently in northernmost Zemplín, e.g. the Laborec river valley) and Boyko Rusyn (the more southern parts of northern Zemplín, e.g. the Cirocha river valley), which also occur in Transcarpathian Ukraine. Lemko Rusyn is also present in the western neighbour, the Šariš Free State. The more unique Zemplín sub-dialects of Lemko Rusyn and Boyko Rusyn include Labiric Rusyn (Lemko sub-dialect, in the Laborec river valley) and Cirochan Rusyn (Boyko sub-dialect spoken by the Puydyaks, local Boyko Rusyns, in the Cirocha river valley).\n\nThe official language of the Transcarpathian Republic, the Zemplín Federation's eastern neighbour, is a form of modern standardised Ukrainian. However, the vernacular/colloquial version of Ukrainian commonly heard and used in the Transcarpathian Republic, for everyday purposes and conversations among locals, is Lemko variety Ukrainian and more rarely Boiko variety Ukrainian, collectivelly also called Carpathian Ukrainian. This colloquial form stems from and, on an especially rural and traditional level, is divided into Lemko-Ukrainian and Boiko-Ukrainian dialects and the closely related nearly identical Lemko-Rusyn and Boiko-Rusyn dialects. These all have continuity with the Lemko variety Rusyn and Boiko variety Rusyn (and its sub-dialects) used in the Zemplín Federation and parts of the Šariš Free State.\n\nJewish communities of the Zemplín Federation are essentially invariably Ashkenazim in cultural and linguistic terms, speaking Yiddish (including local varieties), as well as local Slovak and local Hungarian, and are most commonly Orthodox Jewish or Hasidic in terms of their religious affiliation. Besides field chaplains of the various Christian churches of the region (Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, Reformed, Lutheran, Orthodox), the Zemplín Federation also has field rabbis in their armed forces, to tend to the religious needs of Jewish soldiers and personnel, in addition to Christian soldiers and personnel.\n\nSemjanová M., An Attempt at Internal Differentiation of the Zemplín dialects, 1976\n\nThe Rusyn language Cyrillic alphabet overview (very similar to Ukrainian Cyrillic) at Rusyn.sk\n\nZemplín-dialect-to-Slovak dictionary of Zemplín Slovak vocabulary (various sub-dialects, including the Soták variety) at Narecie.sk\n\nRusyn-to-Slovak dictionary of Zemplín Rusyn vocabulary (from the Lemko and Boyko dialects in Slovakia) at Narecie.sk\n\nPujďaci (Puydyaks), the Boyko Rusyns of Zemplín and east Slovakia from the vicinity of Snina and the Cirocha river valley\n\nThe complex history of language use and its issues in the Austro-Hungarian military, detailed research paper by Mag.

Zemplín has only four cities as such, Michalovce/Nagymihály and Humenné/Homonna as the big cities, and Trebišov/Terebes and Vranov/Varanó classed as \"smaller cities\". All other settlements with an urban charter, e.g. Medzilaborce/Mezőlaborc/Міджілaбірцї, Snina/Szinna/Снина, Sečovce/Gálszécs/Сечівці, Veľké Kapušany/Nagykapos, Kráľovský Chlmec/Királyhelmec, are classified as towns. The city/town policemen consist of regular police officers, police detectives and the other administrative and specialist staff.\n\nThe gendarmes (žandare, csendőrök, жандаре, жандармерія - zhandare, zhandarmeriya, זשאנדארמעריע - zhandarmerye), comparable to the OTL Czechoslovak and ATL CMSR četnictví or (a nicer version of) the Hungarian gendarmes, or to any number of western European gendarme forces, are the rural police force of the Zemplín Federation. Interestingly, though the gendarmes are primarily police officers, their part of the police force also includes proper police detectives, much like the city/town police. Most serious cases necessitating deeper investigation make use of the specialist staff available in the towns and cities.\n\nThe rank insignia codes for the police are blue with a white trim, and for the gendarmes, blue with a white-and-green trim (white on the outer side of the trim, green on the inner side). The only rank insignia differences with the military versions is that the lowest ranks have 1, 2 and 3 stylized grains, and an ear of grain, but no stalk with three ears of grain, and that the knightly helmet of the highest rank is replaced with a stylized policeman hat.\n\nIn a bit of a historical irony, the police officers are the only ones to still wear surplus Austro-Hungarian kepis similar to those from WWI, albeit re-dyed to a darker blue colour and with a small police identifier badge. (All of the kepis used by the military have been dyed green or newly made in green colour.) The gendarmes wear a practical broad-brimmed hat with a gendarmerie identifier badge and a small decorative plume made of pheasant tail feathers. Depending on the seriousness of the situation, the gendarmes can sometimes be seen wearing modified Adrian helmets of a dark blue colour with a gendarmerie identifier badge.\n\n----"
