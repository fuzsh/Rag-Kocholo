        "text": "On 27 July 1808, Marcus Hibler, a second captain (Kapitainleute) in the Habsburg infantry regiment Jordis, recounted a public and violent altercation with his second lieutenant (Unterleutnant) in his journal, noting it as “one of the saddest memories of my life.” The lieutenant, twenty-four-year-old Franz Nachtigall, had in a drunken rage insulted Hibler at a local inn in front of the inhabitants of Enns in Upper Austria. The slurs, uttered after Hibler gave Nachtigall the “honor” of drilling the regiment's new reservists before the regimental staff and an onlooking crowd, culminated in the lieutenant threatening to run his superior through with his sword. In a report written the day after the dispute for the Regimental Command in Linz, Hibler demanded the full weight of military law be brought against Nachtigall because he could not be expected to “remain indifferent to the insults and degrading behavior that have been inflicted on me in civilian and military circles.” His honor, he concluded, dictated that he should be “given the opportunity to take appropriate measures to deal with the deeds in which and how they have occurred.”Footnote 1\n\nThis article examines the lived experience of the Habsburg's military institutions in the lead-up to the Austro-Franco war of 1809, a period in which military service was positioned as the most loyal act a dutiful male subject of the emperor Francis I (II) could undertake. It does this by paying particular attention to a shameful and embarrassing public military display and the resulting near-violent dispute between company officers of the Jordis infantry regiment, as recorded and reflected on by the twenty-eight-year-old Hibler. These events were understood by those involved as dishonoring the regiment's officer corps and undermining the unit's connection to the society it relied upon to mobilize during a time of heightened tension with France.\n\nThe event in question, which Hibler rated as the “saddest” of his time in the army (placing it above the death of his brother at Austerlitz), made the experience of soldiering and the role of the soldier prominent to surrounding civilians. By exploring it, it is possible to glimpse how honor was negotiated and produced to fashion communities, local military processes, and wartime identities that were utilized in the Habsburg effort against France. In Hibler's case, these negotiations were informed by ambition, communal ties, competing models of military service, and the army structures to which he and his comrades were subjected. Together, they manifested and policed a type of honor that was understood as essential to both the maintenance of the regular soldiers’ position as dynastic intermediaries as well as the support of local societies for the war with France.Footnote 2\n\nWhile highlighting the importance of honor to officers is not new, Hibler's account allows for the examination of lived identity within a communal setting and articulates the ways in which honor created narrative frameworks and communities that persuaded diverse individuals to place their experiences within the context of the monarchy's war with France.Footnote 3 At a time when generals, statesmen, and the bourgeoisie debated the merit of popular military service and its links to the nation after the introduction of the popular militia—the Landwehr—in 1808, it is Hibler's interactions within the sphere of the professional army that the transnational comparisons and meanings of military service, honor, citizenship, patriotism, and subjecthood can be tellingly examined to discern the ways in which the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars were experienced within the many societies of the Habsburg monarchy.Footnote 4\n\nRecent histories of the Habsburg monarchy have focused on what Pieter Judson has articulated as the question of how “local societies across central Europe engaged with the Habsburg dynasty's efforts to build a unified and unifying imperial state from the eighteenth century until the First World War.”Footnote 5 These works have found that regional identities within the monarchy were co-opted by the dynasty to bind together its many peoples, allowing the Habsburgs to negotiate the social, cultural, and political difficulties of European state formation in the nineteenth century. These regional identities, or loyalties, were founded on local jurisdictions, civic orders, faith, and shared traditions that coalesced to form a cultural identity or “provincial consciousness.” As recent studies show, these were never relegated by a supranational “Austrian identity” but rather were linked to the dynasty by different and intersecting layers of authority. Being “Austrian” in the early nineteenth century thus meant maintaining allegiances within local communities while acknowledging that these existed thanks only to the protection offered by the House of Austria.Footnote 6 Brian Vick has termed this process of identity formation as “step-wise” patriotism. He argues that contemporaries, such as the Austrian foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, imagined that familial, professional, and communal loyalties and roles within local subregions combined to manifest regional identities.Footnote 7 As Daniel Unowsky has shown of the later imperial period, these local constancies could then be easily narrated as part of a unified dynastic loyalty through top-down displays of Habsburg power that expressed the imperial family's right to rule in each area.Footnote 8\n\nThis process of developing a sense of belonging was in a perpetual state of flux, far from defined and constantly negotiated.Footnote 9 The wars with France were one part of this process, a time in which government officials, intellectuals, and literati attempted to create the links of loyalty that could sustain the Habsburg war effort and allow it to easily mobilize domestic resources.Footnote 10 As Laurence Cole has shown of the late nineteenth century, one of the defining factors used to link the regions of the monarchy was service in the standing army, an institution built throughout the eighteenth century to defend the supremacy of the Habsburg family in Central Europe.Footnote 11 It is during the war with France that we can see “step-wise” patriotism in effect long before the reaction and reform of the Metternich period and the salon networks of 1814.Footnote 12\n\nDuring a period when the relationship between military service and national citizenship in different European countries was beginning to serve as a barometer for battlefield effectiveness, the monarchy's military institutions continued to champion Old Regime systems of motivation and conscription throughout its wars with France.Footnote 13 While this meant that the army continued to serve as a tool for the dynasty, it did not mean that it operated as a separate entity removed from the polity it defended. Thanks to almost forty years of military reform—first enacted by Maria Theresa and continued by her son Joseph II—the army was symbiotically linked to society through relentless conscription drives and logistical processes that depended on mobilizing resources through corporate organizations and institutions at a local level.Footnote 14 The need for a well-administered army dictated approaches to policing, education, sanitation, tenancy rights, credit, subsidies, taxation, and noble privileges, creating societies in the lands of Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia that were, as Michael Hochedlinger has shown, more militarized than Prussia before the French Revolution.Footnote 15\n\nWhile ostensibly an imperial army, one of the tenants of the Habsburg force's military culture, understood in this piece as “the values, norms and assumptions that encourage people to make certain choices in given circumstances,” was a regionalism fostered within regiments by the way in which men were locally recruited.Footnote 16 As we shall see, these local identities were solidified during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, culminating in the war of 1809 and then subsequently reinforced through public military displays and massed conscription, which identified these military communities as a region's “locus of loyalty” right up until 1918.Footnote 17 These communities served as an anchor point for the links that bound local societies to the dynasty and its wider polity.Footnote 18 As an intended consequence of local recruitment and displays of regional allegiances during the wars with France, a “horizontal plane” of loyalty was created within regiments and their extended communities, which was drawn upward, or stepped outward, toward the emperor through systems of military honor.Footnote 19\n\nThroughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, military honor as a set of moral and ethical frameworks helped co-opt and convince men to serve the state as soldiers. It did this by giving those without status or clear opportunities a community with which they could identify and an identity that was aligned with and connected to the ruling dynasty.Footnote 20 Ilya Berkovich has argued that individual soldiers across Central Europe and the Atlantic World internalized the principles of honor found within their unit with the hope of being respected.Footnote 21 They then used these models to judge which types of actions and emotions were to be exhibited within their military community, a place where a soldier was measured both internally and externally, with deviant behavior policed by comrades, and culprits shamed to conform. As Berkovich reveals, the military corporate identity shared by officers and men used honor to promote soldiering to economically and socially marginalized men as an acceptable profession.\n\nWith respect to Prussia and its army, Katrin and Sascha Möbius have shown how the success of the social interactions within regimental communities and their local societies, informed by a “psychology of honor,” reaffirmed their locales’ loyalty to the king, allowing for greater demands to be placed upon them during the brutal Seven Years’ War.Footnote 22 Christy Pichichero and Julia Osman have both highlighted how honor and military fraternity also influenced the First French Republic's treatment and representation of the levee en masse, as well as the subsequent armies built after the introduction of universal conscription in 1798.Footnote 23 The honor ascribed to military service and the social collateral it could bring, they conclude, not only created more humane armies in the conservative states of Europe, thanks to French military intellectuals’ engagement in a pan-European “military public sphere,” but also enabled the change in political discourse that linked mandatory military service to national citizenship.Footnote 24\n\nWhile much has recently been written on the effects of enlightened sensibility on French military culture and its subsequent links to honor and the nation, only a little has been done on the Habsburg monarchy's army in either German or English beyond the analysis of battles and campaigns.Footnote 25 The most influential treatise on the Habsburg army during the Napoleonic Wars has dismissed service in the ranks as neither “honourable [n]or desirable,” labeling conditions as “poor.” Simultaneously, it praises the common soldier's “fortitude and professionalism,” leaving us with a fractured understanding of the soldier, his motivations, and what exactly his “professionalism” was.Footnote 26\n\nLeighton James has shown a way in which to mend this gap in the historiography. He has used the written accounts of some Habsburg soldiers to shed light on their military experiences by revealing the importance of Enlightenment discourse to their perceptions of war.Footnote 27 James's work examined the presence—or lack thereof—of nationalism and patriotism in the German-speaking world's experience of the conflict. Specifically, his analysis of the accounts of Habsburg cavalry officers Karl Johann Nepomuk von Grueber and Michael Pauliny von Köwelsdam concludes that personal honor and the social identity provided by the army was the main driving force behind these men's decisions to serve. Though James's analysis establishes honor as a prime motivator, his work is not concerned with how this was developed and fostered within the army or how it related to wartime loyalty in the Habsburg monarchy.\n\nThe first part of this article builds upon this avenue of inquiry to show how honor shaped soldiers’ loyalty and experience of the conflict. It examines why Hibler was so eager to address his standing within the “military circle” of Jordis, and the reasons why he chose to avoid the violence of the duel to obtain his satisfaction. Honor provided individuals with a profession and a community where duty, rewarded with rank and then privilege, linked together men from myriads of backgrounds who were eager to attain some form of social security as soldier-citizens, men who enjoyed the securities of a corporate community earned through military service.Footnote 28 Using Hibler's account of his wartime experience and the altercation with Nachtigall as well as the service record of Jordis’ officers, this part argues that the relationship between military honor, social standing, and state legitimacy was as much a pressing concern for the men of Jordis in July 1808 as was maintaining the equilibrium of a wartime unit after a public and violent dispute.\n\nThe second part of this article investigates the reasons why Hibler was so concerned by his standing and perception within the civilian sphere of Enns. It argues that Hibler's understanding of honor in 1808, and therefore his standing with civilians, was influenced by concurrent prowar rhetoric that positioned the soldier at the forefront of dynastic patriotism. Men in the uniform of the emperor were now narrated as citizen-soldiers, representing the very best of local communities and their loyalties to the Habsburgs.Footnote 29 Yet this military motivation and rhetoric, which was primarily promulgated to equate popular military service in the Landwehr as an act of active male citizenship, was not monolithic.Footnote 30 Veteran professionals and army generals still viewed themselves as part of a separate military sphere with its own concepts of masculinity, loyalty, and citizenship that overlapped with other regional corporations, even if they were now seen by civilians as representing their local society's engagement with the monarchy's “imperial project.”"
