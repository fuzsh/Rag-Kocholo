They also act as staff officers, handling logistics, intelligence, etc. for their units.\n\nSLDF[edit]\n\nIn the SLDF, majors were regular army battalion commanders and led their troops from the front. This led to them having more experience than their house army counterparts. In the Star League Navy, a Major commanded destroyers or JumpShips transporting troops or cargo.[1]\n\nIn the Second SLDF, a naval officer at this rank was called Captain, and commanded a small WarShip, a transport JumpShip, or a wing of aerospace pilots. This naval rank was a new feature of the second SLDF, and a radical departure from the first.[2]\n\nA Major's rank insignia was the same for both SLDF incarnations: A Captain's double green bars with a silver pip between them.\n\nSLDF Rank insignia Rank Insignia (First SLDF)[3] Insignia (Second SLDF)[4] Major\n\n(Captain)\n\nLyran Commonwealth and Lyran Alliance[edit]\n\nIn the LCAF the rank equivalent of Major is Kommandant, though the senior battalion commander often carries the rank of Hauptmann-Kommandant.[5]\n\nThe Hauptmann-Kommandant is likely to be third-in-command of an LCAF regiment after the Colonel and Leutnant-Colonel.\n\nLAAF Military Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Kommandant Hauptmann-Kommandant\n\nDraconis Combine Mustered Soldiery[edit]\n\nIn the DCMS, a major was formally known as a Sho-sa, while the equivalent naval rank was Dai-i. Both officers wore the kanji for \"1\" in apple green to show their rank.[6]\n\nDCMS Officer Ranks by branch of service Rank MechWarrior Aerospace pilot Infantry Armor Artillery Naval crew\n\nDraconis Combine Admiralty Technical\n\nService Sho-sa\n\n(Major)\n\nDai-i\n\nArmed Forces of the Federated Suns[edit]\n\nIn the AFFS a major typically commands a battalion, though elite tank and BattleMech companies were sometimes commanded by a major. Majors use epaulettes with one broad base across the bottom as their symbol of rank.[7]\n\nAFFS Major insignia by branch of service Rank MechWarrior Aerospace pilot Infantry Armor Naval crew Technical\n\nService Administrative Medical Legal Logistics/\n\nTransportation Major\n\nCapellan Confederation[edit]\n\nPrior to Sun-Tzu Liao's ascension to the Celestial Throne, majors in the CCAF either commanded a 'Mech battalion or a regiment of three air squadrons. Staff officers with this rank often served in diplomatic, and logistic roles for the Senior Colonels that oversaw a Capellan Confederation commonality. The commanding officer of a Capellan Home Guard regiment was typically a major.[8] As part of the Xin Sheng movement, Sun-Tzu Liao implemented a new system of ranks that used traditional Chinese names and brought the CCAF ranks in line with the militaries of other Successor States. Officers holding the rank of major under the older system became Zhong-shaos or Lieutenant Colonels. Sao-shao is the rank used for Major after the Xin Sheng movement was implemented. The Sao-shao rank insignia is a brass bar with two silver pips.\n\nCCAF Sao-shao rank insignia Sao-shao\n\nKong-sao-shao\n\n(Major)\n\nDue to their unique place in the CCAF, Warrior House company commanders hold the rank of Lien-zhang, which is equivalent to Major.\n\nFree Worlds League[edit]\n\nThe FWLM is unique in the Inner Sphere because the militaries of the three largest provinces were integrated into one whole, but each province's military retained their existing rank structure until recently. This had meant that officers from the Marik Commonwealth could not have the rank of major, as those units used Force Commander but officers from the Duchies of Andurien and Oriente could hold the rank of major.[9] Following the reforms of Captain-General Thomas Marik, the FWLM rank structure was streamlined and the rank of Force Commander formally replaced the rank of Major. Regardless of the rank's name, FWLM officers who held it would command battalions, or garrison units that were smaller than regimental size. Prior to the Succession Wars, officers with this rank would command marines aboard DropShips, JumpShips, and WarShips.[10]\n\nIn the postâ€“Clan Invasion FWLM Navy, an officer with the rank of Force Commander is known as a Commander. Typically they serve as the executive officer of an FWLM Navy vessel. Sometimes a Commander will serve as the commanding officer of a JumpShip or DropShip while gaining the experience needed to be promoted to Captain.[11]\n\nFWLM Force Commander (Major) Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Force Commander\n\n(Commander)\n\nRim Commonality[edit]\n\nIn the Rim Commonality Guard the rank equivalent of Major is Albay.\n\nThe Clans[edit]\n\nThe Clans do not use the rank of Major. Instead a Clan warrior would have the rank of Star Captain or Star Colonel, depending on the situation. Some Clans however, notably Clan Hell's Horses, use the rank of Nova Captain to indicate a warrior who leads a Nova or Supernova.\n\nComStar/Word of Blake[edit]\n\nIn the Com Guards and Word of Blake Militia, the equivalent rank would be Demi-Precentor or Adept, depending on the soldier's time of service. ComStar Adepts use a ComStar logo with a blue halo to show their rank, while Demi-Precentor's insignia use a red-yellow-blue halo. Word of Blake Adepts use a silver medallion, while Demi-Precentors use a gold medallion with silver branch of service letter. Insignia shows theta symbol, indicating JumpShip/WarShip crew. Other service branches replace theta with appropriate Greek letter.\n\nCom Guard/Word of Blake Militia Insignia Rank Com Guards Insignia Word of Blake Militia Insignia Adept Demi-Precentor\n\nFree Rasalhague Republic[edit]\n\nIn the KungsArmÃ© officers with this rank are called Major, the Swedish term being the same as the English.[12] These soldiers wear a green patch with a silver cross as their rank insignia.\n\nKungsArmÃ© Military Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Major\n\nMagistracy of Canopus[edit]\n\nA Magistracy Armed Forces Major is a battalion commander, a position worth 24,000-45,000 C-bills but which requires the approval of the Magestrix. Prior to its reorganization, Majors could command battalions or regiments as brevet majors, but under the new MAF they may only command battalions. In the Navy, this officer rank is known as Comcapt, a combination of Commodore and Captain. Formerly they were able to command a flotilla of ships, but now only command single vessels.[13][14] A Major's rank insignia is a single gold diamond, while a Comcapt's is a single gold diamond surrounded by a wreath.\n\nMagistracy Armed Forces Insignia Rank Insignia Major Comcapt\n\nTaurian Defense Force[edit]\n\nA Brigadier in the Taurian Defense Force serves either as the commander of a 'Mech battalion or the executive officer of a conventional regiment and among the support branches. In the TDF Navy, officers who hold this rank are known as an Air Master, Senior Grade or Air Master, SG and either serves as a ship's executive officer or commands an air division.[15][16][17] Their rank insignia is a single gold ring with a small \"horn\" on the left side.\n\nTaurian Defense Force Insignia Rank Insignia Brigadier\n\nMarian Hegemony[edit]\n\nThis rank isn't used by the Marian Legions. With their focus on recreating the Roman Empire, battalion commanders hold the rank of Legatus, Latin for deputy, officer, or legion commander.[18] To show their rank, they wear a silver triangle with a black triangle in it, topped by a silver star.\n\nMarian Legions Insignia Rank Insignia Legatus\n\nOutworlds Alliance[edit]\n\nMajor isn't one of the eight ranks used by the Alliance Military Corps. The AMC identifies battalion commanders by the rank of Director.[19] A Director's insignia is a single brown bar.\n\nAlliance Military Corps Insignia Rank Insignia Director\n\nHanseatic League[edit]\n\nIn the Hanseatic League this rank name is called Major.[20]\n\nUmayyad Caliphate[edit]\n\nIn the Umayyad Caliphate this rank name is called Amir mi'a.[20]\n\nCastilian Principalities[edit]\n\nIn the Nueva Castile this rank name is called Comandante.[20]\n\nAurigan Coalition Military[edit]\n\nIn the Aurigan Coalition Military, Brigadier is an officer that typically act as battalion commanders in conventional forces.[21]\n\nMercenary[edit]\n\nArms of Thor[edit]\n\nThe Battalion Leaders of the mercenary unit Arms of Thor are called Ã–vercaptain.[22]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nRanks, when not preceding a name, are not capitalized.[23]\n\nEx: The major stood and rendered a salute to General DeChavilier.\n\nNon-English ranks, with the exception of those used by the Federated Suns or Lyrans, are italicized.[23]\n\nFor more information, see BattleTechWiki:Manual of Style\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nBibliography[edit]"
