        "text": "Luftwaffe General Staff Officers:\n\nThe General Staff has been considered the best instruments of Germany's ability to wage war since about 1806. Germany's General Staff was officially established in 1814. Since it's inception, this body of officers was responsible for the study and development of all aspects of warfare as well as creating plans for deployment or even an entire campaign.\n\nThe German General Staff selected it's members by means of a formal board based upon proven merit on the field. This position was one that was earned... not bought. Officers selected for the General Staff underwent intensive training to produce a pool of strategic and tactical experts as well as weed out the weaker and less motivated officers. The duties of the General Staff Officer would most likely alternate between line and staff duties, however, once an officer passed the initiation, he was a member of the organization for life.\n\nThe Chief of Staff of a military formation in the battlefield had the right to disagree, in writing, with the plans or orders of the commander of the unit, as well as to appeal to the commander at the next highest level. In the old days, they used to credit victories to the General Staff versus the unit commander.\n\nThe Luftwaffe established its general staff academy in 1935. It's purpose was to focus on the operational side of aerial warfare. Oddly enough, Hermann Goering was not a fan of the General Staff, as he saw them as a threat for the direction he wanted to take the Luftwaffe. As a result, the power once alloted to the General Staff before the Third Reich took power was whittled down to a small personal staff for Hitler and his top generals.\n\nThere were only about 360 positions for Luftwaffe General Staff Officers, with the ranks of Major through Oberst.\n\nThe Luftwaffe General Staff was given the waffenfarbe of Carmine on 07Jul1943\n\nI just completed reading the book that Nieson wrote on the Luftwaffe General Staff. It was translated by the US Air Force and published as some sort of training aid. It actually has the word \"Declassified\" stamped onto each page.\n\nThere are many very interesting tidbits of information in the book.\n\nIt was very interesting to see that it was specifically noted that Goring felt that the General Staff members were little more than errand boys and intentionally avoided awarding them decorations. HG felt that decorations should go to people who actually fought and purposefully declined award recommendations for General Staff members. That is why the seperate carmine waffenfarbe(and striped trousers) were so important to many members."
