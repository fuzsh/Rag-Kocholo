        "text": "Oklahoma's 33-7 victory Saturday over Baylor certainly demonstrated how easy it is to lose a quarterback. One snap, one quarterback down.\n\nSteve Collins, who broke and dislocated the little finger on his right, and throwing, hand, underwent surgery Sunday morning. He'll be out four to six weeks, Sooner officials said, and the four-week minimum seems to be pretty firm. There's not much rehabilitation involved that could speed recovery.\n\nGames with Oklahoma State, Texas and Iowa State are four, five and six weeks away on the OU schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sooners are in good at least healthy hands with Chris Melson. After bobbling several snaps Saturday, including one he controlled and took into the end zone and another that bobbled right past him to the OU 12-yard line, where it was recovered by Baylor, the Ada sophomore will be able to get better-acquainted with first-team center Mike Wise in workouts this week.\n\nTink Collins moves up to second team, said coach Gary Gibbs, and Pauls Valley walk-on freshman Joey Alfred will be the third-team quarterback.\n\nFor the record, Z-backs Ted Long and Otis Taylor also came to OU as quarterbacks.\n\nSteve Collins, who was voted offensive newcomer of the year by the Big Eight Skywriters last month, generally is thought to have the strongest arm of the Sooner quarterbacks, but it has not been needed the first two games and may not be needed this week when OU visits Arizona. The Wildcats, ranked 20th nationally, lost 24-14 Saturday night at Texas Tech.\n\nThe Sooners drove 54, 45 and 56 yards for TDs without attempting a pass, then had one incompletion on a 71-yard scoring drive late in the second quarter. Melson also threw an incompletion in the fourth period as the Sooner offense was trying to break out of a dry spell that saw them go five possessions without a first down. They were the only two passes thrown by the Sooners, who rushed 70 times for 338 yards.\n\n\"With the wet field conditions and the slick ball, and with the way we were running the ball in the first half, it made no sense for us to pass,\" said Gibbs. \"We scored four times on the first six times we had the ball, and I'll take that all day long.\"\n\nThe first pass came on second-and-1 from the OU 38 in the second period, and Melson either threw very badly or Artie Guess ran the wrong pattern. On the second attempt, coming early in the fourth period on third-and-9 from OU's 39, Melson zipped a swing pass high and tight into tailback Mike Gaddis' helmet, but it was a throw that might need to be caught in a more critical situation.\n\nNotes OU nominated strong safety Jason Belser and tailback Gaddis for the Big Eight's defensive and offensive player of the week honors.\n\nBelser had four unassisted tackles, two assisted tackles and an interception, and caused a fumble. Gaddis carried the ball 17 times for 92 yards and a pair of TDs. . . Arizona, which defeated Stanford 19-3 in its opener, gained just 97 yards rushing and 90 passing against T-Tech . . . The Sooners' 106 points are the most they've scored in the first two games since the national title year of 1975, when they scored 108 in beating Oregon 62-7 and Pittsburgh 46-10. . . OU offensive tackle Terran Manning (shoulder) didn't play against Baylor, but Gibbs anticipates his return to practice this week. BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 400110"
