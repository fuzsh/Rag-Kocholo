        "text": "Jawohl could mean “Yes, sir” in a military context, but it could also just mean “yes” in a non-military context, and in this particular context, “come in”. It might sound a bit old-fashioned.\n\nThe examples in the Wiktionary also supply a wider range of affirmating replies, although the specific example of answering the door is not present.\n\nIn German, \"ja\" or \"jawohl\" is used to signify attention, with a meaning like: \"Here I am; I am listening. What is your concern?\". Expect this answer when shouting for someone, speaking up to a clerk, or in this case, when knocking at a door. The tone and speed of then answer can then be used to gauge how much time the person has for you.\n\nAn alternative for the case of a door would be \"Herein\", which is more literally asking the person to enter.\n\nWhile only \"Jawohl\" can be used for \"Yes, sir\", I think \"jawohl\" can be used in most cases where one can use \"ja\" as interjection, it is just longer. Note that the intonation of these uses is likely different, but hard to describe.\n\nI disagree with the other answers. There is a decidedly military connotation to \"jawohl\". As a pacifist I have never in my life used this word, exept in an ironic sense when someone used a tone of ordering me, to show him that he had overstepped my limits of polite conversation. In my social circles, using the word would result in a frown, or a quip asking you to relax.\n\nThat said, for a militarily-minded person, or someone appreciating hierachies, it might be just normal to exchange \"ja\" for \"jawohl\". Under military discipline addressing a superior would always afford naming his rank, as in \"jawohl, Herr Hauptmann\". Leaving out the rank would be a logical consequence if you don't know whether the person you are talking to is your superior, or a specific rank does not apply, for example a clerk in a shop adressing a customer.\n\nIf someone puts this in the mouth of a Stasi officer in a film script, it is to characterize him as someone from a \"Prussian\" culture of discipline (\"Preußische Disziplin\" is a fixed term for unwavering dedication to your duties), and unable to communicate with other people on a basis of equality.\n\nThere is a nuance in pronounciation that also can convey a meaning. If you shout \"Jawohl!\" loudly in a parade ground voice, the pronounciation unavoidably will shorten the long -ohl to a short one: \"Jawoll!\". If you use the short -oll in a situation where it is not necessary, it can be a light, toungue-in-cheek mockery.\n\nThe most famous use in this sense might be the hit song by Hans Albers and Heinz Rühmann Jahohl, meine Herr'n, the title song for the 1937 film comedy The Man Who Was Sherlock Holmes. The two comedians play a pair of private detectives who impersonate Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to gain more business.\n\nWhile the record label did use the correct spelling \"jawohl\", what they are singing is definitely \"jawoll\" (tellingly the English WP article also uses this spelling):\n\nJawoll, meine Herrn, die Sorgen sind fern,\n\nwir tun was uns gefällt.\n\nUnd wer uns stört,\n\nist eh er's noch begreift,\n\nlängst von uns schon eingeseift.\n\nJawoll, meine Herrn,\n\ndarauf können Sie schwörn,\n\njawoll,\n\njawoll,\n\njawoll.\n\n\"Jawohl\" is a \"yes\" with more emphasis, as an exclamation, and it's usage is definitely dated. It's comparable, depending on context, to \"yes, indeed!\", \"yes, please!\" or \"yes, Sir!\". It has some connotation of a soldierly attitude. It was more popular at times when the public display of readiness and determination was culturally encouraged. I don't think it's used today without comic intent, to mock precisely this attitude.\n\nThe described context answering the knock on the door is the \"yes, please!\" variant, which alternatively might be \"come in\" in English.\n\nIn modern usage you would just use \"ja, bitte\" or \"herein\" to answer a knock.\n\nJawohl is relatively common in German military context (probably because a simple \"ja\" can be easily missed or mis-understood as \"na\", or other interjections (just like English-speaking military sometimes uses \"affirmative\" instead of a simple \"yes\" to avoid miscommunication). Many people with a military background seem to be using \"jawohl\" instead of \"ja\" all the time, even in private life.\n\nEven if it is typically used to note a \"yes\" to persons of higher rank, in the described situation it could very well be a general knocking (a nice one would) - how should the Stasi colonel know through the closed door? So he would answer any knock with \"jawohl\", simply to stay on the safe side."
