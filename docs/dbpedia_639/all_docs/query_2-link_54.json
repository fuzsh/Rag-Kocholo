        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am new to this forum and would be very grateful for any information on the following photographs. They are of my German grandfather. I am researching and compiling a family history for my children, and am having some success with my English grandfather, who was lieutenant commander of the Ark Royal, but do not know where to start on the German side, and would like to provide a balanced account for them. Thank you again.\n\nClick to enlarge the picture\n\nThe photos seem to depict service over time. The top photo with rifle is a bit too fuzzy but it looks like Opa is wearing an early Heer (Army) transitional uniform. Need a clearer photo. Later, it appears he went up through officer ranks in a Luftwaffe (Air Force) related position. The bottom left photo seems to show an early \"droop tail\" Luftwaffe breast eagle. Others need to weigh in on these photos. NH"
