        "text": "Description\n\nPair of Police Officer's shoulder-boards as intended for a 'Hauptmann der Schutzpolizei'. The police were divided into eight assorted branches of service and during the restructuring the different police agencies were assigned specific identifying 'Truppenfarbe' (Branch Colors), with the green truppenfarbe being allocated to the 'Schutzpolizei des Reichs' (National Protection Police). The German Police had no enlisted ranks with the lowest rank being an 'Unterwachtmeister' which was equivalent to the German army rank of Unteroffizier. This is a pair of 'Schutzpolizei' shoulder-boards having two rank pips attached as intended for a 'Hauptmann der Schutzpolizei'. The boards are constructed from silver braid on a green woolen underlay. The boards are complete with their slip-on tongues. Officer's rank police shoulder-boards are very hard to find. Nice original pair in good used condition!"
