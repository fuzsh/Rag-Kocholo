The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 11:10 a.m., in Room 2318 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Brad Miller [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. hearing charter SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES EPA's Restructured IRIS System: Have Polluters and Politics Overwhelmed Science? wednesday, may 21, 2008 11:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. 2318 rayburn house office building The Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight will hold the first of two hearings on the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We have three excellent witnesses who can place the role of IRIS in perspective as well as address questions regarding the Bush Administration's evolving system to draft and review IRIS entries: Mr. John Stephenson, Director, Natural Resources and Environment, Government Accountability Office. Dr. George Gray, Assistant Administrator for Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. Susan Dudley, Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. What Is IRIS and Why Does It Matter? IRIS was established in the 1980s to provide a single source of information on the risks associated with exposure to chemicals. The IRIS database provides a hazard identification and dose-response analysis, scientific information that when combined with estimates of exposure allow regulatory agencies to produce a risk assessment. Historically, entries to the database were the result of extensive in- house development by the science staff at EPA, peer review processes with experts from outside the agency, and opportunities for public input and comment. To the degree interagency communications occurred, they were managed by EPA (See Figure 1). While not a regulatory product itself, IRIS is designed to help regulators set priorities about what to regulate and inform regulators about what level of exposure workers or communities can absorb safely. A long-recognized principle in the U.S. approach to regulation has been the distinction between risk assessment--the characterization of what science tells us regarding a particular hazard--and risk management, or what you want to do about the hazard (including choosing to do nothing). Science can point to where regulation may be needed, but science may not be the sole consideration in setting a regulatory standard or approach. IRIS is designed to be a risk assessment tool. Government officials in federal agencies, in State and county governments and even in foreign countries, have come to rely upon IRIS for the most reliable, most comprehensive statements on what science tells us about the risk associated with a particular chemical. A long-standing challenge for the IRIS database is meeting the requests for information on the many chemicals that are manufactured and utilized in global commerce, and updating information on chemicals that have been previously evaluated. IRIS is loosing ground to the torrent of new chemicals introduced to the marketplace. Approximately 700 new chemicals enter commerce each year. Those new chemicals are added to the over 80,000 currently reported under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as being in the market. In addition, about one half of the assessments on approximately 480 chemicals currently in the database need to be updated according to EPA staff estimates. To keep IRIS relevant would require aggressive moves to speed the production and approval of entries. Congress has actually increased funding for IRIS staff in recent years in an effort to address this severe backlog (this committee supported increased funding in Chairman Boehlert's FY 2007 Views and Estimates Report to the Committee on the Budget--see Figure 2 for a representation of the IRIS budget). IRIS Slows to a Crawl Instead of seeing IRIS entries spike with funding and personnel increases, additions and updates to IRIS have slowed to a crawl (Figure 3). Only four IRIS listings have been finalized in the past two years. In comparison, the State of Minnesota requested new or updated assessments of 52 chemicals of concern in the 2006 solicitation for the 2007 Program.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Submission by the Minnesota Department of Health to the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS); Request for Chemical Substance Nominations for the 2007 Program. Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-ORD- 2006-0950. This outcome appears to be tied to the intervention of OMB in the IRIS review and approval process. Beginning in 2004, OMB established a formal system of interagency review (Figure 5). This system, ostensibly designed to improve the quality of IRIS entries, appears to have all but stopped IRIS entries. On April 10 of this year, EPA announced a new IRIS review and approval system that is even more elaborate than its predecessors (Figure 4). It appears that any IRIS listing that is the least bit controversial will take six years or more to be completed. The interagency process allows agencies with a direct conflict of interest multiple opportunities to influence the development and content of IRIS assessments all within a process that lacks any transparency for Congress or the public. The Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and NASA all are responsible for pollution on the federal lands they manage and for the health and safety of the personnel that manage their facilities and operations. Rocket fuel, jet fuel, solvents, munitions, nuclear waste all contain hazardous materials that can become pollutants contaminating aquifers and air, and exposing workers and families to real harm. IRIS Entries Become a Political Science EPA leadership has agreed to OMB establishing a review that gives polluting agencies lengthy, unmonitored opportunities to try to convince OMB that the risks of a particular substance should not be set at a particular level. It is hard to understand what special science expertise these other agencies bring to the table such that OMB needs to set up an interagency review to discuss science. Remember that the development of IRIS assessments and, the risk assessment process generally, is supposed to be separate from the risk management process. There you would expect interested parties, including other federal agencies, to discuss how to manage risks by weighing costs and benefits in a search for the best option given a particular configuration of risk and need. IRIS is supposed to be solely about what science says regarding health and environmental risk associated with the listed chemicals. With 7000 scientists, and mandated by law and appropriation to be the Nation's lead agency on environmental science, EPA really has no peers when it comes to understanding the science at stake in IRIS listings. The process established on April 10 allowing agencies to discuss a particular IRIS listing is closed to the public. Because that work represents pre-deliberative discussions, any materials from that process are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Because these processes are managed by OMB, it will be very difficult for Congress to learn of what is happening due to OMB's consistent assertions that all of their work should be shielded from Congress and the public. Whether the proposals that come out of this lengthy, secretive process are based solely on science, or whether other considerations held sway, would be very hard for anyone to ever prove. IRIS is withering. It is loosing its relevance due to the sweep of time, new science and new substances as well as its own inability to refresh its data. The process put in place on April 10 appears guaranteed not to improve this situation, but to make it worse. But even if the process was somehow producing more entries, more quickly, the integrity of the process is itself in question and that alone will undermine the utility of the IRIS database. If policy-makers and the public believe the science has been cooked to meet a polluter's agenda, then they will not have confidence in the science. It is a simple problem and one that the April 10 revision puts at center stage. The Subcommittee hopes to explore these issues with witnesses on Wednesday morning. The Minnesota Department of Health Submission to the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS); Request for Chemical Substance Nominations for 2007 Program (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-ORD-2006-0950) The Health Risk Assessment staff at the Minnesota Department of Health wish to nominate a list of chemicals to be included in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS); Request for Chemical Substance Nomination for 2007 Program. These chemicals are of concern to the Minnesota Department of Health because they are among contaminants found in Minnesota groundwater. In Minnesota, health-based values are derived for such contaminants. When conducting risk assessments, the Minnesota Department of Health has relied upon the IRIS summaries as a resource for the development of these health protective values. Therefore, it is our hope that you take our nominated chemicals in consideration. By obtaining IRIS summaries of these chemicals it will result in a more thorough and accurate risk assessment process. 1,2,3--Trichloropropane 1--Methylnaphtalene 1--Methylphenol 2,2--Dichloropropane 2,3,4,5--Tetrachlorophenol 2,3,5,6--Tetrachloroterephthalic acid 2,6--dinitrotoluene 2,6--diethylaniline (Alchlor degradate) 2--Nitrophenol 3,5--Dichlorophenol 4--Isopropyl toluene Acetochlor ESA Acetochlor OA Alachlor ESA (degradate of Alachlor) Alachlor OA (degradate of Alachlor) Aluminum Deaminated diketomethribuzin (degradate of Metribuzin) Deaminated metribuzin (degradate of Metribuzin) Deethylatrazine (degradate of Atrazine and Propazine) Deisopropylatrazine (degradate of Atrazine, Cyanazine and Simazine) Diallate Diazion Dichlorofluoromethane Diketometribuzin (degradate of Metribuzin) Dimethenamid Dimethenamid ESA (degradate of Demethenamid) Dimethenamid OXA (degradate of Dimethenamid) Ethafluralin Hydroxyatrazine Iron Isopropyl ether Isoxaflutole Lithium Metolachlor ESA Metsulfuron-methyl (Ally) Monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalic acid n-Butylbenzene Nicosulfuron n-Propylbenzene Primisulfuron-methyl (Beacon) Radionuclides (all) Sec-Butylbenzene Sodium Thifensulfuron methyl Tin Total petroleum hydrocarbons Tribenuron-methyl Triclopyr Trinitro-phenylmethylnitramine Triphenyltin hydroxide Vanadium In addition, the Minnesota Department of Health currently needs and uses reference concentrations and reference doses for less than chronic periods of exposure to assess risks from a variety of exposure scenarios. These scenarios include less than chronic exposures that commonly occur at contaminated sites resulting in the need for less than chronic toxicity values to assess current risks. The EPA 2002 ``A review of the reference dose and reference concentration processes'' has guided much of the practice of the Department in this area. The Department has found that health effects that result from less than chronic periods of exposure, when combined with high drinking water exposures associated with specific life stages (e.g., childhood), result in drinking water values that are lower and therefore more appropriate as drinking water standards for the general population than the value calculated using a chronic reference dose and lifetime average dose. As a result, the Department is very interested in recent efforts by IRIS to develop less than lifetime reference values, and urges the EPA to continue to develop and publish these analyses. The Department also urges the EPA to consider the potential that effects observed in chronic studies result from early exposures rather than continuous exposure. To the extent that studies are available; the Department urges the EPA to present acute, short-term, longer-term, and chronic evaluations (recommendations for critical studies for each and resulting reference doses) for each chemical that undergoes review in the future. Chairman Miller. Good morning. This hearing will now come to order. More than 80,000 chemicals are now in use, and another 700 new chemicals enter the marketplace each year. Americans need an efficient system to evaluate the risk to public health and the environment of chemicals on a regular basis and to have ready access to that information. That is the mission of the Integrated Risk Information System, or IRIS, but IRIS now has evaluations of only about 480 chemicals. In recent years, IRIS's assessments have not been the open discussions among scientists we associate with scientific peer review but have become a secretive process managed by OMB. OMB's mission does not include scientific analysis, nor does OMB appear to have the expertise to perform such work. As a result of OMB's control of IRIS evaluation procedures, however, four chemicals have been listed by IRIS in the last two fiscal years. EPA scientists produced 15 or so assessments in each of those years, but the assessments disappeared into an abyss of elaborate, endless reviews, mostly behind closed doors. A weighing of the need for assessments against the productivity under IRIS appears to show that the system is fundamentally broken and in desperate need of reform. Instead, EPA and OMB appear intent upon choking productivity under IRIS further still and depriving the assessments of what credibility they have left. Just last month, EPA unveiled its new process for developing and reviewing IRIS assessments. The solution offered by EPA and OMB is to take an already-broken system and to make it more convoluted, more secretive, and more suspect. The new system establishes an interagency process that gives polluting agencies even more opportunity than they had before to slow walk the IRIS process to avoid the consequences of their own conduct. With the new process announced April 10, we may view two new entries a year as the golden era of IRIS assessments. As GAO will testify this morning, it is highly likely that no new chemical entry that is the least bit controversial will ever come out of this system in less than six years and probably more like eight years. If the goal of the IRIS review process is to produce new IRIS entries, this system, designed by OMB and dutifully blessed by EPA's leadership, would be judged an abysmal failure. However, if the goal is to avoid new IRIS entries, or at least troublesome, inconvenient entries, this new system should perform beautifully. It effectively kills IRIS without honestly acknowledging that intent. How does it kill IRIS? Any new entry or revision that will make it into IRIS will be of very dubious reliability. Any entries that make it into IRIS will emerge from a largely secretive process that allows polluters to urge EPA to shift its science so that it is acceptable to the polluting agencies. The public will never have confidence that EPA stood firm on scientific principle or fought off the combined forces of OMB, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, or any other agencies that may have a desire to avoid cleaning up their practices or their messes. If the science appears to have been reworked behind closed doors to protect the interests of polluters, at the instance of polluters, who can believe the science? The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, at OMB say that they are just managing an interagency process. That is a fiction. EPA is the agency that Congress directed in statute to do environmental science and charged with protecting public health and the environment. EPA is given billions of dollars a year in tax funds to carry out that research and regulatory work. There is no need for the secretive interagency process that OMB is requiring. The Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy have entirely different missions and entirely different areas of expertise. Their interest in IRIS is that of an agency using the very chemicals that are being evaluated, not of a scientific agency making decisions based upon science. OMB is using that interagency process to undermine IRIS's integrity and take it away from EPA's control. EPA says that this really is their process, honest. They control it and are happy with it, but it is headed by political appointees. Dr. Gray is a political appointee. His testimony has been vetted and approved by OMB. EPA's official response even to the GAO report we will hear today was vetted and approved by OMB. And no IRIS entry can go forward without OMB approval. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee this week, just yesterday, held a hearing and issued a report that demonstrates the degree to which the White House has controlled the opinions of the EPA scientists on regulatory matters. With IRIS, we see that even in the realm of science, before policy should have a role, before economic consideration should have a role, EPA appears to follow the dictates of OMB. Thousands of career scientists must answer to political appointees without scientific expertise not about how to manage risk, whether risk management measures are justified by the economic costs, but about what risks chemicals pose to public health and to the environment in the first place, a question in which political considerations should have no role. Whatever your personal views of motive or intent by the EPA, the political leadership of the EPA, or by OMB, I hope almost everyone would agree that two new entries a year when 700 chemicals are entering the marketplace every year, is just not acceptable. I look forward to GAO's testimony today for offering advice to Congress on how to make IRIS relevant again and responsive to the needs of the American public again and not just to agencies that are using chemicals and do not want to be disturbed, do not want to be inconvenienced, and their friends at OIRA.

Chairman Miller. At this time I would like to recognize Mr. Reichert of Washington who is sitting in for Mr. Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin. Mr. Reichert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to submit a statement from Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and a memo from the EPA into the Committee records. Chairman Miller. Without objection. Mr. Reichert. I yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sensenbrenner follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) process was originally developed for a specific task. Different offices throughout the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were relying on different assessments of the health effects of chronic exposure to toxic chemicals. IRIS was intended to establish a uniform database within EPA. Over time, however, IRIS became an authoritative resource on chemical toxicity. Other agencies, states, the international community, and industries increasingly began to rely on IRIS, and the assessments took on increased importance. These outside groups have sought to impact a process that was not initially designed to handle external pressures. The result has been an IRIS process that has effectively broken down. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently issued a scathing condemnation of the current state of the IRIS program. The report's title, Low Productivity and New Interagency Review Process Limit the Usefulness and Credibility of EPA's Integrated Risk Information System, accurately sums up GAO's findings. But IRIS' actual production numbers are worse. EPA currently has a backlog of 70 ongoing assessments and has managed to complete only two assessments in each of the last two years. At the current pace, it will take 35 years for EPA to finish its current backlog. EPA has attempted to develop a uniform process for IRIS assessments. The agency argues that it can expedite the IRIS process by involving other agencies earlier in the process. While preventing last minute delays is an important reform, the ability of other agencies to extend the timeframe of assessments should be sharply limited. Data gaps in risk assessments will always exist as better science is always developing. EPA needs to limit the timeframe of assessments to prevent other agencies from indefinitely delaying the process. EPA must balance its need to complete assessments with the rights of interested parties to comment. The best way to achieve this balance would be to give more notice of its assessments. EPA already publishes an annual agenda of the chemical it intends to assess in the Federal Register. If EPA moves the date of that publication forward, providing more notice, interested parties will have a longer period to comment on what they deem to be insufficiencies in the scientific record. During this comment period, EPA can focus on its backlog. Because it offered a comment period, EPA can then fairly limit the ability of outside parties to delay assessments once they are underway. The result would be a more efficient process that preserves taxpayers' money and promotes public health. I urge EPA to consider these proposals, because IRIS must be fixed. In April, this subcommittee held a hearing on formaldehyde levels in trailers provided to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. In that hearing, we investigated how the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry struggled to identify the proper ``level of concern'' for long-term exposure to formaldehyde. EPA determined its formaldehyde assessment was outdated in 1997, but eleven years later, that assessment is still incomplete. These hurricane victims are the real world result of EPA's bureaucratic failures. [The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Jerry F. Costello Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Subcommittee's attention to this important matter. The role of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) IRIS program cannot be understated. Created in the 1980s, the program is a primary resource for information on the risks associated to exposure of chemicals. Government officials, State and local governments and many scientists have come to rely on the comprehensive analysis completed by the IRIS program. However, the rate at which information requests have been processed over the years is troubling. Recent revisions to the program have received conflicting reviews as to whether these steps will increase productivity or continue to slow the process further. A March 2008 GAO report concluded that the IRIS database is at serious risk of becoming incomplete because EPA has not been able to routinely complete timely, credible assessments or decrease its backlog of 70 ongoing assessments. That a total of four assessments were completed over the course of fiscal years 2006 and 2007 is unacceptable. I look forward to hearing our witnesses' testimony today and working with my colleagues on the Committee to improve and increase efficiency within this important program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. [The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect both environmental quality and human health through effective regulations and other policy implementation. What is confounding to me, regarding the Integrated Risk Information System, is why only four IRIS listings have been finalized in the past two years. After all, approximately 700 new chemicals enter commerce each year. There are more than 80,000 chemicals reported under the Toxic Substances Control Act as being in the market. It seems implausible to me that only four chemicals should be investigated to completion and published in the IRIS database at E.P.A. The Government Accountability Office report, published in March 2008, concluded that, ``the IRIS database is at serious risk of becoming obsolete because E.P.A. has not been able to routinely complete timely, credible assessments or decrease its backlog of 70 ongoing assessments.'' The statement of George M. Gray, Ph.D., who is Assistant Administrator for Research and Development at E.P.A., explains that IRIS began as ``an internal E.P.A. resource.'' Even if that explanation is true, then why would E.P.A. compile only four IRIS listings in the past two years? It makes me question what E.P.A. is doing, when it comes to chemical toxicity and public health. Dr. Gray's statement also says that the risk assessment process ``consists of both `science' and `science policy' components.'' It goes on to say that, ``although there are some instances at E.P.A. where `pure science' is involved, . . . much of the work done at E.P.A. . . . involves both science and science policy. . . .Due to the uncertainty in IRIS assessments, judgments and choices must be made about the most appropriate assumptions . . . to use in deriving toxicity data.'' Mr. Chairman, I chafe at this testimony. These statements insult the scientific community that publishes data on these matters. They also insult the talented scientists who are working at E.P.A., who are perfectly capable of interpreting peer- reviewed literature and making public health decisions. This subcommittee has concerns that the IRIS system has become politicized, when it should be based solely on scientific facts regarding health and environmental risk associated with the listed chemicals. Although I understand that E.P.A. is making moves to re-evaluate the IRIS System, there are only so many patches that may be placed on a sinking ship. For me, what is truly sinking is the feeling I get when I consider the good scientists who have dedicated their entire careers to environmental safety at E.P.A. I suspect that those who remain must be frustrated at this gross politicization of science and wide scale destruction of our environment. Mr. Chairman, you will know that I have a near-perfect voting record with environmental groups, and I will be swift to act, should I see a way to rectify the situation. Thank you, and I yield back the remainder of my time. Panel I: Chairman Miller. It is now my pleasure to introduce our witnesses today.

Then Mr. Stephenson, please begin. TESTIMONY OF MR. JOHN B. STEPHENSON, DIRECTOR, NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE Mr. Stephenson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other Members of the Committee. I am here today to discuss our recently issued report on IRIS, a database that contains the scientific position on health effects of exposure to more than 540 toxic chemicals. IRIS is a critical component of EPA's capacity to support scientifically sound environmental decisions, policies, and regulations. Our March 2008 report concluded that the IRIS database is at serious risk of becoming obsolete because EPA has not been able to complete timely, credible assessments or decrease its back-load of 70 ongoing assessments. In summary, we found that EPA efforts to improve IRIS since 2000 have been thwarted by a combination of factors including OMB interagency reviews, EPA decisions to delay assessments to wait for new research or additional uncertainty analysis, and the compounding effect of continuous delays. The two new OMB interagency reviews involve other federal agencies in a manner that limits the credibility of IRIS assessment and hinders EPA's ability to manage them. In addition, OMB is inserting itself into the decision-making process by, for example, requiring EPA to terminate five assessments EPA's own office of theirs said that it needed to implement the Clean Air Act. The effect of all of these changes to what should be a scientific process is that chemicals remain in the assessment phase indefinitely, and few assessments are ever finalized. Indeed, EPA staff have prepared over 32 draft assessments of toxic chemicals in the past two years, yet only four have been finalized. Our report includes eight specific recommendations for streamlining the IRIS program, improving the transparency and credibility of the assessments, and ensuring that EPA has the requisite independence to achieve its goals, recommendations that EPA in February agreed to consider before finalizing the IRIS process. However, EPA released its final IRIS process on April 10th as you mentioned, and instead of seeking public comment, as OMB promised in responding to our report, made it effective immediately. To say that we are disappointed is a gross understatement. The new IRIS process is not responsive to our recommendations and is in many respects worse than the draft we reviewed. For example, the draft process would have made comments from other federal agencies part of the public record. However, the new process expressly defined such comments as deliberative, excluding them from the public record. EPA's position that the IRIS process is transparent because final assessments must undergo public and external peer review is ludicrous. Transparency at a late stage after OMB and other federal agencies have had multiple opportunities to influence the content of the assessment without any disclosure of their input does not compensate for its absence earlier. In addition, the estimated timeframes under the new process will likely perpetuate the cycle of delays and exacerbate the problems we identified in our report and sought to address with our recommendations, all of which were aimed at preserving the viability of this critical database which is integral to EPA's mission of protecting the public health from exposure to toxic chemicals. Instead of significantly streamlining IRIS, EPA has institutionalized an assessment process from the outset that will take 6 to 8 years to complete. We all understand that science regarding the toxicity of a given chemical is never perfect, but at some point EPA must complete assessments so that it can take the next step of exploring what regulatory options are appropriate for protecting human health. My testimony includes several examples of dangerous chemicals that are stuck in the endless loop of assessment and reassessment. I would like to summarize just one very quickly. In 1998, EPA initiated a toxic risk assessment of trichloroethylene, a degreasing agent used widely by the Department of Defense and others. Numerous studies have linked TCE to cancer and birth defects over the last decade. EPA completed a draft risk assessment in 2001 which was then peer reviewed by the science advisory board and released for public comment. During the comment process, questions were raised about the assessment by DOD and others that led to a request for the National Academies of Science to review it in 2004. In 2006, the Academies concluded that the weight of evidence of cancer from TCE had actually strengthened since EPA's 2001 assessment. Nevertheless, after more than 10 years, TCE is back at the draft development stage, and the public continues to be exposed to this dangerous chemical. EPA estimates that its final assessment will not be completed until 2010. In frustration, five Senators, spurred by the TCE contamination in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, introduced a bill last year that would require EPA to complete its risk assessment and issue a drinking water standard within 18 months. Mr. Chairman, IRIS is a critical process that is clearly broken and needs to be fixed. We believe that the Congress should consider directing EPA to suspend implementation of its new process and develop one that is transparent and otherwise responsive to our recommendations. If EPA is unable or unwilling to take the steps necessary to improve this critical program, we believe that other approaches including legislative action may be needed. That concludes my comments, and I will be happy to take questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Stephenson follows:] Prepared Statement of John B. Stephenson Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased to be here today to discuss issues associated with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)--one of the most significant tools that EPA has developed to effectively support its mission of protecting people and the environment from harmful chemical exposures. IRIS contains EPA's scientific position on the potential human health effects that may result from exposure to more than 540 chemicals in the environment and is a critical component of EPA's capacity to support scientifically sound risk management decisions, policies, and regulations. IRIS is also relied upon by State and local environmental programs and some international regulatory bodies for managing their environmental protection programs. As shown in Figure 1, the toxicity assessments in the IRIS database fulfill the first two critical steps of the four-step risk assessment process--providing hazard identification and quantitative dose-response assessments. IRIS information can then be used with the results of exposure assessments (typically conducted by EPA's program or regional offices) to provide an overall characterization of the public health risks for a given chemical in a given situation. The development of health risk assessments is thus directly dependent on the development of toxicity assessments such as those developed in the IRIS program. Under the National Academies' risk assessment and risk management paradigm, policy considerations are relevant in the risk management phase, which occurs after the risk assessment phase.\\1\\ With risk assessment information, decision-makers can make informed risk management decisions on how to protect public health, reflecting other important data and considerations, such as the costs and benefits of mitigating identified risks, the technological feasibility of managing risks, and the concerns of various stakeholders. Examples of risk management decisions include deciding how much of a chemical a company may discharge into a river, determining the extent to which a hazardous waste site must be cleaned up, and setting allowable levels of contamination in drinking water. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The National Academies comprises four organizations: the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thus, although IRIS assessments are not regulatory in nature, the quantitative IRIS values may influence many risk management decisions and serve as a basis for regulatory consideration. However, EPA's productivity in finalizing IRIS assessments is poor, and EPA has a significant backlog of incomplete IRIS assessments and a growing number of outdated assessments. Importantly, EPA has not been able to complete assessments of key chemicals of concern to public health, including dioxin, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene (TCE), naphthalene, and tetrachloroethylene (perc) (see Appendix I). In this context, my testimony today discusses (1) highlights of our March 2008 report, Chemical Assessments: Low Productivity and New Interagency Review Process Limit the Usefulness and Credibility of EPA's Integrated Risk Information System\\2\\ and (2) key aspects of EPA's revised IRIS assessment process, released on April 10, 2008. For our March 2008 report, we examined the outcome of steps EPA has taken to ensure that IRIS contains current, credible chemical risk information; to address the backlog of ongoing assessments; and to respond to new requirements from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We also examined the potential effects of planned changes to the IRIS assessment process on EPA's ability to ensure that IRIS provides current, credible risk information. In conducting our work, we obtained and analyzed information on EPA's productivity and the resources provided to the program for fiscal years 2000 through 2007, user needs, and EPA's assessment completion goals. We also interviewed EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment officials who manage the IRIS assessment program; officials from other EPA program offices and federal science and health agencies involved in the IRIS assessment process; and officials from the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and OMB. For this testimony, we supplemented our report with a review of the IRIS assessment process that EPA released on April 10, 2008. We conducted this work from May 7 to May 21, 2008, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ GAO-08-440 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 7, 2008). Background IRIS was created in 1985 to help EPA develop consensus opinions within the agency about the health effects of chronic exposure to chemicals. Its importance has increased over time as EPA program offices and the states have increasingly relied on IRIS information in making environmental protection decisions. Currently, the IRIS database contains assessments of more than 540 chemicals. According to EPA, national and international users access the IRIS database approximately nine million times a year. EPA's Assistant Administrator for the Office of Research and Development has described IRIS as the premier national and international source for qualitative and quantitative chemical risk information; other federal agencies have noted that IRIS data are widely accepted by all levels of government across the country for application of public health policy, providing benefits such as uniform, standardized methods for toxicology testing and risk assessment, as well as uniform toxicity values. Similarly, a private- sector risk assessment expert has stated that the IRIS database has become the most important source of regulatory toxicity values for use across EPA's programs and is also widely used across State programs and internationally. Historically and currently, the focus of IRIS toxicity assessments has been on the potential health effects of long-term (chronic) exposure to chemicals. According to OMB, EPA is the only federal agency that develops qualitative and quantitative assessments of both cancer and non-cancer risks of exposure to chemicals, and EPA does so largely under the IRIS program. Other federal agencies develop quantitative estimates of non-cancer effects or qualitative cancer assessments of exposure to chemicals in the environment. While these latter assessments provide information on the effects of long-term exposures to chemicals, they provide only qualitative assessments of cancer risks (known human carcinogen, likely human carcinogen, etc.) and not quantitative estimates of cancer potency, which are required to conduct quantitative risk assessments. EPA's IRIS assessment process has undergone a number of formal and informal changes during the past several years. While the process used to develop IRIS chemical assessments includes numerous individual steps or activities, major assessment steps include (1) a review of the scientific literature; (2) preparation of a draft IRIS assessment; (3) internal EPA reviews of draft assessments; (4) two OMB/interagency reviews, managed by OMB, that provide input from OMB as well as from other federal agencies, including those that may be affected by the IRIS assessments if they lead to regulatory or other actions; (5) an independent peer review conducted by a panel of experts; and (6) the completion of a final assessment that is posted to the IRIS web site. Unlike many other EPA programs that have statutory requirements, including specific time frames for completing mandated tasks, the IRIS program is not subject to statutory requirements or timeframes. In contrast, the Department of Human Health and Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), which develops quantitative estimates of the non-cancer effects of exposures to chemicals in the environment, is statutorily required to complete its assessments within certain timeframes. Findings and Recommendations from Our March 2008 Report on the Productivity and Credibility of EPA's Integrated Risk Information System The IRIS database is at serious risk of becoming obsolete because the agency has not been able to routinely complete timely, credible assessments or decrease a backlog of 70 ongoing assessments. Specifically, although EPA has taken important steps to improve the IRIS program and productivity since 2000 and has developed a number of draft assessments for external review, its efforts to finalize the assessments have been thwarted by a combination of factors including the imposition of external requirements, the growing complexity and scope of risk assessments, and certain EPA management decisions. In addition, the changes to the IRIS assessment process that EPA was considering at the time of our review would have added to the already unacceptable level of delays in completing IRIS assessments and further limited the credibility of the assessments. EPA's Efforts to Improve the IRIS Assessment Program Have Not Produced the Desired Results EPA has taken a number of steps to help ensure that IRIS contains current, credible chemical risk information; to address its backlog of ongoing assessments; and to respond to new OMB requirements. However, to date, these changes--including increasing funding, centralizing staff conducting assessments, and revising the assessment process--have not enabled EPA to routinely complete credible IRIS assessments or decrease the backlog. That is, although EPA sent 32 draft assessments for external review in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the agency finalized only four IRIS assessments during this time (see Fig. 2). Several key factors have contributed to EPA's inability to achieve a level of productivity that is needed to sustain the IRIS program and database: new OMB-required reviews of IRIS assessments by OMB and other federal agencies; the growing complexity and scope of risk assessments; certain EPA management decisions and issues, including delaying completion of some assessments to await new research or to develop enhanced analyses of uncertainty in the assessments; and the compounding effect of delays. Regarding the last factor, even a single delay in the assessment process can lead to the need to essentially repeat the assessment process to take into account changes in science and methodologies. A variety of delays have impacted the majority of the 70 assessments being conducted as of December 2007--48 had been in process for more than five years, and 12 of those for more than nine years. These time frames are problematic because of the substantial rework such cases often require to take into account changing science and methodologies before they can be completed. For example, EPA's assessment of the cancer risks stemming from exposure to naphthalene--a chemical used in jet fuel and in the production of widely used commercial products such as moth balls, dyes, insecticides, and plasticizers--was nearing completion in 2006. However, prior to finalizing this assessment, which had been ongoing for over four years, EPA decided that the existing non-cancer assessment had become outdated and essentially restarted the assessment to include both cancer and non-cancer effects. As a result, six years after the naphthalene assessment began, it is now back at the drafting stage. The assessment now will need to reflect relevant research completed since the draft underwent initial external peer review in 2004, and it will have to undergo all of the IRIS assessment steps again, including the additional internal and external reviews that are now required (see Appendix I). Further, because EPA staff time continues to be dedicated to completing assessments in the backlog, EPA's ability to both keep the more than 540 existing assessments up to date and initiate new assessments is limited. Importantly, EPA program offices and State and local entities have requested assessments of hundreds of chemicals not yet in IRIS, and EPA data as of 2003 indicated that the assessments of 287 chemicals in the database may be outdated--that is, new information could change the risk estimates currently in IRIS or enable EPA to develop additional risk estimates for chemicals in the database (for example, developing a cancer potency estimate for assessments with only non-cancer estimates). In addition, because EPA's 2003 data are now more than four years old, it is likely that more assessments may be outdated now. The consequences of not having current, credible IRIS information can be significant. EPA's inability to complete its assessment of formaldehyde, which the agency initiated in 1997 to update information already in IRIS on the chemical, has had a significant impact on EPA's air toxics program. Although in 2003 and 2004, the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) had released updates to major epidemiological studies of industrial workers that showed a relationship between formaldehyde and certain cancers, including leukemia, EPA did not move forward to finalize an IRIS assessment incorporating these important data. Instead, EPA opted to await the results of another update to the National Cancer Institute study. While this additional research was originally estimated to take, at most, 18 months to complete, at the time of our report (more than three years later) the update was not complete. In the absence of this information, EPA's Office of Air and Radiation decided to use risk information developed by an industry- funded organization--the CIIT Centers for Health Research--for a national emissions standard. This decision was a factor in EPA exempting certain facilities with formaldehyde emissions from the national emissions standard. The CIIT risk estimate indicates a potency about 2,400 times lower than the estimate in IRIS that was being re- evaluated and that did not yet consider the 2003 and 2004 National Cancer Institute and NIOSH epidemiological studies. According to an EPA official, an IRIS cancer risk factor based on the 2003 and 2004 National Cancer Institute and NIOSH studies would likely be close to the current IRIS assessment, which EPA has been reevaluating since 1997. The discrepancy between these two risk estimates raises concerns about whether the public health is adequately protected in the absence of current IRIS information. For example, in 1999, EPA published a national assessment that provided information about the types and amounts of air toxics to which people are exposed. The assessment, which also used the CIIT risk estimate for formaldehyde, concluded, for example, that formaldehyde did not contribute significantly to the overall cancer risk in the State of New Jersey. However, in carrying out its own risk assessment on formaldehyde, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection opted to use the risk information that is currently in IRIS (dating back to 1991) and found that the contribution from formaldehyde to overall cancer risk in New Jersey is quite significant, second only to diesel particulate matter. (Appendix I provides additional information on EPA's IRIS assessment for formaldehyde.) One of the factors that has contributed to EPA's inability to complete assessments in a timely manner--the new OMB-directed OMB/ interagency review process--also limits the credibility of the assessments because it lacks transparency. Specifically, neither the comments nor the changes EPA makes to the scientific IRIS assessments in response to the comments made by OMB and other federal agencies, including those whose workload and resource levels could be affected by the assessments, are disclosed. In addition, the OMB/interagency reviews have hindered EPA's ability to independently manage its IRIS assessments. For example, without communicating its rationale for doing so, OMB directed EPA to terminate five IRIS assessments that for the first time addressed acute, rather than chronic exposure--even though EPA initiated this type of assessment to help it implement the Clean Air Act. The Expansion of Agencies' Roles in IRIS Assessments That EPA Was Considering at the Time of Our Review Would Have Caused Further Delays and Limited the Assessments' Credibility For our March 2008 report, we reviewed the additional assessment process changes EPA was planning and concluded that they would likely exacerbate delays in completing IRIS assessments and further affect their credibility. Specifically, despite the OMB/interagency review process that OMB required EPA to incorporate into the IRIS assessment process in 2005, certain federal agencies continued to believe they should have greater and more formal roles in EPA's development of IRIS assessments. Consequently, EPA had been working for several years to establish a formal IRIS assessment process that would further expand the role of federal agencies in the process--including agencies such as DOD, which could be affected by the outcome of IRIS assessments. For example, some of these agencies and their contractors could face increased cleanup costs and other legal liabilities if EPA issued an IRIS assessment for a chemical that resulted in a decision to regulate the chemical to protect the public. In addition, the agencies could be required to, for example, redesign systems and processes to eliminate hazardous materials; develop material substitutes; and improve personal protective clothing, equipment, and procedures. Under the changes that EPA was planning at the time of our review, these potentially affected agencies would have the opportunity to be involved, or provide some form of input, at almost every step of EPA's IRIS assessment process. Most significantly, the changes would have provided federal agencies, including those facing potential regulatory liability, with several opportunities during the IRIS assessment process to subject particular chemicals of interest to additional process steps. These additional process steps, which would have lengthened assessment times considerably, include: giving federal agencies and the public 45 days to identify additional information on a chemical for EPA's consideration in its assessment or to correct any errors on an additional assessment draft that would provide qualitative information;\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ This represents an additional review of a new draft product and comment period that had not existed previously. As shown in Appendix II, the assessment process EPA used at the time of our review included publishing its annual IRIS assessment agenda in the Federal Register and soliciting relevant scientific information from the public. giving potentially affected federal agencies 30 days to review the public comments EPA received and initiate a meeting with EPA if they want to discuss a particular set of --------------------------------------------------------------------------- comments; allowing potentially affected federal agencies to have assessments suspended for up to 18 months to fill a data gap or eliminate an uncertainty factor that EPA plans to use in its assessment; and allowing other federal agencies to weigh in on (1) the level of independent peer review that would be sought (that is, whether the peer reviews would be conducted by EPA Science Advisory Board panels, National Academies' panels, or panels organized by an EPA contractor); (2) the areas of scientific expertise needed on the panel; and (3) the scope of the peer reviews and the specific issues they would address. EPA estimated that assessments that undergo these additional process steps would take up to six years to complete. While it is important to ensure that assessments consider the best science, EPA has acknowledged that waiting for new data can result in substantial harm to human health, safety, and the environment. Further, although coordination with other federal agencies about IRIS assessments could enhance their quality,\\4\\ increasing the role of agencies that may be affected by IRIS assessments in the process itself reduces the credibility of the assessments if that expanded role is not transparent. In this regard, while EPA's proposed changes would have allowed for including federal agencies' comments in the public record, the implementation of this proposal was delayed for a year, in part, because of OMB's view that agencies' comments about IRIS assessments represent internal executive branch communications that may not be made public--a view that is inconsistent with the principle of sound science, which relies on, among other things, transparency. (Appendix II and III provide flow charts of the IRIS process that was in place at the time of our review and EPA's draft proposed process being considered at the time of our review, respectively). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ We recommended in our 2006 report on human health risk assessment that EPA consistently involve stakeholders as appropriate to the risk assessment. We made this recommendation in the context of improving the overall quality, consistency, and transparency of risk assessments. GAO, Human Health Risk Assessment: EPA Has Taken Steps to Strengthen Its Process, but Improvements Needed in Planning, Data Development, and Training, GAO-06-595 (Washington, D.C.: May 31, 2006). Recommendations Made in Our March 2008 Report To address the productivity and credibility issues we identified, we recommended that the EPA Administrator require the Office of Research and Development to re-evaluate its draft proposed changes to the IRIS assessment process in light of the issues raised in our report and ensure that any revised process, among other things, clearly defines and documents an IRIS assessment process that will enable the agency to develop the timely chemical risk information it needs to effectively conduct its mission. One of our recommendations--that EPA provide at least two years' notice of IRIS assessments that are planned--would, among other things, provide an efficient alternative to suspending assessments while waiting for new research because interested parties would have the opportunity to conduct research before assessments are started. In addition, we recommended that the EPA Administrator take steps to better ensure that EPA has the ability to develop transparent, credible IRIS assessments--an ability that relies in large part on EPA's independence in conducting these important assessments. Actions that are key to this ability include ensuring that EPA can (1) determine the types of assessments it needs to support EPA programs and (2) define the appropriate role of external federal agencies in EPA's IRIS assessment process, and (3) manage an interagency review process in a manner that enhances the quality, transparency, timeliness, and credibility of IRIS assessments. In its February 21, 2008, letter providing comments on our draft report, EPA said it would consider each of our recommendations in light of the new IRIS process the agency was developing. Key Aspects of the Revised IRIS Assessment Process Implemented in April 2008 Which Is Not Responsive to GAO's Recommendations On April 10, 2008, EPA issued a revised IRIS assessment process, effective immediately. Overall, EPA's revised process is not responsive to the recommendations made in our March 2008 report--it is largely the same as the draft proposed process we evaluated in our March 2008 report (see Appendix III and IV). Moreover, changes EPA did incorporate into the final process are likely to further exacerbate the productivity and credibility issues we identified in our report. We recommended that EPA ensure that, among other things, any revised process clearly defines and documents a streamlined IRIS assessment process that can be conducted within time frames that minimize the need for wasteful rework. As discussed in our report, when assessments take longer than two years, they can become subject to substantial delays stemming from the need to redo key analyses to take into account changing science and assessment methodologies. However, EPA's revised process institutionalizes a process that the agency estimates will take up to six years to complete. Further, the estimated time frames do not factor in the time for peer reviews conducted by the National Academies, which can take two years to plan and complete.\\5\\ EPA typically uses reviews by the National Academies for highly controversial chemicals or complex assessments. Therefore, assessments of key chemicals of concern to public health that are reviewed by the National Academies are likely to take at least eight years to complete. These time frames must also be considered in light of OMB's view that health assessment values in IRIS are out of date if they are more than 10 years old and if new scientific information exists that could change the health assessment values. Thus, EPA's new process institutionalizes time frames that could essentially require the agency to start assessment updates as soon as two years after assessments are finalized in order to keep the IRIS database current. Such time frames are not consistent with our recommendation that EPA develop, clearly define, and document a streamlined IRIS process that can be conducted within time frames that minimize the need for wasteful rework. Further, the agency would need a significant increase in resources to support such an assessment cycle. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ It is not clear whether the time frames exclude reviews conducted by EPA's Science Advisory Board, which can also add considerably more time than the most basic level of peer review used by the IRIS program--panels organized by an EPA contractor. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, EPA had previously emphasized that, in suspending assessments to allow agencies to fill in data gaps, it would allow no more than 18 months to complete the studies and have them peer reviewed. However, under the new process, EPA states that it generally will allow no more than 18 months to complete the studies and have them peer reviewed. As we concluded in our report, we believe the ability to suspend assessments for up to 18 months would add to the already unacceptable level of delays in completing IRIS assessments. Further, we and several agency officials with whom we spoke believe that the time needed to plan, conduct, and complete research that would address significant data gaps, and have it peer reviewed, would likely exceed 18 months. Therefore, the less rigid time frame EPA included in its new process could result in additional delays. Finally, the new process expands the scope of one of the additional steps that initially was to apply only to chemicals of particular interest to federal agencies.\\6\\ Specifically, under the draft process we reviewed, EPA would have provided an additional review and comment opportunity for federal agencies and the public for what EPA officials said would be a small group of chemicals. However, under EPA's new process, this additional step has been added to the assessment process for all chemicals and, therefore, will add time to the already lengthy assessments of all chemicals. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ The new IRIS assessment process refers to such chemicals as ``mission critical.'' The process defines a mission-critical chemical as one that ``is an integral component to the successful and safe conduct of an agency's mission in any or all phases of its operations.'' According to the process, ``impacts on the use of mission-critical chemicals include cessation or degradation of the conduct of the mission and/or unacceptable resource constraints.'' We also recommended that the EPA Administrator take steps to better ensure that EPA has the ability to develop transparent, credible IRIS assessments--an ability that relies in large part on EPA's --------------------------------------------------------------------------- independence in conducting these important assessments. Contrary to our recommendation, EPA has formalized a revised IRIS process that is selectively, rather than fully, transparent, limiting the credibility of the assessments. Specifically, while the draft process we reviewed provided that comments on IRIS assessments from OMB and other federal agencies would be part of the public record, under the recently implemented process, comments from federal agencies are expressly defined as ``deliberative'' and will not be included in the public record.\\7\\ Given the importance and sensitivity of IRIS assessments, we believe it is critical that input from all parties, particularly agencies that may be affected by the outcome of IRIS assessments, be publicly available. However, under EPA's new process, input from some IRIS assessment reviewers--representatives of federal agencies, including those facing potential regulatory liability, and private stakeholders associated with these agencies--will continue to receive less public scrutiny than comments from all others. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Making these comments public would have been a change from the OMB/interagency review process that has been in place since 2004. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In commenting on a draft of our March 2008 report, and in a recent congressional hearing, EPA's Assistant Administrator, Office of Research and Development, stated that the IRIS process is transparent because all final IRIS assessments must undergo public and external peer review. However, as we stated in our report, the presence of transparency at a later stage of IRIS assessment development does not explain or excuse its absence earlier. Under the new process, neither peer reviewers nor the public are privy to the changes EPA makes in response to the comments OMB and other federal agencies provide to EPA at several stages in the assessment process--changes to draft assessments or to the questions EPA poses to the peer review panels. Importantly, the first IRIS assessment draft that is released to peer reviewers and to the public includes the undisclosed input from federal agencies potentially subject to regulation and therefore with an interest in minimizing the impacts of IRIS assessments on their budgets and operations. In addition, EPA's revised process does not provide EPA with sufficient independence in developing IRIS assessments to ensure they are credible and transparent. We made several recommendations aimed at restoring EPA's independence. For example, we recommended that the EPA Administrator ensure that EPA has the ability to, among other things, define the appropriate role of external federal agencies in the IRIS assessment process and determine when interagency issues have been appropriately addressed. However, under the newly implemented IRIS assessment process, OMB continues to inform EPA when EPA has adequately addressed OMB's and interagency comments. This determination must be made both before EPA can provide draft assessments to external peer reviewers and to the public and before EPA can finalize and post assessments on the IRIS database. While EPA officials state that ultimately IRIS assessments reflect EPA decisions, the new process does not support this assertion given the clearances EPA needs to receive from OMB to move forward at key stages. In fact, we believe the new IRIS assessment process may elevate the goal of reaching interagency agreement above achieving IRIS program objectives. Further, as discussed above, because the negotiations over OMB/interagency comments are not disclosed, whether EPA is entirely responsible for the content of information on IRIS is open to question. In our report, we also emphasized the importance of ensuring that IRIS assessments be based solely on science issues and not policy concerns. However, under the new IRIS assessment process, EPA has further introduced policy considerations into the IRIS assessment process. That is, the newly implemented IRIS assessment process broadens EPA's characterization of IRIS assessments from ``the agency's scientific positions on human health effects that may result from exposure to environmental contaminants'' to ``the agency's science and science policy positions'' on such effects. EPA's new, broader characterization of IRIS raises concerns about the agency's stated intent to ensure that scientific assessments are appropriately based on the best available science and that they are not inappropriately impacted by policy issues and considerations. For example, in discussing science and science policy at a recent Senate hearing, EPA's Assistant Administrator of Research and Development described science policy considerations as including decisions about filling knowledge gaps (e.g., whether and to what extent to use default assumptions) and assessing weight-of-the-evidence approaches to make scientific inferences or assumptions. We believe that these are scientific decisions that should reflect the best judgment of EPA scientists who are evaluating the data, using the detailed risk assessment guidance the agency has developed for such purposes. We have concerns about the manner and extent to which other federal agencies, including those that may be affected by the outcome of assessments, are involved in these decisions as well as the lack of transparency of their input. As we highlighted earlier, under the National Academies' risk assessment and risk management paradigm, policy considerations are relevant in the risk management phase--which occurs after the risk assessment phase that encompasses IRIS assessments. The National Academies recently addressed this issue as follows: ``The committee believes that risk assessors and risk managers should talk with each other; that is, a `conceptual distinction' does not mean establishing a wall between risk assessors and risk managers. Indeed they should have constant interaction. However, the dialogue should not bias or otherwise color the risk assessment conducted, and the activities should remain distinct; that is, risk assessors should not be performing risk management activities.'' \\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ National Academies, Scientific Review of the Proposed Risk Assessment Bulletin from the Office of Management and Budget Committee to Review the OMB Risk Assessment Bulletin (2007). Concluding Observations The new IRIS assessment process that EPA implemented in April 2008 will not allow the agency to routinely and timely complete credible assessments. In fact, it will exacerbate the problems we identified in our March 2008 report and sought to address with our recommendations-- all of which were aimed at preserving the viability of this critical database, which is integral to EPA's mission of protecting the public and the environment from exposure to toxic chemicals. Specifically, under the new process, assessment time frames will be significantly lengthened, and the lack of transparency will further limit the credibility of the assessments because input from OMB and other agencies at all stages of the IRIS assessment process is now expressly defined as deliberative and therefore not subject to public disclosure. The position of the Assistant Administrator, Office of Research and Development, that the IRIS process is transparent because all final IRIS assessments must undergo public and external peer review is unconvincing. Transparency at a later stage of the IRIS assessment process--after OMB and other federal agencies have had multiple opportunities to influence the content of the assessment without any disclosure of their input--does not compensate for its absence earlier. We continue to believe that to effectively maintain IRIS EPA must streamline its lengthy assessment process and adopt transparency practices that provide assurance that IRIS assessments are appropriately based on the best available science and that they are not inappropriately biased by policy issues and considerations. As discussed in our April 29, 2008, testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, we believe that the Congress should consider requiring EPA to suspend implementation of its new IRIS assessment process and develop a streamlined process that is transparent and otherwise responsive to our recommendations aimed at improving the timeliness and credibility of IRIS assessments.\\9\\ For example, suspending assessments to obtain additional research is inefficient; alternatively, with longer-term planning, EPA could provide agencies and the public with more advance notice of assessments, enabling them to complete relevant research before IRIS assessments are started. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ GA0, Toxic Chemicals: EPA's New Assessment Process Will Increase Challenges EPA Faces in Evaluating and Regulating Chemicals, GAO-08-743T (Washington, D.C.: April 29, 2008). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, as discussed in our April 2008 testimony, the Congress should consider requiring EPA to obtain and be responsive to input from the Congress and the public before finalizing a revised IRIS assessment process. We note that while EPA and OMB initially had planned for EPA to release a draft revised IRIS assessment process to the public, hold a public meeting to discuss EPA's proposed changes, and seek and incorporate public input before finalizing the process, EPA released its new assessment process without obtaining public input and made it effective immediately. This was inconsistent with assertions made in OMB's letter commenting on our draft report, which emphasized that EPA had not completed the development of the IRIS assessment process and stated: ``Indeed, the process will not be complete until EPA circulates its draft to the public for comments and then releases a final product that is responsive to those comments.'' Finally, if EPA is not able to take the steps we have recommended to effectively maintain this critical program, other approaches, including statutory requirements, may need to be explored. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions that you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have at this time.

Appendix I: Examples of Key IRIS Assessments That Have Been Delayed Some key IRIS assessments have been in progress for a number of years, in part because of delays stemming from one or more of the key factors we identified that have hindered EPA's productivity.\\10\\ Examples include the following: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ The factors we identified that have hindered EPA's efforts to improve productivity are the OMB/interagency review process managed by OMB, the growing complexity and scope of risk assessments, certain management decisions and issues regarding the IRIS program, congressional action that has delayed some assessments with potentially significant economic effects, and the compounding effect of delays. Naphthalene. EPA started the IRIS assessment of cancer risks stemming from the inhalation of naphthalene in 2002. Naphthalene is used in jet fuel and in the production of widely used commercial products such as moth balls, dyes, insecticides, and plasticizers. According to a presentation delivered at the 2007 annual meeting of the Society for Risk Analysis by an Army Corps of Engineers toxicologist,\\11\\ ``The changing naphthalene regulatory environment includes a draft EPA risk assessment that if/when finalized, will change naphthalene's status from `possible' to `likely' human carcinogen.'' \\12\\ Thus, according to this presentation, one potential impact of this IRIS assessment on DOD is that DOD would need to provide many employees exposed to naphthalene with equipment measuring their exposure to the chemical. In addition, because many military bases are contaminated with naphthalene, a component of jet fuel (approximately one percent to three percent) used by all DOD services, DOD could face extensive cleanup costs. By 2004, two years after starting the assessment, EPA had drafted a chemical assessment that had completed internal peer reviews and was about to be sent to an external peer review committee. Once it returned from external review, the next step, at that time, would have been a formal review by EPA's IRIS Agency Review Committee. If approved, the assessment would have been completed and released. However, in part because of concerns raised by DOD, OMB asked to review the assessment and conducted an interagency review of the draft. In their 2004 reviews of the draft IRIS assessment, both OMB and DOD raised a number of concerns about the assessment and suggested to EPA that it be suspended until additional research could be completed to address what they considered to be significant uncertainties associated with the assessment. Although all of the issues raised by OMB and DOD were not resolved, EPA continued with its assessment by submitting the draft for external peer review, which was completed in September 2004.\\13\\ However, according to EPA, OMB continued to object to the draft IRIS assessment and directed EPA to convene an additional expert review panel on genotoxicity to obtain recommendations about short-term tests that OMB thought could be done quickly.\\14\\ According to EPA, this added six months to the process, and the panel, which met in April 2005, concluded that the research that OMB was proposing could not be conducted in the short-term. Nonetheless, EPA officials said that the second expert panel review did not eliminate OMB's concerns regarding the assessment, which they described as reaching a stalemate. In September 2006, EPA decided, however, to proceed with developing the assessment. By this time, the naphthalene assessment had been in progress for over four years; EPA decided that the IRIS non-cancer assessment, issued in 1998, was outdated and needed to be revisited. Thus, EPA expanded the IRIS naphthalene assessment to include both non- cancer and cancer assessments. As a result, six years after the naphthalene assessment began, it is now back at the drafting stage. The assessment now will need to reflect relevant research completed since the draft underwent initial external peer review in 2004, and it will have to undergo all of the IRIS assessment steps again, including additional internal and external reviews that are now required. This series of delays has limited EPA's ability to conduct its mission. For example, the Office of Air and Radiation has identified the naphthalene assessment as one of its highest-priority needs for its air toxics program. In addition, the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response considers the naphthalene assessment a high priority for the Superfund program--naphthalene has been found in at least 654 of Superfund's current or former National Priorities List sites.\\15\\ Although EPA currently estimates that it will complete the assessment in 2009, meeting this revised estimate will be challenging, given all of the steps that are yet to be completed and the extensive external scrutiny to which it will continue to be subjected. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Presentations at the Society for Risk Analysis meeting reflect the views of the authors and ``do not necessarily reflect the views of any other organization or agency.'' \\12\\ Using its 1996 Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, EPA concluded in the 1998 IRIS assessment of naphthalene that its human carcinogenic potential could not be determined at that time, but noted that there was suggestive evidence of potential human carcinogenicity. (EPA also noted that under its 1986 cancer guidelines, EPA classified naphthalene as a possible human carcinogen.) Subsequently, in 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, concluded that naphthalene is possibly carcinogenic to humans; in 2004, the Department of Human Health and Services' National Toxicology Program concluded that naphthalene can reasonably be anticipated to be a human carcinogen. EPA's current assessment will be subject to the agency's 2005 cancer guidelines. \\13\\ According to DOD, EPA did not specifically ask the peer reviewers to address some of the technical questions DOD had raised and wanted the peer review to address. \\14\\ Genotoxic substances are a type of carcinogen, specifically those capable of causing genetic mutation and of contributing to the development of tumors. This includes both certain chemical compounds and certain types of radiation. \\15\\ The National Priorities List is EPA's list of seriously contaminated sites. Royal Demolition Explosive. This chemical, also called RDX or hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitrotriazine, is a highly powerful explosive used by the U.S. military in thousands of munitions. Currently classified by EPA as a possible human carcinogen, this chemical is known to leach from soil to groundwater. Royal Demolition Explosive can cause seizures in humans and animals when large amounts are inhaled or ingested, but the effects of long-term, low-level exposure on the nervous system are unknown. As is the case with naphthalene, the IRIS assessment could potentially require DOD to undertake a number of actions, including steps to protect its employees from the effects of this chemical and to clean up many contaminated sites. Although EPA started an IRIS assessment of Royal Demolition Explosive in 2000, it has made minimal progress on the assessment because EPA agreed to a request by DOD to wait for the results of DOD-sponsored research on this chemical. In 2007, EPA began to actively work on this assessment, although some of --------------------------------------------------------------------------- the DOD-sponsored research is still outstanding. Formaldehyde. EPA began an IRIS assessment of formaldehyde in 1997 because the existing assessment was determined to be outdated.\\16\\ Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable, strong-smelling gas used to manufacture building materials, such as pressed wood products, and used in many household products, including paper, pharmaceuticals, and leather goods. While EPA currently classifies formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, classifies formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen. Since 1986, studies of industrial of workers have suggested that formaldehyde exposure is associated with nasopharyngeal cancer, and possibly with leukemia. For example, in 2003 and 2004, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) released epidemiological studies following up on earlier studies tracking about 26,000 and 11,000 industrial workers, respectively, exposed to formaldehyde; the updates showed exposure to formaldehyde might also cause leukemia in humans, in addition to the cancer types previously identified. According to NCI officials, the key findings in their follow-up study were an increase in leukemia deaths and, more significantly, an exposure/response relationship between formaldehyde and leukemia--as exposure increased, the incidence of leukemia also rose. As with the earlier study, NCI found more cases of a rare form of cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, than would usually be expected. The studies from NCI and NIOSH were published in 2003 and 2004,\\17\\ around the time that EPA was still drafting its IRIS assessment. In November 2004, the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee requested that EPA delay completion of its IRIS assessment until an update to the just-released NCI study could be conducted, indicating that the effort would take, at most, 18 months. EPA agreed to wait--and more than three years later, the NCI update is not yet complete. As of December 2007, NCI estimates that the study will be completed in two stages, one in mid-2008 and the second one later that year. An NCI official said that the additional leukemia deaths identified in the update provide ``greater power'' to detect associations between exposure to formaldehyde and cancer. EPA's inability to complete the IRIS assessment it started more than 10 years ago in a timely manner has had a significant impact on EPA's air toxics program. Specifically, when EPA promulgated a national emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants covering facilities in the plywood and composite wood industries in 2004, EPA's Office of Air and Radiation took the unusual step of not using the existing IRIS estimate but rather decided to use a cancer risk estimate developed by an industry-funded organization, the CIIT Centers for Health Research (formerly, the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology) that had been used by the Canadian health protection agency. The IRIS cancer risk factor had been subject to criticism because it was last revised in 1991 and was based on data from the 1980s. In its final rule, EPA stated that ``the dose-response value in IRIS is based on a 1987 study, and no longer represents the best available science in the peer-reviewed literature.'' The CIIT quantitative cancer risk estimate that EPA used in its health risk assessment in the plywood and composite wood national emissions standard indicates a potency about 2,400 times lower than the estimate in IRIS that was being re-evaluated and that did not yet consider the 2003 and 2004 NCI and NIOSH epidemiological studies. According to an EPA official, an IRIS cancer risk factor based on the 2003 and 2004 NCI and NIOSH studies would likely be close to the current IRIS assessment, which EPA has been attempting to update since 1997. The decision to use the CIIT assessment in the plywood national emissions standard was controversial, and officials in EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment said the center identified numerous problems with the CIIT estimate. Nonetheless, the Office of Air and Radiation used the CIIT value, and that decision was a factor in EPA exempting certain facilities with formaldehyde emissions from the national emissions standard. In June 2007, a federal appellate court struck down the rule, holding that EPA's decision to exempt certain facilities that EPA asserted presented a low health risk exceeded the agency's authority under the Clean Air Act.\\18\\ Further, the continued delays of the IRIS assessment of formaldehyde--currently estimated to be completed in 2010 but after almost 11 years still in the draft development stage--will impact the quality of other EPA regulatory actions, including other air toxics rules and requirements. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ The cancer portion of the formaldehyde assessment was originally issued in 1989 and updated in 1"
