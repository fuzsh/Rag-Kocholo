        "text": "The Penn State defensive back who authored one of the most iconic moments of the James Franklin era announced the end of his football career.\n\nFormer Nittany Lions cornerback Grant Haley, who most recently played for the Los Angeles Rams in 2022, has retired from the NFL, he wrote on social media Sunday night.\n\n\"I have been trying to find the words to express my decision to end a chapter of my life that has provided me with profound memories, the definition of sacrifice, dedication, and competition, but most importantly provided me with family for life,\" Haley wrote on Instagram. \"For over half my life, I gave everything I had to a dream that didn't happen by accident but happened because of the values my parents, coaches, and mentors instilled upon me. I could not have done this alone and I am thankful for the support of those who know me beyond the helmet.\n\n\"I bent but never broke through the adversity life threw at me and gained respect from those who wanted to see me fail. As I move forward with my journey through life, I am reminded that football was just a platform. A platform to be a mentor, servant, leader, and those are the things that ultimately define me as a person. I close this chapter grateful with an abundant amount of respect for the game of football. Forever grateful for the NY Giants/ NO Saints/ LA Rams for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. I hope that my journey gives others the belief that the only limits in life are those that we set for ourselves! All glory to God.\"\n\nHaley, 28, played 35 games over five seasons for the New York Giants, the New Orleans Saints and the Rams. He made 13 starts — with 12 of those coming for the Giants in 2018 and 2019 — and recorded 94 tackles (77 solo), seven tackles for loss, one sack, two quarterback hits, six pass breakups and one interception.\n\nHaley went undrafted out of Penn State in 2018, but he caught on with the Giants as a free agent and went on to start nine games as a rookie that fall.\n\nA high point of Haley's career came when he won Super Bowl LVI with the Rams after the 2021 season. In the 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, Haley played 22 special teams snaps to help his team win the Lombardi Trophy. Haley was a core special teams contributor for the Rams during the back half of the 2021 season and during the playoff run.\n\nHaley earned his Super Bowl ring alongside another former Nittany Lion, safety Nick Scott.\n\nHaley last appeared in an NFL game for the Rams on Oct. 16, 2022. He was placed on injured reserve after that game, and he elected free agency in March 2023.\n\nSALE: 60% Off Annual Lions247 VIP; or Monthly W/ Fantastic Perk\n\nDuring his Penn State career, Haley is most known for creating one of the most critical moments of Franklin's tenure when he returned Marcus Allen's blocked field goal for a touchdown in the 24-21 upset win over Ohio State during the 2016 season. Haley's 60-yard touchdown return, which put the Nittany Lions ahead of the Buckeyes for good, helped complete a comeback and spur Penn State's Big Ten championship run.\n\nIt was the first time a Penn State player had ever returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown.\n\nHaley finished his Penn State career with 139 tackles (89 solo), 6.5 tackles for loss, two sacks, five interceptions, one defensive touchdown, 23 pass breakups, one fumble recovery, one forced fumble and one fumble return touchdown. Haley was a two-time All-Big Ten honorable mention selection for his play.\n\nHaley was a member of Penn State's Class of 2014 — Franklin's first after he was hired — and signed with the Nittany Lions as a three-star prospect out of Atlanta (Ga.) Lovett School. He was ranked as the No. 35 cornerback in the country and the No. 43 player in Georgia.\n\nRead more: Scheme versatility, trust in new offense keyed WR Koby Howard's Penn State commitment"
