        "text": "Philadelphia Imhotep linebacker Charles Belser made multiple visits to Penn State prior to Friday's trip for the Lasch Bash and his comfort level is already high with the program.\n\nWith several former Imhotep players on Penn State's roster and a connection with Philadelphia native and assistant coach Deion Barnes, there are plenty of things the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Belser likes about the Nittany Lions.\n\n\"I like everything,\" he said. \"It's the stadium, the facilities, the coaches, the culture. I feel like everything up there is really good.\""
