        "text": "In this paper we investigate possible links between historical linguistics and cognitive science, or theory of the mind. Our primary goal is to demonstrate that historically documented processes of a certain type, i.e. those relating to semantic change and grammaticalization, form a unified theoretical bundle which gives insight into the cognitive processes at work in language organization and evolution. We reject the notion that historical phenomena are excluded from cognitive speculation on the grounds that they are untestable. Rather, we argue for an extension of Labov's uniformitarian doctrine, which states \" that the same mechanisms which operated to produce the large-scale changes of the past may be observed operating in the current changes taking place around us. \" (Labov, 1972:161). This principle is transferable to the current context in the following way: first, language as a system is no different today than it was millennia ago, easily as far back as diachronic speculation is likely to take us; and second, the human brain is structurally no different today from the brain of humans of up to ten thousand years ago. The cognitive-linguistic parallelism between the past and the present makes speculation possible, in this case about code-switching, even if it is not testable in the laboratory. It further allows us to make forward and backward inferences about both language change and its cognitive underpinnings. In this paper we hope to establish the parallelism between cognitive science and historical linguistics.We begin with a brief survey of the domain of historical linguistics, with illustrative examples. The purpose of this survey is to provide an outline of the usual concerns of the historical linguist, whose concentration typically falls far from that of the cognitive scientist. This intellectual distance accounts for the general absence of meaningful dialogue between language historians and cognitive scientists. We do not seek exhaustiveness in this review, either of topic areas or of bibliographical coverage. In the interest of space, our presentation has a rather telescopic character. The study of language change affords us a systematic view of the history of a language or language family, its speakers, and their cultural practices. All languages are in a constant state of change, some more accelerated than others. For example, change is rapid in a widely spread language like English, with more than a billion first-and second-language users. English has even developed a number of named varieties such as Nigerian English, Australian English, Indian English and so on since the period of\n\nThis text intends to systematize the studies in the history of the concepts of meaning in order to understand the evolution of this linguistic topic, over the last decades, within the framework of cognitive linguistics. The meaning of words, sentences and texts is the object of study of semantics, a discipline of linguistics that focuses on the meaning of linguistic expressions, as well as on the relations of meaning that these expressions celebrate among each other and with the world. The semantic properties of natural languages can be studied at all linguistic levels. As a consequence of the growing awareness of the pragmatic dimension of language and of the dissolution of traditional oppositions among syntax, semantics and lexicon in linguistics, we realize that, in the second half of the twentieth century, there was a theoretical and methodological renewal and the creation of new disciplinary areas. In the 1980s, a link was established among linguistics, computer science and cognitive psychology. In this text, we highlight the contribution of all these areas to the concept of “meaning”, especially that of cognitive grammar, which identifies and represents the conceptual structures that are conventionalized in grammatical constructions, transferring our conceptual perception of the world to meaning."
