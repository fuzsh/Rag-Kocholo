        "text": "On a clear and sunny afternoon [at Osan Air Base, a United States Air Force base located near Songtan Station in the city of Pyeongtaek, South Korea, 64 km south of Seoul], eight A-10 Thunderbolt II’s and two F-16 Fighting Falcons were cleared for takeoff to conduct close air support (CAS) training. During the training sortie, the team deciphered the tactical difficulty of having multiple formations in the Area of Operation (AO) by integrating multiple airframes to strike targets passed by a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC).\n\nThis kind of training isn’t unique to the 25th or 36th Fighter Squadron but today each of these aircraft was piloted by a woman.\n\nIt’s rare for a squadron to launch a formation of pilots who all happen to be female. Not only were there women flying the A-10s and F-16s, but an all-female weather team briefed the pilots prior to stepping to the aircraft. Female Air Force personnel planned and executed the entire process from radio communication inside the air traffic control tower to the crew chief marshalling the aircraft on the ground. The team effort showcased the ability that women have to lead in every facet from planning to mission execution.\n\nOn 28 April, 1993, when former U.S. Secretary of Defence Les Aspin ordered military services to allow women to fly in combat, there was no timetable of how soon the world would see the percentages of female fighter pilots increase.\n\nToday, almost 30 years later, there are only 103 female fighter pilots across the U.S. Air Force 11F career field. Ten percent of those fighter pilots flew jointly in a momentous all-female formation sortie at the 51st Fighter Wing.\n\n“In my 15 years of flying the F-16, I’ve been a part of 10 different fighter squadrons, and I’ve had a total of six other women pilots in all those squadrons,” said Lt. Col. Katie “Taboo” Gaetke, 7th Air Force, Chief of Plans and Policy. “I have never been in a squadron with more than one other woman pilot. To have eight women in one fighter squadron is unreal!”\n\nGaetke continued, “When you are the only woman (or any minority), or one of just two or three, there is an implicit burden you carry – to represent all women. Whether you realise it or not, people remember your actions and tend to generalise what you do or say as representative of all people who look like you. When there are eight women in a single fighter squadron, there are suddenly too many to have just one represent the group. Each person is freer to be themselves, to contribute their unique perspective, to take risks and innovate and make mistakes without worrying that they are fulfilling other people’s negative stereotypes about them. This is when we as an Air Force can truly gain from diverse perspectives: when diversity isn’t just an anomaly, but instead there is a critical mass.”\n\nHistory tells us that female aviators have been capable pilots since the days of WWII and the WASPs, however within the last decade the numbers have swelled to a now noticeable contingent. Someday there will be no novelty in a larger aircrew of female pilots. This sortie is another step in achieving that eventuality.\n\n“When I was in grade school I met a female F-22 Raptor pilot who was stationed in my home town of Anchorage, Alaska,” said Grace “Slap” Herrman, A-10 Thunderbolt II pilot. “She told me she went to the Air Force Academy where she flew gliders and was eventually picked up to be a USAF pilot. At that exact moment I realized that being a fighter pilot was entirely possible for a girl, and I was going to be a fighter pilot. I know this interaction was probably something that seemed so small for Elizabeth, but it was absolutely life changing for me.”\n\nThe aircrew included a wide range of experiences from a Lieutenant on her first sortie in the Operations Squadron to Lieutenant Colonels with years of invaluable operational experiences. The launch showcased how much women operating in aviation have increased in the past few years.\n\nWith just 10 women, the team spanned qualifications from one of the most qualified pilots in the A-10 Thunderbolt II and F-16 Fighting Falcon squadrons to one of the newest.\n\nUpon landing, leaders from 7th Air Force, 51st Fighter Wing, family, teammates and Girl Scouts troops joined a final flight celebration for Capt. Erin Fullam, F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot. Her devotion to aviation and excellence has been instrumental in the development of mission success at Team Osan.\n\nThe Girls Scout troops in attendance scanned the flight line full of aircrew in amazement as the pilots hugged their families and recapped the memorable details of the mission. The moment, both significant in U.S. Air Force aviation history was noticeably striking to the young girls.\n\n“The significance of today’s flight is not for us, the pilots,” said Capt. Grace “Slap” Herman. “It is for the young girl who has never seen a female fighter pilot, let alone 10 of them. We fly for her so she knows nothing is out of her reach and she need only believe to one day be a future fighter pilot.”\n\nLINDA FAGAN TO BE U.S. COAST GUARD’S FIRST FEMALE 4-STAR\n\nAdmiral Skoog Haslum was previously a commander of Sweden's 4th Naval Warfare Flotilla, the navy's rapid-response unit, and was, until her new assignment, vice-chancellor of the Swedish National Defence College.\n\nBorn on 26 March 1968 in Hov Parish, Kristianstad County, Sweden, she began her career in 1987 as a radio telegraphist on board HSwMS Stockholm. She was commissioned as a naval officer in the 2nd Surface Warfare Flotilla in 1990 with the rank of acting sub-lieutenant. She was promoted to sub-lieutenant in 1993 and to lieutenant in 1995.\n\nShe spent a semester of 2007 as commander of the HSwMS Sundsvall corvette in the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force (MTF) patrolling the coast of Lebanon on anti-terrorist missions.\n\nFor a month every year from 2010 to 2017, Admiral Skoog Haslum served as Aide-de-camp to Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden.\n\nShe started at the Swedish Defence University on 1 December 2016 and became the new vice-chancellor of the university in early 2017. As such she was the University’s highest military representative, playing an important role in its development and responsible for collaboration with foreign defence colleges. The vice-chancellor also acts as exercise leader in major exercises. On 11 December 2019, she was appointed Chief of Navy.\n\nThe Admiral is married and has two sons.\n\nIn an interview with Newsweek in November 2015, Skoog Haslum is described as “a tough commander who dismisses notions of female solidarity.” The article says that she told the Swedish daily, Svenska Dagbladet, that she \"doesn't have a need for female companionship\", neither on the ship nor in civilian life, adding that she is \"not interested in the female networks [in the armed forces].''\n\nRetired navy captain Göran Frisk, Sweden's top submarine hunter during the final decade of the Cold War, is quoted in the article as saying: “Ewa is robust, stable and knows what she wants. She's a knowledgeable and versatile naval officer, and was an excellent ship commander. She's also very compassionate towards her crew and subordinate officer, and is a good leader at sea.\"\n\nWOMEN AND MOTHERHOOD IN THE ARMED FORCES\n\n28 Jan., 2020 — Last week a Lt. Commander from the Royal Navy, Carrie, and a Lt. Colonel from the French Air Force, Caroline (an unwitting coincidence in first names!) were the speakers at a seminar organised in the framework of the British Council in Paris' “Women in Perspective” series.\n\nThe seminar was supposed to centre on what women have brought to the armed forces, but it could have been re-named “motherhood and the armed forces”!\n\nBoth women talked about the difficulties not only of recruiting women, but then of keeping them, although Carrie pointed out that the Royal Navy, where 10% of the personnel are female (14% for the French Navy), is now “actively recruiting anyone.” She pointed out that in 2018 “we were losing less women in the navy than we were men.”\n\nCaroline was still a little indignant when she recalled how she used to “get questions when I was younger about whether I was planning to have babies.” But, she stressed, “going on maternity leave is just like being away on a mission: you're away from your desk for a certain number of weeks, your workmates deal with it, and then you come back.” She said nobody questioned the necessity to re-arrange work when a colleague was away on a mission, so why should being away on maternity leave be any different? “I was still reachable by phone and e-mail because it was important for me to keep the link,” she said.\n\nBoth women are married and have children. Carrie's husband, who used to be in the navy, resigned “because he thought it was better for the family.” We all laughed sympathetically when she said that one of the hardest things for a woman to learn is to “let go” when the father is the stay-at-home parent and to accept that his way of doing things might not be yours (“he'll buy a birthday cake whereas I would have made it”!). “It's hard to admit that Daddy knows best!” she smiled.\n\nCaroline's husband is still in the military. She cheerfully admits that she “wouldn't have had the same career without my husband.” He is a non-commissioned officer so “has more responsibilities for child-rearing.” Whilst she is attending War College in Paris, “he's entirely responsible” for the children down at their home in the south-west of France.\n\nThere was a bit of discussion about what the armed forces provides for parents but both British and French women, both speakers and audience, agreed that it was a real shame that much of the discussion on women in the armed forces centres on their role as mothers. And as one woman in the audience put it “there are quite a few women in the armed forces who are not mothers and we need to pay attention to them too.”\n\nUnfortunately the seminar was poorly advertised and clashed with Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly's “New Year good wishes to the armed forces” ceremony so attendance at the seminar was, how shall I put it, a little thin on the ground.\n\nBut the advantage of having few people present was that it allowed for a real exchange between speakers and the audience. People feel less shy when they can engage in eye contact with everyone in the room!\n\nFIRST FEMALE DEFENCE MINISTER FOR U.K.\n\n2 May, 2019 — Penny Mordaunt, 46, today became the U.K.'s first female defence secretary and the 10th European female defence minister. She was appointed after Gavin Williamson was sacked by Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nMordaunt had already been considered a front runner for the post in 2017 when Michael Fallon had to leave, but Williamson got the job instead. Mordaunt, a staunch pro-Brexiter, was previously international development secretary and has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Portsmouth North since 2010.\n\nShe is a navy reservist (and revealed in her maiden speech to Parliament in June 2010 that she had been named Penelope by her paratrooper father and special-needs-teacher mother in honour of the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Penelope.) “I point out to my critics that HMS Penelope latterly became known as HMS Pepperpot because of her ability to endure massive amounts of shelling and reamin afloat and able to return fire,” she added.\n\nMordaunt served as an armed forces minister under David Cameron. Somewhat confusingly there are several ministers in the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence. The Secretary of State for defence is the overall defence minister: that's the job that Mordaunt has just been given. Then there is the Minister of State for Defence (Earl Howe) who is not only the department spokesman in the House of Lords but has wide responsibilities ranging from relations with the EU to arms control. Then there is the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (currently Mark Lancaster) who is responsible for operations, recruitment and cyber amongst a host of other things. Then there is the Parliamentaery Under-Secretary of State for Defence People and Veterans (currently Tobias Ellwood) who is responsible for veterans, armed forces pay and pensions, welfare and service families etc. Finally there is the Minister for Defence Procurement (currently Stuart Andrew), whose job, for once, is self-explanatory!\n\nMordaunt studied philosophy at Reading University.\n\nShe joins an increasingly long list of female European defence ministers:\n\nDr Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, Germany's first female defence minister has been in her job since 15 December 2013. Incidentally, she has 7 children!\n\nMarina Pendeš has served as Bosnia and Herzegovina's defence minister since 31 March 2015.\n\nRadmila Šekerinska in North Macedonia, was appointed to her job on 1 June 2017.\n\nFlorence Parly in France has held her post since 21 June 2017.\n\nOlga Xhaçka in Albania has held her post since 11 September 2017\n\nAnna “Ank”Bijleveld in the Netherlands has held her post since 26 October 2017.\n\nElisabetta Trenta in Italy has been Defence Minister since 1 June 2018.\n\nMargarita Robles in Spain was appointed on 7 June 2018.\n\nVila Amherd has been Switzerland's Defence minister since 1 January 2019\n\nFRANCE APPOINTS SECOND EVER FEMALE MAJOR-GENERAL\n\n27 March, 2019 — Christine Chaulieu, who is portrayed on Wombat-womenincombat, will become France’s second female army major-general on 13 August 2019, 28 years after the first woman gained her three stars. That was Louise Coppolani on 1 August 1991.\n\nFRANCE’S PLAN FOR GENDER EQUALITY\n\n7 March, 2019 — “Heroism has no sex and talent has no gender. It should be neither an advantage, nor a handicap to be a woman.” So French Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, Geneviève Darrieussecq, smartly summed up the aims of the gender equality plan, known in French as “plan mixité”, revealed today just prior to International Women's Day.\n\n“Nobody thinks it's easy for a woman to have a career in the armed forces,” said Florence Parly, Armed Forces Minister, at the press conference where she presented the plan together with Darrieussecq. “But gender equality is everybody's business so we must act together, be pragmatic and find the means, the tools to help women.” There were three objectives to her plan, she said. Firstly, to make young women want to sign-up. Secondly, to ensure that those who do, then stay. “We have a quicker, more significant rate of evaporation amongst women than men. So we must introduce some flexibility in our rules because it's up to us to adapt,” Parly remarked. And thirdly, to address the misgivings that potential female candidates may have by enhancing the image of women already in the armed forceThe plan, with its 22 concrete measures, is the result of eight months of work. The measures will benefit all ranks, men and women, and is coherent with their military status ,the operational objectives of the armed forces, and avoids positive discrimination or reintroducing quotas (banned in 1998).\n\nThe French armed forces are the fourth most feminised in the world (after Israel, Hungary and the United States) with 32,012 serving personnel representing 15.5% of the total. But just 6.7% of French generals are women. The Air Force has the highest number of women (22.5%), followed by the Navy (14%) and the Army (10%). But as Vice Admiral Stanislas de la Motte, Major general of the Navy, pointed out: “Of the 5,400 women in the navy, only 25% serve on ships even though 68 of our vessels now have a mixed crew.” And, he added, “there is a very net deficit in the numbers of women after 12 years of service because they find it difficult to conciliate their personal lives with their professional ones.” He said that by 2030 the Navy aimed to have 21% female personnel.\n\nAir Marshal Alain Ferran, Human Resources director for the Air Force said that “the position of women is being asserted every year” and that in 2019 three air bases would be commanded by women, including the major air base 106 at Bordeaux-Mérignac.\n\nArmy Chief of Staff General Jean-Pierre Bosser said he thought the increasing role played by high technology would open up more roles for women in the army but stressed that the army had a “deliberate, if measured, strategy for recruiting more women but not at the cost of jeopardising our operational finality.”\n\nEvery unit in every force is open to women, including submarines and the Foreign Legion. But as Bosser smiled: “we have no women in the Foreign Legion because none apply!” There has actually been one woman Foreign Legionnaire to date: Susan Travers (1909-2003), a British citizen, who distinguished herself in battle during the Second World War, notably in Africa. One of the unresolved discussions, held with the armies' health service and the national defence sports centre (CNSD), has been about the physical aptitude tests. “The assault course was designed when there were only men and so the height of the walls, for example, don't take account of smaller women, or even smaller men. Boys think that the sports tests should be the same for everyone but that's not the case in professional sports,” remarked Bosser.\n\nEven if France ranks 4thfor the feminisation of its armed forces, the proportion of women has been stagnating since 2008 and there are few female officers who reach the highest echelons as they tend to leave the army eight years earlier than their male colleagues. “The entrance exams for the War College, which is mandatory for any senior officer, is aimed at personnel of a certain age. And that tends to coincide with the period at which many young women want to start a family. So, de facto, it excludes them,” Parly said.\n\nAmongst the 22 measures, six stand out:\n\nTo stop recruiting only those with a science background to become officers.\n\nTo ensure a better life/work balance and thus stop women from leaving altogether or turning to administrative and support jobs.\n\nTo havevoluntary and experienced mentors to help with career management for all thosewho would like one.\n\nTo ease the conditions for registering forexams, notably those to get intothe War College; allowing five years between the written and oral exams so that parental leave can be taken; taking account of experience outside the military (such as an MBA).\n\nTo introduce “gender equality” officers in every base and regiment\n\nTo have more women in senior ranks by ensuring that 10% at least of the 150-200 officers who get into the War College every year are women. The objective is that by 2022 10% of generals will be female and by 2025 that number is doubled. But as Parly said “it takes 30 years to make a general so it will take time to improve on these numbers.”\n\nOther, practical measures will be introduced to make day-to-day work easier, such as not scheduling meetings before 9 a.m. or after 6 p.m.; not organising seminars in the first two weeks of September just after school has started; and so on.\n\nYou can download the detailed list of measures (in French) here:\n\nhttps://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/le-plan-mixite-du-ministere-des-armees-y-aller-y-rester-y-evoluer"
