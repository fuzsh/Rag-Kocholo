        "text": "It says WIP dont know why you didnt listen\n\nProvisional Reichswehr Ranks\n\nRanks of military personnel of the Provisional Reichswehr as well as uniform of single design were instituted by the Decree Dress and Equipment of Provisional Reichswehr of May 05, 1919.\n\nI. Officer personnel\n\nOfficer ranks introduced on January 19, 1919 by the Temporary Provisions for Uniforms of the Peacetime Army remained unchanged.\n\n- General der Infanterie, General der Kavallerie, General der Artillerie;\n\n- Generalleutnant;\n\n- Generalmajor;\n\n- Oberst;\n\n- Oberstleutnant;\n\n- Major;\n\n- Hauptmann;\n\n- Oberleutnant;\n\n- Leutnant;\n\n- Feldwebelleutnant.\n\nNote:\n\nа) Ranks of medical and veterinary officers were not regulated by the new Decree.\n\nb) The new Decree as well as the previous one from the three months prescription had no mention of Rittmeister, the traditional Cavalry rank.\n\nc) Those with the rank of Feldwebelleutnant who decided to remain with the Provisional Reichswehr, were offered to undergo an additional officer training to be promoted to the rank of Leutnant. According to the Decree of April 28, 1920, those who made up their mind to quit the military service were sent in resignation but were given ranks of Leutnant der Landwehr (a.D.). Hence, that decision eliminated once and for all quite unpopular rank of Feldwebelleutnant.\n\nII. NCOs\n\nNCO ranks were divided into five categories depending on their specialization.\n\n1. Obermusikmeister, Musikmeister, Unterarzt, Unterveterinär, Offizierstellvertreter.\n\n2. Feldwebel, Wachtmeister, Oberfeuerwerker, Zeugfeldwebel, Festungsbaufeldwebel, Oberwallmeister, Wallmeister, Oberschirrmeister, Schirrmeister.\n\n3. Vizefeldwebel, Vizewachtmeister, Waffenmeister.\n\n4. Sergeant, Fähnrich, Waffenmeister.\n\n5. Unteroffizier.\n\nNote:\n\nа) Oberwallmeister and Wallmeister, Oberschirrmeister and Schirrmeister wore the same insignia but had different money allowances, the former being paid more.\n\nb) Inclusion of the rank Waffenmeister to both 3rd and 4th categories was intentional. Thus, according to the Decree of December 03, 1919, such NCOs might wear badges of rank either of Vizefeldwebel (Vizewachtmeister) or Sergeant, depending on the service period in every particular case. Insignia of the former was granted for those with at least 9 years of service, while that of the latter for those with at least 5,5 years of service.\n\nThe system of NCO ranks was revised by the end of 1919. In particular, ranks of Vizefeldwebel and Sergeant, as legacy of the Imperial past, were abolished; firm differentiation between military ranks and military specializations was finally made. Therefore, afore-mentioned ranks of the 1st and 2nd categories were designated Oberfeldwebel or Oberwachtmeister; ranks of the 3rd category  Feldwebel or Wachtmeister, ranks of the 4th category  Unterfeldwebel or Unterwachtmeister. The rank of Unteroffizier remained unchanged.\n\nAs a result, by the end of 1919 complete list of NCO ranks was as follows:\n\n- Oberfeldwebel or Oberwachtmeister;\n\n- Feldwebel or Wachtmeister;\n\n- Unterfeldwebel or Unterwachtmeister;\n\n- Unteroffizier.\n\nNote:\n\nа) Ranks of Oberwachtmeister, Wachtmeister and Unterwachtmeister corresponded to Oberfeldwebel, Feldwebel and Unterfeldwebel but related to NCOs in cavalry, mounted artillery and transport units as well as motorized units of mounted troops.\n\nb) According to the Decree of November 01, 1919, NCOs from signal troops were reckoned in the category stipulated above and their corresponding ranks were redesignated Oberwachtmeister, Wachtmeister and Unterwachtmeister.\n\nThe Brieftaubenmeister specialization was added to the category of Feldwebel in April 1920.\n\nIII. Other ranks\n\n- Obergefreiter;\n\n- Gefreiter;\n\n- Wehrmann. It was a collective term for all the lowest ranks (plural: Wehrleute), without differentiation of their specialization.\n\nThe Decree of October 23, 1919 introduced special designations of the lowest ranks according to their branch of service. In point of fact, that decision marked a restitution of the abandoned Imperial system.\n\n- Infantry: Grenadier, Füsilier (since November 15, 1919).\n\n- Jäger battalions, or Light infantry: Jäger.\n\n- Rifles regiments, machine gun units of Infantry and Cavalry regiments: Schütze.\n\n- Cavalry: Reiter.\n\n- Artillery and mortar units: Kanonier, Fahrer.\n\n- Pioneers: Pionier.\n\n- Motorized units: Fahrer.\n\n- Sanitary companies: Sanitätssoldat.\n\n- Signal troops: Funker, the rank being introduced a bit earlier, by the Decree of September 22, 1919.\n\nNote:\n\nа) The rank Füsilier was introduced by the Decree of November 15, 1919 for the personnel of infantry regiments that were brought up to strength primarily from the cadre of the former Füsilier regiments of the former Imperial Army. Therefore, since then two ranks, Grenadier and Füsilier stood for designation of an infantry soldier.\n\nb) The rank Funker for the lowest ranks of Signal troops was in fact introduced a bit earlier, in accordance with the Decree of September 22, 1919.\n\nRank Insignia of the Provisional Reichswehr\n\nThe Decree of creation of the Provisional Reichswehr being enacted on March 06, 1919 with coming into effect a week later, while new ranks and uniform being introduced on May 05, 1919 only, the usage of rank insignia of the Peacetime Army was continued within two spring months of 1919. (ССЫЛКА)\n\nRank Insignia of the Provisional Reichswehr consisted of stripes or chevrons and shoulder cords.\n\nI. Stripes and chevrons (Rangabzeichen)\n\nStripes and chevrons were manufactured of 10 mm wide striped braid similar to that of the Imperial NCO braid made of field-grey cotton and silver-plated metal threads. Rank insignia had to be worn on both sleeves of field tunics and overcoats.\n\n1. Other ranks\n\n- Wehrmann, and since October 23, 1919 the lowest ranks according to their branch of service had no stripes or chevrons.\n\n- Gefreiter wore one horizontal rectangular stripe measuring 10x60 mm on each upper arm..\n\n- Obergefreiter had the same stripes and additionally carried NCOs tassel.\n\nContrary to regulations, some Gefreite continued wearing of Imperial buttons at both sides of the collar, thus demonstrating their allegiance to old military traditions.\n\nDrill tunics (Drillichrock) were worn with the same stripes on each upper arm, but that insignia was made of 70 mm wide braid, previously worn by Gefreite of the Imperial Army during drills. That braid was manufactured of white wool with a thin central stripe in the corresponding state color, black for Prussia, blue for Bavaria, green for Saxony, red for Hesse and red with black stripes for Wurttemberg.\n\n2. NCOs\n\nAll NCOs of the Provisional Reichswehr wore chevrons on each upper arm of their field tunics and overcoats.\n\nInsignia had a shape of a letter V pointing downwards, each arm measuring 90 mm and a distance between its arms measuring 110 mm. Its worth mentioning here that the Order of May 05, 1919 erroneously described the lower angle of chevron as measuring 45 degrees. That mistake was corrected in the Order of June 06, 1919 that stipulated the angle to be close to 90 degrees. The distance between the upper part of chevron and the sleeve seam was 105 mm, while that between its edge and the lower part of the oval sleeve badge  35 mm approximately.\n\nThough chevrons were to be worn on both sleeves, due to shortage of available insignia some NCOs preferred to sew on only one on the left sleeve. The lack of regulation chevrons was overcame with the Decree of July 12, 1919 that authorized usage of the Imperial matt silver braid still available at depots.\n\n- Unteroffizier: one chevron on each upper arm. They also carried NCOs tassel.\n\n- Sergeant, Fähnrich, since December 03, 1919 and Waffenmeister with 5,5 years of service: two chevrons 1 cm apart. They also carried NCOs tassel.\n\n- Vizefeldwebel, Vizewachtmeister and Waffenmeister with 9 years of service, since December 03, 1919: three chevrons joined together. These NCOs carried officers tassel.\n\n- Feldwebel, Wachtmeister, Oberfeuerwerker, Zeugfeldwebel, Festungsbaufeldwebel, Oberwallmeister, Wallmeister, Oberschirrmeister, Schirrmeister: three chevrons joined together with one additional chevron 1 cm above. These NCOs also carried officers tassel.\n\n- Obermusikmeister, Musikmeister, Unterarzt, Unterveterinär, Offizierstellvertreter: three chevrons joined together with a 3 cm loop at the edge of the lowest one plus additional chevron 1 cm above. These NCOs also carried officers tassel. According to the Decree of December 09, 1919, Offizierstellvertreter still on active military service on September 30, 1919 but willing to retire soon, were allowed to continue wearing their former insignia.\n\nDrill tunics (Drillichrock) were worn with the same stripes on each upper arm, but that insignia was made of 70 mm wide braid, previously worn by Gefreite of the Imperial Army during drills. That braid was manufactured of white wool with a thin central stripe in the corresponding state color, black for Prussia, blue for Bavaria, green for Saxony, red for Hesse and red with black stripes for Wurttemberg.\n\n3. Officers\n\nOfficers wore stripes sewn on around sleeves of their tunics and overcoats 1 cm above cuffs.\n\n- Leutnant, Feldwebelleutnant: one stripe with a central 3 cm loop pointing upwards.\n\n- Oberleutnant: one stripe with a central 3 cm loop pointing upwards plus one additional stripe without loop 1 cm below.\n\n- Hauptmann: one stripe with a central 3 cm loop pointing upwards plus two additional stripes without loop 1 cm below and 1 cm apart.\n\n- Major: three chevrons (totally different from those for NCOs) with slight edges pointing upwards joined together.\n\n- Oberstleutnant: three chevrons with slight edges pointing upwards joined together plus additional chevron 1 cm above.\n\n- Oberst: three chevrons with slight edges pointing upwards joined together plus two additional chevrons 1 cm above and 1 cm apart.\n\n- Generalmajor: five chevrons with slight edges pointing upwards joined together.\n\n- Generalleutnant: five chevrons with slight edges pointing upwards joined together plus additional chevron 1 cm above.\n\n- General der Infanterie, General der Kavallerie, General der Artillerie: five chevrons with slight edges pointing upwards joined together plus two additional chevrons 1 cm above and 1 cm apart.\n\n1  Wehrmann (since October 23, 1919  lowest ranks according to their branch of service).\n\n2  Gefreiter and Obergefreiter.\n\n3  Unteroffizier.\n\n4  Sergeant, Fähnrich, Waffenmeister with 5,5 years of service (since December 03, 1919).\n\n5  Vizefeldwebel, Vizewachtmeister, Waffenmeister with 9 years of service (since December 03, 1919).\n\n6  Feldwebel, Wachtmeister, Oberfeuerwerker, Zeugfeldwebel, Festungsbaufeldwebel, Oberwallmeister, Wallmeister, Oberschirrmeister, Schirrmeister.\n\n7  Offizierstellvertreter, Obermusikmeister, Musikmeister, Unterarzt, Unterveterinär.\n\n8  Leutnant, Feldwebelleutnant.\n\n9  Oberleutnant.\n\n10  Hauptmann.\n\n11  Major.\n\n12  Oberstleutnant.\n\n13  Oberst.\n\n14  Generalmajor.\n\n15  Generalleutnant.\n\n16  General der Infanterie, General der Kavallerie, General der Artillerie.\n\nII. Shoulder Cords (Schulterschnurre)\n\nShoulder cords to be worn on both shoulders of field tunic and overcoat were instituted by the Decree of June 03, 1919. In fact this insignia was introduced after the Austrian pattern and designated belonging of the serviceman to other ranks, NCOs, officers or generals only, but not the actual rank. Schulterschnurre were made of a folded soutache cord with a diameter of 4-4,5 mm. Its upper part diverged thus forming a loop with a diameter of 13,5 mm for the shoulder button. The length of shoulder cords was individual for every soldier.\n\nTwo decorative slides measuring 6-7х12-13 mm and made of a narrow braided cord of the same color as the shoulder cords were fixed across 3-4 cm apart.\n\nSchulterschnurre were sewn into the sleeve seam at their bottom and were held at their upper part by a 19 mm shoulder button sewn to the tunic next to the collar. The button was in silver color except for the generals that were identified by matt white ones.\n\n1. Other ranks wore field-grey shoulder cords with a diameter of 4,5 mm. They were manufactured of wool or linen threads wrapped around thick inner paper or canvas twine. Slides were pleated in three strands of the same material as shoulder cords themselves.\n\n2. NCOs wore silver-grey shoulder cords with a diameter of 4 mm. Their Schulterschnurre were made of black cotton wrapped in flat silver-plated threads. Decorative slides manufactured of dull silver-grey threads, similar to shoulder cords. Its worth mentioning here that NCOs occasionally wore non-regulation officers shoulder cords.\n\n3. Officers Schulterschnurre were similar to those of NCOs except for the decorative slides that were of a bright silver color acquired by usage of white cotton yarn with silver threads.\n\n4. Generals, including medical and veterinary officers with the rank of General (Generalstabsarzt, Generalstabsarzt der Armee и Generalstabsveterinär), wore matt gold shoulder cords. Their slides were manufactured of yellow cotton yarn wrapped in round gold-plated metal threads.\n\n1  other ranks; 2  NCOs; 3  officers; 4  Generals, including medical and veterinary officers with the rank of General.\n\nIII. Sleeve badges (Ärmelspiegel zur Kennzeichnung der Waffengattung und des Truppenteils)\n\nSleeve badges in vertical oval shape measuring 75-80x55 mm were instituted on June 03, 1919 (on July 03 in Bavaria) to distinguish branch of service and specialization of military personnel, as well as to designate concrete unit. The only exception was made for officers of the War Ministry and the General Staff. Removable sleeve badges were worn on the upper part of both sleeves of field tunics and overcoats, but not on drill jackets.\n\nThree major identification elements of sleeve badges were as follows:\n\nа) Main color, that filled the outer wide ring of the sleeve badge and denoted branch of service. The edging in main color was made of 3 mm wide flat colored cord or machine embroidery sewn on 2 mm inside the edge of the sleeve badge.\n\nb) Secondary color, that filled the inner thin ring of the sleeve and denoted specialization. In certain cases it was absent. The edging in secondary color was made of 1,5 mm wide flat colored cord or machine embroidery sewn on directly inside the outer wide ring.\n\nc) Devices, i.e. Arabic or Roman numerals, numbers, Gothic letters and various emblems that were situated inside the inner ring and denoted concrete unit. The height of letters and numbers was 27 mm, unless they were followed by emblems at the bottom. In that case letters and numbers were accordingly smaller. All the devices denoting concrete unit were made either of colored cloth or were machine embroidered. Privately purchased sleeve badges were hand embroidered, though. Numerals on officers sleeve badges were made of gilt metal and were actually removed from their Imperial shoulder boards.\n\nBranch of service and specialization\n\nWar Ministry, General Staff:\n\nPrimary Color:Crimson\n\nSecondary Color: -\n\nInfantry\n\nPrimary Color:White\n\nSecondary Color: \n\nRifles regiments\n\nPrimary Colors:Light green\n\nSecondary Colors:White\n\nJäger battalions\n\nPrimary Color:Light green\n\nSecindary Color:Dark green\n\nMachine gun units\n\nPC:Light green\n\nSCGolden yellow\n\nMachine gun sharpshooter units\n\nPC:Light green\n\nSC: Bright red\n\nMountain machine gun units\n\nPC: Light green\n\nSC: Light blue\n\nCavalry\n\nPC: Golden yellow\n\nSC: -"
