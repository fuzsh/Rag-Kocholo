Collar tabs are machine-applied, shoulder straps are sew-in piped in white with a single gold pip. Breast eagle is hand-applied. The grey collar underside reinforcement fabric exhibits stitching lines for previous rhomboid (Luftwaffe?) style collar tabs, and in fact you can feel the tabs still sewn in place underneath the fabric (however there is no evidence they were sewn to this tunic collar).

I imagine there is a slight possibility this officer served in the FJ units, which may also explain it.
