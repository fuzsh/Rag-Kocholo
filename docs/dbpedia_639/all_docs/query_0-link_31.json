Transfusion practices differ among hospitals and it is unknown which transfusion practices improve survival. This report describes the experience of the PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) Study Data Coordination Center in designing and coordinating a study to examine transfusion practices at ten Level 1 trauma centers in the U.S. Methods PROMMTT was a multisite prospective observational study of severely injured transfused trauma patients. The clinical sites collected real-time information on the timing and amounts of blood product infusions as well as colloids and crystalloids, vital signs, initial diagnostic and clinical laboratory tests, life saving interventions and other clinical care data. Results Between July 2009 and October 2010, PROMMTT screened 12,561 trauma admissions and enrolled 1,245 patients who received one or more blood transfusions within 6 hours of ED admission. A total of 297 massive transfusions were observed over the course of the study at a combined rate of 5.0 massive transfusion patients/week. Conclusion PROMMTT is the first multisite study to collect real-time prospective data on trauma patients requiring transfusion. Support from the Department of Defense and collaborative expertise from the ten participating centers helped to demonstrate the feasibility of prospective trauma transfusion studies. The observational data collected from this study will be an invaluable resource for research in trauma surgery and it will guide the design and conduct of future randomized trials.

Retrospective and randomized prospective studies could show the feasibility of single-incision surgery without any increased risk to the patient. However, large prospective multicenter observational datasets do not currently exist. This prospective multicenter observational quality study will provide a relevant dataset reflecting the feasibility and safety of single-incision surgery. This study focuses on external validity, clinical relevance, and the patients' perspective. Accordingly, the single-incision multiport/single port laparoscopic abdominal surgery (SILAP) study will supplement the existing evidence, which does not currently allow evidence-based surgical decision making. The SILAP study is an international prospective multicenter observational quality study. Mortality, morbidity, complications during surgery, complications postoperatively, patient characteristics, and technical aspects will be monitored. We expect more than 100 surgical centers to participate with 5000 patients with abdominal single-incision surgery during the study period. Funding was obtained in 2012. Enrollment began on January 01, 2013, and will be completed on December 31, 2018. As of January 2016, 2119 patients have been included, 106 German centers are registered, and 27 centers are very active (>5 patients per year). This prospective multicenter observational quality study will provide a relevant dataset reflecting the feasibility and safety of single-incision surgery. An international enlargement and recruitment of centers outside of Germany is meaningful.

It causes lesions to skin, mucosae and semi-mucosae by means of allergic and irritant pathogenic mechanisms. Among the main triggers of contact dermatitis in the pediatric age are chemical or physical agents, which cause irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), and sensitizers, which cause a tissue damage through an allergic mechanism (allergic contact dermatitis [ACD]). A prospective, multicenter, observational study was carried out in 204 children affected by contact dermatitis, aged up to 14 years, and enrolled by pediatricians from 7 different Italian provinces. The diagnosis of contact dermatitis was based on the pediatrician's clinical evaluation. The data were collected through a series of simple and multiple choice questions, anonymously filled out by pediatricians. In 90% of cases (184 of 204 patients), there was complete remission of contact dermatitis, with no cases of worsening. No adverse events were observed, either. The effectiveness of the therapy was rated as \"very effective\" by 84.4% of the parents and 86.8% of the pediatricians. In only 10 patients a new therapy had to be prescribed. Contact dermatitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory skin disease induced by contact with different kinds of environmental agents. Cutaneous manifestations are highly variable and depend on the modality of contact, on the causative agent and on the pathogenesis. This Italian experience of a clinical approach to contact dermatitis stresses the need of daily skin care through different therapeutic strategies, based on the diagnosis, the clinical severity and the parents and children compliance. The first therapeutic measure to be implemented is prevention, through the removal of the causative agent and the use of protective devices. Indeed, preserving the skin's barrier function is an important goal and\n\nHow Many Samples and How Many Culture Media To Diagnose a Prosthetic Joint Infection: a Clinical and Microbiological Prospective Multicenter Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLÃ©ger, Julie; TandÃ©, Didier; Plouzeau, ChloÃ©; Valentin, Anne Sophie; Jolivet-Gougeon, Anne; LemariÃ©, Carole; Kempf, Marie; HÃ©ry-Arnaud, GeneviÃ¨ve; Bret, Laurent; Juvin, Marie Emmanuelle; Giraudeau, Bruno; Burucoa, Christophe\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlthough numerous perioperative samples and culture media are required to diagnose prosthetic joint infection (PJI), their exact number and types have not yet been definitely determined with a high level of proof. We conducted a prospective multicenter study to determine the minimal number of samples and culture media required for accurate diagnosis of PJI. Over a 2-year period, consecutive patients with clinical signs suggesting PJI were included, with five perioperative samples per patient. The bacteriological and PJI diagnosis criteria were assessed using a random selection of two, three, or four samples and compared with those obtained using the recommended five samples (references guidelines). The results obtained with two or three culture media were then compared with those obtained with five culture media for both criteria. The times-to-positivity of the different culture media were calculated. PJI was confirmed in 215/264 suspected cases, with a bacteriological criterion in 192 (89%). The PJI was monomicrobial (85%) or polymicrobial (15%). Percentages of agreement of 98.1% and 99.7%, respectively, for the bacteriological criterion and confirmed PJI diagnosis were obtained when four perioperative samples were considered. The highest percentages of agreement were obtained with the association of three culture media, a blood culture bottle, a chocolate agar plate, and Schaedler broth, incubated for 5, 7, and 14 days, respectively. This new procedure leads to significant cost saving. Our prospective multicenter study showed that four samples seeded on three culture media are sufficient for diagnosing PJI.

This is a prospective, open label, single-arm, multicenter (16 sites), post marketing observational study enrolling patients implanted with Superia-Sirolimus Eluting Coronary Stent (SSECS) in routine clinical practice in India. A total of 200 Patients of coronary Artery Disease (CAD) implanted with Superia-Sirolimus Eluting Coronary Stent (SSECS) were enrolled. Clinical assessments were done at 30 days, 180 days and at 1, 2 years either telephonically or office visit. A cohort of 50 pre-selected patients were followed up for angiographic evaluation at 180 days. MACE at 12 month of follow up was 1.71%.Late lumen loss, in segment was 0.14 and in stent was 0.10 mm at 6 month of follow-up. TLR was required only in 2 patients. Superia stent is as safe as other biodegradable polymer stent in the market and time has come for biodegradable polymer stent with thin struts. Copyright Â© 2014 Cardiological Society of India.

This single-arm prospective multicenter clinical study evaluates RFA in the treatment of painful VBM. Fifty patients with VBM were prospectively enrolled during a 13-month period at eight US centers under an IRB-approved study. Percutaneous RFA was performed under imaging guidance with cement augmentation at the discretion of the operator. Pain, disability and quality of life were evaluated at baseline, prior to discharge, days 3, 7, 30 and 90 using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General 7 (FACT-G7) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Quality-of-Life Measurement in Patients with Bone Pain (FACT-BP). Adverse events were monitored throughout this time interval. Twenty-six male and 24 female patients (mean age 61.0) underwent 69 treatments (30 thoracic and 39 lumbar). Cement augmentation was performed in 96Â % of reported levels. Significant improvement in mean scores for pain, disability and cancer-specific health-related quality of life from baseline to all time intervals was seen. NRPS improved from 5.9 to 2.1 (pÂ <Â 0.0001). ODI improved from 52.9 to 37.0 (pÂ <Â 0.08). FACT-G7 improved form 10.9 to 16.2 (pÂ =Â 0.0001). FACT-BP improved from 22.6 to 38.9 (pÂ <Â 0.001). No complications related to the procedure were reported. RFA with cement augmentation safely and effectively reduces pain and disability rapidly, while increasing quality of life in patients suffering from vertebral body metastases.\n\nClinical impact of 8 prospective, randomized, multicenter glaucoma trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nPanarelli, Joseph F; Banitt, Michael R; Sidoti, Paul A; Budenz, Donald L; Singh, Kuldev\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo determine the impact of 8 multicenter randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on glaucoma practice. An electronic survey was distributed to the members of the American Glaucoma Society (AGS). Each participant was asked 2 study-specific questions and 1 standard question common to all 8 RCTs assessing the study's impact on clinical practice. RCTs included in the survey were the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS), Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS), Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma (CNTG) Study, European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS), Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT), Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), and Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. A 5-point Likert scale was used for rating all responses. The practice setting and duration of glaucoma practice was determined for all AGS members who responded. A total of 206 (23.0%) of 894 AGS members participated in the survey. Among those who responded, 46.4% were self classified as academic practitioners and 53.6% worked in a private practice setting. Mean Likert scores for the standard question evaluating the overall impact of the RCT were OHTS 4.47, CNTG Study 4.13, AGIS 3.78, TVT Study 3.53, EMGT 3.48, CIGTS 3.44, GLT 3.39, and 2.69 EGPS. Substantial differences were observed in the clinical impact of several RCTs in glaucoma. The reported impact of each study likely reflects several factors including study timing, design, conduct, and interpretation of results.\n\nHow Many Samples and How Many Culture Media To Diagnose a Prosthetic Joint Infection: a Clinical and Microbiological Prospective Multicenter Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ©mer, Pascale; LÃ©ger, Julie; TandÃ©, Didier; Plouzeau, ChloÃ©; Valentin, Anne Sophie; Jolivet-Gougeon, Anne; LemariÃ©, Carole; Kempf, Marie; HÃ©ry-Arnaud, GeneviÃ¨ve; Bret, Laurent; Juvin, Marie Emmanuelle; Giraudeau, Bruno; Corvec, StÃ©phane; Burucoa, Christophe\n\n2016-02-01\n\nAlthough numerous perioperative samples and culture media are required to diagnose prosthetic joint infection (PJI), their exact number and types have not yet been definitely determined with a high level of proof.

EpiScan is used as alarm device to notify medical staff of epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in case of a seizure. A prospective multi-center study was performed in three EMUs including 205 patients. A comparison between EpiScan and the Persyst seizure detector on the prospective data will be presented. In addition, the detection results of EpiScan on retrospective EEG data of 310 patients and the public available CHB-MIT dataset will be shown. A detection sensitivity of 81% was reached for unequivocal electrographic seizures with false alarm rate of only 7 per day. No statistical significant differences in the detection sensitivities could be found between the centers. The comparison to the Persyst seizure detector showed a lower false alarm rate of EpiScan but the difference was not of statistical significance. The automatic seizure detection method EpiScan showed high sensitivity and low false alarm rate in a prospective multi-center study on a large number of patients. The application as seizure alarm device in EMUs becomes feasible and will raise the efficiency of video-EEG monitoring and the safety levels of patients.

The identification of the causative pathogen is crucial for an early optimization of the antimicrobial treatment regime. In this context, culture-based diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood cultures) represent the standard of care, although they are associated with relevant limitations. Accordingly, culture-independent molecular diagnostic procedures might be of help for the identification of the causative pathogen in infected patients. The concept of an unbiased sequence analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma samples of septic patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently been identified to be a promising diagnostic platform for critically ill patients suffering from bloodstream infections. Although this new approach might be more sensitive and specific than culture-based state-of-the-art technologies, additional clinical trials are needed to exactly define the performance as well as clinical value of a NGS-based approach. Next GeneSiS is a prospective, observational, noninterventional, multicenter study to assess the diagnostic performance of a NGS-based approach for the detection of relevant infecting organisms in patients with suspected or proven sepsis [according to recent sepsis definitions (sepsis-3)] by the use of the quantitative sepsis indicating quantifier (SIQ) score in comparison to standard (culture-based) microbiological diagnostics. The clinical value of this NGS-based approach will be estimated by a panel of independent clinical specialists, retrospectively identifying potential changes in patients' management based on NGS results. Further subgroup analyses will focus on the clinical value especially for patients suffering from a failure of empiric treatment within the first 3 days after onset [as assessed by death of the patient or lack of improvement of the patient's clinical condition (in terms of an inadequate decrease of SOFA-score) or\n\nA Prospective Multi-Center Audit of Nutrition Support Parameters Following Burn Injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurmis, Rochelle; Heath, Kathryn; Ooi, Selena; Munn, Zachary; Forbes, Sharon; Young, Vicki; Rigby, Paul; Wood, Kate; Phillips, Frances; Greenwood, John\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe importance of nutrition support delivery to the severe burn-injured patient is well recognized, however, nutrition provision to the patient may be sub optimal in practice. The aim of this study was to conduct a prospective multi-center audit across Australia and New Zealand using the Joanna Briggs Institute Burns Node Nutrition audit criteria. Thirty-four patients with severe burn injury (â¥20% TBSA in adults and â¥10% TBSA in children) were identified on admission or on referral to the Dietitian at the eight participating Burn Units between February 1, 2012 and April 30, 2012 for inclusion in the study. De-identified patient data was analyzed using the Joanna Briggs Institute, Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System. Compliance with individual audit criterion ranged from 33 to 100%. Provision of prescribed enteral feed volumes and weekly weighing of patients were highlighted as key areas for clinical improvement. Clinical audit is a valuable tool for evaluating current practice against best evidence to ensure that quality patient care is delivered. The use of the Joanna Briggs Institute Burns Node audit criteria has allowed for a standardized multi-center audit to be conducted. Improving nutrition support delivery in burn patients was identified as a key area requiring ongoing clinical improvement across Australia and New Zealand. Clinician feedback on use of the audit criteria will allow for future refinement of individual criterion, and presentation of results of this audit has resulted in a review of the Bi-National Burns Registry nutrition quality indicators.\n\nWho Donates Their Body to Science?

Methods In this multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study, the videoCAPillaroscopy (CAP) study, we evaluated 623 patients with SSc from 59 centers (14 countries). Patients were stratified into 2 groups: a DU history group and a no DU history group. At enrollment, patients underwent detailed nailfold videocapillaroscopic evaluation and assessment of demographic characteristics, DU status, and clinical and SSc characteristics. Risk factors for developing new DUs were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) analyses. Results Of the 468 patients in the DU history group (meanâÂ±âSD age 54.0âÂ±â13.7 years), 79.5% were female, 59.8% had limited cutaneous SSc, and 22% developed a new DU during followâup. The strongest risk factors for new DUs identified by MLR in the DU history group included the mean number of capillaries per millimeter in the middle finger of the dominant hand, the number of DUs (categorized as 0, 1, 2, or â¥3), and the presence of critical digital ischemia. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the area under the curve (AUC) of the final MLR model was 0.738 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.681â0.795). Internal validation through bootstrap generated a ROC AUC of 0.633 (95% CI 0.510â0.756). Conclusion This international prospective study, which included detailed nailfold videocapillaroscopic evaluation and extensive clinical characterization of patients with SSc, identified the mean number of capillaries per millimeter in the middle finger of the dominant hand, the number of DUs at enrollment, and the presence of critical digital ischemia at enrollment as risk factors for the development of new DUs.

Of the 468 patients in the DU history group (meanâÂ±âSD age 54.0âÂ±â13.7 years), 79.5% were female, 59.8% had limited cutaneous SSc, and 22% developed a new DU during follow-up. The strongest risk factors for new DUs identified by MLR in the DU history group included the mean number of capillaries per millimeter in the middle finger of the dominant hand, the number of DUs (categorized as 0, 1, 2, or â¥3), and the presence of critical digital ischemia. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the area under the curve (AUC) of the final MLR model was 0.738 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.681-0.795). Internal validation through bootstrap generated a ROC AUC of 0.633 (95% CI 0.510-0.756). This international prospective study, which included detailed nailfold videocapillaroscopic evaluation and extensive clinical characterization of patients with SSc, identified the mean number of capillaries per millimeter in the middle finger of the dominant hand, the number of DUs at enrollment, and the presence of critical digital ischemia at enrollment as risk factors for the development of new DUs.

A second cohort of patients (n = 350) treated with the AEG under a controlled-use interval prior to the prospective trial was simultaneously evaluated. Technical success in both groups of patients (96.9% and 97.4%, respectively) was similar to what was reported in pre-market clinical trials. Operative implantation complications unique to the AEG included graft limb stenosis/occlusion in 35.6 and 31.4%, contralateral pull wire being caught on hooks in 33.7 and 28%, failure to seal (type I endoleak) in 17.2 and 18.3%, jacket guard being stuck in 12.9 and 11%, contralateral wire being stuck in 6.8 and 7.1%, high jacket retraction force in 16 and 8.5%, and inability to retract jacket in 1.8 and 0.5% of patients involved in the multicenter trial and controlled-use interval, respectively. One of four patients undergoing conversion in the prospective trial had graft misdeployment as a mode of failure. Three were converted for access failure. The 30-day mortality rate in the prospective trial was 3.7%. Interventions to resolve implantation-related events included stenting, guide catheter manipulations, wire exchanges, and delivery catheter disassembly. These interventions were successful in virtually every case. Open surgical procedures were not needed to correct these operative problems. Results from this study demonstrate excellent technical success with the AEG in the post-market era. Interventions to resolve implantation complications, when utilized, are highly successful in facilitating AEG implantation and providing technical success.\n\nDiagnostic performance of computed tomography coronary angiography (from the Prospective National Multicenter Multivendor EVASCAN Study).\n\nPubMed\n\nGueret, Pascal; Deux, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Bonello, Laurent; Sarran, Anthony; Tron, Christophe; Christiaens, Luc; Dacher, Jean-Nicolas; Bertrand, David; Leborgne, Laurent; Renard, Cedric; Caussin, Christophe; Cluzel, Philippe; Helft, Gerard; Crochet, Dominique; Vernhet-Kovacsik, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Chabbert, ValÃ©rie; Ferrari, Emile; Gilard, Martine; Willoteaux, Serge; Furber, Alain; Barone-Rochette, Gilles; Jankowski, Adrien; Douek, Philippe; Mousseaux, Elie; Sirol, Marc; Niarra, Ralph; Chatellier, Gilles; Laissy, Jean-Pierre\n\n2013-02-15\n\nComputed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) has been proposed as a noninvasive test for significant coronary artery disease (CAD), but only limited data are available from prospective multicenter trials. The goal of this study was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of CTCA compared to coronary angiography (CA) in a large population of symptomatic patients with clinical indications for coronary imaging. This national, multicenter study was designed to prospectively evaluate stable patients able to undergo CTCA followed by conventional CA. Data from CTCA and CA were analyzed in a blinded fashion at central core laboratories. The main outcome was the evaluation of patient-, vessel-, and segment-based diagnostic performance of CTCA to detect or rule out significant CAD (â¥50% luminal diameter reduction). Of 757 patients enrolled, 746 (mean age 61 Â± 12 years, 71% men) were analyzed. They underwent CTCA followed by CA 1.7 Â± 0.8 days later using a 64-detector scanner. The prevalence of significant CAD in native coronary vessels by CA was 54%. The rate of nonassessable segments by CTCA was 6%. In a patient-based analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of CTCA were 91%, 50%, 68%, 83%, 1.82, and 0.18, respectively. The strongest predictors of false-negative results on CTCA were high estimated pretest probability of CAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, p <0.001), male gender (OR 1.5, pÂ <0.002), diabetes (OR 1.5, p <0.0001), and age (OR 1.2, p <0.0001). In conclusion, in this large multicenter study, CTCA identified significant CAD with high sensitivity. However, in routine clinical practice, each patient should be individually evaluated, and the pretest probability of obstructive CAD should be taken into account when deciding which method, CTCA or CA, to use to diagnose its presence and severity.

The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the incidence, clinical signs, blood and cerebrospinal fluid in EV and HPeV infected children. To compare the clinical symptoms and laboratory data of children with different EV and HPeV genotypes. This study is part of a multicenter prospective cohort study. Children were included in 3 different hospitals in The Netherlands from 2008 to 2011. Of 285 included patients, 140 (49%) had EV and 44 (15%) HPeV infection. Of children with EV infection 9 (6%) had EV-A, 109 (78%) EV-B, 12 (9%) had a non-type able EV and in 10 (7%) no genotyping was performed. Of children with HPeV infection, 24 (55%) had HPeV-3, 6 (14%) HPeV-1, 2 (5%) HPeV-4 and 1 (2%) HPeV-6. Meningitis was more frequent in EV than in HPeV infected children (54% vs. 36%, p=0.046), and in EV-B than EV-A infected children (60 vs. 33%). In contrast gastroenteritis was more frequent in HPeV than EV infected children (30% vs. 15%, p=0.030), and significantly more in HPeV-1 than HPeV-3 infected children (p<0.001). EV infection is more often associated with meningitis and HPeV infection more often with a gastro-enteritis. EV genotype B infection is more often associated with meningitis than EV genotype A infection. HPeV-1 infection was more often associated with gastroenteritis than HPeV-3 infection.

It has been validated retrospectively in a single center in South Korea. We aimed to validate the OPS prospectively for advanced cancer inpatients in South Korea using a multicenter study. This was a prospective cohort study. We enrolled 243 advanced cancer patients admitted in five palliative care units in South Korea from May 2013 till March 2015. Seven members of the Korean Palliative Medicine Research Network who are experts of palliative care led the study. Clinical variables (dyspnea/anorexia/performance status) and laboratory variables (total leukocyte counts/serum total bilirubin/serum creatinine/lactate dehydrogenase) were collected at the enrollment. Survival time was calculated as days from enrollment to death during admission. A total of 217 patients were included in the final analysis (feasibility: 89.3%). Survival time of the higher OPS group (OPS â¥3) and the lower OPS group (OPS <3) was 10.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.72-12.28) days and 32.0 (95% CI 25.44-38.56) days, respectively. There were significant differences between the 2 groups (pâ<â0.001). Overall accuracy of OPS â¥3 for predicting survival less than three weeks was 71.0%. OPS was successfully validated using a prospective multicenter study in South Korea. It is a useful method to predict three-week survival of Korean inpatients with advanced cancer.\n\nSocio-demographic and clinical profiles of paranoid and nonparanoid schizophrenia: a prospective, multicenter study in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiang, Yu-Tao; Wang, Chuan-Yue; Chiu, Helen F K; Weng, Yong-Zhen; Bo, Qi-Jing; Chan, Sandra S M; Lee, Edwin H M; Ungvari, Gabor S\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThis study aimed to explore the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of paranoid and nonparanoid subtypes of schizophrenia. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, longitudinal study, 374 clinically stable schizophrenia patients were interviewed at entry with standardized assessment instruments and followed for 12-26 months. In the multivariate analysis, male sex, married marital status, urban abode, and more frequent relapse over the study period were independently associated with paranoid schizophrenia. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia are different from those of their Caucasian counterparts who are more likely to be women and have a better outcome.

Here, the authors report prospective, multicenter results from the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN) to provide the most accurate determination of morbidity, complication incidence, and efficacy of ETV in children and to determine if intraoperative predictors of ETV success add substantially to preoperative predictors. METHODS All children undergoing a first ETV (without choroid plexus cauterization) at 1 of 7 HCRN centers up to June 2013 were included in the study and followed up for a minimum of 18 months. Data, including detailed intraoperative data, were prospectively collected as part of the HCRN's Core Data Project and included details of patient characteristics, ETV failure (need for repeat hydrocephalus surgery), and, in a subset of patients, postoperative complications up to the time of discharge. RESULTS Three hundred thirty-six eligible children underwent initial ETV, 18.8% of whom had undergone shunt placement prior to the ETV. The median age at ETV was 6.9 years (IQR 1.7-12.6), with 15.2% of the study cohort younger than 12 months of age. The most common etiologies were aqueductal stenosis (24.8%) and midbrain or tectal lesions (21.2%). Visible forniceal injury (16.6%) was more common than previously reported, whereas severe bleeding (1.8%), thalamic contusion (1.8%), venous injury (1.5%), hypothalamic contusion (1.5%), and major arterial injury (0.3%) were rare. The most common postoperative complications were CSF leak (4.4%), hyponatremia (3.9%), and pseudomeningocele (3.9%). New neurological deficit occurred in 1.5% cases, with 0.5% being permanent. One hundred forty-one patients had documented failure of their ETV requiring repeat hydrocephalus surgery during follow-up, 117 of them during the first 6 months postprocedure.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia may improve outcomes, but optimal methods to ensure implementation of guidelines in the intensive care unit are unclear. Hence, we determined the effect of educational sessions augmented with reminders, and led by local opinion leaders, as strategies to implement evidence-based ventilator-associated pneumonia guidelines on guideline concordance and ventilator-associated pneumonia rates. Two-year prospective, multicenter, time-series study conducted between June 2007 and December 2009. Eleven ICUs (ten in Canada, one in the United States); five academic and six community ICUs. At each site, 30 adult patients mechanically ventilated >48 hrs were enrolled during four data collection periods (baseline, 6, 15, and 24 months). Guideline recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia were implemented using a multifaceted intervention (education, reminders, local opinion leaders, and implementation teams) directed toward the entire multidisciplinary ICU team. Clinician exposure to the intervention was assessed at 6, 15, and 24 months after the introduction of this intervention. The main outcome measure was aggregate concordance with the 14 ventilator-associated pneumonia guideline recommendations. One thousand three hundred twenty patients were enrolled (330 in each study period). Clinician exposure to the multifaceted intervention was high and increased during the study: 86.7%, 93.3%, 95.8%, (p < .001), as did aggregate concordance (mean [SD]): 50.7% (6.1), 54.4% (7.1), 56.2% (5.9), 58.7% (6.7) (p = .007). Over the study period, ventilator-associated pneumonia rates decreased (events/330 patients): 47 (14.2%), 34 (10.3%), 38 (11.5%), 29 (8.8%) (p = .03).

Initial studies have shown a low complication rate with good efficacy. To report clinical and anatomical results of the WEB treatment in the cumulative population of three Good Clinical Practice (GCP) studies: WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm), French Observatory, and WEBCAST-2. WEBCAST, French Observatory, and WEBCAST-2 are single-arm, prospective, multicenter, GCP studies dedicated to the evaluation of WEB treatment. Clinical data were independently evaluated. Postoperative and 1-year aneurysm occlusion was independently evaluated using the 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. The cumulative population comprised 168 patients with 169 aneurysms, including 112 female subjects (66.7%). The patients' ages ranged between 27 and 77 years (mean 55.5Â±10.2 years). Aneurysm locations were middle cerebral artery in 86/169 aneurysms (50.9%), anterior communicating artery in 36/169 (21.3%), basilar artery in 30/169 (17.8%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 17/169 (10.1%). The aneurysm was ruptured in 14/169 (8.3%). There was no mortality at 1âmonth and procedure/device-related morbidity was 1.2% (2/168). At 1âyear, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed in 81/153 aneurysms (52.9%), neck remnant in 40/153 aneurysms (26.1%), and aneurysm remnant in 32/153 aneurysms (20.9%). Re-treatment was carried out in 6.9%. This series is at the moment the largest prospective, multicenter, GCP series of patients with aneurysms treated with WEB.

The objective of the study was to determine the clinical factors that influence decision-making to hospitalize low-risk patients (PSI â¤2) with CAP. An observational, prospective, multicenter study of consecutive CAP patients was performed at five hospitals in Spain. Patients admitted with CAP and a PSI â¤2 were identified. Admitting physicians completed a patient-specific survey to identify the clinical factors influencing the decision to admit a patient. The reason for admission was categorized into 1 of 6 categories. We also assessed whether the reason for admission was associated with poorer clinical outcomes [intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 30-day mortality or readmission]. One hundred and fifty-five hospitalized patients were enrolled. Two or more reasons for admission were seen in 94 patients (60.6%), including abnormal clinical test results (60%), signs of clinical deterioration (43.2%), comorbid conditions (28.4%), psychosocial factors (28.4%), suspected H1N1 pneumonia (20.6%), and recent visit to the emergency department (ED) in the past 2 weeks (7.7%). Signs of clinical deterioration and abnormal clinical test results were associated with poorer clinical outcomes (P<0.005). Low-risk patients with CAP and a PSI â¤2 are admitted to the hospital for multiple reasons. Abnormal clinical test results and signs of clinical deterioration are two specific reasons for admission that are associated with poorer clinical outcomes in low risk CAP patients.\n\nClinical and Biological Predictors of Plasma Levels of Soluble RAGE in Critically Ill Patients: Secondary Analysis of a Prospective Multicenter Observational Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPranal, Thibaut; Pereira, Bruno; Berthelin, Pauline; Roszyk, Laurence; Chabanne, Russell; Eisenmann, Nathanael; Lautrette, Alexandre; Belville, Corinne; Blondonnet, Raiko; Gillart, Thierry; Skrzypczak, Yvan; Souweine, Bertrand; Bouvier, Damien; Constantin, Jean-Michel\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRationale Although soluble forms of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been recently proposed as biomarkers in multiple acute or chronic diseases, few studies evaluated the influence of usual clinical and biological parameters, or of patient characteristics and comorbidities, on circulating levels of soluble RAGE in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with 3 major subtypes of TVS (transient monocular blindness [TMB], homonymous lateral hemianopia [HLH], and diplopia). Of 1365 patients, 106 (7.8%) had TVS, including 40 TMB (38%), 34 HLH (32%), 17 diplopia (16%), and 15 others/unknown (14%). Ninety-one patients with 1 of the 3 major subtypes of TVS were included. Symptoms persisted on arrival in 12 (13%) patients. Isolated TVS was significantly more common in TMB than in HLH and diplopia (88%, 62%, and 0%, respectively; Pâ<â.001). Duration of symptoms was shorter in patients with TMB than those with HLH (Pâ=â.004). The ABCD 2 score was significantly lower in patients with TMB compared with those with HLH and diplopia (median 2 [interquartile range 2-3] versus 3 [2-4] and 4 [2-5], respectively; Pâ=â.005). Symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion was seen in 14 (16%) patients, and was more frequent in TMB than in HLH and diplopia (28%, 9%, and 0%, respectively; Pâ=â.015). TVS was an uncommon symptom in our TIA multicenter cohort. Some differences in clinical characteristics were found among subtypes of TVS. Copyright Â© 2018 National Stroke Association.

Specifically, multi-center projects can support large-scale prospective, longitudinal studies that investigate relatively uncommon outcomes, such as anterior cruciate ligament injury. This project was conceived to assess within- and between-center reliability of an affordable, clinical nomogram utilizing two-dimensional video methods to screen for risk of knee injury. The authors hypothesized that the two-dimensional screening methods would provide good-to-excellent reliability within and between institutions for assessment of frontal and sagittal plane biomechanics. Nineteen female, high school athletes participated. Two-dimensional video kinematics of the lower extremity during a drop vertical jump task were collected on all 19 study participants at each of the three facilities. Within-center and between-center reliability were assessed with intra- and inter-class correlation coefficients. Within-center reliability of the clinical nomogram variables was consistently excellent, but between-center reliability was fair-to-good. Within-center intra-class correlation coefficient for all nomogram variables combined was 0.98, while combined between-center inter-class correlation coefficient was 0.63. Injury risk screening protocols were reliable within and repeatable between centers. These results demonstrate the feasibility of multi-site biomechanical studies and establish a framework for further dissemination of injury risk screening algorithms. Specifically, multi-center studies may allow for further validation and optimization of two-dimensional video screening tools. 2b.\n\nProspective Multicenter Study of Community-Associated Skin and Skin Structure Infections due to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLÃ³pez Furst, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; de Vedia, Lautaro; FernÃ¡ndez, Silvina; Gardella, Noella; Ganaha, MarÃ­a Cristina; Prieto, Sergio; Carbone, Edith; Lista, NicolÃ¡s; Rotryng, Flavio; Morera, Graciana I.; Mollerach, Marta; Stryjewski, MartÃ­n E.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is now the most common cause of skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) in several world regions. In Argentina prospective, multicenter clinical studies have only been conducted in pediatric populations. Objective Primary: describe the prevalence, clinical and demographic characteristics of adult patients with community acquired SSSI due to MRSA; secondary: molecular evaluation of CA-MRSA strains. Patients with MRSA were compared to those without MRSA. Materials and Methods Prospective, observational, multicenter, epidemiologic study, with molecular analysis, conducted at 19 sites in Argentina (18 in Buenos Aires) between March 2010 and October 2011. Patients were included if they were â¥14 years, were diagnosed with SSSI, a culture was obtained, and there had no significant healthcare contact identified. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with CA-MRSA. Pulse field types, SCCmec, and PVL status were also determined. Results A total of 311 patients were included. CA-MRSA was isolated in 70% (218/311) of patients. Clinical variables independently associated with CA-MRSA were: presence of purulent lesion (OR 3.29; 95%CI 1.67, 6.49) and age <50 years (OR 2.39; 95%CI 1.22, 4.70). The vast majority of CA-MRSA strains causing SSSI carried PVL genes (95%) and were SCCmec type IV. The sequence type CA-MRSA ST30 spa t019 was the predominant clone. Conclusions CA-MRSA is now the most common cause of SSSI in our adult patients without healthcare contact. ST30, SCCmec IV, PVL+, spa t019 is the predominant clone in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Its prevalence has increased since the use of the aldosterone (ALD)/plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio (ARR). The objective of this study is to determine ARR and ARC (ALD/plasma renin concentration ratio) cut-off values (COV) and their diagnostic concordance (DC%) in the screening for PA in an Argentinian population.Design multicenter prospective study. We studied 353 subjects (104 controls and 249 hypertensive patients). Serum aldosterone, PRA and ARR were determined. In 220 randomly selected subjects, 160 hypertensive patients and 60 controls, plasma renin concentration (PRC) was simultaneously measured and ARC was determined. According to the 95th percentile of controls, we determined a COV of 36 for ARR and 2.39 for ARC, with ALD â¥ 15 ng/dL. In 31/249 hypertensive patients, ARR was â¥ 36. PA diagnosis was established in 8/31 patients (23/31 patients did not complete confirmatory tests). DC% between ARR and ARC was calculated. A significant correlation between ARR and ARC (r = 0.742; p < 0.0001) was found only with PRA > 0.3 ng/mL/h and PRC > 5 pg/mL. DC% for ARR and ARC above or below 36 and 2.39 was 79.1%, respectively. This first Argentinian multicenter study determined a COV of 36 for ARR and 2.39 for ARC. Applying an ARR â¥ 36 in the hypertensive group, we confirmed PA in a higher percentage of patients than the previously reported one in our population. As for ARC, further studies are needed for its clinical application, since DC% is acceptable only for medium range renin values.\n\nTreatment in carbon monoxide poisoning patients with headache: a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nOcak, Tarik; Tekin, Erdal; Basturk, Mustafa; Duran, Arif; Serinken, Mustafa; Emet, Mucahit\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThere is a lack of specificity of the analgesic agents used to treat headache and underlying acute carbon monoxide poisoning. To compare effectiveness of \"oxygen alone\" vs \"metoclopramide plus oxygen\" vs \"metamizole plus oxygen\" therapy in treating carbon monoxide-induced headache. A prospective, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. Three emergency departments in Turkey. Adult carbon monoxide poisoning patients with headache. A total of 117 carbon monoxide-intoxicated patients with headache were randomized into 3 groups and assessed at baseline, 30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 4 hours. The primary outcome was patient-reported improvement rates for headache. Secondary end points included nausea, need for rescue medication during treatment, and reduction in carboxyhemoglobin levels. During observation, there was no statistical difference between drug type and visual analog scale score change at 30 minutes, 90 minutes, or 4 hours, for either headache or nausea. No rescue medication was needed during the study period. The reduction in carboxyhemoglobin levels did not differ among the 3 groups. The use of \"oxygen alone\" is as efficacious as \"oxygen plus metoclopramide\" or \"oxygen plus metamizole sodium\" in the treatment of carbon monoxide-induced headache.

Prospective randomized trials in Western countries have shown that the postoperative use of anti-tumor necrosis factor Î±-antibodies was effective in reducing the recurrence rate. We investigated the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) for the prevention of postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. We performed a prospective randomized multicenter study. Patients who underwent intestinal resection were assigned to groups treated with or without IFX. Immediately after surgery, patients in the IFX group received IFX at 5Â mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6Â weeks, followed by every 8Â weeks for 2Â years. The primary study outcome was the proportion of patients with endoscopic and/or clinical recurrence at 2Â years after surgery. Thirty-eight eligible patients participated in this study: 19 in the IFX group and 19 in the non-IFX group. The disease recurrence rate in the IFX group was 52.6% (10/19), which was significantly lower than that in the non-IFX group (94.7% [18/19]). The postoperative use of IFX is effective in preventing Crohn's disease recurrence for 2Â years.\n\nOrganizational structure and communication strategies of the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation: a multicenter clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaydeck, B L; Sutton-Tyrrell, K; Burek, K; Sopko, G S\n\n1996-06-01\n\nEfficient communication is a challenge for the many operating components of a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Traditional management theory states that communications generally flow along a path established by a hierarchical organizational structure. A multicenter clinical trial does not fit traditional organizational models well and requires modification of traditional communication techniques. While the scientific community typically views a clinical trial as one large and cohesive enterprise, at each site the trial may actually be conducted as a small project related to the medical specialty of the investigator. Therefore overall trial management must be accomplished through collaboration rather than through direct management. In the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI), the BARI clinical coordinating center has designed and utilized several mechanisms that facilitate effective communication and administrative control of a multicenter clinical trial. These mechanisms provide a framework of communication techniques that accommodate the specific needs of a complex organization.\n\nBiodegradable implants versus standard metal fixation for displaced radial head fractures. A prospective, randomized, multicenter study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHelling, Hanns-Joachim; Prokop, Axel; Schmid, Hans Ulrich; Nagel, Michael; Lilienthal, JÃ¼rgen; Rehm, Klaus Emil\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis multicenter, prospective, randomized study compares the use of biodegradable polylactide pins with standard metal mini-fragment implants for the treatment of displaced radial head fractures. It compares complication rates and clinical outcomes of both treatment methods. At 2 years, 135 (82%) of 164 patients were available for evaluation. Equivalence of treatment method was defined as a difference of 10% or less in the number of complication-free patients. Functional status was assessed by using the Broberg and Morrey Elbow Score and compared by an unpaired t test. Good or excellent clinical results were achieved by 92% (56/61) of the control patients and 96% (71/74) of the polylactide patients. The incidence of complication-free patients was 3.7% less in the polylactide group than in the control group. The 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference between the 2 groups was more than -6.1%. Biodegradable polylactide pins have at least comparable outcomes as standard metal implants for the internal fixation of reconstructable displaced radial head fractures.\n\nMiDAS I (mild Decompression Alternative to Open Surgery): a preliminary report of a prospective, multi-center clinical study.\n\nPubMed\n\nChopko, Bohdan; Caraway, David L\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNeurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis is a common problem that can be caused by many factors including hypertrophic ligamentum flavum, facet hypertrophy, and disc protrusion. When standard medical therapies such as pain medication, epidural steroid injections, and physical therapy fail, or when the patient is unwilling, unable, or not severe enough to advance to more invasive surgical procedures, both physicians and patients are often left with a treatment dilemma. Patients in this study were treated with mild, an ultra-minimally invasive lumbar decompression procedure using a dorsal approach. The mild procedure is performed under fluoroscopic imaging to resect bone adjacent to, and achieve partial resection of, the hypertrophic ligamentum flavum with minimal disruption of surrounding muscular and skeletal structure. To assess the clinical application and patient safety and functional outcomes of the mild lumbar decompression procedure in the treatment of symptomatic central canal spinal stenosis. Multi-center, non-blinded, prospective clinical study. Fourteen US spine specialist practices. Between July 2008 and January 2010, 78 patients were enrolled in the MiDAS I Study and treated with the mild procedure for lumbar decompression. Of these patients, 6-week follow-up was available for 75 patients. Visual Analog Score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ), and SF-12v2 Health Survey. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment. There were no major device or procedure-related complications reported in this patient cohort. At 6 weeks, the MiDAS I Study showed statistically and clinically significant reduction of pain as measured by VAS, ZCQ, and SF-12v2. In addition, improvement in physical function and mobility as measured by ODI, ZCQ, and SF-12v2 was statistically and clinically significant in this study. This is a preliminary report encompassing 6-week follow-up.

Our objective was to evaluate the efficiency of signs and symptoms in selectively testing children with pharyngitis. Materials and methods In this multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study, French primary care physicians collected clinical data and double throat swabs from 676 consecutive children with pharyngitis; the first swab was used for the RADT and the second was used for a throat culture (reference standard). We developed a logistic regression model combining signs and symptoms with GAS as the outcome. We then derived a model-based selective testing strategy, assuming that children with low and high calculated probability of GAS (<0.12 and >0.85) would be managed without the RADT. Main outcomes and measures were performance of the model (c-index and calibration) and efficiency of the model-based strategy (proportion of participants in whom RADT could be avoided). Results Throat culture was positive for GAS in 280 participants (41.4%). Out of 17 candidate signs and symptoms, eight were retained in the prediction model. The model had an optimism-corrected c-index of 0.73; calibration of the model was good. With the model-based strategy, RADT could be avoided in 6.6% of participants (95% confidence interval 4.7% to 8.5%), as compared to a RADT-for-all strategy. Conclusions This study demonstrated that relying on signs and symptoms for selectively testing children with pharyngitis is not efficient. We recommend using a RADT in all children with pharyngitis.

The TBGL test and the PCR test were individually not so useful for the rapid diagnosis of smear-negative active pulmonary TB. However, clinical utility was considerably improved by using the TBGL test and the PCR test in combination, especially in patients with smear-negative and culture-negative active pulmonary TB and in patients with minimally advanced lesions.

Diagnosis is currently confirmed using skin tests with benzylpenicillin reagents, ie, penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) as the major determinant of benzylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicilloate and benzylpenilloate as a minor determinant mixture (MDM). To synthesize and assess the diagnostic capacity of 2 new benzylpenicillin reagents in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to B-lactams: benzylpenicilloyl octa-L-lysine (BP-OL) as the major determinant and benzylpenilloate (penilloate) as the minor determinant. Prospective multicenter clinical trial performed in 18 Spanish centers. Efficacy was assessed by detection of positive skin test results in an allergic population and negative skin test results in a nonallergic, drug-exposed population. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were determined. The study sample comprised 94 allergic patients: 31 (35.23%) presented anaphylaxis, 4 (4.55%) anaphylactic shock, 51 (58.04%) urticaria, and 2 (2.27%) no specific condition. The culprit 8-lactams were amoxicillin in 63 cases (71.60%), benzypencillin in 14 cases (15.89%), cephalosporins in 2 cases (2.27%), other drugs in 3 cases (3.42%), and unidentified agents in 6 cases (6.82%). The results of testing with BP-OL were positive in 46 cases (52.3%); the results of testing with penilloate were positive in 33 cases (37.5%). When both reagents were taken into consideration, sensitivity reached 61.36% and specificity 100%. Skin testing with penilloate was significantly more often negative when the interval between the reaction and the study was longer. The sensitivity of BP-OL and penilloate was 61%. Considering that amoxicillin was the culprit drug in 71% of reactions, these results indicate that most patients were allergic to the whole group of penicillins. These data support the use of benzylpenicillin determinants in the diagnosis of allergy\n\nPredicting Dural Tear in Compound Depressed Skull Fractures: A Prospective Multicenter Correlational Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalia, Shemsedin Musefa; Mersha, Hagos Biluts; Aklilu, Abenezer Tirsit; Baleh, Abat Sahlu; Lund-Johansen, Morten\n\n2018-06-01\n\nCompound depressed skull fracture (DSF) is a neurosurgical emergency. Preoperative knowledge of dural status is indispensable for treatment decision making. This study aimed to determine predictors of dural tear from clinical and imaging characteristics in patients with compound DSF. This prospective, multicenter correlational study in neurosurgical hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, included 128 patients operated on from January 1, 2016, to October 31, 2016. Clinical, imaging, and intraoperative findings were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish predictors of dural tear. A logistic regression model was developed to predict probability of dural tear. Model validation was done using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Dural tear was seen in 55.5% of 128 patients. Demographics, injury mechanism, clinical presentation, and site of DSF had no significant correlation with dural tear. In univariate and multivariate analyses, depth of fracture depression (odds ratio 1.3, P < 0.001), pneumocephalus (odds ratio 2.8, PÂ = 0.005), and brain contusions/intracerebral hematoma (odds ratio 5.5, P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with dural tear. We developed a logistic regression model (diagnostic test) to calculate probability of dural tear. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, we determined the cutoff value for a positive test giving the highest accuracy to be 30% with a corresponding sensitivity of 93.0% and specificity of 43.9%. Dural tear in compound DSF can be predicted with 93.0% sensitivity using preoperative findings and may guide treatment decision making in resource-limited settings where risk of extensive cranial surgery outweighs the benefit.

This was a prospective multicenter randomized single-blind, parallel-controlled clinical study. A total of 10 centers participated in this study, the actual number of cases in line with the program was 412, of whom 205 cases in trial group were treated with Guaifenesin compound pseudoephedrine hydrochloride oral solution, and 207 cases in control group with ambroxol hydrochloride oral solution, treatment of both groups persisted for 7 days. The improvement rate of each single symptom and the combined symptoms and the overall effective rate were compared between the two groups. The adverse drug reactions and compliance were assessed as well. The treatment of both groups showed efficacy. Except sputum stickiness, the improvement of all symptoms in trial group was superior to that in the control group on the 3rd day after treatment (P < 0.05) and except nasal congestion, the efficacy in all the other symptoms of trial group was better than that in the control group as well on the 7th day (P < 0.01). The improvement rate for combined symptoms of Guaifenesin compound pseudoephedrine hydrochloride oral solution was 82.9% and the overall efficacy rate was 89.3%. Guaifenesin compound Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride oral solution had higher compliance and its adverse event rate was merely 0.92%. Guaifenesin compound pseudoephedrine hydrochloride oral solution showed significant efficacy and safety in children for treatment of cough, expectoration, nasal congestion and runny nose caused by common cold or acute tracheobronchitis.\n\nEffective symptomatic treatment for severe and intractable pruritus associated with severe burn-induced hypertrophic scars: A prospective, multicenter, controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Jun; Xu, Rui; Zhan, Rixing; Luo, Gaoxing; Niu, Xihua; Liu, Yi; Lee, Benjamin Tak-Kwong; Flury, Meinrad; Wong, Chun-Ho; Fok, Manson; Lau, Johnson Yiu-Nam\n\n2016-08-01\n\nBurn-induced hypertrophic scars are disfiguring and can be associated with severe and intractable pruritus. No effective treatment modalities are currently available for symptomatic control of pruritus for most patients. We assessed the effect of the Antipruritic Hydrogel (CQ-01) in the symptomatic treatment of severe and intractable pruritus associated with burn-induced hypertrophic scars in a prospective, multicenter, controlled trial. A pilot study was conducted in healthy adult volunteers to identify the most appropriate hydrogel formulation. A selected preparation called Chongqing No. 1 (CQ-01; a guar gum-based hydrogel impregnated with peppermint oil, menthol, and methyl salicylate by a nanoemulsion), showed an excellent symptomatic relief in an exploratory study in 2 patients with intractable pruritus. A statistically powered, prospective, multicenter, controlled study was then conducted in 74 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-h application of CQ-01 compared to a gel control and a negative control on three separate areas in each patient. Symptom assessment was based on our visual analog JW scale (ranging from 0 to 100) at baseline and various time points up to 7 days after application. Follow-up studies were conducted to determine the reproducibility of CQ-01 in repeated applications. Of the 74 enrolled subjects, the only observed adverse event was skin irritation reported in 6 patients (8%) and resolved shortly after gel removal. Compared to the baseline, the gauze negative control had a mean JW score reduction of 7; while the gel control and CQ-01 had a drop of 18 (p<0.001) and 36 (p<0.001), respectively. The CQ-01 clinical effect was significant for up to 3 days and waned slowly from 3 to 7 days. There was no statistical correlation between the treatment response and any of the demographic, patient or burn-related factors. Further studies showed a trend that repeated applications might be more effective, suggesting the absence of\n\nHysterectomy for complications after uterine artery embolization for leiomyoma: results of a Canadian multicenter clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nPron, Gaylene; Mocarski, Eva; Cohen, Marsha; Colgan, Terence; Bennett, John; Common, Andrew; Vilos, George; Kung, Rose\n\n2003-02-01\n\nTo determine the complication-related hysterectomy rate after uterine artery embolization (UAE) for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas. Prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, single-arm clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Eight Ontario University-affiliated teaching and community hospitals. Five hundred fifty-five women. Polyvinyl alcohol particles were delivered through a catheter into uterine arteries under fluoroscopic guidance. Prospective follow-up investigations consisted of telephone interviews, ultrasound examinations, and reviews of pathology and surgery reports. Median follow-up was 8.1 months, and all but five patients had complete 3-month follow-up. At 3 months, eight women (1.5%, 95% CI 0.6-2.8) underwent complication-related hysterectomy. Half of the surgeries were performed at institutions other than where UAE had been performed. Indications for hysterectomies were infections (2), postembolization pain (4), vaginal bleeding (1), and prolapsed leiomyoma (1). The 3-month complication rate resulting in hysterectomy after UAE in a large cohort of women was low. Hysterectomy after UAE is an important measure of safety and a key outcome measure of this new therapy.\n\nA Probabilistic Model for Cushing's Syndrome Screening in At-Risk Populations: A Prospective Multicenter Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeÃ³n-Justel, Antonio; Madrazo-Atutxa, Ainara; Alvarez-Rios, Ana I; Infantes-FontÃ¡n, Rocio; Garcia-ArnÃ©s, Juan A; Lillo-MuÃ±oz, Juan A; Aulinas, Anna; Urgell-Rull, EulÃ lia; Boronat, Mauro; SÃ¡nchez-de-Abajo, Ana; Fajardo-MontaÃ±ana, Carmen; OrtuÃ±o-Alonso, Mario; Salinas-Vert, Isabel; Granada, Maria L; Cano, David A; Leal-Cerro, Alfonso\n\n2016-10-01\n\nCushing's syndrome (CS) is challenging to diagnose. Increased prevalence of CS in specific patient populations has been reported, but routine screening for CS remains questionable. To decrease the diagnostic delay and improve disease outcomes, simple new screening methods for CS in at-risk populations are needed. To develop and validate a simple scoring system to predict CS based on clinical signs and an easy-to-use biochemical test. Observational, prospective, multicenter. Referral hospital. A cohort of 353 patients attending endocrinology units for outpatient visits. All patients were evaluated with late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) and a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test for CS. Diagnosis or exclusion of CS. Twenty-six cases of CS were diagnosed in the cohort. A risk scoring system was developed by logistic regression analysis, and cutoff values were derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve. This risk score included clinical signs and symptoms (muscular atrophy, osteoporosis, and dorsocervical fat pad) and LNSC levels. The estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.93, with a sensitivity of 96.2% and specificity of 82.9%. We developed a risk score to predict CS in an at-risk population. This score may help to identify at-risk patients in non-endocrinological settings such as primary care, but external validation is warranted.\n\nNon-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT): Europe's first multicenter post-market clinical follow-up study validating the quality in clinical routine.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlÃ¶ck, Anne; Tu, Ngoc-Chi; RÃ¼land, Anna; Holzgreve, Wolfgang; Gembruch, Ulrich; Geipel, Annegret\n\n2017-11-01\n\nNon-invasive prenatal tests (NIPT) for the determination of fetal aneuploidies from maternal blood are firmly established in clinical routine. For the first time, the accuracy of an NIPT for the determination of trisomies 21, 18 and 13 in singleton pregnancies was assessed by means of a prospective German-wide multicenter post-market clinical follow-up study, to reliably evaluate the quality in clinical routine. The study covered the indications for testing, the test results, the rate of invasive diagnostics and the pregnancy outcome. 2232 cases were tested for trisomy 21. Of these, 1946 cases were additionally examined for trisomy 18 and 13. Sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 (43/43) and for trisomy 13 (2/2) were 100%, for trisomy 18 the sensitivity was 80% (4/5) with a specificity of 99.8%. Three false-positive results for trisomy 18 were observed (FPR 0.15%). The no-call rate was 0.5%. In this subgroup, 27.3% (3/11) aneuploidies were diagnosed. The rate of invasive procedures was 2.6%. NIPT provides a very high quality for the fetal trisomies 21, 13 and 18 in clinical routine. The results support the recommendation that NIPT should be offered after genetic counseling and only in conjunction with a qualified ultrasound examination.\n\nAdjusted regression trend test for a multicenter clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuan, H; Capizzi, T\n\n1999-06-01\n\nStudies using a series of increasing doses of a compound, including a zero dose control, are often conducted to study the effect of the compound on the response of interest. For a one-way design, Tukey et al. (1985, Biometrics 41, 295-301) suggested assessing trend by examining the slopes of regression lines under arithmetic, ordinal, and arithmetic-logarithmic dose scalings. They reported the smallest p-value for the three significance tests on the three slopes for safety assessments. Capizzi et al. (1992, Biometrical Journal 34, 275-289) suggested an adjusted trend test, which adjusts the p-value using a trivariate t-distribution, the joint distribution of the three slope estimators. In this paper, we propose an adjusted regression trend test suitable for two-way designs, particularly for multicenter clinical trials. In a step-down fashion, the proposed trend test can be applied to a multicenter clinical trial to compare each dose with the control. This sequential procedure is a closed testing procedure for a trend alternative. Therefore, it adjusts p-values and maintains experimentwise error rate. Simulation results show that the step-down trend test is overall more powerful than a step-down least significant difference test.\n\nEndoscopic management of unresectable malignant gastroduodenal obstruction with a nitinol uncovered metal stent: A prospective Japanese multicenter study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSasaki, Reina; Sakai, Yuji; Tsuyuguchi, Toshio; Nishikawa, Takao; Fujimoto, Tatsuya; Mikami, Shigeru; Sugiyama, Harutoshi; Yokosuka, Osamu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To determine the safety and efficacy of endoscopic duodenal stent placement in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction. METHODS: This prospective, observational, multicenter study included 39 consecutive patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction. All patients underwent endoscopic placement of a nitinol, uncovered, self-expandable metal stent. The primary outcome was clinical success at 2 wk after stent placement that was defined as improvement in the Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System score relative to the baseline. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all duodenal stent procedures. Procedure-related complications occurred in 4 patients (10.3%) in the form of mild pneumonitis. No other morbidities or mortalities were observed. The clinical success rate was 92.3%. The mean survival period after stent placement was 103 d. The mean period of stent patency was 149 d and the patency remained acceptable for the survival period. Stent dysfunction occurred in 3 patients (7.7%) on account of tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic management using duodenal stents for patients with incurable malignant gastric outlet obstruction is safe and improved patientsâ quality of life.

Alternatives such as carbamazepine and valproate may also have safety problems, such as hepatotoxicity or central nervous adverse effects. We therefore investigated the safety and efficacy of levetiracetam (LV), a newer antiepileptic with a potentially favorable adverse-effect profile, for the treatment of AWS. One hundred six patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. Levetiracetam was administered in a fixed dose schedule over 6 days. Diazepam was added when symptom triggered as rescue medication. Severity of the"
