        "text": "The following article is taken largely verbatim from \"Officials\", an article appearing in Kettenhunde: The Newsletter of Feldgendarmerie-Trupp (Mot.) 200, Volume IV, Number 1 (Jan/Feb 1994). The article was authored by LTC Louis H. Brown; minor changes in grammar and organization have been made.\n\nThe concept of uniformed civilian personnel in the military is somewhat difficult to understand. A particularly European idea, the German Army probably took the idea to its limits in institutionalization.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThis system, well-entrenched in the German Armed Forces, survived to the end of the Great War. Well-developed in terms of uniforms, insignia, and authority, the officials provided the German Army many of its personnel and logistics services as well as being responsible for most supply and victualling.\n\nOFFICIALS IN THE WEHRMACHT\n\nMost officials (called Beamten) ranked equivalent to officers; there were some with equivalent Unteroffiziere mit Portepee (Senior NCO) ranks. They were members of the Armed Forces according to the Law of Land Warfare, but were not \"soldiers\" by the German definition. As officials, their authority extended only to their specialty field -- unlike soldiers, whose authority extends to anyone whom the individual outranks. Beamten could not hold command. They were entitled to all the customs and courtesies associated with their rank/status, however. In the social order of the day, being an officer was the peak of the pyramid, if you couldn't be a regular officer, being a reserve officer was next best, and a very close approximation of that would have been appointment as an official. In addition to those performing personnel, supply, and logistics functions, army chaplains, doctors, bandmasters and veterinarians were also officials, although their uniforms differed significantly from those of the other officials in being basically those of active officers with distinguishing insignia.\n\nThe main difference between officer and official status depended much on education. Officials were by no means lesser-educated officers -- many had university degrees (which few officers did) -- but they did not meet the professional education/training requirements for appointment as officers or soldiers. Most officials tended to remain such although if the military education qualifications were met, appointment as an officer or soldier could be made. In 1944 the Germans began to laterally appoint all officials to regular officer ranks; how far this program went is conjectural since it was begun so late. Those taken over wore regular officer uniforms. Several new \"branches\", with corresponding branch colours and insignia, were created to accommodate these individuals. Many officials, by the way, were Zwoelfender (\"Twelvers\" -- from the 12-year service requirement), retirees out of the Reichsheer (1919-1935). One of the Reichsheer's member benefits had been retraining during the 12th year of service in a civilian career -- one of the more attractive options was appointment to the Beamtenschule, a training school for government officials which allowed many to come back into the army as civilian administrators.\n\nIt is important to point out that not all German Army civilians were Beamten; many (including women) were hired on the Civil Service scale and served in administrative and clerical positions; basically, they were civilian employees. Women could not serve as officials.)\n\nUNIFORMS\n\nWaffenfarbe - the branch colour for officials was dark green, with specialties further specified by a secondary colour (Nebenfarbe).\n\nAll permanent officials of the High Command Carmine\n\n(Carmesin) All education officials Army suveyors Army librarians Army archivists Army officials of the War Research institute Army museum officials Army meteorologists Army sports instructor officials Record officials attached to various commands Army psychiatrists District Administration officials Red\n\n(Hochrot) Army paymaster officials, other than those serving a Wehrkreis administration White\n\n(Weiss) Other garrison and victualling officials Remount officials Golden Yellow\n\n(Goldgelb) Non-technical instruction personnel in army schools Light Brown\n\n(Hellbraun) Army clothing officials Rose Pink\n\n(Rosa) Pharmaceutical officials Light Green\n\n(Hellgrün) Military Supreme Court officials Bordeaux Red\n\n(Bordorot) Hospital officials Cornflower Blue\n\n(Kornblumen Blau) Military law officials Light Blue\n\n(Hellblau) Technical officials (building, engineering, armoury) Black\n\n(Schwarz) Regimental saddle and harness officials Fortress pioneer officials Recruiting office officials Orange\n\n(Orangerot) Field clergy\n\n(No shoulder straps were worn by Army clergy, nor was the dark green primary waffenfarbe used)) Violet\n\n(Violetten)\n\nBeamten were not addressed by the same titles as regular officers. A paymaster Hauptmann-equivalent, for instance, was a Stabzahlmeister; a Major assigned to the Supreme Court Martial was an Amtsrat beim Reichskriegsgericht. Whether the average landser walking down the street would have known the titles is doubtful, but those who worked with these individuals certainly did. Most any soldier would have recognized a paymaster - - he was an important man in the battalion since he doled out food and money. The titles among officials of equal rank also varied by specialty, so knowing the specific title for one Beamter did not necessarily give any indication at all of another's title.\n\nNote: graphics on the following table are for illustrative purposes either; each branch had its own secondary colour, and some branches such as Field Post Office had their own insignia in place of the HV symbol. Reich Courts Martial officials wore no devices at all, and army clergy wore no shoulder straps at all!\n\nArmy Equivalent Category Title\n\nTranslation\n\nUnteroffiziere ohne Portepee\n\n(Junior Non-Commissioned Officers) Unterfeldwebel-Equivalent Unteroffiziere mit Portepee\n\n(Senior Non-Commissioned Officers) Feldwebel-Equivalent Heeresjustizwachtmeister Army court martial orderly NCO Futtermeister Fodder NCO Magazinmeister NCO in charge of a depot Reichskreigsgerichtswachtmeister State judicial service orderly NCO Lagermeister NCO in a store Amtsgehilfe Administration clerical official in a department Oberfeldwebel-Equivalent Heereswerkmeister NCO in charge of an Army workshop Oberfuttermeister Senior fodder NCO Oberlagermeister Senior NCO in a store Amtsobergehilfe Senior administration clerical official in a department Präparator Candidate\n\nUnteroffiziere\n\n(Non-Commissioned Officers)\n\nSpecific Rank Not Known\n\nWerkführer Foreman Mühlenmeister Master miller Bäckermeister Master baker Regimentssattlermeister Regimental master saddler Festungsoberwerkmeister Fortifications NCO in charge of a workshop Festungswerkmeister Fortifications NCO in a workshop Oberbotenmeister Senior messenger Botenmeister Messenger Ministerialoberamtsgehilfe Senior administration clerical official in a ministry Ministerialamtsgehilfe Administration clerical official in a ministry Heeresunterförster Army forester\n\nObermaschinist\n\nSenior fitter Drucker Printer Laborant Laboratory technician Heizer Fireman Hauswarte Caretaker Lagerwarte Storeman Wächter Watchman Arbeiter Labourer Kompanie-\n\noffiziere\n\n(Company Grade Officers) Specific Rank Not Known Ministerialregistrator Ministry registrar Betriebmeister Managerial works supervisor Betriebsleiter Works managerial leader Oberwerkmeister Senior workshop supervisor Heeresoberförster Army forester Heeresrevierförster Army forestry official Fachschulrektor Headmaster of a technical school Oberfachschullehrer Teacher in an advanced technical school Gewerbeoberlehrer Senior teacher in trade subjects Handelsoberlehrer Senior teacher in commercial subjects Lehrer Teacher Obersekretär der verschiedenen Laufbahnen (technisches und nichttechnisches) Senior secretary of various grades, both technical and non-technical Sekretär der verschiedenen Laufbahnen (technisches und nichttechnisches) Secretary of various grades, both technical and non-technical Heeresschneidermeister Army master tailor Heeresschuhmachermeister Army master shoemaker/cobbler Heeresmachinenmeister Army master machinist/mechanic Heeressattlermeister Army master saddler Korpssattlermeister Army corps master saddler Werkstättenvorsteher Official in charge of workshop Leutnant-Equivalent Zahlmeister Paymaster Inspektor der verschiedenen Laufbahnen (technische and nichttechnische) Official in tecnhical trade or non-technical trade Trigonometer Trigonometric official Waffenrevisor Armament official Waffenmeister Armourer Wallmeister Fortification official Oberleutnant-Equivalent Oberzahlmeister Paymaster Oberinspektorr der verschiedenen Laufbahnen (technische and nichttechnische) Official in tecnhical trade or non-technical trade Kanzleivorsteher Orderly room -

collar patches varied according to the four categories of career field (See the illustrations below). All types of collar patches were rendered on a dark green background, with a border of the Nebenfarbe (secondary colour) on three sides of the patch - top, back, and bottom (ie not along the front of the patch).\n\nThe four grades were based upon the degree of civil education/trade experience required for the position. For example, the einfacher Dienst required only the completion of grammar school while the hoeherer Dienst generally required a university education.\n\nMembership in one of the career fields did not necessarily carry with it a specific rank. Those in the einfacher Dienst bore a rank equivalent to NCOs, those in the upper three categories of career field generally ranked equivalent to company grade officers. Higher grades (ie Stabsoffiziere and above) often were awarded upon the individual's 35th birthday. In some of the specialties of the gehobenen and mittleren Dienste, ranks above Hauptmann-equivalent did not exist.\n\nAt right, a Beamten showing the collar patches for the Middle and Elevated Services. Note also the officer's pattern field cap (with silver crown and flap piping) and the dark green waffenfarbe soutache above the cockade.\n\nOther uniform details - Beamten generally wore the Army officer's uniform with appropriate insignia. Because they were repsonsible for purchasing their own clothing, enlisted-equivalent Beamten were also permitted to wear the officer's quality uniform -- this would have included boots and breeches. General officer officials wore general's breeches with the broad red \"Besatzstreifen.\" Officer-equivalent officials wore the breast eagle of aluminum thread/bullion embroidery (gold for generals) while those of the einfacher Dienst wore the enlisted eagle.\n\nHeadgear conformed to the respective officer versus enlisted patterns with corresponding insignia except that, before its discontinuation in 1942, enlisted-equivalent officials had been permitted to wear the cap knowns as the \"officer's old style field cap\" (often called a \"crusher\" among collectors) with white woven insignia in place of the silver worn by officer-equivalent ranks (those who owned this cap could continue to wear it for the life of the cap even after official discontinuation). Piping on the old style and peaked caps was in dark green, as was the soutache chevron on the M-38. General officer official's caps were piped in gold around the top of the crown and the bottom of the cap band in gold while the upper cap band was in the secondary colour. General's M-38 caps bore gold piping with a dark green soutache.\n\nBelts conformed to the same officer/enlisted divisions with generals showing gold-coloured buckles.\n\nOfficials were not to wear unit insignia (number, cyphers, etc.) on their shoulder boards, nor were they permitted to wear cuff titles other than those that were considered campaign awards (e.g., AFRIKA or KRETA) in \"elite\" units. Beamten had been permitted the Waffenrock prior to the war's outbreak -- officer-equivalent personnel could also wear the officer's (or general's) brocade belt, dagger, and augillette although at one point there was a plan to provide at least a specially-designed dress belt for officials; this never came to fruition.\n\nWARTIME CHANGES - Officials for the Duration of the War\n\nAnother category of offical was introduced after the outbreak of war; those who lacked the qualifications to be full-fledged officials but who possessed critically-needed skills were appointed as \"Beamter auf Kriegsdauer\" (Officials for the Duration of the War). Their secondary colour (Nebenfarbe) was light grey for all specialties (to add more confusion, the career fields were the same as the active officials), shoulder board devices were silver coloured, and special collar patches on a light grey background piped in dark green were worn.\n\nCap bands for officer's caps (both the dress cap and the \"crusher\"), as well as field blouse and greatcoat collars, and the soutache on the new style field cap, all were to be rendered in blue-grey. This was the same uniform colour worn by the Luftwaffe, and in fact, Luftwaffe basic cloth was supposed to be utilized.\n\nExample -the following examples come from the books Uniformen der deutschen Wehrmacht published in April 1939, and The German Army - Men at Arms 320 and give an idea of the complexity of Beamten ranks, titles, and career fields."
