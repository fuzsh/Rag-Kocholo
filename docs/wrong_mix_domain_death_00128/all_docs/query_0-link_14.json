We’ve had the honor of working with a powerhouse team from Lord. They’ve impressed city officials, community leaders, and Rockford Region residents with their knowledge of Rockford’s history and their Rockford current events proficiency — I hear about regional wins from the Lord team before they hit our media’s websites.”\n\nRead More\n\nRecovery Effort on for Archives\n\n“The government [of Barbados] is racing to recover and safeguard invaluable cultural assets following the catastrophic fire at the Department of Archives. The fate of some of the most precious documents from the island’s 397-year-old past remains unknown. These include the landmark 1661 Slave Code, the proclamation of the abolition of slavery in 1834 and the royal warrant approving Barbados’ independence in 1966.”\n\nRead more about the fire here, here and here.\n\nRead More\n\nWe’re delighted to announce the newest addition to the Lord library of books.\n\nManual of Museum Management for Museums in Dynamic Change, the third edition of the classic, is an exciting guide in a time of sweeping changes. Renowned museum planner and Lord President and Co-founder Gail Dexter Lord applies her international experience to create this comprehensive and detailed guide to the tools and strategies needed to successfully address today’s issues and opportunities.\n\nRead More\n\nOther\n\nSome of our most interesting and exciting jobs don’t fit standard categories.
