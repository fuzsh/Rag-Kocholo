Her crowning success was teaching Catholic school kids, their first experience with the music and story of Christmas. With permission of the Mother Superior, kids performed the program with costumes and props in front of the other students, the cloistered Nuns and the parents. Continuing to follow her love of vocal music, she sang in the base Protestant chapel choirs. Later she taught herself to be a choir director, discovering and learning all the nuances of individual musical parts, language and symbols that determine the timing,tempo, dynamics, hand gestures and signals for conducting, and facial expressions to produce complete professional musical presentations. Many ofher participating singers were novices and inexperienced, but she worked to help them develop into accomplished choir and musical members, some performing solos. Her favorite music programs were cantatas performed for Christmas and Easter and at some of the chapels she also founded youth choirs. In addition, she directed Officer Wives Choruses that performed on and off base.

Over the years she received many commendations and letters of appreciation from base Chaplains, base commanders and the public. While stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, she became a Red Cross volunteer at Luke AFB Hospital. Her initial assignment was to provide occupational therapy projects to patients. She developed a program where the patients would paint a ceramic item, then she would then take the item away for firing and return the finished item to the patient. Some long-term patients even painted complete Christmas creches. The program was a patient favorite that helped promote recovery and rehabilitation. Later, she was assigned to manage nearly all Red Cross volunteers in the Hospital. Concurrently, she was tasked by the hospital commander to train all the volunteers and some hospital staff on how to best treat and serve patients. She was awarded letters of commendation and was selected as Red Cross Volunteer of the Year. At Red Mountain United Methodist Church in Mesa, she was Chairwoman of the Visitation Committee, whose purpose was to stay in contact with all members who were unable to attend services (short and long-term) by phone, mail or personal visits.

Pineau, CMSgt USAF (Ret.) of Tallahassee FL died on 30 June 2020 after a long and courageous battle with Parkinsons disease. Born in Jamaica Plain (Boston, MA) on February 9, 1936, Kenneth Francis Pineau was the first-born to Agatha May Pineau (née Gallant) and Ignatius Angus Pineau - French-Canadians from North Rustico, P.E.I. who had become naturalized U.S. Citizens. North Rustico was the magical retreat where Kenny, his brother John and his sister Elaine, would spend entire childhood summers by the sea. Because of the preponderance of Pineaus and Gallants from that area, he was known locally as Kenny Getty Jack Douse (following the generational naming customs of the area). His fathers untimely electrocution as a repair lineman in the aftermath of the unnamed hurricane of September 1944 while working on Marthas Vineyard was a defining moment for eight-year-old Kenneth, who from that day forward checked his childhood and began working from fourth-grade (Blessed Sacrament Parochial School, Jamaica Plain) onward in order to help his widowed mother support the family. After graduating from Christopher Columbus High School (North End, Boston) in 1954, he began his first of thirty years in the USAF Air Weather Service. He served in many overseas assignments including France, the Congo, Vietnam, Spain and Germany. Less than one-third of his 30 years were served stateside (DC, MA, NJ). While he was stationed outside of Paris in the early 1960s, Marie-Françoise Duval (1938-2012) caught his attention and the two married in August 1964 - in advance of the October 1965 arrival of their first and only child (Daniel). The following year, Ken embarked on his one-year Vietnam tour in Phu Cat (RVN) and returned in late 67.The remaining years of the decade were based in Massachusetts - close to his mother. From 1970 onward, he continued to provide a great life for his family while stationed in Spain (Madrid) and Germany (Ramstein) before returning stateside and eventually retiring from the USAF in 1984. The new retiree enjoyed the easy-life for a few months before starting his 20-year career in Naples, FL - ultimately retiring as Collier Countys Emergency Management Director. His second retirement compelled him and Marie-Françoise to move out to Las Cruces, New Mexico where they would begin yet another chapter of their adventure. Lured by the idyllic year-round climate and fascinating geography - they planted roots and enjoyed what the region offered. After cancer swiftly took Marie-Françoise away in 2012, he moved to Tallahassee, FL where he could be close to his son and family. Again, he planted roots and became involved with the Tallahassee Parkinsons Awareness Choir as well as with Good Shepherd Catholic Church. He is survived by his son Daniel, his daughter-in-law Meredith, his grandchildren David Pineau, Sophie Pineau, Mirabella Trammell, Ava-Kay Trammell and Jack-Douglas Trammell, his brother John and sister-in-law Mary, his sister Elaine and brother-in-law Buddy. He enjoyed enduring friendships spanning decades and was truly loved and respected by those who knew him. Funeral Mass will be in Tallahassee at Good Shepherd Catholic Church at noon on Saturday 4 July 2020. Full military honors internment at Tallahassee National Cemetery is scheduled for 11AM on Monday, 6 July 2020.\n\nCarolyn Foster Coughran, Carol was born in Dallas TX to Alva Lee Foster and Francis Estelle Foster on December 15, 1945.

His passing left a distinct void in The Citadel Physics Department. Jim graduated from The Citadel in 1977 with a B.S. in Physics and earned an M.S. degree in Atmospheric Science from North Carolina State University in 1983. He served 20 years in the United States Air Force as a meteorologist working on advanced projects and as a crew member of the Typhoon Chasers. Upon his retirement, he served as a real estate salesman and real estate company owner in the Charleston Market, ending this career as the Operating Principal for Keller Williams Charleston.\n\nIn fall of 2014, Lt Col Near returned to The Citadel Physics Department as an Adjunct Professor  however, he had volunteered his time for the entire year prior, refusing to be paid. (Dr. Joel Berlinghieri finally convinced him that he could only continue working if he was paid as an adjunct.) To say that he made a positive difference in the department and in the delivery of courses to The Citadel cadets would be a major understatement of his impact. When he returned, The Citadel Physics Department was beginning to emphasize undergraduate research as part of its core mission. Lt Col Near leveraged his experience in applied research and his expertise in microelectronics, to make an immediate and forceful impact on departmental culture. His innovative work with electronics students and in the PHYS 101 class set a goal for each of our students to imagine applications for every topic addressed. He assumed leadership of the departments Weather Balloon project and guided two ambitious and successful projects on solar effects on cosmic rays in the stratosphere. He guided another student in completion of a project for the state climatologist office which studied the influences of the frost/freeze period in South Carolina and recently was participating in an ongoing project to gather tidal and environmental data from multiple sites along the Ashley River.\n\nMost recently, Lt Col Near demonstrated extraordinary generosity by providing The Citadel Foundation (TCF) with a $2.5M gift to initiate The Citadel Lowcountry Climate Center. Ever humble and not wanting to receive any recognition for his donation, he specified to TCF that his gift remain completely anonymous until his passing. Thus, without fanfare, he worked closely with Swain Family School of Science and Mathematics Dean, Dr. Darin Zimmerman and Physics Department Head, Dr. Joel Berlinghieri and many others, on the preliminary work to launch the Center. A portion of his gift established an endowed professorship in the department of physics, which will be renamed the Lt Col James B. Near, Jr Professorship in Physics, in his honor. The individual hired into this position will also serve as the inaugural director of The Citadel Lowcountry Climate Center.\n\nLt Col Nears passion for inspiring students to understand and practice science as an active and vibrant endeavor has given every one of the students he touched the confidence to harness their creativity and acquire the skills to do high-quality research. Through his time, talent, and treasure, he leaves an enviable legacy and will be remembered by the faculty, students, and friends of The Citadel for many generations to come.\n\nJohn P Priestle, SMSgt-Ret. USAF, passed away on February 29, 2020. He is predeceased by his parents, 8 siblings, and wife, Dorothy. John was born May 15, 1927, in Newport, Kentucky. He married Dorothy E. Connor from Cincinnati in 1952 and together they raised six children. John retired in San Antonio after serving 28 years with the USAF.

John graduated magna cum laude from SWTSU in 1980 with a degree in Criminal Justice. He worked with security at Hilton and completely retired in 1989, but continued to volunteer at WHMC on Lackland AFB and with the neighborhood Security Patrol. He and his wife were avid world travelers, cruising to nearly every continent.

In addition to a stable, loving, immaculate home, all four would receive the great gift of a love for reading and the time in which to do so. Her devoted commitment to her family saw her husband through years of night school and her children through college. When the children were grown, she became a loving and happy grandmother to eight grandchildren, proud of each as they grew up and pursued college and varied careers. At the time of her passing, she was great-grandmother to five young children. Rosalie was preceded in death by her husband, Duane; her sister, Virginia; and her brother, Hoyt.
