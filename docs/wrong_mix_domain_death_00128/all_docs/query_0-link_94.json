        "text": "My interest in music began at age seven, with my first toy piano which had only a couple octaves of keys. My parents said that I have a gift of music in that I started learning songs and pieces by ear and play them instantaneously. I could translate every sound I hear to a note on that toy piano… well, long as the limited octaves allowed. They enrolled me in private music tutorial sessions but stubbornly refused. So they let me take on a musical journey on my own terms, which was what happened in the next 26 years.\n\nI wrote my very first song when I was 10. Entitled “Two Hearts Against the World”, it’s a song I wrote for a person who treated me so much more than a third cousin. We dealt with the ups and downs of a cruel life at an early age together, and up to now that bond is still that strong.\n\nBoth my parents are music hobbyists but they are professional-grade performers. Mama’s a good lyric mezzo-soprano and Papa’s a brilliant classical guitar and piano player. Some of my second and third cousins also have profound musical talents. Among my favorites is my pretty third degree cousin Tiffani which, besides being a gorgeous model and career woman, is also a brilliant singer and songwriter.\n\nLove of one’s homeland is also one of the very inspiring ways one’s musical vocabulary can be forged. My Costa Rican roots play a large role on my music and influences. It inspired me to learn Son, Rhumba, Tango, Salasa, Bossa Nova, Calypso, Rock, Soca, Reggaeton, Hip hop, Pop, Cumbia, Merengue, Salsa, Bachata, Classical music, Tex-Mex, Guanacaste, Marimba music, Folklorico, Afro-Caribbean music, Metal Punk, Ska, Parrandera, Tambito, Waltz, Bolero, Gang, Chiquichiqui, Mento the run, and Callera. My dear homeland also explores Celtic music. Years later, it was during my studies in the Yamaha School of Music that I became proficient with broader genres. Orchestral, World, and Jazz music remained my personal favorites.\n\nAs the keyboard and piano became my instrument of choice, I joined numerous groups and performed in front of numerous people. I also became active in recording sessions in Manila. But as time passes and my craft improves, I later showed interest not just on the piano/keyboard sides of the music world...but on the whole picture. This led me to be a music arranger and orchestrator as well, writing and arranging for different instruments in different genres where appropriate.\n\nMy musical influences (colloquially “idols”) are as diverse as my musical vocabulary. Among my favorites are: • The classical masters, especially Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Bach, Mahler, Mozart, Ravel, Strauss, etc. • The Jazz masters: Bill Evans, Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, Marian Petrescu, Miles Davies, Count Basie, etc. • The bands of the 1990s. I’m talking about genuinely talented, classy, and well-mannered groups of that era. • Talented brother and sister teams like The Carpenters and Lea/Gerard Salonga.\n\nMy first public presentations were high school performances! (Ha-ha!) These included band competitions, proms, and special events. Even during boring times in class without our designated teachers around.\n\nMusic and I are virtually inseparable. This means that wherever I go, most notably somewhere very serene and inspiring, I almost always have a music notebook with me. Then I will leave that place with a handful of originals as my token of commemoration and gratitude of being a forever part of it. Being a performer also meant that I got to play on numerous local stints like regular evening gigs.\n\nDuring the early 2000, I got a chance to work with Rokstar’s Paul Sapiera (Parting Time, Mahal Pa Rin Kita), Vehnee Saturno, Polygram, and MCA Universal in his last solo album “I Remember the Day.”\n\nNow with my online music production website, my music is heard in different projects for clients in different countries. This is also a realization of a dream where I now get to work with people I look up to as my musical influences.\n\nBesides numerous “Best in Keyboards” awards during band competitions in my college preparatory days, some songs I personally written and was “lost” in the industry gained numerous awards. Knowing I have the power to write them on demand is more than a consolation for me.\n\nMusic can be non-lucrative for some artists in some places. While I may already reached the level of musicality I aimed for during the years, so many talented individuals are still in the struggle. If I have other dreams during my musical journey and before it ends…it will be to give those individuals support and guidance to be able to reach their and their music’s full potential. I’ve had wonderful and terrible experiences to be where I am now (and the terrible ones are still coming on a daily basis), but nothing can be more rewarding than to share the wonderful experiences with wonderful talents.\n\nThis is where I would like to share a letter made by a very brilliant composer/orchestrator I met online. His name is Alan Belkin, and his letter is aimed towards new, aspiring composers.\n\n“Composers naturally want to get played. Think about it, though: To get played, you don’t need other composers nearly as much as you need performers. The first performer who wants to play your music should be yourself. If you are a good performer, presumably you will play with other performers. Write for these people; it is much easier to get performers you work with interested in what you compose, than to ask favors from strangers. Take the opportunity to learn from them as well. If they like playing your piece, they will play it again. If they don’t, you need to think hard about why. Other composers can be helpful, indeed your own contemporaries can be valuable allies for arranging concerts, etc. But remember that they are also likely to see you as “competition”; there is some inevitable conflict of interest involved. This can be dealt with, but it requires a lot of judgment and tact. A word about critics: Once you are a professional, a really constructive critic is the most valuable resource you can find. But beware! Constructive criticism requires knowledge, sensitivity, and generosity. The vast majority of music critics are far from being knowledgeable enough to be of any use; worse, many have definite axes to grind, and can therefore be downright harmful. Money is a very legitimate issue: Being a composer of concert music is usually not a lucrative career. This is yet another reason to write only music you love. Possibly at some point, unless you are very lucky, you will have to decide what level of compromise is acceptable to you: Are you willing to write film music? Write music for ads? Would you rather teach, than write music which does not really excite you? It may even be better to earn your living outside of music, rather than spend your life not being able to write the music you love. Of course if your dream is to write, say, film music, then you are, in a sense, one of the lucky ones. It is still not easy, but if you do succeed, at least it can pay reasonably well. (Incidentally, film requires just as much or more “meatier”, given that it usually must be produced very quickly.) It’s also important to realize that success in a musical career is not the same as writing wonderful music. The former requires making contacts, finding ways to promote yourself, being a part of a musical environment. In other words, it is mainly a social skill. Writing wonderful music requires very different abilities; the two may or may not coincide. At least know what the real issues are. I realized this distinction much too late. As a result, I did not do much to promote my career when it would have had the most impact. There is nothing to be ashamed of in honestly promoting your own music, but you will need to learn to be socially adept, and to cultivate a very ambitiously entrepreneurial attitude. But these are big subjects in themselves, and I am not the best person to teach them.”-Alan Belkin\n\nWith this said, I believe It is probably crucial for aspiring songwriters to immediately be aware that being a composer may or may not be a path to prosperity, or even to pleasure (it’s no accident that so few famous composers were really wonderful, or happy people). To be successful in life requires astuteness – both of others and of oneself. There is no substitute for wisdom, in music or anywhere else. We have to be like water – it follows the shape of any container – in times it can be calm and serene, but it can also be violent and deadly. Versatility and the never-ending urge to learn will take you places."
