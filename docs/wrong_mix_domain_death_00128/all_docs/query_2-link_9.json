        "text": "Oscar Peterson (born August 15, 1925, Montreal, Quebec, Canada—died December 23, 2007, Mississauga, Ontario) was a Canadian jazz pianist best known for his dazzling solo technique.\n\nIn 1949 Peterson went to the United States, where he appeared in one of jazz promoter Norman Granz’s concerts at Carnegie Hall, New York City. He was associated with Granz for most of the rest of his career, touring the world with Granz’s all-star Jazz at the Philharmonic troupe and recording prolifically for Granz’s record labels. Art Tatum and especially Nat King Cole were important influences on Peterson’s style. Like Cole’s early trio, the Oscar Peterson Trio that first became popular featured piano, bass (Ray Brown), and guitar, most notably Herb Ellis (1953–58). When Ellis left the group, he was replaced by drummer Ed Thigpen (1959–65).\n\nCascades of many notes characterized Peterson’s playing. His earlier work, if often glib, was nevertheless invariably swinging. In the 1970s he began playing frequent solo concerts and duets, often with bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. These proved the most rewarding medium for his talents, and he became one of the most popular jazz pianists of his time. His 1974–75 duet albums with trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge, Harry Edison, Clark Terry, and Jon Faddis demonstrated generous warmth and sensitivity. His recordings won eight Grammy Awards. In 1999 he received the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for music."
