        "text": "Jazz Pianist and International Recording Artist BOY KATINDIG, comes from a well-known clan of musicians who pioneered Latin jazz in Manila. His father is Philippines' jazz legend/pianist/arranger Romy Katindig. In 1978, Boy signed up with A&W Records International and recorded several albums under the Horizon label. \" Midnight Lady\", his first album was awarded \"Best Instrumental Composition\" by the Himig Awards and Gold for the single which preceded it \"Don't Ask My Neighbor\". The album was released in the U.S. by PAUSA. \"Aftermidnight\" followed and then \"Love Fusion\", which Boy describes \"Horizon Record's signature jazz project\", the album garnered awards for \"Best Jazz Instrumental\" &\" Best Performance in a Jazz Composition\" for \"Its Still September\" from the Cecil Music Awards Foundation. His vocal composition, \"Capture The Changes\" featured in a single by Horizon was awarded \"Best Vocal Jazz Composition\". The \"Boy Katindig Band\" which spawned out of the 'Midnight Lady\" release, was also voted Best Jazz Group by the Aliw Awards Foundation consecutively for three years. \"In My Inner Fantasies\" featured his top selling double platinum vocal hit \"I Will Always Stay In Love This Way\". Consistent airplay plus a series of successful concerts throughout Manila and neighboring cities followed each album release, making Boy's name synonymous to contemporary jazz and as its main exponent from the Philippines. One significant event was a sold out concert with Japanese jazz harpist, Tadao Hayashi at the famous Araneta Coliseum. In 1986, after performances in Southeast Asia, the last of which was with Shakuhachi flutist John Kaizan Neptune at the Pyramid Theater in Kuala Lumpur, realizing the need for growth and international acceptance, Boy decided to move to the United States, the homeland of his craft. At that time, KKGO of Los Angeles and KBLX of San Francisco were two of the main jazz stations playing his albums. After concerts in both cities, in 1990, he produced and recorded his first U.S. album, together with L.A. jazz luminaries, Gerald Albright, Abraham Laboriel, Brandon Fields and Phil Upchurch to name a few. Boy's performances led him to Hawaii where he met saxophonist Michael Paulo, famous for his stints with Al Jarreau, Kalapana, James Ingram, Johnny Mathis, Kenny Loggins, Patti Austin and mutual friend, David Benoit. Michael, who was looking for artists for his record company, Noteworthy Records, took a notice of Boy's indie release \"Journey To Love\" and produced his self-titled CD release in 1995.\n\nRead more\n\nAfter its release, performances around Los Angeles followed with Boy joining the Michael Paulo Band featuring Seawind's Pauline Wilson. Most significant of these performances was at the Japan American Theater and at 94.7 The Wave Ala Carte, which featured artists like Branford Marsalis, Jeff Lorber, Tom Scott, Peter White and Rick Braun. His band in Hawaii,\" Boy Katindig & Friends\" in association with CD 101.9 Smooth Jazz of Hawaii, performed to packed and enthusiastic audiences in Oahu's premier nightspots. \"Puerto Princessa,\" a track from his Noteworthy release was featured in Jazziz Magazine's CD compilation for May 1995 together with Spyro Gyra's \"Lost and Found\", Joe Farrell's \"Mode for Joe\", Dori Caymmi's \"Irresistible\", Bill Evans' \"London House\" and Joe Lovano & Gunther Schuller's \"Rush Hour on 23rd Street. For the past 15 years, Boy Katindig has been based in Las Vegas and has made the rounds and headlined his own show rooms at the top casino and hotels at the Las Vegas Strip such as, The Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian, Mandalay Bay and Paris and is a regularly featured Artist at the yearly Jazz festivals by Oasis 105.7 and The Point 97.1 (Jazz At The Lake festivals). He also became the tour pianist/keyboardist of Peak recording Artist, Paul Taylor. He has established his own label, Kool Kat Productions, released his well-received smooth jazz CD, \"Groovin' High,\" garnering great reviews and regular airplay in the U.S. smooth jazz stations. Boy Katindig has been a household name in the smooth jazz scene since. In 2010, Boy was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Philippine Association of the Recording Industry at the 23rd Awit Awards in Manila. Since then, he has been dedicating some of his time performing and promoting contemporary jazz music around the Philippines. His latest achievement is the success of the first Boy Katindig Jazz Competition—the first songwriting and jazz band competition in the country.\n\nAwards\n\nAwit Awards Lifetime Achievement Award (Philippine Association of the Recording Industry) Double Platinum Record Award for \"I'll Always Stay In Love This Way\" (In My Inner Fantasies Album) 3-Time Best Jazz Group - The Boy Katindig Band (Aliw Awards Foundation) Best Vocal Composition for \"Capture The Changes\" (Aliw Awards Foundation) Best Jazz Instrumental and Best Performance in a Jazz Composition for \"It's Still September\" (Cecil Music Awards Foundation) Gold Record Award for \"Don't Asky My Neighbor\" (Midnight Lady Album) Best Instrumental Composition for \"Midnight Lady\" (Himig Awards)\n\nGear\n\nYamaha\n\nShow less"
