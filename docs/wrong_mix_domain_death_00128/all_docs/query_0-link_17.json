Francisco Santiago was a Filipino musician and composer born on January 29, 1889. He was known as the \"Father of Kundiman Art Song\" as he was the first to include the kundiman in a concert and write Philippine Christmas carols. He pursued piano studies despite poverty and earned several degrees in music, becoming the first Filipino to earn a Doctor of Music degree. Santiago composed many pieces that celebrated Filipino culture and folk music, helping raise the kundiman to the status of a national song. He died of a heart attack on September 28, 1947 while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music, where he was a professor and first Filipino director.",
