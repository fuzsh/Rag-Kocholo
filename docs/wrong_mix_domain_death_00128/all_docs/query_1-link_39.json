        "text": "Surrounded by the love of family and friends, Oscar Peter “Pete” Peterson Jr. peacefully passed away at Lawrence Memorial Hospital on March 30 at the age of 85. His life was filled with adventure, interests that helped others, and many friendships.\n\nAfter an early career at IBM, he graduated from Washburn Law School, Topeka, Kansas. He then practiced law 40 years in Kansas City.\n\nPete loved life, children, dogs, music, traveling, and, most of all, his large and diverse family.\n\nPete is survived by his wife, five siblings, seven children, and many grandchildren, all of whom will remember him as a good man, filled with patience, humor, affection, and wisdom.\n\nHis concern for community and humanity led him to service at Kiwanis, the Lied Center, First Presbyterian Church of Lawrence, and Habitat for Humanity. He believed in kindness to all and gratitude for life’s blessings.\n\nMemorials may be made to Lawrence Habitat for Humanity.\n\nPete will be interred at 3 p.m. Friday at Johnson County Funeral Chapel. A celebration of life/memorial service will be held later this spring."
