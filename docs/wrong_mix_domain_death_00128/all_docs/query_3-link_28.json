The New Generation Currency (NGC) Coin Series features the endemic flora of the Philippines: the kapa-kapa, tayabak, waling-waling, katmon, kapal-kapal baging, and mangkono whose varying characteristics of beauty, toughness, versatility, and adaptability run parallel to Filipinos’ resilience and grace under pressure, facing adversity head-on but with a smile, carrying on to greater heights, and never losing but letting that distinct Philippine identity shine through.

The funny thing is when you do the right things, there will be people who'll dislike you. But know that there are people who'll like working with you. There will be people who'll rally behind you. Some people see and understand what you are bringing to the table. When working, ask yourself \"What value am I adding here? How can I help fast-track the process? How can I help manage the timelines? How can I contribute to managing the company's resources better?\". You're not here to please everyone. You're here to do what must be done. And sometimes all you need is a little courage to be disliked. #growth #learninganddevelopment #quietgrowing 𝘋𝘪𝘴𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘳: 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘶𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘳'𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘥𝘰 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘭𝘺 𝘳𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘢𝘭 𝘱𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘺 𝘰𝘳 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘐 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗲𝘁.

The seeds break. The roots pierce the soil. The leaves multiply. The stem elongates. The branches fan out. Some bloom, some become hardy, some become majestic! All of this growth takes energy, and yes, plants do it quietly. 🌱You can and you may grow, quietly. #quietgrowing #growth #learninganddevelopment 𝘋𝘪𝘴𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘳: 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘶𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘳'𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘥𝘰 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘭𝘺 𝘳𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘢𝘭 𝘱𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘺 𝘰𝘳 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘐 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳.\n\n𝘙𝘪𝘻𝘢𝘭 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘓𝘶𝘯𝘦𝘵𝘢 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘈𝘭𝘭 ♿ 𝗙𝗥𝗘𝗘 𝗦𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿 to discuss Accessibility Law is happening this Saturday, July 20!
