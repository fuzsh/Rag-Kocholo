        "text": "Systematic review and meta-analysis of electrocautery versus scalpel for surgical skin incisions.\n\nPubMed\n\nAird, Lisa N F; Brown, Carl J\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe creation of surgical skin incisions has historically been performed using a cold scalpel. The use of electrocautery for this purpose has been controversial with respect to patient safety and surgical efficacy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to compare skin incisions made by electrocautery and a scalpel. A systematic electronic literature search was performed using 2 electronic databases (MEDLINE and PubMed), and the methodological quality of included publications was evaluated. Six RCTs were identified comparing electrocautery (n = 606) and a scalpel (n = 628) for skin incisions. No significant difference in wound infection rates or scar cosmesis was identified between the treatment groups. Electrocautery significantly reduced the incision time and postoperative wound pain. A trend toward less incisional blood loss from skin incisions made with electrocautery was noted. Electrocautery is a safe and effective method for performing surgical skin incisions.

To introduce the creation of subdartos muscle scrotal pouch with no scrotal skin incision. From one thousand and twenty-one children with hypospadias, 61 patients presented with concomitant palpable UDT and hypospadias. In group I (N = 34) single subcoronal incision with no scrotal skin incision was applied. In group II (N = 27), multi-incision technique was applied for classical orchiopexy and hypospadias surgery. For hypospadias reconstruction, all patients had classical subcoronal and para urethral plate incision with penile skin degloving according to the location of urethral meatus. Early and late complications, surgical time, hospital stay, and cosmetic results were recorded. Children with unilateral UDT and hypospadias had one incision in group I and three skin incisions in group II. Patients with bilateral UDT had one incision in group I and five skin incisions in group II. The operation time was significantly shorter in group I (93 Â± 11 min) compared with group II (138 Â± 17 min) (P = 0.03). Both groups were operated as day care basis; however, the hospital stay was slightly longer in group II (group I = 12 Â± 2 h, vs group II = 16 Â± 3 h) (P = 0.07). All testes were satisfactorily positioned into the bottom of the scrotum without development of any testicular atrophy. Single subcoronal penile skin incision is a feasible, safe, and cosmetically satisfactory technique in patients with hypospadias and concomitant UDT. Reduced postoperative pain, better objective cosmetic results, shorter operative time and comfortable post-operative period are the most significant advantages of this approach.

R.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nChanges in collagen in the wound during the healing process of guinea pig skin following surgical incisions and LTW was evaluated using in vivo, using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy provided information regarding the internal structure of the proteins. After the incisions were closed either by suturing or by LTW the ratio of the Raman peaks of the amide III (1247 cm-1) band to a peak at 1326 cm-1 used to evaluate the progression of collagen deposition. Histopathology was used as the gold standard. LTW skin demonstrated better healing than sutured skin, exhibiting minimal hyperkeratosis, minimal collagen deposition, near-normal surface contour, and minimal loss of dermal appendages. This work is important to plastic surgery.\n\nElectrocautery skin incision for neurosurgery procedures--technical note.\n\nPubMed\n\nNitta, Naoki; Fukami, Tadateru; Nozaki, Kazuhiko\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe reluctance to incise skin with electrocautery is partly attributable to concerns about excessive scarring and poor wound healing. However, recently no difference was reported in wound complications between the cold scalpel and electrocautery scalpel. We assessed the safety and efficacy of electrocautery skin incision in 22 scalp incisions, including 4 cases of reoperation. Electrocautery skin incisions were created using a sharp needle electrode. The generator unit was set on cutting mode, with power of 6 W and 330 kHz sinusoid waveform. Subcutaneous dissections also used the sharp needle electrode, set on coagulating mode, with power of 10 W and 1 MHz pulse-modulated waveform. Galea incisions used a standard blade tip, set on coagulating mode, with power of 20 W and 1 MHz pulse-modulated waveform. Skin incision with the sharp needle electrode caused no charring of the wound. Little bleeding or oozing were observed and skin clips were not necessary. No wound complication such as necrosis or infection occurred. Electrocautery skin incisions for re-operations were also performed safely without complications. Electrocautery skin incision is sufficiently safe procedure not only for first operation but also for re-operation. Electrocautery skin incision is efficacious, especially for extended operation times, because of little blood loss from the edges of skin incision and possible avoidance of skin edge necrosis or alopecia caused by skin clips.\n\nComparative study of wound healing in rat skin following incision with a novel picosecond infrared laser (PIRL) and different surgical modalities\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTavakoli, Fatemeh; Kruber, Sebastian; MÃ¼nscher, Adrian; Gliese, Alexandra; Hansen, NilsâOwe; Uschold, Stephanie; Eggert, Dennis; Robertson, Wesley D.; Gosau, Tobias; Sehner, Susanne; Kwiatkowski, Marcel; SchlÃ¼ter, Hartmut; Schumacher, Udo; Knecht, Rainald; Miller, R.J. Dwayne\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground and Objective As a result of wound healing the original tissue is replaced by dysfunctional scar tissue. Reduced tissue damage during surgical procedures beneficially affects the size of the resulting scar and overall healing time. Thus the choice of a particular surgical instrument can have a significant influence on the postoperative wound healing. To overcome these problems of wound healing we applied a novel picosecond infrared laser (PIRL) system to surgical incisions. Previous studies indicated that negligible thermal, acoustic, or ionization stress effects to the surrounding tissue results in a superior wound healing. Study Design/Materials and Methods Using the PIRL system as a surgical scalpel, we performed a prospective wound healing study on rat skin and assessed its final impact on scar formation compared to the electrosurgical device and cold steel. As for the incisions, 6 fullâthickness, 1âcm longâlinear skin wounds were created on the dorsum of four rats using the PIRL, an electrosurgical device, and a conventional surgical scalpel, respectively. Rats were euthanized after 21 days of wound healing. The thickness of the subepithelial fibrosis, the depth and the transverse section of the total scar area of each wound were analyzed histologically. Results After 21 days of wound healing the incisions made by PIRL showed minor scar tissue formation as compared to the electrosurgical device and the scalpel. Highly significant differences (Pâ<â0.001) were noted by comparing the electrosurgical device with PIRL and scalpel. The transverse section of the scar area also showed significant differences (Pâ=â0.043) when comparing PIRL (mean: 141.46âmm2; 95%CI: 105.8â189.0âmm2) with scalpel incisions (mean: 206.82âmm2; 95%CI: 154.8â276.32âmm2). The subepithelial width of the scars that resulted from using the scalpel were 1.3 times larger than those obtained by using the PIRL (95%CI: 1.0â1.6) though the difference was not\n\nIn vivo Molecular Evaluation of Guinea Pig Skin Incisions Healing after Surgical Suture and Laser Tissue Welding Using Raman Spectroscopy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlimova, A.; Chakraverty, R.; Muthukattil, R.; Elder, S.; Katz, A.; Sriramoju, V.; Lipper, Stanley; Alfano, R. R.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe healing process in guinea pig skin following surgical incisions was evaluated at the molecular level, in vivo, by the use of Raman spectroscopy. After the incisions were closed either by suturing or by laser tissue welding (LTW), differences in the respective Raman spectra were identified. The study determined that the ratio of the Raman peaks of the amide III (1247 cmâ1) band to a peak at 1326 cmâ1 (the superposition of elastin and keratin bands) can be used to evaluate the progression of wound healing. Conformational changes in the amide I band (1633 cmâ1 to 1682 cmâ1) and spectrum changes in the range of 1450 cmâ1 to 1520 cmâ1 were observed in LTW and sutured skin. The stages of the healing process of the guinea pig skin following LTW and suturing were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy, using histopathology as the gold standard. LTW skin demonstrated better healing than sutured skin, exhibiting minimal hyperkeratosis, minimal collagen deposition, near-normal surface contour, and minimal loss of dermal appendages. A wavelet decomposition-reconstruction baseline correction algorithm was employed to remove the fluorescence wing from the Raman spectra.

The goals of the current study were: (1) to define the optimal laser soldering conditions, (2) to explore the immediate skin reparative healing events after sealing the wound, and (3) to determine the long-term trajectory of skin wound healing. Skin incisions were generated over rabbit dorsa and were closed using different wound-closure interventions, in three groups: (a) closure, using a temperature-controlled infrared fiberoptic CO2 laser system, employing 47% bovine serum albumin as a solder; (b) wound closure by cyanoacrylate glues; and (c) wound closure by sutures. The reparative outcomes were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically, employing semi-quantitative grading indices. Laser soldering of incisions at T = 65 degrees C emerged as the optimal method achieving immediate wound sealing. This in turn induced accelerated reparative events characterized by a reduced inflammatory reaction, followed by minimal scarring and leading to a fine quality healing. Temperature-controlled laser soldering offers an accelerated wound reparative process with numerous advantages over the conventional methods. Further investigations may reveal additional benefits in the spectrum of advantages that this innovative surgical technology has to offer. This can introduce new scientific insight that will pave the way for clinical use.\n\nDisposable skin staplers for closure of linear gastrointestinal incisions in dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwartz, Zeev; Coolman, Bradley R\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo report the clinical features and outcomes of linear gastrointestinal incisions closed with skin staples in dogs. Historical cohort study. 333 client-owned dogs. Medical records from 1 private referral hospital were searched for dogs that underwent gastrointestinal surgery between November 1999 and October 2015. Cases were included if skin staplers were used to close linear gastrointestinal incisions. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was collected. Complications were diagnosed in 8 of 245 (3.27%) dogs, including 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs that died or were euthanized, 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs with incisional dehiscence, and 2 of 245 (0.81%) dogs with attachment of a linear foreign body to the staples at the intestinal lumen. Dehiscence was noted at the enterotomy sites in 3 dogs at a mean time of 44 hours after surgery (SDâÂ±â6.93). Two dogs presented with another linear foreign body that was attached to the staples in the intestinal lumen at postoperative days 24 and 42. The risk factors associated with incisional dehiscence included multiple gastrointestinal incisions performed in 1 surgery (Ï 2 , P < .001) and the presence of a linear foreign body (Ï 2 , P = .02253). No associations were detected between dogs' age, sex, weight, surgery time, indication for surgical intervention, surgery location in the gastrointestinal tract, or surgeon experience and incisional dehiscence. Skin staplers provide safe and effective closure of gastrotomies, enterotomies, and colonotomies in dogs. This method is reliable, efficient, and affordable in the hands of veterinary surgeons with varying skill levels.

Closure of wounds with sutures enables meticulous closure, but sutures may induce tissue reactivity and they usually require removal. Tissue adhesives offer the advantages there are no sutures to remove later for the patient and no risk of needlestick injury to the surgeon. Tissue adhesives have been used primarily in emergency rooms but this review looks at the use of tissue adhesives in the operating room where surgeons are increasingly using these for the closure of surgical skin incisions. To determine the relative effects of various tissue adhesives and conventional skin closure techniques on the healing of surgical wounds. The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Bibliographies of review articles were checked for studies outside the handsearched journals and wound care product manufacturers were contacted. Randomised controlled clinical trials only. Screening of eligible studies and data extraction was conducted independently and in triplicate whilst assessment of the methodological quality of the trials was conducted independently and in duplicate. Results were expressed as random effect models using weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. Heterogeneity was investigated including both clinical and methodological factors. Eight RCTs were included (630 patients). No statistically significant differences were found between various tissue adhesives and sutures (8 trials) for dehiscence, infection, satisfaction with cosmetic appearance when assessed by patients' or surgeons' general satisfaction. Nor were differences found between a tissue adhesive and tapes (2 trials) for infection, patients' assessment of cosmetic\n\nS-shaped versus conventional straight skin incision: Impact on primary functional maturation, stenosis and thrombosis of autogenous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula: Impact of incision on maturation, stenosis & failure of RCAVF. Study design: Prospective observational comparative.\n\nPubMed\n\nKordzadeh, Ali; Panayiotopolous, Yiannis\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to test the null hypothesis that an S-shaped surgical incision versus conventional (straight) skin incision in the creation of autogenous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RCAVFs) have no impact on the primary end-point of primary functional maturation and secondary end points of stenosis and thrombosis. A prospective observational comparative consecutive study with intention-to-treat on individuals undergoing only radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVFs) over a period of 12 months was conducted. Variables on patient's demographics, comorbidities, anesthesia type, mean arterial blood pressure, thrill, laterality, cephalic vein and radial artery diameter were collated. The test of probability was assessed through Chi-Square, Kaplan-Meier survival estimator and Log-Rank analysis. Total of nÂ =Â 83 individuals with median age of 67 years (IQR, 20-89) and male predominance 83% during this period were subjected to RCAVF formation. Total of nÂ =Â 45 patients in straight skin incision were compared to nÂ =Â 38 individuals in S-shaped group. Despite equal prevalence of demographics, comorbidities, anesthesia type, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), thrill, laterality, cephalic vein and radial artery diameter ( p Â >Â 0.05) higher incidence of juxta-anastomotic stenosis was noted in the straight skin incision group ( p Â =Â 0.029) in comparative and survival analysis (Log-Rank, p Â =Â 0.036). The maturation of the entire cohort was 69% (S-shaped 76% vs. straight group 62%) (pÂ >Â 0.05). The outcome of this study demonstrates that S-shaped surgical skin incision is associated with a lower incidence of stenosis in comparison to straight incision type in RCAVF formation.\n\nSurgical robot for single-incision laparoscopic surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Hyundo; Kwak, Ho-Seong; Lim, Yo-An; Kim, Hyung-Joo\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThis paper introduces a novel surgical robot for single-incision laparoscopic surgeries. The robot system includes the cone-type remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism and two articulated instruments having a flexible linkage-driven elbow. The RCM mechanism, which has two revolute joints and one prismatic joint, is designed to maintain a stationary point at the apex of the cone shape. By placing the stationary point on the incision area, the mechanism allows a surgical instrument to explore the abdominal area through a small incision point. The instruments have six articulated joints, including an elbow pitch joint, which make the triangulation position for the surgery possible inside of the abdominal area. The presented elbow pitch structure is similar to the slider-crank mechanism but the connecting rod is composed of a flexible leaf spring for high payload and small looseness error. We verified the payload of the robot is more than 10 N and described preliminary experiments on peg transfer and suture motion by using the proposed surgical robot.\n\nEvaluation of four suture materials for surgical incision closure in Siberian sturgeon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBoone, S. Shaun; Hernandez, Sonia M.; Camus, Alvin C.; Peterson, Douglas C.; Jennings, Cecil A.; Shelton, James L.; Divers, Stephen J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe visual and microscopic tissue reactions to the absorbable monofilament Monocryl, absorbable monofilament triclosan-coated Monocryl-Plus, absorbable multifilament Vicryl, and nonabsorbable monofilament Prolene were evaluated for their use of surgical closure in Siberian SturgeonÂ Acipenser baerii. Postoperative assessments were conducted at 1, 2, 8, 12, and 26 and 55 weeks to visually evaluate the surgical incision for suture retention, incision healing, erythema, and swelling. Incisions were also assessed microscopically at 1, 2, and 8 weeks for necrosis, inflammation, hemorrhage, and fibroplasia. The results indicated that incisions closed with either Vicryl or Prolene suture materials were more likely to exhibit more erythema or incomplete healing compared with those closed with Monocryl or Monocryl-Plus. The surgical implantation of a transmitter in the coelomic cavity did not significantly affect the response variables among the four suture materials. Monocryl or Monocryl-Plus were equally effective and superior to other suture materials used for closing surgical incisions in Siberian Sturgeon or closely related species of sturgeon. Furthermore, Monocryl or Monocryl-Plus may decrease the risk of transmitter expulsion through the incision, as surgical wounds appear to heal faster and exhibit less erythema compared with those closed with Vicryl.\n\nComparison of surgically induced astigmatism in various incisions in manual small incision cataract surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nJauhari, Nidhi; Chopra, Deepak; Chaurasia, Rajan Kumar; Agarwal, Ashutosh\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo determine the surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) in Straight, Frown and Inverted V shape (Chevron) incisions in manual small incision cataract surgery (SICS). A prospective cross sectional study was done on a total of 75 patients aged 40y and above with senile cataract. The patients were randomly divided into three groups (25 each). Each group received a particular type of incision (Straight, Frown or Inverted V shape incisions). Manual SICS with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed. The patients were compared 4wk post operatively for uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and SIA. All calculations were performed using the SIA calculator version 2.1, a free software program. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 15.0 statistical analysis software. The study found that 89.5% of patients in Straight incision group, 94.2% in Frown incision group and 95.7% in Inverted V group attained BCVA post-operatively in the range of 6/6 to 6/18. Mean SIA was minimum (-0.88Â±0.61DÃ90 degrees) with Inverted V incision which was statistically significant. Inverted V (Chevron) incision gives minimal SIA.\n\nDe Qeurvian Tenosynovitis: Clinical Outcomes of Surgical Treatment with Longitudinal and Transverse Incision\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbrisham, Syyed Jalil; Karbasi, Mohammad Hosein Akhavan; Zare, Jalil; Behnamfar, Zahra; Tafti, Arefah Dehghani; Shishesaz, Behzad\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjectives De Quervain disease is a mechanical tenosynovitis due to inadequacy volume between abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis and their tunnel. Treatment methods include immobilization, steroid injections, and operation. For the first time Fritz De Quervain described surgical treatment of this disease. Since then, various ways of treatment have been reported. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of a longitudinal incision with a transverse incision in De Quervain disease. Methods This was a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in three hospitals in Iran, Yazd from March 2003 to September 2008. One hundred-twenty patients with De Quervain disease who did not respond to conservative treatment were operated with two different incisions. The patients were followed for three months to compare the surgical outcomes. Results During a three month follow-up, a significant difference was shown between the two methods (p=0.03). Results of surgical treatment with longitudinal incision were excellent (only 5 hypertrophic scars), but there were 13 postoperative complaints with transverse incision. Conclusion According to our findings, longitudinal incision in surgical treatment of De Quervain disease is better than transverse incision.

Posterior cartilage-sparing techniques for otoplasty have been shown to be consistently safer and better than cartilage-scoring alternatives, however excision of the posterior auricular skin during otoplasty, although a common first step, has not been shown to have any benefits over skin incision alone. In this study, we examined the association between skin excision and recurrence of ear prominence, by examining the collective surgical outcomes of five plastic surgeons, performing 118 otoplasties at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children Edinburgh, between January 2011 and December 2013. Recurrence of prominence at the first follow-up appointment (mean follow-up 3.4 months) was 10.2%. Surgeons with low case volumes had significantly higher recurrence rates than high volume operators. There was no statistically significant association between skin excision and recurrence of prominence. We still favour posterior, cartilage-sparing otoplasties, but based on our findings we do not advocate any skin excision at any stage of the procedure. Surgeons should not include paediatric otoplasty in their portfolio unless they are undertaking significant number of cases each year.

Report of 27 cases and a literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorrego, Leopoldo; HernÃ¡ndez, Noelia; HernÃ¡ndez, Zaida; PeÃ±ate, Yeray\n\n2016-05-01\n\nPovidone-iodine solution is an antiseptic that is used worldwide as surgical paint and is considered to have a low irritant potential. Post-surgical severe irritant dermatitis has been described after the misuse of this antiseptic in the surgical setting. Between January 2011 and June 2013, 27 consecutive patients with post-surgical contact dermatitis localized outside of the surgical incision area were evaluated. Thirteen patients were also available for patch testing. All patients developed dermatitis the day after the surgical procedure. Povidone-iodine solution was the only liquid in contact with the skin of our patients. Most typical lesions were distributed in a double lumbar parallel pattern, but they were also found in a random pattern or in areas where a protective pad or an occlusive medical device was glued to the skin. The patch test results with povidone-iodine were negative. Povidone-iodine-induced post-surgical dermatitis may be a severe complication after prolonged surgical procedures. As stated in the literature and based on the observation that povidone-iodine-induced contact irritant dermatitis occurred in areas of pooling or occlusion, we speculate that povidone-iodine together with occlusion were the causes of the dermatitis epidemic that occurred in our surgical setting. Povidone-iodine dermatitis is a problem that is easily preventable through the implementation of minimal routine changes to adequately dry the solution in contact with the skin.

Patients were block randomised to the single (n=92) or double (n=92) blade technique. Blades were sent for bacteriological analysis. Outcome measures were early surgical site infection (SSI) within 30 days and cultures from the blades. The 2 groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. In the single blade group, 6 surgical blades and 2 control blades showed positive cultures; 4 patients developed SSI, but only one had a positive culture from the surgical blade (with different organism isolated from the wound culture). In the double blade group, 6 skin blades, 7 deep blades, and 0 control blade showed positive culture; only 2 patients had the same bacteria grown from both skin and deep blade. Five patients developed SSI, but only one patient had a positive culture from the deep blade (with different organism isolated from the wound culture). The difference in incidence of culture-positive blade or SSI between the 2 groups was not significant. The relative risk of SSI in the single blade group was 0.8. Positive blade culture was not associated with SSI in the single or double blade group. The practice of changing blade following skin incision has no effect on reducing early SSI in surgery for closed fracture in healthy patients with healthy skin.\n\nTissue adhesives for closure of surgical incisions.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoulthard, Paul; Esposito, Marco; Worthington, Helen V; van der Elst, Maarten; van Waes, Oscar J F; Darcey, James\n\n2010-05-12\n\nSutures, staples and adhesive tapes are the traditional methods of wound closure, whilst tissue adhesives have entered clinical practice more recently.

As most patients with a pressure ulcer suffer from systemic comorbidities, invasive surgery cannot be performed on all patients, and less invasive treatment is required. Less invasive surgical intervention to a deep pressure ulcer, parallel pocket incision (PPI), was performed on 10 patients with intractable pressure ulcers with a pocket formation. In PPI procedures, two parallel skin incisions were made to open up the deepest fold of the pocket and to preserve the skin overlying the pocket lesion; through the created incisions, the necrotic tissues around the deepest fold of the undermining could be easily removed, which facilitated spontaneous wound healing. Postoperative results and complications were evaluated. All PPI procedures were safely performed under local infiltration anesthesia without major postoperative complication; minor bleeding was seen intraoperatively in three patients, which could be easily controlled with electric cautery coagulation. Nine of 10 ulcers were cured after PPI, and one could not be followed up due to the patient's death non-related to the pressure ulcer. For the nine cured patients, the average time for cure was 14.9 weeks, and no recurrence was observed at postoperative 6 months. PPI is a simple, technically easy, and less invasive surgical intervention to an intractable pressure ulcer with a pocket, which can be safely performed under local infiltration anesthesia even on a patient with severe systemic comorbidities.

In rodents, skin-only incisions induce mechanical and heat hypersensitivity similar to levels observed with skin plus deep incisions. Therefore, cutaneous injury might drive the majority of postoperative pain. TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels are known to mediate inflammatory and nerve injury pain, making them key targets for pain therapeutics. These channels are also expressed extensively in cutaneous nerve fibers. Therefore, we investigated whether TRPA1 and TRPV1 contribute to mechanical and heat hypersensitivity following skin-only surgical incision. Results Behavioral responses to mechanical and heat stimulation were compared between skin-incised and uninjured, sham control groups. Elevated mechanical responsiveness occurred 1 day post skin-incision regardless of genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPA1. To determine whether functional changes in TRPA1 occur at the level of sensory neuron somata, we evaluated cytoplasmic calcium changes in sensory neurons isolated from ipsilateral lumbar 3â5 DRGs of skin-only incised and sham wild type (WT) mice during stimulation with the TRPA1 agonist cinnamaldehyde. There were no changes in the percentage of neurons responding to cinnamaldehyde or in their response amplitudes. Likewise, the subpopulation of DRG somata retrogradely labeled specifically from the incised region of the plantar hind paw showed no functional up-regulation of TRPA1 after skin-only incision. Next, we conducted behavior tests for heat sensitivity and found that heat hypersensitivity peaked at day 1 post skin-only incision. Skin incision-induced heat hypersensitivity was significantly decreased in TRPV1-deficient mice. In addition, we conducted calcium imaging with the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. DRG neurons from WT mice exhibited sensitization to TRPV1 activation, as more neurons (66%) from skin-incised mice responded to capsaicin compared to controls (46%), and the\n\nPlasma concentrations of lidocaine in dogs following lidocaine patch application over an incision compared to intact skin.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoudrey, S D; Robinson, D A; Kearney, M T; Papich, M G; da Cunha, A F\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe objective was to compare plasma lidocaine concentrations when a commercially available 5% lidocaine patch was placed on intact skin vs. an incision. Our hypothesis was that greater absorption of lidocaine would occur from the incision site compared to intact skin. Ten dogs were used in a crossover design. A patch was placed over an incision, and then after a washout period, a patch was placed over intact skin. Plasma lidocaine concentrations were measured at patch placement; 20, 40 and 60Â min; and 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96Â h after patch placement. After patch removal, the skin was graded using a subjective skin reaction system. No dogs required rescue analgesia, and no toxicity or skin reaction was noted. MeanÂ Â±Â SD AUC and CMAX were 3054.29Â Â±Â 1095.93Â ngÂ·h/mL and 54.1Â Â±Â 15.84Â ng/mL in the Incision Group, and 2269.9Â Â±Â 1037.08Â ngÂ·h/mL and 44.5Â Â±Â 16.34Â ng/mL in the No-Incision Group, respectively. The AUC was significantly higher in the Incision Group. The results of the study demonstrate that the actual body exposure to lidocaine was significantly higher when an incision was present compared to intact skin. No adverse effects were observed from either treatment. Efficacy was not evaluated.

Extension of the transverse mini-incision wound was necessary in 3 patients (5%). Both groups were largely equivalent in terms of demographic, clinicopathological, and surgical factors and frequency of postoperative complications. Postoperative analgesic was significantly less (P = 0.04) and postoperative length of the hospital stay was significantly shorter (P < 0.01) in the transverse mini-incision group. Concerning a mini-incision approach for locally advanced colonic cancer, a transverse incision seems to be advantageous with regard to minimal invasiveness and early recovery compared with a longitudinal incision.

Electrosurgical devices using pulsed radiofrequency energy and a novel electrode design markedly reduce thermal injury during cutting and coagulation while maintaining equal surgical performance. In this study, we examine fascial healing dynamics in a rat model following incision with a pulsed radiofrequency energy device (PRE), a conventional electrosurgical device, and a standard \"cold\" scalpel. We hypothesize that incisions made with the pulsed radiofrequency energy device will result in a superior fascial healing profile compared with conventional electrosurgery. Full thickness surgical incisions were created in rat fascia using a commercially available PRE device, conventional electrosurgery, and a scalpel. Harvested fascial specimens were analyzed for burst strength testing and healing-associated histologic characteristics at d 7, 14, 21, and 42. PRE incisions were fully healed by 6 wk with normal tissue architecture. By all measures, wounds created by the PRE device were comparable to those made with the standard scalpel. Compared with PRE, conventional electrosurgery incisions exhibited a larger zone of tissue injury (68% greater in Coag mode, P < 0.0001; 46% greater in Cut mode, P < 0.001), an increased inflammatory response and a less favorable wound architecture. In the immediate postoperative period (1 wk), burst strength testing demonstrated that PRE fascial wounds were significantly stronger than those made by electrosurgery in Coag mode (318%, P = 0.001). The favorable fascial healing profile of the PRE device suggests that it is a promising new surgical technology. The early improved strength of wounds made with this device is of particular interest, as wound dehiscence is of greatest concern early in the healing process.

A skin incision in the cheek carries with it possible undesirable sequelae, such as noticeable scarring. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is scarring in the face after this technique. For screw insertion, a 5-mm stab incision was performed on 40 Japanese patients (20 men and 20 women) with class III occlusion. After surgery, gross examination (via the naked eyes) of the skin incision was performed monthly for 1 year by the same oral surgeon. In all cases, the skin incision had disappeared by 1 year after the surgery.\n\nImmediate tight sealing of skin incisions using an innovative temperature-controlled laser soldering device: in vivo study in porcine skin.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimhon, David; Halpern, Marisa; Brosh, Tamar; Vasilyev, Tamar; Ravid, Avi; Tennenbaum, Tamar; Nevo, Zvi; Katzir, Abraham\n\n2007-02-01\n\nA feedback temperature-controlled laser soldering system (TCLS) was used for bonding skin incisions on the backs of pigs. The study was aimed: 1) to characterize the optimal soldering parameters, and 2) to compare the immediate and long-term wound healing outcomes with other wound closure modalities. A TCLS was used to bond the approximated wound margins of skin incisions on porcine backs. The reparative outcomes were evaluated macroscopically, microscopically, and immunohistochemically. The optimal soldering temperature was found to be 65 degrees C and the operating time was significantly shorter than with suturing. The immediate tight sealing of the wound by the TCLS contributed to rapid, high quality wound healing in comparison to Dermabond or Histoacryl cyanoacrylate glues or standard suturing. TCLS of incisions in porcine skin has numerous advantages, including rapid procedure and high quality reparative outcomes, over the common standard wound closure procedures. Further studies with a variety of skin lesions are needed before advocating this technique for clinical use.\n\nClosure of skin incision by dual wavelength (980 and 1064 nm) laser application.\n\nPubMed\n\nUba, Abdullahi Ibrahim; Tabakoglu, HaÅim Ozgur; Abdullahi, Umar Aliyu; Sani, Musbahu Muhammad\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThermal effect of dual wavelength (980 and 1064 nm) laser application in skin incision closure was assessed on 18 male and female Wister rats. 1-cm-long incisions were made on the shaved dorsal region of 220-250 g animals. The incisions were closed by laser irradiation at 1 W and exposure time, 5 seconds in continuous-wave mode (CW) and 1 W and exposure time, 10 seconds in pulsed mode to deliver total energies of 5 J and 10 J per spot onto the incisions, respectively. Animals from each group were sacrificed at 0th, 4th, and 7th days and the skin samples of the weld area were excised for histological analysis using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) stain. Mean thermally altered area (TAA) of CW-mode laser-treated groups was found to increase significantly (p < 0.05) compared with pulsed mode laser treated group at 0th and 4th days post-irradiation while no significant difference (p > 0.05) was statistically found at 7th day post-irradiation. Moreover, tighter closure was observed with CW group at 7th day post-irradiation. We thus conclude that 1 W, 5 J for 5 seconds CW mode laser application of 980 and 1064 nm combined beam form in skin incision closure was found to have absolute wound healing capability with minimal thermal alteration.\n\nCutting electrocautery versus scalpel for surgical incisions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIsmail, Ammar; Abushouk, Abdelrahman Ibrahim; Elmaraezy, Ahmed; Menshawy, Amr; Menshawy, Esraa; Ismail, Mahmoud; Samir, Esraa; Khaled, Anas; Zakarya, Hagar; El-Tonoby, Abdelrahman; Ghanem, Esraa\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAlthough cutting electrocautery can be superior to the scalpel in reducing blood loss and incisional time, several reports associated electrocautery with higher rates of wound infection, impaired healing, and worse cosmesis. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare cutting electrocautery versus scalpel for surgical incisions. We conducted a computerized literature search of five electronic databases and included all published original studies comparing cutting electrocautery and scalpel surgical incisions. Relevant data were extracted from eligible studies and pooled as odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean difference (SMD) values in a meta-analysis model, using RevMan and Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Forty-one studies (36 randomized trials, four observational, and one quasirandom study) were included in the pooled analysis (6422 participants). Compared with the scalpel incision, cutting electrocautery resulted in significantly less blood loss (SMDÂ =Â -1.16, 95% CI [-1.60 to -0.72]), shorter incisional (SMDÂ =Â -0.63, 95% CI [-0.96 to -0.29]) and operative times (SMDÂ =Â -0.59, 95% CI [-1.12 to -0.05]), and lower pain scores (SMDÂ =Â -0.91, 95% CI [-1.27 to -0.55]) with no significant differences in terms of wound infection rates (ORÂ =Â 0.92, 95% CI [0.74-1.15]) or overall subjective scar score (SMDÂ =Â -0.49, 95% CI [-1.72 to 0.75]). Surgical incision using electrocautery can be quicker with less blood loss and postoperative pain scores than the scalpel incision. No statistically significant difference was found between both techniques in terms of postoperative wound complications, hospital stay duration, and wound cosmetic characteristics. Therefore, we recommend routine use of cutting electrocautery for surgical incisions. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We reviewed our cases that underwent upper extremity surgery using only ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block in our hospital between 2011 and 2016. Adverse events during surgery were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to investigate the relationship between the time from the end of the block procedure to skin incision and the use of local anesthesia on the surgical site. There were 255 patients who were divided into three groups according to the anesthetic agents used: group 1, 1% lidocaine (L) 10Â mlÂ +Â 0.75% ropivacaine (R) 20Â ml (nÂ =Â 62); group 2, L 20Â mlÂ +Â R 10Â ml (nÂ =Â 93); and group 3, L 10Â mlÂ +Â R 15Â ml (nÂ =Â 100). The rate of use of local anesthesia on the surgical site was significantly higher in group 3 than in the other two groups. There were no significant differences in the other evaluated items among the three groups. ROC curve analysis indicated that â¥24Â min from the end of the block procedure to skin incision might reduce the use of local anesthesia. The total volume of anesthetic agents had an important influence on the rate of the addition of local anesthesia for surgical pain; however, the combined dose of agents did not influence the evaluation items. For effective analgesia, â¥24Â min should elapse from the end of the block procedure to skin incision. Copyright Â© 2017.

Our objective was to determine whether high transverse skin incisions are associated with a reduced risk of cesarean wound complications in women with BMI greater than 40. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken of parturients ages 18-45 with BMI greater than 40 having high transverse skin incisions from January 2010 to April 2015 at a tertiary maternity hospital. Temporally matched controls had low transverse skin incisions along with a BMI greater than 40. The primary outcome, wound complication, was defined as any seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, or infection requiring opening and evacuating/debriding the wound. Secondary outcomes included rates of endometritis, number of hospital days, NICU admission, Apgar scores, birth weight, and gestational age at delivery. Analysis of outcomes was performed using two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Thirty-two women had high transverse incisions and were temporally matched with 96 controls (low transverse incisions). The mean BMI was 49 for both groups. There was a trend toward reduced wound complications in those having high transverse skin incisions, but this did not reach statistical significance (15.63% versus 27.08%, pâ=â.2379). Those having high transverse skin incisions had lower five minute median Apgar scores (8.0 versus 9.0, pâ=â.0021), but no difference in umbilical artery pH values. The high transverse group also had increased NICU admissions (28.13% versus 5.21%, pâ=â.0011), and early gestational age at delivery (36.8 versus 38.0, pâ=â.0272). High transverse skin incisions may reduce the risk of wound complications in parturients with obesity. A study with more power should be considered.\n\nStandardized technique for single-incision laparoscopic-assisted stoma creation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyoshi, Norikatsu; Fujino, Shiki; Ohue, Masayuki; Yasui, Masayoshi; Noura, Shingo; Wada, Yuma; Kimura, Ryuichiro; Sugimura, Keijiro; Tomokuni, Akira; Akita, Hirofumi; Kobayashi, Shogo; Takahashi, Hidenori; Omori, Takeshi; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki; Yano, Masahiko\n\n2016-08-10\n\nTo describe the procedure, efficacy, and utility of single-incision laparoscopic-assisted stoma creation (SILStoma) for transverse colostomy. Using single-incision laparoscopic surgery, we developed a standardized technique for SILStoma. Twelve consecutive patients underwent SILStoma for transverse colostomy at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases from April 2013 to March 2016. A single, intended stoma site was created with a 2.5-3.5 cm skin incision for primary access to the intra-abdominal space, and it functioned as the main port through which multi-trocars were placed. Clinical and operative factors and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Patient demographics, including age, gender, body mass index, and surgical indications for intestinal diversion were evaluated. SILStoma was performed in nine cases without the requirement of additional ports. In the remaining three cases, 1-2 additional 5-mm ports were required for mobilization of the transverse colon and safe dissection of abdominal adhesions. No cases required conversion to open surgery. In all cases, SILStoma was completed at the initial stoma site marked preoperatively. No intraoperative or postoperative complications greater than Grade II (the Clavien-Dindo classification) were reported in the complication survey. Surgical site infection at stoma sites was observed in four cases; however, surgical interventions were not required and all infections were cured completely. In all cases, the resumption of bowel movements was observed between postoperative days 1 and 2. SILStoma for transverse loop colostomy represents a feasible surgical procedure that allows the creation of a stoma at the preoperatively marked site without any additional large skin incisions.\n\nSingle-incision approach improves wound healing and bone union for treating mid-to-lower segment of tibiofibular fracture.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yongguang; Zhuang, Yuehong; Wang, Benhai; Xu, Hao; Chen, Jinshui; Lin, Songqing\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe mid-to-lower segment of tibiofibular fractures (MLTFs) is commonly encountered in clinical practice, which is conventionally treated by the double-incision surgical approach. However, the double-incision approach frequently makes the closure of the wound extremely difficult and sometimes results in necrosis of skin around fractured sites. In the present study, our experience of using a single-incision surgical approach for treating MLTF was exhibited. From February 2005 to December 2013, the clinical outcomes of 212 patients with MLTFs who underwent either double-incision approach or single-incision approach were retrospectively evaluated and compared. Both groups were similar with respect to injury mechanism and all patients were followed up with the efficacies of treatment evaluated by Johner-Wruth criteria. The results demonstrated that the effective rate and the rate of excellent and good efficacy in the single-incision group were significantly higher than those in the double-incision group (P<0.05). In addition, the rates of skin wound healing and bone union after surgery in the single-incision group were significantly higher than those in the double-incision group (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the single-incision surgical approach, which holds the advantages of being milder in trauma, fewer in complications and better in function restoration, might be used as an alternative method for treating MLTFs.\n\nImmediate Tight Sealing of Skin Incisions Using an Innovative Temperature-controlled Laser Soldering Device\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSimhon, David; Halpern, Marisa; Brosh, Tamar; Vasilyev, Tamar; Ravid, Avi; Tennenbaum, Tamar; Nevo, Zvi; Katzir, Abraham\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground: A feedback temperature-controlled laser soldering system (TCLS) was used for bonding skin incisions on the backs of pigs.

Andrew; Hayden, Todd A.; Krueger, Charles C.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags has become a common method in fishery research, but rarely are fish examined by scientists after release to understand the extent that surgical incisions have healed. Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a valuable, highly exploited fishery resource in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, fishery capture of walleye with internal acoustic transmitters combined with a high reward program provided multiple opportunities to examine photographs and quantify the status of surgical incisions. Walleye (n = 926) from reef and river spawning populations in Lake Erie and Lake Huron were implanted with acoustic transmitters during spring spawning events from 2011 to 2016. Incisions were closed with polydioxanone monofilament using two to three interrupted sutures. Out of 276 recaptured fish, 60 incision sites were clearly visible in photographs, and these were scored by two independent readers for incision closure, inflammation, and the presence of sutures.Results While incision sites were completely closed by 61 days post-release (95% CI 44â94), sutures remained for up to 866 days. Sutures were expelled serially during a protracted period, and the probability of observing at least one suture in a recaptured fish declined below 50% after 673 days (95% CI 442â1016). Inflammation at the incision increased during the first 71 days and then declined monotonically, remaining detectable at low levels.Conclusion Our results emphasized that sutures remained in free-ranging fish past the time when they were beneficial for incision healing. Most dissolvable sutures have been designed for use in endotherms where the body temperature and internal milieu differ dramatically from the conditions experienced by fishes in temperate climates. Identification of new suture materials for fish that facilitate healing while absorbing or dissolving in a reasonable period (e.g., a few weeks to three months) in colder temperatures (e.g., <12 Â°C) would\n\n[Expression of FAP and alpha-SMA during the incised wound healing in mice skin].\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Yang; Peng, Xue; Jin, Zhan-Fen; Fu, Zhi-Jun\n\n2009-12-01\n\nOBJECTIVE To investigate the time-dependent expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and alpha-smooth muscle actin(alpha-SMA) during the incised wound healing of the skin in mice. The expression of FAP and alpha-SMA in incised wound of mice skin was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. By immunohistochemistry, the expression of FAP and alpha-SMA in the normal skin and the skin 1 h after injury maintained at a very low level, but the positive cells expressing FAP and alpha-SMA started to elevate 6 h after injury and reached its peak on 5 d for FAP and on 3 d for alpha-SMA, then gradually decreased to the normal level on 14 d. The expression of FAP and alpha-SMA was observed throughout the wound healing stages 1 d after injuries by Western blot as well with a peak expression occurring on 5 d for FAP and on 3 d for alpha-SMA after injury. FAP may be a potentially useful marker for wound age determination and alpha-SMA may be used as an effective indicator for the mid- and late stage incised wound of mice skin. The combination use of FAP and alpha-SMA may be potentially effective indicators for wound age determination.\n\nCold Plasma Welding System for Surgical Skin Closure: In Vivo Porcine Feasibility Assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarats, Moti; Lam, Amnon; Maller, Michael; Kornhaber, Rachel; Haik, Josef\n\n2016-09-29\n\nCold plasma skin welding is a novel technology that bonds skin edges through soldering without the use of synthetic materials or conventional wound approximation methods such as sutures, staples, or skin adhesives. The cold plasma welding system uses a biological solder applied to the edges of a skin incision, followed by the application of cold plasma energy. The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of a cold plasma welding system in approximating and fixating skin incisions compared with conventional methods and to evaluate and define optimal plasma welding parameters and histopathological tissue response in a porcine model. The cold plasma welding system (BioWeld1 System, IonMed Ltd, Yokneam, Israel) was used on porcine skin incisions using variable energy parameters. Wound healing was compared macroscopically and histologically to incisions approximated with sutures. When compared to sutured skin closure, cold plasma welding in specific system parameters demonstrated comparable and favorable wound healing results histopathologically as well as macroscopically. No evidence of epidermal damage, thermal or otherwise, was encountered in the specified parameters. Notably, bleeding, infection, and wound dehiscence were not detected at incision sites. Skin incisions welded at extreme energy parameters presented second-degree burns. Implementation of cold plasma welding has been shown to be feasible for skin closure. Initial in vivo results suggest cold plasma welding might provide equal, if not better, healing results than traditional methods of closure.\n\nCarotid endarterectomy: comparison of complications between transverse and longitudinal incision.\n\nPubMed\n\nMendes, George A C; Zabramski, Joseph M; Elhadi, Ali M; Kalani, M Yashar S; Preul, Mark C; Nakaji, Peter; Spetzler, Robert F\n\n2014-08-01\n\nCranial nerve injury (CNI) is the most common neurological complication associated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Some authors postulate that the transverse skin incision leads to increased risk of CNI. We compared the incidence of CNI associated with the transverse and longitudinal skin incisions in a high-volume cerebrovascular center. We reviewed the charts of 226 consecutive patients who underwent CEAs between January 2007 and August 2009. Pre- and postoperative standardized neurological evaluations were performed by faculty neurologists and neurosurgeons. One hundred sixty nine of 226 (75%) CEAs were performed with the use of a transverse incision. The longitudinal incision was generally reserved for patients with a high-riding carotid bifurcation. Mean patient age was 69 years (range, 45-91 years); 62% were men; 59% of patients were symptomatic and had high-grade stenosis (70%-99%). CNI occurred in 8 cases (3.5%): 5 (3%) in transverse and 3 (5.3%) with longitudinal incisions (P = .42). There were 2 marginal mandibular nerve injuries, 1 (0.6%) transverse and 1 longitudinal; 5 recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries, 4 transverse and 1 longitudinal; and 1 case of hypoglossal nerve injury associated with longitudinal incision. One hematoma was associated with CNI. All injuries were transient. Fourteen wound hematomas required surgical evacuation. The transverse skin incision for CEAs is not associated with an increased risk of CNI (P =.42). In this study, the incidence of CNI associated with the transverse incision was 3% (n = 5) vs 5% (n = 3) for longitudinal incisions. All CNIs were temporary.\n\nMiniature surgical robot for laparoendoscopic single-incision colectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWortman, Tyler D; Meyer, Avishai; Dolghi, Oleg; Lehman, Amy C; McCormick, Ryan L; Farritor, Shane M; Oleynikov, Dmitry\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThis study aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a multifunctional miniature in vivo robotic platform to perform a single-incision colectomy. Standard laparoscopic techniques require multiple ports. A miniature robotic platform to be inserted completely into the peritoneal cavity through a single incision has been designed and built. The robot can be quickly repositioned, thus enabling multiquadrant access to the abdominal cavity. The miniature in vivo robotic platform used in this study consists of a multifunctional robot and a remote surgeon interface. The robot is composed of two arms with shoulder and elbow joints. Each forearm is equipped with specialized interchangeable end effectors (i.e., graspers and monopolar electrocautery). Five robotic colectomies were performed in a porcine model. For each procedure, the robot was completely inserted into the peritoneal cavity, and the surgeon manipulated the user interface to control the robot to perform the colectomy. The robot mobilized the colon from its lateral retroperitoneal attachments and assisted in the placement of a standard stapler to transect the sigmoid colon. This objective was completed for all five colectomies without any complications. The adoption of both laparoscopic and single-incision colectomies currently is constrained by the inadequacies of existing instruments. The described multifunctional robot provides a platform that overcomes existing limitations by operating completely within one incision in the peritoneal cavity and by improving visualization and dexterity. By repositioning the small robot to the area of the colon to be mobilized, the ability of the surgeon to perform complex surgical tasks is improved. Furthermore, the success of the robot in performing a completely in vivo colectomy suggests the feasibility of using this robotic platform to perform other complex surgeries through a single incision.\n\n[EFFECTIVENESS OF ADVANCED SKIN FLAP AND V-SHAPED VENTRAL INCISION ALONG THE ROOT OF PENILE SHAFT FOR CONCEALED PENIS].\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Junshan; Li, Dumiao; Zhang, Jianxing; Wu, Qiang; Xu, Yali; Lin, Li\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo investigate effectiveness of advanced skin flap and V-shaped ventral incision along the root of penile shaft for concealed penis in children. Between July 2007 and January 2015, 121 boys with concealed penis were treated with advanced skin flap and V-shaped ventral incision along the root of penile shaft. The age varied from 18 months to 13 years (mean, 7.2 years). Repair was based on a vertical incision in median raphe, complete degloving of penis and tacking its base to the dermis of the skin. Advanced skin flap and a V-shaped ventral incision along the root of penile shaft were used to cover the penile shaft. The operation time ranged from 60 to 100 minutes (mean, 75 minutes). Disruption of wound occurred in 1 case, and was cured after dressing change; and primary healing of incision was obtained in the others. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 7 years (median, 24 months). All patients achieved good to excellent cosmetic results with a low incidence of complications. The results were satisfactory in exposure of penis and prepuce appearance. No obvious scar was observed. The penis had similar appearance to that after prepuce circumcision. A combination of advanced skin flap and V-shaped ventral incision along the root of penile shaft is a simple, safe, and effective procedure for concealed penis with a similar appearance result to the prepuce circumcision.\n\n[One-stage Operation through the Same Skin Incision for Synchronous Double Primary Breast and Lung Cancer;Report of a Case].\n\nPubMed\n\nTakahashi, Noriyuki; Kuga, Yoko; Uno, Satoko; Saito, Keita\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA 75-year-old woman noticed a small mass in the right side breast and consulted our hospital. The results of the detailed examination indicated the synchronous double primary right breast cancer and the same side lung cancer (rS5). One-stage operation from the same skin incision was scheduled. Volume rendering (VR) of computed tomography (CT)-scan was very useful in deciding the position and the length of the skin incision. The breast tumor resection and the right middle lobe resection were successfully performed through 6.5 cm skin incision.\n\nTemperature-controlled laser-soldering system and its clinical application for bonding skin incisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSimhon, David; Gabay, Ilan; Shpolyansky, Gregory; Vasilyev, Tamar; Nur, Israel; Meidler, Roberto; Hatoum, Ossama Abu; Katzir, Abraham; Hashmonai, Moshe; Kopelman, Doron\n\n2015-12-01\n\nLaser tissue soldering is a method of repairing incisions. It involves the application of a biological solder to the approximated edges of the incision and heating it with a laser beam. A pilot clinical study was carried out on 10 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Of the four abdominal incisions in each patient, two were sutured and two were laser soldered. Cicatrization, esthetical appearance, degree of pain, and pruritus in the incisions were examined on postoperative days 1, 7, and 30. The soldered wounds were watertight and healed well, with no discharge from these wounds or infection. The total closure time was equal in both methods, but the net soldering time was much shorter than suturing. There was no difference between the two types of wound closure with respect to the pain and pruritus on a follow-up of one month. Esthetically, the soldered incisions were estimated as good as the sutured ones. The present study confirmed that temperature-controlled laser soldering of human skin incisions is clinically feasible, and the results obtained were at least equivalent to those of standard suturing.\n\nTemperature-controlled laser-soldering system and its clinical application for bonding skin incisions.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimhon, David; Gabay, Ilan; Shpolyansky, Gregory; Vasilyev, Tamar; Nur, Israel; Meidler, Roberto; Hatoum, Ossama Abu; Katzir, Abraham; Hashmonai, Moshe; Kopelman, Doron\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLaser tissue soldering is a method of repairing incisions.

A detailed description of the relative anatomic course of the nerve is important to define clinical guidelines and minimize iatrogenic damage during anterior knee surgery. In twenty embalmed knees, the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve was dissected. With use of a computer-assisted surgical anatomy mapping tool, safe and risk zones, as well as the location-dependent direction of the nerve, were calculated. The location of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve is highly variable, and no definite safe zone could be identified. The infrapatellar branch runs in neither a purely horizontal nor a vertical course. The course of the branch is location-dependent. Medially, it runs a nearly vertical course; medial to the patellar tendon, it has a -45Â° distal-lateral course; and on the patella and patellar tendon, it runs a close to horizontal-lateral course. Three low risk zones for iatrogenic nerve injury were identified: one is on the medial side of the knee, at the level of the tibial tuberosity, where a -45Â° oblique incision is least prone to damage the nerves, and two zones are located medial to the patellar apex (cranial and caudal), where close to horizontal incisions are least prone to damage the nerves. The infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve is at risk for iatrogenic damage in anteromedial knee surgery, especially when longitudinal incisions are made. There are three low risk zones for a safer anterior approach to the knee. The direction of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve is location-dependent. To minimize iatrogenic damage to the nerve, the direction of incisions should be parallel to the direction of the nerve when technically possible. These findings suggest that iatrogenic damage of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve can be minimized in anteromedial\n\n[Shift the skin paddle in an additional incision improves the result: Study of a series of 82 breast reconstructions by latissimus dorsi flap and prosthesis implantation at 10 years].\n\nPubMed\n\nChiriac, S; Dissaux, C; Bruant-Rodier, C; Djerada, Z; Bodin, F; FranÃ§ois, C\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe position of the skin paddle on the breast area is a fundamental element for the breast reconstructions by latissimus dorsi flap and prosthesis implantation. Should, as Millard advocated, to recreate the initial defect and include it in the mastectomy scar or is it better in an additional incision as have others authors. This study compares the long-term morphological results of these two attitudes, with or without additional incision. Eighty-two breast reconstructions by latissimus dorsi flap and prosthesis implantation, with a mean follow-up of 9.5 years were scored from 1 to 5 by a panel of expert and non-expert. The patients scored also their own reconstruction. Various parameters of the reconstructed breast were thus evaluated. We compared the results, according to the positioning of the skin paddle: with additional incision (50 cases); without additional incision (32 cases). The characteristics of the mastectomy scar on the breast area, high or low, horizontal or oblique, defined 6 groups where the results of the 2 surgical options were compared. Only the reconstructions with additional incision get significantly higher results than those without additional incision (P<0.05). This involves the two panels, in the case of high mastectomy scars. In the others cases the additional incision is not essential. If the realization of an additional incision can be perceived like misfit on an area already \"mutilated\", we plead for this solution in selected cases. This provides a benefit stable in time, in terms of overall results, shape and even rendering scar. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the optimal timing for administration of pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing of prophylactic antibiotics on the frequency of surgical site infection after appendectomy. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for 577 consecutive patients who had appendectomy for acute appendicitis from 2006 to 2009. Quality assurance guidelines for timing of prophylactic antibiotics before the skin incision were changed from 0 to 30âmin before the skin incision (before June 2008) to 30 to 60âmin before the skin incision (after June 2008). Surgical site infection occurred in 28 patients (4.9%). There was no difference in frequency of surgical site infection with different timing of pre-operative prophylactic antibiotic (pre-operative time 0 to 30âmin: 9 infections [3.6%]; 31 to 60âmin: 13 infections [5.4%]; 61 to 120âmin: 5 infections [7.0%]; >120âmin: 1 infection [6.6%]). Multivariable analysis showed that surgical site infection was associated significantly with medical comorbidity but not perforated appendicitis. The frequency of surgical site infection was independent of timing of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics but was associated with the presence of medical comorbidity.\n\nAlcohol skin preparation causes surgical fires.\n\nPubMed\n\nRocos, B; Donaldson, L J\n\n2012-03-01\n\nSurgical fires are a rare but serious preventable safety risk in modern hospitals. Data from the US show that up to 650 surgical fires occur each year, with up to 5% causing death or serious harm. This study used the National Reporting and Learning Service (NRLS) database at the National Patient Safety Agency to explore whether spirit-based surgical skin preparation fluid contributes to the cause of surgical fires. The NRLS database was interrogated for all incidents of surgical fires reported between 1 March 2004 and 1 March 2011. Each report was scrutinised manually to discover the cause of the fire. Thirteen surgical fires were reported during the study period. Of these, 11 were found to be directly related to spirit-based surgical skin preparation or preparation soaked swabs and drapes. Despite manufacturer's instructions and warnings, surgical fires continue to occur. Guidance published in the UK and US states that spirit-based skin preparation solutions should continue to be used but sets out some precautions. It may be that fire risk should be included in pre-surgical World Health Organization checklists or in the surgical training curriculum. Surgical staff should be aware of the risk that spirit-based skin preparation fluids pose and should take action to minimise the chance of fire occurring.\n\nTissue adhesives for closure of surgical incisions.\n\nPubMed\n\nDumville, Jo C; Coulthard, Paul; Worthington, Helen V; Riley, Philip; Patel, Neil; Darcey, James; Esposito, Marco; van der Elst, Maarten; van Waes, Oscar J F\n\n2014-11-28\n\nSutures (stitches), staples and adhesive tapes have been used for many years as methods of wound closure, but tissue adhesives have entered clinical practice more recently. Closure of wounds with sutures enables the closure to be meticulous, but the sutures may show tissue reactivity and can require removal. Tissue adhesives offer the advantages of an absence of risk of needlestick injury and no requirement to remove sutures later. Initially, tissue adhesives were used primarily in emergency room settings, but this review looks at the use of tissue adhesives in the operating room/theatre where surgeons are using them increasingly for the closure of surgical skin incisions. To determine the effects of various tissue adhesives compared with conventional skin closure techniques for the closure of surgical wounds. In March 2014 for this second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search and study selection with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. We conducted screening of eligible studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. We expressed results as random-effects models using mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We investigated heterogeneity, including both clinical and methodological factors. This second update of the review identified 19 additional eligible trials resulting in a total of 33 studies (2793 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. There was low quality evidence that sutures were significantly better than tissue adhesives for reducing the risk of wound breakdown (dehiscence; RR 3.35; 95% CI 1.53 to 7\n\nQuaternized Q-PEIPAAm-Based Antimicrobial Reverse Thermal Gel: A Potential for Surgical Incision Drapes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBortot, Maria; Laughter, Melissa Ronni; Stein, Madia; Rocker, Adam; Patel, Vikas; Park, Daewon\n\n2018-05-16\n\nA quaternized reverse thermal gel (RTG) aimed at replacing current surgical incision drapes (SIDs) was designed and characterized. The antimicrobial efficacy of the quaternized RTG was analyzed using both in vitro and in vivo models and was compared to standard SIDs. Polymer characterization was completed using both nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) analysis. Biocompatibility was assessed using a standard cell viability assay. The in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the polymer was analyzed against four common bacteria species using a time-kill test. The in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of the polymer and standard SIDs were compared using a murine model aimed at mimicking surgical conditions. NMR confirmed the polymer structure and presence of quaternized groups and alkyl chains. The polymer displayed a LCST of 34 Â°C and a rapid rate of gelation, allowing stable gel formation when applied to skin. Once quaternized, the polymer displayed an increase in kill-rate of bacteria compared to unquaternized polymer. In experiments aimed at mimicking surgical conditions, the quaternized polymer showed statistically comparable bacteria-killing capacity to the standard SID and even surpassed the SID for killing capacity at various time points. A novel approach to replacing current SIDs was developed using an antimicrobial polymer system with RTG properties. The RTG properties of this polymer maintain a liquid state at low temperatures and a gel upon heating, allowing this polymer to form a tight coating when applied to skin. Furthermore, this polymer achieved excellent antimicrobial properties in both in vitro and in vivo models. With further optimization, this polymer system has the potential to replace and streamline presurgical patient preparations through its easy application and beneficial antimicrobial properties.\n\nDiathermy vs. scalpel skin incisions in general surgery: double-blind, randomized, clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nShamim, Muhammad\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThis prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was designed to compare the outcome of diathermy incisions versus scalpel incisions in general surgery. A total of 369 patients who underwent diathermy incision (group A: 185 patients) or scalpel incision (group B: 184 patients) were analyzed. Variables analyzed were: surgical wound classification, length and depth of incision, incision time, duration of operation, incisional blood loss, postoperative pain, duration of hospital stay, duration of healing, and postoperative complications. The inclusion criteria were all patients who underwent elective or emergency general surgery. The exclusion criteria were only cases with incomplete patients' data and patients who were lost to follow-up. This study was conducted at Fatima Hospital-Baqai Medical University and Shamsi Hospital (Karachi), from January 2006 to December 2007. Incision time was significantly longer for patients in group B (p = 0.001). Incisional blood loss also was more for patients in group B (p = 0.000). Pain perception was found to be markedly reduced during the first 48 h in group A (p = 0.000). Total period of hospital stay (p = 0.129) and time for complete wound healing (p = 0.683) were almost the same for both groups. Postoperative complication rate by wound classification did not differ markedly between the two groups (p = 0.002 vs. p = 0.000). Diathermy incision has significant advantages compared with the scalpel because of reduced incision time, less blood loss, & reduced early postoperative pain.\n\nAlcohol skin preparation causes surgical fires\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRocos, B; Donaldson, LJ\n\n2012-01-01\n\nINTRODUCTION Surgical fires are a rare but serious preventable safety risk in modern hospitals.

However, whether the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are also activated in response to surgical incision remains to be determined. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of TNF-Î± and IL-6 in the spinal cord following a deep thoracic incision. After surgical incision, the mRNA levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6 in the thoracic spinal cord were transiently upregulated as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. However, the activation of IL-6 was detected at 1 h postoperatively, which was earlier compared to that of TNF-Î±, observed at 6 h postoperatively. The activated TNF-Î± was mainly localized in the neurons, but not in microglia or astrocytes as determined by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. However, the increased IL-6-immunoreactivity was mainly expressed in blood vessels. The differential upregulation of TNF-Î± and IL-6 induced by incision suggests that the proinflammatory cytokines may play different roles in the development of surgical pain.\n\nSimulation-based cutaneous surgical-skill training on a chicken-skin bench model in a medical undergraduate program.\n\nPubMed\n\nDenadai, Rafael; Saad-Hossne, RogÃ©rio; MartinhÃ£o Souto, LuÃ­s Ricardo\n\n2013-05-01\n\nBecause of ethical and medico-legal aspects involved in the training of cutaneous surgical skills on living patients, human cadavers and living animals, it is necessary the search for alternative and effective forms of training simulation. To propose and describe an alternative methodology for teaching and learning the principles of cutaneous surgery in a medical undergraduate program by using a chicken-skin bench model. One instructor for every four students, teaching materials on cutaneous surgical skills, chicken trunks, wings, or thighs, a rigid platform support, needled threads, needle holders, surgical blades with scalpel handles, rat-tooth tweezers, scissors, and marking pens were necessary for training simulation. A proposal for simulation-based training on incision, suture, biopsy, and on reconstruction techniques using a chicken-skin bench model distributed in several sessions and with increasing levels of difficultywas structured. Both feedback and objective evaluations always directed to individual students were also outlined. The teaching of a methodology for the principles of cutaneous surgery using a chicken-skin bench model versatile, portable, easy to assemble, and inexpensive is an alternative and complementary option to the armamentarium of methods based on other bench models described.\n\nRole of Trpv1 and Trpv4 in surgical incision-induced tissue swelling and Fos-like immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nMotojima, Yasuhito; Nishimura, Haruki; Ueno, Hiromichi; Sonoda, Satomi; Nishimura, Kazuaki; Tanaka, Kentaro; Saito, Reiko; Yoshimura, Mitsuhiro; Maruyama, Takashi; Matsuura, Takanori; Suzuki, Hitoshi; Kawasaki, Makoto; Ohnishi, Hideo; Sakai, Akinori; Ueta, Yoichi\n\n2018-06-21\n\nPain management remains a major concern regarding the treatment of postoperative patients. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are considered to be new therapeutic targets for pain control. We investigated whether the genes Trpv1 and Trpv4 are involved in hind paw swelling caused after surgical incision in mice or in incision-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) levels in the central nervous system. Mice were divided into four groups: wild-type (WT) control, WT incision, Trpv1 knockout (Trpv1 -/- ) incision, and Trpv4 knockout (Trpv4 -/- ) incision. Mice were anesthetized, and only those in the incision, and not control, groups received a surgical incision to their right plantar hind paw. Changes in paw diameter and in Fos-LI levels in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and central amygdala were evaluated 2â¯h after the incision. There was no significant difference in the paw diameter among groups. In contrast, in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and PVN, Fos-LI was significantly higher in all incision groups than in the WT control group. A significant increase in Fos-positive cells was also observed in the dorsal horn laminae III-IV in Trpv1 -/- and Trpv4 -/- incision groups compared with the WT incision group. Our results indicate that surgical incision activates the PVN and that Trpv1 and Trpv4 might be involved in neuronal activity in the dorsal horn laminae III-IV after surgical incision.

The use of the flexible endoscope for single-incision surgery paves the way for further refinement of both surgical methods. To describe a new, single-incision surgical technique, namely, flexible single-incision surgery. Assessment of the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic cholecystectomy in a series of 30 patients. This technique consists of a single umbilical incision through which a flexible endoscope is introduced and consists of 2 parallel entry ports that provide access to nonarticulated laparoscopic instruments. The technique was applied in all patients for whom it was prescribed. No general or surgical wound complications were noted. Surgical time was no longer than usual for single-port surgery. Flexible single-incision surgery is a new single-site surgical technique offering the same level of patient safety, with additional advantages for the surgeon at minimal cost.\n\n[Healing status of surgical incisions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with fractures].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Xin; Zhang, Qiang; Zhao, Changsong; Sun, Sheng; Cai, Juan\n\n2014-09-09\n\nTo observe the healing status of surgical incisions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with fractures and explore the factors related with poor wound healing, treatment and preventive measures. Retrospective analyses were performed for the clinical data of 61 HIV-positive patients with fractures. And the influencing factors, treatment and outcomes of poor wound healing were analyzed. Among them, the healing status was good (n = 50) and poor (n = 11). And the outcomes included redness (n = 10), oozing (n = 8), split (n = 3), infection (n = 2), hematoma (n = 1), fat liquefaction (n = 2) and delayed healing (n = 2). All healed well after treatment. There was no infection or death during the follow-up period. Compared with HIV-negative patients, it was not statistically significant in wound infection. However, poor healing rates were significantly different (P < 0.05). The risk factors included advanced age, low body mass index, low albumin, low hemoglobin, low total lymphocyte count, low CD4âº T lymphocyte count, high HIV infection clinical stage, long operative duration, emergency surgery and incision contamination. In HIV-positive patients with fractures, the healing of surgical incision is generally good. However few have poor wound healing due to multiple factors. If poor healing is identified early and handled timely and correctly, good healing ensues.\n\nSurgical treatment of gynecomastia with severe ptosis: periareolar incision and dermal double areolar pedicle technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nCannistra, Claudio; Piedimonte, Andrea; Albonico, Fiorella\n\n2009-11-01\n\nGynecomastia is a morphostructural impairment of the mammary region in men caused by parenchymal hypertrophy or a cutaneous distortion of breast skin covering or both. The clinical classification introduced by Simon et al. in 1973 ranks gynecomastia in three degrees. Each subtype can be treated with a specific technique. This article describes an alternative surgical procedure for treating gynecomastia with severe ptosis(type III and type IIIb of Simon's classification). Fifty-eight patients were treated for gynecomastia in our Plastic Surgery Unit from 1996 to 2004. The cutaneous excess of periareolar skin is evaluated by a pinching test. A circular periareolar mark is traced corresponding to the cutaneous excess that has to be removed.Initially, liposuction of adipous tissue on the periphery of the mammary region is performed through two cutaneous 3-mm incisions at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions around the areola. After this, the liposuction incisions are enlarged from 10 o'clock to 8 o'clock and from 2 o'clockto 4 o'clock to create access for the mastectomy. This dissection creates a double dermal areolar pedicle. The new areolar position is fixed with a Benelli round block suture. A resolution of the morphologic deformity without evident scars after hair growth and a correction of the breast deformity has been observed in the 6-month follow-ups conducted for all the patients. We observed that the vascular-nervous net under the areola at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock is very important, more so than the lateral pedicle, and the conservation of a double vascular-nervous pedicle reduces significantly the risk of areolar necrosis, especially in cases of gynecomastia type III and in cases where there is a high degree of breast malformation such as the tuberous breast.\n\n[Relationship between FoxO1 Expression and Wound Age during Skin Incised Wound Healing].\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Y; Ji, X Y; Fan, Y Y; Yu, L S\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo investigate FoxO1 expression and its time-dependent changes during the skin incised wound healing. After the establishment of the skin incised wound model in mice, the FoxO1 expression of skin in different time periods was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that FoxO1 was weakly expressed in a few fibroblasts of epidermis, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, vessel endothelium and dermis in the control group. The FoxO1 expression was enhanced in the epidermis and skin appendages around the wound during 6-12 h after injury, which could be detected in the infiltrating neutrophils and a small number of monocytes. FoxO1 was mainly expressed in monocytes during 1-3 d after injury, and in neovascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts during 5-10 d. On the 14th day after injury, the FoxO1 expression still could be detected in a few fibroblasts. The Western blotting results showed that the FoxO1 expression quantity of the tissue samples in injury group was higher than in control group. The FoxO1 expression peaked at 12 h and 7 d after injury. FoxO1 is time-dependently expressed in skin wound healing, which can be a useful marker for wound age determination.

A skin biopsy sample was collected, and 2-cm skin incisions (4/modality) were made in each snake under anesthesia and closed with surgical staples on day 0. Incision sites were grossly evaluated and scored daily. One skin biopsy sample per incision type per snake was obtained on days 2, 7, 14, and 30. Necrotic and fibroplastic tissue was measured in histologic sections; samples were assessed and scored for total inflammation, histologic response (based on the measurement of necrotic and fibroplastic tissues and total inflammation score), and other variables. Frequency distributions of gross and histologic variables associated with wound healing were calculated. Gross wound scores were significantly greater (indicating greater separation of wound edges) for laser incisions than for RWRS and scalpel incisions at all evaluated time points. Necrosis was significantly greater in laser and RWRS incisions than in scalpel incision sites on days 2 and 14 and days 2 and 7, respectively; fibroplasia was significantly greater in laser than in scalpel incision sites on day 30.
