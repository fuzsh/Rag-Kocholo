        "text": "Jazz icon and proud Canadian Oscar Peterson died of kidney failure at his home in Mississauga, Ontario, on December 23. He was 82. The Montreal-born pianist was a legendary figure in the jazz world, having played with the likes of Coleman Hawkins, Herb Ellis, Louis Armstrong, Stéphane Grappelli, Ella Fitzgerald, Clark Terry, Joe Pass, Anita O'Day, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, and Stan Getz over the years.\n\nDespite his international fame and acclaim, Peterson never forgot his Canadian roots. In 1964, he recorded his famous Canadian Suite with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen. Peterson received a number of honours from his homeland: he was elected to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Juno Awards Hall of Fame, and the Canadian Jazz and Blues Hall of Fame. In 1972, the pianist was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and was promoted to Companion, its highest rank, in 1984. According to Wikipedia, he is also a member of the Order of Ontario and a Chevalier of the National Order of Quebec. On Peterson's 80th birthday, August 15, 2005, Canada Post unveiled a commemorative postage stamp in his honour, marking the first time Canadian stamp was created depicting an individual who was still alive (other than members of the British Royal Family)."
