Grand Rapids, Itasca County, Minnesota:

Frances Ethel Gumm, who became Judy Garland and starred as Dortohy in one of the world's most beloved films, "The Wizard of Oz," was born and spent her earliest years in Grand Rapids. A section of the Ithaca County Museum is dedicated to her, but even more interesting is to visit the home where the famous child star was born.

This 1925 historic home has been moved to its present location and is adjacent to the New Children's Discovery Museum. For a $5.00 fee you may tour the house which features a gallery with Abe Lincoln's carriage from "The Wizard of Oz," performance and documentary screenings, momentos from Judy Garlands acting career, a garden and gift shop.
