        "text": "She took 8th place in the list of the most movie stars in the United States. Judy Garland has become a real legend of the last century. A miniature woman was remembered by many thanks to her magical voice and the characteristic roles that she got in the cinema.\n\nChildhood and youth\n\nFrancis Ethel Gumm (real name of the artist) was born back in 1922 in the provincial town of Grand Rapids. The girl's parents were directly related to creativity. They rented a small theater in the town, on the stage of which they staged interesting performances.\n\nLittle Francis first appeared on the big stage at the age of three. The timid girl, together with her mother and her sisters, performed the musical composition \"Jingle Bells\" for the public. Actually from that moment the biography of the charming artist began.\n\nSoon a large family moved to the territory of Lancaster. It was a forced measure, which is associated with the scandal of the head of the family. In the new city, the father managed to buy his own theater, on the stage of which Judy and the rest of the family performed.\n\nThe creative path of Judy Garland\n\nIn the mid-30s of the last century, the girl began performing under the creative pseudonym Judy Garland. Luck smiled at her, as the prestigious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio offered to sign the girl a contract. At the time of the transaction, she was barely 13 years old.\n\nHer path to popularity is not an easy one. The directors were embarrassed by the small growth of the actress, and she was also forced to align her teeth and nose. The owner of MGM called her \"little hunchback\", but acting skills were in full swing, so the directors turned a blind eye to Judy's small flaws.\n\nSoon she appeared in rating films. Most of the tapes in which the girl starred were musical. Judy did an excellent job.\n\nGarland's career developed at the speed of the wind. Her work schedule was scheduled by the minute. Judy was offered the most \"delicious\" and iconic roles of that time. There were no scandals either. In one of the interviews, Judy accused the organizers of the film company of giving her and other actors in musicals amphetamines to support strength and mood after a hard day's work. In addition, MGM recommended that the already skinny girl go on a strict diet.\n\nThe organizers of the company managed to do everything to ensure that Judy developed complexes that accompanied her all her life. Even after world popularity, the actress felt like an inferior member of society.\n\nAt the end of the 30s of the last century, she got a role in the film The Wizard of Oz. In the film, she pleased with the performance of the musical composition Over the Rainbow.\n\nThe artist's health\n\nAgainst the background of physical activity, an exhausting diet and a busy schedule, the actress began to have health problems. Thus, the filming of \"Summer Tour\" was significantly delayed, and the actress was completely removed from the musical \"Royal Wedding\". MGM has announced that it intends to terminate the contract with the actress. After that, she returned to the stage of Broadway.\n\nIn the mid-50s, the melodrama A Star Is Born was broadcast on the screens. At the box office, the tape failed, but the audience still spoke enthusiastically about Judy Garland's performance.\n\nOne of the most significant roles of Judy went to her in the drama \"The Nuremberg Trials\". The film was released in the early 60s of the last century. For the work done, the artist was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe.\n\nDetails of the personal life of the actress\n\nThe personal life of the artist was eventful. She first married at the age of 19, to the charming musician David Rose. This marriage proved to be a huge mistake for both parties. David and Judy divorced two years later.\n\nGarland did not grieve for long. Soon she was seen in a relationship with director Vincent Minnelli. This man became the second spouse of a celebrity. In this family, the couple had a daughter, who continued the career of her famous mother. After 6 years, Judy filed for divorce.\n\nIn the early 50s, she married for the third time. This time her chosen one is Sidney Luft. From a man she gave birth to two more children. This marriage did not bring happiness to the woman, and she divorced Cindy.\n\nShe married twice in the mid-60s. Her last husband is considered to be Mickey Deans. By the way, this marriage lasted only 3 months.\n\nDeath of Judy Garland\n\nShe died on June 22, 1969. The lifeless body of the actress was found in the bathroom of her own home. The cause of death was an overdose. She \"overdid\" with the use of sedatives. Doctors stated that the cause of death was not related to suicide."
