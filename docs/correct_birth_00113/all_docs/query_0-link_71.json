        "text": "(1922–69). American singer and actress Judy Garland spent most of her life as a show-business legend. She began performing as a vibrant teenage movie star and then became a concert performer known for her rich voice and ability to communicate with the audience through song.\n\nGarland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Her parents were both vaudeville performers, who operated the New Grand Theatre in Grand Rapids. There, when she was just over two years old, Frances made her debut. In 1932—by that time a 10-year-old singing sensation—she received her first rave review from the entertainment news magazine Variety, and two years later—at the suggestion of the comedian George Jessel—she adopted the surname Garland. (She chose the first name Judy shortly thereafter, from the popular 1934 Hoagy Carmichael song of that name.) Her stage presence and powerful voice caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) motion-picture studio in 1935, and he signed her to a film contract. The following year she made her screen debut in a short film titled Every Sunday.\n\nGarland soon became a star of Hollywood musicals. She began a screen partnership with Mickey Rooney in Thoroughbreds Don’t Cry (1937), and the two went on to act together in several films, including Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938), Babes in Arms (1939), Strike Up the Band (1940), Babes on Broadway (1941), and Girl Crazy (1943). Garland also performed with Gene Kelly in his film debut, For Me and My Gal (1942), and with Fred Astaire in Easter Parade (1948). The movie Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) showcased her memorable renditions of the songs “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” and “The Trolley Song.”\n\nGarland received a special Academy Award for her performance in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Although her name has become forever identified with the character Dorothy in the fantasy classic, the producer originally tried to get Shirley Temple for the part. One of the film’s most memorable songs, “Over the Rainbow,” became Garland’s signature piece.\n\nExhaustion from a relentless work schedule and a growing dependency on prescription drugs contributed to Garland’s nervous breakdown in the late 1940s. When she had problems completing films, MGM released her two years early from her contract, which led her to attempt suicide. Although plagued with personal problems, including numerous failed marriages, she emerged as one of the most popular concert performers of the 1950s and ’60s and broke box-office records in New York, New York, and London, England. Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall (1961), a recording of a live performance, earned her five Grammy Awards, including album of the year and best female vocal performance."
