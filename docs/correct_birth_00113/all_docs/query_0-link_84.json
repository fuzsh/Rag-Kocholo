        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Minn. (Northern News Now) - The Grand Rapids Police Department announced more details on the stolen ruby slippers from the iconic 1939 movie, “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\nThe slippers were returned to their rightful owner, Michael Shaw, in February during a return ceremony at Judy Garland’s childhood home.\n\nTerry Jon Martin, 76, stole the slippers in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, which is the late actor’s hometown.\n\nAccording to a memo that was filed ahead of his sentencing in January, Martin gave into temptation after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value.\n\n“We are incredibly honored to return the ruby slippers to their rightful owner,” said Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr. of FBI Minneapolis. “Beyond the glittering allure of the shoes lies a testament to the FBI’s unyielding commitment to preserving the everlasting legacy of cherished memorabilia. This piece of cinematic history has been returned to Mr. Shaw through the diligent efforts of our dedicated agents, professional staff, and invaluable partners.”\n\n“Recognizing the catastrophic loss to both Mr. Shaw and the countless fans of this piece of American cinema history, the Grand Rapids Police Department is extremely pleased that the slippers have been returned to Mr. Shaw,” said Chief of Police Andy Morgan of Grand Rapids Police Department. “The collaboration between all partnering agencies cannot be overlooked or minimized. The countless hours of dedicated investigative efforts by current GRPD staff, retired staff, our partners at the FBI and the many other assisting agencies made the return possible.”\n\nJudy Garland wore the iconic ruby slippers during the filming of the 1939 classic “The Wizard of Oz.” The stolen slippers were one of the only four known surviving pairs from filming.\n\nThe disappearance in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids left a void in both cinema history and the heart of a community proud to call itself Garland’s birthplace.\n\nDuring the ceremony, in Garland’s childhood home at the museum, the iconic ruby slippers were placed on their original pedestal reclaiming not just an artifact but rekindling the museum’s identity as a guardian of Garland’s legacy.\n\n“The Judy Garland Museum survived the impact of this violation and is grateful to be a part of the homecoming,” said John Kelsh, Founding Director of the Judy Garland Museum. “We continue to serve visitors from around the world; expect a Ruby Slipper Crime exhibit in our future.”\n\nGrand Rapids Police said that when Shaw, accompanied by his niece, laid eyes on the slippers for the first time in nearly two decades, he compared the experience to a heartfelt reunion with a long-lost friend.\n\nHe then had the opportunity to meet Special Agent Christopher Dudley and Chief Morgan, who dedicated countless hours to the case and ensured the safe return of the iconic slippers.\n\nAgent Dudley surprised Shaw by not only returning the ruby slippers but also presenting him with the single red sequin that was left at the scene of the crime almost twenty years ago.\n\n“It was incredibly rewarding and fitting to see Mr. Shaw reunited with the Ruby Slippers, at Judy Garland’s home, accompanied by his friends on the museum staff,” said Special Agent Dudley. “It is a privilege for the FBI and our Art Crime Team to work alongside law enforcement partners who truly value the importance of protecting our nation’s cultural heritage.”\n\nBoth the museum and Shaw expressed their deep gratitude to the FBI and Grand Rapids Police Department for their commitment and tenacity.\n\nShaw immediately turned the ruby slippers over to an auction company, which plans to take them on an international tour before offering them at auction in December, an official with Dallas-based Heritage Auctions said Monday.\n\nThe auction company said the tour of the slippers will include stops in Los Angeles, New York, London, and Tokyo. Dates were not announced.\n\n“You cannot overstate the importance of Dorothy’s ruby slippers: They are the most important prop in Hollywood history,” Heritage Auctions Executive Vice President Joe Maddalena said in the news release.\n\nThe criminal investigation surrounding the theft is still ongoing as a second man has been indicted on charges of theft of a major artwork and witness tampering.\n\nJerry Hal Saliterman, 76, of Crystal, Minn, made his first court appearance on Friday in St. Paul.\n\nThe indictment says that from August 2005 to July 2018 Saliterman “received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage” — specifically, “an authentic pair of ‘ruby slippers’ worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 movie ‘The Wizard of Oz.’” The indictment says Saliterman knew they were stolen, and that he threatened to release a sex tape of a woman and “take her down with him” if she didn’t keep her mouth shut about the slippers.\n\nClick here to download the Northern News Now app or our Northern News Now First Alert weather app."
