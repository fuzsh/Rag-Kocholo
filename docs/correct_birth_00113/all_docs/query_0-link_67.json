        "meta_description": "Born Frances Ethel Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, Garland was the youngest child of Ethel Marion (née Milne; November 17, 1893 – January 5, 1953) and Francis Avent \"Frank\" Gumm (March 20, 1886 – November 17, 1935). Her parents were vaudevillians who settled in Grand Rapids to run a movie theatre that featured vaudeville acts.\r\n\r\nNamed after both her parents and baptized at a local Episcopal church, \"Baby\" (as she was called by her parents and sisters) shared her family's flair for song and dance. Her first appearance came at the age of two-and-a-half when she joined her two older sisters, Mary Jane \"Suzy/Suzanne\" Gumm (1915–1964) and Dorothy Virginia \"Jimmie\" Gumm (1917–1977), on the stage of her father's movie theater during a Christmas show and sang a chorus of \"Jingle Bells\". Accompanied by their mother on piano, The Gumm Sisters performed there for the next few years.",
