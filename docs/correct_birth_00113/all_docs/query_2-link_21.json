        "text": "In the early sixties when I was a young woman living at Tahoe, my mother and I had reservations for a dinner show at Harrahs where Judy Garland was to appear, we were going because my mother was having surgery the next day and would be out of commission for a couple of weeks. We arrived at Harrahs and were seated only to be told that Ms. Garland would not be appearing that night as she was ill. Oh, how disappointed I was! The next day I visited the hospital, and asked my mother how she was feeling, she had been out of surgery for several hours, she said fine, with the exception of this awful woman in the room next to hers who was screaming at everyone who came near. Guess who? Yep, Judy Garland! The nurses had their hands full with her and her demands to be \"released from this dump\". It seems that Ms. Garland had been brought in the day before unconsious from alcohol. She spent hours on the phone with \"her people\" threatening to fire everyone if they didn't get her out of the \"hell hole\" (Carson City).\n\nWhat an eye opener for me....Dorothy had a mouth that would make a longshore blush!\n\nThanks for those two uplifting stories! JK- Judy did have her issues but she sure brought a lot of joy and happiness to many people. She was known as a very caring and giving soul. I am sure when she was suffering such as the times referenced above- that was not the real Judy and not who Judy would have wanted people to see. She had a life that most of us would not have been able to handle for one year let alone 47.\n\nJudy Garland did for the Movies what Jimi Hendrix did for Rock 'N' Roll. She was over-worked and taken advantage of by so many in her life. I only hope someone is paying DEARLY for the Evil at M.G.M. who pumped her full of drugs to keep her working non-stop for several years. Even though she died in 1969, her Spirit died years earlier from all of the abuse she was forced to endure in her youth. She was an INCREDIBLE talent both in Acting and her Beautiful voice. Yes. Judy deserves BOTH Stars she's received on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and MUCH, MUCH more. She was and IS TRULY missed and LOVED and always will be. There will NEVER be another Judy Garland.\n\nI never had the opportunity to meet this beautiful and talented actress as I was born in SA in 1977 ... But I do remember as a teenager, 1 particular movie that I came on tv ... Meet me in St Louis .... And I was hooked.. .... Since then ...its the classic movies and musicals for me ....which my friends could never understand ... But my family does ... My mum shares my love of these movies ... Sadly they are not available for purchase anymore ... So its a real treat when over christmas time ...we are blessed with a Judy Garland movie ... :) She has made a major impact on my life ...\n\nJudy deserves every star she has in Hollywood and her Family. I have watched Her Family Talk how she felt and treated them and she never let them down that I know of.\n\nI have watched her in the Wizard of OZ for Many years and only recently looked her up because of Shirley Temple and Mickey's Death. I saw her with both of them and wanted to know what Happened to her. I found out she passed away 1969 had two girls and one boy. Liza Minnelli and Lorna loft both were great singers and still are. They learned from there mothers mistakes and corrected it in there own lives. I wish them well. Rest in Peace Judy.\n\nP.S. I can relate in Many of the Problems you may have had with addiction\n\nWhen young, Judy had a wonderful passion and spirit inside her. She was a sensitive, caring, loving girl. She loved and cared about everybody. She carried her passionate, happy spirit through the 30s and early 40s during the times she was making Oz, Babes in arms, Babes on Broadway, Zeigfield girl, Girl crazy, Meet me in St.Louis, and Zeigfield follies. All of them movies where you could see a real love and passion inside her and you could tell she was not just acting. During the late 40s is sadly when her gentle, loving spirit started getting crushed. That was when her drug addiction started taking a toll and thats when she made her first of several suicide attempts. She just kept going downhill after that and by the 60s, she was a tragic mess. Continued suicide attempts, very unstable behavior, and a miserable, crushed spirit. It is so sad, unfair, and heartbreaking how this happened to such a wonderful, beautiful person. Years of MGM treating her so poorly and calling her names like ugly duckling and hunchback and never giving her any confidence. MGM getting her hooked on the drugs by forcing her to keep taking them and having her work too hard for too long, running her into the ground. And then, Judy getting dumped and betrayed by several different men she thought loved her. Judy deserved none of this! However, through all of it, Judy never stopped caring for people and always loved her children, Liza, Lorna, her son, Micky, and all of her fans. Judy Garland was and is a true angel. I hope God is now taking good care of her. And some day when I die, I will see her over the rainbow in heaven and I can tell her how wonderful she is and how much I love her.\n\nDoes Judy Garland deserve a star on the hollywood walk of fame? She deserves about twenty stars!\n\nWhat other stars connected with Judy? Lets see, Micky Rooney, Fred Astair, Van Johnson, Deana Durbin, Margerate O'brien, Gene Kelly, all the other stars from Wizard, her husbands(temporarily), and of course, her children, Liza, Lorna, and Joey.\n\nOther places in the world important to Judy. Besides Hollywood and southern Cal, she loved London, and her birth place, Minnisota.\n\nDid I ever meet Judy in person? Very unfortunately, no. But I wish! I wish! I wish! I would've told her how much I love her. All Judy wanted was to be loved. Telling her I love her would've made her happy. If she's happy, I'm happy. I wish that I'll see her in heaven.\n\nJudy Garland, I love you so much. Judy's body died in 1969 but her soul will live forever. Judy is a true angel. She was sent to earth from God to inhibit the body form of Judy. How else to explain such an amazing, heavenly singing voice. Such beauty and charm. And such a kind, caring, loving person. (just read the website: Judy Garland, too pure for this world.) I know I've written too many comments on her. It's just that my love for her is so pure. I love her like a good christian loves God and Jesus. I love them too. And I believe Judy is a real angel. Her soul was sent down to earth by God in 1922 and returned to heaven in 1969. I've just had this feeling that if I'd have met her in person, we'd have been soulmates. She and Mickey were. But you can have more than one soulmate. I pray we'll be soulmates in heaven. I'll never get tired of watching her movies and hearing her sing with her voice from heaven.\n\nJudy Garland was a wonderful person in every way possible. Her heavenly singing, her beauty, and her kind and loving heart. She got an undeserved reputation for being mentally crazy. Her drug addictions were formed by MGM forcing her to take pills all the time continuously. Her suicide attempts, well, let's just put any other average person in place of Judy and make him/her go through what Judy went through all those years and see how any of them hold up. And Judy still came out pretty freakin well. Just look at all her wonderful films. Her voice of an angel. Her true, loving kindness. Judy's an angel. The most wonderful girl the world ever had the pleasure of knowing. I pray that God is taking the best care of her up in heaven."
