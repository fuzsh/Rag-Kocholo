        "text": "Full Name: Frances Ethel Gumm\n\nProfession: Actress and Singer\n\nBiography: Described by Fred Astaire as \"the greatest entertainer who ever lived\" and renowned for her contralto voice, she will always be synonymous with \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nBorn into a family of vaudeville entertainers, Frances, known as \"Baby\", joined her family's act as part of \"The Gumm Sisters\". A name change and movie contract made her a reliable box-office draw as a teenager, in musicals co-starring Mickey Rooney made her famous.\n\nHer biggest role was as Dorothy in the M-G-M musical adaption of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. She continued in film as an adult, excelling in musical, comedic, and dramatic roles, while also becoming a concert attraction.\n\nWith the advent of television, she found a new field to conquer, as host of her own variety show and storied guest on late-night talk shows.\n\nOver her career, she won an Academy Award, 2 Grammy Awards and Lifetime Achievement plaudits from the Oscar, Grammy, and Tony organizations. Two of three children, daughters Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft, followed her footsteps into the footlights.\n\nRecurrent substance abuse and relationship traumas led to financial distress and her premature death of long-term habitual barbiturate use.\n\nBorn: June 10, 1922\n\nBirthplace: Grand Rapids, Minnesota, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dog\n\nStar Sign: Gemini"
