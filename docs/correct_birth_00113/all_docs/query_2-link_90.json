        "text": "100 years ago this Friday, a star was born — Judy Garland — and Radio Classics (Ch. 148) is celebrating the legendary actor and singer’s centennial with special programming. Listen to a block of the programming below on Friday, June 10, at 8pm ET, or catch it anytime on the SXM App now.\n\nBeloved Movies\n\nGarland was so much more than just Dorothy in the timeless film The Wizard of Oz (1939), and Radio Classics is demonstrating that by kicking off the festivities with audio adaptations of some of her other classic movies. First, tune in to Garland’s beloved Babes In Arms (1939) and can’t-miss Merton of the Movies (1941), both co-starring Mickey Rooney, plus fun-filled For Me and My Gal (1942) featuring Gene Kelly.\n\nVariety Show Appearances\n\nYou’ll hear Garland’s special guest appearances of two of the biggest variety shows of the 1950s and ’60s: The Bob Hope Show and The Danny Kaye Show.\n\n‘Suspense’-ful Show"
