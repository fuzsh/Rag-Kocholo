        "text": "It’s been more than 50 years since Judy Garland’s death, but her legacy is alive and well. Especially in Chittenango which is the birthplace of “Wizard of Oz” writer L Frank Baum.\n\nActress, singer and dancer Judy Garland would have been 100 years old Friday. Her acting in the Wizard of Oz helped make it into the cultural phenomenon it became.\n\nAt the All Things Oz Museum in Chittenango, the space is filled with a number of Oz themed cases. Many of which feature Judy Garland or Dorothy related memorabilia. In one case is Judy Garland’s autograph that she signed when she was in Central New York in 1942. There are also dolls, trinkets and a replica of the dress Judy wore as Dorothy on display.\n\nMORE |\n\nAll Things Oz Museum's mission to keep celebrating the Wizard of Oz’s Central New York connection, which includes Garland’s lasting legacy in pop culture.\n\nMarc Baum, Foundation Secretary at All Things Oz Museum said, “Judy as Dorothy brought everyone in to the Wizard of Oz, she was believable and made it a real place. So the impact of the Wizard of Oz over the years has been that even now people still use quotes from the books and the movies and without Judy Garland as Dorothy I don’t know if it would have been as endearing.”\n\nGarland was celebrated in Chittenango last weekend at Oz-Stravaganza and will be celebrated all weekend long in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota."
