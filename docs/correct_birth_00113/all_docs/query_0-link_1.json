        "text": "Baby Frances joined her sisters in a first song-and-dance routine performed at the Itasca Mercantile, located at the corner of Hwys 169 & 2, “When My Sugar Walks Down the Street.” Her first solo was “Jingle Bells” performed in a white net dress created by her mother at her father’s Grand Theater located on South Pokegama avenue next to the old Rialto Theater. Judy performed throughout North East and North Central Minnesota from 1924-1926.\n\nComedian and emcee George Jessel suggested that she and her sisters change their last name to something more theatrical; he recommended Garland. \" One year later, 1935, \"Frances Garland\" changed her first name to Judy, after the popular song (\"Judy\"), to become Judy Garland.\n\nThe release of \"The Wizard of Oz\" caused a national sensation. Judy received a special Academy Award Juvenile Oscar for \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. It was quickly followed into theaters by an adaptation of the Broadway hit, \"Babes in Arms\", costarring Garland and Rooney. The box office triumphs of Oz and Babes placed Judy among the Top Ten Box Office Stars for 1940.\n\nDuring her career, Judy starred in 30 TV shows, gathering a total of 10 Emmy Award nominations. She also appeared as a guest on nearly 30 other TV shows. Judy fulfilled more than 1,100 theater, nightclub, and concert performances in 18 years from 1951-1969. She received a special Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award for record breaking 1951 Broad engagements at the Palace Theatre in New York City. Judy recorded nearly 100 singles, and over 24 record albums. Her radio work encompassed several hundred broadcasts, and she sang at countless benefits for the Military during WWII. Judy made her final concert appearances in Stockholm, Malmo, and Copenhagen, winning ten-minute standing ovations for each show."
