        "text": "Lumberjacks and legends\n\nGrand Rapids may not be the Emerald City, but its trees are green, and its lakes glitter.\n\nIn northern Minnesota, the logging town of Grand Rapids has produced many legends: prize lumberjacks, such as Gunnysack Pete and Tamarack Joe, but also an adorable little girl who became famous for her ruby slippers.\n\nLoggers came first, and that era is re-created on the edge of town, on the wooded grounds of Forest History Center. On a summer day there, it may feel 80 degrees and sunny, but really it's a freezing day in December 1900.\n\nMiss Minnie the \"cookee,\" or cook's assistant, is showing us around the logging camp under the baleful glare of her boss, Miss Rebecca. We walk by a giant rut cutter, used to make grooves in the ice roads for the logging sleighs.\n\nWe visit Miss Nettie in the clerk's cabin, where loggers buy socks and long johns: \"They don't take them off all winter. If they go in the hospital with a serious injury, sometimes the nurses have to shave them off; the hair just grows right through them.\"\n\nWe visit Miss Rebecca, who hands out freshly baked sourdough biscuits. Miss Rebecca is a very important person here: \"Men choose a camp based on the kind of cook it's got. If the cook's a belly-robber, they won't stay very long.\"\n\nWe visit the bunkhouse and Oscar the bull cook, whose job includes waking up the men: \"Daylight in the swamp!\" he shouts, demonstrating.\n\nThen he breaks character a bit: \"It's been 100 years since daylight came through those trees, and it's our job to cut them down. It's actually not a very good idea, but we think it is.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Historical Society's reconstructed camp is a remnant of the days when magnificent pines blanketed northern Minnesota.\n\nThat is, until men with such names as Weyerhaeuser and Pillsbury put up 300-man camps like this one to clear-cut timber. A year or two later, they'd move on.\n\nThe second part of the story is told at the end of a forest path, on a channel of the Mississippi. There, it's May 1901, the second month of a log drive, and a bargelike shack called a wanigan has moored for the night.\n\nInside, cooks provide for the 30 \"river pigs\" who dance with cleated boots on 130,000 floating logs, positioning them with pike poles or, failing that, dynamite.\n\nToday, lumber â aspen, mostly â still rolls through this town of 8,000, on trucks headed for the downtown paper mill of UPM Blandin, Grand Rapids' largest employer.\n\nGrand Rapids is surrounded by lakes, as well as forests, and it's also part of the Iron Range. But its true lot in life, it seems, is to keep legends alive.\n\nAlong with the lumberjacks, a 4-year-old named Frances Gumm left her mark on the town before her family moved to California in 1926.\n\nBaby Gumm, who loved the spotlight so much her father had to carry her off the stage after her debut singing \"Jingle Bells,\" became Judy Garland.\n\nTwo permanent sites allow fans to immerse themselves in Judy lore any time.\n\nIn the Old Central School downtown, above two floors of shops and a restaurant, the Judy Garland exhibit at the Itasca Historical Museum proves that the star, who can hardly be expected to remember a state she left at age 4, was at least a good sport.\n\nThree times, she posed for photos showing her reading copies of home-state newspapers, and she was quoted in a 1960 interview saying, \"I do know that is the only time I ever saw my mother and father happy, you know, in that wonderful town . . . for such a mixed-up life later, it started out beautifully.\"\n\nThe star's white-frame childhood home has come to rest on donated land just south of town, having been uprooted three times.\n\nThere's a gift shop in back, selling snow globes and miniatures of the famous ruby slippers that were stolen from the museum in August 2005 and finally recovered in 2018.\n\nAt her birthplace, the emphasis is more on Baby Gumm, the darling toddler, and Dorothy, the terrific teen-ager, than on Judy, the sad star who married five times, became addicted to the benzedrine \"happy pills\" the studio provided to help her lose weight and, at 47, died of an overdose of sleeping pills.\n\nFor years, many in the town looked askance at the troubled star. Fans, however, remain as avid as ever.\n\nThey stream in from around the world for the annual Wizard of Oz Festival, trading memorabilia and listening raptly to presentations by historians and those who knew her.\n\nBicyclists also beat a path to Grand Rapids, the western trailhead of the Mesabi Trail. Grand Rapids is known as a paper-mill town, but it's also the westernmost part of the Iron Range.\n\nFrom the Itasca County Fairgrounds, where locals gather on summer evenings to watch stock-car races, a 75-mile stretch of the paved trail winds past lovely mine-pit lakes, wetlands and all the towns and attractions of the Iron Range.\n\nGrand Rapids also is the southernmost point on the Edge of the Wilderness scenic route, the first in Minnesota to be named a National Scenic Byway.\n\nFrom the paper mill, it winds 47 miles northward, past pristine forests, undeveloped lakes and the occasional quiet village.\n\nThe Lind-Greenway Mine, which closed in 1976, is marked by the first of many interpretive displays along this ribbon of asphalt, which locals called \"Highway Loop-de-Loop.\"\n\nOthers mark a black spruce and tamarack bog and the birch stand at Pughole Lake, a good place to slip in a canoe.\n\nSuomi Hills was the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps work camp in 1933 and, a decade later, a prisoner of war camp. Named by its earliest settlersÂ â Suomi is Finnish for \"homeland\" â it's now a Chippewa National Forest recreation area, known for its 21 miles of challenging ski trails.\n\nFarther north, over the Laurentian Divide, a wooden river pig stands with hook in hand outside Bigfork's city hall. Just to the east is Scenic State Park, one of Minnesota's most overlooked parks.\n\nEffie is at the end of the route. It's known for its annual rodeo â and its giant mosquito.\n\nTrip Trips: Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota\n\nGetting there: It's about 3Â½ hours north of the Twin Cities.\n\nAnnual events: July 4, Fireworks over Pokegama Lake.
