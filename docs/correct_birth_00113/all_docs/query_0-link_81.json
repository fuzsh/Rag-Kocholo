        "text": "The Judy Garland and Children's Discovery Museums are two museums that share one space! The Judy side of the museum is dedicated to telling the story of the talented Judy Garland's life and legacy. Her Birthplace home is on the property to tour as well as artifacts from her life and from the beloved Wizard of Oz movie. Most recently added to the Judy Garland Gallery is a quaint video viewing space. With proper funding we will transform this space into a cozy, vintage theater where video clips, interviews with Judy, documentories and movies can be watched and enjoyed by visitors. The Birthplace home is in desperate need of a new roof, windows, and siding repair. We have already raised over $5000 for the Judy Garland Birthplace Home restoration project; help get us to the $25,000 goal! Every little bit helps.\n\nOur Children's Discovery Museum is designed for parents to interact and experience the exhibits with their children so they can help spark curiosity and exploration. Some of the highlights include Treesa the talking tree, a water table with working reservoir, shopping center, engineering room, and Lake Life adventure zone. We have exciting plans to add exhibits and enhance the experience for children but need money to keep the doors open and exhibits coming. We appreciate your donations and will put the funds to good use!"
