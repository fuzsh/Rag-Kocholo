        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS — Lindsey Borges is one among millions of people with vivid memories of watching \"The Wizard of Oz\" on television, \"totally awed\" by the transformation from black and white to color. Despite the Technicolor magic of Oz, when given a choice Dorothy decides to tap her heels and return home.\n\nThat's where Dorothy belongs, and Borges believes the slippers Judy Garland wore in the classic movie should also come home — to the place where Garland was born.\n\n\"They belong here,\" said Borges about the ruby slippers, while visiting the Judy Garland Museum with her family last week. \"This is their rightful place. It would feel weird to have them land anywhere else.\"\n\nFour pairs of sequined shoes seen on Garland's feet in \"The Wizard of Oz\" still exist, according to the director of a documentary about the slippers. One of the pairs is on display at the National Museum of American History, where their popularity ranks alongside that of the original Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nAnother pair, believed to be the one used for close-ups in the movie, has been indelibly associated with the Judy Garland Museum since 2005. That's when the slippers, on loan from collector Michael Shaw, were stolen from the museum in a case that's fascinated true-crime buffs worldwide.\n\nThe slippers were retrieved in 2018, but it wasn't until last year that a Grand Rapids man was charged with the theft. An alleged accomplice was indicted earlier this year, and the FBI returned the slippers to Shaw in a Feb. 1 ceremony at the museum.\n\n\"It was such a surprise,\" said John Kelsch, curator at the museum. \"I didn't know until I walked in the gallery, and there stood Michael Shaw. We gave each other a big hug, after all these years.\"\n\n\"He took them back and immediately turned them over to Heritage Auctions, who is planning to take them on a world tour,\" said Janie Heitz, the museum's executive director. \"Then they will return back to the (United) States and they will have an auction, likely in California in December 2024. There's no set date.\"\n\nThe museum is determined to make a serious bid for the slippers, and support has come from well beyond Grand Rapids. The state of Minnesota has earmarked $100,000 toward the potential purchase. However, Gov. Tim Walz has been rebuked for the triumphal tone he took in a May 30 social media post that declared, \"We're buying Judy Garland's damn slippers.\"\n\nProsecutors valued the slippers at $3.5 million, but they could potentially go for much more at auction. That leaves a gap of millions to be raised by the museum, which had total revenues of less than $500,000 in 2022.\n\n\"We have six months to raise as much money as we can,\" explained Heitz, \"and we can't do it publicly because it's an auction and if we share the dollar amount that we've raised, we will have set the minimum bid.\"\n\nIn the meantime, life goes on at the museum, which has a replica pair in an exhibit about the theft — and even an additional replica sequin, placed on the gallery floor to show where Kelsch found a lost sequin from the actual pair on the day the slippers went missing.\n\n\"It's super important to embrace the situation at this point,\" Heitz said.\n\nFilmmaker Seth Gordon has been to Grand Rapids \"several times\" capturing footage for a documentary about the heist, Heitz noted, and the museum has \"signed preliminary paperwork with a Hollywood producer\" for a feature film that might turn a satirical lens on the situation.\n\nWhile the international attention garnered by the slipper saga has certainly raised the museum's profile, the theft has had serious negative consequences.\n\n\"Nobody wanted to work with us after that. Our credibility was gone,\" said Heitz. \"Museums rely on donations and loans and relationships with each other to have exciting exhibits and collections and archives, and a lot of those opportunities went away after the theft.\"\n\nBefore the theft, Heitz pointed out, the museum, which includes Garland's childhood house, enjoyed a sterling reputation among those who cared about preserving the star's legacy. Shaw loaned his ruby slippers four times, and Grand Rapids enjoyed visits from Garland's Hollywood peers.\n\n\"Mickey Rooney,\" said Heitz, \"best friend of Judy Garland, he came here to Grand Rapids, Minnesota, for the Judy Garland Festival.\"\n\nThat annual event has continued, with this year's festival taking place Thursday, June 20, through Sunday, June 23. In addition to features such as historical presentations, an interactive mystery and a Garland-themed party bus excursion, the festival will include tours recounting the story of the slipper theft. Heitz said she hopes to spread the word about the museum's drive to purchase the shoes.\n\nHeitz said the museum will tell festival attendees, \"This is our goal, and if we want Judy's life and legacy to remain strong, we think this is a great way to do that.\"\n\nSaturday, June 22, will mark 55 years since Garland's death, Heitz noted.\n\n\"To be relevant 55 years after your death is pretty amazing,\" she said. \"And this August will be 85 years since 'The Wizard of Oz' was released. So 85 years, 55 years — that's a really long time.\"\n\nJack Wooten, the museum's 21-year-old intern, can testify to the continuing fascination with Garland. Watching documentaries and reading biographies left the New Jersey resident \"captivated\" by the entertainer's story, and he contacted the museum to see whether there might be \"some room for me there.\"\n\n\"Being in the physical location that she lived in is really special,\" said Wooten. \"She loved her hometown.\"\n\n\"Grand Rapids is the only normal, carefree time in her life that her family ever had,\" said Kelsch, who believes Garland would be \"thrilled\" to see her iconic slippers in Minnesota.\n\nThe public's fascination with the costume shoes exacerbates a curatorial challenge for the museum: telling the full story of a performer who is best remembered for \"Oz\" but who has a much wider legacy.\n\n\"She starred in over 30 feature films,\" said Wooten. \"She performed at Carnegie Hall, the (London) Palladium, gave radio broadcasts. Her career is very extensive. I want people to understand that she was very resilient, and persevered through several troubled times.\"\n\nThe institution also encompasses an entire Children's Discovery Museum, with several different play and learning areas. \"In a rural community of our size, it's pretty hard to have two separate museums to operate,\" Heitz said. \"So the original board of directors chose to put them together.\"\n\nWhile it may seem like a moonshot for a small-city museum to raise millions of dollars in a matter of months, Heitz has learned not to give up. Two years ago, the museum stood to lose an important piece of land. When the situation made headlines, Superior Choice Credit Union unexpectedly contributed $45,000 to secure the plot.\n\nThat land adjoining the museum, now bedecked with photo stand-ins featuring \"Wizard of Oz\" characters, will likely become the site of an Oz-themed miniature golf course. \"That is still in the works,\" said Heitz, \"but I've got a lot on my plate right now. That's been put on the back burner.\"\n\nFurther evidence that you never know who will pop up and take an interest in the Judy Garland Museum came before the institution moved to its present location. In 1979, when the museum was still operating out of the city's Old Central School building, Kelsch said, Bob Dylan paid a surprise visit.\n\n\"At that time, it was just some scrapbooks and one display case on the wall,\" Kelsch said. When a staffer arrived to open the museum for the day, she found Dylan sitting on the building's interior staircase, waiting to take a look. \"We have his name in the guestbook.\"\n\nThe permanent acquisition of the slippers would \"impact all of northern Minnesota,\" Kelsch said. \"Change the map of tourism completely.\"\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity for the state of Minnesota,\" Heitz said. \"This is where Judy Garland started her life, and she had very happy times here. Throughout the whole 'Wizard of Oz' movie, she's trying to find home, and the slippers are the representation of that.\"\n\n\"She appreciated winters here,\" Wooten said. \"She made snow angels.\"\n\n\"You never know who's going to be that next phone call,\" Heitz said about her fundraising hopes. \"Anything's possible, and we'll just stay positive. I truly believe this is going to happen. I just have a feeling that something positive is going to happen for this museum.\""
