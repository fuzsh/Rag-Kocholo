        "text": "Biography\n\nJudy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922 – June 22, 1969) was an actress and singer, her name is ranked the 8th in the list of the greatest movie stars, and the golden age of Hollywood cinema is firmly associated with her. Judy Garland was awarded with Oscar, Golden Globe, Tony and Grammy.\n\nJudy Garland became for Americans a symbol of their happy childhood due to the film narrating about the adventures of Dorothy in the Land of Oz. Nevertheless, her own childhood was rather miserable. The life of the girl was predestined – at the age of two, she began performing on the stage with her older sisters. Her authoritarian mother noted the admiration of public and did everything for developing of her youngest daughter artistic career. Thus, the yellow brick road led Garland to the top of Hollywood Olympus: sixteen-year-old actress won a special junior Oscar for the role of Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\" - one of the most important cult films in Hollywood, and became an idol of all America. The talent, performance and incredible success of Judy Garland was staggering. At her most successful period, she was cast in two full-length films a year, in addition to giving concerts all over the world.\n\nThe girl's physique was rather ordinary, yet she was put on a strict diet to look younger. She used to damp appetite with black coffee and later with cigarettes. She was also constantly given powerful pills so that her body could withstand the extreme emotional and physical stresses.\n\nBetween 1935 and 1950, Judy Garland appeared in more than 30 films. From a charming girl, she turned into a sex symbol. Her roles of daring but feminine heroines, her huge sad brown eyes, small stature and hoarse voice made Judy popular and beloved by the public. Not able to withstand the strain, Judy periodically lost her form, put on weight, disrupted the shooting. Finally, the contract with MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), signed fifteen years ago, was terminated.\n\nIn 1954, Garland returned to the films, starring in “A Star is Born”. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy and was nominated for an Oscar. Later there were other films. Alcohol and drugs appeared in the life of young actress, repeated attempts to build a normal family failed. There was an Oscar for \"Best Supporting Actress\" in the film \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961). In addition, drugs again. Judy Garland died shortly after turning 47. According to the official version, Judy died due to an overdose of sleeping pills and, it would seem, there was no reason to think otherwise -- she had remarried just three months earlier; she still had a contract that gave her a chance to restart her career. However, close acquaintances and her own daughter stuck to the version of the great actress voluntary demise.\n\nThe cemetery in New York State was chosen as the burial place of the star, but in 2017, the remains were reburied in Los Angeles, at the famous resting place of “Hollywood Forever” celebrities, on Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\nMost of the movies in which Judy starred were musical. The directors willingly used both talents of the actress - vocal and artistic. Judy's song \"Over the Rainbow\" is listed at #1 on AFI's 100 Greatest American Movie Songs in 100 Years. Interesting, that 5 more songs performed by Garland were included in the same list. Despite being forgotten at the end of her life, artistry and vocal abilities of Judy Garland are still highly regarded, she is one of the most recognizable actresses of the Hollywood \"Golden Age\"."
