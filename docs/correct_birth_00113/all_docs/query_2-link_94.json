        "text": "Few stars are as emblematic of the Golden Age of Hollywood as Judy Garland. The star, who made her stage debut when she was two and was signed to MGM at 13, was not just part of Hollywood history—she was essential to it, as well as an emblem of the times, for better or worse. This year marks what would have been the legend’s 100th birthday, had she not died in London in 1969.\n\nIf her centennial birthday gives you a burning desire to catch up on old Garland films—and how could it not?—here are nine essential recommendations, from the obvious classics (you know the ones), to the lesser-seen gems.\n\nPigskin Parade\n\nThis film is, in a way, where it all began. At 13 years old, Garland made her feature debut in this 1936 musical comedy, playing a plucky kid sister named Sairy who loves to sing. Though she’s far from the star of the film, Garland easily steals the show during her few musical numbers. Even at 13, Garland had tremendous vocal range, signaling early on that her career was going to head down a different path than that of her peers.\n\nGirl Crazy\n\nEarly in her career, Garland made a string of films with Mickey Rooney, a close friend and fellow vet of the industry. Though there are several films one could choose—*Babes in Arms, Strike Up the Band—Girl Crazy is a good gateway into their oeuvre, a 1943 musical about a philanderer who gets sent out West to get straightened out; there, he meets and quickly falls for a young postmistress (Garland). Come for the chemistry, stay for Garland’s heartbreaking rendition of “But Not for Me.”\n\nThe Clock\n\nThough Garland was mostly known for starring in musicals, The Clock was a noted departure. The 1945 film about a blossoming romance between two perfect strangers (Garland opposite Robert Walker) in New York City was her first drama, as well as the first film in which she did not sing. It was a box office success and was warmly received by critics; “a tender and refreshingly simple romantic drama,” the New York Times declared then. It also had a special personal relevance: The Clock was directed by frequent collaborator Vincente Minnelli, Garland’s second husband and father to Liza.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis\n\nSpeaking of Minnelli, might as well note the first film he directed starring Garland: Meet Me in St. Louis. The Oscar-nominated romantic musical, released in 1944, is one of Garland’s most popular films, starring her as a St. Louis teen whose world is turned upside down when she learns her family might move to New York. Garland is utterly charming in the family film and delivers instant-classic renditions of numbers like “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” Liza Minnelli has said on more than one occasion that it’s her favorite movie. “That’s where my father met my mother and I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for that movie,” she once told the American Film Institute with a hearty laugh.\n\nTill the Clouds Roll By\n\nLet’s roll on over to this star-studded, 1946 Technicolor biopic about composer Jerome Kern (“Ol’ Man River,” “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes”). Garland, who was four months pregnant while shooting it, played Marilyn Miller, the charming, but complicated Broadway legend. The rest of the cast is unbelievably stacked, including Lena Horne, Angela Lansbury, and Cyd Charisse, in addition to Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore playing themselves.\n\nThe Harvey Girls\n\nThis musical often finds itself on best-of-Garland lists, for good reason. Directed by George Sidney, the film revolves around a group of waitresses at a Harvey House restaurant chain in Sandrock, Arizona. Garland plays Susan, a woman who travels to the town to meet a potential beau who does not turn out to be who she thought; she later joins the Harvey girls. The 1946 Western musical was a box office success and took home the best original song Oscar for “On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe,“ this number sung by Garland.\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nIt’s a film she was burning to make after getting fired from MGM, a big, challenging musical about a rising star, impeccably directed by George Cukor. The film, a remake of the 1937 picture of the same name, starred Garland as Esther Blodgett, a gifted singer on the outs. The grueling production is now legendary for the toll it took on Garland and for its $5 million budget, making it the most expensive movie in Hollywood at the time. But it, ultimately, paid off—Garland was nominated for a best-actress Oscar (which she would lose to Grace Kelly in The Country Girl), and Esther become one of her most iconic roles, though it would also be her last major movie.\n\nJudgment at Nuremberg\n\nThe 1961 black-and-white drama, directed by Stanley Kramer (The Defiant Ones, It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World) marked Garland’s last Oscar-nominated performance. It revolved around the 1947 trial against a group of Nazis, and costarred Marlene Dietrich, Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Spencer Tracy, among others. Garland played Irene Hoffman, a witness who speaks at the trial. It’s a stirring, vulnerable performance from Garland, who neatly adapts to the stylized, melodramatic ebbs and flows of the courtroom drama. The film earned her a best-supporting-actress Oscar nomination, though she lost to Rita Moreno in West Side Story.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nWhat’s even left to say about the 1939 fantasy that is not only Garland’s most iconic film, but one of the most iconic and influential films of all time? Better to give Garland the last word: “I’ve always taken The Wizard of Oz very seriously, you know,” she once said. “I believe in the idea of the rainbow. And I’ve spent my entire life trying to get over it.”\n\nOn the Carpet\n\nRenée Zellweger on Playing Judy Garland: “If I Could Have Run Away, I Would Have”\n\nThe Oscar winner calls her role in Judy, which opens September 27, “the most challenging and terrifying role I’ve done.”\n\nNO PLACE LIKE HOME\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: Five Appalling On-Set Stories\n\nIn honor of the film’s 80th anniversary, a look back at a few anecdotes that have not aged as well as the 1939 classic.\n\nHollywood\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Pretty Sure Judy Garland Would’ve Laughed at Lady Gaga’s A Star Is Born\n\n…and that afterward that Minnelli’s late mother “would have gotten into it.”\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nAward Season\n\nIn Conclave, the Pope Dies—Then the Twisty Search for His Successor Begins\n\nRalph Fiennes top lines the new film from the director of All Quiet on the Western Front, a thriller about both a personal and a collective crisis of faith—backed by a brilliant ensemble including Isabella Rossellini, Stanley Tucci, and more.\n\nHollywood\n\nHere: Robert Zemeckis’s New Movie Spans a Century, but the Camera Never Moves\n\nTom Hanks and Robin Wright reunite the Forrest Gump team for a drama set entirely in one household’s living room.\n\nTelevision\n\nEverything We Know About The Bear Season 3\n\nAll episodes of the Emmy-winning series hit Hulu on Wednesday, June 26, at 9 p.m. E.T.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe 25 Best Shows on Netflix to Watch Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to underseen dramatic gems, your next binge is waiting.\n\nStyle\n\nI Taught the Taylor Swift Class at Harvard. Here’s My Thesis\n\nProfessor Stephanie Burt shares what she learned about the singer’s stardom, relatability, and her own course at a college famous for being famous.\n\nBusiness\n\nHow Art Mogul Louise Blouin Lost Her Fabled Hamptons Estate\n\nLouise Blouin lost La Dune, the Hamptons estate where she once entertained Prince Andrew and Calvin Klein, but she’s not letting go quietly."
