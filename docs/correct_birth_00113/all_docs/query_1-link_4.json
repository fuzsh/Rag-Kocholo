        "text": "Background\n\nJudy Garland, born in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, is the last of three children born to Ethel Milne and Frank Gumm. The family moved to California in 1926, where she and her sisters, Virginia and Mary Jane, studied dancing and music. Having learned music and dance, the sisters started performing on stage, changing their band name from the Gumm Sisters in the late 1920s to the Garland Sisters in 1934.\n\nAt 13 years, Garland signed a movie contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M.G.M.) and recorded her breakthrough film, “Wizard of Oz,” in 1939. For Garland, working with M.G.M. was yet another tough obstacle. She was criticized for her appearance, and amphetamine-based diet pills were prescribed to her. Because of such early exposure to illegal substances, she became a drug user and was in constant battle with her new life of substance abuse. After filming “Wizard of Oz,” she went on to make more musicals, including “Babes of Broadway” in 1942 and “For Me and My Gal” in 1943. She then lost the contract with M.G.M. because of her emotional crisis. But on the journey to rebuild her career, she earned a Tony Award and later got nominated for an Academy Award for her performance of the song ‘The Man That Got Away,’ in the 1954 musical “A Star Is Born.”\n\nGarland was married four times before eventually marrying Mickey Deans a few months before her death. All her marriages ended in divorce, and she gave birth to three children, Liza Minnelli, Lorna Luft, and Joey Luft. While facing severe financial and mental struggles, Garland died of an accidental overdose in London in 1969."
