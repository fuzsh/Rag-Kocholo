She received Grammy Awards for Best Solo Vocal Performance and Album of the Year for her classic “Judy at Carnegie Hall” the same year. Despite her enormous skill as a vocalist, these were her only Grammys.\n\nEntry into Television: From 1963 to 1964, Garland hosted “The Judy Garland Show” on television.
