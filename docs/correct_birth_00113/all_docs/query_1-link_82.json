        "text": "If there were a real world “Wizard of Oz,” one wish for fans of the famous movie would be to bring Judy Garland back to life.\n\nBut that can’t be done, and with June 22 marking the 55th anniversary of Garland’s death, all fans can do is turn back the clock and remember the life of the woman who played one of the most iconic characters in cinema history: Dorothy.\n\nWhile always best-known for her role as Dorothy, Garland appeared in several movies and also starred on “The Judy Garland Show” in 1963-64.\n\nIf Garland were still alive, she would be 102 and probably still fielding a bunch of questions about “The Wizard of Oz,” which in August will celebrate the 85th anniversary of its release.\n\nBut just as a fictional tornado swept through Dorothy’s town in the movie, Garland’s real life was also full of twists and turns, despite her fame and all-time place in movie lore.\n\nBelow are five facts of note about Garland’s life as the world acknowledges the 55th anniversary of her death.\n\nGarland’s name change\n\nGarland was born Frances Ethel Gumm in 1922, but she and her sisters changed their name from the Gumm sisters to the Garland sisters in 1934. It is suggested on judygarlandmuseum.com that the name change came after a comedian suggested they have a last name that was more theatrical.\n\nGarland also changed her first name to Judy based on a song.\n\nGarland as the third choice\n\nLouis B. Mayer, studio chief of MGM, which helped produce “The Wizard of Oz,” originally wanted Shirley Temple to be cast in the role of Dorothy, but it didn’t happen. Actress Deanna Durbin was approached next but couldn’t do it, and Garland was cast in the role of Dorothy.\n\nNeedless to say, it all worked out.\n\nStruggles with drugs, alcohol and finances\n\nWhether it was because of early fame or other factors, sadly, Garland struggled with a variety of issues in her personal life. She owed thousands in back taxes to the IRS and had a lien placed on her home in Brentwood, California.\n\nGarland also had problems with alcohol and drug abuse, and died June 22, 1969, in London of what was reportedly a barbiturate overdose. Her death was ruled an accident on her death certificate.\n\nMarital issues\n\nGarland was married five times in her life, including to nightclub manager Mickey Deans at the time of her death. She had also wed David Rose, Vincente Minnelli, Sidney Luft and Mark Herron.\n\nHer remains were transferred across the country.\n\nIn January 2017, at the insistence of her three children, two of whom are actresses Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft, Garland’s remains were disinterred from Ferncliff Cemetery in New York and moved to Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles."
