We had a fun photo op with some “ruby slippers”. Which was the one thing I was excited about—seeing one of the original Ruby slippers.  To my surprise we learned that the ruby slippers had been STOLEN! in 2005. They were recovered 12 years later. \n\nThe museum is also connected to a gift shop and Children’s Discovery Museum. \n\nHere’s some interesting facts we learned about this singer/actor:\n\n🌟appeared in 30 TV shows, gathering a total of 10 Emmy Award nominations.\n\n🌟recorded 100 singles, and over 24 record albums\n\n🌟 won a Perry (Tony) Award for record breaking 1951 Broad engagements at the Palace Theatre in New York City.\n\n🌟married 5 times.\n\n🌟Liza Minnelli is Judy’s daughter.\n\n🌟attempted suicide at least 20 times.\n\n🌟died of a barbiturate overdose in the bathroom of her London residence on June 22, 1969.\n\nAdmission: $12 (under 12 $10)\nHours: Wed-Sat 9:00-5:00\n\n@ourmobilejourney \n\nAnyone else a Wizard of Oz or Judy fan?\n\n#judygarland #judygarlandmuseum #judygarlandhome #judygarlandfan #grandrapidsmn #rubyslippers #rubyslippers👠 #wizardofozfan #wizardofozcollection #minnesotamuseums #minnesotaexplored #exploreminnesota #museumlovers #upnorthmn #minnesotatravelers\".",
