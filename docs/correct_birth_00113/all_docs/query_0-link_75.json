        "text": "Through The Years – The Judy Garland Story was originally going to be completed by the end of the Judy Garland Centennial in 2022, but that didn’t happen. However, I will continue adding new pages until the story of Judy’s life and career is complete in this section.\n\nThis section features pages devoted to presenting a unique interactive overview of Judy’s amazing life and career – through the years.\n\nTo open, we naturally start at the beginning of Judy’s life journey in her birthplace of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. This page ends just before the momentous year of 1935 and her fateful audition with MGM.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at Judy’s life, there is no shortage of biographies about her that can be found at any online retailer that sells books. Some are out of print but can be purchased on eBay and other auction or used book sites. Recommendations:\n\nGet Happy – The Life of Judy Garland by Gerald Clarke – Well-written in-depth biography about Judy’s entire life.\n\nJudy and I – My Life With Judy Garland by Sid Luft and Randy L. Schmidt – This book brilliantly focuses on Judy’s life with her third husband Sid Luft and her post-MGM years.\n\nJudy Garland the Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Legend by Scott Schechter – Literally a day-by-day timeline of everything Judy did in her life and career.\n\nAs 1934 came to a close, 12-year-old Frances Gumm (Judy Garland) was a seasoned show business professional. She had already performed in hundreds of stage shows that ran the gamut from family shows on the stage of her father’s movie theaters to professional Vaudeville engagements across the Midwestern and Western United States. At the end of 1934 she had also made her film debut (being featured in no less that four film shorts at eight years old) and had already appeared on many radio programs. A seasoned pro indeed!\n\nWith a big voice and natural almost inhuman talent that was far beyond her years, she was regularly stopping the show in such “big time” venues as San Francisco’s Golden Gate Theater and Grauman’s Chinese Theater and the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles, among others.\n\nJudy wasn’t literally “born in a trunk” but she might as well have been. Like many of her peers, she was born into a show business family. Her parents were Vaudevillians and at the age of 2 1/2 little Frances Gumm (Judy) joined her two older sisters in the family act. It was the beginning of one of the most unique and legendary careers in all of show business history.\n\nThe information featured here presents highlights from Judy’s early life and career. These are the years that gave her the foundation to become the legendary icon that she is today. As we celebrate the centenary of her birth (June 10, 1922), scroll down to see, hear, and enjoy the story of these fascinating early years.\n\nFor even more details and photos be sure to visit the “On this Day” section of the Judy Garland News & Events blog. Every day of the year and every year of Judy’s life and career are presented in great detail with tons of photos, newspaper clippings, media, and more!\n\nThe family spent the rest of 1926 in Los Angeles before moving to Lancaster, California, in March 1927. At that time the town was over an hour’s drive from LA. Frank bought the Lancaster Theater and became the manager.\n\nThe moved proved lucrative for the girl’s show business careers, especially Judy’s, being so close to the action in Hollywood. The sisters began performing locally and around the Los Angeles area thanks to Ethel’s persistence. They enrolled in the Meglin Kiddies school for professional children. That association increased their visibility and kept them busy. By the end of 1928, Frances was regularly performing solos and sometimes stopping the shows. Of the Meglin Kiddies’ Christmas show at Loew’s State Theater in Los Angeles, the “Los Angeles Record” stated about Judy’s solo on “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love,” “We have no names with which to lay tribute to. One small miss shook these well-known rafters with her songs a la Sophie Tucker.” Frances was already being singled out as a Baby Sophie Tucker or a Baby Nora Bayes.\n\nJudy Garland’s film debut!\n\nFrom June 11 through June 13, 1929, Judy and her sisters (The Gumm Sisters) made their first appearance on film. They were featured in the short The Big Review produced my Mayfair Pictures, Inc. and filmed at the Tec-Art Studios in Hollywood. The trio sang “That’s The Good Old Sunny South” (see video).\n\nBeginning in the third quarter of 1928, the career of the trio was burgeoning past the local level, thanks to their association with the Meglin Kiddies Profession School as well as mom Ethel’s determination. The girls debuted on radio in August 1928 on KFI Radio’s “The Kiddies Hour” (aka “The Children’s Hour”) broadcast out of Los Angeles. They performed on the show on a regular basis through October 1928.\n\nIn March 1929, Ethel rented an apartment at 1814 1/2 South Orchard, near Washington Boulevard and Vermont Ave which was near the Los Angeles theater district. The move was to better serve the girls’ stage career now that they had begun to establish themselves. Frank stayed in Lancaster managing the movie theater.\n\nIn November and December 1929 (the exact dates are unknown), the sisters were a part of “The Vitaphone Kiddies” in three “Vitaphone Varieties” film shorts for Warner Bros.: A Holiday in Storyland, The Wedding of Jack and Jill, and Bubbles. The first two were released in 1929 and although the footage is lost the audio remains (thanks to the Vitaphone disc system) which includes Judy’s very first film solo, “Blue Butterfly.” The footage for the third, Bubbles was found in the 1990s and features a nice close-up of Judy during her solo bit singing “The Land of Let’s Pretend.”\n\nPhoto below: A promotion photo of The Gumm Sisters in their costumes from The Big Revue.\n\nThe early 1930s was a busy time for Judy and her family. She and her sisters, as “the Gumm Sisters,” continued their association with the Meglin Kiddies as well as new partnerships with “Big Brother Ken” (who sponsored children’s radio and stage shows during which the Gumm Sisters were often featured) and Maurice Kusell, another impresario of children’s acts who also had a studio that specialized in training professional show business children. This sisters were a part of his shows as well.\n\nThe experience Judy gained as a result of these associations was invaluable. She wasn’t performing every now and then, she was performing almost weekly in multi-night or week-long (or longer) engagements. Although she was almost always part of a bigger groups of kid performers in these shows, with or without her sisters, she was regularly stopping shows with her solos.\n\nThis was the era when movie theaters featured live acts which created a high demand for talent. Children’s shows were extremely popular. Judy’s natural gifts and incredible musical instincts allowed her to soak in all of that experience and craft like a sponge. As a performer she learned and retained more in these five or six years than most, and that stored knowledge came in handy when she returned to the stage full time in 1951, after her MGM years\n\nPhoto below: The Gumm Sisters, 1933.\n\nBy 1934, Frances Gumm was well known on the Vaudeville circuit on the West Coast. As noted, she was regularly stopping the show with her personality and her voice. It was clear who the real star of the trio was, which from all accounts didn’t bother Judy’s two older sisters, Suzy and Jimmie.\n\nDue to the maturity of Judy’s voice (one reviewer had actually mistaken her for a “small woman” not believing a kid could sing like that), the highlight of their act was Judy sitting on the top of a piano a la Helen Morgan, with a tight pin spotlight on her face. She would sing Morgan’s torch song “Bill” from the Kern/Hammerstein musical “Showboat.” When the house lights came up at the end of the song, the applause usually turned to gasps from the audience who assumed they were watching a young woman, not a 12-year-old girl.\n\nListen to Judy’s version of “Bill” as she performed it in dozens of shows here:\n\nhttps://www.thejudyroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-Bill.wav\n\nThis was Judy’s first studio recording, made on March 29, 1935, as a test for Decca Records, with mom Ethel at the piano. More about that recording here.\n\nThe newly christened Garland Sisters finished out 1934 on a high note. Their week-long appearance at Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood (November 1 through 7), generated their fourth review from “Variety” which read in part, “As a trio, it means nothing, but with the youngest, Frances, 13 (sic), featured, it ops into class entertainment; for if such a thing is possible, the girl is a combination of Helen Morgan and Fuzzy Knight … she handles ballads like a veteran, and gets every note and rod over with a personality that hits audiences. For comedy, she effects a pan like Knight, and delivers her stuff in the same manner as the comic. Nothing slow about her on hot stuff, and to top it off, she hoofs [dances].”\n\nClearly Judy’s “triple threat” genius was already on very much on display. Every reviewer who wrote about any engagement that she and/or her sisters were a part of heaped praise on Judy, always singling her out. She was creating a name and reputation as a first class performer which was no small feat considering the large number of kid/teen stage performers at that time.\n\nOn December 8, 1934, the Garland Sisters took part in in “Irving Strouse’s Sunday Nite Vaudeville Frolics” at the Wishire-Ebell Theater in Los Angeles, billed at the “Garland Trio.”\n\nThe “Los Angeles Times” mentioned the sisters in their article about the show relocating up to San Francisco and the Curran Theater. What’s notable is the fact that Judy had become well known enough for the paper to single her out and assume readers knew what Judy doing “several solos” meant: “The three Garland sisters will sing new songs, and Francis [sic] Garland, the youngest, will again do several solos.”\n\nThe San Francisco engagement opened on Christmas Day. Wood Soanes of the “Oakland Tribute” predicted big things for Frances Garland:\n\n“Of the group (‘January Frolics’) the Garlands have the best novelty. They consist of three girls with mother at the piano and they sing. But the virtue of their performance lies in the talent of the youngest, little Frances.”\n\n“I loathe child actors, particularly in vaudeville, but this youngster sings a song called, I think, ‘Night and Day’ in a fashion that would do justice to a Helen Morgan. Little Frances will undoubtedly go places – but not with mama and sisters Virginia and Mary Jane.”\n\nEighteen years later on May 25, 1952, Soanes reviewed Judy’s return to the Curran and was reminded of his 1934 prediction. He sure called it!"
