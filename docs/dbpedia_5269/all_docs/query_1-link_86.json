S High School Makes the most sense The name of the school should remain the same.\n\nPaul Hatcher High School\n\nI am a ‘94 graduate of Lee. I always wondered why we weren’t Staunton HS like ALL of the other schools around us. No one can argue if you name your high school after your city. What other choice is there? None of the other choices make any sense. I lettered in two sports while at Lee. Both of my letters are ‘S’. I urge the board to make the sensible decision. Staunton High School was the earlier name. It was the name when my grandparents attended. It also is not controversial but while also indicating its location. He was my pe coach and always a wonderful teacher. He was kind and encouraging. He also took our Basketball team to state. I have never heard anyone say a bad thing about him.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\nbecause I like those names and I am going to the high school next year\n\nCourage or Justice High\n\nTakes courage and u listened to the people and to teach the kids todday no matter what u do in life have courage everyday to follow your dreams and to let them know that your community is behind u all the way. when u leave that school u will know to treat people with dignity and respect for yourself and others, not by the color of their skin.. no hate .we cannot erase the past but we can change today, we canstart now\n\nN/A\n\nI think Shenandoah Valley High School or Staunton High School are more encompassing and show the area in which the students live in and come from.

There used to be one in Page County. It became an elementary school in the 1960's. There was a school in Bath County called \"Valley High School\" until the merger in the 1970's.. The term \"Shenandoah\" is or Native American Origins. There are several \"versions\" of the Word. From a marketing standpoint, Shenandoah would be better than Shenandoah Valley because people would eventually shorten the term anyway and call it Shenandoah. Basically, Shenandoah is a prettier word and is known throughout the world. There is my one and only opinion.

Out of all the teachers I had growing up in Staunton. Coach T is the only one that stands out. He was a great coach!! He is missed dearly!!

It is also a unique name that stands out much more than names such as Staunton High School. Shenandoah was my favorite but Queen City was a close second Historical figure out of the names it sounds the best Why waste the money changing the name when you can keep the name and use on something important like fixing the school That is what has happened The color goes with it It makes sense to use the original name rather than manufacture additional names. It was a previous name of the school To honor the City of Staunton. It is not political and it sounds good. Revolutionary war patriot so you still got the hero/fighty thing, plus founder of Staunton. Popular name among friends The school was originally Staunton High School, so I’m hoping that name will be chosen. However, it would be fine to have the school named after Lew Dewitt, with the mascot being the Rocker. It's stately, references Staunton historical roots, and has a nice \"feminine power\" ring to it. .\n\nThere is no reason to change it. It is part of history. When you try to erase history, it does have a way of repeating itself. I grew up in this area and cant believe this is even happening. Furthermore, changing it, you may as well change the city name, and change our capitols name. This is a waste of the city's money. We could use it on so Leave the name alone, don't many other BETTER, Needed, and change it at all productive things!\n\n24477\n\nKristie\n\nAltis\n\n22802 24401\n\nPatricia Chris\n\nAlvarez Ammons\n\nSnowflake High School Staunton High School Staunton High School\n\nQueen City High School\n\n24054\n\nLaTonya\n\nAnderson\n\nShenandoah Valley High School\n\n22801 24402\n\nChristian Michaela\n\nAnderson Anderson\n\nQueen City High School Queen City High School\n\n24401\n\nKristen\n\nAnderson\n\nQueen City High School\n\nBarack Obama High School\n\nNone.

Lee\n\nHS formerly known as R E Lee HS\n\nIt doesn’t resemble a confederate general who was involved in the keeping of slaves, but simply is just “Lee”, which has no relation to him. Additionally, the school can save money on the changing of jersey’s, and other school affiliated items with Lee printed on them. Such a brave and Noble man, who has gotten no recognition.

It’s unique and different Don’t care for any of these. Staunton is a City and most of these sound like a County name. There is already a Staunton River High School and Charlotte, NC claims the title of Queen City. Simple an causes no problems Simple, basic, original name...and n/a HOPEFULLY NON OFFENSIVE based on a true american hero that john podesta hs deserves to be remembered Because it should stay the name it already is and quit trying to change ROBERT E.

It will always be Lee High to me. Maybe we could just name it Lee High which would associate it to a person’s name.\n\nStaunton High School\n\nN/A Statler High\n\nNo one has wanted to change the name of our city so Staunton High School should be a safe name that want cause any hurt. Because you cant change everything just to please certain butthurt people that will never be happy with the world. Sounds güd It is the only choice, Staunton High School\n\nI grew up in Staunton and went to RE Lee all four years. It wasn't until I found out the name had been changed from Staunton HS to RE Lee just after integration that I was excited about a name change. The US is not the same country and Staunton is not the same town we were in the 1960s. I think a little hospitality is called for in this season. Also, just for fun, if you named the school Queen City HS, you could call the football team \"Parliament,\" which just sounds baller, as the kids would say. —Trent Anthony, 34, Raleigh, N.C. resident, working in Christian ministry.

Personally I don't want my personal property and real estate taxes that I paid to the city of Staunton to go up because someone else other than me decided that we need this. I'm sure that is of no concern to them, it is quite easy to spend other people's money. Had the taxpayers been allowed a vote on this none of this would even be an issue. It represents the beautiful valley so everyone should be happy -- which will never happen -- there are a lot who will NEVER be happy!\n\nQueen City High School\n\n24401\n\nNobody in staunton has a problem with Coach Hatcher. He was Lee High and his name on the school would be a bridge between those who are for and those who oppose the name change. And I think he really deserves it!

Perfect & simple Only one that felt kinda right not a fan of any of them, honestly\n\n\"Shenandoah High School\" or \"Shenandoah Valley High School\" ties the name to the land and to a place we all share. The name \"Shenandoah\" is Native American in origin; using this name for our high school also pays homage to the true native population of the land where Staunton now exists. Both of the names \"Shenandoah High School\" and \"Shenandoah Valley High School\" rely on timeless meanings, transcending present and future political framings. \"Staunton\" is clear, accurate, and noncontroversial. appropriate\n\nShenandoah Valley High School\n\nShenandoah Valley High School\n\nJohn Lewis was the Junior High on that site previously. John Lewis was prominent settler in the Staunton area This area was the frontier for a few hundred years. Even if you change the name residents will say “Lee” or “the Old Lee High School”. It will help save the school system money because they won’t have to purchase all new uniforms, etc. for students as most already say Lee on them. They just sound good All sound pretty decent to a Lee alumnus It’s original\n\nStaunton Famlee High School Once your famlee your always FamLee\n\nLee high school\n\nI like returning to the historic name, the specificity of place it gives, and the potential of the \"Staunton Royals\" for mascot/theme Best option to represent all of our community. Because I live in Staunton and I graduated from that high school. I don't understand why we have to change the name Cause it’s dumb we changed the name in the first place Grauraded from Robert E Lee High School\n\n24401\n\nAidan\n\nArtley\n\n24401 24401 24401 24401 22939 22802\n\nStephen Tish David Austin Ryan Daniel\n\nArtman Ashby Ashmore Atkinson Aud Austin\n\n24401\n\nCraig\n\nAustin\n\nLegacy High School Shenandoah High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nQueen City High School Bragg High School Shenandoah High School Queen City High School Queen City High School\n\nRyan Aud High School\n\nValley High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nI actually like all the suggestions. Adding 'United' to the name drives home the purpose of removing Lee from the building, especially after the year we have been through with folks being divided on the issue. Plus chanting \"Staunton United\" at sporting Staunton United High School events would sound awesome! R E Lee Best alternative! We live in the city of Staunton; therefore, the name should reflect our city. Regional, appropriate It makes the most sense You should’ve picked a name before voting to change it from RE LEE!!! Bc you all have no brains!!! I like Queen City Nice ring, apolitical It’s unique and sounds very cool Robert E Lee History Save the name Nope It just sounds nice I lik Because that is the only reason the Cry Baby High name was to be changed anyway Beautifully reflects the city Sensible Actual history of the town Because without using a name, it would cause less discord than what has N/A already happened Simple\n\nStaunton High School Staunton High School\n\nI believe that was the name of the school prior to being changes to RE Lee History\n\n24401 24401\n\nHeidi John\n\nAustin-Cook Avoli\n\nStaunton High School Staunton High School\n\n24401 24401 24401\n\nKaty Chris Chris\n\nAvoli-Miller Aycock Aycock\n\nStaunton High School Staunton High School Staunton High School\n\n24421 24401 22980 22812 24401 22815 24401\n\nH Siobhan Angelina Heather Leah Becky E\n\nB B B B B B B\n\n24401 24401 24401 24401\n\nCryer Angela Laura Jillian\n\nBaby Back Back Bader\n\n24401 24401\n\nTazia Karen\n\nBady Baer\n\n24401 24477\n\nIsaac Melanie\n\nBagley Baikey\n\n24401\n\nJeremy\n\nBailey\n\nStaunton High School Queen City High School Queen City High School Shenandoah Valley High School Queen City High School Queen City High School\n\nQueen City High School Queen City High School\n\nShenandoah Valley High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nStaunton High School Staunton High School Staunton High School\n\nQueen City High School\n\nQueen City High School\n\nLegacy keeps the main L and can be cost efficent to staunton.

I may be a white female, but a name like Robert e lee is outdated and inappropriate. May even make some students uncomfortable. 2, 3 and 5 are too generic and don't add to an identity. I like Queen City but it doesn't feel right either. It is the high school of Staunton. Since the city of Staunton only has one high school, it seems that the name of the city is appropriate. Francis Collins is a Staunton native who has done wonderful things for the community and science. I like queen city better than the other names I think both of these words are positive, not based off of a person and these are things we want our students to emulate as they go through school and gain their independence and education. !st black asst. principal after intergration Least offensive to those sensitive That is the original name prior to being renamed for R.E.

Changing the name of a building wont change someones heart!!!! It's the city of Staunton. Stay with what is obvious Anything but Staunton High School Historic name of school, simple, to-thepoint, factual. . Because it's a good name\n\nStaunton identifies the school with the city which is important not only locally by in media beyond our area, to visitors and new citizens, on college applications and other submissions. The other suggestions: Queen City is not as widely recognized as Staunton; there is already a Valley Vo Tech, and a town and county each named Shenandoah, which may cause unnecessary confusion. There should be no controversy over Staunton as it refers to place or person except the long dead Lady Staunton. Shenandoah has been overused as a way to describe the general area and is already the name of a university in Winchester. To make Staunton stand out as being the progressive City it is, I think Queen City is very fitting. Thank you\n\nStaunton High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nUlysses S.

Because he was great i like it Nice ring to it It is the most logical and not too generic. Many other local high schools would qualify as Shenandoah, Valley etc. Also, using the town's nickname to name the high school is ridiculous.\n\nStaunton High School\n\nQueen City High School\n\nStaunton has a rich history, worth celebrating. So, too, did Robert E Lee and he was celebrated long enough. I'd only wish that there would always be reference to those of us proud Leemen who preceded the change in name.

I believe it represents our town and the history. Also believe it makes the school relative to the city. Plus you cannot say the Queen City Ducks (ducks because of Gypsy Hill and the football stadium.) doesn't sound amazing. Thank you for your time.Sincerely a former student and graduate. Robert E Lee High School is my first choice.\n\nQueen City High School\n\nJust cause Because we shouldn't change history. It's part of the past. Original name; very clear where it’s located I believe we need to keep the name - it should not be changed unless a vote by all Staunton citizens indicates a majority want it changed. This is too important to let 0a small number decide. More appropriate option I don’t think it should be changed but myself along with many other Lee graduates and future graduates don’t get a say. Obama high It used to be Staunton High School, so at least there is some history involved in that name choice. Because it’s in Staunton It’s the best name ever\n\nQueen City High School Queen City High School\n\nPaul Hatcher Highschool\n\nStaunton High School is about as standard and simple as it gets.

It was a difficult political decision as many favored leaving the school at its original site, despite many physical limitations of that site and the cost of renovating the building. Mr. Frank's consolidation of the two junior high schools and converting the Lewis Jr. High into a \"new\" Lee High proved to be a wise decision. Two other city schools are named for former superintendents: Shelburne Middle and Thomas McSwain Elementary. I can think of no one more deserving. I urge you to name your high school Kenneth B.

Please do not choose a person to name the school after, they almost never hold up. A descriptive name, like \"Endeavor High School\" could also work. It is aspirational, both current and forward looking. This name is Staunton-specific & is not controversial. 1. Old name and 2,3. Local History Accurate representation of the community. He graduated from Lee and worked on the Human Genome Project queen city high sounds good and Staunton high I like too.

Staunton is proud to be called Queen City so I think that we should use the name Queen City High School. The name is also unbiased, and pleasant. The name will also age well throughout the years and will likely never be changed again, saving tax payer dollars from having to ever change the name again. To represent our town and the history of staunton Because that was the former name and should have never been changed Strong, female educator born and raised in Staunton To bring everyone together There is a Staunton River High School in Moneta, VA. Staunton Booker Lee High School is a joining of the names of the former black & white high schools. I've lived in Staunton for 25 yrs. I grew up in Waynesboro. My 2 children went to Lee. If we lose the name Lee, all together, we lose our identity. It represents our city and the history of or town I think it fits this area very well. it would fit the school very, and people would take great pride in having such a unique name\n\nGood name\n\nCould you name it after the first superintendent? That way you honor a person who had a vested interest in the education of the citizens of Staunton. Not majorly in favor of the change due to the expense involved. I also see it as a part of history and I am an educator and advocate Lee was an amazing supporting the education of Staunton’s Virginian. citizens. Keep the colors.

They too were slave owners so, it would be political incorrect to name the school after a female slave owner. When it comes down to things being named after slave owners this has opened my eyes that the city of Staunton should be renamed bc it offends me & others knowing Rebecca Staunton was a slave owner.\n\nLEE HIGH SCHOOL\n\nStaunton High School Queen City High School Queen City High School\n\nLee\n\nStaunton High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nQueen City High School\n\nDonald J.

The school board are idiots. Location based - all inclusive.\n\nStaunton High School\n\nStaunton High school fits and won’t offend anyone. Ronald Reagan High because he was a great American, he loved the country, and he was great president. Albeit there was nothing wrong with Lee high.\n\nRobert E.

Remember history Nice ring to it I chose this name because I feel it represent the downtown Staunton.\n\nThere's no sense in spending tax payer money to rename the school! Donald Trump saved me from getting Donald J. Trump High School mugged. That's what it was named before... \"no name change\" because I pay the taxes here. should remain Robert E Lee It makes the most sense with rebranding and its what the students Lee High School want. I think in these times a message of Unity High School unity would be nice.\n\nStaunton High School\n\nQueen City High School\n\nCalling it just Lee would make the most sense. Everyone knows it by that name. Uniforms would have to be changed and money spent that is unnecessary Keep it Lee but drop the association of Robert E. Simple bc it’s queen city\n\nI like Queen City and Staunton High School.\n\nI'd prefer the school be named for a local figure who represents academic achievement, advancement of knowledge, and significant contributions to humanity. Queen City High School sounds cool and says something about our history. And Staunton High School is simple and makes sense just because its our city we live in.\n\n24401\n\nJay\n\nChisley\n\nQueen City High School\n\n24401 24401\n\nDaytyia Rick\n\nChisley Chittum\n\nQueen City High School\n\n22401\n\nChris\n\nChris\n\nIt just sounds good sense we gotta change the name I think this sounds really good as a school and its everyehere around staunton. It’s the best description. General Thomas J Stonewall Only right.

You are only changing the name because you are afraid of political image. This is shameful.\n\nJohn Lewis High School Staunton City high school staunton city high Shenandoah Valley Prepatory Academy\n\nJohn Lewis- to restore that building back to it's original name. Shenandoah Valley High - it is generic enough to hopefully not hurt anyone while at least acknowledging what area of the state it is in. It the best choice cause our city Names that can represent the entire community\n\n24401 24401 24401\n\nPat Steven brayden\n\nClaffey Claiborne clark\n\n24401\n\nLee\n\nClark\n\n22849\n\nGabrielle\n\nClark\n\nT.J.

Not to mention his firm lasted over a hundred years with his sons and grandsons running it. Because I like the sound of it They represent the area\n\nQueen City High School Queen City High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nShenandoah Valley High School Staunton High School Queen City High School Shenandoah High School\n\nRobert e Lee .

And also, it's a neutral name... Hopefully by doing so, it will cause fewer disagreements/less resentment from those who wish to see it remain R.E. Lee. I see no reason for prolonging this issue/disagreement by trying to decide on another person to name it after. Staunton High School...it just seems the \"fairest\" choice for both sides of the debate. Frances Collins HighSchool ROBERT E LEE\n\nThe first was the original name Shouldn't be changed\n\nnone\n\nAll other City schools in the area go by the locality name might as well do same for Staunton since people are overly sensitive and we can't keep the one it has had for decades. You do realize you can't erase history, right?\n\n22980\n\nHeather\n\nClark\n\n24401\n\nAnne\n\nClarke\n\nStatler High School\n\n24401\n\nMark\n\nClarke\n\nStatler High School\n\n24401\n\nJerry\n\nClarke\n\n24401\n\nShawn\n\nClatterbaugh\n\n24401\n\nSamantha\n\nClatterbaugh\n\n24401\n\nKyle\n\nClayville\n\n24401\n\nAndrew\n\nClem\n\n24401\n\nCatharine\n\nClem\n\n24441\n\nShannon\n\nClem\n\n24401\n\nDottie\n\nClem\n\nStaunton High School\n\nStaunton High School\n\nFrancis Collins High School\n\nN/A\n\nWho doesn’t love our Statler Brothers? Honored native Representatives of Staunton. Best name from limited selection offered.\n\nStaunton High School\n\nBecause changing the name was the most ignorant idea that the school board could’ve possibly voted to pass. It’s wasting resources and cash flow that could be spent actually providing education for students. And myself and 75% of the biting citizens will remember this when elections for school board officials come around. Cause y’all stupid for changing it. nobody cares It sounds like a good name instead of the other. It's the historic name of the school, something everyone can agree on.\n\nStaunton High School\n\nQueen City HS draws on Staunton's past as the Queen City and is more interesting than Staunton HS. It also gives more character to the school. I suggest not naming the school for an individual at this time due to the contentious times the community has just been through. Thanks for you"
