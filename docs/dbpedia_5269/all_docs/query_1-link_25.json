FEDERAL VOLUME 37 RESERVE BULLETIN October 1951 NUMBER 10 THE CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS SITUATION Changes in production and sales of consumer durable goods have been important influences on over-all business developments since mid-1950. Very high rates of buying reached during the second half of 1950, accompanied by sharply advanced levels of production, were followed in the first half of 1951 by marked declines in consumer purchases. Output, although reduced after March, continued above retail sales and there was a rapid accumulation of inventories. Since mid-1951 production of consumer durable goods has been curtailed considerably further, owing partly to reduced availability of materials. At the same time retail sales have picked up moderately and inventories have shown some reduction. Production and inventories of various consumer nondurable goods have also been reduced from earlier peak levels. These shifts since the early part of the year have occurred at a time when personal incomes—reflecting expanding defense and capital equipment programs —have continued to rise moderately and have been high in relation to total retail sales, as shown in the chart. Manufacturers' list prices of most consumer goods have been maintained at the ceiling levels established in January. Wholesale price ceilings on new passenger automobiles were raised in March and again in September and now average 8 per cent higher than in January. There have been extensive OCTOBER 1951 promotions of goods at special prices, however, and these have been a factor in stimulating consumer buying during recent months. Unit purchases of durable goods and apparel have probably increased somewhat more than the dollar volume of retail sales. In the case of foods, buying and prices have been sustained at record levels. Prices of cotton, hides, and various other maPERSONAL INCOME and SALES and STOCKS of GOODS Per Cent Seasonally adjusted indexes, 1947-49=100 Per Cent ^ 120 100 1947 1949 1950 1951 NOTE.—Department of Commerce series converted to indexes on 1947-49 base by Federal Reserve. Inventories are end-of-month data. Latest figures are for August. 1225 THE CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS SITUATION terials used mainly by the consumer goods industries declined sharply during the spring and summer from the highs reached early in the year. Since mid-September prices of materials have shown selective advances, reflecting some increase in business demands and a more restricted volume of offerings by producers. During the recent period of readjustment in consumer goods industries, activity, incomes, and expenditures in most other major sectors of the economy have been maintained or have exceeded earlier peak rates. Total industrial production in September is indicated to be only slightly below the high level of the first half of the year, as the curtailments in output of consumer goods have been largely offset by increases in production of munitions and capital equipment. While the number of new dwelling units started since March has been about one-third below the same period last year, there have been further marked increases in new plant construction. Wage rates have continued to advance, and unemployment in early September was at about the lowest level since 1945. CONSUMER DEMAND DEVELOPMENTS T h e falling off early this year in demands for consumer durable goods—notably appliances, television, and new automobiles—reflected a number of influences. Some were of a temporary character such as the pushing forward of purchases resulting from earlier fears of shortages and, for certain items, the greatly advanced levels of prices reached for a time. After such an upsurge in prices as occurred in 1950, a certain amount of buyer resistance was to be expected as the new price levels were tested—especially when it became apparent that heavy accumulations of business inventories were developing. Moreover, the establishment of general direct price con1226 trols and tighter credit conditions contributed to the abatement in demands generally. Of considerable significance also for interpretation of the reduced rate of consumer buying of goods this year was the fact that consumers had become better stocked and housed than in any preceding period. T h e accelerated rate of consumer buying after the Korean outbreak came on top of large-scale spending for goods throughout most of the period following World W a r II. This buying reflected large deferred demands and various other influences, including a rapid increase in the number of new households. Consumer expenditures for goods alone were a larger proportion of personal disposable income than at any time in the previous two decades. T h e proportion in the three years 1947-49 averaged 67 per cent as compared with a high before World W a r II of 61 per cent. Expenditures for services meanwhile remained at relatively low rates, reflecting in part Federal controls on rents and a lagging adjustment in prices of other services. This year the proportion of disposable incomes going for goods has fallen off to 61 per cent during the second and third quarters. T h e proportion spent on services has been maintained. Rents and prices of other essential services are now higher as compared with 1948 than is the case for retail prices of goods. Larger consumer outlays are necessary to service and maintain the record volume of major durable goods and housing now in the hands of consumers. These include expenditures on various miscellaneous goods, such as gasoline and parts, and on such services as repairs, insurance, and taxes. Consumer savings have increased this year, both in aggregate and as a percentage of income, and this reflects in part higher payments on consumer short-term and mortgage FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN THE CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS debt. Consumers have also considerably increased their savings in liquid form as indicated, for example, in increasing time deposits and savings and loan shares. An unusual aspect of the shift in the consumer demand situation was its limited downward impact on the economy generally. While heavy inventories had accumulated and the rise in consumer incomes had slowed down, expenditures for defense and capital equipment were continuing to expand. It was widely expected that further growth in defense activity would soon result in a reversal of the situation in the consumer goods field. Increases in incomes from expanding employment and hours worked in defense activities and from further advances in wage rates were counted on to more than offset decreases resulting from reduced working time in nondefense lines, while further curtailments in consumer goods output were expected to result from material shortages. SITUATION consumer durable goods have been especially pronounced in 1950 and 1951. Output of passenger automobiles and household goods—carpets, furniture, major appliances, and radios and television—are measured by a new index shown in the accompanying chart and described in a special article on pages 1235-40. This index rose sharply in 1950 and during the second half was two-thirds above the 1947-49 average. By March 1951 output was only slightly below this advanced level and, with consumer demand for these goods sharply curtailed after February, business stocks mounted further. OUTPUT OF MAJOR CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS Seasonally Adjusted, 1947-49 Average for Total '100 Points in Total Index Points in Total Index SUPPLIES OF CONSUMER GOODS The extraordinary levels of demand for consumer goods reached in mid-1950, inspired by prospects of shortages and of rising prices, resulted in a very sharp expansion in output of finished consumer goods and of materials and parts for their production—including many nondurable items as well as most durable goods. The inauguration of the expanded defense program in the summer of 1950 was widely heralded to mean marked curtailments before the end of the year in output for civilians. Contrary to these expectations, output of consumer goods was generally maintained at record levels up to the spring of this year and, despite a new wave of buying after the Chinese intervention in November, stocks of consumer goods generally continued to expand. Fluctuations in output and stocks of major OCTOBER 1951 1947 1948 1949 1950 NOTE.—Federal Reserve indexes. For description see pages 1235-40 of this BULLETIN. Latest figures shown are for August. National Production Authority limitations on use of metals for consumer goods increased in importance beginning in the second quarter; reflecting these measures as well as the accumulation of inventories, average output of major consumer durable goods began to decline and by July was 35 per cent below the high first quarter and close to the 1947-49 average.

Current production. The National Production Authority has allotted materials for the production of 1.1 million new cars during the last quarter of this year, a rate about as high as for any fourth quarter except that of 1950. Whether this output is attained will depend partly on the actual availability of the materials allotted, particularly copper, and partly on demand expectations. Production in the third quarter almost equaled the 1.2 million cars for which materials had been authorized. Some companies, including the three major producers, made maximum use of the materials authorized but other companies curtailed production considerably because of the high levels of their dealers' stocks and because of production difficulties. Sales and stocks. Demand for new passenger cars thus far in 1951 has been considerably below the extraordinary rates reached in the buying waves of the summer and winter of last year. Inventory financing problems developed for certain makes during the second quarter as total dealers' stocks were about double the low levels prevailing in the earlier postwar years. These stocks, however, amounted to less than a month's supply at going sales rates. Dealers' stocks of new cars had increased in the autumn of 1950 from the extremely low levels of the summer. They accumulated further when output for domestic use rose in the first quarter of this year, to an annual rate of 6.8 million units in March, as shown in the chart; car sales, as approximated by registration data, showed little further rise after February when sales usually show marked seasonal increases. The rise in stocks, however, slowed down in the second quarter as output was reduced.

A sharply expanded volume of exports during the first half of this year—at an annual rate of 310,000 units compared with 135,000 in 1950—was a factor in limiting the rise in domestic stocks throughout the period. Recent demand influences. After mid1951, when output was reduced further, new car sales also decreased. The decline in sales was less than in production and stocks were reduced by about the amount that they had increased earlier in the year. With stocks lower, demand for cars in early September was stimulated by expectations of impending shortages, higher ceiling prices, and increases in excise taxes, and by the relaxation of Regulation W terms on July 31 to conform with the amended Defense Production Act. Preliminary indications are that demand for new cars has decreased again since the average advance of about 5 per cent in wholesale 1229 THE CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS SITUATION prices in mid-September. The approach of new models and other seasonal influences usually result in a decline in demand for new and used cars after Labor Day. Owing to tooling difficulties and material shortages, the period of new model change-overs may extend over a longer time than usual. Present tentative plans call for the introduction of new models beginning in late November and continuing well into next year. Another factor bearing on demand includes the limits on instalment sales terms under the Board's Regulation W. Throughout the period since its reimposition on September 18, 1950, cash sales of new cars, probably involving an increasing rate of tradeins, apparently have been maintained at higher levels than instalment sales. During the first six months of this year instalment sales were below the corresponding period a year ago while total sales were virtually unchanged. Used cars. Sales of used cars have been more active than sales of new cars in the second and third quarters, following substantial reductions in retail prices of used cars during the spring, as shown in the chart. Dealers' stocks of used cars have been reduced from the relatively high levels which had been reached in the spring as a result partly of the increased proportion of trade-in sales and of dealers' expectations that shortages of new cars would develop. Prices of used cars during 1950 reached a peak in mid-August but declined sharply thereafter and by the end of November were down about as much as might be expected seasonally from the levels just prior to the Korean outbreak. From November through February, prices showed a small counterseasonal rise. Reflecting the subsequent easing of inflationary pressures which developed in other markets and the relatively high 1230 USED CAR PRICES 1400 1200 1000 1000 1950 1951 NOTE.—Federal Reserve compilation of data from private sources based on advertised offerings of Chevrolets, Fords, and Plymouths in Sunday newspapers in 18 cities.

After May prices showed little downward movement and in early September they strengthened as new car prices were advanced. Consumer/ stoc\\s. Changes in the number and distribution of automobiles in use have become of growing importance in considering shifts in demand, especially since the 1948-49 recession experienced by many other consumer goods. Reflecting output of about 24^2 million vehicles since the end of 1945 and a low scrappage rate, the number of automobiles in use on October 1 is estimated to have totaled 40 million. This is 22 per cent larger than the number in use in mid-1949. Moreover, early this year about 65 per cent of all families in the nation had one or more cars compared with 56 per cent in 1949, according to the Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, and the number of families with more than one car was increasing. Apart from their large number, an unusual FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN THE CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS SITUATION feature of the automobiles now in use is their age distribution. This reflects the curtailed production during the war, the limited output immediately after, and the extremely high production and demand rates of the past three years, along with the continued operation of older cars beyond the prewar customary scrappage age. By the middle of this year, about 14 million cars, or 36 per cent, were under three years of age, as compared with 27 per cent in 1949 and 29 per cent in 1939, as shown in the following table. The number 10 years of age and over was far greater than the 4 million in use in 1939.

HOUSEHOLD GOODS Consumer demand for major household goods, particularly appliances and television, has shown very sharp shifts since the Korean outbreak. As a result, fluctuations in sales, business inventories, and output have been more marked for these goods than for passenger cars and most other consumer goods. Changes at retail stores in the value of sales and stocks of household goods are compared in the accompanying chart with the course of output—all series adjusted for seasonal variation. A breakdown of output of these goods into four major groups is shown in a chart on page 1235. Production of household goods in 1950 exceeded the postwar replenishment boom levels of 1948. Since the first quarter of this year output has declined much more than OCTOBER 1951 1948 1949 1950 1951 NOTE.—Sales and stocks indexes compiled by Federal Reserve from Department of Commerce figures for homefurnishings stores and Federal Reserve department store data for carpets and m<?s, furniture, major household appliances, and radios and television.

Latest figures shown are: sales, September; stocks, end of August; and output, August. in the 1949 recession and the recent level is close to the low reached at that time. This sharp curtailment, together with a moderate rise in consumer buying from the reduced levels reached in May and June, has probably resulted in a decline recently in over-all business inventories of these goods—considering wholesalers and manufacturers as well as retailers. At retail stores the value of stocks of household durable goods by the end of August was 10 per cent below the May peak, reflecting in part mark-downs of goods in inventory. T h e August figure was still 40 per cent above the pre-Korean level, while the value of retail sales in August, and also September, was at about the same rate as before Korea. Retailers sharply curtailed their orders for household goods after consumer buying fell off from the January peak, and receipts of goods during the second quarter were reduced substantially. Retail sales, however, 1231 THE CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS SITUATION did not show the usual seasonal rise during second quarter, but by August was down to the second quarter and stocks continued to about three-fifths of the average for the first increase through May.

Television and radio. Among household goods, the greatest instability since mid-1950 has been experienced by television. In August the level of output was only one-third of the first quarter level and less than one-half of the average rate in the first half of 1950 although Federal material orders indicated a production ceiling of about two-thirds of the latter rate. The composition of output changed considerably over the period, with the larger, more expensive console and combination sets rising in proportion to the total ioo -^x-^ey— N during last year's increase and falling off 60 during this year's sharp decline.

The sharp increase in new residential building last year and the decrease this year have resulted in marked changes in contractors' purchases of such major appliances as refrigerators and stoves. These purchases are usually not made at department stores and other retail outlets, but their production is reflected in the new output index referred to earlier. Average output of major appliances was nearly halved from March to July and was lower than at any point since the beginning of 1947, as shown in the chart on page 1235. As noted for television, the 1950 increases in output were especially marked for the more expensive models, which producers anticipated would find a very large market. Carpets and furniture. Compared with appliances and television, fluctuations in buying of carpets and furniture were less extreme, partly because fears of shortages were not so great. Furniture production in August was about one-fifth lower than a year earlier. The much sharper curtailment in output of carpets was influenced by sharp declines in wholesale prices of raw wool and carpets and the subsequent pressure by distributors to liquidate inventories. Prices of carpet wool tripled from the beginning of 1950 to the early part of this year, and there was a succession of advances in wholesale prices of carpets, as shown in the chart, totaling about 75 per cent. Since March carpet wool prices have fallen to preKorean levels. Wholesale prices of carpets have been reduced substantially by October. Retail list prices of carpets, which had not increased so much percentagewise, were reduced only slightly this summer but, as in the case of most other consumer durable OCTOBER 1951 PRICES OF CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS 1947 ! -49-100 Cent 1947 1949 1947 Per Cent 1949 1951 NOTE.—Special Federal Reserve compilations of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which are monthly for wholesale and end of quarter for retail.

Latest figures shown are: retail, end of June; wholesale, August. goods, discounts and special promotions on carpets were widespread. The failure of retail list prices of durable goods to be reduced, except for television sets, probably reflected trade views that shortages would reappear soon and that bargain prices would prove to be temporary. SUPPLY PROSPECTS Supplies of consumer durable goods in coming months will depend largely upon production prospects which differ for the various goods. Output of such products as carpets, other textile housefurnishings, wood furniture, and china and glassware is not likely to be limited by material supplies. Federal allocations of steel, copper, and aluminum will continue to be an influence on output of passenger cars, appliances, and other consumer metal products. As noted earlier, new passenger car assemblies are being permitted at a rate slightly below the 1233 T H E CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS SITUATION reduced third-quarter level and about 30 per cent below the rate in the first half of 1950. Metals have been authorized for production of automotive replacement parts at very high levels. For most other consumer durables, however, the NPA on September 5 announced fourth quarter allotments of steel averaging about 58 per cent of quarterly consumption during the first half of 1950 (or the last half of 1949) as compared with the 70 per cent limitation during the third quarter of this year. Use of copper and aluminum—more sharply curtailed than steel in the third quarter—has been further restricted. Several factors make it difficult to anticipate now what influences these Federal limitations on use of metals will have on total output of consumer metal products other than automobiles. Among these are possible changes in the amount of metal consumed per unit of finished product, possible modification or adjustment in original allotments as a result of appeals of individual producers, and the question of actual availability of metals to meet allotments. Moreover, output of some of these goods has recently been 1234 considerably below levels permitted by NPA. Mainly for the latter reason, output of major metal household goods could probably be increased during the fourth quarter if demands were to rise sufficiently. Also, production of numerous nonmetallic durable goods could be expanded along with output of most consumer nondurable goods. Metal allotments in the first quarter of next year, according to recent announcements, are expected to be below the amounts allotted during the fourth quarter. How long the present relationship between supplies and demands for consumer durables will persist depends on future changes in demand as well as in production. The course of consumer spending in the period ahead will reflect to a considerable extent changes in incomes and output from recent levels resulting from development of the defense program, expansion in productive capacity, and modifications in direct and indirect Federal control policies. Various other economic and political influences, particularly the impact of international events, will also continue to be important influences on consumer spending and saving patterns. FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN NEW INDEX OF OUTPUT OF MAJOR CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS Consumer durable goods have been of growing economic importance in the national economy over the years, and current changes in output of these goods are of special interest because of the impact of the defense program. Changes in demand for passenger automobiles and major household goods account for most of the fluctuations in total consumer purchases of durable goods and in instalment credit. As a consequence, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in the administration of Regulation W and other measures designed to influence national monetary and credit conditions, has a particular interest in data relating to consumer durable goods. A new monthly index of the physical volume of output of major consumer durable goods for the period since January 1947 has been developed. The new index of output, together with retail sales and other data available for an approximately similar list of products, provides a more complete basis for analyzing output and distribution changes in this volatile sector than has hitherto been available. Such an analysis is presented in the leading article of this BULLETIN. The total index and its principal divisions— passenger automobiles and major household goods —are shown in a chart on page 1227. Indexes for the four groups of household goods covered— carpets, furniture, major appliances, and radio and television receiving sets—are shown in the accompanying chart. Since major items only are included in this index, it does not represent output of all consumer durable goods, as discussed in more detail below. Consumer expenditures for the products included in the new index have represented a large and varying proportion of total consumption expendiNOTE.—This index and analysis were developed in the Board's Division of Research and Statistics by Milton Moss under the general direction of Clayton Gehman, Chief of the Business Conditions Section, and with the assistance of other members of the Section. The following private organizations were of considerable assistance in supplying basic data and other information used in constructing the indexes: American Home Laundry Manufacturers Association, Carpet Institute Incorporated, Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, National Electric Manufacturers Association, Radio-Television Manufacturers Association, and Vacuum Cleaner Manufacturers Association. OCTOBER 1951 tures on durable goods, as indicated by the chart on page 1239. The new index brings together data which previously have been either unavailable to the public or available in scattered sources. The index is composed of 27 individual series representing the physical volume of output of 12 types of products.

Latest figures shown are for August. The individual series have been expressed in terms of average output in the three years 1947-49 as 100 and then combined into group and total indexes on the basis of the value of manufacturers' sales in the year 1947. Monthly indexes have been adjusted for differences in working days from one month to another and for seasonal variation. Annual indexes for the 27 series and seasonally adjusted monthly indexes for the total and six major groups are shown on pages 1236 and 1238 respectively. The group indexes, without seasonal adjustment, and indexes for the individual series 1235 NEW INDEX OF OUTPUT OF MAJOR CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS on appliances and radio and television are available on request to the Board's Division of Administrative Services. Current figures for the total and six groups will be published regularly in future issues of the Business Indexes release of the Division of Research and Statistics and in the Federal Reserve BULLETIN. This index is entirely independent of the Board's regularly published index of industrial production which covers output of all goods produced at factories and mines and has value-added rather than value-of-finished-product weights. DESCRIPTION OF INDEX Output of consumer goods, as measured by this index, relates to type of product and not to ultimate purchaser. While the goods represented are sold primarily to domestic consumers, a varying proportion is sold to business establishments, to Government agencies, and for export. The index reflects total output of the represented goods including production for export and for nonconsumer use. This and other differences between the index and the statistics on personal consumption expenditures for durable goods are discussed in a later section. The term \"major\" relates to passenger automobiles and, in general, to durable household goods which involve large outlays per unit. Some relatively expensive consumer goods, such as pleasure boats, sewing machines, and pianos, are not included in the index because current production data are not readily available and individually the goods are of limited economic importance. On the other hand, where smaller items are important for completing their respective product groups, as in the case of table-model radios in the radio group, and small tables and chairs in the furniture group, output of such relatively inexpensive items is reflected in the index. The appliance group is limited to major items, and such products as hand-type vacuum cleaners, portable washing machines, toasters, and other small appliances are not included. A complete list of the items represented in the index is shown in the accompanying table. Sources of data are given on page 1237. All of the individual series in the index are based on monthly physical product data with the exception of the furniture series. For this series, which accounts for 18 per cent of the total in 1236 the base period, data on production worker manhours in the furniture industry, with adjustments for estimated long-term changes in output per man-hour, are used to represent output. Most of the monthly physical product series are based on the number of units produced. For vacuum cleaners, washing machines, ironers, and driers, the series are based on unit data for factory shipments. In the base period these four series accounted for about 5 per cent of the total index and 30 per cent of the major appliance group. The series for passenger automobiles is based on factory sales which, on a monthly basis, are practically identical with the number of cars assembled. In the case of refrigerators, freezers, and cooking stoves, production series were derived by adjusting data on factory shipments for changes in factory inventories—both in number of units.

The weights are based on relative prices per unit of output and, except for television sets, are derived from 1947 factory values as shown in the Census of Manufactures. These figures are after discounts and allowances and exclusive of excise taxes. In the case of television sets, the weights are based on unit values in 1949 since prices in 1947 were very high because output had not yet reached large-scale volume. The weights for the individual indexes and the steps in the calculation of these weights are shown in the table on the preceding page. The method used in making the seasonal adjustment is that described in the December 1941 issue of the Federal Reserve BULLETIN. In the case of passenger automobiles, however, the sea- The physical product data used are compiled by private trade associations and the Bureau of the Census. In most cases these sources furnish data for nearly 100 per cent of the industry, but in some cases it has been necessary to adjust reported monthly data to more comprehensive annual production figures. This has been done in consultation with industry representatives. All of the monthly product series are converted to output rates per working day. In the furniture series, man-hours derived from reports of the Bureau of Labor Statistics relate to uniform payroll periods nearest the 15th of the month and thus do not require any daily average adjustment. All series are expressed as percentages of the average rate of output in the three-year base period 1947-49.

The extent of curtailment in output resulting from model change-overs was estimated from weekly output figures for individual makes of passenger automobiles. Seasonal adjustments for this and all of the other series in the index should be considered tentative. Strong nonseasonal forces have tended to obscure seasonal patterns during the period covered by the indexes and may do so increasingly as the defense program develops further. Insofar as available data permitted and where significantly improved results could be demonstrated, separate output series for different sizes and types of products were developed. As shown in the table of annual indexes, changes in output varied greatly for different sizes and types of particular products. In the case of refrigerators, for example, it was found that the weighted combination of the five, size groups used in the present index showed a rise of 81 per cent from 1947 to 1950 as compared with a rise of 64 per cent in a simple count of the number of refrigerators produced. In the important case of passenger automobiles, there has been no allowance for changes by type or size of vehicle. Additional analysis is being made of this problem. COMPARISON WITH EXPENDITURE DATA The new output index is a substantially different measure from the Department of Commerce estimates of personal consumption expenditures for all durable goods. Several broad groupings of the expenditure data are published quarterly, with more detailed data available annually. Annual figures for the total, expressed in constant 1939 dollars, are also available. The quarterly and annual expenditure data in current dollars reflect changes in prices and in physical volume, while changes in the new output index are unaffected by fluctuations in prices. Considering only the annual expenditure figures expressed in constant dollars, it is likely that the most important differences between relative changes in the Commerce series and in the output index would reflect differences in the list of products covered and changes in business inventories of these products. Only major items are represented in the index. The unrepresented goods, which cover a wide variety of items, such as replacement OCTOBER 1951 parts, luggage, and housewares, accounted for 37 per cent of expenditures for all consumer durable goods in 1950, expressed in prices current to that period, as shown in the accompanying table. The proportion of unrepresented goods was somewhat smaller in that year than in the 1947-49 period.

Monthly and annual changes in output and consumer expenditures have usually been more pronounced for major items than for other durable goods. Annual comparisons since 1929 are given for expenditures in the accompanying chart.

Total for 1951 estimated. \"Major items\" includes used automobiles and some other products for which data are not published separately. 1239 NEW INDEX OF OUTPUT OF MAJOR CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS is likely that year-to-year changes in prices for the two groups of durable goods were not divergent enough to have a significant effect on relative annual changes. Practically all of the annual fluctuations shown for the total from the mid-thirties to 1942 reflected changes in expenditures for the major items. A marked difference developed from 1942 to 1944, when other durable goods increased and the major items showed a further decrease. Major items advanced sharply in 1946 from the reduced volume of 1945 and expanded considerably further from 1946 to 1950. Other goods showed little change after 1946. The output index measurement is at the point of factory production while the expenditure measurement is at the point of retail sales. This also can be an important source of difference between the movements of the two series. Thus, during a period such as 1950 and the first half of 1951, when large inventories were being accumulated by retailers, wholesale distributors, and manufacturers, increases in output were greater than in expenditures. During a period when business inventories were being reduced a contrary relationship would occur. 1240 Various other differences in the concepts and basic data used in developing these measures can contribute to their divergent behavior. The expenditure estimates use retail sale values including excise taxes, while the output index refers to factory values. The expenditure estimates include imports and exclude exports of consumer durable goods while the opposite is true of the output index. Furthermore, in the expenditure figures adjustments are made to exclude domestic sales for business and Government purposes. Finally, owing to the difficulty of securing accurate price data for highly fabricated goods such as consumer durable items, the results of deflating current value figures could be expected to vary considerably from time to time from the results of measurements based on unit volume. Even after allowance for the differences described above, divergence in trend between the expenditure and the output series could occur because of estimating or reporting errors in either series. Further attention and analysis are being given to such problems with a view toward developing more consistent information in this sector of the economy. FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN VOLUNTARY CREDIT RESTRAINT RELEASES BULLETIN NUMBER 4 (REVISED) OF THE NATIONAL VOLUNTARY CREDIT RESTRAINT COMMITTEE—LOANS ON REAL ESTATE The Voluntary Credit Restraint Committee at its meeting on September 5, 1951 evaluated the experience to date with Bulletin No. 4 covering loans on real estate, and adopted the following statement: The permanent financing of most new construction will continue to be governed by Regulation X as revised on September 1, 1951 to conform with the provisions of the recently enacted Defense Housing and Community Facilities and Services Act of 1951. Section 1 of Bulletin No. 4 is revised to recommend, in the case of loans on residential properties of one- to four-family units, that loans on existing properties should not exceed the limitations imposed by Regulation X or 66%3 per cent of the fair value of the property, whichever is greater. This means that on properties the fair value of which is $16,700 or less, the recommended limitations are those imposed by Regulation X (all of which are above 66% per cent); on properties the fair value of which is greater than $16,700, the limitation on borrowing is 66% per cent. In all other respects Bulletin No. 4 remains unchanged. Experience indicates that two points in Bulletin 4 are deserving of special emphasis. First, in determining whether proposed financing conforms to the Bulletin, all mortgage indebtedness to be outstanding on the property, including secondary financing, should be taken into account. Second, loans on residential property of more than four units and loans on commercial property should be screened as to purpose and loans should not be made unless they are in harmony with the principles of the Program. A sale with credit involved not exceeding that recommended in this Bulletin is sufficient evidence of proper purpose. Mortgage lenders, who do not have a regional committee from which to obtain opinions in doubtful cases, may refer questions to the regional insurance voluntary credit restraint committee serving their area. OCTOBER 1951 For the guidance of financing institutions in granting real estate credit encompassed by the Voluntary Program, Bulletin No. 4, as amended, is reprinted below. REVISED BULLETIN NO. 4—LOANS ON REAL ESTATE Real estate credit transactions governed by Regulation X, which covers the permanent financing of most new construction and major additions or improvements to existing structures, are not within the area of influence of this Voluntary Program. Neither does the Program apply to FHA or VA loans or to other loans guaranteed or insured or authorized as to purpose by an agency of the United States Government. The Program does apply, however, to all other real estate credit transactions. Financing institutions extending such credit are urged to observe the principles and the spirit of the Program. 1. Loans on residential property (one- to four-family units). The Committee has been informed that most financing institutions are following conservative lending policies on existing residential properties (one- to four-family units). The Committee urges all financing institutions to follow such policies and in no case to make a loan on existing property in an amount which would cause the total amount of credit outstanding (primary and all other credit combined) with respect to the property or with respect to the transaction to exceed the limit which Regulation X imposes as to new construction or a limit of 66% per cent of the fair valuex of the property, whichever of such limits is the greater.2 1 Wherever used in this Bulletin, \"fair value\" means: 1. If the loan is to be made to finance the purchase of real property: the bona fide sale price, or the appraised value of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower; 2. In all other cases: the appraised value of the property securing the loan. The appraised value should be determined in accordance with sound and established practice in the community. A good definition of \"bona fide sale price\" is given in Section 2(/) of Regulation X. 2 As a working rule, the above statement may be interpreted as meaning that where the fair value of the property 1241 VOLUNTARY CREDIT RESTRAINT RELEASES 3. Loans on residential property (more than fourfamily units) and on commercial property. Loans on residential property (more than four-family units) and loans on commercial property, such as office buildings, stores, hotels, motels, motor courts, restaurants, etc., should be screened as to purpose and the loan should not be made unless it is in harmony with the principles of the Program. If the loan is to be made in connection with a sale of commercial or residential property a determination by the financing institution that the sale and the sale price are bona fide may constitute a sufficient screening of the loan. The Committee conceives that it is not the function of the Voluntary Credit Restraint Program to make the transfer of real estate impossible or impracticable, but rather to reduce inflationary pressures by limiting the amount of additional credit created in the process of real estate transfer. Financing institutions are urged to limit a loan, on any type of property described in this section, whether or not a sale is involved, to an amount which would not cause the total amount of credit outstanding with respect to the property or with respect to the transaction to exceed 662/z per cent of the fair value of the property.3 Also, the Committee urges that financing institutions require an appropriate and substantial amortization of principal. The Committee recognizes that hardship cases may arise where a 66% per cent loan limitation would not be sound or equitable. Such cases would include a loan to finance the sale of property to close an estate or to pay estate taxes, the refinancing of a maturing mortgage, or the sale of property of a bankrupt company. The Committee makes no recommendation in such cases. 4. Loans on industrial property. Loans on industrial property should be screened as to purpose whether or not the loan is to be made in connection with a sale of real property. In this instance, however, there appears to be no need for a percentage limitation on the amount of the loan, since in the industrial field mortgage security usually is merely one of the factors considered by the lender in determining whether to make the loan and often bears comparatively little relation to the amount of the loan. 5. Sale-lease-back arrangements. The Committee also urges financing institutions to recognize that in most instances a \"sale-lease-back\" arrangement, whereby real property is purchased by a financing institution and leased to the vendor or his nominee, is a substitute for a form of financing and therefore comes within the Program and should be screened as to purpose. is $16,700 or less the limits of Regulation X would apply and where such fair value is more than $16,700 the limit of 66% per cent would apply. 3 If the facts are not already known, the financing institution presumably will want to request the borrower to furnish information as to any other indebtedness or credit existing or contemplated in connection with the transaction. 2. Loans on agricultural property. While the Committee recognizes that in some instances a loan on agricultural property may be in effect a loan on residential property, the Committee feels that normally such a loan falls in the category of a loan on commercial property (see Section 3 below), and the lender should be guided by the recommendations of that section as to over-all credit limits and purposes.

STATE BOND ISSUES TO FINANCE BONUS PAYMENTS 5 The National Voluntary Credit Restraint Committee today conferred with Governor Okey L. Patteson of West Virginia and a delegation of West Virginia State and banking officials who had been invited to discuss their proposal to issue 75 million dollars in State bonds to finance bonus payments to veterans voted in the November 1950 elections. There was also some discussion of a somewhat similar situation in the State of Oregon where a veterans' bonus plan has also been approved by the voters. In addition to Governor Patteson, the West Virginia delegation included William H. Ansel, State Treasurer; W. C. Marland, Attorney General; Fred Diddle, Assistant State Treasurer; Mason Crickard, Vice President of the Charleston National Bank, Charleston; and Hayes Picklesimer, President of the Kanawha Valley Bank, Charleston. In view of the fact that investment bankers in compliance with the Voluntary Credit Restraint Program have refrained from bidding on the pending issue of bonds, the Governor of West Virginia proposes to ofifer these bonds to the public directly by placing them on sale through the banks of West Virginia. The plan contemplates that any bonds left unsold would be purchased OCTOBER 1951 by using various State trust funds, disposing of other obligations if necessary. The Committee expressed its genuine concern over the difficult situation in which the Governor and his staff have been placed by credit restraint measures taken in the national interest to facilitate the defense program. In conformity with these measures, the Committee has adhered to the position announced on May 7, 1951, that \"soldiers' bonus issues are inflationary under today's conditions. They add to the spending power of the public through the creation of credit. It would seem desirable to postpone such issues until a time when immediate purchasing power is needed to counteract unemployment and when it might be more beneficial to the veteran.\" It was announced that Mobilization Director Charles E. Wilson had invited the Governor and the members of his West Virginia delegation and other interested parties to meet with him on October 5. There was no change in the position of either Governor Patteson or the Committee on this bonus issue as a result of the discussions today. 5 Statement by the National Voluntary Credit Restraint Committee on Sept. 28, 1951. 1243 CREDIT AND SALES REPORTED BY REGULATION W REGISTRANTS1 Under the Board of Governors' Regulation W, as reinstated in September 1950, every business engaged in extending instalment credit or purchasing instalment paper subject to the regulation was required to register with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Each registrant was asked to submit certain data concerning credit volume in order to provide an adequate basis for appraising the coverage and effectiveness of the regulation. By the beginning of 1951 about 143,000 businesses had submitted sufficient statistical detail to permit tabulation. Of these, about 8,000 did not give separate figures for instalment and chargeaccount credit. The remaining 135,000 reported a total of 15.2 billion dollars of instalment credit outstanding on September 30, 1950—12.8 billion held by registrants engaged primarily in financial business, and 2.4 billion by those engaged primarily in retail and other nonfinancial business.2 Instalment sales of 14.5 billion dollars were reported by nonfinancial businesses for the 12 months ended September 30, 1950. This amount represented 35 per cent of their total sales in that period. In addition, a substantial amount of their cash and charge-account sales was financed by instalment loans extended directly to consumers by financial businesses. Since nearly all financial businesses extending consumer instalment credit are subject to the regulation, these data give virtually complete coverage for this type of business. On the other hand, instal1 This article was prepared by Donald M. Fort and Katharyne P. Reil of the Consumer Credit and Finances Section of the Board's Division of Research and Statistics. The editing of the statistical data obtained by the registration statements was done by the research departments of the Federal Reserve Banks. 2 The 15.2 billion dollars of instalment credit balances reported by registrants differs from the Board's published estimate of 13.3 billion dollars of consumer instalment credit outstanding on September 30, 1950. It is therefore important to note that the instalment credit data presented here are not intended to be revisions of the consumer instalment credit estimates. The figures in this article summarize information given by registrants under Regulation W and include some nonconsumer credit. On the other hand, not all consumer instalment credit is covered here since some businesses that extend this type of credit were not subject to the regulation and did not register, and some of those who registered were unable to provide information on instalment credit. 1244 ment credit granted to consumers by retailers is not completely covered by registrants' reports because retail establishments which did not make instalment sales of articles listed in the regulation were not required to register.3 The proportion of total retail instalment credit thus omitted was relatively small inasmuch as the listed articles included most major consumer durable goods. Apparel and jewelry are the two principal types of unlisted consumer goods giving rise to instalment credit. Some apparel and jewelry stores registered, however, because they sold some listed articles on instalment. Some other businesses registered even though their operations were not currently subject to regulation.4 Financial businesses were asked to report the amounts of direct instalment loans and purchased paper outstanding as of September 30, 1950 for retail automobile instalment credit, other retail instalment credit, FHA-insured repair and modernization loans, other repair and modernization credit, and personal instalment loans. Nonfinancial businesses were requested to report instalment and charge accounts outstanding as of September 30, 1950; cash, instalment, and charge-account sales made during the year ended on that date; the total amount of down payments on instalment sales; and the amount of instalment paper sold during the 12-month period.5 Registrants were asked to report all data in the preceding categories, including credit and sales not subject to the regulation. More detail was requested in the 1950 registration than in registrations while Regulation W was in effect in 1941 and 1948.6 The data requested from financial businesses were intended to provide up-to-date information for registrants comparable to the call data for commercial banks. Separate figures for direct loans and purchased paper were obtained to throw some light on the origin of the instal3 The listed articles included most of the principal consumer durable goods: new and used automobiles, radio and television sets, major household appliances, furniture and floor coverings, and residential repairs and alterations. 4 These businesses may have registered simply to be on the safe side, or in anticipation of engaging in regulated operations later on. 5 Registration statement schedules and instructions are shown at the end of this article, pp. 1252-55. 6 For data from earlier registrations, see BULLETIN for May 1942, pp. 434-37, and for April 1949, p. 340. FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN CREDIT AND SALES REPORTED BY REGULATION W REGISTRANTS ment credit held by financial businesses. Separate figures on FHA-insured and other repair and modernization credit provided for the first time detailed information on the amount and distribution of such credit. Nonfinancial businesses reported sales and receivables by type of transaction, as in the 1941 registration, and, in addition, down payments and instalment paper sold. All this additional information helped to trace the flow of credit from the originator to the holder. Attempts were made to obtain complete reports from all registrants. Nearly all of the financial businesses filed complete returns. Figures on total sales and total receivables were obtained from almost all of the nonfinancial registrants, but about 8 per cent of these businesses could not give separate data on the instalment portion of their sales or receivables, and about 10 per cent of those who reported these data could not give figures for down payments or instalment paper sold. The accompanying tables summarize the data reported by registrants. NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS The present analysis covers 112,796 nonfinancial businesses and 30,606 financial businesses.7 It is believed that most financial businesses are covered 7 The number of registrants included in the present analysis is not strictly comparable with the numbers given for the 1941 and 1948 registrations in the Federal Reserve BULLETIN for April 1949 (p. 340) since the present analysis excludes businesses that reported zero instalment receivables or sales. Also, the figures are not readily comparable with the total number of business offices or outlets reported by other agencies such as the Census. For example, the registration statements were filed only by the head offices of multi-unit businesses except where branches were separate legal entities, whereas each \"establishment\" reported separately in the Census.

Nearly three-quarters of the total was held by commercial banks, sales finance companies, and State-licensed small loan companies. As shown in Table 2, commercial bank holdings were largest, amounting to about 6.0 billion dollars on September 30, 1950. Sales finance companies were second in importance with nearly 4.2 billion, and State-licensed small loan companies were third with slightly more than 1.0 billion dollars. Only 2.4 billion or about one-sixth of the reported total for instalment receivables was held by retailers and other nonfinancial businesses. Nine years earlier, when the initial registration under Regulation W took place, the nonfinancial group held approximately one-fourth of all instalment paper reported. The declining importance of dealer holdings has been brought about largely by two factors. Retailers have been selling a larger proportion of their instalment paper. At the same time lenders have shown an increasing interest not only in purchasing retail instalment paper but also in making instalment loans directly to consumers. Such loans are often used to finance purchases of consumer goods which appear on the books of dealers as cash transactions. Among the non- with the exception of a small number of commercial banks and a substantial number of building and loan associations and miscellaneous financial businesses that do not deal in regulated forms of instalment credit. The coverage of nonfinancial businesses that grant instalment credit appears to be practically complete in the case of department and general stores, automobile dealers, and furniture and household appliance stores; it is less complete, and in some cases only fragmentary, for other types of retail businesses, many of which do not sell listed articles on instalment. Table 1 shows the distribution by Federal Reserve District of registrants covered by the analysis. Because of the inclusion of branches in the registration statement of the main office, the distribution of registrants by District does not give a correct picture of the geographic distribution of business outlets. Consolidated reporting is particularly important in the case of department and general stores, hardware and automotive accessory stores, sales finance companies, and small loan companies.

NOTE.—Details may not add to totals because of rounding. 1246 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN CREDIT AND SALES REPORTED BY REGULATION W REGISTRANTS financial businesses shown in Table 3, department and general stores (including mail-order houses), automobile dealers, and furniture and housefurnishing stores were the principal granters of instalment credit but their combined holdings on September 30, 1950 were only 1.8 billion dollars. Retail automobile instalment credit accounted for about two-fifths of the total outstanding instalment credit of registrants. Most of the automobile paper arose from instalment sales by automobile dealers, but only 0.3 billion dollars of outstanding instalment credit appeared on their books on September 30, 1950. Credit arising from automobile sales but owned by sales finance companies at that time amounted to 3.1 billion dollars while similar holdings of commercial banks totaled 1.2 billion. In addition, commercial banks had outstanding 1.3 billion dollars of automobile loans made directly to individuals. Holdings of other retail instalment credit were divided almost equally between financial and nonfinancial businesses. Both banks and finance companies purchased a substantial volume of nonautomotive retail paper, especially that arising from the sale of household appliances and construction and repair items, but their direct loan operations in this field were comparatively small. Commercial banks held about 85 per cent of all FHA-insured repair and modernization paper reported, but little more than one-half of the noninsured paper. Purchased paper constituted a somewhat larger part of repair and modernization credit than did direct loans. The repair and modernization data shown here include only paper held by financial institutions, as no specific information was obtained on the amount of such paper held by retailers and other nonfinancial businesses. It may be assumed, however, that a substantial part of the instalment paper held by building supply dealers and contractors and by hardware stores arose from repair and modernization work. Personal instalment loans outstanding accounted for more than one-fifth of the total credit reported by financial businesses. Banks and small loan companies accounted for the major portion of these loans. For most financial businesses other than sales finance companies and banks, personal instalment loans constituted the principal type of instal- TABLE 3 RETAIL SALES AND RECEIVABLES, BY K I N D OF NONFINANCIAL BUSINESS f Dollar amounts in millions] All registrants reporting total sales and receivables Registrants reporting sales and receivables by type of transaction Total Department and general stores i Automobile dealers Furniture and housefurnishing stores Household appliance, radio, and television stores Electric and gas utility companies Hardware and automotive accessory stores 2 Dealers and contractors 3 . . .

Instalment receivables of financial businesses by Federal Reserve District are shown in Table 4. It should be noted that the large holdings of retail automobile credit by sales finance companies in the New York District and of personal instalment loans by small loan companies in the Chicago District stem from registration of national operations by head offices located in these Districts. INSTALMENT SALES Retail instalment sales amounting to 14.5 billion dollars were reported for the year ending September 30, 1950, by 104,047 retail and other nonfinancial businesses. Such sales represented about 35 per cent of the total business of the retail dealers registering under Regulation W. This was a much larger proportion than for retail trade as a whole, because grocery stores, most apparel stores, and other predominantly noninstalment groups were not subject to regulation. The nonfinancial registrants accounted for nearly all of the instalment sales in the country and about one-third of the nation's total retail sales. Automobile dealers made more than 8.1 billion dollars of the 14.5 billion of instalment sales reported by all registrants. Department and general stores, including mail-order houses, ranked second with nearly 2.2 billion, and were followed by furniture and household appliance stores with 1.7 billion and 0.9 billion, respectively. Construction and repair dealers and contractors, together with manufacturers, accounted for half a billion dollars of instalment sales.

The proportion was around one-half at household appliance stores and utility companies, approximately three-fifths at furniture and housefurnishing stores, and about two-thirds at jewelry stores. These data are shown in Table 5. Automobile dealers made 42 per cent of their total sales on an instalment basis, receiving cash down payments and trade-ins amounting to about 43 per cent of their instalment sales. Of the credit extended by these dealers, about nine-tenths was financed through sale of paper to finance companies, banks, or other businesses. Consequently, the amount of instalment paper held by automobile dealers was small in relation to their instalment sales. Transactions financed by loans made directly to individuals by banks or other financial institutions appear on the dealers' books as cash sales.

OCTOBER 1951 1249 CREDIT AND SALES REPORTED BY REGULATION W REGISTRANTS Down payments reported by most kinds of nonautomotive businesses were from one-fifth to onetenth of their instalment sales volume. The sale of instalment paper varied widely from one kind of nonautomotive business to another. For example, household appliance and radio stores, farm implement dealers, and dealers and contractors in construction and repair materials sold nearly all of their instalment paper, whereas furniture and housefurnishing stores sold only one-fifth of their paper. In certain Federal Reserve Districts, for some lines of trade the totals shown in Tables 5 and 6 were dominated by data for national chains which were consolidated in a single report from the head office.
