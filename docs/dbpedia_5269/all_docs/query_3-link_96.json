        "text": "In 1608 the English explorer Capt. John Smith sailed into Chesapeake Bay and stayed for several weeks to map the shoreline. With reference to the countryside around the bay, Smith exclaimed, “Heaven and earth seemed never to have agreed better to frame a place for man’s habitation.”\n\nIn 1632 Cecilius Calvert was granted a charter for the land as a haven in which his fellow Roman Catholics might escape the restrictions placed on them in England. The first governor of the proprietary colony, Leonard Calvert, the younger brother of Cecilius, landed the founding expedition on St. Clements Island in the lower Potomac in March 1634. The first settlement and capital was St. Marys City. Aware of the mistakes made by Virginia’s first colonists, Maryland’s settlers, rather than hunt for gold, made peace with the local Native Americans and established farms and trading posts, at first on the shores and islands of the lower Chesapeake. The field hands included indentured labourers working off the terms of their passage and, after about 1639, African slaves. The most important crop was tobacco. Roads and towns were few, and contact with the English-model manor houses was largely by water.\n\nThe Calvert family provided for religious freedom in the colony, and this was formalized by the General Assembly in 1649 in an Act Concerning Religion, later famous as the Act of Religious Toleration. It granted freedom of worship, though only within the bounds of Trinitarian Christianity. One of the earliest laws of religious liberty, it was limited to Christians and repealed in 1692. Commercial disputes with Anglican Virginia and boundary quarrels with Quaker Pennsylvania and Delaware did not affect this tolerance. Puritan ascendancy in England (1648–60) caused only brief turmoil. A 1689 rebellion by Protestants overthrew the proprietary officers, leading to an interval of crown rule in the royal colony of Maryland (1692–1715). During that period the Church of England was formally established. In 1715 Maryland once again became a proprietary colony of the Calverts, who had converted to Protestantism. Maryland nonetheless remained a haven for dissidents from sectarian rigidity in other colonies.\n\nBy the 1660s the Protestant majority in Maryland came to resent the colony’s Roman Catholic leadership in St. Marys City. As the population centre shifted to the north and west, the capital was moved to Protestant-dominated Anne Arundel Town (now Annapolis) in 1694. In 1729 Baltimore was founded. Maryland’s dominant “country party” early resisted British efforts to make the colonies bear more of the costs of government. Frederick county repudiated the Stamp Act in 1765, and in 1774, the year after the Boston Tea Party, a ship loaded with tea was burned at an Annapolis dock.\n\nThe long-standing dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania over their common border was settled in 1767 when Great Britain recognized latitude 39°43′ N as the legal boundary. The boundary was named the Mason and Dixon Line for its surveyors. Thereafter, this line came to be regarded as the traditional division between the North and the South.\n\nMarylanders took an active part in the American Revolution. Maryland is sometimes called the “Old Line State” in honour of the Maryland troops who served with Gen. George Washington. Among the most-reliable troops in the Continental Army, they were often given difficult tasks; Washington called them “The Maryland Line.” The Continental Congress, often on the move to avoid British troops, spent a winter in Baltimore. At the close of the war, it convened in Annapolis, where it accepted Washington’s resignation from the army and ratified the Treaty of Paris (1783), which acknowledged the independence of the colonies.\n\nPostwar problems included the disposition of confiscated loyalist property, the struggle for paper money, and debtor relief. Maryland’s controversy with Virginia over the use of the Potomac and lower Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the Compact of 1785, led toward the Constitutional Convention (1787), as did the Annapolis Convention of 1786, at which Maryland was not represented. Luther Martin distinguished himself as a representative of Maryland at the Constitutional Convention. Maryland ratified the U.S. Constitution on April 28, 1788, the seventh state to do so. It also ceded territory and advanced money for public buildings to help form the District of Columbia (1791).\n\nThe state\n\nWhen harassment on the high seas and other factors brought on the War of 1812, Baltimore clippers, sailing as privateers, dealt more than equal punishment to British ships. In 1814 the British troops who had burned the principal government buildings in Washington, D.C., were repulsed in their attempts to inflict similar punishment on Baltimore. Francis Scott Key, a Georgetown lawyer and an eyewitness to the futile bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British in Baltimore’s harbour, wrote the four eight-line stanzas that, set to existing music, became the national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” in 1931.\n\nWith peace, Maryland and the rest of the country concentrated on making improvements in transport and communication. The Cumberland Road, or National Road, the first road to cross the Appalachians, was completed to Wheeling, Virginia (later West Virginia), in 1818. In 1828 workers began construction on the first U.S. passenger railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio, and on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, from Washington to Cumberland. The following year, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, long under construction across the northern part of the Delmarva Peninsula, was completed. It connected the Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay. The country’s first intercity telegraph line was constructed between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in 1843–44. In 1845 the U.S. Naval Academy was founded on the Severn River in Annapolis.\n\nThe Civil War, however, arrested Maryland’s progress. Landed gentry and residents of the Eastern Shore supported the secessionist South, while workingmen and western Marylanders stood up for the Union; a third faction favoured neutrality. In 1861 federal troops occupied Baltimore and Annapolis, and martial law was imposed in this border state. Confederate armies mounted three major invasions of Maryland territory in successive summers; they were checked at Antietam, they met full defeat at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and their threat to Washington, D.C., was dissipated in 1864. The constitution of 1864 abolished slavery and removed power from the rural aristocracy. The more-cautious constitution of 1867 remains in force."
