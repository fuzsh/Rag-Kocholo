        "text": "HAYMOND, Judge.\n\nIn this original proceeding in this Court the petitioners, the Honorables Okey L. Patteson, Governor, D. Pitt O'Brien, Secretary of State, William H. Ansel, Jr., Treasurer, William C. Marland, Attorney General, James B. McLaughlin, Commissioner of Agriculture, as members of the Board of Public Works and individually in their own right, seek a writ of mandamus to require the Honorable Edgar B. Sims, Auditor of West Virginia, to make certain deductions from their salaries for the month of April, 1951, and to issue proper warrants on the State Treasurer in additional amounts equal to each of such deductions, for the purpose of paying such deductions and such additional equal amounts, as contributions to the federal social security fund, to enable the petitioners to obtain old age and survivors insurance coverage provided by the Social Security Act of Congress, as amended, pursuant to an agreement entered into between the State of West Virginia and the Federal Security Administrator effective April 1, 1951, as to employees of the State.\n\nUpon the petition, filed May 1, 1951, this Court issued a rule returnable May 29, 1951. On the return day of the rule the defendant filed his written demurrer to the petition, and this proceeding was submitted for decision upon the petition, the demurrer, and the briefs in behalf of the respective parties.\n\nThe petitioners are elective public officers of this State whose offices are created by Article VII, Section 1, of the Constitution of West Virginia. Their present terms of office expire in January, 1953; and their annual salaries are fixed by statute. Section 2, Article 7, Chapter 99, Acts of the Legislature, 1947, Regular Session. They are also members of the Board of Public Works which is composed of the petitioners and the Treasurer and the Auditor of this State. Section 1, Article 4, Chapter 5, Code, 1931. In connection with their salaries for the month of April, 1951, the petitioners submitted to the defendant, as Auditor, requisitions for the issuance by him of warrants on the State Treasurer for the payment of their salaries, with the request that there be deducted from the salary of each of them the amount required as his contribution to the federal social security fund. The defendant refused the request of the petitioners to deduct the proper amounts from their salaries for the month of April, 1951, and informed them of his refusal by letter dated April 19, 1951, which contained these statements:\n\n'This is to advise you that on the transmittals submitted to this office to draw a state warrant for your salary for the month of April, 1951, I have deleted the deduction requested for your social security contribution for the reason that the constitutionality of the participation of Members of the Board of Public Works in this program, as elected officers of the State is questionable. The requirements of this new program, begun April 1, 1951, for employees of the State of West Virginia, would necessitate the State of West Virginia to provide matching funds equivalent to the social security deduction made from your salaries.\n\n'Article VI, Section 38, of the West Virginia Constitution provides that the salary of any public officer shall not be increased during his term of office. Your participation in the social security program during your current term of office would result in the State providing an amount to match your social security deduction. This matching amount above and beyond your salaries may run counter to the provisions of our state constitution above quoted as an unauthorized increase in salary to help provide for your retirement.\n\n'I regret very much to do this, but it will probably be best, in the beginning of this program, to determine the legality of the participation of Members of the Board of Public Works in the social security program, by taking this matter to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals * * * to test the constitutionality of the State's matching contribution for all constitutionally-elected officers, including myself. In signing the Social Security Agreement with the Federal Government, I signed insofar as I had authority to bind the State of West Virginia by virtue of the authority conferred on me by the State constitution and the various statutes.\n\n'I am taking this same position in regard to the salaries of all Members of the Board of Public Works (except the Superintendent of Schools who is ineligible for social security coverage being covered by the State Teachers' Retirement System). * * *.'\n\nAfter the receipt of the foregoing letter from the defendant the petitioners instituted this original proceeding in this Court.\n\nIn substance the questions raised by the demurrer and presented for decision are: (1) Whether payments from a special legislative appropriation of state funds, as contributions to the federal social security fund, for the benefit of the petitioners who are elective state officers, increase their salaries during their current terms of public office, contrary to Article VI, Section 38, of the Constitution of this State, which in part provides: 'Nor shall the salary of any public officer be increased or diminished during his term of office'; and (2) whether deductions from their salaries during their current terms of office, for the same purpose, diminish such salaries in violation of the same constitutional provision.\n\nFor the purpose of extending to employees of the State and its political subdivisions and the instrumentalities of either, and to their dependents and survivors, the basic protection accorded to other persons by the old age and survivors insurance system embodied in the Federal Social Security Act, as amended from time to time, the Legislature at its regular session in 1949, enacted Chapter 123 of the Acts of that session. In Section 2, Article 7 of that statute, certain terms were used and defined. By that section the term 'wages' means 'all remuneration for employment as defined herein, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash, except that such term shall not include that part of such remuneration which, even if it were paid for 'employment' within the meaning of the federal insurance contributions act, would not constitute 'wages' within the meaning of that act'; the term 'employment' means 'any service performed by an employee in the employ of the state, or any political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of either, for such employer, except service which in the absence of an agreement entered into under this act would constitute 'employment' as defined in section two hundred nine of the social security act'; the term 'employee' includes an officer of the State, or one of its political subdivisions or instrumentalities; the term 'state agency' means the State Auditor; and the term 'federal agency' means such federal officer, department, or agency as is charged in behalf of the federal government, by federal law, with the particular federal functions referred to in the act in connection with that term."
