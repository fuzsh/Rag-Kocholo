He asked that the suggestion be considered when editors meet in Washington and new York later this month. Meritorious As chairman Butler s plan May be it would be highly improper Lor any newspaper association to advise its members on a course of editorial or news policy. This is some thing which each editor must decide for himself and if the verdict is wrong then his readers have the right to Stop buying his newspaper. I say this although agreeing with the demo cratic chairman that there were Many instances in the 1952 Campaign when Adlai Stevenson did t receive any thing like the line treatment Dwight Eisenhower was Given in the nation s press. Perhaps Thea is because 85 per cent of the country s newspapers Are con trolled by Republican interests. In deed there Are but very Lew truly in dependent democratic newspapers remaining the Gazette being one of them. One of the chief reasons is that the expense of publishing a news paper has More than doubled in the fast few years and despite the in Sonday april a thought for thou seek lord thy god thou Shah find him. If thou him with All thy heart and soul. 1. 1956 editor1als he is risen Hope of Mankind rests with truth of first easter As Jesus entered death in the dark Ness of the Cross he said Tather into thy hands i commend my then he slept. Even As darkness extinguished the last Ray of Light and was the Victor Jesus had Confidence in the brightness and Victory of the easter Dawn. But before the easter Dawn there came the Phenomena of nature which accomplished the death of our lord. The appalling blackness of the heavens the piercing rays of Light that revealed the ghastly details of the heart rending scene of the crucifixion the taking of Christ from the Cross his Side from the portals of the Tomb since the world began. It represented the dying out of the dawning of the new. That Light of the easter Dawn fell first on woman our brightest earthly comforter and it was most appropriate that from her eager lips the disciples Learned the Joyful news of the resurrection. Christ overcame sin and death and Light returned to the world to give place to darkness. So it was on that first eventful easter so it Ever will be so i Are considerably less. Candidates Touchy Battle Page is not new to the newspaper business. As Long ago As 1936 the new York daily news instituted such a service with that very title. Other newspapers have had similar features under other names and presentation. We be never tried the plan at the Gazette since in elect it would be permitting both party committees to prepare the copy for such pages. Neither is known Lor its objectivity in the heat of a Campaign and news papers which have permitted their statements to go unedited have been threatened with libel suits. Handling political copy is a very Touchy business at Best. Although both candidates and holders of Public of fice Are automatically open to criticism they usually Are extremely sensitive persons for the very Good Rea son that they want to be either elected or re elected. To get them to agree on hard and fast rules so that both they and their opponents could have their say in equal space and position during the Campaign would be impossible. Besides there is the matter of the Reader to consider. What one Candi Date says May not be considered newsworthy although to him they Are the most important words uttered since the beginning of time. Still another candidate can say More in one paragraph of Public interest than his competitor includes in ten. This being the Case it probably will be Well Lor the Gazette to go on giving what we believe to be fair treatment to All candidates regardless of rank or party. Okey s confession n this regard Okey Patteson s confession of last week that he goofed when he picked gov. Marland As his successor at the statehouse received top play in this and practically every state newspaper. It took a lot of courage Lor a Man to lace a state wide audience and admit he made a colossal mistake. The 15-minute telecast was accepted with mixed emotions. I heard it deep in the Hills of Wyoming county where politics can be discussed at the drop of a hat and found that the former governor still has a Large number of followers. Ii anything he has considerably More than his Lormer pro Tege a former resident of Wyoming which is a subject political editor Harry Hoffmann does into with considerable detail this morning in his column across the Page. How much of his popularity Patte son can Transfer to j. Howard Myers whom he is managing in the present gubernatorial Campaign remains to be seen. And he also must be aware that while he May be getting votes Lor Myers he also has taken some away by now being so closely identified with Myers the one Man who represents More Independent voters in the democratic party than any other candidate. The facts of the Case Are that Myers sought Patteson As his Man Ager and would t enter the race until Okey agreed to the assignment. When you re running Lor a top office you need political savvy regardless How Independent you Are in your thinking and Patteson still has plenty of that around. I would like to see Myers whom the Gazette is supporting completely unattached from All politicians and groups. But that in t the Way it works although that Man in the White House has some Fine people thinking it does. Myers needs help easiest Way to affirm this 1 conclusion is to look at the Cost of running for office. One Raleigh county observer a Beckley paper re ported last week said the five demo cratic candidates for governor and the four or five who will be in the Senate race will spend More than million during the primary. If this is True then you can be sure the Republican candidates will spend at least that much. Myers is depending largely on individuals for financial assistance while his two chief opponents Robert Mollo Han and Milton Ferguson have been assured of help from labor and the statehouse organization in that order. It s going to be rough the entire Way but Myers can win if enough people get interested in his cause. It will be comforting to if he makes that he won t be obligated to a political machine. From the bitter Cross to the sepulchre maintain Confidence in the brightness and then came the easter Dawn. And Victory of the easter Dawn. If if if easter is the principal feast of the the feeling of hopelessness ecclesiastical year commemorating As it and despondency was pushed aside As does the resurrection of the Savior. It the Light returned with the Dawn of gives us cause to be thankful for the re turning Light of the Dawn of resurrection Day the returning Light that was Christ and that will Shine for All eternity the Hope for the salvation resurrection morn the gloom of the sepulchre was illuminated by the figure of the Angel of the resurrect first glowing Ray of consummated Light that glowed Over our hither harm c. Marland now conceded Good Chance to win Senate nod of Mankind. Sen. Neuberger Points up u. S. Need for conserving our great outdoors you know where and when the lands lakes streams and Mountain Rel last passenger Pigeon in this a treats is not vicarious his is a knowl Tion died and Why no american boy Edge which comes with the experience or girl Ever will see this species a Wing of outdoor living and he knows How to in Transfer these experiences to can you explain the difference be concisely and tween a National Park and a National Forest have you the of the fantastic number of your fellow find citizens who paid visits to such areas a dramatically Ris.

Area it in not comforting to learn in Are you at All concerned with the Genator Neuberger s report that Canada even More the future of the magnificent resources and Bountiful riches with which nature has endowed our 48 states if you Are conserving our great outdoors by Oregon senator Richard l. Neuberger will be Well Worth the time and trouble it takes you to obtain a copy and to digest its contents. The Cost is nothing. Merely write the Tamiment Institute 7 East 15th Street in new York and request same. Senator Neuberger is an ardent conservationist and his love of our Wood has More than 75 million acres of publicly owned forests with a population of almost 140 million less than the United states. Spacious provincial Parks Akin to our state Are plentiful in Canada and one in British Columbia is far bigger than Yellowstone our largest National Park. Our neighbors to the North can be proud of their government s methods and practices. Unfortunately Here there is much to be accomplished and you can discover Why if you la just take the Tims to read conserving our great out if Ever a political Campaign shaped up to an impossible outcome even before the filing deadline it is the confusing free for All in the democratic contest to Lill the u. S. Senate vacancy created by the death of Harley m. Kilgore. A few weeks ago when gov. William c. Marland first entered speculation As a possible Senate candidate the response was one of jeering laughter. It was incredulous that such a political move would be considered by a Public figure whose wide in popularity is conceded Hoffmann even by people within his own state administration. Yet today the tune has changed with respect to the Man who sat Down to play. Now instead of wisecracks and ridicule Hii presence in the Senate race is the subject of deeply for the prospects of the democratic party in West Virginia. Democrats who started out talking about the terrific beating Marland would take in the May 8 primary Are now ready to give Odds that he will win the nomination. The reason for this Quick switch from laughter to seriousness is simply a mat Ter of numbers while Marland can count on the controlled vote of the state House machine four other candidates will be splitting up the rest of the vote. And there is a possibility that still More candidates May join in the farce before the april 7 filing deadline. An indication of the serious concern now Felt for the Marland candidacy cams last week from a Man of political stature in the governor s Home county of Wyom with so Many in the he said Marland might even carry this county and believe me there is As much bitterness against him Here As in any that statement when it is considered in the Light of its full implication is both a powerful indictment of Marland Lor his unpopularity As governor and a Strong sign of the remorse is being Felt Over the possibility of his nomination. And it is with a feeling of remorse that democrats speak of the Senate nomination for their comment on the prospects of a Marland primary Victory in variably is followed by expressed fear of a party defeat in the general election. If if in Marland s unpopularity in his Home county was indicated in the unwillingness to have the governor testify in open court in the England Gazette libel trial now i the hands of a Wyoming county Cir Cuit court jury. State sen. Oscar h. Ballard too ill to appear in person had Given a deposition for use in the trial. Marland was called As a witness in connection with the Ballard testimony but instead of making himself available for a personal court appearance he journeyed to Pineville to make a deposition. Courtroom testimony always is More effective in counteracting the Flat impersonal Reading of a said one court observer and it can hardly considered a sign of popularity when the Opportunity to have the governor testify before a jury in nil Home county ii passed during his overnight visit to Pineville incidentally Marland stayed at the Home of former judge r. D. Bailey the Politi Cal patriarch of Wyoming who Only the Day before had declared in open court his allegiance to Robert h. Mollohan for governor As opposed to Marland s Candi Date Milton j. Ferguson. The Ferguson Camp is not at All Happy with Marland s entry into the Senate race feeling that it will detrimental by further emphasizing resentment to the statehouse machine. Ferguson himself admitted publicly few weeks ago that he had run into considerable opposition to the Marland administration in Campaign. The Story is that virtually All of the state House strategists were opposed to mar land s except Marland and political Boss Homer Hanna. But As the Field continue to grow it appears More and More that they knew what they were doing in sizing up the primary Campaign. The trouble is that they do not seem to have considered the general election or the welfare of the democratic party. Drew term co round communist Label boomerangs on Republican politicians those who shout about patriotism Are not always for american Way american As Bishop Wilburn c. Campbell pointed out in a luncheon club speech Here last week May frequently mean the in american Way and it follows that flags sym Bols and slogans Don t make a Patriot. Too Many organizations Large enough unfortunately to apply pres sure in High made an extremely Handy device of the term Bishop Campbell deplored. Is it the american Way to censor and thus deprive citizens of free Choice is it the american Way to maintain a readers forum caste system is it the american Way to accuse indiscriminately and without proper proofs one s neighbors of trea son is it the american Way to fight one sort of dictatorship by usurping civil rights and thus threaten to impose another sort of dictatorship is it the american Way to do All these things under a Banner Reading the Ameri can Many people would have you be Lieve so. Take careful Stock of the men and institutions which shout of patriotism too loudly and too often. Sudden Cancella Tion of Toscanini s fomer Abc sym phony of the air from taking a state department sponsored Tou of Southeast Asia had More backstage by play behind it than the finding of leftist musicians. Basically it was a Battle Between a Penn s y 1 v a n i a Republican. Robinson Mcllvain publisher of the Down ingrown. A. Archive and a Brooklyn demo crat rep. John j. Rooney. But also the democrats saw a Chance to Embarrass Eisenhower by showing that his own personal fund had been used to Send red musicians on a tour of Japan. Having smarted from the Nixon Eisen Hower gop charge that the democrats harboured communists in government the democrats saw a Chance to pin the same communist Label not Only on the Eisen Hower administration but right on Eisenhower himself since Only he can spend his special fund. Tragedy is that the orchestra has done a great Job for the u. S. A. Its tour of the far East last year won americans tremendous kudos was one of the Best Good will projects the state department has undertaken. The trip Cost out of the White House fund and an other trip was planned for Indonesia India and suddenly Pearson Brooklyn Democrat Rooney burst out with his red charges. What happened was that a musician fired by the symphony of the air came to Rooney with the charge that the or Chestra had been taken Over by reds. On Jan. 18, Rooney passed the tip on to Dennis a. Flinn assistant to state department Security officer Scott Mcleod an old Friend of sen. Mccarthy s. It was Mcleod s Job to Check the orchestra for Security in the first place. But he had failed to catch any communists prior to the far Eastern had assured Mcllvain any known communist would be identified in our passport however he finally sent Rooney the raw unchecked Fri files on the or Chestra which showed derogatory information against eight musicians three of whom had possible communist Back ground. Mcleod had checked the leaders of the orchestra carefully but had not checked every Piccolo because of the fact that they handle no government Docu ments had Access to no classified information. However it developed that some had taken pictures of american hmm on Okinawa and it was claimed had spread anti american propaganda. Pentagon officials incidentally had that any red musicians could have taken any important photos of american Bates. As a result however rep. Rooney demanded cancellation of the orchestra s Middle East trip also cast doubt about continuing Ike s special fund. Sex publisher Mcllvain now Deputy assistant Secretary of state put up an eloquent plea. If we Are to win this struggle we must present the positive factors of our system. All the world knows that we produce the mightiest bombs bomber and Battle ships. This fact is vital to our Security. But we have something equally important or perhaps More persuasive than instruments of destruction or gadgets for easier living to show the world. This is our culture and our people. Or. Chairman i believe that the time has come when we can no longer afford to ignore if occasionally we Export a foul sen. Kefauver and his advisers have been complaining that the demo cratic National committee ii loaded in favor of Adlai Stevenson. Meanwhile Stevenson has been complaining about the democratic National committee. Specifically Adlai put in a phone Call to his old Friend rep. Mel Price of East St. Louis 111. Stevenson sounded Wor ried and depressed. Price replied that what Adial needed was a professional politician. Stevenson replied that his Campaign manager James Finnegan former demo cratic Leader of Philadelphia was a professional. Rep. Price scoffed. Finnegan he said was Able to win the City of Philadelphia for the democrats thanks to sex mayor Joseph Clark and present mayor Richard Dilworth.
