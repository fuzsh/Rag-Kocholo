        "text": "LOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nOf the 50 states, Maryland is among those with the fewest number of local governments.\n\nCounty Government. Local government is found in Maryland's 23 counties. There, three forms of government exist: county commissioners, code home rule, or charter.\n\nChesapeake Building, 41770 Baldridge St., Leonardtown (St. Mary's County), Maryland, November 2017. Photo by Diane F. Evartt.\n\nCounty Commissioners. Under the county commissioners form of government, the General Assembly is authorized to legislate for a county. While a board of county commissioners exercises both executive and legislative functions defined by State law, and may enact ordinances, its legislative power is limited to those areas authorized by the General Assembly, enabling legislation, or public local laws (Code Local Government Article, secs. 9-101 through 9-113).\n\nAll Maryland counties formerly had boards of county commissioners, however, only twelve counties continue to operate in this fashion today: Allegany, Calvert, Caroline, Carroll, Charles, Garrett, Kent, Queen Anne's, St. Mary's, Somerset, Washington, and Worcester.\n\nCalvert County Courthouse, 175 Main St., Prince Frederick, Maryland, November 2012. Photo by Diane F. Evartt.\n\nCode Home Rule. Since 1915, counties have had the option of governing under code home rule, which enables them to exercise broad local legislative authority (\n\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nMaryland is represented in the U.S. Congress, and is part of the federal court system and other federal offices.\n\nU.S. Congress. In the U.S. Senate, Maryland is represented by two senators. In the U.S. House of Representatives, eight representatives speak for Maryland.\n\nU.S. Capitol (from First St., SE), Washington, DC, December 2017. Photo by Diane F. Evartt.\n\nFederal Courts. Maryland is part of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and holds the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Under the U.S. District Court are the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the U.S. Magistrates.\n\nGarmatz Federal Courthouse, 101 West Lombard St., Baltimore, Maryland, April 2008. Photo by Diane F.
