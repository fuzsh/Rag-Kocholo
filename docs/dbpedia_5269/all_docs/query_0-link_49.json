Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.

They shared profound concern for students and the educations they were receiving. In addition, they also were united by their efforts to expand opportunities for women, both at Purdue and nationally. Purdue itself benefited immensely from their service, including their forceful and direct efforts to convince their boss, typically the university president, to modify policies that would make Purdue a stronger university. Often, though not always, they were successful. Who was this quintet? They were the deans of women and then deans of students from 1933 to 1995: Dorothy C. Stratton, Helen B. Schleman, M. Beverley Stone, Barbara I. Cook, and Betty M. Nelson. In their early years they were part of a mere handful of adult women in positions of responsibility at Purdue. Thus, their concerns for women transcended student life to include opportunities for women as professors and senior\n\nix\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nadministrators. Not surprisingly, many of their male colleagues did not share their enthusiasm. Angie Klink has recorded their experiences in this lively volume, The Deans’ Bible: Five Purdue Women and Their Quest for Equality. This is not simply a tale of five beloved servants of Purdue. Rather, Klink has embedded their efforts in the larger tale of women’s changing role in American society in the twentieth century. She places these women—from Missouri, Indiana, Virginia, Tennessee, and West Virginia—in the national events influencing women’s experience as well as the service of three of them in the military during World War II. This is a book for Boilermakers to remember some of our most impressive leaders. I am fortunate to have known and admired all of the deans as a child in West Lafayette and as a Purdue student (BS, 1955; MS, 1958; Litt.D., 1980). Additionally, it is a book for those who have not had the privilege of a Purdue education to learn about this dedicated group who sought and achieved improvements, both in women’s opportunities and in university education. —Patricia Albjerg Graham Charles Warren Professor of the History of Education Emerita Harvard University\n\nPreface\n\nF\n\nor nearly a century, six Purdue women deans passed down a secret Bible. The Bible was the clandestine emblem of their shared profession and a symbol of their sisterhood. The many-layered story of their interwoven lives and their pursuit of equity for all people rings of fiction, but because it is true, the tale is relevant and inspiring today. We hunger to learn from women like Dorothy Stratton, Helen Schleman, Beverley Stone, Barbara Cook, and Betty Nelson. I was privileged to channel these women’s astonishing lives into this book. Over the course of several years when I attended a University “women’s event” in the Purdue Libraries Archives and Special Collections, I saw the same photo of five women striding shoulder to shoulder in a grassy meadow. Repeatedly, the photo was printed on programs or posters to signify “women of Purdue.” It was as if this image was the representation of powerful women in Purdue’s history. The photo became iconic. I didn’t\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nknow much about the five, but every time I saw the picture, the women walked toward me, and I thought, “There’s a story.” Then I was told of the secret Bible, originally held by Carolyn Shoemaker who became Purdue’s first part-time dean of women in 1913. When I heard of the hand-me-down Testament, I knew—there is a story, and I would love to write it. While not all of the women were devoted churchgoers, each dean passed the Bible to her successor. The book remained tucked in the acting dean’s desk drawer where it emitted a quiet, formidable reminder that when the dean on duty met with obstacles, injustice, or good fortune, the deans were always there for one another in presence and in spirit, shoulder to shoulder in forward momentum. The story of the five deans is a tale of women helping other women. The deans abetted each other, female students, faculty, and administrators. These women of great substance aided minorities, people with disabilities, and any student—male or female—who needed a good listener and a word of hope. The Deans’ Bible spans one hundred years of women’s rights, women at Purdue University, and women in America. The book is about equality for all people. Dorothy, Helen, Bev, Barb, and Betty were cut from the same progressive, broad-minded cloth and wore the same mantel of parity and integrity throughout their lives. Dorothy and Helen were friends with Amelia Earhart and Lillian Gilbreth. The aviatrix and engineer were profound influences on Dorothy and Helen who, into the twentieth century, carried forth the famous women’s philosophies that females can accomplish great feats. Dorothy, Helen, and Bev enlisted to serve during World War II. Captain Dorothy Stratton was the founder and director of the women’s reserve of the United States Coast Guard, which she named the SPARs. Captain Helen Schleman was Dorothy’s “right-hand woman.” Many who knew Beverley Stone may not have realized that this ultrafeminine woman who wore pearls and fur coats had been a WAVE, a member of the women’s reserve of the United States Navy. Time spent in the SPARs and the WAVES proved to these three that females could accomplish anything; however, when the war ended, women were told to go back\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nhome, take care of their men, have children, and forget thoughts of careers. This cultural pressure for women to marry, stay home, and not pursue their dreams was something that the deans challenged on Purdue’s campus for decades. Throughout her lifetime, Dorothy Stratton was honored as the director of the SPARs. Her contribution to America’s women and minorities spanned from her association with Eleanor Roosevelt, beginning in the 1940s, to her posthumous association with Michelle Obama in the 2000s, when the first lady christened and commissioned a United States Coast Guard cutter in Dorothy’s name. The USCGC Stratton protects America’s shoreline today. I thank the staff of the Purdue University Virginia Kelly Karnes Archives and Special Collections for their steadfast assistance during my research for The Deans’ Bible. University Archivist and Head of Archives and Special Collections Sammie L. Morris was most helpful in opening the “vaults” for me to peer inside. A special thank-you goes to Stephanie Schmitz, the France A. Córdova Women’s Archivist, and Jonathan K. McConnell, graduate assistant, for their prompt attention to my many queries to find a particular letter or newspaper clipping. Each dean has her share of papers and ephemera housed in the Purdue Libraries Archives and Special Collections, but Helen was the queen saver of them all. I read through thirteen archival boxes filled with Helen’s papers. She saved every letter she received and carbon copies (written back in the days of carbon paper) of the correspondence she sent. It was as if Helen knew that she must document the continual battles to bring women equal opportunities at Purdue and in the country, and that I would come along sixty years later to write down her trials for the world to see and learn from her efforts and fortitude. Often, when I left the beautiful research area of the Purdue Libraries Archives and Special Collections, where I had been cloistered for an afternoon surrounded by the rich wooden cabinets housing every Debris yearbook since the 1800s, I would feel the weight of Helen’s struggles. The continual oppression that she and the female students endured weighed heavily upon my shoulders; however, I also went away with such awe for her persistence and that of her sister deans. They never gave up. Even in .\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nretirement during the early 1990s, Helen, in her eighties, handwrote a four-page letter to the president of Purdue expressing her concern that there were not enough women in administration at the University. She then listed potential candidates and their qualifications. I thank two very special women for their immeasurable help in writing The Deans’ Bible. Dean of Students Emerita Betty M. Nelson is the dean “holding down the spiritual fort” here on earth for her predecessors. The deans considered themselves a “chosen family,” and Betty’s stories of her lineage of deans gave much insight to the tapestry of their connections, the challenges they faced individually and collectively, and the fun they had in the journey. To know Betty is to know a woman of class, depth, and energy. She’s funny, intuitive, and brilliant. I thank another member of the “chosen family,” Captain Sally Watlington. Sally was the daughter Helen Schleman never had. Sally was equally close to Dorothy Stratton. Dorothy, Helen, and Bev influenced Sally in her decision to join the navy. Sally and Betty cared for the deans as they aged. (Sally affectionately called them “the Deanie Weenies” and “the Girls.”) In the spirit of the Bible’s symbolic undertone of women advocating for one another, Betty and Sally were there for the deans, to the end. Most recently, the two cared for Barbara Cook until her passing in April 2013. The day after Barb passed away, I was at Betty’s house to interview Purdue alumna Teresa Roche, who knew all of the deans and is especially close to Betty. As Teresa and I sat at the kitchen table, Betty headed for the front door to leave for an errand. As if something came to her suddenly, she stopped, turned her head to the side, and said rather cryptically, “Be prepared for your life to change.” Then she opened the door and scurried off. Her words wafted prophetically in her wake. People have asked me if my books change me during the process of writing. They all have left their marks, even the children’s books with their sparse number of words. But The Deans’ Bible has transformed me the most, for these distinguished women have “removed the scales from my eyes.” Each dean chose a favorite passage to write down in the front matter of Carolyn Shoemaker’s Bible. Similarly, I am selecting a verse for this book—Acts 9:15–18, referred to as the “Conversion of Saul.” It reads:\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nBut the Lord said, “Go and do what I say. For Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel. And I will show him how much he must suffer for me.” So Ananias went and found Saul. He laid his hands on him and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me so that you may get your sight back and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” Instantly something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he regained his sight.\n\nAfter receiving his sight, Saul spent time with other believers to learn of the teachings of Jesus, and then he embarked on a ministry to preach the truth to others. When Saul spoke to others, his words were powerful because he was a brilliant scholar, yet most convincing was the evidence of the way he lived. It’s important to know the Good Book and how to defend one’s faith, but words need to be backed up with a changed life. For nearly two years I conducted research and wrote The Deans’ Bible. I have spent much time with the believers. It’s important that the efforts of the deans are written down to proclaim their faith in the potential of all people and their gospel of women helping other women. Scales must fall from more eyes. I hope my words can be backed up with a changed life—yours and mine. —Angie Klink\n\nPublisher’s Note: In addition to the photographs in the center of this book, further images can be found on a connected website hosted by the Purdue University Archives and Special Collections at http://dx.doi.org/10.5703/1288284315231.\n\nAuthor’s Note\n\nD\n\neans of women at universities and colleges across the United States were once connected as a nurturing network of mentors by their own professional organization, founded in 1916 as the National Association of Deans of Women (NADW). The early founders worked diligently to professionalize the position of dean and to legitimize their roles on predominantly male college campuses. The organization metamorphosed through the twentieth century, changing its name three times before shuttering in 2000. Deans of women opened doors and opportunities for female students, faculty, and administrators throughout American campuses. Their scholarly journal, research monographs, symposia, and conferences provided evidence of the immeasurable contributions that the association and its members made to higher education and women’s voices in that education. At the 1956 NADW annual conference in Cincinnati, Ohio, President Eunice Hilton declared a new name for the forty-year-old association. xvii\n\nxviii\n\nAuthor’s Note\n\nIt became the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors (NAWDC). In 1973, the name changed again as the word “administrators” was added. The organization became the National Association for Women Deans, Administrators, and Counselors (NAWDAC), a name it would hold until 1991, when the group moved into a new identity. In 1990, a fundraising consultant hired by NAWDAC recommended a name change using the ideas of “women in education” and “women’s leadership” as a guide. The membership of NAWDAC voted to change the association’s name to the National Association for Women in Education (NAWE). The word “dean” was no longer part of the seventy-five-year-old organization’s distinctiveness. By the turn of the twenty-first century, NAWE experienced increased competition for membership from other professional organizations. Society had also shifted away from supporting single-sex groups; NAWE came to an end in 2000. The association’s legacy and immense contributions to the advancement of female students, faculty, and administrators in higher education live on through its historical contributions—contributions that are of the utmost importance still today. In 2012, the American Council on Education’s (ACE) survey of college presidents found a profession dominated by white men—a portrait that has hardly changed since the NADW was founded in 1916. Today, 26 percent of institutional leaders are female. No doubt, the deans of women would encourage females to persevere, for there is still work to be done for the issue of women’s educational equity and advancement—still a goal to be attained in the twenty-first century.\n\nToday, the National Student Affairs Archives (NSAA) at the Center for Archival Collections at Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio, comprises the institutional papers of numerous national, regional, and state professional student affairs associations. The NSAA also is home to “The Student Affairs History Project,” a website devoted to the history of the student affairs profession. The NSAA was a helpful resource in the writing of The Deans’ Bible.\n\nThe Deans’ List\n\nCarolyn E. Shoemaker Born: 1865 Died: March 2, 1933 Dean of Women: 1913–1933\n\nDorothy C.

Betty had been Purdue’s dean of students for two weeks when she was invited to lunch at the Cook-Stone home flanking the golf course. Much to her surprise, Betty was presented with Carolyn Shoemaker’s Bible, a symbol of the women’s shared profession. Photo by Dave Umberger.\n\n1\n\nCelestial Chicken Salad\n\nO\n\nn a verdant July day in 1987, a camera clicked and a roll of 35-millimeter film advanced to record a moment in Purdue University history. Five women were captured in a photograph that represented six decades of striving for the advancement of women, a quest for equality for all beings, and an interweaving of lives that formed a chosen family. The photograph became known as “Five Deans Walking.” Betty Nelson, age fifty-two, had just completed her first two weeks as Purdue’s dean of students when her predecessors, Beverley Stone, age seventyone, and Barbara Cook, age fifty-eight, invited her to lunch at the white twostory colonial they shared on Western Drive in West Lafayette, Indiana. Betty thought she merely was invited to a nice lunch with the women who had become like family since she first worked in the Office of the Dean of Women twenty years before. Bev and Barb said the meal would be “something small, just a little salad.” And, as an afterthought, “Oh, Helen and Dorothy might be there, too.”\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nNeighbors and friends had nicknamed Western Drive “Deans’ Row.” Down the block from the “Cook-Stone” home, Dorothy Stratton, age eighty-eight, Purdue’s first full-time dean of women, shared a contemporary house with her successor, Helen Schleman, age eighty-five. The four former Purdue deans lived their retirement years, houses apart, along the edge of the emerald bunkers and bays of Purdue’s North Golf Course (today named Kampen Course). Betty arrived and noticed that the deans were dressed in summer suits, pastel skirts, and crisp blouses. Helen wore her gold Purdue pendant watch around her neck. Dangling from Bev’s ears were her signature faux pearl earrings. The table in the breakfast nook with a panoramic view of the golf course was set in style, and the women were in high spirits. Celestial Chicken Salad was served nestled in crisp lettuce cups. Celestial Chicken Salad was a recipe handed down to Barb Celestial Chicken Salad from her mother, Thelma Wood. Dice cooked chicken (always white Thelma told her daughter it was meat, of course). Toss lightly with a dish to be served when one celery, whole mushrooms (whole, not sliced), toasted pecans, fried wanted to impress. The chicken bacon, mayonnaise (must be Hellsalad was aptly named, for it was man’s—this is important), sour heavenly, indeed. The five deans cream (not low fat), and lemon sat at the kitchen table feasting juice. Garnish the luncheon plate and chatting. The lineage of with halved cherry tomatoes. their common chosen professions was nearly palpable. Dessert was served, and at the invitation of Barb and Bev, Dave Umberger, Purdue’s senior photographer, arrived. The women knew Dave loved Key lime pie, and Bev’s southern recipe was a refreshing favorite. It was then that the reason for the gathering was revealed. Barb pulled out a tattered brown leather Bible. Betty watched, hands folded and resting on her poplin skirt, still thinking she was simply there for a pleasant noontime meal. She loved to hear these women’s stories, some captivating and new, others familiar and deeprooted like family fables. Betty sat waiting, glancing at the old book in Barb’s hand. It was then that the four past women deans shared with the new woman dean their long-standing secret—the tale of the deans’ Bible.\n\n2\n\nCarolyn Shoemaker, a Faraway Look\n\nC\n\narolyn Ernestine Shoemaker possessed a Bible, an American Standard. The cover was supple, cocoa-hued leather. The end of the word “HOLY,” embossed with gold lettering on the spine, curled cheerily upward. The spine read: HOLY BIBLE REFERENCES SELF-PRONOUNCING NELSON\n\nThe term “References” indicated that throughout the text, the Bible contained mentions of other passages of Scripture on the same subject. A “Self-Pronouncing Bible” is one where difficult names are broken into syllables and accented by diacritical marks to help the reader pronounce them correctly. “Nelson” referred to Thomas Nelson Bibles, one of the oldest Bible publishers in the world. 3\n\n4\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nPerhaps the Bible was given to Carolyn as a gift when she was baptized or when she graduated from high school and entered Purdue University. Carolyn graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1888, less than twenty years after the University opened. Two of her classmates were George Ade, an author and humorist, and John T. McCutcheon, the “Dean of American Cartoonists” and Pulitzer Prize winner. Carolyn was quiet, composed, and cheerful. People said she had perfect poise. Mrs. Mindwell Crampton Wilson, in “A Tribute to Dean Shoemaker” during Carolyn’s memorial service, said that she “loved truth, seeking it above material things.” She had an open mind; she valued friends, loved her two brothers, Jesse and Charles, lived simply, and found joy in work. One of the few photos of Carolyn shows her looking wistfully through her wire glasses, her dark hair in a finger wave, a popular style of the time, with a long strand of pearls accenting her dark, scooped-neck dress with lace sleeves. Carolyn was a student in the first class Stanley Coulter taught after he arrived at Purdue to teach zoology. Later, he would become Purdue’s first dean of men. Coulter spoke fondly of Carolyn, the student he would grow to know more deeply as a colleague in the following decades. During Carolyn’s memorial service, in a speech titled “Dean Shoemaker, The Woman,” Coulter said: “I recognized in her case I was to deal with an exceptional personality. She had at all times a faraway look in her eyes, which only the years interpreted to me.” Emma Montgomery McRae was a professor of English literature at Purdue who nurtured Carolyn’s love of language. The two women had studied together and shared a trip to Europe. Carolyn said that Emma was the greatest influence of her adult life. Emma was a solid, broad-faced woman with hair loosely piled atop her head. She had been a high school teacher and principal in Muncie, Indiana, and she was the first woman in the state to be chosen as president of the State Teachers Association. A group of women created the Muncie McRae Club in Emma’s honor in 1894 for “intellectual and cultural pursuit” of “education in art, science, literature, and music.” This was during a time when many women did not have the opportunity for education, and the club was an answer to that\n\nCarolyn Shoemaker, a Faraway Look\n\n5\n\nacademic void. The club also discussed social concerns such as suffrage, child labor, and race relations. A program booklet contained the motto, “Study to be what you wish to seem” with a tribute to Emma, “our honorary member—eminent as teacher and lecturer, a woman of rare character and great influence.” The McRae Club history goes on to describe Emma as a woman who “. . . filled her niche in life to the fullest, and with it all, remained so gentle, so plain, so unassuming and yet so dignified. Wherever she walked, people were wont to say, ‘A queen has passed this way.’ [Her] lectures were always masterpieces, her travelogues were unsurpassed [and] couched in the King’s best English.” When Purdue President James H. Smart hired her in 1887, Emma became the “unofficial” dean of women. She was known as “Mother McRae,” and because there were few female faculty members and a small number of female students, she served as a counselor on every academic and personal problem these students experienced. Emma epitomized high character, delivered masterful speeches, and garnered immense respect. With Emma, the die was cast. Ladies Hall was the epicenter of every academic and social activity for Purdue’s female students and where all of the home economics classes were held. In the early years, home economics was the “foot in the door” to higher education for women. Often, females were “not allowed” to take other courses seen as “unwomanly.” It was the rare woman who bucked the stereotypes and took engineering or agriculture. The building also was a residence hall where the women and Emma lived. Ladies Hall was a striking redbrick building with imposing twin towers. An iron fire escape wove a path from a third-floor arched window onto a veranda rooftop, then down a ladder that scaled the side of the building to the lawn. The fire escape was a popular place for photographs, with women students posing in a line on each stair step or clinging to the ladder, smiling, in their hats, gloves, black fur-collared coats, and highbutton shoes. Each window bore a roller shade with a dangling string to pull for privacy. When it was constructed in 1872, Ladies Hall was the first permanent building north of State Street, the dirt thoroughfare that divided the Purdue campus.\n\n6\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nPut in context, it is remarkable that any woman obtained a college degree during the late 1800s, for society severely challenged women’s efforts for an education. When Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the first Women’s Rights Convention in 1848, in Seneca Falls, New York, grievances were documented in the “Declaration of Sentiments” and set the agenda for the women’s rights movement. One of the sentiments stated, “The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward women. . . . He had denied her the facilities of a thorough education, all colleges being closed against her.” An outcome of the convention was a demand for higher education for women. Through the 1890s, “scientific” reports were released that showed that too much education could seriously hurt the female reproductive system. Commonly known as the Progressive Era, 1890 to 1917 was a watershed in women’s intellectual history. There was a genuine fear that a good education would make a woman unfit for marriage and motherhood. In fact, nearly half of the first generation of college women did not marry or delayed marriage. They turned their energies to social reform and careers. Society offered educated women two choices—marriage or work, and many chose work. Remarkably, this cultural commandment to choose between career and marriage persisted well into the first half of the twentieth century. When Carolyn Shoemaker was twenty-one, she obtained her master’s degree from Purdue with plans to embark on a teaching career; however, as happens to many women, she put her personal goals on hold to care for someone she loved. Carolyn tended to her invalid mother for eleven years. Emma McRae hired Carolyn, age thirty-five, as an English literature instructor in 1900, the same year Carolyn’s mother passed away. Carolyn was an inspiring professor who infused a love of literature and drama into her teaching. She was a dynamic orator, on and off campus, and gave book reviews and speeches to clubs and organizations throughout Indiana. Carolyn’s office was in University Hall, today the oldest building on Purdue’s campus. In his speech during Carolyn’s memorial service, titled “Miss Shoemaker, The Teacher,” Professor H. L. Creek, head of the Department of English, described Carolyn in this manner:\n\nCarolyn Shoemaker, a Faraway Look\n\n7\n\nShe would enter the English Department office to get her mail, smile a greeting to anyone who might be present, and go back to her own office, perhaps without speaking. Ordinarily she seemed quite composed, with something of philosophic calm in her face and manner. Then sometimes there would come a sudden revelation of emotion—deep determination to accomplish something she thought important, a touch of indignation at some wrong, a bit of sorrow at the failure of others to reach her ideals, a flash of sympathy for someone who did not seem to be having a fair chance in life. At such moments we felt that Miss Shoemaker, calm as she might seem, had a deeply emotional life, and that her power as a teacher and as a woman lay in the warmth of her feelings.\n\nCarolyn enjoyed studying human character. The teaching of drama appealed to her the most because she was interested in the interplay of purpose and personality. She relished mortal complexities found in fiction, biography, and autobiography. As a member of Central Presbyterian Church, Carolyn taught “Bible Class in the Sabbath School” to a large group of Purdue coeds. The Bible was filled with the literary concepts Carolyn loved—drama, mortal complexities, purpose, and personality.\n\nT\n\nhe “unofficial” dean of women Emma McRae retired from Purdue in 1912. She was the first female faculty member to receive a Carnegie Foundation retirement grant. Andrew Carnegie had just established the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1911 “to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding” among the people of the United States. While Carnegie is best known for his establishment of free public libraries throughout America, he also supported education and teachers. He was shocked to discover that teachers, “one of the highest professions,” had less financial security than his former office clerks. His teacher retirement accounts are now called TIAA-CREF. The year after Emma retired, Purdue President Winthrop Stone called Carolyn, age forty-eight, into his office and offered her the newly created appointment of part-time dean of women. Many universities were establishing similar positions, and as Stone said, almost begrudgingly, he guessed\n\n8\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nPurdue should, too. Female students had lost their confidante and counselor when Emma retired. Shoemaker was surprised and in awe of the responsibility; she said she was not sure she could handle such a job. The story repeated in countless chronicles of Purdue history for the last century is that Stone bellowed, “Be a man, Miss Shoemaker! Be a man! Do not let this or any other task worry you.” Carolyn accepted the position of part-time dean of women in 1913, but she served Purdue very much like a woman. Student Marion L. Smith (in her memorial speech for Carolyn, titled “The Dean of Women”) described her: High aims and high ideals alone were not enough for Miss Shoemaker. One of the significant characteristics to which practically every coed made reference was her willingness to help—no problem brought to her by a coed was too small for her to consider; another characteristic was her desire to be reached easily by the coeds—she tried to be in her office whenever possible, and she was never too busy to see one; another trait was her sympathetic and understanding nature. She realized how important those problems were and what they meant to the girls who brought them, and she sincerely tried to solve those problems. Girls have actually gone into her office weeping and come out smiling.\n\nFemale faculty members in colleges across the United States were asked to serve a dual role as deans of women from the 1890s to the 1930s. The deans were to oversee the women who were the minority population on campus. They would insulate the women from the “maleness” of the campuses and, in turn, protect and guide the women. The deans were scholars who were concerned about the intellectual development of women, especially in competition with men. The presence of women on campuses made university presidents and male faculty members uneasy. Women in colleges raised concerns about propriety, delicate matters of health, and female “problems,” as well as the institutional responsibility to families to protect the safety, sexual virtue, and reputations of daughters far from home. For the uncomfortable males, appointing a dean of women to handle all those “unpleasant” female needs was the perfect solution. Yet Carolyn helped the less than one hundred females on Purdue’s campus with much more than matters of propriety. When women did\n\nCarolyn Shoemaker, a Faraway Look\n\n9\n\nnot have enough money to finish their degrees, Carolyn gave them financial assistance from her own pocketbook. She also abetted social troubles, “scholastic adjustments,” rooming house supervision, and general overseeing of all coed organizations and activities. The Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) was one of the oldest campus institutions. The YWCA sponsored the Big Sister Movement, by which the women in the upper classes familiarized the freshmen females with activities and customs. In later years, this program at Purdue would be named the “Green Guard.” Carolyn became Purdue’s first part-time dean of women the same year Alice Paul and Lucy Burns formed the Congressional Union (later named the National Woman’s Party) to work toward the passage of a federal amendment to give women the right to vote. Paul, age twenty-eight, “cut her teeth” as a suffragist in England. While there, she met Burns in London. On March 3, 1913, one day before President-elect Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration, Paul and Burns organized a strategically timed, majestically staged women’s suffrage parade with more than 5,000 marchers striding down Pennsylvania Avenue. Stunning and confident, Inez Milholland, a lawyer, led the parade. Draped in a cream cape that billowed in the breeze, she rode astride a snow-white horse. Holding a place of honor, immediately following, were women from seventeen countries that had already enfranchised women. Then came the “Pioneers,” women who had been struggling in the American suffrage movement for sixty-five years to secure the right to vote. The next section of the parade celebrated workingwomen, grouped by occupation and wearing the appropriate garb. There were nine bands, twenty-four floats, and a section for male supporters. The marchers waved American flags and bore signs and sashes in suffrage colors of purple, white, and gold that bore the words “Votes for Women.” About 500,000 spectators gathered along the route. Everyone was welcome to participate, with one exception. In a city that was southern in both location and attitude, where the Christmas Eve rape of a government clerk by a black man had percolated racist sentiments, Paul was convinced that some white women would not march with black women. In response to several inquiries, she had quietly discouraged blacks from participating.\n\n10\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nAware they were not wanted and in spite of fear that they may be attacked, a new Howard University African American sorority, Delta Sigma Theta, joined the procession. African American activists believed that if white women needed the vote to secure their rights, black women needed it even more. They faced discrimination on two levels—sex and race. The parade was the group’s first public act. Today, Delta Sigma Theta is one of the largest African American women’s organizations in the country, with an estimated 300,000 members around the world and a chapter at Purdue University. Meanwhile, panicky reports came from white suffragists in Chicago that Ida B. Wells-Barnett, an African American journalist and suffragist who led an antilynching campaign, planned to join the procession. When the Illinois unit assembled in the parade line, leaders of the group instructed Wells-Barnett to walk with an all-black group rather than under the flag of her home state. With tears in her eyes, Wells-Barnett refused to participate in the procession unless “I can march under the Illinois banner.” Wells-Barnett stood from the sidelines watching the cavalcade until she decided to solve the issue herself by defiantly walking, mid-parade, from the sidelines into the Illinois group, matching their stride and ignoring their stares. Wells-Barnett once said, “I felt that one had better die fighting against injustice than to die like a dog or a rat in a trap.” Few would notice Wells-Barnett’s bold move for the parade was about to turn to mayhem. Some of the onlookers, mostly men in town for the presidential inauguration, jeered, “Go back home where you belong.” Men surged into the street, making it difficult for the parade to pass. They snatched banners, grabbed at clothing, and tried to climb onto floats. Women were tripped, grabbed, shoved, spat upon, and many heard “indecent epithets” and “barnyard conversation.” The men marching in the parade were met with degrading remarks, such as, “Where are your skirts?” Rather than protecting the marchers, some of the police were amused by the sneers and laughter and joined in. A mass of humanity filled the streets, wearing bowlers and wide-brimmed hats, bundled in coats and gloves. While many policemen turned a blind eye to the marchers’ degrading and frightening circumstances, the unexpected heroes of the march were 1,500 Boy Scouts of America.\n\nCarolyn Shoemaker, a Faraway Look\n\n11\n\nThe Boy Scouts had been invited to the parade in full uniform—knickers, boots, hats, and staves—as volunteers to help with law enforcement. Their organization had been founded just three years earlier. Little did the Boy Scouts know when they agreed to assist the police, they would have to actually defend marchers from police inaction. The boys attempted to hold back the crowds and assisted the two ambulances that traveled to and from the hospital for six hours shuttling the one hundred injured. Eventually, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson authorized the use of a troop of cavalry from nearby Fort Myer to help control the crowd. Boys’ Life magazine featured a four-page article about the Scouts’ deeds in its April 1913 issue. The magazine reported that while the police initially told the Boy Scouts to stay behind their lines, the crowd soon overwhelmed law enforcement. Police were begging scouts for help and borrowing their staves. As a young organization, the Boy Scouts of America relished the good press. The Boys’ Life article concluded, “Washington and its respectable visitors will not soon forget the spectacle of boys in the uniform that stands for learning the principles of good citizenship actually restraining grown men from acting the part of brutes.” Even with the numerous difficulties, many marchers completed the parade route, which ended at the Treasury Building. The mistreatment of the marchers by both the crowd and the police led to Senate subcommittee hearings with more than 150 witnesses recounting their experiences. The superintendent of police for the District of Columbia lost his job. The committee heard multiple mentions of the heroic Boy Scouts. Despite the anger and violence, the suffragists considered the march a success, for it was the first national expression of demand for an amendment to the United States Constitution enfranchising women. The public outcry and press coverage after the event helped the suffragists’ cause. The parade reinvigorated the suffrage movement and aided in propelling the country toward the Nineteenth Amendment’s ratification on August 18, 1920. With a parade, a vision, and courage, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns reignited a national ardor for the women’s vote. This was America for women when Carolyn Shoemaker became the first dean of women at Purdue University.\n\n3\n\nArtists of Life\n\nS\n\nix years after Carolyn Shoemaker was appointed Purdue’s first dean of women, Stanley Coulter, Carolyn’s former instructor, was named Purdue’s first dean of men. Slowly, universities in the United States added the Office of the Dean of Men during the 1910s and 1920s. Administrators were jittery about women on campus, so they made rules and regulations for them and thought a dean of women was needed to guide the girls. The male students were left to their own devices with few rules, so at the outset, administrators didn’t think they needed a dean of men. In 1916, the deans of women united officially and founded the National Association of Deans of Women (NADW), a branch of the National Education Association (NEA). The first annual meeting, organized by Kathryn Sisson Phillips, dean of women at Ohio Wesleyan University, was entitled “What a Dean of Women Is—What Her Duties Are.” Gertrude S. Martin gave the key address at the first program and pinpointed poetically what a dean does: 13\n\n14\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nWe are trying to define the dean. Some say the dean is just a chaperone— a nice, ladylike person. Others say the dean is a necessary evil, a concession. . . . Others say the dean is a sort of adjunct to the President, because the President usually lacks at least one of the qualifications for the dean. The fact is the dean of women is unique! She is expected to teach and do a great many other things. She is preeminently a teacher of the art of living. She asks: How many of us are artists of life ourselves?\n\nOften when a group of women come together, there is a sisterhood formed that can facilitate change. The collecting of deans of women was no different. In the decades to follow, the NADW would prove to be a lobbying powerhouse and a force of nature as it connected deans of women throughout the country in common goals for females everywhere. Their discussions and resolutions were on cutting-edge topics. They came to define themselves as humanists. Future Purdue deans of women would make their marks and become known throughout the United States through the NADW, later named the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors (NAWDC). The early deans of women established the foundations of professional practice for student affairs and higher education administration. They developed a body of professional literature, which included journals, research reports, and books. The deans of women at Purdue would write many papers for such periodicals. The pioneering women of NADW worked hard to “professionalize” the position of dean and to legitimize her role. The deans of women were early champions of the scientific methods of guidance for students. After World War I, their vocation would be termed “student personnel work.” They often challenged each other and their campuses to “do the right thing” by women. During their first informal meeting in Chicago in 1903, the country’s collective deans of women passed a resolution condemning “gender segregation” in higher education. This cause to condemn gender segregation in universities perpetuates still today. In “How the Deans of Women Became Men,” printed in The Review of Higher Education, Robert A. Schwartz wrote candidly of the unfair, demeaning, and stereotypical views of deans of women: “Many of their\n\nArtists of Life\n\n15\n\nsignificant accomplishments have been lost or ignored in compilations of the modern history of higher education. What remains is an unfortunate caricature of deans of women as ‘snooping battle axes’—prudish spinsters who bedeviled the harmless fun seeking of their students.” Schwartz also gave his opinion as to why the achievements of deans of women have been disregarded: “This inaccurate view results from the male voice’s domination of written and oral histories of American colleges and universities . . . the accomplishments of deans of women have rarely received honest evaluation, validation, or appreciation. Rather, they have been discounted, discredited, or ignored.” Schwartz then imparted women deans their due: “In reality, the deans of women were consummate professionals who anchored much of their work to the academic principles of rigorous research and scholarly dissemination of their findings. Many of the significant and well-established practices of student affairs work and higher education administrations that exist today were first put in place through the work of the deans of women.” Additionally, the deans of men gathered as a group but with a very different mind-set and direction. The first recorded meeting of deans of men took place casually in 1919 “for a discussion of our problems.” The men came together because of a concern about student discipline. (Since the male students had few rules, unlike the females who had many, it is understandable that discipline would be a concern.) Two years later, the gathering formerly organized under the name of the National Association of Deans of Men (NADM). The meetings were social and club-like, sounding almost like a men’s society where they could imbibe and smoke cigars, in contrast to the professionalism of the national conferences of the deans of women. According to Schwartz: “The deans of men enjoyed the opportunity to converse, to enjoy local hospitalities and activities, and to regale each other with tales from their campuses. Over time, issues of professionalism, graduate study, and the role of the dean of men were topics of discussion, but they were addressed in a more affable, informal manner with less emphasis on scholarship and research than the deans of women demonstrated in their sessions.” Purdue’s own Dean of Men Stanley Coulter revealed his sense of humor when he described his position. Coulter said:\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\n16\n\nWhat is Dean of Men? I have tried to define him. When the Board of Trustees elected me Dean of Men, I wrote to them very respectfully and asked them to give me the duties of the Dean of Men. They wrote back that they did not know what they were but when I found out to let them know. I worked all the rest of the year trying to find out. I discovered that every unpleasant task that the president or the faculty did not want to do was my task. I was convinced that the Dean of Men’s office was intended as the dumping ground of all unpleasant things.\n\nC\n\narolyn’s love of language and literature blossomed in her speeches. The creation of a Community Center for Women began through her articulated words. During World War I, when women sewed bandages and knitted socks, gloves, and hats to be sent overseas to the men in battle, fifteen sewing machines belonging to war relief organizations were hauled around the city of Lafayette because they had no permanent resting spot where women could congregate and work for civic causes. Carolyn not only thought of the welfare and needs of her Purdue women, but she wanted to help women of her community. Lucy Eunice Coulter (wife of Purdue’s Stanley Coulter) was superintendent of the Industrial School and Free Kindergarten in Lafayette. Members of the Purdue faculty volunteered their services there. On Valentine’s Day that year, Carolyn was asked to speak to the women on the board of this organization. The title of her speech was “Civic Needs.” She talked about the necessity of a central meeting place and shelter for girls and women. Carolyn was concerned about women who visited the city from rural farms who spent time on the streets or in a lonely boarding house. There was no common meeting place open to them. Her speech was inspiring and roused the board to purchase a building to serve the community. The group found a home to purchase at 617 Ferry Street. Carolyn paid $800 into a fund to create the Community House. The Community House Association was formed, and with her large donation, Carolyn was made a life member of its board of directors.\n\nArtists of Life\n\n17\n\nEventually, the Industrial School and Free Kindergarten became a part of the public school system, and the Community House was used solely for women’s society meetings and rented sleeping rooms for women. The YWCA held its first meetings there. In subsequent years, Carolyn’s dean of women successors would also heed the call to help women and families of the Lafayette community and foster strong connections to the YWCA.\n\nA\n\ns early as 1913, Purdue’s female students were longing for a new residence hall and classroom building to replace the decaying Ladies Hall. Yet it would be years before they would see a new women’s residence hall built on Purdue’s campus. In the 1919 Debris yearbook, a poem called “The Coed’s Plea” was printed. In lighthearted rhyme, the women students lamented their need for a new building and how other new structures on campus, such as a new horse barn, received precedence over providing an adequate facility for women. Inside Ladies Hall, the walls were cracking and chunks of plaster fell into the bread dough the women mixed; the coeds were forced to work in dim light because many of the gaslights were inoperable; and dishpans were scattered around the building to catch leaks from the water pipes. The poem ended with these lines: “And now, Purdue, you wonder why / We’re sour and cross today. / It’s all because we coeds few / Are treated in this way.” Accompanying the poem printed in the 1919 Debris, Carolyn wrote an essay titled “Woman’s Building.” She said, “The number of girls enrolled in the University has been more than doubled in the past few years.” There were 247 women registered, and she attributed the increase to the fact that the women were offered courses that appealed to them, and “we have taken care of our girls.” Carolyn continued, “This, in fine, is the Purdue spirit. Progressive? Yes. And we have accomplished it all with no place that is peculiarly our own. But with a Woman’s Building with headquarters for our various activities,—well, just watch us and see!” In 1920, the women were still waiting for their new building, so Carolyn wrote another essay in the Debris, ending with words of empowerment: “With the advent of a Woman’s Building there will be a new order of things. And with a Dormitory we could beat the world.”\n\n18\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nCarolyn had established a rapport with the women students she affectionately called “my girls,” as is evident in a tribute they wrote to her: “She is sympathetic to the popular activities of the University and is ready to march across the levee at the head of the coeds whenever a college demonstration is to be made—and never is too weary to chaperone a campus dance, even into the ‘wee sma’ hours.’ ” In 1920, women gained the right to vote and Prohibition was instituted. The next year, the Indiana General Assembly passed a bill requiring the governor to select at least one woman among the six appointments to the Purdue University Board of Trustees. The women’s suffrage movement had put pressure on all public institutions to appoint qualified women when board positions became available. Indiana Governor Warren T. McCray selected Virginia Claypool Meredith, age seventy-two, as the first female member of the Purdue University Board of Trustees. Virginia had been a “lady farmer,” managing a 115-acre farm in Cambridge City, Indiana, after her husband passed away. She was a nationally known agricultural writer and speaker. At the age of forty, Virginia became a single mother when she adopted the children of her late best friend. Her adopted daughter was Mary L. Matthews, who would become Purdue’s first dean of home economics. Mary and her graduate students taught at the Industrial School and Free Kindergarten where Carolyn was a lifetime board member. During the Roaring Twenties, Virginia was the grand dame of Purdue. With so few women on campus and a rather small University population of approximately 3,200 students, her presence was noticeable at meetings and functions; photos show her with an understated regal air. Nearly always depicted as the only female standing with the other male trustees, she dressed in an ankle-length black dress, a cape, and a matching hat with plumes softly cascading over the brim. She wore black gloves and a scarf with a hefty tassel. Her layers of clothing seemed to weigh her down, for she stooped slightly with her head bowed; however, perhaps, rather than her strata of clothing, it was the enormity of being the first woman on the Purdue University Board of Trustees that pressed upon her. The first woman of any endeavor must set the pace and the example for those who follow in her stead.\n\nArtists of Life\n\n19\n\nAt her initial meeting as Purdue’s first female trustee, Virginia voted with the board to authorize the construction of the Home Economics Building, a structure that five decades later would be named after her adopted daughter. Once the Home Economics Building was completed, Virginia turned her attention to creating a much-needed women’s residence hall. Carolyn’s annual reports during the 1920s referred repeatedly to the need for scholarships, dormitory accommodations, and a women’s gymnasium. She continually expressed concern for the number of female students living in town for whom the University made no provision. In 1925, she urged the establishment of housing that would accommodate all freshmen women and thus do away with sorority rush, which she considered one of the worst aspects of college life. Often, women who were not selected for sorority membership withdrew from the University and returned home in humiliation and despair. Later, her successor, Dorothy Stratton, would share Carolyn’s aversion of rush and make a change in its structure. Because women students could not find housing close to campus, they often walked great distances, and in the winter, they walked in the dark in their high-top, heeled shoes. The women often were physically uncomfortable and vulnerable to exhaustion, especially in hot weather. The average outfit a woman wore back then, with its layers of garments, took nineteen yards of material and weighed almost twenty-five pounds. Virginia and a committee she established to study women’s housing recommended to the Purdue University Board of Trustees that Ladies Hall be renovated and used as a temporary dormitory until an adequate women’s hall could be erected. The board consented but put just enough money into the project to keep the building serviceable, and Ladies Hall housed fewer than fifty women. Five years later, the cost for more repairs exceeded what the board was willing to spend, and Ladies Hall was demolished. One of the last of Purdue’s five original buildings disappeared. Virginia thought that the demise of Ladies Hall would speed up the construction of a women’s dormitory. After all, fifty women had been displaced. She pointed out that most land-grant colleges in the Midwest already offered modern residence halls for women; however, Purdue administrators again leased rooms for female students in local homes, and even Dean of Women Carolyn Shoemaker had to follow suit.\n\n20\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nOne of the homes was the George Dexter house on Marsteller Street where today’s Marsteller Parking Garage is located. This was where Carolyn made her office and home with some of her students. In 1928, Frank Cary offered $60,000 to build a residence hall for women, which was to be named in memory of his wife who had passed away. The Carys previously had given money for the building of a men’s dormitory in memory of their late son. Today, that building is named Cary East, part of Cary Quadrangle. Virginia was appreciative and thanked Frank Cary for his gift in a heartfelt resolution read to the board. The group assured Frank that they would borrow sufficient additional funds necessary to complete the construction of the women’s residence hall. With the go-ahead for the project, Virginia and the other trustees decided they would no longer lease the home for women students on Marsteller Street. As a result, Carolyn lost her office and was given a temporary space in the Engineering Administration Building. It would turn out to be not so “temporary.” The plan was that the women’s dormitory would be built on property on what is today called Russell Street. Purdue expected to acquire this land from owner Phillip Russell. Years before, Phillip’s parents had donated land to John Purdue for the construction of the University; however, Phillip was not as generous as his parents and did not want to donate the land. The Women’s Residence Hall project faced suits and countersuits as Purdue tried to gain control of the Russell property. Frank Cary grew tired of waiting and eventually found another project in which he memorialized his late wife. He built the Jessie Levering Cary Home for Children in Lafayette. Though Frank would not donate funds to build a women’s dormitory, he agreed to give money to build another men’s dormitory near Cary Hall. Not wanting to lose a chance at a donation, the Purdue board, including Virginia, agreed that the money would be accepted for the construction of another men’s dorm. The male administration did not place a high priority on bringing female students to Purdue. Virginia had spent nine years working for better housing for women with nothing to show for her efforts, and Purdue’s enrollment of women was in jeopardy. Why would women choose to attend Purdue if adequate and safe housing was unavailable? It appears excuses\n\nArtists of Life\n\n21\n\nwere made. Bids came in “too high,” the designated land was caught in a legal battle, and the men in administration wondered how many women would actually be able to afford and want to stay in the new dormitory. Virginia, Carolyn, and the female students they fostered were left in limbo. While Virginia spent much of her energy on women’s residential concerns, she also headed the effort to build Purdue’s Memorial Union. Just two months after she was appointed to the board, Virginia was named president of the Purdue Memorial Union Association Board of Governors. She was the principal figure in the design, construction, financing, and management of the building dedicated to the more than four thousand alumni who had served in the Civil War and World War I. Raising money to build the Memorial Union was an ongoing, agonizing process. She led the groundbreaking for the building in 1922, but it was not completed until 1930 when Virginia was eighty years old. This long gap was due to donors who were not honoring their commitments to pay their pledges to finance the construction; however, Carolyn made a handsome donation of $5,000 (the equivalent of $65,000 today), the largest contribution made by a woman.\n\n4\n\nFar Horizons\n\nA\n\nfter the Nineteenth Amendment was passed and women received the right to vote, many suffragists “retired” from activism, but Alice Paul, the famed suffragist who organized the march on Washington in 1913, continued to toil for women’s equality. In 1923, Alice announced a new constitutional amendment she authored and named the Lucretia Mott Amendment. It stated. “Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.” Like Alice, Lucretia Mott was a Quaker. She and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were the organizers of the Seneca Falls Convention in New York “to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of women.” Lucretia was a fluent, moving speaker for human rights who remained composed even before hostile audiences. She was the consummate role model for Alice, and it was fitting that Alice named the amendment after her. In the decades to follow, Alice would work assiduously for the passage of the Lucretia Mott Amendment, which would be reworded and named 23\n\n24\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nthe Alice Paul Amendment, before it would be termed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until 1972. After Congress passed the amendment nearly fifty years after Alice first introduced it, the ERA ultimately was not endorsed by enough states to be ratified. Every step of the way, each year the ERA was presented and debated in Congress and at statehouses, the National Association of Deans of Women steadfastly supported its ratification. During this time, female students in higher education sought equality with regard to honor societies. Since women were not considered for membership in most of the men’s honor societies, women began forming their own local groups. At Purdue, the Home Economics Society was renamed the Virginia C. Meredith Club in the spring of 1925 to esteem the revered first and only female trustee. Honor societies and other forms of recognition are vital for a woman’s development of ambition. In Necessary Dreams: Ambition in Women’s Changing Lives, psychiatrist Anna Fels wrote of the two emotional engines of ambition: the mastery of chosen skills and the essential recognition of that mastery by others. In The Good Girls Revolt by Lynn Povich, Fels is quoted as saying that women are “subtly discouraged from pursing their goals by a pervasive lack of recognition for their accomplishments.” For centuries, women have feared that seeking recognition will open them up for ridicule about how they live their lives, with attacks on most anything, including their popularity, femininity, and motherhood. Povich states in her book, “But recognition in all its forms—admiration from peers, mentoring, institutional rewards, and societal approval—is something that makes us better at what we do.” Fels explained that without it, “people get demoralized and ambitions erode.” Thus, on college campuses, women’s honor societies were and are crucial to foster female ambition and success. Mortar Board was the first national organization honoring senior college women. It began with a chance meeting of two women from separate societies wearing identical pins. In the fall of 1915 on the campus of the University of Chicago, a member of the Ohio State University honor society, called Mortar Board, met a member of the Pi Sigma Chi honor society from Swarthmore College. Both women wore lapel pins in the\n\nFar Horizons\n\n25\n\nshape of a mortarboard, the tasseled academic cap with a square, flat top worn at graduation ceremonies. The women remarked of their identical pins and realized each represented a different honor society for women with similar ideals and traditions. The main difference between the two honor societies was the name. Three years later, a founding meeting for the Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society took place at Syracuse University. Female representatives at the meeting were from Cornell University, the University of Michigan, the Ohio State University, and Swarthmore College. Representatives from Syracuse University also were in attendance, but this university did not choose to join the national organization when it later became Mortar Board. Years later, Barbara Cook, who would become a Purdue University dean of students, gave her theory on why Mortar Board came to be: “My guess is that women in the early twentieth century were not taken very seriously as scholars or as leaders. In 1916, women were not yet allowed to vote. So perhaps Mortar Board originated from a feeling of being excluded and isolated as women in higher education.” Many of the traditions established for Mortar Board were taken from the original Ohio State Chapter, including the name, their initiation rituals, and the pin in the shape of a mortarboard with the insignia of three Greek letters—ΠΣΑ (Pi Sigma Alpha)—meaning service, scholarship, and leadership. Barbara Cook said: Service as a concept has always been familiar and appropriate to the feminine domain, but surely there was something adventuresome about suggesting to college women in 1916 that scholarship and leadership were achievable qualities for women. Although the collegiate fashion of the day was that of secret societies bathed in mysticism and meeting by the hoot of an owl at midnight, there is no evidence that Mortar Board was ever intended to be anything but open and available to both public and academic scrutiny.\n\nWith Carolyn Shoemaker’s impetus, the thirty-sixth chapter of Mortar Board was chartered at Purdue University in November 1926. Carolyn became an honorary member. That year 631 women were enrolled out of the\n\n26\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\napproximately 3,500 students. A russet suede commemorative scrapbook with leather ties at the binding and a metal Purdue medallion affixed to the center of its cover contains the original handwritten petition for a charter. The mellow gold pages are filled with particulars and photographs about the University. Under the lovely handwritten words “Purdue Facts,” the text eloquently states the mantra of the land-grand institution: “Purdue’s sole cause for existence is service to the people of the state, not only in the training of young people here on the campus, but in the carrying of information out to residents of the state unable to come to the institution for its advantages.” The scrapbook contains black and white photographs of each “active” and a listing of her activities. Each woman smiles from under her Roaring Twenties hat and drop-waist dress. The group would provide scholarships to many women who would otherwise be unable to obtain a college education. The money for the scholarships was raised through Mortar Board-sponsored events, such as the “coed bid dance” and the Gingham Gallop held each spring. In subsequent years, each succeeding Purdue dean of women and dean of students would be a member and advisor to Mortar Board. Today, the national headquarters for Mortar Board is located in Columbus, Ohio, as an affiliate of Ohio State University. In 2014, Mortar Board’s third executive director is Jane Hamblin, a Purdue University graduate who formerly worked in Purdue’s Office of the Dean of Students. At the encouragement of the men’s athletic booster group, the Gimlet Club, the Purdue Mortar Board organized a junior and senior women’s athletic booster club called the Gold Peppers. Adorning their heads, the Gold Pepper women wore gold felt beanies called “pots.” The Gold Peppers served as Purdue’s pep club.They attended football and basketball games where they sold candy and led the crowds in cheers In the early years, a newly elected pledge wore a black pot, one gold and one black bobby sock, and a black and gold armband. She carried a cigar box filled with candy and, dangling from a ribbon, a real green pepper gilded in gold leaf. The pledge carried the pepper for days, and often it would rot. After the pledge became a full-fledged active member of the\n\nFar Horizons\n\n27\n\ngroup, she turned her beanie inside out and displayed the celebrated gold side that was decorated with an image of a pepper. In the stands and on the bleachers the audience was “peppered” with gold pots. After World War II, the women organized veterans’ dances known as “Pepper Shakers.” In the 1960s, the Gold Peppers celebrated the end of their yearly activities with a “Smarty Party” to honor high-achieving sophomore women and award an annual scholarship to one of those entering graduate school. The Gold Peppers disbanded in the 1970s. Women and society had changed. Wearing a gold pot was outmoded, and by then, the term had taken on a new meaning in the slang prevalent on college campuses.\n\nS\n\narah Ely was a member of the Community House Association in Lafayette, where Carolyn was active. Sarah married her boss, Thomas Duncan, who founded the Duncan Electrical Manufacturing Company in 1901 in Lafayette. Duncan Electric produced electrical meters that were used in homes and businesses around the world. Thomas Duncan was an inventor and industrialist who held 150 patents. He traveled to Europe and took a safari tour of Africa in 1922. Upon his return, he wanted to entertain his wide circle of friends with his movies and a lecture about his adventures. He engaged the entire first floor of the Community House for his travelogue, but he found it too small. It was then that he decided to make provisions in his will for the creation of “an adequate hall” for the people of Lafayette. When he died in1929, Duncan left money to the Community House Association to construct a new building where the Victorian house once stood. A new two-story, redbrick Georgian colonial with stone trim and a slate roof was constructed in 1931. The structure boasted walnut panel walls, marble floors, a balcony overlooking a ballroom, richly decorated meeting rooms, a tearoom, and live-in hostess quarters. As stipulated in Duncan’s will, a board of thirty women was to be elected to manage the facility. The regal building still graces Ferry Street, where citizens hold wedding receptions, piano recitals, quilt shows, concerts, art shows, club meetings, and teas. Duncan provided the money for the hall, but it had\n\n28\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nbeen Carolyn who originally energized the idea of a community hall back in 1914 through her speech, “Civic Needs.” On March 1, 1933, Carolyn was scheduled to speak at Duncan Hall to the educational and social group called the Twentieth Century Club, but she failed to show. Members of the club attempted to locate her, calling her office and her home in Varsity Apartments, located a block from the Purdue Memorial Union. Unable to contact Carolyn, club members became alarmed, for she seldom missed a meeting in which she provided the program reviewing the latest current literature. The club contacted the office of Purdue’s President Edward C. Elliott and spoke with Helen Hand, Elliott’s secretary. Helen checked the University calendar and determined there was no record of any engagement to account for the dean’s absence. Helen then contacted a janitor at the Varsity Apartments to check Carolyn’s home. The janitor unlocked Carolyn’s door that afternoon and found the dean lying on her bed, unconscious. It appeared that she had been stricken while she prepared to retire the prior evening. The newspaper account read: “The lights were burning. The morning milk bottles had not been taken in, and papers at her office, placed under the door, had not been disturbed. Nor her mail touched. She had only one class in English scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday, and her absence from it had not been reported.” Physicians were summoned, and Carolyn was rushed by ambulance to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Lafayette. The newspaper stated that after her arrival at the hospital, Carolyn uttered a few words to one of the Catholic sisters on staff, which indicated she was partly conscious for a time, but she never spoke again. Carolyn died of apoplexy and acute uremia that night. Today, apoplexy is referred to as a stroke. Uremia is a condition that results from kidney failure. Some accounts say that Carolyn passed away from nephritis, which is inflammation of the nephrons in the kidneys caused by infections, toxins, or autoimmune diseases. Carolyn had not complained of feeling ill and had gone about her numerous duties as usual, so her sudden passing stunned all who knew her. The newspaper headline the day after Carolyn’s death stated, “Community Shocked by Death of Dean Carolyn Shoemaker.” Carolyn’s funeral was at Central Presbyterian Church, where she had taught Sunday\n\nFar Horizons\n\n29\n\nschool. Pastor W. R. Graham said, “The key to the amazing life of service of Dean Shoemaker was selflessness.” She was referred to as “a student, teacher, executive, club woman, alert citizen, and ‘foster mother’ to an ever changing and ever increasing host of young people.” The newspaper said of Carolyn: “She was a deep student of human nature, sympathetic and helpful to all. Her philanthropies were so numerous and extensive that she seemed to overlook completely her own comforts and convenience. From her vast store of literary information and understanding, was able to act as guide and interpreter of books and writers. At the same time her own personality served to awaken new interest in the subjects she discussed.” Carolyn’s casket was covered with a blanket of red roses, a tribute from the University she loved. All of the student organizations of Purdue honored their cherished dean with a huge spray of calla lilies and roses. Relatives and University officials asked that all others omit flowers and instead give to the newly established Carolyn E. Shoemaker Scholarship fund. Carolyn was buried in Springvale Cemetery in Lafayette. Purdue held a memorial service in Eliza Fowler Hall on April 19, 1933. President Elliott presided. He and Harry G. Leslie, the governor of Indiana who was born in West Lafayette, spoke to the crowd of their personal loss. Marion L. Smith, a student, recounted a story that Carolyn had told during a speech to a group of coeds the previous October. Paraphrased, the story describes a morning when Carolyn was walking down State Street, the main avenue through Purdue’s campus, when a child and her mother approached. As they were about to pass, the child recognized Carolyn and spoke to her. The mother did not know the dean. Perhaps the child knew Carolyn from time spent at the New Community House and Industrial School and Free Kindergarten. The mother asked the child who the passing woman was, and the youngster looked up in surprise and said very emphatically: “Why, Mama, she is the mother of all the Purdue girls!” Dean Emeritus Stanley Coulter spoke of Carolyn, whom he had known since she was a student nearly forty-five years before. He had watched Carolyn metamorphose from student to professor to dean of women. He said:\n\n30\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nDuring all of those years that “faraway’ look in her eyes deepened, and those same years brought its interpretation to me. You may have visited Atlantic City. . . . You may have wearied of its meaningless monotony and turned your eyes seaward following the long line of a great pier. There, at its uttermost limit, you may have seen a few, perhaps only one or two, who, utterly unmindful of the gay throngs, gazed steadfastly seaward, seemingly striving to penetrate far, far horizons. What lay beyond those horizons of opportunity for growth and service? Dean Shoemaker was one of those who constantly gazed upon far horizons. Apparently removed from the bustle and confusion round her, she gazed steadfastly into the future. What did it have for her of opportunity and service and growth? But it loomed larger and larger before her, and she grew into and became a part of those far horizons.\n\n5\n\nDorothy Stratton Finds a Bible\n\nI\n\nt was during the Great Depression, as thousands of Americans were unemployed and a decade-long drought helped to create the Dust Bowl, when Dorothy Stratton, age thirty-four, received a phone call. She had just finished her PhD at Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City and was happily employed as dean and vice principal of girls at Sturges Senior High School in San Bernardino, California. The president of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, was on the line. Edward C. Elliott invited Dorothy to interview for the position of Purdue’s first full-time dean of women. Soon after that fateful call, Dorothy journeyed by train across the parched countryside to Purdue where she was introduced to, as she said, “everybody from the president to the janitors.” It is not clear how Elliott knew of Dorothy. One speculation is that Elliott obtained Dorothy’s name through mutual Columbia University connections. Elliott had received an honorary degree from Columbia in 1929. Dorothy received her PhD from that institution in 1932. Perhaps 31\n\n32\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nPresident Elliott asked his friends at Columbia to recommend someone for the position of dean of women to replace Carolyn Shoemaker. Decades later, Dorothy said good-naturedly, “I came from California to be looked over.” She met with R. B. Stewart, vice president for finance, and Mary L. Matthews, the dean of home economics and the only female dean at Purdue. Dorothy accepted the offered position and became Purdue’s first full-time dean of women. Dorothy was outdoorsy, easygoing, and attractive, with short, dark, wavy hair, thin lips that smiled pleasantly, and confident almond-shaped blue eyes. She wore the latest dresses or two-piece, knit business frocks with cowl necks and shin-length skirts or a herringbone wool blazer over a white blouse. To look at Dorothy was to see a woman comfortable in her own skin. After Dorothy was offered the dean of women position, she purchased her first car, a $200 secondhand Dodge. Her parents, Reverend Richard Lee and Anna Troxler Stratton, lived with her. The three drove from California to Indiana in the used car, which sporadically lost its brakes during the cross-country trek. The trio discovered late in the trip that “a suction cup had been put in the wrong way.” Dorothy was born on March 24, 1899, in Brookfield, Missouri. Her broad-minded father was a Baptist minister who had been born in Rothville, where Dorothy’s grandfather had a large plantation during the Civil War. Her mother was a homemaker from Louisville, Kentucky, who met her husband when he was attending a Baptist seminary there. When Dorothy was growing up with her brother, Richard, the family moved every three or four years to small communities throughout Missouri and Kansas as her father ministered from church to church. Dorothy entered grade school a year earlier than the average child back then. She said, “I was always very fond of school. In fact, my father took me to visit when I was only five, and I was so crazy about it, they never could get me away. So the teacher finally gave up and let me enroll.” Dorothy was a bookworm, spending time in the library rather than with groups of friends who may have seen her as the minister’s daughter who would put a damper on their social lives. Dorothy was a lifelong learner, and her love of reading and knowledge would continue as she lived into the twenty-first century. Her academic\n\nDorothy Stratton Finds a Bible\n\n33\n\nprowess was combined with a fervent independence likely fostered as she moved from town to town, school to school, always the new girl in the classroom. Dorothy had a strong devotion to her parents. She said, “From my father I learned to have an abiding interest in people and to want to be of service to my fellow man. He taught me the importance of intangibles. From my mother I learned to make the most of simple things. She was able to create a happy home atmosphere and to make you physically comfortable on very little. Ours was a typical minister’s family. We actually received ‘missionary barrels’ in Kansas, although none of my friends will believe it. They were good barrels, too.” The term “missionary barrel” is synonymous with used clothing and hand-me-downs. The contents were cast-offs from donors or even foodstuffs. The filled barrels or packages were gifts to help missionaries survive in their work that afforded them little money. Dorothy was five years older than her brother. She said, “I had to look after him, iron his blouses, take care of him during church services, and final humiliation, occasionally take him out with me on dates!” As an undergraduate, Dorothy had attended Ottawa University, a Baptist college in Ottawa, Kansas. Dorothy said, “Of course, nobody in (other parts) of the country ever heard of Ottawa University. They think it’s in Canada. I’ve just given up on trying to correct that impression.” Dorothy wanted to learn to dance, but dancing was not something that the daughter of a Baptist minister was allowed to do. She managed to pick up a few dance steps where she wasn’t supposed to—at her Baptist college. She would go on to chaperone so many dances during her career that she claimed dancing “lost its glamour.” Known in her neighborhood as a tomboy, Dorothy loved to play ball and tennis, with no interest in cooking or sewing. At Ottawa, she played on the school basketball team and won the women’s tennis championship in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference. She served on the staff of the school newspaper, the yearbook, and as a member of the student council. Though most of her friends did not go to college, Dorothy always knew she would pursue higher education. “It was never a question,” she said. “I was very academically oriented.” After she graduated in 1920, Dorothy\n\n34\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nwas offered a position on the Ottawa newspaper. As a young avid reader, she had dreamed of writing the proverbial great American novel. She said, “I don’t know what gave me the idea, but it was there. I don’t recall that I expected to go through any apprentice period. I just expected that said masterpiece would spring full-blown from the head of Zeus.” Dorothy turned down the newspaper job in favor of the field of education and moved to Renton, Washington, to teach physical education. She said, “My reception there was a trifle sour. When I arrived, the principal took one look and told the superintendent, ‘We surely have picked a lemon this time.’” During the Great Depression, Dorothy worked to pay off her parents’ debts and to put her brother through medical school. “Baptists ministers didn’t make much in those days,” she explained. With her zest for learning and her abiding interest in others, Dorothy wanted to discover why people behaved the way they did. In 1923, she enrolled at the University of Chicago for a year of graduate study in psychology. She left with her master’s degree and the realization that not even psychology can explain all the “whys” of the human race. She recalled, “I found that employers wanted firstly, a man with a PhD degree; secondly, a man with a master’s degree; thirdly, a woman with a doctoral degree, and very fourthly, a woman with a master’s degree. Having no money to continue my studies, I went to San Bernardino, California, as dean of girls and vice principal of the high school. I was working under my former principal of the ‘lemon’ quotation.” In California, Dorothy learned to love the outdoor life in a way that had never been possible before. She soaked in the desert, mountains, and seashore. She loved to look from her office window at Mount San Bernardino, gaining strength and serenity from the peaceful view. After several years at San Bernardino, Dorothy traveled to Teachers College of Columbia University to study student personnel administration. During her year at the university, she stayed in the International House with students from fifty-seven countries. Early in 1933, she received her PhD and returned to San Bernardino. That’s when President Elliott called. She came to Purdue not only as dean of women, but also as an associate professor of psychology. Her salary was $3,300 a year, about $100 more than she was paid in California.\n\nDorothy Stratton Finds a Bible\n\n35\n\nEven before Dorothy became dean of women, she had accomplished much in a time when few females attended college, worked outside the home, or made a respectable living. Yet for Dorothy, still in her mid-thirties, the best was yet to come. Her life would be filled with accomplishments that inspired other women. When Dorothy and her parents arrived at Purdue, they were lodged at the Fowler Hotel across the Wabash River in Lafayette. She said, “After having lived in beautiful California, I moved to a seared state [referring to drought-devastated Indiana]. I thought to myself, ‘I can’t stand it.’ The minute I got across to West Lafayette, the people were so nice—so really nice—I changed my mind.” Dorothy was appointed dean in August 1933, and she was given what had been the office of the part-time dean of women located on the top floor of Fowler Hall. Dorothy said, “The dean preceding me was Carolyn Shoemaker, who must have been a very fine person. I never met her. She had great respect from people on campus.” Dorothy climbed to the top of Fowler Hall carrying a box of her workplace goods and discovered that the Office of the Dean of Women was more like the Closet of the Dean of Women. The room was about six-byeight feet. Tucked away from the accesses of student life, it was a tiny room about to be inhabited by a world of a woman. Dorothy set about moving her files and papers into her new desk. Someone had been given the task of emptying the desk after Carolyn’s sudden death. As Dorothy began to arrange pens and paperclips, she opened a drawer and found in its shadowy recesses a book. Dorothy pulled the book from the drawer, feeling the nubby texture of the cover; the scent of leather preceded the exhumation. It was a Bible. She thumbed through the soft, India paper. The title page indicated that the Bible was a 1901 standard edition, “Translated out of the original tongues.” Dorothy thought of her predecessor, whom she had never met but had heard mentioned with great reverence. Was the Bible inadvertently left inside of Carolyn’s desk? Or did the person with the unpleasant task of clearing elect to leave the testaments for the next dean of women?\n\n36\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nAs the daughter of a Baptist minister, Dorothy was no stranger to the Holy Bible. An analytical thinker, she had her questions regarding its stance on such topics as women and their place. She wrote in 1971 letter, “Aside from the Adam and Eve story, Paul has done more to set back the progress of women than almost any other person. Many people are greatly influenced by Bible references. Probably, we all are, even though unconsciously.” Dorothy placed the Bible back into the drawer and continued her task of cultivating the Office of the Dean of Women.\n\nD\n\norothy and her parents obtained a house at 825 Salisbury in West Lafayette. Her father worked as a representative for the Equitable Life Assurance Society in the Lafayette Life Building on the courthouse square in Lafayette. Dorothy’s first goal as dean of women was to campaign for a more accessible office. She said of her out-of-sight, out-of-mind alcove, “Students would really have to want to see me to find me.” She accomplished the relocation of her office by the “Elliott method,” which President Elliott himself described: “First, you ask the president for something, and he says, ‘no.’ Then you come back and ask again—and he says ‘no’ again. The third time you come back to ask, you pound on his desk, and he says, ‘Oh, go ahead and do it!’” Dorothy explained that her experience was a bit different than Elliott’s take: “Well, it turned out just the other way; it was the president who yelled, and I was the one who went and did it. I was never much of a pounder, but I learned how to operate with Elliott.” Apparently, Dorothy was, indeed, a quick study of the Elliott method, for her office was moved to the ground floor of the Engineering Administration Building, next to the office of the much-revered Dean of the Schools of Engineering Andrey A. Potter and across the hall from Dean of Men Martin L. Fisher, who had succeeded Stanley Coulter. Dorothy said she made every effort to furnish the Office of the Dean of Women to create a friendly, informal, and cheerful atmosphere. At a 1988 Mortar Board Leadership Conference, recorded on a videotape now stored in the Purdue Archives, Dorothy, then age eightynine, spoke to a group of students about her first days as dean of women:\n\nDorothy Stratton Finds a Bible\n\n37\n\nWhen I came to Purdue in 1933, of course we didn’t have all the things that you have now. We were very simple, and we didn’t have very much of anything for women. No university housing, no placement service for women, no bachelor of arts degree in the University. So it was a lot of fun to start from scratch and see what could be done. The Dean of Women’s Office consisted of me, period. No secretary, no staff, just me. I wanted to have the image of the dean of women not to be one of discipline. I thought no intelligent person would spend her life in a job that had discipline at its core, and I didn’t want students to say when they left, “I was never called into the dean’s office once while I was in the University” and be proud of that.\n\nThere were 500 female students at Purdue when Dorothy assumed her deanship. That was about one woman to seven men. She said of the campus, “It was like the old definition of an island—a small body of women completely surrounded by men.” Years later, Dorothy reminisced about what she and her women students lacked, yet also what they possessed in abundance: “We didn’t have anything fancy like career counseling. We didn’t know what it meant. We didn’t have television, drip-dries, or power steering. What we did have was trust in each other, and that was very important.” In Dorothy’s 1933 annual report, she shared her most frequently asked question, “Just what does the dean of women do?” Dorothy said her office had two main functions: the first was to ensure that the environment in which female students lived, worked, and played was conducive to development and growth. The second was to be of assistance to the individual student. In short, her office was a clearinghouse for matters pertaining to the welfare of female students. Her annual dean of women report was the first to refer to female students as “women” rather than “girls.” In her leisure time, Dorothy enjoyed shooting baskets in the women’s gym. It was there that she befriended a newly arrived graduate student named Helen Blanche Schleman. Helen worked part-time in the Department of Physical Education, refereeing women’s basketball games at twenty-five cents an hour while she earned her master’s degree in psychology and education. The two women had a lot in common. They had\n\n38\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nboth arrived at Purdue the same year and were well educated, brilliant, athletic—both golfers—and forethinkers. Maybe that’s why some people often mistook one for the other. Helen said, “I appeared on campus and everybody sort of bowed and scraped. They were nice and friendly to me. I soon found out that they were confusing me with Dorothy Stratton!” The National Youth Administration (NYA) had just been established on Purdue’s campus. During the Great Depression, many young people could not afford the cost of even a high school education. Taking stock of these grim statistics, Eleanor Roosevelt remarked that she often had “moments of real terror when I think we might be losing this generation.” She persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to create the NYA, a New Deal program established by an executive order in June 1935. The NYA created part-time jobs for high school and college students, and it provided relief and job training to unemployed young people. The goal was to prevent students from dropping out of high school and college due to financial hardship by providing grants in return for part-time work in such places as libraries and cafeterias. For the female students at Purdue, the NYA initiative was assigned to the Office of the Dean of Women. Dorothy needed a part-time staff member to organize and administer the program. She hired her new acquaintance, Helen Schleman, for the position that paid seventy-five cents an hour. At the time, Dorothy had no idea she was mentoring the next dean of women and fashioning a friendship that would span six decades.\n\n6\n\nHelen Schleman, Born in the Right Moment\n\nH\n\nelen B. Schleman said she was born fifty years before her time. What she meant was that she lived during an era when women were not given the same opportunities afforded to men. Yet Helen seemingly grabbed with gusto every life prospect that appeared before her, and her “progressive” thinking about what women could do arrived at the perfect time—when women needed her convictions most. Helen was born in Francesville, Indiana, on June 21, 1902, to William and Blanche Hollett Schleman. In the summer of 1912 when she was ten, Helen moved with her parents and two brothers, Herbert and Delos, to Valparaiso, Indiana. Her father had been in the harness, buggy, and farm implement business and owned Gas-well Farm. He sold the business and purchased an eight-hundred-acre farm called Breyfogle Ranch. The Schlemans were active in the Methodist Church. Every Sunday morning from spring through fall, Helen’s mother brought one or two bouquets of flowers from her garden to adorn the church altar. 39\n\n40\n\nThe Deans’ Bible\n\nHelen’s father also owned a real estate and insurance business, the Schleman-Morton Company, and the Valparaiso Home Ice Company, but his real interest was in land development. In the 1920s, he opened several housing developments including, with great pride, Forest Park, a subdivision with several wooded homesites surrounded by a seven-hole golf course. Helen was essentially weaned on golf, and she would live near a golf course for most of her life. She was athletic, as was her younger brother, Delos, who died of a heart problem at age eighteen. Delos was described as a “tall, lanky boy, a good student, but a better golfer.” The Schlemans donated Forest Park Golf Course to the city of Valparaiso in 1947, with the stipulation that it be restored and operated as a municipal facility. Two years later, the course was expanded from seven to nine holes with a clubhouse, and a dedication ceremony was held. William was asked to tee up the first ball. Thirty years later, land was purchased to create an additional nine holes. Another dedication ceremony was held, and among those teeing off that day in 1973 was Helen Schleman. Helen had a broad, open face with blue eyes. She swept her brown hair away from her high forehead, and when she smiled broadly, her inner zest was unmistakable. To look at Helen was to see woman standing on solid ground. In 1920, the year women won the right to vote, Helen entered Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, because it was relatively close to home and was easy to reach. She claimed that young people didn’t receive much guidance as to college selection back then. Helen said, “I had a marvelous four years—garnered two majors, one in English literature and one in philosophy—had a terrible time with organic chemistry—had plenty of time to play tennis, field hockey, baseball, basketball, and golf.” Helen was president of the Women’s Athletic Association, and she worked with the YWCA, student government, and Mortar Board. The organizations she enjoyed and believed in early on would continue to remain close to her heart throughout her life. As student president of Northwestern’s Women’s Athletic Association in 1922, Helen, age twenty, attended the national Athletic Conference of American College Women, held at the University of California over Easter weekend, where she gave a “splendid report.” Her talk was on the successful\n\nHelen Schleman, Born in the Right Moment\n\n41\n\nlaunching of the official national publication of the Newsletter of the Athletic Conference of American College Women. Helen was an assistant editor of the student publication and would become the editor the following year. A newspaper account of the convention tells of Helen’s future goals for the Women’s Athletic Association and foreshadows what would become her career philosophy for decades to come: “One of the highlights toward local progress, which Miss Schleman advocated for the association, was the taking of a bigger place in shaping campus ideals. ‘The WAA has a definite place in campus activities,’ she advised. ‘We must not only maintain our present standing, but show a marked development at the next national conference in 1927 at Cornell University.’” Helen’s youthful vocal stance on increasing the visibility and power of the Women’s Athletic Association for every American college and “shaping campus ideals” occurred at the same synergistic moment when Virginia Meredith and Carolyn Shoemaker were speaking out in the struggle for a women’s residence hall to be built at Purdue. Across America, women were plodding along and joining forces to bring females’ collective needs to the forefront of higher education. Helen graduated in 1924 with, as she said, an “AB degree.” AB is an abbreviation of the Latin name (artium baccalaureus) for the bachelor of arts (BA) degree. Yet Helen was not actually expected to do something with her degree. Years later, she said in a speech: Nobody—not the dean of women, not any of my professors, not anyone in my residence hall—no one, and least of all, I, myself, expected me to do anything with my college education. Exposure to higher education was just supposed to make you a better person for your traditional role as wife and mother. No one asked me what I was going to do when I graduated.
