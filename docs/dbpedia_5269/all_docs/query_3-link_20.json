        "text": "Information for Candidates\n\nSummer 2024 Results, Appeals and Certificates\n\nAssessed Grades\n\nFor GCSE exam boards mark students’ completed exam papers. Examiners are mostly experienced teachers and do most of their marking on-screen. Examiners’ work is quality-checked by the exam boards to ensure their marking is consistent and to the required standard.\n\nIf your qualification includes non-exam assessment — for example practical work or a performance – this may be marked by the exam board, or by your teacher.\n\nTo support your understanding, please refer to Ofqual’s link below for more information.\n\nResults\n\nOn candidate statements of results (results slip) and certificates, grades will be reported in the same way as in previous years.\n\nFor further information on GCSE results grading please click on the link below.\n\nGCSE factsheet for parents (publishing.service.gov.uk)\n\nWJEC marking is as follows - M = Merit Level 2, P1 = Pass Level 1, P2 = Pass level 2, U = ungraded and X indicates part or all of the paper has not been sat.\n\nResults will be issued on results day in August as follows:\n\nArrangements for results day\n\nPlease be aware that neither Marland Residential or Secondary School sites will be open to students or parents / carers on this day. Please do not try to ring in to either of the sites on the day as the Examination Officer will be working to download / despatch all examination results on the morning of 22th August. These will then be emailed and posted by First Class mail to the email / postal address we hold on our system for students.\n\nConcerns about your results\n\nWhen you receive your results, if you think that a grade is wrong, your first step should be to contact our Head of Centre Matt Tithecott – m.tithecott@marland.devon.sch.uk\n\nInformation on the appeals process can be accessed via the link in this form, an electronic copy of this form can be found on the main Marland School website (Parents drop down / Exams) where you can click on the links to bring up the information.\n\nCertificates\n\nCertificates, when received from the awarding organisations, will be issued to you in due course – normally at the end of November when all certificates have been received.\n\nOfqual Student Guide 2024 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)\n\nThe arrangements for appeals\n\nMarland School will support its students through the awarding organisation appeals process.\n\nThe information below describes the arrangements in place at Marland School for submitting an appeal to the awarding organisation.\n\nAppeal to the awarding organisation\n\nYou can only make an appeal if you've already requested and received the outcome of a review of marking or a review of moderation.\n\nThe awarding organisation will not be able to consider an appeal that is based solely on differences of opinion - if the student wants to improve their grade they may want to consider entering for the autumn exam series.\n\nIf the student believes there is an error, or if the awarding organisation has made an administrative error, or the student considers that the grade awarded was an unreasonable exercise of academic judgement, the student can submit a request to Marland School to proceed with a review / subsequent appeal to the awarding organisation on their behalf if required.\n\nTo proceed, the student must complete and sign the consent form for Clerical re-checks, reviews of marking and appeals.\n\nThe Head of Centre for Marland School will have to submit the appeal on the student’s behalf according to the requirements of the awarding organisation to which it is being submitted.\n\nThe awarding organisation will determine the grade at appeal and the outcome will be final.\n\nThe outcome of the appeal may result in the grade remaining the same, being lowered or raised\n\nThere is no further opportunity to appeal the outcome to the awarding organisation.\n\nThe awarding organisation’s appeal outcome letter will be provided by post to the student by Marland School as soon as reasonably practical after the outcome letter from the awarding organisation is received in the centre.\n\nIf there are concerns the awarding body has not followed its appeals process, they may be able to apply for a procedural review.\n\nThe appeal outcome letter will include the next appropriate steps, where applicable, to apply for a procedural review to the Exam Procedures Review Service (EPRS).\n\nNote - Once a finding has been made you cannot withdraw your request for an appeal. If your grade has been lowered, you will not be able to revert back to the original grade you received on results day. For more information please refer to the Department for Education’s blog.\n\nDeadline to submit a request\n\nNon-priority – reviews of marking and moderation, appeals"
