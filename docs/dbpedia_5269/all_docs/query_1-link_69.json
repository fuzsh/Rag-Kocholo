The College seeks to help each student, in the light of his individual abilities, interests, and needs, to become such a person by attaining the following specific objectives: 1. Ability and disposition to read the English language with understanding, and to speak and write it correctly and effectively. (Stressed in total program, and particulary in composition and speech.) 2. Ability and disposition to think clearly, objectively, independently, and con- structively. (Stressed in total program, and particularly in mathematics, natural and social sciences, and philosophy.) 3. Ability and disposition to order one's own life in such fashion as to realize the highest possible degree of health and efficiency of both body and mind. (Stressed in total program, and particularly in physical education and psychology.) 4. A broad orientation in the liberal arts — some understanding and appreciation of the content and value of the main fields of learning and of the major problems of human life. (Stressed particularly, but not exclusively, in required courses in general education. See General Education.) 5. Sufficient concentration in some fields, or fields, to constitute adequate preparation for graduate study or immediate entrance into some well considered vocation. Through its program of testing and guidance the College undertakes to help the student to choose wisely his vocation or profession. Through its instructional program it undertakes to help him acquire the knowledge and develop the skills essential to success in his chosen field. (Stressed particularly in courses constituting the student's major and minor, and in the guidance program.) 6. Understanding, appreciation, and experience of the Christian religion — de- velopment and practice of a Christian philosophy of life. (Stressed in total program, and particularly in courses in Bible, philosophy, and religion, in college chapel, in student organizations of a religious character, and in participation in life of local churches.) 7. Ability and disposition to be a good citizen — to participate in, and assume leadership in, socially constructive organizations and activities; and to foster exten- sion of democracy and development of a worthy cosmopolitanism. (Stressed in total program, and particularly in student participation in government, student organiza- tions, and extracurricular activities.)

S I College ^^ Bulletin CATALOGUE NUMBER 1967-68 BUCKHANNON, WEST VIRGINIA ] People often ask, \"What's in a name?\" and in the same manner we might well ask, \"What's in a college?\" The content of a name depends on how much one gives to life. Similarly, the value of college is measured by the degree to which one gives himself to the total educational experi- ence. When college is approached seriously and with full commitment only good results and the stature of the individual is enhanced. A sense of clear purpose is then essential to a profitable college experience. As the individual must have a clear purpose to achieve success in life, so also an institution such as a college must have a purpose if it is to achieve its largest dimensions. The purposes and objectives of West Virginia Wesleyan College reflect the institution's desire to help the in- dividual achieve maturity. College, then, is a joint experience in which both the individual and institution join hands in the all important search for meaning. As one applies himself in a conscientious search for information and follows the inspiration and direction of dedicated teachers he \\\\-ill be- come increasingly aware of the possibilities of chosen fields, and will develop a competence and maturity that always characterize the good student. As one participates in the total cultural life of the institution, horizons are broadened and the richness of our civilization and culture becomes apparent. As one performs the role of a good citizen in the campus community, shares in the ser\\ices of worship, studies the religious heritage of our people, and explores religious values, the Christian life becomes commanding and its radiance is reflected in all that one does. \"What's in a college,\" then, depends in large measure on how faith- fully each student takes advantage of his college opportunities and how faithfully he strives to reflect the highest ideals and objectives of the in- stitution. West Virginia Wesleyan College is dedicated to the best in life and it invites you to find the best, to master it and to live it. mz '^:^^^^Wi^sMS ■- - f.

The Christian college is a community of teachers and students seeking to know the nature of the universe created by God and the kind of society in which man can live according to God's will. If this definition appeals to you, you will find West Virginia Wesleyan to your liking — for it seeks to be a Christian College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in the sense that its total program is motivated by Christian ideals and principles, and is directed toward the development of competent, cul- tured, Christian persons. The College seeks to help you to become a competent, cultured, Chris- tian person by providing you with a faculty of capable teachers of sub- stantial Christian influence; by furnishing you with a program of indivi- dual guidance designed to help you make the best possible use of your talents, time, opportunities; and by constantly restudying the College's objectives and procedures in order to improve them. An integral part of this general Christian emphasis is the College's high academic standards. West Virginia Wesleyan College is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools; is accredited by the University Senate of The Methodist Church, and by the University of the State of New York. The College holds membership in the National Association of Schools of Music, and is approved by the West Virginia Department of Education. Wesleyan is also a member of the National Commission on Accredit- ing, the American Council on Education, the Association of American 8 West Virginia Wesleyan College Colleges, and the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Educa- tion; is approved for membership purposes by the American Association of University Women, is a member of the Regional Council for Inter- national Education, and is an Educational Associate of the Institute of International Education. Because the Christian college is seeking to understand all of God's world, it is naturally interested in bringing to the campus the finest in lectures and cultural events. For example, the 1966-67 Concert Series included performances by The First Chamber Dance Quartet, Edith Peinemann, Violinist; and Revel- ers Male Quartet. Last year Wesleyan participated in the Regional Council for Inter- national Education's Scholar in Residence Program and played host to Dr. Tetsuro Sasaki, eminent Japanese scholar. Each year special prominent guest lecturers are secured for the Divisional Lectures Series, the Schoolcraft Lecture, and many other special lectureships and seminars. The cultural enrichment program is further implemented by the students of Wesleyan as they plan, direct, and produce other cultural pro- grams. A weekly assembly, held on Thursdays at 11:00 a.m., presents a variety of programs which include lectures, concerts by individuals and groups, college organizations, and Community Council activities. Integrating these many cultural activities is an extensive religious program, including a campus-wide chapel service conducted every Tues- day morning at 10:00 and 11:00 o'clock. The religious life program of the campus is coordinated by a Re- ligious Life Council composed of faculty and students who represent the religious interests of the College community and the major denomina- tions represented in the student body. The work of the Council is carried on by committees which present religious programs on Sunday mornings, Sunday evenings, Thursday evenings, and the annual Christian Emphasis Week, as well as other special occasions. The central religious concern of the campus is further illustrated by the presence of a large number of preministerial students serving approxi- mately one hundred rural churches in the vicinity of the College. Of the 1,598 full-time students, enrolled during the first semester of 1966-67, ninety-seven were preparing for the work of the Christian ministry, and sixty-five others were preparing for careers in Christian Education and related vocations. Implicit in the mature religious outlook is always the concern for the whole person. It is in view of this outlook that West Virginia Wesleyan College provides you with a wide range of co-curricular activities. You will find quality programs in athletic and intermural sports, indicating the College's serious concern for your physical well-being. An unusually fine choir, band, and other musical organizations permit you to express your musical talents in creative ways. Social fraternities and sororities, considered an integral part of the College community, allow you to participate in a specialized fellowship, if you so desire. If you have inclinations toward acting or speaking, you will find drama, speech, and debate groups looking for your enthusiasm. Individual sports such as hiking, spelunking, and skiing give ample opportunity for leisure time activities. These many co-curricular programs are maintained in the belief that the Christian college of liberal arts should provide for self-realization in all realms, spiritual, intellectual, and physical. 10 West Virginia Wesleyan College WHERE AND WHAT IS WESLEYAN? Over seventy-five years ago a small group of dedicated West Virginia Methodists, bold enough to \"see visions and dream dreams\" of a great college at the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains, founded what was then known as the West Virginia Conference Seminary. From the very beginning the salient task of the College's administrators, faculty members, students, and friends has been to turn this pioneer vision into reality. Now WVWC stands erect in the world of higher education and in- vites you, the incoming student, to join this growing Wesleyan tradition. Though the general aims and commitments of the present College are essentially the same as they were at its founding in 1890, the campus has been greatly extended and the physical facilities have multiplied at an almost phenomenal rate. Located in Buckhannon, a city of more than 8,000 inhabitants near the geographical center of West Virginia, the 75-acre campus of native oaks and other beautiful trees and shrubs con- tains over a dozen buildings of modified Georgian design. The Lynch-Raine Administration Building houses the administra- tive offices, certain academic departments, and Atkinson Chapel. The Raymond Science Hall contains the Departments of Biology; Chemistry; Astronomy, Geography, and Geolog)'; Mathematics; Physics, and houses also the Museum of Natural Science. The L. L. Loar and Family Memorial Building provides studios, classrooms, and practice rooms for the Departments of Music and Fine and Applied Arts. The Annie Merner Pfeiffer Library houses a collection of more than 70,000 volumes. The Administration Annex contains faculty offices, the Center for the Study of Latin America, and other facilities. The Gymnasium houses the De- partment of Physical Education, and Ross Field, adjacent to it, provides football and track facilities. The Benedum Campus Community Center has new facilities for swimming, bowling and other activities, as well as a coffee shop, post office and bookstore. The chapel and religious center contains a sanctuary which can seat the entire college community, provides offices and classrooms for the De- partment of Bible and Religion and the Department of Philosophy, and contains various physical facilities for appropriate activities. Fleming Hall provides room for 150 men, McCuskey Hall houses 160 men and Doney Hall provides room for 150 men. Agnes Howard Hall provides room for 130 women, its basement area serving as the Student Personnel Center. Jenkins Hall provides room for 150 women, and Holloway Hall houses 200 women. Besides these on-campus facilities, WVWC provides three large houses for women students, a laboratory kindergarten, a computing center, the Edna Jenkins Home Economics Cottage, the Alumni House, and the Appalachian Art Center. These physical facilities, homogenized with the friendly spirit of Wes- leyan and a wide curriculum of offerings in the liberal arts and sciences, make the College an ideal place for study and for living the life good to live.

The center co-ordinates and is concerned with various services, primarily related to the students and their activity out- side the classroom. The services included are: the cultural and religious development of students; housing of students; counseling and testing; the health, physical fitness, and medical program; campus government; campus organizations, their program and activities; student aid and placement. The personnel staff recommends that all students become familiar with The Orange N' Black Student Handbook, the guide to campus life, and the College Bulletin which is the student's official source of information about West Virginia Wesleyan College. ORIENTATION An orientation course designed to supplement the Orientation Program in helping freshmen to make successful adjustments to college life is re- quired of all students. Topics considered include the objectives of college, the purpose of a liberal arts education, use of library, healthful living, cam- pus activities, social usage, effective study techniques, and educational and vocational planning. 16 West Virginia Wesleyan College HEALTH SERVICE The College maintains a health ser\\'ice for its students, as outlined be- low. ( 1 ) As one of the requirements for admission to the College each ap- plicant must present, prior to registration, a health certificate executed by a practicing physician. Forms provided by the College must be used for this purpose. (2) An annual physical examination, performed by a practicing physician and reported on the official college health form pro\\'ided with the regular fall registration materials, must be in the Health Center Office prior to fall registration. A student will not be permitted to complete registration if this requirement is omitted. (3) The College Health Center, located at 68 College Avenue, is staffed 24 hours daily with a Head Nurse on duty 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., a part-time nurse on duty afternoons and early evenings, and a resident night nurse. Two local physicians have daily office hours at the Health Center and are available as needed. The College provides the doctors' services for minor and occasional illnesses and emergencies. The Health Center has limited infirmar)- facilities for students needing isolation but not hospital- ization. Hospitalization is available at the Leonard Memorial and St. Joseph's Hospitals located in Buckhannon, which afford good facilities and services. (4) Chest x-rays are provided annually for all students, all staff mem- bers, and all employees, through the cooperation of the West Virginia De- partment of Health, and are required of all pei-sons listed. (5) All students receiving medical care must assume the responsibility of rrieeting the financial pa\\Tnent directly to the physician or hospital from personal funds or through their hospitalization program. The College does not assume responsibility for prolonged or specialized medical care or for hospitalization. (See Medical Reimbursement Insurance.) MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT INSURANCE SERVICE Medical Reimbursement Insurance, covering accidents and illness, is available as provided by Continental Casuality. The insurance covers medi- cal expenses to $1,000.00 for each accident or $1,000.00 for each illness, plus a death benefit of $1,000.00. Insurance is available for either nine months or twelve months. The cost of the insurance is appro.ximately $16.00 for nine months and $25.00 for twelve months. Participation in the insur- ance program is optional. Campus Life and Activity 17 HOUSING AND FOOD SERVICE All college men and women not living at home are required to live in college operated residence halls. All housing accommodations must be cleared through the Student Personnel Center. In order to obtain a room reservation it is necessary for a student in residence, a former student approved for readmission, and all new students admitted to Wesleyan to file an application for housing and pay the required deposit. Applications are available by writing to the Student Personnel Center. All students living in College residence halls are required to make a security deposit of $50.00 for a semester or $25.00 for a summer term. This deposit will be held as a security deposit until the temiination of residence, when it \\vill be refunded upon request before June 1 of each year, less deductions for any damages, beyond normal wear, incurred against College property. This deposit may serve as the required deposit for renewal of room reservations from year to year, but cannot be credited toward room or board charges. A charge will be made to cover any damage done to College property beyond the wear incident to normal and proper use. Security Deposit Refund — see Expenses. Rooms in residence halls are furnished except for linens, blankets, rugs, curtains, and study lamps. Contracts with room assignments will be mailed to all applicants who pay the security deposit. All housing contracts are binding for the aca- demic year issued. Under very extraordinary circumstances, the Housing Committee may authorize an exception to this rule. All changes in residence must be reported to and approved by the Housing Committee through the Dean of Students Office. Rooms and apartments are available in approved homes off campus for married students. Approved listing of such facilities are available in the Student Personnel Center. Coeducational dining is provided in McCuskey Hall and Jenkins Hall. All students residing in College residence halls must board on campus and will be assigned to an appropriate dining room. Boarding on campus is optional to those few students approved for off-campus housing. Room and Board charges — see Expense. 18 West Virginia Wesleyan College To insure the best welfare and cooperation of all members of the College community, students are requested to know and are responsible for abiding by the general policies and regulations governing residence halls, fraternity and other off-campus houses for students. COUNSELING SERVICE West Virginia Wesleyan College attempts to provide students counsel- ing services commensurate with their needs — whether educational, voca- tional, social, moral or religious. All members of the faculty assist with guidance services, under the leadership and direction of a Counseling Committee, constituted of persons with extensive backgrounds of, preparation for, and experience in, counseling. Faculty advisors and professional counselors seek to understand the individual student — and to help him to understand himself — with respect to academic aptitudes, educational achievement, personal and social adjust- ment, vocational aptitudes and interests, and moral and religious standards and concern. Such information is then utilized by counselors in advising the student, in assisting him with his various problems, and in helping him to grow toward well integrated adulthood — characterized by competent self-direc- tion, constant self-discipline, and complete self-dedication to some worthy enterprise, some noble cause, some high ideal. When specialized professional services — sometimes unobtainable at the college — become necessary for an individual student, the counseling staff will make an appropriate recommendation to the parent or guardian. The student's family must assume complete responsibility for securing the needed professional treatment. Normally, such referrals are conducted through the family physician. TESTING SERVICE The College maintains a well-planned testing program in order to provide counselors, instructors, and the student with reliable information about his individual ability, aptitudes, achievement, progress, vocational interests and significant personality traits. Entering freshmen and transfer students are required to take the American College Test (ACT) and the Opinion, Attitude and Interest Campus Life and Activity 19 SuA-ey (OAIS) . The College expects all new students to submit scores from the ACT and OAIS prior to registration for classes. The College provides to seniors approaching graduation the Graduate Record Examination (ORE), consisting of (a) The Area Tests, designed to assess the broad outcomes of education in the liberal arts, (b) Advanced Tests taken by each student in his major field only. The Aptitude Test, which measures verbal and quantitative abilities may also be taken if the student desires. The Graduate Record Examination is required of appli- cants for admission to a large number of graduate schools and is used to evaluate both the student and the college. Near the end of the senior year each student must, as a requirement for graduation, pass a comprehensive examination and submit GRE Area and Advanced Test scores to the College. National Teacher Examination (NTE) scores must be submitted by senior students in the teacher educa- tion program. This testing program supplements the tests given by instructors in specific courses. It also provides factual data which the College uses for continuous evaluation and improvement of its curriculum. West Virginia Wesleyan College is an approved testing center for the administration of the Amtrican College Test (ACT) , Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), National Teacher Examinations (NTE), Miller Analogies Test, Law School Admission Test, Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business, General Education Development (GED) Test. The Director of Evaluation Services should be contacted for information about these tests. PL. \\ CEMENT SERVICE The College Placement Service is maintained to provide seniors and graduates with vocational information and emplo)Tnent opportunities. Dur- ing the year conferences with representatives from business, industry, and education are arranged for seniors who are registered with the Placement Service.

ATHLETICS Athletics, both intercollegiate and intramural, constitute a part of the total educational program at West Virginia Wesleyan College — providing healthful exercise and recreation, and developing knowledge, interests, and skills that may have lasting value. As a part of the educational program, athletics at West Virginia Wes- leyan College, both intercollegiate and intramural, are controlled and su- per\\ised by the President and the faculty, and are operated in the interest of the students who participate. As a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Second- ar\\- Schools. West Virginia Wesleyan College observes the 1952 Revised Athletic Policy of the Commission on Colleges and Universities. (Copies available upon request.)

(See Warned List, Academic Probation, Disciplinan' Probation.) 22 West Virginia Wesleyan College Within the framework of the policy outlined above, West Virginia Wesleyan College participates in intercollegiate basketball, baseball, foot- ball, golf, tennis, track, cross country, soccer and swimming. A varied intramural program of athletics, sponsored by the Community Council, and organized and supervised by the members of the faculty of the Department of Physical Education, is available to all students who will participate. (See Community Council.) esv f w t^ tt Admission and Expenses ADMISSION AND CREDITS ADMISSION BY HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT Applications for admission to West Virginia Wesleyan College should be accompanied by scores from the American College Test (ACT). Scores from the College Entrance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude Test may be submitted for admission consideration. New students who do not take the ACT prior to registration at Wesleyan will be required to do so during Orientation Week. It must be stressed that either the ACT or CEEB may be submitted with an application to Wesleyan. We require scores from the ACT, so it is to the student's advantage to submit ACT scores as soon as possible. 1. A satisfactory application for admission on form furnished by the College. 2. A satisfactory transcript of high school record showing courses pur- sued, grades earned, credits amounting to at least 16 units (earned in grades 9 to 12), and a clear statement of applicant's standing in his graduating class (e.g., Third, in order of highest to lowest, in a graduating class of 141). 3.

In such cases, the applicant, if approved, is admitted ten- tatively. If he maintains a satisfactory record for the period for which he is tentatively admitted, he is then granted regular standing; otherwise, his enrollment is terminated. The College, open without discrimination to all qualified students, reserves the right to refuse to admit any applicant, who because of low scholarship, or for any other reason, is in the judgment of the Committee on Admission deemed unlikely to conform to the standards and ideals the College seeks to maintain. Applicants for admission to West Virginia Wesleyan College are re- quired to take either the College Entrance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude Test (CEEB) or the American College Test (ACT). Freshmen who do not take the ACT prior to entrance will be required to do so during Orientation Week at a cost of $5. Students who have taken the OAIS test prior to registration may submit this test score report, thus eliminating the necessity for taking this particular test during Orientation Week. If the OAIS is taken during Orientation Week the student will be charged $2. Forms for use by applicants for admission may be obtained by addressing the Director of Admissions. ADMISSION TO ADVANCED STANDING BY TRANSFER Persons transferring from other accredited institutions of collegiate rank may be admitted to advanced standing in West Virginia Wesleyan College upon presentation of the following items to the Committee on Admission : 1.

Credit for courses taken in non-accredited institutions will be deter- mined by the Committee on Admission and Academic Standing. This Committee may require the person desiring credit for such courses to take a series of examinations to demonstrate satisfactory mastery of courses for which credit is sought. West Virginia Wesleyan College will not accept more than sixty-four semester hours of credit from a junior college. West Virginia Wesleyan College will not accept by transfer credits earned per semester in excess of the number of credits students in residence are permitted to earn. (See Student Load.) ADVANCED PLACEMENT BY TESTING .A.11 transfer students are required to submit scores on the ACT and OAIS. If these scores are not submitted with the application for admission, the student is required to take the tests during the September Orientation Week wth the new freshmen and pay the usual fees himself.

WORKSHI PS West Virginia Wesleyan College awards on an annual basis a limited number of workships to students well qualified to serve as assistants in laboratories, library and offices; as counselors and assistants in residence halls for men; as assistant hostesses in residence halls for women; as tele- phone operators; as waiters in dining halls; etc. Workships vary in amount with the character of the work assigned, and with the amount of time required. Students awarded workships are required to carry a study load of at least twelve credit hours each semester, to maintain an overall scholastic average of C or above, and to perform satisfactorily (promptly, efficiently, and courteously) tasks assigned. Workships are administered by the Committee on Student Aid. COLLEGE WORK STUDY Students, particularly those from low income families and who need a job to help pay for college expenses, are potentially eligible for employ- ment by their colleges under federally supported Work-Study Programs. Students may work up to 15 hours weekly while attending classes full time. During the summer or other vacation periods when they do not have Scholarships and Student Aid 47 classes, students may work full time (40 hours per week) under this pro- gram. In general the basic pay rate is $1.25 an hour. In three months of summer einplopiient under the Work-Study Program, an eligible student could earn approximately $600, if needed. This amount, supplemented by his weekly earnings during the school year, could help provide total edu- cational costs including necessary clothes, transportation, and personal ex- penses. To work under this program, a student must be enrolled and be in good standing, or be accepted for enrollment as a full time student. The student's eligibility depends upon his need for employment to defray col- lege expenses, with preference given to applicants from low income families. COUNSELORSHIPS A number of mature, well qualified students may be awarded residence hall counselorships each year. These counselorships, in the amount of $400 each, are awarded on the basis of maturity, character, scholarship, and general commitment. Counselorships are reser\\ed primarily for students with Junior or Senior standing. FIELD WORK IN CHURCHES A few well qualified students may earn credit toward their instruc- tional charges by performing satisfactorily during the summer vacation such field work in the churches of the West Virginia Annual Conference as may be approved by the Religious Education faculty and the Executive Secretary of the Conference Board of Education. Remuneration for such work is $40.00 per week, for a period not to exceed twelve weeks in any one year. The amount earned is divided equally between the first and sec- ond semesters. GRANTS EMERGENCY GRANTS IN AID West Virginia Wesleyan College awards annually a limited number of grants in aid, ranging from $50.00 to $300.00 each.

EDUCATION. \\L OPPORTUNITY GRANTS Educational Opportunity Grants are available to a limited number of undergraduate students with exceptional financial need who require these grants to attend college. To be eligible, the student must also show aca- demic or creative promise. Eligible students who are accepted for enrollment on a full time basis or who are currently enrolled in good standing, may receive Educational Opportunity Grants for each year of their higher education, although the maximum duration of a grant is four years. Grants will range from $200 to $800 a year, and can be no more than one-half of the total assistance given the student. The amount of financial assistance a student may receive depends upon his need-taking into account his financial resources, those of his parents and the cost of attending college. LOANS A number of loan funds, including the Methodist Student Loan Fund, are available to students in West Virginia Wesleyan College. Loans are made to students of good character who maintain satisfactor)' scholarship, provide required recommendations, establish financial responsibility, and sign promissory notes obligating themselves to repa)'ment of principal with interest within a specified time.

The loans bear interest at the rate of three per cent per year and repajTnent of principal may be extended over a ten-year period. If a borrower becomes a full-time teacher in an elementan' or sec- ondary school or in an institution of higher education, as much as half of the loan may be for^ven at the rate of ten per cent for each year of teaching ser\\ice. Repa\\-ment may be deferred up to a total of three years while a borrower is serving in the Armed Forces, with the Peace Corps, or as a Volunteer in Service to .America (VIST.A*.

All other students will register on Monday and Tuesday, September 4-5. All students entering at the begin- ning of the second semester, or at the opening of any summer term, will register on the day designated in the college calendar. LATE REGISTRATION Except in cases of unavoidable delay, late registration is strongly dis- couraged. Students who enroll late will be required to reduce the number of hours for which they register, unless excused by the Committee on Ad- mission and Academic Standing. A charge of $5.00 is made for late reg- istration. CHANGES IN REGISTRATION Changes in registration can be made only with the approval of the Dean of the College, who in problematical cases will require the written consent of the student's advisor, and favorable action by the Committee on Academic Standing. In order to minimize charges, the student should consult his advisor, and, if necessary, the Dean of the College, before reg- istering. No changes in registration, involving addition of new courses, may be made after the fifth day of classes in any semester, or after the first 54 West Virginia Wesleyan College two days of classes in any summer term (of five weeks). (See Withdrawal from Courses.) A charge of $5.00 is made for each change in registration, except when required by the College. PREREGISTRATION Students in residence during any semester or summer term preregister for the ensuing semester and/or summer term on dates designated in Col- lege calendar. Since it is highly important that preregistration be complete, in order that provision may be made for enough textbooks, laboratory materials, and sections of classes, students are required, in their own in- terest, to preregister. A charge of $5.00 is made for failure to preregister on dates designated. STUDENT LOAD The normal student load is sixteen credit hours per semester, or six hours per summer term (of five weeks). Students who are working part time, or who are failing to maintain a satisfactory scholastic record, are advised to carry loads lighter than the average. The Committee on Aca- demic Standing may require the poor student to lighten his load. No stu- dent may register for more than sixteen credit hours in any one semester, or more than six in any one summer term (of five weeks), without the con- sent of this Committee. WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES A student will be pemiitted to withdraw from a course only during the period specified in the College calendar, and only when the circum- stances fully justify this procedure. In order to withdraw from a course, a student must obtain the written permission of the Instructor involved, the Chairman of the Department, the student's faculty advisor, and the Dean of the College. If the student is doing passing work when he is granted permission to withdraw, WP (withdrew passing) is entered on his record. Otherwise, WF (withdrew failing) is entered. If a student discontinues a course without permission of the Dean of the College, F (failure) is entered on his record. COURSES REPEATED A course in which the final grade is either a D or an F may be re- peated with the permission of the Committee on Academic Standing. When- Rules and Regulations 55 ever a course is repeated, both the first grade received and the grade in the repeated course, with their related hours and quality points, shall remain a part of the permanent record. The total number of hours and points required for graduation will be increased accordingly. CL.\\SSIFICATION \\Vhen a student has met all entrance requirements, and has completed his registration, he becomes a freshman; when he has earned 32 semester hours of credit and 64 quality points, he becomes a sophomore; when he has earned 64 semester hours of credit and 128 quality points, he becomes a junior; and when he has earned 96 semester hours of credit and 192 quality points, he becomes a senior. GRADES AND QUALITY POINTS Grades Explanation Quality Points A Excellent 4 B Good 3 C Average 2 D Poor 1 F Failure 0 I Incomplete 0 WP Withdrew Passing 0 WF Withdrew Failing 0 FIW Irregular Withdrawal 0 Further explanation of I: if a student who has been making a passing grade cannot complete his work in a course on account of illness or other sufficient reason, an I (incomplete) is entered temporarily on his record. A course recorded as incomplete must be completed within the first six weeks of the next semester, except when an extension of time is granted by the Committee on Academic Standing. Otherwise, the I automatically becomes F. For purposes of this section, a summer session (of ten weeks) will be treated as a semester. SCHOL.ARSHIP QUOTIENT The term \"scholarship quotient\" is used to indicate the ratio of the total of quality points earned by a student to the total of semester hours for which he has registered, excepting ( 1 ) courses from which he has with- drawn passing, and (2) courses in process. 56 West Virginia Wesleyan College AUDITORS A person desiring to audit a course must obtain permission from the Dean of the College, register as an auditor, and pay the auditor's instruc- tional charge for the course.

(See Credit by Ex- amination. ) THE DEAN'S LIST Superior scholarship is encouraged and recognized by the publication at the end of each semester of the Dean's List, which is constituted of stu- dents who have achieved a scholarship quotient of 3.35 or above, for the semester, while carrying a load of at least 12 semester hours. For purposes of qualifying for the Dean's List, a summer session (of ten weeks) will be treated as a semester. Students appearing on the Dean's List at least five times during their college work will be awarded the Wesleyan Key for Scholarship. (See Honors Banquet.) THE ACADEMIC WARNED LIST A student who fails during any semester to maintain on total record a scholarship quotient of 2.00 or above, or fails to make passing grades (A, B, C, or D) in at least three-fourths of the hours for which he was registered, will be placed on the Warned List for the next semester in which he is in attendance, and notice thereof will be given to the student, his parents and all members of the faculty and administration of the College. While a student is on the Warned List, he is ineligible for any office in any campus organization; for membership on any Community Council committee; for participation in any time-consuming extracurricular ac- tivity; for earning points toward a Wesleyan Key; or for receiving any grant in aid, workship, or scholarship.

In his major field the student must earn at least twelve semester hours of credit and at least twice as many quality points as semester hours in upper level courses. Courses bearing odd numbers are usually given during the first semes- ter, and those bearing even numbers during the second semester. When- ever a course bearing an odd number is given in the second semester, or a course bearing an even number in the first semester, an \"r\" is added to the number of the course on class schedules. In general, freshmen should enroll for courses in the 100 series, soph- omores for courses in the 200 series, etc. Freshmen are ineligible for all courses in the 300 and 400 series, and for most courses in the 200 series.

The general education program of West Virginia Wesleyan Col- lege is designed to help the student to understand the world in which he lives, to share our cultural heritage, to become acquainted with, and con- cerned about, the major problems of mankind, to develop and practice a Christian philosophy of life — in brief, to become a well developed person, and an efficient and constructive member of society. Stated otherwise, the purpose of general education in West Virginia Wesleyan College is to develop competent, cultured. Christian persons, who will, in turn, and with adequate specialized education, become good business men, good engineers, good lawyers, good ministers, good parents, good physicians, good public officials, good scientists, good teachers — the parts, of which, and by which, a good society must be constituted. In order to provide all students an opportunity to acquire some sub- stantial measure of general education, West Virginia Wesleyan College 64 West J'irginia Wesleyan College requires all candidates for decrees to earn the following credits: Art Appreciation (2)*; Art in America (2)**: Modem European Art (2)** v (.^ytwo) 4 Sem.
