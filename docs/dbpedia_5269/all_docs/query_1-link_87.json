Patteson said he keenly Felt the responsibility of the transition from the construction period to the operation of tire Turnpike. Csire rally in View of the Many obstacles which had to be overcome. A i am highly pleased with the manner in which this transition was a Eom Pliscz and with the efficient operation of the Turnpike today a he stated. Patteson said he had pursued his Job in the Public relations Field to the fullest extent in connection with the proposed Turnpike legislation for extensions. Remarking that he practically has lived with the legislators during the past two weeks he Aid that he feels Hie legislators Are More interested and have a better understand ing of he need for Turnpike of tensions. A their action in setting up a committee to make a Cost Survey of the proposed extensions and report Back to the special session Hale ii w Register vol. 76 no. 198 six Chisho Beckley s oldest Iasi Iti i Fox Beckley West Vuu Ixia Fhi Day afternoon february to 1956 five cents Senate adopts House Bill school teachers win salary hike is most commendable a he stated adding that he feels confident that the legislature after receiving such report will pass the Resolution referring the matter to a vote of Hie people in tile general election tins fall. Patteson said in is convinced that the Turnpike will ultimately be financially successful a in fact i feel that it is already Well on the Road to Success and the increased traffic and revenues certainly substantiate this belief. In my opinion it is most unfair to attempt to judge he Success or failure of a s133.000.000 project on a Mere 14 months or gave a comparison of traffic figures for january. 1956 with lose of last january showing an increase of 32.1 per cent in total revenues. This increase is Hie More encouraging he stated considering the Winter weather which resulted in almost continual bad driving conditions during january of this year. Tile report shews an increase of 31 per cent in truck traffic and 37.8 per cent in revenues. Quot truck traffic is the life blood of any Turnpike a he reported Quot and the percentage of increase in this Field is most Gratifying. With this increase on the 88-mile initial to Rrapi ice it is Tea Del y a Parent that the farther the Turnpike is extended the greater will be the acceleration of traffic especially i Okey Patteson mrs. Rosalind Funk sex Becklean commended for 12 years work a former Beckley woman has received the highest commendations of her co worker for the past 12 years in a joint resignation move from the West Virginia Turnpike which will put both into the Campaign to make j. Howard Meyers governor erf West Virginia. Okey l. Patteson told the Register that a if mrs. Rosalind Funk does As Good a Job for Howard Myers As she did for former gov. Clarence w. Meadows and me in our gubernatorial campaigns his Victory is As Good As an interesting sidelight to this is the picture which hangs in mrs. Funk a office. The photograph of Patteson bearing his autograph dated feb. 18. 1949, is inscribed a to my Loyal and indispensable assistant. Rosalind Funk who was the number one contributor to the Success of my mrs. Funk a name came up frequently in Patteson a report which he was to hand to the members of the West Virginia Turnpike commission at a meeting Early this afternoon at the Turnpike Headquarters at Reed. It includes in part a shortly after i came with the commission. Mrs. Rosalind Funk was employed As my assistant. Her duties of course were those which generally befall an assistant general manager. In addition to which she was assigned the work of publicity and advertising including writing of articles and contacting newspapers and magazines to gain favourable publicity for the Turnpike. Quot mrs. Funk served As general chairman of both dedications and had the responsibility of arrangements including the preparation of the two souvenir programs copies of both of which were purchased by brokers and used for advertising and Selling Turnpike Bonds. Quot widespread National publicity resulting from the dedications of the Southern and Northern sections of the Turnpike was invaluable. We Are highly pleased that some of the brokers who made an on the ground investigation of the status of our Turnpike stated that the West Virginia Turnpike had received More nationwide free favourable publicity than any other toll Road in the country. A having stated his decision to enter into the Campaign he wrote a i. Of course could not remain with the commission and actively engage in politics without putting a political tinge on the Turnpike. There in View of the fact that both mrs. Funk and i have decided to participate in the Campaign. We feel it necessary to leave the commission although we reluctantly do so. A therefore on behalf of both of us i hereby tender my resignation As general manager of the West Virginia Turnpike and the resignation of mrs. Rosland c. Funk As assistant general manager. Quot we would appreciate being relieved of our duties not later than feb. 15, if Patteson added that if the Turnpike were in process of construction or preparing to Coneen consider leaving the commission because their senders would be needed due to the extremely heavy volume of work. he since no construction can be considered until after the next session of legislature we Felt that although there is much we can do yet our services Are not an absolute he concluded that both he and mrs. Funk had sincerely enjoyed working for the commission and highly value the Friendship of the group and pledged his support to do everything in his Power to add in the passing of the Turnpike Extension referendum in the fall. Pat Tesori said his Dep rooted interest in the Turnpike and his desire to see it a Success was proved last july when both mrs. Funk and Patteson took Steps which resulted in reducing their own salaries. Patteson a $20,000 a year salary was Cut at his own request to $15,000, while mrs.
