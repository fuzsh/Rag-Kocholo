During this period, the Democratic Party controlled southern state legislatures and most local, state and federal officeholders in the South were Democrats. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, Southern Democrats disenfranchised nearly all blacks in all the former Confederate states. This resulted in a one-party system, in which a candidate's victory in Democratic primary elections was tantamount to election to the office itself.

During the late 19th century and early 20th century, Southern Democrats disenfranchised nearly all blacks in all the former Confederate states. This resulted in a one-party system, in which a candidate's victory in Democratic primary elections was tantamount to election to the office itself. White primaries were another means that the Democrats used to consolidate their political power, excluding blacks from voting.[3]\n\nQuick Facts Founded, Dissolved ...\n\nClose\n\nThe \"Solid South\" included all 11 former Confederate states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. It also included Oklahoma, which became a state in 1907.[4] States considered part of the South by the Census Bureau but not part of the Solid South were Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia, because these states remained electorally competitive during the Jim Crow era.[5]"
