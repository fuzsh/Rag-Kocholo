        "text": "The Best Movies of 2018\n\nHere's a carefully curated, unranked list of the best movies in 2018, bringing memorable narratives and compelling characters to life.\n\nThe Favourite\n\n'The Favourite' offers a delectably wicked experience, featuring a battle of wits among ambitious opportunists in 18th-century England. Aided by outstanding performances from Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, and Olivia Colman, director Yorgos Lanthimos presents a witty costume drama that reinterprets genre clichés and offers a bold portrayal of queer narratives.\n\nRoma\n\n'Alfonso Cuarón's 'Roma' is a visually stunning, deeply moving tribute to the women who raised him. Shot in breathtaking black and white, the film chronicles a year in the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City in the 1970s. The film's vivid details and exceptional storytelling truly demonstrate Cuarón's mastery of cinema. This film is not only the best film of 2018 but also one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of the decade.\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nBrimming with anticipation, Bradley Cooper's adaptation of this classic tale could have been a disaster. However, 'A Star Is Born shines as an elegant romantic drama that showcases the captivating chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga. Their natural performances and the film's authentic sincerity make it an incredibly appealing, tear-jerking tale of creative expression.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again\n\nOffering solace during a bleak year, 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' invites audiences to escape reality for a blissful interlude in Greece. The sequel to the 2008 blockbuster weaves a clever tapestry of joy and sorrow around the absence of Meryl Streep. The radiance of Lily James as a younger version of Donna harmonizes beautifully with the film's overall allure, making it a delightful spectacle of life's joys and foibles. And who could resist the power of ABBA's timeless tunes?\n\nLeave No Trace\n\n'Leave No Trace' is a moving, understated examination of the bond between a father and daughter living off the grid. The film delicately explores themes of isolation, survival, and the definition of home. With powerful performances from Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie, this film resonates deeply, portraying the delicate balance between personal freedom and societal norms.\n\nMission: Impossible — Fallout\n\n'Mission: Impossible — Fallout' stars Tom Cruise at his fearless best. The sixth installment of this adrenaline-packed franchise offers thrilling sequences that push the boundaries of action cinema. From breathtaking chase scenes in Paris to dramatic airborne sequences over Kashmir, the movie perfectly exemplifies controlled chaos and marks a high point in the action genre.\n\nFree Solo\n\nElizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's 'Free Solo' documents Alex Honnold's audacious ascent of Yosemite's El Capitan without safety ropes. It presents not only a heart-stopping sporting feat but also a riveting exploration of Honnold's unique psychological makeup. The film blurs the line between physical endurance and mental tenacity, making for a captivating watch.\n\nCan You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nMarielle Heller's 'Can You Ever Forgive Me?' offers a potent mix of comedy and drama. The film paints a deeply relatable portrait of loneliness and artistic frustration, aided by a standout performance from Melissa McCarthy. This incisive narrative manages to explore serious themes while retaining a playful undercurrent of warmth and wit.\n\nHappy as Lazzaro\n\nThe tale of a humble young man transitioning from pastoral innocence to urban hardships, 'Happy as Lazzaro,' offers a hauntingly poetic commentary on Italy's socio-economic landscape. Director Alice Rohrwacher balances the bitter realities of exploitation with moments of lyrical beauty, thereby crafting a compelling modern-day parable.\n\nShoplifters\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda's 'Shoplifters' is an emotionally charged family drama that expertly handles themes of unconventional family bonds and socio-economic hardships. This Cannes Film Festival winner masterfully balances moments of warm humor with poignant reflections on life's cruel realities.\n\n2018 Movies & Industry Highlights\n\nThe year 2018 was a remarkable year for the film industry, teeming with memorable movies, groundbreaking records, and noteworthy events. These events spanned a wide range, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, critics' favorite films, festivals, a catalog of films released, and the losses of some of the industry's cherished figures.\n\nCritical Evaluation of the Year\n\nRichard Brody, a renowned critic from The New Yorker, voiced his thoughts on the cinematic landscape of 2018. He praised the year as a splendid one for films, although he noted a growing disparity between exceptional cinema and what was primarily available at local multiplexes. The digital realm filled some gaps, with streaming platforms like Netflix releasing some of the best films of the year, such as Shirkers and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Yet, despite this breakthrough, the threat of evanescence loomed over independent films released on streaming platforms.\n\n2018's Box Office Titans\n\n2018 bore witness to several box office juggernauts, dominating the worldwide gross revenue. The highest-grossing film was Avengers: Infinity War by Disney, raking in over $2 billion worldwide and becoming the fourth film to ever surpass this milestone. Other billion-grosses included Black Panther, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Incredibles 2, and Aquaman. In particular, Incredibles 2 secured a special spot as the 2nd highest-grossing animated film of all time.\n\nBox Office Records Set in 2018\n\n2018 was not just about individual films but also about the collective success of franchises and the film industry across different regions. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) etched its name in history by becoming the first film franchise to gross over $14 billion, $15 billion, and $16 billion, thanks in large part to the release of Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nStudio Records of 2018\n\nWalt Disney Studios reached $1 billion at the domestic box office in a record time of just 117 days in 2018. With Incredibles 2, Pixar became the first animation studio to have three animated films surpass $1 billion at the worldwide box office.\n\nRemarkable Film Records\n\nSeveral films set impressive records in 2018. Black Panther broke the record for a February opening weekend and a Presidents' Day weekend while also becoming the highest-grossing film directed by a black filmmaker. Avengers: Infinity War set the record for the highest-grossing opening weekend, both domestically and globally.\n\nThe biographical film Bohemian Rhapsody based on Freddie Mercury's life, grossed over $911 million worldwide, setting the record for the highest-grossing biopic. Additionally, the Indian musical drama film Secret Superstar set records for Indian films in China, establishing a fresh milestone for Bollywood in the international market."
