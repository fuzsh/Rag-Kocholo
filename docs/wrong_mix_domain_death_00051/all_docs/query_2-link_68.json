        "text": "Post by darkstar3 on\n\nKing Magazine (Italy) 1991\n\nJIM AND I FRIENDS UNTIL DEATH\n\nby: Alain Ronay\n\nTranslated From Italian To English By: Joel Brody\n\nAnything and everything has been written about the tragic end of the\n\nDoors' leader. But what really happened on July 3rd twenty years ago,\n\nno one has ever told. This is because Alain Ronay, Jim's photographer\n\nfriend who was the first to find the rock star in his apartment where\n\nhe lay in the bathtub without breathing, had always kept quiet. Now,\n\nto defend Morrison's memory, Ronay speaks out. He tells King all the\n\ndetails of that day, from the strange behavior of Pamela, Jim's\n\ngirlfriend, to the doctors' incompetence, to the superficiality of\n\nthe police in trying to hide the news of his death. He also remembers\n\nthe happy days spent with Jim in Paris, the anguish of the singer\n\npoet, his desire to detoxify from alcohol and keep himself away from\n\nheroin.\n\nA Frenchman and naturalized American, Alain met Jim in California in\n\n1964. Since then they became close friends.\n\nFriday, July 2, 1971: Jim and I were taking a walk in the Marais\n\nQuarter in Paris. The historic district served only as a backdrop for\n\nour discussions which ranged from the Yoga teacher's visit (Jim had\n\nasked me to be an interpreter for them - the topic of their\n\ndiscussion: man as a tightrope walker heading towards death) to\n\nanalyzing Nietzche's opinions on suicide. Jim was obsessed by death.\n\nEveryone knew this, but rarely did he bring up this topic with me.\n\nThat morning his words went back to that subject many times. I\n\nsucceeded in tearing him away from his deark thoughts with Oscar\n\nWilde.\n\nAlthough neither of us had been particularly interested in him, Oscar\n\nseemed to lift our spirits considerably. A month earlier, when Jim\n\nand Pamela (Pamela Courson, Morrison's companion, editor's note) came\n\nto visit me in London, I reserved a room for them at the Cadogan\n\nHotel near Sloane Square. I told them this was the place where Wilde\n\nwas arrested.\n\nWhile we were walking a connection clicked in my mind: in Paris Jim\n\nand Pam stayed in what they snobbishly called the Hotel.\n\n\"But, do you realize that Oscar Wilde lived here too? I said\n\nthoughtlessly. There's even a plaque here near the door. I'm sure of\n\nit. Didn't you see it?\"\n\nJim didn't answer, so I added, \"Watch out you don't follow too\n\nclosely in his footsteps - you could end up like him.\"\n\nMy words remained hanging in the air. Jim continued not to answer.\n\nWhat could he say? My ideas were completely out of place and I felt\n\nstupid.\n\nFortunately, a half empty store that faced a very narrow street\n\nallowed us to change the subject. A hand-painted sign informed us\n\nthat we were at the Voix d'Orphee, but what this was really all about\n\nwas not very clear to us. Even if Orpheus' Voice didn't mean much to\n\nme, it seemed however to interest Jim who insisted that I ask in\n\nFrench what went on in there. His mood soared when I told him it was\n\na recording studio.\n\n\"Hey - It's almost a good omen, isn't it? I can finish my poetry\n\nrecord righthere - that's exactly what I'm going to do. I've no\n\nintention of leaving Paris. I'm happy here. I should get back to the\n\ntapes of my poetry that I left at Village Recorders -I bet the\n\nbootleggers have already pounced on them, and maybe they're not fit\n\nfor release-\"\n\nThe stately houses and historic monuments disappeared when we got to\n\nRue des Rosieres, a very colorful street full of little stores run by\n\nthe most varied ethnic groups. While Jim was buying a pendant for\n\nPam, I noticed for the first time that he tried to appear happy while\n\nI had the district sensation that he wasn't happy at all. There was\n\nan indefinable anxiety in his gestures. I knew him too well.\n\nThere was something abnormal and wrong with his behavior. Something\n\nincredible because Jim Morrison never begged anybody. He said\n\nnothing. He tried to take his time, to find excuses for me to stay\n\nwith him. He was desperate. This, I saw clearly. But why? I didn't\n\nask. He would never have explained it.\n\nIn the past Jim was always successful in keeping his states of\n\nanxiety under control, even though I was usually able to pick up on\n\nthem. However, towards noon there was no longer any need to guess. He\n\nwas not making any effort to camouflage his strong agitation: he was\n\nshaken by a series of very powerful hiccups.\n\nWe ate in a restaurant specializing in Alsatian food. The fin de\n\nsiecle decorations exploded in arabesques and art nouveau\n\nconvolutions. Later in the afternoon we discovered a purveyor of\n\ncinematographic rarities, among which were some of Fritz Lang's\n\nfilms. We stopped in front of the shoemaker's where Jim had brought\n\nhis new boots to be made wider. They weren't ready yet. Every once in\n\nawhile the hiccups returned to violently shake Jim's body. Apart from\n\nthis his agitation grew worse. His nerves were visibly shaking and\n\nthe reason for this was still unknown to me.\n\nThe state of his emotional upheaval reached its peak at his apartment\n\nat about 5:30 PM when I had to leave to meet Agnes Varda.\n\n\"Don't go away\" - he implored me. There was something\n\nabnormal and wrong in all this. Jim never implored, it wasn't in his makeup. Then\n\nhe tried to take his time and his tactics were obvious but foreign to\n\nhis personality. As far as cheering you up and lifting your spirits\n\nhe is the cleverest person I have ever known.\n\nHe was desperate. But why? I never asked him because I knew he would\n\nnever tell me. First of all he wanted me to read the opening article\n\nof Newsweek at all costs. He seemed very serious in asking me to do\n\nthis but I was already on my way out and I didn't even look at the\n\nmagazine cover. It took about half an hour before I managed to walk\n\ndown the stairs and leave. Jim still tried to keep me with the\n\npretext of a telegram he was supposed to send from the post office a\n\nfew blocks away. He wanted me to help him with the French.\n\nFortunately, a post office strike helped me in trying to get away,\n\nbut Jim asked me if he could at least come outside with me. Opposite\n\na cafe- in Place de la Bastille, Jim made his last appeal, -\n\n\"Come on Alain, stay- Stay at least for a short beer with me, what do you say?\n\nDon't leave-stay with me. Do it for an old friend.\" - Hiccups\n\ncontinually interrupted his pleading.\n\nThe show of this sudden and unexplainable change confused and upset\n\nme, above all when compared to Jim's behavior during the month just\n\npast which he spent with Pam. In that brief period he was happy, calm\n\nand free. Paris was good for him. He had gotten rid of the damage\n\nproduced by fame and had found himself again. He wrote all the time,\n\nhe went around town and about his business without being recognized\n\nand he had almost stopped drinking. He didn't take drugs yet.\n\nPam's habit hadn't yet gotten to him. She led her own independent\n\nlife in Paris and did not live with him. Therefore, with a few\n\nexceptions, Jim and I spent almost the whole month of June alone\n\ntogether. Our days were tranquil and were probably the best we\n\nshared. Jim's repeated invitations to join him in Paris to\n\nrelive \"the good old days\"- implied that he fully intended to bury\n\nthe rock star in him. The promise was kept.\n\nThe purpose of the Paris vacation was to detoxify Jim of alcohol and\n\nfor him to forget the anguish that his fame as a rock star had\n\ncaused. In June of l971 Jim was very creative. He spent a lot of time\n\nwriting poetry.\n\nWe went into a cafe on Place de la Bastille. We ordered and I asked\n\nthe waiter to hurry. Jim suddenly closed his eyes while new waves of\n\nhiccups went through him. He was thoroughly concentrated in his\n\nefforts to get rid of them. When I looked at him I had the clear\n\nsensation that his face had assumed the aspect of a death mask. The\n\nfeeling disappeared when Jim opened his eyes again. He scrutinized\n\nme, and as if waiting for me to lie he asked, \"What did you see?\"\n\n\"Nothing Jim, nothing.\"\n\nWhile we were ordering another round of beers, I realized that I\n\nreally had to leave and I said to him, \"Forgive me but I really have\n\nto go.\" I rushed out and stopped next to the nearby subway entrance.\n\nI turned round to see him one more time. He was in profile and\n\nsuddenly, as if he felt me looking at him, he turned and stared at\n\nme. All this lasted only a few seconds. Then I dashed down the stairs.\n\nAgnes cast an impatient glance at me over the desk at which she was\n\nseated and repeated, \"And so it seemed to you to have seen a dead\n\nman's face.\"\n\n\"Not a face,\" I corrected her, \"what I saw was a death mask.\"\n\nAgnes was busy looking, however superficially, for a letter in her\n\nfile. I needed to see her eyes which were hidden behind her black\n\nbangs. I wanted to find out if she was indifferent, skeptical or if\n\nshe was making light of the whole issue to calm me down.\n\n\"Should I go on?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" she answered impatiently, keeping her hand in the filing\n\ncabinet as if it were a bookmark and staring at me.\n\n\"What do you mean by mask?\" she asked.\n\n\"I mean the type of make-up that is applied to people after they're\n\ndeceased. Jim had one of these in his book on Francis Bacon. It was a\n\npicture of William Blake's face. He had that book when we were\n\nstudents and lived in my house years ago.\"\n\n\"Now I understand, that's curious\"\n\n\"Curious - you could say something better than that - Looking at it\n\nmade me ill.\"\n\n\"I see that this has really made an impression on you.\"\n\n\"Jim knew that you and I were supposed to have dinner together, but\n\nhe continued to insist that I join him at the movies where I sent Pam\n\nand him to see Mitchum's film.\"\n\nAgnes gave me an encouraging smile and said, \"If you want, we could\n\ndo without going to the Vietnamese restaurant - Go with them. Anyway,\n\nI'm tired and I have to go over the text of Tango.\"\n\n\"Don't even mention such a thing. I don't want to go back. Let's go\n\nand eat the Seven Spices or whatever the devil they call it.\"\n\nAgnes closed the shutters, turned off all the lights and the TV. Then\n\nshe asked me almost incidentally, \"Did he get rid of the hiccups?\"\n\n\"What? No-not at all.\"\n\nEarly the next morning, (I was finally resting after a night of\n\ninsomnia), I got up with a start with the sensation that a telephone\n\nwas ringing. Since I was a guest I never answered. But I wasn't\n\ncompletely sure that it was the telephone in the wing of the\n\napartment where Agnes slept that was ringing. I hurried across the\n\nentrance to the living room where the other telephone was. The line\n\nwas free. A Calder mobile swung silently above my head while I looked\n\naround to find a clock. Light was coming in from the garden. It must\n\nhave been about 6AM and I went back to bed with tense nerves\n\nwondering if the telephone really had rung.\n\nWhen I had awakened for the second time, I was sure I heard the\n\ntelephone ring. Outside the typical sounds of the market day could be\n\nheard. I heard the thump of the mail that fell through the mail slot\n\nin the door. This meant it was 8AM. The mail always arrived\n\npunctually.\n\nI got to the phone in time to say \"Hello\"- and hear the Yoga teacher,\n\nMonique Godard, excuse herself for calling so early in the morning.\n\nShe was a nervous woman, smoked like a chimney, always wore very\n\nshort skirts and was tall and stylish enough to be a model.\n\nEverything about her contradicted my knowledge of Yoga. Her ability\n\nas a healer had earned her an incredible reputation among her\n\nillustrious clients, the most exalted minds of Paris. She had great\n\ninfluence on them and although I entertained serious doubts as to her\n\npowers, I had contacted her hoping she would accept Pam as her\n\npatient. Nothing that could help Pam could be done soon enough.\n\n\"I'm leaving town and I won't be back before you return to\n\nCalifornia,\" she explained. \"If your friend needs my help he must\n\nfirst see a doctor. I want him to have a check-up. You can tell him\n\nthat. Does he have a history of drugs? Does he have circulatory\n\nproblems? I must know this.\"\n\n\"But I didn't get in touch with you for Jim's sake.\" I reminded her.\n\nIt's for Pam. I thought I made that clear. \"Weren't you aware of this\n\nthe other day when we were in their apartment? God, she was in bad\n\nshape.\"\n\n\"Who, her? I would never take her, never. But as far as your friend\n\nis concerned, I want him to see a doctor immediately. I feel these\n\nthings. It could even be too late. Well, I've got to go.\"\n\n\"Wait- Are you hiding something from me? What-yes, well-all right,\n\nall right.\"\n\n\"By any chance did you also call before? No? I thought it might have\n\nbeen you. Do you have to hang up?\"\n\n\"Please wait - then you will look after Jim - take care of him. I\n\nwon't be here and I've been worried about him since yesterday. Yes.\n\nThank you.\"\n\n\"Have a good trip.\"\n\nThis call upset me. I didn't know what to do. I was short on ideas.\n\nA few minutes later the phone rang again. It was Pam. She usually\n\nspoke in a soft tone of voice, but this time there was a note of fear.\n\n\"Can you speak a little louder?\"- I shouted into the phone as if I\n\ntoo had the same tone.\n\n\"Jim's unconscious and bleeding. Call an ambulance. You know I don't\n\nspeak French. Hurry up.\" - Pam was sobbing. Then, she added, \"I think\n\nhe's dying.\"\n\nI ran across the garden to the wing where Agnes was and knocked\n\nrepeatedly at the door. She immediately awakened. I didn't know how\n\nto use the complicated Parisian phone system and I asked her to do it\n\nfor me. Agnes grabbed her orange telephone while saying to me, \"I\n\ndon't know Jim's address. Write it on this paper - I'll take you\n\nthere, meanwhile, leave a message for the maid and Bernardo. Write\n\nthat I had to go out on an emergency.\"\n\n\"Why are you dialing the number over and over again? What's going on?\"\n\n\"Be calm. We're not in the United States here. It takes time. Bring\n\nyour passport along, you'll need it.\"\n\nI told Agnes not to give Jim's name, only the apartment number and I\n\nran back across the garden to my room. When I returned Agnes was\n\nputting on a long madras dress over her nightgown while she talked on\n\nthe phone, \"She is American. She doesn't speak French. Send someone\n\nwho speaks English - third floor, the door on the right.\"\n\nIn my mind I was already on the way. I was trembling and peeing in my\n\npants out of fright. Pam had always had a penchant for drama, but I\n\nfelt that this time it would be different.\n\nTraffic was at a standstill near the Ile de la Cite, where some\n\nstudents were demonstrating. They took advantage of the situation by\n\ntrying to explain their reasons for the protest to the motorists. I\n\ntried to close the car window in the face of flyers they were trying\n\nto stuff into the car, but Agnes talked me out of it saying that it\n\nwas getting unbearably hot.\n\nThen Agnes managed to find a space between two buses that she could\n\npass through with her old Volkswagen and in a flash we arrived on the\n\nRight Bank. She passed all the cars along the way weaving through the\n\ntraffic, losing time only in the little one way streets around the\n\nBastille. I wasn't able to hold myself back from asking her, \"In your\n\nopinion can there be a scientific basis to the fact that persistent\n\nhiccups are a sign of imminent death?\"\n\n\"Where did you hear that?\"\n\n\"My father told it to me when he got them in the hospital.\"\n\n\"It's not true. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"Well he died a few hours later and I never found out if it was a\n\ncoincidence or not. I didn't even think of it yesterday. Damn, it\n\nonly I had.\"\n\nWe saw the ambulance in front of the building and passersby were\n\ncoming from other crowded streets to follow the unfolding drama. An\n\nofficial held back the crowd and escorted us to the front entrance.\n\n\"Is he all right?\" I asked.\n\n\"You must inquire upstairs. I'll take you there now,\" he answered\n\nwhen Agnes was already on the stairs. The standers by were pushed\n\nback and had formed a human barrier on the landing. I questioned\n\ntheir faces to discover if there were any news, but I saw nothing.\n\nI had a flashback: While I was coming up to the landing, just last\n\nweek, Jim let a bundle of firewood fall (we had just bought wood for\n\nthe fireplace). He was winded and couldn't get his breath back. He\n\ncomplained staying that he needed the firewood to keep warm, in June.\n\n\"But do you feel OK?\" I asked him. \"Look at me, I'm ten years older\n\nthan you and not exactly in such terrific shape, but I'm not winded\n\neither.\"\n\nThe third floor door was flung wide open. I saw Pam standing all\n\nalone at the end of the entrance corridor, but I couldn't see too\n\nwell because of a group of officials standing in the way. They moved\n\nout of the way when I tried to reach Pam who told me that Jim was\n\ndead.\n\n\"My Jim is dead, Alain, he left us, he's dead.\" She added, \"I want to\n\nbe alone now, please leave me alone.\"\n\nI didn't know where to go, so I waited for her to make the first\n\nmove. She did so by going into the kitchen and leaving me in the\n\nfoyer to realize what she had just told me.\n\nI felt and thought nothing. A moment of impasse. Stunned as if\n\nboredom had assaulted me, I looked around trying to concentrate on\n\nsomething else. My glance fell on Jim's boots which were standing\n\nerect in the other room. The right boot was slightly ahead of the\n\nleft as in walking. I felt as if I had entered a state of deja-vu\n\nmade possible by years of rehearsing the same script, a gift of Jim\n\nMorrison, rock singer, dramatic actor-friend.\n\nThanks for having prepared me to all this, Jim. It's really been a\n\ngreat help.\n\nFuck you, Jim.\n\nAgnes was at the entrance asking the official in charge if he was\n\nreally sure that Jim was dead. He very courteously replied that they\n\nwere unable to do anything for him since they had arrived at least an\n\nhour too late.\n\nI saw Pam go into his room and didn't trust leaving her alone so I\n\nasked Agnes to stay with her. \"Do you know where her clothes are?\n\nShe's all wet\", Agnes asked me a few minutes later. I showed her the\n\ncloset near the entrance close to where an official was standing.\n\nWhen she moved towards the other people I whispered to her, \"Don't\n\ntell them who you are or who Jim was. Let me do the talking. If they\n\ndiscover you're a director they could get suspicious. We must let Jim\n\npass for a normal American citizen.\"\n\n\"But do you seriously think they'll know who I am? Believe me, they\n\ndon't have any idea my films exist.\"\n\n\"You were on TV recently. Agnes Varda is about to become a very\n\nfamiliar name to everyone.\"\n\n\"Don't exaggerate.\" Agnes concluded going back toward Pam's room.\n\nI heard that they defined me as an American friend of his, in the\n\nliving-room and I drew close in order to eavesdrop. There was a newly\n\narrived police inspector who had come to find out how Jim was found\n\nin the bathtub. He was coming close to the bedroom.\n\nI promised myself not to listen to anymore details in an effort to\n\neliminate all information that would have made that death more real.\n\n\"The condominium's concierge told me that you have lived here for\n\nover a month and that you too are American.\" the inspector told me\n\nright away.\n\n\"I moved a few days ago to stay with another person.\"\n\n\"How come you speak French so well?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Because I was born in Paris, but I am a naturalized American\n\ncitizen. Can we get this over with soon? I'm a little upset and I\n\nwould like to.\"\n\n\"Give me your particulars, those of your friend, and also of his girl\n\nfriend - nationality, occupation - I would like to find out if he was\n\nusing drugs.\n\nHe would find this out anyway when the medical examiner arrives.\" He\n\nturned and asked the paramedic to fill out a complete report. The\n\npause gave me time for an idea: Inverting Jim's two names would have\n\nmomentarily taken them off the track. For the moment it was all I was\n\nable to do.\n\n\"My friend's name was Douglas James Morrison. He was American and a\n\npoet..\" I waited until he had finished writing, then I added, \"He was\n\nan alcoholic but he didn't use drugs.\"\n\nEven if Jim's death were to have been described by the medical\n\nexaminer as that of a young American found dead in his bathtub, the\n\nnewspapers would have reported the item anyway. And even if Jim's\n\nnames had not been reversed, there would have been readers astute\n\nenough to decipher the true identity of the deceased in question. His\n\npresence in Paris was no secret and this touch of deceitfulness was\n\non the lowest level.\n\n\"Usually poets don't have a luxurious life-style, monsieur,\" the\n\ninspector observed. \"How could he afford and apartment like this?\"\n\n\"You see, he was a poet, but he had many business ventures.\"\n\n\"Come on now, Victor Hugo was hardly born with a white beard and\n\nRimbaud didn't have one when he died.\" I exclaimed. \"Can we stop for\n\na moment, all of this is making me feel ill-I would like to join my\n\nfriends for a moment.\" \"That's all for now,\" he assured me, \"and if\n\nthe district medical examiner makes a satisfactory report, we will be\n\nable to issue a death certificate and a burial permit. Otherwise\n\nother doctors will be called in to work on the case.\"\n\n\"How many others?\"\n\n\"Many.\"\n\nThe sign on Jim's door read, \"I'm sleeping don't disturb\" in Arabic\n\nand French. My glance lingered interminably on the door handle,\n\nbefore I decided to give it a half turn to open the door. I didn't\n\nwant to see Jim dead. The last time, when I saw him at the cafe -\n\nthat's the way I wanted to remember him. (So that's the way\n\neverything has to end. What a squalid ending.)\n\nUnexpectedly, the last of the policemen left the room where Jim was,\n\nleaving the door open. From my line of vision I was able to see his\n\nfoot well. This last sad sight, framed by the doorway, replaced the\n\nmemory of the cafe.\n\nPam stayed beside me and held my arm. She wore a white djelaba, a\n\nsouvenir from their last trip to Morocco, that gave her a ghost like\n\nlook.\n\n\"Did you give them Jim's real name?\" I asked her.\n\n\"No, and how could I have?\"\n\n\"I just gave Jim's name backwards. I mean I put Douglas first, then\n\nJames. It could put them off the track for a while. Now hurry up and\n\ntell me how he died. We won't be alone much longer.\"\n\nMethodically tearing the silk threads from the embroidery on her\n\nsleeve, Pam began to tell the story. \"The other night we can home\n\nright after the movie. When we arrived we immediately begain to sniff\n\nheroin and Jim began to play his songs. He played all of them, one\n\nafter another, even The End. Then we went to bed. Jim asked me to\n\ngive him some more stuff, that's how it happened that he took much\n\nmore than me, especially since he'd taken some on his own during the\n\nday. We also did a little on the night before.\"\n\n\"Who had it - you, Pamela?,\" Agnes asked.\n\n\"Of course, I'm the one who keeps it.\" Pam said these words in an\n\nunexpected singing tone, reaching almost falsetto, only to become\n\nnormal when she turned to me and said, \"Alain, you haven't seen him\n\nyet. My Jim is so beautiful-go, go and see-Go.\"\n\n\"And then what happened?\" I asked, ignoring her suggestion.\n\n\"We fell asleep. I didn't know what time it was when Jim's heavy\n\nbreathing woke me up. He was still asleep, but the poor guy had\n\nproblems in breathing. I tried to wake him up but he didn't react. I\n\npanicked and began to cry and hit him. I hit him hard once, twice,\n\nthree times- nothing happened. I slapped him a couple of times. Then,\n\nhe came to, but he didn't seem much like himself. I was very tired\n\nbut just the same I was successful in dragging him to the bathtub.\"\n\nThe whistle of the teakettle gave Agnes a momentary pause to run out\n\nonly to return a few minutes later with a glass and a spoon for\n\nPam. \"It's hot cammomile tea. It will do you good.\" I watched Pam sip\n\nslowly before asking her, \"By the way, who opened the bathtub faucet?\"\n\n\"I don't remember. I woke up later in a cold sweat. Jim was not in\n\nbed with me. I found him in the bathtub, unconscious. Blood was\n\nrunning down his face, then he had those red marks on the right side\n\nof his chest. Suddenly, he began to vomit into the tub. Then, I ran\n\nto the kitchen to look for a basin. I went back to him and in the\n\nbasin I saw little pieces of pineapple that we had for dinner and\n\nthen blood. I had to empty and wash the basin three times. The third\n\ntime I noticed a blood clot. I was so tired and he told me he felt\n\nbetter or something like that, so I went back to bed and fell asleep\n\nagain.\"\n\n\"What can you tell me?\", the medical examiner asked me. \"That he\n\ndidn't even smoke marijuana, not even in LA where joints are as\n\ncommon as cigarettes. And it's only last night that\"- I suddenly\n\nstopped talking. My nerves were shattered. I couldn't even\n\nthink. \"I'm sorry.\" the doctor informed me, \"I can't sign the\n\ncertificate for natural death.\"\n\nAgnes reached out to caress her hand and told her that the paramedics\n\nhad said that Jim had been dead at least an hour before they got\n\nthere. Pam didn't answer. She tore yet a few more silk threads from\n\nher sleeve and returned to telling the story, \"He had such a serene\n\nexpression. His head was slightly reclining and the water came up to\n\nhis chest, up to here - he was smiling a little. If it hadn't been\n\nfor all that blood, he....\"\n\n\"You know that bleeding to death is completely painless.\" Agnes\n\ninterrupted her. \"He couldn't know what was happening to him.\"\n\nAt that point the telephone rang. But, before Pam grabbed it, Agnes\n\nwarned her that it could be tapped. Therefore, all our conversations\n\nhad to be from a public phone. I wondered if it could be the young\n\ncount with whom Pam had run away at the beginning of the year,\n\nleaving Jim in Los Angeles. Pam had never named him directly while I\n\nlived with them. Every time she saw her Parisian friends, Jim and I\n\nwithdrew to the most remote corners of the house until they all left.\n\nWe never spoke about it and little by little I became convinced that\n\nJim really didn't care. His attitude was also consistent with his\n\nadvice to me: he told me not to worry if Pam threatened to commit\n\nsuicide. Looking back at the whole thing made me shudder. He made a\n\ndeliberate effort to get away from her and vaguely, paraphrasing a\n\nline that he used in one of his concerts, he said, \"There are only\n\ntwo choices you can make: each of us had made it. You and I are on\n\nthe side of life, she is on the side of death. Neither you nor I can\n\ndo\n\nanything about it. Don't worry about her.\"\n\n\"But Pam has threatened to fill the house up to the ceiling with\n\nheroin-the Marseille affair. Did she really do it? Where could she\n\nget the money -from the count? Tell me.\"\n\n\"I told you to fucking forget about it. Enough. I make it.\"\n\nAfter buying cigarettes I went back, making my way through the crowd\n\npicking up words like \"death\" and \"young\" and a word with which the\n\nParisians label their xenophobia, \"etranger\", which means foreigner.\n\nBut I didn't hear Jim's name, nor his profession. For the moment the\n\nsecret had been kept and the need for it to remain so increased when\n\nI looked at the greedy faces of the crowd waiting for some cheap\n\nthrills.\n\nGoing back toward the apartment, I saw two youths whose faces were\n\nvaguely familiar to me. Their tailors deserved to be spanked. I\n\ndidn't like them from the very beginning. I didn't like anyone who\n\nnever threw rocks at the police in '68, and they were exactly the\n\ntype that didn't. I had hardly closed the door behind me when the two\n\nguys rang the bell. The tall one introduced himself as Jean, the\n\nshort one as Jean-Louis. They asked for Pam. I explained to them that\n\nPam couldn't see anyone and I advised calling her the next day.\n\n\"Look, she was the one who called me.\" Jean said aggressively. \"I\n\nknow everything. I really do.\"\n\nMy silence was accompanied by some piano exercises. The notes came\n\nfrom the courtyard. I felt as if I were on stage in a play, exactly\n\nat the moment when the booing makes them bring the curtain down in a\n\nhurry. Agnes appeared stormily as deus ex machina. As his opening\n\nline Jean immediately said, \"I lived with Pam for six months.\"\n\n\"All right, but now you must leave.\" Agnes answered back with the\n\nspeed and precision that had earned her legendary reputation from the\n\nVenice Film Festival to the stage at Venice, California.\n\nShe would have thrown them out right away if Pam hadn't intervened by\n\ncalling Jean, telling him to come in. Pam and Jean were sitting on\n\nthe bed that I had slept on when I lived there. They chatted quietly\n\ntogether. I knocked. \"Please go away.\" I told him nervously. \"Don't\n\nendanger the situation. You mustn't be here when the medical examiner\n\narrives with the police. Please don't say anything to anyone. Do it\n\nfor Pam. Terrible trouble could happen.\"\n\nOn the landing, Jean told me that he was leaving for Marakesh, where\n\nhe had a house. He would have arranged everything in case Pam had\n\nwanted to join them there. In case it should become necessary he\n\nwould even make his London apartment available. In exchange, I\n\npromised to keep him informed of further developments.\n\n\"I can't believe she has friends like them.\" Agnes said shaking her\n\nhead and closing the door after them. \"They're drug dealers.\"\n\n\"A count?\"\n\n\"Why not? What do you think? Just because someone's a count should he\n\nwin a prize for virtue? Tell me, do you believe what Pamela goes\n\naround saying? I think that it's a classic case of the drug addict\n\nthat casts her own companion in the same role.\"\n\nI wasn't able to answer. Pamela had joined us.\n\n\"Pam, is there any stuff left in the house?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" she immediately protested. \"The first thing I did was to flush\n\neverything down the toilet. There's nothing left.\"\n\n\"Agnes just told me that Jean found a hashish pipe under the carpet\n\nin the\n\nfoyer. If he took it with him we must be very careful.\"\n\nJim's desk in the other room was wide open until Pam jammed all his\n\npapers into it, including a whole bunch of prints of An American\n\nPrayer. She locked it ceremoniously and inspected the room, looking\n\nfor anything that could have something to do with Jim. In her\n\ncircular movement, her stare cut through me like a laser beam. I\n\nrealized that she could even have accused me of theft. It would not\n\nhave been a surprise and considering the stress she was under, who\n\nknows what she was capable of doing. I could have considered myself\n\nfortunate that she had locked everything up in front of Agnes.\n\nAgnes' interest in the whole matter showed no signs of abating, but\n\nit would have been compromising for her to stay, and I didn't want\n\nher to get involved in all of this. After a few objections, Agnes\n\nresolved to leave.\n\nShe told Pam that she would prepare a bed for her at her house.\n\nWhile Pam was leaving the room, I looked out the window. The crowd\n\nwas slowly dissipating. I noticed a plaque to Victorien Sardou\n\naffixed to the opposite building. Captured by the imaginary rivalry\n\nbetween the playwright and Jim, I wondered if they would hang a\n\nplaque for him too. And how would they have defined him? Poet or\n\nsinger? I would have to go back after a few years to find out - I\n\nmust stay, I thought. I'm flipping out.\n\n\"Burn them in the fireplace, quick\", Pam told me, rushing into the\n\nroom and handing me a pack of letters.\n\n\"We can't. The police would smell the burning. It's the hottest day\n\nof the year.\"\n\nPam set fire to an envelope to light the fireplace and went out\n\nimmediately afterwards to get more letters. Upon throwing the second\n\nbatch of letters on the fire, she put it out. At that moment, I\n\nnoticed that the letters had her handwriting. I wondered what she had\n\nwritten.\n\n\"Drug stories,\" Pam said, reading my thoughts, \"drugs and me,\n\nnaturally, but this, this is about Jim and it's better that they\n\ndon't see it. Here, read\n\nit.\"\n\nI took the Los Angeles police report, two photocopies yellowed with\n\nage. Jim was caught on the balcony of the Hyatt Hotel on Sunset\n\nBoulevard. Babe Hill was also involved in the matter and the police\n\nfound some marijuana.\n\n\"Was the 'stuff' Jim's?\"\n\n\"No, it was Babe's,\" Pam replied, while she picked up some 8mm film\n\nfrom the floor. \"Last night we watched all the rolls of film taken on\n\nthe trip: Granada, Morocco, Corsica. We also sang the sound track for\n\nit. What do you call those songs of Jim's that goes, \"run with me\"\n\nand \"let's run\" - You know which ones.\"\n\n\"I don't remember either ... you didn't tell me what you thought of\n\nthe film I sent you to see.\"\n\nPam smiled at the memory and said, \"What a rascal. It's really us,\n\nthe two of us.\"\n\nA few letters that Pam was holding in her hand fell to the ground\n\nwhere they came to life lifted by the breeze from the window. They\n\nbegan to circle around the room. Finally, Pam was successful in\n\nfinding what she was looking for at my feet.\n\n\"Do you think they will believe it, if I tell them that this is my\n\nmarriage certificate? I don't think they know English.\"\n\n\"It won't work. You can see that it's a request to make a marriage\n\ncontract. The same word exists in French.\"\n\n\"We did this in Denver, but we never 'consummated' it,\" she said,\n\nsmiling to herself as if sharing an intimate joke.\n\nI noticed the book and the magazine that I had left there the day\n\nbefore and I explained that Jim had given me the opening article of\n\nNewsweek to read (here copy garbled unable to translate) I asked\n\npermission to take them. Pam answered me and began to clumsily leaf\n\nthrough the pages of the magazines, while I happened to (glance) at\n\nthe cover for the first time. The title Plague of Heroin. What To Do\n\nabout it.\n\nWhat happened next was.. (garbled) ( Pam went and got a coat, I\n\nbelieve a fur coat and put it on) Alain says \"Whose is it?\"\n\n\"It belongs to a friend of mine, the owner of this place. Look,\n\nshe'll never give back the money that I paid in advance for the rent,\n\ntherefore....\"\n\n\"Come on Pam, take it off. Put it back. You can't go around\n\nconfiscating other people's things. I beg you, don't do it. You'll\n\nlook ridiculous in that in Los Angeles. You're really in trouble\n\nhere, can you imagine were the police to suspect you of foul play or\n\nhomicide? Put that fuckin' fur away. Did you hear me?\"\n\nPam took off the fur and quietly finished her work of research and\n\ndestruction. I asked myself for how much longer could I put up with\n\nher.\n\nThe whistling stopped only an instant before the doorbell rang. I guy\n\nstood there giving his personal contribution to the speculations of\n\nthe neighborhood: he had announced himself with the Aria Vissi d'arte\n\nfrom Tosca.\n\nThe district medical examiner was a stocky man but he wore his\n\nclothes in a most elegant style. His black case made introductions\n\nunnecessary.\n\nThe Police Official had a very dry manner and he didn't offer the\n\nleast bit of sympathy for the situation in which we had found\n\nourselves. He was completely amazed by the fact that the medical\n\nexaminer had given us permission to leave the house. \"Don't think\n\nthat this is a game,\" he admonished with a very serious demeanor.\n\n\"Where's the corpse?\" he asked.\n\nI pointed out the closed door, \"There\".\n\nHe went ahead, stopped and turned impatiently, \"Come on, Let's go,\n\nYou've got to come with me to lay out the body. This is the\n\nprocedure.\"\n\n\"I can't. I've decided not to see my friend dead. I don't want to\n\nremember him that way. I beg you, please do it alone.\"\n\n\"No,\" he insisted with authority.\n\nPam joined us. She seemed to be in a trance and her voice had an\n\nartificial sound.\n\n\"This is my very beautiful man, sir,\" she said introducing him into\n\nthe bedroom. She seemed so sad.\n\nThe doctor completed the exam in a few minutes and then returned to\n\nthe\n\nliving room.\n\n\"Madame does not speak French. May I answer eventual questions?\" I\n\nasked.\n\n\"Of course. How old was he? Did he take drugs?\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven. No, he absolutely did not take drugs,\" I replied\n\nrapidly. Then I added, \"In fact, he didn't even smoke marijuana, not\n\neven in Los Angeles where joints are smoked like cigarettes. No,\n\ntruly. Absolutely out of the question.. In fact it was only yesterday\n\nthat he...\"- I suddenly stopped talking. My nerves were gone. I was\n\nlosing control. Why had the doctor spent so little time? Was the case\n\nalready closed? In our favor, or against us? I just couldn't get it\n\ntogether.\n\nSuddenly, I began to talk again as if I had been forced, \"You should\n\nknow that my friend was very pale the last time I saw him, a few\n\nhours before he died. He had hiccups that wouldn't go away. I wanted\n\nto be sure to tell you this. He went to the doctor's a month ago when\n\nhe was in London and the doctor said...\"\n\nThe doctor made a vigorous gesture with his hand to stop me. \"All\n\nright, I understand\" he exclaimed, handing me an address and an\n\nenvelope. \"Take this to the municipal building of the fourth\n\narrondissement and go to the Civil Register department. They will\n\ngive you a death certificate.\"\n\nIt was lunchtime when we reached the municipal building and the\n\nconcierge told us to come back around two o'clock. We went to the\n\nclosest cafe and ate lunch in silence. I was overcome by a sense of\n\ntenderness and my hand reached out to take Pam's. I felt a strong\n\nsense of support for her and I kissed her wonderful red hair. She\n\nwiped her eyes and gave me a smile that could knock you out. The\n\natmosphere was strongly perplexing.\n\n\"Pam, I don't know how to tell you this. You are Jim's heir. You have\n\nto go on for him. We need you. You've got to take care of yourself.\n\nDon't do anything foolish. You know what I'm talking about. You know\n\nthat I love you. I know it sounds corny, I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe looked at me fleetingly with a dazed expression. Then, her eyes\n\nsuddenly left mine to look up at the clock on the bell tower in front\n\nof us.\n\n\"What time must it be in Los Angeles?\"\n\n\"Almost five in the morning, why?\"\n\n\"Wait before you call anyone. Wait until everything is done.\" I said.\n\n\"I have to call my sister, Judy. I want her to run to the Doors'\n\ncutting room to steal the earnings from Friends Party. It's in the\n\nClear Thoughts Building, opposite Electra. You know she's just had a\n\nbaby and she's poor. I'll offer her fifty dollars. She'll do it.\n\nAfter all, she's my sister.\"\n\n\"But this is obscene, Pam.\"\n\n\"Why? She needs money. Monday, during the screening of Jim's film I\n\nwill go there alone. You can't come.\"\n\nSince it was Saturday, there was only one woman in the civil register\n\ndepartment of the municipal building to take care of this work. It\n\ndidn't take her long to examine the contents of the envelope. The\n\nreason was simple: the death certificate due to natural causes had\n\nbeen denied.\n\nThe clerk made a telephone call and handed me the receiver, \"It's the\n\nchief. He needs to talk with you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I'm giving you ten minutes to return to the place of the deceased,\"\n\nhe told me. He was furious. \"Who gave you permission to run around\n\nParis, huh?\"\n\n\"Give us fifteen minutes-the traffic is crazy.\" I tried to add\n\nsomething but\n\nI didn't get an answer.\n\nPam was next to Jim when the police arrived. The chief had no\n\nintentions of dismissing the case. His manner was fry and there was\n\nnot one shred of sympathy for our situation. He was amazed, as was I\n\nthat the medical examiner had sent us to the municipal building. The\n\nmedical examiner of the Arrondissement (really, an area larger than a\n\ndistrict) would come to make sense of the situation.\n\nAfter having asked a couple of general questions, the chief had the\n\napartment inspected. I looked at the fireplace and the surrounding\n\nfloor in order to find eventual traces of Pam's burning spree.\n\nWith sudden inspiration, I ran out of the room ad asked permission to\n\nuse the bathroom. Once inside, I made sure that nothing was left,\n\ndespite Pam's \"clean-up operation.\" There was not even a speck of the\n\nstuff.\n\nThe chief was inspecting the bathtub. I avoided looking at it and\n\nstared straight ahead. \"We would like to know when to remove the\n\nbody,\" I said.\n\nHow horrible, I thought to myself, thinking of the events of a few\n\ndays earlier, while I was describing the end of a play to Jim, a play\n\nfor which he didn't want to stay to see the end. \"It was the best\n\npart,\" I told him. \"Bob Wilson constructed the set in such a way that\n\nthe audience had to stand up and go to it in order to see nude actors\n\nstrewn here and there, pretending to be dead. In the middle was an\n\nold style bathtub in which there was somebody impersonating the David\n\npainting, the one about the assassination of Marat...What a scary\n\ntouch, a 'tableau mourant' so to speak.\"\n\n\"I don't want to discuss the body now,\" answered the chief, bringing\n\nme back to reality. \"Moreover, get out of here, I have to do some\n\nimportant work here. Do you think this is a game?\"\n\nEven if a rock magazine was to later define Jim's apartment as\n\nluxurious, Pam was sitting on the only decent piece of furniture. We\n\nremained in silence until the chief joined us to tell us that nothing\n\nnew had come up, and that if the new doctor were to give the go\n\nahead, we would really be able to have the death certificate and the\n\nburial permit.\n\n\"Monsieur, what do we now do with Jim's body?\" I asked very\n\ncautiously.\n\n\"Forget about the body,\" he said .. \"I asked you not to talk to me\n\nabout it. And, if we have to send it to the police lab for final\n\nanalysis the corpse will remain here until further instructions. The\n\nonly problem will be the heat of the next few days.\"\n\n\"The only problem - the next few days - What the hell are you talking\n\nabout?\" I exclaimed, \"Listen, you would hardly want to impose cruelty\n\nof that kind on madame? No, never.\"\n\n\"Tell me what's happening,\" Pam wanted an answer.\n\n\"All right, monsieur. Now I've had enough. Please, both of you come\n\nwith me, now.\"\n\nDuring the brief trip to the Quartier de l'Arsenal police station, I\n\nurged Pam to cry, to abandon herself to hysteria, in short, to do\n\nwhatever she could to prevent herself from answering, thus\n\ncontradicting whatever I would have said in French. To our advantage\n\nwas the fact that she was always in a sate of stress. Even if they\n\nhad tried to read her expressions, they wouldn't have succeeded.. She\n\nknew how to disguise her emotions perfectly well. If only I had been\n\nable to do so - The greatest threat was inherent in my face: whatever\n\nI was experiencing could be seen immediately.\n\nThe chief inserted the form in triplicate into the typewriter and\n\nprepared\n\nto listen to Pam.\n\n\"May I help you by interpreting?\" I asked only too hastily.\n\nHis answer was terrifying. \"That won't be necessary. I understand\n\nEnglish. Now, please be calm. Thank you.\"\n\nWhile I was trying to remember what he could have heard of the\n\ndialogue between Pam and me of a little while earlier, (did we\n\nsay \"Jim\" by accident?) she was giving some dangerously detailed\n\nanswers. For the moment, she hadn't yet contradicted my version. But,\n\na certain inconsistency lingered on her whole story, arousing the\n\nchief's suspicions, especially in the part where Jim was throwing up\n\nin the bathtub.\n\nThe chief asked, \"So, you abandoned Douglas to empty and wash the\n\nbasin three times?\" Bending over and resting his hands on his knees,\n\nhe continued, \"And where did you empty and wash the basin?\"\n\nThere was only one place where she could have done it (strange that\n\nshe didn't understand that she would have had to go to the toilet\n\nthat was separated from the bathtub, and moreover quite far). Pam\n\nanswered, pronouncing the words syllable by syllable. \"I used the\n\nsink in the bathroom.\"\n\nSurely, my thoughts were traveling in tandem with those of the chief.\n\nThe blood clot and pieces of food should have clogged up the drain.\n\nWhy would she have used the sink? I held my breath. Then, something\n\nincredible happened. The chief skipped over her answer and asked me\n\nto act as interpreter in order to finish sooner.\n\nEverything was going smoothly until Pam described the way she had\n\nslapped Jim to wake him up. The vehemence that Pam put into her\n\ntelling of the story, added to the series of emotions she evoked,\n\nmake the chief reflect. A siren rang out in the silence, while Pam\n\nand I avoided looking at each other.\n\n\"What relationship did Madame Courson have with the deceased?\"\n\n\"I don't know how to say it in French. She is practically his real\n\nwife.\"\n\n\"I understand. She was his concubine.\"\n\n\"Come on, be serious!\" I protested with a bewildered smile. \"Isn't\n\nthere another way to define her position?\"\n\n\"Did she have sexual relations with the deceased last night? Before\n\nhe died, obviously.\"\n\n\"You have no right to ask that. It sounds rather ambiguous and\n\ndisgusting, don't you think?\"\n\nThe chief didn't react and I calmed down. So, I asked Pam who\n\nanswered me, \"No.\"\n\nFortunately, a clerk interrupted the questioning and told us to\n\nimmediately return to the apartment. The second medical examiner was\n\non his way.\n\nPam, who managed to contain herself all this time, blurted out on the\n\nstreet, \"You will no longer speak in a language that I can't\n\nunderstand, all right? You could say anything and I wouldn't\n\nunderstand it. I'm sorry, but how can I understand you? I want to\n\nknow everything you'll say from now on, every word.\"\n\nI just had time to say, \"You've got to trust me\", before bumping into\n\nthe man who was coming. He was carrying a black leather bag.\n\nThe new doctor radiated affability. Even his handshake raised my\n\nspirits. Once inside, he immediately went toward Jim's room, only to\n\ncome out just as quickly, just as the other doctor had done. He\n\nexamined the bathroom and finally joined us in the dining room. He\n\ntold us that it was rather strange that a young man should die in the\n\nbathtub and added that he was in excellent physical condition, just\n\nlike someone who was used to playing sports.\n\nHe was completely off the track. Jim was a loner. He had never joined\n\na sports club- he swam rarely. His excellent physical condition\n\nprobably derived from the fact that often, during his work, he would\n\nfall off stages or throw himself off roofs or out of windows that\n\nwere part of stage sets. Even though Jim had never been vain, this\n\nposthumous complement would surely have pleased him.\n\nRecently he had lost weight, especially because he had stopped\n\ndrinking.\n\n\"Monsieur, what will we do now with Jim's body?\" I asked. \"Forget\n\nabout the body, I told you.\" I told you not to discuss this problem.\n\nIt's possible that the police have to subject it to analysis.\n\nTherefore, the body is to remain in the (bedroom??) (bath tub??),\n\njust where it is now.\"\n\n\"But, what are you saying,\" I shouted. \"You can't impose that kind of\n\ncruelty on madame.\"\n\nI observed this vivid, ruddy complexion and I hurried to say what I\n\nhad not said before, that Jim liked to drink alcoholic beverages. He\n\nimmediately reassured me, saying that in France, very many people\n\ndrink. I told him about Jim's recent experience with doctors: the\n\nnighttime call to the doctor from the London hotel because he had\n\nbreathing problems, the medicines for asthma that were prescribed for\n\nhim by the doctor (even if it hadn't been diagnosed), the coughing\n\nfits that had gone on for the whole preceding month and his difficult\n\nrecovery period.\n\nHe smiled to me paternally and said, \"We, too, want to resolve this\n\nmatter. Now, I'll go to the police station where I'll write the\n\nreport. You both look very tense. Rest for half an hour or so, then\n\njoin me. I will tell them you're coming later.\"\n\nPam joined us and he said, \"Au revoir, madame. I beg you to accept my\n\nmost sincere condolences.\" He shook her hand, then took her wrist to\n\nfeel her pulse. He made an affirmative gesture with his head to\n\ncommunicate that all was going well. Then, he left. Poor Pam began to\n\ncry. Until that moment, nobody had shown her care. This had done her\n\ngood.\n\nThen she dried her tears and changed her attitude.\n\n\"I want Xanax. Give them to me now!\" she yelled.\n\n\"I got rid of them so they wouldn't find them.\"\n\n\"You have no idea of the face you make when you lie. All right, I\n\ndon't care. Anyway, I still have some hidden someplace or other. I\n\nhave to calm down, you see? It's so simple.\"\n\nShe had become frenetic and began to run from one room to another,\n\nsearching at random. I figured that she was looking for her pills,\n\nbut I couldn't make sense of the jar she had in her hand. In Jim's\n\nstudy, she found a fifty franc note and stuck it into the jar. Then,\n\nshe spotted Jim's shirt hanging on the door handle and rummaged\n\nthrough the pockets, fishing out a few coins that she put in the jar,\n\nwhile she looked at me triumphantly. When she finished her tour, the\n\njar was still half empty.\n\n\"In all, I have only two hundred dollars,\" she announced. \"Usually, I\n\ncall Los Angeles when we need money. How will I pay for Jim's\n\ncremation? I'll ask Agnes- she already offered, even though I'm not\n\nsure I want to go to her house tonight.\"\n\n\"As you know, I don't have cash on me. But, if they accept credit\n\ncards, and I think they do, we can use mine. Do me a favor. Don't ask\n\nAgnes for the money.\"\n\n\"Why, don't you trust me?\"\n\n\"Of course, I trust you,\" I told her with little conviction. \"Now,\n\nit's nine o'clock on Saturday morning in America, and the banks will\n\nbe closed. Let's see-Oh, shit!- They'll be closed until seven o'clock\n\nTuesday morning, Paris time. You know that Sunday's the fourth of\n\nJuly, don't you? Therefore, the banks are closed also on the next\n\nday, aren't they? You can consider yourself lucky if you'll be able\n\nto have the money by Wednesday afternoon, For God's sake!\"\n\nPam had a sudden idea which it up her face, \"We can ask Bill Siddons\n\nto bring the money here personally. After all, the Doors' manager\n\nmust be good for something. I know Bob, the accountant, but he would\n\nnever send me the money. He doesn't like me and what's more, I don't\n\nlike him either. Of course, I could also tell him that Jim asked for\n\nthe money.\"\n\n\"But, do you realize that Jim's estate will be frozen? Why don't you\n\ntalk to Max Fink, the lawyer, and let him explain to you how things\n\nwork in cases like this - the legal documents and all the rest? Jim\n\nalways trusted him, and we can count on the fact that he will\n\nmaintain professional ethics of secrecy about Jim's death.\"\n\n\"I don't like him much either.\" said Pam, even though she would\n\nchange her mind later.\n\n\"I beg you not to speak to anyone except Max. And remember - a minute\n\nago you talked about cremation. Well, don't even think of it. Here in\n\nFrance, it's like admitting you know something about a crime. Here,\n\nthey usually don't give permission for it and, worse yet, they would\n\nrequest an autopsy. There for-forget about it. And if you're thinking\n\nof sending the body to the United States, the law provides for a\n\ncasket that is to be opened for inspection and other hassles. I know\n\nthis because I had my father's body shipped across the ocean in order\n\nfor it to be buried.\n\nPam did not want to grasp this.\n\n\"I want to disperse his ashes in a wonderful place. A place he would\n\nhave loved. I will ask Agnes to show one to me. After all, she's a\n\ndirector.\"\n\n\"Enough, I beg you- Listen, we've got to bury him and we've got to do\n\nit in a hurry, before the press gets wind of what is going on.\n\nOtherwise, we are in deep shit. By the way, Agnes knows one of the\n\nmost important big shots of the European press, and I think if she\n\nwere to ask him, he would keep everything quiet. No, better yet- It\n\njust occurred to me that once I took this guy's wife to a Doors'\n\nconcert. I took her backstage and introduced her to Jim who was\n\nreally nice to her. She adored him. I bet she would help us. Maybe we\n\ncould be successful in manipulating the press.\"\n\nI stopped for a moment to make sure Pam was following me.\n\n\"I'm thinking of Pere Lachaise, the cemetery where Chopin, Delacroix,\n\nPiaf and Isadora Duncan are buried. Even Alice B. Toklas is there.\n\nYou see Pam in this country, people have respect for artists. Even\n\nJim was really respected. He was not just a rock idol. He would\n\nfinally have ended up in the Larousse or in the Guide Michelin, not\n\non one of those idiotic maps they sell on Hollywood Boulevard. He\n\nwouldn't even have been part of those guided tours of the stars'\n\ntombs.\"\n\n\"Is Rimbaud there too?\"\n\n\"I don't know - I don't think so. Didn't he disappear in Africa?\"\n\n\"You know, I think perceptions remain in the body after death. So, if\n\nthey should bury him, Jim would feel the earth falling on top of him.\n\nHe would even be able to hear what people were saying around his\n\ntomb...\"\n\nI didn't have the slightest idea of how to answer such a statement.\n\n\"So, what's wrong with that?\" I asked her. \"We wouldn't say anything\n\nbad about him.\"\n\nWhile I was waiting for Pam's approval, another reason occurred to me\n\nfor wanting Pere Lachaise. \"I have to tell you about something that\n\nhappened a week ago,\" I told her. \"Jim and I were walking when all at\n\nonce he saw a distant hill and pointed it out he asked me to go\n\nthere. When we arrived, we realized that it was the cemetery, and\n\nthat it had just been closed.\"\n\n\"What a pity\"- I said. \"I wanted to see it for a long time.\"\n\n\"Right,\"- he told me. \"I will come back.\"\n\nWhy, I asked myself, had he used the singular and placed so much\n\nemphasis on it? I had no intention of leaving Paris at that time.\n\n\"Maybe he was trying to tell us something.\" Pam said.\n\n\"Do you know what to do to get in touch with the Morrisons? It would\n\nbe the thing to do - even to get their permission.\"\n\n\"We don't have to worry about that.\"\n\n\"Poor Andy, I would like him to find out about his brother from me,\n\nrather than from a newspaper.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about him. It's OK. He's a big boy now.\"\n\nThe rapid unfolding of events didn't give me time to really think of\n\nall the details. For the moment, the only important thing was to give\n\nJim a quiet burial far from the \"Big Top.\" Meanwhile, the story that\n\nPam had told me was just a story and I couldn't figure out how much\n\ntruth there was in it. Maybe she had contributed to Jim's death. Not\n\nonly her. There were probably also some other factors. If drugs had\n\nkilled him, I didn't want it to be found out. I was ashamed of it\n\nand, as I had occasion later to explain to Pam, there was something\n\nelse: I didn't want Jim to become a myth to follow. The mystery that\n\nwe built around Jim's death, his legend, suited me more than fine.\n\nA few minutes later, Pam began to rummage through the last drawer of\n\na small piece of furniture.\n\n\"It was Jim's\" she explained. \"But he didn't care for it too much.\"\n\nI was behind her and I could see that she was looking at the few\n\nphotographs of Jim. I looked away from the pathetic inventory of\n\nsouvenirs ... all the memories he and I had shared. I remembered them\n\nall very well and began to cry.\n\n\"Hey, we've got to go back to the police station. Look at what time\n\nit is,\" Pam reminded me.\n\n\"Please give me Monsieur Morrisons' passport,\" our old friend\n\ntold us\n\nas his welcoming statement. \"I must send it to the American Embassy.\n\nIt's just a formality.\"\n\nThe chief was therefore about to discover the exact sequence of Jim's\n\nname. We had to avoid giving him the passport.\n\n\"We left it in the apartment. I would have to look for it,\" I\n\ncautioned him. \"Do you feel like waiting for me or do you prefer that\n\nwe bring it there in person? In any case, the Embassy offices are\n\nclosed until Tuesday since we're celebrating Independence Day.\n\nBesides which, it's late. Don't you have to go home for supper?\"\n\n\"All right, you can do it yourselves and as a matter of fact, it is\n\nlate.. I'll be at your place again tomorrow morning. Try to be there.\n\nUntil then you can do what you like.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" I said suddenly, \"and the body?\"\n\n\"I had asked you not to talk about the body yet- Leave it where it is\n\nfor now.\"\n\nWe had just arrived home, when Pam went to see who had rung the\n\ndoorbell. A minute later she shouted to find out if I had ordered\n\nthat ice cream.\n\n\"No, and I don't think it can be done in Paris. Why?\"\n\n\"Please come here and talk to this guy.\"\n\nI was surprised by that man's extraordinary look. Only the little\n\nmoustache, the walking stick and the oversized shoes were missing for\n\nhim to become the exact impersonation of Charlie Chaplain. His\n\nclothes and hat were just right and his face was exactly the same.\n\n\"It's not ice cream\"- were his first words. \"It's only ice, dry ice.\n\nAnd it's not for you-it's for the corpse\"\n\nI looked at him with wide open eyes and invited him to enter.\n\n\"Come in. It's back there in that room.\"\n\nWhen what's his name left the room, he handed me his card and\n\nsaid, \"I will keep you informed about the schedule of my visits. Let\n\nme know how the situation is tomorrow. Believe me, I'll do my best,\n\nbut this heat is against us.\"\n\nI told him that Pam intended to spend the night next to Jim.\n\n\"Based on my many years of experience,\" he said, \"I really advise\n\nagainst that.\"\n\nThe Ice Man returned several times on Sunday and informed us that on\n\nMonday, the situation would be almost impossible to sustain.\n\nPam seemed exhausted, but her determination made her go on. She\n\ninsisted that having Jim in the house gave her a feeling of security.\n\nShe told me that if it were up to her, she would keep it like this\n\nforever.\n\nOn Monday, after some new ice was put in place, we received a phone\n\ncall from London. Some rumors were circulating, something to do with\n\nMarianne Faithfull's statements, something to do with Jim's death.\n\nPam, who had answered, said nothing.\n\nThe party was about to begin.\n\nThere was no time to lose. Agnes' connections with the press would\n\ncontinue to keep the newspapers quiet. Meanwhile, I made an\n\nappointment with a well known lawyer, in case unfortunate\n\ncomplications with the police should arise. Luckily, growing pressure\n\nforced Pam to make a decision. She gave approval for burial.. To Pere\n\nLachaise's.\n\nI organized everything with the span of a day.\n\nMeanwhile, I could no nothing to change her mind - Pam slept with Jim\n\nevery night. She was stubborn. I hated to imagine the whole scene and\n\nthe effect this could have had on her. Moreover, another thing\n\nhappened to complicate matters. She was beginning to get nasty with\n\nAgnes, who treated her like a daughter. As far as I was concerned,\n\nAgnes was of immeasurable help.\n\n\"Remember,\" I said to Pam, \"Agnes hardly knew Jim - They never saw\n\neach other alone and she has always been very correct. Do you\n\nremember when Jim told you that Agnes would probably be your only\n\nfriend in Paris if something difficult should come up. What a\n\nprophecy...\"\n\n\"I will never set foot in that woman's house again,\" were Pam's last\n\nwords.\n\nThe Bigot Funeral Parlor, located on the street next to Notre Dame,\n\nwas so close to the great cathedral that it could almost be taken as\n\na part of it. Even if this very crowded place seemed to be the same\n\nage as its venerable neighbor, it certainly didn't make it seem any\n\nbetter. The cathedral's shadow made it a dark place - and what's more\n\nthere was a single low wattage light bulb in use. It all suited my\n\nmood which was particularly black at that moment.\n\nMonsieur Guizard, the owner, quickly took care of the formalities\n\nwith highly professional expertise. At this point, I'd come to\n\nbelieve that he took care of everything there was to do there, when\n\nhis assistant arrived. His appearance, his broken nails, led me to\n\nsuspect that he personally took care of the burial work. He had a map\n\nof the cemetery so that he could choose the location for the tomb.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be buried at Pere Lachaise's. There's hardly any\n\nroom left. What was your friend? A writer, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Well really, he was a poet.\"\n\n\"Ah, in that case, we are in luck. Believe it or not, there is still\n\nroom in Division 89, where another famous American writer is buried.\n\nHis name is Oscar Wilde. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"No I beg you. Not next to Monsieur Wilde. Isn't there another place?\"\n\n\"Here. But it isn't really in a beautiful position.\"\n\n\"No, it's all right. It's OK. Thank you.\"\n\nEND.\n\nPost by darkstar3 on\n\nTHE END\n\nBy: Albert Goldman\n\nPenthouse Magazine – April 1991\n\nRepublished in The Doors Companion (1997)\n\nPages 144-158\n\nJim Morrison’s death – in Paris on July 3, 1971 – was kept so quiet that it took two days for even a rumor of the event to reach his manager in Los Angeles. When the phone awoke Bill Siddons and he got the word from London, he didn’t take it seriously. Why should he? Reports of Morriosn’s death were as common as UFO sightings. One day he was rumored blind or dead of OD; the day he had been killed in car crash or locked up on a lunatic asylum or was in a hospital with both legs amputated. Those were the terrifying disasters his dangerous aura suggested, and the aura was reinforced by the way he lived, always dead drunk or wildly high, constantly falling out of windows or cracking up his car or proclaiming in so unmistakable fashion that he was hell bent on dying. Yet as Siddons rolled over to go back to sleep, he found himself troubled by a worrisome impulse that finally compelled him to call the apartment in Paris where his star had been living for the past four months. Pamela Courson, Morrison’s girlfriend, offered no explanations, but she told the manager, as if he lived around the corner, to come over immediately.\n\nThree days later, Siddons addressed Morrison’s fans in a prepared statement released through a public relations firm, “I have just returned from Paris,” he announced, “where I attended the funeral of Jim Morrison. Jim was buried in a simple ceremony, with only a few close friends present. The initial news of his death and funeral was kept quiet because those of us knew him intimately and loved him as a person wanted to avoid all the notoriety and circus like atmosphere that surrounded the deaths of such other rock personalities as Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nWere the deaths of Joplin and Hendrix surrounded by a “circus like atmosphere”? Not really. There was a shock and horror, grief and curiosity, but the “notoriety” that enveloped those deaths was something again. It was engendered by their common cause – drug abuse. If the 27 year old Jim Morrison had died as the press release asserted – “peacefully of natural causes…with his wife Pam,” after seeing a doctor about a “respiratory problem” – why should there have been any fear of notoriety?\n\nThe truth is that there was a lot more to the death of Jim Morrison than could be inferred from Siddon’s bland statement; in fact, nobody with any brains has ever believed that Jim Morrison died peacefully in his sleep from natural causes. Yet even today, nearly 20 years after the event we still don’t know exactly what happened. Though Morrison is currently enjoying one of those electric resurrections that have given many old rock stars a second life, though his albums are selling better than ever and his legend is being told and retold in a steady stream of new articles and books and he has now been enshrined in a major motion picture by Oliver Stone, we have yet to hear a convincing account of how he died. Nor is his death a matter of little consequence in comparison with his life; in fact the two are one and the same thing., for no figure of the counterculture either in Jim’s lifetime or before him had ever lived with the image of death fixed so firmly in his mental gaze.\n\nFrom the beginning to the end of his brief but brilliant career, Jim Morrison wrote about death, talked about death, sang about death, and enacted death onstage. His masterpiece, the weird, shamanistic spirit voyage titled, “The End”, is entirely about death and its associations in his mind: patricide, maternal incest, drugs, love, and the end of the world.\n\nDeath not only looms up from his lyrics, but it sends its chilling breath out through the spooky music of the Doors, which often resembles a rock n roll dance of death. Everybody knew Morrison recognized that he was bound for an early grave, and this constant anticipation of his death finally translated itself into a wire dispatch March 7, 1968, while the band was at the height of its fame. That day a news service flashed, “Jim Morrison dead – more later.\n\nMorrison had a lot of reasons for his death obsession, and he was at pains to articulate them. Basically, he viewed life as struggle to escape the deadening clutches of mindless and insensibility, the numbing effect of the routines into which we all sink after childhood. He found in the defiant and risky lives of such underground poets as Baudelaire and Rimbaud and in the nihilistic philosophy of Nietzsche chapter and verse for his instinctive conviction that the only way to break through to passion, illumination, and ecstasy was to live dangerously. One is free to accept his arguments as either courageous convictions backed by the authority of intellectual and artistic genius or as neurotic rationalizations for a self destructive mania whose roots lay in his ill reported childhood or perhaps in some anomaly of his biochemistry. The only thing that really matters is the recognition that Jim Morrison’s life and art entailed a continuous dialogue with death, hence, the absurdity of treating his death, as some writers have done, as an unimportant or uninteresting event. The fact is that not knowing how Jim Morrison died is exactly like having a tragedy who final act consists of nothing but rough sketches for a half dozen possible endings.\n\nThis problem impressed itself strongly on Morrison’s only authentic biographer, pop journalist Jerry Hopkins. His widely read book, No One Here Gets Out Alive (which bears the name of Danny Sugerman as co author), was designed originally to be printed in two alternate versions, one concluding with Morrison’s death, the other with his escape after staging a fake demise, these being the basic alternatives. Naturally, the publisher rejected such a preposterous scheme, which was simply a gimmick for making a virtue out of failure in research.\n\nThe result is a biography that concludes in a hopeless welter of rumors and cockeyed speculations. Hopkins labeled the most plausible of these tales in “official” version without explaining what exactly makes it official. Apparently, this was the story that Pamela Courson told in a few years that intervened between Morrison’s death and her own.\n\nAccording to this account, Jim spent the early part of the evening of Friday, July 2, having supper on the terrace of a restaurant near his apartment with Pamela, his companion of five years – a pretty, freckled, innocent-looking girl from Orange County, California, with a bad heroin habit. They were accompanied by an old friend, Alan Ronay, a Paris born film technician who lives in Los Angeles but was staying at the time with two well known French filmmakers, Jacques Demy (director of The Umbrellas of Cherourg) and his wife, Agnes Varda. After dinner Morrison went off alone to see a film that Ronay had recommended, Raoul Walsh’s 1947 picture Pursued, a film noir treatment of the traditional Hollywood western, starring Robert Mitchum.\n\nWhen Morrison returned to the flat late that night, he vomited a little blood. Pamela was not unduly concerned, because this had happened before without ill consequences. When he announced that he was going to take a bath, she went to sleep. At five in the morning, she awoke and found him in the tub, “his arms resting on the porcelain sides, his head back, his long, wet hair matted against the rim, a boyish smile across his clean shaven face.” At first Pamela thought he was playing one of his macabre jokes, but then she called the fire department’s resuscitation unit.\n\nJerry Hopkins also possessed a far different and more interesting account to which he merely alludes, probably because he didn’t place much faith in it. This reconstruction was the work of Herve Muller, a French pop journalist who spent some time with Morrison in the last months of his life and actually phoned his apartment on the morning of his death, only to be told by Alan Ronay that the couple had gone out of town for the weekend. Subsequently, Muller published a book about Morrison, but he refrained from going to the details of his hero’s death; not until March of last year did his findings appear, in the French magazine Globe.\n\nAccording to Muller, Morrison had been waiting during the days that preceded his demise for a delivery of heroin from Marseilles (head-quarters of the “French Connection” – i.e., the Corsican Mafia). Jim had bankrolled this buy, which was costly but justified by the fact that the dealer, whose nom de dope was “le Chinois,” dealt only in the purest China White (highly refined heroin from Hong Kong). After the usual delays – accompanied doubtless by a lot of excuses from the connection’s bag dealers in Paris and a lot of paranoia in the Morrison household – word came through that the smack could be picked up at Jim’s customary hangout, the Rock n Roll Circus.\n\nThe Circus was a vaulted cave at 57 Rue de Seine in the student quarter of St. Germaine. Decorated with huge blowups of rock stars dressed in circus costumes, it was meant to capture the atmosphere of trendy British clubs, like the Bag O’Nails. It’s clientele was “restricted,” it’s hours mid-night till way past dawn, its cuisine American soul food, the décor of its super exclusive smoking room Moroccan, and its entertainment – apart from dancing to records – spontaneous jam sessions by visiting rock stars who wanted to stretch after hours.\n\nThe former manager, Sam Bernett, recalls that Morrison came in every night. “He was always high or drunk, in an abnormal state.” Few people recognized him because he had grown so fat that he appeared to be 40. One night he got rowdy and the bouncers, not knowing who he was, threw him out into an alley, where he was rescued by a French rock fan who carried him off to a friend’s garret. After spending the night, Jim took everyone out to breakfast the next day at an expensive sidewalk restaurant. Another night Morrison tried to mount the stage at the Circus but was too drunk to perform. In his last days, he spent most of his time in the men’s room, where the principal activity was scoring drugs.\n\nIt was in the men’s room, according to Muller, that Morrison met on his last night a drug runner named “le Petit Robert.” When Robert handed over the scag, he warned Jim, “This is very strong stuff.” Jim promptly took a toot and collapsed in a coma. A couple of “Pam’s friends,” perhaps two of the clubs husky bouncers, hauled Morrison out of the toilet (located upstairs in a quiet area) and through an adjacent fire exit that led into the kitchen of a glitzy transvestite cabaret, the Alcazar, which had shut down for the night. They carried him out of this club’s entrance, which was on the opposite side of the block at 62 Rue Mazarine. Here they put him into a car and carried him back to his apartment, where they immersed him a tub of cold water in an attempt to revive him.\n\nMuller concedes when pressed that he is not totally persuaded of the accuracy of his account because his sources were shadowy junkies and small time dealers with no reputation for honesty. Yet his story contains nothing inherently implausible. Though Morrison was not a junkie, he often bought heroin for Pam. (Scoring smack was a “mans job”.) Michel Auder, former husband of Viva, the Andy Warhol “superstar,” recalls encountering Jim on more than one occasion at the rooms of a heroin dealer in the Chelsea Hotel in New York, American disc jockey Cameron Watson recollects that a couple of weeks before Jim’s death, he observed him sitting on the terrace of the Café de Flor with a photographer, who got up and approached Watson, whispering, “Jim Morrison wants to buy some smack. Do you know where he can get some?\n\nThat Morrison himself would take a hit of something he had been warned against is perfectly in character. He would not have injected the drug, because he had a dread of needles. He would have sniffed it. And a couple of good snorts could have killed him, because nonusers lack the protective tolerance of the junkie. Though Muller’s tale is not well founded, it could be true, because it is true to “the life.”\n\nConfronted by two irreconcilable accounts of the same event, a biographer instinctively seeks a third source on which he can place greater reliance. But who would it be in this case? Clearly, there are a number of former intimates of Jim Morrison who know more about his death than they have ever divulged, but it is naïve to assume they would start talking after all these years, unless they could be offered an inducement that would appeal to them, like the opportunity to appear in a major motion picture.\n\nLacking the ability to offer this resource, I decided to go after the files of the French police. Ostensibly, these reports are confidential and available only to family members or their authorized representatives, but past experience suggested that there might be some way to slip past the bureaucratic barriers.\n\nBefore I made the attempt, however, I decided to ask Jerry Hopkins what he thought of the approach. He assured me that there were no official records because no autopsy had been performed. This was clearly nonsense, because nobody can die in a city like Paris without the police making a record of the event. On the other hand, there was the possibility that the death of Jim Morrison had been covered up by the police for some mysterious reason, and in that case, there would be no record, but its value would be nothing.\n\nAs it turned out, retrieving the files from the archives was not so difficult as I had assumed. After going through the usual bureaucratic rigmarole and sweating out a period of anxious uncertainty, my Paris researchers, Martha Legace and Anne Sohrada, succeeded in extracting the relevant documents: the dossier of the criminal investigation department of the French police and the report of an emergency rescue team in the archives of the fire department.\n\nThe police report consists primarily of the transcript of an inquest held at the Arsenal police station on the afternoon following Morrison’s death. Testimony was taken from the fire department lieutenant commanding the rescue unit, the officer of the criminal investigation department who inspected the premises ( and who presided over the hearing); medical examiner who viewed the body; and the two chief witnesses, Pamela Courson and Alan Ronay.\n\nCourson’s testimony demands to be considered first because it offers what purports to be a complete account of Jim Morrison’s last night. (Ronay acted as interpreter, which means that the police did not question one witness independently of the other.) In the translation that follows, the word ami is rendered as “friend,” although, of course, it can also mean “lover.”\n\n“I am the friend of Mr. Morrison,” Pamela declared. “I lived with him as his wife for five years. I arrived in France with my friend last March… He was a writer, but he lived on a private income. Before coming to love at (17) Rue Beautreillis (in the Marais district), we stayed for three weeks at the Hotel de Nice on the Rue des Beaux Arts. There my friend became ill. He complained of having trouble breathing, and he also had coughing fits at night. I called a doctor, who arrived at the hotel and prescribed pills for asthma. My friend didn’t like to go to doctors, and he never took care of his health. I can’t say who the doctor was who looked after my friend, and I didn’t keep the prescription. At the time of an earlier stay in London, my friend already had this same illness.\n\n“Last night….my friend went alone to have dinner in a restaurant, undoubtedly in the neighborhood. When he returned from the restaurant, the two of us went to the movies to see Pursued. The movie house is near the Pelletier metro ( in a sleazy commercial district in the ninth arrondissement). It’s called, I think, Action Lafayette.\n\n“We returned from the movies (at) about one in the morning. I did the dishes and my friend showed home movies. He seemed to be in good health and very happy. But I must say that he never complained – it wasn’t in his nature. Afterward, we listened to records in the bedroom. We listened lying together on the bed. I think we went to sleep around 2:30, but I can’t say exactly. The record player stopped automatically.\n\n“No we didn’t have sex last night.”\n\n“Around 3:30, I think – there wasn’t any clock in the bedroom and I wasn’t concerned about the time – I was awakened by the noise my friend was making breathing…I had the impression he was suffocating. I shook him and slapped him several times in order to wake him up. I asked him what was wrong. I wanted to call a doctor. My friend said that he felt fine and that he didn’t want to see a doctor. He got up and walked around the room. Then he said that he wanted to take a warm bath.\n\n“When he was in the bath, he called me and said the was nauseated and wanted to vomit. As I went toward the bathroom, I tool from the kitchen an orange pot. (He vomited in this pot.) It looked to me as though there was blood in his vomit. I emptied the pot. Then he vomited again into the pot – this time it was all blood. Then he vomited a third time, bringing up some blood clots. Each time I emptied the pot into the sink and rinsed it.\n\n“Then my friend said that he felt “bizarre”, but he said to me, ‘I’m not ill. Do not call a doctor. I feel better. It’s over.’ He said to me, ‘Go to sleep,’ and added that when he ahd finished bathing he would rejoin me in bed. At this moment, it did seem to me that my friend was getting better, because since he had vomited, the color had come back into his skin. I went back to bed and fell asleep immediately, because I felt reassured.\n\n“I don’t know how long I slept. I woke with a start and saw that my friend was not next to me. I ran into the bathroom and I saw that he was still in the bath tub. His head was not in the water. He appeared to be sleeping. His head was resting on the edge of the tub. There was a little blood under his nostrils. I thought I could wake him. I thought that he was ill and unconscious. I tried to take him out of the tub, but I couldn’t. At this moment I telephoned Mr. Ronay, another American, to ask him to call an ambulance.\n\n“About half hour later, Mr. Ronay came to my place. When Mr. Ronay arrived with his friend, Madame Agnes (Varda) Demy, they called, I believe, either the firemen or the police.”\n\nRonay’s testimony, predictably, corroborates Courson’s in every detail save one:\n\n“I have known Mr. Morrison since 1963. He is one my friends. This morning around 8:30, I was awakened by a telephone call from Miss Courson, who asked for my help. She told me to come right away. She was crying. She said that her friend had lost consciousness. I got up and went at once to the Rue de Beautreillis in the company of my friend, Madame Demy. (Jacques Demy was in London.) When I arrived, I saw the firemen in the street. I asked them what was happening. They didn’t tell me. I went up to the apartment. I saw Miss Courson…who told me that her friend was dead…He had already been removed from the bathroom and laid on the bed.\n\n“My friend Morrison drank a lot and did not hold his liquor well. I am certain that my friend never used drugs. He often spoke about the folly of young people who used drugs and considered this a very grave problem.\n\n“I saw Mr. Morrison yesterday afternoon around 6 P.M. I thought that he looked ill and told him. He replied that everything was going well. But in any case, he never complained. I took a walk with him yesterday afternoon. He told me that he was tired. In the course of our stroll, he had an attack of hiccups. This spell lasted, I think for about an hour. At one point he closed his eyes, and I noticed that his skin was gray. He told me that he had closed his eyes to concentrate on getting rid of his hiccups. We also carried up to his apartment some logs that were in the courtyard. My friend was extremely tired by this exertion.”\n\nFirst, it will be observed that these statements differ at many points from those in the so called “official” version published in the Hopkins-Sugerman biography. Second, there is a contradiction in Ronay’s and Courson’s testimony. Ronay says that the firemen were at the building when he arrived. But Courson, in her statement, translated by Ronay, says that he and Varda summoned the firemen after they arrived. Assuming Ronay’s account is true, who then, did summon the firemen?\n\nThe most valuable professional testimony offered at the inquest was provided by Lieutenant, now Colonel, Alan Raison, commander of the fire department rescue unit – ten men in a big truck – who were the first people to come to Courson’s aid. The lieutenant reported that he was summoned at 9:20 by a report of an “asphyxia”, a person in a state of suffocation. At 9:24 (the fire station was around the corner) he was met at the door of the fourth floor flat by a young woman whose nightgown was damp and who did not speak French. She led him to the bathroom, where he discovered a fat, naked man lying in the tub with his head reclining on a pad and his right arm extended along the rim. The pale pink tinged water in the tub was warm, as was the body, which was still supple.\n\nAs a hot tub will not retain any noticeable heat for more than two or three hours, it is clear that Jim Morrison drew the bath in which he died at dawn, not in the middle of the night as Pam related. Nor could she have discovered him dead at five o’clock.\n\nThe firemen removed the body from the tub and laid it on the bedroom floor to obtain the hard, unyielding surface required for heart massage. Soon they abandoned their efforts and, as the police arrived, they left the premises at 9:47.\n\nUpon their return t Sevigne Barracks, they filed a terse report. It states that Morrison had become ill at 5L30 but had decided to take a bath to make himself feel better. (“A neighbor” – i.e. Ronay – translated for Courson.) His “wife” then fell asleep and did not awaken until 9:15, when she discovered him in the tub. She described Morrison as “Writer, Singer.” Clearly, it was after the authorities had left and she had had time to discuss her predicament with Ronay and Varda that Pamela changed her tune and described Morrison as a writer living on a private income.\n\nWhen quizzed about these events, Varda offered two explanations: (1) “It was not as a rock star that I loved him. Why should French policemen know that he was a famous rock star?” (2) “You have to be very careful when a foreigner is involved.”\n\nThe report of the police investigator, Jacques Manchez, is interesting primarily for its misconceptions. After conferring with his colleagues from the fire department and after inspecting the body and the bathroom – where he measured the tub and the depth of its water – he went into the living room, where a patrolman introduced him to Courson, Ronay and Varda. He was told – and the error went into the records – that all three were Americans and that only Ronay spoke French. Not only did he mistake an established French filmmaker for a foreigner, but – evidently because she gave the same home address as Ronay, on the Rue Daguerre in Montparnasse – he described her as the latter’s “concubine,” the same term that he applied to Courson.\n\nThe most disappointing testimony was that furnished by the medical examiner, Dr. Max Vasille. He did not arrive at the apartment until six in the evening. The pertinent portion of his report, offers no insight into the cause of death. “I note,” the doctor attested, “that the body does not show, apart for the lividness of death, any suspicious signs of trauma or lesions of any kind. A little blood around the nostrils. The history of Mr. Morrison’s condition, such as it was described to us by a friend on the premises (Ronay?), can be summed up thus: Mr. Morrison had been complaining for a few weeks of precordial (over the heart) pains with dyspnoea (difficulty breathing). It was evidently coronary problems, possibly aggravated by abusive drinking. One can imagine that on the occasion of a change in outside temperature ( a puzzling remark) followed by a bath, these troubles were suddenly aggravated, leading to classical myocardial infraction (blockage of a coronary artery), causing sudden death. I conclude from my examination that death caused by heart failure (natural death).”\n\nUnder Article 47 of the French Penal Procedures Code, where there is “no crime or flagrant misdemeanor, the state prosecutor can charge a medical expert with the power of making an inquiry.” When the doctor delivered his implausible but preemptive opinion that the deceased had died of natural causes, Capitan Robert Berry, commander of the Arsenal Precinct, closed the case and signed the report. Permission to bury the dead was granted.\n\nThe next steps were routine. During the afternoon, someone – most likely Alan Ronay, who describes himself at the conclusion of his deposition as being busy with the funeral arrangements – called a funeral home, Pompes Funebres Bigot at 8 Rue du Cloitre Notre-Dame. The director, Michel Gangernepain, made out the death certificate, and an undertaker was dispatched to the apartment. He cleansed the body, placing it in dry ice to prevent decomposition. It was then placed in an expensive oak casket lined with canvas. Bill Siddons saw the closed coffin when he arrived the following Tuesday. (It was the fact that Siddons did not see the corpse that gave rise to the rumors that the casket was empty and Jim was living happily in Africa, free of the burdens of fame.) Courson went, most likely with Ronay, to Pere Lachaise Cemetery – which Jim had visited recently to view the graves of the great – where she bought a double plot (one body laid atop another) for a moderate sum. No other kind of grave was available. The price of a funeral was controlled in those days by the government. The total cost, including four pallbearers and a hearse, was only 4,600 francs, about $830.\n\nThe funeral was held on Wednesday afternoon. No family members were invited, nor were any clergy involved. Those present were Pamela Courson, Alan Ronay, Agenes Varda, Bill Siddons, and Robin Wertle – a young Canadian woman who had acted as Jim and Pam’s secretary in Paris. They read some verses and threw flowers on the coffin when it was lowered five meters into the earth.\n\nThat same day Courson filed the death certificate at the office of the American Consul. The following day she and Siddons flew back to Los Angeles. Only then was the public notified of Morrison’s death in a carefully contrived statement designed to quell suspicion.\n\nOn April 25, 1974, Pamela Courson, age 27, was found dead in her Hollywood apartment of a heroin overdose, shortly after receiving $20,000 in royalties as Jim Morrison’s sole heir. She had celebrated by buying herself a yellow Volkswagen convertible, a monogrammed mink scarf and an ounce of China White.\n\nThe testimony at the inquest and the statements – public and private – issued subsequently by Pamela Courson and Bill Siddons combine to create the impression that Jim Morrison died of a grave illness whose symptoms he stubbornly ignored. Yet when the basis for this opinion is sought, it all turns on the word of one drug addicted woman with a notorious penchant for what is politely described as “fantasy.”\n\nJim Morrison had no history of either heart disease or asthma before he left for Europe. He had done a lot of drinking and tried a lot of drugs, but he had never been seriously ill nor had he exhibited any symptoms to anybody else, save for a heavy cough, doubtlessly aggravated by dragging deeply on three packs of cigarettes a day.\n\nHe had punctured a lung, however, early in March in a fall from the second floor of a Hollywood hotel. This is a self healing injury from which he should have long since recovered. Even if he did vomit blood on his last night (note, by the way, how the violent hemorrhaging of the inquest shrinks to “a little blood” in the story that’s quoted by Hopkins), the most likely explanation is that, like many drinkers, he had developed an ulcer that stated bleeding when he started vomiting. He could have been nauseated because of something he ate for supper – or from snorting heroin.\n\nEven a tiny amount of heroin can produce nausea in a nonuser, as Bill Siddons related when he returned from Morrison’s funeral. He told the surviving members of the band, \"Once, while alone in the living room (of Morrison's apartment), I opened a carved box on the coffee table and found white powder in a clear envelope. Pam was in the kitchen, so I decided to try a little and see what it was. It wasn't coke. Soon afterward I became nauseous and felt very sick. It sure was something that I'd never tried before.\"\n\nThe fact that Morrison insisted there was nothing wrong with him and that he did not want to see a doctor that night suggests he knew perfectly well what was wrong with him – and that it was not disease, but dope. His suggestion that Courson go to sleep while he remained in the bathroom as well as the smile reported to have been on his face in the Hopkins biography, are further evidence that heroin was the cause of his death. People who die of myocardial infarction, which produces pain in the heart, do not die smiling.\n\nLikewise, the behavior of Pam and her friends in concealing from French authorities the real identity of James Douglas Morison suggests that they had a reason to fear the effects of such a disclosure. Clearly, if the police had know that the young man they had found dead at 17 Rue Beautreillis was an internationally famous American rock star, they would have examined his death carefully and , suspecting it was due to drugs, ordered a post-mortem. If the autopsy had demonstrated the presence of heroin in his body, the investigation would have broadened to include Courson and her acquaintances. The police might have found her stash or they might have nailed her suppliers. Undoubtedly, the police had their eye on the Rock n Roll Circus (which closed down shortly there after), where Jim and Pam probably scored some smack on the night of his death. Clearly, it was very important that Pamela Courson deceive the French police and get out of the country as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen Capt Robert Berry, now 76, was quizzed recently about his involvement in the case, he confirmed that the police knew nothing of Jim Morrison's true identity. Asked if he thought that heroin could have been the true cause of death, he considered the question carefully and replied, \"It is highly possible.\" Alan Ronay’s vigorous denial that Jim Morrison ever took drugs shows where the shoe pinched. When Herve Muller sought to question Agnes Varda about her role in ;’affaire Morrison, she threatened to sue him.\n\nThat heroin was the cause of Jim Morrison’s death is confirmed by information that has been available for 4 years but was published only recently in John Densmore’s Riders On the Storm. When the Doors drummer raises the questions of Morrison’s death, he remarks that he has known the truth since 1986, when he was interviewed on PBS by Rodger Steffens, a well known radio personality in Los Angeles. Steffen’s had objected to the widespread fantasy that Jim Morrison is still alive, remarking that he knew the people who had discovered his dead body. They were pop star Marianne Faithful (who know denies ever having had any contact with Jim Morrison) and Jean DeBreteuil, the playboy son of a French count who until his demise owned most of the French newspapers in North Africa.\n\nAccording to Steffens, on the night of Jim Morrison’s death, Pam had called DeBreteuil, who was one of her lovers (Jim and Pamela had an “open” relationship), and told him, “Jim is in the bathroom. The door is locked. I can’t get him out. Will you come over immediately?” DeBreteuil and Faithful arrived shortly thereafter and managed to open the door. When they caught sight of Morrison stretched out dead in the tub, they went into shock. Both were heroin addicts and in Jim’s death, they foresaw their own. They were still agitated two days later when they recounted the story to Steffens and his wife of that time, Cynthia Cottle, a Vietnam War correspondent.\n\nPrompted by this revelation, I got in touch with Steffens and Cottle intent on putting the anecdote in context. Steffens told me that in 1971 he and his wife were living in Marrakech, where they had become aquatinted with DeBreteuil through his widowed mother.\n\nJean had cut into the most closely guarded celebrity circles by handing out costly drugs as if they were party favors. He imported whole kilos of the finest Moroccan hashish via diplomatic pouch and had become a boot and shoot junkie – which was the bond that attached Pam to him. He had reached the apogee of his career as a superfan when he got tight with the Rolling Stones while working as a production consultant on a French TV show about the band.\n\nJean was staying at Keith Richard’s flat in London when he fell in with Marianne Faithfull. The one time pop star was so washed up by this point that she was virtually on the street. Naturally, she took up with elegant young, Jean, who was soon to inherit his deceased father’s title and well endowed with the medicine for all her ills. On their first day together they bought a Bentley –and totaled it that night. Then they decided to get off the scene by shifting to Paris.\n\nThey had only just reached the city when they received Pam’s desperate call. They described the scene in the bathroom with the floor littered with whiskey bottles.\n\nThat heroin was the cause of death is further substantiated by Danny Sugerman’s account in Wonderland Avenue of a night spent snorting Brown Sugar (Mexican heroin) with Pamela after her return to Los Angeles. She is quoted as saying, “I killed him. It was my dope…He found out I was doing dope, and of course, you know Jim, he just had to try it. And I gave it to him! He’d never done it before and I gave it to him. Then she said he didn’t feel well….I should have gone and checked on him, but I nodded out…When I woke up at dawn…I went into the bathroom and there he was in the tub…He was smiling…and I thought he was putting me on.”\n\nClearly, DeBreteuil and Faithful could not possibly have summoned the police. The scandal of two junkies – one bearing an aristocratic name, the other an international pop star – discovered at the site of another star’s death of a drug overdose who have immediately enveloped them. They decided instead to flee the apartment and get out of the country fast.\n\nThe next day they flew to Tangier, and on Monday night, so stoned that they were weaving back and forth, they told their story to the Steffenses. Steffens recalls Marianne Faithful dropped her lit cigarette on her skirt three times and each time he had to beat out the fire as she stared at him with a startled expression that said, “Why is this man hitting me?” (The lesson of Morrison’s death was wasted on Jean; a year later in Tangier, he, too died of an overdose.)\n\nClearly the gentlemanly Jean could not have left Pamela Courson in the lurch that morning on Rue de Beautreillis. He and she must have racked their addled brains to come up with a convincing story. He and she must have agreed to blame everything on Jim’s health, the next task would be summoning the authorities. Jean would want to get clear away of any traces of drink and drugs, to hide her stash and get in touch with somebody respectable like Varda and Ronay, who could aid her in her forthcoming confrontation with police – a frightening prospect. It’s a safe bet that a lot of panicky work and worry went on that morning before anyone dialed 18, the emergency number, and reported a man having trouble breathing.\n\nWhen Jean and Marianne left the Morrison flat, they must have gone straight to their connection and babbled out the story of Jim’s death. Just before closing time at La Bulle, the hip new disco on Montaigne St. Genevieve, where deejay Camerson Watson was watching his last customers fade from the floor, two respectably dressed dope dealers walked up to his booth and one of them thrust his face into the observation window to confide, “Jim Morrison just snuffed it.”\n\nWatson switched on his P.A. mike and announced to the virtually empty club, “Jim Morrison est mort!”\n\nEND."
