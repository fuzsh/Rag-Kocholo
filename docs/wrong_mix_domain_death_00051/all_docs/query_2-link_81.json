The occupant of the cottage, which had moldering shake shingles and draft-prone casement windows, was a Canadian painter, poet, and folksinger named Joni Mitchell. The British pop star, sporting a wisp of a goatee and a thick Manchester brogue, was Graham Nash, founding member of the Hollies. The refugees were Stephen Stills, late of the Buffalo Springfield, writer and singer of \"For What It's Worth,\" who had three years before auditioned for the Monkees and, having failed, recommended his friend, a folkie named Peter Torkelson; and David Crosby, late of the Byrds and \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" possessed of a Buffalo Bill mustache, an immaculate harmony voice, and piercing eyes that Mitchell, with typical literary\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\nflourish, likened to star sapphires. (Crosby produced Mitchell's debut album, Song to a Seagull.) So it was that Nash, Stills, and Crosby sat in Mitchell's living room on Lookout Mountain, in the heart of Laurel Canyon, in the epicenter of L.A.'s nascent rock music industry, and for the first time, began to sing together. It is a measure of Laurel Canyon's mythmaking powers that this particular watershed may have actually occurred not at Mitchell's cottage—though that's the way Nash and plenty of others remember it—but a mile away in the living room of Cass Elliot of the Mamas and the Papas, who along with Mitchell briefly co-reigned as unofficial queen of the canyon, one an inscrutable poet-genius, the other a bosomy, meddling mother figure. What is certain is that within the year, Nash, Stills, and Crosby apotheosized into Crosby, Stills & Nash, the third group with Laurel Canyon roots within as many years—after the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield—to score a knockout with their first record. Nash moved into Mitchell's cottage on Lookout, there to write his ode to countercultural domestic bliss, \"Our House.\" Mitchell, in turn, wrote and recorded \"Ladies of the Canyon,\" her paean to the strange bohemian netherland where she and Nash nurtured their affair and where it would soon become evident that some of the twentieth century's most talented and enterprising young men and women had gathered at just the right moment. Laurel Canyon had been filling up with musicians from Los Angeles, New York, and London since the mid-1960s: Mitchell was a transplant from New York via Saskatoon; Carole King had recently decamped to a place on Appian Way; so had Nico, the Teutonic waif from Andy Warhol's Factory. Up the street from Mitchell's place were John Phillips, Michelle Phillips, and Denny Doherty of the Mamas and the Papas, who, until they moved\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nwest and recorded \"California Dreamin'\" and \"Monday, Monday,\" had busked around as semi-obscure folksingers. British bands touring the States made it a point to stop by Laurel Canyon for a party or two—Beatles, Stones, Animals, Yardbirds, and the rest. Some never left—the British blues legend John Mayall bought a house just over the ridge from Mitchell's place. It was Brigadoon meets the Brill Building, and the repercussions thirty-odd years later continue to pour from radios, iPods, and concert stages around the world. During Laurel Canyon's golden era, the musicians who lived and worked there scored dozens of landmark hits, from \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" to \"California Dreamin'\" to \"My Opening Farewell\" to \"It's Too Late,\" while selling tens of millions of records and resetting the thermostat of pop culture worldwide. Besides Mitchell, Crosby, Stills, King, Mayall, and the Mamas and the Papas, canyonites permanent and transient included Frank Zappa, Jackson Browne, Chris Hillman and Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, Glenn Frey and Don Henley of the Eagles, Love's Arthur Lee, the songwriter Jimmy Webb, Judy Collins, Nick St. Nicholas of Steppenwolf, Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees, Mark Volman of the Turtles, and John Densmore and Robby Krieger of the Doors. The musicians flocking to the canyon—at night, caterwauling coyotes and hooting owls made you marvel that you were only five minutes from the noise and neon of the Sunset Strip— constituted an unprecedented breed of incipient celebrity: the rocker-hippie, as much a work in progress as the music they made. As a group, they were nominally countercultural, favoring long hair and thrift-shop apparel, but possessed of ambition as blinding as any junior investment banker in a Brooks Brothers suit. Thanks to this incredible influx of talent, Laurel Canyon and, with it, Los Angeles wrested from New York and London\n\nxiv\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe bragging rights of musical capital of the world and held them through the 1970s. The canyon's musicians took traditional folk, British rock, and savvy pop American songcraft and melded them into a sound that triumphed as thoroughly as the songs of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. All of this happened without the ocean of hype that launched San Francisco's great paisley coming-out party during 1967 s fabled Summer of Love. Although Haight-Ashbury generated some indelible records, it never came close to coalescing into the commercial and cultural juggernaut spearheaded in Laurel Canyon and Los Angeles. \"I felt I had reached Nirvana,\" Graham Nash told me. \"I was in love with Joni, we were living together in Laurel Canyon. I had this new relationship with David and Stephen, and it was producing music that was thrilling me to death. To be part of this boiling pot of music, twelve hours a day, every day? It was an amazing scene.\" Recalled Jackson Browne, who lived at the time in the laundry room of the music impresario Billy James's Laurel Canyon home, \"There was amazing tribal life. There were houses supported by record companies, groups living with an account at the health food store.\" R o n Stone, Mitchell's former manager, has a clear memory of driving his Alfa Romeo up Laurel Canyon Boulevard and hearing song after song from Sgt. Pepper wafting down from the cabins and bungalows all the way home. \"It was a magical time,\" he says. Laurel Canyon has always attracted blithe free-spirited celebrities—over the years Mary Astor, Tom Mix, Natalie Wood, Orson Welles, and David Niven had lived there—but it never acquired the cachet of Beverly Hills, perhaps because its famous tended to cohabit with infamy. Across the street from Mix's house—a log cabin with a bowling alley in the basement later to be occupied by Frank Zappa—was a large estate, supposedly connected to the Mix cabin via underground tunnel, which\n\nPREFACE\n\nxv\n\nlater burned under the requisite mysterious circumstances. A three-room cabin on Ridpath Drive—L.A. vice dubbed it \"the reefer ranch\"—provided a suitably scuzzy mise-en-scène for Robert Mitchum's 1948 marijuana bust. While the rest of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley boomed in the 1950s, Laurel Canyon seemed to exist out of time, so much so that by the 1960s its Hansel and Gretel cottages and fraying \"mansions\" had become embarrassing vestiges of a discredited era, when one could in perfect seriousness name a real estate development Bungalow Land—a subdivision actually built in the canyon in the early 1900s—and advertise its bigoted ownership covenant right on the billboard. Or, as on the west side of the city by the Pacific, not far from where Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, and other literary refugees fleeing the Nazis fetched up in the 1930s, conjure a replica of Venice, Italy, complete with \"canals\" now clotted with muck. But just when it seemed the giddy futurism of the New Frontier would eclipse it completely, Laurel Canyon—along with Rush Street in Chicago, Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, and New York's Greenwich Village—came under siege from young, footloose, self-styled bohemians attracted by cheap rents and the down-market esprit of living among similarly broke brethren. Pointedly rejecting the tired haunts of the Beats like San Francisco's North Beach, the vanguard of the baby boomers, as they'd been dubbed, deliberately distanced themselves from those infrequent outcroppings of hipness to which their parents' generation could lay claim. Not even Lenny Bruce, denizen of \"sick\" humor and the fading '50s nightclub scene, soon to OD amid gathering irrelevance in a house above the Sunset Strip, was cool enough for their room. Youth would be served, on their terms—and on their turf. (Fittingly, Ciro's, the club on the Strip where Bruce played in his declining years, would become\n\nxvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe launching pad for the Byrds.) Of the incredible bounty of rock-and-roll bands soon to emerge in L.A., only the Doors hailed from the former beatnik enclave Venice, and then mostly because the band's organist, Ray Manzarek, happened to live there. It was a time of joyous generational fraternization in Laurel Canyon, marked by hijinks like the morning everyone conspired to open their windows and drop the needle on \"Let It B e \" at precisely the same moment. Or the night that the singer Barry McGuire, riding high on his hit \"Eve of Destruction,\" set up a bank of enormous speakers at the Mamas and the Papas' house on Lookout Mountain, seized the microphone, and bellowed: \"This is God speaking. I have a message for you.\" At the former Tom Mix cabin a few doors down from Mitchell's house, Zappa hosted a nonstop salon—jam session that raged for the four months he actually lived there before he and his wife, Gail, were driven to saner reaches of the canyon. Laurel Canyon loves its legends, and subsequent generations of residents have burnished them so adoringly that the truth sometimes seems almost beside the point. The estate across from the Mix/Zappa compound was known then, now, and probably forever as the \"Houdini house,\" although it's almost certain Houdini never lived there. Tiburcio Vasquez, the \"Mexican Robin Hood\" who went on an extended crime spree during California's first decades of statehood, was said to stash his swag in the caves pockmarking the Mix property. Finally and inevitably, there is Jim Morrison, who among other vagaries held little truck with fixed addresses and so only briefly lived in a house behind the Canyon Country Store, though it must be remembered that alleged Morrison domiciles are to Los Angeles what bars that Hemingway drank in are to Key West. The Morrison house was near a mews that was the probable inspiration for the Doors' \"Love Street,\" \"where the creatures meet\"—the\n\nPREFACE\n\nxvll\n\ncreatures being hippie canyonites Morrison glimpsed from his window as they sloughed up the steps to the Canyon Store. (During the early 1990s, the graffito MR. MOJO RISIN' graced the front of the derelict property in wobbly black spray paint; a subsequent owner removed the slogan but installed a three-story totem pole within the house that depicted carved likenesses of Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, andjanis Joplin.) Laurel Canyon's salad days didn't last, of course. As the '60s bled into the '70s, a series of profound psychic earthquakes shook the flowers out of everyone's hair. At the disastrous Altamont festival, held outside San Francisco in 1969, Hells Angels hired as security went berserk and attacked the audience, stabbing to death Meredith Hunter, a young black man carrying a gun in front of the stage while the Rolling Stones played \"Under My Thumb.\" Coming three months after the youth Utopia of the Woodstock festival, Altamont was brutal evidence that the peace-and-love generation could just as easily serve up something noxious. Chris Hillman, a founding member of the Byrds who lived in Laurel Canyon during the '60s, opened Altamont with his band the Flying Burrito Brothers. \"It was like entering the depths of hell,\" he told me. \"The level of feeling that day was indescribable.\" Although the Burritos played in brilliant morning sunshine, Altamont, Hillman said, was \"just darkness.\" Meanwhile, as the records sold and the millions piled up across Los Angeles and the canyon, there was a sense that things were, even by the standards of the late 1960s, getting out of hand; there was a frenzied, grasping, fall-of-Rome desperation to the drugging and drinking and wenching on the Strip and in the ever-more-commodious homes where cocaine—traditional refreshment of decadence—was supplanting marijuana and LSD. The turning point came in 1969, when Charles Manson's hippie girls hacked to death Roman Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate,\n\nxviii\n\nPREFACE\n\nand three others in nearby Benedict Canyon. One theory for Manson's motive held that he was sending a message to the house's previous occupant, Terry Melcher, the Beach Boys' producer and son of Doris Day who had enraged Manson for allegedly reneging on a deal to record him. The next day, across Laurel Canyon, you could practically hear bolts snapping into place behind doors that for the past five years had gone unlocked day and night. I've lived in Laurel Canyon since moving to Los Angeles in 1991 and marvel at how little it has changed in all that time. Hazy existentialism, tempered by a work ethic necessary to afford the real estate, is a way of life here—Topanga Canyon after a 12-step program. The 1960s and '70s rock elite are now sparsely represented, most having either moved on years ago or died in harness. John Mayall, my former neighbor on Grandview Drive, finally packed it in for the San Fernando Valley suburb of Woodland Hills in 1996, but not before recording the Blues from Laurel Canyon album with its signature \"Laurel Canyon Home.\" R o n Stone took over Mitchell's cottage on Lookout Mountain and lived there for twenty-seven years, raising a family within its hardly expansive walls before reluctantly bailing for larger quarters on the Valley side of the canyon. Celebrities still live here—Ellen DeGeneres, Sally Kellerman, the songwriter Meredith Brooks, the Beatles' recording engineer Geoff Emerick, among them—but they are seldom remarked upon or seen, and when they do turn up at the Canyon Country Store, a '60s throwback decorated with psychedelic art-nouveau exteriors where you can buy bundles of sage incense picked in the canyon, nobody pays them any mind. Laurel Canyon compels because in an age when genuine contemporary experience has become buried under winking Zeitgeist sampling, it neither overindulges its past nor calls much\n\nPREFACE\n\nxix\n\nattention to its present. It simply is. The epidemic of trophy houses blighting the ridgelines notwithstanding, the canyon seems pretty much as it was and probably always will be; its ability to have nurtured an incalculable pop-cultural renaissance within its walls in the 1960s and '70s without surrendering its soul to the nostalgia-mongers thirty years later says a lot about its sleepy inertia. Laurel Canyon has what the oenophiles call terroir—the theory that the place where the grapes that make a great wine are grown should be evident with every swallow. In that sense, when you hear \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\" you are hearing Laurel Canyon, vintage 1969. Laurel Canyon has great terroir. \"Laurel Canyon is a consciousness, rather than a physical place,\" Michael Des Barres, the British singer and actor who lived in the canyon in the 1970s, told me. \"Like the Chateau Marmont or Carnaby Street, [it] transcends geographies.\" So this book is not about pining for the days when a thousand points of incense dotted the evening sky while a dulcimer's melody wafted on the breeze—though that's not far from what the canyon was like on a good night in 1967. This is the story of how an indelible swath of popular culture was created in a shockingly short time, and how the anomaly of a canyon in the middle of one of America s most unsparing urban landscapes played a part. It's also about serendipity spun into solid gold, of writing a song on a redwood deck on Monday, recording it on Saturday, and having it hit the top of the charts six weeks later and then enter pop culture's permanent collection. It's what it was like to idolize the Beatles and then suddenly find yourself sharing a joint with them backstage. And what it was like, finally and helplessly, to watch it slip away. Nothing remotely approaching the events described here has since come to pass in Laurel Canyon and probably never will again. And that's what makes it all the more essential to understand how a place and\n\nXX\n\nPREFACE\n\ntime and a handful of history's most willful and self-absorbed young adults made such beautiful music together. A note about structure: The events covered in this book occur between 1964 and 1981, but it quickly became apparent to me that it would be impossible to place them in their proper context within a rigidly chronological format. Also, I wanted this book to bear some semblance to the shambling nature of the canyon itself. Life in Laurel Canyon, then and now, is seldom tidy or linear, and so the implications of an anecdote taking place in 1969 sometimes don't fully reveal themselves until 1979. For those reasons, although the text is nominally divided into halves covering the 1960s and the 1970s, it is sometimes necessary to leap ahead in time in order not to lose a resonance. \"Going with the flow\" was a watchword of the canyon, in spirit if not in fact, for much of the time covered here. It is my hope that this book respects as much as possible that well-intentioned if now-antiquated ethic.\n\nThe Byrds, circa 1966.

Hillman's folk-bluegrass group, the Hillmen, had recently disbanded after one album and untold gigs around Southern California—they'd played the Harem Lounge, in Lynwood, the night of November 21, 1963. Now the handsome musician had just joined a trio at loose ends after their first record had tanked. The trio—young journeymen singerguitansts with solid folkie credentials—had recorded as the Jet Set and the Beefeaters and had now decided to reconstitute themselves with electric guitars and drums. Hillman ended up on bass, an instrument he'd never played but one that the Hillmen's manager, who also managed the Beefeaters, figured he could quickly master. The Beefeaters added another handsome young man, Michael Clarke, on drums, who had slim experience\n\n4\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nbut, it was agreed, looked the part. Thus did Jim McGuinn (soon to change his name to Roger), Gene Clark, David Crosby, Michael Clarke, and Chris Hillman—shepherded by a resourceful L.A. jazz producer and man-about-town named Jim Dickson—become the Byrds. Hillman couldn't have known it, but by the time he stood on a corner in the heart of Laurel Canyon in 1964, he was about to participate in the creation of a milestone of twentieth-century popular culture. With Hillman and Clarke in the lineup and McGuinn and Crosby playing electric guitars, the Byrds married the drive of rock and roll to the harmonies of folk music, then nearing the peak of its popularity with baby boomers in the persons of Joan Baez, Judy Collins, and Bob Dylan. At the time, folk was also still very much the music of left-leaning middle-agers, whom Dylan would famously scandalize at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival by \"going electric.\" \"There was a folk scene, but it was yet to be a folk scene of the youth—that wasn't Kingston Trio bullshit,\" says Judy Raphael, a musician and writer who worked at the Troubadour and the Ash Grove, L.A.'s premier folk clubs, and attended UCLA's film school with Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, soon to form the Doors. All that was about to change. Crosby and every aspiring Southern California folk musician had logged time at the Troubadour's Monday open-mike Hoot nights, which were instrumental in providing a venue where performances could be honed and collaborations struck. A good showing at the Hoot could raise one's stock in town literally overnight \"The first time anybody heard Linda Ronstadt sing would have been in '64 when she did a solo at the Hoot and everybody was just talking about her the whole next day,\" says Raphael. The Ash Grove, too, was crawling with apple-cheeked folk acolytes in thrall to the music. \"There were all these little Jewish boys sitting around in front thinking they could emulate the latest lick\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n5\n\nby Robert Johnson or Doc Watson. R y Cooder gave guitar lessons there in '63 at age sixteen. It was really a center where a lot of stuff evolved.\" Folk and rock may have made sense as a hybrid musically, but philosophically they could scarcely have been further apart. Though no clear-cut definition exists, folk is generally accepted to comprise music that is populist, lyrically dense, and simple enough to be played by amateurs on whatever instruments are at hand. \"In the strictest sense, it's music that is rarely written for profit,\" Gene Shay, the co-founder of the Philadelphia Folk Festival, said. \"It's the people's music.\" While rock and roll's roots reach deeply into the folk traditions of blues and country, it was from the beginning unabashedly commercial music dependent on, and enhanced immeasurably by, the charisma and dynamism of the musician performing it. Anybody with an Autoharp and a third-grade singing voice can pull off a passable rendition of \"Michael, Row the Boat Ashore\"; it takes Chuck Berry to sing \"Johnny B. Goode.\" In the early 1960s folk began launching stars singing the \"people's music\" in a manner that made the songs inseparable from the singer, as with Elvis Presley's indelible association with \"Hound Dog,\" previously a hit for the blueswoman Big Mama Thornton. Joan Baez and Peter, Paul and Mary sold millions of records and became celebrities o£ a magnitude that eclipsed pop singers like Connie Francis. Singing hand-sewn songs interpreted as allegories for the civil rights, antiwar, and antinuclear movements, they made a deep impression on millions of young baby boomers raised in the stultifying atmosphere of the American 1950s. Making an equal impression on a generation already showing signs of creeping entitlement was the quality of the folk stars' celebrity, the deference they were shown, and the fact that they, too, were young and sexual. No one could have known it then, but the folk stars of the early 1960s were the first rock stars.\n\n6\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nStill, folk had yet to evolve into anything as irresistible and visceral as rock and roll. The Beatles' earliest records, with their Everly Brothers-style harmonies and unapologetic backbeat, hinted at the possibilities—McGuinn and Clark had played Beatles songs in their folk sets, sometimes to the derision of purist coffeehouse audiences. In San Francisco, the Beau Brummels were playing Beatles-influenced rock with intricate folk-style vocal harmonies a year before the Byrds formed. But no one had achieved unambiguous commerical success marrying folk and rock until the Byrds recorded a version of an unreleased Dylan song written in herky-jerky two-four time, which McGuinn slowed to the steady-rolling four-four moderato of rock and roll. Released on April 12, 1965, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\"— McGuinn's ringing twelve-string electric guitar sounding the refrain followed by his and Crosby's close-spaced, ethereal harmonies—quickly caught fire and shot all the way to No. 1 on the Billboard charts, becoming a worldwide smash. By spanning the divide between rock and roll and folk music, the Byrds created a hybrid—folk rock—that gentrifled American-made rock and roll while putting a commercial sheen on folk only hinted at by Baez, Dylan, and Collins. Dylan would trump the Byrds that summer with \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" a noisy six-minute masterpiece that melded elements of folk, pop, and rock while somehow summing up an entire generation's inchoate longings and paranoia; but before Dylan's breakthrough the Beatles loomed largest in the aspirations of L.A.'s nascent folk rockers. \"I remember the day David Crosby came over with Chris Hillman and knocked on my door when I lived near the Troubadour,\" says Raphael. \"They used to come over to tune up. And [Crosby] turned my radio from FM to AM, to those popmusic stations, which was sacrilege to me. AM had been Frankie Valli and that bullshit, and all of a sudden because of the Beatles\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n7\n\nit was very, very important, because now all the guys wanted to grow their hair and be pop stars. [Crosby] said: 'Do you mind if I change the station to AM?' And they started playing along. I remember that very distinctly as a turning point. They were listening to all that stuff.\" Folk rock would prove more popular and remunerative than either genre had separately, and it presaged the truly humongous folk-country-rock \"L.A. Sound,\" perfected by Crosby, Stills & Nash, the Eagles, Jackson Browne, America, Linda Ronstadt, and others, which would dominate from the late 1960s to the late '70s and utterly transform the record industry. But it all started in 1965 with the Byrds. For Hillman and his bandmates, as well as for the eucalyptus-scented Los Angeles canyon where Hillman would soon reside, life would never be the same. Hillman was raised in northern San Diego County, a largely rural area that had yet to be besieged by veterans perfecting the California dream amid the cosseting climate in subdivisions financed by the G.I. Bill. It was an environment one might expect to foster in a shy young man a consuming passion for arcane country music, less so the primordial rock and roll of L.A.'s chaotic Specialty Records, home of Little Richard. But for the young Chris Hillman, it was everything he could want in the way of excitement. He was captivated by the gritty subgenre of country music associated with Bakersfield, a sunbaked city in California's vast Central Valley. Compared with the mournfully embroidered melodies of Nashville, Bakersfield country was looser, harder-driving, and more apt to swing—perfect for the headlong restlessness of postwar Southern California and, later, as a foundation for the sort of music Hillman would make with and without the Byrds. Bakersfield proponents like Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, and Spade Cooley, a singer and fiddler from Pack Saddle Creek, Oklahoma, who led a ten-piece band partial to\n\n8\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nsnazzy matching cowboy outfits, were huge stars in Southern California when Hillman was growing up. Cooley hosted his own TV show, The Hoffman Hayride, which at its peak drew 75 percent of the television viewers in Los Angeles. Hillman couldn't get enough of it \"I would dial in the Spade Cooley live TV show every Saturday night from Los Angeles,\" he says. \"Then I'd watch Cliffie Stone's Hometown Jamboree, then the Johnny Otis show, which was R & B . I'm, like, a thirteen-year-old kid and my father was going, 'What's wrong with you?' \" Hillman added folk music to his obsessions when his sister returned from college with an armload of albums and his mother drove to Tijuana and bought him a ten-dollar guitar, which he assiduously taught himself to play. Next came the mandolin, whose reedy imprecations he picked out from Flatt and Scruggs records. In 1961 Hillman joined a high-school bluegrass band with the Mighty Wind-ish name Scottsville Squirrel Barkers; his next band, the Golden Gate Boys, acknowledged the young mandolin player's burgeoning chops and commanding good looks by renaming themselves the Hillmen. It was not the sort of resume that would seem to prefigure worldwide stardom, but Hillman joined the Byrds at what in hindsight was precisely the right moment. Beatlemama, arriving just three months after Kennedy's assassination, had acted like a tonic on the American psyche. \"I feel the Beatles actually healed us,\" Hillman says. \"It was almost God-sent that they came over.\" The Beatles' phenomenal success served as a goad and role model to prospective male American musicians Crosby always carbon-dated the turning point in the Byrds' folk-to-rock-androll conversion to the night he, Clark, and McGuinn saw A Hard Day's Night together. \"I can remember coming out of that movie so jazzed that I was swinging around stop sign poles at\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n9\n\narm's length,\" Crosby recalled. \"[The Beatles] were cool and we said: 'Yeah, that's it. We have to be a band.' \" Like so many other young men of their generation, the Byrds selected their Rickenbacker and Gretsch guitars and Ludwig drums in emulation of John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Their Beatlesque matching suits were, according to Hillman, another matter. \"We hated them. I think we wore the suits once, when we worked Ciro's on the Strip the first time. We left them in the dressing room on purpose.\" The Beatles represented the equivalent of a clean sheet of paper that the largest generation in American history suddenly had license to fill any way it chose. \"I felt that there were no boundaries, no rules,\" says Hillman. \"Especially in the music business, which was then a tiny cottage industry. Nothing like it is today. The guys running the companies were music guys, and we didn't have these conglomerate corporate monsters eating up everything. Then it was new, uncharted territory. It was a special time, and for that moment we held the pulse.\" Every incipient cultural movement needs its golden nexus. The New Yorker crowd of the 1930s had the Algonquin Hotel (and, when in Hollywood, the Garden of Allah at the mouth of Laurel Canyon on the Sunset Strip). So it was in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s that Laurel Canyon, by unconscious lottery of the hip, became the place where every heads-up young musician just knew he had to live. \"Laurel Canyon was sort of the mecca,\" says Hillman. \"From '63-'64 up until '69—'70, it was quite the place to be.\" Billy James, a pioneering artist manager and music publisher who championed some of the brightest lights on the emerging L.A. scene, already lived at 8504 Ridpath Drive, not far from Hillman's FOR RENT sign. \"It's all happened within the last year or so,\" James told Jerry Hopkins, Rolling Stone's first Los Angeles correspondent, in 1968. \"If creative\n\n10\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nartists need to live apart from the community at large, they also have a desire to live among their own kind, and so an artistic community develops.\" Those selfsame creative artists may also have had an equally consuming desire to live where the rent was dirt cheap. Which is how Hillman found himself in Laurel Canyon looking for a place. It didn't take him long to find one, and, in the canyon's emerging mythos of enchanted serendipity one presented itself as if by magic. \"This guy drives up and he says, 'You looking for a place to rent?' \" Hillman recalls. \"I said yeah, and he said, 'Well, follow me up.' It was this young guy who was a dentist. It was his parents' house, a beautiful old wood house down a dirt road—and he lived on the top, and he was renting out the bottom part. I just went, 'Wow, perfect.' The guy ended up being my dentist for a while.\" The house was at the top of Magnolia Lane at the summit of the Kirkwood Bowl, a box canyon cut into the west flank of Laurel Canyon. Like many of the roads in the Kirkwood Bowl and on Lookout Mountain, another canyon within the canyon a half mile to the north, Magnolia Lane had been hacked out of the granite by real estate speculators without regard to guardrails or turning clearances. Then as now, the narrow roadways with their incredible pitch dictate that two cars cannot pass without one of them backing up. Protracted horn-blowing standoffs are common, and the unprotected shoulders promise a leisurely plunge, usually through the roof of an unsuspecting house below. There is, of course, an upside to these inconveniences: Hillman s house had a view that stretched from downtown Los Angeles all the way to the Pacific. \"It was wonderful up there,\" Hillman says. \"It was the top of the world, a beautiful, beautiful place. I had the best place in the canyon.\" Not to mention that Laurel Canyon's longtime status as a haven for freethinkers could lead to intriguing\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n11\n\nneighbors. \"Right above me was this old Spanish Mediterranean sort of house and [the sculptor] Ed Kienholz lived there,\" Hillman says. \"You'd hear him up there soldering and sawing.\" The canyon was meanwhile being colonized by Hillman's bandmates and L.A. contemporaries. McGuinn moved in. Crosby, a headstrong twenty-two-year-old from Santa Barbara with a matchless tenor harmony voice who was already feuding with McGuinn over leadership of the Byrds, was in transient residence all over the canyon before settling in Beverly Glen ten miles west. \"At the end of '64, early '65, the folk-rock explosion, that's when the Byrds took their first money and a lot of them moved up to Laurel Canyon,\" says Kim Fowley, an early L.A. rock producer and entrepreneur. \"Everybody else in that folk-rock community decided they'd move up there, too, because you could smoke dope and get laid and be an asshole with your Porsche convertible out of the prying eyes of the Man.\" The proximity of so many of L.A.'s emerging rock elite had predictable collateral consequences. John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas, from his perch on Lookout Mountain, would soon famously pen the lyric \"young girls are coming to the canyon.\" This would turn out to be a colossal understatement. As Fowley recalls: \"All these chicks would hitchhike up to the Canyon Store from the Strip, girls from Kansas who'd heard about Laurel Canyon: 'Hi! Folk-rock musicians! I'll clean your house and fuck you and I'm a vegetarian and I can make you macrobiotic stuff as you're shooting heroin.' So those of us who didn't live in Laurel Canyon, we'd go up and grab them and say: 'These guys aren't going to have sex with you, because you're not from New York, so come fuck us.' \" The canyon's gathering folk-rock firmament made an impression on Pamela Des Barres, née Miller, then a seventeen-year-\n\n12\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nold protogroupie who ran with a gang of like-minded young women that Frank Zappa would dub the Girls Together Outrageously, or GTOs. Pamela frequently hitchhiked over Laurel Canyon Boulevard to Hollywood from her home in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Reseda. \"It was perfect—I used to call it God's golden backyard,\" she says, \"just knowing that the people you thought were cool lived up there. The Byrds were my favorite band and they lived there, so that was it for me. It wasn't that hard to find rock-star addresses back then. I went to every single one of their houses and scoped them out.\" As with many of the young women who lived in the Valley, Pamela's excursions engendered an awakening to cultural possibilities previously unimaginable. \"They went over Laurel Canyon, which was the yellow brick motherfuckm' road into Oz,\" says Michael Des Barres, at the time a young British actor—he appeared in To Sir, With Love—later to become an L.A.-based rock singer whom Pamela would marry. \"It was almost like a conduit, a magical bridge from that world and the era of the beehive haircut into Zappa and the revolution of the streets. If it was a film, you would track it from the hot tarmac of Reseda into the luxurious foliage and feathers and flowers of Sunset Boulevard.\" Pamela developed an obsessive crush on Hillman after she'd seen the Byrds perform at Ciro's, a 1930s-era Sunset Strip nightclub gamely trying to reinvent itself as a rock-and-roll parlor. \"Chris Hillman was my god, my hero, my first true love,\" she says. \"He lived at 5424 Magnolia, at the top of Kirkwood. I used to go there even when he was on the road and just hang out. He had a hammock on the porch, so when he was on the road, I would sleep there at night. I was psycho—I used to sing that song, 'On the Street Where You Live,' when I was up there. I thought, How am I going to get in to meet him? I'd seen him\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n13\n\naround; I'd met him on the Strip. So I did two different things: Once my Dad gave me a big bag of grapes he brought from Mexico and I was going to give them to Chris but he wasn't home and I remember tripping down his dirt driveway and the grapes spilling and slipping and sliding and oh, my God, it was a nightmare. The next time I got to know his next-door neighbor, Mrs. Matzo, this old, old lady. And her cat had kittens and I thought, Well, I'll bring him a kitten. And that time he was home. But he couldn't accept a kitten. Actually, we finally got together. But I would just do anything to be up there, and for that reason alone Laurel Canyon became my mecca.\" Not to mention that \"all my other favorite bands lived there, too.\" Hillman saw less and less of the Magnolia house as the Byrds were buffeted by the first disorienting blasts of fame. Mr. Tambourine Man was released in June 1965 just as its titular single hit No. 1 ; barely six months passed before the band's second seminal folk-rock No. 1—a shimmering version of Pete Seeger's \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" Two years later the band would record Hillman and McGuinn's withering \"So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star,\" but for now the fledgling Byrds were at a loss as to how to go about acting like one. \"The Byrds weren't a rock band,\" Hillman says. \"We didn't know anything from that stuff. We didn't even know how you were supposed to be onstage. I mean, rock-and-roll guys were like show guys, and we had come out of folk music. I was a bluegrass mandolin player, and m bluegrass you've gotta concentrate so much you don't crack a smile and dance around, it's too darned hard to play the music. I was scared to death with the Byrds. I was a little guy in the back row playing the bass.\" Crosby recalled \"standing in front of a mirror with my new Gretsch guitar . . . trying to figure out how to stand up and play. Folkies didn't do that. We were used to sitting on high stools. There I\n\n14\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nwas, alone in front of the mirror, muttering to myself: 'Let's see . . . How do you . . . like this?' Or: 'No, maybe I need to lengthen the strap a little bit. . Along with sudden fame came sudden, insane money. Crosby had been living in Dickson's basement in Laurel Canyon when \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" hit; now he owned a green Porsche. Hillman bought a Triumph Bonneville motorcycle, then a Porsche of his own. As the band's chief songwriter, Clark was pulling in tremendous sums from publishing royalties and trumped them all with a Ferrari. \"It was like winning a big lottery,\" he recalled. \"We were one of the first American groups to really make money 'Mr. Tambourine Man' was a hit in twenty-six countries, something like that. The first time we got mobbed by girls screaming at a c o n c e r t . . . it registered that we actually had pulled it off, that everybody loved us, we were bigger than any of us expected, and we were out there with the Beatles.\" The Byrds' first tours were conducted under logistics that now seem impossibly quaint. \"That Tom Hanks movie—That ThmgYou Do!—that captures the experience,\" Hillman says. \"It is so like the way we were out on the road in '65, those kind of package shows. We were out with Bo Diddley, Paul Revere and the Raiders.\" For the first tour, the band invited along a freeform dance troupe led by Vito Paulekas and Carl Franzoni, Los Angeles avant-gardists possessed, for the times, of fearsomely unorthodox dress and coiffure. Franzoni lived in a commune occupying the log cabin at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Lookout Mountain soon to be taken over by Frank Zappa. The Paulekas-Franzoni dancers had by 1965 become the de rigueur, buzz-confirming accoutrement at rock clubs on the Sunset Strip, and Dickson made sure they were in the audience at the Byrds' early shows at Ciro's. Paulekas, an accomplished sculptor and iconoclast, taught\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n15\n\nan hourlong dance class at his studio. The night before the Byrds' first gig at Ciro's, the band played a dance that Vito organized in a church on Melrose Avenue. \"The Byrds' management announced at the dance that they had secured Ciro's the next night,\" says Franzoni, thus ensuring a mob of teenagers outside the club trying to get in. Not that there was any room left inside. \"Every young movie star you could think of was there, because the Byrds were involved with Jane Fonda and her group of people, so the word was out and they had a packed house.\" Fifteen minutes before the band was to go on, Franzoni, dismayed by the crowd's lethargy, shambled onto the empty dance floor and began writhing to the canned discotheque music playing over the house PA. \"I'm out there by myself for five minutes. Then Vito and his wife came out, and several other people. It wasn't a full dance floor, but we broke the nut, that it was going to be a dance. Fifteen minutes later the band comes up and from then on it was dance, dance, dance in Hollywood.\" It was a signal moment on the Sunset Strip and, by extension, in the culture. Prior to the Byrds' opening night at Ciro's, dancing m L.A.'s clubs tended to be accompanied by Motown hits spun by bored DJs or live R&B bands. \"Once the Byrds were invited to Ciro's, the flood hit,\" says Franzoni. \"All the bands started showing up on the Sunset Strip.\" And playing for audiences whose dancing, thanks to Vito, was as much a performance as the band's. \"What we did, we showed them a dance that came out of Vito s classes. We showed them a way to dance they'd never seen before.\" \"Carl and all those guys were way ahead of everybody on hippiedom fashion,\" Hillman says. \"Carl used to wear tights that looked like a bumblebee, yellow and black. Carl and another dancer named Beatle Bob—these are like rock-and-roll Damon Runyon names—a couple of girls and some other guy, they'd all\n\n16\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nget out and dance while we played. So you can imagine when we went out on the road in the summer of '65 with those guys, playing in Iowa, it was pretty interesting. Here we are playing these weird places m the Midwest—little dance halls and stuff— and they'd be dancing out there, and sometimes some of those farm boys would get in there and get very upset,\" says Franzoni; \"They were used to lining up and doing that line dance—and here come these crazy people doing this crazy dance. So they would circle us and sometimes there'd be a punch in there.\" Forgetting for the moment the calculation of exporting the Sunset Strip experience to the provinces—\"It was like a little pre-Magical Mystery Tour\" Hillman says—the Byrds themselves were earnestly agog at their sudden change of fortune. \"Drugs were not dictating. That negative lifestyle wasn't encompassing and smothering everybody. Other than Crosby—who was probably meddling in areas that were going to be his future downfall—the rest of us weren't. Occasionally we'd have a drink or a smoke or something, and that was it. What came along later, the cocaine and all the other garbage, was the downfall for everybody.\" Laurel Canyon, meanwhile, was still in its idyllic phase, as for the moment, the nascent peace-and-love aesthetic obscured the mercantile distractions beginning to visit more and more of its inhabitants. The canyon's rugged granite walls and cool, quiet night air sweetened with jasmine and acacia blossoms—only five minutes from the mammon of the Sunset Strip—provided a reassuring physical and psychological barrier for musicians steeped in the egalitananism of folk music and, lately, the back-to-theland ethos of the hippies. Hillman has an indelible memory of coming off the road in the winter, most likely after the 1966 tour in support of \"Turn! Turn! Turn!,\" and reacchmatmg himself to the canyon's rhythms. \"It was like January or February and it had just rained in L.A.,\" he recalls. \"The cab stopped and\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n17\n\nthere was a eucalyptus tree down across the road. I literally had to climb over that tree with my bag to get down to the house.\" Hillman had moved to the top half of the Magnolia house, the dentist having decided to take the apartment underneath. Pamela's infatuation notwithstanding, Hillman had taken up with a striking British woman, Anya Butler, whom he would later marry. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, then entering a phase of increasingly erratic behavior as he struggled with manifold personal demons while trying to keep his band from slipping out of the post-Beatles pop-culture firmament, began appearing unannounced at the top of the dusty driveway, where he would wait, hoping to engage Butler. \"I never knew it,\" Hillman says. \"Then she'd tell me: 'Brian came up and parked his car at the top of the driveway' He just wanted to talk. It was like '66 and he was starting the decline.\" Crosby, still a fixture around the canyon, had meanwhile taken to wearing an Oscar Wilde/Frank Lloyd Wnght-ish cape wherever he went. It became a bona fide of canyon residency to have seen Crosby roaring down Laurel Canyon Boulevard, cape flying in the wind, on the Triumph motorcycle given to him by Peter Fonda—who along with Jack Nicholson had been part of the house-papering engineered by Dickson at the Byrds' early shows at Ciro's, a shrewd, and correct, inference that hip young Hollywood might find generational solidarity with L.A.'s hippest, newest rock-and-roll band. \"You have to remember, this is classic, when [Crosby] was wearing that stupid cape.\" Hillman fairly snorts at the memory. \"He's coming down the canyon real fast with the cape flying, and Jim Dickson says, 'It's Lawrence of Laurel Canyon!' It just fit David perfectly, because he would strut around . . .\" Hillman pauses. \"He's a funny guy, I really love the guy. He's just one of those people in your life that has a bull's-eye on the front of his shirt.\"\n\n18\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nCrosby wasn't the only one strutting. No one could have adequately prepared in 1966 for the fame that beset the Byrds, least of all maladjusted former folksingers who suddenly were not only being compared to the Beatles but were meeting their heroes as backstage peers. The days of playing for nothing at the Troubadour Hoots and building calluses on slender white fingers outside the Ash Grove must have seemed a million miles away. Now, when a Crosby or a Hillman happened into the Olde Worlde or the Whisky A Go-Go on the Sunset Strip, the few times when they were off the road or not in the studio, enormous deference was paid and, it seemed, expected. Raphael worked as a waitress at Fred C. Dobbs, a coffeehouse on the Strip frequented by scenesters. \"They were all hustling, looking for something, and it reeked of egotism to me,\" she says. \"They were all in costumes, with the capes and all that; that's what was so phony. The first time Dylan walked in with his entourage, the idea was: he's one of us, but it's not really cool to acknowledge him. But the buzz went out very quickly—'THATS DYLAN' HE'S STANDING OVER THERE!' There began to be a feeling that these guys were a cut above the rest of the scene, and that hadn't operated previously.\" Given these distractions and the traditional territonalism of young men in close quarters, tensions among the Byrds were already running high \"Gene and Mike and I were the young guys,\" Hillman says. \"David and Roger were three years older than us, which is a huge amount of time at that age, and were vying for leadership and of course always at each other's throats.\" Clark, meanwhile, developed a phobia about flying and debilitating drug and alcohol habits and left before completing the band's third album, Fifth Dimension—though not before recording his triumphant \"Eight Miles High,\" composed with Crosby and McGuinn, widely considered the apogee of the Byrds'\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n19\n\nflight. \"Gene Clark, who came out of Bonner Springs, Kansas, was one of the sweetest guys in the world, and literally [Los Angeles] ate him up and spit him out,\" says Hillman. \"When I met him when the Byrds began, he'd just do anything for you. He was a great-looking guy; he was the focal point onstage. The Byrds would hit that first note and every girl in the audience would look at Gene Clark—there he is: Prince Valiant with a tambourine. The demons got hold of him and never let go.\" After endless feuding, Crosby was finally fired from the group during the recording of their fifth album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers. The band had been fraying when they'd played the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967; Crosby, between songs, launched into a rodomontade about a government conspiracy to cover up the Kennedy assassination, infuriating McGuinn. \"They threw me out,\" Crosby recalled. \"And they were not nice about it. I'm sure I contributed to it as much as anybody. I was not an easy guy at that point. I was pretty much of a punk and had an enormous attitude.\" At loose ends in the year before he would form Crosby, Stills & Nash, Crosby turned up at a house shared by Twice Nicely, a band from Sugarbush, Vermont, memorable only for having as its guitarist Waddy Wachtel, who in the 1970s would provide lead guitar on the signature albums by Jackson Browne and other Laurel Canyon stalwarts. Crosby picked up a guitar and played a song for the assembled musicians. When he finished, he asked them if they'd be interested in recording it. The musicians, through a haze of blue smoke, passed on the song. Its title: \"Wooden Ships.\" With the departure of Clark and Crosby, Hillman was playing a much larger role in the Byrds, composing and singing while steering McGuinn closer to his own hard-core country and bluegrass roots. After adding Gram Parsons, a Southernborn trust-fund scion, Harvard dropout, and devout student of\n\n20\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nhonky-tonk music and attitude, the Byrds released a flat-out country album, 1968's Sweetheart of the Rodeo, now regarded as a classic and a precursor to the country-rock movement of the early 1970s but a thudding commercial failure. In a dismal metaphor for the times, Hillman's Magnolia house burned to the ground one afternoon, nearly killing him. Fires—house and brush, intentional and accidental—have always shaped Laurel Canyon. A tourist hotel at the pinnacle of Lookout Mountain burned in 1918; the Canyon Country Store in 1929. A large swath just east of Lookout Mountain went up in 1959; twenty-three houses in the Kirkwood Bowl were destroyed in a four-hour wildfire in 1979. For all the Brigadoonian comparisons the canyon inspired among its self-congratulating new residents, the fires cared not at all about pop-cultural pedigree. And so Laurel Canyon would burn and burn again, targeting with uncanny precision the homes of its seemingly enchanted rock demimonde. Hillman's was among the first. \"It was a Santa Ana wind, a very, very hot, dry, windy day,\" Hillman recalls. \"I had a motorcycle—a Bultaco, a Spanish dirt bike—and I pulled it out to take it out and drive it. And it starts leaking gas. So I pull back into the garage, and within a matter of seconds the water heater ignited, exploded, burned my eyelashes. I rolled on the ground instinctively, and the flames just shot up into the house. I lost everything. The fire trucks couldn't get up the dirt road. It was just gone. Roger [McGuinn] was across the canyon and had just gotten a sixteen-millimeter camera because he was always into gadgets, and he filmed the whole thing. I lost everything I owned, including one of the best guitars I ever had—an old [Martin] D-twenty-eight. But here's the twist on it: Crosby was at my house an hour before the blaze. I can't connect it yet—where the Satan factor came into play with David—but I'm working on it.\"\n\nSO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK-AND-ROLL STAR?\n\n21\n\nAfter the fire Hillman moved out of the canyon and finally left the Byrds in 1968—by then he and McGuinn were the only remaining founding members—and joined Parsons in the Flying Burrito Brothers. It was another star-crossed band whose influence is apprehensible thirty years later but whose tenure was brief, brilliant, underappreciated, and stained with excess— Parsons OD'd at age twenty-six in a motel outside Joshua Tree, California, on September 19, 1973 Hillman is unsparing in hindsight with regard to the era's drinking and drugging and its deleterious effect on the musicians' work ethic, a nonnegotiable prerequisite in the country and bluegrass discipline of his background. \"I was no angel,\" he admits, \"and I thank God every day that I survived. Look at all the people I worked with that I lost, by their own choice.\" It's been pointed out that the Byrds could have—should have—been bigger; they were hyped to their everlasting embarrassment (and censured by skeptical audiences on early tours in Britain) as \"America's Beatles,\" a preposterous burden that only increased the pressure on the band. Still, the sheer talent of McGuinn, Hillman, Clark, and especially Crosby practically demanded a transcendent career arc. \"[The Byrds] could have been bigger, but we needed the discipline and needed to work harder— we were lazy and cocky and it got to us,\" says Hillman. \"We could have been out there probably another five years. The original guys could have all had a really good run into the '70s, if not longer, if we'd had the discipline and structure in place. We didn't have that.\" And so Laurel Canyon's first and arguably finest band—in the coinage of both Buddy Holly and the Byrds' spiritual heir Neil Young—faded away, but not before creating the template for so much of the music that would matter to the world for the next twenty years And when the band was finally inducted into\n\n22\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nthe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, the Byrds came together as they once flew apart, secure in the knowledge of precisely what they had accomplished. All the petty intrigues of the past, it turned out, paled in comparison. At the induction ceremony, Hillman notes with some satisfaction, \"The Byrds were the only inductees in the group category that sat together. And played together.\"\n\nTWO\n\nHUME m\n\nm eaeiH\n\nFreaking out at Zappa's canyon compound, Girls Together Outrageously, psychedelic bowling, and the final resting place of Tony the Wonder Horse\n\nIn 1910, an engineer and speculator named Charles Spencer Mann began selling house lots halfway up Laurel Canyon on a tract of steeply sloped land thick with chaparral, sycamore, and California bay laurel—the latter's jasmine-like flowers had given the canyon its name. Shamelessly emulating a development two canyons to the east whose soon-to-be-indehble logo marched in three-story letters across the summit of Mount Lee, Mann christened his subdivision Bungalow Land and billed it as \"a high class restricted park for desirable people only.\" To lure desirables to a canyon largely populated by coyotes and rattlesnakes, Mann commissioned a trolley from Sunset Boulevard whose cars ran on roads instead of rails. The nation's first \"trackless trolley\" was soon depositing prospective Babbitts at the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and a rugged trail that leaped up a cut in the canyon's west wall to the top of Lookout Mountain, a twelve-hundred-foot peak with comely views to the Pacific Ocean and the nascent downtown Los Angeles.\n\n24\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nBeneath Bungalow Land's twisting lanes, a log-cabm-style roadhouse was built in 1916 at 2401 Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Among the amenities was a bowling alley in the basement. The tavern later became a private retreat with an unnervingly long, narrow living room dominated by a granite hearth of feudal proportions. Tom Mix, the former rodeo rider turned matinee idol then on his way to earning $17,000 per week prior to the federal income tax, lived there briefly before moving to a sevenacre Beverly Hills compound with front gates emblazoned \"T-M\" in flowing neon. Mix's journey from Laurel Canyon log cabin (his \"wonder horse,\" Tony, was supposedly buried beneath the bowling alley) to Beverly Hills pleasure dome would uncannily foreshadow the diaspora of a later generation of Laurel Canyon pop culturalists struck by sudden, thunderous wealth. So it was that in 1968 Frank Zappa, a desperately ambitious twenty-eight-year-old classical-music composer, electric guitarist, and strident pop iconoclast, fresh from a chaotic artist in residency in New York City's Garrick Theater with his band, the Mothers of Invention, installed himself, his wife, Gail, and their baby daughter, Moon Unit, at the Mix cabin. \"The rent was seven hundred dollars a month,\" Zappa later recalled. \"It was rustic and decrepit; it really looked like an old-time log cabin.\" On the grounds, Zappa noted, \"was a big concrete fish pond full of weeds. Next to that was a hole in the ground filled with stagnant water. I was told it was a secret passageway that went under the street to Harry Houdini's house on the other side of Laurel Canyon Boulevard I never found out if that was true. Running up the hillside, behind the house, was a collection of man-made caves built out of stucco, with electric wiring and light bulbs inside.\" Zappa, his wife and daughter, and an extended family of musicians gifted and aspirant, groupies turned governesses, and\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n25\n\nunclassified hangers-on would occupy the cabin for only four months before the sheer madness of the place drove them out. But in that brief moment the \"log cabin,\" as it was known to every freak from Sherman Oaks to Hollywood, raged as a rockand-roll salon and Dionysian playground where groupies were gentrified into recording \"artists\" and talents as imposing as Mick Jagger and Jeff Beck and as whimsical as Alice Cooper were stabled, jam-sessioned, fed, and fellated while the undisputed master of the house—tolerant of all manner of misbehavior save goldbricking musicians and, perversely for the times, drug use—reigned as the \"freak daddy\" of the whole show. \"The place was huge and vault-like and cavernous—the living room was like seventy feet long and thirty feet across,\" says Gail Zappa, Frank's widow. \"It was so dark. I think the oldest eucalyptus tree in Southern California overshadowed the whole property. There was no floor in the kitchen, just this sort of platform in one corner that had the stove sitting on it. It was infested constantly with bus groups of rock-and-roll bands looking for a place to crash—they would just show up at all hours of the day and night. It was impossible to keep any food in the place; people were literally eating us out of house and home. There were no locks on any of the doors. It was insanity. Insanity?' It fell largely to Gail to manage the chaos. \"For [Frank], it was an interesting social experiment, because we had pretty much most of the band living with us and a lot of the crew. But for me, no; not with a baby. The truth is, that was a temporary stop until we figured out where and how we were going to manage our lives now that we were parents, among other things. That was a house we lived in but it was not our home.\" The log cabin nevertheless left indelible memories among those who visited during the Zappa's residency in the summer of 1968. John Mayall bunked there before buying his own place\n\n26\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nin the Kirkwood Bowl and wrote \"2401\"—the cabin's address on Laurel Canyon Boulevard—in honor of the Zappas' hospitality: \"There's a hero living at 2401 and all around/a family circus in the sun.\" Circus, indeed. \"It was sort of like being in Las Vegas,\" Gail says, \"in the sense that you have no concept of time. The only thing I can compare it to is living on a battleship—my father was career navy, so was Jim Morrison's. There's a culture that prepares you for this lifestyle, very much like the kind of operation when you're on a battleship in the middle of the sea: you're very isolated from the rest of society and you have a mission.\" Befitting the unwavering Zappa work ethic, the mission at the log cabin, Gail says, was \"defined by your creative output and how much you can manage to get done.\" Zappa managed quite a bit. \"It was one of his most productive periods,\" she says. \"There were so many albums being done at the same time, between the GTOs and the work that he was doing for himself. The building blocks for a lot projects were launched there.\" The cabin was part of a compound owned by Fonya Pearson, who lived to the north of the property in a Mediterraneanstyle villa said to have been built for a state visit to Los Angeles by Edward VIII that evaporated after his abdication. (The record producer Rick Rubin later bought the mansion; the Red Hot Chili Peppers lived there while recording 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and Guns N' Roses shot the wedding scene of the \"November Rain\" video on its verandas.) The log cabin was already occupied by a fringe-group encampment when Zappa arrived, and the fates of the shaggy tenants and Zappa would be, as in a later Zappa lyric, \"intimately entwined.\" Among the tenants were Sandra Leano and Lucy Offerall, incipient groupies, and Christine Frka, a spectrally thin seamstress from San Pedro, who lived in a large safe next to the basement bowling alley. Finally,\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n27\n\nthere was Carl Franzoni, the fearsomely bedraggled former mailorder salesman of breast-enhancement pumps turned Byrds dancer. Franzoni s brother rented the cabin as a rehearsal space while he put together the Fraternity of Man in 1967; the band ended up writing the epochal \"Don't Bogart Me\" (soon to be featured in Easy Rider) in the cellar. Franzoni and the incipient GTOs moved into the various cubbies and cubicles downstairs, where Franzoni was fond of bowling at two in the morning. Upstairs, the brothers staged dance parties in the cavernous living room. \"The room was big enough to hold about four hundred people,\" Franzoni says. \"It had three chandeliers. The bands set up in front of the huge fireplace. We'd feature three bands a night. You could get in for two bucks and you had to bring your own booze. There was no parking—there'd be cars parked all the way down Laurel Canyon—but the police never bothered us.\" Or at least they stopped trying once they'd met Franzoni. \"It was ten at night, we'd just moved in, and I hadn't washed myself for three days,\" he says. \"The band was rehearsing, and there was a knock on the lower door to the bowling alley— there's a vestibule you come into, the lighting was really dim. So I open this huge door and there's two Los Angeles policemen standing there: 'Your music is too loud, we've gotten too many complaints.' I looked at the cops—the music is blaring behind me—and I said: 'Get the fuck out of here!' And the cops turned around and ran. They were two young cops, and my hair was way high and I'm looking like the Hunchback of Notre Dame answering the door.\" Franzoni lived behind the bowling alley in a curtained, tomb-like space lined with egg cartons he had painted in pulsing psychedelic hues. \"His bedroom—oh, my God—it was a den where God knows what went on,\" says Pamela Des Barres. Along with Leano, Offerall, Frka, Linda Sue \"Sparky\" Parker,\n\n28\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\n\"Mercy\" Fontentot, and \"Cinderella,\" Pamela was about to cut a large swath through popular culture as a founding member of the GTOs groupie clique. (Tiny Tim preferred to address each girl as \"Miss\" followed by her first name; subsequently the GTOs went by Miss Pamela, Miss Christine, Miss Mercy, and so on.) The first time Pamela descended into the cabin's basement she was confronted by the sight of Franzoni bowling naked \"except for plastic clip-on curlers in his pubic hair and a big pair of pointy stomping boots. He looked like a nuthouse escapee from someone's wildest nightmare.\" When Franzoni ventured outside the cabin, he favored a flowing satin cape emblazoned with a large F, which Pamela assumed meant Franzoni until he corrected her one evening with \"Come meet Captain Fuck!\" while flicking his serpentine tongue. \"I was always trying to trap her, because she's so good-looking and sexy,\" Franzoni says. \"I think I had one episode in the bathroom downstairs, but she said, No, no, no, so I walked away from her.\" Franzoni, Vito, and Vito's wife, Szou (pronounced sod), were instrumental in creating the style-and-attitude template for post-Beatles Los Angeles youth. The look was especially influenced by Szou, who ran a boutique downstairs from her husband's studio. Franzoni recalls watching The Steve Allen Show and seeing \"this guy sculpting Steve Allen, and that was Vito.\" The sculpture progressed over two or three shows; when it was finished, Franzoni says, \"Steve invited Vito's wife to come onstage and show off her clothes, and right in the front row he had all these crazy beatnik girls wearing different clothes of hers.\" \"[Szou] was the first person in town to sell vintage clothes, to put them in a hip, boutiquey situation and combine them,\" says Pamela. \"She would take them apart and create other pieces of finery. That was real innovative at the time.\" Says Franzoni: \"She started the see-through look. May Co. would come over and buy a dress from her and then you'd see [a copy] on their\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n29\n\nracks.\" When subsumed into the media orgy over Ken Kesey s Merry Pranksters and San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, the Szou look would inevitably be lumped with the all-purpose \"hippie\" trope. But the prototypical L.A. thrift-shop-clothed longhairs colonizing the Sunset Strip were actually split into several factions, the gnarliest known simply as freaks. (Zappa wrote \"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\" on the Mothers' first album about Franzoni.) \"A hippie was sort of the unwashed, unkempt kid,\" explains Pamela. \"A freak was someone who put a lot of care and intention into their appearance, wanting to stand out instead of blend in. I was a combination flower child—freak, because the former was all about love and sharing and adoring each other and having flowers in your hair, literally, and lace and feathers and all that. I never considered myself a hippie. She'd be wearing one of those Indian madras-type skirts with her hair split down the middle, no makeup, sandals, braless—of course, we were all braless. I would have on an old vintage lace tablecloth with ribbons woven through it, feathers in my hair, loads of makeup, sequins stuck all over my face, and spike heels.\" Gail Zappa recalls a nightly ritual at the cabin. \"Around five all the girls, the GTOs and their friends, would get dressed. They'd bring out boxes. I'm not talking about macramé or tiedye or any of that crap, but things from the turn of the century up to maybe the '30s and '40s. A number of the girls decided they'd call themselves Klondykes, and they would dress like those women from the '40s suddenly smoking on-screen, with their fucking pumps and shoulder pads, kind of a Mae West type. There was a phase of that and then there were all the doilies and feathers. It was constantly evolving. The rule of thumb was: you couldn't wear the same thing twice. Ever.\" Vito taught sculpting classes on Tuesday nights at his studio— his pupils included Jonathan Winters and Mickey Rooney as well as feral Beverly Hills matrons more specifically interested in\n\n30\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\ninvestigating the artist's heroic libido. But Vito's most significant contribution to the budding freak culture was mustering misfits like Franzoni into the wild-dressing, free-form dance troupe that rose to fame with the Byrds and became fixtures at clubs on the Strip, where they would make a mockery of the Brylcreemand-bouffant straights primly doing the Frug. Vito and his dancers began their forays in pre-Byrds 1964, at the dawn of L.A.'s folk-to-rock conversion. It was slim pickings at first. L.A. was still in thrall to folk music but the smarter musicians noted that times were, in fact, changing. Henry Diltz, banjo player in the Modern Folk Quartet who would soon become a top rock photographer, credits Vito's dancers as a goad to complacent folkies. \"Flower children would come in and they'd be on acid, waving their hands in the air,\" he recalls. \"They didn't want any three-minute song. If you did a threemmute song and it was over, they were just getting into it. So we'd do fifteen-minute songs and play instrumental things— then repeat the whole song—because once they got in the mood they didn't want the music to stop.\" Here was a preview, fresh from the streets, of the coming distraction about to shake the music industry and popular culture: young, mainstream audiences would soon embrace albums over hit singles and \"progressive\" FM radio over Top 40 stations. Music was becoming a journey as opposed to a diversion, a trend that prefigured the extended dance mixes and DJ sets of the hip-hop and rave scenes of the '90s. \"You still had your jocks and beehive-hairdo types doing the Mashed Potatoes,\" says Raphael. \"But all of a sudden hip people—these unwashed beatniks—were dancing.\" And they pointedly were not doing the Swim. \"Maybe the freer music inspired the freer movement,\" Raphael says. \"In a partner dance, it was still a guy who led and you were kind of under his thumb; you had to obey the guy. This was wonderful.\"\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n31\n\nVito's dancers soon became as big a draw as the purported entertainment onstage. \"The Whisky didn't want us for a long time until those Italian guys [owners Mario Maglieri and Elmer Valentine] figured out that we were their salvation because it was empty a lot and they had those cage dancers and it was boring, and up the street there were other places you could dance,\" says Franzoni. John Hartmann, proprietor of the Kaleidoscope, a club at Sunset and Vine in Hollywood, who would later manage Crosby, Stills & Nash, says: \"I would let Vito and his dancers into the Kaleidoscope free every week because they attracted people. They were really hippies, and so we had to have them. They got in free pretty much everywhere they went. They blessed your joint. They validated you. If they're the essence of hippiedom and you're trying to be a hippie nightclub, you need hippies.\" Says Gail Zappa: \"If you had a large enough group you'd probably be allowed in for free to dance, because the people on the Strip knew the value of bringing in the tourists—those are the people paying the cover and buying the drinks, not the [freaks], who didn't have any money to buy alcohol. The customers came to see the freaks dance. Nobody ever talks about that, but that was the case.\" Eventually, the munificence of the proprietors reached its inevitable limit. \"There's a classic event, it was in 1968, where Bernardo [Saldana] or one of the BTOs\"— a fashion-conscious male clique that arrived on the scene along with the GTOs—\"walked into the Whisky,\" says Zappa. \"And he put up his peace sign in the usual way everyone would to just pass through. And Mario put a peace sign in his face and stopped him and said: 'Two dollars.' And then it became you had to pay to get in. If you were a freak, those days were over.\" There was, however, a darker side to Vito's Dionysian celebrations. Miss Pamela recalled an evening's entertainment at Vito's studio that included two barely pubescent girls perform-\n\n32\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\ning sexually for an alternately rapt and appalled audience. Then there was Vito's son, Godot, soon to fall to his death from a scaffold at the studio. \"He was an adorable little boy, two or three, a little blond towhead,\" says Raphael. One night Raphael was present at Vito's when Godot was produced. \"They passed that little boy around, naked, in a circle with their mouths,\" she says. \"That was their thing about 'introducing him to sensuality.' That was well known. It was billed as something you could do. It didn't go over well with people other than that particular pseudo-hip arty crowd. That's why I hated Vito so much. Everybody felt terrible when Godot died, of course, and Vito went into mourning. But, still.\" Frank Zappa, meanwhile, had been clawing his way out of obscurity. Born in Baltimore and raised in a litany of dreary Southern California suburbs, he was an adept of the avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse but also a connoisseur of R & B and cheesy doo-wop. An accomplished guitarist with a penchant, decades ahead of its time, for deconstructing popular culture— he'd already appeared on national television playing a duet on spinning bicycle wheels with Steve Allen—Zappa plowed through a succession of bands before joining R & B outfit the Soul Giants in 1964, which he renamed the Mothers. The Mothers played dense, jarring material that was often an elaborate send-up of prevailing pop pap, made all the more disconcerting by the musicians' aggressively slovenly dress and coiffure, none of which endeared them to the Strip's club owners. Franzoni met Zappa at Ben Frank's, a Jetsons-esque coffee shop on the Strip soon to become one of L.A. freakdom s stations of the cross. \"Frank was looking for the key to get into Hollywood,\" Franzoni says. \"He says, 'I want to get into Hollywood. What do I do?' I spent at least three months talking to him in his orange car, his house. I said, Okay, I'm trying to get away from the Byrds. You're next. I'll help you if you want.\"\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n33\n\nWith Vito's dancers in tow, the Mothers were soon playing the Whisky and larger venues in all their demented glory By 1967 Zappa and the Mothers—rechnstened the Mothers of Invention by their nervous record label—had released the milestone albums Freak Out1 and Absolutely Free. Meanwhile, Pamela, Christine, Sandra, and Lucy, augmented by new recruits Mercy, Cinderella, and Sparky, split from Vito's troupe and began dancing as the Laurel Canyon Ballet Company. \"They were a little ticked off at us for that, but, you know, we were seven girls wanting to do our own little thing,\" says Pamela. \"Then Frank asked us to dance with the Mothers. We were wearing really nutty outfits like diapers and bibs with our hair in pigtails and all of our parts hanging out. We'd dress up in leaves and look like we were trees.\" Zappa meanwhile had been introduced to Adelaide Gail Sloatman, a secretary at the Whisky. By the time the Mothers returned from their eighteen-month residency in New York, Zappa and Sloatman were married and the parents of the infant Moon Unit. Gail had come back in advance to house-hunt. B e fore the move to New York she and Frank had lived together in a house in the Kirkwood Bowl, and now his instructions were explicit. \"Frank wanted to live in or near the canyon,\" Gail says. \"Laurel Canyon has historically attracted musicians and people very highly involved in the arts, and usually people that didn't come by who they were with their hands held out or expecting other people to pay the freight.\" As it happened, Franzoni was about to move out of the cabin. The dance concerts in the living room were petering out as complaints about the noise brought the police to the landlady's door this time. \"The police were bugging her more than they were bugging me, and that was the end of that,\" he says. \"We decided to get out of there. Gail was looking for a place, and I said, Y'know, we're moving out of here, so we'll vacate it.\"\n\n34\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nIn March 1968, Zappa, Gail, Moon Unit, and various members of the Mothers entourage moved into the cabin. Miss Christine, Franzom's basement-dwelling roommate, stayed on as baby governess. But the Laurel Canyon Ballet Company spent so much time at the cabin that they were essentially residents, too. \"It was just so special when Frank and Gail moved in; it was like it became a holy place for me,\" says Pamela. \"We got to watch Frank create music right on the spot. It was a very communal vibe. He really was a family man but was open to all kinds of humanity and would encourage every strange kind of person to hang out. He would sit us down and make us realize we really did have something to say and had lived interesting lives other people might be curious about.\" Pamela and her cohorts intrigued Zappa, and as a first step in their refurbishment he suggested that they ditch the Laurel Canyon Ballet Company name. \"He thought of the new name right there in the log cabin,\" Pamela recalls. \"He said, 'Why don't you call yourselves the GTOs, because you're Girls Together Outrageously?' We just freaked and frolicked around the living room, which was huge. You could walk into the fireplace and sit in there.\" Zappa was launching two record labels— Bizarre and Straight—and was considering signing the GTOs. That they had no apprehensible musical talent didn't deter him. \"I guess he saw lurking creative potential,\" Pamela says. \"He was always able to spot that in people.\" \"I think that's what Frank's talent really was,\" says Gail. \"He had such respect for people, he created situations for them to be able to realize things they never imagined for themselves.\" Zappa instructed the GTOs to write material for an album he would consider upon his return from a tour. The girls descended to the bowling alley to compose for six grueling months. The result, Permanent Damage, was recorded with the help of the\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n35\n\nJeff Beck Group, whom the GTOs dragooned backstage at the Shrine Auditorium and brought to the cabin to meet Zappa. Before the night was finished, Beck, the pianist Nicky Hopkins, and Rod Stewart found themselves in a Glendale recording studio embellishing GTO compositions like \"The Eureka Springs Garbage Lady\" and \"I'm in Love with the Ooo-Ooo Man,\" Pamela's tribute to Nick St. Nicholas of Steppenwolf, to whom she'd recently lost her cherry. The GTOs weren't the only \"talent\" to audition at the log cabin for Zappa. From Cortez High School in Phoenix came a band of former track-and-field lettermen who'd been foundering almost from the moment they hit L.A. They'd performed as the Earwigs and the Spiders before settling, for reasons never adequately explained, on Alice Cooper, the name also taken by the lead singer, Vincent Furnier, an otherwise arrow-straight son of an Arizona pastor. (Cooper would soon become such a serious boozer that the extravagantly dissipated Morrison considered him a drinking buddy.) Whatever the band lacked in musicianship was more than made up for in their outré, dragfemme stage presence, a consequence of being adopted by the GTOs soon after they hit town, in particular by Christine, with whom Alice fell in love. \"We really influenced their visuals,\" says Pamela. \"Miss Christine did Alice's makeup and helped him dress, and the rest of the guys followed suit, so to speak.\" Says Gail: \"Yes, they had the name, but they were all like these skinny guys in jeans and T-shirts. They did not have the makeup or dress. [Christine] was entirely responsible for that, but Frank was really pushing the envelope in terms of the image: if you're gonna go, go all the way. Between Frank's influence and Miss Christine's they became what they are.\" Alice Cooper eventually became the house band at the\n\n36\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nCheetah, a rock palace on the pier in Santa Monica. Affairs were at low ebb for the band. When they appeared with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cooper recalled, \"there were 6,000 people . . . We started out with the theme from The Patty Duke Show. It was as if somebody said, 'There's a bomb in the building.' We cleared the building m three songs.\" Undaunted, Cooper prevailed upon Christine to set up an audition with Zappa. \"He was our hero—knowing him was like knowing the Beatles.\" Zappa finally relented and told the band to stop by the cabin at seven, which in their exuberance they took to mean 7:00 a.m. At the crack of dawn, Miss Christine let them in and they set up their equipment in the basement and started playing. According to Cooper, Zappa soon thundered downstairs, naked, holding his ears. \"All right, all right,\" he shouted. \"I'll sign you! Just stop playing!\" (If this version of events sounds too glibly perfect, consider that in other tellings the band played outside the cabin.) Gail doesn't recall Cooper's early-morning audition; but she concedes, given the cabin Zeitgeist, \"it wouldn't surprise me in the least little bit.\" Alice Cooper's vaudeville—freak show theatrics were, wittingly or not, a jab at the earnest folk-rock juggernaut beginning to build in the canyon. \"Even hippies hated us,\" said Cooper, \"and it's hard to get a hippie to hate anything.\" Zappa probably saw in the band his own struggles to torment the status quo, but he also clearly relished the delicious joke of putting over a group whose style was several magnitudes more advanced than their substance. Nonetheless, after countless hostile gigs and character-building tours, Alice Cooper was turning into a tough and credible rock-and-roll band, growth that Cooper felt Zappa seemed disinclined to acknowledge. They ended up at Warner Bros. Records, Zappa's distributor, after he sold his Bizarre and Straight labels. Five years after Zappa signed them,\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n37\n\nAlice Cooper released Billion Dollar Babies, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. While Zappa was attempting to make stars out of groupies and inept musicians, rock's budding royalty were pointing their limo drivers up Laurel Canyon Boulevard to the cabin. Or maybe it just seemed that way. \"The legend precedes it,\" says Gail, \"because what actually happened was, it was only a very few people that we knew, and yeah, they were incredibly famous. But we were there for such a short time there would have been limos blocking the canyon if you believe the stories you hear constantly.\" Zappa's absolute intolerance for drugs was perpetually at odds with the proclivities of the cabin's storied guests. \"Frank was completely straight,\" says Pamela. \"And you just were not allowed to be high up there. I always felt sort of guilty—because I took a lot of reds then—staggering around the cabin because I knew he hated it. But he didn't ever bust me.\" Gail insists the well-traveled story that Zappa booted Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithful from the cabin for inebriation is not true. \"What I recall is that [Jagger] came over with Marianne Faithful, and she spent a few minutes demonstrating her ability on the tambourine and then pulled her clothing apart to reveal the bruises it caused on her ass and on her hip. That was very exciting. I also remember that Frank had gotten a splinter m his foot—we were all walking around barefoot, and there were these wood floors that hadn't been taken care of—and Mick Jagger got down on his hands and knees and grabbed Frank's foot in order to see what kind of assistance he could offer. Frank was really taken aback by that. I have very strong feelings about it—it was very genuine and very spontaneous.\" Nevertheless, countless hours and joints were consumed in cars parked along Lookout Mountain Avenue by guests getting\n\n38\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nhigh before entering the cabin. As to the source of Zappa's virulent antidrug stance, those close to him had little doubt. \"It was because he wanted to be in control]' says Pamela. \"It was pretty obvious. He wanted to control everything around him. And that obviously was out of his control when people were crawling around the floor.\" Although a well-documented martinet when working with musicians in his charge, Zappa \"was a very considerate person,\" Gail says, \"extraordinarily kind and very mannered in terms of being considerate. He really respected having good manners. I'm not talking about table manners but regard for another human being. What he was intolerant of was people who worked for him being lazy. He always gave people the benefit of the doubt—not everyone, but people of a naturally artistic persuasion—because they were experimenting with their lives.\" Though Zappa relished the notoriety that the cabin bestowed, the round-the-clock parade of personalities great and small was taking its toll. The cabin's awkward location only steps from Laurel Canyon Boulevard, a heavily trafficked route between the Valley and Hollywood, hardly helped matters. One summer afternoon Zappa was sitting in the living room with the GTOs when an intense young man walked through the open front door, introduced himself as \"The Raven,\" and said that he had something for Zappa. \"He handed me a bottle of fake blood with a rag in it, and said, 'I have isolated The Specimen!' and pulled out an Army .45,\" Zappa recalled. Tabulating his options, Zappa led the wretched man outside to the water-filled hole that supposedly led to the Houdini house and persuaded him to toss the gun into the water. And with that, Zappa recalled, he and Gail started looking for another house. The cabin, Gail says, had begun to attract \"an unsavory element, and that element became more prevalent than we felt comfortable with.\" On\n\nUNCLE FRANK'S CABIN\n\n39\n\nSeptember 6 or 7, 1968—Gail can't remember which—she and Frank moved to quieter quarters in the canyon, where he would write and record a staggering fifty-nine albums and father three more children, Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva, before dying of prostate cancer on December 4, 1993, at age fifty-two. After Zappa left, the cabin resumed its dreary roundelay of tenants—Eric Burdon of the Animals lived there for a time— while the grounds became seedier, the drugs harder, the parties larger, louder, and darker. Finally, on Halloween night, 1981, the cabin burned to the ground. \"It was such a crime when that thing burned down,\" says Pamela. \"It was just a mesmerizing and magical place, knowing right off the bat that it had belonged to Tom Mix and that his horse was buried underneath the bowling alley.\" Pamela still pictures Zappa \"up there with his striped shirts and flowered bell-bottoms, with a cigarette in his hand. Such an amazing, amazing individual.\" The day the cabin burned, Pamela says, \"I wanted to put the flags at half-mast.\"\n\nTHREE\n\nsail n THE mm * Pot and sympathy at Cass Elliot's, Crosby, Stills, and Nash in the living room, Eric Clapton in the backyard, California dreamin' becomes a reality\n\nDuring the American 1920s—a decade of prosperity and social upheaval unrivaled until the 1960s—the \"moderns,\" as the cultural historian Ann Douglas christened the gadabout young men and women of the Jazz Age, set about destroying the social and cultural conventions put in place in the late nineteenth century by the \"powerful white middle-class matriarch of the recent Victorian past.\" Douglas's matriarchs in chief included Frances E. Willard and her Women's Christian Temperance Union, proselytizer for prohibition; Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science Church; and the suffragette Carrie Chapman Catt, midwife of the woman's right to vote. The moderns, Douglas argued, \"aimed to ridicule and overturn everything the matriarch had championed.\" Certainly a woman like Dorothy Parker—promiscuous, atheistic, alcoholic, and unapologetic about her ambition and talent—would have been a living, breathing affront to the likes of Eddy. By mocking the conventions of the matriarch in their works and deeds, the male\n\n42\n\nLAUREL CANYON\n\nand especially female cultural stars of the 1920s, the Parkers, Fitzgeralds, Thurbers, Dos Passoses, and Hemingways, ensured that \"Christian beliefs and middle-class values would never again be a prerequisite for elite artistic success in America.\" Not even the matriarch's form, both nurturing and intimidating, was spared. \"Plumpness [would] never again be a broadly sanctioned type of female beauty,\" Douglas noted; \"the 1920s put the body type of the stout and full-figured matron decisively out of fashion\"—a point driven home by Groucho Marx's relentless humiliation of the stout, full-figured Margaret Dumont, dripping with jewels and self-righteousness, in half a dozen Marx Brothers movies. Once the matriarch and \"her notions of middle-class piety, racial superiority and sexual repression were discredited,\" Douglas concluded, \"modern America, led by New York, was free to promote . . . an egalitarian popular and mass culture aggressively appropriating forms and ideas across race, class and gender lines.\" The rapidly evolving cultural, social, and sexual conventions of the early 1960s, in Los Angeles as much as in New York, represented a reprisal, though exponentially more far-reaching, of the moderns' revolt of the 1920s. Just as the '20s were a reaction to and rejection of the Victorian past, the 1960s were a bracing slap to the face awakening America from the slumbers of the 1950s. For all the decade's masculine ciphers—the Cold War saber rattling and presence of an actual four-star general in the White House—the Zeitgeist of the '50s is indelibly linked to the image of a monolithically white, middle-class suburbia and its nuclear family over which the woman, in conical bra and crinolined housedress, reigned as mother, housekeeper, and prim sexual helpmate. The Victorian matron, it seemed, had returned, only now she was living in a Levittown split-level with a husband named Bud and a brood of Brownies and Cub Scouts. Her comeback would be short-lived; American women themselves\n\nLADY OF THE CANYON\n\n43\n\nwould rise up this time to slay her, most famously in the person of Betty Friedan and her book The Feminine Mystique. (The matron would nevertheless reappear, gentrified for the postReagan age, in the indomitable persona of lifestyle editrix and future felon Martha Stewart.) At the same time that the ideal of the demure, pure Caucasian female dominated mainstream American imagery, black musical idioms of rhythm and blues and incipient rock and roll struggled—and, late in the decade, briefly succeeded—to slice through the meringue of white popular culture just as jazz had in the 1920s. It was, notably, the daughters as much as the sons of the white American middle class in the 1950s who delivered to stardom Elvis Presley, a white hillbilly singing black-authored or, more typically, black-sounding songs, his courtly country manners betrayed by the unrestrained sexuality of his performance. \"[Elvis] won over the children of white people all over the country because the kids instinctively understood how vapid white culture was becoming,\" the novelist Bobbie Ann Mason recalled of her childhood in 1950s Kentucky. Or, as Jams Joplm told Rolling Stone's David Dalton in 1970, \"They were playing that '50s crap on t"
