        "text": "Robert Mitchum (born August 6, 1917, Bridgeport, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 1, 1997, Santa Barbara county, California) was an American film star whose roles as a cool, cynical loner combined with a notorious personal life and a sardonic, relaxed style to create a durable screen image as a fatalistic tough guy.\n\nExpelled from Haaren High School in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen, Mitchum took to the road during the early years of the Depression. The experiences of this period of his life served as his “education,” shaping his world-weary view and providing fodder for press interviews for the rest of his life. He eventually landed in Long Beach, California, where his sister Julie had settled, and in 1936 she persuaded him to join her in the local theatre guild. He launched his film career with a bit role in a Hopalong Cassidy western, Hoppy Serves a Writ (1943), which led to other small roles and eventually a contract with RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nDespite earning an Academy Award nomination for his supporting performance as a noble captain in the war drama The Story of G.I. Joe (1945), Mitchum is not remembered for playing typical Hollywood protagonists in conventional dramas. Instead, his image was constructed around a series of roles in gritty, low-budget crime dramas, later known as films noirs. As a cynical, hard-edged private eye in Out of the Past (1947), a disturbed artist in The Locket (1946), and a shady gambler in His Kind of Woman (1951), he portrayed characters whose bad judgment led to adventures that skirted the line between right and wrong.\n\nIn 1948 Mitchum’s real-life problems seemed to merge with those of his movie characters when he was arrested for possession of marijuana. He served nearly two weeks in jail and was placed on probation for two years, after which the conviction was struck from his record. Such a scandal would have destroyed the careers of most movie stars of the time, but Mitchum’s situation evoked sympathy from his fans and enhanced his onscreen image as a rebel and outsider."
