        "text": "Not everyone can win an Oscar, and awards are usually given in the heat of the moment at the end of a year before history can really judge, but it’s sometimes ridiculous to consider the lists of people that have won, versus people that have lost. Consider this list of fourteen of the greatest actors of Hollywood’s classic era.\n\nEach of them served an entire career without ever winning a golden statuette. Hopefully the glory of their legacies makes up for it. Please note that this list does not include Hollywood legends who are best remembered as a filmmaker instead of an actor, like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles.\n\n14. Kirk Douglas\n\nMr. Douglas is still with us as of this writing, proving that he is indeed as strong as a horse. He’s 97, and survived a stroke that affected his speech. He has made a few movies in recent years, such as Diamonds (1999) and It Runs in the Family (2003), but it’s probably a safe bet that he won’t win a competitive Oscar at this point. He does have his honorary Oscar, and hopefully that’s enough.\n\nDouglas’s characters could be abrasive, unlikeable, pushy, not necessarily heroic, and frequently failures. In his debut, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946), he was weak and weasly, an alcoholic District Attorney trapped in a marriage to a murdering entrepreneur, and second banana to the movie’s hero, Van Heflin.\n\nHe was a bad guy to Robert Mitchum’s good guy in his next film, Jacques Tourneur’s masterpiece Out of the Past (1947). And he was emasculated as one of the husbands in Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s A Letter to Three Wives (1949). But the same year, he received his first nomination for his performance as a struggling boxer in Mark Robson’s Champion (1949).\n\nHe gave arguably his greatest performance in Billy Wilder’s Ace in the Hole (1951), an extremely dark, acid look at the media, with Douglas as the centerpiece, choosing to put a man’s life at risk for the sake of a better story.\n\nEven though Wilder was a perennial Oscar favorite at the time, this particular film alienated most people who saw it, and it did not get the attention it deserved. A year later, Douglas was in two great films, as a fur trader in Howard Hawks’ The Big Sky (1952), and as a much-hated movie producer in Vincente Minnelli’s The Bad and the Beautiful (1952); he received his second nomination for the latter.\n\nMany adventure-loving boys probably remember him in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), though not as Captain Nemo. He received his third and last (to date) nomination for a kind of biopic, Lust for Life (1956), playing Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nThen came another masterpiece, Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957), in which he attempts to defend three men against a brutally unfair court martial. He worked with Kubrick again in Spartacus (1960), perhaps his most straightforward, heroic role, and re-teamed with Minnelli for a fascinating, but underrated follow-up to The Bad and the Beautiful, Two Weeks in Another Town (1962).\n\nThough he worked steadily, Douglas may have begun to seem like a relic. The 1960s may have harmed his image as the muscular, virile, all-American male, though he had a little comeback in the 1980s with Burt Lancaster in Tough Guys (1986), one of the first “grumpy old men” comedies. But it’s clear from his filmography that he was a great risk-taker, and didn’t particularly care how he came off while onscreen. He may have seemed like a movie star, but he was really an actor.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actor: Champion (1949)\n\nLost to: Broderick Crawford, All the King’s Men\n\nBest Actor: The Bad and the Beautiful (1952)\n\nLost to: Gary Cooper, High Noon\n\nBest Actor: Lust for Life (1956)\n\nLost to: Yul Brynner, The King and I\n\n13. Peter Lorre\n\nBack in the 1930s, Charlie Chaplin, who was no slouch in the acting arena, called Peter Lorre “the greatest living actor.” This would have been around the time that Lorre played the murderer in Fritz Lang’s astonishing M (1931), shrieking, “I can’t help myself!” in such a way that you couldn’t stop thinking about him.\n\nWith his bug eyes and nasally, panicked voice, Lorre might have been on his way, working with Josef von Sternberg on Crime and Punishment (1935) and with Alfred Hitchcock on The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and Secret Agent (1936). He also made a creepy, effective horror film, Mad Love (1935), in which he plays a tragic, obsessed fellow whose destroyed hands are replaced with those of a dead man.\n\nBut he was quickly typecast, in the “Mr. Moto” detective films, and as a sniveling lackey to domineering villains, but he was wonderful, and unforgettable as Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and as Ugarte in Casablanca (1942). He was in cult favorites like Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) and Beat the Devil (1954), but by the end of his career, he was playing in cheap horror flicks, and even in Frankie and Annette beach movies.\n\nNo nominations\n\n12. Joseph Cotten\n\nMany would say that Cotten didn’t have much range, and that his soft, Southern twang (he was born in Virginia) never left his characters, but the fact is that he contributed to some of the greatest movies ever made, and never once received a nomination.\n\nIn just his first two years, he was in Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane (1941), Welles’ The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), and Alfred Hitchcock’s Shadow of a Doubt (1943), where his polite manner served three different purposes in three different films. He’s the polar opposite of Kane, he’s the responsible romantic in Ambersons, and the deceptive (possible) murderer in Shadow.\n\nThe next year, he did George Cukor’s Gaslight (1944), saving poor Ingrid Bergman from Charles Boyer. He was entrusted to David O. Selznick’s super-Western Duel in the Sun (1946), and also in Selznick’s amazing Portrait of Jennie (1948) opposite Jennifer Jones.\n\nHe gave a great performance as the slightly befuddled Holly Martins in The Third Man (1949), though he was upstaged by Welles. He worked with Hitchcock again in Under Capricorn (1949), and with Marilyn Monroe in Niagara (1953).\n\nAfter that came mostly “B” Westerns, TV work, and a small appearance in Welles’ later masterpiece, Touch of Evil (1958). In his later years, he became a kind of supporting actor in various cult films, moving further away from the Oscar: Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), Hellbenders (1967), Petulia (1968), The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971), Lady Frankenstein (1971), Baron Blood (1972), Soylent Green (1973), Twilight’s Last Gleaming (1977), and The Hearse (1980).\n\nThere was also Heaven’s Gate (1980), and a year later, he suffered a stroke that affected his voice. He lived until 1994 and never even won an honorary Oscar. But he was dependable, immensely likable, and trustworthy, a high-quality addition to any movie. Maybe if he had raised a little havoc here and there he could have turned more heads.\n\nNo nominations\n\n11. James Dean\n\nThere’s very little question that James Dean would have won an Oscar had he lived past the age of 24. Aside from some bit roles and some television work, he was in three major films, and two of those performances were nominated. The third, Rebel Without a Cause (1955) was certainly worthy, and is arguably his best and most beloved film today, but it was canceled out since it opened the same year as East of Eden (1955).\n\nMany have tried to capture this legend’s essence with mere words, but it basically came down to the way he showed his pain and his wounds. He was very handsome and moved like a wolf or a cat, completely confident, but unable to do anything false. When he was wounded, he howled, or he curled up.\n\nHe was instantly sympathetic, and instantly alluring. He also had a kind of cross-sexual quality, wherein he seemed capable of seducing, or succumbing to, either sex or any age. He is a beautiful, heartbreaking cipher that will continue to fascinate many generations to come.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actor: East of Eden (1955)\n\nLost to: Ernest Borgnine, Marty\n\nBest Actor: Giant (1956)\n\nLost to: Yul Brynner, The King and I\n\n10. Carole Lombard\n\nLike James Dean, Lombard died young, at age 33, in a plane crash. She was mainly a comedy actor, and also, at one point, the highest paid female star in Hollywood. Since the Academy generally doesn’t approve of comedy, she was likely headed for more “serious” roles, seeking more respect and prestige. But she did receive one nomination during her lifetime, and for one of her best films. And for now we can treasure her spunky, goofball performances in five great films.\n\nIn Howard Hawks’ fast-paced Twentieth Century (1934), she plays a talented actress stuck on a train ride with Broadway impresario Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore) and a bunch of other loonies. In Gregory La Cava’s My Man Godfrey (1936), for which she received her nomination, she plays the wealthy younger sister of a family that takes a “forgotten man” (William Powell) and makes a butler out of him.\n\nIn William Wellman’s Nothing Sacred (1937), she plays a young woman who was once dying of radium poisoning, but — unbeknownst to anyone — is actually not; she hooks up with newspaperman (Fredric March) and becomes a media darling.\n\nIn Alfred Hitchcock’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith (1941), she finds out that her marriage to Robert Montgomery was never legal, and the two begin playing all kinds of jealousy-inducing games with one another. (This screwball comedy was unlike anything else Hitchcock ever made.)\n\nThen there’s her final film, Ernst Lubitsch’s wartime masterpiece To Be or Not to Be (1942), which was released after her death. It’s a complex mixture of comical deceptions, and dark humor, making dupes out of the Nazis. It’s remarkable that she’s still remembered far better than even a genius like Lubitsch, which just goes to show how lovely, funny, and irresistible she was.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actress: My Man Godfrey (1936)\n\nLost to: Luise Rainer, The Great Ziegfeld\n\n9. Marlene Dietrich\n\nGerman-born Marlene Dietrich was in silent films before she met director Josef von Sternberg, and their film The Blue Angel (1930) made her a huge star. In that film, she plays a nightclub performer, Lola Lola, who attracts the attention of a humble schoolteacher; he becomes obsessed with her and ruins his life. Sternberg was equally obsessed.\n\nHe made six more films with Dietrich, all incredible: Morocco (1930), Dishonored (1931), Blonde Venus (1932), Shanghai Express (1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934), and The Devil Is a Woman (1935). In them, Dietrich used her German accent and her husky singing voice to create characters that were aloof and unattainable, but with incredible allure, draped in front of lush backdrops.\n\nAfter that, she could do anything she wanted, and she made a series of high-class films with top directors: Frank Borzage’s Desire (1936), Ernst Lubitsch’s Angel (1937), a big hit with Destry Rides Again (1939), Raoul Walsh’s Manpower (1941), Billy Wilder’s A Foreign Affair (1948), Alfred Hitchcock’s Stage Fright (1950), Fritz Lang’s Rancho Notorious (1952), Wilder’s Witness for the Prosecution (1957), and Orson Welles’ Touch of Evil (1958) — never mind that she was older.\n\nShe was always wiser than anyone else around her. She capped things off with in Judgement at Nuremberg (1962), a film by Stanley Kramer, that Oscar specialist, but even that work failed to bring her a second nomination.\n\nShe died in 1992, but never even won an honorary Oscar.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actress: Morocco (1930)\n\nLost to: Marie Dressler, Min and Bill\n\n8. Boris Karloff\n\nThis may seem like a weird choice, but for a short time, Boris Karloff was the most impressive actor on earth. Let’s consider the work he did over a certain five-year period. He was the monster in James Whale’s Frankenstein (1931), bringing a strange anguish and soul to his character, and credited with a mysterious “?”, as if to suggest that this man behind the makeup could be anyone.\n\nHe played a cocky gangster with a great death scene in Howard Hawks’ brilliant Scarface (1932), and a mute manservant, also covered in hideous makeup, in Whale’s The Old Dark House (1932). He played the title characters in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932) and The Mummy (1932).\n\nHe was a wild-eyed religious zealot in John Ford’s The Lost Patrol (1934), and the leader of a bizarre cult in Edgar G. Ulmer’s horror masterpiece The Black Cat (1934). He topped it off with an even more pained performance in Whale’s Bride of Frankenstein (1935), coming close to having his own friend, but denied.\n\nConsider the way Karloff looked in these eight films, the way he completely changed his appearance, and the totally different way he moved and behaved in each. These are complete transformations, brave performances as monsters of different kinds, but all with human faces. Karloff himself was said to have been kind in real life; perhaps he learned empathy from looking into the darkness of the human soul.\n\nHe was in more very good films, including the sequel Son of Frankenstein (1939), three for producer Val Lewton, The Body Snatcher (1945), Isle of the Dead (1945), and Bedlam (1946), as well as The Haunted Strangler (1958), Corridors of Blood (1958), Roger Corman’s The Raven (1963), Mario Bava’s Black Sabbath (1963), Michael Reeves’ The Sorcerers (1967), and Peter Bogdanovich’s remarkable Targets (1968), not to mention many more that are more fun than they are good.\n\nHe became old-fashioned after a while, and the startling quality of his work was gone. If he were ever to win an Oscar, it would have been for those five years.\n\nKarloff died in 1969 and did not win an honorary Oscar.\n\n7. Greta Garbo\n\nIt’s hard to underestimate the kind of star Garbo was. She changed the lives of people who saw her films. They were never the same again. She was very frequently sad, in tragic stories. Her expressions went deep, into untold, intimate regions. She had so much charisma and so much star power that very few could co-star with her and be remembered the next day.\n\nShe was unattainable, strong, but when her heart was stolen, it was stolen all the way; the anguish of longing was hers alone. Once her star power was realized, her films rarely strayed much from a specific formula, beginning in the silent days, and up to her retirement from films in 1941, at the age of 35. It could be argued that she hadn’t much range, but her performances were intense, and immeasurably powerful.\n\nShe received four Oscar nominations (two in the same year, 1930), but never won. Actors who do the same kind of work again and again, no matter how profound, are usually overlooked. She received an honorary award in 1955, but of course, she never showed up.\n\nShe came to America from Sweden in 1926. By 1927, she had been paired with actor John Gilbert, who was also one of the few known to have been her lover in real life. Their most famous movie was Flesh and the Devil (1927). It was feared that her accent would ruin her career in talkies, but Anna Christie (1930) was a success. (It was advertised with the tagline “Garbo Talks!”)\n\nThen came Mata Hari (1932), cast as the infamous spy, the Best Picture Oscar winner Grand Hotel (1932), the great Queen Christina (1933), a glossy, truncated, MGM adaptation of Anna Karenina (1935), and working for George Cukor in Camille (1936). In 1939, Enrst Lubistch directed her in Ninotchka (1939), a brilliant comedy, which made clever use of her deadpan delivery for humor. (It was advertised with the tagline “Garbo Laughs!”)\n\nFinally, she re-teamed with Cukor for Two Faced Woman (1941). She lived until 1990, rarely seen, never married, no children. Simply wanting to be left alone, she inadvertently kept up her screen legend until the end.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actress: Anna Christie (1930)\n\nBest Actress: Romance (1930)\n\nLost to: Norma Shearer, The Divorcee\n\nBest Actress: Camille (1937)\n\nLost to: Luise Rainer, The Good Earth\n\nBest Actress: Ninotchka (1939)\n\nLost to: Vivien Leigh, Gone with the Wind\n\n6. Marilyn Monroe\n\nWell, of course, she couldn’t be taken seriously, could she? She wasn’t really an actress? More recent reports indicate that even though she was drastically unhappy, she was also a very canny manipulator of her onscreen image, as well as the reactions of her co-stars. And what is that if not acting?\n\nShe is probably best known for only a few roles, notably the giggly ones in The Seven Year Itch (1955) and Some Like It Hot (1959). Looking at those movies back to back, it’s clear that while she was more of an unwitting temptress for Tom Ewell in the former, she was more of a lonely heart in the latter.\n\nThen there were some of her more challenging roles, which she pulled off effortlessly. She explored darkness and torment in Don’t Bother to Knock (1952) and Niagara (1953), and took on some very adult material in Clash by Night (1952), Bus Stop (1956), and The Misfits (1961), her final film.\n\nShe was used as a cartoon character in things like Howard Hawks’s Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), which may be her greatest film, but it takes an incredible wisdom and self-awareness to be used in such a manner. Monroe had incredible power, and amazing skill. She was more than a two-dimensional sexpot. She was unforgettable.\n\nShe won some Golden Globes, but an honorary Oscar never came. She died in 1962.\n\nNo Nominations\n\n5. Edward G. Robinson\n\nEdward G. Robinson broke out with his awesome portrayal of gangster Rico in Little Caesar (1931). He was not nominated for it, or for anything else, ever, but it was a performance of such power that it was impossible to forget it for the rest of his career.\n\nHe was a squat man with a pinched face, and he had a scowling voice that went with his looks. He played similar tough guys, guys that were perhaps overcompensating for lack of size or looks, but he worked with the great directors, Howard Hawks, John Ford, Orson Welles, etc.\n\nBilly Wilder gave him a great role in Double Indemnity (1944), as Keyes, the insurance man who figures out what colleague Fred MacMurray is up to. It was a showy role, the kind that often gets nominated, but to no avail. Fritz Lang pushed him even further in Scarlet Street (1945), as an emasculated man stuck in a horrific marriage, becoming obsessed with a beautiful young woman and falling into a rabbit hole.\n\nHe came close to another nomination as gangster Rocco in John Huston’s Key Largo (1948). It was a meaty role, talky, with more focus on psychological drama than action or violence. Everyone knew his face by then, and his subsequent roles were a tribute to his screen presence, without giving him anything spectacular to do.\n\nHe was given an honorary Oscar the year he died, in 1973.\n\nNo nominations\n\n4. Robert Mitchum\n\n“Laconic” describes Robert Mitchum, as does “rangy.” He was cool, heavy lidded, with a decisive, saxophone voice. He was a big man, and he had a walk unlike anyone else, rhythmic, shifting, almost like a dance. His biography is called Baby, I Don’t Care, after one of his more famous movie lines, and it perfectly sums him up. He was detached, and it made him all that much more commanding. He was one of the great screen actors.\n\nHe was noticed rather quickly in the war film Story of G.I. Joe (1945) and awarded with a Supporting Actor nomination. It was his first, and last. After the war, soldiers came home to a different America and found it difficult to fit in. This disconnect and uncertainty was one of the driving forces behind the genre that was later called “film noir,” and Mitchum was a key player in it.\n\nJacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past (1947) was one of his greatest achievements. He plays a gas station attendant in a small town, dating a local girl, trying to go straight. But his past catches up with him, and he’s sent on a mission to find a gangster’s moll, which leads to obsession and murder. Mitchum plays the entire story as if it were simply inevitable, and his choice resonates throughout the film. The same year, he was in Raoul Walsh’s one-of-a-kind noir Western Pursued (1947) as well as the noir Crossfire (1947), which received a Best Picture nomination for its message against anti-semitism.\n\nOtto Preminger’s Angel Face (1952) and River of No Return (1954) were other highlights, until Charles Laughton’s incredible The Night of the Hunter (1955) came along. Today, this is considered one of the finest of all American films, totally misunderstood in its day, and it did not receive a single Oscar nomination. Mitchum’s sinister performance as the “preacher” threatening two children to find a hidden fortune is one of the great and terrible things the cinema has ever produced.\n\nHe was in Thunder Road (1958), a movie about moonshine runners that he co-wrote and co-produced; he played another terrifying villain in Cape Fear (1962), and starred with John Wayne in Howard Hawks’ great, laid-back Western El Dorado (1967). In the 1970s he had a comeback, somehow fitting right into the new, gritty Hollywood of the time. The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973) and The Yakuza (1974) are great crime films, Farewell, My Lovely (1975) is one of the finest adaptations of Raymond Chandler, and he worked with Elia Kazan on The Last Tycoon (1976). A second attempt at Chandler, The Big Sleep (1978), was a disappointment.\n\nAnd that was about it. Mitchum is now a familiar face during the holiday season, appearing with Bill Murray in Scrooged (1988). He had a small role in Martin Scorsese’s razor-sharp remake of Cape Fear (1991), with Robert De Niro earning an Oscar nomination for the role that Mitchum once played. He put back on his cowboy hat for two more Westerns. He narrated Tombstone (1993) and took a small role as an industrial tycoon in Dead Man (1996). He died in 1997 and never received an honorary Oscar.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Story of G.I. Joe (1945)\n\nLost to: James Dunn, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\n\n3. Peter O’Toole\n\nPeter O’Toole received eight Oscar nominations for acting and never won, which is the current record. He received an honorary Oscar in 2003, was nominated again in 2007, and lost again. Often he has just had bad timing. It’s hard to argue that he should have won over Brando in The Godfather, or De Niro in Raging Bull. And how was he ever going to beat Gandhi? Or Idi Amin?\n\nWhen he first broke out in the great Lawrence of Arabia (1962), he was fair-haired, handsome, and commanding. He could have been a prince. Thank heavens he revealed his sense of humor, which leaned toward the dark, in What’s New Pussycat? (1965) and How to Steal a Million (1966). This side of him made his serious work seem more accessible, and admirable. He was rounded, experienced.\n\nFinally he descended into dark humor, combining his wonderful comic timing with some very smart material. The Ruling Class (1972) and The Stunt Man (1980) paid off and became two of his most fascinating movies, as well as two of his nominations. My Favorite Year was much lighter, but O’Toole’s line readings added cutting laughs to the film’s nostalgia.\n\nThe 1980s led to a batch of fairly routine studio titles, including Supergirl (1984), although an appearance in the multi-Oscar winning The Last Emperor (1987) did not result in a nomination.\n\nFinally, twenty-four years after his seventh nomination came his eighth, for Venus (2006), a very good, very touching movie about the relationship between a dryly funny old actor and a young girl. O’Toole was a hard worker, but kept re-inventing himself. Sometimes it was great to see him because you knew just what to expect. Other times, he gave you something completely new. He died in December of 2013.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actor: Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nLost to: Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nBest Actor: Becket (1964)\n\nLost to: Rex Harrison, My Fair Lady\n\nBest Actor: The Lion in Winter (1968)\n\nLost to: Cliff Robertson, Charly\n\nBest Actor: Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969)\n\nLost to: John Wayne, True Grit\n\nBest Actor: The Ruling Class (1972)\n\nLost to: Marlon Brando, The Godfather\n\nBest Actor: The Stunt Man (1980)\n\nLost to: Robert De Niro, Raging Bull\n\nBest Actor: My Favorite Year (1982)\n\nLost to: Ben Kingsley, Gandhi\n\nBest Actor: Venus (2006)\n\nLost to: Forest Whitaker, The Last King of Scotland\n\n2. Barbara Stanwyck\n\nBarbara Stanwyck may be the greatest actress of the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema, which may explain why she never won an Oscar. Sly, and with her throaty voice, she could speak while smiling; she was very seductive and quite sexy. She could convince a man to do just about anything, but at the same time, she was often a victim. She could play regal as well as trash, and she could break your heart or make you laugh. She was smart and a good manager of her own career. She had good roles from the 1930s all the way through her television career in the 1980s.\n\nHer breakthrough role was Stella Dallas, although earlier titles, like The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933) and Baby Face (1933) have recently been discovered as classics in their own right. Baby Face in particular is an extraordinary, insane example of female power in the pre-code era.\n\nIn 1941, she was nominated for Howard Hawks’s Ball of Fire (1941), in which she played the sexy Sugarpuss O’Shea, helping several doddering scientists complete their entry on “slang” in a new encyclopedia. But the same year she had two other great roles, in Preston Sturges’ The Lady Eve (1941), and in Frank Capra’s Meet John Doe (1941), fast-talking her way around men in all three. She was the schemer in Double Indemnity (1944), and appeared in many more films noir after it.\n\nAs she passed forty, she found new blood in Westerns, starting with Anthony Mann’s great The Furies (1950), and becoming a tough, iron-jawed matriarch, with Ronald Reagan in Cattle Queen of Montana (1954) — a perfect title — and commanding a roomful of men in Samuel Fuller’s snappy “B” Western Forty Guns (1957).\n\nHer chance at an Oscar was gone. She eventually migrated to television, especially Western shows, with a famous recurring role on The Big Valley (1965-1969). In the 1980s, she could be seen in The Thorn Birds (1983) and The Colbys (1985-1986).\n\nShe received an honorary Oscar in 1982, and died in 1990.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actress: Stella Dallas (1937)\n\nLost to: Luise Rainer, The Good Earth\n\nBest Actress: Ball of Fire (1941)\n\nLost to: Joan Fontaine, Suspicion\n\nBest Actress: Double Indemnity (1944)\n\nLost to: Ingrid Bergman, Gaslight\n\nBest Actress: Sorry, Wrong Number (1948)\n\nLost to: Jane Wyman, Johnny Belinda\n\n1. Cary Grant\n\nHe was always “just Cary Grant.” Wasn’t he? Or was he really one of the two or three greatest actors of his time?\n\nHere’s the test. Grant made four films with Alfred Hitchcock and five with Howard Hawks. They are: Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), His Girl Friday (1940), Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), I Was a Male War Bride (1949), Monkey Business (1952), To Catch a Thief (1955), and North by Northwest (1959). Some of these are just fun, but others are among the greatest American films ever made.\n\nThink about Grant in each one of these, back to back. Think about the styles and approaches of the two directors. There’s an incredible range here, from the goofy, emasculated professor in Bringing Up Baby, to the callous, commanding air mail pilot in Only Angels Have Wings, to the slick, fast-talking newspaper editor in His Girl Friday, to the creepy possible murderer in Suspicion to the intrepid loudmouth Roger O. Thornhill. All of these roles are “just Cary Grant,” charming, funny, charismatic, but they’re all tonally, totally different.\n\nWe could also throw in some others, George Cukor’s Sylvia Scarlett (1935), Holiday (1938), and The Philadelphia Story (1940), Leo McCarey’s The Awful Truth (1937), George Stevens’ Gunga Din (1939), Frank Capra’s Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), and Stanley Donen’s Charade (1963), just to sweeten the pot and further underline Grant’s talent. In fact, the two drippy movies he actually was nominated for would be at the bottom of this list.\n\nIt’s really a mystery why someone so beloved should be so routinely ignored, unless you consider that he was so good at concealing his acting, at making it look effortless. Academy voters like to reward acting that looks like Great Acting, i.e. it’s showy, or it has some added bonus like a malady or physical condition, an accent, or it’s based on a familiar figure from life or literature. Grant was, yes, Grant. But he was so much himself, was so grounded, that he could read any character and find the truth in it.\n\nHe won an honorary Oscar in 1970 and passed away in 1986.\n\nNominations\n\nBest Actor: Penny Serenade (1941)\n\nLost to: Gary Cooper, Sergeant York\n\nBest Actor: None But the Lonely Heart (1944)\n\nLost to: Bing Crosby, Going My Way\n\nAuthor Bio: Jeffrey M.
