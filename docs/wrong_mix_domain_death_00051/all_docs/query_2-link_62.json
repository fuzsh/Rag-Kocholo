Despite her attachment to the queen, Magdalen disliked King Philip, and on at least one occasion she resisted the amorous advances of this prince, indignantly beating his offending hand with a wooden staff. She later attended Queen Maryâs funeral at Westminster Abbey (Dec, 1558). Tall, stately, and beautiful, Magdalen served Queen Elizabeth in the same capacity, but was scornful of the immorality of the new court.\n\nMagdalen Dacre refused the suit of Sir John Arundel, and was married instead (1558) to Sir Anthony Browne (1528 â 1592), first Viscount Montague (1554 â 1592), as his second wife.

Nevertheless she and her husband entertained Queen Elizabeth at Cowdray Park in Sussex for a week (Aug, 1591). She survived her husband as the Dowager Viscountess Montague (1592 â 1608). A staunch Papist recusant, Lady Montague resided during her widowhood at the family mansion of St Mary Overyâs, Southwark, which was unsuccessfully searched on one occasion for gunpowder (1599). Two holograph letters survive from Lady Montague, addressed to her godson, John Caesar, master of the Court of Requests. Her life, written in Latin by Richard Smith, Bishop of Chalcedon, was later translated into English (1627).

Artistically inclined, her talent was recognized by Sir Horace Walpole during her youth, and she became his protegee. Her husbandâs suicide in Covent Garden (Aug 15, 1776), brought on by his desperation concerning mounting debts, left her a childless widow.\n\nIn order to maintain herself, Mrs Damer became a professional sculptor, and worked abroad in Italy and Portugal, as well as in England. She was particularly known for her portraits busts, producing studies of King George III, the emperor Napoleon, Lord Nelson, the politician Charles James Fox, and the actress Sarah Siddons.

Minnie Damer died (Oct 30, 1848) aged fifty.\n\nDameta â (fl. c1115 â c1125)\n\nNorman concubine\n\nDameta was the mistress of Stephen of Blois, King of England (1135 â 1154) during his youth. She became the mother of his illegitimate son, Gervaise of Blois (c1118 â 1160), who became a monk and was later appointed abbot of Westminster, London by his royal father (1136). He was later deposed from office by Henry II (1157). Charter evidence reveals that Dameta had two other sons, Almaric and Ralph, who were called brothers of abbot Gervaise when they witnessed a charter, but whether they were fathered by Stephen, or by a prior or later husband, remains unknown. Dameta may also have been the mother of an unnamed natural daughter of King Stephen, who became the wife (before 1139) of Hervey, Vicomte of Leon, in Brittany.\n\nDamhnat (Damhnait) â (fl. c500)\n\nIrish virgin saint\n\nSometimes confused with St Dympna, she was a native of Tedavnet, near Slieve Beagh, in county Monaghan, and quite a distinct personage. Damhnat is listed in the, Martyrology of Donegal as âof Sliabh Betha,â and her feast day given as June 13. Her crozier has survived, and was preserved in the Royal Irish Academy. A second St Damhnat, of Kildalkey, county Meath (May 15) is identical also with St Dympna.\n\nDamhurasi â (fl. c1800 â c1770 BC)\n\nAssyrian queen\n\nDamhurasi was a secondary wife of Zimri-Lim, King f Mari. Surviving clay tablets from the palace archive reveal that Damhurasi was second in rank after the kingâs chief consort Queen Shibtu, and that she received larger rations for her household than did Zimri-Limâs sisters or daughters. Quite a number of her letters have survived at Mari, and reveal that the queen held important responsibilities concerning the administration of the royal household, and on one occasion reprimanded the royal physician during the kingâs absence on a military campaign. Queen Damhurasi had her own palace at Terqa and two of her letters addressed to the royal official Sin-muballit have survived.

They had several daughters though Asclepiodotus later tried to pass over another womanâs child as Damianaâs claiming a pagan miracle. This story was recalled in the Vita Severi of Zacharias the rhetor. Damascius and Suidas both recorded that Asclepiodotus left his property to his daughters, encumbered with debt, so it appears that Damiana predeceased him.\n\nDamiane â (fl. 589 â 602)\n\nGreek patrician\n\nDamiane was the daughter or daughter-in-law of a lady named Jannia, and was the mother of Athenogenes, Bishop of Patra. She is mentioned in the Pratum Spirituale of Johannes Moschius, who stated that she and the emperor Maurice shared a niece, so she was also related to Domitianus, Bishop of Melitene (c580 â 603). Damiane is thought to be identical with the lady of the same name, related to the Byzantine Imperial family, who was venerated as a saint in Jerusalem. She sent large sums of money to Pope Gregory I for the liberation of slaves.\n\nDâAmico-Inguanez, Maria Francesca Carmen Sceberras â (1865 â 1947)\n\nMaltese peeress\n\nMaria Francesca Sceberras DâAmico-Inguanez was born (Aug 20, 1865), the elder daughter of Alexander Sceberras DâAmico-Inguanez, fifteenth Baron della Castel Cicciano (1821 â 1880), and his second British wife, Frances Ann Wittuck.

The baroness represented the Maltese nobility at the coronation of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra (1902), and again at the coronation of George V and Queen Mary (1911). She was awarded the coronation medals from these events, and later also the Jubilee Medal (1935). Baroness Maria Francesca died (Dec 26, 1947), aged eighty-two, her heir general being her nephew, Alexander Arthur Ian Austin Chesney-Sceberras DâAmico-Inguanez (1896 â 1960), who succeeded her in both titles.\n\nDamita, Lili â (1901 â 1994)\n\nFrench actress\n\nBorn Liliane Marie Madeleine Carre in Bordeaux, Guyenne, she performed in music halls from the age of sixteen, and eventually succeeded the famous Mistinguette as the star performer of the Casino de Paris revue.
