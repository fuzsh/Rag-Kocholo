And I've lived a great deal of real life while I was at it,\" he wrote. \"Sober for the next 30 years, I'm told that I've come out of it all a good and useful human being.\"\n\nRyan had roles on many TV shows and in movies ranging from \"High Plains Drifter\" with Clint Eastwood to \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.\"\n\nHe also performed in the theater, including Broadway appearances in \"Wait Until Dark,\" \"Medea\" and \"The Price.\"\n\n\"He was a great gift in my life,\" Kathryn Leigh Scott, who appeared with him in \"Dark Shadows,\" said in a Facebook post. \"I cherish my warm memories of his beautiful soul.
