        "text": "Haphazard story-telling but rich in personal anecdotes\n\nMy Way is one of the most chronologically, disrupted biographical accounts I have ever read. In all earnestness it begins with his parents, MLJ’s birth after which it goes berserk. There is no linkage between chapters and sometimes very little linkage between paragraphs in the same chapter.\n\nThe casualness with which the book has been set up does not seem to take away anything from MLJ. The chaos of good feel, on the other hand, captures MLJ’s personality I think.\n\nMy Way is riddled with stories that had very little to do with MLJ, and its fun because of that. However there are a lot of stories about MLJ’s domestic, club career. But there is very limited description of his Test career — apart from the 1959–60 Calcutta test against Australia as well as the famous Brisbane test of 1967–68 (both of which you will read later about in this note).\n\nNo detailed account of his batting approach either. Or any insight into MLJ the batsman. Was he a leaver / did he prefer spin or fast bowling / what were his favourite go to shots? There are various stories about his captaincy & bowling stints. And reference to situations where he helped unlock the opposition and thereby turned a match.\n\nMy Way recounts the popularity of MLJ as a person. MLJ had friends everywhere — his school/college friends, fellow domestic / international cricket players, industrialists, journalists, film stars. Everybody & anybody that he seemed to come in contact with.\n\nMy Way is a biography by 2 people who knew him well. His batting?\n\n2. His ‘gait’\n\nSunil Gavakar (SMG) in the foreword talks of his fascination for MLJ that began with a black & white photo of a young MLJ which got him ‘hooked’. This was when SMG was 10yrs old, MLJ, about 20, when he was selected for the tour to England in 1959.\n\n“Apart from the good looks that photo showed the young man’s confidence, eagerness and ambition.”\n\nSMG goes on about the ‘gait’: “But one thing that was clearly obvious was the gait, like no other I had ever seen. While most Mumbaites seems to scoff at it, to me it had a strange fascination”.\n\nThere are more references to the’gait’ throughout the book, unusual for a cricketer’s biography.\n\n“Jai felt flattered when his walk was compared to Hollywood star Robert Mitchum’s.”\n\n“If Hyderabad was fielding, they would wait eagerly for the trio of Jai, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Baig. The trio’s walk into the ground was keenly, especially Jai’s swinging gait”\n\n3. Batting on all 5 days of a test match\n\nAfter some scheduling fiasco, MLJ was called to play the last test match at Calcutta against the Australians.\n\nMy Way: … where he set a world record, replicated by others later. Playing under G.S. Ramchand, he was at the crease on all five days of the Test, in all logging 442 minutes in the middle.\n\nComing down in the batting order at number 9, Jai remained unbeaten on 20 in the first innings and became the home side’s top scorer with 74 in the second. He was at the wicket for 24 minutes on January 23, 55 minutes on January 24, 12 minutes on January 25, five hours on January 27, (the day before being a rest day) and 81 minutes on Januray 28. Bowled finally on the last day by Ken Mackay, he was given a grand ovation back to the pavillion. A cricket fan presented him a cheque for Rs. 500.\n\n… A catch Jai held down at mid-off to effect the dismissal of Neil Harvey, endeared him to the Calcutta spectators, one of whom presented him with a Rolex watch.\n\n… Jai’s performance in the Calcutta Test saw him top the batting averages for India with 94, based on his 74 in the second innings and 20 not out in the first.\n\n4. Hundred in Brisbane\n\nFrom my previous scratchy understanding of his career, I knew that the Brisbane 100 was a seminal point in MLJ’s career.\n\nMLJ was not selected for the tour which made him give away his kit to a good friend’s kids. “Hope you have better luck with cricket than I did”, was the message he wrote on the face of the bat.\n\nThen as life does turn out — he got his break when his mentee B S Chandrasekhar got injured. MLJ was called up. A curious choice — a batsman for a spinner, but that was the politics of the time.\n\nAfter he got the call to join the Indian team in Australian team, he practiced hard with “zeal hitherto unseen” — went through a four hour session of pace and spin with his Hyderabad teammates.\n\nThe real preparation happened after: MLJ spent time at P K Belliapa’s house in Madras, before the early morning flight to Singapore, only carrying a borrowed GM bat. Full party, no sleep the night before he boards the flight. A flight to Perth from there, with no less party with another friend Zareer Byramji who had to part ways in Perth. A flight to Sydney and then onwards to Brisbane. Where, to acclimatise, MLJ had to have a late night session of drink and discussion with Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi (MAKP) — and after all that he had to bat the next morning.\n\n74 for MLJ in the first innings. Really? After all that travelling and drinking? To make matters even better, in the second innings 3 days later, MLJ’s century nearly pulled off an Indian win.\n\nMy Way chips in with some insight:\n\n“How had Jai managed those knocks despite the jetlag and lack of sleep? The man himself had a crazy theory: When you drink a lot, the eyelids get heavy, droop and shut the eyes. The effort involved in keeping the eyelids open itself forces one to concentrate and thereby sight the ball better!”\n\n5. Scooter trip from Secundarabad to Bombay\n\nA large part of the book was about MLJ’s affable nature. And one of the defining moments was his scooter trip along with some buddies from Secundarabad to Bombay — inspired by his sudden desire to see his girlfriend who was on an educational tour of North India.\n\nThis incident I reckon would have taken place in early 1960s. There was a Lambretta & a James motorbike between 4 of them. They set out at 5am, hit Zaheerabad for breakfast and then Sholapur for lunch — where a MLJ-struck restaurant owner refuses to take money. The James motorbike breaks down 30km from Pune. As they couldn’t physically move, they slept by the highway. They get a lift from a lorry driver, who had nearly driven over them, into Pune. One of the friends decided to take the Lambretta on a spin around Pune City but ended up crashing into a goat.\n\nThus they had 2 broken bikes and the Pune-Bombay ghats to negotiate. Lost a day to get the bikes working again and the quartret were in Bombay by 10am the next morning. After meeting his girlfriend (later his wife) Junie in Mumbai, the 4 friends ran around town to scrap enough money to book train tickets for themselves & the bikes back to Secundarabad. One of the friends (Pinky), unfortunately, had a massive heart attack a day after they returned. C’est la vie.\n\n6. Ella Fitzgerald in NY\n\nOn his way to the West Indies test tour in 1962, MLJ stopped in New York to hang with his brother Pratap Simha and friend Dicky. They commence a pub crawl, ending up at a jazz bar where Ella Fitzgerald was performing. As can be imagined, the trio got upset when they couldn’t meet her backstage after the show.\n\nPratap was thrown out, not before threatening “I know the senator!”. So Ella came out to see what the commotion was about. MLJ & Dicky, in true fashion, told her that they had travelled all the way from India just to meet her.\n\nMy Way: Maybe due to his charm, the high princess of jazz not only gave Jai an autographed photograph (“With love to Jai”) but a bear hug too. Dicky burst into tears.\n\nThe New York experience doesn’t end there: While staying with Pratap in New York, Jai became quite a hit with the women of the neighbourhood. At a party for a hundred friends thrown by Pratap and his wife Malati, Jai’s admirers were many, most of them Pakistani women. In next to no time, he had them eating out of his hands.\n\nNothing like a good Pakistani element in an Indian cricketer’s biography!\n\n7. Pakistan Connection\n\nMLJ’s Pakistan connection goes a bit further. When MLJ retired from first class cricket, a benefit match was organised in Hyderabad in Feb 1978. Of all the international cricket faternity that he knew, he invited 2 Pakistani players — Imran Khan and Mushtaq Mohammed. They couldn’t get visas until Ajit Wadekar stepped in with a personal guarantee.\n\nImran, from the photos published in the book, also played for MLJ’s U-Foam first class team that played in the Moin-Ud-Dowlah tournament in 1972 & 1973.\n\n8. The Nawab of Pataudi (MAKP)\n\nIt does appear from all that I read Pataudi and MLJ were soul mates. Finishing off games against Andhra & Kerala in 2 days, so they could go hunting on the 3rd. There are many references to the Hyderabad trio of Abbas Ali Baig, Pataudi & MLJ.\n\nBut it was a mishapen friendship, from what I could gather.\n\nThe telling comment on their relationship is in the chapter penned by MLJ’s wife Jayanthi (aka Junie):\n\nI laughed again recently when I read his letters from New Zealand mentioning that Tiger Pataudi used to read my letters too. What rapport they must have had, though I always felt that Tiger was a selfish man. But both of us loved him dearly and were used to his eccentricities.\n\nLater in the book, there is this:\n\nWhatever his terms with the establishment, Jai was ever the player’s man, supporting some even against his own interests. Some believe that inviting Pataudi to play for Hyderabad cost Jai’s own career dearly.\n\nDespite all that tension, it comes across that MLJ and MAKP were wing mates. With MLJ as the giver and MAKP as the taker. In his last days on the death bed, MAKP visited MLJ:\n\n… Tiger Pataudi also came from the capital to bid goodbye to his old chum, a valiant gesture from one mortally scared of death himself. Pleasantly surprised to see Tiger, Jai got out of bed to give him a big hug.\n\n9. West Indians imported by the BCCI\n\nI loved the story on how the West Indian Roy Gilchrist after starting a riot (doing a Cantona on a spectator) in Calcutta in a 1962–63 Ranji Trophy game and with the rest of his Hyderabad teammates fled the ground in fear, Roy Gilchrist decided to walk back to the hotel. Apparently, he got back to the hotel without a scratch — as he broke into a calypso jig that calmed the Bengali mob.\n\nBut what is a West Indian doing in a Ranji Trophy game? Apparently, “the BCCI in a bid to bolster Indian batting and groom pace bowlers, imported four West Indian bowlers — C. Stayers for Bombay and West Zone, C. Watson fr Delhi and North Zone, Lester King for Bengal and East Zone, Gilchrist for Hyderbad and South Zone — to play in the knockout phase of the 1962–63 Ranji Season”.\n\nThere is an account of Roy Gilchrist had most batsmen trembling — “Not surprisingly, parents of Bengal players had their sons insured for the match against Hyderabad. Many of them wore sponge pads to protect their chest and high”.\n\nMuch later in the book, there is yet another Roy Gilchrist story: “India’s the funniest country in the world,” he once declared to them. As heads looked up in query, he explained his thesis: “It’s only here that women remain virgins till they are 40, maan.”\n\n10. His love of the drink & women\n\nConsidering that it is co-written by his wife Jayanthi Jaisimha, the book makes open references to MLJ’s friendly relationships with various women — hook ups in the West Indies, friends of friends all over India and film stars as well. Sharmila Tagore being one. Apparently MLJ was her first interest. Nice little story of Suchitra Sen and a champagne bottle. & Tanuja, apparently, an unabashed fan. There is something about Hyderabadi batsmen and Calcutta!\n\nTowards the end of the book, names of 10 different women are dropped. Was the frankness just a liberal confession of his weakness or an attempt at getting back at some of these people, one will never know.\n\nMLJ loved his drink. Drink with friends, drinks at the club, drinks after a day of cricket and many a time, the morning before. Drinks after a day of commentary and drinks with friends in the dead of night. Anytime and all the time, till the day he died. But as MLJ says, the problem was never with the liver.\n\n11. Net Net\n\nThere are many other stories in the book of MLJ’s involvement with domestic cricket and later as a manager/selector with the Indian national team.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the book doesn’t give me much insight into MLJ the batsman. I have youtubed MLJ many a time, but there is, understandably, nothing. His international test statistics (source: Statsguru, cricinfo.com) are as follows:\n\nMat Runs HS BatAv 100 50 W BB BowlAv 5w Ct St39 2056 129 30.68 3 12 9 2/54 92.11 0 17 0"
