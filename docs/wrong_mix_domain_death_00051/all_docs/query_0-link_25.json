        "text": "Two films that have marked your life for better or for worse…\n\nThere are many films that have marked my life, I could not mention just two. But I remember with special attention and affection movies like: Twin Peaks, The birds, Enemy, Donnie Darko, among many other great movies.\n\nWhat do you think about Acting/ filmmaking schools?\n\nThere is no doubt that acquiring tools that make you a bigger and better artist will always be a positive thing, I can also point out that in some cases acting schools give you discipline. Although I also know that there are great actors who have not gone through any acting school. I believe that throughout life you should never stop learning.\n\nHave you ever hated your ambition?\n\nThe cinema road is difficult and sometimes you can feel some kind of fear or demotivation, but I have never thought of walking away from this way.\n\nFrancois Truffaut used to think that \"Film Lovers are sick people”… was he right?\n\nI admire Truffaut's work very much and I believe that cinema requires a degree of madness, obsession, passion and commitment to tell great stories.\n\nClose your eyes…if I say “Cinema” what do you see?\n\nReality builder\n\nWho’s the Director\\Actor\\Writer that taught you the most?\n\nThinking of only two people is too difficult, I admire a lot the work of great directors like: Hitchcock, Kubrick, Lynch, Truffaut, Cuaron, Aronofsky, Villeneuve, among many others. I think I have learned a lot from all of them along with other great directors!\n\nAbout your job, tell us your biggest dream and your worst nightmare…\n\nMy biggest dream is to never stop making films and to strive to tell good stories. I don't know what my worst nightmare is, I don't think I think about it. In the worst moments I'm always willing to keep working, try something new and keep learning.\n\nHow important is to have a good Cinematographic Culture?\n\nI think it is very important to generate language and have references, but I also think it is very important to learn from everything you can in life. All knowledge is a tool that in the future can be for your life and also to tell a good story in a reliable way.\n\nWhat would you like to improve as a Filmmaker\\Actor\\Writer?\n\nEvery job is really a new challenge. I think you should always be thinking of new ways to continue the work, whether it's improving technical equipment. Research in working with directing actors is something I'm also very interested in.\n\nA big producer give you the chance to direct\\to play (in) the remake of one of your favorite black and white Movie (if you have one)… what film do you choose?\n\nThe movie is in color but I love it the Birds by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nFilm Industry it’s a tough place and sometimes is normal to feel lost and discouraged… who’s the person that keeps you motivated?\n\nMy partner in the production company Ignacio verdugo is the one I have always worked side by side with. Then we were joined by a new partner, the actor Italo Spotorno. Without a doubt, my greatest support is my work team.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock said: \"To make a good film you need 3 things: The script, the script and the script\". Do you agree with him?\n\nI totally agree that a good script work makes it much easier to work and of course to get a good result. The script is the way forward for a whole team.\n\nWhat’s your most ambitious project for the future?\n\nTogether with Ignacio Verdugo and Italo Spotorno we are working on the pre-production of an interesting feature film. We hope it will be the first of many that will allow us to grow as a production company Go.Films.\n\nDo you think that sadness or at least melancholy let be more creative?\n\nPersonally, I believe that all life experiences serve to grow, but the hardest experiences are clearly the ones that mark us and demand from us a greater capacity to overcome, therefore emotions like sadness clearly leave us something to say, which can be channeled as a creative process.\n\nWhat do you wish to yourself as a Filmmaker\\Actor \\Writer?\n\nA man who never limits his imagination and the desire to tell stories with which he can reach different people. Considering that cinema is not only a means of entertainment, it could also be a way of making us better people. Furthermore, it can create a connection with people who are also with you, in the same room, at the same time. This happens as a result of the message transmitted by the film itself, which, in most cases, are similar to your reality.\n\nWho's your biggest fan?\n\nI think it's too early for me to have a fan just yet. I believe the person who has liked my work the most is a tie between my brother and one of my good friends, Nicki. He can notice my style and catch my influences before anyone else, even in my drawings. He actually played one of the thugs in my film Safehouse and has a main role in our upcoming film “The Gallowed.”\n\nWhat brings you inspiration the most?\n\nWell I've had a paracosm since childhood. So I've always had full length movies playing in my head non-stop. I’d sit there in class and just watch movies in my head and draw them. I still use my paracosm to this day and that classroom habit has evolved into screenwriting and storyboarding.\n\nWhich actor or director would you like to work with?\n\nFor actors that's an easy one, Shamier Anderson.\n\nFor the director I went back and forth over this for a while, Zack Snyder.\n\nHave you ever seen a film that was better than the book?\n\nI liked Oldboy the Korean adaptation better than the Manga, I also think Blade Runner is a solid example. Shawshank too.\n\nWhat's the movie that taught you the most?\n\nGood Time by the Safdie brothers. I would not have attempted to make my own film until I saw that movie. I love it and it inspired me to try to make a good movie regardless of what your money or resources are. It taught me to get out there and figure it out.\n\nAbout your artistic career, have you ever had the desire to quit everything?\n\nNope and there have been some really rough days. I had an honest conversation with myself prior to jumping into filmmaking. I told myself that those worst case scenarios imaginable are probably going to happen and if I could accept them, then I could do this. So when those days came around, I took it on the chin and rolled with the punches. It's only part of the game.\n\nOn set what excites you the most?\n\nWatching an actor bring a character to life in a way you didn't fully anticipate is something truly special and I’ll always cherish.\n\nAnd what scares you the most ?\n\nNot being able to finish bringing all of these stories to life. I have a long list of stories that I set out to make.\n\nDid anyone ever tell you weren't good enough?\n\nI went to drama school relatively late in life I was 35 and a couple told me obviously you will have to lose weight for television and an agency who wanted me to sign for them said we don’t have any fat girls on our books yet. Not exactly what you want to hear but I didn’t let them influence me at all.\n\nHow can you stay focused on your goal?\n\nIt is not always easy to stay focused especially as a mum and wife and working to pay bills between acting jobs. I like to do courses or low paid projects just to be around creative people and that helps regenerate my focus.\n\nHave you ever had a breakdown because of your Job?\n\nI have never had a breakdown because of my job. I think starting later in life has helped keep me grounded. When I did Children of Men it was a great job with great actors but I still had to come home and cook fish fingers for my boys.\n\nTalent is a blessing or a curse?\n\nTalent is a blessing\n\nWhat would you like to improve about yourself as an\n\nactor/director/screenplayer?\n\nMourning Coffee was my first attempt I would like to do more in different genres. I would like to do a comedy and a horror film. At some point in my career I would like to direct but happy to be in front of camera right now.\n\nWhat's the worst critic you have received?\n\nThis was during an opera (I was acting not singing) and director told me not to put any personality into the role and that the show was not about me. I felt hurt and thought that was what I was supposed to do but he wanted robots not creatives, but you learn to do what your director wants.\n\nIf you weren't an actor/director/screenplayer what would you like to be?\n\nHonestly as a child I wrote and performed plays and danced it was part of my life and performing is in my blood. If I was not an actor I would have loved to be an Olympic gymnast or professional sports woman.\n\nA day without a movie is...\n\nA day without a movie is a day of reality\n\nDid anyone ever tell you weren't good enough?\n\nNot to my face of course. I have a tendency to be my own worst critic especially if my work was passed over by a jury. I have also considered, however, that perhaps the work was not what the jury was looking for and perhaps their judgment did not reflect negatively on my abilities. A lot of times, though, my responses, arrogantly or interestingly enough, are that “not good enough” is actually on the jury’s end. I also tend to ponder on what makes me that good so that I excel over other filmmakers.\n\nHow can you stay focused on your goal?\n\nI focus best on goals that I set for myself. I have natural strengths of perseverance and tenacity which helps anchor my focus. I am a Capricorn and that talks about something inside me. I can put it this way: my naturally born dominant personality trait is where my focus is. When goals are set by others, I am able to focus inwardly, get to a calm place and meditate on ways to achieve the goal. This enables me to achieve satisfying results.\n\nHave you ever had a breakdown because of your Job?\n\nI have, unfortunately, or rather, fortunately. You know, failure makes a person learn to not fail next time or next few times. Like all people in the arts, I have experienced major blows in my career. My debut feature film, “Green Green Leaves of Home”, was scheduled to move on to the pre-production stage when I was suddenly notified by the production company that the project had been placed on hold which created a very anxious and unknown fate. I never learned the reason for this, and the film was restarted but after a year had passed. The next breakdown was more depressing because I literally sank into undiagnosed depression. It was when “Be My Valentine” that I would direct hit the obstacle of indecisiveness from the higher up even though the screenplay was recognized and well in place. As months dragged on, the project that I had been waiting for in seven years seemed dead in everybody’s mind and I had nowhere to fight, so I was lost and began to stay in my own corner at home with no desire to speak, eat, and sleep in bed, even though I still went to work for the Taiwan’s largest movie company, which had committed to investing in the film at issue.\n\nThis situation was beyond my ability to control, and I spiraled into an acute depression which affected my relationship with myself and with those who were dear to me as they were suffering from my suffering. I can’t recall exactly how long my depression and hopelessness lasted, but it was a short period of time before I sank further. So, I finally got back on my feet thanks to my immediate family’s quiet but strong moral support. Since this point, I had no choice but push the film to realize using all the power I had, and I did turn the fate of the film. “Be My Valentine” later went on to win at Houston International Film Festival. My good sister suggested this English title for the film, by the way.\n\nTalent is a blessing or a curse?\n\nI believe it is a blessing. Blessing can later become a curse. Perhaps it's how one uses their talent. Any talent can become a curse if not seen, discovered, or used wisely. Even if talent is dismissed or overlooked, I try to remain positive and not let that sadden me. But honestly, that shall always sadden a real talent.\n\nWhat would you like to improve about yourself as director/screenplayer?\n\nAs a long-time writer/director in cinema and video, I rarely act in front of a camera. I might be capable of doing that but may not be as good as being a writer/director. Writing and directing all require accumulation of experience, even when you start off as a prodigy.\n\nAs a director, I regret that I did not discover or establish my directing style much sooner. I had been a good cinematic director even when I was making something for TV. I never enjoyed taking on too conventional ways for my narratives, which at times were not consumed well enough for a regular TV program audience. I never regret that. I have an experimental or avant-garde cinema learning background, always infusing a touch of that abstraction in my story telling either or in fiction and non-fiction genres. Looking ahead, I will improve myself by being true to that inclination rather than complying with other influences. I wish to gain total independence as a director by producing my own films (which I have been doing with my non-profit, Memory Community, movie memoir projects) and making authentic art films as a mark of my directorship.\n\nIn terms of writing, I have two stories to tell. One is I have previously written scripts in my native language (Chinese, more traditional than simplified Chinese). The other one is I am writing scripts now in English language which I have adopted, so I am working to improve my vocabulary capacity, grammar accuracy, awareness of slang, and to then better articulate myself in English when script writing. Since languages are always my strong suit, I would love to see myself master the latter soon.\n\nWhat's the worst critic you have received?\n\nI recollect only one over the span of my four-decade long filmmaking career. Although I don't recall where the critique was published, the harshness is still felt. At the time, I did not take the criticism too seriously. Because? Because I had been an influential film reviewer/critic before I transitioned myself into a writer/director, and I didn't believe the critic who likely hailed from Singapore, where commercial movies were heavily influencing the industry, \"got\" my film (“Be My Valentine”). I felt the critic could not grasp my narrative structure which is not “from the beginning to the end”, per se, and the non-linear storytelling style was denounced as \"chaotic\". By the name printed I would say the critic was a man, but I could be wrong. Anyway, to this day, I still think the critique was not a convincing film review. But I may be biased.\n\nIf you weren't a director/screenplayer what would you like to be?\n\nI may want to be a professional writer focusing on writing poetry. In addition to being a director, I am also a writer, having published books on cinema (“For the Love of Cinema”, “For the Sake of Cinema”, “For the Dream of Cinema”, and the forthcoming “For the Pursuit of Cinema”), collected writings of my father and also poetry under the name of Zhou Doubt (Chinese/English bilingual poetry books collaborated by Debi Rivera, namely, “Poems & Ballads from the House of Drifting Clouds”, and the forthcoming “People Who Are Poetry” - working title).\n\nI have also an interest in being in a secret service or intelligence work, being a forensic detective which was inspired by Dr. Henry Lee, the world-renowned forensic scientist and I had adapted his books into a feature screen story, “Hands in Blood”, which was set for Hollywood, or work as a detective in force or in private. I am detail oriented and have tremendous curiosity and imagination. I like poetry’s condensation and dislike injustice and unfairness, so all of these other careers would be a way for me to address that.\n\nIf Cinema was a color, what would it be?\n\nI hope I can choose not merely one color, but they would be black and white. “Signed, Baba” is construed as a B/W art film in feature length even though the multi-awarded screenplay does not have too many pages. For being a will-to-be B/W film, “Signed, Baba” is not for the sake of being “retro\". It is all the more for the legitimacy of the story as it is told in a way that only black and white can handle the weight (not necessarily suggesting heaviness or darkness.) I will have to make the screenplay into an actual film for you to see.\n\nA day without a movie is...\n\nTo be truly frank with the hypothesis, a day without a movie remains a day…as it is or largely is, as it was before cinema was invented, and will be in some future someday when there is no longer \"cinema\".\n\nRemember the most recent global epidemic and the human crisis from that, COVID-19? When that sort of extreme human disaster occurs, essential needs are the only legitimate necessity that any individuals who want to survive need, regardless of their vaccination theory.\n\nIf someone offered you to direct/write in/a movie that you despise but that for sure will make you rich and famous...would you accept the job?\n\nI’m not going to be untruthful here. In that scenario, I would accept the job on the condition that I have the authority to turn my despair into my hope. I believe in trying before dismissing an offer and remain hopeful, I can find a way to make myself proud of my work in the end.\n\nIn another scenario where it has no wiggle room in any respect of the offer, I certainly would wave “Goodbye” to the offeror. I have turned down a few offers like that before. At this point of my life, I am more certain that I would not direct anything just for the sake of making a self-meaningless movie or a few dollars more.\n\nWhat's your greatest ambition?\n\nNo more “greatest ambition” for me now. Been there, done that. I am comfortable where I am. But it’s unlike losing vivid self-expectation. At this time of my life and career, I have no greater ambition other than dedicating myself to the cinema art as it is true for me, to go at my own pace, give it the benefit of all of my experience and lessons I've learned from the past, and use strategies more wisely from learning which has been consolidated with time and self-brainstorming.\n\nWhat's your biggest fear?\n\nAdmittedly, I fear my own and my dear ones’ death (whether it be untimely death, accidental death, death by suicide or by victimization.) I am working on it to not let the fear become my biggest fear.\n\nI fear (I hate actually) being misunderstood, wrongfully accused, and ignored for no reason. I do not dwell on any of these; however, as I consider myself to be courageous and adventurous. I do worry and get anxious over engagements or commitments on short notice sometimes due to having to make hasty choices. I’m much more of a planner, contemplator, and critical thinker than a reactionary, or quick wit.\n\nDoes music help you to play/direct, write?\n\nMusic is one thing I don’t like not to have for my whole life. It is also one thing I don’t like about myself about not being able to make music. I could learn as it is never too late, of course. Yes, music is very important in my creative process. As I write, I always play music. The external sounds do not disturb my inner voice as I am creating something on the monitor screen. As I visualize those words, the music becomes a nearly silent environment in which my whole mind and body is immersed.\n\nSpeaking of music in my works, I appreciate less music, though. My current project, \"Signed, Baba\", will not have any prominent scores during the entire body of the film. This approach is an organic derivation from the story's invitation. The quiet narrative will echo the content perfectly. I’m now in agreement with Seattle- based noted international Chinese singer/songwriter Kelang Huang and her musician boyfriend George Wiederkehr on this future film’s minimalistic score.\n\nYou have the chance to make a Silent movie, what's your message to the audience?\n\nI invite you to please come to watch \"Signed, Baba\". I promise that you will get a better answer to this question from me (my film) than any I could possibly want to give right here and right now. Allow me to save my message until the film “Signed, Baba” is effectively available for the audience to watch and feedback.\n\nI’ll just add this: I am a man of few spoken words in my real and imaginary life.\n\nShare your speech if you should win an Oscar....\n\nI do not feel that at this point in my life, an Oscar or two are within my reach; therefore, I have no words for an Oscar speech. I understand the Oscars are historically significant, but at the same time, I am open to welcoming European film festivals to appreciate my work, “Signed, Baba”, which is happening as we speak. I am so grateful.\n\nAre you on IMDb?\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm5685139/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk\n\nTwo films that have marked your life for better or for worse…\n\nTwo films that have marked my life for better ( I will ignore the worse)\n\nJurassic Park :\n\nBeen in love with VFX and the on screen magic from the moment I saw the film. I was in second grade when I saw it and have watched it probably more than a hundred times since then. Few years ago I got watch an indepth behind the scenes video of how Jurassic Park was made and the effort and dedication and enthusiasm with which everyone brought the project to life is contagious and inspirational. Jurassic Park made me want to tell stories with such amazing on screen visuals.\n\nInception :\n\nWatched it more than a hundred times trying to understand every little detail to unravel the mystery of the final shot with the spinning top. What a film by Nolan. Simply outstanding story telling from all perspectives and departments. I have always been fascinated by the question of what is reality and the way in which the movie explores the concept of dreams and multiple layers of dreams and how easy it is get lost in the dreams is simply too good. Nolan pitched the movie in 2002 but it only got released in 2008 .Shows how much time and thought he put into each and every moment of the film which itself has many layers to it. Films like INCEPTION happen only once in a millenium and it must be truly a blessing for the talents like Leonardo dicaprio , Hanz Zimmer , Nolan , Wally Pfister , Joseph Gordon-Levitt etc to have come together and brough the film to life. Inception has hade a huge impact postive on my life.\n\nWhat do you think about Acting/ filmmaking schools?\n\nFor those who can afford to go to such schools it truly is a blessing .One can definitely build a solid foundation before venturing out into the world of cinema to begin their career. However for those who don’t have access to such need not be disheartened as they can also definitely learn on their own and make it big.\n\nHave you ever hated your ambition?\n\nI have never , ever hated my ambition .However I have hated the circumstances and situatiuons I have been in which feel like a hurdle or a block to fulfill my ambition .The only thing that has kept me sane and kept me going even when I been down is my ambition and my goal.\n\nFrancois Truffaut used to think that \"Film Lovers are sick people”… was\n\nhe right?\n\nI wouldn’t say so. If Francois said that then perhaps that’s kind of people he knew and perhaps he even refused to see the good in people who he might have come across. Just like any other industry in the world the Film industry is also made by people so there are shades of all colors in the industry. It isn’t right to outright insult and demean the efforts and hard work put in by millions of people in the industry overall several decades. Francois should have changed his company and he needed to have better friends.\n\nClose your eyes…if I say “Cinema” what do you see?\n\nThe moment I hear the word Cinema I see amazing visuals from movies like Avatar , Jurassic Park , Batman Begins etc and some from my own which I am yet to make. I see a million emotions being played on a big screen in front of me.\n\nWho’s the Director\\Actor\\Writer that taught you the most?\n\nWriter/Director that has taught me the most is Christopher Nolan ( Also Spielberg and Cameron). I simply love the depth ,attention to detail and the overall quality of all his films. The best example to illustrate this would be the movie Prestige which appeared to contain a very simple story on first viewing but after several viewings I just keep finding more and more to each and every element of the story . A script with such deep layers and critical thinking must have required unshattered and unwavering dedication from Nolan. Nolan must have spent several years crafting each and every miniscule element of the script to have a reference to every other moment in the story. The beauty of Prestige simply cannot be explained in few words .Such works of pure dedication and passion inspire me and motivate me to do my best.\n\nAbout your job, tell us your biggest dream and your worst nightmare…\n\nMy biggest dream is to make trilogies/franchises on the scale of Avatar. To build such a huge universe with meaningful and thought provoking stories and characters.\n\nMy worst nightmare is that I would not be able to complete by list of films that I want to make.\n\nHow important is to have a good Cinematographic Culture?\n\nMovies wouldn’t exist without cinematography. So having a good cinematographic culture is very important and an absolute must. Beautiful and wonderful stories would just be limited to books if there was no cinematography.\n\nWhat would you like to improve as a Filmmaker\\Actor\\Writer?\n\nI would like to improve my ability to establish good contacts and good communication so that I can bring in good talent into my life to make the movies I have in my mind.\n\nA big producer give you the chance to direct\\to play (in) the remake of\n\none of your favorite black and white Movie (if you have one)… what film\n\ndo you choose?\n\nI would love to direct the remake of 12 angry men. The film has also served as a inspiration for me as it thought me how much can be achieved in a single room with limited cast. Sidney Lumet.s direction and execution of the concept is beyond brilliant and I would love to direct a modern day adaptation of the same.\n\nFilm Industry it’s a tough place and sometimes is normal to feel lost\n\nand discouraged… who’s the person that keeps you motivated?\n\nWhen I feel lost and discouraged I look to the works of others in the industry to keep me motivated. Sometimes its big films like Avatar and Inception that keep me motivated as I remind myself of the effort and perseverance required to embark on such big projects and complete them with perfection. Sometimes it’s the small movies that also give me hope and act as a ray of sunshine that I don’t need a big budget to make my first movie and I can make a really good film with a small budget and tell a really good story.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock said: \"To make a good film you need 3 things: The\n\nscript, the script and the script\". Do you agree with him? What’s your\n\nmost ambitious project for the future?\n\nHitchcock has also been my inspiration and I watched several movies directed by him. Although the script is important it is even more important to have a good talent who can understand and execute the script to its full potential. While a script is definitely important it is even more important to have a good director and team who can breathe life into the script and create the onscreen magic.\n\nDo you think that sadness or at least melancholy let be more creative?\n\nI don’t think sadness can help with creativity. I have been at my creative best when I have been extremely happy and thrilled after experiencing my favorite films. When I have been sad it affects my entire system and I have to recover from the sadness to be able to work. So sadness or melancholy isn’t the best help for creativity.\n\nWhat do you wish to yourself as a Filmmaker\\Actor \\Writer?\n\nMy wish is to keep improving year after year and keep telling stories on the big screen forever and I wish to be surrounded by amazing talent / finance / society and health that supports me in my vision.\n\nCan you tell us about the way you work ?\n\nMy process is intuitive. Other than the starting point, I didn’t know where I am going. I create by experimenting in my studio, alone with my intuitions and obsessions. I manipulate myself all the elements of my videos : accessories, sets, costumes, lighting, etc., and I embody the characters who evolve in them. In addition, I also do the editing (footage and sound). Like an open channel, I let myself be guided without being bound by realism. The \"story\" unfolds gradually with the integration of the different components. I consider that I work with videographic material in the same way as any other material: juxtaposing, associating, superimposing elements to end up making a poetically coherent whole. I work alone, which leaves a lot of freedom and allows me to immerse myself in my personal universe. If I was to deal with a team, even a small one, I would have to structure in advance my process by preparing a strict work schedule, which is not my way of doing things. Which would make me feel less free to experiment. Although I resort to various creative avenues, I have no fear that my whole production will be disjointed. My realizations come from the same source, they are different manifestations of a single creative drive. I remain the same person, with her own sensitivity and vision of the world. When I start a new project, I have confidence that it will fit into my overall approach\n\nWhy did you choose specifically to make experimental videos ?\n\nI choose that practice not to be bound to realism. And the explanation lies in tis word : “art”. Simply because I am an artist and for me, art (regardless of the medium) is a way of looking at reality differently in order to expose it from other angles, using symbolic language. I don’t want to recreate the world as I live it every day. I don’t find it so appealing with its share of violence, iniquity, problems and routine.\n\nHowever, this is not an escape attitude. On the contrary, I remain immersed in the social context in which I inhabit. I knead the elements which compose our universe and, like magically manipulated dice, I rearrange them in an unexpected order. My eyelids vibrate in front of the unknown that is taking shape. I aspire to broader horizons.\n\nTwo films that have marked your life for better or for worse...\n\nA: For better - The film that influenced me the most was the first feature film ever made by the great French playwright Georges Méliès, “Le Voyage dans la Lune” from 1902. As you know in this film the line between theatre and film is almost invisible, if you would not consider the Cinematography. The director's bold decisions, ideological intensity and symbolism still have their relevance today. Méliès managed in the first feature film ever to fully reveal the profound meaning of the classic three-act structure of the film in just 15 minutes. The ingenious dramaturgy of the short film inspires not only me to this day.\n\nFor worse - If you mean worse feelings about the film's context, which reflected reality, I would love to highlight Steven Spielberg's masterpiece “Schindler's List”. The action takes place during World War II and is shown so realistically that me like the rest of the audience, felt myself inside those gruesome events and experienced them along with the characters. The impression after this film makes me think over the barbarity of mankind.\n\nIn your film “BETTER LOVE” you reflect the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Why did you choose that specific title?\n\nIn this film, I thought about a solution that would allow the characters to find happiness despite their originally opposing positions. People meet and fall in love, regardless of political opinions or conflicts. The main idea is that even despite the vital contradictions between countries, love wins ever. My message is “BETTER LOVE”... than war. That's probably why the film won so much attention by audience and received so many awards and nominations.\n\nWhat do you think about acting/filmmaking schools?\n\nI think acting/filmmaking schools are a necessary step in the educational process. All schools provide students with the academic structure and knowledge about filmmaking. It is up to each person to decide how to use this knowledge and develop their skills.\n\nHave you ever hated your ambition?\n\nAs for ambition, it has no place on the set for it. Moreover, on set I try to balance the ambitions of the actors and the crew and meantime always being open to their new ideas. During the shooting I don't interfere much with the work of my crew and actors. Sometimes I set accents if I have to.\n\nFrancois Truffaut used to think that \"Film Lovers are sick people\"... was he right?\n\nIn one his documentaries Francois Truffaut showed with humor how different problems arise during the shooting. Solving all these challenges and problems requires a lot of enthusiasm and effort. I suppose this sentence applies to everyone who makes movies. You have to love your job a lot and be a \"film lover\" and a \"sick\" person to wake up every morning with joy and set out to solve these problems....If this phrase refers to the audience, I assume he meant that the film should leave a healing effect on the viewer.\n\nIt is also my opinion that movies should make us empathize, rejoice, and awake different emotions.\n\nClose your eyes...if I say \"Cinema\" what do you see?\n\nI am dreaming a lot and I can say in the words of John Lennon, \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one”. I mean, movies contain a dramatic character. And every drama has a chain of escalating conflicts that tend to evoke different feelings and emotions. Movies are subjective solutions to different problems, which are much stronger than the strength and capabilities of the characters' personalities. It is these challenges that show, educate, and strengthen the character of the antagonists and protagonists. To me cinema is the solution to all problems and challenges, which should ultimately inspire the viewer to this or that thought and make them think. Long story short - cinema takes the viewer away from his everyday life, stimulates his senses and perceptions, and brings him right back to his reality with a new perspective. Thus I, as a filmmaker, when I close my eyes, wish that my films would make the viewer think about ordinary feelings that, at first glance, are not quite obvious.\n\nWho's the Director\\Actor\\Writer that taught you the most?\n\nThe director who has had the greatest influence on me is Quentin Spielberg von Trier. The screenwriter who most impressed me was Charlie Koppola Kieślowski. My favorite actress/actor is Marlon M.Streep Pacino.\n\nAbout your job, tell us your biggest dream and your worst nightmare...\n\nThank you for your interesting question, which I partially already answered.\n\nMy biggest dream as a filmmaker is to make films using new technologies, to delight the audience with the story of the film and to enrich it with new emotions. Obviously I also wish that, thanks to “BETTER LOVE”, at least one war would end. As for the nightmare, as I mentioned, I no longer wish to perform in several departments during the shooting. I don't recommend it to anyone either. For me it was a real nightmare.\n\nHow important is it to have a good Cinematographic Culture?\n\nThe development of cinematography in different countries since the beginning of the 20th century has taken place in different ways. In some countries the focus was on dramaturgy, in others on entertaining the viewer, and in some countries on revealing a particular story. In addition, cinema has undergone a number of key technical changes - from black-and-white to color, from mute to sound, from analog to digital, from digital to computer graphics, etc. Despite all that noted, the core of cinematography has hardly changed but we still continue to wonder, sympathize, and admire our loved characters in films. But the fact remains. Without the development of cinematic culture around the world, it would be impossible to create these emotions.\n\nWhat would you like to improve as a Filmmaker/Actor/Writer?\n\nI would wish everyone to be more open about sharing their experiences with each other. That would help all parties in the film industry. Also, I would wish to be less pompous in the professionalism achieved.\n\nA big producer gives you the chance to direct\\to play (in) the remake of one of your favorite black and white Movie (if you have one)… what film do you choose?\n\n“Le Voyage dans la Lune” by Georges Méliès.\n\nFilm Industry it's a tough place and sometimes is normal to feel lost and discouraged... who's the person that keeps you motivated?\n\nI find motivation in talented people, no matter of their profession. Talent and enthusiastic work expressed in one form or another have always fascinated me and still do.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock said, \"To make a good film you need three things: The script, the script and the script. Do you agree with him?\n\nI'm very happy to tell you that “BETTER LOVE” won recently on the Frida Kalo Festival's Alfred Hitchcock Award for Best Action Film. Alfred Hitchcock is still the inimitable master of suspense. The film is created, as is commonly said, in the head, on the set and in the editing room. Since Hitchcock stuck to the script he created in his mind, on the set and in the editing room. In that case his expression is absolutely correct. But every director has his own individual style.\n\nWhat's your most ambitious project for the future?\n\nMy most ambitious project for the future is my every next project.\n\nDo you think that sadness or at least melancholy let be more creative?\n\nI recently read a psychological study that the most creative people who have left the world a cultural legacy have experienced profound mental turmoil. My point is that talented people who are able to express themselves in a creative way produce works that leave an indelible mark.\n\nCreativity is a form of expression, but the content is still the idea that the creator wants to transit.\n\nWhat do you wish to yourself as a Filmmaker/Actor/Writer?\n\nI wish myself to have more time and budget for my projects.\n\nFor you, a film is...\n\nA story in multiple layers. The image, the sound, the underlying message. An art form in which you play a game with where you focus attention, or with the choices in what you show or don't show.\n\nWhat do you feel when you’re directing?\n\nThat I bring a story to life. A creative that creates something, a magical feeling.\n\nYou can go to the Movies with an actor/director/screenplayer that you love. What kind of movie do you choose and with who you're gonna whatch it?\n\nI like horror, thriller, action and drama, basically films that have everything in them. Yet in this case, I would go to a historical adventure or action film. And then I’ld love to go with Ridley Scott. He is a self-made director who does not shy away from the bombastic, and I would be too happy to analyse with him the choices that were made in the film.\n\nAudrey Hepburn used to say \"Nothing is Impossible\", what do you think about that?\n\nI think this is true. There are too many examples of people doing something extraordinary, from small to big.\n\nCan you live just of your passion?\n\nNo. (Not yet.)\n\nWhat's more important talent or luck?\n\nTalent.\n\nYou must go to a desert island but you can bring with you just one movie...\n\nWhat an incredibly difficult question. I would maybe bring my old guilty pleasure: Pirates by Roman Polanski. As a child, I re-watched this film several times and enjoyed the setting, the sound and the action. Looking at it objectively now, I probably don't like it as much as I did then, but the childhood sentiment is too big. So yes, that one will be it.\n\nHave you ever accepted a a movie to direct/a script to write even if you didn't like the project?\n\nActually, no. Sometimes I co-write a film that I would never make as a director myself. But I find that even then I enjoy creating something and contributing ideas (something I also do as a screenwriter).\n\nTwo films that have marked your life for better or for worse…\n\nIt would have to be The Godfather and Psycho\n\nWhat do you think about Acting/ filmmaking schools?\n\nI am very biased as I am a Film teacher at Trebas Institute Montreal, Filmmaking schools give you the opportunity to fail and to learn from it whereas outside of school you fail and are not sure of why you failed\n\nHave you ever hated your ambition?\n\nNever not even one day.\n\nFrancois Truffaut used to think that \"Film Lovers are sick people”… was\n\nhe right?\n\nI think in order to make great art every artist must be an addict to passion\n\nClose your eyes…if I say “Cinema” what do you see?\n\nArt in its purest form\n\nWho’s the Director\\Actor\\Writer that taught you the most?\n\nDirector, it has to be Alfred Hitchcock, Acto,r Dustin Hoffman, and for writer, I would have to choose two, 1) Charlie Kauffman and 2) Billy Wilder\n\nAbout your job, tell us your biggest dream and your worst nightmare…\n\nTo make a film that can last the test of time and is studied for years to come would be my biggest dream and my worst nightmare would be the loss of my memory. My Grandfather suffered from Alzheimer's and I saw what it did to him.\n\nHow important is to have a good Cinematographic Culture?\n\nIt is a must, and you must grow it every day, study the greats watch International films, and watch indie films.\n\nWhat would you like to improve as a Filmmaker\\Actor\\Writer?\n\nI would like to improve as a writer and as a Director to take more risks\n\nTwo films that have marked your life for better or for worse\n\nFor better, the two films that had the most profound influence on me would be The Wild Bunch because there's been nothing as visually stunning and beautifully violent since it was released in 1969. The other film that comes to mind is Lawrence of Arabia. These two epics are masterfully acted and directed. I've also been heavily influenced by American film noir from the late 1940s and early 1950s. I'm a big dialogue fan, and my influences in that area are Woody Allen, William Goldman, Raymond Chandler, and Elmore Leonard.\n\nWhat do you think about screenwriting schools?\n\nSchools can teach you formatting and technique, but I don't think they can create great storytellers. Many screenwriters believe they can write one or two scripts and be the next William Goldman. I've written 55 screenplays and teleplays and understand it takes years to develop a distinct style. I've recently had my first feature film, Purgatory Station, shot and edited. Additionally, I have two other films slated to go into production later this year. It took me nine years to achieve that goal. So, If you take a screenwriting program, try to get an instructor who has made a good film. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19898834/\n\nHave you ever hated your ambition?\n\nNo. I love it. Though I think I could've made more money going to college right out of high school and focusing more on an average career. However, money was never my first priority. I was a musician who occupied much of my attention but never made me much money. I returned to college in my mid-forties and obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees. Additionally, I have a postgraduate degree from Stanford University. So my ambition has fueled achieving goals at various stages of my life.\n\nFrancois Truffaut used to think that \"Film Lovers are sick people.\" Was Truffaut right?\n\nTaking into consideration Truffaut's meaning, I think it's essential to not only observe life but to live it. I've always been a restless soul and love creating and accomplishing goals. When I die, I want people to say there's not enough room on my tombstone to summarize my accomplishments. So if that makes me a sick person, I'm all in.\n\nClose your eyes. If I say Cinema, what do you see?\n\nI see the old movie theater I went nearly every Saturday as a child and think about the thousands of images that impacted my psyche during my formative years. How do I apply this to screenwriting? I challenge myself to envision a story and then articulate that vision into a cohesive screenplay. Since I was a mid-baby boomer, I was one of the first generations to experience both films and television. In the sixties and early seventies, film and tv profoundly affected my generation. Many of my peers were less focused on conventional careers and more interested in being rock musicians and actors.\n\nWho's the screenwriter that taught you the most?\n\nToo difficult to narrow my answer to one. William Goldman for visual narrative and Woody Allen for dialogue.\n\nAbout your job, tell us your biggest dream and your worst nightmare.\n\nI set goals and do my best to accomplish them. My biggest goal is to get ten films made before I die. My worst nightmare is failing to get more movies made.\n\nHow important is it to have a good working relationship with collaborators?\n\nSince I mostly write, I spend a lot of time alone. I need to be in a peaceful place with music to feel relaxed. As far as collaboration with filmmakers? I think it's essential to be flexible and allow people creative input with your work. Nevertheless, I think it's equally important to defend your writing when you feel a director, actor, or producer is fucking it up.\n\nWhat would you like to improve as a Writer?\n\nDevelop more patience during the creative process. I probably would benefit from spending more time writing a first and second draft. Sometimes, I crank them out too quickly.\n\nIf a big producer allowed you to direct the remake of one of your favorite black-and-white movies (if you have one), What film would you choose?\n\nIt must be a film noir classic if it's a black-and-white film. So I'd love to direct a remake of The Big Steal, which was made in 1949 and starred Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer and was directed by Don Siegal of Dirty Harry fame.\n\nThe film Industry is a tough place, and sometimes it is normal to feel lost and discouraged. Who's the person that keeps you motivated?\n\nIf it's a spec screenplay, I can only rely on myself to stay motivated. And that means reaching into my imagination and tapping into my creative soul. If it's a work-for-hire, then I'm motivated by whoever is paying me and their deadline for completing the work.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock said: \"To make a good film, you need 3 things: The script, the script, and the script\". Do you agree with him?\n\nFilming a movie without a script resembles building a house with no blueprint. So yes, yes, yes! I agree with Hitchcock. There's been a lot of recent talk about Artificial intelligence (AI) replacing screenwriters. I'LL BE IMPRESSED when AI can write a film like Citizen Cain or make a soulful adaptation of War and Peace. I think it'll be a cold day in hell before that happens.\n\nWhat's your most ambitious project for the future?\n\nThe most challenging project for me is doing an adaptation of a novel. The challenge is retaining the book's essence while doing extensive editing and putting your stamp on the work. I've made six adaptations, and the easiest ones involve famous novels with Cribs Notes or other comprehensive, chapter-by-chapter summaries. With these available, it's quicker to drill down to the essence of the story. Nevertheless, each project can have its particular challenges, so working with unfamiliar topics with technical qualities can require extensive research.\n\nDo you think sadness or at least melancholy inspires you to be more creative?\n\nDrawing from my emotions, including melancholy, is not essential to my creative process. Drawing inspiration from my past experience is far more relevant to me. They say, \"Write what you know. However, that's not always possible. In cases where you're in unfamiliar territory, researching your topic becomes more critical. I've written scripts in nearly every genre and appreciate a challenge.\n\nWhat do you wish for yourself as a Writer?\n\nTo create the best work that I can that rings with honesty and truth while also entertaining my audience. And to make several more films over the next few years.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nMost recently, I completed a classic film noir script in the style of Raymond Chandler called A Dangerous World of Possibilities. However, I flipped the genre by crafting a female version of the Phillip Marlowe Detective, Desiree Duncan. She's a former WWII army nurse wounded during a skirmish at a battlefield hospital who also loses her husband in battle. So when she becomes a detective, Desiree is ready to emerge from the wreckage of her damaged life. It draws heavily from late forties noir and neo-noir films like Chinatown and LA Confidential. Here's the logline for the screenplay:\n\nA WWII nurse wins a Silver Star, becomes a private detective, is hired by an heiress to find a missing actress connected to porno, and a mobster blackmailing a Los Angeles Congressman."
