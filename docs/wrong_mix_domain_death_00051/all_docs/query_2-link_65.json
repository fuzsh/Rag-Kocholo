        "text": "Preamble Morning. This World Cup has been such a weird mixture of the magical and the mediocre – and, if you're an England fan, of joy and pain and the sweetest sorrow – that it's hard to know whether to love it or hate it. (To keep my options open I am, as I type, having LOVE and HATE tattoed on each knuckle, Robert Mitchum-style.)\n\nI certainly know how I felt about the tournament when my alarm ripped me from my happy place at 6am this morning – and you can read those four-letter thoughts in Adult OBO, our new post-watershed service that is a bit like late-night Hollyoaks only without, well, y'know – but then, on the way into work, I started to think about the humdinger that awaits us in Nagpur today.\n\nIndia v South Africa is the weightiest clash of the tournament so far. If we roll all cricket up into one big ball, they are undeniably the two best sides in the world. While this match almost certainly means nothing in terms of qualification – both sides could still go out, but it would take an absurd set of results for that to happen – it is a decent chance to put down a marker for the knockout stages, and, in all probability, avoid Australia in the quarter-finals.\n\nIt pits the most formidable batting line-up in the world against the best and most varied bowling attack. Specifically, it gives us the unique thrill of watching one little master, Dale Steyn, take on India's little masters, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag. That's a contest for the ages. If India's innings should be the more exciting, then South Africa's should be the more instructive, for that is where each side's main concern lies: India with their fifth bowler in particular, and South Africa with their unusually fragile lower middle order.\n\nBoth sides have had setbacks, against England of all teams, and whoever loses today will approach the quarter-finals with a fair deal of trepidation. In that respect, and even though it amounts to the same thing, this is psychologically a mustn't-lose game rather than a must-win game. Which is a nice positive note on which to begin today's coverage.\n\nIndia have won the toss and will bat first. They bring in Munaf Patel for Piyush Chawla, while South Africa have sensibly decided not to risk Imran Tahir's injured finger. He is replaced by Johan Botha. I wonder if they will open the bowling with a spinner today or go straight in with Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel.\n\nThe cheer when India won the toss was incredible, almost as loud as when Bangladesh did in Chittagong yesterday. Every World Cup has an innovation, from pinch-hitting to opening the bowling with a spinner; this year it seems to be cheering like a madman when your side wins the toss.\n\nIndia Sehwag, Tendulkar, Gambhir, Kohli, Yuvraj, Dhoni (c/wk), Pathan, Harbhajan, Zaheer, Nehra, Patel.\n\nSouth Africa Smith (c), Amla, Kallis, de Villiers, Duminy, du Plessis, van Wyk (wk), Peterson, Botha, Morkel, Steyn.\n\nSay what you like about the Guardian, but the showers here are to die for, darling. Seriously, they are incredible. I've never understood how some people can live with a weak shower. It's not a hygiene thing, I'm not bothered about that. In fact I'm not sure what it is; I just know that it's very, very important. It's the first thing I look for in a flat. Sure, there's no bed, cooker or fridge, and one of the walls is missing. But the shower runs like a dream. I'll take it.\n\n1st over: India 4-0 (Sehwag 4, Tendulkar 0) It'll be Steyn v Sehwag and Tendulkar. Cricket as nature intended. And the first over is a corker, with a boundary, two near misses and a brilliant piece of fielding. It starts when, for the fifth time in as many games, Virender Sehwag hits the first ball of the innings to the boundary. It wasn't an especially bad delivery from Steyn, but Sehwag launched it over mid on for four. The next ball brings a huge LBW appeal, turned down by the excellent Simon Taufel. I reckon that was just sliding down, and South Africa decide not to review. The third delivery beats the outside edge and misses off stump by a whisker. Sehwag leaves the fourth and then smacks the fifth through extra cover, where Botha makes a wonderful diving save. Finally he is beaten again, feeling outside off stump. \"You may have walked into this,\" begins Robin Hazlehurst, \"but you don't know how people can live with a weak shower? So you're not an England cricket fan then. Honk.\"\n\n2nd over: India 9-0 (Sehwag 8, Tendulkar 1) Graeme Smith has given the new ball to Morne Morkel rather than Johan Botha or Robin Peterson. No messing around with spin today. That has to be the correct move because they will be desperate to get Sehwag with the new ball, and these two bowl well at him. South Africa won't exactly be devastated if they get Tendulkar either. And Morkel should have had Sehwag with his third delivery. It was a beauty, a lifting leg cutter that found the edge, and the ball flew between the keeper van Wyk and Smith at slip, who both watched it go past them to the boundary without moving a muscle. That was definitely van Wyk's catch, because Smith is somewhere between first and second slip. What a let off for Sehwag, and a fine first over from Morkel.\n\n3rd over: India 23-0 (Sehwag 12, Tendulkar 6) A frenetic start to this match continues, with Steyn's second over going for 14! First there were five overthrows for Tendulkar, who took a quick single into the covers and got four bonus runs when Botha's throw went to the boundary. An angry Steyn whistled a good bouncer past Sehwag next up, but the ball after that was filth, on the pads and flicked high over backward square leg for a one-bounce four. The over concluded with a huge LBW shout, again turned down by Simon Taufel. South Africa considered the review for a while but decided against it. This is blistering stuff. Wake up you fools! Look what you're missing!\n\n4th over: India 27-0 (Sehwag 12, Tendulkar 9) South Africa's slightly ragged start continues with a front-foot no-ball from Morkel, although Tendulkar can only heave a single off the resulting free hit. That aside it's another fine over. When Morkel hits that mezzanine length, as he has here, I'm not quite sure what a batsman is supposed to do. \"I know this isn't relevant to this game so much, but thinking about England after yesterday's loss, would it be so bad if they were to be knocked out in the group stage?\" says David Wall. \"They've already done enough in this tournament to single-handedly revive the 50-over format. I imagine them involved in another thrilling loss to the W.Indies and then in the post-match interview Strauss telling Atherton 'Our work here is done', in the manner of the people in Wayne's World stacking crates of melons and carrying a pane of glass backwards and forwards across the road. They may not win the tournament but that doesn't mean that won't have achieved something.\" Well, I don't have plans to go into a bunker for six weeks if they do fail to qualify, but I'd like them to do so. This tournament is wide open so, even though England are completely shattered, it's far from inconceivable that they could win it.\n\n5th over: India 33-0 (Sehwag 17, Tendulkar 10) Sehwag uppercuts Steyn in the air towards third man, where Morkel leaps to attempt the catch, but the flies goes wide of him for a one-bounce four. \"Nice game today,\" says Anand. \"Who are the English going to support? Looking at how Sachin missed the free hit, that might be a way to contain him in the future!\" I can't speak for England, thank goodness, but I'm not supporting anyone. I'm just a fair-minded guy who wants cricket to be the winner.\n\n6th over: India 46-0 (Sehwag 30, Tendulkar 10) That's what you're supposed to do against Morkel. Sehwag, given just a fraction of width, screams the ball through the covers for four. When Sehwag has his eye in, I'm not quite sure what a bowler is supposed to do. Bowl a snorting leg cutter next up that beats the outside edge, I suppose, which is precisely what Morkel has just done. His next ball is too full, however, and Sehwag hammers it back whence it came for four. Two balls later he cleaves a cut to third man for his third boundary of the over. This is seriously high-class cricket. \"Whilst weak showers are a great disappointment, a shower with too much power always gives the impression it could rip off an important part of one's anatomy,\" says Alex Perkins. \"I need to think of future generations of Perkins. This probably belongs in yesterday's riff though.\"\n\n7th over: India 57-0 (Sehwag 37, Tendulkar 14) Graeme Smith turns to his bouncer, Jacques Kallis, in an attempt to suppress this Little Mastery. After two whole dot balls, Sehwag slugs a pull over square leg for four to bring up a rollocking fifty partnership from 41 balls. Tendulkar then walks across his stumps to drag a pull to fine leg for four and make it 11 from the over. Five years ago today, South Africa chased 435 to beat Australia in the highest-scoring ODI of all time. If this continues, that might seem like a jaunty little chase by comparison. \"Does Morne Morkel call his teammates Butthead?\" says Daniel Harris. \"Does he hate manure?\"\n\n8th over: India 70-0 (Sehwag 42, Tendulkar 22) The run-riot continues. Tendulkar has hardly faced a ball – just nine in seven overs before this – but that makes sense because Sehwag is in stunning form and spanks Morkel through mid on for his ninth four. Then, when Tendulkar does get on strike, he picks up consecutive boundaries with two stunning strokes, an on-the-up whap through the cover and a sublime straight drive. Never mind the Guardian showers; that shot really was to die for. Morkel, who has bowled pretty well, has gone for 35 in four overs! \"I'm English and I am supporting India today,\" says Don Wilson. \"In fact I support whoever South Africa are playing as a matter of course - even Australia.\"\n\n9th over: India 77-0 (Sehwag 45, Tendulkar 26) Tendulkar skims a beautifully timed square drive for a three, and then there's another overthrow when Amla's needless shy deflects off the stumps. Still, that's a decent over from Kallis, the second boundaryless over of the innings. \"Only Pathan and Kohli to come,\" says Rahul Nayyar, who obviously doesn't care about Yuvraj, Gambhir, Dhoni and Harbhajan. What an absurd batting line-up. Has there ever been a better top seven in one-day cricket?\n\n10th over: India 87-0 (Sehwag 46, Tendulkar 35) Steyn has switched ends to replace Morkel, which means that lug-baiting, sub-Bo Selecta 'YAHOOOOOOHOOOO' cry we get every time there's a bowling change. Steyn's third ball is short and Tendulkar whirls the bat wristily to send a stunning pull stroke over deep backward square for six What a shot! Those rubber wrists come into play off the last delivery as well, which Tendulkar clips over midwicket for three. He has 35 from 20 balls and is playing exquisitely. \"Not many emails today, huh?\" deduces a man or woman who shall remain nameless.\n\n11th over: India 93-0 (Sehwag 46, Tendulkar 40) South Africa take the bowling Powerplay straight away, an unfathomable piece of autopilot captaincy from Graeme Smith. Tendulkar picks Kallis's slower ball and flips it over midwicket for the 14th boundary of the innings. That aside it's a quiet over, and Kallis has been relatively parsimonious. He's only going at 7.66 per over. \"As an Indian whose teenage years coincided with India's mediocrity in the 90s, I can understand the England fan's frustration with James Anderson,\" says Anand. \"We used to have one such bowler, who would come in when the game was even and then, in a matter of one over, gift it to the opposition. Ironically that bowler, Ajit Agarkar is sitting in the Sky Sports studio!\" Oh man, that is harsh, comparing Anderson with Agarkar. The Burnley Duck might be a fair name for his batting these days – that record-breaking sequence seems a long time ago – but he's a much better bowler.\n\n12th over: India 101-0 (Sehwag 51, Tendulkar 41) The left-arm spinner Robin Peterson is coming on, and if I were him I would have a pulse rate of around 900. Sehwag makes room to lift the second delivery gracefully over cover for four, and in doing so he reaches a frightening half-century from only 44 balls. Two balls later he pushes down the ground for a single to bring up the century partnership from just 71 deliveries. It's been breathtaking. A couple of wides make it another expensive over for South Africa. \"Tendulkar is such a fantastic player,\" says Richard Simpson. \"He is able to watch Sehwag take all the balls, then when it is his turn just ooze class. A fantastic player. If he were a 16-year-old today, would he still get picked? If he had been born in England (or Durban, Madras, Dublin) he'd have been considered too short.\" I don't know about that. There are some potentially very good, maybe even great players, who might not make it for daft reasons, but Tendulkar's brand of genius is undeniable.\n\n13th over: India 111-0 (Sehwag 59, Tendulkar 43) It's spin from both ends, but it'll be JP Duminy rather than Johan Botha. Another bowling change, of course, means another YAHOOHOOHOOO. What is that all about? Does anyone know? I don't understand. It's in nails and chalkboards territory. Duminy's first ball goes for four. Of course it does. Sehwag makes room to play a beautiful back-foot drive. The next ball turns fairly sharply and is edges wide of the keeper for a couple. Singles from each of the last four balls make it another double-figure over. \"No worries at all if you're fed up of plugging these, but our latest Chuck Fleetwood-Smiths World Cup diary is up,\" says Sam Collins. \"It's got Brett Lee looking stupid on a guitar, Kamran Akmal's wicketkeeping guide and a bus being stoned, plus the other usual rubbish....\"\n\nREVIEW! India 117-0 (Tendulkar LBW b Petersen 49) Tendulkar pushes around his pad at Peterson, bringing a huge appeal for LBW. It's turned down by Ian Gould, but South Africa are desperate and go for the review. It's a hopeless review, in truth; the ball did not turn nearly enough and was sliding down the leg side.\n\n14th over: India 119-0 (Sehwag 60, Tendulkar 50) Earlier in the over, AB de Villiers almost took an outrageous running catch to dismiss Tendulkar. He pelted round from long off before diving full length, but he just couldn't hang on. That took Tendulkar to 49 and, after the umpire review, he touched Peterson to short fine leg to reach another awesome fifty, this one from just 33 balls. He is anchoring the innings – at a strike rate of 151.50! Astonishing.\n\n15th over: India 128-0 (Sehwag 62, Tendulkar 57) Tendulkar gives Duminy the charge and drags him miles in the air and over long on for six. \"Oh my goodness!\" says Pommie Mbangwa in the commentary box. Nine from the over and, right here, right now, India are looking at a minimum of 350. A minimum of 350.\n\n16th over: India 137-0 (Sehwag 70, Tendulkar 58) Sehwag is so much more than a chunky hitter, as he shows by playing the most delicate of late cuts for two off Peterson. Then he plays a lovely chip over the covers for his 12th boundary. India are going at 8.55 per over. It's ridiculous. \"This is top cricket, well top batting at least,\" says Phil Rhodes. \"Anyway my point is, it's great to see Sehwag have a cap on for batting against the spinners. It's something which has been slightly lost in the modern game; too frequently batsmen keep their helmets on even against the spinners. Kevin O'Brien was another who was quick to go to the cap against England. Batsman just looks better when batting in caps. Sachin is never going to be regarded as one of the greats until he realises he has to bat in a cap against spinners...\" There was a nice moment when Michael Clarke called for the Baggy Green just before he got a century on Test debut, although he'd have looked a bit daft if he'd then slapped one straight up in the air.\n\n17th over: India 140-0 (Sehwag 72, Tendulkar 59) Now that we are out of the Powerplay, Johan Botha is on for JP Duminy. Is that a tactical decision or cowardice from Botha? Who knows. Anyway, he has Sehwag dropped second ball, a very sharp reaction catch to van Wyk off a top-edged cut stroke. A good over from Botha costs just three.\n\nWICKET! India 142-1 (Sehwag b du Plessis 73) The part-time legspinner Faf du Plessis gives South Africa a bit of relief. Sehwag made room to cut, but the ball skidded on and he sliced it onto the top of the stumps. He made 73 from 66 balls and played marvellously.\n\n18th over: India 144-1 (Tendulkar 61, Gambhir 1) Only four runs from du Plessis' over. \"What do you reckon India need to post to be pretty much unassailable?\" says Tim Leach. \"Appreciate there is some chorus of angels descending batting going on out there, but just how much of a batter's wicket is it?\" It really is a belter. I guess India will feel comfortable with anything over 350, and truly safe with 400.\n\n19th over: India 149-1 (Tendulkar 62, Gambhir 5) Botha has a big LBW appeal against Gambhir turned down. It was a fine piece of bowling, the quicker one, but it was definitely going down leg and there is no way South Africa will waste their last review on that. Gambhir then comes down the track to drive the last delivery handsomely for four, inside out over extra cover. Beautiful stroke. \"I work in Zuerich for an Indian company, and after Kevin O'Briens record ton I was teasing my Indian pals that KOB is faster than Sachin Tendulkar,\" says Kevin Mannerings. \"Will I have to eat humble pie on Monday?\" You'll be okay. Tendulkar would need to score 38 from six balls. Which, given how well he has played, shows just what an astonishing, unique innings that was from O'Brien.\n\n20th over: India 155-1 (Tendulkar 64, Gambhir 9) Gambhir bottom edges a cut at du Plessis through the legs of van Wyk for two. I suppose technically that's a missed chance, but only in the sense that technically Mac Millings is a man. Six from the over but at least South Africa have stemmed the flow of boundaries, with just one from the last four overs.\n\n21st over: India 160-1 (Tendulkar 66, Gambhir 11) Five from Botha's over. This is a good spell for South Africa, although these things are relative. Anyone out there? It's as if you're all in bed with Booze Head.\n\n22nd over: India 164-1 (Tendulkar 68, Gambhir 13) Ian Gould is the umpire today, which brings to mind this incredible piece of work in the recent Test series between these two sides. What a piece of umpiring! So far, today's umpiring has amounted to little more than a series of neck exercises, watching the ball disappear left and right, although at the moment we are in a boring spell. (Again, these things are relative.) Peterson comes back into the attack and concedes four singles.\n\n23rd over: India 169-1 (Tendulkar 70, Gambhir 15) \"While India work of their post-Powerplay lull,\" says Karthick Chilaka, \"what do you think England's chances are against the Windies?\" The match will be played in Chennai, where England beat South Africa, so if it's the same pitch that should suit the likes of Swann and Shahzad. But you'd have to be a complete idiot to predict what this England team will do next. Luckily I am that complete idiot, so I say they will win.\n\n24th over: India 173-1 (Tendulkar 72, Gambhir 17) Petersen and Botha are doing a pretty good job here, restricting these two to singles. Four more in that over. \"I'm reading,\" says Alex Netherton. \"Going to a wine bar in a bit though.\"\n\n25th over: India 174-1 (Tendulkar 72, Gambhir 18) Terrific stuff from Botha, who gives away just one run and now has figures of 5-0-19-1. India have scored a modest 37 from the last nine overs, having hit 137 from the first 16. \"Just on your Yahooohooo query – I think it's product placement for the website,\" says Abhinav. \"Advertising in India is just shockingly intrusive. It's such a relief to watch cricket here in England, despite Bob Willis.\" Seriously? Product placement during a bowling change? During every bowling change? As someone once said, that's mental.\n\n26th over: India 184-1 (Tendulkar 80, Gambhir 20) After a few quiet overs, Tendulkar raises the roof with a massive six, swiped over long on off the bowling of Peterson. That was a huge blow, and almost to order. This bloke is unbelievable. \"Having played them approximately 279 times in the last two months, I'm beginning to suspect England's loss to Bangladesh yesterday is just part of their plan to qualify fourth in order to meet Aussie in the quarters?\" says Nathaniel Wilson. \"The 6-1 drubbing in Australia being all about planning, and the quarter-final the chance to exact revenge. Just a thought.\" As plans go, that would be pretty Baldrickian. Australia are the last team I'd want England to face, followed by Sri Lanka. I hope they get through and draw Pakistan for the ultimate maverick-off.\n\n27th over: India 188-1 (Tendulkar 81, Gambhir 23) Four from Botha's over. He's bowling really well and, surely, should be preferred to Peterson when Imran Tahir returns to the side. \"Re: Yahoohoo,\" begins Parvez Thekumpurath. \"I am all ears, but Smith is making no more changes. I think it could be a reference to this, the mad Bollywood dances and songs which our parents adored is embraced with a sense of irony and endearment by the nouveau youth of India.\"\n\n28th over: India 192-1 (Tendulkar 82, Gambhir 25) Dale Steyn returns and goes for four, a wide and three singles.\n\n29th over: India 193-1 (Tendulkar 82, Gambhir 26) Botha has give India so little to hit. One from that over, and his figures are exceptional: 7-0-25-0. \"I remember being on a flight from Belfast to Heathrow with the Indian team before thee Tests in 1990,\" says Robert Wilson. \"I was sitting beside Ravi Shastri and a couple of other players. There had been talk of some kid called Tendulkar in the papers but I hadn't seen a picture. I asked Ravi to point him out (he was a few rows back, all teenaged and plump). 'I hear he's quite good.' I said reasonably enough. Their laugh was the strangest laugh I had ever heard. I've never heard one like it since. Do you think they were making fun of me?\" Ha, that's a lovely story. Here's Tendulkar maiden Test hundred, from the second Test of that series.\n\n30th over: India 197-1 (Tendulkar 83, Gambhir 28) Gambhir misses a big roundhouse hoick at Steyn, who isn't amused and has a word as a result. Four singles from the over. South Africa are stealthily getting into this match. \"The last team I want England to face in the quarter-finals is New Zealand, purely because I would fully expect them to beat them,\" says Dan Smith. \"The Netherlands (the result, not the performance) aside, that kind of dumb reasoning is all that's worked for me with England predictions so far.\"\n\n31st over: India 203-1 (Tendulkar 88, Gambhir 29) Tendulkar dances down the track to crash a full toss from Botha through the covers for four. That's only the second boundary from eight Botha overs. \"Definitely booze head this a.m,\" says Ravi Nair. \"But grateful for your nudging and nurdling us through this innings. Given the exercise England has given my heart muscles so far this tournament, I'm hoping this game goes easily India's way - they're my second team (did the name give me away?)\"\n\n32nd over: India 215-1 (Tendulkar 93, Gambhir 35) A rancid loosener from the new bowler Faf du Plessis is pulled for four by Gambhir, the start of a profitable over for India that also includes three singles, a wide and a withering pull over midwicket for four more by Tendulkar. \"One important aspect of ODI cricket that has changed but is not talked about much is the introduction of the extra Powerplay and how that has inflated batting scores,\" says Rory Alexander. \"Five more overs of free – or freer rather – hitting is one of the reasons totals have become bigger and bigger. Add in T20 influence and the bigger, better bats and we are looking at even 350 not being safe today.\" Absolutely. South Africa won't be too scared chasing over 300, especially as they chased 435 on this day five years ago. Mind you, that lower middle order looks really weak.\n\n33rd over: India 220-1 (Tendulkar 96, Gambhir 37) Jacques Kallis returns to the attack, eager as ever. Five from the over, all in ones and twos. Tendulkar is on the cusp of his I'velostcount ODI century. \"Yahoooooooo\" chirps Chris Brummitt. \"It comes up on the scoreboard, the crowd are encouraged to shout it out. It is indeed advertising by the internet company, Yahoo. What kind if evil mind thought that up? The same one that suggested Emirates might be a good one for a football stadium in north London, probably.\" We should have a sponsored OBO. Obviously nobody would be stupid enough to give us any money, but it's a nice idea. Well, an idea.\n\n34th over: India 230-1 (Tendulkar 97, Gambhir 46) JP Duminy returns to the attack and disappears for ten. Gambhir gets consecutive boundaries with a lofted, inside-out drive over extra cover and a very fine sweep. \"A humour theorist might tell the 24th over's Alexander Netherton that you shouldn't repeat your jokes,\" says Mac Millings. \"Less and less funny, you end up revealing your sad desperation. In other news, let me tell you an amusing anecdote about the time I got rejected by a girl in 0.00001 seconds/accidentally made eye contact with a fellow Tube-traveller/hated the English and myself/did something in a mildly incompetent manner.\"\n\n35th over: India 232-1 (Tendulkar 98, Gambhir 47) An accurate over from Kallis, with the replacement ball, goes for two. South Africa certainly aren't out of this. \"Not to turn this into a tendulkar lovefest,\" says Domink Hindal, as if that's a bad thing, \"but one of my favourite pieces of cricket nostalgia is this interview from before he'd made his debut.\" That's lovely.\n\n36th over: India 237-1 (Tendulkar 100, Gambhir 50) He's done it! Tendulkar drives Morkel for a single to reach a simply glorious century, from 92 balls and with seven fours and three sixes. The noise is unreal. You couldn't hear a tank drop. It's his 48th ODI century and his 99th – his 99th – in international cricket. The next best is Ricky Ponting with 68. Only three players – Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Brian Lara – have even half as many. He is a beautiful freak.\n\n37th over: India 243-1 (Tendulkar 101, Gambhir 55) Gambhir, whose half-century in the last over was lost amid Tendulkar's century, chips Kallis handsomely over mid on for a one-bounce four. With thirteen overs remaining, India should definitely be aiming for 350. \"Well, Smyth, you're in a rare vein of form,\" says Mac Millings. \"'If we roll all cricket up into one big ball, they are undeniably the two best sides in the world.' Where to start with that gem? And you can tell yesterday's readers, if any of them are foolish enough to have returned today, that this morning I opened my newly bought cereal from the bottom of the box, walked back-and-forth through a shop's security alarm while holding a suspicious looking bag, locked my small children on the roof, in case they have a fear of heights, procured a voucher for Suzanne Hall for a moist pony bap, rubbed myself all over with wet cardboard, and CCed a message to my bosses in which I have complained about all the \"cuts\" in my classroom. And you can tell Phil Withall that I know what he's done.\"\n\n38th over: India 253-1 (Tendulkar 110, Gambhir 56) Sachin Tendulkar has changed his bat. When he did that against England, he subsequently went berserk. He might be about to do the same here, because he has just played an outrageous stroke, cutting Morkel through the covers for four off the front foot. Morkel throws his hands up in the air as if to say, Sod this for a game of cricket. Tendulkar is just too good. \"The term maverick sits uneasily with England; they haven't earned their status, apart from Morgan, through exciting unorthodox players such as Malinga, Gayle, Afridi or Iqbal,\" says Tom Van der Gucht, who obviously never watched John Crawley bat. \"Yet there's something compelling about their state of mind and current performances that make them endearing and interesting to watch. A bit like the slightly odd chap you invariably have to share an office with, whose attempts at humour, charm, style and wit fall flat on their face and most people cringe slightly whenever they open their mouths. However despite all this there's still something tragically wonderful and brilliant about them and you just can't quite take your eyes off them in case you miss whatever comes next.\" So you're saying England are the Millings of the competition?\n\n39th over: India 258-1 (Tendulkar 111, Gambhir 60) India have taken the batting Powerplay. I thought they might leave it until one of the middle order thugs came to the crease. Anyhow Dale Steyn fronts up, as he usually does, and bowls a decent over that goes for six. Gambhir would have been run out by a direct hit from the second ball, and there was a big appeal for caught behind against Tendulkar off a slower bouncer. Simon Taufel said not out and South Africa did not use their last review. \"How much man-love is too much for Tendulkar?\" asks Dave Besley. \"Absolutely amazing. Fantastic. Brilliant. Someone needs to tell the Indians to slow it down, though. There'll be no chance of a close, nail-biting finish otherwise.\"\n\nWICKET! India 267-2 (Tendulkar c Duminy b Morkel 111) Tendulkar slices Morkel high in the air to point and walks off to a huge ovation. It's been another awesome innings, 111 from 101 balls. He actually does manage to anchor the innings at more than a run a ball; it's ludicrous.\n\n40th over: India 268-2 (Gambhir 69, Y Pathan 0) Yusuf Pathan has been promoted up the order to do some damage during the Powerplay. Earlier in the over Gambhir hit Morkel for consecutive boundaries, a cut and then a huge pick up over square leg. \"Millings!!!!\" says Phil Withall. \"Damn him. Damn Mac Millings. I knew this would happen one day. If he talks I'm taking him and his nasty little racket down with me. Be warned.\" His 'nasty little racket' of what, losers? I love the idea of a scaremongering headline. BAN THIS SICK PRODUCTION LINE OF SOCIALLY INEPT ENGLISH MALES.\n\nWICKET! India 268-3 (Gambhir c Kallis b Steyn 69) The batting Powerplay is working its dubious magic again. This is the second wicket in four balls. Gambhir makes room outside leg stump, Steyn follows him, and Gambhir screws a drive to mid off, where Kallis lumbers round to take a good tumbling catch.\n\nWICKET! India 268-4 (Y Pathan c Smith b Steyn 0) Yusuf Pathan has gone for a duck, and that's three wickets in six balls! He slapped Steyn towards cover, where Smith took a good leaping catch on the edge of the circle.\n\n41st over: India 270-4 (Yuvraj Singh 1, Dhoni 1) India were 140 for none after 17 overs. Since then South Africa have done excellently and have a decent chance now. How good is Dale Steyn? He was pummelled earlier today, absolutely slaughtered, but he never lets his head drop and always comes back for more. \"I for one am in bed with booze head, and you are to blame!\" chirps Declan Johnston. \"Coming home from work yesterday I was thinking of yesterday's riff, when I realised what I was absolutely terrified of approaching – the Moscow Metro. If you're ticket doesn't swipe properly, two Soviet industrial strength iron bars come shooting out, catching you square around the knees and reducing you to a crippled ball of hopeless foreigner as a sort of electronic 'Game Over' jingle starts playing over the intercom before an old lady waddles over and starts whistling at you to rise out of your foetal position and do some explaining. So I went and got liquered up instead.\"\n\nREVIEW! India 276-4 (Yuvraj LBW b Botha 7) Hello! Johan Botha comes on, tosses up his first delivery, and watches Yuvraj smear it back whence it came for a mighty six. He then falls over a superb quicker yorker, prompting a huge LBW appeal. It's turned down by Ian Gould, but South Africa go for the review. I reckon this will be hitting leg, but will it be hitting enough to overturn the decision. Ah, it doesn't matter because there was a huge inside edge, so Yuvraj continues. In fact it wasn't the inside edge; he middled it. New glasses please!\n\n42nd over: India 279-4 (Yuvraj Singh 10, Dhoni 1) \"Was it Bull who suggested there was something rotten in the England set-up?\" says Ian Copestake. \"I read on but couldn't find anything deep seated or suspicious, unless Prior suddenly gets called away to return to England to have an operation on his psyche.\"\n\nWICKET! India 283-5 (Yuvraj c Botha b Kallis 12) This is almost a carbon copy of India's innings against England. Yuvraj clubs a slower, low full toss from Kallis to long on, where Botha takes a well judged catch. That's the end of the batting Powerplay, and it has played a blinder for South Africa: five overs, 30 runs, four wickets.\n\n43rd over: India 283-5 (Dhoni 3, Kohli 0) Robin Petersen is back\n\n\"I'm in the Old Brewery down by the river at Greenwich, enjoying a pint of pale ale and free wifi, while the sun shines and the kids are doing improving things like visiting museums and playing in the park,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I usually envy you watching the cricket, but today I don't. Smug factor 9 I suppose.\" Sounds lovely, and it's gorgeous outside. Mind you I've just discovered this, so I think I know who's winning.\n\nWICKET! India 286-6 (Kohli ct and b Petersen 1) India are making a rare old mess of this. Kohli scuffs the ball back to the bowler Robin Petersen, and he takes a nice low catch.\n\n44th over: India 286-6 (Dhoni 5, Harbhajan 0) India were 267 for one at one stage. And then Tendulkar get out. IT'S ALL HIS FAULT DROP HIM HE'S A DISGRACE. \"I wonder if any team will listen to Duncan Fletcher's excellent analysis/tactics of approaching the Batting Powerplays,\" says Rory Alexander. \"He wants the batsmen to play normally for that duration i.e forget boundaries, and not lose wickets. The result is that the opposition captain is forced to use up his best bowlers, leaving lesser bowlers for the slog to the finish. India's approach today would vindicate Mr Fletcher.\"\n\n45th over: India 288-6 (Dhoni 6, Harbhajan 1) Two singles from Kallis's over. India will do well to reach 325 now. \"For South Africa to do their choking thing they need to have a chance of winning,\" says Ian Copestake. \"India are aware of this; hence the struggle to reach 300.\"\n\n46th over: India 292-6 (Dhoni 8, Harbhajan 3) What a jaffa that is from Peterson, drifting onto middle stump before spitting past Dhoni's outside edge. Harbhajan will have enjoyed that. Four singles from the over. \"So, Rob,\" says Arron Wright. \"Given that it's all but inevitable that Tendulkar will make his 100th international hundred this year, and he's playing in a World Cup that his side could win, and he tours England later this summer in what might be the best series played here since you-know-when do you think the BBC might see fit to give him the overseas sports personality award? I raised this on the blog during England v India – am pessimistic seeing as a cricketer has only ever won it three times (and Sobers' award was shared!), as against 14 awards for tennis players (yet Borg was overlooked in 1980!). Will stop there before showing my irritation with the general decline of the BBC Sports Personality award and BBC TV sport in general. SRT is far too good for them.\" He won't win it. They'd rather give to a Portuguese fourth division footballer than a cricketer.\n\nWICKET! India 293-7 (Harbhajan b Steyn 3) Majestic fast bowling from Dale Steyn, who cleans Harbhajan up with a beautiful inswinging yorker.\n\n47th over: India 293-7 (Dhoni 9, Zaheer 0) Steyn's first four overs disappeared for 34; since then, however, he has been awesome, with figures of 5-0-15-3 in three separate spells. He is a champion, a true great.\n\nWICKET! India 294-8 (Zaheer Khan c Morkel b Peterson 0) This is now a collapse of epic proportions. Zaheer holes out to wide long off, where Morkel takes a good sliding catch, and India have lost seven wickets for 27.\n\n48th over: India 295-8 (Dhoni 11, Nehra 0) India's scorecard looks ridiculous, as scorecards tend to when you collapse from 267 for one to 295 for eight. In fact, it's very similar to England's first innings at Headingley in 1992.\n\nWICKET! India 296-9 (Nehra c Smith b Steyn 0) This is ridiculous. Nehra drives straight to short extra cover, and the collapse is now eight wickets for 29 runs.\n\nWICKET! India 296 all out (Patel b Steyn 0) Sensational bowling from Dale Steyn. He gets Patel first ball with a sizzling yorker, and that gives him a memorable five-for. Steyn had nought for 32 after four overs, and he ended with figures of 9.4-0-50-5. Brilliant stuff. As well as Steyn bowled, that was an astonishing collapse from India, who reached 267 for one and then lost their last nine wickets for 29. Talk about a two-faced innings. South Africa need 297 to win. It'll be tricky, because the pitch is turning, but they would have taken that and then some when Sehwag and Tendulkar were thrashing them all round the park earlier in the day. I'm going to take a break, so Sean Ingle will talk you through the first part of South Africa's innings. Drop him a line on sean.ingle@theguardian.com.\n\nINNINGS BREAK\n\n1st over: South Africa 4-0 (target 297; Amla 4, Smith 0) The consensus is that India's score of 296 isn't enough which, given their position after 38 overs and the biff-boff nature of ODI cricket these days, is perhaps right. However there's turn in this pitch and, as Zaheer Khan's first over shows, some inswing. Just one run-scoring shot off the over - a delightful dissecting of the cover fielders by Amla. \"Is this the best World Cup since 1992?\" asks Richard Jones. I was in America so I missed 1996, Richard, but it's certainly been a good un so far. Anyone else?\n\n2nd over: South Africa 11-0 (target 297; Amla 4, Smith 7) Ashish Nehra has an economy rate of 4.19 in the 10 World Cup games - a figure he'll do well to maintain on this pitch. A case in point: despite a decent over, a chopping strike from Smith that thumps into the ground and trampolines over point concedes a couple of runs, before the South African captain pulls a bouncer lacking venom or bite to the boundary. Seven off the over.\n\n3rd over: South Africa 12-0 (target 297; Amla 4, Smith 8) An excellent nagging over from Khan, who gave Smith no room and conceded only one run as a result. \"Betfair don't seem to agree that 296 is not enough,\" says David Thompson. \"They were offering SA @ 2.66 during the innings break. Crazy price?\" Not as crazy as the 400-1 that Ireland were to beat England when they were five down ...\n\n4th over: South Africa 15-0 (target 297; Amla 4, Smith 11) While Sehwag and Tendulkar opted for close-of-show fireworks in the opening 10 overs of India's innings; Smith and Amla have preferred a Catherine Wheel approach: slow, steady and with a distinct lack of wow. \"What's the dew story in this match?\" asks Robin Hazlehurst. \"It must have been quite a late start local time, and the evening dew somewhat effed up England's bowling yesterday - is it going to do the same to India's today?\" No one has mentioned the dew yet, Robin - although the ball does seem to be stopping a bit more now before coming on to the bat. Perhaps Andy Bull, who is in Nagpur, will email in with an answer?\n\n5th over: South Africa 17-0 (target 297; Amla 5, Smith 12) It's like New Zealand in 1992 or Sri Lanka in 1996 never happened: so far South Africa's approach to the opening 15 overs is very 1970s and 80s ODI: ie steadily accumulate rather than desperately speculate. Of course, Khan and Nehra's bowling has something to do with that: they've hardly given Smith or Amla anything - indeed, Smith poked and missed at one outside his off-sump in that over. Two off it. \"Re: best World Cup,\" begins N Anand. \"1992 would have been better if not for the stupid rain rule and 1996 was good but for the crowd trouble in the semis.\" So, 1983 then?\n\n6th over: South Africa 25-0 (target 297; Amla 13, Smith 12) Boundaries! Two of them! First Amla cuts hard but not completely convincingly at a widish delivery that flies over a non-existent fourth slip and races for four, then - despite the best efforts of Tendulkar, whose double-footed slide across the turf would shame many Premier League footballers - drives another boundary down the ground. \"The dew won't be as much a factor at Nagpur as it was in Chittagong,\" explains Shankar Kalyanaraman. \"Nagpur is sufficiently inland, and not as humid.\"\n\n7th over: South Africa 29-0 (target 297; Amla 14, Smith 12) Another exemplary over from Khan (4-0-9-0), who continues to hassle and probe. Just three runs from it. The slowness of this pitch isn't helping the South Africans. Meanwhile Ulla Smith believes this World Cup \"beats football by a country mile for excitement, brilliant and yes, deplorable performances (this means you, Swann and Anderson yesterday at least.)\" Don't think many people tuning into Birmingham v Bolton would disagree with you.\n\n8th over: South Africa 37-0 (target 297; Amla 24, Smith 12) After scratching around for four dot balls, Amla goes over the top of extra cover for four before swiping another boundary off his pads. Better from South Africa, although at this stage India were 70-0. Meanwhile N Anand is back: \"As an Indian, the 1983 World Cup was the best in terms of result but I was a tiny toddler and did not watch it. It would have been much better had someone recorded Kaps 175 no! Shame that one of the best innings in ODI history has no video footage. Adds to the intrigue though...\"\n\nWICKET! Smith c Tendulkar b Zaheer 16 (South Africa 41-1) Smith has looked about as fluent as third-grade pupil's French here, but after hitting a boundary over mid off he tries to repeat the trick, only to loft Zaheer's slower ball straight to mid off.\n\n9th over: South Africa 41-1 (target 297; Amla 24, Kallis 0) Kallis sees out the over. Meanwhile the TV cameras pan to a sign in the crowd which says 'Smith is Zaheer's bunny' - and with good reason; that's the 13th time in Tests and ODIs that he has dismissed the South African captain.\n\n10th over: South Africa 43-1 (target 297; Amla 25, Kallis 1) After losing the wicket of Smith, the South Africans are drawing breath: just come two off Munaf Patel's first over - and there are signs of low bounce here too.\n\n11th over: South Africa 46-1 (target 297; Amla 26, Kallis 3) \"Kallis is due an innings isn't he?\" says David Thompson, not unreasonably. \"What odds a big one here?\" Well, Kallis is a little better than evens to score 50. But you suspect that he - or Amla - will need to do better than that for the South Africans to come close. At this stage India were 93-0 ... but for now South Africa are content to keep things trickling along. Two off the over and the run rate is now 6.64.\n\n12th over: South Africa 48-1 (target 297; Amla 27, Kallis 4) Hello, Smyth again. India appeare to have started superbly here, with Zaheer getting his bunny again. The top four are vital for South Africa. Kallis works Patel for a single, and then Amla is beaten by a ball that grubs outside off stump. \"This has to be one of the better starts by Indian seamers while defending a high total,\" says Anand. \"Usually, we get walloped pretty badly. It all started with one Sanath Jayasuriya bashing us in Delhi in the 96 WC and has continued ever since. That game ended the career of Prabhakar who probably conceded the same amount of runs every bowler concedes these days...\" Wasn't it 4-0-43-0 or something?\n\n13th over: South Africa 53-1 (target 297; Amla 31, Kallis 5) India were past 100 at this stage, so South Africa clearly need to get a jump on. Kallis works Nehra into the leg single, but he has just five from 14 balls and there have been no boundaries in this partnership. Nehra then beats Amla with a lovely slower ball. Is it really eight years since he shredded England under lights at the World Cup? Crikey.\n\n14th over: South Africa 62-1 (target 297; Amla 34, Kallis 11) A very lucky escape for Hashim Amla. He took a suicidal single to mid off and would have been miles out had Virat Kohli's throw hit the stumps. It was beautiful fielding from Kohli, who picked up on the run and got the throw away in one silky movement, but it just missed the stumps. With the pressure mounting, Kallis walks down the wicket and slams Patel just over cover for four. South Africa badly needed that boundary.\n\n15th over: South Africa 66-1 (target 297; Amla 35, Kallis 14) The required rate is still a reasonable 6.6, but South Africa have to factor in Harbhajan's ten overs. It would be a major surprise if they take him for more than, what, 45? That means they have to take a few risks elsewhere, but there are none in that Nehra over. Four from it. \"What to do, Rob, what to do?\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Wander down the canal to town to spend a book token I've been given? Wander down the canal in the opposite direction and have a pint at the Pyewipe reading the paper and listening to TMS? Or slump here sending emails into a cold, uncaring void and grimly pressing F5 (I'm feeling old school today) bemoaning my lack of get up and go (it got up and went)?\"\n\n16th over: South Africa 70-1 (target 297; Amla 37, Kallis 16) Four singles from Patel's over. I'm not quite sure what game South Africa are playing here. Maybe they feel, not unreasonably, that they can't risk losing wickets because the lower order is so fragile. But then if they do that, those lower-order batsmen will eventually be coming in with the required rate up around eight. Either way, if and when de Villiers is fit to take the bowlers, they should replace van Wyk with a batsman rather than a bowler. \"This is the Prabhakar scorecard,\" says Anand. \"47 in 4 overs.\" Crikey. Did he start bowling off spin or have I dreamed that? If I've been dreaming about Manoj Prabhakar bowling off spin there really is no way back. Ah, hang on, he did start bowling off spin. \"Regarding that '96 match between India and Sri lanka, it must be the only instance of a fast bowler (Manoj Prabhakar) having to stoop to bowling off spin to stem the tide,\" says Rory Alexander. \"The saddest thing I've seen on a cricket field, it was.\"\n\n17th over: South Africa 74-1 (target 297; Amla 39, Kallis 18) Yusuf Pathan is going to bowl his offspin. India's fifth bowler combination will probably have to go for 75 or more if South Africa are to win this, so that's a great start for Pathan – just four singles from his first over. \"As for the bunny talk,\" says Anand, \"a quick list comes to mind. Atherton - McGrath, Ambrose; Cullinan - Warne; Indian openers of the 90s – any home team bowler on away tours; Agarkar – anyone with a ball. Do you know of any English bowler who tormented a particular batsman?\" Dilip Vengsarkar had all sorts of trouble with Mike Atherton's legspin. A-hem. Here's the full list in Tests, Alec Bedser to Arthur Morris right up there. Which is as good a reason as any to post Lord Kitchener's famous ditty.\n\n18th over: South Africa 78-1 (target 297; Amla 41, Kallis 20) South Africa still can't find the boundary, with just one in the last nine overs now. Four singles from that Patel over, so the required rate inches close to seven. \"Having a canal running in both directions from one's home leads me to think that Phily Sawyer lives under a bridge,\" says Ian Copestake.\n\n19th over: South Africa 84-1 (target 297; Amla 45, Kallis 22) If South Africa aren't careful they are going to die wondering about this game. It's not easy, because India have bowled really well, but they are still a little becalmed given the situation. Six from Pathan's over, all in ones and twos. \"My head feels like a bag of smashed crabs, following on from 'a few beers' after work last night that ended up as a Liver Compromiser blitz, and has resulted in me barely being able to type,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"Even this is an effort. But however bad I feel, I won't feel as bad as the Indian middle order will if they lose this. I still can't get over the rate and splendour of that collapse. I never thought I'd see them raise the bar that we've set so high over the years. England, I'm sure, will try and better it before the tournament is out.\" It could only have been worse if it had happened in the second innings, but no team would ever cock a run chase up that badly. Right?\n\n20th over: South Africa 89-1 (target 297; Amla 46, Kallis 26) Munaf Patel is replaced by Yuvraj Singh, which means part-time spin at both ends. Five from the over, all in ones and twos.\n\n21st over: South Africa 93-1 (target 297; Amla 48, Kallis 28) Amla chips Pathan in the air but safely for a single, which brings up a sedate fifty partnership. Too sedate? We'll know in a couple of hours' time. They have certainly left themselves plenty to do. Four more singles from the over. \"Sawyer's bridge,\" begins Robin Hazlehurst. \"Although it is a bridge with an internet connection in fairness, definitely a des res yuppie bridge conversion-stylee thingy, not just your average bog-standard canal-side tunnel/open sewer. Relatively speaking.\"\n\n22nd over: South Africa 98-1 (target 297; Amla 50, Kallis 31) Dhoni is holding back Harbhajan, which is a really smart move because you suspect South Africa have set themselves to take four or five singles an over at the moment regardless of who is bowling, so you may as well have the fifth bowler at both ends. Five from another boundaryless over, the last of which brings Amla to a 58-ball fifty. He is voracious in his appetite for runs. \"Manoj Prabakhar bowling off breaks isn't the only instance of a fast bowler doing that,\" says Jack Howes. \"Phil Defreitas ended up doing the same thing in the quarter final of that World Cup as Sanath smashed something like 80 off 40 balls. In a matter of days Jayasuriya had two fast bowlers resorting to off spin in their desperation to stop their bowling being pummelled. Here's those two innings: India, and England.\" What I also love about the England game is the fact that Kaluwitharana was out third ball. For eight.\n\n23rd over: South Africa 104-1 (target 297; Amla 52, Kallis 35) Six from Pathan's over, again all in ones and twos. It's tediously formulaic, this passage of play, but that suits India more than South Africa. \"I am being forced, if I want to breed, to re-enter the dating game,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Is mentioning OBOs and MBMs a good topic to bring up among ladies?\" Don't you live in Germany? I hear the OBO is all the rage there. Also, \"re-enter the dating game\". Doesn't that suggest you have a choice in the matter? 'Anyone can enter the dating game, it's all the rage among the emotionally spent thirtysomethings of today, etc, etc.'\n\n24th over: South Africa 108-1 (target 297; Amla 54, Kallis 37) Now Harbhajan does come on, in place of Yuvraj. Dhoni could have left it a couple of overs more but then you risk Harbhajan getting manhandled at the death, so this is probably the perfect time. Four singles from a good first over, so now the required rate is pushing 7.3. Something will have to given pretty soon. \"I dream,\" says Phil Sawyer, \"of living in an average bog-standard canal-side tunnel/open sewer.\n\n25th over: South Africa 115-1 (target 297; Amla 56, Kallis 42) Yuvraj has switched ends to replace Pathan. What Andrew Strauss did so brilliantly in that other massive chase against India was to score a boundary every second over in addition to the usual helping of ones and twos. South Africa haven't done that; when Kallis sweeps Yuvraj for four, it is only the second boundary in 17 overs. And even with that boundary, they managed only seven from the over, which is below the required rate. \"For the sake of accuracy (living in Germany has that effect),\" says Ian Copestake, \"I am an emotionally spent forty-something.\" An orderly one please, ladies. An orderly one.\n\n26th over: South Africa 121-1 (target 297; Amla 60, Kallis 44) Yuvraj drops Amla! It was a pretty straightforward chance at midwicket when Amla flicked at Harbhajan, but the ball was on Yuvraj faster than he expected and it went through his hands. Six from the over.\n\n27th over: South Africa 126-1 (target 297; Amla 61, Kallis 48) Kallis paddles Yuvraj for a couple, but that's yet another boundaryless over. South Africa are struggling a little. They need 171 from 138 balls. Don't fancy theirs much.\n\nWICKET! South Africa 127-2 (Amla c Dhoni b Harbhajan 61) Harbhajan makes the breakthrough with a beautiful piece of bowling. That turned a bit and bounced viciously, getting really big on Amla while also cramping him for room, and his attempted cut went off the edge into the gloves of Dhoni. That was a brute of a delivery, and a lovely reaction catch from Dhoni.\n\n28th over: South Africa 129-2 (target 297; Kallis 50, de Villiers 1) The new batsman, AB de Villiers, is not someone who will die wondering. This should be a fascinating and possibly decisive passage of play. Kallis, meanwhile, reaches a serene fifty from 66 balls.\n\n29th over: South Africa 133-2 (target 297; Kallis 52, de Villiers 3) Munaf Patel comes on for Yuvraj, so India still have two overs of their fifth-bowler complement remaining. Four singles from the over. That's not enough for South Africa.\n\n30th over: South Africa 144-2 (target 297; Kallis 62, de Villiers 4) What the hell happened there? Kallis went a long way across to sweep Harbhajan, missed the stroke, and then the ball deflected off his gloves and just past the off stump. Had it not hit the gloves he would have been bowled. Kallis then survives a pretty big shout for LBW; he was outside the line, I think, and it might also have been bouncing over. But Kallis gets the sweep right later in the over, hammering it for four. Great shot.\n\n31st over: South Africa 147-2 (target 297; Kallis 63, de Villiers 6) Three singles from an excellent Yuvraj over. South Africa need 150 from 114 balls.\n\n32nd over: South Africa 156-2 (target 297; Kallis 64, de Villiers 14) That's a glorious stroke from de Villiers, who charges Harbhajan and drives him thrillingly over midwicket for six. His urgency has changed the mood of this innings. Later in the over he comes down the track again, this time dragging Harbhajan on the bounce to deep midwicket. For a while it seemed like he had holed out. \"Smyth, Smyth,\" tuts Josh Robinson. \"You're massively underestimating the South Africans' chances against this target. It's all very well saying that four off an over is not enough, but they've got it within them to pick up to nine or ten relatively easily when they need to. Indeed, according to the Duckworth/Lewis tables, which are often a pretty good guide to these things, they're spot on target at the end of the 31st over. This game's in the balance.\" It is now that de Villiers has got going.\n\n33rd over: South Africa 161-2 (target 297; Kallis 66, de Villiers 16) Yuvraj has a biggish LBW appeal against Kallis, who was well outside the line. Then he beats de Villiers with a flighted delivery that turns past the edge. Five from the over and, although India have used up their fifth-bowler quota, they might keep Yuvraj on for one more.\n\n34th over: South Africa 162-2 (target 297; Kallis 66, de Villiers 17) Zaheer bowls the last over with this old ball, presumably to see if there's any reverse swing. The first ball jags away off the seam to beat de Villiers, and the third keeps low to similar effect. As does the sixth to beat Kallis. South Africa now need 8.44 per over. \"Do the Duckworth/Lewis tables factor in choking?\" honks Ian Copestake.\n\n35th over: South Africa 170-2 (target 297; Kallis 67, de Villiers 24) Yuvraj does continue, with the replacement ball, and de Villiers plays a gorgeous stroke, a lofted extra-cover drive that goes for a one-bounce four. This fella is a dangerous customer.\n\nREVIEW! South Africa 172-2 (Kallis LBW b Zaheer 68) This is very close indeed. Kallis walks across his stumps to Zaheer and misses a whip to leg, prompting a huge appeal for LBW. Ian Gould says not out, so India go for the review. The only issue is whether the ball came back enough or whether it was missing off stump. Replays show that it was hitting off stump – but Kallis was more than 2.5 metres down the track, so he is given not out. India will love that!\n\nWICKET! South Africa 173-3 (Kallis run out 69) Kallis's reprieve lasted just one ball. From the very next delivery, he worked Zaheer to deep backward square and came back for a second. Harbhajan sent in a bullet throw to Dhoni, who took the ball beautifully in front of the stumps and swung round to demolish them with Kallis just short of his ground. That's a massive breakthrough for India, and brilliant work from both Harbhajan and Dhoni.\n\n36th over: South Africa 173-3 (target 297; de Villiers 25, Duminy 0) So, South Africa need 124 from 84 balls. It's all down to AB de Villiers, you suspect.\n\n37th over: South Africa 183-3 (target 297; de Villiers 30, Duminy 5) Crikey, South Africa have taken the Powerplay. That's a bit of a surprise. Nehra returns to the attack as a result, and his first over goes for 10. Duminy opens the face to steer nicely for four, and then de Villiers bottom edges a cut wide of Dhoni for four more.\n\n38th over: South Africa 190-3 (target 297; de Villiers 34, Duminy 6) Zaheer's over costs seven, thanks in part to a brilliant save from Harbhajan on the long-off boundary. India have fielded very well today, by their standards. \"I'm out here,\" says Andrew Van der Walt, \"but I'm South African and the pressure is on, so I find myself unable to respond to you.\"\n\n39th over: South Africa 201-3 (target 297; de Villiers 39, Duminy 11) AB de Villiers is struggling, with cramp I think, so Hashim Amla is coming back on as a runner. At the other end, Duminy makes room to drive Patel just over cover and away for four, and then de Villiers slugs a full toss over mid on to similar effect. That's a good over for South Africa, 11 from it. \"'Anyone out there?'\" quotes Nigel Percy. \"Isn't it a bit out of place to ask this question in an OBO? After all, we have been searching the skies for decades now and nobody has come back with definitive proof. I think the most we can say is that the question has not been definitely answered..unless you count my mad uncle Eric who after several pints (many severals) would boast of his meeting aliens once... although the details were as hazy as his speech...\" Can speech be hazy? Never mind.\n\n40th over: South Africa 218-3 (target 297; de Villiers 48, Duminy 19) AB de Villiers has just played one of the most amazing shots I've ever seen. How the hell do you describe that? Typing some words would be a start I suppose. It was full and wide of off stump, and de Villiers played a premeditated reverse lap for four to the left of Dhoni. He whirled his hands so far that he took the ball from wide of off stump and deflected it to fine leg (to the right-hander) for four. I'm still practising the stroke between deliveries, trying to work out what he did. How do you describe that shot? A premeditated inside-out reverse lap? With pike? And off a fast bowler! He is playing a gem of an innings, de Villiers, and slices the next ball over backward point for another boundary. And then, two balls later, Duminy swipes a glorious straight six! This is wonderful batting. Seventeen from the over, and South Africa's decision to take the Powerplay looks inspired. They now need 79 from the last 10 overs. India are still slight favourites, but it's desperately close. \"With this injury to AB's knee, are we seeing a higher than normal level of injury in this competition or is it just that there are so many matches?\" says Clare Davies. I have not a clue.\n\nWICKET! South Africa 223-4 (de Villiers c Kohli b Harbhajan 52) This could be the matchwinning moment. de Villiers sweeps Harbhajan flat and hard to deep midwicket, and Kohli runs round to take a beautiful low catch. Harbhajan yelps with delight, pumping his arms in de Villiers' direction. The dangerman de Villiers has gone after an ingenious innings of 52 from 39 balls, and India are definitely favourites now.\n\n41st over: South Africa 225-4 (target 297; Duminy 21, du Plessis 1) That was an inspired bowling change from MS Dhoni, who risked Harbhajan in the Powerplay and got an almighty reward. That's the end of the Powerplay, in which South Africa scored 52 runs but lost the huge wicket of AB de Villiers. \"The best World Cup was the very first in 1975 because we didn't know what to expect,\" says John Starbuck. \"I recall the amazement at seeing the Australians begin with a full slip cordon - don't they know how to play this game? - and the incessant tin-can rhythm at Lord's in the final which so many people got hysterically work up about, ignoring the fact they'd just seen a splendid match. Incidentally, no mention in the OBO so far of any Boring Middle Overs. Losing your grip(e)?\" Arf. The other good thing about 1975 is that it was over in two weeks.\n\n42nd over: South Africa 235-4 (need 62 from 48 balls; Duminy 22, du Plessis 10) Yuvraj Singh is coming back, another fascinating gamble from MS Dhoni. It is a successful one at first, with four from five balls – but then du Plessis plays a fantastic inside-out drive over mid off for six. Shot! \"As a cricket fan I find watching teams India and South Africa quite depressing,\" says Sae Ahmed. \"They never seem to become great!\" You should try watching England...\n\nWICKET! South Africa 236-5 (Duminy st Dhoni b Harbhajan 23) That should be the match. Harbhajan sees Duminy coming and spears in a leg-side wide. Dhoni drops the ball, not once but twice, yet still has enough time to break the stumps before Duminy gets back in his ground.\n\n43rd over: South Africa 240-5 (need 57 from 42 balls; du Plessis 12, van Wyk 1) \"I am reading PG Wodehouse's novel Piccadilly Jim for my Book Club class tomorrow,\" says Ian Copestake. \"There is a nice exchange about a cricket match an American is trying to understand which he asks the butler to explain. Sufficiently confused he gains revenge by explaining baseball, only to be met with the butler's response that it is indeed a game played often in England, but only by children.\"\n\nWICKET! South Africa 247-6 (van Wyk LBW b Patel 5) What the hell was that? Morne van Wyk, who had been dropped earlier in the over, tries to reverse sweep Patel and is given out LBW. He went for the review, but it looked plumb and replays showed it was hitting leg stump. That's a shocking shot. He has looked out of his depth in this tournament, with bat and gloves.\n\n44th over: South Africa 247-6 (need 50 from 30 balls; du Plessis 14, Botha 0) \"This game is going to be a tie,\" says Anand. \"There has been an Indian collapse after a Sachin 100, another 2.5m ruling going against India from a left armer. Isn't it obvious? TIE TIE TIE.\"\n\n45th over: South Africa 251-6 (need 46 from 30 balls; du Plessis 16, Botha 1) South Africa used to have the likes of Klusener and Pollock at No8 and No9. Now they have Botha and Peterson – useful batsmen but not in the same league. Just four from Harbhajan's over, and the net is closing around South Africa.\n\n46th over: South Africa 261-6 (need 36 from 24 balls; du Plessis 19, Botha 8) Ten from Patel's over, very sensibly played by South Africa. Botha crashes a cut past backward point for four, steals down the ground and then clumps a single to long off. That brings du Plessis on strike, and he works a two into the leg side, followed by a single. Well played. \"On three separate occasions today, India have bungled in getting a South African batsman out but one run later, they get their man anyways,\" says Shankar Kalyanaraman. \"Amla dropped by Yuvraj but caught by Dhoni, Kallis LBW turned down and later run out and now van Wyk dropped by Gambhir and then out LBW.\"\n\n47th over: South Africa 266-6 (need 31 from 18 balls; du Plessis 21, Botha 11) A wonderful over from Harbhajan, under the most extreme pressure, goes for just five: three singles, two dot balls to Botha, and then two off the last ball. Great stuff.\n\nWICKET! South Africa 279-7 (Botha c sub (Raina) b Patel 21) Having smacked 10 from the previous two deliveries, a giddy Botha swipes one up in the air and the substitute Raina takes an excellent running catch in the covers. South Africa need 18 from 13 balls.\n\n48th over: South Africa 280-7 (need 17 from 12 balls; du Plessis 23, Peterson 0) Botha had hit Patel for four and then six, the latter a mighty smash down the ground. Yet another twist in this outstanding match. The initiative is changing hands almost every ball.\n\n48.1 overs: South Africa 281-7 (need 16 from 11 balls) Zaheer Khan will bowl the penultimate over, and his first ball is a yorker that du Plessis can only drag down the ground for a single.\n\n48.2 overs: South Africa 282-7 (need 15 from 10 balls) How was that not a run out? Both batsmen ended up at the same end, but the fielder in the covers fumbled the ball and then threw it too high to the bowler Zaheer. By the time he claimed it and broke the stumps, Peterson was home.\n\n48.3 overs: South Africa 283-7 (need 14 from 9 balls) du Plessis steers a single into the off side.\n\n48.4 overs: South Africa 283-7 (need 14 from 8 balls) To think we thought this tournament would be boring! It has, thus far, been a cracker. Zaheer charges in to Peterson, who misses a yorker outside off stump. Beautifully bowled, and a priceless dot ball. Zaheer is a master at the death.\n\n48.5 overs: South Africa 284-7 (need 13 from 7 balls) Peterson square drives another single.\n\n49 overs: South Africa 284-7 (need 13 from 6 balls) Zaheer's final ball is a dot ball! du Plessis swings and misses a low full toss just outside off stump. Wonderful stuff from Zaheer, just four from the over. So now, who bowls the last over: Nehra or Harbhajan? I would go with Harbhajan, risky though that is.\n\n49.1 overs: South Africa 288-7 (need 9 from 5 balls) It'll be Ashish Nehra, the left-arm swing bowler, rather than Harbhajan. Nehra charges in, and Peterson inside edges a heave to fine leg for four! \"Ladies and gentlemen, that's a four!\" says the tannoy announcer. He'll be lynched if he keeps that patter up!\n\n49.2 overs: South Africa 294-7 (need 3 from 4 balls) Peterson has smashed Nehra for an almighty six over midwicket! Bloody hell. It was in the slot, a length delivery, and Peterson clattered it over the ropes. Poor bowling, admittedly, but what a shot to play under pressure.\n\n49.3 overs: South Africa 296-7 (need 1 from 3 balls) Peterson inside edges two more to fine leg, and the scores are level. He survived a token run-out referral after a direct hit from Tendulkar; there was never really any doubt that he was home.\n\nSOUTH AFRICA WIN BY THREE WICKETS WITH TWO BALLS TO SPARE A fantastic victory for South Africa is sealed when Peterson drives through extra cover for four. They are going ballistic on the balcony, jumping on the spot in a big huddle, and quite right too. At one stage they were looking down the barrel of a total of 350, but the fightback started with Dale Steyn's exceptional five-for and then they paced a difficult chase immaculately. Some of us thought they were going too slowly in the middle of the innings, but they knew what they were doing. AB de Villiers made a sensational fifty and the lower order were a revelation, with Johan Botha and Robin Peterson hammering 41 off 22 balls. Who needs Klusener and Pollock? You won't need the 'C' word tonight.\n\nThis is a huge win for South Africa on so many levels. Psychologically, they have almost got two victories for the price of one, winning a tight game and a game in which they were dead and buried. They have also avoided a second consecutive defeat, and should now avoid their Australian nemeses in the quarter-finals. India have a few questions to answer – about their fifth bowler, their back-up seam bowling, their death hitting, and why Sachin Tendulkar has now made two exquisite centuries without being on the winning side – but all that is for another day. Not least because I am shattered. It's been another wonderful game. Who'd have thought the cricket World Cup could be the gift that keeps on giving? Thanks for all your emails. Night."
