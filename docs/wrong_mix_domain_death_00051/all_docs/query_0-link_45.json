I have tried to follow the BBC series (The World of Wodehouse) and after a few episodes I found that - for me - the flavour of the language was getting lost somewhere in the transition from book to screen!\n\nThere is no question about the fact that a lot of the essence of a great book does get lost when reproduced through the visual or audio medium. I for one am extremely particular about the nuances of the text being preserved to the maximum extent possible whenever such an adaptation is attempted. Case in point: the Sherlock Holmes series. Though there have been numerous screen adaptations made over the last several decades, there is only one, in my opinion, which strikes me as being the most true to the book, which is the BBC series starring Jeremy Brett in the titular role. Its a pleasure to watch, and again, highly recommended for Holmes fans. Similarly, I find the recent adaptations (Benedict Cumberbatch, or Robert Downey Jr titular roles) to be not at all true to the book, and I avoid watching them because it pains me to see how much of the original narrative has been completely obliterated to cater to \"modern\" viewership tastes. In fact, I cannot identify with these series at all\n\nThat said, I find the BBC Jeeves and Wooster series to be quite true to the book, and enjoy watching them. True, some bit of the essence is lost in translation, but it still remains one of my favourite classes TV series.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2014\n\nLocation: mum, kolkata\n\nPosts: 1,241\n\nThanked: 1,648 Times\n\nre: The Book Thread (Fiction)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by subraiyr\n\nI do.

What a combo with a clown and Freddie.\n\nHi subraiyr, I have been a total duffer when I replied earlier to your post - thinking it was about The Shining, when you meant his other book IT. The fact is I haven't read the book IT, and I assumed it was a typo error.

No apologies.\n\nShining is yet another great book. I preferred the book to the movie. In fact i prefer books to most of the movies made on books. The closest i have seen a movie come to a book is Godfather. I guess it is all about our own imaginations and picturisations when we read a book\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2012\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 217\n\nThanked: 1,170 Times\n\nre: The Book Thread (Fiction)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by arindambasu13\n\nThat said, I find the BBC Jeeves and Wooster series to be quite true to the book, and enjoy watching them.

This started somewhere in the 70s and is quite brilliant. Esp when the character of Major Winchester enters. He is ala wodehousian chap.\n\nTheir books too are very interesting. I had a hard time finding them here, but managed to get a couple which is now sadly tucked up in a loft since i dont have much space for book display\n\nIncidentally, i read a book by Stephen Fry quite a while back called The Liar. It is quite funny but does have some serious undercurrents as well. Suggest you give it a shot\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2014\n\nLocation: mum, kolkata\n\nPosts: 1,241\n\nThanked: 1,648 Times\n\nre: The Book Thread (Fiction)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by arindambasu13\n\n....Case in point: the Sherlock Holmes series.

They are all classics in the best sense of the word.\n\nAs you said, the current practice of glib one-liners from the mouth of the revered Holmes (as practised by Downey Jr.) is sacrilege - chaps have been drawn & quartered for less, as good old Pelham would say!\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2008\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,595\n\nThanked: 2,501 Times\n\nre: The Book Thread (Fiction)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by shashanka\n\nI have tried to follow the BBC series (The World of Wodehouse) and after a few episodes I found that - for me - the flavour of the language was getting lost somewhere ...\n\nHi Shashanka,\n\nIm not sure that we are talking about the same series here. Just to clarify, I am talking about the following:\n\nThis is season 1 episode 1, others are also available on Youtube. This may not be a BBC production, in which case, I stand corrected on my earlier statement in this regard. However, if you are talking about a separate series, and have not come across this one, do give this a try. I have a feeling you might like it.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2008\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,595\n\nThanked: 2,501 Times\n\nre: The Book Thread (Fiction)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by shashanka\n\nYou were right Arindam - this one is a separate series. But I watched it and must confess that I enjoyed it. As Subraiyr said \"it is all about our own imaginations and picturisations when we read a book.\"\n\nGreat, glad you enjoyed it. Do catch the other episodes as well. I am a big fan of this series and have watched several reruns.\n\nThese books are like comfort food. When one is down and wants literary fodder which are easy on the brain, yet evokes instant nostalgia, Wodehouse hits the spot real quick. Kind of like Jeeves' famed pick-me-ups\n\nHas been, and will remain my go -to series for a long long time to come!\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2014\n\nLocation: mum, kolkata\n\nPosts: 1,241\n\nThanked: 1,648 Times\n\nre: The Book Thread (Fiction)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by arindambasu13\n\nGreat, glad you enjoyed it.

I like to think of them as 'soul food' and cram a lot of other stuff in the envelope as well - great books (of course) from a broad genre, memorable photographs (there's a whole anthology of them in the \"official non-auto images\" thread from some great camera artists on our forum), great music (with old bollywood items taking centre-stage!) and various odds & ends that you come across along the way!\n\nLast edited by shashanka : 24th May 2017 at 07:46."
