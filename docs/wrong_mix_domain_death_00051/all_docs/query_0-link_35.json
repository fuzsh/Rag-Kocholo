        "text": "‘Harlan County, USA’: A powerful and landmark documentary about miners’ woes\n\nBy Arun Kumar\n\nHarlan County, USA isn’t afflicted with the liberal guilt that seems to be problem with many sentimental, issue-driven documentaries of contemporary era. Kopple’s Harlan County and her other masterpiece American Dream (1990) were made with deep understanding of workers’ life.\n\nSam Peckinpah’s ‘Pat Garett and Billy the Kid’: The times maybe a changin’, but not me…\n\nBy Vivaan Shah\n\nThe images from Sam Peckinpah’s films seem to bubble and swell out of the filmmaker’s subconscious – what Freud called ‘the dream state’. Time and again he abandons chronological continuity and traditional film grammar in favour of the figurative. He has non-linear sequences instead of non-linear narratives, and deconstructs the very medium of cinema itself in an aggressively proto-Godardian fashion.\n\nTen years after Cyclone Aila, inhabitants of Sundarbans are still waiting for rehabilitation\n\nBy Mehebub Sahana\n\nBadly planned and poorly executed policies related to fishing and honey-harvesting have also affected the livelihood of the local people. Economic desperation has resulted in large scale out-migration, particularly in last one decade.\n\n‘The Yakuza’: A terribly underrated Sydney Pollack classic starring Robert Mitchum\n\nBy Murtaza Ali Khan\n\nThe Yakuza is a magnificent work of cinematic art that certainly deserves more attention than what it has received over the last four decades or so. The movie features one of Mitchum’s all-time great performances. It’s also one of the best films directed by the legendary Sydney Pollack.\n\nPoem: Chatla Blues\n\nBy Goirick B\n\nThey are taking me away\n\nfrom the banks of my Chatla\n\nThey are taking me away.\n\n‘Bunny Lake is Missing’: The scariest film I have ever seen\n\nBy Vivaan Shah\n\nHis long takes and distant camera can be attributable to his tendency to view drama as a spatial whole from the point of view of a proscenium arch. To him all the world was half stage and half podium and whole part auditorium with the curtains drawn across our eyes, blindfolding us from the ultimate truth.\n\nBlacklight: Anarchy in the Afternoon (Short Story)\n\nBy Tanushree Ghosh\n\n‘That’s why it takes you all forever. Doing your chores while clients wait.’ Meena’s fingers were now frantically styling through Reetu’s hair, relaxing her. ‘What did you have for lunch? Beef?’ Reetu continued.\n\nA Quranic perspective on technological advancements\n\nBy Fathah Abdussalam Kodag\n\nBy mentioning the miracles of the Prophets, the Quran shows the ultimate goal of scientific and technological developments, and specifies their final aims. It urges man forward toward those aims. Just as the past is the field for the seeds of the future, and mirror to its potential picture, the future is the time to reap the harvest of the past life and mirror to the actual situation.\n\nArt Work: Mob Pleasure\n\nBy Jyotsna Dwivedi\n\nIt is at 4 am in the morning every other day now,\n\nWhen the mob birds, mob cows, mob men and women roam on this land.\n\nThose birds sit on bloody bodies, bathe in their blood, feel giddy with excitement and erection.\n\nMental health and addiction: A conversation with psychiatrist Dr. Bharati Dattatray Patil\n\nBy Rimli Bhattacharya\n\nMillions suffer from mental health but feel scared to spell out for the stigma attached to it. I have been counseling for years and have come across cases who couldn’t get cured without the intervention of a professional psychiatrist. In this interview, I speak to Dr. (Mrs) Bharati Dattatray Patil on issues of mental health and addiction.\n\nBook Review: Sumana Roy’s ‘Missing’\n\nBy Suranjana Choudhury\n\nThe beauty of her narration lies not in unnecessary elaboration. The details are necessary because through the exterior Roy tells us about the interior worlds of characters. The action is as much internal as it is external. Readers will appreciate that this simultaneity serves to introduce an interesting order to a series of thoughts and experiences."
