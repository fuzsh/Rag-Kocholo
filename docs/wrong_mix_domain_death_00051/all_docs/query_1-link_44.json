        "text": "In silence, a moving camera slowly stops at the entrance to a church; the First Reformed church in New York, the setting of Paul Schrader’s film.\n\nThe lack of camera movement is striking, the lack of music drowned by cawing-cawing creates an unsettling atmosphere; my movie mind immediately reclines to the mode of familiarity, that smug sense of the mind jumping ahead of the story.\n\nOh, but how wrong my movie mind was and how happy I am. It is not that I have not been wrong before, the lord knows I have but it is not often that the feeling of being defeated is accompanied by indescribable happiness.\n\nFirst Reformed is nothing like anything I have ever seen.\n\nMovies are a visual medium, meaning they communicate to us through the eyes and when that sensation is achieved, we have in our hands what is often called a visual treat.\n\nFirst Reformed goes beyond all that. Schrader forgoes cinematic mastery for spare but sure-footed direction and lets his main character wrestle with the theme of the movie.\n\nFrom the very beginning it concocts a headache giving mixture of hope and despair, headache giving because it confirms simply that there can be no hope without despair. But what should one do when those tasked with reigning us out in times of despair are themselves sinking in doubt?\n\nEthan Hawke in a career defining performance plays Reverend Ernst Toller, a former military chaplain who is now faced with convincing an environmental activist who strongly believes that we are headed for the worst of times and it is all our doing.\n\nThe restraint in film-making and lack of score, automatically puts the weight of the film on the actors and the success of the themes on the lines that they speak. Hawke is excellent and we must take time to thank the lines on his forehead, which jump from disinterest to doubt to finality of despair.\n\nA spiritually moving and transformative film, which made me feel the truly small nature of our collective existence and how helpless we are in the great problems that we create for ourselves.\n\nFinally, it felt like a great movie.\n\nFYC: Spyder\n\nHas there been any Hollywood movie that has influenced so many Indian filmmakers within a short while than Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight? Maybe it is about the obsession with creating an antagonist.\n\nOh but I’m only thinking out loud, but it could really be the next on the ‘movies-we-look-up to-for-immediate-inspiration’ after Coppola’s The Godfather.\n\nBut the Batman and Joker are already part of larger conscious because of decades of multimodal existence, making it easier for writers to evoke invested past strands and bring to life the characters; it is not the same case in a Telugu-Tamil bilingual; a genre where a master in the culinary arts would not feel out of place.\n\nSuch movies are not called masala for nothing.\n\nThe Dark Knight is a (dark) blockbuster superhero movie, the near equivalent from what we have is the south Indian mass masala. While some of it can be considered as comic, but here the word does not refer to periodicals out of which characters leap out of.\n\nMass masala by itself depends much on its leading man and the story gives into him. By that very statement it means that these films are meant to work only for those who buy into the charms (or lack-of) of the star.\n\nWhich means that for the most part the writer-directors are restricted in their choice of ingredients, sometimes they have to make do with just one condiment, more often than not trick the audience by throwing garam masala in our eyes.\n\nAR Murugadoss seems to, in my eyes at least an expert chef who can find different uses for the same ingredient.\n\n(I am really overdoing this samayal-cinema analogy, must come to the point before things get over cooked)\n\nUnder The Influence\n\nI believe more than the act of being inspired by another work, it is more important to know why that particular inspirational moment worked and think before replicating it.\n\nSpyder’s hero does what Batman wanted Lucius Fox to do, listen in on people; while the ethical ramifications of spying are superficially dealt, they provide a convincing motivation for the lead; to prevent crime before it happens.\n\nYes, this could be the pre-crime from Minority Report but it could also be the inversion that is seen in ARM films like making a Vijaykanth film without making a Vijaykanth film?\n\nThe hero becomes a mass hero as a reaction to personal tragedies or societal atrocities, but can he/she really still be called a hero by preventing events from happening and not let the world know?\n\nBut it isn’t really an inversion unless you follow through with the act of an unseen hero, ultimately compulsions prevail and there is a love track and so there must be songs and an overblown climactic fight which makes you forget the questions that the film tried to raise earlier.\n\nEspecially notable is when Madan Karky rhymes mosam with awesome and concludes love is eternal much like plastic.\n\nBut Spyder is still somewhere there and even these commercial elements are not without joy.\n\nWho Wants To Be A Hero?\n\nEarlier in the Spyder, a scene made me reflect on an underlying theme in Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, that every person is capable of heroism, Bruce obviously states this in the concluding chapter but there are enough visual examples.\n\nThe way the common folk are involved in the events that happen to the city, not just as observers but as active participants, they are not alienated in the good vs. evil battle nor are they just used as bait for the hero to rescue.\n\nBut why?\n\nIn Spyder’s best segment which lasts about 20 minutes, has nothing to do with Mahesh Babu or the antagonist S J Suryah, but about common people (middle aged ladies in this case) finding courage to do what they would not normally do and lend a helping hand beyond possible imagination.\n\nIt worked totally for me and convinced that this involvement of the nameless with whom we can identify, add to how we receive a film.\n\nYes yes, S J Suryah character and how he seems to have played it tries to match Heath Ledger’s Joker in every step, but then there is more to the Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nOnly if we choose to see, hence for your consideration.\n\nSo we all know what an FRS is right? right?\n\n-100: To us, we haven’t changed this boring intro, even with 14 writers on our payroll the fact that we can’t write a decent opening, shows the levels at which incompetence has seeped into the Laureate.<SHAME>\n\n+5: Movie has no narration, a virtue especially when the last film we saw was Taramani.\n\n-5: Whenever minor character says that they have x levels of security means mega security failure will happen within x minutes (Mega Security Mazhuppal Rule)\n\n+30: Two eastern European uncles have been cast in such a way that just by looking at them you will know that they are villains, one has cigar also\n\n-51.25: When confronted by assassin, victims will state their name, age occupation, designation and aadhar number(liberals no need to provide) so as to make life easier for the assassin.\n\nAssassin is of course our AK\n\n+21: hero’s name is AK!! hero’s character name is also AK!! how cool is that, i mean how inventive #AK25.\n\n+101: How the movies have changed, like actors used to ‘play’ characters like villain, spy, doctor, minister etc; but in Vivegam it is what critics will call ‘turning-genre-by-the-head’\n\nWait buddies, we will explain.\n\nLike Vivegam is not a story about a spy, it is about Ajith Kumar (AK) if he had chosen to become a spy instead of an actor. Yes that is the story.\n\n+34: Writer-Director has embarked on toughest task of making every dialogue that AK speaks as punch dialogue.\n\nEven when AK asks for sugar it is so menacing that you will not let children go near AK. More about children later\n\n-54: Story? LOL what story?\n\n-129.07: Messaging: Like this is not a movie this is AK’s personal videos to his fans,\n\n+21: Serbians are not going to like this film\n\n+50: AK’s super power is that no bullet will hit him unless he wills it himself, much like Mahabharatam Bheeshmar.\n\n+112.33: When facing an entire army, always look at the camera and speak with optimism in tamil, this itself will confuse them. (AK’s escapism rule)\n\n-34.5: As expected, dutiful AK will have cute family life\n\n-11: GVM school of non-ordinary heroine naming, here it is Yazhnini, and of course she is a carnatic music teacher in inteeerior Serbia.\n\nHi to Cleveland Thyagaraj+ Death Metal Thangaraj\n\nOh wait, they also run cute tamil organic food restaurant which is popular among the locals. <Yeppa Dei Nativity>\n\n-379: However cute, children must not be allowed in cooking area, safety reasons.\n\n-150: Cute children\n\n-29: As usual, hero looking at heroine playing with rain drops scene, hence love shot\n\nPokkiri Pongal and all ok, have you seen Serbian Pongal? #Internaaational\n\n+17: Yazhini is so the dutiful wife that even Valluvar’s Vasuki will have to take morning tuition from her.\n\n-600: AK-Yaazhini level ideal couple pressures will seep into real life for couples after seeing the film.\n\nNot ruling out divorce based on this pressure.\n\n-89.12: Anti-Terror Squad head-office looks like one IT company with reception and all, I think they might have pre-sales division also, if free please put out JD at naukri boys!\n\n+109: As expected head of Anti-Terror Squad is played by one person who will believe whatever people will say\n\n+45: Hobbies: apart from being a top class spy, killer, assassin, strategist, husband, organic food chain owner AK is also a New York Times best-selling author\n\n-300: War as photo-op: no seriously if you are army uncle in Serbia you will have lot of time to stand on tanks, do circumambulation to fighter jet, go to picnic, take and remove sun-glasses.\n\nYes, in slow motion.\n\n-6.7K: Everyone talks about AK, every single character will talk about AK in the film, AK also talks about AK.\n\n+23: Director believes hackers can do anything in life. ANYTHING\n\n-56: If you are low ranking/new recruit in the espionage business you will be treated as a comedy piece (Arumaiprakagasam)\n\n+902: Main Job of main villain is not to break the world into pieces but to praise AK, second job of main villain is to take over the world.\n\n+15: Dei, in this movie everything is one hologram, even things you can do in simple PPT these villains will show in hologram.\n\nYeppa sci-tech-death\n\n+15: Level of data analytics is MAX. eg: villain will shout: find the total number of running trains in Serbia, in that how many people are watching hot star in that how many people are eating lays chips type questions and his data team will give the answer within seconds.\n\nAdd to this, you will see 456 types of tracking and hacking #scitechdeath\n\nWe asked our data analytics team in Pune a simple question, how many people visit our blog nu. Still these fellows are giving reports.\n\n-433: For our data analytics team\n\nAK does data analytics in his mind only, so he does not need team.\n\n+9: Phoenix paravai!\n\n-213: Mind numbing mind games AK and villain will play for three hours, at this point we shouted “VARENNNN MAAAA!” into our phones and recorded the same for future use\n\nAlso all fights become tiring because anyhow you know that AK is phoenix paravai and nothing will happen to him.\n\n-0.98: Analysts are telling that running time of the movie increased…..because….of….the….way…..AK…………spoke………………the……….dialogues……..given to…….him…..\n\n-75: Spy uncles think that shutting down satellites is like switching off fan while leaving classroom\n\n+101: Carnatic-mixed-martial arts based climax fight. One of its kind in Indian cinema.\n\nAK’s T shirt rule: quality of t shirt will deteriorate towards the end of the movie so that it can be torn to reveal torso\n\nYes they have promised sequel and all.\n\nTill then….\n\nNEVER.EVER.GIVE.UP.\n\nSubham/Ungal Naam\n\nThe FRS Team\n\nI have concluded that reading Raymond Chandler at an impressionable age has contributed the most to my further life choices, be it ‘literature’, movies, terse sentences and of course typing in the ‘courier new’ font.\n\nChandler started writing when the oil industry crashed and he had nothing much left to do, his creation reflects himself; being weary is his core competence.\n\nIf I could go back and play the irritating game invented for social engagement, ‘describe your creation in just one word’, Chandler would have said “tired”. If he was kind, he would add, “I’m tired. Enough!” As always breaking the rules.\n\nSo when there is a delay in our usual blog posts, it is probably because we are generally tired. Tired of ourselves, tired of the world, tired and yet careful not to add the growing empty mass that is film writing. Readers must be thankful in that case.\n\nWe forgot to add one word to the above: growing boring empty mass that is film writing.\n\nBoring.\n\n“You’re a very good-looking man to be in this kinda business”\n\nEnter Robert Mitchum\n\nMarlowe is supposed to be in his mid-thirties in the works, curiously but not unnatural the best portrayals of the private eye has come from very old ‘has-seen-it-all’ men.\n\nBogart was in his forties and Robert Mitchum almost touching sixty, it’s that kind of a role. It requires that kind of experience, it is the ‘hamlet’ of all detective roles, no I’m not joking. A sequel to the Big Sleep was called ‘Perchance to Dream’ which is from the famous of all famous soliloquies.\n\nPeople and war have made our hero tired, and out of this tiredness comes sparkling wisdom.\n\nWhy does Marlowe still do it?\n\nFor the much quoted “25 dollars a day plus expenses?”\n\nNah, Marlowe doesn’t snoop around for money, but he doesn’t evoke moral mightiness too, he certainly doesn’t identify with a cause or putting criminal behind bars. Thankfully he is not insufferable with his ‘genius’ and actually very funny, like a real person.\n\nI guess he just likes looking at people and what they do.\n\nLooking brings us to Robert Mitchum, in many ways the spiritual remnant of Bogart’s distant masculinity, but looking at Mitchum’s eyes we know that this present sadness had once seen sparkle, that alone makes me feel that Mitchum is truer as Marlowe.\n\nMarlowe watches because he knows that deep down all the depravity there is some tenderness, that’s all he looks for in a client, not money, not name, not fame. And he will do anything to look at that tiny true part of yourself.\n\nEvil doesn’t startle him as much as innocence and goodness\n\nPeople first, plot go to hell\n\nFor Chandler, the plot was secondary, the characters weren’t, he would never describe anyone unfairly nor would he puncture them for the sake of plot.\n\nAn open opponent of this whole locked room plotting business made him see people as people and not as clues or alibi to get going to the next page.\n\nMarlowe is the same wise-ass to the police as he is to the crooks. An ending in a Chandler story is not its logical conclusion or hurrah for its hero, but the acceptance of reality.\n\nThe thread of Farewell My Lovely the film is very simple and it follows the book closely, just out of jail thug Moose Malloy wants to get his girl back. Will Marlowe do it or not?\n\nAnd the hits keep on coming\n\nMarlowe is always narrating his tale, when we meet him he is just out of a case, naturally tired; Mitchum looks like he just wants to go home but cannot when confronted by his innocent of a thug client.\n\nWithin moments Marlowe becomes the centre-piece of a worm caught in a web, and all he does is just give a sideward glance.\n\nVery easy to be dismissed as non-acting, especially in the age that we live in (as in the golden age of non-acting); but I think tiredness is difficult to bring out as an emotion without being dramatic.\n\nMitchum gets hit on the head, shot at, danced with, seduced by, but all through the film but he plays it like a detective who knows the ending every single time, people will be people.\n\nI don’t really care about the twist in the end\n\nThere is a twist in the end, but the film (naturally the novel) is not moving towards it a big reveal way, for fans of detective fiction and crime thrillers this could prove dampening.\n\nMany things happen and so does a twist.\n\nDetection truly could be one of the most boring jobs if not for the humongous amounts of exciting literature written about it.\n\n<pause for reflection>\n\nMaybe all jobs are boring or it is the nature of them to become boring. But somehow Marlowe and hence Mitchum(because of his ability to understand the character) seem to have cracked it.\n\nThis detective is a seeker of the intangible, something remote and indescribable as human kindness, that is his spiritual quest, something not even the thighs of a femme fatale or the muzzle of a gun could distract him from.\n\nHamlet of the detective class, indeed.\n\nThat’s an admirable state to be in and this is an admirable movie.\n\nOut of the past is our series on movies that are anything but current,new,fresh etc; we find the idea of film writing just for the sake of a movie release distressing and also it demeans the timelessness of film itself. Mad or what, we won’t be reviewing old films,just writing about them.\n\nSo, you guys are quite familiar with what FRS is right? Right?\n\nWe have no idea why we keep asking this, but it cuts the cackle and come to the osses’.\n\nYes, that is a phrase.\n\nIt is a phrase like how AAA is a movie.\n\n+500: This movie got made, absolutely. Like if you are screenwriter, which means you are also the director here and if you walk up to a financier and say that this is going to be my movie, we don’t know; maybe there a lot of risk hungry financiers out there or let’s just call this Avant-garde art film( we have no idea what it means, but if you are in a written quiz this phrase will fetch you part points somewhere), because none of us are equipped to even classify what AAA is.\n\nWhat is AAA? Let’s find out seekers of the truth, let’s find out.\n\n-5: above phrase has repetition, to add effect.\n\n-389.108: narration irritations, like seventy years of movie making and people can’t kick this habit and in AAA we don’t even know who is narrating, some old fellow somewhere in dubai etc, the whole film is narrated in his POV but then again scenes are not written from his POV which means that we are shown things that he has no way of knowing, this is simple boss, why should we keep saying these things. Who is this narrator guy anyway? Troubling.\n\nJust start with something like you guys know what FRS is right? Right? People who know will follow, others will find out, if they want.\n\n-10: Dubai\n\n-25: If hero goes to Dubai he will become a Don only (not oxford don, underworld don)\n\nThis is of course an extension of the rule, if hero goes to X location, he will become an underworld don only. No other occupation is worthy of the Tamil movie hero, he is either simpleton farmer, urban agitator or underworld don.\n\nHe protects the masses in all cases. Of course, gets the girl also.\n\nIntroducing let’s blame it on Godfather clause, ever since Coppola’s movie came out, every other filmmaker thinks it is the best profession for mass hero which results in over romanticising of illegal activities. Like have u guys seen Goodfellas or not?\n\n-15: Madurai\n\nIf hero is from Madurai he will not be veterinary doctor, he will be ‘veritanama killer’ only, also obviously, he will work for a don there, like not even freelancing.\n\n-30: Movie made with the assumption that even killing a life is justifiable, as long it is done by a hero.\n\n+50: Hero syndrome: In AAA hero’s friends believe that Madurai Michael is special, but example of his speciality is ever displayed, yes he kills people for living, but then friends be like “Wow da dei super da, semma da”.\n\nIn real life, real friends assess you and bluntly put out your lack of talent in stuff out in the open.\n\nLike how our friends tell us all the time that we suck at writing, but we continue to, maybe we should get some cinematic friends who praise even the shite that we write.\n\nNevertheless, this is becoming too emotional for us.\n\n-10: Hero’s friends have no reason to be alive expect to sing praise of the hero.\n\nUpdate to the reader: 500 words and we haven’t even come to the opening song sequence yet\n\nWe try and improve our vocabulary once in a while, like hey, we are writers you know and the new word we are using here is: demure.\n\n-12: Demure lady falls in love with demolishing hero trope. Also, if you are contract killer in Madurai, you have enough time to do romance and all. Must be good profession. But no work from home option available since it is an on the road job. Hmm.\n\n+50: Opening song, hero claims that he is no one without us. (not the Laureate, us here refers to the audience at the large). Which is true because we buy tickets.\n\n-17: Why will a town celebrate a contract killer, who like weekly kills one of their own is a big question that needs answering. Unless of course Madurai Michael and STR are used interchangeably.\n\n-25: Heroine’s father portrayed like a stupid man who has a ‘thing’ for switches, the sad state of heroine’s father is a sorrow song in the history of tamil cinema.\n\nNotice how Y Gee Mahendran has Bhiarava wig.\n\nEverybody has a wig in Madurai, hair raising city.\n\n-10: Mouth to mouth resuscitation which can bring back a life in emergencies is used for comedy effect\n\n-10: Something something happens and we end up with an old STR who is an ex-underworld don but now in Chennai feeding pigeons under the alias Ashwin Thata.\n\nYes, really.\n\n<Insert Interval Block here>\n\n-12: Thata means not really thata, Simbu looks more like middle aged only, but I guess at this point in the movie they don’t really care.\n\n-51: failed prosthetics is failed only. Gurunathar Michael Westmore will not be happy.\n\n+34: Ashwin Thata wears good clothes that even IT employees don’t get to wear on fun Fridays.\n\nIf you don’t know fun Fridays, then you are better off not knowing.\n\n+5: Tammanna aka Tammy plays a social worker who life mission is to bring happiness to the lives of elders.\n\n+6: Since Tammy is doing this social service, we hope this will be followed by millions of youth\n\n+11: Heavy duty Tammy dancing, not Devi level though\n\n-57: All songs whenever, wherever, most mimic STRs previous films, tune setting everything\n\n+5: veteran Nilu calling up STR and addressing him as Machi. LOL\n\nSuddenly Tammy & thata become expert painters of portraits, when and where did they learn this art, do underworld dons go to summer camps with kids to learn water colors?\n\nInteresting questions, no answers\n\nA repenting ageing don, seeking to colour the rest of his life by joining a summer painting class. Now that’s a movie there. Go make it, ideas are not only bulletproof, here we give it for free.\n\n-91: Director thinks mere presence of Mottai Rajendran and Kovai Sarala will make us laugh like anything, like they need to do something hai na?\n\n+100: Director gives three to four movies for the price of one, in fact AAA is an assemblage of all STR films put together, there is a monologue like VTV about love, there is the age difference love matter from Vallavan, there is the I will do anything for my friends thingy also from Vallavan, there is the “Dei all girls will ematify boys” from Manmadan, heck there is even a recreation of Thallipogadey from AYM with Mottai Rajendran and Kovai Sarala.\n\nThe last bit is a must watch for sophisticated GVM fans.\n\nYes, all of this is there in this one movie, in fact all of this happens in the second half which means that this movie has taken controlled randomness to a different level.\n\nYou know something is going to happen, but you don’t know what, but you can guess it is from an earlier STR film.\n\nAAA itself is an existential film where STR lays out all his glories and worries right before the audience and asks them to choose what path he must take, it is really deep that way.\n\n-56: Three four fights happen, but we didn’t really get what was happening\n\n-26: Two hours into movie and director cannot decide if the movie is romance, gangster or comedy\n\n-71: Tammy thinks (or director wants tammy character to think) Rajni+Kamal=STR (actual line, not extrapolated by FRS fact checking team)\n\n-34: Hero spends two minutes explaining to everyone the ill effects of drinking.\n\nStarts drinking next second\n\n+68.91: Thikku Siva LOL Spoilers LOL\n\n-145: General discourse on how boys and how girls are….yeppa yawn\n\n<Insert cue for part two>\n\n<Yes there is more>\n\nUntil then it is goodbye from\n\nTHE FRS Team\n\nSubam"
