In its most obvious application, it says that courts will not prevent harm if money damages could adequately compensate for the harm. It says that I am free to destroy your property as long as I can pay for it. I suspect that this rule sounds absurd to people who are neither lawyers nor economists. When it comes time to actually apply the rule, it seems absurd to courts as well. Courts do prevent harm when they can. Judicial opinions recite the rule constantly, but they do not apply it. After surveying more than 1400 cases, I conclude that the irreparable injury rule is dead—dead in the practical sense that it almost never affects the results of cases. Plaintiffs usually get the remedies they seek, because courts usually find that other remedies are inadequate. When courts reject plaintiff's choice of remedy, there is always some other reason, and that reason has nothing to do with the irreparable injury rule. We can identify the real reasons for decision, and use those reasons to explain old cases and decide new cases. This book concludes with a tentative restatement of those reasons, and with a proposal for formal legislative repeal of the irreparable injury rule. This book has a unified negative thesis—the irreparable injury rule is dead. It also has an affirmative thesis—nearly all the operative law of remedies can be stated without reference to the irreparable injury rule. This affirmative thesis is an umbrella for a host of small and middle-sized insights. For me at least, explaining remedies law without the irreparable injury rule has clarified all sorts of things. I hope some of my readers have similar reactions.\n\nVlll\n\nPREFACE\n\nChapter 1 sets out the theoretical framework for the rest of the book. I seek to complete the assimilation of equity, and to eliminate the last remnant of the conception that equity is subordinate, extraordinary, or unusual. The distinction between legal and equitable remedies is irrelevant except where it is codified, most notably in constitutional guarantees of jury trial. Outside that context, I would not ask whether a remedy is legal or equitable. Instead, I would ask functional questions: Is the remedy specific or substitutionary, is it a personal command or an impersonal judgment, is it preliminary or permanent? Most important, does it impose unnecessary costs in a particular case? Chapters 2 through 9 test the claims of Chapter 1 against the actual behavior of courts. I explore the relationships among remedies, and identify the real policies that motivate choices among alternative remedies. I explore the relationships between these real policies and the rhetoric of irreparable injury. Chapter 10 tries to integrate the real policies into larger patterns, and emphasizes that the phrase \"irreparable injury\" can describe all these policies only if it has no meaning of its own. Chapter 11 examines the the legal-economic theory of efficient breach of contract. The death of the irreparable injury rule removes the positive law support for the most important applications of efficient breach theory. This edifice of contemporary legal scholarship is based on a misunderstanding of the law of remedies, a misunderstanding induced by the misleading rhetoric of the irreparable injury rule. Finally, Chapter 12 offers proposals for reform, including my tentative restatement of the operative rules. The chapters on the cases are supported by citation to most of the 1400 cases—by multiple citations to many of them. Why so many citations, and what jurisprudential theory underlies them? String cites are out of style among academics; for some legal theorists, reading cases is out of style. Academic lawyers rarely marshal cases in support of normative claims. I marshal the cases in support of a positive claim. I cite the cases more for what they do than for what they say; indeed, I cite them principally to show that they almost never do what they say. My colleague Sandy Levinson tells me that my use of the cases is \"relentlessly realist.\" This characterization scores a point in our\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nendless friendly argument over indeterminacy and formalism; I am the one who thinks that doctrine sometimes matters. In fact the book is both realist and doctrinal. One of its goals is to conform doctrine to reality. Bad doctrine matters because it confuses us—scholars, judges, and practitioners alike. The irreparable injury rule distracts analysis from the real relationships among remedial choices. It highlights the obsolete distinction between law and equity, and subordinates more functional schemes for classifying remedies. It treats the rule as the exception and extraordinarily rare exceptions as the rule. An intuitive sense of justice has led judges to produce sensible results, but there has been no similar pressure to produce sensible explanations. It remains to explain why I cite so many cases. I initially envisioned an article of moderate length, citing only a modest number of illustrative cases. It soon became clear that such an approach would suffice for some readers, but not for others. The traditional understanding had too strong a hold; a significant minority was simply unconvinced. I suppose it would have been easy to pick a few examples consistent with my theory. To the skeptical, a few examples were not enough. And so the project expanded, with more research, more analysis, and especially more notes. One serendipitous byproduct is that the book now offers a thorough survey of the role of injunctions in contemporary litigation. The notes provide a repository of information for further research, and I have tried to facilitate further research with a detailed index and a table of cases arranged by jurisdiction. I have generally omitted multiple cases on the same point from the same jurisdiction. Even so, the notes are massive. Readers so inclined can safely ignore them. The notes contain citations, parenthetical information about the sources cited, and nothing more. The rare textual footnotes are generally at the bottom of the page. In a few cases where that was awkward, I state in text that the note contains additional explanation. Even so, I urge readers to at least browse in the notes. The best way to get your own sense of what the courts are really doing is to sample the parenthetical descriptions of the cited cases. To facilitate browsing, the notes are at the end of each chapter, and each note is identified by a caption as well as by a number. In\n\nX\n\nPREFACE\n\nciting all these cases, I have taken advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation. Despite the invaluable help of my research assistants, I personally read every cited case. I read most of them at least twice. Reading so many cases was burdensome, but it was not dull. I found striking examples, and I found whole lines of cases and fact patterns that I had not known about. Not surprisingly, I found that a large sample of cases is richer than any treatise. I have tried to offer readers the benefits of that richness without the burdens. The text identifies broad patterns in the cases, and offers a few of the best illustrations; I have tried to keep it readable and brief. For those sufficiently interested, there are plenty of further examples in the notes. A preliminary draft of parts of this project appeared as an article in the Harvard Law Review for January 1990. I am grateful to the Harvard Law Review and Oxford University Press for cooperating in the publication of both the article and the book. Austin June 1990\n\nD. L.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis book has a long history, and I have accumulated many debts along the way. The book would still be unfinished were it not for a generous series of research leaves in 1989. The Shell Oil Company Foundation supported my treatment of specific performance of contracts, which is integrated throughout the book and culminates in Chapter 11. The University Research Institute at The University of Texas supported a leave to work on religious liberty, but graciously acquiesced when irreparable injury swallowed most of the semester. The Allan Shivers Research Fund at The University of Texas Law School supported the final stages of writing and editing. Dean Mark Yudof was supportive at every step, both financially and intellectually. The roots of this project go back almost twenty years, when I was first convinced that the Supreme Court had misused the irreparable injury rule to regulate federal interference with state prosecutions. Two of my early articles were on that problem. Shortly thereafter, I reviewed Owen Fiss's book proposing abolition of the irreparable injury rule. My review concluded with a crude and premature formulation of the thesis of this book. I remember Frank Zimring urging me to expand the point into a major article, but I looked at him blankly. At that stage in my career, I had said all that I knew how to say. Richard Posner said I should have offered more examples of cases that misused the rule. To my embarrassment, I realized that I did not have any more examples, and that I could not readily find any. There is no digest number for \"rule misused.\" I assume that these former colleagues quickly forgot those conversations, but I did not.\n\nXll\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI read more widely for the irreparable injury chapter of my casebook, and the pattern in the cases persisted. Legal remedies were never adequate except when there was some other reason to deny equitable remedies. I formulated the thesis more ambitiously, but also more precisely, and I developed more confidence in it. I presented the thesis to faculty workshops at Duke in 1983, at Boston University in 1985, and at Texas in 1987. I wrote the first draft of an article at the University of Hawaii in the summer of 1986. I am grateful for the helpful reactions of these four faculties, and for office space and library privileges at Hawaii. 1 also presented the project to the Remedies Section at the meeting of the Association of American Law Schools in 1990. I benefitted from formal commentary by Alan Schwartz and Doug Rendleman, and from spontaneous audience reaction. I did most of the technical manuscript preparation during a visit at Michigan in winter semester 1990. I am especially grateful to the skeptics who were not persuaded by the summary treatment in those early versions, and to Dan Dobbs, Tom Rowe, and Scot Powe, who had disparate but vigorous reactions. These three scholars were helpful and encouraging in the usual ways, but each of them let slip one uncompromisingly blunt sentence that went to the heart of what I thought I was doing. Perhaps without realizing the full implications of their comments, they made clear that I had utterly failed to communicate my own vision of what I was about. These reactions led to a quantum expansion of the project. Fortunately, these reactions were balanced by that of Jay Westbrook. Jay was as excited about the project as I was—more so, because he did not have to read all the cases. He reinforced my judgment that I was on to something more important than I had communicated in early drafts. He read two complete drafts and many substantial fragments; he served as strategic consultant, writing coach, and one-man booster club. Jack Balkin, Owen Fiss, Sandy Levinson, Bill Powers, and Charles Silver also read drafts and offered help. Mary Kay Kane and Jean Love made extraordinarily detailed comments on a hybrid draft halfway between article and book. Hal Bruff and Tom McGarity read Chapter 6 and tried to protect me from error with respect to administrative law; Mark Gergen, Dick Markovits, Dick\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nWright, and Mark Yudof performed the same service on Chapter 11. Jim Treece helped me unravel the commercial disparagement and false advertising cases in Chapter 7. Lea Vaughn saved me from a misreading of Michigan labor law in Chapter 8. Karen Patton Bogle, research assistant extraordinaire and now an associate at Sullivan & Cromwell, undertook to find and classify the 400 most recent irreparable injury cases. Despite her best efforts, my classification scheme eventually broke down in the face of the real world's complexity. But her work created the core of the project's empirical base, and her count of permanent and preliminary injunction cases still appears in Chapter 5. Subsequent cohorts of research assistants helped to solve unsolved mysteries, find missing sources, check citations, and update Karen's sample of cases. These indispensable helpers included Debbie Backus, Denise Brady, Deborah Coldwell, William Cunningham, Dana Elfin, Georgia Harper, Jay Harper, Larry Pascal, Susan Waelbroeck, and Mark Walker at Texas, and Audrey Anderson and Kathleen Bradley at Michigan. Joan Baron, Mari Campos, and Peter Smits at Texas pinch hit when my own research assistants were unavailable. The Alice McKean Young Regents Chair in Law and the Shell Oil Company Foundation funded extra research assistance in the final push to completion. Cheryl Harris, my industrious and overqualified secretary at Texas, created tables of cases out of raw footnotes and helped in many other ways as well. Darlene Lentz cheerfully leaped into the breach during my semester at Michigan. To all these people, who helped in so many ways, thank you.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nContents\n\n1.

The other comes from the United States Reports for June of 1988. Which is which? And which better describes the current state of the law? The first statement is the recent one, from a dissent by Justice Scalia. Two other justices joined him. But it is not the law. It is not even close to the law. It is merely a spectacular example of the confusion created by one of our archaic \"rules\" for choosing among remedies. It states an extreme but recognizable version of the traditional understanding, even though it is wildly wrong as a description of what courts do. The second statement is not quite right either, but it captures an important part of the truth and it comes much closer to de3\n\n4\n\nTHE DEATH OE THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nscribing judicial behavior. Remedies that prevent harm altogether are often better for plaintiffs, and are always closer to the ideal of corrective justice. A plaintiff should have such a remedy if she wants it and if there is no good reason to deny it. A general preference for damages is not a reason, but a statement of the conclusion. Courts should not prefer damages unless there is some reason to prefer damages. Pomeroy thought that courts had recognized this a century ago. But neither his treatise nor the accumulating cases have had much impact on the traditional understanding. The traditional understanding is a product of the most general and most misleading of the rules for choosing remedies, the irreparable injury rule. This rule says that equitable remedies are unavailable if legal remedies will adequately repair the harm. 3 Frequent repetition of the rule seems to imply that legal remedies are generally adequate; otherwise, the rule would not be so important. Thus an able scholar writes, \"Our materialistic society considers money an acceptable substitute for most recognized interests.\"4 If damages are generally adequate, then equitable remedies are generally unavailable. Justice Scalia's conclusion seems to follow: that our legal system prefers damages after the fact. Our legal system does not prefer damages. I will develop and defend this thesis on the basis of a large sample of recent cases. I will first show how courts have escaped the irreparable injury rule without repudiating it. Then I will show the quite different purposes for which courts invoke the rule's misleading rhetoric. In the process, 1 hope to clarify the choice between damages and injunctions across the whole range of modern law—clarify it in a way that is helpful to scholars, judges, and practitioners alike. Courts have escaped the irreparable injury rule by denning adequacy in such a way that damages are never an adequate substitute for plaintiff's loss. Thus, our law embodies a preference for specific relief if plaintiff wants it. The principal doctrinal expression of this preference is the rule that damages are inadequate unless they can be used to replace the specific thing that plaintiff lost. Damages can be used in this way for only one category of losses: to replace fungible goods or routine services in an orderly market. In that\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n5\n\ncontext, damages and specific relief are substantially equivalent. Either way, plaintiff winds up with the very thing he wanted, and the preference for specific relief becomes irrelevant. In all other contexts, there is ample basis in precedent and principle for holding that damages are inadequate. Courts ignore this body of precedent, and find damages adequate, only when there is some identifiable reason to deny specific relief in a particular case. The largest group of such cases arise on motions for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions. Denying relief at that stage serves the important purpose of protecting defendant's right to a full hearing, and a stringent variation of the irreparable injury rule lets the court openly balance the risks to each side. The vocabulary of adequate remedy and irreparable injury is common to both stages, but the competing considerations are quite different. Preliminary relief is best considered as a separate issue, only distantly related to the choice of remedy at final judgment. At final judgment, specific relief is problematic only occasionally. Sometimes it imposes undue hardship on defendant; sometimes it interferes with the authority of another tribunal or bypasses a more particularized remedy; sometimes it is impractical to supervise; sometimes we have special reasons for preserving jury trial; sometimes the court does not really want to grant any relief at all. The irreparable injury rule may be offered in support of these results, but that is misleading. These real reasons for denying equitable remedies are not derived from the adequacy of the legal remedy or from any general preference for damages. The meanings of \"irreparable\" and \"adequate\" are constantly manipulated to achieve sensible results. I conclude that the irreparable injury rule is dead. It does not describe what the cases do, and it cannot account for the results. Equally abandoned are such corollary expressions5 as \"injunctions are an extraordinary remedy.\" 6 Injunctions are routine, and damages are never adequate unless the court wants them to be. Courts can freely turn to either line of precedents, depending on whether they want to hold the legal remedy adequate or inadequate. Whether they want to hold the legal remedy adequate depends on whether they have some other reason to deny the equitable remedy, and it is these other reasons that drive the decisions. Courts\n\n6\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nmay balance the costs of the equitable remedy against plaintiff's need for it, and in that sense the degree of inadequacy may matter. But this balancing process is triggered by variations in the cost of the equitable remedy, not by variations in the adequacy of the legal remedy. Instead of one general principle for choosing among remedies— legal remedies are preferred where adequate—we have many more specific rules. There is a rule about fungible goods in orderly markets, a rule about preliminary relief, a rule about undue hardship, and so on. These rules are often stated in the cases. But when courts invoke these rules, they often go on to invoke the irreparable injury rule as well. And sometimes they rely solely or principally on the irreparable injury rule, leaving the application of some more precise rule merely implicit in their statement of the case. Analysis would be both simpler and clearer if we abandoned the irreparable injury rule and spoke directly of the real reasons for choosing remedies. I will conclude with a preliminary restatement of these operative rules. A defender of the traditional understanding might deny that I have identified a set of operative rules capable of replacing the irreparable injury rule, and claim instead that I have merely identified the policy reasons for the traditional rule. That is, perhaps the irreparable injury rule survives, and its modern justifications are these problems with specific relief that I call the real reasons for decision. Recent defenses of the traditional rule may be read in this way. 7 If these defenders would agree that the policy reasons for the rule should control and limit its application, then the difference between us is largely one of characterization. But their characterization does not fit the cases. The irreparable injury rule is stated as a rule of general applicability for choosing between legal and equitable remedies, expressing a preference for legal remedies over the whole range of litigation. The operative rules that I have identified each apply to a specific and limited set of cases. None of these rules has any effect in the vast range of cases reviewed in Chapters 2 and 3. Even within their scope, the operative rules do not express any consistent preference for legal remedies. The real reasons for decisions arc to avoid difficulties in particular cases, and\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n1\n\nthese difficulties are not limited to equity. Some operative rules prefer legal remedies, but a few prefer equitable remedies, and others use different categories altogether. These rules cannot be derived from any coherent version of the irreparable injury rule, and the irreparable injury rule cannot account for the results. Irreparable injury rhetoric has survived only as a label, to be affixed to opinions after the court has chosen the remedy on other grounds. In my analysis of the operative rules, I aspire to be more positive than normative, but more conceptual than descriptive. The analysis is positive in the sense that I describe what courts actually do. I do not argue merely that the irreparable injury rule should be abandoned; I argue that it has been abandoned in all but rhetoric. Even this claim has normative components. I assert that my account of the cases is the best account—best in the sense that it explains the cases in the simplest and most direct way, in the sense that it leaves the smallest number of \"wrong\" or \"exceptional\" cases unaccounted for, and in the sense that it produces better results than an account that would take the irreparable injury rule at face value and designate a different set of cases as wrong or exceptional.8 These normative elements are real, but they should not obscure the dominant positive element. I am explaining the results of existing cases. I argue for an important change in explanation, but for few changes in result. My analysis is conceptual in the sense that it is not bound by existing conceptual categories. Our existing conceptual categories are historical rather than functional. They are left over from a time when law and equity were administered in separate courts, or even from a time when each legal remedy was administered under a separate writ. The conventional rules are stated in terms of these ancient categories. In a radically changed judicial system, these rules have become obstacles to decision instead of guides. The courts have generally manipulated such rules to achieve just and functional results, but the formal rules, the vocabulary, and the conceptual categories have become dysfunctional. By emphasizing different conceptual categories, I hope to reverse the conventional relationship between the exception and the rule, and to clarify and simplify the entire field.\n\n8\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nA. The Irreparable Injury Rule\n\n1. The Equivalence of the Two Formulations The irreparable injury rule has two formulations. Equity will act only to prevent irreparable injury, and equity will act only if there is no adequate legal remedy. The two formulations are equivalent; what makes an injury irreparable is that no other remedy can repair it. 9 Attempts to distinguish the two formulations have produced a variety of proffered distinctions but no common usage.10 One of the proffered distinctions deserves emphasis, because it highlights an important point. The irreparable injury formulation is said to be more general than the no-adequate-legal-remedy formulation, because it omits the qualifier \"legal.\"11 The rule that equity will not act if there is no adequate legal remedy does not literally cover cases where a court denies a preliminary injunction because a permanent injunction will be adequate, or denies a receivership because an injunction will be adequate. The rule that equity will act only to prevent irreparable injury does not describe these cases either. When a court chooses between two equitable remedies, equity will act whatever the choice. A general formulation that does include these cases is that courts will grant an intrusive remedy only to prevent injury that cannot be prevented by any less intrusive remedy, or only when no less intrusive remedy is adequate. When the principle is formulated accurately, it remains the case that irreparable injury is equivalent to no adequate remedy. The adequacy and irreparability formulations become different only when they are stated at different levels of generality—when one is stated in terms of the dysfunctional distinction between law and equity, and the other is stated in terms of a functional choice between two remedies, such as preliminary and permanent injunction. \"Equity will act only when there is no adequate legal remedy\" is assuredly not the same as \"a preliminary injunction will issue only to prevent irreparable injury.\" But the difference is not between irreparability and inadequacy; the difference is between equity and preliminary injunction. I emphasize the point so that no reader can misunderstand my\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n9\n\nusage. I believe that no significant distinction can be drawn between the irreparable injury and no adequate remedy formulations. Nothing in my thesis requires readers to accept that judgment. But clear communication does require readers to understand that I will use the two formulations interchangeably. 2. The Possible Meanings of the Rule The irreparable injury rule has received considerable scholarly attention. In 1978, Owen Fiss examined the possible reasons for the rule and found them wanting.12 A vigorous debate over the economic wisdom of applying the rule to specific performance of contracts began about the same time,13 and soon came to center on the transaction costs of administering the two remedies.14 Both Fiss and Dan Dobbs have noted that the rule does not seem to be taken very seriously,15 and in a review of Fiss's book, I argued that the definition of adequacy pulls most of the rule's teeth.16 The Restatement (Second) of Torts dropped the rule from the blackletter and condemned it as misleading, but replaced it only with a long and unstructured list of factors to be considered.17 Doug Rendleman18 and Gene Shreve19 offered separate defenses of the rule, arguing that equitable remedies are generally more troublesome than legal remedies. But Rendleman conceded that the usual formulations of the rule divert analysis from the real policies at issue,20 and Shreve also seemed to think the rule is generally misunderstood.21 In all this policy debate, no one has extensively examined how the rule actually works. In my experience, many sophisticated lawyers believe that the rule continues to reflect a serious preference for legal over equitable remedies. The elaborate debate over the wisdom of the rule would be pointless unless the debaters thought the rule made a real difference in the results of cases. The three justices quoted at the beginning of this chapter are not the only modern lawyers to assume that the rule requires plaintiff to accept remedies that are plainly inferior but in some sense \"adequate.\"22 This traditional understanding can be stated with varying degrees of stringency. Indeed, enormous elasticity has been a central part of the rhetoric of irreparable injury and adequate remedy, essential\n\n10\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nto its survival. This elasticity threatens to make the rule nonfalsifiable; its supporters seem capable of assimilating any combination of results into the rule. A nonfalsifiable rule is like a nonfalsifiable scientific theory. If all possible results are consistent with the rule, then no case is decided by the rule, and it is not a rule at all. For the rule to be alive, it must be at risk of being proved dead. I cannot specify the rule for its defenders, but I can specify my own understanding of the minimum possible scope of the rule. What would I accept as proof that the rule is still alive, and what do I mean when I claim it is dead? These questions require a brief survey of the range of possible meanings. Adequacy seems to imply an absolute standard: Does the legal remedy reach the threshold of adequacy? Such a threshold might be low or high or in between. But adequacy may also imply a range of comparative standards: Is the legal remedy as good as the equitable remedy, or nearly as good, or half as good? Adequacy could even mean something like \"good enough in light of the costs of doing better,\" and that formulation could lead to case-by-case balancing of the effectiveness of the remedy awarded against the costs of the remedy plaintiff prefers. The rule has evolved in precisely this direction. It has evolved beyond the point where it can reasonably be called the irreparable injury rule. Perhaps the clearest statement of this trend appears in Edward Yorio's book on specific performance. For Yorio, \"the adequacy doctrine remains the linchpin of the rules governing specific performance.\"23 He defends the rule at length, but he defends it as the first step of a cost-benefit analysis. The purpose of the adequacy test in a system of contract remedies is to provide input on the marginal benefit that the promisee would derive from equitable relief. A finding that damages are inadequate means that the promisee would derive some marginal benefit from specific relief. . . . For specific performance to be proper, however, the marginal benefit to the promisee must be sufficiently great that it outweighs the marginal costs imposed on the promisor and on the legal system.24\n\nI can accept that standard, but its substance is not the irreparable injury rule. Yorio's standard is simply to pick the best remedy in\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n11\n\neach case after balancing the costs and benefits to plaintiff, defendant, and the court.* The weakest claim recognizable as a version of the irreparable injury rule is that courts balance costs, benefits, and a preference for legal remedies. The irreparable injury rule creates a hierarchy of remedies; it says that legal remedies are preferred over equitable remedies.25 If courts are simply balancing costs and benefits and picking the most appropriate remedy in each case, then they are doing exactly what Owen Fiss urged when he proposed to abolish the rule.26 Unless some preference for legal remedies operates across a wide range of cases and actually influences results, there is no remedial hierarchy and the irreparable injury rule is dead. If a weak preference for legal remedies is only a minor factor in a general balancing of costs and benefits, the irreparable injury rule is more misleading than helpful. In fact, except for the loss of fungible goods or services in an orderly market, there is not even a weak preference for legal remedies. Irreparable injury talk conceals a weak preference for the remedy preferred by plaintiff, and it conceals the focus on countervailing costs that can override plaintiff's preference.\n\nB. Refining the Question 1. Functional Choices in Remedies Law The irreparable injury rule distorts analysis by asking the wrong question. It purports to choose between legal and equitable remedies, but that is no longer a functional choice. History has its claims, and lawyers should understand the history of equity. But * Yorio may retain a procedural version of the irreparable injury rule. His book implies, and he has confirmed in conversation, that he would require plaintiff to make some showing of irreparable injury to initiate the cost-benefit analysis. Thus, a bursting-bubble presumption would favor the legal remedy, and plaintiff would bear the burden of coming forward with some reason why that remedy is inadequate. My own view is that a bursting-bubble presumption favors plaintiff's choice of remedy, and that defendant bears the burden of coming forward with some reason why that remedy should be denied. The merits of this disagreement are considered at the end of Chapter 10.\n\n12\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nlaw and equity have been merged for half a century in federal courts and for well over a century in many states. The legal or equitable origin of a remedy should no longer be the starting point for analysis. The law-equity distinction functions as a crude proxy for a set of more functional distinctions—for all the characteristics traditionally associated with equity. The choice of an equitable remedy is commonly thought to embody the choice of specific relief, a personal command to defendant, enforcement by the contempt power, the availability of preliminary relief and discretionary defenses, and the impossibility of jury trial. The choice of a legal remedy is thought to embody the opposite choices: substitutionary relief; an impersonal judgment; the unavailability of the contempt power, preliminary relief, and discretionary defenses; and a constitutional right to jury trial. There are two things wrong with using the law-equity distinction as a proxy for the underlying functional distinctions. First, there are many exceptions to the presumed relationships among law, equity, and the functional distinctions. Most of the characteristics associated with equity are sometimes available at law, and most of the characteristics associated with law are sometimes available in equity. Using law and equity as proxies for these characteristics is so crude that it is more misleading than helpful. Second, using law and equity as the analytic categories forces us to choose the whole bundle of characteristics as a unit. If in a particular case we want to preserve jury trial, or avoid the contempt power, then it appears that we must also give up specific relief, personal commands, preliminary relief, and discretionary defenses. If a personal injury victim desperately needs preliminary relief to pay for medical care, that is thought to be impossible because her claim is at law. Forcing courts to choose between legal remedies and equitable remedies is like forbidding voters to cast split-ticket ballots. In fact courts and legislatures sometimes unbundle the functional choices embedded in the law-equity distinction, and they should be free to unbundle further when appropriate. It is time to quit thinking in terms of the law-equity proxy, and to begin thinking directly in terms of the functional choices among remedies. The most fundamental remedial choice is between substitution-\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n13\n\nary and specific remedies. With substitutionary remedies, plaintiff suffers harm and receives a sum of money. Specific remedies seek to avoid this exchange. They aspire to prevent harm, or undo it, rather than let it happen and compensate for it. They seek to prevent harm to plaintiff, repair the harm in kind, or restore the specific thing that plaintiff lost. Substitutionary remedies include compensatory damages, attorneys' fees, restitution of the money value of defendant's gain, and punitive damages. Specific remedies include injunctions, specific performance of contracts, restitution of specific property, and restitution of a specific sum of money.27 The essence of the difference is illustrated by the closest case, restitution of a specific sum of money. Consider the choice of remedies for sale of defective goods. Plaintiff's substitutionary remedy is damages, measured by the difference between the value of the goods as promised and the value of the goods as delivered.28 His specific remedy is either specific performance or cancellation. Specific performance, if it is available, will give him goods that fully conform to the contract in exchange for his payment of the price. Cancellation will give him a full refund of the price—restitution of the sum of money—in exchange for his returning the goods.29 This example illustrates the two hallmarks of substitutionary relief. First, plaintiff gets neither what he started with—his money—nor what he was promised—goods conforming to the contract. Instead, he gets defective goods and money to compensate for the defect. Second, the sum of money he receives is based on a fact finder's valuation of his loss. The relief is substitutionary both in the sense that the sum of money is substituted for plaintiff's original entitlement, and in the less obvious sense that the fact finder's valuation of the loss is substituted for plaintiff's valuation. Specific relief aspires to avoid both these substitutions, giving plaintiff the very thing he lost if that is what he wants. The choice between specific and substitutionary remedies is not equivalent to the choice between legal and equitable remedies. Equitable remedies are a crude proxy for specific remedies, because most specific remedies are historically equitable: injunctions, specific performance, constructive trusts, subrogation, quiet title, and cancellation. But some are historically legal: ejectment, replevin, mandamus, prohibition, and habeas corpus. At least one,\n\n14\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nrescission, was historically available in either law or equity. Another, declaratory judgment, is a statutory creation that has been called legal,30 equitable,31 neither,32 or both,33 depending on the circumstances and the commentator. Orders to pay money were sometimes available in equity, and courts and legislators sometimes use equitable monetary relief to manipulate jurisdiction or avoid jury trial.34 The law-equity distinction duplicates the substitutionary-specific distinction in the most common cases, where the choice is between damages and injunctions or damages and specific performance. That is why Justice Scalia could plausibly state the irreparable injury rule in terms of preventing harm and awarding damages after the fact. Where the two distinctions overlap, I may refer to either. But replevin and ejectment are important sources of specific relief not subject to any version of the irreparable injury rule, and it distorts analysis to ignore them. The belief that our law prefers damages to specific relief is less plausible when one considers ejectment and replevin as well as injunctions and specific performance. Whenever it matters, I will emphasize the functional choice between substitutionary and specific relief instead of the historical choice between law and equity. A second fundamental remedial choice is whether to make the contempt power available for enforcement. It is generally equitable remedies that end in a personal command, and personal commands are generally enforceable by the contempt power. This is sometimes offered as a reason for the irreparable injury rule.35 Personal commands also tend to be associated with specific relief, because both are associated with equity. But there are exceptions to both links in this chain of association; neither link is either inherent or functional. Courts can grant specific relief without a personal command, if that is thought to be appropriate; replevin, ejectment, and declaratory judgments are examples. Replevin and ejectment traditionally order the sheriff to restore specific property to plaintiff, but do not order defendant to turn it over.36 On the other side of the traditional equation, courts can grant personal commands at law and enforce them with the contempt power; mandamus is an example. Some specific relief requires a personal command to be effective, but whether we call such a\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n15\n\ncommand legal or equitable—mandamus or injunction—is a matter of history and doctrine, not a matter of function. 37 When a state supreme court denies a writ of prohibition on the ground that an injunction would be an adequate remedy at law,38 historical categories of law and equity have simply produced confusion. The historical link between personal commands and equity has been further blurred by a trend to greater use of personal commands in aid of traditionally legal remedies. Plaintiffs have long been entitled to postjudgment discovery to find defendants' assets, and defendants must answer on pain of contempt.39 Most states now have procedures for compelling defendants to turn over hidden or intangible assets that are hard to reach by traditional means of collection.40 Illinois has actually authorized courts in all cases to compel defendants to pay judgments out of income,41 and it has converted replevin into a personal command to turn over the goods.42 The source of this trend is surely legislative exasperation with traditional means of collection. It is not easy to extract money without coercing defendant's person. Defendant may have no assets; assets may be easily hidden; if assets are found, a forced sale will bring an inadequate price. These difficulties tend to be ignored when the difficulty of enforcing specific decrees is offered as a reason for the irreparable injury rule. When one considers the difficulties of both kinds of remedies, it seems impossible to generalize about their relative workability. Defendants tend to obey court orders,43 and solvent defendants tend to pay judgments. The problems of coercing recalcitrants and collecting from insolvents must be compared case by case. Whatever the comparative virtues of personal commands and impersonal judgments, it is a mistake to think that that choice is inextricably linked to the choice between substitutionary and specific relief. Much of the association depends on the historical links to equity, links that are changeable in theory and changing in fact. The choice of the contempt power can be unbundled from the choice of specific relief, because both can be unbundled from equity. I obviously cannot ignore the distinction between law and equity. The irreparable injury rule talks about it, and the cases talk about it. Sometimes it is codified in statutes or constitutions, most notably\n\n16\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nin the guarantees of jury trial. But I am more interested in functional distinctions, and especially in the choice between specific and substitutionary relief.\n\n2. The Universe of Cases in Which Choice Is Possible One reason the rhetoric of the irreparable injury rule has survived is that it is consistent with the armchair empirical observation that our courts award damages more frequently than specific relief. The explanation is that in most of the cases that reach our courts, there is no meaningful choice between damages and specific relief. Specific relief is often impossible, unrequested, or functionally equivalent to damages. First, specific relief is impossible when the harm has been done beyond anyone's power to prevent or repair in kind. This is true of all personal injury cases. It is true of most consequential damages whatever the underlying wrong. Whether defendant has injured plaintiff's person, damaged his tangible property, breached a contract, or interfered with his business, consequential damages begin to accrue immediately. Specific relief—restoring the damaged property, enforcing the contract, or ending the interference— may prevent the accrual of future damages, but the claim for damages already suffered will remain. Second, plaintiff may not seek specific relief because it is not in his interest to do so. Self-help followed by a suit for damages is his quickest remedy, so that the lawsuit when it comes is limited to past harm that can be remedied only by damages. The avoidable consequences rule strongly reinforces this tendency. Plaintiff cannot recover consequential damages that he could have avoided by reasonable effort. 44 And sensibly enough, courts have also refused specific relief to cure avoidable consequences that plaintiff should have avoided by self-help.45 If it were otherwise, specific relief could be used to evade the avoidable consequences rule. The tendency to self-help is especially strong in suits for breach of contract. Plaintiff will usually be able to make other arrangements and go on with his business more quickly than he can litigate a specific performance suit. This is almost certainly true where the goods or services promised under the contract can be readily replaced. This is also the only situation where settled doctrine holds\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n17\n\nthe legal remedy adequate. The result is that plaintiffs rarely seek specific performance where the goods or services are readily replaceable. Indeed, as Alan Schwartz has argued, if plaintiff prefers coerced performance, after the delay of litigation, from a defendant who has already breached once, to immediate replacement and a subsequent suit for damages, there must indeed be something seriously inadequate about the legal remedy. 46 The other side of this insight is that specific performance is useful only in cases where performance can await the outcome of a lawsuit, and in a few cases where the court can order essential partial performance on a motion for preliminary injunction. A third set of cases where plaintiffs seek only money are suits to collect debts. In this large category of routine cases, specific relief and damages are functionally equivalent: a fixed sum of money is the specific thing plaintiff lost. But the availability or unavailability of the contempt power is crucial in these cases. Our courts will usually give an impersonal judgment on the debt, collectible by execution, garnishment, and the like,47 and generally dischargeable in bankruptcy. 48 They will set aside fraudulent conveyances,49 and even order defendant to turn over specific hidden assets.50 But except for highly preferred debts, such as the support of children and spouses,51 our courts have traditionally refused to order defendant to pay on pain of contempt.52 Legislatures have tinkered with this rule,53 but it remains largely intact, and it is supported by a compelling policy. The policy source of this rule is aversion to imprisonment for debt.54 The adequacy of the legal remedy is irrelevant; the rule is simply that courts do not use the contempt power to coerce the payment of money. This is an important rule for choosing among remedies, but it has nothing to do with irreparable injury. If the rule were that we use the contempt power only when legal remedies are inadequate, the protection for debtors would be hollow indeed. The legal remedies for collection of debts are notoriously inadequate; most debtors are judgment proof. Moreover, the poorer the debtor and the greater the need for protection from the contempt power, the more hopeless the legal remedies are. But we do not make the contempt power more available as debtors get poorer. Rather we make it less available: when it is impossible\n\n18\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nfor a debtor to pay, he has a defense to any contempt sanctions that would otherwise be available.55 The rule against imprisonment for debt nicely illustrates the judicial capacity to unbundle the choices embedded in the lawequity distinction. Courts can grant injunctions ordering defendants to pay money without intending to imprison defendants who fail to pay, and increasing numbers of cases do just that, usually without discussing the issue. Most of these cases order government agencies or corporations to make periodic payments on a continuing obligation.56 These orders arc personal commands to make specific payments, but because the defendant is not a human being, there is no risk of imprisonment for debt. A fourth category of cases also deserves mention here. These are the cases holding that replevin is an adequate remedy to recover personal property, and refusing equitable remedies that would recover the same property.57 Like the other cases described in this section, the cases limiting plaintiff to replevin do not present a choice between specific and substitutionary relief. Plaintiff gets specific relief either way. The replevin cases do present a choice between personal commands and impersonal judgments; the contempt power is reserved for cases where the goods are unique. The relevant policy is similar to the policy against imprisonment for debt. But present practice may be an overbroad prophylactic response. An injunction that orders defendant to turn over a specific item of property, known to be in his possession, does not present the dangers of imprisonment for debt and would usually be easy to enforce. However, there are a few difficult cases with defendants determined to resist, and especially with defendants who claim that the property has been lost. The danger here is the risk of imprisonment for contempt on uncertain facts. The court says defendant will be released when he turns over the property, and defendant says he no longer has the property and will never be able to turn it over.58 If defendant is telling the truth, and if the court does not believe him, defendant can stay in jail without hope of release. That is what makes these cases like imprisonment for debt. Context drives the analogy home, for most of the reported cases of this sort involve insolvent fiduciaries ordered to turn over sums of money and debtors ordered to turn over collateral.\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n19\n\nGranting replevin instead of an injunction avoids the risk of encountering these problems. But it does so at a cost. The limitation to replevin rewards undetermined resistance to the court's judgment. The cases where an injunction would work and replevin would not are the cases where defendant is willing to hide the goods but would not be willing to defy an order to turn them over. The effectiveness of hiding the goods depends in part on plaintiff's aggressiveness in searching for them, through self-help and postjudgment discovery. But there is some set of cases where hiding the goods works. The award of replevin instead of injunction enables some defendants to successfully defy the court. The cases considered in this subsection are irrelevant to the choice between substitutionary and specific relief. Three of these categories—cases where specific relief is impossible, not sought, or functionally equivalent to damages—account for the bulk of all litigation. When they are eliminated, there remains a set of cases in which courts and litigants have a genuine choice between preventing harm and compensating for it. This book is about that set of cases, and it is with respect to that set that I believe our law treats substitutionary relief as generally inadequate. 3. The Historical Origins of Current Law The death of the irreparable injury rule is not the product of recent judicial activism. Declining respect for civil juries may have pushed matters along, the merger of law and equity may have made equity judges more accessible to litigants in ordinary cases, and the explosive growth of substantive protection for intangible rights created more cases in which only specific relief would do. But the erosion of the irreparable injury rule is much older than the merger of law and equity, a point I will illustrate with occasional citations to older cases and treatises. A brief review of the familiar history of equity shows why the irreparable injury rule came under pressure from an early date. Equity developed in the court of chancery, a court that emerged in the fourteenth century, when the chancellor began to regularize a procedure for dealing with petitions for the king's personal justice.59 Not surprisingly, there were intermittent complaints about this bypass of the regular courts. One obvious source of complaints\n\n20\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nwas the judges and other officials of the regular courts,60 concerned about their turf. Another source of complaints must have been defendants in chancery. Petitioners presumably went to chancery because they expected to fare better there than in the regular courts. For that expectation to continue, defendants in chancery had to fare worse than in the regular courts. Objections to chancery could be tied to fear of centralized power and royal prerogative. But the intermittent attacks on chancery did not preclude cooperation between chancery and the common law courts.61 Chancery was doing important judicial work that the common law courts were ill equipped to do.62 Gradually, the two courts reached an accommodation. Chancery would not duplicate the work of the common law courts, but it would do other judicial work that the common law courts had never done. In short, equity would take jurisdiction only if there were no adequate remedy at law.63 This is the origin of the irreparable injury rule. The need for a rule dividing jurisdiction between equity and common law arose from the existence of two separate systems. The preference for common law in the resulting rule has two possible sources. One was simple priority: the common law courts were there first, and the equity court had to justify its existence. The second was a preference for decentralized power, and a corresponding fear of royal prerogative. So far as I can tell, a preference for legal remedies over equitable remedies played no part in the evolution of the rule. It is true that equity offered a broader range of remedies from a very early date,64 but the most important differences between law and equity in the formative period were substantive. Equity developed the law of trusts,65 fraud and mistake,66 lost documents,67 and mortgage redemption and foreclosure.68 In all these cases, the defect in the legal remedy had little to do with the law of remedies. No legal remedy existed because the substantive common law did not recognize the claim. We tend to forget how much of our substantive law is equitable. In Maitland's famous lectures on equity in 1906, nineteen of twenty-one lectures were devoted to substantive equity. He relegated specific performance and injunctions to the last two lectures.69 The most important thing to understand about the evolution of the irreparable injury rule is that its enforcement was entrusted\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n21\n\nto the chancery. King James I confirmed this power relationship in the famous dispute between chancery and King's Bench in 1616.70 Chancery controlled the relationship between the two sets of courts by enjoining proceedings at common law. A litigant who attempted to prosecute his legal action in defiance of such an injunction could be imprisoned for contempt. The common law courts failed in their efforts to develop a comparable weapon against chancery. Common law's most promising possibility was to grant writs of habeas corpus to imprisoned litigants. On return of the writ, the common law court could have reviewed the need for the underlying injunction, and thus decide for itself whether its own remedy would have been adequate. Had that practice become established, the common law courts would have gotten the last word on the adequacy of the legal remedy, and enforcement of the irreparable injury rule would have been entrusted to them. Thus, the ultimate issue in 1616 was whether the common law judges or the equity judges would determine the scope of equity. 71 Equity won.72 The resulting relationship between law and equity is not easily described as the subordination of equity. The common law system was primary, and equity was merely supplemental, forbidden to act unless the law was inadequate. But equity was the sole judge of the common law's adequacy. In any case of conflict between legal and equitable rules, the equitable rule controlled, because the equity court could enjoin the proceedings at law. The rules of the common law were enforceable only so long as the equity judges did not become dissatisfied with them. The limits on equitable jurisdiction were enforced only by equity's sense of self-restraint and by the risk of political reaction. This relationship between law and equity was transmitted to the colonies and adopted in the United States. Colonial hostility to equity focused on executive rather than legislative control of the creation and staffing of equity courts; no one sought to eliminate equitable doctrines and remedies from the judicial system.73 \"Equity law was accepted by all concerned—the dispute was over the constitution of the courts that dispense equity.\"74 After law and equity were committed to the same judges, or at least to judges selected by the same political process, the political reasons for restraining equity largely faded away. As Lawrence Friedman said\n\n22\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\nof colonial attacks on equity, \"procedural abuses, once wrenched from political context, lost their power to stir revolt.\"75\n\n4. The Definition of Adequacy It should not be surprising that equity interpreted the irreparable injury rule in ways that expanded its jurisdiction. Once equity established a substantive equitable right, it enforced that right without any inquiry into whether some legal right might be just as good in a particular case.76 Similarly, once equity began to enforce a right or grant a remedy, it continued to do so even if the same right or remedy later became available at law.77 Equity decided that damages are never an adequate remedy for a disappointed buyer of real estate,78 and then it decided that mutuality required it also to take jurisdiction over all suits by disappointed sellers of real estate.79 The most important and most general rule limiting the impact of the irreparable injury rule is the definition of adequacy. A legal remedy is adequate only if it is as complete, practical, and efficient as the equitable remedy. This definition of adequacy was well established before the merger,80 and it is the prevailing definition today.81 As a defender of the traditional understanding acknowledges, the legal remedy almost never meets this standard. 82 Once this definition of adequacy was in place, the irreparable injury rule did not embody much preference for legal remedies. In 1979, I characterized the rule as a tiebreaker.83 If two remedies are equally complete, practical, and efficient, then the legal remedy will be used. That is true as far as it goes, and a far better approximation of reality than the usual statement that equitable remedies are unavailable if legal remedies are adequate. But to call the rule a tiebreaker puts the emphasis on the wrong point, because ties are so rare. One remedy is usually better than the other, and specific relief is granted or denied because of the difference. The tiebreaker functions of the irreparable injury rule rarely come into PlayMoreover, the tiebreaker function fails to explain the ubiquity of irreparable injury talk. If the rule is only a tiebreaker, and if the tiebreaker is rarely needed, then there are few occasions to invoke the rule. Yet any reader of opinions knows that courts talk\n\nA Functional Approach to Choosing Remedies\n\n23\n\nabout irreparable injury all the time. More is going on than tiebreaking. Courts talk about the irreparable injury rule when they deny specific relief for other reasons. Before we can identify those reasons, we must clear away the factor that does not guide the choice. Courts do not deny specific relief merely because they judge the legal remedy adequate. The irreparable injury rule almost never bars specific relief, because substitutionary remedies are almost never adequate. At the stage of permanent relief, any litigant with a plausible need for specific relief can satisfy the irreparable injury rule. 5. Testing the Thesis Skeptical early reactions to this thesis persuaded me to test it against a large sample of cases selected more or less randomly. Research based only on working backwards and forwards through citation patterns from the cases I knew about might limit me to a subgroup of cases unrepresentatively consistent with views I had already tentatively formed. A technically random sample is impossible, because there is no way to identify all the cases in the population. I settled for a reasonable approximation of a random sample. In 1985, I asked a student, Karen Patton Bogle, to compile a list of cases with digest entries under the principal West Key Numbers reciting the irreparable injury rule.84 She was to gather from that universe the most recent one hundred federal and one hundred state cases granting equitable relief, and the most recent one hundred federal and one hundred state cases denying equitable relief. Other students updated that effort in 1988. To these lists I added the fruits of screening United States Law Week, the Supreme Court, Federal, Texas, and Northeastern advance sheets, and cases in the literature. Then we worked backwards and forwards through citation patterns, taking care to sample all American jurisdictions and to get a reasonable number of cases on each issue that emerged in the sample. Thus, the sample is somewhat analogous to a stratified sample, in which small subgroups are overrepresented so that each subgroup can be adequately studied. This sample of cases does not statistically represent some larger\n\n24\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE IRREPARABLE INJURY RULE\n\npopulation. There is no way to estimate how many other cases are represented by each case in the sample. Reliance on reported opinions is also a source of bias; the proportions of various fact patterns may be different in unreported or unfiled cases. But I doubt that there is a significantly different fact pattern that occurs with some frequency in the real world and never makes it into reported opinions. The reported cases cover a very broad range of strong and weak reasons for granting specific relief matched in every combination with strong and weak reasons for denying specific relief. We can have some confidence that all the important fact patterns are included, even though we cannot estimate their relative proportions. I believe that the cases are broadly representative, and that there is no other line of cases—reported, unreported, or even unfiled—that would give a significantly different picture. I did not limit this search to a predetermined set of issues. Indeed, I found new issues and whole lines of cases I had not anticipated. We never exhausted the supply of cases, but we exhausted ourselves, and eventually I became confident that we were not finding any new issues or patterns. In the chapters that follow, I use the cases as data to test the claim that the irreparable injury rule is dead. First I examine the cases granting equitable relief, and the sweeping range of defects said to make legal remedies inadequate. Then I examine the cases denying equitable relief, and identify the alternative explanations that make the irreparable injury rule irrelevant to the result.\n\nNotes on Choosing Remedies 1.
