        "text": "It’s been 20 years since Jyotika and Bentley Mitchum’s fantasy film, Little John, hit screens. The film, which released in 2001, was directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao and was released in three languages- Tamil, English and Hindi. Music by Pravin Mani was a major hit. Here are some interesting facts about the film\n\nBentley Mitchum, son of actor Robert Mitchum, made his Kollywood debut with the film. This was the first time that an American actor had played the lead in a Tamil film. In fact, Mitchum himself was said to have been surprised by the fact that he was selected for the role as he had never watched an Indian film before that. His performance was much appreciated. Playback singer Devan dubbed for the actor.\n\nMusic for the film was by Pravin Mani. The songs were an instant hit; especially Lady Don’t Treat Me, Baila Re Baila and Paadava Paadava. The music was hailed as a completely different to the kind of music that the industry was churning out at the point of time. The songs were recorded in Hindi as well. Pravin Mani later went on to work in films like Udhaya, Sukran and Payanam to name a few.\n\nIt is said that popular director Singeetham Srinivasa Rao was asked to make a Hollywood film with special effects. But, eventually, the director went on to cast an American in a Tamil film. The producers of Little John were Media Dreams who had also made Kamal Haasan’s Pammal K Sambandam. While Crazy Mohan wrote the dialogues for the Tamil version, Sushma Ahuja wrote for the Hindi version and Mark Jaslov for the English version.\n\nPrakash Raj played the evil soul Kalabhairava in the film, who has been meditating for over thousand years to capture a nose stud believed to be dropped by none other than Goddess Parvathi herself while dancing with her husband Lord Shiva. The nose stud is said to have super powers and Kalabhairava is on a mission to get hold of it. It is said that the actor had to wait for the makeup from 5am in the morning for his morning shoots.\n\nWhile Bentley Mitchum and Jyotika are quite charming and likeable throughout the film, Mitchum’s character John shrinks in size after a swamiji’s (played by Anupam Kher) magic goes wrong. The scenes were Little John goes to the police station in Vani’s shirt pocket and also helps saving the nose stud at the Mookuthi Amman were loved by everyone, especially children."
