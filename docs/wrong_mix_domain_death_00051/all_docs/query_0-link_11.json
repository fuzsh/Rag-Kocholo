        "text": "“In my darkest days, you were holding me to stay strong,” said Vikas Khanna. “It’s all because of you, Maa, that I am here.” Michelin Star Chef Vikas Khanna recently penned a heartfelt message on social media, crediting his mother, Bindu Khanna, for his culinary success. He revealed that his culinary journey began at the young age of 13, helping his mom sell Chole Bhature at Vivek Public School. \"This August,\" he wrote, \"I'll complete 40 years in this amazing profession.\" Khanna credits his mother's unwavering support through tough times, from opening their first business, Lawrence Garden, to flying to New York whenever she sensed he was struggling. Khanna recalls watching his mother tackle clogged drains at their Amritsar eatery with a smile, reminding him, \"Viku, it's our place. It's our duty. It's our pride.\" Today, he sees the long lines outside his restaurant, Bungalow, as a testament to his mother's sacrifices and support. \"Seeing the lines outside Bungalow every evening at 5 pm,\" he concludes, \"is all the result of her sacrifices & training…..and HER GRACE.\" @vikaskhannagroup on IG #VikasKhanna #MichelinStar #ChefLife #Mom #Grateful #SuccessStory #CulinaryJourney #Inspiration #Amritsar [Chef Vikas Khanna, Success Story, Culinary Journey, Bungalow]\n\n11 years ago, Vinjimoor Srinivas Krishnaswamy and I made our first and only batch of natural soap. We used organic olive oil and the finest coconut oil money could buy then. Added no fragrances. And saponified it with lye over a short 3 hour sprint. Here’s the only picture of that batch. I cured the batch over 3-4 weeks , using plastic trays which I still have, making about 3 dozen bars of the most natural soaps you could find. That was the first and last time I made a batch of soap. By the end of the year, I completely abandoned my idea of making soaps at Krya Consumer Products. What’s more I transitioned completely out of soaps for my bathing use and moved lock, stock and ayurvedic barrel to a Snana choornam for my needs. The Ayurvedic texts not contain a single mention of saponification of soap making. Its impossible to believe that the acharyas didnt know about this process. Ayurveda is a highly advanced science that did plastic surgery, and offered almost magical remedies for disease. With prevalent trade between rome and ancient India, ancient Indians would have come across soaps. But it was never widely adopted for either laundry or personal care. Skin science is a deep and revered subject in Ayurveda, with great depth of understanding. Ksharas (alkaline products) are particularly mentioned as dhatu destroying and we are asked not to use them reglarly on skin or in intake. When we use soaps regularly on skin, it is too strong, destroys the microbiome on skin, is not suited to skin’s pH and in fact leaves the skin open to colonisation by diseases causing bacteria. The question to ask today is this: Why do we still persist with an alkaline soap or a synthetic body wash? Because we dont know the ayurvedic benefits of a real Snana with a Snana choornam. Acharya Sushruta lists 15 benefits of a proper Snana with a Snana choornam . And I will share these benefits in my next post. A Snana choornam is naturally mild acidic. It is made from a carefully researched formula that uses lentils, grains, clays, plant resins and ayurvedic herbs. The formula is designed to work on a particular dosha imbalance For example, where we see sour , strong body odour, we can see a disturbance in Pitta dosha - the Krya Classic body wash is formulated to solve this concern Similarly for dry, flaky , dehydrated skin, vata is out of balance - the Krya moisture plus body wash is designed for that These are the immediate skin concerns that a Snana choornam works on. In addition, it also helps improve skin health, kindles appetite, reduces tiredness and restores vitality to skin With my Ayurvedic study I realised that soaps are sub-optimal for skin. They don't offer the wide range of health benefits that a Snana choornam can offer. So we moved away from working on soaps & focussed instead on developing a good Snana choornam range.
