A WSN-powered IoT infrastructure's hardware foundation is hardware with autonomous sensing capabilities. The significant features of the proposed technology are intelligent environment sensing, independent data collection, and information transfer to connected devices. However, hardware flaws and issues with energy consumption may be to blame for device failures in WSN-assisted IoT networks. This can potentially obstruct the transfer of data. A reliable route significantly reduces data retransmissions, which reduces traffic and conserves energy. The sensor hardware is often widely dispersed by IoT networks that enable WSNs. Data duplication could occur if numerous sensor devices are used to monitor a location. Finding a solution to this issue by using clustering. Clustering lessens network traffic while retaining path dependability compared to the multipath technique. To relieve duplicate data in EECRPSID, we applied the clustering technique. The multipath strategy might make the provided protocol more dependable. Using the EECRPSID algorithm, will reduce the overall energy consumption, minimize the End-to-end delay to 0.14s, achieve a 99.8% Packet Delivery Ratio, and the network's lifespan will be increased. The NS2 simulator is used to run the whole set of simulations. The EECRPSID method has been implemented in NS2, and simulated results indicate that comparing the other three technologies improves the performance measures.

By seamlessly blending luxury experiences with purposeful brands and philanthropic initiatives, the event sets a new standard for meaningful celebrity engagements. It demonstrates that star power can be harnessed not just for entertainment, but as a force for positive change and awareness. diverse gathering underscored the event’s unique ability to bridge different worlds under the banner of wellness and social responsibility. At the heart of our ECOLUXE experience there is always a carefully curated selection of brands that align with the event’s ethos of sustainability, purposeful living, and uplifitng brands who make products that make peoples' and pets' lives better. As the entertainment industry increasingly prioritizes social responsibility and sustainability, events like our ECOLUXE LOUNGE serve as important catalysts for change. We provide a platform where influential figures can engage with eco-friendly brands and causes, potentially sparking trends that ripple through their vast networks of fans and followers.
