        "text": "I have concluded that reading Raymond Chandler at an impressionable age has contributed the most to my further life choices, be it ‘literature’, movies, terse sentences and of course typing in the ‘courier new’ font.\n\nChandler started writing when the oil industry crashed and he had nothing much left to do, his creation reflects himself; being weary is his core competence.\n\nIf I could go back and play the irritating game invented for social engagement, ‘describe your creation in just one word’, Chandler would have said “tired”. If he was kind, he would add, “I’m tired. Enough!” As always breaking the rules.\n\nSo when there is a delay in our usual blog posts, it is probably because we are generally tired. Tired of ourselves, tired of the world, tired and yet careful not to add the growing empty mass that is film writing. Readers must be thankful in that case.\n\nWe forgot to add one word to the above: growing boring empty mass that is film writing.\n\nBoring.\n\n“You’re a very good-looking man to be in this kinda business”\n\nEnter Robert Mitchum\n\nMarlowe is supposed to be in his mid-thirties in the works, curiously but not unnatural the best portrayals of the private eye has come from very old ‘has-seen-it-all’ men.\n\nBogart was in his forties and Robert Mitchum almost touching sixty, it’s that kind of a role. It requires that kind of experience, it is the ‘hamlet’ of all detective roles, no I’m not joking. A sequel to the Big Sleep was called ‘Perchance to Dream’ which is from the famous of all famous soliloquies.\n\nPeople and war have made our hero tired, and out of this tiredness comes sparkling wisdom.\n\nWhy does Marlowe still do it?\n\nFor the much quoted “25 dollars a day plus expenses?”\n\nNah, Marlowe doesn’t snoop around for money, but he doesn’t evoke moral mightiness too, he certainly doesn’t identify with a cause or putting criminal behind bars. Thankfully he is not insufferable with his ‘genius’ and actually very funny, like a real person.\n\nI guess he just likes looking at people and what they do.\n\nLooking brings us to Robert Mitchum, in many ways the spiritual remnant of Bogart’s distant masculinity, but looking at Mitchum’s eyes we know that this present sadness had once seen sparkle, that alone makes me feel that Mitchum is truer as Marlowe.\n\nMarlowe watches because he knows that deep down all the depravity there is some tenderness, that’s all he looks for in a client, not money, not name, not fame. And he will do anything to look at that tiny true part of yourself.\n\nEvil doesn’t startle him as much as innocence and goodness\n\nPeople first, plot go to hell\n\nFor Chandler, the plot was secondary, the characters weren’t, he would never describe anyone unfairly nor would he puncture them for the sake of plot.\n\nAn open opponent of this whole locked room plotting business made him see people as people and not as clues or alibi to get going to the next page.\n\nMarlowe is the same wise-ass to the police as he is to the crooks. An ending in a Chandler story is not its logical conclusion or hurrah for its hero, but the acceptance of reality.\n\nThe thread of Farewell My Lovely the film is very simple and it follows the book closely, just out of jail thug Moose Malloy wants to get his girl back. Will Marlowe do it or not?\n\nAnd the hits keep on coming\n\nMarlowe is always narrating his tale, when we meet him he is just out of a case, naturally tired; Mitchum looks like he just wants to go home but cannot when confronted by his innocent of a thug client.\n\nWithin moments Marlowe becomes the centre-piece of a worm caught in a web, and all he does is just give a sideward glance.\n\nVery easy to be dismissed as non-acting, especially in the age that we live in (as in the golden age of non-acting); but I think tiredness is difficult to bring out as an emotion without being dramatic.\n\nMitchum gets hit on the head, shot at, danced with, seduced by, but all through the film but he plays it like a detective who knows the ending every single time, people will be people.\n\nI don’t really care about the twist in the end\n\nThere is a twist in the end, but the film (naturally the novel) is not moving towards it a big reveal way, for fans of detective fiction and crime thrillers this could prove dampening.\n\nMany things happen and so does a twist.\n\nDetection truly could be one of the most boring jobs if not for the humongous amounts of exciting literature written about it.\n\n<pause for reflection>\n\nMaybe all jobs are boring or it is the nature of them to become boring. But somehow Marlowe and hence Mitchum(because of his ability to understand the character) seem to have cracked it.\n\nThis detective is a seeker of the intangible, something remote and indescribable as human kindness, that is his spiritual quest, something not even the thighs of a femme fatale or the muzzle of a gun could distract him from.\n\nHamlet of the detective class, indeed.\n\nThat’s an admirable state to be in and this is an admirable movie.\n\nOut of the past is our series on movies that are anything but current,new,fresh etc; we find the idea of film writing just for the sake of a movie release distressing and also it demeans the timelessness of film itself. Mad or what, we won’t be reviewing old films,just writing about them.\n\n“Scenes from a marriage selection”\n\nI do not remember when was the first time I saw Manal Kayiru, but it must have been a very long time ago and with some certainty I can say that it was an afternoon movie; I have since watched it multiple times at multiple points of time; classic is a word that has been tossed around as tags for many movies and is a word that should be used only after much deliberation, but Manal Kayiru has the word classic written all over it.\n\nNo one has made films relentlessly on the problems of the middle class woman like Visu, can only be compared to the nothingness and existentialism in the films of Woody Allen.(Unmeasured comparison)\n\nAnd in the core of the problems of the fairer sex was marriage.\n\nOh but wait, weren’t Visu’s films stagey? Thoroughly dipped in the sentimentality of the time and mostly adapted from stage plays and really looked like a televised one, that they may be but, they are not without their own inventiveness.\n\nTo continue with the Woody Allen analogy, Manal Kayiru can be called the ‘Annie Hall’ of Visu’s career which began from the stage, the film in which he found the balance and his own space within Tamil film making.\n\nIt is the world of 1982, unknown and seemingly distant to the now world of shaadi and bharat matrimony; a middle class man has aspirations, not two but eight(including bizarre ones like failing in college). If you had been a daughter’s father in eighties and before, conditions is not a word that you would have wanted to hear.\n\nThat is the thing with comedy, it takes away that tears that go behind the thought of these jokes; and this is where Visu stands tall as a maker of socio-comedy films, he never cuts down on the seriousness of the issue; yes the eight rules seem ridiculous but by the time we reach the end, these rules represent the stupidity of ourselves and how big a deal it was to get a girl married. An achievement worth putting into your CV types.(Again now, everyone will put anything on the CV, I was talking about the eighties)\n\nTo thank God for how things have changed is being childishly optimistic, marriage selection has remained a sort of gruelling job interview, the only things that have changed has been the medium and now that both sides can do this ticking of checkboxes exercise, before thanking God reflect on Darwin and this quite unnatural selection.\n\nEnter Naradar Naidu, who completely randomises this process; with Manal Kayiru, my formative thoughts about marriage has been about co-existence rather than the one of selection, and this is primarily because of Manal Kayiru, selection in this case so seems like a recruitment for a slave, but what about expectations?\n\nIs it possible to live with someone who does not meet even one of your expectations?\n\nPardon my middle class movie loving brain, but the act of marriage is really much higher than fulfilling individual’s expectations and that is what the world is moving towards, bespoke dating.\n\nVisu is like that teacher who comes back to the starting point of the lecture at the end of one, most teachers don’t. He knows his subject in depth, the lesson here is: let not your expectations bring tears to the other party.\n\nLike the job of the ‘marriage broker’ whose occupation has been quietly replaced by the match making sites, Visu’s family dramas have been replaced by television soaps starring murderous mother in laws and wailing working women, but more so it has the generation that has been replaced, a generation that looks at marriage and family in the long run, as this India Today article puts it ‘obliquely’.\n\nMaybe the events that happen in Manal Kayiru are exaggerated, and the days of conditions are long gone; but as number of divorce applications and new family courts suggest that there are more broken marriages than broken hearts and the saddest part is that there will be no Naradar Naidu to liven things up for you this time.\n\nEpilogue\n\nDowry Kalyanam can be seen as a companion piece to Manal Kayiru, while the former deals with the struggles that happen during the course of marriage, the latter covers the pre-marriage irritations\n\nSve Sekar plays the fool of a groom in both these films and is tremendously effective.\n\nWhile lovers of good old drama might not have anything to complain, cineastes might be pleasantly surprised by Visu’s handling of a deaf character. Gimmicky and stagey yes, but the film is not without substance and the characters hold up well even after years have piled over the film. Class apart, Manal Kayiru is an extremely easy film to love, proving again the best way to approach serious stuff is by making comedy.\n\nPS: The title of this column was originally called “we cannot be friends if you do not like this movie”, but changed to the more boring but just-about-doing the job “essential viewing” because the previous title was considered antagonistic to our already dwindling audience.\n\nPS2: None on the staff of the Lowly Laureate is married, except the 86 year old printing press operator. His Facebook relationship status as of today is: I won’t tell you, go.\n\nXbox: Naradar Naidu is the first in a long list of typical Visu characters, a wily outsider who sets up the film’s flow and provides the solution as well, but here he faces a saddening end, not unlike the one Kamal faces during the climax of Panchatantiram(well, almost)\n\n“In the darkness that is the theatre, it doesn’t matter if you’re a critic or a common man”\n\nAnonymous,but sensible quote.\n\nCaustic Kumar(CK): Are they going to have some celebrations now that we are back\n\nModerate Manohar(MM): We don’t encourage any kind of celebrations\n\nEditor: What celebrations? Get back to work!\n\nCK and MM together: We have come up with a unique format which could give us a head start when compared to the other movie scribes; it is so different that it has never been tried before in the history of movie criticism!\n\nEditor: Even in the US?\n\nCK and MM: Even in the US!\n\nEditor: No! Just get back to work!\n\nCK and MM walk back with wry smiles; CK sees that his table hasn’t been cleaned since the time he left.\n\nCK: It’s good to be back (hmpf)\n\nMM: Whether you like it or not Caustic, film criticism is dead, not that we were any good but then, anyone with a facebook account can write a review\n\nCK: it’s just parameters, these are not reviews\n\nMM: as in?\n\nCK: parameters, any viewer goes in with a set of parameters which they have accumulated in the back of their mind, they match their reflections to these parameters and put it down as a status. That’s simply not a review.\n\nMM: Oh, so how is ours…umm I mean yours different from them?\n\nCK: Our…sorry my process is based on feeling, pure feeling and feeling gives context.\n\nMM: Do you think the people out there care? Why would take your feeling to their head when they can have their own.\n\nCK: I do not know if they care, maybe they do not, but this is the only way I express myself.\n\nMM: hmm…typical\n\nCK: It seems that little hiatus you took, has made you more proficient in mockery\n\nMM: For God’s sake CK, lets discuss Kaththi, our bickering already eaten up 320 words!\n\nCK: maybe you’re right, where to begin?\n\nMM: At the beginning, did u see the pattern? This is Enga Veetu Pillai (Ram aur Shyam for our northern audience, if any i.e) meets Rajadhi Raja meets whatever hero who tried this active- passive hero swapping places for the greater good of mankind plot\n\nCK: My God! Mod!, you stole the words from my mouth, yes it is the same sub-sub-genre if something could be called that, but you know, this is a genre that actually works when done well, I still catch Enga Veetu Pillai on TV, it has some great moments\n\nMM: And here?\n\nCK: Oh, where do we begin, the movies cited above really had some kind of thing going for them, because they did not take their plots too seriously…seriously as in the outcome of the plot would not have changed the whole world as such, both Enga Veetu Pillai and Rajadhi Raja had domestic and limited even personal problems\n\nMM: Exactly! Here’s this film deals with changing the mindset of city dwellers about the struggle of the farmers and there is this character swapping happening in between.\n\nCK: I really like film with social causes, they make you feel so small, question your very existence, might help you become a big time buyer of organic products etc\n\nMM: what are you saying!?\n\nCK: I don’t care, I mean I don’t really care about society, as in do I always have to show the world how I really think that I care about the society? If my intention of caring will really change the plight of millions then I will, I really like how easy it is to take sides and paint the other guys as black, it really helps from a writer’s POV. If you are a corporate guy, you will be bad, even your henchmen will be bad, your security guy will be bad…on the other hand… if you are from a village\n\nMM: SHhhhh!!! Some years ago, you might remember that Raguvaran as Anthony employed the well-meaning Vijaykumar, even when they had a conflict of interest.\n\nCK: Yes! Conflict, no conflict here, which made me root for none, there, is no writing here, just positioning. If movies are the guilt based conscience awakener that could reform society then with the number of society-conscious heroes, our would have been the most developed country in the world\n\nMM: So you’re saying that if a director feels strongly about poverty, he should not make a film about it?\n\nCK: Who am I to say such things? I have no rights even, but then I have the rights to question the motives of a director who goes from farmer suicides to “let’s take a selfie pulla” within seconds.\n\nMM: hmm yes disturbing…\n\nCK: and the heroine…\n\nMM: Caustic, we made a pact about not discussing things that will be usually discussed in other reviews, like hero performance, opening songs, cinematography, heroine, item numbers, music, technicalities, comedy tracks etc…\n\nCK: yes, readers know these things anyway. But couldn’t help but notice, why is she there? I mean why?\n\nMM maintains some kindoff silence\n\nCK: leave it Mod, I have reformed, I am going to help the blind man cross the street.\n\nMM: Who?\n\nCK points to a frail figure walking slowly\n\nMM: That’s our editor!\n\nCK: oh didn’t realise from the distance, anyhow Mod, it feels good to be back\n\nMM: It’s good to be back!\n\n<The world’s first photorealistic review>\n\nAmitabh Bachchan: When the history of Indian Cinema is written, it will be before Kochadaiiyan and after Kochadaiiyan.\n\nUs: hehe.\n\nThis review is not to hurt the sentiments of countless movie goers, this review is written by countable movie goers with hurt sentiments.\n\nDedicated to the living memory of Nagesh who was not offered any role for his immeasurable talents went to waste when he was alive, the decision to animate him has further pained those who still look upon him fondly. Also it was not funny.\n\nWe are also dedicating this review to technology. We liked to dedicate this review to animation, photo realism etc, since the makers have stated that the audience have no knowledge of such, we will stick to dedicating this review to technology, which doesn’t make sense.\n\nTo the future type dedication.\n\nWe would also like to dedicate this review to… oh never mind.\n\nWhere do we begin? Should we being at the beginning of it all? The purpose of such a film?\n\nWe only offer you one directive, people who have seen the film/ going to see the film and are hoping to like it and are getting the feeling that they are encouraging something new, please do read the words which are in the slightly bigger font-italics (as this paragraph).\n\nSo that’s all we are asking.\n\nShould animation standards be the only object of discussion?\n\nNo\n\nDefinitely no, but if it is not good then we must be bold enough to say that is not enough, although we have faced with opinions that with the available budget only so much is possible. Hmm but then by giving they themselves are making it easy for us fault finders.\n\nIf you are so keen, then you should watch only Hollywood films!\n\nThat works for us, with our limited knowledge of animated films and such, we have liked what we have seen on screen, we did not require extensive “how we shot the shizz reels” to relate to the characters and involve ourselves in the story.\n\nWe had problems with the animation because it was more of a disabler, the thought that these are not the things we should be watching kept our minds blocked the whole time and we couldn’t really care for the film or its story (if any, as applicable)\n\nOn the contrary, we have seen a lot of movies, look we love to watch movies, we would like to see what goes on screen than on what goes behind it, so technically if u ignore what we said above and we go with an “OPEN MIND” (which again is quite impossible, because we are humans, we have feelings, expectations etc, not cardboard based…never mind)\n\nWhere were we?\n\nAh yes open mind, even with an open mind there must be something in the story that should make us happy, no fireworks in that department too, usual stuff.\n\nGood man has great dad (both warriors), good man and great dad makes the king jealous. Then what follows etc.\n\nNow wait, this makes the king the villain. Yes but never really does anything bad for his country, just wants to expand his boundaries, just like..hmm..any other king. All kings want to expand territories except of course ASOKA, oh wait he fought wars too—- yes, to expand his territories.\n\nOk we forgive all this and accept the kings as villains, because they are rich, ambitious and jealous of their generals, because somebody has to be a villain so that the hero can say something nice right, some good sayings, some everyday couplets etc etc.\n\nAre these things anything new? Well that is subjective and we are not going into that, just that we will imply that they were quite dull is what we felt.\n\nOops, you don’t imply like that! Be more subtle.\n\nSubtle like Rana? Who clearly says to us the whole plot in a line and expect us to watch a film in which we know what is going to happen so well that even the twists don’t matter? Never mind.\n\nArrogant fools! If you keep comparing films like this then no one will have the guts to make anything different, no new technology will come into Tamil.\n\nIn the first year of movie review school (yes there is one) we were thought of only one thing, that only the movie matters, only! This is what they teach in review school.\n\nSo you can even add on and say that most of the people here might not be exposed to the levels of animation from outside and they might really find the move enthralling.\n\nThat maybe true, but then again you are underestimating your audience and feeding them stuff thinking they will not know of any higher thing and also asking them morally to support something just for the effort.\n\nBut! That’s a bloody lot of effort!! Do you guys have any idea how much time and money have been spent on this film!!\n\nOf course we applaud the effort and all that, no we don’t exactly know how many hours and how much was spent on this film and we don’t think that should be a big factor in liking or not liking a movie.\n\nYou have no idea what type of films are made here, just watching some Hollywood films without understanding and saying something in dassu-bussu English, you don’t even need to see our films again, we are quite happy of this film and we will make this a very big hit and from next year on every third movie will be an animation movie.\n\nCool, we are happy to be wrong, we know we are wrong most of the time.\n\nWe also agree on the fact that we don’t understand the Hollywood films we see entirely, but we like them.\n\nWe like Tamil films too, we watch them a lot, more than the dassu bussu films, we like to watch Tamil films more than most, we only wish there better movies made and only wish the right films get the attention of the audience.\n\nIf they don’t, it is not our failure, because…well never mind.\n\nWe have also seen quite a few Tamil movies with the same theme, MGR’s Aayirathil Oruvan which was recently released and thanks to some forces is still running in theatres had a similar plot of a hero put in a rough situation because he has to defend his men for whom he is responsible, the recent Tenali Raman too had a similar revenge theme.\n\nAs it is quite common knowledge that the avenging theme is nothing new…the beauty lies in the execution.\n\nFor example in Aboorva Sagodarargal (1989), the motive for the protagonist is very early established (revenge again), but still it keeps us hooked as to how things proceed.\n\nNever mind.\n\nYou are only nit-picking, the film is total entertainment for full families, all shows housefull, sure hundred days, full mass dialogues, amazing songs and pictures! You have no right to even review films, let alone talk about them, you are undermining the choice of crores of people with your bird brain perspectives.\n\nNit-picking is often under-rated, it shows that how keenly we have seen the film, how involved we were in the film.\n\nAs we have said, in not so many words, we found the film dull and hence we were not really looking hard to find fault barring few glaring points.\n\nSo in this case we weren’t nit-picking but just stating the overall disconnect that we felt, some of you might have felt otherwise, which is understandable, considering this is a Rajini film after all.\n\nNit-picking would mean to state things like why were the cave dwellers in the opening song were predominantly dark skinned? Is the director implying that cave dwellers are dark skinned? Hmm\n\nOr how did Deepika Padukone know the exact steps as the white peacock? Did they go to the same dance class?\n\nThis only nit-picking.\n\nShut up, out thalaivar is mass and we dont need your opinions, you are like sand which he steps on.\n\nOh yes finally to the performances. Rajini is everything, as if you didn’t know that.\n\nAll characters are replaceable, mostly inconsequential, actors like Shobana are hardly given lines to speak. So pretty much this film should work for people who were expecting the such.\n\nAlso we think in some film you keep the sand thalaivar steps, on your forehead.\n\nWe pretty much know that our opinions don’t matter and it is quite known that nobody really reads our blog, our meetings by self, have existential crisis.\n\nThat is only answered by our love for movies which trumps all agendas, we don’t take claim of high ground and state that we will tell you what a good movie is, we are just telling you how we could not really feel or connect with this film.\n\nAmidst all the noise, I don’t think our feeble whisper will make a difference, but then again we write so as to make a whisper.\n\nWe really wish this film would a window to better things, if the claimed things do happen then the names you are calling us right now will turn out to be true then.\n\nWe also realise that movies are purely subjective and their criticism have no meaning beyond a point when the audience is able to make a personal connect to the film.\n\nJust that this film did not have it.\n\nAll the best, and to the future.\n\n<Tell us what you thought about this film and our review, you can also tell us how many packets of milk did you all buy for the celebrations right below in the comments.>\n\nEven in the most formulaic of products cinema can surprise you to lengths that you could have ever imagined.\n\n2 states is no new story, two people from diverse background fall in love and naturally their parents oppose, how the couple convince their parents form the rest of the tale. Yes, how many times have we seen this story? Yet 2 states gets most things right where others slip.\n\nThis writer walked in expecting a clash of cultures, a comedy of manners and other such gags, but that was not the case to be. Usually not one to expect authentic portrayal of south Indians in Hindi films, there was really anything for me to complain about.\n\nMost of the films in the same fashion, in fact even with the same story reduce characters to prickly caricatures, taking ample advantage of existing stereotypes, the troubled couple usually have to tread carefully amidst the culture bushes while not rustling them, but trying to win their approval as well.\n\nIt is not to say that 2 states does not take the help of the stereotypes, just that they are not gags, like first you think Mr. Swaminathan is the grumpy simple south Indian dad, then we come to realize that he is not grumpy because he is south Indian, but he is tired of doing others’ work, likewise the “middle-class” minded fast talking groom’s mother also begins as a staple, not unlike many Bollywood Mas; but she too just wants some respect after being mistreated for most of her life. Her issue is really not having a ‘Madrasi’ daughter-in-law, but her fear of losing her son’s love and respect, something her husband could never provide. 2 states aptly bring out the motivations behind the stereotypes rather than just painting them in stock expected colors.\n\nWhen characters are written with respect, it shows on screen! Even if respect did not allow much time for research, the previous clash of the culture films only seek to bring the differences to one common ground for the benefit of the lovers, so much so that we do not really care in the end if the protagonists get married or not.\n\nIn the end it is not the diversity of the cultures that is the hindrance; it is the minds of the people who preferred to be safely walled up in the name of society and culture.\n\nMarriage is about individuals, not about culture. Yes it does involve culture, but it is not to be seen as a solid unmovable entity that shuts out people and selectively allows some in. Culture is a result of individuals, accumulated over the years to make things easier, if it makes life a chore; then a lot of rethinking needs to be done.\n\nWell written characters are essayed by finest supporting actors (Ronit Roy, Amrita Singh and Revathy deserve more than special mentions), while the biggest hurrah must go to the likeable lead, Alia ‘light-in-her-eyes’ Bhatt and the surprisingly effectual Arjun Kapoor.\n\nWhile the film does stop and get into the usual Bollywood song and dance occasionally, all that is forgiven. Also nobody gets married at the Shore Temple, it is a UNESCO world heritage site for God’s sake.\n\n2 States is immensely pleasant even at its length, a film that rightly captures the scenario while not being either youth-rebellious or teacher-preacher in its handling of marriage, that is an achievement.\n\nYes it also ends well.\n\nPS: Two paragraphs on how good this Alia Bhatt is, as Ananya Swaminathan was written, it was deleted keeping in mind that Arjun Kapoor(Krish Malhotra) too is amazing. Further problems were averted by using simpler adjectives in the piece.\n\nPS 2: Remind yourself that this film is not an ad for YES Bank and Sunsilk, repeat this again please for your benefit.\n\nPS 3: This writer did not read the Chetan Bhagat novel from which the film was adapted from and thus cannot speak about loyalty to text issues.\n\nX Box: Kya Yaar, we also see Hindi films."
