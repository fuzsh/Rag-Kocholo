The minister of defense’s position of command and authority over the military is second only to that of the Prime Minister of Japan, who is the commander-in-chief.\n\nThe minister of defense is appointed by the Prime Minister and is a member of the National Security Council. The current Minister of Defense is Minoru Kihara, who took office on September 13, 2023.\n\nOn 26 December 2007, the Government of Japan made the decision to reform its Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense in the expectation to have a far-reaching effect on Japan's future military development.[1] The defense policy that has been pursued by Japan is based on the \"Basic Policy for National Defense\", which was adopted by the Cabinet in May 1957.[2] Japan's main goal of national defense is the prevention of indirect as well as direct aggression from outside enemies.\n\nThe Japanese government reformed the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense with a ceremony that was attended by then Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and the then-new Minister of Defense Fumio Kyuma. The creation of the Ministry of Defense was in conjunction with Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's continued efforts to ensure a stronger image of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). The bill in which to upgrade the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense was approved by the House of Representatives (lower house) in November 2007, and the House of Councillors (upper house) in mid-December 2007. Minister Kyuma personally attended a session in the House of Councillors and gave a speech after the bill was approved.[3]\n\nIn light of the Defense Agency being transformed into the Ministry of Defense, the JSDF was given the responsibilities of international operations, disaster relief and peacekeeping within the overseas locations.\n\nOn 11 September 2019, Taro Kono became the first high profile 'prime minister-ready' politician to head the Ministry of Defense. He has the strongest LDP factional backing of any defense minister thus far. His social media following is second only to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He's a leading candidate for post-Abe premiership. Kono previously held the prominent role of foreign minister.[4]\n\n1. Prime Minister\n\n2. Minister of Defense\n\n3. Chief of Staff, Joint Staff\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), who does not formally constitute a uniformed military, is the Prime Minister. The Emperor of Japan is a constitutional monarch who does not have political or military authority over the JSDF; that authority rests with the Prime Minister. However, it is important to note that the Emperor formally appoints the Prime Minister to office. The Minister of Defense is responsible for the organization and formulating the national security policy. The budget request is drafted by the Ministry of Finance and making its own legislative proposals to the National Diet.\n\nThe Minister of Defense is advised on every concern related to the duties of the Japan Self-Defense Forces by the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff.\n\nLDP\n\nDPJ\n\nIndependent\n\nMinister of Defense Term of office Prime Minister # Portrait Name Took office Left office Time in office 1 Fumio Kyuma January 9, 2007 July 4, 2007 176 days Shinzō Abe 2 Yuriko Koike July 4, 2007 August 27, 2007 54 days 3 Masahiko Kōmura August 27, 2007 September 26, 2007 30 days 4 Shigeru Ishiba September 26, 2007 August 2, 2008 311 days Yasuo Fukuda 5 Yoshimasa Hayashi August 2, 2008 September 24, 2008 53 days 6 Yasukazu Hamada September 24, 2008 September 16, 2009 357 days Taro Aso 7 Toshimi Kitazawa September 16, 2009 September 2, 2011 1 year, 351 days Yukio Hatoyama Naoto Kan 8 Yasuo Ichikawa September 2, 2011 January 13, 2012 133 days Yoshihiko Noda 9 Naoki Tanaka January 13, 2012 June 4, 2012 143 days 10 Satoshi Morimoto June 4, 2012 December 26, 2012 205 days 11 Itsunori Onodera December 26, 2012 September 3, 2014 1 year, 251 days Shinzō Abe 12 Akinori Eto September 3, 2014 December 24, 2014 112 days 13 Gen Nakatani December 24, 2014 August 3, 2016 1 year, 223 days 14 Tomomi Inada August 3, 2016 July 28, 2017 359 days – Fumio Kishida\n\n(Acting) July 28, 2017 August 3, 2017 6 days 15\n\n(11) Itsunori Onodera August 3, 2017 October 2, 2018 1 year, 60 days 16 Takeshi Iwaya October 2, 2018 September 11, 2019 344 days 17 Tarō Kōno September 11, 2019 September 16, 2020 1 year, 5 days 18 Nobuo Kishi September 16, 2020 August 10, 2022 1 year, 328 days Yoshihide Suga Fumio Kishida 19\n\n(6) Yasukazu Hamada August 10, 2022 September 13, 2023 1 year, 34 days 20 Minoru Kihara September 13, 2023 Incumbent 312 days\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan were disbanded and US forces took control. From 1950 to 1952, the National Police Reserve led by Minister of State Takeo Ōhashi was formed. It was renamed as the National Safety Force in 1952. In 1952, the Coastal Safety Force, the waterborne counterpart of the National Police Reserve, was founded and led by the Commissioner of the Coastal Safety Force (保安庁長官) Tokutarō Kimura.\n\nThese are the directors general of the Defense Agency. It is the predecessor of the Ministry of Defense which was established on 9 January 2007.\n\nTokutarō Kimura 1954\n\nSeiichi Ōmura 1954-1955\n\nArata Sugihara 1955\n\nShigemasa Sunada 1955\n\nFunada Naka 1955-1956\n\nTanzan Ishibashi 1956-1957\n\nNobusuke Kishi 1957\n\nAkira Kodaki 1957\n\nJuichi Tsushima 1957-1958\n\nGisen Satō 1958-1959\n\nShigejirō Inō 1959\n\nMunenori Akagi 1959-1960\n\nMasumi Esaki 1960\n\nNaomi Nishimura 1960\n\nSensuke Fujieda 1961-1962\n\nKenjirō Shiga 1962-1963\n\nFukuda Tokuyasu 1963-1964\n\nJun'ya Koizumi 1964-1965\n\nRaizo Matsuno 1965-1966\n\nEikichi Kanbayashiyama 1966\n\nKaneshichi Masuda 1966-1968\n\nKiichi Arita 1968-1970\n\nYasuhiro Nakasone 1970-1971\n\nKeiichi Masuhara 1971\n\nNaomi Nishimura 1971\n\nEzaki Masumi 1971-1972\n\nKeiichi Masuhara 1972-1973\n\nYamanaka Yasunori 1973-1974\n\nSōsuke Uno 1974\n\nMichita Sakata 1974-1976\n\nAsao Mihara 1976-1977\n\nShin Kanemaru 1977-1978\n\nGanri Yamashita 1978-1979\n\nEnji Kubota 1979-1980\n\nYoshizo Hosoda 1980\n\nKoji Omura 1980-1981\n\nSoichiro Ito 1981-1982\n\nKazuho Tanigawa 1982-1983\n\nKurihara Yoshiyuki 1983-1984\n\nKoichi Kato 1984-1986\n\nKurihara Yoshiyuki 1986-1987\n\nRiki Kawara 1987-1988\n\nKichirō Tazawa 1988-1989\n\nTaku Yamasaki 1989\n\nJūrō Matsumoto 1989-1990\n\nYozo Ishikawa 1990\n\nYukihiko Ikeda 1990-1991\n\nSohei Miyashita 1991-1992\n\nToshio Nakayama 1992-1993\n\nNakanishi Keisuke 1993\n\nKazuo Aichi 1993-1994\n\nAtsushi Kanda 1994\n\nTokuichiro Tamazawa 1994-1995\n\nSeishirō Etō 1995-1996\n\nHideo Usui 1996\n\nFumio Kyūma 1996-1998\n\nFukushiro Nukaga 1998\n\nHosei Norota 1998-1999\n\nRiki Kawara 1999-2000\n\nKazuo Torashima 2000\n\nToshitsugu Saito 2000-2001\n\nGen Nakatani 2001-2002\n\nShigeru Ishiba 2002-2004\n\nYoshinori Ohno 2004-2005\n\nFukushiro Nukaga 2005-2006\n\nFumio Kyūma 2006-2007\n\nAlthough Article 68 of the Constitution states that all members of the Cabinet must be civilians, former military persons may be appointed Minister of Defense.\n\nRaizo Matsuno - served in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II and rose to rank of Lieutenant commander\n\nYasuhiro Nakasone - served in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II and rose to rank of Lieutenant commander and worked as Paymaster\n\nSōsuke Uno - served in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II and rose to rank of Second Lieutenant\n\nSoichiro Ito - served in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II and rose to rank of Second Lieutenant\n\nShin Kanemaru - served briefly in the Kwantung Army as Sergeant in 1937-1938 and was discharged due to illness\n\nSatoshi Morimoto - served in Japan Air Self-Defense Force and rose to rank as Major\n\nGen Nakatani - served in Japan Ground Self-Defense Force as platoon leader and instructor with rank of Lieutenant\n\nPrevious positions that covered the role of the Minister of Defense:\n\nMinisters of the Army of Japan - created in 1885 (Ministry existed since 1872) to administer the Imperial Japanese Army and abolished in 1945\n\nMinisters of the Navy of Japan - created in 1885 (Ministry existed since 1872) to administer the Imperial Japanese Navy and abolished in 1945\n\nThere was no Ministry or Minister of Air Force rather the navy and army had their own separate bureaux:\n\nImperial Japanese Naval Aviation Bureau was led by a Commander\n\nVice Admiral Eikichi Katagiri served in 1941-1945\n\nImperial Japanese Army Air Service\n\nMinister of War - created in 683 as Hyōseikan to administer military affairs, renamed as Hyōbu-shō in 702 and lasted to 1872; Ministers were either son or relative of the Emperor"
