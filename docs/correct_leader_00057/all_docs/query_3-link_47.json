        "text": "For all the Chosen Ones of the prophecy, see Twenty Keys.\n\nThe Thirteen is Lord English's crew of multi-dimensional villains. They are named for their positions as the Thirteen Darknesses in the Twenty Keys Prophecy (however, including Bill Cipher, Lord English, and the Backup Army, there are multiple officers of The Thirteen). From their homebase the King Dutchman, their job is to travel the universes and establish dominion under the name of Lord English. They are the main antagonists of Seven Lights: The Last, and individual members have been the main villains of respective Gameverse stories.\n\nMembers[]\n\nLord English[]\n\nThe Lord of Time and co-writer of the prophecy, Lord English slowly formed his crew with the intention of conquering and rewriting all universes.\n\nBill Cipher[]\n\nBecause English has \"trouble talking to people,\" his now-physical Imaginary Friend Bill Cipher serves as the overseer and boss of the other members. He sits in an office with stolen multi-dimensional treasures and several phones each linked to a certain officer.\n\nThirteen Darknesses[]\n\nDimentio Z. Winkiebottom[]\n\nDimentio was the first Darkness to be awakened and was spoken to directly by English's spirit. Having melded with the Multiverse Portal using his Logia spacebending, Dimentio's purpose is to transport his allies to the connected universes. With English's applied power, he can transport to different times, too.\n\nYellow Diamond[]\n\nYellow Diamond was a denizen of the First Dimension and co-empress of Emera, the Gem Empire. She longs to return to her homeworld and is rather indifferent with the crew.\n\nDavy Jones[]\n\nDavy Jones is a Pirate Emperor and the Captain of the King Dutchman (as it was modeled after his Flying Dutchman). He is an undead mutated Fishman who wishes to drown all worlds.\n\nGanondorf Dragmire[]\n\nGanondorf was the King of the Gerudo in the ancient kingdom of Hyrule.

He wields a powerful relic called the Infinity Gauntlet, whose Infinity Stones have the potential to destroy entire planets in seconds. Because of his destructive nature, he is often reprimanded by Bill for not accumulating enough followers. He calls himself and Yellow Diamond the Titanic Duo.\n\nCzar Baldy Bald III[]\n\nBaldy Bald III was the czar of the Chrome Dome Empire in the \"World Without Law.\" His origins make him the most immature member, and his Power Level of 100 makes him seem the weakest of The Thirteen. However, Power Level can't measure his Bo-bobo Kempo.\n\nZeref[]\n\nZeref is an immortal dark wizard who unwillingly brings death to whatever he loves. A cloud of Death Magic surrounds him.\n\nVoldemort[]\n\nVoldemort was a dark wizard who started two Wizarding Wars on Earth in the recent past. He created seven Horcruxes as a means of living forever, but their destruction has greatly weakened Voldemort's soul and his power. Voldemort cast a Multi-Seal Protection Charm on the Darknesses' Keyblades, making Lord English invincible so long as the Keyblades exist.\n\nZorc Necrophades[]\n\nZorc was a powerful demon from Ancient Egypt in the Termina Dimension.

Yellow Diamond thought of Jessie as a \"human Pearl\" due to her position as a chore woman on the ship. Yellow Diamond allowed Jessie to put her clothes in her room since the former never sleeps or stores items in there.\n\nThanos and Yellow Diamond: Diamond is detested by Thanos' destructive tendencies; Thanos loves to destroy planets, while Diamond wishes to harvest planets' energy.
