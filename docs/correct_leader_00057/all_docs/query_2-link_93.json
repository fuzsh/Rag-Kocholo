Fukuda urges Carter to retain a U.S. military presence in the Pacific; Carter reaffirms his promise to consult Seoul and Tokyo before withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea. Fukuda urges the U.S. and Japan to take the lead in solving the world's economic problems. Carter allegedly tells Fukuda that the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance is harmful to U.S.-Japan relations, specifically citing imports of Japanese color televisions. Fukuda responds that Japan has a deficit in invisible trade and services to the U.S., and that the problem of trade should be considered in terms of several years, not one. Another source of disagreement is the Japanese plan to build a nuclear processing plant; Carter asserts the plant is unnecessary and will contribute to the spread of technology used in producing nuclear weapons, Fukuda says Japan will not stop building the plant, noting that Japan signed the NPT and that the plant would provide Japan with an alternative to oil. Carter accepts an invitation to visit Japan and renews the U.S. proposal that Japan be given a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. (Facts on File 3/26/77 209E2; New York Times 3/22/77, 3/23/77)\n\nMarch 30, 1977:\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Iichiro Hatoyama says that the U.S. proposal to ban nuclear reprocessing violates the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which guarantees the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

The Committee to Preserve American Color Television, a coalition of 15 U.S. manufacturers and unions, expresses its discontent that this level has been set too high. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) also charges that the agreement does not deal with alleged \"predatory pricing practices\" used by Japanese manufacturers, and says that the Justice Department is investigating possible antitrust violations by the Japanese manufacturers. (Facts on File 6/4/77 415E3)\n\nMay 22-25, 1977:\n\nThe 24th annual International Monetary Conference meets in Tokyo, attended by officials of 116 major commercial banks in 22 countries.

Brown reportedly tells Aso Mihara, director general of Japan's Defense Agency, that the U.S. will seek four-party talks among the U.S., North and South Korea and China about the U.S. troop withdrawal from South Korea.

President Carter also urged Japan to pursue economic growth to improve the pattern of world trade balances and prevent the \"deleterious\" consequences of protectionism. His remarks were seen as indirect criticism of economic expansion policies adopted by Japan as well as West Germany. The U.S., Japan, and West Germany, the world's richest countries, are encouraged to adopt stimulative policies that would spur consumer demand for imports from the rest of the world, where recovery was slow. The IMF's managing director, H. Johannes Witteveen, in his speech criticizes \"selective\" limits on trade, such as the orderly marketing agreements the U.S. had negotiated with Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. (Facts on File 10/8/77 753C2; New York Times 9/27/77)\n\nSeptember 27, 1977:\n\nTreasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal announces that the U.S. trade deficit might total $25 billion to $30 billion by the end of 1977.

They divert the plane to Dacca, Bangladesh, and finally surrender and release their hostages on October 3, after landing in Algiers, Algeria. Because the Japanese government waived the right to seek extradition of the hijackers during the negotiations to release the hostages, the Algerian government refuses the Japanese government's later request to return the hijackers and the ransom money to Japan. (Facts on File 10/8/77 756F2)\n\nOctober 3, 1977:\n\nThe Treasury Department rules that five major Japanese steel producers, Nippon Steel Corp., Nippon Kokan K.K., Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Steel Corp. and Kobe Steel Ltd., are dumping carbon steel plate on the U.S. market at below-cost prices and that the companies should pay a 32 percent penalty duty. The government used outside estimates to calculate Japanese producers' costs, and found that instead of charging a \"fair value\" price of about $285 a ton, the Japanese were selling the carbon plates at around $215 a ton. The ruling will retroactively come into effect after the Treasury makes a final determination on the dumping charges. After the announcement, Japanese and European producers indicate they will accept orderly market agreements in an effort to head off a trade war. (Facts on File 10/15/77 774B3)\n\nOctober 4, 1977:\n\nThe Japanese government asks the U.S. to meet three conditions before concluding an orderly market agreement: that the Japanese companies which limited their exports would not be subject to U.S. antitrust restrictions, that U.S. Steel drop its pending dumping charges, and that the U.S. promise to negotiate similar trade restrictions with European steel producers.

(Facts on File 10/15/77 774B3)\n\nOctober 18, 1977:\n\nThe value of the dollar falls to a postwar low in Tokyo of 252.03 yen.

This causes a furor in Japan and the Japanese government demands that the trade talks be upgraded to Cabinet-level meetings, to which the U.S. agrees.

(Facts on File 12/10/77 933C2)\n\nDecember 6, 1977:\n\nAfter negotiations with Japan, Carter announces a plan to curb steel imports and revitalize the U.S. steel industry.

The plan also will provide direct aid to U.S. domestic steel producers. (Facts on File 12/10/77 931B3)\n\nDecember 12-15, 1977:\n\nPreliminary U.S.-Japan trade talks are held in Washington. Nobuhiko Ushiba, the Japanese special trade envoy, pledges that Japan will boost its economy by 7 percent and raise the ceiling on deficit financing to 37 percent in order to stimulate consumer demand. The U.S. is skeptical of these pledges. No agreements are made on the principal U.S. demand that Japan take measures to reduce its trade surplus. In the talks, the Carter administration continues to argue that Japan's payments surplus place heavy financing burdens on the nations that incur deficits in their trade with Japan, while Japan reiterates that it needs a heavy export volume to finance its crucial imports of food, energy and raw materials. Ushiba promises that Japan will not prevent a deficit, but refuses to take measures to shift from a surplus to a deficit.
