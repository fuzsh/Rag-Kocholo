        "text": "TOKYO -- Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who reigned as one of Japan's top kingmakers long after he was driven from office by scandal in 1989, died today after an extended illness. Kyodo News agency and national broadcaster NHK reported Takeshita, 76, had died of respiratory failure at a Tokyo hospital early today.\n\nTakeshita, who served as premier from 1987 to 1989, announced his retirement from politics last month after more than a year in the hospital. He was originally hospitalized in April 1999, complaining of lower back pain.\n\nDespite his departure from office, Takeshita was long regarded as one of the \"shadow shoguns\" in Japanese politics. The two prime ministers who succeeded him, Sosuke Uno and Toshiki Kaifu, were seen as hand-picked by Takeshita.\n\nTakeshita was also the mentor of Keizo Obuchi, who was prime minister until suffering a stroke in April. Obuchi died May 14.\n\nDemure in stature and known for an evasive way of speaking, Takeshita was far from flamboyant and appeared content to remain in the shadows while serving as premier.\n\nTakeshita was forced from office after admitting to accepting illicit stock and cash donations from Recruit Co., a marketing and information firm. He was never charged.\n\nHe continued to wield considerable behind-the-scenes power as head of the Liberal Democratic Party's largest faction in Parliament. Takeshita handed control of the faction to Obuchi in the mid-1990s, but he remained the major force within it. Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who replaced Obuchi, also belongs to the Obuchi faction.\n\nTakeshita, however, was never able to put the bribery scandal entirely behind him. One of his top aides committed suicide in 1989, setting off speculation in the Japanese media that he may have chosen death over having to disclose the wrongdoing of his boss.\n\nFirst elected to Parliament in 1958, Takeshita rose in the ruling party ranks under the tutelage of Kakuei Tanaka, prime minister from 1972 to 1974. Tanaka was arrested in 1976 on charges of receiving bribes from the U.S. aircraft maker Lockheed. He was convicted in the lower courts and died in 1993 while appealing his case to the Japanese Supreme Court.\n\nA son of a sake brewer, Takeshita was a graduate of the prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo. He was an English teacher before turning to politics but confessed to not speaking the language very well.\n\nAs prime minister, Takeshita maintained the conservative, pro-business and pro-U.S. philosophy of his party.\n\nHe is most remembered for helping to pass a controversial sales tax. The unpopular tax, combined with the scandals, eventually led to a massive election defeat for the governing party in the 1989 upper house elections."
