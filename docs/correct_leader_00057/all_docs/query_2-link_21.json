        "text": "Less than two months after his one-year anniversary of becoming the 41st president of the United States, George H. W. Bush thought he was planning a weekend out of the office filled with tennis, golf and sun for March 2-4, 1990.\n\nWhite House staff had arranged for President Bush and his wife, Barbara, to visit their friends, Walter Annenberg and his wife Leonore, who served on the National Steering Committee of the George Bush for President Campaign.\n\nBut on Feb. 23, Bush found himself on the phone with the recently elected Prime Minister of Japan, Toshiki Kaifu, who had been serving in the position for six months but had only been elected three days prior. Bush took a moment on the phone to propose a meeting between the two who, at the moment, found themselves facing trade tensions, among other issues between the world’s two most powerful capitalist economies at the time.\n\n“Depending on your schedule, I suggest we meet in California,” Bush said on the phone. “I want you to know that I have no hidden agenda or special message for you. After your magnificent election victory, I wanted to get together to talk. The U.S.-Japan relationship is vital to both countries, and that is what this meeting is all about.”\n\nKaifu first said he would consider the invitation before agreeing to meet Bush for the second time. Just one week after the first phone call, the Japanese Prime Minister touched down in Palm Springs and was greeted with a 10-minute ceremony, while Bush’s motorcade rolled in from anti-drug speeches earlier in the day in Los Angeles and Santa Ana.\n\nTheir meetings — both on Friday and Saturday — as well as the official dinner hosted by the Bush family at the Annenberg compound, attended almost exclusively by government officials from both countries, didn’t accomplish much – officially.\n\nBut it did set the tone for a prosperous relationship between the two over the next three years, and set a benchmark for diplomatic events held outside the White House and earned Sunnylands its distinction as a historic site by the city of Rancho Mirage.\n\nThe two leaders first met in Washington, D.C., six months prior on Sept. 1, 1989, shortly after Kaifu took office. As a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kaifu rose from education minister to the party leader in 1989, and after Prime Minister Sosuke Uno resigned from office due to scandal, Kaifu was elected to fill his term on Aug. 9, 1989.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 1990, Kaifu was elected for a full 18-month term as the 76th prime minister.\n\nAt the time, the relationship between the two countries hung in the balance. The United States faced a $49 billion trade deficit with Japan, and government officials were growing increasingly impatient as Americans believed Japan to be unwilling to open its markets to more American imports.\n\nIn the days leading up to what would be known as the “Summit in the Sun,” officials from both countries asserted that no tangible accomplishments would come from these meetings – rather that the time spent would hopefully lead to significant change down the road that would help avoid sanctions threatened by trade legislation the United States passed in 1988. Beyond their international trade relationship, both sides planned to discuss initiatives to combat drug use, help countries in eastern Europe and Latin America, and reaffirm their strong military alliance to keep the Pacific region under control.\n\nAfter Kaifu landed in the desert, the two held their initial business meetings at The Club at Morningside before traveling less than a mile to the Sunnylands compound for the formal dinner hosted by the Bushes for the 28 combined guests from both traveling groups. Very few non-political friends of the Annenbergs were invited, emphasizing the diplomatic focus of the events – particularly for a formal dinner held outside the White House at a private residence, which was very rare.\n\nBut with the air of formality and the Annenbergs’ connection to United States politics, Sunnylands is no stranger to official White House business – both back in the 1990s as well as recently.\n\nBush’s Secretary of State James A. Baker. III summarized the unique fit between Sunnylands and the pair of presidents’ official dinners in his thank-you note to the Annenbergs after the closing of the weekend.\n\n“I know you were initially expecting to spend a more quiet couple of days with the President. Sunnylands was, of course, a perfect setting for the meetings with Prime Minister Kaifu,” he wrote. “All of your visitors – American and Japanese alike – were deeply impressed not only by the beautiful surroundings, but also every detail of the arrangements.\n\n“Those of us who’ve had the pleasure of being your guests in the past know that you are wonderful hosts – but your efforts with regard to the Prime Minister’s visit were simply above and beyond.”\n\nIn the spring of 2013, Cinny Kennard, the head of the Washington office for the Sunnylands retreat team entrusted with managing political traffic around the compound after the passing of the Annenbergs, was contacted by the White House. In similar fashion to the Japanese summit in 1990, Barack Obama's administration was interested in hosting an important meeting between the President and the Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nObama sought out Sunnylands for its relaxed nature as a meeting site between two parties sitting down seriously for one of the first times. Jinping took office in March of that same year, and his meeting with Obama just three months later in June offered a chance for the two to broker a personal connection between the leaders of the two leading economic powers of the time before likely difficult future meetings began.\n\nKnowing that both sides would have several difficult topics to tackle in the near future – trade inequities, cyber theft, human rights and environmental concerns, for example – the two leaders agreed upon the necessity to meet in a relaxed atmosphere. For what would later be called the “Shirt-sleeves summit”, Sunnylands provided a perfect backdrop away from the formalities of dark suits and stiff nature of past meetings.\n\nBut as the weeks passed and the meeting drew closer, an air of opulence and formality crept its way into the planning stages of the weekend, as Sunnylands and White House staff analyzed the estate’s collection of world-class dinner party decorations and tableware. In the end, they asked to closely study the protocols used during the Bush-Kaifu meeting more than 23 years ago to help set the tone.\n\nBoth dinners displayed individual place setting menus on heavy card stock that looked very similar. Both pairs of dignitaries signed a menu together that was left for the Sunnylands archives. The flatware, linens, crystal, china, dinner menu and wine list used for President Obama’s visit, though adjusted for the specifics of the occasion, also fed off President Bush’s visit.\n\nThe next day, Obama and Jinping strolled through the Sunnylands grounds to take care of their official business, another diversion from the more highly orchestrated sit-down meetings that Bush and Kaifu sat through together while they got to know each other and discussed the international issues of the day.\n\nAt the end of both weekends, neither pair of dignitaries produced new concrete legislation to bring back to their countries, but instead talked at length about issues pertinent to both countries’ continued cooperation and success.\n\n“I was very pleased to welcome my friend, the Prime Minister of Japan, here to Palm Springs for two days of very useful and far-reaching discussions about the critically important relationship between the United States and Japan,” said President Bush in a press conference after his final talks with the Prime Minister.\n\n“We first met last September, and in the intervening months we’ve seen some of the most momentous changes in recent world history. It is important that the leaders of the United States and Japan come together and review the entire scope of their relationship at this time of profound change in the world.”\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower was the first U.S. president to visit Sunnylands in 1966, and since, presidential visitors have flocked to the Annenberg estate for reprieve away from the stresses of the office – or life after. They’ve played countless rounds of golf, fished in one of the several small lakes, rang in the New Year and even drafted a State of the Union Address.\n\nBut rarely has “Camp David of the West” been used for more globally important summits than during these two weekends. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy first set the trend of holding official dinners outside the White House when she and President John F. Kennedy hosted one at Mount Vernon in July of 1961 for President Ayub Kham of Pakistan – the first ever.\n\nBush’s meeting, which originally was supposed to be an escape to the desert, instead grabbed the eyes and attention of two nations toward the Coachella Valley and set a trend for international diplomatic meetings between the United States and Asia’s powers.\n\nWhether relaxing on the golf course or holding court inside a country club with a major diplomatic leader, Bush held the Coachella Valley in high esteem.\n\n“Happiness is a visit with the Annenbergs at Sunnylands,” President Bush wrote to thank Leonore and Walter. “With family love and many thanks, George Bush.”"
