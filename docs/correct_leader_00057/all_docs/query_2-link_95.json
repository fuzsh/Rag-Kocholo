While the Suzuki and Tanaka factione have been steadily preparing for Suauki's reelection, the Fukuda, Komoto, and Nakagawa factiona ',have :uddenly begun sfirengthening their critical poe~_+!:e toward the Suzuki- Tanaka regime. The undercurrent in the polltical eituation certainly seems to have begun moving toward Che LDP preaidential election this fall.

What is in the ~ninds of . each faction's leading members.... Two Eyes of Typhoon~ Have Begun ~Ioving One day in early April, Rokusuke Tanaka, the chaixman of LDP's Policy Research Council and one of those close to the pr:m~ minister, \"te~pted\" Economic Planning Agency Direc:tor Komot~ by saying: \"Mr Komoto, wouldn't you like tn ga to the Versailles summit (the advanced nati~ns' summit confErence)?\" Bewildered, Komoto asked: \"Doesn't Mr Abe (MITI Miniatpr) want to go?\" Tanaka answered: \"No problsra, you caii aqueeze yourself in.\" Prim~ Minister Suzuki had Komoto accompany him to the North-South summit last fall and succeeded ~n keeping Komoto in his cabinet. Recurrence of the same pattern. . . . ~ \"Komoto will resign his cabinet post some day. If an LDP presidential election primary is held, he will surely resign.\" It was a firatclass check by Tanaka, who has a unique sens~ for a~ticipating sii:uations. 3 3 FOIt OFFICIAL, USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2047/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000540080013-4 J FOR OF~tC1AL USE ONI.Y Ur~e month has passed since then. Komoto has been speaking not on\"ty about economic issues but also about defense issues and emphasizing his \"exiatence.\" He has al3o had a meeting with former Prime Minister Fukuda, for wh.;.ch he carefully chose the timing. \"Two eyes of_ tiyphoons have at la.st be~un moving\"-- those s~urrounding the prime minister have assumed a stancP. In June there will be~~lo ehortage of uncertain factore ;ahich will shake the political ar~r.a. The firet vardicts wi?1 be handed down to the politica,l defendants in the Lockheed incident, and the revenue deficit in FY-81 will be revealed to be 2 trill~ion yen. Moreover, administrative reform budget compilation, trade friction...difficult hurdles follow o:~e after antither. As Tanaka ~ias read the si.tii~tion, if Komoto runs in a primary electiom atd Abe and orchers follow him, a primary el~ction will be h~1d. In euch a case, it will he a taek of extreme difficulty fo~ the prime minister, who has been indifferent about recruiting LDP members, to obtain the highest vote total in a primary election. \"Don't wosry, such a thing won't happen,\" says the prime ffiinister. In spite of the difficult environment, he displays tremendous confidence to leading ~ members of the Suzuki faction who are concerned. \"Anybody can offer criticism. If my way is wrong, they should offer specific countermeasures.\" Whoever becomes prime minister, tt~ia difficult aituation will remain unchanged. The bill for deficit government bonds isaued under the Fukuda administration is now being presented. Komoto himaelf is responaible for the economic slunap, isn't he? The prime minist~r has b~en hinting at a~oint respon~ibi7ity theory between the linea. He aeems to iudge that \"Itomoto and Abe (a F~kuda faction member) lack a~ust cauae for rebellion a~ainst Suzuki.\" Confidence Supported by the TanaF:a Faction What firms up Suzuki's cur.f.idence is the support of the Tanaka faation, the strongest corps in the LDP. The Tanaka fac~ion has 109 Diet membera. Ta Together with 86 Suzuki facrion members,~i~ accounts for almost half of the 423 LDP Diet members. Even if the three fac~ians ~riti~al of the Suzuki _ administration are united, they total only 129, far from the total number of the Tanaka and Suzuki factions. The Suzuki and Tanaka Re~~e, a Strategy of Harmony As long as tY~e Tanaka faction, which has been gasping under the heavy preseure of the LockhEed incident, is in a situation where \"there is no option other than Suzuki's reelection\" (a leading member ~f the Tanaka faction), Suzuki will w~.n overwhelmingly in the LDP presiden~ial balloting by LDP Diet members even if a primsry election is held. It is an indication of the atrategy of simple harmony that the Suzuki-Tanaka regim~ ia a sum-of--one-plus-one regime [the Japanese character for \"sum\" also means \"har~uuny\"]. The Suzuki regime is said ~o be a monol~.thiG regime, When acratched, however, it reveals unexpected fragility. From the beginnix~g ot the Suzuki administra- ~ tion, dissatisfaction over personnel matters has ~?e:~ smoldering within the Tanaka faction.

On the issue of reforming the upper house's n~tionwide electoral district, the focus of attention in the curren`;: . Diet sessiun, the leadir.g members o,� the '~aaaka fact3on who hgve been actually negotiating were placed in a difficult position because the prime minister had not made ur,s hia mind until recently. . \"Suzuki never gets his own handa dirty. He always mak~s use of ua,\" is $ , complaint that is constantly heard w~thin the Ta~taka fa~tion. � \"Suzuki became prime minister ir. a frock. If he is car~less, he will die suddenly,\" wisecracked former Prime Minister Tanaka the other day in a meeting ' with young me~nbers of the Suzuki. faction. His tone contained a toucta of cynicism in recognition of the- voice8 within the Tanal~ faction. Tanaka's earnest w~sh is to overcome the Lockheed incident and to restore the pow~r of the Tanaka faction as a whole. . For this purpose, elections to both the House of Itepresentatives and Councilors should be held under the direction o~f the LDP Secretary General Nilcaido and - Leputy Secretary General TakF:3hita. Then, \"the Tanaka faction membership will nwnber 135\" (~former Prime Minister Tanaka). Tanaka's remark apgears to be a thr.eat warning the Suzuki factioa that Suzuki's reelection ig a means for restoration of the Tanaka faction and that the Tanaka fa~tion does not uncond~tionally support Suzuki's reeleG+tion. y _ Former Prime Minist~r Tanaka intends to have his son-in-law run iz~ the next House of Representatives election from the san~e d�lstr~.ct as Kunikichf Saito, the chief clerk of the Suzuki faction. This is one example. \"Suzuki became prime minister accidentally. You have served enough, havea't you? Give the ~ob to Fukuda or Komoto.\" Recently, this message was delivered to Suzuki from former Prime Minister Kishi. Since Sato, no prime minister has succeeded in being reel.2cted. When Suzuki rec~ived Kishi's message, the supposedly confident prime minieter's face cloude~d over for a moment without a wcrd. [4 May 82 p 2] First to Hold a Study Meeting One evening in early Apr~l, Agriculture Minister Tazawa was greeting former , agriculture ministers wi~h complet~ graciousness.

Soon, the partcipants formed groupa of close friends and talked within the groups. Fukuda, surrounded by Matsuno, Nakagawa (the director of the Science and Technology Agency and others, grie~ved over the criais in national finances even on this kind of occasion, which was fitting for a financial expert. \"We often make erroneous economic forecasts. However,.when we make a miatake, we have to take new measures. We cannot allow ourrsalves to stan~i idly by _ and watch the situation.\" He criticized Suzuki, who will not even freeze expenditures partially, in spite of a FY-81 revenue dificit that wi~.l certainly reach 2 trillion~yen. OnP person told Fukuda: \"It is your turn to act in this political situation. You should speak out.\" To him, Fu~uda nooded, but said: \"I cannot speak now. Well, ~et's watch for the governnient'a efforts.\" \"There will be great distucbancss in the world this year. Even if I don't mov~e, heaven will move.\" At the beginning of the year, Fukuda oftea iseued such warnings. Recently, however, he has been keeping silent in public places. The reasona why are his realixation that he cannot move thought- , lessly and his good srrnse that criticism of the goverament before the Versailles aummit (starting 4 June) ie against the national interest. Nevertheless, before any other factions, the Fukuda faction will hold a virtual fraction study meeting in Hatic,one on 19 J~na. In order to lighten the factiGr.a~ color of the meeting, the meeting is being called \"a meettng to gather with Mr and Mrs Fukuda.\" .Fukuda i~ qn the verge of br.eaking his silence there. It will be after the first verdicts handed down to golitical ~~efendants in the Lackheed trial (8 June). The~.verdicts are said to be certain to be guilty. The revenue deficit also will be determined by then. Moreover, ~ Suzuki is travelling overseas to attend Versailles summit, the United Nations' Special Se~sion on Disarmament, and to visit South America.iu~.order to avoid the impact of th~ verdiets, and he will return to Japan on 18 June \"when the excitement will have cooled down\" (a middlestanding member of the Suzuki faction). The Fukuda faction meeting will be held on thP day after 18 June. It is very good timing. ~ When the Desire Arises, Can He Not Speak? \"Mr Fukuda has a desire to make a comeback as prime minister. When he has the desire, he cannot speak out.\" Those close to the prime minister check Fukuda in this manner. Irukuda, on the other hand, complains to those close to him: \"The political situation is depressing. Suppressed by ~he power of numbers (the Tanaka faction), diesatisfaction has been accumulating in the � LDP. Some day, it will explode.\" But will Fukuda \"declare war\" by himaelf? If Fukuda decides to rebel against the Suzuki-Taaaka regime in preparation for the fall battle, Nakagawa will move and Shintaro Abe (MITI minister) will follow. Even though Fukuda is powerless in terms of numbers before the huge wall of the Suzuki-Tanaka regime, the weight of his words as an elder stateman is unrivaled. Furthermore, behind Fukuda is former Prime Minister \" 6 FOR 08FICIAI.

They also keep close contact with ToRhto - Komoto (director of the Economic Planning Agency), whose resii3aation people also have been talking about. J About a half a month ago, Abe met secretly with Komoto in Okayama while on a business trip. They spent a long time tallcing about the prospects of the political situation this fall. Immaediately afterward, a Fukuda-Komoto meeting was held. The unseen thread is graduallg becoming visible. Nevertheless, there is a great di.fference between Fukuda's and Komoto's philosophies even on the issue of economic manag~ment. Within the Fuku3a - faction, there is a mood ot war-wearinese: \"We flatly refuse a recurrence of the 40-day :truggle for the other faction (the IGomoto faction).\" It is contradictory for Fukuda, who opposes a primary election, to have Abe run in a primary. Moreover, even if Abe and other Fukuda fa~tioa members resign ~1 their cabinet pasts, the future prospects cannot be foreseen. \"Training is not good.

However, - high-ranking members such as Kiaju Moriyama said nothing. Unlike Miki, who is fanaticaZly \"antiplutocrat,\" Komoto is aiming for the prime minis~ership by maintaining harmony with other LDP members. The questions really touched on his weaknesa. Komoto was not preaent at that meeting. In order to avoid exciting other factions, meanbers were strictly ~rohibited from ta~king about this Achillea' heel of Komoto. The scene revealed the agony of Komoto's strategy. Both Yasuhiro Nakasone (director of the Adminietrative Management Agency) and Komoto are powerful persons aiming for the poat-Suzuki prime mini~tership. However, their factions are the fourth and fifth largest, following the Tanaka, Suzuki and Fukuda factions. Their factione each have less than 50 LDP Diet members and cannot run a candidate by themselves in the LDF presidential primary election. Both Nakasone and Kamoto have been taken into Suzuki's cabinet and have become disabled birda in a cage. In this environment, Komoto has made the firat move. On 27 March Komoto met with Fukuda, who has been critical of the Suzuki-Tanaka regime, for the first time this year. Concerning Komoto, it has been said that \"unless he moves, he cannot grab political power\" (a leading member of � the Suzuki faction). At last, speculation spread within the LDP that Komoto would cooperate with Fukuda. Komoto, however, would only com~ent Chat \"Mr Fukuda is the authority on economic policy.\" Cannot Wait Until Next Time Komo~~'s basic strategy is to maneuver large factions with many m~mbere in preparation for the selection of the LDP president by LDP Diet members. For Chis purpose, he has contacted not only Ftikuda but also the leading members of the Fukuda f~ction, such as MITI Minister Abe and Shiokawa, the deputy chairman of the LDP Executive Coma?ittee. Moreover, he has had meetings with former Director General of the Defense Agency Kanemaru, a leading member of the Tanaka faction. It is a strategy of \"steadily permeati~ng the LDP with the Komoto colors\" (Naozo ~hibuya, the chief caretak~r of the Komoto faction). However, the possibility of Fukuda sppporting Komoto in thie fall's decisive battle remains completely immersed \".in a fog\" (a leading m~mber of the Komoto faction). Ko~oto faces harsh realities. Concerning rumors that Komoto will resign his cabinet post in June or confront Suzuki over economic poli~y, Komoto clearly denies them when he says: \"Don't worry about such things.\" It is certain, however, thati Komoto, 71 years old, the same as the pr3me minister, \"cannot pass this fall's presidential election and wait for the next one in 1984\"(Shibuya). 8 ~ Fa?~Y OFF'[CIAL U6L ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040500080013-4 FOR OFFICIAI.

We have to be cautious about him.\" The Tanaka faction's doubts are strong. ~ Recently, Komoto travelled throughout the country to campaign for the new ~ faces of the Komoto faction who are planning to run in the next elections to both houses. He has also contacted leaders of the middle-of-the-road parties su~;h as Ikko Kasuga, the permanent couttselor of the Democratic ~ Socialist Party, in order to exchange opinioas about the political situation and policies. He displays \"new movements\" of these types. Even if Suzulci - is reelected in the presidentisl election this fall, a radical political change may follow Su~uki's reelection. It seems certain that Komoto has begun moving in preparation for it. Exclusively Repeats \"Adminiatrative Reform\" Meanwhile, Nakasone exclusively repeats the words \"adm~inistrative reform\" and stakes his political life on it. Even if party opinion is divided over the issue of reforming the Japan National Railways, and he is asked to do various things and is ~ttacked from every direction, he is ready to stick to a principle and commit double suicide together with the administraf.ivA reform~ , \"It wj.ll never become a disadvantage,\" says Sosuke Uno, the'chief caretaker of the Nakasone faction. The calculation is that Nal~asone�s efforts will wipe out his reputation as oae who \"wants to be too goai,d all the time,\" and build a new image of Nakasone within the LDP. Pleased by the 6,000 people who gathered at a recent party of the faction, Nakasone displayed his hidden confidence in saying: \"This is an advance toward our great wish.\" To Nakasane, the road toward political power is also narrow and hard. The Fukuda faction, whose schemes failed due by Nakasone's change of heart at decisive moments in the past, auch as the first Tanaka-Fukuda battle, is _ very cautious about Nakasone. = Contrary to their ho~e prefecture's desire for a\"Joshu League,\" there is no pipeline between Fukuda and Naka~one at present.

[Roman Numeral One] The World Situation and JCP's Inter- national Duty . 1. Th e Deepening Crisis of World Capitalism The 15th congress of the JCP characterized the cris~s confronting cap italiam in the world today as a\"grave h~atorical cris3s in every political and economic aspect comparable to those that existed before and after : World War I and II.\" International developmEnts in the some 2 years since that congress have juatif ied th is characterization with many facts. The world's capitalist economy~ which experienced the second oil crunch, has been experiencing an ongoing recession since 1980. World trade declined and surplus production has become a problem. In the United States and West European countries, unemployment has rapidly increased, surpassing the hi~hes t levels of the postwar era. This recession has led~to a severe inflation and fiscal bankruptcy in many countries, which in turn are making the world economic crisis even more serious. Under these circumstancea~ various.quarters have signaled their warning of a\"recurrence of the world crisis of the 1980's.\" For decades, the world`s monopoly ca.pitalism has been ueing Keynesian policies, which systematized state monopoly capitalism and governmPntal intervention in the economy as the main pillare propping up the capitalist economy; amid the economic crisis today, however, the leadera th emselves of such monopoly capitalist countries as the United States, Britain and Japan have been compelled to admit the collapse of such policies. The fact that they are left with few policy options in this crisis is making the vicious cycle of the economic crisis even more severe. The f irst summit meeting of industrialized nations was held in 1975, offering the promise that cooperation among the ma~or capitalist countries would - ,enable the world to overcome the crisis; in the 8 years since then, these 13 ~ ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 APPROVED F~R RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 FOR OFFICIAL USE 6NLY su~nits have failed to adopt any serious program to combat the crisis although they adopted measures to partially \"ad~uat\" policies from time to time. The tvtal number of unemployed in the seven-member nations was 8.5 million in 1975; it has surpassed the 20-~illion level today. ~ T'he old international economic order centering on the Un3ted States began disintegrating in the early 1970's in the midat of the international monetary crisis and the oil crunch. This const3tutes c?ne of the moat impoxtant aspects , of tlie crisis of world capitalist economy. The monopoly capitalist countries, led by the United States, have made very passible effort to rebuild this international order but they have failed to achieve the kind of succese they see.l~ {n this f ield. New contradictions and confrontations have emerged. Developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, which account for half of the world population, still f ind themselves under the burden of prolonged colonial rule. In addition, they continue to be sub~ected t~ econom3c pressures from imperialism ar..d capitalism. Thus, as focal pointe of a~l the contradiction~ of world capitalist economy, these countr3es have exper~enced particularly severe economic difficulties in the world receseion. Their total external deb ts grew 6 timea 3.n 10 years from $87 billion in 1971 to $524 billion in 1981. .A Worl d Bank report predicte that the number of people tn the \"absolute poverty\" category in these countries will increaee by another 100 million from the present 750 million by the end of this century. The UN confer ence on envirorunenC held in May aerioualy warned that the environ- mental destruction of the ear th--in the form of air and sea pollution, diminish - ing forAsts, desolation of green land, populatidn increases and fnod problems, water shorta ges, increases in famine-struck populations and waste of resources-- is progressing toward ~eopardizing mankind's very survival. This warn~.ng is directed at no one but world capitalism which sti11 has the bulk of the earth under its economic control. The resolution of the 15th JP C Congreas called for an \"international struggle to impose democratic controls on multina~ional firms, establish economic sovereignty and establish a new international economic order on the basis of equality and fairness izi oppoaition to attempts to reorganize in a reactionary way the exiatiing international economic order which fs dominated ~ by the United States and which infringes upon the econamic sovereignty of other nations.\" It has become a11 the more the urgent task for people of all countries to pueh this atruggl e, along with the struggle for democratic economj.c reforma in each country de~.~;gn~d to el3minate control by monopoly capital and imperialism. 2. Plan for L imited Nuclear Warfare Poses Threat to All Nations There is a growing tendency among reactionary imperialist and monopoly capitalist circles led by U.S. imperial ism to try to find a way out of the ever-deepenin g crisis facing world capitalism through arms expanaion, aggression and war.

We cannot forget the historical fact that the 1930 economic cris3s served as a signal for the forces of fa~~F�ism and militarism to touch off war: the Japanese ruling circles were driven to wage a war of aggression against China; the crisis also paved the way for World War II. Particularly the Reagan administrat3dn of the United States, which came to power under the banner of \"a strong America,\" has overtly .pursued a\"policy of = strength\" ~3th might and main while covering up its real nature behind a - smokescreen of ..ountering the \"Soviet threat.\" The Reagan administration has stepped up acte of war, aggression and intervention while pushing a large- scale ~rms builaup centered around nuclear arms. It has inereased rapid deployment forces in the Middle East-Peraian Gulf region and the Rorean Peninsula and intervened in such i.atin American countries ag Nicar~gua and E1 Salvador, blatantly disregarding the sovereign righte of the people in theae countries. Highlightin; the dangerous nature of the Reagan administration's superhawkieh policy to ai~ nations in the world is Reagan's concept of limited nuclear warfare, the feasibility of which he has reiterated time and time again. As ~;ur party has pointed out all along, the limited nuclear warfare idea is a \"nuclear war version of the policy of attack3ng other countries one by one,\" _ as mentioned in the report to the 14th JCP Gongress~ a policy which regards ~ resort to nuclear war as a meane td att~in aggressive aims in target areae while avoiding an all-out nuclear wa~ with the Soviet Union. The U.S. ~ailitary has held this concept as the found~?tion of U.S. nuclear gtrategy~over the p~s~ 10 years. . It is a serious matt~r that while saying that \"in reflection\" the United Statea lost the Vietnam War because it did not use nuclear weapona~,the Reagan administration has hastened to increase its nuclear warfare capability in Europe and East Asia (including Japan) by bringfng back this barbarous concept of nuclear warfare to the fore. Thie stem~ from a einieter attempt to turn ~ rnuclear weapons into '~usable�weapans,\" namely weapone which can be used in actual fighting without compunction, not stopping at using them as a means of a blackmail. This is fraught with the danger of escalation to all-out nuclear war. The Reagan administration'e etreae on its limited t~uclear war plan has brought to light the real role of U.S.-dominated military bloce Fuch as '~ATO and the Japan-U.S. security treaty and has reaulted in the collapse of the deceptive \"nuclear umbrella theory.\" Theae military blocs are not \"bulwarks\" for the security of the participating r.ations but yokea whieh will lead to national ruin by making their territories theatera of nuclear warfare for the security ~ of the United Statea. Neverthelees, the Reagan administration, with the aggreasive atrengthening.~f these military bloce ae an important pillar of ~ its \"policy of etrength,\" ie preasing its allies to step up preparatione for ~oint combat operations under U.S. leaderehip and to carry out a new arms 15 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY buildup, in disregard of the voices of all nations against limite4 r.uclear warfare. The Reagan administration itself is increasing its theater nuclear forces in a planned manner, including b~.y planning deployment of cruise missiles in Japan and elsewhere. - With Japan and other allies, the Reagan administration has persistently taken a negative and obatructionist attitude in disariaament diacuasions in the United Nations and elsewhere toward disarmament measures, including on the resolution calling for a ban on the use of nuclear weapons which may poseib ly - stand in its plan for limited nuclear warfare. Under the Reagan administration, the danger of a limited nuclear war has ee~ome real, with the possibility of ite being ignited by a claeh anywhere 3n the world. It has become an urgent central task~ literally a matter of national survival or death, for ~all'.nations in the world to oppoee the U.S. plan for limited nuclear warfare and prevent the concept of limited nuclear warfare from being put into execution~ as well as to achieve a total ban on nuclear weapons~ which wi11 remove the possibility of a nuclear war from the earth. It is especially important under the preeent tenee intes~national situation to maintain the position of settl3ng international disputes by peaceful means in opposition to all manifest atte~npCs to resort to the \"position of strength\" in settling international disputes. There are wars actually going on now over .territorial diaputes, as is the case witt~ the Iran-Iraq war and the Falklands war between Britain and Argentina. These wars, although limited to the respective belligerents at the moment,~are fraught with the danger of escalat- _ ing into large-scale wars if big powers intervene. Depending on the s3tuatiou, _ no one can rule out~the poss3bility of their leading to a limited nuclear war. A territorial diapute ie an international one betwe~n two independent countries, which is by nature diflerent from a national liberat3on struggle no matter how legitimate the claim of each party may be. Accordingly, thoro~gh adherence to the principie of ach~eving a peaceful settlement tk,sough dialogue is the only cor.rect way to contribute to world peace. 3. The World Is Changing ~ . The world's overall balance of power today is radically different from what it was when preparations for th e two world wara were underway. The situation of ov~r 60 years ago~ when imperialism-monopoly capitalism could dominate'the whole earth, is a thing of the past. At present, countries which account for one-third of the world population have embarked upon the road of socialism after leaving the capitalist world. MQreover, most of the former colonies and dependencies have cut their colonial ahackles and won political - independence. The ma~ority of these countries have ~oined the nonaligned stunmit conference, forming a powerful current in world politics with world pea~e, national self-determination~ a ban on nuclear weapons and the dissolution of military blocs as their goa7,. ~6 FOR OFFICtAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500080013-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/49: CIA-RDP82-00850R040500080013-4 - FOR OFFIrIAL USE ONi.Y 'i'r~ie, the United States, Japan and the West European monopoly capitalist countries account for more than half of the world's induetrial production. : But in terms of population~ they account for only one-sixth of the world. In the United Nations, aocialist and nonal3gned countries now occupy about ~ two-thirds of the seats, greatly reducing the ability of the Weetern countries led by the United States, in terme of vot3ng strength, to ram their imperialist policies through the United Nations. Inaide the monoply capitalist countries~ the working elass and the peop~:e are intensifying their atruggle~ ahaking the ruling systeme in their countries ~and the policies of the imperialiets and reactionaries. It is of international significance that reformist governments successively came into being in France and ~reece last year ss a reeult of ~udgment inade bv the voters. Particularly the French Socialiet Par:y occupies a special place among thE European Social Deanocratic forcea by having pursued a united front policy with the comm~uaist party over the past 10 years since 3.t abandoned the line of anticom~uniet alliance which it had followed for a long time in the poatwar period. Despite the complexity of ite past and ite contradictions, the French ~ocialist Party won the presidential election by dint of the unit ed front with the coam?unist party and succeeded in forming a coalition government with the co~nunist party for the f irst time in 30 yeare. This providee a comanon lesaon in reg~rd to political reform and the cause of democracy and eociali,sm in advanced capitalist countriess although ~he French ; Socialist Party's policies have a n,umber of quest3onable sepects, such as its argument about nuclear armarnet~t liased on the \"thQOry of anilitary balance.\" Another iinportant change which hae tak~n place since laet year is that the strengthening of the Reagan acietinistratian's post.ure for limite.d nuclear warfare has raiaed fears and protas~ts among the people of the NATO~countries in Europe, who have become aware of trhe deceptive nature of th e\"nuclear ~brella theory.\" As a result, antinucl.ear movements in these countries against a balance of nuclear terror have apread so wide that they have shaken the ~ very foundation of the militarq alliance. In the United States, too, the Reagan policy is caus:!:~g various conflicts and ruptures between the government and the people who ar~~ being weighed down by the heavy burden of arms expansion - and among the Ieading circles who have hitherto eupported and puehed the U.S. nuclear war policy. Overall, the world is clearly undergoing a great change jn the direction of peace and progress~ with objective conditions continuing to exist and on the increase for frustrating the imperialista' nuclear war plan which, if unchecked, would bring about ruinous catastrophe for all nations.
