She was also ambassador to France and Portugal (2011-15) and to Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany (2015-17).\n\nUberaba, José Cesario de Miranda Ribeiro, visconde de (b. July 1, 1792, Vila Rica [now Ouro Preto], Minas Gerais, Brazil - d. May 7, 1856, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), president of São Paulo (1835-36) and Minas Gerais (1837-38); son-in-law of Romualdo José Monteiro de Barros, barão de Paraopeba.

He enjoyed a distinguished military career, becoming a full general in 1922, and was governor of Alta Verapaz (1907-11) and Retalhuleu (1911-19), minister of development (1920) and war (1921-23), and first vice president (1922-23). In 1926, after the death of Pres. José María Orellana, the Progressive Party nominated him for the presidency but he was defeated. In 1930 he manoeuvred to be the joint candidate of the Liberals and Progressives and was swept into office. He established financial stability and political order, built an extensive network of roads, and modernized local administrations to include increased health and school facilities. His methods, however, were authoritarian and he sternly suppressed opposition. In 1932 he introduced Decree 1816, which exempted landowners from the consequences of any action taken to protect their goods or land, effectively legalizing the murder of indigenous farmers who resisted forced labour. In June 1935 his first term, due to expire in 1937, was extended to 1943 by a \"plebiscite\"; and in September 1941 a handpicked Constitutional Congress voted to extend his term of office until March 15, 1949.

June 30, 1893, Leipzig, Germany - d. Aug. 1, 1973, Gross Dölln [now part of Templin], East Germany), German politician. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1912 and after military service in World War I became an organizer of the new German Communist Party (KPD) in 1919. In 1923 he became a member of the party's Central Committee and in 1929 he was elected to the Politburo and became district leader for Berlin-Brandenburg. He was a member of the Landtag of Saxony in 1926-29 and of the Reichstag from 1928. After the Nazis' accession to power in 1933, he fled to France. He served as an agent of the KPD and the Comintern in Paris and Moscow and as a political commissar with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). He moved to Moscow in 1938 and from 1941 worked with German prisoners of war, joining the National Committee for a Free Germany. Returning to Germany on April 30, 1945, he helped reestablish the KPD and played a leading role in the April 1946 merger in the Soviet occupation zone of the KPD and the SPD into the Socialist Unity Party (SED). On the formation of the German Democratic Republic (October 1949), he became deputy prime minister. The 3rd SED congress elected him to the new post of general secretary in 1950, making him the effective ruler of East Germany; in 1953 the title was changed to first secretary. When Pres. Wilhelm Pieck died in 1960, the presidency was abolished and a Council of State formed instead, with Ulbricht as its chairman. In 1961 he sponsored the erection of the Berlin Wall to halt an exodus of skilled professionals. This allowed an economic and political consolidation in subsequent years. His disapproval of the Soviet policy of improving relations with West Germany after 1969 led to his resignation as SED first secretary in 1971, but he retained his position as head of state until his death.\n\nUldzhabayev, Tursun(bay Uldzhabayevich) (b.

June 23, 1931, Teg, Umeå, northern Sweden - d. May 28, 2018), prime minister of Sweden (1978-79). He was active as a social worker and in the temperance movement from 1952 to 1957. In 1962 he became chairman of the Liberal Party Youth League, and during 1962-64 he was an editorial writer for the Stockholm Dagens Nyheter. He was elected to the Riksdag (parliament) in 1964. Foreign affairs was his principal interest: as far back as 1960 he was attached to John F. Kennedy's presidential election campaign on a foreign affairs study grant. In 1976 he became minister for international development. As such he was prime mover in Sweden's decision in 1977 to write off more than $208 million owed to the country by some of the world's poorest nations. In 1977 he additionally became minister for immigration, and in March 1978 he succeeded to the leadership of the small Liberal Party (Folkpartiet) and was appointed deputy prime minister in the centre-right government of Thorbjörn Fälldin. When the coalition collapsed because of disagreements about nuclear policy in October 1978, Ullsten formed a Liberal minority government. Later he became foreign minister (1979-82); after leaving the party leadership in 1983, he served as ambassador to Canada (1984-89) and Italy (1989-96).\n\nG. Ulmanis\n\nUlmanis, Guntis (b. Sept. 13, 1939, Riga, Latvia), president of Latvia (1993-99); grandnephew of Karlis Ulmanis.\n\nK. Ulmanis\n\nUlmanis, Karlis (Augusts Vilhelms) (b. Sept. 4, 1877, Berze, Russia [now in Latvia] - d. Sept. 20, 1942, Krasnovodsk, Turkmen S.S.R. [now Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan]), prime minister (1918, 1919-21, 1925-26, 1931, 1934-40) and president (1936-40) of Latvia. During the 1905 Russian revolution, he promoted Latvia's movement for political autonomy. After the defeat of the revolution he was forced to go into exile in the United States. Having been granted an amnesty by the Russian government, he returned to Latvia in 1913. Shortly after the Russian revolution of 1917, he founded the Latvian Farmers' Union, claiming Latvia's independence. With other Latvian leaders he formed a Latvian National Council which proclaimed independence (Nov. 18, 1918) and appointed him prime minister. The new nation had to defend itself not only against Russian and Latvian Communists, but also against German forces. With a Latvian army formed by Gen. Janis Balodis, supported at times by French and British naval forces and Polish troops, he cleared the country of opposition and organized the election of a constituent assembly which convened at Riga on May 1, 1920. Peace with Russia was concluded on August 11. He began his last premiership in March 1934, at a time of great political tension created by right-wing nationalists and a nazified German minority. On May 15, he suspended the Saeima (parliament) and all political parties, instituted an authoritarian regime, and introduced the corporative system of chambers. Meanwhile, a revised constitution was in the making. In 1936 he additionally became president of the republic. He had also been minister of supplies (1918-19, 1919), agriculture (1918, 1919), defense (1919-20), and foreign affairs (1926, 1931, 1934-36).

He was removed as president on July 21 and then arrested and deported to the U.S.S.R.\n\nUlrica Eleonora (b. Jan. 23, 1688, Stockholm, Sweden - d.

Dec. 23, 2015, Istanbul), prime minister of Turkey (1980-83). He was educated at the naval academy and later at the naval staff college. A career of steady promotion took him through subordinate commands to the top job of commander in chief of the navy in 1977. By that time he had forged links with the leaders of the other services, with whom he worked while a member of the Supreme Military Council. He retired from the command of the navy in August 1980, and therefore was not a member of the National Security Council that took over the country's government on September 12. As it was, his fellow commanders appointed him prime minister. Had there been no military coup, he would have become Turkish ambassador in Rome. He had learned Italian some 20 years earlier when he had served for two years in the NATO naval headquarters in Malta. Because of its links with Istanbul, the old imperial Ottoman capital, and also because of the abiding influence of British naval officers, who had advised the Ottoman navy for decades before World War I, the Turkish navy was considered the most gentlemanly of the nation's three military services, and it had often provided the republic with statesmen and diplomats of poise and savoir-faire. Ulusu followed that tradition. When he was chairman of the Turkish Naval Trust, he was described by a leading journalist as \"a courteous man, with whom it is a pleasure to work, with an unequalled understanding of teamwork and high ability as a coordinator.\" For many Turks, Admiral Ulusu symbolized the hope of calm after a storm. Certainly there was a world of difference between his infrequent matter-of-fact statements and the impassioned rhetoric of the politicians whom he replaced. He served until the return to civilian rule in 1983.\n\nUlveling, Georges (b. Dec. 27, 1824, Luxembourg, Luxembourg - d.

March 14, 1844, Turin, Piedmont, Kingdom of Sardinia [now in Italy] - d. July 29, 1900, Monza, Italy), king of Italy (1878-1900); son of Vittorio Emanuele II. For the most part he received the usual severe and rigid military education of his house, leaving him predisposed toward authoritarian and imperialist policies. In the war against Austria, he won great popularity by the leadership he showed in saving his troops at the Italian debacle at Custoza (June 1866). On April 22, 1868, he married his cousin Margherita Teresa Giovanna, princess of Savoy, who on Nov. 11, 1869, gave birth to the future Vittorio Emanuele III. Umberto ascended the throne on the death of his father, Jan. 9, 1878, adopting the style Umberto I (of Italy) rather than Umberto IV (of the house of Savoy, as his father had preferred to remain). There was a strong anti-monarchical opposition, but he allayed some suspicions by respecting the constitutional regime and attempting to reconcile various political and regional elements. However, he used the royal prerogative in foreign policy, approving the Triple Alliance (May 20, 1882) with Germany and Austria-Hungary and consolidating the pact in repeated visits to Berlin and Vienna. He also refused to let his governments reduce the money spent on armaments and encouraged colonial adventures in Africa, which ended in failure with the Italian defeat by Ethiopia in the Battle of Adowa (1896). Latterly he tried to override parliament in his choice of premiers and, in the face of social unrest, became associated with a harsh policy of ruling by martial law. This was met by an upsurge of republicanism, culminating in his assassination by the anarchist Gaetano Bresci.\n\nUmberto II\n\nUmberto II, in full Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria (b. Sept. 15, 1904, Racconigi, Italy - d. March 18, 1983, Geneva, Switzerland), king of Italy (1946). The only son of King Vittorio Emanuele III and Queen Elena, Umberto passed through the Royal Military Academy in Turin, was a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Sardinian Grenadiers, rose to become a colonel in 1931, and shortly before World War II was serving as general inspector of infantry. He enjoyed a reputation as a sportsman rather than as a potential head of state. Promoted to the rank of army general in January 1941 and made a marshal on Benito Mussolini's recommendation in October 1942, he commanded an armoured division during the war. After the Allies took Rome, his father appointed him lieutenant general of the realm on June 5, 1944, and abdicated in his favour on May 9, 1946. Umberto campaigned to rally the monarchist forces, but he failed to win support from the Roman Catholic Church, which declared its neutrality. Some 54% of the Italian people voted for a republic in a referendum on June 2. On June 13 he left for Portugal, protesting against what he saw as a premature assumption of his powers by the government before the final results were announced (which occurred on June 18). Under the republican constitution he, the queen, and their male descendants were permanently banished from Italy. He took residence at Cascais, Portugal, under the style of Conte di Sarre; the family moved to Geneva in 1947. On Jan. 8, 1930, he had married Maria José Charlotte Henrietta Gabriella of Saxe-Coburg (b. Aug. 4, 1906, Ostend, Belgium - d. Jan. 27, 2001, Geneva), daughter of King Albert I of Belgium.

Conscripted into the army in 1943, he was captured by Soviet troops in northern Korea in the last days of the war and was held as a prisoner of war in Siberia for two years. He began his political career in 1951 when he was elected to the Shiga prefectural assembly. First elected to the House of Representatives in 1960, he helped lay the groundwork for the normalization of relations between Japan and South Korea in the early 1960s, and in the 1970s developed a reputation as one of the Liberal-Democratic Party's leading experts on finance. He served in various ministerial posts including defense (1974), trade and industry (1983), and foreign affairs (1987-89) before the party chose him to be prime minister in June 1989, largely because he was one of the few politicians untainted by the stocks-for-favours scandal that brought down his predecessor, Noboru Takeshita. Ironically, his own term of office appeared doomed from the start due to a sex scandal (media reports that he had had extramarital affairs with several geishas, including an outspoken \"Ms. A\"). Party elders sharply curtailed his campaign appearances in the upper house elections of July 1989, ostensibly so as not to offend women voters. The LDP's crushing defeat in those elections was the last straw, and after 68 days in office he was compelled to resign in August.

His career as a public servant began in 1977, when he worked for a year in the ministry of labour. He then became director of the national civil aviation authority (1980-82), mayor of Medellín (1982-84), a national senator (1986-94), and governor of Antioquia (1995-97). In 2002 the former Liberal, running as an independent (forming his own Colombia First movement) and backed by the Conservative Party, was elected president with 53% of the vote, having pledged to crack down on leftist rebels in a bid to end four decades of political violence. He boosted the armed forces and stepped up the offensive. He launched peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN), but the main leftist insurgency, the 17,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), members of which had killed his father in a 1983 kidnapping attempt, rejected negotiations with Uribe, calling him a warmonger. Uribe secured a controversial peace deal with right-wing paramilitary forces that led to the demobilization of 30,000 fighters. He repeatedly dismissed earlier claims that he himself once had links with the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). During his first four-year term he put 25% more troops and police on the streets and nearly doubled defense spending, backed by U.S. aid. A constitutional amendment he pushed through Congress in 2005 allowed him to seek a second term, and in 2006 he became the first reelected president since Rafael Núñez in 1892. Credited with improving security and achieving strong economic growth, he won 62% of the vote. He stood out as Washington's strongest ally in a region that was dominated by leftist leaders. His second term was marred by scandals over human rights abuses by troops and the illegal wiretapping of his opponents by the state intelligence agency. In 2010 the constitutional court rejected a proposal for a referendum on amending the constitution to allow a third term. He won a Senate seat in 2014. In August-October 2020 he was placed under house arrest while being investigated for fraud and witness tampering in a case related to his alleged support for illegal paramilitaries.\n\nUriburu (Uriburu), Enrique Casiano (b.

Born into a family prominent in the war of independence against Spain, he held various governmental positions (including president of the Chamber in 1863-64 and 1865-67, justice and education minister in 1867-68, and federal judge) and served for some 20 years as a diplomat, notably as minister to Chile (1883-92), helping to resolve legal and diplomatic problems arising from the War of the Pacific, which had been waged by Chile against Bolivia and Peru. In 1892 he was elected vice president of Argentina with Luis Sáenz Peña, having been selected as a man of no marked political affiliations. During the following two years there were revolutionary disturbances which he worked to suppress without bloodshed. They were eventually suppressed, but Sáenz Peña resigned due to differences with the Congress and Uriburu succeeded to the presidency. During his term he issued bonds to pay off the claims of the foreign-owned railway companies, and at the beginning of 1897 was in a position to resume payment on the foreign debt for the first time since 1890. He also reorganized the armed forces and maintained peaceful relations with Chile despite a serious boundary dispute. He retired from the presidency on the completion of Sáenz Peña's term, became a senator (1901-10) and provisional president of the Senate (1902-06, 1908-09), acted as president in 1903 during the absence of Pres.

José Evaristo Uriburu. In 1890, as a junior officer, he was the co-founder of a military secret society dedicated to preserving the political ascendancy of his class in Argentina. In 1893 he became military aide-de-camp to his uncle, the vice president. In Germany from 1902, he served as a member of the Kaiser's imperial guard and became an ardent admirer of Prussian militarism. In 1907-12 he directed the Superior School of War, traveling to Germany again in 1908 to gather information on German military education. At times he also served as military attaché at Madrid and London. He was inspector general of the Argentine army in 1923-27. He retired from the army in 1929. In September 1930, during the Great Depression, he led an army revolt against the Radical leader, Pres. Hipólito Irigoyen, and became provisional head of state, setting up a government dominated by the wealthy and conservative classes. He denounced Irigoyen's pro-labour legislation, removed all Radical leaders from their administrative posts and refused to allow them to participate in politics, dissolved the Congress (a measure without precedent), and reformed the constitution and election law. After governing by decree for a year he permitted new presidential elections to be held on Nov. 8, 1931, which were rigged to ensure the oligarchy's continued control. He did not seek election himself but supported Gen. Agustín P. Justo, a participant of the 1930 coup.\n\nUrinson, Yakov (Moiseyevich) (b.

Helped by his family's relations with Gov. Francisco Ramírez, he entered political life in his native Entre Ríos province, and ultimately went to Buenos Aires as the agent of Gov. Pascual Echagüe. Becoming an ally of dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas, he was made a colonel in 1837 and replaced his patron Echagüe as governor of Entre Ríos in 1842. Forming an alliance with lesser provincial chieftains, he turned against Rosas in 1851 and defeated him in February 1852 at the Battle of Monte Caseros. In August 1852, as provisional director of Argentina, he called a constitutional congress at Santa Fe which in 1853 sanctioned a new constitution modeled on that of the United States. All provinces accepted the constitution except Buenos Aires, which refused to join the union until 1860. He was elected president for the term 1854-60, during which he opened Argentine ports to world trade and encouraged immigration and railways. After leaving the presidency he was made general of the army and resumed his post as governor of Entre Ríos (until 1864).

Oct. 30 [Oct. 17, O.S.], 1908, Samara, Russia - d. Dec. 20, 1984, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), Soviet politician. When in June 1941 Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Iosif Stalin appointed Ustinov people's commissar of armaments, and he retained the post as minister of armaments (1946-53) and minister of defense industries (1953-57). During the war he initiated the evacuation of the Soviet arms industry to beyond the Urals, out of the reach of the advancing German armies, and after the war he continued to build up the Soviet armed forces to rival those of the United States. A full member of the Central Committee from 1952, he was made a deputy premier, still with overall responsibility for the armaments industry, in 1957. In 1963 he became first deputy premier and chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy. In 1965 he was elected a secretary of the Central Committee with responsibilities for the military, defense industry, and security organs, and he became a candidate member of the Politburo. As such, he worked closely with Yury Andropov, who in 1967 became head of the KGB. In March 1976, he was made a full member of the Politburo; in April, after the death of Andrey Grechko, he was appointed defense minister; in July he was made a marshal of the Soviet Union. He played an important behind-the-scenes role in Soviet-U.S. arms limitation negotiations and was present at the 1979 Vienna summit at which the second strategic arms limitation talks (SALT II) agreement was signed by Leonid Brezhnev and U.S. president Jimmy Carter. Holding the defense portfolio until his death, his tenure saw Soviet forces invade Afghanistan in 1979 and shoot down a South Korean jetliner that strayed into Soviet airspace in 1983. On Brezhnev's death (1982) Ustinov was believed to have been the first to propose Andropov as his successor.\n\nV. Ustinov\n\nUstinov, Vladimir (Vasilyevich) (b.

Dec. 15, 1754, Maratta, Gobir [now in Nigeria] - d. April 20, 1817, Sokoto [now in Nigeria]), ruler of Sokoto (1804-17). About 1774 he began to travel throughout Kebbi and Gobir, in what is now northern Nigeria, teaching and preaching with the aim to purify Hausa society of un-Islamic practices. In 1786 he began a campaign in Zamfara. Throughout the 1780s and '90s the community that looked to him for leadership grew in size, much of the support coming from the peasantry whose oppression under the existing dynasties gave rise to millenarian hopes. Although he rejected any identification of himself with the Mahdi, the legendary Muslim redeemer, he encouraged the people's expectations. During the 1790s, a division developed between his community and the Gobir ruling dynasty, and his position at Degel seemed threatened. The Shehu (Sheikh), as Usuman was called, then departed to Gudu (Feb. 21, 1804) in what resembled the hijra of the prophet Muhammad. Elected imam by his followers, he began a jihad (holy war) and created a new Muslim state, Sokoto. The states of Katsina, Kano, Daura, and Zaria were conquered in the following years. When Alkalawa, the capital of Gobir, finally fell in October 1808, the military objectives of the jihad were substantially achieved. In 1812 he assigned responsibility for the western and eastern sectors of the empire, respectively, to his younger brother Abdullahi and his son Muhammadu Bello, and devoted his remaining years to scholarship. After his death, Bello became his main successor at Sokoto, while Abdullahi became emir of Gwandu.\n\nUteem\n\nUteem, Cassam (b.
