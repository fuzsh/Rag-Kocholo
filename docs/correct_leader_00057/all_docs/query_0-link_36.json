        "text": "In the 1989 general election for the House of Councillors, there was a total of 670 candidates – 385 from 40 parties under the proportional representative system and 285 candidates in the local electoral districts – an unprecedented number in polling for Councillors.\n\nThe central issues debated during the 18-day campaign were a new consumption tax, the Recruit financial scandal and the liberalization of agricultural products. Election results ushered in a new phase in Japanese politics: the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), suffered its worst setback at the polls since its founding in 1955, while the Socialist Party of Japan (JSP), led by Mrs. Takako Doi, took an enormous leap forward. Consequently, the opposition parties together occupied more Councillors’ seats than the ruling LDP. In particular, the JSP for the first time exceeded the LDP in the percentage of the votes cast under the proportional representation system. Altogether, 146 women candidates ran in the election, of whom 22 were successful, both of these numbers being records.\n\nGiven the overall polling results, Prime Minister Sosuke Uno resigned to take responsibility for the LDP defeat and in his place Mr. Toshiki Kaifu, also from LDP but a member of the House of Representatives, took office on 9 August 1989."
