        "text": "The house where the late Prime Minister Sosuke Uno was born in 1922 has been renovated into a mixed-use complex that includes a restaurant and community center.\n\nThe two-story home was bought from the Uno family by the municipal government in Moriyama, Shiga Prefecture, for the renovation.\n\nThe restaurant features Omi beef, a local speciality.\n\nUno was prime minister in 1989, serving only two months before a sex scandal played up by gossip magazines forced him out of office. This hasn't stopped local residents from considering the home an important asset.\n\n\"We'd like to use the house as a base to reinvigorate the town,\" a city official said."
