        "text": "TOKYO — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed Sunday to stay in office despite leading his scandal-stained ruling coalition to an unexpectedly severe and humiliating defeat in parliamentary elections.\n\nExit polls showed Abe's Liberal Democratic Party losing the majority it held with its coalition partner in the upper house, a stunning reversal of fortune for a ruling party that has controlled Japan virtually uninterrupted since 1955.\n\nThe leading opposition Democratic Party of Japan made huge gains, the exit polls showed.\n\nIt would be unusual for a prime minister to step down after an upper-house defeat, but calls for Abe's resignation from within the Liberal Democratic Party were expected to grow.\n\n\"I must push ahead with reforms and continue to fulfill my responsibilities as prime minister,\" he said at his party's headquarters. \"The responsibility for this utter defeat rests with me.\"\n\nHis ruling party maintains control of the lower chamber, which chooses the prime minister, and Abe dismissed opposition calls for an election for the lower house to test his mandate.\n\n\"The nation has spoken very clearly,\" Democratic Party of Japan leader Naoto Kan told reporters. \"Naturally, our sights are on the lower house and our final goal is a change in government.\"\n\nSunday's defeat was worse than expected for Abe. Exit polls by major television networks showed the LDP and its junior coalition partner, the New Komei Party, emerging with 102 seats — a 30-seat loss that left it far short of the 122 needed to control the house. The Democratic Party appeared set to win 112 seats, up from 83. Official results were not expected until early today local time.\n\nAbe's top lieutenant, party No. 2 Hidenao Nakagawa, said late Sunday he would step down to take responsibility for the party's setback.\n\n\"If the results are as projected, we have suffered an utter defeat,\" Nakagawa said hours after the polls closed.\n\nAbe took office in September as Japan's youngest-ever prime minister, promising to build a \"beautiful Japan,\" and won points for mending strained diplomatic ties with South Korea and China.\n\nBut his honeymoon was short-lived.\n\nIn the first in a series of scandals, Administrative Reform Minister Genichiro Sata stepped down in December over charges of misusing political funds. In May, Abe's agriculture minister killed himself amid allegations he also misused public money. The new agriculture minister became embroiled in another funds scandal.\n\nThe government was severely criticized again last month when Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma suggested the 1945 U.S. nuclear bombings of Japan were justified. Public outcry led to Kyuma's speedy departure.\n\nPerhaps the final straw for voters was Abe's brushing off warnings by the opposition late last year that pension records had been lost. That inaction came back to haunt him in the spring, when the full scope of the records losses emerged. Some 50 million claims had been wiped out.\n\n\"I don't like Abe or the LDP. I don't get the feeling things have gotten better,\" said Masayoshi Miyazaki, 58, a Tokyo retiree, after polls closed.\n\nParty officials said last week they would keep Abe no matter what happens, and resigning in the face of a heavy election defeat is rare, but not unprecedented.\n\nIn 1998, then-Prime Minster Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to step down after the Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of 121. Sousuke Uno lost his job as prime minister after winning only 36 seats in 1989. Abe himself resigned as secretary-general of the party in 2004, when the Liberal Democrats won 49 seats, two short of their goal.\n\nSome unconventional candidates from other parties also fared badly Sunday. Alberto Fujimori, the former Peruvian authoritarian leader; Yuko Tojo, the granddaughter of the executed wartime general who ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor; and the popular inventor Dr. Nakamats were all headed for defeat, according to projections.\n\nAssociated Press writers Chisaki Watanabe, Hans Greimel and Eric Talmadge contributed to this report."
