        "text": "Two\n\nThe Consequences of Constitutional Systems on Party Systems\n\nJih-wen Lin\n\nIs the Mixed-Member Majoritarian SystemCreating a Two-Party System?\n\nFor the competitors of a legislative election, winning a seat is only the first step toward sharing political power. How powers are distributed depends on the constitutional arrangement of executive-legislative relations, but studies on electoral systems are largely legislative-centric. An executive-centric theory of electoral systems plays an important role in filling this gap. Japan and Taiwan are perfect cases—they traveled a similar path of electoral reform but are distinguishable by constitutional systems. The following analysis explains why these two cases are worth comparing.\n\nThe first reason is the similarity of Japan and Taiwan compared with the global pattern. From a comparative perspective, the Asian model deserves special attention. As pointed out by Reilly (2007a, 2007b), the Asian experience is characterized by a decrease in proportionality, while the trend in the rest of the world is just the opposite.1 If an increase in proportionality results from the fragmentation of the party system, the best justification of the Asian model of electoral reform is the expectation of a more efficient and stable government. Indeed, the introduction of a majoritarian-leaning electoral system is likely to improve government stability as it will reduce the number of parties (Duverger 1964; Rae 1971; Lijphart and Grofman 1984). Another effect of a majoritarian-leaning electoral system is that it facilitates power turnover when an election is competitive: when only one winner is to be elected, a party gains no seats at all if it falls one vote short of the winning party. By creating a larger seat swing, a majoritarian-leaning system makes it easier for the voters to hold the ruling party accountable. Within the Asian model, Japan and Taiwan are good cases to compare.2 Both countries are in East Asia and are embedded in a political culture that emphasizes personal connections; both traveled down a similar path of electoral reform and saw a decrease in the number of parties.\n\nThe second reason is their difference in executive-legislative relations. As the dependent variable, small parties play a more important role in Japan than in Taiwan, and the effective number of parties in Taiwan is decreasing faster than it is in Japan (Jou 2009). We thus have two cases of the “most similar system design” to compare. The question is how to link the party system to the constitutional system, the independent variable of this chapter.\n\nAs Huang, Kuo, and Stockton detail in chapter 1, small parties—those that ranked third or lower in legislative elections—have fared far better in Japan than in Taiwan. There are some differences in the Japanese and Taiwanese mixed-member majoritarian (MMM) systems, but Huang, Kuo, and Stockton conclude that these variations cannot fully account for the differences in the fates of small parties in the two systems.\n\nThis chapter argues that the differing constitutional systems, not the differing electoral systems, are the most important source of the contrasting fates of small parties. If the electoral system determines the winning threshold of each electoral district, the rule of portfolio allocation specified by the constitution affects the incentive for legislators elected in different constituencies to join a national political party. The major hypothesis of this chapter is that MMM does make it harder for weaker candidates to win in each district, but whether the winners across all districts are from two parties still depends on how the executive offices are distributed. Given Japan’s parliamentary system, prime ministers are elected by the Diet. Legislators can thus bargain with the prime minister by threatening to defect from the ruling party—splinter parties are sometimes formed in these circumstances. In contrast, Taiwan’s executive offices are allocated by the president without legislative participation, giving legislators elected in different districts a strong motivation to stay in the national parties. Another complication is the legislative process: while Taiwan has a unicameral legislature, the Diet of Japan includes the House of Representatives (HR) and the House of Councillors (HC), with the latter mandated to approve the policy bills proposed by the prime minister. It has been pointed out that bicameralism—especially using different formulas to elect the delegates of the two chambers—strengthens the leverage of small parties because intercameral agreement is needed to adopt a bill (Hammond and Miller 1987; Riker 1992; Brennan and Hamlin 1992; Tsebelis and Money 1997; Heller 2001; Druckman and Thies 2002). The influence of Taiwan’s small parties on policy making is limited because its unicameral legislature does not give them the chance to reject government bills.\n\nHow the head of state, the head of government, and the legislature interact with each other in Taiwan and Japan is presented in table 2.1. It is clear that the major difference between the two constitutional systems is the rule of portfolio allocation: Taiwan’s premier and ministers are appointed by the president, the de facto supreme leader, without legislative participation; the Japanese prime minister is designated from among the members of the Diet by a resolution of the Diet before he appoints his cabinet ministers. Taiwan’s small parties have little role to play in the unicameral legislature, whereas Japan’s bicameralism gives large parties an incentive to include nonpivotal small parties as coalition partners so that the latter can help adopt the government bills in the upper house. How these constitutional systems are related to the number of parties will be discussed later.\n\nIn the next section, we will show how the role of political parties in portfolio allocation is defined by the constitutional system and how Riker’s size principle can be used to derive hypotheses. Sections three and four will examine how party politics interact with the constitutional systems of Taiwan and Japan, and how small parties have different capacities in the allocation of executive positions. Section five concludes by addressing the general implications of this study and how the number of parties may be affected by constitutional designs.\n\nTABLE 2.1. The Constitutional System in Taiwan and Japan Taiwan Japan\n\nThe Role of Political Parties in Portfolio Allocation in Different Constitutions\n\nPolitical parties coordinate both in elections and in the distribution of executive offices (Shugart 1995; Cox 1997; Hicken 2009). In elections, the electoral system is the key determinant of what a party can do. If an electoral system requires the candidates nominated by the same party to compete for the same set of voters, the party should nominate an optimal number of candidates; if a party nominates only one candidate, coordination should take place before the election starts. Thus, the shift from SNTV to MMM marks a great transformation in the electoral roles of parties. Even so, maximizing its presence in the legislature is just the first kind of coordination work a party has to undertake. Once elected, legislators have to think about how to make the best use of their influence over portfolio allocation, which is the real goal of many politicians. In democracies, portfolio allocation is an important way to make policy changes (Budge and Laver 1986). Since the number of ministerial positions to be distributed is fixed, the “minimal winning coalition” principle holds: every member in the winning coalition should make itself pivotal, so that each can maximize its share of the portfolios, hence its influence over the policies to be implemented by the ministry (Riker 1962). This principle implies that the size of the coalition and the parties in it should both be minimal because unnecessary members will reduce the share each can get.\n\nThe constitutional system defines what a minimal winning coalition is. The Japanese constitution makes every party a potential pivot. The highest executive power is held by the prime minister, who is designated by both chambers of the Diet—with the HR playing the decisive role—and then formally appointed by the emperor.3 The power of Japan’s small parties is enhanced by its bicameralism in two ways. First, it is easier for a small party to win a seat in the HC elections because the electoral system mixes 48 national PR seats with 73 SNTV seats. Second, Japan’s bicameralism is almost symmetric because the HC can veto most bills proposed by the prime minister, which will in turn put the prime minister’s leadership at stake. Small parties can thus exchange their legislative veto power for political resources. Nevertheless, Japanese prime ministers do not always want to invite small parties to join their cabinets because of a trade-off between policy making and portfolio allocation. The prime minister can compromise with the small parties without allocating any position to their members. Whether a small party wishes to join the cabinet also depends on how much the prime minister needs its support to pass legislation.\n\nTaiwan’s constitutional system arranges the allocation of ministerial positions differently. Taiwan’s premier is appointed unilaterally by the popularly elected president, leaving no role for the political parties to play. According to the constitution, cabinet ministers are selected by the premier, but, in practice, they are handpicked by the president. Although the legislators can launch a censure motion against the premier by rallying majority support, such a move is quite unlikely because it will put the jobs of the legislators at risk. What the president has to keep in mind is whether the legislature is controlled by an opposition majority. If this is the case, the legislators may use their veto power to prevent government bills from being adopted.\n\nAnother concern is the electoral system. Under SNTV, major parties nominate multiple candidates in most districts, the legislators tend to deliver resources to a particular group of voters, and the parties are usually factionalized. Particularist distribution of government resources is prevalent in both MMM and SNTV, but the targets of the pork may differ. It is quite common for single-member district systems to encourage pork-barrel bills targeting the undecided voters in the competitive districts rather than just a particular set of constituents. Moreover, legislators elected under MMM are supposed to represent the whole constituency, giving them the incentive to choose policy stances different from those of the central government. A shift from SNTV to MMM thus decreases the incentives for internal factionalization. Nevertheless, there is a major difference between Taiwan and Japan. In Taiwan, the directly elected president creates more pressure for Taiwanese legislators to align their campaign appeals with a major national party, but Japanese legislators are freer to tailor their messages to the local district, perhaps even to the point of representing a third party.\n\nWe can now hypothesize how the partisan composition of the Taiwanese and Japanese cabinets is affected by their respective constitutional systems. First, Taiwan does not have a tradition of coalition government, and political parties have a limited influence on cabinet formation. This affects both big parties and small parties. Small parties should be shut out of the cabinet almost entirely. However, this does not mean that members of the president’s party will monopolize all seats in the cabinet. The president can appoint ministers as he sees fit, and he may choose to appoint a significant number of nonpartisan figures to the cabinet. Tavits (2008, 43) has argued that directly elected presidents have a preference to name nonpartisan ministers to demonstrate their status as the head of state.4 The incentive to appoint nonpartisan ministers is particularly strong when the president is leading a minority party. Rather than opting for a single-party minority cabinet, which might cause gridlock, or a multiparty majority cabinet, which might weaken the president’s leadership, the president may prefer to appoint nonpartisan ministers to depoliticize the cabinet and convey the image of the president as leader of the entire country. Critically, while nonpartisan ministers may help the president dampen opposition from other parties in the legislature or appeal to a wider segment of the electorate, they are not representatives of or responsible to opposition parties. Alternatively, if the primary threat to the president’s power comes from factions within his own majority party, he may be more likely to emphasize his role as head of the party and prefer to appoint fewer nonpartisan ministers. The percentage of nonpartisan ministers can thus give clues to the influence of the president on cabinet formation.\n\nIn sum, there is no need to test the number of parties in Taiwan’s cabinets, because ministers are predominantly from the president’s party or nonpartisans.5 Rather, nonpartisan ministers play a much more important role in highlighting the president’s role in ministerial appointment. Thus, we expect that, in Taiwan, the percentage of nonpartisan ministers is higher (1) in divided government than in unified government and (2) when MMM is the electoral system than when SNTV was used.\n\nSecond, political parties in Japan should exercise a greater influence on cabinet formation than their Taiwanese counterparts, for the Constitution of Japan requires the prime ministers to be elected by members of the Diet. Since most cabinet ministers are concurrently legislators, we can examine how the number of parties in the cabinet can be explained by the key variables.6 The number of parties in the cabinet should increase when the cabinet is not in control of the upper house. Further, if MMM accelerates the turnover of parties in power, prime ministers should have less confidence that they will be able to maintain a majority in the HC. Thus, we expect the number of parties in the cabinet to rise after electoral reform. The logic behind these hypotheses is that the bargaining power of small parties is increased if the probability of the prime minister encountering bicameral deadlock becomes higher. The second test operationalizes the prime minister’s influence in cabinet formation in a slightly different way. We expect the percentage of ministers from the prime minister’s party to decrease when the party of most cabinet members does not hold the upper house majority or when MMM is used, because these factors will weaken the leadership of the prime minister for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe difference in constitutional systems permeates other political arenas. If legislators play different roles in the allocation of executive offices, the voters’ expectations of them should also diverge. Taiwan’s legislative elections have become highly presidentialized and focus on the debate over national identity issues between the two largest parties. MMM reduces Taiwan’s effective number of parties to less than two because the number of presidential candidates is usually two. Japan lacks a centralized national leader, and legislative candidates can compete on constituency issues, some of which may be related to the national division among the political parties while others are local in focus. Since the constituency cleavage plays an important role in Japan, we expect the effective number of parties to be higher than in Taiwan.\n\nWhat we see above are theoretical models with rich empirical implications. In the next two sections, we will demonstrate how the constitutional system affects the portfolio allocation in the two cases, and therefore the number and power of small parties. We will discuss Taiwan first because the evolution of its party system shows clearly the power of the constitutional system despite the intervening variables that a young democracy usually faces.\n\nHow Taiwan’s Unicameral Semipresidential System Intermediates the Impact of Electoral Reform\n\nTo validate the claim that MMM has reduced the number of parties but variations in the constitutional system give political parties different roles to play, this section will describe how Taiwan’s unicameral semipresidential constitution has strongly depressed the influence of political parties on cabinet formation and given the president a great deal of freedom to fill executive offices.\n\nTaiwan’s constitution is parliamentary by design but highly presidential in practice.7 The seven constitutional reforms enacted since 1991 endeavored to make the president’s de facto powers constitutional by stipulating a popularly elected president; they further enhanced the president’s power by removing the Legislative Yuan’s power to confirm the presidential appointment of the premier. The Legislative Yuan can pass a vote of no confidence in the premier but the premier cannot initiate a snap election (Lin 2011).8 Before 2000, executive congruency gave the president the power to dismiss the premier, making Taiwan a president-parliamentary regime (Shugart and Carey 1992; Shugart 2005). The president dominated the appointment of the premier even when the government was divided (2000–2008). Based on this practice, no popularly elected president has consulted the legislature when appointing a premier or his cabinet ministers.\n\nBy this design, the president appoints and dismisses the cabinet ministers with the latter’s accountability to the legislature in mind. The ways in which the legislators hold the cabinet accountable include a vote of no confidence—which is rarely considered—and the blocking of executive proposals—which is often applied. When explaining the president’s decision in portfolio allocation, MMM is also an important factor because the majorities represented by the president in the whole nation and the legislators in the MMM districts may be incongruent. To ease the pressure from MMM and opposition parties, we expect the percentage of nonpartisan ministers in the cabinet to follow this order: MMM plus divided government > SNTV plus divided government > MMM plus unified government > SNTV plus unified government. We do not make the number of parties in the cabinet as a variable because the cabinets are predominantly composed of the president’s party and nonpartisans rather than the nonpresidential parties.\n\nGiven the limited influence of Taiwan’s small parties on cabinet formation, we will directly examine how the aforementioned variables affect the president’s role in portfolio allocation. Table 2.2 shows how much the president dominates cabinet formation by the percentage of ministers from his party.9 Counting the change in electoral systems and the president’s majority status, the data include several possible divisions, with the “MMM plus divided government” type thus far absent. Since the percentage is a continuous variable and the independent variables are categorical, we run a one-way ANOVA by the following groupings: (1) whether a president leads a unified or a divided government, (2) electoral systems, and (3) the three presidential periods. For (3), a reasonable hypothesis is that President Lee Teng-hui had the highest percentage of ministers from his own party because he led a unified government with legislators elected under SNTV; the lowest percentage should be found under the Chen Shui-bian presidency, as Chen never assembled a majority cabinet, especially when the Kuomintang (KMT) dominated the Legislative Yuan. Standing in between, Ma Ying-jeou’s strategy represents the presidentialized unified government that MMM produces.\n\nThe results in table 2.3 validate the hypotheses. Overall, the average percentage of ministers from the president’s party is 58.55. If the percentages of ministers from the president’s party are compared according to whether the president controls the legislative majority or not, the “yes” and the “no” groups have an average of 72.3% and 44.1%, respectively. It is evident that divided government forced President Chen to appoint more nonpartisan ministers to water down the cabinet’s DPP makeup so as to decrease the likelihood of his policies being rejected by the Legislative Yuan. If the data are compared according to the electoral system, the “SNTV” group has 61.6% and the “MMM” group has 49.4% on average. Finally, if the average percentages for the three presidents are compared, the “Lee period” is 96.6, the “Chen period” is 44.1, and the “Ma period” is 49.4. All one-way ANOVA tests show the expected sign, and the differences between the three presidents are not only statistically significant but also larger than the other two comparisons.10\n\nThe cabinets headed by premiers appointed by President Ma are a salient illustration of the dominance of the president—as the head of state rather than the chairperson of the ruling party—in cabinet formation. Ma’s KMT has held a clear majority of legislative seats throughout his two terms in office. However, table 2.3 shows that the percentage of ministers from the president’s party, already low in 2008 compared to those of President Lee, has further decreased in the intervening years.11 Ma’s preference for appointing nonpartisan scholars and civil servants as ministers reflects his ambivalence regarding the partisan composition of the cabinet. Given the KMT’s dominance in the legislature, Ma must have minimized the role of political parties when forming his cabinets.\n\nTABLE 2.2. Partisan Profile of Taiwan’s Cabinet Ministers President Party Premier Premier party Term begins Ministers from president’s party Whether largest party controls majority (= 1)\n\nThe strong influence of the president on portfolio allocation extends to elections. Two effects can be observed. The first is that Taiwan’s presidential elections may have a contamination effect on legislative elections.12 If the two elections are held concurrently or within a short period of time, voters may use information from the highly prominent presidential race to make their decisions in the less salient legislative race. Since the presidential race encourages supporters of small parties to vote strategically, they may apply the same logic to legislative elections regardless of the strength of the small party’s local candidate. Presidential elections thus intensify the Duvergerian obstacles13 facing small parties in district elections. The second effect concerns cleavage structure. Campaigning dominated by the presidential race will restrain the capacity of small parties to articulate their favorite issues. In Taiwan, small parties are forced to stand with a particular camp first of all and then distance themselves from that camp’s leading presidential candidate. In the legislative election of 2012, James Soong, the leader of the People First Party, was the only presidential candidate who claimed that Taiwan should eventually be reunified with the mainland. The Taiwan Solidarity Union, at the opposite extreme, was quite insistent that Taiwan’s independent sovereignty should not be infringed upon. So the two small parties could be clearly identified by their positions on national identity. That helped these small parties to consolidate their PR seats, but the overall effect was limited. What MMM does is to sharply decrease the influence of the small parties when the campaign issues are set by the large parties.\n\nTABLE 2.3.

When compared with Taiwan, Japan’s cabinet formation is dominated by legislative parties, giving electoral systems a more important role to play. We expect to see that the number of parties in the cabinet increases and the percentage of ministers coming from the prime minister’s party decreases after MMM is introduced, especially if the cabinet does not hold the majority of seats in the HC.\n\nA review of Japan’s Constitution will be helpful here. Japan’s prime minister shall be designated by the Diet before he appoints the cabinet ministers. According to Article 67 of the Constitution, disagreement between the two chambers about the designation of the prime minister is eventually determined by the HR. According to Article 69, the HR can pass a resolution of nonconfidence in the prime minister or reject a confidence motion proposed by the latter—after which the prime minister must resign—but the prime minister can also actively dissolve the HR and call for an early election. No such relationship exists between the prime minister and the HC, but the latter can veto bills passed by the HR—except prime minister designation, treaty, and budgetary bills—unless the government can pass them a second time by a two-thirds majority in the HR.\n\nIn sum, Japan’s bicameral parliamentary system strengthens the bargaining power of the small parties when the prime minister’s party is unable to control the HC. Small parties can win seats in the HC and boycott government bills even if they are weak in the HR. Since MMM tends to create larger seat swings in the elections of the HR, the prime minister becomes less confident that he will control the majorities of both chambers. Nevertheless, it is optional whether the prime minister will expand the coalition to control the majority of the HC, for reasons already explained in the theoretical section.\n\nWe use Japan’s portfolio allocation to test the hypotheses concerning the role of the small parties. Table 2.4 displays the partisan composition of Japan’s cabinets, including the percentage of ministers from the prime minister’s party and the number of parties (nonpartisan included) in the cabinets. When determining the size of the cabinet, the denominator is the number of ministers rather than their positions because a minister may concurrently hold more than one position. Note that we do not count control of the HC before 1955 because that period saw a tumultuous realignment of Japan’s party system, making it difficult to measure the partisan composition of the cabinets. We should also focus on cabinets formed by prime ministers heading the largest party, otherwise the coalition governments will by nature be oversized.\n\nWe will use the screened data to display the role of the small parties. Since the dependent variable is continuous, we run two parts of a one-way ANOVA to test if the means are different as a result of the categories we choose. The first hypothesis is to see whether the number of parties in the Japanese cabinet varies by whether (1) the cabinet parties hold the majority of seats of the HC and (2) the electoral system for the HR is MMM. For the second part of the hypotheses, we will use the same categories to test how much the average percentage of ministers coming from the prime minister’s party makes a difference. This is the opposite dimension of a similar variable.\n\nThe empirical data are shown in tables 2.5a and 2.5b. The results largely confirm our expectation. What we see from the first half of table 2.5a is that the number of small parties in the cabinet goes up when the cabinet fails to have continuous control of the upper house. The implied message is interesting: the more the cabinet is unable to control the upper house, the greater the bargaining power of the small parties because they can threaten the prime minister and boycott his policy bills. By the same logic, the small parties lose their pivotal positions if the ruling party can unilaterally control the two chambers. The second half of table 2.5a delivers a similar message in an even clearer way. Under SNTV, the prime ministers would leave a countable number of positions for the nonpartisans rather than for the small parties because the latter are dispensable.14 The adoption of MMM changed the strategy of portfolio allocation because the fear of losing power in an MMM race made the collaboration with some small parties inevitable, even if the number of the nonpartisan ministers remains the same. The underlying cause is that a majoritarian-leaning electoral system like MMM renders the undecided voters decisive and compels the prime minister to be mindful of the parties representing their interests.\n\nFor the second part of the hypothesis, we use the percentage of ministers from the prime minister’s party to test the effects of the same set of variables. Note that Japan’s parliamentary rule requires the prime ministers to be elected by the Diet, with the HR playing the decisive role. The denominator is therefore “the ministers from the parties of the prime minister and the small parties in the cabinet.” The average percentage of ministers from the prime minister’s party when the cabinet has continuous control of the upper house is 92.9%, which is higher than the 89.1% when it lacks continuous control. This result suggests an interesting dynamic: the prime minster’s influence on cabinet formation declines when the cabinet fails to control the upper house. A likely cause is that bicameral deadlock weakens the prime minister’s position in his cabinet. If so, electoral reform should have a significant impact because MMM is supposed to promote policy debates among political parties. Indeed, 95.3% of the ministers are from the prime minister’s party when SNTV is used; this is reduced to 82.4% after MMM is introduced. In this sense, electoral reform enhances the bargaining power of the small parties on policy making even though their representatives are reduced in number.\n\nTABLE 2.4. Partisan Profile of Japan’s Cabinet Ministers Prime minister PM’s party Term begins Number of non-PM parties Ministers from PM’s party Cabinet always controls HC MMM\n\nTABLE 2.5a. One-Way ANOVA for the Number of Coalition Parties in Japan’s Cabinets Mean Variance Sig.\n\nTABLE 2.5b. One-Way ANOVA for the Ratio of Ministers from PM’s Party in Japan’s Cabinets Mean Variance Sig.\n\nTo highlight the growing influence of Japan’s small parties, consider the example of the cabinet organized by Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama (2009–10). Hatoyama’s Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) gained 308 of the 480 seats (64.17%) in the HR election of 2009 but still invited the heads of two small parties to join his cabinet: Shizuka Kamei from the People’s New Party (PNP) as the minister of state for financial services and minister of state for postal reform, and Mizuho Fukushima from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as the minister of state for consumer affairs and food safety, social affairs, and gender equality. Especially noteworthy is Fukushima, who was a member of the HC at that time. The DPJ chose to offer cabinet positions to the two smaller parties and they chose to accept them because there was a degree of policy congruence among the three parties, making it easier for them to garner support from the upper house to form a temporary majority. However, the alliance was fragile, and Fukushima resigned her position in 2010 over the issue of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.15 When the degree of policy congruence was high, the SDP was able to use its position in the upper house to win a cabinet seat; when the degree of policy congruence decreased, the SDP decided to withdraw from the cabinet and dampen the credibility of the Hatoyama cabinet. Thus this example neatly illustrates the opportunities small parties are afforded in Japan’s constitutional system as well as the trade-offs among cabinet portfolios, policy positions, and support in the parliament that large parties much consider.\n\nJapan’s party system is further fragmented by its parliamentary elections. Because Japan lacks a central leader, MMM reduces the differences between political parties and gives some politicians a reason to establish their own parties. For many voters, the party platforms are intangible—at least more intangible than real politicians—and contenders in each constituency tend to embody their ideas through their personal image or social connections. One trend has been the formation of small parties by politicians who are not very different from their fellows in the parties from which they originated. Such a trend is further endogenized by the fact that the new electoral system is conducive to regime turnover (at the national and local levels). This helps explain why some local potentates have an incentive to defect from their parties as long as they have a chance of winning the seat. Thus, the lack of a centralized leader makes some small parties powerful enough to grab the SMP seats.\n\nNevertheless, MMM is not exactly an SMP system: the latter gives electoral contenders much less motivation to build their own parties, whereas the former creates contamination effects that small parties can utilize to gain some seats. Taiwan also adopted MMM, but the role of its small parties is much less salient than that of small parties in Japan. As we have seen, this difference cannot be fully accounted for by the design of the electoral system. It is the constitutional system that explains the varying amounts of bargaining power of the small parties.\n\nConclusion\n\nFew topics can be studied as rigorously and fruitfully as those concerning electoral systems. Concepts like the threshold of winning and effective number of parties apply to all electoral systems and are well recognized in the literature. MMM, by giving priority to single-member district competitions, is expected to decrease the number of parties. This expectation finds support in Japan and Taiwan, both of which shifted their electoral systems from SNTV to the majoritarian-leaning MMM systems. Although the effective number of parties is smaller when measured in relative terms, the absolute number of parties in Japan is always higher than that of Taiwan, leaving a puzzle to be explained.\n\nThis chapter takes an executive-centered approach to answer this puzzle. A theory of portfolio allocation suggests that a constitutional system instituted with more players who can veto the appointment of the head of government, and hence portfolio allocation, makes small parties more influential. Exogenously imposed, the rule of portfolio allocation gives small parties an endogenous interest in breaking away from the large parties in and after the legislative election. This theory explains why Japan’s bicameral parliamentary system creates bargaining power for Japan’s small parties, and why Taiwan’s unicameral semipresidential system makes the small parties much less effective than the president when executive offices are to be arranged. Furthermore, Japan’s parliamentary system gives some electoral competitors the justification to run a campaign at the district level because the party platform is less visible than a real candidate. The chances of Japan’s small parties receiving seats are thus higher than those of their counterparts in Taiwan.\n\nThe partisan composition of cabinets in Taiwan and Japan corroborates this argument. For Taiwan, we expect the percentage of nonpartisan ministers to be increased by MMM and the president’s inability to control the Legislative Yuan, for both will increase the likelihood of the executive proposals being rejected, and nonpartisan ministers can buffer such pressure. The one-way ANOVA dividing the data by three Taiwanese presidents offers a significant count of the percentages of nonpartisan ministers. That is, Taiwan’s constitutional system makes the president the paramount leader subject to the different degrees of legislative distrust of the executive officers, for which electoral reform plays an important role. Small parties are almost entirely cut out of cabinet positions, as the semipresidential system denies them any opportunity to negotiate for ministerial posts. In Japan’s parliamentary system, the HR approves the appointment of the prime minister and the HC can veto most policy bills. Since the prime minister should receive majority support from the HR, whether the cabinet also controls the HC becomes a major determinant of the cabinet’s partisan composition. We expect the number of parties in the cabinet to increase and the percentage of ministers from the prime minister’s party to decline when the cabinet fails to control the upper house majority. If MMM reduces factionalism and speeds up power transitions, we expect the electoral reform to increase the number of parties in the cabinet and decrease the percentages of ministers from the prime minister’s party. These hypotheses are confirmed, and the effects of MMM are especially impressive.\n\nComparing the partisan compositions of the cabinets of the two countries, we find Japan to have far more ministers from the prime minister’s party than Taiwan has ministers from the president’s party. The weights of the other parties are high in Japan while Taiwan’s president tends to fill the executive positions by selecting ministers without partisanship or those from his party instead of parties with similar ideologies. This result supports the theory of portfolio allocation.\n\nTaiwan and Japan are specific cases with general implications. We can make a further generalization by considering the two extreme possibilities: (1) a unicameral presidential system where the president heads the government and is the only agent responsible for portfolio allocation, and (2) a multichamber parliamentary system where the appointment of ministers has to be agreed to by the political parties in all chambers. In the first case, the number of nonpartisan ministers should be high; in the latter, political parties play decisive roles in cabinet formation and the number of ministers from the prime minister’s party depends on to what extent the prime minister controls the chambers. What electoral reform does is to alter the number of parties the political leader can choose from rather than the rules regulating portfolio allocation. That is why we need to consider the electoral system and the constitutional system together to explain a country’s party system.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences"
