        "text": "THIRD BRAKING LIGHT … will be mandated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for ’86 models. The third brake light, which would be mounted near the base of the rear window, would be at eye level for the driver of a following car and would be visible to the driver of a third car through the window of the second. DOT cited taxi and telephone company car studies showing 50 to 58 percent reductions in rear-end collisions with the additional brake light. Auto makers have resisted the regulation since it was first proposed in January of ’81 on grounds of cost and installation location. The safety agency said, however, that the design and construction of the device would cost about $4 per newly designed vehicle.\n\nJAPAN WANTS 1.9 MILLION … in contrast to the 1.8 million limit on imports for the ’84 model year that the White House in proposing. Japan’s Trade Minister Sosuke Uno recently conveyed his government’s willingness to accept the 1.9-million mark, saying they can’t go any lower than that because of the need to accommodate product intended for the U.S. produced by manufacturers such as Isuzu and Suzuki. Stateside, GM wants the current 1,680,000 ceiling, which expires March 30, raised to accommodate the 280,000 cars it plans to import from its Japanese affiliates. A hike to 1.9 million, however, would give little room for GM’s domestic competition.\n\nILLEGAL RENTAL DISCRIMINATION … has been charged against car rental operators in New York state. A report compiled by the office of state Attorney General Robert Abrams alleges that 95 percent of companies illegally discriminated against young drivers. Abrams comments that out of 77 rental firms surveyed, 68 set minimum age requirements above 18 years, 14 refused to rent to customers without credit cards, while 35 set unlawful conditions for cash rentals, with some insisting on a cash deposit that equaled the full value of the car rented. According to Abrams, the car rental operators engaging in illegal discrimination included small independents as well as major rental operators.\n\nCHRYSLER CONSIDERS FOREIGN VENTURE … M.J. Closs, president of Chrysler of Canada, Ltd., commented recently that if the GM-Toyota joint venture is approved, Chrysler may set up a Japan/Europe/Chrysler venture to produce small cars. Chrysler owns 15 percent of Mistubishi and imported 100,000 Mistubishi-manufactured cars and 33,000 trucks in ’82. As to a European connection, Chrysler not only has a 15 percent equity in Peugeot but also recently purchased Volkswagen’s idle Sterling Heights, MI, plant.\n\nEPA’S TOP 10 … fuel efficiency ratings list five U.S. –produced autos among the top 10. Although Japanese cars still captured the top three slots, domestic autos made a stronger showing than in previous years. Domestics achieved an overall average of 25.6 mpg, about two miles per gallon lower than the ’83 model average. The top ’84 domestic in mpg is the ’84 Volkswagen Rabbit diesel (47 mpg), followed closely by diesel versions of the Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx (46 mpg). Ford Motor Co. netted eight out of the top 12 domestic spots.\n\nAUTO SALES SOAR … during mid-October ’84 introductions registering sales’ advances of 41.1 percent over last year’s figures. U.S. auto makers reported 235,334 auto sales during the October 11 to 22 period. The daily sales rate of 26,148 was the highest mark since ’79, whereas last year’s figures were the lowest in 24 years. Sales figures for the second 10 days in October were: 143,368 for GM, a 46.1 percent increase over a comparable period last year; 55,658 for Ford, a 36.0 percent increase; 27,175 for Chryser, a 23.5 percent increase; 4,800 for AMC, a 41.2 percent increase; and 2,567 for VWoA, a 10.7 percent increase.\n\nSENATOR DURENBERGER’S OFFICE REPORTS … that S. 1161, which Durenberger introduced last summer, aims at establishing the tax status of both retail and consumer leases containing terminal rental adjustment clauses (TRAC), also known as open-end leases. Proponents of the comprehensive Tax Deficit Reduction bill, which was recently in the Finance Committee for mark-up, are hoping for a vote before November 18.\n\nSHORT TAKES … Xerox fleet manager Ron Pink is making a definite commitment to the new garageable vans and reports that he is ordering between 1,200 and 1,500 of the Chrysler T-wagons, scheduled for delivery in April and May after being converted by Midway Truck and Coach in Elkhart, IN. Pink is also ordering 1,200 to 1,500 Ford E150s and 900 to 1,200 Chevrolet Celebrity wagons. Looking toward the future, Pink says, “Within three years we will have an all-van fleet.”"
