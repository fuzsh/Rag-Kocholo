1) I would like to point you to a dataset and an API that provides IMDB information.

Here are some queries to get the information from your example, and to show you what kind of data to expect from the dumps.

Get the imdb_id (generic) of a movie, given the movie's name:

You can either query for that information like shown or download one of:

a) The entire Unigraph datadump

b) a slightly smaller subset comprising of only:

Wikidata

Freebase

Geonames

OurAirports and

EDGAR data

You can read more about the dumps and their structure here.

The IMDB arrives through Wikidata and Freebase, not through IMDB directly.

As for the url on the site, if it is not part of the url: [] in the response you will have to append it like so: http://www.imdb.com/title/ + imdb_id (provided the id starts with "tt" (for movie).

2) Actors with birth dates, again you might have to append the url. This time like so: http://www.imdb.com/name/ + imdb_id

Hope this answers your question.
