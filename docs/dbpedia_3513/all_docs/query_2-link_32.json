        "text": "Film by Mark Waters\n\nMother of the BrideDirected byMark WatersWritten byRobin BernheimProduced byBrad KrevoyStarringCinematographyEd WuEdited byTravis SittardMusic byCaroline Ho\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed byNetflix\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n90 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish\n\nMother of the Bride is a 2024 American romantic comedy film directed by Mark Waters and written by Robin Bernheim. It stars Brooke Shields, Miranda Cosgrove, Sean Teale, Chad Michael Murray, Rachael Harris, and Benjamin Bratt.\n\nAfter a year abroad in London, Emma returns home and stuns her mother Lana with the news that she's getting married in a month at a resort in Phuket, Thailand. Things get worse when Lana discovers that the husband-to-be RJ is the son of Will, the man who broke her heart years earlier.\n\nThe film was released on Netflix on May 9, 2024.\n\nAfter a year working for Discovery Resorts in London, Emma Winslow's boyfriend RJ surprises her with a proposal. She happily accepts, but is concerned about her mother Lana's reaction as it's been just the two of them since her father died when she was only eight.\n\nIn San Francisco, Lana Winslow heads a medical research lab. Emma returns home and announces that, rather than go to grad school or find a job, she's going to run her own business. She'll be receiving a 6-figure-sponsorship in exchange for promoting Discovery. Emma then stuns Lana with the news that she's getting married in a month at a resort in Phuket, Thailand. Once she convinces her mother that she's sure, Lana insists that she's happy for her. Discovery is footing the bill, in exchange for publicity for the resort.\n\nArriving in Thailand are Lana's best friend Janice, as well as their friends from Stanford, Scott and Clay, who've recently married. Lana soon discovers that RJ is the son of Will Jackson, Scott's brother and her ex-boyfriend also from Stanford.\n\nBefore having dinner with Emma, RJ, and Will, Lana goes to the bathroom to 'freshen up', and Emma follows, where Lana explains to her that Will ghosted her after graduation. Devastated, Lana changed her number and moved so he couldn't hurt her again. A geneticist, she fears RJ will do the same to Emma, but Emma reassures her he won’t. Back at the table, Lana and Will agree to be maid-of-honor and best man, then RJ thanks Lana for her gift of a cappuccino maker. Will gifts them his condo in Tribeca. Lana later confides to Janice that she fears she can't compete with him.\n\nDiscovery brand manager Camala doesn't want Lana's input for most of the wedding planning, as they are pushing certain brands and designers.\n\nJanice gets Lana a date with LA doctor Lucas Campion when he helps Will out after Lana accidentally hits his private parts while playing pickleball with their Stanford crew. However, Lana doesn't stay for very long during the date. The next day, Camala shows Lana the flamboyant, black designer dress she is to wear in the wedding. She reluctantly agrees to it, feeling the brand manager is taking away the joy of the wedding by imposing plans to make it into an event.\n\nAs Lana isn't included in that day's wedding plan, she and the Stanford group head out to a secluded island and go skinny dipping. As it's prohibited on hotel property, they get reprimanded. Camala threatens to pull funding for the wedding, so Emma accuses Lana of intentionally undermining the wedding and tells her to leave.\n\nWill overhears, so he takes Lana on a ride to cheer her up. The jeep they take to the remote spot fails to start for their return, so they head down to the nearest beach to flag down a boat. There, they finally talk about their past and make peace.\n\nAs Emma regrets scolding Lana, RJ suggests she apologize. Realizing Will and Lana are missing, a resort employee goes to fetch them via boat. They are disrupted just before they can kiss. On their return to the hotel, Lucas sees Will and Lana looking cozy together. So, he asks her to call if things don't work out with Will, and Lana reconciles with Emma. Emma then tells Camala that from now on, the wedding is going to run her way. At the rehearsal dinner, Lana overhears Will talking to a woman named Katrina on the phone, saying he cannot live without her. Feeling déjà vu, she immediately distances herself from him.\n\nEmma feels there is something off about her mother, so she goes to her room. They talk, and Emma falls asleep next to her.\n\nThe next day, although Lana becomes overwhelmed and cries, the wedding ceremony runs smoothly. When Emma throws the bouquet, Lana dodges it but Will catches it for her. Confronting Lana, Will demands to know why she's been ignoring him. She asks him about Katrina and he reveals that she is his secretary, who's brought the ring he'd bought for Lana many years ago. Will proposes and, after a moment's hesitation, she happily accepts.\n\nIn February 2023, Netflix announced a romantic comedy film written by Robin Bernheim and to be directed by Mark Waters was in pre-production. Brooke Shields, Miranda Cosgrove, Benjamin Bratt, Chad Michael Murray, Rachael Harris, Sean Teale, Wilson Cruz, Michael McDonald, Tasneem Roc, and Dalip Sondhi were added to the cast.[1][2] Principal photography began in April 2023 in Phuket, Thailand.[3][4]\n\nMother of the Bride was released on Netflix on May 9, 2024.[5]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 13% of 46 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.3/10.[6] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[7]\n\nBenjamin Lee from The Guardian scored the film a two out of five, writing \"It's a slight cut above just how very bad these things can get, but not enough to edge it toward something that would deserve your full attention. So errand away, Mother of the Bride will be just fine playing in the background\".[8] Jennifer Green reviewing for Common Sense Media gave the film a score of three out of five.[9]"
