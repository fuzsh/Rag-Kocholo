        "text": "Characters & Voice Actors\n\nStaff\n\nEdit\n\nOpening Theme\n\n1: \"abnormalize\" by Ling Tosite Sigure (凛として時雨) (eps 1-11) 2: \"Out of Control\" by Nothing's Carved in Stone (eps 12-22)\n\nEpisode Videos\n\nReviews\n\nLelouch-Suzuki and Light-L are unmatched when it comes to anime rivalries but Kougami-Makishima can definetly make a good case for that third place. Which is kinda like being third behind Ronaldo/Messi during their golden era so thats a very respectable bronze medal.\n\nWhile thats the high point of the show it does have alot other good going for it. Overall a very strong and likeable cast of characters. Original OST is great and great OP/Endings. Interesting world. Good mix of action. Drama philosophy. Politics. Its always serious. A more mature show.\n\nIneven enjoyed the second season which got somewhat mixed reactions. But no doubt first ... season is king.\n\nIts a shame though the show completely falls apart after that changing all characters. Longer episodes. Its weird when they had such a good thing going.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nMeh 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nGoing in, I was quite excited to finally watch Psycho-pass. I knew it was a very popular show at one point and was looking forward to checking out a sci-fi seinen anime.\n\nUnfortunately, Psycho pass is held back by bland characters and pretentious writing. Too many minutes in this show consist of long winded rants about the world that just become boring and irritating as the show goes on. On top of that, there is a real lack of ‘entertainment value’ from the plot as you are essentially watching a slow detective show with a sci-fi skin.\n\nThat said, the show has very nice ... visuals, some effective world building and a great soundtrack. The voice acting for the dub is also excellent.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn’t recommend Psycho pass but I can see the appeal.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nOmg, this is so bad. Equilibrium meets Minority Report with a dash of Demolition Man, seasoned with Judge Dredd. But all the good stuff - cool action, humanism, soul, badassery, and self-aware humor - has been cut out.\n\nWhy must there be other ingredients? Why not just leave the psycho-pass alone in its bleak sci-fi pseudo-intelligent jerk circle? Bc all the movies mentioned above (and PP too) have nothing deep in their world-building, they are not a Brave New World on screen, they are dystopian backgrounds for filmmakers to have fun with. And I, as a viewer, had fun with Dredd or Equilibrium because I ... was entertained enough not to start asking questions about how everything works.\n\nPsycho-pass takes a different path, challenging the viewer's intelligence and boredom. The characters are walking-talking boring clichés: naive doe-eyed idiot female plank of wood with golden heart + badass bad boy plank of wood with tendencies to harass the viewer with infodumps of high moral bullshit. As for the supporting cast, I can only remember the cheap Colombo guy - he has a glimpse of a human being.\n\nAll the characters are just the creator's torture instruments of non-stop boring info-dumping. I think Urobuchi is a \"it's so deep no one will understand\" meme come to life.\n\nYou'll say I'm a Michael Bay action-seeking retard with a short attention span. Ha lol nope. One of my favorite movies is Satantango, yeah I can sit and enjoy 7 hours of drying dirt. And it's more entertaining than Psycho-pass because it's showing not telling.\n\nYou can feel the dirt in Satantango, be mesmerized, vibe with the dark world and characters, and think and reflect.\n\nPP left you no room to think, you have to be spoon-fed dystopian pseudo-intelligence nonsense by super boring cliché characters.\n\n4 for the music, which sometimes wakes me up from my lethargy, and for the visuals.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for August\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for August Week 1: August 7 - August 13 Anime releases Black Clover Part 1 Blu-ray & DVD Combo Digimon Adv...read more\n\nAug 6, 2018 2:33 PM by Sakana-san | Discuss (0 comments)\n\nnoitaminA Announces 2018-19 Lineup\n\nLate night anime programming block noitaminA revealed its lineup for years 2018-2019, titled Plus Ultra, during a live event stream on Thursday.
