Check out these Power BI projects that will blow your mind with Power BI’s interactive dashboards, exceptional graphs and charts, and many more features.\n\nNearly 80% of industrial data is said to be ‘unstructured’. The global Business Intelligence market is forecasted to reach USD 33.3 billion by 2025, according to a GlobalNewswire report. The significant rise in the business intelligence market is based on numerous factors, such as rising emphasis on digital transformation, increased funding in analytics, increased demand for data visualization dashboards, rising cloud usage, and higher data generation. Data insights, improved quality, and correct data condensed in a single document have become more critical. Companies interested in harnessing data should invest in a business intelligence system.\n\nWe will look at some intriguing sample Power BI projects in this blog to help you better understand the role of Power BI in Data Science and how it can help businesses thrive.\n\nWhat is Power BI?\n\nMicrosoft Power BI is a Business Intelligence service that enables you to create visually rich and interactive dashboards and reports based on the raw business data acquired from various sources. Apart from the variety of apps, connectors, and services offered by Power BI, there are three basic elements integrated into Power BI-\n\nPower BI Desktop (a desktop version),\n\nPower BI Service (an online SaaS service), and\n\nPower BI Mobile Applications for several platforms.\n\nBusiness users utilize these services to collect data and generate BI reports. These three components are all meant to assist in building, exchanging, and leveraging business insights in the most efficient way possible for any business. Some of the benefits of leveraging Power BI include-\n\nEasy Interaction with Existing Applications: Power BI makes it far easier to implement analytics and reporting abilities since it seamlessly connects with your current business environment.\n\nCustomized Dashboards: The information dashboard can be tailored to meet the demands of a company. The application can simply include Power BI dashboards and reports to create a smooth user experience.\n\nAdvanced Analytics with R Integration: R programming language has several packages focusing on data mining and visualization. Data scientists employ R programming language for machine learning, statistical analysis, and complex data modeling. Data models created in R may be easily integrated into Power BI dashboards and turned into visualizations.\n\nNo Storage or Performance Limits: There are no memory or speed constraints when migrating an existing BI system to a robust cloud environment with Power BI integrated, ensuring that data can be fetched and analyzed efficiently.\n\nSecurely published reports: Power BI enables automatic data refresh and publishes reports securely, allowing users to access the most up-to-date data.\n\nWhat is Power BI Used For?\n\nThere are various tools and techniques for analytics and machine learning in the fascinating and extensive realm of data science. Power BI is a high-level, all-in-one solution for data analytics in data science. Data science aids in the discovery of relevant and productive trends and insights. It involves analyzing the data and also assists us in identifying entirely new features in it. Business intelligence is sifting through data to extract meaningful organizational ideas and insights. BI enhances and strengthens the business infrastructure to get desired or projected results.\n\nMany data sciences and analysis tasks can be automated with Power BI, eliminating the need for spreadsheets and static presentation tools. One of Power-most BI's most impressive features is its ability to create stunning visualizations. The software is packed with excellent and eye-catching visualization templates. The integration of Power BI into Data Science holds great importance for businesses. This allows for smooth and effective data visualization, which plays a vital role in an organization’s success.\n\nWith the help of Power BI, visualization in Data Science can be taken a notch further. Businesses and Data Scientists rely heavily on Power BI-aided data visualization for various projects. Numerous visualization types and charts are available in Power BI for creating effective visualization for data science projects.\n\nHow To Do Visualization in a Power BI Project?\n\nThere are two ways to generate visualization in Power BI. First, add items to Report Canvas from the right side pane. Another way you can do this is by dragging the fields from the right sidebar to the value axis under Visualization. By default, Power BI selects the table type visualization. To each axis, you can add as many fields as necessary. You can also click and drag your visualization to rearrange it on the reporting panel. You can easily toggle between various charts and visualizations from the Visualization window. Your specified fields are transformed to the new visual format as accurately as possible.\n\nLet us now understand how one can perform data visualization in Power BI.\n\nThe first thing you need is data. Power BI can connect several data sources- Excel, Web, etc. The options from which data can be imported into the Power BI desktop are all visible once you click the Get Data icon. You can view the data in the Fields pane once it has been loaded.\n\nAfter loading the sample data into the Power BI desktop, you can modify it with the help of Query Editor. Regardless of the data source, query editors are helpful for editing datasets. In the query editor, you can perform changes like renaming a dataset and removing one or more columns, among other things.\n\nIn Power BI, removing columns from the dataset or modifying the data types in the columns is relatively easy. You can remove columns by simply choosing the Remove Columns option after selecting the desired column. Likewise, the query editor makes it simple to perform a wide range of actions like removing and adding rows, transposing, pivoting, and splitting.\n\nOnce the dataset is complete and has undergone all necessary modifications, you can move on to creating the dashboard. Both bubble and shape maps are available for map visualizations in Power BI. To plot measure values, Power BI offers several combination chart types. Suppose you want to display overall sales and revenue on the same chart. The ideal option for this type of scenario is combination charts.\n\nYou can change the colors in the charts in BI dashboards. There is a color selection option when you choose any visualization.\n\nAdditionally, the application has an analytics feature that allows you to draw lines for data visualization according to your preferences. Power BI also has the option to add various shapes, texts, and images when visualizing data.\n\n15 Power BI Project Examples\n\nThis blog lists 15 Microsoft Power BI projects for you.

Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions\n\nThe first Power BI project idea we have come up with is Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions. Anomaly Detection is a machine learning technique for detecting unusual things, events, or observations that differ considerably from the rest of the data and look suspicious. You can implement this machine learning method in three ways- supervised (for labeled datasets), semi-supervised (for normally trained datasets), and unsupervised (for datasets without any labels).\n\nFor this project, you can use the credit card dataset by Delaware available on their open data platform itself or the credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle. You must first import the dataset into the Power BI desktop, maybe via a web connector. You can then leverage Power BI to train your anomaly detector or use a pre-trained model. To label outliers in Power BI, you'll need to run a Python script in the Power Query Editor and use the get_outliers() method. Finally, Power BI Dashboard can be used to visualize it. You could also train your anomaly detection model in any IDE or Notebook and then pass it to Power BI for labeling. You can do the data visualization in the Power BI dashboard with the help of Line Charts, Bubble Charts, TreeMaps, etc.\n\n7. AutoML Cashflow Optimization for Insurance Company\n\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) is the technique of automating machine learning's time-consuming, iterative processes. It enables data scientists and analysts to rapidly create machine learning models while retaining model quality. Any AutoML solution's ultimate goal is to identify the optimal model based on performance metrics.\n\nIn this business intelligence project, you can work with the medical cost personal dataset from Kaggle. The business problem involves an insurance company that wishes to improve its cash flow projections by precisely estimating patient charges through demographic and primary patient health risk variables at the time of hospitalization. The first step is accessing Power BI Desktop, loading the dataset, and replicating it. The Python script may then be executed in Power Query, where the compare_models() method can be used to train different models, compare them, and evaluate their performance data. You may also use the automl() function to find the best-performing model out of all of them. For the resulting dashboard, you can leverage Power BI dashboard features such as Bar Charts, Bubble Charts, Tables, etc.\n\n8. Global Health Expenditure Analysis\n\nOne of the most helpful Power BI project ideas is the Global Health Expenditure Analysis. This project idea is based on implementing clustering analysis in Power BI using PyCaret. Clustering is a method for bringing data items together that have similar features. These classifications help study a dataset, detect patterns, analyze data, and data clustering help in identifying underlying data structures.\n\nIn this case, use the current health expenditure dataset from the WHO Global Health Expenditure database. From 2000 to 2018, the dataset includes health expenditure as a percentage of national GDP for over 200 nations. Also, you could use the K-Means clustering algorithm for the clustering analysis. Visualize the cluster labels in Power BI Dashboard to gain insights after you have loaded the dataset in Power BI Desktop and trained your clustering model in Power BI. For the summary page dashboard, you might choose visualization chart types such as Filled Maps, Bar Charts, etc., while for the detailed visualization, you can use Point Maps.\n\n9. Loan Application Analysis\n\nThis project concept entails evaluating loan application data to find abstract 'topics,' which are then used to assess the impact of specific topics (loan types) on the default rate. It is based on implementing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model in Power BI. Topic modeling aims to automatically analyze a collection of documents and determine their abstract ‘topics’.\n\nFor this project, you can use the Kiva dataset on GitHub, which covers loan data for 6,818 accepted potential borrowers. The loan amount, nationality, gender, and some text data from the borrower's application are included in the dataset. Once you have loaded the dataset in Power Bi desktop, trained your model, and the topic weights are added to the original dataset in Power BI, you can visualize it in the Power BI dashboard by employing the Word Cloud feature, Pie Charts on basic maps, Bar Charts, Scatter Charts, etc.\n\n10. Movie Sales Visualization\n\nThe movie sales visualization project is one of the most exciting Power BI project ideas. This project aims to take a dataset that shows movie sales over time and turn it into an interactive visual experience. You can use the IMDb dataset for 2006 to 2016, available on both IMDb and Kaggle. The dataset includes a list of movies having an IMDb score of 6 or higher and the parameters Budget, Gross, Genre, and Scores.\n\nYou can create a custom Radial Bar Chart and use Slicers to pick Genre, Country, and score range to be integrated directly into PowerBI. This would display parameters such as Average Score and Gross Collections for the selected set. Plotting a Histogram on the score variable using year and genre as slicers will show the frequency distribution of the IMDb scores. A KDE plot can provide a density graph and insights into the average rating for a specific genre and distribution for a given timeframe.\n\nAdvanced-Level Power BI Project Ideas\n\nLastly, we have listed some of the best power bi projects for professionals who need some interesting power BI projects with dataset to try their hands on.\n\n11.
