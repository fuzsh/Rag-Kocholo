        "text": "1) I would like to point you to a dataset and an API that provides IMDB information.\n\nHere are some queries to get the information from your example, and to show you what kind of data to expect from the dumps.\n\nGet the imdb_id (generic) of a movie, given the movie's name:\n\nYou can either query for that information like shown or download one of:\n\na) The entire Unigraph datadump\n\nb) a slightly smaller subset comprising of only:\n\nWikidata\n\nFreebase\n\nGeonames\n\nOurAirports and\n\nEDGAR data\n\nYou can read more about the dumps and their structure here.\n\nThe IMDB arrives through Wikidata and Freebase, not through IMDB directly.\n\nAs for the url on the site, if it is not part of the url: [] in the response you will have to append it like so: http://www.imdb.com/title/ + imdb_id (provided the id starts with \"tt\" (for movie).\n\n2) Actors with birth dates, again you might have to append the url. This time like so: http://www.imdb.com/name/ + imdb_id\n\nHope this answers your question.\n\nDisclaimer: I am building Unigraph"
