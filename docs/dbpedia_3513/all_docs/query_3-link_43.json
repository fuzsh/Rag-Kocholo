        "text": "Amanda Rollins is a former Adjunct Professor of Criminal Behavior at Fordham University and a retired detective formerly assigned to the Special Victims Unit after moving to New York City from Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nShe has three kids including two daughters, Jesse Rollins, the father being Captain Declan Murphy; and Billie Rollins, the father being her former boyfriend Al Pollack.\n\nShe is currently married to ADA Dominick Carisi, Jr. following her resignation from the Special Victims Unit in 2022. Together they have one son, Dominick “Nicky” Carisi, lll.\n\nBiography[]\n\nShe is from Loganville, Georgia, near Atlanta. (SVU: \"Deadly Ambition\")\n\nWhile in Atlanta, Rollins hunted a serial rapist who ended up in New York City. (SVU: \"Double Strands\")\n\nIt was also revealed that she had a gambling problem and was $20,000 in debt with a bookie. Captain Cragen chose to get her help instead of firing her. (SVU: \"Home Invasions\") She has since been attending Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Rollins' previously mentioned troubled sister, Kim, comes to New York, causing problems for Amanda while she is trying to work a case. (SVU: \"Friending Emily\")\n\nLater Kim returns to New York beaten by her ex-boyfriend Jeff Parker and claiming to be pregnant. (SVU: \"Deadly Ambition\") (Later on, she gives two versions of the supposed pregnancy; on one hand, Amanda finds out she had lied about the pregnancy, Kim confessed that her period had been late causing her to think she was pregnant and on the other, she tells Nick Amaro that she had lost the baby). When Amanda hears screams from inside her apartment, she finds Kim's ex-boyfriend beating Kim, and Amanda shoots and kills the man as he pulls a gun on her.\n\nAfter her initial interview with IAB Lt. Tucker, Kim changes her story, including revealing a life insurance policy on the ex-boyfriend with Amanda's name on it (later on is revealed that Kim forged Amanda's signature because she thought that it would look suspicious if she was the sole beneficiary).\n\nKim's change of story from rape to accident is the result of finding out that neither she nor Amanda would get a penny from the insurance company if they found out that Jeff had died committing a crime. The supposed evidence of Amanda shooting Jeff in cold blood leads to Lt. Tucker arresting Amanda in Captain Cragen's office. The charges against Amanda are later dropped when Amaro tapes Kim confessing to setting Amanda up. Before Kim can be arrested, she steals everything from Amanda's apartment and disappears.\n\nRollins is shot by a sniper in front of the precinct. (SVU: \"Poisoned Motive\") Her shooting leads back to the daughter of Detective Tutuola's narcotics partner, who is out for revenge on the NYPD after her father was injured on the job by protecting Tutuola from a bullet.\n\nRollins is caught in the middle of a case in which her friend from Georgia claims to have been raped. (SVU: \"Rapist Anonymous\") When the alleged rapist is killed, her friend is put on trial and Rollins' personal life is revealed on the stand. This proves too much for her to handle and she is seen gambling, smoking, and drinking in the final scene.\n\nDetective Rollins gambles at an illegal gambling station. (SVU: \"Gambler's Fallacy\") She is forced into the office of the owner after the waitress tells him she is a cop. After this, she is forced to work for them so she won't get exposed to her partners and her job. Amanda is told to steal a gun from evidence and later is caught by Detective Amaro from videotape surveillance. Later in the episode, it is revealed that Declan Murphy is in the NYPD, arresting everybody in the room. At the end of the episode, she would have been transferred if the unit wasn't short-staffed, as quoted by Sergeant Olivia Benson.\n\nEventually, the truth of why Amanda left Atlanta is discovered. (SVU: \"Forgiving Rollins\") Amanda agreed to be a \"good girl\" and sleep with Deputy Chief Patton to get her sister off the hook per Patton's request. She was only able to admit to the rape when one of her fellow former Detectives from Atlanta, Detective Reese Taymor, was raped by Patton. It's possible that Amanda also left due to rumors that Amanda came up with the idea to sleep with him to advance her career.\n\nIt was revealed Amanda was pregnant by September 2015. She never told the rest of the squad, though the fact was realized by serial killer Greg Yates, who taunted her about it. (SVU: \"Devil's Dissections\")\n\nIt is revealed that Declan Murphy is the father of her baby. (SVU: \"Community Policing\")\n\nWhile Amanda is in labor, she suffers a placental abruption, almost resulting in her death.[1] (SVU: \"Depravity Standard\") However, she survives and delivers a healthy baby girl, Jesse.\n\nShe reveals to Benson that she is pregnant with a second child in Season 20, the father being Pollack.\n\nRollins has become close to both Nick Amaro and Dominick Carisi, Jr. and sexual tension has been hinted at between both of them, including a possible romantic relationship between Rollins and Amaro and possible romantic feelings between Rollins and Carisi. When Rollins is revealed to be pregnant in the season 17 premiere, she states that it is not Nick's baby, showing that they at least slept together. However, Rollins has often fought with Carisi and Amaro over certain cases, disagreeing with their opinions. This often becomes heated and makes their relationships complicated. Carisi and Rollins are constantly mistaken for dating, as noted by Rollins' father while he is in the hospital and by hospital staff when Carisi accompanies Rollins to appointments when she was pregnant with her daughters. After Carisi gets promoted to ADA, Rollins and Carisi's relationship becomes more strained, Rollins telling Carisi that she misses him. Eventually, Rollins asks Carisi to share his wedding officiating speech with her, as Finn and Phoebe had decided to no longer get married. Carisi shared his speech, speaking about \"partnerships\" at work are equivalent to marriages. Rollins is brought to tears to which Carisi comforts her. Rollins finally realizes that she has deeper feelings for Carisi, ultimately leading to Rollins kissing him. (SVU: \"Wolves In Sheep's Clothing\")\n\nIn 2019, Rollins revealed to Dr. Alexis Hanover that her father had called her after fifteen years and invited her to his wedding to another woman. She was later kidnapped by Detective Frank Bucci during her private therapy session with Hanover after Judge Joe Ellery declined to press charges against Steve Getz, who was grooming Bucci's daughters Ivy and Milly. (SVU: \"Can't Be Held Accountable\")\n\nEventually, after calming him down, Rollins convinced Frank to drive to the SVU precinct, where Rollins arrested Frank. She then broke down and cried in Carisi's arms, traumatized by her ordeal. (SVU: \"Must Be Held Accountable\")\n\nIn 2020, Rollins was promoted to Detective 2nd Grade. (SVU: \"Solving For The Unknowns\")\n\nIn 2021, Rollins came back to a case after a ten year old boy named Henry Mesner was released from juvenile detention on his eighteenth birthday. Rollins told Henry she had been worried about him and that she didn't want him to die. However, Rollins and her daughter Jesse were stalked and harassed by Henry, with Henry having several photos of Jesse on his phone. Rollins became even more angry after Henry had stabbed Carisi with a pencil in court. After Henry was imprisoned, Rollins visited him and angrily told him that she lied about him not wanting to die and told him that she did indeed want him to die and then warned him that if he ever stalked or came near her family again, she would kill him herself. (SVU: \"Post-Graduate Psychopath\")\n\nWhile trying to protect Nicole Merrick, Rollins was shot by an unknown hitman while escorting Nicole out of witness protection. Rollins was rescued by Officer Dawson who shot the suspect before Rollins could be killed. Rollins was taken to hospital where she was treated for the wound. (L&O: \"Gimme Shelter\")\n\nDuring the Austin Boyer trial, Rollins was violently harassed by fans of Boyer while walking out of the courtroom at one stage, with one female fan yelling and heckling Rollins for arresting Boyer. Rollins was immediately escorted to an elevator by the courthouse security guards who held the fans back. Rollins, feeling extremely overwhelmed and dizzy, stood with her back against the elevator wall with wide eyes watching the fans try to get into the elevator. Feeling overwhelmed with work, when Billie and Jesse thought there was a monster in the closet, Rollins pulled out her gun and checked her closet only to find a dog toy which was making noises. (SVU: \"Mirror Effect\")\n\nRollins and Carisi decided to get married, and the wedding was witnessed by Benson, Tutuola, and Velasco. Following one final case in which Benson and Rollins bonded closely, Rollins told Benson while the two were having fun in Benson's motel room that she was leaving the Special Victims Unit to become a professor. This deeply upset Benson, which resulted in the women having a mild fight due to their differing opinions on the subject, with Rollins leaving Benson's motel room during the fight. Feeling bad for her reaction, Benson tried to contact Rollins, but she wouldn't answer her phone. Rollins eventually met Benson in her office and the two reconciled before sharing a hug while crying. Rollins then walked out of Benson's office while the officers in the squad room clapped and cheered for Rollins. As Rollins hugged an officer, she looked at Benson and the two smiled at each other. (SVU: \"And a Trauma in a Pear Tree\")\n\nAfter her retirement from the NYPD, Amanda became an adjunct professor of Criminal Behavior at Fordham University, and eventually became pregnant with her third child (Carisi's first). (OC: \"Shadowërk\", SVU: \"All Pain Is One Malady\", OC: \"With Many Names\")\n\nIn April of 2024, Amanda resigned from her job at Fordham and helped profile and catch a rapist targeting brides on the night before their weddings.
