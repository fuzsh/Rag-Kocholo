It features Chyler Leigh, Chris Evans, Jaime Pressly, Eric Christian Olsen, Eric Jungmann, Mia Kirshner, Deon Richmond, Cody McMains, Sam Huntington, Samm Levine, Cerina Vincent, Ron Lester, Randy Quaid, Lacey Chabert, Riley Smith and Samaire Armstrong.\n\nReleased on December 14, 2001 by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label, the film is a parody of teen films. While the general plot is based on She's All That,[3] as well as Varsity Blues,[4] 10 Things I Hate About You,[3] Can't Hardly Wait[3] and Pretty in Pink, the film is also filled with allusions to teenage and college-age films from the 1980s and 1990s, such as Bring It On, American Pie, Cruel Intentions,[5] American Beauty,[4] Never Been Kissed, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Can't Buy Me Love, Jawbreaker, Sixteen Candles, Dazed and Confused, Lucas, Rudy, The Breakfast Club, Risky Business, Grease, and Road Trip, while Paul Gleason reprises his role as Vice Principal Vernon from John Hughes' The Breakfast Club (1985).\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the stereotypical high school community of John Hughes High in Southern California, Priscilla, head cheerleader, separates from her football star/slacker boyfriend, Jake Wyler. Discovering she is now dating timid and weird Les to spite him, one of Jake's friends, Austin, makes a bet with him to turn nerdy Janey Briggs into the prom queen. Janey is not insecure enough to feel any need to change herself, nor does she feel anything for him at first, but that does not stop him from trying.\n\nAs Jake attempts to court Janey, he faces adversity from his own sister, Catherine, who is sexually attracted to him; Janey's unnoticed admirer and best friend, Ricky Lipman; and memories from his past football career. Catherine assists him by \"drastically\" altering Janey's appearance (removing her glasses and ponytail), instantly making her drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nMeanwhile, Janey's younger brother, Mitch, and his friends Ox and Bruce, make a pact to lose their virginity by graduation. Mitch tries to impress his longtime crush, Amanda Becker, with a love letter.\n\nAs the prom draws near, Jake becomes known for failing to lead the football team to victory at last year's state championship game. Austin then tricks Jake into telling Janey about his bet to spite Priscilla, pretending to whisper the secret bet in Janey's ear, causing her to leave upset. On prom night, Austin and Janey go together; a jealous Jake and Catherine have a dance-off with Austin and Janey, with Catherine dancing in a sexual manner. Janey runs off crying.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitch and his friends are having a lousy time until Amanda arrives and Mitch gives her the letter (to which she responds she does not have sex with every loser who does such, but gives them handjobs), Bruce hooks up with international exchange student Areola, and Ox hooks up with Catherine.\n\nJake is awarded prom king, and the votes for prom queen are tied. Everyone thinks that it is between Janey and Priscilla, but they are shocked when conjoined twins Kara and Sara Fratelli win prom queen. During the prom king and queen dance, Janey supposedly left with Austin to go to a hotel.\n\nJake goes to the hotel room where he finds Austin having sex with a girl but is shocked to find that it is Priscilla and not Janey, while Les videotapes them with his pants down. Austin tells Jake that Janey \"ran home to her daddy.\" Jake punches Austin and Priscilla, knocking them unconscious for humiliating Janey. He then punches Les for \"being really weird\"; afterwards, he runs to Janey's, only to be told she is on her way to art school in Paris.\n\nJake confronts her before she boards the plane, but uses a plethora of clichéd lines from other films (such as She's All That, Cruel Intentions, American Pie, The Breakfast Club, American Beauty, 10 Things I Hate About You, Can't Hardly Wait, and Pretty in Pink) to convince her to not go. His final (and only original) speech suggests they would be better off separated, but Janey mistakenly believes he is quoting The Karate Kid, and she decides to stay with him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Janey's father Mr. Briggs drunkenly assaults himself with pies in his kitchen. In a post-credits scene, a previously seen albino folk singer, an afroed student with a guitar, reveals that she has become blind and calls out for assistance upon completing her song, while an audience member calls for another to assist in stealing her guitar.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nCast of Not Another Teen Movie Actor Character Stereotype Based on Chyler Leigh Janey Briggs \"The Pretty Ugly Girl\" Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) from She's All That\n\nKaterina Stratford (Julia Stiles) from 10 Things I Hate About You\n\nAndie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) from Pretty in Pink Chris Evans Jake Wyler \"The Popular Jock\" Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.) from She's All That\n\nJake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) from Sixteen Candles\n\nJonathan Moxon (James Van Der Beek) from Varsity Blues Jaime Pressly Priscilla \"The Nasty Cheerleader\" Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) from She's All That\n\nBig Red (Lindsay Sloane) and Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) from Bring It On\n\nAngela Hayes (Mena Suvari) from American Beauty Eric Christian Olsen Austin \"The Cocky Blond Guy\" Dean Sampson Jr. (Paul Walker) from She's All That\n\nSteff McKee (James Spader) from Pretty in Pink Mia Kirshner Catherine Wyler \"The Cruelest Girl\" Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) from Cruel Intentions\n\nMackenzie Siler (Anna Paquin) from She's All That Deon Richmond Malik Token \"The Token Black Guy\" Preston (Dulé Hill) from She's All That Eric Jungmann Ricky Lipman \"The Obsessed Best Friend\" Duckie Dale (Jon Cryer) from Pretty in Pink\n\nJesse Jackson (Elden Henson) from She's All That Ron Lester Reggie Ray \"The Stupid Fat Guy\" Billy Bob (Lester) from Varsity Blues Cody McMains Mitch Briggs \"The Desperate Virgin\" Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) from American Pie\n\nPreston Meyers (Ethan Embry) from Can't Hardly Wait\n\nSimon Boggs (Kieran Culkin) from She's All That\n\nBrian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) and John Bender (Judd Nelson) from The Breakfast Club Sam Huntington Ox \"The Sensitive Guy\" Oz (Chris Klein) from American Pie\n\nAndrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) from The Breakfast Club Samm Levine Bruce \"The Wannabe\" Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) from The Karate Kid\n\nJim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) from American Pie\n\nKenny Fisher (Seth Green) from Can't Hardly Wait Lacey Chabert Amanda Becker \"The Perfect Girl\" Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt) from Can't Hardly Wait Cerina Vincent Areola \"The Foreign Exchange Student\" Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) from American Pie Riley Smith Les \"The Beautiful Weirdo\" Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) from American Beauty Julie Welch Beverly Wyler N/A N/A Samaire Armstrong Kara Fratelli N/A N/A Nectar Rose Sara Fratelli N/A N/A Ed Lauter The Coach \"Win-at-all-cost Jerk Coach\" Coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) from Varsity Blues Randy Quaid Mr. Briggs \"Dead Beat Alcoholic Father\" Russel Casse (Quaid) from Independence Day\n\nWayne Boggs (Kevin Pollak) from She's All That\n\nJack Walsh (Harry Dean Stanton) from Pretty in Pink Joanna Garcia Sandy Sue \"The New Girl in School\" Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) from Grease Beverly Polcyn Sadie Agatha Johnson N/A Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) from Never Been Kissed Rob Benedict Preston Wasserstein N/A Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) from Ferris Bueller's Day Off\n\nJoel Goodson (Tom Cruise) from Risky Business Patrick St. Esprit Austin's father N/A N/A Josh Radnor Tour Guide N/A Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz) from 10 Things I Hate About You\n\nBarry Manilow (Tom Green) from Road Trip Paul Goebel \"The Chef Who Ejaculated Into Mitch's French Toast\" N/A French Toast Guy (Sanz) from Road Trip George Wyner Principal Cornish \"The Principal\" N/A Jon Benjamin Trainer N/A N/A\n\nMany stars of teen films, as well as those from the 1980s, make credited and uncredited appearances.

This cut runs ten minutes longer than the original, and adds a number of deleted, alternate and extended scenes.[8]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film opened at third place at the US box office taking $12.6 million in its opening weekend. It grossed $38.3 million domestically and $28.2 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $66.5 million.[2]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 31% based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. The site's critics consensus states: \"NATM has some funny moments, but the movie requires the audience to have familiarity with the movies being spoofed and a tolerance for toilet and sexual humor to be truly effective.\"[9] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 32 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[10] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.[11]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of a possible four, and admitted to laughing a few times but not as much as he did for American Pie or Scary Movie. Ebert also criticized the scatological humor. He urged audiences to not waste their time on the film, when in the month of December 2001 there were \"21 other promising films\" to choose from.[12]\n\nRobin Rauzi of the Los Angeles Times called it \"a 90-minute exercise in redefining the word 'gratuitous'\" and suggested it is most likely to appeal to fourteen-year-olds – \"who of course [are] not supposed to be seeing this R-rated movie\".[5] Dennis Harvey of Variety criticized the film for its \"overall tendency to mistake mere bad taste for outrageousness, and plain referentiality for satire\" but praised Evans, Pressly, and Olsen for giving performances better than the material. He noted that the film follows the model of Scary Movie but lacked the comic finesse of Anna Faris.[4]\n\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \"a crass act\" and pointed out the futility of trying to parody films that are already absurd. LaSalle complained that the film too closely copies She's All That, calling it \"pathetic\" that Not Another Teen Movie is just another formulaic teen movie.[3]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nScary Movie (film series) (2000–13)\n\nDate Movie (2006)\n\nEpic Movie (2007)\n\nMeet the Spartans (2008)\n\nDisaster Movie (2008)\n\nSuperhero Movie (2008)\n\nSpanish Movie (2009)\n\nDance Flick (2009)\n\nVampires Suck (2010)\n\nThe Starving Games (2013)\n\nBest Night Ever (2013)\n\nSuperfast!
