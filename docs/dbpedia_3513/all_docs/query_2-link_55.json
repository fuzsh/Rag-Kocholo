So a lot of people I know ask for Instagram or give their Instagram\n\nThe more professional and experienced use professional photography taken photos especially headshots and list height, weight, bust, dress size, shoe size, film / tv work - IMDB\n\nModels will have tear sheets\n\nBut more experienced talent expects higher pay\n\nOPâs problem will be actresses or models want opportunities they can use to gain future opportunities so movies, theater, runway during fashion week and what OP needs does not fit those goals so an agency or agent or serious actress might be less receptive or interested which is why I brought up gig work\n\nThe actress would need danger pay. She'd be literally stabbed by a fat, jealous 75 year old wife...\n\nI once dated - for a short time - a very attractive gal who was actually a year older than I was (55, she was 56). Tiny little 112 lbs size 2 gal with a slim flat waist and NICE tits (plastic). I remarked \"can't wait to see you in a bikini at Jeff's cottage...\". To which she replied \" You get this in a bikini when we are alone. Its too dangerous with other wives around. The bigger wives get REALLY hostile\". and she meant it.\n\nThis tiny gal with the big tits worked in a mens medium security correctional facility, and had no problems dealing with convicted felons doing 25-life. But she's loooong ago recognized the fury that fat, nasty old women have for other women who look good.\n\nPost an ad flyer on Dallas or Austen phone poles, outside of homeless shelters. \"Looking for female companionship for 3 day gig. Clothing will be provided. Must be extremely attractive. Must be able to cover tats, piercings and track marks. No sex involved. No pay, but applicant may keep clothes. Free transportation to and from event, and meals. Boyfriends and pimps not allowed.\n\nI did something similar once, just hired a regular escort from backpage, with the understanding that there would be no sex, I was just taking her to a dinner.\n\nI did not bang her or anything of the sort, just confused a group of soccer moms and made them feel fat and unloved.\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By CarmelBytheSea:\n\nThere's a thousand ways to hire talent from contacting an agency to Craigslist gig jobs\n\nEven YouTube refers content creators to everything from voice actors to editors\n\nEven Indeed could be used as anyone without representation is constantly scouring any possible lead for commercials, independent films or whatever depending on their experience level\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/q-actress-jobs.html\n\nJust depends on budget etc\n\nView Quote\n\n@CarmelBytheSea\n\nI asked my wife to have this guy roast me for my birthday and it is only $50 lol.
