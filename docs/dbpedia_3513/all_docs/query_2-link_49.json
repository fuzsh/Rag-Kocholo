        "text": "Ahoy! This here is the 1st Featured Article.\n\n\"Monkey D. Luffy\" has been featured, meaning it was chosen as an article of interest.\n\nFor other uses, see Straw Hat Luffy (Disambiguation).\n\nFor the chapters of the same name, see Chapter 2 and Chapter 1000.\n\nMonkey D. Luffy, commonly known as \"Straw Hat Luffy\" or simply \"Straw Hat\",[10] is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.[26][27] He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King[28] and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends).[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]\n\nBorn on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon[32] and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp[33] and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan,[34] under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. \"Fire Fist\" Ace[35] and Sabo.[36] However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber,[37] sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.[38]\n\nAs a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.\n\nLuffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties[23][22][21][20][19][18] as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular.[39] Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation,[40] the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of 3,000,000,000.[4] Upon the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after centuries, Luffy is also heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy.\n\nHe is the main protagonist of the One Piece manga and anime series.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat is the significance of Monkey D. Luffy's straw hat?\n\nMonkey D. Luffy's straw hat is more than just a fashion statement - it's a symbol of his childhood and his dreams. The hat was given to him by his idol, the legendary pirate captain 'Red-Haired' Shanks, who received it from Gol D. Roger. This hat is the reason for Luffy's nickname, 'Straw Hat Luffy', and it's also the namesake and symbol of his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. So, every time you see Luffy's straw hat, remember it's not just a hat, it's a symbol of his journey and aspirations!\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger?\n\nThe legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger, also known as the Pirate King, is known as 'One Piece'. This treasure is said to be the greatest in the world and its location was revealed by Roger just before his death. This revelation sparked the Grand Age of Pirates, with many dreaming of finding One Piece and becoming the next Pirate King.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nWhat is Monkey D. Luffy's dream?\n\nMonkey D. Luffy's ultimate dream is to become the Pirate King so he can become the person with the most freedom in the world, with the ability to travel anywhere on the ocean. He aims to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will earn him the coveted title of Pirate King. He's confident that he can't achieve this dream alone and relies on his comrades to help him. This dream is the driving force behind all of Luffy's adventures in the One Piece manga. Additionally, Luffy has revealed another dream to a select few people; this dream has not been revealed to the reader yet.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nHow did Monkey D. Luffy become the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates?\n\nMonkey D. Luffy became the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates through his own determination and adventurous spirit. After his body turned into rubber due to eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi, Luffy set sail with the goal of becoming the next King of the Pirates. His charismatic personality and fearless approach to challenges attracted a diverse crew who pledged their loyalty to him.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nWhat makes Monkey D. Luffy the strongest combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates?\n\nMonkey D. Luffy, also known as 'Straw Hat Luffy', is the strongest combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates due to his fearless pursuit of the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger. His strength is recognized by many, including his opponents, despite his age and appearance often leading to underestimation. Luffy's accomplishments in battle are numerous, including defeating multiple Warlords of the Sea. His heritage as the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, also contributes to his reputation as a formidable fighter.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nAppearance\n\nFurther information: Monkey D. Luffy/Gallery\n\nLuffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his epithet \"Straw Hat Luffy\"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, \"Red-Haired\" Shanks,[38] who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger.[41] Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest, light blue denim shorts cuffed just above his knees, and tan sandals. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate.[42] He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford,[43] leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.[44]\n\nBefore the Timeskip\n\nSimilar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (such as a hooded parka on Drum Island[45] or desert robes in Arabasta[46]) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.[47]\n\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, he wore two different parkas, the first being a burgundy parka with white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem,[45] and then a checkered, hooded parka with the colors white, orange, and bright yellow, which Nami wore in the beginning.[48]\n\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, he wore desert robes consisting of a dark red robe with three white rings decorated along both sleeves and a light blue wrap over his head.[46]\n\nDuring the Skypiea Arc, he wore his vest open and additionally wore a black wristband around his left wrist with a white bangle over it.[49] In 37 Volume SBS, Oda said that two members of his crew lent him accessories: a black wristband by Usopp and a white bracelet by Sanji.[47]\n\nDuring the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Luffy wore an afro on his head, dark red shorts, and red bandages on his feet, getting an image of a blue flaming skull and crossbones painted on his chest as well, when he was fighting Foxy.[50]\n\nDuring the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore black shorts with larger pockets than his blue shorts.\n\nDuring the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Luffy wore a white T-shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in red; red liners around the top, shoulders, and collar; and navy-blue shorts.[51]\n\nDuring the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an orange vest and dark red shorts.[52] After the battle against Moria in Thriller Bark, Luffy wore a dark decorated, jeweled armband around his left bicep, given to him by Nami.[53] This armband was later revealed to be a map that leads to Captain John's lost treasure, which Buggy sought for some time; Luffy handed the armband over to Buggy in exchange for his services in navigating through Impel Down.[54]\n\nDuring the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, in the manga, he wore a blue vest and red shorts (which can also be seen on the cover of Volume 52). In the anime, he wore the same blue vest, but dark blue shorts.[55]\n\nDuring the Amazon Lily Arc, Luffy wore a light blue vest with maroon shorts.[56]\n\nDuring the Impel Down Arc, Luffy wore his outfit from his stay on Amazon Lily until after his fight with Magellan, at which point he replaced his light blue vest with a bright yellow vest and brighter red shorts given to him by Inazuma.[57]\n\nNo matter where he is, Luffy wears his Straw Hat through absolutely everything, though at the start, the hat was prone to get knocked off his head easily, forcing Luffy to either put it aside or have someone hold onto it during fights. From the Arabasta Arc onward, he has gotten a string strap for it, which was sewn on by Nami, allowing the hat to hang on his back from his neck during fights.\n\nDuring his return to Marineford to give a silent prayer, Luffy was briefly shown with four characters written on his right arm spelling 3D2Y,[58] with the 3D crossed out to symbolize that the Straw Hat Pirates should meet up in 2 years (2Y) rather than the 3 days (3D) as planned after fleeing from Bartholomew Kuma.[59]\n\nDuring his journey, Luffy has used the power of his Devil Fruit in creative ways, many of which involve altering his body. The greatest example of his altered appearance is the creation of his Gear techniques which dramatically affect his entire body:\n\nIn Gear 2, Luffy pumps more blood throughout his whole body, causing his sweat to rapidly vaporize and making it appear that he is releasing steam. In the anime, his entire skin turns slightly pink and shiny from the increased blood flow.\n\nIn Gear 3 form, Luffy blows a massive amount of air into his body, causing it to inflate and enlarge a specific part of his body to a size equivalent to that of a Giant. After the transformation wears off, his body temporarily shrinks to a child-sized form, with large hands and a vertically compressed head. The properties and appearance of this technique changed after the two-year timeskip.\n\nAfter the Timeskip\n\nAfter those two years, a few things have changed. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and a better-defined chest, which shows the X-shaped scar he received by then-Admiral Akainu covering most of it.[60] His usual attire is mostly the same as it was two years ago, but instead of a vest, Luffy wears an open, 3/4-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons and with a yellow sash tied around his waist with the end hanging from his left hip (somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit).\n\nDue to Luffy's increasing notoriety in addition to the increasing strength of his foes, after the timeskip he finds himself more often dressed in disguises to mask his identity, with varying levels of sophistication. Despite this, he still never loses his trademark straw hat and instead opts to at times cover it with other headwear.\n\nDuring the Punk Hazard Arc, Luffy wore a long winter coat with red and white horizontal stripes, along with yellow earmuffs and dark red gloves, which he stole from one of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit.[61] Just before leaving, he switched to a different coat that is all red with dark brown fur lining and a light brown belt, as well as brown gloves.\n\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, due to his need to hide his identity in Doflamingo's territory, Luffy wore an open, dark blue short-sleeved shirt with a sunflower pattern, his standard blue shorts and yellow sash, and a black bowler hat over his straw hat. He also wore a fake beard.[62] Upon entering the tournament for the Mera Mera no Mi in the Corrida Colosseum, he wore Viking-style armor, complete with a sword and shield.[63] Upon revision to meet the tournament's weight restriction, he got rid of most of the armor, but kept the cape and helmet, along with his registration number '0556' and the word \"Lucy\" written on the back of his shirt, obscured by his cape.[64] When he recovered after his battle against Doflamingo, Luffy wore a dark red tank top along with his standard shorts in brown (dark grey in the anime).[65]\n\nAs he and the newly formed 'Sanji Retrieval Team' departed from Zou, he swapped out his standard blue shorts for a brown pair.\n\nDuring the Whole Cake Island Arc, Luffy wore an open, fancy white shirt with puffy sleeves, red trim, and an ornate gold pattern on the collar along with red shorts and his standard yellow sash. He also had a decorative scarf wrapped around his straw hat after landing at the Seducing Woods, though he appears to have lost it during his battle with Charlotte Cracker. These clothes were eventually torn to shreds after several battles and he later dons a new outfit to meet with Capone Bege; a brick red blazer with matching shorts, a black dress shirt, and a pink cravat. He also fitted a black fedora to the top of his straw hat.[66]\n\nDuring his fight with Sanji, Luffy loses one of his top teeth after being struck by a Diable Jambe Joue Shot directly into his face.[67] However, it grew back after he drank a bottle of milk.[68]\n\nDuring the Wano Country Arc, Luffy wore a red yukata with patchwork mon of a blue rounded sun on a cyan background and a yellow obi. He also had a topknot on top of his hair. He also had the Nidai Kitetsu he borrowed from Tenguyama Hitetsu.[69] Before beginning the assault on Onigashima, Luffy received a set of samurai armor from Hitetsu.[70] When helping Kin'emon and the others against Kaidou's fleet at sea, Luffy wore a long black coat, his usual red shirt, orange shorts and a purple sash.[71] He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates disguise created by Kin'emon when infiltrating Onigashima, which consisted of fake red horns, black pauldrons with white lining, a black belt with white lining and the Beast Pirates jolly roger on the front, which is connected to the pauldrons by brown straps connecting to a silver ring, black leather pants, a red feather cape, orange gloves, and his regular sandals.[72] During his celebration of the Raid's success, Luffy wears another red yukata, this one with a blue sash and yellow-and-white hexagonal patterns. In the following days, he wears a third red yukata with a purple ocean wave pattern and an orange sash. As he leaves Wano, he is seen wearing his Raid outfit, though his orange shorts were swapped for yellow ones.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Luffy received a long red coat with orange-yellow accents and the SSG logo, along with gloves, an earpiece, and a pair of red DOM Shoes.[73] During his fight with Kizaru, he discarded this attire, remaining in his original shorts and sandals.[74]\n\nAfter the two-year timeskip, Luffy developed another two Gears, with one of them having its own sub-transformations, as well as significantly changing Gear 3:\n\nDuring Luffy's two years of training, he further developed Gear 3 to have the air concentrated into his fist and a large sphere of air in his wrist, as opposed to throughout a whole limb as before. He also uses it in a variety of sizes, does not shrink afterward, and is almost always hardened with Busoshoku Haki, giving it a shiny black appearance.\n\nIn Gear 4, Luffy's body proportions shift dramatically, specific to the exact form he is taking. In all forms, he gains dark rings around his eyes, and a level of Busoshoku Haki coating over at least his arms and legs that has crimson accents in addition to the typical black.\n\nIn the Boundman form, Luffy inflates himself, transforming his torso to be more spherical. He increases the size of his arms to match his torso and spreads Busoshoku Haki coating over portions of his upper chest, creating the same type of swirls as those on the Gomu Gomu no Mi. In the process of inflating, Luffy also becomes taller and more muscular.\n\nThe details of the Tankman form's regular appearance are unknown, as Luffy has only used a variation called the \"Manpuku Version\". In the Manpuku Version of Tankman, Luffy's body goes through a similar yet exaggerated transformation to Boundman. In this form, his torso inflates significantly more than the rest of his body, while his arms only slightly inflate. The Busoshoku Haki coating covers most of his body except for his chest, creating a flame-like pattern. He goes through a much more significant height increase, though he loses the muscular physique of Boundman to increase the roundness of his body.\n\nIn the Snakeman form, Luffy's body does not shift dramatically, remaining largely the same in terms of overall proportions. While some expansion still occurs, it's much less than in Boundman and Tankman, with the bulk of the transformation occurring in Luffy's newly flame-like hair. Compared to the other forms, he has less Busoshoku Haki spread, barely reaching his shoulders. He also gains a trail of steam and fire that drapes over his shoulders.\n\nIn Gear 5, Luffy's hair and clothes turn pure white (save for his sash and sandals). His hair takes on the appearance of a flame, and his eyes glow with large pink pupils. Like in Snakeman, he has a trail of gas draped over his shoulders, this time formed out of clouds.\n\nNon-Canon\n\nSimilarly to the main series, Luffy wears his standard outfit in most non-canon material. Starting with Movie 11, his standard wear is completely absent with very few exceptions.\n\nDuring Movie 3, he wears a red shirt with the number \"01\" in black in the middle. A deer costume with a fur coat and two tree branches for antlers was also momentarily seen.\n\nDuring the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates the kitchens as a Marine cook, wearing a white cook uniform, a blue scarf on his neck, and a white cook hat covering his straw hat.\n\nDuring Movie 6, Luffy wears a bright orange hoodie with the sleeves torn off, a black wristband on his left arm, and light blue shorts.\n\nDuring the Ice Hunter Arc, Luffy wears a pale-yellow parka with burgundy seams, and black triangular patches on the arms.\n\nDuring Movie 9, Luffy wears a red parka.\n\nDuring the Spa Island Arc, Luffy dresses in a pair of dark red swim trunks with the word 'Mermaid' written on the right leg, and a pair of cyan swimming goggles. He also carries two inner tubes: a white one with dark blue stripes, and an orange one with the Criminal logo on the side.\n\nDuring the Little East Blue Arc, he wears red-orange jacket exposed at the chest, and a pair of sky blue shorts.\n\nDuring Movie 10, prior to his meeting with Shiki, Luffy wears bright blue swim trunks with a blue-and-white cloud pattern, along with a yellow towel. When he was sent to Mereveille along with the rest of his crewmates, he wears a dark blue loose-fitting collared shirt with two light blue 'X' marks on each side, and loose pair of pale red shorts with bushy dark red rims. Slung on his shoulders are a yellow travel bag and a giant green canteen, and below his straw hat are two helmets: one yellow, and an orange one with undone straps and a pair of goggles. During his raid on Shiki's palace, he dresses in a black suit with a red dress shirt and a black tie, topped with a large coat sporting gold trim and white cuffs.\n\nDuring Movie 11, Luffy wears a short-sleeved orange hoodie with a gold patch saying '56 Gomu' on the left breast and both of his sleeves.\n\nDuring 3D2Y, Luffy wears a bright red hoodie with a furred hood, a gold zipper, and torn sleeves, with the back of the hood sporting a pawprint design, along with white wraps around his stomach and right bicep and his regular blue shorts. Since this takes place during the two-year timeskip, his hat is noticeably absent.\n\nDuring Episode of Luffy, Luffy wears a red hooded jumpsuit.\n\nDuring Adventure of Nebulandia, he wears a red short-sleeved zip-up hoodie with a stylized version of his Jolly Roger splayed across the front along with his typical blue shorts and yellow sash.\n\nDuring the Z's Ambition Arc, Luffy wears red shorts with 'Criminal' written on the left leg, and a black T-shirt showing a picture of a shark riding a wave.\n\nDuring Movie 12, Luffy celebrates the 'Cherry Blossom Party' wearing gray shorts and a gold V-neck shirt with a skeleton's sockets and teeth stitched on the front. Under his hat is a frilly orange cap with the buckles undone. When searching for Z on Secon Island, Luffy wears a leather jacket, a blue shirt with a faded cloud-like pattern, brown shorts, and dark brown boots. Out of the gear Mobston gave the Straw Hat Pirates to prepare for their fight with the Neo Marines, he chose a bright red long coat with gold trim over a red button up shirt, a yellow vest, a dark crimson sash, and black shorts. Strapped to the coat were two rapiers and a giant piece of meat on a bone.\n\nThe second outfit was designed in collaboration with Armani.\n\nAt the end of Opening 16 Hands Up!, Luffy is seen wearing a fancy black coat with gold accents, a burgundy dress shirt, a black tie, black shorts, and a yellow sash.\n\nIn Opening 17 Wake up!, Luffy wore a longer version of his typical red shirt with thin yellow and blood red edges over a white button-up shirt with a popped collar, an orange sash with no loose ends, blood red shorts, a yellow ball chain necklace with blood red gems hanging from the yellow ones, and a blood red, orange, and yellow striped headband. He also carries a red flag with the Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger.\n\nDuring Heart of Gold, Luffy wore red shorts and a white and orange parka, with the right breast sporting a jolly roger with the word 'Winter' written above the skull. When going to explore Alchemi, he trades his parka for a furred jacket that matches his shorts, and wears a pith helmet with a flashlight, leaving his regular hat dangling around his neck.\n\nDuring Movie 13, on his way to Gran Tesoro (and throughout Film: Gold Episode 0), he wore black shorts, a red helmet with a skull at the front, and red and white nio-dasuki tied around his waist. Pinned to the back is a giant blue inflatable axe, and at the front is a large black and red loincloth showing two axes and the kanji symbol for 'Gold' written in gold. When changing to head into the casino, he wore a pure white blazer and shorts with a red handkerchief in his left breast pocket, a dark blue and orange Hawaiian shirt, and a straw cowboy hat with his regular one set around his neck. When planning the heist with Carina, he wore a red, yellow, and green tank top with a star that says 'Luck' on the front, and light blue shorts. When choosing a disguise, he jokingly went for an orange and green dress. During the heist, he wore a black leather vest and shorts, with a pair of goggles.\n\nDuring the Marine Rookie Arc, Luffy wears his standard post-timeskip outfit with a Marine coat over his shoulders.\n\nAt the start of Movie 14 (and the entire Cidre Guild Arc), Luffy wears a red and white striped shirt with his Jolly Roger on the back, pale blue shorts, white sports bandages wrapped around his torso, and a pair of geta. Strapped to his back is a large wooden instrument. In his attendance at the Pirates Festival, he changes into black shorts, an orange sash, and red button-up shirt. Topping his straw hat is a beige, patterned covering with frilled edges. Strapped to his back is a seafoam green knapsack stuffed with various objects and food, and a giant green spiked shield. When leaving the Pirates Festival after his fight with Douglas Bullet, Luffy wears an orange tank top.\n\nThe first outfit was designed in collaboration with UNIQLO.\n\nDuring Movie 15, Luffy's Festival Outfit during Uta's concert was a loose-fitting red shirt, with a white '56' on the left sleeve, and the center sporting a design of a microphone wearing his straw hat. He also wore an orange vest with yellow straps, with four fans circling around it. During his flashbacks to Foosha Village (and the Uta's Past Arc), Luffy wears red shorts and a white T-shirt with a yellow 'X' on it. His Battle Outfit consists of a bulky leather jacket with various rings, zippers, studs, and a red cross on the left sleeve which he wears around his shoulders. Paired with a loose V-neck T-shirt with a beige Jolly Roger tilted uptilted to the right, pink-ish red torn shorts, a golden buckle with a rapier strapped to it, and a large black captain's hat with a pink sash, gold trim, and a white design of a skeleton and a stripped patterning. When transforming into Gear 5 to land his final blow against Tot Musica, the Battle Outfit turns pure white as usual, though as the monster disappears his clothes morph into the form's debut appearance in the Wano Country Saga: his all-white standard outfit and a purple sash.\n\nReferences\n\nSite Navigation\n\nCrew:Companions:\n\nZeus\n\nKaroo (Former)‡\n\nMain Ships:Soldier Dock System:Other Ships:\n\nShimashima Shopping (Destroyed)†\n\nKarasumaru (Former)‡\n\nTaru Tiger (Former)‡\n\nTarumanma (Non-Canon)≠ (Destroyed)†\n\nMa Ikkada (Non-Canon)≠ (Destroyed)†\n\nSexy Foxy (Non-Canon)≠ (Former)‡\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapon Based:Creations:Support:\n\nRelated ArticlesAssociated Locations:Former Memberships:Instigated Events:Other:\n\nSenior Captain:\n\nMonkey D.
