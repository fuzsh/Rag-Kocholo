        "text": "In a world with such technology....\n\nWhy would there still be yellow cabs? As the film pans - you see all them... then ONE futuristic electric looking car, making it very hard to understand whether we are watching a Sci-Fi film or some rich kid in a go-kart.\n\nWhy, with all the security that is 'George', would XChange allow you to wear your ID like a dog tag? Surely they would have thought it through and realised it would be a problem? Surely we won't get so complacent that we will think people won't do anything illegal?\n\nI normally look forward to the day when i can travel as easily as they did in this film, but after watching this film...i would rather just stay home!\n\nDiarrhoea for the eyes...\n\n0 out of 5 found this helpful.
