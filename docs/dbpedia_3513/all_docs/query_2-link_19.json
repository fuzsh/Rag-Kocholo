Stu's plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry.\", \"Poster\":\"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MTM4MzY2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ3NzI4NA@@._V1_SX320.jpg\",\" Runtime\":\"1 hr 42 mins\", \"Rating\":\"7.1\", \"Votes\":\"13547\", \"ID\":\"tt1411697\", \"Response\":\"True\" }\n\nYou can get the \"ID\" (tt1411697) from this JSON response.\n\nAs mentioned, IMDB does not have a web service. imdbapi works by screen scraping. The flat files available for download are a legacy from IMDB's pre-Amazon days, and the information there is incomplete. (You could not build your own IMDB with just the files that are available)\n\nHowever, Rotten Tomatoes does have a nice web interface that returns, among other things, the imdb id of the films - in the alternate_ids section. So, you could use the Rotten Tomatoes API to obtain the imdb id without screen scraping imdb directly.\n\nRotten Tomatoes' database is less extensive than IMDB's, but it does a pretty good job with modern (1995+) US releases."
