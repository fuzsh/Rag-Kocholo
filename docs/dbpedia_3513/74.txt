In a world with such technology....

Why would there still be yellow cabs? As the film pans - you see all them... then ONE futuristic electric looking car, making it very hard to understand whether we are watching a Sci-Fi film or some rich kid in a go-kart.

Why, with all the security that is 'George', would XChange allow you to wear your ID like a dog tag? Surely they would have thought it through and realised it would be a problem? Surely we won't get so complacent that we will think people won't do anything illegal?

I normally look forward to the day when i can travel as easily as they did in this film, but after watching this film...i would rather just stay home!

Diarrhoea for the eyes...
