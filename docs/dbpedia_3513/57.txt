I have used IMDB's datasets for academic research before.

After decompressing movies.list.gz you get a file with ~120 MB and 2600000+ movies, which seems like a decent number of films to me, heheh.

Tip: If you're trying to integrate IMDB's data with other movie datasets you might have, download the "aka-titles.list.gz" file too as it contains different variations for movie titles.
