        "text": "Since\n\nSince\n\nthe 17th century, European cities have been a hotbed for authors,\n\nproducing some of the world’s most experimental, emotive and\n\nimmersive literature. To really get under the skin of these\n\ndestinations, we’ve picked out our some of our favourite books\n\nwhich helped to put them on the literary map. Read them before you\n\ngo but resist the urge to wander around belting out quotes when\n\nyou’re there – unless you’re actively looking to lose your travel\n\ncompanions, that is.\n\nParis\n\nIf anywhere matches London for literary glory it’s Paris, steeped as it is in romance and rebellion from\n\nFlaubert to Voltaire. To bring the city’s heyday to life, it’s hard\n\nto beat Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast, in which\n\nwriters and artists struggle to make ends meet outside legendary\n\nbookshop, Shakespeare and Co. Scott Fitzgerald believed that\n\n“France has the only two things toward which we\n\ndrift as we grow older – intelligence and good manners”. For both\n\nof these in spades go for The Hare with the Amber\n\nEyes by Edmund de Waal, which traces the twisted tales of\n\na family heirloom from its genesis to the modern day. Finally, for\n\nthose after the less romantic side of Paris’s past, it’s worth\n\npicking up Andrew Miller’s Pure, which won the\n\nCosta Prize in 2011. In this visceral but gripping tale, an\n\nengineer is tasked with transplanting the cemetery of Les Innocents\n\nchurch in pre-Revolutionary France.\n\nBarcelona\n\nA Barcelona classic, George Orwell’s Homage to\n\nCatalonia sears the city into the minds of its readers,\n\nvividly evoking the civil war in all its complexity and anguish.\n\nFor something a little lighter, The Lonely Hearts\n\nClub by Raul Nunez is an amusing romp through the seedier\n\nside of Barca. In contrast, eerie thriller The Shadow of\n\nthe Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón is set between the dark\n\nstreets of the Gothic Quarter and a labyrinthine library of\n\nforgotten titles. Irish writer Colm Tóibín has lived in the city\n\nfor most of his life and his Homage to Barcelona\n\nis a perfect companion to your trip, simultaneously personal and\n\ninformative. His novel, South, combines this setting with the\n\nfemale-led fiction he’s renowned for.\n\nRome\n\nIt’s pretty hard to imagine what Rome was really like in the time of senators and\n\ngladiators, but Robert Harris’s series on Cicero (beginning with\n\nImperium) is a thrilling reimagining of the\n\nperiod. For a more serious approach, Robert Graves’ I,\n\nClaudius is wonderfully told and immersive, while\n\nThe Woman of Rome by Alberto Moravia is a 1947\n\nmasterpiece set in the backstreets of the city, where a beautiful\n\nand vulnerable prostitute gets caught up in Fascist intrigue. In a\n\nsimilar vein, The Ragazzi by Pier Paolo Pasolini rattles through\n\nthe life of a street urchin in the poet’s inimitable style. To get\n\na sense of the city’s contemporary literary culture, Rome\n\nTales (edited by Helen Constantine) is 20 stories about\n\nthe city from 20 of its best writers. And if you only do one thing\n\nin Rome, visit Keats’ house on the Spanish steps to get a sense of\n\nthe environment in which he masterminded some of his best work.\n\nMadrid\n\nDon Quixote may be considered the first novel\n\never written, but it probably shouldn’t be first on your reading\n\nlist, given its staggering length and dense medieval prose which\n\ncan render you a little stumped. Instead pick up The\n\nHive by Camilo José Cela, a bold portrait of post-civil\n\nwar Spain that was censored and first published in Argentina. Taking place over three days, its\n\nshort chapters give a bleak but fascinating insight into the\n\ncountry. If you’re planning on a longer stay, Leaving\n\nAtocha Station by Ben Lerner is a beautiful slice of\n\nmeandering ex-pat life, taking in the Prado, boho cafés and\n\ncountryside escapades.\n\nStockholm\n\nIt’s impossible to write about Swedish literature without\n\nmentioning Stieg Larsson’s Millennium Trilogy,\n\nwhich set a global thirst for Scandi noir in motion. But dig a\n\nlittle deeper and there’s lots beyond gritty crime fiction. Eyvind\n\nJohnson is considered the most influential writer in the Swedish\n\ncanon and his Return to Ithaca is an entertaining\n\nretelling of The Odyssey. The Red Room by August\n\nStrindberg is often considered the beginning of modern Swedish\n\nliterature, exploring the politics and culture of Stockholm society through the eyes of an\n\nidealistic civil servant. Also by Strindberg, The People of\n\nHemsö is a thoughtful tragicomedy set on a fictional\n\nisland in the city’s archipelago.\n\nVienna\n\nWriters and intellectuals have been drawn to the Austrian\n\ncapital for decades, and the literary output reflects this fertile\n\nenvironment. William Boyd recreates the dazzling atmosphere of its\n\npast in his whodunit Waiting for Sunrise tale.\n\nGraham Greene’s The Third Man and The\n\nFallen Idol is a near perfect recreation of post-war\n\nVienna told as a haunting thriller, with Greene also writing the\n\nscreenplay of the seminal film version. With a contemporary\n\nsetting, The Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek\n\n(winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature 2004) brings to life the\n\nVienna Conservatory and the hidden desires of the city at\n\nnight.\n\nLisbon\n\nThe bestselling Night Train to Lisbon by Pascal Mercier is a philosophical\n\nquest through the mysteries of the city with enough romance and\n\nintrigue to keep you gripped from start to finish. The poetry of\n\nFernando Pessoa will also keep you sustained through long hot\n\nLisbon nights but for less cerebral reading, Antonio Tabucchi’s\n\nPereira Maintains is a stinging rebuke against complacency of the\n\npress in difficult times. Requiem: A Hallucination\n\nby the same author is a beautiful and surreal short story told as\n\nan ephemeral journey through the city.\n\nBerlin\n\nA city of historical turmoil, Berlin has been fertile ground for\n\nliterature about torment and emotion. Goodbye\n\nBerlin, a semi-autobiographical account of Christopher\n\nIsherwood’s time there in the 1930s, was described by Orwell as\n\n“brilliant sketches of a society in decay” and certainly makes for\n\na thought-provoking read. Not for the fainthearted, A Woman\n\nin Berlin is a harrowing anonymous memoir chronicling the\n\nRussian occupation of Berlin in the immediate aftermath of the war.\n\nTo get a sense of the city of today, Chloe Aridjis’ Book of\n\nClouds is an impressionistic walk around town, with the\n\ncharacters and scenes painting a picture-perfect scene. Paul Beatty\n\nrecently won the Man Booker Prize in 2016 and his third novel,\n\nSlumberland, is a freestyle quest on the trail of\n\na mysterious jazzman in the days before the fall of the Berlin\n\nWall.\n\nPrague\n\nIf endless trials and human-sized bugs in the attic aren’t your\n\nthing, it may be worth steering clear of Prague’s most famous\n\nauthor, Kafka. Instead, The Unbearable Lightness of\n\nBeing by Milan Kundera is a beautiful meditation on the\n\ndelicacy and randomness of life. For a more critical take on the\n\ncity’s past oppression, Philip Roth’s The Prague\n\nOrgy follows his famous hero Nathan Zuckerman into the\n\ncommunist underbelly of the state. Although Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nspent most of his life on the road, he was born in Prague and his\n\nlyrical poetry is the perfect companion to your travels.\n\nFlorence"
