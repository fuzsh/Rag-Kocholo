        "text": "Eyvind Johnson, (29 July 1900 – 25 August 1976) was a Swedish writer and author. He became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1957 and shared the Nobel Prize in Literature with Harry Martinson in 1974 with the citation: for a narrative art, far-seeing in lands and ages, in the service of freedom.\n\nJohnson was born Olof Edvin Verner Jonsson in Svartbjörnsbyn village in Överluleå parish, near the town of Boden in Norrbotten. In Boden they show the small house where he grew up.\n\nHis most noted works include Här har du ditt liv! (Here is Your Life!) (1935), Strändernas Svall (Return to Ithaca) (1946) and Hans Nådes Tid (The Days of his Grace) (1960).\n\nThe choice for Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson in 1974 was controversial as both were on the Nobel panel themselves and Graham Greene, Saul Bellow and Vladimir Nabokov were the favoured candidates that year."
