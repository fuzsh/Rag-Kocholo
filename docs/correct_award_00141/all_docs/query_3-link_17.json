He wrote various books of poetry, including Nomad (1931), Natur (1934), Passad (1945), Cikada (1953), Gr채sen I Thule (1958), Vagnen (1960), and Tuvor (1973). Martinson also wrote fiction, travel books혰the most famous of which is the renowned Kap Farv채l (Cape Farewell)혰and volumes of nature essays, three of which were written in the 1930s, long before such interest in environmental issues became more commonplace."
