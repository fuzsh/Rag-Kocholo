        "text": "(1900–76). The working-class novelist Eyvind Johnson not only brought new themes and points of view to Swedish literature but also experimented with new forms and techniques. With Harry Martinson he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1974.\n\nJohnson was born on July 29, 1900, in Svartbjörnsbyn, near Boden, Sweden. After a grim boyhood of hard labor in his home region near the Arctic Circle, Johnson, as a youth of 20 with practically no schooling, made his way south into war-devastated Western Europe. He was never quite happy on his visits home because of Sweden’s readiness to ignore the misery at its borders.\n\nJohnson wrote more than 40 novels and short-story collections. His early novels, in which the influence of Marcel Proust, André Gide, and James Joyce can be discerned, are mainly concerned with feelings of frustration. In Bobinack (1932), an exposé of the machinations of modern capitalism, Regn i gryningen (1933; Rain at Daybreak), an attack on modern office drudgery and its effects, and the four-volume Romanen om Olof (1934–37), which tells of his experiences as a logger in the sub-Arctic, he began to seek out the causes for that frustration. During World War II and immediately preceding it, Johnson’s novels took the form of intense protest against totalitarian terror and sharp attacks against neutralism. Strändernas svall (1946; Return to Ithaca) and Hans nädes tid (1960; The Days of His Grace) have been translated into many languages. He died on Aug. 25, 1976, in Stockholm."
