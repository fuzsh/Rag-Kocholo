        "text": "Eyvind Johnson (born July 29, 1900, Svartbjörnsbyn, near Boden, Sweden—died Aug. 25, 1976, Stockholm) was one of the few working-class novelists to bring not only new themes and points of view to Swedish literature but also to experiment with new forms and techniques of the most advanced kind. With Harry Edmund Martinson he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1974.\n\nAfter a grim boyhood of hard labour in his home region near the Arctic Circle, Johnson, as a youth of 20 with practically no schooling, made his way south into war-devastated western Europe. He was never quite happy on his visits home because of Sweden’s readiness to ignore the misery at its borders. His early novels, in which the influence of Proust, Gide, and Joyce can be discerned, are mainly concerned with man’s frustration. In Bobinack (1932), an exposé of the machinations of modern capitalism, Regn i gryningen (1933; “Rain at Daybreak”), an attack on modern office drudgery and its effects, and Romanen om Olof, 4 vol. (1934–37), which tells of his experiences as a logger in the sub-Arctic, he begins to seek out the causes for that frustration. During World War II and immediately preceding it, Johnson’s novels took the form of intense protest against totalitarian terror and sharp attacks against neutralism. Strändernas svall (1946; Return to Ithaca, 1952) and Hans nädes tid (1960; The Days of His Grace) have been translated into many languages."
