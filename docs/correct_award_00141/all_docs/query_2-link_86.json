        "text": "Swedish poet Tomas Gösta Transtromer has emerged winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nWinner of the £942,000 prize (largest in the world of books), Transtromer has again brought Sweden to literary limelight as the last Swede to win the literature Nobel was in 1974, when Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson took the prize jointly.\n\nBorn on April 15, 1931 in Stockholm, Tomas Gösta Tranströmer was raised alone by his mother after she divorced his father- a journalist. He received a degree in psychology from Stockholm University and later divided his time between poetry and his work as a psychologist working with the disabled, convicts and drug addicts while, at the same time, producing a large body of poetic work.\n\nPeter Englund, permanent secretary of the Nobel committee said Transtromer’s work was chosen “because, through his condensed, translucent images, he gives us fresh access to reality” he also said and “you can never feel small after reading the poetry of Tomas Tranströmer – he’s also exquisite when it comes to language”.\n\nIn Sweden he has been called a ‘buzzard poet’ because his haunting, visionary poetry shows the world from a height, in a mystic dimension, but brings every detail of the natural world into sharp focus. His poems are often explorations of the borderland between sleep and waking, between the conscious and unconscious states. Transtromer’s most famous works include the 1966 “Windows and Stones,” in which he depicts themes from his many travels and “Baltics” from 1974.\n\nHis works have been translated into more than 50 languages and influenced poets around the globe, particularly in North America. More\n\nBelow is an excerpt of his work The Half-Finished Heaven (Culled from Graywolf Press)\n\nStorm\n\nThe man on a walk suddenly meets the old\n\ngiant oak like an elk turned to stone with\n\nits enormous antlers against the dark green castle wall\n\nof the fall ocean.\n\nStorm from the north. It’s nearly time for the\n\nrowanberries to ripen. Awake in the night he\n\nhears the constellations far above the oak\n\nstamping in their stalls.\n\nThe Half-Finished Heaven\n\nCowardice breaks off on its path.\n\nAnguish breaks off on its path.\n\nThe vulture breaks off in its flight.\n\nThe eager light runs into the open,\n\neven the ghosts take a drink.\n\nAnd our paintings see the air,\n\nred beasts of the ice-age studios.\n\nEverything starts to look around.\n\nWe go out in the sun by hundreds.\n\nEvery person is a half-open door\n\nleading to a room for everyone.\n\nThe endless field under us.\n\nWater glitters between the trees.\n\nThe lake is a window into the earth.\n\nTwo Cities\n\nThere is a stretch of water, a city on each side\n\none of them utterly dark, where enemies live.\n\nLamps are burning in the other.\n\nThe well-lit shore hypnotizes the dark shore."
