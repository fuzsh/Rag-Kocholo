Eyvind Johnson was a writer with a distinct penchant for epic storytelling. His is a wide choice of themes from Greek antique – Strändernas svall, a modern rewrite of the Odyssey – to his tough childhood environment in Norrbotten as depicted in his suite of novels about Olof. His deep-felt commitment to contemporary crucial moral and political issues consistently placed him in opposition to dictatorships and abuse of individual human beings. Johnson was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1974.

The Days of his Grace is a historic novel set in Carolingian times. The protagonist is Johannes Lupigis who belongs to the Longobard people vanquished by Charlemagne. Lupigis is accepted into service at Charlemagne’s court and makes a career as the emperor’s secret secretary. In a modernistic, complex narrative structure built up on a leitmotif technique and interposed sections of prose-lyric, the reader participates in the protagonist’s life story and the destiny of his people. There is an abyss between the smiling secretary’s resigned, courteous attitude and his inner self where the screams of vanquished and prisoners will not be silenced. The novel underpins the universal questions on the attitude of a text to power and history. But it also paints a personal picture of the secretary, revealing hints of Eyvind Johnson’s own character.
