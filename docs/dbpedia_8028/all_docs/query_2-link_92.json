        "text": "A Love Affair With Sri Lanka\n\nIn December 1954, Clarke first visited Colombo, Sri Lanka, which at the time was called Ceylon, and he turned his attention from the sky to the sea. The first SCUBA equipment began appearing around this time, and Clarke said, “When the first skin-diving equipment started to appear in the late 1940s, I suddenly realized that here was a cheap and simple way of imitating one of the most magical aspects of spaceflight – weightlessness.”\n\nClarke discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram temple off the coast of Trincomalee, which he described in his 1957 book The Reefs of Taprobane. That was his second diving book after 1956’s The Coast of Coral.\n\nFuturism\n\nIn 1958, Clarke began a series of magazine essays that eventually became the 1962 book Profiles of the Future. In the book, Clarke described a “global library”, hundreds of TV channels available anywhere on the planet, and a “personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one.”\n\nClarke wrote that “the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialing a number,” and that such a device would include means for global positioning so that “no one need ever again be lost.” He even predicted that such a device would be invented in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn a 1974 interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Clarke was asked what life would be like for the interviewer’s son in the year 2001. Clarke responded:\n\n“He will have, in his own house, … a [computer] console through which he can talk, through his friendly local computer and get all the information he needs for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theater reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house … and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone.”\n\n“Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” — Arthur C. Clarke\n\nDuring the Apollo 11, 12 and 15 missions, Clarke joined broadcaster Walter Cronkite and ex-astronaut Wally Schirra as a commentator on the CBS network. In 1973, Clarke published the novel Rendezvous with Rama, which swept all the science fiction book awards that year.\n\nIn 1982, Clarke published a sequel to 2001 entitled 2010: Odyssey Two and he worked with writer/director Peter Hyams on the 1984 movie version by using a modem while he was in Sri Lanka and Hyams was in Los Angeles.\n\nClarke turned their communications into the book The Odyssey File – The Making of 2010 which described his awe at being able to communicate on a daily basis with someone on the opposite side of the world.\n\nIn 1981, Clarke created a thirteen-part TV series entitled Arthur C. Clarke’s Mysterious World, and in 1984, he created Arthur C. Clarke’s World of Strange Powers."
