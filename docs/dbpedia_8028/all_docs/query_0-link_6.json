He was born in Minehead on 16 December 1917 and died in Sri Lanka in 2008.\n\nJohn Knight, 16, said: \"We're intending to get a nine-foot high black granite monolith.\"\n\nHe said he wanted the monolith placed in Blenheim Gardens in the town.\n\nWest Somerset Council said if John can prove there is public interest, his idea can be explored further.\n\nThe teenager is a fan of science fiction, having collected most of Sir Arthur's works."
