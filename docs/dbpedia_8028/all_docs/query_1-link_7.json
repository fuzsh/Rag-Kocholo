        "text": "(1917–2008). The release in 1968 of the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey gave international fame to Arthur C. Clarke, a science fiction writer whose reputation was already well established. His interest in science, however, went beyond fiction: his theories about satellite communications were borne out when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Early Bird synchronous satellite in 1965.\n\nArthur Charles Clarke was born on Dec. 16, 1917, at Minehead in Somerset, England. His interest in science developed in early childhood, and his fascination with science fiction began in about 1930. Lacking money for college, Clarke worked in a government office in a job that left leisure to pursue his interest in space science. During World War II, as a radar instructor for the Royal Air Force, he published his first science fiction stories. In 1945 he wrote an article, “Extra-Terrestrial Relays,” describing a satellite system that would relay radio and television signals around the world. Released from the air force in 1946, Clarke enrolled in King’s College, University of London. He received a bachelor of science degree in physics and mathematics in 1948.\n\nAmong the better-known of his science fiction works were Childhood’s End, published in 1953, A Fall of Moondust (1961), The Fountains of Paradise (1979), and the short story “The Sentinel” (1951), on which 2001: A Space Odyssey was based. Clarke and the movie’s director, Stanley Kubrick, developed the short story into a novel (1968), published under the same name as the film. A sequel novel, 2010: Odyssey Two (1982), by Clarke alone, was released as a film in 1984, and in 1997 he published 3001: The Final Odyssey.\n\nDuring the 1950s Clarke developed an interest in undersea exploration. From a home base in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), he embarked on a career of skin diving and underwater photography, later described in a series of books beginning with The Coast of Coral (1956). He also wrote several nonfiction books on space. Clarke was knighted in 2000. He died on March 19, 2008, in Colombo, Sri Lanka."
