        "text": "The Quantocks, an area measuring about 12 miles by three, covering about 38 square miles, run from the coast through the Somerset hills to Taunton. Offering plenty of walking opportunities and pretty villages to explore, the region abounds with history – and a fair few literary connections, we discovered.\n\nWe were spending a week here, starting at Home Farm Holiday Centre in Williton on the Somerset coast. The best motorhome sites will provide plenty of facilities, and this large campsite didn’t disappoint. It’s ideal for anyone who is touring with pets, as there are three dog-walking fields.\n\nAs well as this, there is an indoor pool (which we didn’t use as the weather was so good), an on-site bar and beer garden (which we did use as the weather was so good!) and sea views.\n\nThe seaside motorhome site also boasts a glorious stretch of beach at St Audries Bay, one of several beaches in the region where dogs are allowed all year.\n\nWillow the pup had fun exploring the rock pools, while Ro and I enjoyed a gentle wander along the beach and a spot of fossil hunting – incredible to think that even us amateurs\n\ncan find evidence of creatures who lived here millions of years ago.\n\nThe heritage railway\n\nThe heritage West Somerset Railway runs past Williton, the station reminiscent of its Victorian heyday and the first of our ‘bookish’ discoveries of the week. Those with a keen eye for children’s TV might recognise the line as the setting for the 1988 film of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, when it took the children from London (Minehead) into the country (Crowcombe Heathfield).\n\nThe steam timetable was limited during our stay (just outside the main summer season), so next morning, we drove there and settled for a quick look at the station before driving to the coast.\n\nFirst stop, the harbour town of Watchet (also on the railway line), 10 minutes from Williton. Happily for Ro – he does love a mooch around a market – there was a street market in full swing. With stalls selling everything from tribal wall hangings to handmade fudge, it made a diverting change from the usual shops.\n\nWatchet has a history stretching back to Alfred the Great, and a museum telling its story. It was also the inspiration for Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner – our second literary find. He lived nearby and came across Watchet on a walk with William and Dorothy Wordsworth. Today, a statue of said Ancient Mariner sits on the harbour as testament to this part of its history and to the Quantocks becoming known as the birthplace of Romantic poetry.\n\nBut it was time to continue our journey – next stop, lunch at a seaside café in Blue Anchor Bay, beside its wide, sandy beach. It was here that Willow made the discovery that cemented her love for the seaside – peanut butter flavour doggy ice cream is her new favourite thing!\n\nDestination Dunster\n\nAnd then to our ultimate destination for the day. Home to another West Somerset Railway station, Dunster is famous for its 1000-year-old castle (now a family home) and working watermill.\n\nThe castle gardens riverside walk was just magical, feeling almost prehistoric in places as sunlight streamed through giant rhubarb, yew trees and a fine specimen of the rare handkerchief tree (apparently the seeds were smuggled into the UK from South Africa in the handbag of a previous owner of the castle, Alys Luttrell).\n\nThere is also an orangery and a swan pond, among other charming features to be enjoyed here. Some paths might be a little difficult for the less mobile, though. There is plenty to see inside the castle, too, including the Leather Gallery, the library and, if you are brave, the haunted crypt.\n\nWe then made the happy discovery that another children’s TV series, Enid Blyton’s Famous Five, was filmed in and around Dunster and its castle – cue our own adventure as Julian, Anne and Timmy! Frivolities over, we paid a quick visit to the Stables Shop and the working watermill (a Grade II listed building), where I bought some flour, before strolling around the village.\n\nA late afternoon coffee at Tessa’s Tea Shop and a quick photo opportunity at the Yarn Market and Packhorse Bridge completed a great day out.\n\nHeading to the Quantock Hills\n\nNext day, we ventured into the Quantock Hills. A quick look at my map offered up the intriguing Dead Woman’s Ditch and Robin Upright’s Hill.\n\nSitting in the middle of the Quantocks, this seemed the perfect place for a walk. Despite the name, Dead Woman’s Ditch turned out to be a prehistoric earthwork near Over Stowey, and yes, perfect walking in oak woods and heathland.\n\nFrom the top, there are fantastic views over the Bristol Channel, the Gower Peninsula and beyond. It is easy to see why this was Britain’s first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and provided such inspiration to Coleridge and Wordsworth.\n\nThere is also a 51-mile hiking trail named after Coleridge, which winds its way from his home at Nether Stowey to the coastal town of Porlock.\n\nA more recent wordsmith, Bryan Adams, filmed the video for ‘Everything I Do’, the song that spent a gazillion weeks at number one, in these hills and on our neighbouring beach at Kilve (dog friendly and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, thanks to its many fossils) – inspiration for all!\n\nHaving enjoyed a walk in the countryside and met some local ponies in the car park, we drove back to the site via Nether Stowey, so we decided to stop and see where some of Coleridge’s most famous works, including Kubla Khan, were written. The village is only small, but as well as the poet’s house, it is also home to a Victorian clock tower and a ruined castle.\n\nThen it was feet-up time on our pitch, and a chance to make the most of the warm evening with a barbecue – check out our best motorhome barbecue guide if you’re looking for one to take on tour with you.\n\nA ramble in one of the site’s dog-walking fields completed another enjoyable day in the Quantocks.\n\nAncient oaks\n\nAnother day, another excellent walk, and this time we were off to Woodlands Hill, an area of ancient oak woods, with Iron Age hill forts giving it an added air of mystery and timelessness.\n\nI could easily imagine our ancestors carving out a living where now there are just bridleways and footpaths. This included the business of burning oak to form charcoal, notably for use by the Royal Navy, and although this practice had pretty much ceased by the beginning of the 20th century, these days, it has left a legacy of gnarled branches that really adds to the ambience.\n\nWe were lucky enough to encounter a couple of majestic red deer quietly grazing, although they were too deeply hidden in the undergrowth to capture on camera. Our reward for reaching the hilltop was more of those splendid views.\n\nOnce again, we found ourselves following in the footsteps of Coleridge and the Wordsworths – Dorothy specifically mentions their love for Woodlands Hill in her journal.\n\nEarlier, we had passed a pub, The Hood Arms, and after working up an appetite – and a thirst – on our thoroughly enjoyable walk, decided to call in there for dinner. That was a good decision!\n\nThis welcoming pub has a really lovely beer garden, furnished with a boules court. Oh, and of course, it was often frequented by that famous pair of poets we seemed to be following around.\n\nThen it was time for us to leave Home Farm for the southern fringes of the Quantocks at Taunton, and yet more bookish connections.\n\nOur home for the next two nights was Tanpits Cider Farm, just 40 minutes from the coast but a world away in terms of the landscape.\n\nNow we were in the midst of an apple orchard, with peacocks and guinea fowl running free, a river and a canal flowing past, and a bustling market town just a couple of miles away.\n\nLiterary connections\n\nOur journey south took us past the village of Combe Florey, of interest to yours truly because it was where Evelyn Waugh, author of Brideshead Revisited (a book that I had the dubious pleasure of studying for my A Level Literature) lived, in the very grand Combe Florey House.\n\nMore literary connections can be found just a few miles south of there, in Bishops Lydeard, home to Arthur C Clarke, who was born nearby at Minehead. Clarke went to school in Taunton, our final destination on this trip. I was beginning to realise just how rich and varied the literary links in the Quantocks have been.\n\nCamping in the orchard\n\nArriving at Tanpits, we were left to choose our own spot among the apple trees. As the weather was still glorious, we decided to spend our first afternoon on site, relaxing and sampling the farm’s liquid produce – sometimes you have to just stop and do a little bit of nothing very much, except enjoy the wonderful sunshine and scents of an English summertime.\n\nNext day brought a few showers, but that didn’t dampen our spirits – this is England and we are campers, after all! We walked along the water’s edge into Taunton, where we window-shopped and visited the Museum of Somerset, housed in the old Taunton Castle. Here we learnt something of the origins of the town, which date all the way back to the seventh century.\n\nIt was a centre for the wool trade in medieval times, and came under siege during the Civil War in the 1600s. The Victorian era saw the arrival of the railway and renewed popularity for the town.\n\nCanalside walk and dinner\n\nReturning to Tanpits, we had time to freshen up before taking the 10-minute stroll along the canal to The New Mill pub for dinner – seabass for me, steak for Ro and a couple of dog treats from the friendly staff for Willow (dogs are only allowed in the garden and bar, not the restaurant).\n\nThen all too soon, our Quantocks sojourn was over. It is easy to see why this area is so popular with walkers and holidaymakers, and why it has been the source of so much literary inspiration.\n\nThis is the perfect destination for enjoying the great outdoors, as well as some ancient English history, and we will be back next time we fancy pursuing a few days of leisurely walking in the hills – or perhaps even writing some poetry.\n\nWhen to go to the Quantocks\n\nWe toured the Quantocks in June, but there is plenty to see and do in the area whenever you choose to visit. Bear in mind, though, that the coastal resorts can get quite busy during the peak season.\n\nWhere we stayed in the Quantocks\n\nHome Farm Holiday Centre\n\nSt Audries Bay, Williton, Somerset TA4 4DP\n\nTanpits Cider Farm\n\nDyers Lane, Bathpool TA2 8BZ\n\nFind out more about the Quantocks\n\nQuantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\nHiking trails\n\nThe Coleridge Way\n\nDunster Castle\n\nColeridge Cottage\n\nWest Somerset Railway\n\nThe Museum of Somerset\n\nLead image: Sue Taylor\n\nHead to our Best of British: Touring Adventures category to find more great travel ideas and inspiration."
