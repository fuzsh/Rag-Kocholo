        "text": "British government office\n\nThe office of High Sheriff of Somerset is an ancient shrievalty which has been in existence since the 11th century.[1] Originally known as the \"Sheriff of Somerset\", the role was retitled on 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972.[2]\n\nThe position of Sheriff was once a powerful one, the holders being responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing law and order in Somerset, a county in South West England. In modern times the sheriff has become a ceremonial officer of the Crown, attending or presiding over many public events. Until 1567 the Sheriff of Somerset was also Sheriff of Dorset.[3]\n\nIn England, Wales, and Northern Ireland the high sheriff is theoretically the Sovereign's judicial representative in the county, while the Lord Lieutenant is the Sovereign's personal representative.[4] Their jurisdictions, the \"shrieval counties\", are no longer co-terminous with administrative areas, representing a mix between the ancient counties and more recent local authority areas. The post is unpaid, except for a small court attendance allowance, and the general expenses of the office are borne personally by the holder.[5] Eligibility for nomination and appointment of High Sheriffs is controlled by the Sheriffs Act of 1887.\n\nThe current high sheriff is Rob Beckley MstJ QPM.[6]\n\nSheriffs of Somerset 11th century\n\n[edit]\n\nc1061 Godwine[7]\n\n1066-1068 Tovid or Tofig[7]\n\n1083-1086 William de Moyon[7]\n\nSheriffs of Somerset and Dorset\n\n[edit]\n\n11th and 12th century\n\n[edit]\n\n13th century\n\n[edit]\n\n14th century\n\n[edit]\n\noooo\n\n15th century\n\n[edit]\n\n16th century\n\n[edit]\n\nSheriffs of Somerset\n\n[edit]\n\n16th and 17th century\n\n[edit]\n\n18th century\n\n[edit]\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nHigh Sheriff of Somerset\n\n[edit]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
