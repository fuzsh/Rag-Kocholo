Exchequer & Audit Department in 1936, and served in the Royal Air Force during World War IL While operating the prototype Ground Control Approach radar system, he conceived the basic theory of communication satellites, and published the concept in 1945.\n\nAfter demobilization, he took a first class honors degree in physics and mathematics at King's College, London, which later elected him as a fellow. From 1948 to 1950 he was assistant editor of Physics Abstracts, a publication of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. Twice he was chairman of the British Interplanetary Society-1946-1947, and 1950-1953.\n\nSince 1954 his interest in underwater exploration has taken him to the Great Barrier Reef of Australia and the Indian Ocean; he is now a director of the Colombo-based \"Underwater Safaris.\"\n\nHe has published more than 70 books and made many appearances on radio and television, most notably with Walter Cronkite on CBS during the NASA Apollo missions. His 13-part \"Mysterious World\" and \"Strange Powers\" television programs have been seen worldwide, and reappear frequently on PBS in the US.\n\nHe is a council member of the Society of Authors, a vice president of the H.G. Wells Society, and a member of many other scientific and literary organizations. He was nominated for an \"Oscar\" for the screenplay of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nClarke has lived in Sri Lanka for the past 30 years, and in 1979 was appointed Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa by President Jayewardene. The university, near Colombo, is the location of the government-established Arthur C. Clarke Centre for Modern Technologies, specializing in communications and computers. He is also chancellor of the International Space University.\n\nIn 1989 H.M. Queen Elizabeth awarded him a CBE for \"services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka.\" On returning to the UK in 1992 for his 75th birthday celebrations, he was made the first Freeman of his hometown, Minehead, Somerset.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBiographical\n\nClarke, Arthur C., Astounding Days -- A Science Fictional Autobiography, Bantam Books, New York, 1989.\n\nMcAleer, Neil, Odyssey: The Authorized Biography, Contemporary Books, Chicago, 1992.\n\nSignificant Publications\n\nClarke, Arthur C., \"The Obsolescence of Man,\" in Profiles of the Future, Harper Press, London, 1958.\n\nClarke, Arthur C., \"The Steam Powered Word Processor: A Forgotten Epic of Victorian Engineering,\" Analog, Vol. 106, No. 9, Sept. 1986, pp. 175-179.\n\nUPDATES\n\nArthur C.
