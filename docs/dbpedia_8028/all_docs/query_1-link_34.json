        "text": "Today is the 103rd (posthumous) birthday of Sir Arthur Charles Clarke CBE FRAS (16 December 1917 – 19 March 2008), the English science-fiction writer, science writer, visionary, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.\n\nBest known for writing the screenplay along with Stanley Kubrick, for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clarke wrote many books and many essays for popular magazines. Clarke's science and science-fiction writings earned him the moniker \"Prophet of the Space Age.\" For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov were known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction.\n\nHis technology predictions included geo-stationary satellites, home computers, cell-phones and GPS.\n\nClarke emigrated from England to Sri Lanka in 1956, to pursue his interest in scuba diving and to continue writing; he lived there until his death. In his biography of Stanley Kubrick, John Baxter cites Clarke's homosexuality as a reason why he relocated, due to more tolerant laws with regard to homosexuality in Sri Lanka. en.wikipedia.org/...\n\nI presume many of you have read one or more of his books, a few of which are shown in the tweet below.\n\nx\n\nLet’s celebrate his birthday with a few tributes, images and some of his writings.\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey, the iconic science-fiction masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick premiered on April 2 in 1968 at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C. The film was inspired by the short story \"The Sentinel\" by Arthur C. Clarke, who also co-wrote the screenplay.\n\nIt is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a science-fiction story like no other, deeply engaging and thought-provoking. Even with long periods without dialogue (the first and last 20 minutes have zero dialogue), the slow-paced film, which deals with space travel, technology, artificial intelligence, human evolution, existentialism and the possibility of extraterrestrial life, keeps you riveted, almost in a trance, throughout its 142 minute length.\n\nx\n\nx\n\nCheck out the interesting article about the movie in the link below.\n\nx\n\nThe Moon scene with music by György Ligeti, featuring the Monolith.\n\nx\n\nYouTube Video\n\nPerhaps the most enigmatic scene from the movie -\n\nx\n\nYouTube Video\n\nThe ending featuring the Star Child and a new beginning -\n\nx\n\nYouTube Video\n\nSelected Quotes\n\nI don't believe in astrology; I'm a Sagittarius and we're skeptical.\n\nOne of the great tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion. So now people assume that religion and morality have a necessary connection. But the basis of morality is really very simple and doesn't require religion at all.\n\nHow inappropriate to call this planet \"Earth,\" when it is clearly \"Ocean.”\n\nI'm sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here.\n\nTwo possibilities exist; either we are alone in the universe or we not. Both are equally terrifying.\n\nBefore you become too entranced with gorgeous gadgets and mesmerizing video displays, let me remind you that information is not knowledge, knowledge is not wisdom, and wisdom is not foresight. Each grows out of the other, and we need them all.\n\nThe only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible.\n\nAll these worlds are yours. Except Europa. Attempt no landing there. (2010: Odyssey Two)\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nBut please remember: this is only a work of fiction. The truth, as always, will be far stranger.\n\nEpilogue\n\nIt is interesting how writers and readers thought so romantically about space, space travel and extra-terrestrial civilizations in the 60’s and 70’s, at the dawn of the space exploration age. Nowadays, we are happy to see rockets lift off earth, while folks at that time dreamed of the colonization of far away planets and galaxies, of advanced civilizations and of our interactions with them.\n\nWhat are your memories about Arthur C. Clarke? Which of his books have you read and which ones influenced you most?\n\nFurther Reading"
