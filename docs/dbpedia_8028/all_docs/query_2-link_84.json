Gender: M\n\nborn on 16 December 1917 at 06:00 (= 06:00 AM ) Place Minehead, England, 51n13, 3w29 Timezone GMT h0e (is standard time) Data source\n\nAccuracy in question\n\nRodden Rating C Collector: Starkman\n\nAstrology data 23°44' 17°39 Asc. 26°59'\n\nBiography\n\nBritish science fiction writer, science writer, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host. He is perhaps most famous for being co-writer of the screenplay for the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) by Stanley Kubrick, considered by the American Film Institute to be one of the most influential films of all time. His other science fiction writings earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, along with a large readership, making him into one of the towering figures of the field.\n\nClarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934 while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system—an idea that, in 1963, won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal. Later he was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–47 and again in 1951–53.\n\nClarke was also a science writer, who was both an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability, who won a Kalinga Prize (award given by UNESCO for popularising science) in 1961. These all together eventually earned him the moniker \"prophet of the space age\".\n\nClarke emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956, largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving and the culture more tolerant of homosexuality than the US. That year he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee.\n\nClarke augmented his fame later on in the 1980s, by being the host of several television shows such as Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World.\n\nHe lived in Sri Lanka until his death. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005. He died 19 March 2008.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nbusiness associate/partner relationship with Kubrick, Stanley (born 26 July 1928).
