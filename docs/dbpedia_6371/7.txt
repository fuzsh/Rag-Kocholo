Synopsis

Bangalore's Namma Metro, managed by BMRCL, plans to launch the Yellow Line by year-end, a shift from earlier plans for fewer trains at longer intervals. The Rs 5,745-crore project spans 19.15 km with 16 stations, including the towering Jayadeva Hospital interchange hub. Trial operations with a Chinese prototype began in June, aiming for full service by December pending sufficient trains from CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co Ltd and Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd.

The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL), responsible for Bengaluru's Namma Metro, announced plans to inaugurate the Yellow Line by the end of this year, as reported by the Deccan Herald. This decision marks a departure from earlier projections, which anticipated the line's debut with fewer trains running at longer intervals.

Key developments include the nearing completion of major civil and system works for the Rs 5,745-crore Yellow Line project. Extending over 19.15 kilometres from RV Road to Bommasandra, the line encompasses 16 stations, including pivotal stops such as Jayadeva Hospital, BTM Layout, Silk Board Junction, and Electronics City.

Of particular note is Jayadeva Hospital, which will double as an interchange hub and stand as India's tallest metro station, towering at 39 meters. The station features a comprehensive six-level structure comprising an underpass, road, flyover, Yellow Line platform, concourse, and Pink Line platform.

Trial operations on the Yellow Line commenced on June 13, employing a prototype six-coach train imported from China earlier this year. These trials encompass critical tests for oscillation and safety, expected to conclude by September or October, paving the way for commercial services to commence by December, contingent upon the availability of sufficient trains.

China’s CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co Ltd is tasked with supplying a total of 216 coaches for the Yellow Line, equating to 36 trains valued at ₹1,578 crore. While initial production of twelve coaches occurs in China, the remaining coaches are being assembled in West Bengal by CRRC's Indian partner, Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd (TRSL). Manufacturing began on May 18, with the first six-coach train from TRSL slated to arrive in Bengaluru by mid-August.
