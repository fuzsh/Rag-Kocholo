Occasionally I need to head to that part of town and so far I've been getting down at Kengeri and walking to past the NICE road junction. So I'm just glad this one is open, finally!\n\nAbout the larger issue of actually making the stations more accessible and usable, well, after using the Metro pretty regularly since it opened in 2011, it's pretty obvious that BMRCL thinks their job ends just running the trains. And to be fair, that's a pretty humongous job. Always wondered though, when we can execute the really massive engineering jobs, why not do the small stuff that makes a public transportation system really people-friendly?\n\nFix the footpaths, make sure all entry/exits are open (till recently, one of the entry/exits at the Indiranagar metro station would remain closed for most of the day, leading to crowding at the other entry. The reason- not enough people to man the exit! After spending 100s of crores on the Metro, why not just employ some people at salaries of what, a few thousands a month?!), anticipate the huge crowds at Yeshwantpur and have more screening/scanning machines, instead of having queues extend till outside the station in the morning. (Or better yet- do away with the damn 'security screening', it's eyewash. Indian Railway stations run without that anyway.) Things like that.\n\nBut, it's great that the new stations are finally running. The finer points I'm afraid are going to take time. Need not be that way, but that's the reality. (This stuff would get fixed faster if someone high up in BMRCL actually starts using the Metro regularly themselves!)\n\nLast edited by am1m : 11th October 2023 at 14:10."
