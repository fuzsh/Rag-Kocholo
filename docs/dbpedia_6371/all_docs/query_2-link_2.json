        "text": "Awarded in 2009, the contract confirms Alstoms commitment to develop Indias urban transport infrastructure\n\nControl & Signaling system designed to provide unparalleled safety to the Namma Metro Network\n\nThis milestone an illustration of highly competent teams of Astom in Bangalore, capable of executing global projects\n\nAlstom is proud to be associated with the Bangalore's most-awaited and prestigious infrastructure project Bangalore Metro rail. The first line of Bangalore metro, also called Namma metro was inaugurated by Union Minister for Urban Development, Shri Kamal Nath and Shri D.V Sadananda Gowda, Honorable Chief Minister of Karnataka, on October 20, 2011 in Bangalore.\n\nWeaving through the bustling commercial and residential areas of the city, Bangalore metro consists of two corridors of double electrified lines, covering a total of 42.30 km. The first line corresponds to an East-West corridor of 18.10 km. long, starting from Baiyappanahalli and terminating at Mysore Road terminal. The portion inaugurated goes from M.G Road station, in the city centre, to Baiyappanahalli station in the eastern suburb. It covers 6.7 km on elevated tracks and represents four stations. The inauguration took place at Field Marshal Manekshaw Parade Ground, in Bangalore.\n\nAwarded in 2009 to Alstom and its consortium partners, by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL), the contract covered design, manufacturing, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of modern signaling train control and telecommunication systems for two corridor lines (42 km, 40 stations). It also included the supply of two depots, one Operation Control Centre (OCC) and one Back up Operation Control Center (BCC). The contract represents a total amount of 114 million, Alstoms share representing around 76 million.\n\nAlstom has provided design, manufacturing, supply, installing, testing and commissioning of the train control and signaling systems. Alstom especially supplied its Automatic Train Control System Urbalis. A global urban network management solution, Urbalis automatically controls train movements, optimizing traffic flows and intervals between trains, guaranteeing passenger safety and improving the commercial efficiency of the line. It ensures optimal safety, flexible operations and heightened passenger comfort. This fully proven solution has been successfully deployed in many cities in the world. In India, Alstom has supplied the same solution to New Delhi metro line 1 and 2 and their extensions.\n\nKnown as the Silicon Valley of India because of the presence of large number of information technology companies, Bangalores rapid growth has created several problems relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence. Namma metro will help solve the commuting challenges faced by the residents of Bangalore as the metro rail network will work in tandem with other existing transport systems.\n\nThe Bangalore Metro has been designed for a capacity of 40,000 passengers per hour and per direction. The number of passengers expected to travel on the metro network everyday is estimated at 1 million, and could reach 1,6 million in 2021.\n\nCommenting on the occasion, Jojo Alexander, Managing Director, Alstom Transport, India, said, Alstom is committed to develop Indias urban transport infrastructure as the country embarks on its rail expansion initiatives. This milestone is a clear illustration of Alstoms highly competitive and dedicated engineering team in Bangalore, capable of executing global projects for urban & mainline signaling. It also showcases close co-operation between Bangalore team and other Alstom units : Coimbatore in India, Saint-Ouen and Villeurbanne in France, Bologna in Italy. We thank BMRCL (Bangalore Metro Railway Corporation Limited) for the opportunity to partner with them in this prestigious project. Our investment in Bangalore for signaling technologies is a testimony of our renewed commitment in India, a market on which Alstom has been present for a century. The fact that the Bangalore metro inauguration coincides with Alstom Indias centennial year celebrations is in itself a matter of great pride for us.\n\nBMRCL Spokesperson BLY Chavan, said, As the backbone of the citys public transport, the Namma Metro aims to solve the traffic challenges by reducing the travel time, providing easier mobility at an affordable price for the residents of Bangalore. We are delighted to have been able to work with Alstom and its consortium partners to enable the introduction of Namma Metro which will significantly improve the travel experience for passengers in Bangalore.\n\nThis project confirms that Alstom, as a multi-specialist/multi-geographic company, is well positioned to respond to all opportunities arising from one of the largest railway market in the world. Alstom was awarded in 2010 its first rolling stock contract in India by the Chennai Metro Rail for the supply of 168 cars in which the first deliveries of are planned for the end of 2012. The company was also chosen in 2011 to supply the track works for Chennais metro line.\n\nBy the end of 2012, train passenger numbers in India are expected to increase to 8.4 billion per annum. Indian Railways current five-year plan foresees investments of approximately 39 billion until 2012. Today, forty-five Indian cities are above 1 million inhabitants and more than 10 urban projects are in progress or planned in Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kochi, Jaipur and Kolkata.\n\nAbout Alstom Transport\n\nA promoter of sustainable mobility, Alstom Transport develops and markets the most complete range of systems, equipment and services in the railway sector.
