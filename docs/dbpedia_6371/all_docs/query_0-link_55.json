        "text": "The extension of Namma Metro's Green Line from Nagasandra to Madavara, previously referred to as the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) line, is slated for operation by July 2024. This elevated stretch, spanning from Nagasandra to Madavara, encompasses three stations ? Manjunathnagar, Chikkabidarakallu, and Madavara.\n\nWith the majority of the construction work completed, the final stages involve track laying and other minor tasks related to the stations. The subsequent steps include conducting trial runs of trains and inspections by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety.\n\nThe construction of the fully elevated Green Line's northern extension, covering a distance of three kilometers from Nagasandra, commenced in 2017. Originally targeted for completion in mid-2019, delays in land acquisition hindered progress, causing the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) to miss its set deadlines.\n\nBMRCL inaugurated the southern extension of the Green Line from Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute on Kanakapura Road in January 2021. Once the extended stretch to BIEC becomes operational, the total length of the Green Line will reach 33 km, benefiting a significant number of commuters on this line."
