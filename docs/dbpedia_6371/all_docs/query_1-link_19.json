        "text": "The Namma Metro, more commonly known as the Bangalore Metro, is a rapid transit system in the city of Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The agency responsible for its implementation is Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL). The Bangalore Metro has six lines and 81 stations, with an entire network of lines covering 114.39 km in length. More than 40,000 passengers use the Metro each day. SIGNON drafted a simulation study for the network calculation and verification of the scope for the initial phase railway power supply, which comprises the east-west corridor (Mysore Road Terminal – Baiyyappanhalli, length 18 km) and the north-south corridor (Hassergatta Cross – Puttenhalli, length 21 km), with regard to the power requirements for the requested train operation. This was completed subject to the following premises:"
