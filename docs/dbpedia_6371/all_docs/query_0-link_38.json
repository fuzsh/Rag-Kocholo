        "text": "The trial runs for Namma Metro’s 19-km Yellow Line begins from R V Road to Bommasandra today.\n\nThis includes testing a prototype of a driverless train on the mainline.\n\nBL Yeshwanth Chavan, chief PRO of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), told ToI that the trial will start at 10:30 am. Tests such as traction break, full loaded sand bang, signalling, and oscillation trials by RDSO (Research Design and Standard Organisation) will be conducted on the mainlines.\n\n“We’ve completed various static tests at the depot after receiving the train from China,” said Chavan.\n\n“The mainline tests start Thursday. After RDSO tests, results will go to the railway board through Commissioner Metro Railway Safety (CMRS). We need technical clearance from the railway board for this new rolling stock. CMRS will inspect safety once clearances are received. Commercial operations will begin after all approvals,” Chavan added.\n\nA locopilot will be onboard during tests. Around 37 tests need completion, taking about three to four months.\n\nHowever, BMRCL hasn’t confirmed when the Yellow Line will start running commercially. Launch plans depend on new coaches arriving from Kolkata-based Titagarh Rail Systems Limited (TRSL).\n\nInitially planned for last year, the launch was delayed to Feb-March 2024 due to coach delays. Only the prototype of the Yellow Line train has arrived. BMRCL expects coaches from Titagarh by August 2024, needing at least five trains for 15-minute frequency service.\n\nOpening the Yellow Line will connect Electronics City, a major IT and industrial area, to Namma Metro, easing daily traffic for thousands of employees."
