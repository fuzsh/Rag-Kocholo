        "text": "Besides using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) to excavate & build tunnels for running metro trains, civil contractors in all metro projects across the world also build cross-passage tunnels for providing passengers with an emergency escape route to the parallel tunnel and for performing maintenance work. These cross-passages are reinforced concrete structures and are typically found at regular intervals of every 250-400 meters depending upon the length of the tunnels between adjacent stations & soil characteristics.\n\nWork for building the passages are usually taken up only after the tunnels are built to ease working conditions and increase efficiency, but there have been times when work has commenced while tunneling is still in progress. Excavating them is always unpredictable, and the time for building these really depends on the soil, water & gas conditions, and sometimes on irate property owners who get concerned about the impact to their buildings above.\n\nMultiple methods exist to build them. Here’s a short informative video of one of them:\n\nThe upcoming 24.20 km Green Line in Bangalore has about 4.0 km of twin tunnels running through the heart of the city and the 1.5 km Sampige Road – Majestic section consists of two such passages being built by the CEC-SOMA-CICI JV that are in various stages of completion right now:\n\nNorth of Indian Railways’ line in Seshadripuram\n\nSouth of Seshadri Road on Dhanvantri Road\n\nIn this post, let’s take a look at the cross passage #2 on Dhanvantri Road. Unlike other sites where excavation starts from both tunnels and ends right in the center as seen in the above video, in this case, work started using the top-down approach and will end at both tunnels resulting in 2 breakthroughs. Piling works to build a shaft for it began in February 2016, a couple months after TBM Margarita made a breakthrough at the North Ramp and right after TBM Godavari passed by the site in the opposite direction towards the Majestic Station’s North Shaft.\n\nRecent satellite imagery of the Dhanvantri Road Shaft:\n\nSome images shot on the morning of August 2, 2016:\n\nWork is carried out by a hydraulic drill machine (seen in the 1st image) and sometimes low-grade explosives are also used to blast through the rock. The 2 breakthroughs are expected to take place in another month’s time after which workers will begin finishing works, covering up the shaft and back-filling it with soil.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nI just got back from a vacation which involved a lot of outdoor relaxation and have some catching up to do with mail, comments and news. In my absence, thanks to many readers for alerting me about the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation making their August newsletter available. Do check it out for a lot more images and data points which have been recorded at the start of the month – i.e. August 1.\n\nPhase 2\n\nNotable progress on piling work has taken place at the Rajarajeshwarinagar and Jnanabharathi stations since last month. However, 0 new notices inviting construction have been posted since May 2015. The BMRCL till now has only invited bids & awarded contracts for 3 packages: 2 for the extension of the Purple Line to Challegata and 1 for the extension of the Green Line to Anjanapura/NICE junction – and work on those stretches has just commenced at the start of the summer. As such, without any new new packages in the tendering stage (see BMRCL’s tender page), construction work elsewhere (Whitefield, BIEC, Electronics City to name some places) is at the very least 12 months away from beginning.\n\nLast month, I explained how important financing is in infrastructure projects and how the BMRCL still doesn’t have the external funds it needs (45% of Rs 26,000 crores) tied up to execute the project. Now, the Deccan Herald in support of that has published a report on the poor response the BMRCL has received from global lenders. In addition, the state government has announced plans to lease out land adjacent to Phase 1 stations to fund their portion of the project.\n\nOne significant thing to note is that the post of Director (Finance) at BMRC has been lying vacant for almost 9 months now. The BMRCL had invited applications in December 2015, but there hasn’t been any news on this position being filled. Without someone to vet proposals and take big decisions that steers the project’s financing and ultimately its success, the Phase 2 project has and will continue to slow down.\n\nPhase 1\n\nAs always, let’s first take a look at some new snaps of the underground sections, and then dive into analyzing the data for Phase 1:\n\nPurple line – Tunneling work by the CEC-CICI JV on the Purple line’s 4.8 km underground section between Magadi Road – MG Road started in May 2011 and got completed in March 2014. Following that, trial runs began in November 2015. The line was finally inaugurated on April 29 2016 and commercial operations started the next day at 6 am. A comprehensive history of the underground section from bidding to construction to testing can be viewed here.\n\nGreen line – The Green line’s tunnels from the North Ramp (near Sampige Road station) to the South Ramp (near National College station) are being constructed by a JV of Coastal – TTS with some help from the Robbins Company and the CEC-CICI JV. In the month of June, TBM Kaveri made a successful breakthrough at the Majestic station’s South Shaft and now only 1 more breakthrough by TBM Krishna is left to wrap up tunneling works on the metro’s Phase 1 project.\n\nHere’s a map displaying the incomplete Green line’s underground section between Majestic & Chickpet. As of August 1, Only TBM Krishna is tunneling from Chickpet to Majestic.\n\nProgress Table:\n\nTBM Origin Destination Distance June 1 July 1 Aug 1 Krishna Chickpet Majestic 747m 572m 607.5 m 657m\n\n• The Krishna TBM made a breakthrough at Chickpet station on August 31 from the KR (City) Market station after a slow and tiring journey of 22 months. After being put through repairs for 112 days, the TBM was then commissioned on December 22 towards Majestic for one final drive. Progress in the month of July was slightly better than in June, but the TBM’s advancement rate slowed considerably in the 2nd half of July including the 1st half of August.\n\nDistance Left – 90 meters (Aug 1) & 85.5 meters (Aug 8)\n\nNorthern Section: Sampige Road – Majestic\n\nThe distance between the 2 stations is only 1.5 km, and both twin tunnels between the North Ramp & Majestic have were completed by TBM Margarita and TBM Godavari. Data points from the newsletter for the entire underground corridor:\n\n• Flash Butt Welding work, out of 953 numbers 386 numbers is completed.\n\n• First stage concrete out of 1200 Cubic Meters 436 Cubic Meters is completed.\n\n• Plinth Concreting out of 8000 Track Meters 993 Track Meters is completed.\n\n• 1 in 7 Turnouts 1 number is completed and 1 in 9 Turnouts 2 numbers is completed.\n\nAn image of the 1st turnout shot in July can be viewed here. TMRG reader Krishnan shared this video as a comment in one of my previous posts which takes you through the northern underground section:\n\nSouthern Section: Majestic – National College\n\nOver the past months, I was expecting TBM Krishna to arrive at Majestic’s South Shaft in August-September. After the TBM’s advancement rates picked up in July, I narrowed down the breakthrough to late August, but will have push back to September now. The last few weeks’ progress of 7.5m (July 24 – Aug 1) & 4.5m (Aug 1 – 8) have shown how brutal tunneling conditions are down there.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, it’s only a matter of time for the BMRCL and Karnataka government to announce a new deadline for the entire Phase 1 project. BMRCL’s plan of commencing operations on the pending stretches is still pretty vague and besides back-filling work, construction activity (stations, shafts) is showing no signs of picking up pace. And it is this lack of clarity among a host of other reasons which lends the organization a bad name.\n\nOverall, it’s certain that no new stretches of Phase 1 will open this year and the entire project is currently projected to become operational sometime in Q3-Q4 2017.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Any news/data points you’d like to bring to my attention?\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nThanks everyone for your tweets, messages & emails asking about my health, safety and future plans for the site. I haven’t forgotten about you guys and have absolutely no plans to abandon this place. The last 30 days have been quite uneventful as far as major updates go, and seeing that unfold, I took some time off to travel and explore some interesting places around the world. Check out some images I shot of a glacier, mangrove coastline, sawgrass prarie, beach and hills. I’ve got one last major destination left, so it’ll be another few weeks before I get back to what I love. Sit tight\n\nHere are some curated updates from the past 30 days:\n\nAhmedabad\n\n• Earlier in August, MEGA launched their revamped website with a lot more information, graphics and project updates. It’s worth a look.\n\n• Yet another pier cage collapsed. This time, the incident took place at the Apparel Park station’s site on the 20.536 km east-west line being built by DRA-CICO.\n\n• Technical evaluation for 2 underground packages totaling 6.83 km, from the Apparel Park Depot to Shahpur on the 20.536 km east-west line, is currently in progress. Bidders include L&T, Afcons Infrastructure, Italian-Thai Development PLC (ITD) and possibly J Kumar Infraprojects. Tata Projects, Pratibha Industries had attended the pre-bid meeting in April, but decided not to bid.\n\nBangalore\n\n• As of September 13, TBM Krishna still has another 27m (18 rings) left to arrive at Majestic station’s southern shaft and complete the 16th & final TBM breakthrough for the Phase 1 project. It’ll be quite a historic day for the city.\n\n• This shouldn’t come as a surprise – The Chief Minister has revised Phase 1’s deadline from November 2016 to April 2017. Once we’re closer to April, expect another revision and assurances of the Green Line opening “soon” by the MD and CPRO as they’ve cunningly done so far. As per my estimates, the line is expected to start operations no sooner than Q4 2017.\n\n• The BMRCL has published a list of 9 routes to the airport on their website along with a route map of the ORR line (now under ‘Phase 2A’) from Central Silk Board to KR Puram through the Marathahalli Junction. I haven’t had a chance to thoroughly review all 9 alignments, but I do like and support proposal #6. What are your thoughts?\n\nChennai\n\n• The Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) approved Chennai’s 8 km Airport – Little Mount stretch in August, but the CMRL has not announced or shown any intention of opening the line for commercial use.\n\nUpdate: As per The Hindu, the CMRL is eyeing September 18-20.\n\n• The 1 km Alandur – St. Thomas Mount section will be inspected by the CMRS later this month or in early October.\n\nDelhi\n\n• As of August 16, J Kumar-CRTG’s 2 TBMs on package CC-24 (Nizamuddin-Lajpat Nagar) have 190 and 200 rings pending between the Ashram and Vinobhapuri stations.\n\n• Earlier this month, TBM S197 on package CC-66 (Dwarka-Najafgarh) started tunneling for the up-line tunnel from the Sai Baba Mandir shaft towards Najafgarh. This TBM had built the down-line tunnel and made a breakthrough at a shaft adjacent to the local Hanuman Mandir on June 25 after which it was dismantled and brought back to the Sai Baba Mandir shaft.\n\n• As of September 1, L&T-SUCG’s CREG TBM (#7) on package CC-27 (Shankar Vihar-Hauz Khas) has completed building 588/904 rings for the down-line between Vasant Vihar and Munirka stations on the 38.235 km Magenta Line. This is the last TBM operating on the entire line and the final breakthrough is now expected to take place in early 2017.\n\n• Excavation & concreting is in its final stages at the Rameshwar Nagar shaft from where 4 TBMs will be extracted. This is the biggest bottleneck on the 58.596 km Pink Line and also the DMRC’s best kept secret. I’m yet to read a single news report or comment by the DMRC on it.\n\nLucknow\n\n• LMRC’s MD has announced they’re targeting March 26, 2017 for commencing commercial operations on the 8.48 km priority corridor between Charbagh and Transport Nagar.\n\n• On September 1, Alstom in Sri City unveiled the 1st car body shell for Lucknow Metro’s rolling stock.

Expect them to make an official announcement after the contract is officially awarded.\n\nHave I missed out on anything? If so, leave a comment below to share with others. See you soon!\n\n– TMRG\n\nLooking at the ever-increasing current & projected ridership of the Bangalore Metro, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation on October 1 invited bids to integrate and convert its existing 3-coach 50 train fleet into 6-coach formations to provide more capacity & convenience to commuters. The notice was published after the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) approved its funding and bidding parameters.\n\nAll stations on the Phase 1 network are 135m long and were designed keeping this conversion in mind. Of the existing 50 3-coach trains supplied by the BRMM consortium led by BEML, roughly 30 are currently being utilized for operations on the 2 operational lines which total 30.3 km. The remaining trains will be pushed into service once the rest 12 km of the Green Line in Phase 1, from Sampige Road to Yelachenahalli (erst. Puttenahalli), opens in 2017-end (estd.)\n\nNotice\n\nSUPPLY OF 150 Nos. STANDARD GAUGE INTERMEDIATE CARS AS PER REQUIREMENTS OF BMRCL COMPATIBLE WITH AND SUITABLE FOR INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING TRAINS OF BANGALORE METRO RAIL PROJECT PHASE-I PROCURED UNDER CONTRACT No. 2 RS-DM – Link to Notice\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nAs per the instructions to the bidders:\n\n• Current train composition: DMC-TC-DMC\n\n• Future train composition: DMC-TC-MC + MC-TC-DMC\n\nFor reference, DMC = Driving Motor Car ; MC = Motor Car ; TC = Trailer Car\n\nOf the 150 new coaches, 63 will be supplied to the Purple Line (Kengeri-Whitefield) for converting 21 3-coach trains into 6-coach trains while 87 will be supplied to the Green line (BIEC-Anjanapura) for converting 29 3-coach trains into 6 coach trains.\n\nThe bid documents consider one unit to comprise of 2MC & 1TC(─MC + MC ─TC─) coaches and stipulate that only one unit can be manufactured in an off-shore facility outside of India and the remaining must be manufactured in the country. For those interested in the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and how it compares to the previous contract, this stipulation is better than the RS1 contract where the first 15 coaches (5 units) were built at Hyundai Rotem’s plant in South Korea while the rest 135 (45 units) were built at BEML’s facility in Krishnappa Garden, Bangalore.\n\nTiming & Cost\n\nBids must be submitted to BMRCL’s office by 3pm on 30th November 2016 following which they will be opened and evaluated on general evaluation and technical parameters. Once that phase is complete, then the financial packages of the qualified bidders is expected to be opened sometime in early-mid 2017.\n\nAlthough the bidding notice doesn’t specify the contract’s duration, the first unit of 3 new coaches is expected to be manufactured in 12-15 months after which it will be put through testing – first at the manufacturer’s facility, then at one of BMRCL’s depots’ test tracks followed by testing on the actual line during non-revenue hours. As such, I’m expecting the first 6-coach train to be inducted into service no sooner than 2019. Delivery for the entire 150 coaches is dependent on the schedule laid down by the BMRCL but is also influenced by the supplier’s production line and can take up to 3-5 years to complete. For reference, the BRMM consortium won Bangalore’s contract in February 2009, delivered its first train in October 2010 and the last train in May 2014. Looking at this and other orders around the country, I’m expecting all 50 trains to be converted into 6-coach trains sometime in 2021.\n\nAs for cost, BMRCL’s MD has stated the BMRCL & AFD have budgeted Rs 1,350 crore for this project assuming each coach will cost Rs 9 crore. Even though no Driver Motor Cars are being ordered, this figure seems a little on the low side, and I expect the final order to be around the Rs 1,600 crore figure.\n\nFinal thoughts – The ‘crush load’ capacity of 3-coach trains specified for all Indian metros is 975 (inhumane in my opinion) and will double up once the conversion is complete. Ridership is on the rise (roughly 1.5 lakh/day utilize the service with highs of 1.9 lakh/day) and will significantly rise once the entire Phase 1 is complete in 2017-end (estd.) with some estimates suggesting an initial ridership of 5 lakh/day. With Phase 1 expected to open in about a year’s time, I do not believe the BMRCL will be equipped to handle passenger loads once it goes live. As witnessed in Delhi, this is bound to put off a fraction of passengers from using its packed services and return to other public & private modes.\n\nAs seen in Delhi where multiple intermediate orders have been given to convert coaches into 8 and 6 coaches (eg RS-9, RS-13), there is likely to be only one bidder for this contract (BRMM-BEML) as the coaches are required to seamlessly integrate with the existing stock. So you might ask – why is the bidding required in the first place? Without in-built provisions to order additional items in the future, all items sought by metro organizations must go through a competitive bidding process to maintain transparency as required by the loan agency. This is not just limited to high value items, but also includes office rentals, insurance policy, retail licenses and everyday items like stationary & photocopying services – see the BMRCL’s tender page for all items/services currently sought.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nLast week, Bangalore’s Development Minister K. J. George held a review meeting with Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.’s Managing Director to discuss the status of city’s under construction and new metro lines. One of the new lines discussed was the upcoming Silk Board – KR Puram line (Phase 2A) which will run elevated along the eastern half of the Outer Ring Road with a track length of roughly 18 kms.\n\nK.J. George’s office tweeted out some images from the meeting which included a map of the line’s alignment along with the stations proposed. The tweet has since then been deleted (wonder why?), but thanks to web caching services, the map has been retrieved.\n\nStations are proposed at Silk Board Junction, HSR Layout (Teacher’s Colony), Agara Lake, Agara Junction, Ibbalur Junction, Devarabisanahalli, RMZ Infotech/Ecospace, New Horizon College, Kadubeesanahalli, Manjunatha Nagar, Marathahalli Junction, Ashwath Nagar, Chinnappanahalli, Infosys, Mahadevpura, B Narayanapura & KR Puram. Out of these, the Marathahalli Junction station is expected to be designed keeping in mind the proposed Marathahalli – Hosakerehalli line in Phase 3.\n\nI must note that this is merely a preliminary list of stations. While the line’s DPR will identify the final list, a far more accurate picture and count of stations will appear once the BMRCL invites tenders for the line’s construction which I estimate would happen no sooner than 2018 or even 2019.\n\nFrom my previous post on this line, here’s what the line’s alignment (in Brown) looks like on an embedded map. You can choose to zoom in and out.\n\nCurrent Status – October 2016\n\nThe Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the line is under preparation and the BMRCL recently awarded two survey & investigative contracts for which bids were invited in June. When ready, the data captured from these exercises will be put together in the DPR and presented to the Karnataka Government’s cabinet for its approval with an estimate cost of building the line.\n\nDGPS, Topographic, Land & Property Survey\n\nContract: BMRCL/ 2016/ DGPS, Topographic, Land & Property Survey/ KR Puram – CSB /05\n\nAwarded to: Unicorn Surveys\n\nGeotechnical Investigation\n\nContract: BMRCL/2016/Geo Technical Investigation/K.R.Puram-CSB/06\n\nAwarded to: Geo Quest Incorp\n\nOn the financial side of things, the line will be funded through what the BMRCL calls an “innovative funding model” and as per a recent report in the Bangalore Mirror, many corporate leaders agreed to volunteer and contribute up to Rs 2000 crore to the project. As per the ORR Companies Association’s president:\n\nTwo senior members of the ORRCA governance team attended the meeting where the PPP model for the exclusive metro line to ORR was discussed. The industry has committed to fund the project only because the government has assured that it will be fast-tracked. Also, to keep it fast-paced, a committee will be formed comprising industry representatives and officials, whereonce in a fortnight, the work will be reviewed. Once the project kicks-off, depending on the model, we may have developers and investors also pitching in funds and this line can be made operational on a Build Operate Transfer [BOT] basis.\n\nThe modalities of funding the line are still being worked out and this will be a time consuming exercise for a project as large as this. For something that was just announced earlier this year, I’d say things are moving along nicely with the stakeholders taking active interest to push it through.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nThe Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. just made the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the upcoming Silk Board – KR Puram line available on their website. The DPR was prepared by BMRCL’s in-house team within a month’s timeframe and provides the entire project plan, traffic forecast, financial viability and risk mitigation plan for issues during its execution. Check it out here and if you have any suggestions, then forward them along to bmrcl@dataone.in by November 30 2016.\n\nPart of Phase 2A, the BMRCL officially refers to this line as Line-7 and has not yet assigned a color to it. That type of decision is usually taken during the project’s implementation.\n\nHere are some interesting data points:\n\n• Estimated Cost: Rs. 4202 Crores (July 2016 prices)\n\n• Length: 17 km – this is the commercial route length only. Viaduct’s length connecting to the depot will make it longer.\n\n• Type: Elevated – Viaduct will be built on the Outer Ring Road’s median & requires no land acquisition.\n\n• Stations: 13 at KR Puram (interchange with upcoming Purple Line), Mahadevpura, DRDO Sports Complex, Doddanakundi, ISRO, Marathahalli, Kodibisanahalli, Kadubeesanahalli, Bellandur, Ibbalur, Agara Lake, HSR Layout, Silk Board (interchange with upcoming RV Road – Bommasandra line).\n\nNote that Kodibisanahalli has been mentioned twice. One of them is likely to be renamed.\n\n• Depot: The trains will be stabled and & maintained at the existing Baiyappanahalli Depot. Some of the Purple Line’s existing stabling lines will be re-purposed for this line and due to that, a new depot for the Purple Line has been proposed at Kodugodi near Hope Farm Junction (view suggested layout) where government land is available. At a later stage, the Baiyappanahalli Depot will exclusively be used by this new line’s trains while the Purple Line’s trains will be stabled & maintained at Kodugodi and the upcoming Challaghatta Depot.\n\n• Land Acquisition: The BMRCL requires a total of 15179 sq meters of which 9268 sq meters is private land and the rest 5911 sq meters is government land.\n\n• Construction Methodology: Elevated viaduct consisting of pre-stressed concrete box/U-shaped girders on single pier/portal with pile/open foundation. The viaduct will look sleek & similar to the ones in Noida, Lucknow & Kochi.\n\n• Signalling: Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) with Automatic Train Protection (ATP) and Automatic Train Operation (ATO) sub-systems. This will allow for high train frequencies, and the DPR proposes a headway of 2.5 minutes to be implemented in the future.\n\n• Rolling Stock: BMRCL plans to initially procure 20 6-coach trains and operate them in a DMC-TC-MC+MC-TC-DMC formation from the get-go. This means 3-coach trains like currently on the Purple/Green lines will never be operated for commercial services. Since the Baiyappanahalli Depot will be utilized for maintenance, the rolling stock’s dimensions will be similar to those on the Purple & Green lines. Max train capacity is estimated at 1574 assuming 6 people/square meter. Along with a 4 minute frequency, that translates to a system capacity of 37,776 PHPDT (Peak Hour Peak Direction Traffic).\n\n• Traffic Forecast (Estimated Ridership):\n\nThe following figures were arrived through different modeling techniques. A more detailed table for 2020 can viewed on page 3-25. Worth a look but pretty inconsequential as the line will not be operational by then.\n\n2021: 3.52 Lakhs/Day\n\n2031: 4.59 Lakhs/Day\n\n2041: 5.75 Lakhs/Day\n\n• Funding Scenarios:\n\nThis is the most important part of the project that will influence when the project’s construction starts. Earlier it appeared that the BMRCL’s innovative financing techniques, touted by them as the hall-mark of the project, would finance a bulk of it, but looking at the funding options proposed (not exhaustive or set on stone), the BMRCL expects to borrow a similar or significant amount to fund it:\n\n• Future Extension: The line is proposed to be extended to Hebbal via Nagawara which is the most logical next step. Similar to this in Gurgaon, I believe the superstructure of the viaduct between the Baiyappanahalli Depot & KR Puram Station will likely include a physical provision for its extension.\n\nFor more detailed info, do check out the DPR.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThere are lots of positive take-aways from the DPR, like the decision to use of CBTC signalling and U-shaped girders for construction. That said, project funding is the most important component in all construction projects and at this time, no funds towards its execution have been (publically) tied up or promised by any government, lending agency or private company. Land acquisition is tricky, never easy and even more so in Bangalore because it’s not BMRCL’s forte as currently being witnessed in Phase 2’s execution where land notifications for many sections have not even been prepared or sent out.\n\nAfter the BMRCL encorporates everyone’s suggestions, the DPR will be presented to the state government’s cabinet. Whenever they approve, the exact funding split/outlay will be known, and the BMRCL will then take steps to appoint a detailed design contractor (DDC) to assist with the line’s design. Overall, the government’s enthusiasm is very encouraging and with many pre-construction tasks still pending, I expect construction work to begin in 2018-2019.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nWith track-work complete on the down-line tunnel of Bangalore Metro’s long-delayed 24.20 km Green Line, the BMRCL yesterday pulled a metro train using a battery powered locomotive (BPL) through its 4 km UG-1 underground section and out on to the 8 km Reach 4-4A viaduct’s pocket track at the National College Station.\n\nThe train departed Sampige Road Station at 4:30pm and took about 2 hours to traverse through the underground section connecting Sampige Road – Majestic – Chickpet – KR Market – National College stations as the the crew had to stop its movement frequently to check for & remove physical infringements along the way.\n\nNOTE: As per a senior BMRCL official, the city’s Development Minister will today (Sunday) flag off a visual inspection of the line and trial runs/testing will commence sometime in the following week.\n\nThe elevated section between National College – Yelachenahalli, where trial runs will commence next week, comprises of 2 sub-sections:\n\n• Reach 4 – National College to Rashtreeya Vidyalaya Road – 4.1 km with stations at: National College, Lalbagh, South End Circle, Jayanagar & RV Road.\n\n• Reach 4A – Rashtreeya Vidyalaya Road to Yelachenahalli – 3.9 km with stations at: Banashankari, JP Nagar & Yelachenahalli\n\nVideo:\n\nA similar exercise was conducted on the 18 km Purple Line’s tunnels between Cubbon Park and City Railway stations in March 2015. After all sub-systems were installed, integrated trial runs began in November 2015 and the line went on to start commercial operations in April 2016.\n\nComing back to the Green Line – with the train now stationed at National College, testing on the elevated section in south Bangalore can finally begin after a long wait. As operations on this section relied on the tunnel works to be completed, the BMRCL in 2015 entertained the idea of airlifting coaches onto its viaduct, like previously done in Delhi & Gurgaon, but finally decided not to do so due to logistical reasons.\n\nThe BMRCL will need 2-3 months to conduct trial runs and complete minor pending finishing works at the stations after which it’ll invite the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) to conduct a safety inspection. The BMRCL hasn’t revealed their actual game plan, but like the once standalone Reach 2 (Magadi Road-Mysore Road) section, I’m expecting the BMRCL to launch operations on Reach 4-4A by the new April 2017 Phase 1 deadline as a face saver since the underground section will need another 4-6 months to get ready for trial runs.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\n5 days after inviting bids for the Purple Line’s Reach 1B between Kundalahalli – Whitefield, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. has now initiated the tendering process for constructing the 72 km Phase 2 project’s Reach 1A between the existing Baiyappanahalli station and the upcoming Visvesvaraya Industrial Area station. Today, they published a notice inviting infrastructure companies to bid for constructing Reach 1A’s 8.039km elevated viaduct & 6 new stations as part of the Purple Line’s 15.257 km extension to Whitefield.\n\nNotice Inviting Tenders\n\nOn behalf of Managing Director, BMRCL, General Manager (Contracts) invites Tenders for the work of “Construction of elevated structures (viaduct and stations) of 8.039Km (Approx.) length from Baiyappanahalli station (exlc.) to Visvesvaraya Industrial Area Station (incl.) (Chainage 18.603.879 m to 26643.032m) including Road Widening & allied works and 6 Numbers of Elevated Metro stations viz. Jyothipuram, KR Puram, Mahadevapura, Garudacharpalya, Doddanakundi Industrial Area, Visvesvaraya Industrial Area in the Extension of East side of E-W Corridor of Bangalore Metro Rail Project, Phase-2 – link to notice\n\nBesides constructing the viaduct in 27 months, the contractor will also be responsible for constructing 6 new stations at Jyothipuram, KR Puram, Mahadevapura, Garudacharpalya, Doddanakundi Industrial Area, Visvesvaraya Industrial Area. The KR Puram station will serve as an interchange for the upcoming 17 km Silkboard – KR Puram line (Phase 2A) and even though the notice doesn’t mention anything about it (the tender documents will), the station’s design will be influenced to accommodate platforms for that new line. Perhaps KR Puram will have a double-decker structure like Hyderabad’s upcoming Ameerpet station or Chennai’s operational Alandur station? We’ll have to wait to find out.\n\nTender documents will go on sale on December 19, 2016 and the BMRCL has estimated this section to cost Rs. 670.72 crores. The last date for submitting bidding documents is 3 pm on February 27, 2017 after which the bids will be opened & evaluated for eligibility at 3:30 pm.\n\nAs I mentioned in Reach 1B’s post, the BMRCL’s track record for quickly awarding contracts isn’t stellar, so I expect this section’s contract to be awarded only in Q3 2017 with construction work beginning shortly after in Q4 2017 subject to approvals. Timing wise, I expect this section along with Reach 1B to open no sooner than 2022. Once this, Reach 1B (Kundalahalli – Whitefield), Reach 2A (Mysore Road – Pattanagere) & Reach 2B (Pattanagere – Challegatta) are operational, the Purple Line end-to-end will become approximately 42.3 km long.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nLooks like Christmas came early! Just a couple days after the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. kick-started the tendering process for the 72 km Phase 2’s Reach 1A and Reach 1B, the BMRCL has now also initiated the civil construction tendering process for Reach 5 of the new 18.80 km RV Road – Bommasandra line between Bommasandra and Hosa Road. Today, they published a notice inviting infrastructure companies to bid for constructing Reach 5’s 6.418km elevated viaduct and 5 new stations in south-east Bangalore:\n\nNotice Inviting Tenders\n\nOn behalf of Managing Director, BMRCL, General Manager (Contracts) invites Tenders for the work of “Construction of Elevated Structures (viaduct & stations) of 6.418km (approx) from Bommasandra to Hosa Road Station (excl.) (Chainage 18591.06m to 12173.092m) including Depot entry line to Hebbagodi Depot, Road Widening allied works and 5 Numbers of Metro Stations viz. Bommasandra, Hebbagodi, Huskur Road, Electronic City-II, Electronic City-1 in Reach-5 line of Bangalore Metro Ral Project, Phase-2.”\n\nBesides constructing the viaduct in 27 months, the contractor will also be responsible for constructing 5 new stations at Bommasandra, Hebbagodi, Huskur Road, Electronic City-II, Electronic City-I as well as a viaduct leading into the new Hebbagodi Depot which will spread across 28 acres.\n\nTender documents will go on sale on December 22, 2016 and the BMRCL has estimated this section to cost Rs. 468.64 crores. The last date for submitting bidding documents is 3 pm on March 1, 2017 after which the bids will be opened & evaluated for eligibility at 3:30 pm.\n\nAs I mentioned in Reach 1B’s post, the BMRCL’s track record for quickly awarding contracts in Phase 2 isn’t stellar, so I expect this section’s contract to also be awarded only in Q3 2017 with construction work beginning shortly after in Q4 2017 subject to approvals. As this section includes a depot, the BMRCL can choose to start fragmented operations here without relying on the RV Road – Silkboard section which will take a lot more time to construct due to the multi-level Jayadeva Hospital Interchange and other obstacles along the way. Timing wise, I expect this section to open no sooner than 2021. If the BMRCL chooses to start operations on it along with the rest of the line, then I expect it to open only by 2023.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG\n\nA day after inviting bids for Bangalore’s Bommasandra-Hosa Road (Reach 5) stretch, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation on December 10 invited construction bids for another section of the 72 km Phase 2 project’s new 18.80 km RV Road – Bommasandra elevated line. This time around, they invited infrastructure companies to submit bids for the 6.385 km mid-section of the line between Hosa Road and HSR Layout which’ll consist of 6 stations on Hosur Road.\n\nNotice Inviting Tenders\n\nOn behalf of Managing Director, BMRCL, General Manager (Contracts) invites Tenders for the work of “Construction of Elevated structures (Viaduct & Stations) of length 6.385Km (approx.) from Hosa road station (Incl.) to HSR Layout station (Incl.) (Chainage 12173.092m to 5788.520m) including Road widening & allied works and 6 Numbers of Metro Stations viz., Hosa Road , Basapura Road , Chikkabegur , Muneshwara Nagar , Oxford College ,HSR layout in Reach-5 line of Bangalore Metro Rail Project, Phase 2.” – link to notice\n\nInterestingly this section has also been named ‘Reach 5’ instead of Reach 5A/5B as they’ve traditionally done to differentiate between adjacent civil packages. Like the Hosa Road – Bommasandra stretch, the contractor here will also be required to complete all civil works in 27 months.\n\nA detailed PDF document which shows the exact locations of all stations can be viewed here.\n\nTender documents will go on sale on December 24, 2016 and the BMRCL has estimated this section to cost Rs. 492.38 crores. The last date for submitting bidding documents is 3 pm on March 6, 2017 after which the bids will be opened & evaluated for eligibility at 3:30 pm.\n\nBMRCL’s CPRO recently mentioned that construction “work should commence in about 3 months”. Well, that just won’t be possible. The tendering process for civil contracts in India have multiple layers and each bidder’s eligibility is first evaluated, then their technical bid and finally their financial bid. Each step of the process is closely monitored by the lending agency (in this case KfW), and bids are opened & awarded only with their consent with the evaluation process usually taking an average of 6 months. Here’s the BMRCL’s track record for Phase 2:\n\nReach Bids Invited Contract Awarded 2A June 30, 2014 April 23, 2015 4B February 2, 2015 January 27, 2016 2B May 21, 2015 March 9, 2016\n\nAnd that’s just the tendering stage. After the contract is awarded, the contractor would be need another 2-3 months just to mobilize resources and hire engineers. To see these timelines in action, simply visit the Lucknow or Mumbai sections where new contracts have been awarded over the past 6 months.\n\nLike the other packages, I expect the contract for the Hosa Road – HSR Layout section to also be awarded only in Q3 2017 with construction work beginning shortly after in Q4 2017 subject to approvals. Timing wise, I expect this section to open no sooner than 2021. If the BMRCL chooses to start operations on it along with the northern portion of the line (RV Road – Silk Board), then I expect it to open only by 2023.\n\nFor more updates, check out the Bangalore section of The Metro Rail Guy!\n\n– TMRG"
