        "text": "The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) announced on Thursday (Aug 19) that it has signed an agreement with the Asian Development Plan (ADB) for a $500 million (Rs 3,643 crore) loan to fund the construction of Namma Metro's airport corridor.\n\nBy inking the ADB funding deal, BMRCL has realised the target of raising Rs 5,960 crore through loans from multilateral or bilateral agencies. In March this year, it secured a $318 million (Rs 2,317 crore) loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nThe state and union governments will contribute Rs 3,973 crore in equity and subordinate debt. Karnataka will pay an additional Rs 2,762 crore for land acquisition.\n\nThe 56 km “ORR-Airport Metro”, will connect Central Silk Board Junction to Kempegowda International Airport via KR Puram and Hebbal.
