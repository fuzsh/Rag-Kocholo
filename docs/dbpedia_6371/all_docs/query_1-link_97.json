        "text": "Bangalore’s Namma Metro Yellow Line to Open by Year-End\n\nThe Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) has announced that the much-awaited Yellow Line of Namma Metro will be launched by the end of this year. This marks a shift from earlier plans which anticipated starting the line with fewer trains operating at longer intervals.\n\nThe Rs 5,745-crore Yellow Line project extends over 19.15 kilometers from RV Road to Bommasandra and includes 16 stations. Key stops on this line will include Jayadeva Hospital, BTM Layout, Silk Board Junction, and Electronics City.\n\nA notable feature of the Yellow Line is the Jayadeva Hospital station, which will serve as an interchange hub and stand as India’s tallest metro station at 39 meters. This station will boast a six-level structure, including an underpass, road, flyover, Yellow Line platform, concourse, and Pink Line platform.\n\nTrial operations for the Yellow Line commenced on June 13, using a prototype six-coach train imported from China. These trials, which include critical tests for oscillation and safety, are expected to conclude by September or October. The full service is slated to begin by December, contingent on the availability of sufficient trains.\n\nChina’s CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co Ltd is responsible for supplying a total of 216 coaches for the Yellow Line, amounting to 36 trains valued at ₹1,578 crore. While the initial production of twelve coaches is taking place in China, the remaining coaches are being assembled in West Bengal by CRRC’s Indian partner, Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd (TRSL). Manufacturing began on May 18, with the first six-coach train from TRSL expected to arrive in Bengaluru by mid-August.\n\nUnder the agreement, CRRC-TRSL will deliver two new trains each month starting in September, aiming to meet the December launch deadline."
