        "text": "Menu: News & Construction Updates | Overview | Phase 1 Info | Phase 2 Info | Phase 2A Info | Phase 2B Info | Phase 3 Info | Phase 3A | Metrolite | Suburban Rail\n\nPhase 2A Information\n\nBangalore (Namma) Metro’s Phase 2A project with one new 18.236 km elevated line, connecting KR Puram with Central Silkboard along the Outer Ring Road (ORR), was first announced at the Invest Karnataka Summit in February 2016 and is planned to be constructed along with the 73.92 km Phase 2 project.\n\nBangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. invited bids for geotechnical investigation and DGPS, topographic, land & property surveys in June 2016. The line’s Detailed Project Report (DPR), prepared by BMRCL’s in-house team, was revealed in November 2016 and estimates the line’s construction & system procurement to cost Rs 4202 crores.\n\nThe Karnataka government’s cabinet approved the project’s DPR in March 2017. Back then, instead of relying on foreign lenders, the BMRCL had planned to fund this line through what it called an “innovative financing model” in which private entities would have been engaged to pitch in anywhere from 25% to 50% of the line’s construction cost (Rs. 1100-2100 crores) and in return be granted exclusive advertising and leasing rights within the stations to monetize on their investment. By February 2018, BMRCL had only signed only 2 MoUs worth approximately Rs 100 crore each.\n\nIn 2018-2019, the BMRCL invited bids for the line’s construction in 3 packages. During that time, BMRCL was unable to achieve financial closure and the lowest bidder for all 3 packages, IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited, was hit by financial troubles.\n\nIn December 2019, BMRCL re-invited tenders for its construction. Technical bids were opened in March 2020 to reveal 9 bidders, and financial bids were opened in October to reveal Afcons Infrastructure and Shankarnarayana Construction as the lowest bidders. Construction contracts were awarded in May 2021.\n\nBMRCL’s Current Phase 2A Deadline: June 2025\n\nMy Completion Estimate: 2027\n\nIn April 2021, Phase 2A was approved by the Central Government’s cabinet.\n\nPhase 2A and Phase 2B (KR Puram – Yelahanka – Bangalore Airport) will be funded through a $500 million loan by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which was approved by its board in December 2020. In addition, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will provide a $318 million loan as well. A formal agreement for it was signed in March 2021.\n\nPhase 2A’s Funding\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 5,227.35 crore\n\nADB: Rs. 1,479.46 crore\n\nJICA: Rs. 893 crore (preliminary negotiation)\n\nPPP Sources: Rs. 600 crore\n\nState Govt: Rs. 1,690.46 crore\n\nCentral Govt: Rs. 734.22 crore\n\nRoute Information\n\nLine-5 (Blue Line): KR Puram – Central Silkboard\n\nLength: 18.236 km\n\nType: Elevated\n\nNumber of Stations: 13\n\nStation Names: KR Puram (interchange with the under construction Purple Line), Mahadevpura, DRDO Sports Complex, Doddanakundi, ISRO, Marathahalli, Kodibisanahalli, Kadubeesanahalli, Bellandur, Ibbalur, Agara Lake, HSR Layout, Silk Board (interchange with the upcoming Yellow Line).\n\nDepot: Trains on the ORR line will be stabled and & maintained at the existing Baiyappanahalli Depot. Some of the Purple Line’s existing stabling lines will be re-purposed for this line and due to that, a new depot for the Purple Line will be built at Kadugodi near Hope Farm Junction (view suggested layout) where government land is available. At a later stage, the Baiyappanahalli Depot will exclusively be used by this new line’s trains while the Purple Line’s trains will be stabled & maintained at Kadugodi Depot and Challaghatta Depot.\n\nRolling Stock: BMRCL plans to initially procure 120 coaches (20 train-sets x 6 coaches), and operate them in a DMC-TC-MC+MC-TC-DMC formation from the get-go.\n\nFor more information, see the line’s Detailed Project Report.\n\nPhase 2A Route Map\n\nThe embedded map below shows the exact location of all stations and can be zoomed into!\n\nAn official PDF route map of Bangalore Metro Phase 2A will be added here when available.\n\nKey for map below: Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 2A | Phase 2B\n\nPhase 2A Tenders\n\nBangalore Metro (BMRCL) Phase 2A tenders can be viewed on the BMRCL’s website. News on these notices, their bidders and contracts are covered in further detail on the news & construction page.\n\nPhase 2A’s Contractors\n\nClick on ‘News & Construction Updates’ below for project news, progress and updates.\n\nMenu: News & Construction Updates | Overview | Phase 1 Info | Phase 2 Info | Phase 2A Info | Phase 2B Info | Phase 3 Info | Phase 3A | Metrolite | Suburban Rail"
