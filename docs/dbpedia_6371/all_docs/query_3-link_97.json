        "text": "It is a Bogota political sport to attack TransMilenio, the city's BRT. That is evident once again in the present mayoral campaign. Yet once the new mayor term starts in January 1st, what is most probable is that TransMilenio will be expanded. All five mayors since we inaugurated TransMilenio in 2000 have expanded it. Even those most strident in their populism, such as the current one, Claudia López, attacked it ferociously as a candidate but once she became mayor she set about to expand it with several new lines. Why have all Bogota mayors expanded the system and hundreds around the world have adopted it with variations? Because bus-based mass transport is low cost and effective. Good mass transport is ubiquitous: people find it near people's homes and jobs, or other trips origins and destinations. They don't have to walk long or take feeder systems to reach it. For that to be possible, mass transport has to be low cost. Metros are wonderful but they have much higher investment and operating costs than buses, particularly in developing cities. As Bogota is now building several TransMilenio lines, as well as the metro line we contracted and another one is undergoing tendering processes, it is easy to compare costs. A metro costs between 7 and 18 times more per kilometer than a BRT. As a simple approximation, one could say that for the money 10 km of metro are built, 120 km of TransMilenio (including lanes for cars, demolishing many adjacent buildings to make sidewalks etc) can be built. Metros are so expensive, that no city can provide all its public transport needs with them. Moreover, cities where metros provide more than 50% of mobility are extremely rare and in the developing world, no metro moves more than 20% of a city's population. Therefore, even with very extensive metro networks, buses are still needed. London moves 50% more people by bus than by metro. It may be kept in mind that each additional metro line moves less passengers per kilometer. Because, obviously, the first lines are build in the highest demand corridors. That is one reason why Delhi's metro, with 391 km, 345% more than TransMilenio´s 114 km, moves 2,5 million passengers daily, a similar amount to TransMilenio´s 2,35 million. If there are going to be buses regardless of the construction of a dozen of metro lines, the question is: Which is the best way to operate them? BRT is just a name for a way to operate buses; and not just any way. It is the best way of doing it, because it achieves the following: -The highest speed -The least amount of buses -The lowest cost -The highest capacity -The least energy consumption -The least amount of road space, so that it is the way of operating buses that takes the least space from cars and other vehicles Soon all buses will be electric and driverless. And it should always be kept in mind that what makes a mass transit system is the exclusive right of way that makes it possible to achieve high speeds\n\nVande Bharat Metro: The first look video of the project becomes very popular https://ift.tt/l0MsZrd Vande Bharat Metro: The first look video of the project becomes very popular Vande Bharat Metro: The first look video of the project becomes very popular You may get the first look of this incredible subway in a video that has gone viral of the Vande Bharat subway. The facility where Vande Bharat Metro is being prepared is shown in this video. The issue gained widespread attention when a video was created and shared on X. Indian Railways' \"Vande Bharat Express\" network expansion plans are now in full gear. In this scene, the video of \"Vande Bharat Metro's\" first look has just appeared on social media. This shows the train's characteristics, inside, and buildup design. This train video is very popular on the internet. The Metro video on X has been posted by \"Indian Tech and Infra.\" The caption on it says, \"Vande Bharat Metro is getting ready.\" India's new transportation options. We would like to inform you that the \"Vande Bharat Express\" would be introducing sleeper and metro trains. Long-distance travelers will profit from the sleeping train. Conversely, \"Vande Metro\" will connect cities that are no more than 100 kilometers apart. It is anticipated that this year would see the trial launch of \"Vande Bharat Metro.\" Passenger use will commence shortly after this. People are awaiting this Metro. The Vande Metro train video is very popular, and people are excitedly anticipating its introduction. \"Vande Bharat Metro\" would ease the passenger load on regular trains, a user said. This train will link the cities, someone wrote, clearing up people's uncertainty. It won't operate inside cities like a traditional metro does. Finally, Vande Metro is getting ready, as another user put it. It's going to be an amazing experience. A different writer wrote: \"New year, new ideas, new avatar.\" Embrace the next phase. Vande Metro's area of expertise \"Vande Metro\" will provide all-AC service. It was created along Metro's lines, as the name would imply. This indicates that a metro train with ten carriages will be used for short-distance transportation. It will resemble a shuttle train that travels a route four or five times. The majority of those who will gain from this are workers and students. This train will be powered entirely by hydrogen. Its speed is 160 km/h and it will first be operated on eight routes in India, according to sources. It will be more appealing and pleasant than the typical train. It will feature plenty of room, broad seats, big windows, doors that open and close automatically, LED lighting, and more. First look at Metro Vande Bharat! https://ift.tt/GvLOF9l news January 06, 2024 at 07:56PM\n\nDid you know that the city of #Curitiba, Brazil, holds the record for the first city in the world to build a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System? The journey of the Curitiba Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System began in 1974. The city of Curitiba, Brazil, was experiencing significant population growth, surging from 120,000 people to 361,000 within 20 years. To cope with this growth, the city initially planned to adapt its infrastructure to make cars the primary mode of transport. However, these plans were cut short when architect Jaime Lerner took office as mayor in 1971. Lerner had a different vision for Curitiba. Instead of widening avenues, he created a pedestrian mall in the city center. His most memorable contribution came in his ideas for the city’s bus network. Several key initiatives have been instrumental in the success of the Curitiba BRT System: 1. Dedicated Bus Lanes One of the key features of the Curitiba bus system is its use of dedicated bus lanes. These lanes are separate from the rest of the traffic on the roads, allowing buses to move quickly and efficiently through the city. 2. Interconnected Routes: The system is designed to be highly interconnected, with multiple bus lines converging at key transfer points to make it easy for passengers to switch between different routes. 3. Integrated Corridors: Curitiba introduced “integrated corridors,” which allow passengers to transfer between different modes of transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways, at a single location. 4. Accessibility: The system is designed to be highly accessible for all, with low-floor buses and wheelchair ramps available at all major stops. 5. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System: The BRT system is a high-capacity, high-speed bus service that uses dedicated bus lanes and advanced technology to move large numbers of passengers quickly and efficiently through the city. 6. Environmentally Friendly Buses: Since 2014, they have been promoting 100% electric buses. These buses are powered by clean energy sources and are designed to produce fewer emissions than traditional gasoline or diesel buses. The results of these initiatives have been impressive. Today, 80% of travelers use the BRT system and it carries around 2 million passengers per day. The BRT has 30 hybrid buses, reducing overall fuel needs by 35% and limiting pollutant emissions. The introduction of the BRT caused a reduction of about 27 million auto trips per year, saving about 27 million litres of fuel annually. Curitiba’s BRT system model has already been replicated in more than 150 cities worldwide. For more information about the Curitiba Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System, you can visit these official websites - Curitiba Bus Rapid Transit System - pps.org - Curitiba, Brazil BRT system – GoBRT.org . . #smartcities #smartcity #singapore #digitalrevolution #ai #generativeai #iot #privacy #urbanmobility #sustainability #technology #bluetrack #brazil\n\nBUS RAPID TRANSIT FALLACIES Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems are a great option for high-capacity public transportation at high-density corridors performing as well as many subway systems at a fraction of the cost. Pioneered by the city of Curitiba, Brazil in 1974, BRT corridors became a synonym of efficiency, performance, modernity, and environment-friendly public transportation alternative. Structured as a ridership network within a trunk feeder system, BRT routes run high-capacity buses supposed to run traffic free, to have fewer stops and get a good average speed. Since its first inception 50 years ago, BRT corridors became very popular according to Global BRT Data: 191 cities, 31,596,612 passengers per day, 5,842 km (3,630 miles) total length. FALLACIES BRT is undoubtedly a worldwide success. However, its acronym is being used for bus corridors projects that aren't BRT at all. Some fallacies need to be clarified as some different approaches are planning and delivering 'different' BRT systems. 1. TRUE BRT: Due to lack of or insufficient right of way and lack of priority amid traffic, many bus corridors are launched as BRT1, BRT2, BRT3, BRT Lite, etc... They are not true BRT, they might be bus corridors, but not BRT. That's the BRT creep, a phenomenon where bus systems that fail to meet the requirements and standards for being considered \"true bus rapid transit\" are designated as bus rapid transit regardless. A True BRT system is comprised of three main components as a three-legged stool: a. Independent, dedicated, and exclusive right of way. b. Traffic Priority Signal (TPS). c. Control center engaged in a 3-way communication with vehicles and stops. 2. \"IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME\": This means that if you put effort and belief in the success of a project into that project, it’s more likely to succeed. Is populational density a pre-requisite for a BRT corridor, or the BRT corridor will foster populational density? Many BRT projects fail because they are built without the supportive populational density, betting on hopes to bring density (riders) after its completion and/or during operation. Another reason for failure is losing competition with cars on passengers’ preference. 3. POLITICAL BIAS: Political bias is a bias or perceived bias involving the slanting or altering of information to make a political decision from a political candidate seem more attractive. It’s the top-down decision-making process. Many BRT projects fail because they are built without solid technical basis, highly influenced by political bias resulting in projects being disconnected from what is really needed or expected.

Bus Rapid Transit (#BRT) is a public transportation system designed to provide faster, more efficient, and higher-capacity bus service than traditional bus systems. Here's how BRT typically works: 1. Dedicated #Bus #Lanes: #BRT systems often have dedicated bus lanes separated from regular traffic, which allows buses to move more quickly and avoid congestion. These lanes can be in the center of the road or along the sides. 2. Stations with Prepaid Boarding: BRT stations are designed to be efficient and convenient. Passengers usually pay for their tickets before boarding, either at a station kiosk or through electronic fare systems like smart cards. This minimizes boarding time and ensures faster service. 3. High-Quality Buses: BRT systems typically use modern, high-capacity buses that are comfortable and equipped with features like air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and real-time passenger information systems. 4. Regular and Reliable Service: BRT operates on fixed schedules, ensuring that buses arrive at stations at regular intervals. This reliability helps passengers plan their trips more efficiently. 5. Rapid Boarding and Alighting: BRT stations often have multiple doors on the buses, allowing for quicker boarding and alighting. Passengers can enter and exit the bus simultaneously, reducing dwell times at stops. 6. Traffic Signal Priority: BRT systems may be equipped with traffic signal priority systems. This means that traffic signals can be adjusted to give priority to buses, reducing wait times at intersections. 7. Elevated or Off-Board Fare Collection: In some BRT systems, fare collection is done off-board or at station platforms. This speeds up the boarding process since passengers don't have to pay the driver directly. 8. Integration with Other Modes: BRT systems are often designed to integrate seamlessly with other modes of transportation, such as subways, trams, or commuter trains, allowing passengers to transfer easily between them. 9. Land Use Planning: BRT planning often involves considerations for land use and urban development. Stations may be located in areas with high population density, employment centers, and other key destinations. 10. Accessibility and Amenities: BRT stations are designed to be accessible to people with disabilities and may include features like ramps, elevators, and tactile paving. They often provide shelter, seating, and real-time information displays for passengers. Overall, the goal of BRT is to provide a rapid, #efficient, and #cost-effective public transportation option that can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce environmental impact while improving the quality of urban transportation services. #BRT systems vary in design and features, but these principles are common to most successful BRT implementations.

The Problem: 📉Surat's bus system faced several issues, including low ridership, limited coverage, and outdated infrastructure. This made it difficult for residents to rely on public transportation for their daily commutes. The Solution: The city embarked on a comprehensive transformation plan, implementing a series of strategic initiatives: 📲Smart ticketing system: Surat introduced Automatic Fare Collection Systems (AFCS) to modernize the ticketing process. AFCS lets passengers use a single ticket throughout their journey while accessing information like fares, transfer routes and ticketing services on a mobile app called @Surat Sitilink. This not only streamlined operations but also increased ridership significantly. Ridership increased from 28,000 passengers per day in 2014 to 270,000 in 2023. Surat Money Card transactions reached 72,754 per day in 2022, up from zero in 2014. 🛣Improved infrastructure: Bus stops were upgraded, making them more accessible and comfortable for passengers. The city also expanded its bus network, providing more routes and greater coverage. Surat currently has 756 buses, of which 531 buses are to retire 2 years from now. Only 4% of the population uses the bus against the 40% of MoHUA standards for which the city needs to add more buses. ⚙Technology-driven optimization: Surat leveraged smart technologies to optimize bus routes and schedules, ensuring efficient and reliable service. The Outcome: The results have been remarkable. The shift towards using public transport has in turn led led to a reduction in traffic congestion.\n\nList of Top 10 Largest Metro Networks In The World: 1) Shanghai Metro(China) 2) Beijing Subway(China) 3) London Underground(United Kingdom) 4) Guangzhou Metro(China) 5) New York City Subway(United States) 6) Delhi Metro(India) 7) Moscow Metro(Russia) 8) Wuhan Metro(China) 9) Seoul Metro(South Korea) 10) Madrid Metro(Spain) Metro systems, also known as subways or underground railways, are high-capacity urban rail systems that improve the efficiency of urban transport systems and people’s mobility. Shanghai Metro(China) is the largest metro system in the world, with 16 subway lines and 705-kilometer lines. It also has the highest annual ridership at 2.83 billion trips. Shanghai Metro is the world’s longest metro network, measuring 831 kilometers long and with 508 stations across 20 lines. It’s also the world’s busiest metro, with over 3.7 billion riders annually, after the Beijing Subway. It is a rapid transit system in Shanghai, that provides urban and suburban transit services to 14 of its 16 municipal districts. The metro system was launched in the year 1993.It’s the third-oldest rapid transit system in mainland China, after the Beijing Subway and the Tianjin Metro. The Shanghai Metro operates almost 24 hours a day, from 3 AM to 11:30 PM. The maximum driving speed is 80 km/h (50 mph) on most lines, with the exception of lines 11 and 17, which have a maximum operating speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). Route 16 has a maximum operating speed of 120 km/h (75 miles). The Shanghai Metro is still expanding and the Phase IV track, which is expected to open in 2024, will extend the network line to approximately 453 kilometers.\n\nYesterday I saw a video of Economic Times in which Honourable Minister of GOI Sri Hardeep singh Puri was all praise for Delhi Metro as second best in the world with 65 lakh commuters travelling per day by Delhi Metro , mentioning the importance of last mile connectivity . Indeed Delhi Metro has emerged as a transformative force in the urban transportation landscape of India. Its efficiency, speed, and affordability have made it a preferred mode of commuting for millions in the bustling city. The rise of the Delhi Metro as a successful mass transit system is intertwined with its ability to provide seamless last-mile connectivity. Last mile connectivity refers to the crucial link between a commuter's point of origin or destination and the nearest metro station. As the metro rarely offers door-to-door service, convenient and efficient last-mile options become pivotal in encouraging commuters to make switch.The absence of integrated feeder modes of transport poses a challenge for commuters to reach the metro stations conveniently. Insufficient walking and cycling paths & parking spaces hinder accessibility to metro stations, especially for those living in the vicinity.Cost-conscious commuters are deterred from using the metro due to the lack of affordable and time-efficient last-mile options.Safety concerns, particularly for women, coupled with doubts about the reliability of last-mile transport options, act as deterrents. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is developing Multi-Modal Integration (MMI) hubs at key metro stations, creating dedicated spaces for autos, cycles, buses, and cabs. The introduction of electric autos & feeder buses for last-mile connectivity in various areas of Delhi addresses environmental concerns and offers a convenient mode of transportation. The lack of efficient last-mile connectivity has a significant impact on the ridership of the Delhi Metro. Commuters' concerns about inconvenience, time, cost, safety, and reliability all contribute to their decision-making process regarding metro usage. It is evident that the quality of last-mile services directly influences the commuters' choice of mode.STAMP has worked closely with city metro agencies and innovative entrepreneurs to incubate and pilot solutions that enhance last-mile connectivity. These initiatives range from mobility apps to solutions for underserved areas, reflecting the diversity of commuters' needs.The success of the Delhi Metro hinges on its ability to seamlessly integrate last-mile connectivity. The involvement of PWD department & transport department of Delhi is a move in the right direction to make last mile connectivity a 100% success to be followed in other metros especially Bengaluru Metro which has not been 100%successful even with the infrastructural paraphernalia of integration with KSRTC .#metro #delhimetro #govtofindia #ministryofrailways #ministryofurbanaffairs Narendra Modi Hardeep Singh Puri Ashwini Vaishnaw Nitin Gadkari UPMRC\n\n🚇 Introducing the Chennai Metro: A Glimpse into India's Fifth Largest Metro System Step into the world of Chennai's vibrant urban transit system, where innovation and connectivity converge to redefine the city's landscape Ranked fifth among India's sprawling metro networks, Chennai Metro spans a staggering 54 kilometers, asserting its prominence as the second-largest in South India, trailing only behind Bangalore Metro. 💰 Economic Powerhouse: Cost and Usage 💰 The construction of this cutting-edge metro infrastructure, amounting to ₹20,000 Crore, stands as a testament to Chennai's commitment to modernization.
