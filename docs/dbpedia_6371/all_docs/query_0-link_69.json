        "text": "Updated on June 20, 2017:\n\nPresident Pranab Mukherjee on June 19 inaugurated the Green Line of the Namma Metro, marking the completion of the 42-km long Phase-I. The new line, which opens for public on June 25, will operate between Sampige Road and Yelachenahalli Metro stations.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Phase-I of the Namma Metro has been constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 13,854 crore.\n\nUpdated on February 28, 2017:\n\nThe Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation or BMRCL has awarded a contract worth Rs 247 crore for the extension of Namma Metro's Purple line. The contractor, the name remains undisclosed, will be constructing the planned extension of Phase II running between the Nagasandra (Hesaraghatta cross) and Bengaluru International Exhibition Centre (BIEC). It will be a 3.03-km elevated stretch with three stations — Manjunathanagar, Jindal and BIEC. These three stations will cover the congested Tumakuru Road.\n\nAccording to BMRCL officials, work order will be released in two days.\n\nThe tender is set 27 months for completion of the project, thus, taking the completion timeline to mid-2019. Once completed, the Purple line of Namma Metro will connect the north and the south of the city, starting from BIEC and going to Anjanapura Township.\n\n***\n\nInformation technology hub Bengaluru, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, has two operational Metro rail lines that are not only making commute easier for the city's residents but also boosting real estate in Bangalore. The first phase of the Bangalore Metro, called Namma Metro, has been built with assistance from the highly successful Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).\n\nThe success of DMRC is a living testimony of how a Metro rail network can transform a city in multiple ways, and is an example for other major cities to emulate. Apart from solving the problems travellers in the national capital faced earlier, DMRC inspired governments in many Indian states to include a Metro network in their capital investment plans to build infrastructure.\n\nIn Bangalore, the first phase of the Metro network has been completed and commercial operations along four routes have already started. The state is gearing up to implement the second phase.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the Bangalore Metro project and the localities in Bangalore that it may impact.\n\nThe SPV: The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd is a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) created by a joint venture between the central government and the Karnataka government. An SPV is an entity created for serving a specific purpose.\n\nThe two lines: Named Namma Metro, with a tagline 'Bangalore Ahead', the first phase of the project is already complete, while the work on the second phase has yet to start. The network is divided into two lines – the Purple Line (the east-west corridor) and the Green Line (north-south corridor).\n\nOperational stations: The 18.10-km Purple Line runs from Baiyyapannahalli to the Mysore Road (17 stations) while the 24.20-km Green Line runs from Nagasundra to Puttenahalli (25 stations). Together, the two lines have 33 elevated and seven underground stations. The Kempegowda Metro Station on the Purple Line works as the intersection between the two lines. While all the stations are operational on the Purple Line, only 14 stations are operational on the Green Line.\n\nThe sections and reaches: For implementation, maintenance and administrative purposes, the stretches are divided among four reaches and two underground sections.\n\nThe consultants: Three global consultancy companies have been giving their assistance in implementing the project. These include Tokyo-based Oriental Consultants, Montreal-based Parsons Brinkerhoff International and Paris-based Systra.\n\nThe second phase: In the second phase, the south end of the Green Line will be extended form Puttenahalli to Anjanapura Township along the Kankapura Road, and from Hesarghatta cross to Bangalore International Exhibition Center on the Tumkur Road. The Purple Line will also see an extension on both sides, from Mysore Road to Kengeri and from Baiyappanahalli to Whitefield. This is expected to be a major boost to areas close to the planned development.\n\nPassengers carried: By 2021, the Purple Line is estimated to carry 6.5 lakh passengers per day, while the Green Line is expected to carry as many as 7.1 lakh passengers. These figures are likely to go as high as 8.8 lakh and 8.3 lakh per day, respectively, by 2031. Bangalore as a city has bad traffic conditions and the Metro network is solving the problem to a great extent.\n\nImplementation cost: The estimated cost of implementing the second phase of the network is Rs 26,405 crore; it may take about six years for the construction work to complete.\n\nThe MD: BMRC Managing Director Pradeep Singh Kharola is a PhD in public transport from the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi and is an IPS officer of the Karnataka cadre."
