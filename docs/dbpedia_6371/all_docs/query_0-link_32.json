        "text": "Once operational, the Yellow Line will boast 16 metro stations, significantly improving accessibility for commuters travelling between RV Road and Bommasandra.\n\nBengaluru: Namma Metro’s Yellow Line, a much-anticipated addition to Bengaluru’s metro network, is set to revolutionize the city’s transportation system. With the commencement of full-scale trial runs, the Yellow Line is gearing up to offer enhanced connectivity and lessen traffic congestion in the bustling metropolis. According to reports, Namma Metro’s Yellow Line could be operational later this year with five to six trains that will operate every 20 minutes.\n\nOn Thursday the trial run of the train started at Bommasandra at 12. 43 pm and stopped at the 14 mid stations for 2 minutes each before proceeding towards RV Road. The train continued its journey back to Bommasandra after a break of half an hour at RV Road. Some of the tests done during the process include signalling tests and tests of the condition of the track.\n\nDespite the completion of civil work and track-laying on the 19.15-km corridor, the lack of trains has been a major hurdle in initiating commercial operations. In a bid to address this issue, China’s CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co Ltd secured a contract to supply 216 coaches to the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). While twelve coaches are imported from China, the remaining are being assembled locally by CRRC’s Indian partner, Titagarh Rail System Ltd, according to a report in Deccan Herald.\n\nThe BMRCL kickstarted trial runs with a prototype six-coach train received from China, conducting tests between Bommasandra and Bommanahalli before extending the trials to cover the entire Yellow Line. The recent trial run witnessed the train making stops at 14 intermediate stations, undergoing rigorous testing related to signalling and track conditions.\n\nThe BMRCL is optimistic about receiving additional trains in the coming months, with plans to commence commercial operations with five to six trains initially. “We can start commercial operations with five to six trains and a 20-minute headway,” BMRCL Managing Director Maheshwar Rao M told the publication.\n\nOnce operational, the Yellow Line will boast 16 metro stations, significantly improving accessibility for commuters travelling between RV Road and Bommasandra. The expansion of the metro network is poised to offer Bengaluru’s citizens a smoother commuting experience and better connectivity across the city.\n\nThe BMRCL is expecting the second train by the end of July and the third one by the 15th of August. Even though CRRC-TRSL will be delivering a fleet of 15 trains for the Yellow Line, the BMRCL is expecting to launch the operations with only five or six trains."
