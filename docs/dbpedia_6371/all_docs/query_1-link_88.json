        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nORBITNEXT is a diversified management consulting and research firm that works with government agencies, global corporations, institutions, infrastructure and social organizations to achieve lasting results. They have developed innovative solutions to the problems faced by all government agencies when implementing software applications.\n\nGovernments around the world need to provide their citizens with affordable, efficient and transparent public services, inclusive growth opportunities, comprehensive national security and defense systems, and effective disaster management. The misunderstood requirements, long and complex development cycles and need for an army of high skilled developers are the major contributors for failures.\n\nVarious research agencies put out figures showing that over 60% of her software offers users less than 50% of the benefits she does. These issues are efficiently addressed with Axpert™, a digital software platform with native cloud capabilities.\n\nAxpert™ is a software platform that enables you to build applications for billing, order management, manufacturing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, master data management, financial accounting, project management, and more. You can choose to develop several business processes in Axpert™ and interact with your existing software applications.\n\nABOUT BMRCL\n\nBangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), a joint venture of Government of India and Government of Karnataka, is a Special Purpose Vehicle entrusted with the responsibility of implementation and operation of Bangalore Metro Rail Project.\n\nBangalore Metro, christened as “Namma Metro”, not only adds to the beauty of Bangalore city skyline, but more importantly provides a safe, quick, reliable and comfortable public transport system. Besides this, Namma Metro is a major environment friendly addition to the Bangalore City as it significantly contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nMetro services have been in operation on 69.66 KM.\n\n(a) East-West corridor of 39.34 km: 13.71 km from Krishnarajapura to Whitefield (Kadugodi) Metro Station AND 25.63 km starting from Baiyappanahalli in the East and terminating at Kengeri Terminal in the West\n\n(b) North-South corridor of 30.32 km commencing at Nagasandra in the North and terminating at Silk Institute in the South.\n\nThis is the First Metro rail project in India commissioned with 750V DC Third Rail Traction on Standard Gauge.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nGlobally available practices and processes are hard to adopt in Indian conditions. In the Same time ERP must also provide functional scope, flexibility, and maintainability equal or better than international brands offer.\n\nWhen preparing to choose the right solution, BMRCL also applies strict standards chosen because they has been betting for a long time. A bad choice would be affects the construction process of the railway system, let alone the operation preparation. The company talked to international suppliers, analyzed their offers and make comparisons. In the end, ORBITNEXT just succeeded. However, not without demonstrate that the source code of the Axpert application can be decommissioned and completely rebuilt on a different development platform, just to remove the dependency on seller. They then put Axpert through a rigorous safety review process.\n\nSolutions\n\nBMRCL wanted to consolidate all operations into a single system with limited manual processes. This was one of the main goals of Axpert ERP’s decision to consolidate all operations into a single system with limited manual processes.\n\nA completely integrated software that maps every operation up to financial accounting\n\nManages\n\nContracts\n\nO&M and Station operations\n\nProperty Development\n\nPurchase & Inventory\n\nInvestments\n\nHR\n\nFixed Assets\n\nFinancial Accounting\n\nIntegrates\n\nAutomatic fare collection system\n\nStandard project management tools\n\nCustomize to need\n\nMaintain and extend yourself\n\nMANAGE CONTRACTS OF SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACTORS\n\nCONTROL OPERATIONS AT STATIONS\n\nFINANCIAL ACCOUNTING\n\nDigitized contracts\n\nManage bank guarantees\n\nRunning bill accounting\n\nFinal bill accounting\n\nManage advances\n\nVerify payments against terms of the contract\n\nCustomizable approval flow\n\nMulti-currency payment options\n\nAutomatic posting to financial accounting\n\nTOM Operations\n\nTVM Operations\n\nCash Management\n\nExit gate Tokens\n\nInventory Control\n\nTickets\n\nCards\n\nTokens\n\nManage Defective tokens\n\nManaging Non Cash Transactions\n\nOnline Card Purchase & Top Up\n\nGeneral Ledger\n\nMulti-Currency\n\nFinancial Statements as per Schedule VI of the companies Act\n\nTaxation\n\nBRS\n\nAll Statutory Reposts\n\nLoan Ledgers\n\nAuto Posting of Vouchers For\n\nContractors bills and advantages\n\nPurchases\n\nPayroll\n\nProperty Management System\n\nInvestments\n\nAutomatic RTGS and NEFT Payments\n\nBENEFITS\n\nContract Management\n\nContracts are maintained in the system, including digital copies of documents. Advance payments, stage-billing and settlements are driven by contract terms, with no need for manual verification. Multi-currency support and Contract/Supplier- specific workflows were needed. Various back guarantees related to contracts were to be recorded and tracked. Accounting was to be automated. Several service contracts and rate contracts need to be administered.\n\nRevenue Management\n\nThird-party ticketing system data was to be synchronized with the ERP, with automated update of books. Cash deposits from counters were to be recorded and tallied. Gate token stocks, sales and scrapping (defectives) were to be managed by the ERP. Support for online top-up of smartcard tickets was needed.\n\nProperty Management\n\nAutomated invoicing, ability to edit invoices and charging of interests and penalties. Purchases & Inventory Management Management of DLP stocks, tools & consumables; Procurement of equipment.\n\nTHE ADVANTAGES FOR BMRCL\n\nORBITNEXT gave BMRCL the freedom to have its own unique processes, in tune with the skills available with the team and local work preferences.\n\nBMRCL saved a lot of money compared to any packaged software alternative, which would need expensive customisation. Coding platforms would not have given it the kind of agility and flexibility that Axperttm offer.\n\nBy using Axperttm (LOWCODE, NOCODE), OrbitNext gave BMRCL the option to extend the ERP horizontally, with new features & functionality, or vertically, with deeper features. BMRCL could choose to build only as much as it wanted, when it wanted – instead of starting with a heavy application with a number of unwanted features. Users got exactly what they wanted."
