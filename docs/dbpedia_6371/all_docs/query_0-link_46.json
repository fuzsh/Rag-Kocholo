        "text": "Namma Metro's long-awaited Yellow Line could finally commence operations later this year with an initial fleet of five to six trains, running every 20 minutes. This development follows the initiation of full-scale trial runs on the extensively delayed corridor.\n\nThe Yellow Line is part of Phase 2 of the Bengaluru Metro project and will connect R V Road in the south of the city to Bommasandra, a fast-growing suburb on the outskirts of Bengaluru.\n\nThe metro line passes via Jayadeva, Central Silk Board and Electronics City.\n\nOn Thursday (13 June), the train embarked on a trial run from Bommasandra at 12.43 pm, stopping at each of the 14 intermediate stations for two minutes before reaching RV Road. Following a half-hour pause at RV Road, the train commenced its return journey to Bommasandra. Throughout the trial, tests were conducted to evaluate signalling and track conditions.\n\nBMRCL Managing Director Maheshwar Rao M described this as the \"start of the regular trial run to commission the line.\" He explained, \"It will keep happening and go on for three to four months. When the second and third trains come, we will do other tests and go for approval from the CMRS,\" referring to the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety. Rao also noted that the speed of the trains would be gradually increased as the trials proceed.\n\nRao indicated that the BMRCL expects to receive the second train by the end of July and the third by 15 August. While a total of 15 trains will eventually serve the Yellow Line, the BMRCL aims to begin commercial operations with just five to six trains.\n\n\"We can start commercial operations with five to six trains and a 20-minute headway,\" Rao added, expressing optimism about the anticipated launch later this year, reports Deccan Herald.\n\nThough civil work and track-laying on the 19.15-km Yellow Line has been completed for some time, the commencement of commercial operations has been hindered by a shortage of trains.\n\nIn 2019, China's CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co Ltd secured a Rs 1,578-crore contract to supply 216 coaches to Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). While twelve coaches were manufactured in China, the remaining are being assembled in India by CRRC's partner, Titagarh Rail System Ltd (TRSL), based in Bengal.\n\nThe BMRCL received a prototype six-coach train from China in February this year. After conducting static and electrical circuit testing at the Hebbagodi depot, BMRCL began trial runs between Bommasandra and Bommanahalli (12.5 km) in early March. It took an additional three months to extend the trial runs to cover the entire Yellow Line, spanning from RV Road to Bommasandra.\n\nYellow Line\n\nThe Yellow Line will include stops at R V Road, Ragigudda, Jayadeva Hospital, BTM Layout, Central Silk Board, Bommanahalli, Singasandra, Electronic City, Bommasandra, Hongasandra, Kudlu Gate, Hosa Road, Beratena Agrahara, Konappana Agrahara, Huskuru Road, and Hebbagodi.\n\nOriginally, the whole Yellow Line was scheduled to be finished in 2021, and the deadline was later pushed back to December 2022.\n\nAccording to the 2011 DPR (detailed project report), residents of Jayanagar, BTM Layout and HSR Layout as well as those who work in Electronics City and Bommasandra Industrial Area would benefit from the line."
