        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe transportation system plays a vital role in a part of any country as it contributes to social and economic development. Transportation was built closely with well-organized movements and the development of humans throughout the history of the world.\n\nTransportation played a part in the industrial, economic, social, and cultural development of all regions in every commodity produced which includes agricultural to industries at various stages of production to distribution. The transportation system includes planning, design, development, maintenance, and improvement. The increasing vehicular traffic on the urban road in the network demand effective measure of traffic control on road – networks, mixed traffic creates congestion and traffic jam in road networks.\n\nThe land use feature and transportation system are interdependent as it contributes to improving and expanding the transportation network. If the system is efficient, safe, and economical, the development of the city improves with better accessibility. Mass rapid transit system projects like metro rails are expected to improve traffic and road safety conditions (reduced vehicular traffic, traffic congestion, road accidents, etc.) and environmental conditions (air and noise pollution) in urban areas Studies have been conducted to assess the overall potential and efficiency of the metro rail in terms of easing the traffic scenario in Bengaluru city through commuter perception.\n\nThe use of metro services by the public is known to decongest urban traffic. The public can use metro services when the outermost destinations are directly accessible to metro stations. Issues with connectivity from home or destinations to access the metro can lead to the choice of modal shift. In this regard, the last mile connectivity study is undertaken to evaluate the last mile problems. Last mile connectivity is defined as the movement of public goods from a transportation area to their final destination such as home or workplace. This is usually used in telecommunications, chain management, and transportation planning describing transportation efficiency. When users have difficulty getting from their starting location to a final transportation network, the scenario is alternatively\n\nknown as the problem in the first mile. Vice versa Last mile problem refers to difficulty getting conveyance from the transportation network to the users’ destination.\n\nDevelopment of Transport Systems\n\nThe quest for rail-based solutions began close to 40 years ago in 1983 in Bengaluru when a Commuter Rail system was first proposed. Since then, road traffic has grown by leaps and bounds as street-based transport has remained the only option, even as\n\nBMTC buses became inefficient, unreliable, and unpredictable due to increasing traffic congestion.\n\nIf all goes well, the bulk of Bangalore’s Public Transport commuters will be moving in trains over rail tracks rather than on roads by around 2032. Plans that have been pending for a long are finally being implemented to expand Metro and add Suburban\n\nRail to cover large parts of the city with a combined urban rail network totaling over 400 km.\n\nHigh Traffic Congestion Reports state that the total number of motorized vehicles in the city would be well over 10 million by end of the year 2022. The number of motorized vehicles in the city was 2.64 million in 2008. This had shot up to over 8 million by 2019 at an average CAGR rate of growth of 10.32. If this trend were to continue, the city will have over 14.5 million vehicles by 2025 itself.\n\nBus Transportation\n\nBus commuters increasingly have moved to two-wheelers, cars, and other more nimble vehicles of all sizes including door-to-door taxis that can be hailed over a mobile phone. Wrestling to gain advantage on streets with vehicles jostling for space has thus reached alarming proportions. No matter how excellent the supply side of public transport may be, services can only have as much quality and punctuality as traffic conditions will allow. This aspect is overlooked when calls are being made to increase bus services multi-fold to address public transport deficiencies. At the same time, buses do have enormous reach as city road networks are vast. Hence buses have an important role to play since tracks can’t be built everywhere for trains since they require a lot of space and are far more capital intensive.\n\nExpansion of Rail-Based Transportation\n\nThe expansion of Metro and the development of a Suburban Rail system on dedicated tracks are steps that were long overdue in the city. These steps are now being taken by the government in an attempt to shift public transport users off the streets onto exclusive track systems for faster commutes. During Phases 2 and 3, Bengaluru Metro (popularly called ‘Namma Metro) is likely to add 211.6 km to the existing 42.3 km that has been in operation since 2017 (built under Phase 1). About 14 km under Phase 2 has been commissioned in 2021. Thus, 56.1 km is currently operational. Two new lines are expected to be commissioned by 2024-25 and the Airport line is likely to get ready by 2026-27.\n\nRail Network Connecting Most of the Areas\n\nMetro’s Phase-3 routes and stations have been announced and Detailed Project Reports (DPR) is under preparation. It is likely that construction may begin by 2025 with an estimated completion target of 2032. Route selections appear reasonably good\n\nto cover most parts and activity centers. On completion, the Metro network will have eight lines. Two lines would be aligned around the circle of the Outer Ring Road. The remaining six routes are mostly radial and will have intersections with the Ring line/s (some lines will intersect at multiple points). The three North-South Metro lines will provide easy access to central CBDs as they cut through the city’s central areas. The four Suburban routes will supplement the Metro system and offer faster commutes over longer distances (thus, it will more or less be an ‘express’ mass transit system with much fewer halts than the metro). The existing East-West metro Line (Purple line) will in the future be supplemented by the Parijaata Suburban Line that deviates from the Purple line’s route when within ORR but converges outside ORR at both ends. It is hoped that the onslaught of motorization will slow down, if not halt once these extensive rail-based travel options are made available. Road expansions need to be minimized; just enough to take care of necessities to operate buses or reach public transport, particularly in peripheral areas where the secondary and tertiary road networks are in poor condition, and also to assist commuters to reach trains easily.\n\nMajor Development Plan\n\nTo ease traffic congestion and with a focus on NammaMetro, suburban rail, and Peripheral Ring Road (PRR), underlining the need for a better mass transit system, a new 35-km Metro line connecting Sarjapur to Hebbal through Agara, Koramangala, and Dairy Circle at an estimated cost of Rs 15,000 crore has been announced by the present Bommai government in Bengaluru. A detailed project report (DPR) for this line is proposed to be prepared in FY 2022-23. Of the 35km, Hebbal to Koramangala (16. 8km) will be underground, and the remaining Koramangala to Sarjapurstretch (18.6km) will be elevated. BMRCL yet, have not stated anything clearly on whether this corridor will be taken up in Phase 3A or Phase 4 and also on its deadline but mentioned that several traffic studies need to be conducted before preparing the DPR. The BMRCL also disclosed that they plan to take up this corridor in the next phase. Experts and activists have welcomed the announcement since the proposed route cuts through the city’s core areas.\n\nEarlier, BMRCL had drawn flak for focusing on Bengaluru outskirts, allegedly due to political pressure. It may be noted that, around nine years ago, BMRCL had proposed the Carmelaram-Yelahanka line, which was to be taken up under Phase 3, but it was later put into cold storage reportedly for the controversial elevated- corridor project. Now, it has been truncated to Sarjapur-Hebbal. The KR Puram-KIA Metro corridor will cover the Hebbal-Yelahanka section, so it makes sense to have a SarjapurHebbal line. The Bommai government has also announced adding another 33km of Metro line to the existing network in 2022-23. With the addition, the NammaMetro will have an 89km network. The 58-km Outer Ring Road-Kempegowda International Airport Metro corridor will be completed by March 2025. The DPR of Namma Metro’s Phase 3 corridors —32 Km Hebbal JP Nagar and 13 Km Hosahalli-Kadabagere lines— at an estimated cost of Rs 11,250 crore soon shall be submitted to the Centre for approval. The state government has said that the Peripheral Ring Road project will be implemented at a cost of Rs 21,091 crore under the DBFOT (design, build, finance, operate, and transfer) model. The contractor will bear the cost of land acquisition and construction. The government has stated that the 148-km Bengaluru suburban railway project will be completed by 2026 at an estimated cost of Rs 15,267 crore. A skywalk shall also be constructed at a cost of Rs 45 crore at Banashankari junction to connect the Metro station with the bus stand. Similarly, Metro stations will be connected to their nearest railway stations at a cost of Rs 55 crore in White-field, KR Puram, Byappanahalli, Yeshwantpur, Jnanabharathiand Yelahanka.\n\nLast Mile Connectivity: A Need"
