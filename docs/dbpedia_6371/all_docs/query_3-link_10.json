The company has collaborated with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This agreement entails the naming rights of the Bommasandra Metro Station on the yellow line of the RV Road to Bommasandra Line (Reach-5), a crucial part of the Bangalore Metro Rail Project.\n\nUnder this collaboration, Delta India will contribute Rs. 65 crore towards the construction of the Bommasandra Metro Station. The initial payment of Rs. 10 crore has already been made. In return, BMRCL will grant the Bommasandra Metro Station the name “Delta Electronics- Bommasandra Metro Station” for a duration of 30 years.\n\nExpressing gratitude for the collaboration, Benjamin Lin, the president of Delta Electronics India, stated that it was an honor to contribute to Bengaluru’s sustainable development.
