        "text": "In a momentous occasion commemorating its 20th anniversary in India, Delta Electronics India Pvt Ltd (Delta India) announced a transformative partnership with Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). The two entities have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the naming rights of the Bommasandra Metro Station on the yellow line of RV Road to Bommasandra Line (Reach-5) as part of Phase-II of the Bangalore Metro Rail Project.\n\nUnder this agreement, Delta India will contribute Rs. 65 Crores towards the construction of the Bommasandra Metro Station, with an initial payment of Rs. 10 Crores already made. As per the agreement BMRCL will be offering the naming rights of Bommasandra Metro Station as ‘Delta Electronics- Bommasandra Metro Station’ for a period of 30 years\n\nMr. Benjamin Lin, President of Delta Electronics India, remarked, “We are incredibly proud to have the opportunity to contribute to the sustainable development of Bengaluru. Partnering with BMRCL on the Bommasandra Metro Station aligns perfectly with our global commitment to foster sustainable cities. This new station will provide much-needed connectivity for residents and commuters, while also promoting a cleaner and more efficient transportation system for the city.”\n\nDelta Electronics Inc. is a global leader in power management and a provider of IoT-based smart green solutions. Mirroring this commitment to environmental protection, Delta India has actively promoted energy-efficient products and services nationwide for the past two decades. This investment in the Bommasandra Metro Station further exemplifies Delta India’s dedication to supporting sustainable urban development in Bangalore.\n\nMr. M. Maheshwar Rao, Managing Director, BMRCL, expressed his delight about the partnership, stating, “We are delighted to partner with Delta Electronics India on this crucial infrastructure project. Their contribution of Rs. 65 Crores for the Bommasandra Metro Station signifies a remarkable support for sustainable urban development. This innovative financing mechanism sets a valuable precedent for future collaborations. We commend Delta India for their dedication to sustainability and look forward to working together to create a more connected and environmentally conscious city.”\n\nThe development of the Bommasandra Metro Station through Delta India’s contribution showcases a ground-breaking approach to infrastructure projects.
