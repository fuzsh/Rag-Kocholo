Out of the 73.921 km length of new track, 13.885 km will be underground while the rest will be built elevated.\n\nThe project faced funding issues due to which a majority of civil construction contracts were awarded only in the first half of 2017. While the Purple Line’s extension to Challeghata & Green Line’s extension to Anjanapura Township will be ready in 2020-21, the entire phase, including a 13.885 km underground section, is expected to be ready in sections, only in 2026. Once Phase 2 is operational, the network’s total length will become 116.19 km. Major lenders providing official development assistance (ODA) loans for this phase’s construction and procurement of systems are European Investment Bank (EIB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and possibly Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nThis phase involves the construction of 2 new lines on standard gauge tracks & the extension of both lines built in Phase 1 in all 4 directions.\n\nNew Lines\n\nOfficial line colours were announced in November 2019\n\nLine-3 (Yellow Line): RV Road – Bommasandra\n\nLength : 19.143 km\n\nType : Elevated\n\nDepot : Hebbagodi Depot (39.3 acres)\n\nNumber of Stations : 16\n\nStation Names : Rashtreeya Vidyalaya Road (RV Road), Ragigudda, Jayadeva Hospital, BTM Layout, Central Silkboard, Bommanahalli (formerly HSR Layout), Hongasandra (formerly Oxford College), Kudlu Gate (formerly Muneshwara Nagar), Singasandra (formerly Chikkabegur), Hosa Road (formerly Basapura Road), Beratena Agrahara (formerly Hosa Road), Electronic City, Infosys Foundation Konappana Agrahara (formerly Electronic City – II), Huskur Road, Hebbagodi and Bommasandra\n\nLine-4 (Pink Line): Kalena Agaraha (formerly Gottigere) – Nagawara\n\nLength : 21.386 km\n\nType : Elevated (7.501 km) and Underground (13.885 km)\n\nDepot : Kothanur Depot (31.5 acres)\n\nNumber of Stations : 18\n\nStation Names : Kalena Agrahara (formerly Gottigere), Hulimavu, IIM-Bangalore, JP Nagar 4th Phase, Jayadeva Hospital, Swagath Road Cross, Dairy Circle, Lakkasandra (foremerly Mico Industries), Langford Town, Rashtriya Military School (formerly Vellara Road), MG Road, Shivaji Nagar, Cantonment, Pottery Town, Tannery Road, Venkateshpura, Kadugundanahalli (formerly Arabic College) and Nagawara\n\nPhase 2 (Line Extensions)\n\nLine-1 (Purple Line): Mysore Road – Challaghatta\n\nLength : 8.814 km\n\nType : Elevated\n\nNew Depot : Challagatta Depot (38.9 acre; for entire line)\n\nNumber of Stations : 7\n\nStation Names : Nayandahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Jnana Bharathi (formerly Bangalore University Cross), Pattanagere, Kengeri Bus Terminal (formerly Mailasandra), Kengeri and Challeghatta\n\nStatus : 7.5 km Mysore Road – Kengeri section inaugurated on August 30, 2021\n\nLine-1 (Purple Line): Baiyyappanahalli – Whitefield\n\nLength : 15.257 km\n\nType : Elevated\n\nNew Depot : Kadugodi Depot in Whitefield (44.8 acres; for entire line)\n\nNumber of Stations : 13\n\nStation Names : Benniganahalli (formerly Jyothipuram / Tin Factory), KR Puram, Saraswati Nagar (formerly Mahadevapura), Gurudacharpalya, Hoodi Junction (erst.

Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. invited bids for geotechnical investigation and DGPS, topographic, land & property surveys in June 2016. The line’s Detailed Project Report (DPR), prepared by BMRCL’s in-house team, was revealed in November 2016 and estimates the line’s construction & system procurement to cost Rs 4202 crores.\n\nThe Karnataka government’s cabinet approved the project’s DPR in March 2017. Back then, instead of relying on foreign lenders, the BMRCL had planned to fund this line through what it called an “innovative financing model” in which private entities would have been engaged to pitch in anywhere from 25% to 50% of the line’s construction cost (Rs. 1100-2100 crores) and in return be granted exclusive advertising and leasing rights within the stations to monetize on their investment. By February 2018, BMRCL had only signed only 2 MoUs worth approximately Rs 100 crore each.\n\nIn 2018-2019, the BMRCL invited bids for the line’s construction in 3 packages. During that time, BMRCL was unable to achieve financial closure and the lowest bidder for all 3 packages, IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited, was hit by financial troubles. In December 2019, BMRCL re-invited tenders for its construction. Technical bids were opened in March 2020 to reveal 9 bidders, and financial bids were opened in October to reveal Afcons Infrastructure and Shankarnarayana Construction as the lowest bidders. Construction contracts were awarded in May 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, Phase 2A was approved by the Central Government’s cabinet. Phase 2A and Phase 2B (KR Puram – Yelahanka – Bangalore Airport) will be funded through a $500 million loan by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which was approved by its board in December 2020. In addition, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will provide a $318 million loan as well. A formal agreement for it was signed in March 2021.\n\nFunding (Phase 2a)\n\nEstimated Cost : Rs. 5,227.35 crore\n\nADB : Rs. 1,479.46 crore\n\nJICA : Rs. 893 crore (preliminary negotiation)\n\nPPP Sources : Rs. 600 crore\n\nState Govt : Rs. 1,690.46 crore\n\nCentral Govt : Rs. 734.22 crore\n\nRoute Information\n\nLine-5 (Blue Line): KR Puram – Central Silkboard\n\nLength : 18.236 km\n\nType : Elevated\n\nNumber of Stations : 13\n\nStation Names : KR Puram (interchange with the under construction Purple Line), Mahadevpura, DRDO Sports Complex, Doddanakundi, ISRO, Marathahalli, Kodibisanahalli, Kadubeesanahalli, Bellandur, Ibbalur, Agara Lake, HSR Layout, Silk Board (interchange with the upcoming Yellow Line).\n\nDepot : Trains on the ORR line will be stabled and & maintained at the existing Baiyappanahalli Depot. Some of the Purple Line’s existing stabling lines will be re-purposed for this line and due to that, a new depot for the Purple Line will be built at Kadugodi near Hope Farm Junction (view suggested layout) where government land is available. At a later stage, the Baiyappanahalli Depot will exclusively be used by this new line’s trains while the Purple Line’s trains will be stabled & maintained at Kadugodi Depot and Challaghatta Depot.\n\nRolling Stock : BMRCL plans to initially procure 120 coaches (20 train-sets x 6 coaches), and operate them in a DMC-TC-MC+MC-TC-DMC formation from the get-go.\n\nDetails : Phase 2B\n\n37 km Bangalore (Namma) Metro Phase 2B project is an under construction “airport-link” section of Blue Line from Bengaluru city to Kempegowda International Airport (KIAL) in Devanahalli with 17 stations.\n\nA metro line to the airport has been on the drawing board since 2005 when construction commenced on the city’s airport. It was first envisioned as a high-speed rail link connecting the city’s CBD (MG Road) to be executed by a special purpose vehicle independent of the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation.\n\nIn October 2015, RITES suggested 2 routes to the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL). In September 2016, BMRCL sought suggestions from the public on 9 routes; they went on to finalize 4 routes in late-April 2017. In May 2017, they picked the route extending Line-4 via Nagawara, RK Hegde Nagar, Jakkur & Yelahanka. In January 2019, the Karnataka Government announced the approval of the line’s 37 km route with 17 stations as an extension of Line-5 (ORR Line) via KR Puram, Nagawara, Hebbal & Yelahanka.\n\nPhase 2A and Phase 2B (KR Puram – Yelahanka – Bangalore Airport) will be funded through a $500 million loan by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which was approved by its board in December 2020. In addition, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will provide a $318 million loan as well. A formal agreement for it was signed in March 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, Phase 2B was approved by the Central Government’s cabinet. BMRCL has not published Phase 2B’s DPR (Detailed Project Report) online.\n\nFunding (Phase 2B)\n\nEstimated Cost : 9,616.51 crore\n\nADB : Rs. 2,410.79 crore\n\nJICA : Rs. 1,310.74 crore\n\nPPP Sources : Rs. 800 crore\n\nState Govt : Rs. 4,074.34 crore\n\nCentral Govt : Rs. 1,260.54 crore\n\nBids for Phase 2B’s construction work, through 3 civil packages, were invited in July 2019. Construction work is expected to start in Q4 2021.\n\nRoute Information\n\nLine-5 (Blue Line): KR Puram – Hebbal – KIAL Terminals\n\nLength : 37 km\n\nType : Elevated, At-Grade and Underground (within the airport)\n\nDepot : Shettigere Depot (in addition to Phase 2A’s Baiyappanahalli Depot)\n\nNumber of Stations : 17\n\nStation Names : Kasturinagara, Horamavu, HRBR Layout (erst. Babusaheb Palya), Kalyan Nagar, HBR layout, Nagawara, Veerannapalya, Kempapura, Hebbal, Kodigehalli, Jakkur Cross, Yelahanka (erst. Kogilu Cross), Bagalur Cross (erst. Bagalur/PRR Cross), Bettahalasuru, Doddajala (erst. Trumpet Junction), Airport City (erst. Sky Garden, to be built at-grade) and KIAL Terminals (erst. Airport Terminal, to be built partially underground)\n\nDetails : Phase 3\n\nBangalore (Namma) Metro’s Phase 3 project is currently in the planning stage with routes totaling 105.55 km being explored since 2015. Pre-feasibility and techno-economic feasibility studies by RITES and BMRCL were prepared in 2016. Karnataka’s state government approved the preparation of the project’s detailed project report (DPR) in February 2018 and the work for it was assigned to RITES in July 2020. The first draft is expected to get ready by mid-2023. Construction on Phase 3 is expected to begin in 2025 and end in the mid 2030s. By the time construction begins, multiple changes in the project’s scope & alignment can be expected to take place.\n\nEstimated Cost : N/A (Pending Route Finalization & Approval)\n\nPhase 3 Deadline : Not Finalized (Pending Route Finalization & Approval)\n\nNew Lines\n\nCarmelaram – Yelahanka (37 km, shown in Brown) – DPR bids invited April 2022\n\nMarathahalli – Hosakerehalli (21 km, shown in Red)\n\nSilkboard – KR Puram – Hebbal (29 km, shown in Blue)\n\nThe 18 km Silkboard – KR Puram section has been fast-tracked and allocated to Phase 2A. In March 2017, the Karnataka Government’s cabinet approved its DPR. Official line colors are yet to be announced.\n\nExtensions of Existing Lines\n\nNagavara – Airport (23 km)\n\nIn May 2017, the airport line’s route was finalized via RK Hegde Nagar – Jakkur – Yelahanka. In 2018, it was decided to be developed under Phase 2B as an extension of the Silkboard – KR Puram line instead.\n\nIn addition, here are some other potential lines on the drawing board –\n\nJP Nagar to K R Puram via Hebbal\n\nMagadi Road Toll Gate to Kadabagere\n\nGottigere to Basavapura\n\nRK Hegde Nagar to Aerospace Park\n\nKogilu Cross to Rajanukunte\n\nBommasandra to Attibele\n\nIblur to Carmelaram\n\nIn March 2020, Karnataka’s Chief Minister announced during the budget speech that 2 corridors will be developed as metrolite lines through the public private partnership (PPP) model and the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for both will be prepared. These 2 corridors are:\n\nORR West Line: Hebbal to Mysore Road Metro Station (30 km)\n\nMagadi Road Toll Gate to Kadabagere (14 km)\n\nConclusions\n\nBangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), a joint venture of Government of India and Government of Karnataka, is a Special Purpose Vehicle entrusted with the responsibility of implementation and operation of Bangalore Metro Rail Project.\n\nBangalore Metro, christened as “Namma Metro”, not only adds to the beauty of Bangalore city skyline, but more importantly provides a safe, quick, reliable and comfortable public transport system. Besides this, Namma Metro is a major environment friendly addition to the Bangalore City as it significantly contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nMetro services have been in operation on 56 KM on East-West corridor – 25.6 km long, starting from Baiyappanahalli in the East and terminating at Kengeri Terminal in the West and on 30.4 km North-South corridor commencing at Nagasandra in the North and terminating at Silk Institute in the South. This is the First Metro rail project in India commissioned with 750V DC Third Rail Traction on Standard Gauge. Bangalore Metro is developing fast and expected to help in decongesting the city traffic significantly. The city is popularly called the IT capital of India and is amongst one of the fastest growing cities of the world."
