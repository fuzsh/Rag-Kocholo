        "text": "Bengaluru, India (Metro Rail Today): In a significant development for the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), Maheshwar Rao M., a seasoned officer of the 1995 batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) from the Karnataka cadre, has assumed the role of full-time Managing Director. He succeeds Mr. Anjum Parvez, bringing with him a wealth of experience and expertise. The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has issued his appointment order on 11th January 2024.\n\nBefore he was appointed Managing Director, Rao held the position of Additional Secretary and Financial Advisor at the Department of Space in Bengaluru. His extensive experience in administrative services and financial management positions him as a fitting leader to guide the BMRCL through its ongoing and future projects.\n\nRao, an alumnus of the University of Hyderabad, where he completed his MA in Economics during the 1991-93 batch, also holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, Economics, and Statistics from Nizam College.\n\nBangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) operates as a joint venture between the Government of India and the Government of Karnataka. Functioning as a Special Purpose Vehicle, BMRCL is entrusted with the responsibility of implementing and operating the Bangalore Metro Rail Project.\n\nBMRCL's metro service, known as \"Namma Metro,\" not only enhances the aesthetics of Bangalore's skyline but crucially provides a safe, quick, reliable, and comfortable public transport system for the residents. Beyond convenience, Namma Metro is a noteworthy addition to the city's environmental efforts, actively contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nAs of now, metro services are operational on a substantial 73.81 km network, encompassing two major corridors:\n\nEast-West Corridor: Spanning 43.49 km, from Whitefield (Kadugodi) in the east to Challaghatta Terminal in the west.\n\nNorth-South Corridor: Covering 30.32 km, commencing at Nagasandra in the North and concluding at Silk Institute in the South.\n\nAn innovative aspect of this metro project is its adoption of 750V DC Third Rail Traction on Standard Gauge, making it the first of its kind in India.\n\nAs Maheshwar Rao takes the reins as Managing Director, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited looks ahead to a future of continued expansion, efficiency, and sustainability under his capable leadership.\n\nWe wish him the very best in his new role, confident in his ability to steer BMRCL towards new heights."
