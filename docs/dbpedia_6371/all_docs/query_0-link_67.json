The agency responsible for its implementation is the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL). The first stretch between Baiyyappanahalli to M.G. Road was inaugurated on October 20, 2011.[4] The metro is expected to reduce the traffic volume in areas like Majestic (Kempegowda Bus station and Bangalore Railway Station), Sampige Road, Hudson Circle and M.G. Road.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n\n1.1 History\n\n1.2 Construction\n\n1.2.1 Phase I\n\n1.2.2 Phase II\n\n1.2.3 High-speed rail link\n\n1.3 Funding\n\n2 Network\n\n3 Infrastructure\n\n3.1 Rolling stock\n\n3.2 Power supply\n\n3.3 Signaling and communications\n\n3.4 Facilities and services\n\n3.5 Safety\n\n4 Operations\n\n4.1 Fares\n\n4.2 Ticketing\n\n4.3 Frequency\n\n4.4 Ridership\n\n4.5 Security\n\n5 Gallery\n\n6 See also\n\n7 References\n\n8 External links\n\nBackground\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough mass transit for Bangalore had been in consideration for over two decades, the final approval on a scheme that incorporated the expertise of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Indian Government-owned RITE infrastructure and transport consultancy did not come until April 2006. The rationale for the metro includes reduced journey times, cutting fuel use, accident reduction and lower pollution.\n\nA detailed project report prepared by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and RITES envisaged a 33 km (21 mi) elevated and underground rail network with 32 stations for Phase I of the project. The proposed gauge was standard gauge unlike the broad gauge on the Delhi Metro network.\n\nConstruction work for Phase I of the project was scheduled to start in 2005 but was delayed by a February 2006 change of government in the state of Karnataka and continued debate over whether the project was financially feasible and appropriate for the city. Finally, on 25 April 2006 the Indian cabinet approved the project, which was then budgeted at more than 5,400 crore (US$1.1 billion) (Later revised to 11,609 crore (US$2.35 billion) for Phase I).[6] In 2006, Navayuga Engineering was awarded the contract to construct Reach 1 of the East-West line.[7]\n\nThe foundation stone for the Phase I construction was laid by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on June 24, 2006,[8] and civil construction on the line between MG Road and Baiyyappanahalli commenced on April 15, 2007.[9]\n\nIn 2007, BMRCL announced that it would incorporate a northern extension (from Yeshwantpur to Hessarghatta Cross) and part of the southern extension (from RV Road to Puttenahalli) in Phase I, thus extending the length of Phase I network to about 42 km (26 mi), with 40 stations. The objective of this was to connect the Metro to the Outer Ring Road at both ends, as also cover the industrial areas of Peenya in the North-West, thereby providing better connectivity and increasing ridership.[citation needed] In October 2008, the Government of Karnataka approved this extension, which would cost an additional 1,592 crore (US$322.86 million).[10]\n\nThe Bangalore Metro project was originally scheduled to be launched in March 2010. After the deadline was missed, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) shifted the deadline to December 31, 2010. It was again changed to April 4, 2011 and then the date of inauguration was set at 15 September 2011. The next deadline set was 26 September 2011 which was also missed. The metro was finally opened for public on 20 October 2011 at 4pm by Union Urban Development Minister Kamal Nath.[5] As per BMRCL sources within first 3 days of Bangalore Metro launch, more than 1 Crore people used this mass transit system.[11]\n\nHowever, there was a overwhelming response once the metro was thrown out to the public. At the end of 4th day about 2 lakhs passengers had already commuted in Namma Metro. Namma Metro's first 12-day cumulative revenue was 1 crore.[12]\n\nConstruction\n\nPhase I\n\nPhase I consists of 2 corridors[13]:\n\nRoute Corridor Elevated Length (km) Underground Length (km) Total Length (km) 1 East-West 13.22 4.88 18.10 2 North-South 20.20 4 24.20 Total 33.42 8.88 42.30\n\nImplementation of the elevated parts of Phase I has been divided into four \"reaches\". The expected schedule for Phase I is as follows:\n\nReach Terminals Opening date Reach-1 (east) Baiyyappanahalli M.G. Road 20 October 2011[5] Reach-2 (west) Mysore Road Magadi Road November 2012[14] Underground Section (east to west) Minsk Square Magadi Road August 2012 Reach-3 (north) Swastik Yeswanthpur August 2012[14] Reach-3A (north) Yeswanthpur Peenya Depot December 2012 Reach-3B (north) Peenya Village Station Hessarghatta Cross Station August 2013 Underground Section (north to south) Swastik K.R.Market (City Market) December 2013 Reach-4 (south) K.R. Road R.V. Road December 2013 Reach-4A (south) R.V.Road Puttenahalli March 2014\n\nThe Green line (Reach 3,3A & 3B) is scheduled to be thrown open to the public by the end of 2012. The remaining elevated sections of Purple Line (Reach 2) and Green Line (Reach 4) are scheduled to be completed by March–June, 2013. They would be opened to the public only after the completion of the underground stretches of the network. The underground stretches will become operational by the end of 2014.[15]\n\nPhase II\n\nCovering a span of 70 km, Phase II is an extension of all the four Reaches (Reach 1 to 4) and is expected to reduce road traffic by 35 percent. Additionally, initial plans for Phase II also features two new lines – one from Jayanagar (R.V.Road Terminal, Line 2) to Electronic City via Jayadeva Hospital, BTM Layout & Silk board and the second from Nagavara to IIM-B, running predominantly on the Bannerughatta Road, a total of 21 km of which around 15 km will be underground route. The estimated project cost for Phase II is around 25,000 crore (US$5.07 billion)\n\nRoute Terminals Length Stations ■ Line 1 Mysore Road – Kengeri 7.70 km 8 ■ Line 1 Baiyyappanahalli – Whitefield[16] 18 km 17 ■ Line 2 Puttenahalli – Anjanapura 6.79 km 6 ■ Line 2 Hesaraghatta cross – BIEC 4.2 km 4 ■ Line 3 IIM-B – Nagavara 21.1 km 20 ■ Line 4 R V Road – Bommasandra 17 km 15\n\nHigh-speed rail link\n\nThere is also a project to build a 35 km line known as Bangalore High-Speed Rail Link to the Bengaluru International Airport, probably starting at Cubbon Road.[16] Previously there was plan for an independent body but later on it was decided that BMRC will manage this project.[17]\n\nFunding\n\nThe cost of the 42.3-kilometre long Phase I was estimated to be around 11,609 crore. BMRCL received 700 crore from Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), 250 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the rest was obtained from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Central Government and the Karnataka State Government.[18]\n\nThe second phase of the project is expected to cost around 25,000 crore.\n\nNetwork\n\nMain article: List of Bangalore metro stations\n\nThe Phase I of Namma Metro, consists of two corridors that will cover a total of 42.30 km. Currently only a 6.7 km stretch between Baiyyappanahalli and M. G. Road on the East-West corridor is operational.\n\nLine First operational Last Extension Stations Length\n\n(km) Terminals Purple Line October 20, 2011 17 18.1 Baiyappanahalli Mysore Road Green Line 24 24.2 Nagasandra Putenhalli\n\nInfrastructure\n\nRolling stock\n\nThe specification for rolling stock is based on stainless steel-bodied three-car formations, a trailer between two motored driving units. Internal wide gangways will provide ease of passenger movement and assist load distribution. Trains will be air-conditioned throughout with designated space for disability access. Although with many automated functions, trains will be under driver control.\n\nThe capacity per train will be approximately 1,000 through longitudinal seating, giving a high proportion of the floor area to standing passengers. The maximum attainable speed will be 80 km/h (50 mph).[19]\n\nInitially the bids by Bombardier and Siemens, Alstom Projects India Ltd and Indian company BEML in a consortium with Mitsubishi and Korean rolling stock manufacturer Hyundai Rotem were shortlisted to supply the rolling stock and coaches. In February 2009, the consortium led by BEML was awarded the contract to supply 150 coaches and rolling stock for the first phase of the project. While Mitsubishi would supply the traction for the coaches, Hyundai Rotem would supply the rolling stock and BEML would supply the coaches for the first phase of the project.[20]\n\nThe first trainset made a trial run in December 2010[21]\n\nPower supply\n\nThe power for the system will be 750 V DC bottom contact third rail supply. In December 2009, the ABB Group was awarded the contract to provide power solutions for the first phase of the planned metro network. ABB will design, supply, install and commission four substations that receive and distribute electricity, each rated at 66/33 kV, as well as the auxiliary and traction substations. ABB will also provide an integrated network management, or SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), system to monitor and control the installations.[22]\n\nSignaling and communications\n\nThe integrated control centre will have direct communication with trains and stations which will also be CCTV fitted with visual and audio service information. Trains will be Wi-Fi enabled and passengers will have emergency voice communication with train staff.\n\nIn September 2009, the consortium led by Alstom Project India Limited were awarded a contract worth Rs. 563.4 crore (US$ 114.3 million) to supply control and signaling system for the first phase of the project. The consortium is led by Alstom and composed of Alstom Transport SA, Thales Security Solutions & Services Portugal and Sumitomo Corporation. Alstom will provide the design, manufacture, supply, installing, testing and commissioning of the train control and signaling system for the first phase of the metro system. It includes the Urbalis 200 Automatic Train Control system which will ensure optimal safety, flexible operations and heightened passenger comfort.[23][24]\n\nFacilities and services\n\nAll the Metro trains are Wi-Fi enabled (the first metro in India to have this feature), so passengers can use laptops, tablets as well as mobile internet. Passengers also have emergency voice communication with train staff through a speaker system. Passengers are provided with a call button to communicate anything to the driver or control center during an emergency. The integrated control center at Byappanahalli has direct communication with trains and stations which are CCTV-fitted with visual and audio service information.[25]\n\nMetro stations will have Powerheart Automated external defibrillator (AED) to protect its commuters against death from sudden cardiac arrest.[26] Powerheart AED is used for emergency treatment of victims exhibiting symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest. The installation of AEDs will be followed by a certified training for a group of staff members of BMRC. The devices are manufactured by Opto Circuits (India) Ltd.[27]\n\nSafety\n\nThe following information was provided by Sudhir Chandra, director, planning and projects, BMRCL in an interview to Times of India.[28]\n\nAnti-derailing\n\nThere are two levels of protection built to prevent derailment. BMRCL has installed derailment protection guards to prevent wheels straying from the track. Even if there is slight straying, the protection system will ensure the wheels move in a small space and pathway between the rail and derailment guard and come to a halt immediately within that space. The guard prevents the train from moving forward, forces it to a halt and prevents it from careening over. The second protection is anti-capsize concrete protection walls to prevent the train from falling off the viaduct. The walls have been designed to ensure the train is retained within the viaduct.\n\nAnti-collision\n\nBMRCL has installed the Automatic Train Protection System to ensure this does not happen. The system automatically senses if there is any object/train on the track ahead and activates the brakes even if the driver doesn't . The train comes to a halt a safe distance from the object/train ahead even if it is running at full speed.\n\nTo prevent overspeeding\n\nThe Automatic Train Protection and Operation System prescribes speeds from section to section, straight paths and curves, and if the train exceeds the speed limit, the brakes come on automatically.\n\nEarthquake proofing\n\nThe pillars have been built to last 100–120 years. They have been tested for the highest braking, temperature, wind, pressure and fatigue, and built to withstand quakes of Zone 3 type, though Bangalore falls in Zone 2 type. Every pier, pillar and concrete structure has 10% more strength than the designed or original strength. The design meets Indian earthquake standards.\n\nOperations\n\nFares\n\nThe minimum fare is 10 and maximum fare of Rs 15 for Reach-1.[29]\n\nTicketing\n\nNamma Metro uses Contactless Smart Tokens and Contactless smart card.[30] Tokens are available only for single journey. A person can buy up to 6 tokens for additional five passengers and himself.\n\nThere are 4 types of smart cards available on the metro – Varshik, Sanchar, Saral and Saraag.[31]\n\nVarshik is Priced at 100 and the smart card can then be recharged from 50 to up to 1,500. It has a one-year validity, with a 15% discount on travel fares.\n\nSanchar &ndash It is based on number of trips. It is available in denominations of 10, 40, 50 and 100.\n\nSaral is Priced at 70. It allows a day's travel in non-A/C buses of BMTC and the metro.\n\nSaraag is Priced at 110. It allows a day's travel in BMTC A/C buses and the metro.\n\nFrequency\n\nThe metro service runs between 0600 and 2200 hours. There are trains every 15 minutes between 6am and 8am, 10 minutes between 8am and 8pm, and 15 minutes between 8pm and 10pm.[32] The frequency is slated to decrease to three minutes by 2021. The travel time from end to end on the Purple Line will be 33 minutes, and on the Green Line will be 44 minutes. The system is designed for a maximum train speed of 80 kmph.\n\nRidership\n\nThe system has been designed for a capacity of 40,000 PHPDT. The number of passengers expected to travel on the metro everyday is estimated at 10.20 lakhs in 2011 and 16.10 lakhs in 2021 for the first phase of the project. The ridership for Reach-1 is estimated at 25,000 persons everyday.[33]\n\nSecurity\n\nWhen the service commences operation either the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) or an Namma Metro Police Force will be entrusted with the security to guard the mass transit system. CISF is overseeing the security of Delhi Metro after it was perceived to be high on the terror threat and is willing to provide security to Namma Metro.[34]\n\nGallery\n\nThe Baiyyappanahalli Terminal under construction\n\nCompleted section of the purple line towards Baiyyappanahalli\n\nSee also\n\nList of rapid transit systems\n\nIndian railways\n\nRail transport in India\n\n2010 in rail transport in India\n\nDelhi Metro\n\nKolkata Metro\n\nReferences"
