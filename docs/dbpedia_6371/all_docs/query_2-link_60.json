        "text": "Bengaluru metro commuters can now purchase single-journey QR-code tickets through WhatsApp and the ‘Namma Metro’ app, announced a Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) press release issued on Monday.\n\nThe QR-code tickets carry a 5% discount over the token fare for single-journey trips on Bengaluru’s metro, while the service can also be used to top-up metro cards. BMRCL works with “other companies” to provide the service through a business account, according to the account information.\n\nPayments can be made through WhatsApp’s native UPI (WhatsApp Pay), the press release adds. However, upon attempting to book a ticket using the services, this MediaNama journalist found that other online payment options routed through PayU are also available—such as by credit card, debit card, netbanking, wallets, UPI, and more.\n\n“The BMRCL is the first metro in the Global Transit Space to introduce an end-to-end ticketing system on WhatsApp,” the release claimed. The policy came into effect on November 1st, which also marks Kannada Rajyotsava, the state’s foundation day.\n\nWhy it matters: After a similar tie-up with Uber last year, this collaboration may help gather momentum for WhatsApp’s UPI prospects in India. As of January 2022, it had cornered 0.05% of the market share of UPI transactions—significantly trailing behind PhonePe (46.4%), Google Pay (34.4%), and PayTM (15.4%). However, reports suggest that these tides may be turning, with WhatsApp Pay recording higher transaction counts and volumes in July.\n\nThe service is available in Kannada and English for both iOS and Android users. Information on the nearest metro station, train timings, and the fare between two stations will also be provided by the Chatbot upon customer request. Customers can also submit feedback on their journeys.\n\nThis MediaNama journalist also requested the automated service for information on the privacy policy governing the system, for which no answer was returned as of the publication of this article. The communications with the BMRCL business account appear to otherwise be covered by WhatsApp’s privacy policy (the journalist was redirected here).\n\nHow WhatsApp-based Ticketing Works\n\nCommuters first have to save the number for the BMRCL Chatbot—8105556677. After that, send a “hi” to the Chatbot to start a conversation and purchase QR-code tickets. Once generated and downloaded, the tickets have to be flashed before QR code scanners placed at the entry and exit gates of metro stations.\n\nThe tickets are valid until the end of the revenue day on which they were purchased. Customers can cancel the tickets on the same day as they were booked for a full refund.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nWhile using the service, MediaNama initially found that one ticket purchase (between Swami Vivekananda Road and Sandal Soap Factory stations) simply returned the procedure for buying a single-journey token instead—this journey requires one line change. The process was bug-free for two other routes that do not require line changes (Swami Vivekananda Road and Majestic, Indiranagar and Majestic).\n\nHow WhatsApp-based Metro Card Top-ups Work\n\nThe Chatbot also allows commuters to check their metro card balance, as well as top-up their cards. To do this, commuters can either share their WhatsApp number (if linked to the card)—if unlinked, commuters can share their name and card number to retrieve this information.\n\nAfter processing this request, the first instance where this journalist was required to submit a name, an FAQ was placed on the service’s privacy policy. By this time, the Chatbot had recognised the name of the journalist, and addressed them by it during the query.\n\nRead More"
