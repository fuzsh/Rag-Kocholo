Tunnels often involve complex underground operations, heavy machinery, and intricate engineering processes, making the potential risks significant. Considering the inherently challenging and hazardous nature of such endeavours, prioritising safety ensures the well-being of construction workers, mitigates the likelihood of accidents, and fosters a secure working environment. Regulatory compliance, regular safety training, and incorporating advanced safety technologies are integral to ensuring a secure and successful outcome in tunnel construction projects. Agree with us?

Did my best related to design and drawings with its approval from Railway authority & brought the contractor on board within budget, with an aim to succeed as per time line. \"Bad luck\", due to management issues & lack of belief. Just came to know that the construction of the substation still has not started..... Leadership, Ownership & Responsibility is missing in this world due to management unwanted politics. But, in this world, performers need not to worry.... opportunity will automatically come to you if you're extraordinary & fair. Those who understand the values of individuals will definitely pick you without any doubt. Got the opportunity to construct 10 Nos 33kV Substations & one 132kV....
