But did you know that the first metro in the country started operations all the way back in 1984 in Kolkata. It is also the only metro rail network that is controlled by the Indian Railways; all others are operated by autonomous local authorities.\n\nThe second oldest after Kolkata Metro is Delhi Metro, which makes the largest and busiest network of all. Following the success of Delhi Metro, other cities in India also started exploring the option to implement metro projects. With this idea, more than INR 1 trillion was invested in metro projects in the year 2018-19.\n\nHistory of Metro Rail in India\n\nThe introduction of metro rail in India began in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) with the Kolkata Metro.
