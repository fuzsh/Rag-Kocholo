The Memorandum of Cooperation was signed by Thiru. T. Archunan Director (Projects), CMRL, and Thiru. P.R.Swarup, Director General of CIDC. CIDC, established by the Government of India in conjunction with Industry, serves as the apex representative organization actively engaging various constituents of the Indian Construction Industry. CMRL, the State agency for implementing metro projects in Tamil Nadu, contributes significantly to the development of urban transportation infrastructure. The MOC highlights the collaboration, cooperation, and complementation, aiming to streamline business processes, propagate best practices, and enhance safety, quality, and productivity. The Memorandum of Cooperation outlines key elements for both parties, prioritizing customer interest through efficiency enhancement, quality assurance systems, environmental protection, and standard operating procedures. It also emphasizes institutional and capacity building activities, holistic human resource development, research and development, task forces, operationalization resources, and infrastructure support. This collaboration signifies a significant step toward fostering growth and development in the construction and metro rail sectors. #cmrl #chennaimetro #metro #urbantransport #infrastructure\n\n𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿 𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗻𝗻𝗮𝗶 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗼: 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀 As a daily commuter on Chennai Metro Rail Limited's (CMRL) Blue Line from Nanganallur to Nandanam, I've observed some fascinating patterns in how passengers choose to stand, especially near the train doors. In my latest carousel post, I dive into these behaviors, discussing why passengers might prefer certain spots and what this means for our daily commute. Swipe through the slides to see my observations and insights, and I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences as well! #MetroRail #ChennaiMetro #PassengerBehavior #UrbanCommute #PublicTransport #CommuterLife *Disclaimer: These are personal observations and not based on collected data.\n\nEngineering Marvel. People have misconceptions which I came to know during discussions that Bullet train is waste of money. Instead of getting bullet train, why don't we update Indian trains with better service with similar budget. I partially agreed on this.... why settle for good when you are getting better. Apart from this..... it will also help us in advancement of future infrastructure, upskill of Indian contractors, consultants, labours and an opportunity to come out from the colonial mindset. #nhsrcl #bullettrain #engineeringmarvel #risingindia #indianinfrastructure #highspeedrailproject #bettertomorrow #technologysharing #makeinindia\n\nNavi Mumbai to soon get its first Metro line after a 12-year wait While journey up to two km will cost Rs 10, for above 10 km, the fare will be Rs 40 for one side journey. The metro fare is fixed in 2021 by CIDCO and will be operated by MahaMetro. Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 spanning approximately 11.1 km, connecting Belapur to Pendhar will be commissioned for public use soon. As per the City and Industrial Development Corporation CIDCO, the inauguration of the Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 is expected to be conducted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 15. However, the exact date of the inauguration is yet to be confirmed from the PM’s office. 12 years into making The impending commissioning of the Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 will likely provide a significant boost to public transportation and connectivity in the region. The 11.1-kilometer of complete Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 enroute from Belapur to Pendhar has obtained the clearance certificate from the Commission of Railway Safety (CMRS), making it ready for operations. This metro line comprises 11 stations: Belapur, Sector-7 Bela-pur, Science Park, Utsav Chowk, Sector 11 Kharghar, Sector 14 Kharghar, Central Park, Petha-pada, Sector 34 Kharghar, Panch-nand, and Pendhar Terminal. It has a maintenance depot at Taloja and two traction substations at Panchanand and Kharghar. This project faced several hurdles including issues related to contractors, lack of experts, legal and technical obstacles including funding challenges leading to its delay. Along with inauguration of Navi Mumbai Metro Prime Minister Modi is also expected to lay the foundation stone for the Orange Gate tunnel project of MMRDA, which has received approval from the state government for appointment of contractor. Additionally, the Central Railway Mumbai division Digha station is ready to be opened to the public and inaugurated by PM Modi. #mumbai #navimumbai #india #pm #narendramodi #metro #cidco #MMRDA #copidfromtheindianexpress"
