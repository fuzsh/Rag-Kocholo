It's not going to be shelved in the same place as Tolkien. Kafka, Borges, and Garcia Marquez, yes, for this is the type of fiction that is often called \"experimental\" -- although, were it not for the connotations of fairies and sorcerers, fantasy is what it is. If we must affix labels, perhaps \"modern fable\" is the most apt.\n\nReview by David Soyka.\n\nKeith Parkinson\n\nSoul of the Fire\n\nTerry Goodkind\n\nMillennium (mass market reprint, 643 pages, £6.99 UK)\n\nPublication date: April 2000\n\nThis is the 5th book in the Sword of Truth series, sequel to Temple of the Winds. \"Richard Rahl, Keeper of the Sword of Truth, faced an evil even he could not stand against -- the dread plague heralded by a Red Moon and loosed by the mad Emperor Jagang.

Each poem is based on fantastic themes or 'spaces,' and all the contributors have provided brief comments, compiled at the end of the book, concerning the relationship they perceive between the fantastic and their own work. Kerman suggests in her introduction that some of these poems may \"demonstrate that the 'ordinary' is always the fantastic when seen from a certain angle.\" That should be obvious to anyone who remembers, for example, the mystical wonder (and sometimes the stark terror) of being a child. But too often we forget, and it becomes the poet's job to remind us. The Songster: The Whiteblade Saga, Book Two\n\nAdam Nichols\n\nMillennium (mass market, 488 pages, £6.99 UK/$9.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: April 2000\n\nSequel to Book One of The Whiteblade Saga, The Paladin. \"Forced out of the only home he has known with nothing but the clothes on his back, Ziftkin is alone in the wild mountains when he is assailed by a strange apparition. When he wakes, confused, on the point of starvation, he is clutching a bone flute that makes the most beautiful music. A gift from the Fey, the flute opens up a world of new horizons, a world of talking animals, a world in which for the first time Ziftkin is listened to, a world in which he has to face up to the potential of his gift for harm as well as good.\"\n\nLorie Reeves\n\nTouch of Frost and The Last Intergalactic Sighting of Melgor Lich\n\nJoel and Greg Reeves\n\nAwe-Struck (e-book available as HTML, Rocket Reader or PRC Doc, 50,000 and 26,600 words, $4.30 US)\n\nPublication date: December 1999\n\nTouch of Frost: \"It has been a hot, dry summer in Doverdale and people are dropping dead of exposure to extreme cold.

That's what two agents of Irthian World Peace Correspondence Schools, Pym the white dwarf and Ebulliant, a red giant, wonder as they chase Melgor Lich across Nogh, a strange world full of stranger creatures. Even after regaining custody of Lich, the wily human puts his keepers into one mad scrape after another, then tries a final exit into the unknown.\" Gnarl!\n\nRudy Rucker\n\nFour Walls Eight Windows (566 pages, hardcover - $35 US; trade - $20 US)\n\nPublication date: April 2000\n\nGnarl! is the first major story collection from Rucker in 17 years and represents his SF stories from the last quarter of the 20th century. It's also the companion volume to his selected non-fiction, Seek!. Throughout the stories in Gnarl!, \"there is the unique Rucker mix: cutting-edge physics, a wild but perversely logical imagination, and a decidedly punk attitude.\" Several of the stores were previously uncollected and one was previously unpublished. A few are co-written by such authors as Bruce Sterling, Paul Di Filippo and Marc Laidlaw.\n\nReview of Seek! by Greg L. Johnson. Warrior-Woman: The Forging of the Legend\n\nMary Ann Steele\n\nScienceFictionSeries.com (e-book available in PDF format, 285 pages, $9.95 US)\n\nSynopsis: \"Signe, a warrior of legendary prowess, drives a force of Columbian invaders off Gaea. The warrior-woman parlays a single space ship captured during a raid, into a fleet. Signe fights Arlen, Commander-in-Chief of Columbia's military forces, to a draw, but a climactic development creates bitter misunderstanding in the minds of two gallant archfoes.\" Steele put 15 years into the development of her story cycle (11 volumes, of which only the first 2 are currently available online -- others coming in the near future) and the pair of mutually hostile, wholly imaginary cultures in which the tales take place. She says: \"The novels are not typical of the hard science fiction that sells conventionally. Much of that targets readers who prefer an emphasis on explosive action and far-out technology to a focus on the interactions among complex characters facing futuristic challenges.\"\n\nRead an excerpt. Cryptonomicon\n\nNeal Stephenson\n\nPerennial, HarperCollins (trade paperback reprint, 918 pages, $16 US/$24.50 Can)\n\nPublication date: 1 June 2000\n\nThis books has been nominated for the Hugo Award. It's the first volume in a proposed series and it caused quite a stir, garnering a lot of attention from the mainstream. Here at the SF Site, it was voted the #1 Best Book of 1999 by our contributors and the #2 Readers' Choice for 1999 by our readers. SF Site founder John O'Neill says: \"Without a doubt, Cryptonomicon is our answer to the question 'If I could read a single SF title in 1999, what should it be?' Thought-provoking, original, and at times wondrous, Cryptonomicon somehow combined the impenetrable art of cryptography with a page-turning story, a feat we would have thought impossible. It educated and thrilled us like no other novel this year, and it is likely destined to sweep most of the major awards. Make sure it finds its way onto your shelves. You won't be sorry.\"\n\nReview by Kim Fawcett.\n\nFred Gambino\n\nMore Than Human\n\nTheodore Sturgeon\n\nMillennium (trade paperback, 234 pages, £6.99 UK)\n\nPublication date: April 2000\n\nSF Masterworks #28 brings us a classic from 1953 by one of SF's Masters. \"All alone: an idiot boy, a runaway girl, a severely retarded baby, and twin girls with a vocabulary of two words between them. Yet once they are mysteriously drawn together this collection of misfits becomes something very, very different from the rest of humanity. This intensely written and moving novel is an extraordinary vision of humanity's next step.\" Other Sturgeon classics include The Dreaming Jewels (1950) and Venus Plus X (1960).\n\nChris Moore\n\nA Deepness in the Sky\n\nVernor Vinge\n\nMillennium (mass market reprint, 757 pages, £6.99 UK)\n\nPublication date: March 2000\n\nSequel to the 1993 Hugo-winning A Fire Upon the Deep, this novel is both a Hugo- and a Nebula-nominee for this year. It was also voted #2 on the SF Site contributors' list of Best Books of 1999 and #3 on our Readers' Choice Best Books of 1999. Several thousand years from now, expeditions from two human cultures meet near an astronomical oddity known as the OnOff star. The Qeng Ho are interested in trade, the Emergement in more direct forms of exploitation. Neither group is there just for a chance to study a unique star system.\n\nReview by Greg L. Johnson."
