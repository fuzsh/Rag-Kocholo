Ms. Chung has a degree in Russian and Eastern European Studies and translates Russian literature into Korean.

So that got me wondering what people think about starting a series with so many books? (And I don't think you can pick and choose in this one; like many urban fantasy series, they build on the previous.) I love this author and am caught up on her other longer series (InCryptid and Wayward Children), but I was saving this one because I knew I'd love it. Sorry if this sounds like a campaign for them to choose my book (I will read it someday regardless) but I was curious how people felt about it.

I definitely recommend checking them out. Many have stuff other than books like cards (birthday, thank you, etc.), puzzles, and book-adjacent things. My favorite store also has stickers and chocolate creations from a local candy maker. If you don't want to buy a physical book, maybe those other things would appeal. My local stores also work with Kobo for ebooks and Libro.fm for audiobooks. When I buy books on those, my local store gets credit.\n\nBoox Palma\n\nSource\n\nRuth: What I always do when I go to an independent bookshop is buy a bookmark (I did this today in fact). I don‚Äôt read as many physical books these days as I would like, but I‚Äôm always happy to acquire a pretty new bookmark. I have quite a collection of them so I can choose one that fits the aesthetic of my latest read.\n\nGeoff: My local independent bookstore has a cafe attached, so I try to frequent that. I also try to buy one physical book per month, even though I prefer reading on Kindle. I find I end up buying a lot of novellas so I can minimize the actual amount of small font reading I have to do. :-)\n\nI'm fortunate enough to have enough money that this won't break the bank, and I like having the bookstore in town!\n\nTamahome: Bookstores should have a system where you buy a drink, and then you can read ebooks on an app in the store wifi. They can track what gets read and those authors get some money.\n\nJohn (Taloni): Regarding Scalzi's latest, a good example of the fixup novel/sequential story is our recent read China Mountain Zhang.

I mostly listen to podcasts while making short drives around town and at the gym. Longer walks and drives (and flights) are usually for audiobooks. This last 2 weeks I've made execptions to that but generally that's my bookishness. I also read with my eyes often while eating lunch and before bed. Finally back into Cordelia's Honor and still enjoying it, even if there are difficult scenes and if I didn't vote for it. ;)\n\n\"Misti - I'm all in for Emily Wilde for next month's pick. I don't mind if the runner-up book (or even a book further down in the voting order) gets picked, especially if it's something I think I'd like to read anyway. One of my favorite things about March Madness is getting introduced to books I haven't heard about and adding them to my TBR list.\n\nWhat would be on a Sword and Laser Bingo card?\n\nBOOK OF THE MONTH DISCUSSION\n\nBrief Kick Off\n\nEmily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett\n\nAmazon Link\n\nWRAP UP (Spoilery)\n\nCordelia's Honor by Lois McMaster Bujold\n\nShards of Honor\n\nAmazon link\n\nBarrayar\n\nParental Anxieties\n\nBethMitcham\n\nIt‚Äôs a great way to examine attitudes towards childbearing/parenting, what are the hidden costs and who we expect to bear them. Although this aspect of things gets more attention in Ethan of Athos.\n\nBarrayar is more about how parenting changes us, the vulnerability of having children.\"\n\nSean\n\nLiterally just finished.\n\nI'll admit that I like Barrayar more than Shards. I feel like it has a more coherent plot-line, and Cordelia is less on the periphery of events, which is the general vibe I got in Shards.\n\nI also really liked the epilogue, even if I could see where it was going almost immediately. Part of me honestly thinks I should go on with the series.\"\n\nJohn Nevets\n\nJust Finished listening to the two books back to back. Most of that was done in driving back and forth from where I went for the eclipse. I liked them both. I have read 3 ( I think) of Miles'es books, and liked those as well. Cordelia was only briefly in those. But it was interesting seeing how much of her is also in Miles character and personality. Always looking for a creative solution to things, and yet curious as a cat. And willing to lead from the front if necessary.\n\nI also found that these books reminded me more of the contemporary space opera, political/ military sci-fi books that are out there Like C. J. Cherryh's Foreigner series, or David Weber's Honor Harrington series, and so where I'm guessing even some of Jack Campbell took some inspiration for his Lost Fleet series. I guess all of these have probably drawn at least some inspiration from the old Patrick O'Brian British Navy books, and the Horatio Hornblower books.\"\n\nBeen\n\nI just finished this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it and how it continues from the first book to portray disability as something to accept and adapt to rather than pity or just hide away. I especially liked that they didn't just ignore it either, and had some strong opposing views which were pushed back on rather token thoughts which were quickly dismissed.\n\nI don't know what experience the author has with disability, but I continue to be surprised at how well this series handles things consider it was started in the 80s.\n\nI've seen that most of the series (aside from the very next book) are also free on audible, so I'll be continuing to read the series for a little while at least. Keen to see where Miles story goes after this.\"\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nOur show is currently entirely funded by our patrons.

It's about band formation and growth among a group of aliens with a few humans. The group gravitates around one member as its \"Sun,\" without which they can't function. He's otherwise a Low Cantor, essentially the rhythm guitarist of such a band.\n\nTassie Dave: Nicholas Eames has already answered the question of which part of a band they represent.\n\nThe main five who make up Saga are loosely based on the players in a 'classic' rock band. Gabe is the charismatic lead singer, Ganelon the highly-skilled 'axe-man' (lead guitar), Matrick as the drummer (he wields a pair of knives, after all) and Moog as the zany keyboard player.

Not surprising after living through the Dresden fire bombing and other events he live through\n\nOaken: I don't think he was critical of science fiction, quite the opposite. At the end of his life he was bitter and angry that the \"\"literary fiction\"\" types didn't take him seriously precisely because he wrote science fiction.\n\nHe [biographer Charles Shields] describes Vonnegut asking him to look up his name in a dictionary (it was not there) and then look up Jack Kerouac (it was there). \"\"How about that?\"\" Vonnegut then states with a frown.\n\nIt is back to the literary fiction/genre discussion though. Clearly he thought of himself as a writer of literary fiction, and thought nothing wrong with writing literary SF.

We kick off Kings of the Wyld and wrap up Mimicking of Known Successes.\n\nDownload directly here!\n\nWHAT ARE WE NOMMING?\n\nTom: Eggplant Caponata with sausage\n\nVeronica: Energy balls!\n\nQUICK BURNS\n\nNot Licorice and Seth: Shadow and Bone author Leigh Bardugo shared that she was ‚Äúheartbroken and deeply disappointed‚Äù about the cancellation. She penned a note on Instagram that confirmed there would be no season 3, nor a Six of Crows spin-off, ending the ‚ÄúGrishaverse‚Äù on Netflix.\n\nRoberator: John Scalzi announced 2 new books out in 2025 on his blog, including Old Man's War #7:\n\nTRP: Jill Bearup, actor-combatant and YouTuber, developed a series of \"Fantasy Heroine\" YouTube Shorts , where an Author and her novel's Protagonist disagree about the way the story is going.\n\nJill Bearup has written a novel based on this series, called Just Stab Me Now.\n\nIt will be published in February 2024 and is available for pre-order on various sites.\n\nAs of today Just Stab Me Now is number 5 on the Barnes and Noble top 100 books chart\n\nJan: Neil Gaiman was recently guest on the scriptnotes podcast.\n\nJan: According to Deadline Amazon MGM has ordered a pilot with Joseph Fiennes based on the ‚ÄòCharlie Bone‚Äô YA Fantasy Novels by Jenny Nimmo\n\nJan: The Imaginary Worlds podcast had a nice episode recently about Hindu Fantasy\n\nKev: Humble Bundle has 21 Scalzi novels for $18 or pay what you want. (Ends around December 14)\n\nJan: From NPR: Irish writer Paul Lynch won the Booker Prize for fiction for his dystopian novel \"Prophet Song\" about a woman's struggle to protect her family in an Ireland collapsing into totalitarianism and war.\n\nmantissa: NPR has the books we love list. One can filter on speculative fiction\n\nBARE YOUR SWORD\n\nSeth: Liked the episode. And I even liked the book pick (even if the book wasn't my favorite) since I wouldn't have picked it for myself, and that's half of the point of being in a book club.Jan: Regarding the flowery language: I always found it interesting that it is recommended in English to always (or at least most of the time) use \"said\" in order not to draw attention to the word, while in German it seems the opposite. At least, in school, kids were always downgraded for \"repetitious language\" if they used \"said\" twice in a row, so we were always encouraged to find synonyms...\n\nI don't know if that's an English vs German thing though, or a professional writing vs school teachings thing. How is it in different languages?\n\nTassie Dave: I don't mind the author using \"said\" repeatedly in text, but I do find it annoying in audio, he effused.\n\nThe brain does seem to skip over it when reading, but it just seems to stand out when listening, he uttered.\n\nI'd rather the narrator distinguish between the voices, and also have a different tone for inner thought and vocal dialogue than repeated say \"said\", he expressedSteve: I haven't listened to the podcast yet, so I'm missing some context, however when I was at school in the UK a *cough* few decades ago, we were very much told to avoid repeated use of \"said\"Oaken: Oaken looked up. ‚ÄúIt is easy to convey who is talking without even using the a verb like said.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI disagree,‚Äù said the man in the jaunty hat.\n\nOaken looked at him askance, ‚ÄúWell then you are wrong.‚Äù\n\nSeth: There was some interesting talk about this last time they interviewed Bobiverse author Dennis E. Taylor (at least I think I remember there was). He was saying he even tried to write a different version for the audiobook author that left out repetitious \"saids\" to make it less jarring. I think he concluded it was too cumbersome to pull off, but it's interesting.\n\nCertainly, when listening, I'd rather just have the narrator do a different voice and tone to denote each character than for them to read all the \"saids.\" Like Tassie Dave, when I'm reading I don't really care. I'm much more likely to be thrown out of a narrative by \"she expostulated\" than even 50 \"she saids\" in a row.\n\nIain: For the record real bread does not have sugar in it (which then kicked off a debate about whether that's true)\n\nBOOK OF THE MONTH DISCUSSION\n\nKick Off\n\nKings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames.\n\n- Amazon Link\n\nBook briefing\n\nSpotify playlist\n\nWrap Up\n\nMimicking of Known Successes by Malka Older.\n\n- Amazon Link\n\nGristle McNerd\n\nI was reminded of the ruthless lady's guide to wizardry, in that it was a detective story in a genre setting, that was clearly mostly there as a backdrop for the romance. I liked it okay, it was a fun little diversion, but not exactly a masterpiece\n\n3 Random (Calvey)\n\nI liked the book but it‚Äôs not a great book. It was short, but I like the idea of the Holmes story and the coziness. Jupiter was kind of a fun place to tell a story, but I had a hard time with the platforms and understanding them or visualizing them. I think also being a Novella there wasn‚Äôt enough development, I‚Äôm curious to see what the next book will do.\n\nI think it was nice palate cleansing morsel after The Library at Mount Char.\n\nIain Bertram\n\nI loved this book. üìï\n\nThe world building was to support the story. In some SF the story comes second which is not the case here.\n\nThe settings makes everyone a climate refugee. Conflict between those who want to go home and those who want to build a new life. These underlying themes are obviously important to the author.\n\nJohn Taloni\n\nI'm amused that one of the selling points of this book is \"what if Holmes and Watson were gay?\" And I'm like, \"how many times did Holmes tell Watson, \"bring your service revolver.\" A CODE PHRASE IF EVER I SAW ONE! üôÇ\n\nTassie Dave\n\nI ended up really liking this book. ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê Had to laugh when Pleiti objected to being called the C-word üòÅ As a socialist, I'd be appalled too üòâ I did find the narrator's pronunciation of certain words a bit grating though. August, which is used many times, (for a description of a person) is not pronounced the same as the 8th month ü§® There were certain other words, that I can't remember, that also sounded off. I would read the sequels.\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nOur show is currently entirely funded by our patrons.

And our non-spoilery thoughts on Library at Mount Char.\n\nDownload directly here!\n\nWHAT ARE WE NOMMING?\n\nTom: Orange Chicken, brown rice, spicy fish cake, gai lan\n\nVeronica: Pumpkin spice syrup\n\nQUICK BURNS\n\nChris K: Apparently it is not too early for best of the year lists to start appearing. Here are the Barnes & Noble Best Books of the Year 2023 lists for fantasy and science fiction. (via Locus)\n\nBrian: Casey Handmer dropped the latest installation in his \"\"Mars Trilogy Technical Commentary\"\" (on the Kim Stanley Robinson series).\n\nJan: From Locus Mag: The 2023 Utopia Award Winner for best Utopian Novel is \"The World We Make\" by N. K. Jemisin\n\nLiqorice Margaret Atwood comments on the current state of AI and its threat to writers.\n\nBARE YOUR SWORD\n\nterpkristin: I'm glad your K-wires are out! Did you save them? Sorry it was uncomfortable/painful. I've found most things are as I get older, certainly nothing like it was when I was in my 20's.\n\nI haven't really made much progress in China Mountain Zhang. I find it easy to put down. But I enjoyed y'alls thoughts on it. It made me want to read it more. Too bad it's not backlit.\n\nThanks for keeping going with the show. One of the things I look forward to every other week (sometimes more!). I really enjoyed the interview with Felicia Day, too (though I was traveling when it came out and didn't easily get to post about it).\"\n\nWilliam\n\nLooking forward to listening. I don't yet know the source of the episode title, but I actually used that phrase to describe myself years ago after being asked to categorize an entire library of books. I was seeing codes when I closed my eyes.\n\nBOOK OF THE MONTH DISCUSSION\n\nThe Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins\n\n- Amazon Link\n\nTLAMC: Book Vibes\n\n\"Decado: There‚Äôs a real lack of description in this book I‚Äôm finding. I have no idea what anyone looks like, what their surroundings look like, etc. I don‚Äôt feel any sort of grounding in this world. This is the same problem I had with Gideon the Ninth that made me lem it.\n\nI tend to lean in the direction of liking things to be over-descriptive. I‚Äôm also reading Ninth House right now and I love the lush descriptions in that book.\"\n\n\"tilltab\n\nHow strange - I seem to be finding the book very visual and easy to picture - likewise for Gideon. I guess it‚Äôs just that the way things are described here matches the way I ‚Äòsee‚Äô things.\"\n\neytanz: It mostly reminded me of Gideon the nineth in that the mismatch between the writing tone and events was the hardest thing to get used to\n\n\"tilltab\n\nI‚Äôm loving it so far, so maybe I should check out House of Leaves! I love it when stories unfold like this, with you slowly learning about what is happening and why. I was gripped from the very start, and love the way I care about Carolyn, even though it‚Äôs clear from the get go she‚Äôd done, and will do, some incredibly shady things.\"\n\n\"Gristle McNerd\n\nWith all the grimdark and the vaguely 20th century American setting, I'm getting Stephen King vibes, which is not my favorite thing. So I'm a bit lukewarm on this so far, though it is also kind of intriguing\"\n\n\"DasGerm\n\nIt's giving me American Gods vibes, which is a good thing. It also reminds me a little bit of The Breakfast Club, but that may just be the main character's \"\"wardrobe\"\" and some of the personalities represented.\"\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nOur show is currently entirely funded by our patrons.
