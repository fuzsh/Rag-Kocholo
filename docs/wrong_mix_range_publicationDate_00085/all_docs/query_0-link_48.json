        "text": "Starship Troopers\n\nBy Robert A. Heinlein,\n\nFrom my list on military sci-fi books that actually understand what it feels like to be in the military.\n\nBy Bennett R. Coles Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI was 4 years old when I first saw Star Wars, and it changed my entire world view. Basically, from that moment forward everything was cooler if it was in SPACE! Eventually, I grew up, and today, I’ve served more than 20 years in uniform, but I discovered along the way that most sci-fi doesn’t portray the military accurately. When I started writing, one of my goals was to present as realistic a depiction of the military as I can (in space!) and I’ve always enjoyed books like the ones on my list that do the same.\n\nBennett's book list on military sci-fi books that actually understand what it feels like to be in the military\n\nWhy did Bennett love this book?\n\nI have never read a book that more perfectly captures the day-to-day reality of military life. Having served in the Navy for over twenty years, I found Heinlein’s descriptions of shipboard life, basic training, and the camaraderie of brothers in arms to be pitch-perfect and laced with the subtle humor of cynicism that every sailor feels.\n\nBut beyond that, I was fascinated by Heinlein’s exploration of the ethics of war, and how the society in Starship Troopers was able to justify its actions against the enemy. Despite all they go through, none of the characters ever question why they’re fighting and I think this is one of the core issues Heinlein is exploring: how is it possible to convince an educated public to support terrible actions?\n\nBy Robert A. Heinlein,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked Starship Troopers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'The historians can't seem to settle whether to call this one 'The Third Space War' (or the fourth), or whether 'The First Interstellar War' fits it better. We just call it 'The Bug War'. Everything up to then and still later were 'incidents', 'patrols' or 'police actions'. However, you are just as dead if you buy the farm in an 'incident' as you are if you buy it in a declared war.'\n\n5,000 years in the future, humanity faces total extermination. Our one defence: highly-trained soldiers who scour the metal-strewn blackness of space to hunt down a terrifying enemy: an…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Complete Hammer's Slammers\n\nBy David Drake,\n\nFrom my list on military science fiction and fantasy by veterans.\n\nBy Nathan W. Toronto Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI care about military SFF because it has the potential to contribute to a just and prosperous society by building bridges of understanding between military professionals and civilians. I've never served in the military, but I taught operations and strategy to US Army officers for six years, after which I went to Abu Dhabi as one of the founding faculty members of the UAE National Defense College. I wrote a book, How Militaries Learn, which is one of the few academic books on civil-military relations to use large-n statistical analysis. I’ve lived in ten countries and I speak four languages, including Arabic.\n\nNathan's book list on military science fiction and fantasy by veterans\n\nWhy did Nathan love this book?\n\nDrake served in an armor unit in Southeast Asia in the 1970s, so it’s no coincidence that Hammer’s Slammers, a collection of short stories, revolves around a tank unit. So many military SFF stories focus on knuckle-dragging ground-pounders, so it’s refreshing to see war from a tank turret. Drake has been accused of writing gun porn, but I find a lot of nuance in his writing, especially on combat motivation and small-unit leadership. He was one of the first military SFF authors to write an openly gay character, and women fight right alongside men without the misogynistic or objectifying undertones that sometimes afflict the subgenre. To get a sense for Drake’s writing, “But Loyal to His Own” and “Caught in the Crossfire” are two of my favorite stories.\n\nBy David Drake,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Complete Hammer's Slammers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe bestselling series that rocketed David Drake to Military Science Fiction stardom is collected in this first of three volumes.\n\nPreview\n\nDauntless\n\nBy Jack Campbell,\n\nFrom my list on science fiction that will take you on a journey.\n\nBy Karen McCreedy Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAlthough I’ve written non-fiction articles on films and British history for magazines, my fiction reflects my love of science fiction, which goes right back to when I watched Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet, and Star Trek on television as a child. You can read – or watch – the stories as straightforward adventures in imagination, or take away clever commentaries on contemporary problems. The possibilities are endless, and I always enjoyed conjuring stories and scribbling them down – though it took a long time for those scribbles to translate into publishing success! My first novel, Unreachable Skies was published in 2018 by Mirror World, with Exile in 2019 and Ascent in 2020 completing the trilogy.\n\nKaren's book list on science fiction that will take you on a journey\n\nWhy did Karen love this book?\n\nDauntless is the first in the six-book Lost Fleet series, and sets off on an epic SF journey like no other. Jack Campbell’s approach to space battles feels realistic; while the tensions and terrors of the characters are sharply realised. The opening chapters take an entire fleet of ships deep into enemy territory – and maroon them there, under the sudden and unexpected command of Captain “Black Jack” Geary. A space legend, due to his presumed death, his rescue from hibernation means he is by far the most senior officer on any of the ships – a cause for resentment and conflict on his own ship and around the fleet. And as if that’s not enough for him to deal with, his ships face annihilation from the duplicitous Syndics who lured them into a deadly trap. How will they find their way home?\n\nBy Jack Campbell,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Dauntless as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first novel in the New York Times bestselling Lost Fleet series!\n\nThe Alliance has been fighting the Syndics for a century—and losing badly. Now its fleet is crippled and stranded in enemy territory. Their only hope is a man who's emerged from a century-long hibernation to find he has been heroically idealized beyond belief....\n\nCaptain John “Black Jack” Geary’s exploits are known to every schoolchild. Revered for his heroic “last stand” in the early days of the war, he was presumed dead. But a century later, Geary miraculously returns and reluctantly takes command of the Alliance Fleet as it…\n\nPreview\n\nBill, the Galactic Hero\n\nBy Harry Harrison,\n\nFrom my list on military science fiction books that inspired me.\n\nBy William C. Dietz Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am the author of more than sixty published novels, most of which are military science fiction, or near-future alternative history fiction, so I have an abiding interest in the subgenre, and the authors who helped to shape it.\n\nWilliam's book list on military science fiction books that inspired me\n\nWhy did William love this book?\n\nBill, the Galactic Hero is a satirical novel by Harry Harrison published while I was still in my teens. It’s funny, it’s satirical, and still delivers a good plot. Harrison also wrote the fabulous Stainless Steel Rat books. Taken together Harry’s novels taught me about the use of humor in military books—and literature generally.\n\nBy Harry Harrison,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Bill, the Galactic Hero as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt was the highest honour to defend the Empire against the dreaded Chingers, an enemy race of seven-foot-tall lizards. But Bill, a Technical Fertilizer Operator from a planet of farmers, wasn't interested in honour - he was only interested in two things: his chosen career, and the shapely curves of Inga-Maria Calyphigia.\n\nThen a recruiting robot shanghaied him with knockout drops, and he came to in deep space, aboard the Empire warship Christine Keeler. And from there, things got even worse...\n\nPreview\n\nJem\n\nBy Frederik Pohl,\n\nFrom my list on cynical takes on space colonisation.\n\nBy Gary Gibson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up, I was exposed to the same influences as most other SF writers of my generation – Clarke, Heinlein, and Asimov. But I was also exposed to the more nuanced, more psychologically realistic work of writers like Harlan Ellison, Norman Spinrad, Ursula K. LeGuin, and J.G. Ballard, none of whom shared the unquestioning techno-utopianism of an earlier generation of writers. They taught me not to automatically respect power or authority, and to always question ideas that might otherwise be taken for granted. It’s an approach that’s carried over into my own writing ever since.\n\nGary's book list on cynical takes on space colonisation\n\nWhy did Gary love this book?\n\nI first read Pohl’s Jem when I was a kid, and his fatalistic, even cynical take on first contact and interstellar colonization, along with the works of Harlan Ellison, Philip K. Dick, and Ursula LeGuin, greatly informed my developing views on politics and society. A near-future Earth divided into three major power blocs discovers a world ripe for exploitation and populated by not one, but three, sentient species, It’s not long before each bloc is currying the favor of different species in order to set each against the other, with absolutely no one thinking beyond their own immediate needs or with any concern about the consequences of their actions.\n\nBy Frederik Pohl,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Jem as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA cynical and compelling tale of politics, exploitation and colonisation on another planet\n\nThe discovery of another habitable world might spell salvation to the three bitterly competing power blocs of the resource-starved 21st century; but when their representatives arrive on Jem, with its multiple intelligent species, they discover instead the perfect situation into which to export their rivalries.\n\nSubtitled, with savage irony, 'The Making of a Utopia', JEM is one of Frederik Pohl's most powerful novels.\n\nPreview\n\nDownbelow Station\n\nBy C. J. Cherryh,\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi featuring awesome female leads.\n\nBy Felicia Watson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nIn school, science and reading were always my favorite subjects so is it any wonder that I grew up to be a scientist who writes? Before I entered my teens, I entered the realm of science fiction through the stories of Asimov, Bradbury, and Le Guin, and I never willingly left that realm. Back then, the one thing I hungered for but so rarely found was a compelling female character. Avid readers all want to find that character to identify with, don’t we? Fortunately, our sci-fi world is now populated with many great female MCs so I’m sharing five of my favorites here with you. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.\n\nFelicia's book list on sci-fi featuring awesome female leads\n\nWhy did Felicia love this book?\n\nC.J. Cherryh‘s Hugo-winningDownbelow Station is on a lot of people’s TBR pile but I suspect due to its intimidating size, it never gets any further. Which is a damn shame. Once you get into it, the story is completely absorbing. Cherryh’s world-building is outstanding, presenting a convincing 24th Century society, with just enough enriching detail to draw you in. The politics and tactics of the warring factions are familiar yet not derivative. If you loved Alien’s Ripley as much as I did, then I suspect you will love the character of Captain Signy Mallory. She is presented as a badass in the best possible way: tough, smart, resolute, and unfailingly loyal to her crew. Though this is classic space opera, filled with war, intrigue, and politics, the emphasis is on the people not the pew-pew space battles. If that’s a plus for you like it is for me,…\n\nBy C. J. Cherryh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Downbelow Station as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Hugo Award-winning classic sci-fi novel about interstellar war.\n\nThe Beyond started with the Stations orbiting the stars nearest Earth. The Great Circle the interstellar freighters traveled was long, but not unmanageable, and the early Stations were emotionally and politically dependent on Mother Earth. The Earth Company which ran this immense operation reaped incalculable profits and influenced the affairs of nations.\n\nThen came Pell, the first station centered around a newly discovered living planet. The discovery of Pell's World forever altered the power balance of the Beyond. Earth was no longer the anchor which kept this vast empire from coming…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Descent of Anansi\n\nBy Larry Niven, Steven Barnes,\n\nFrom my list on lost classics of space science fiction.\n\nBy Allen Steele Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nOkay, so you’ve read Dune, you’ve read Starship Troopers, you’ve read 2001: A Space Odyssey, and maybe you’ve even read From Earth to the Moon and The First Men in the Moon. Seen the movies, too (or maybe you cheat and say you’ve read the books when you’ve only seen the flicks). Bet you think that makes you an expert on science fiction about space, right? Not even close! If you want to read more than just the well-known classics everyone else has, find these books. Some have become obscure and are now out of print, but they’re not hard to find; try ABE, eBay, and local second-hand bookstores. They’re worth searching for, and then you’ll really have something to talk about.\n\nAllen's book list on lost classics of space science fiction\n\nWhy did Allen love this book?\n\nA near-future space thriller, about a revolution by an orbital space colony against the governments of Earth that seek to keep it under their control, is a fast-moving blend of action, politics, and speculation. Read this and see the sort of vision of humanity’s future in space that captivated people’s imaginations at the dawn of the Space Shuttle era.\n\nBy Larry Niven, Steven Barnes,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Descent of Anansi as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTells the story of a spaceship attacked by pirates.\n\nPreview\n\nTerms of Enlistment\n\nBy Marko Kloos,\n\nFrom my list on old-school sci-fi from 21st century authors.\n\nBy Matthew O. Duncan Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up a fan of all things sci-fi, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and so on. But the older I got, the pickier I got, wanting more depth in character, creative stories and fun, but believable action. I read classic sci-fi like iRobot, Starship Troopers, and Enders Game, to name a few. I did find some contemporary authors I liked like Marco Kloos, Detmare Wehr, and Rebecca Branch, but they were needles in a haystack. So, instead of complaining that there were not enough good books out there, I started writing my own. A decade later I have 8 published titles and more on the way.\n\nMatthew's book list on old-school sci-fi from 21st century authors\n\nWhy did Matthew love this book?\n\nI first discovered this book as an audiobook several years ago. It was recommended as something similar to Starship Troopers, which I had recently finished. The beginning of the book didn’t grab me at first. As a matter of fact I started to think it was a rip-off of Starship Troopers. But there was something about the main character that made me want to stay to the next chapter. Andrew Grayson is a young man who is very bright, but because he lives in a welfare community in the not-so-distant future, his prospects are limited. One of the only ways he can get out of the PRCs (what the author refers to as the projects) is to join the military. What makes this book work so well is the fact that Andrew is not really special. He is smart and usually a little more capable than the people around him.…\n\nBy Marko Kloos,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Terms of Enlistment as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"There is nobody who does [military SF] better than Marko Kloos. His Frontlines series is a worthy successor to such classics as Starship Troopers, The Forever War, and We All Died at Breakaway Station.\" -George R. R. Martin\n\nThe year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements: You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world . . . or you can join the service.\n\nWith the colony…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Last Cuentista\n\nBy Donna Barba Higuera,\n\nFrom my list on stories we tell at the end of the world.\n\nBy M. Amelia Eikli Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always been curious about how stories shape how we see the world. As a child, I noticed there were countless conflicting stories explaining how things worked. But which stories were the real ones? Which were true? At university, I studied the stories we tell ourselves about how the world will end. And as we live in times that can feel quite apocalyptic, I’m particularly fascinated by the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and what the future holds. If society dissolved around us, what stories would we tell ourselves to keep going? Are we telling those stories now?\n\nM.'s book list on stories we tell at the end of the world\n\nWhy did M. love this book?\n\nI love pondering how stories shape our understanding of the world around us. This book has so much to say about stories and storytelling and is written so cleverly and heartbreakingly that I couldn’t put it down. I love how the child protagonist tells us her story while there’s another story in the background. I love how it made me feel about my role as an author.\n\nI found this story surprisingly dark to be a children’s book. But it’s dark in a way that reminds me of being scared of the monster under the bed as a child, knowing that, as long as you lie absolutely still, the monster might not exist–or it might already be on its way.\n\nBy Donna Barba Higuera,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Last Cuentista as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn unforgettable journey through the stars, to the very heart of what makes us human.

There are 40 chapters in the book required to be read over 40 days’ time. I like the concept of reading one chapter a day and reflecting on the knowledge before applying it. The message of the book is to keep God at the center of your life in order to fulfill your true purpose.\n\nBy Rick Warren,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Purpose Driven Life as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDiscover and fulfill your God-given purpose by joining the more than thirty-five million others who have embarked on a spiritual journey that started with this #1 New York Times bestselling book by Pastor Rick Warren.\n\nBefore you were born, God knew what your life had in store for you.
