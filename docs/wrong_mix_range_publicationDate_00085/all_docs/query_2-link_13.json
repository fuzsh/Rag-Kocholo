        "text": "“Belief Initiates and guides action—Or it does nothing.”\n\n–Octavia E. Butler, 1947-2006\n\nEarthseed: The Book of the Living (Parable of the Sower)\n\n*****\n\n“History happens one person at a time.”–Patricia Stephens Due, 1939-2012\n\nFreedom in the Family: a Mother-Daughter Memoir of the Fight for Civil Rights\n\n*****\n\nIn the late Octavia E. Butler’s near-future novel Parable of the Sower, a teenage girl, Lauren Olamina, is the only person in her thinly protected community who sees how fragile their way of life is, how susceptible to destruction—and no one will listen until it’s too late.\n\nIn a way, my late mother, civil rights activist Patricia Stephens Due, who braved jail and teargas in the 1960s, was like Lauren Olamina: warning of dire consequences if communities and organizations didn’t work to stop the threats of Jim Crow, segregation and voting restrictions. My mother and father, “Freedom Lawyer” John Due, were willing to die for a better future for their children. My mother forever warned of efforts to “turn back the clock.”\n\nWell, the clock has turned. Now another Really Bad Time has come. It’s the time Butler warned us about, when even the fascistic presidential candidate in her novel Parable of the Talents (the second Parable novel) used the phrase “Make America Great Again.”\n\nDystopia has been a reality for many families for generations, but many in the U.S. finally see our peril more clearly after the Nov. 8 election and today’s inauguration of Donald Tr*mp to the presidency. (I write his name as a profanity based on his hate-filled campaign and platforms, lack of fitness for the position, and other reasons worthy of a separate essay.) But many of us have seen it for as long as we can remember because we have been living beneath the storm clouds, and we tried so hard to tell you.\n\nBlack Lives Matter tried to tell you. The NAACP tried to tell you. Prisoner advocacy groups tried to tell you. Planned Parenthood tried to tell you. The ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center tried to tell you: institutional racism and hate thrive in this country, masquerading as laws and policies meant to restrict human freedom. Scratch beneath the surface of the ideology of the extreme right, and we’re facing the same battles my parents, and their parents, fought.\n\nAnd of course they deny they’re doing it. And tell us “Wait and see.”But those of us who are paying attention have seen enough.\n\nMy way of surviving this storm, at least emotionally, is to combine the lessons from my parents’ freedom movements of the past and the warnings from Octavia E. Butler’s fictitious future to help me stay steady on the path.\n\nWe must resist. To do that, we must believe we can create change.\n\nBreathe\n\nFirst, breathe. Meditate. Journal. Dance. Hydrate. Get enough rest. If you’re an artist, CREATE. As I tweeted earlier this week, ask yourself what Octavia E. Butler would have written to confront this crisis…and create your version of that.\n\nFor information, turn off the circus of television cable news and subscribe to newspapers. Favor investigative reporters over talking heads. For escape, find comedy, horror, thrillers—whatever helps you decompress. I write horror, I think, because my mother loved horror movies as her means of escape from her anger and fear. You need an escape too.\n\nJennifer Marie Brissett, author of the speculative fiction novel Elysium: Or, The World After, says, “I think this is a time to let the sadness in—to just feel this and not fight the despair. Soak your feet, wash your hair, take a nap, and eat the cheese cake. Be okay with feeling lousy. Then put all of your hurt and sorrow into making something beautiful.”\n\nEach day will bring alarming headlines, and self-care is imperative. If you’re not OK, you won’t be able to help others.\n\nMove away from numbness & denial\n\nI felt numb in the weeks after the election. I was trying to protect my emotions, so I avoided processing my pain. Numbness is a form of denial.\n\nI was in mild denial before the election (I didn’t think Tr*mp could win), and many of us still are. The human capacity for denial is so strong that I suspect it may be rooted, ironically, in a survival instinct. Perhaps we lock away our fear of death so effectively that we have a talent for not seeing what’s in front of us.\n\nSo every plan and action must take denial into account. No matter who was “right,” we were all wrong—because we could not prevent the election of Trump.\n\nWe have to fix what went wrong. We have to be awake to fight.\n\nStop looking for heroes and heroines\n\nThis last election should have taught us the vast limitations of our elected officials—they can’t do it alone. Heroic moments have emerged from congresspeople like John Lewis and Maxine Waters, and yet more will emerge in the next few months and years. But we cannot rely upon them.\n\nMeaningful resistance is up to us, the People.\n\nIn Parable of the Sower, Lauren Olamina is a mere teenager, but she cannot rely on the adults for her safety, including her own father (who is in denial)—she relies upon herself. Likewise, my parents and many of the activists from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s were very young, like the young South African youth who helped bring down apartheid. Liberation movements are led by youth, not by the established Powers That Be.\n\nWE are the heroes and heroines who will make the difference. Today not only marked a tragic inauguration—but large protests in Washington, D.C. and sister marches scheduled around the nation tomorrow. A portion of today’s otherwise peaceful protests in Washington grew violent, according to the Washington Post, and protesters were sprayed with pepper spray, with 100 arrests. (Although I want to learn more; Tr*mp’s team has a history of staging resistance.) My mother’s civil rights generation believed—and I agree—that protest is most effective when it’s nonviolent.\n\nBut just because you are nonviolent does not mean police will treat you nonviolently. Even reporters have been manhandled and arrested in Ferguson and Standing Rock, so always attend a protest with one or more friends. The American Civil Liberties Union also has a free app you can download to send video from your phone directly to the ACLU if you see a questionable police encounter.\n\nExercise common sense at a protest the way you should on social media.\n\nBut we must march—and actions beyond marches.\n\nWe are the heroes and heroines of this story.\n\nChoose your spot and defend it\n\nSo much is happening so quickly that it’s difficult to decide where to begin, which leads to hopelessness and paralysis. I’m trying to find the places that need me most. Where will children be most harmed? Who is under the greatest threat of injury or death? How can I take daily actions even if they are small? I’m also working to have an impact on issues like juvenile justice and mass incarceration, as I did pre-election.\n\nSocial media is a start, especially for people new to activism. I have scores of new Twitter followers (I can tell they’re new because they don’t have profile photos yet, still using “Egg” avatars) who were probably drawn to Twitter because Tr*mp uses it. Social media is a great way to spread information (actual news), rally allies, find family and tribe, seek humor or comfort, and sharpen your messaging.\n\nBut it’s only a beginning.\n\nSince the election, I have signed several petitions–including a WhiteHouse.gov petition to force Tr*mp to disclose his tax returns–and set up recurring donations to the NAACP and ACLU, and other donations will follow. Even $10 a month can help. I have left messages for Rep. Paul Ryan about the ACA and emailed others in Congress to fight for the ACA and to urge non-confirmation for Jeff Sessions and Tom Price. I have donated small amounts to book drives for prisoners and supported other causes related to the criminal justice system and mass incarceration. I plan to attend a women’s march in Pasadena Saturday, joining other marchers around the nation.\n\nMost of my actions take less than five minutes a day. We can’t say we don’t have time to take part in active resistance.\n\nAnd action is an antidote to fear. For some people, “daily action” means volunteering in schools, attending local meetings, perhaps even running for office. When I was in my 20s and early 30s, I spent seven years as a volunteer with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, spending a couple of hours every weekend with my Little Sister, whose mother had died.\n\nNot only is daily action helpful in moving forward a political platform or minimizing damage from social spending cuts, but it limits the sense of helplessness that can leave us feeling paralyzed in the face of so much work to do.\n\nAllies squabble — now get over it and build coalitions\n\n“Kindness eases Change.”–Octavia E. Butler, Earthseed: The Book of the Living\n\nYes, it’s frustrating when people who might otherwise be allies fall short of expectations or don’t share our exact perceptions. During the civil rights movement, allies accused my mother of being a “publicity hound” when she used newspaper interviews as a tool for spreading a civil rights message. She navigated in-fighting between the major organizations of the time. She felt marginalized as a woman in the Movement. She had any number of reasons she could have walked away, but she didn’t.\n\nWhy? Because her need to fight for justice and equality outweighed the squabbles. Squabbles in political and movements often are centered on pacing: you’re moving too fast, you’re not moving fast enough. Either “my way” will work or no way will work. People tend to think in binaries rather than seeking common ground. It’s childish and ineffective.\n\nOctavia E. Butler’s Lauren Olamina is forever defending her ideas from skeptics even as they rely upon her leadership. The leaders in Butler’s novels often do not feel safe even among the people they are trying to help. Sadly, this is also true in life, another reality of human nature.\n\nNot everyone you disagree with in the Tr*mp opposition is a phony, con or spy—or “hopeless.” Allies will have to implement plans in concert, so debate and correction are necessary for growth—but growth begins with SELF reflection, not in critiquing others.\n\nPotential allies should approach each other with kindness.\n\n“Unfortunately, this kind of constant familiar critique just makes us smaller when we need to be massive,” says Adrienne Maree Brown, author of the forthcoming Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds (AK Press 2017) and co-editor of Octavia’s Brood (AK Press 2015). Brown has facilitated for several activist groups and organizations.\n\n“We in movement spaces need to notice the role cynicism, desperation and hopelessness plays in our conflict[s],” Brown says. “I see a lot of people fighting with each other because we are scared of the future and trying to protect our hearts.”\n\nInstead of squabbling, teach.\n\nLearn.\n\nScience fiction author and television writer Steven Barnes (who happens to be my husband) says the squabbling on the left is natural because of the nature of progressive politics.\n\n“The left seems chaotic because the right reaches toward the past, and there’s only one past,” Barnes said. “But there are infinite possibilities for the future.” But even if our exact visions differ, building coalitions will be essential in the years ahead.\n\nThe narrative matters\n\nStorytelling is persuasion.\n\nThe role of storytelling is even more important in a political world influenced by “fake news,” or propaganda, from both foreign and domestic sources. Repetition of lies creates a kind of truth in the listener, and potential allies can fall prey to lies just as many voters did. How can we drive the narrative of the story toward truth and social justice? What are the most effective ways to frame events to lend them importance and comprehension?\n\nWe’re weaving the counter-narrative with every Facebook update and tweet, especially when we use personal experiences or revelations. “I used to think, but…and here’s why….” may be an effective way to reach doubters who will not feel judged for their beliefs, whether it’s a position on Black Lives Matter or the viability of a third party. Sometimes simple debunking with evidence is the best approach.\n\nStorytellers don’t attack their listeners: they create a world view that “overthrows a way of thinking,” as Walter Mosley has said of the revolutionary power of black science fiction.\n\nArtists like Barnes, Butler, Mosley and other Afrofuturists create counter-narratives through their art, often using allegory (i.e. Steven Barnes’s alternate history novel on slavery, Lion’s Blood) to better illustrate the challenges we face, or to provide escapism for self-care. The excitement over Marvel’s Luke Cage series and upcoming Black Panther film illustrate the power of fantasy and superheroes to electrify us—feeding our need for self-actualization, self-reliance and shifted power dynamics on screen.\n\nWe need to tell the story.\n\nThe establishment will fear and obstruct you\n\nIf you’ve been following activist communities, you know that groups like Black Lives Matter have already been labeled as “thugs” or “terrorists,” and this isn’t new. But with advances in technology, protesters are now subjected to face recognition software and databases even when no crime has been committed. Beyond that, online harassment from trolls already bullies many people into silence.\n\nOne of Tr*mp’s first tweets as president-elect was to denounce protesters. We can all expect more of this—whether we protest in the streets or with our words, or both.\n\nWatch Ava DuVernay’s documentary 13th on Netflix for a comprehensive overview of how presidential administrations have used “law and order” rhetoric to squash resistance and create a new kind of slavery in our system of mass incarceration. This is not theoretical. My parents both have thick FBI files simply for agitating for civil rights and voting rights at a time when critics labeled agitation as “communism.”\n\nPower fights back.\n\nOne way to extend the reach of your tweets is to use hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter or #resist or #Notmypresident, but hashtags also invite trolls to argue with you. I do not engage trolls—I block them immediately. If you have a wide enough reach, you will be even more highly scrutinized or even threatened or attacked for seemingly innocuous posts. In this new reality, it’s not inconceivable to get a hate tweet from the president himself.\n\nHugo Award-winning author of The Fifth Season N.K. Jemisin is an outspoken presence on Twitter, where she has been targeted and received death threats for her critiques of racism and sexism in fandom. But she still isn’t afraid to raise her voice.\n\n“Mostly it’s just that I don’t want to live in the kind of world where people like that dictate what I say—so I keep talking,” Jemisin says. “I get louder when they fuck with me, because for me, anger pushes back fear.”\n\nShe advises opinionated people on the Internet to visit http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com, a website that specializes in fighting online abuse, whether it’s lists of resources or offering help managing a current crisis. (Like, say, your social media account has been flooded with trolls, etc.)\n\nAdds Jemisin: “But at the end of the day, the only way to shut Them up is to make it really, really clear that they cannot silence you. That takes away their power.”\n\nWe need to be smarter. Sometimes we need to create private chat rooms to talk rather than subjecting our emails or telephone calls to compromise.\n\nWe want our activism to be noticed, but getting noticed has its drawbacks.\n\nDon’t be in denial about that. Be ready.\n\nResistance has always taken courage.\n\nAnd courage is born of hope.\n\nMy father, John Due, is a civil rights attorney who came of age during the tumultuous 1960s. In the 1960s, he represented Dr. King in St. Augustine, Florida, and helped pioneer techniques to move civil rights cases from state to federal courts for a more favorable outcome. He often tells the story of fearing for his life while driving on dark Mississippi roads during voter registration campaigns, and the white sheriff who could have turned him over to the Klan, but instead let him go. He is a lifelong community organizer.\n\nDad has seen nearly a century of change, and, like Octavia Butler often said, he agrees that based on science alone, humankind’s future looks grim. Likewise, the nation’s future looked grim in 1959, when my mother decided to join the Civil Rights Movement in Florida. Or in 1960, when my father moved from Indiana to go to law school at Florida A&M University to be closer to help the Movement as an attorney.\n\n“Based upon the evidence, we are doomed,” Dad says. “A five-year-old can kill the whole human race, almost, if he has access to a button. I cannot categorize change in scientific terminology because based upon science, there is no hope, there is no future. But because we have a human capacity to feel and to believe otherwise, and to believe in hope, that’s what keeps us alive.”\n\nButler’s Parable of the Sower is set within a landscape of poverty, corporate slavery, racism, drought, violence and despair. And yet… within this dystopian framework, Butler gives us hope nestled in her protagonist Lauren Olamina’s new religion, called Earthseed – with passages that resonate deeply beyond the borders of the story.\n\nAll that you touch\n\nYou Change\n\nAll that you Change\n\nChanges you.\n\nThe only lasting truth\n\nIs Change.\n\nGod Is Change.\n\nAnd Butler helps us, through visualization and imagination, cross that membrane from fiction to reality—in a proactive rather than fearful way.\n\nSo begin with history—learn about successful protest movements of the past. Our schools teach shockingly little history, so what you don’t know will surprise you. All of us, no matter how “woke,” have remaining illusions. But we must begin the real-life worldbuilding our times demand.\n\nWe have so much to do, and the work is generations old.\n\nWe all need to learn, grow and create new approaches to replace our failed ones that helped usher Tr*mp win the White House. Like Octavia E. Butler and the resisters before us, we must agitate and create like our future depends on it.\n\nTananarive Due is an author and screenwriter who teaches Afrofuturism at UCLA. She has won an American Book Award, British Fantasy Award and NAACP Image Award. Follow her on Twitter @TananariveDue.\n\nWith the upcoming summer publication of my first short story collection, Ghost Summer, I have been focusing on short fiction for the past couple of years. I always encourage newer writers to hone their craft on short stories before potentially getting lost in the maze of a novel, but with a caveat – writing short stories is not EASY. For some writers, they’re more difficult. The language is often sharper by necessity. But they’re also great for learning structural compression—beginning, middle and end.\n\nI’m pleased with my first two Nayima survivor stories in The Apocalypse Triptych edited by John Joseph Adams and Hugh Howey (“Removal Order” and “Herd Immunity”). I wanted the third story, “Carriers,” to take place about forty years in the future, reimagining my plague concept but keeping Nayima’s core character intact.\n\nAs the deadline drew near, I had breakthroughs and wrote in a white heat, believing I’d expressed my vision.\n\nBut the editors sent it back, asking for revisions.\n\n******\n\nI was ready to defend the story and point out all the reasons it was being misunderstood—but when I read it again after some time away, I realized they were right. The story was flabby and wordy. One scene was so crammed with infodump that it was like a textbook example. I’d saved too much of the good stuff for toward the end—an oh-so-revealing interaction with another character.\n\nAll feedback gives me a shape to walk toward in the fog. I spent hour after hour revising the story. I moved the late interaction higher, to the second scene, and the story brightened. Then, a domino effect: with an earlier reveal, the infodumpy scene could be significantly trimmed down AND now had much deeper emotional impact on its own merits.\n\nThen I trimmed. And trimmed.\n\nDid the sentence teach me anything about the character? Could the second half of the sentence be snipped off? Was it necessary to include this information? Was this sentence too clever for its own good? Some of the phrases and images that had come to me first, helping to ignite the rest of the story, ended up being cut.\n\nThe story got slim. And crisp. And engaging.\n\nAt the same time, I was getting feedback from Paula Guran, the editor of my upcoming Ghost Summer short story collection, on an unpublished story called “Vanishings.” It wasn’t working for her. It was confusing.\n\nShe wasn’t the first to say it. I’d been tinkering with that story for at least two years, on and off. I’d shared passages aloud with my MFA students (which led me to ban the practice), I’d given it to my best friend from college to read. (It didn’t work for her; she didn’t get it.)\n\nAny time I struggle with a piece of fiction, I’m haunted by the unfinished stories on my old floppy disks, written in WordPerfect, when I was a newer writer. I lost interest in two novels, once about a hundred pages in, about two-hundred into another (hand-written, no less). I had a short story with a great gimmick I’d never truly paid off.\n\nMy unfinished stories haunt me—not because I really believe any of them were The One, but because I gave up on them. And I’m always afraid that I will give up on my stories again as writing seems to grow harder and harder.\n\nBut fresh from my last revision experience, I realized I could crack “Vanishings” too.\n\nThe story faced two primary struggles: I had geared it toward literary readers who might not be familiar with fantasy or magical realism, so I had minimized fantastic imagery. And I was relying on the gimmick of a late reveal to give an entirely new sheen of meaning to the story. Like The Sixth Sense.\n\nThe delayed reveal wasn’t working. Period. And the lack of specific fantasy imagery only created confusion for the readers—I was hinting at phenomena that I wasn’t showing. (Also, in part, because I was holding back for the reveal.)\n\nIn January, lecturing at the Whidbey MFA program, I gave a talk on writing mystery and suspense that specifically addressed the pitfalls of too much concealment. And here it was, right under my nose.\n\nWriting doesn’t get harder—it just stays hard. With practice, we expect it to get easier, but in truth we stretch ourselves and grow and grapple with new lessons. We seek new words to create order of the joys and terrors of our lives.\n\nI don’t want to get tired of writing. Writing gives me too much.\n\nAll of my fiction in recent years, one way or another, has helped me process the long illness, suffering and death of my mother, Patricia Stephens Due, in 2012—and the growing toll of time on my friends and family, who are also aging, sometimes dying, like Octavia Butler and Leslie (L.A.) Banks and E. Lynn Harris. I still can’t believe any of them are gone.\n\nIf you don’t need to write, sometimes it’s not worth the trouble. Sometimes people are struggling to write because of an outgrown dream or outside pressure—and life is too short. (James Weldon Johnson’s poem “A Poet to His Baby Son” is about a father’s disappointment that his son seems to have a poet’s eyes. Oh, what a road for one’s child!)\n\nWith a struggling project, sometimes it’s appropriate to move on. In my case, I needed to write more short stories before I started a novel. I think this is true of most writers. The ideas were bigger than my skill level—and by the time I gained the skill level, I had bigger ideas.\n\nBut giving up is very different.\n\nIf you have to write—if you must write—don’t give up on yourself and your projects.\n\nCarve out the time. Commit it to paper as a goal. Create an outline. Have writing quotas. And be brave enough to find beta readers to help you assess your writing. Trade manuscripts. Start a writing group, even if it’s only a group of two.\n\nAs readers, we can easily point out the flaws in the writing of others—but when it comes to our own, we often are standing too close. We need beta readers. We need editors. We need people who aren’t afraid to tell us the truth.\n\nRevise.\n\nAnd then stop revising and ask for a reader’s eyes. Because it may be ready at last.\n\nTananarive Due and Steven Barnes are teaching an online writing workshop March 7-28th. EARLY REGISTRATION OPEN. More information here.\n\nAUGUST 2015 UPDATE: The remains of my great-uncle, Robert Stephens, were positively identified from the Dozier School cemetery. [Read more here.]\n\nMARCH 2014 UPDATE: The [Rof South Florida exhumed 55 bodies from the cemetery.\n\nIn 1937, my great-uncle, Robert Stephens, was buried at the Dozier School in Marianna, Florida, with perhaps up to 100 other boys who never came home after being sentenced to the notorious reformatory. Last September, I went to Marianna with my father, husband and son to observe the beginning of exhumations at the site. I started writing this post the first week of September in 2013, and I’m only completing it in January of 2014. This was hard to write.\n\nThis is not only a story about the past. This story illustrates why our criminal justice system—racially biased and more and more dependent upon private prisons—is itself in dire need of reform.\n\n“Having so few inmates makes the crops come in slow;\n\nI fear we will not finish gathering the corn by January.”\n\n–Dozier School Superintendent Walter Rawls\n\nLetter to the Board of Managers,\n\nDec. 1, 1906\n\nSaturday, Sept. 1, 2013\n\nThe deputy sitting parked in his cruiser at the tree line gives us a slate with a form to sign, passes out badges we clip to our clothes. Then he directs us to Boot Hill, the cemetery hidden in the woods on the former grounds of the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna—Florida’s most infamous reformatory.\n\n“Follow the dirt road along the tree line,” the deputy says. “Turn left at the mudhole.”\n\nAnd so my husband, Steven Barnes, drives on with a carload of us: me, our 9-year-old son, Jason, and my 78-year-old father, civil rights attorney John Due. It’s only ten-thirty in the morning in Marianna, but the day already promises to be hot.\n\nWe drive into the moss-draped woods.\n\nWe are puzzling over what the mudhole might look like when Jason spots it—a huge puddle of thick mud on the roadside. Suddenly we are at the site of unearthed secrets. Makeshift crosses mark earlier visitors’ best guesses about where the dead are buried beneath the red soil.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 1, 2013, after a lengthy fight waged by families and survivors white and black, journalists, the NAACP, the Florida Attorney General’s office and the University of South Florida, researchers began their careful digging far from the crosses—where radar equipment used by USF forensic anthropologist Erin Kimmerle’s team found signs of unmarked graves.\n\nOne of the boys who died was my great-uncle Robert Stephens, who was reportedly stabbed to death by another boy in 1937. But in the fog of misery and mystery, how can we have blind faith in the claims made by Dozier?\n\nUntil the Florida Attorney General’s office called me in March, I had never heard about Robert Stephens, the uncle of my late mother, Patricia Stephens Due, whose name was listed in the Dozier School records as one of the boys who died there. He was fifteen when he died.\n\nMy aunt, civil rights activist Priscilla Stephens Kruize, says she never heard about him or his death. I do not know if my grandmother ever knew that her husband had lost a brother there. Robert Stephens died two years before my mother was born.\n\nSeventy-six years later, in 2013 Rev. Ronald Mizer of St. James AME Church, the Jackson County NAACP president, led a prayer with my family beneath the mossy trees as researchers paused their digging. My father, husband, son and I held hands and bowed our heads.\n\nAfterward, my husband planned to take our 9-year-old son, Jason, to a nearby tourist attraction while my father and I stayed behind to watch the excavation. But Jason surprised us all: he chose to put on gloves to sift through the soil with researchers.\n\nJason picked up a shovel to try to unearth his family’s past.\n\n“Look at that!” my father kept saying, watching his grandson at work.\n\nThis unburying has been a process of years. Of tearing down the woods. Of digging shallow trenches. Of revealing long-held secrets. Of searching for anyone who might remember the dead—who might have heard a lost boy laugh or cry, or who lay awake nights in worry. Some of the stories are so old, dating back to 1900, that no one is left to remember.\n\nMy father, husband, son and I came to mourn a stranger who was far from a stranger. Though we never knew of Robert Stephens, his loss had a ripple effect on my mother’s father and therefore on my mother. That loss shaped attitudes, family dynamics, dreams.\n\nWhat is any family’s incalculable toll when a child never comes home? Has died violently? Was likely imprisoned unjustly because of his skin color, like so many of our children still are today?\n\nLast July, my father and aunt went to Tampa to witness the DNA swabs taken from surviving family members of the lost. One of the men, named Robert Stephens after our long-dead relative, told the Tampa Bay Times that he volunteered a swab to help “find the truth.”\n\nNot everything that’s buried is gone.\n\n****\n\nThe stories from the Dozier School’s history are harrowing. The more you learn, the worse it gets.\n\nThe Dozier School operated from 1900 to 2011. It was finally closed in 2011 after a history of investigations and complaints.\n\nAccording to the Tampa Bay Times, which pioneered coverage of the story, in 2008 survivors came forward with stories of widespread physical and sexual abuse. In the CNN interview linked below, a family member alleges that her brother was murdered at the hands of school guards. In 2009, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it found no evidence of foul play at the site.\n\nBut in 2012, USF’s Kimmerle used the ground penetrating radar she has used to investigate war crimes around the world for the United Nations—and she found traces of 19 more grave shafts than the FDLE. There are more bodies than there are records for. School records show that another 22 boys died at the school, but their bodies were never accounted for. Kimmerle believes most of the boys buried there were black, though both black and white students died at the Dozier School.\n\nWho are the dead boys, and how did they die? Reports show that a fire claimed 12 lives. A flu epidemic claimed others. But it doesn’t account for so many dead.\n\nOvell Smith Krell’s brother Owen Smith was sent to the school in 1940, and she told CNN that her family never saw him again. School administrators reported that he ran away and later died of pneumonia, but a former Dozier student later told her Owen was shot and killed by Dozier school administrators when he tried to run away across an open field. Dozier School survivor Robert Straley told CNN that other boys were killed there too. HEAR THEM ON CNN HERE.\n\nFifty years later, grown men are haunted by the screams from the White House, where the beatings were dispensed. Survivors have created their own website: www.whitehouseboys.com. (In a moving Miami Herald video on the site, Michael O. McCarthy describes a brutal beating where he was struck more than 30 times: “They destroyed my childhood,” he says.)\n\nBlack survivors of the Dozier School have a Facebook page.\n\nAs one survivor, Charles Stephens, described it last April, two men held him down on a table while a third man lashed him. He said his back was so torn to shreds that his shirt had to be removed by a doctor. His parents were unable to visit him that weekend. He never told them about the horrors of his beatings, he said—he told the story for the first time in a room full of strangers meeting to advocate for exhumations at the school.\n\n“I stayed in the infirmary two weeks after my last beating,” said Stephens (no relation), who spent 18 months at the Dozier School in the 1960s, when he was 13. At age 61, the Panama City resident told his story publicly for the first time at the meeting last April.\n\n“I ain’t never got over it, but I survived it,” he said, voice quavering. “I’m sure some little kids died of pure fear. …Every time I went [to the White House], I made sure I got sent first so I wouldn’t hear the screams and hollering.”\n\nCharles Stephens is white. Other survivors were black—as are the majority of the dead, researchers believe. But although the boys at the Dozier School were segregated by race, white and black boys suffered together.\n\nJacksonville resident Cocomo Rock, who is black and sports dreadlocks, was sent to Dozier in August of 1966, when he was eleven. He lived there 22 months. As he listened to Stephens recall his time at Dozier, he could relate all too well.\n\n“I counted every day and every moment I was here,” Rock said.\n\nAnother survivor tells a story about how he found a single bright pebble to train his thoughts away from his White House beating, held it oh-so-tight to forget the pain—and still keeps the pebble in his pocket to this day.\n\nBurials records at Boot Hill stretch from 1914 to 1952, although the report cites school-related Dozier deaths until 1973.\n\nThe culture of abuse, survivors say, lasted beyond the last recorded school death in 1952.\n\nThe reformatory was all wrong from the start. According to the USF report, Florida led six investigations into the “school” in its first thirteen years. Boys in chains. Boys whipped mercilessly. Boys leased out for labor.\n\nIn Florida, prisoners were in a convict lease system. (In the wake of bogus vagrancy laws, according to the USF report, Florida’s black prison population rose dramatically, with convicts turned over to labor agents.) And the Dozier School was a labor farm—which, despite its name, never had desks in its early years, according to the USF report. Boys were put to work.\n\nIn 1906, the school superintendent complained that the school had too few inmates to bring in the crops; the Board of Managers changed sentencing guidelines and eliminated fees, and the population of children grew. (I can’t help thinking about Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella in Pennsylvania, sentenced to 28 years in prison for accepting kickbacks in exchange for sending juveniles to privately run detention facilities in a “kids for cash” scheme.)\n\nWere boys shot or mauled while trying to escape? Or was “trying to escape” a euphemism for random offenses at the jailers’ discretion?\n\nRemember: the Dozier School is set against set against the backdrop of bitter racial hatred and oppressive Jim Crow laws of Florida’s past. A former juvenile inmate said at the April 2013 meeting that Dozier guards “set the dogs on you” if children tried to run.\n\nAnd enough boys died at the Dozier School that it had its own cemetery. Surviving records indicate that the institution tended to underreport the actual number of deaths.\n\n“These are children who came here and died for one reason or another and quite literally have been lost in the woods,” Kimmerle told CNN. “It’s about restoring dignity and if not putting a name to them, at least acknowledging and marking that they’re here.” SEE KIMMERLE ON CNN HERE.\n\nUltimately, the state of Florida’s legislature approved $90,000 for the excavation. The U.S. Justice Department gave another $423,000 to match DNA from the remains to family members.\n\nSaid a survivor, Robert Straley, on CNN: “I’m angry at the state because they let this go on for 68 years and did nothing about it.” He said he was beaten with a leather strap and that some school leaders killed boys and made them disappear. “It’s important to find all the boys who were buried there. They’re practically crawling out of their graves crying, ‘Help remember me.’”\n\nWe hear you, children. We hear you.\n\nMY COMPLETE FACEBOOK PHOTO ALBUM: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10201870003772295.1073741826.1249308782&type=1&l=226a980a4e\n\nSEE THE FULL REPORT UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA INTERIM REPORT ON BOOT HILL CEMETERY AT THE DOZIER SCHOOL:\n\nhttp://news.usf.edu/article/articlefiles/5042-boot-hill-cemetery-interim-report-12-12.pdf\n\nADDITIONAL LINKS:\n\n2014: ABCActionNews.com: http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-tampa/tampa-mans-uncle-identified-from-dozier-school-for-boys-grave\n\n2009 Tampa Bay Times roundup: http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/dozier/\n\n2013 Tampa Bay Times excavation coverage (with photos): http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/human-remains-found-in-shallow-hole-at-dozier-school/2139448\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/03/us-usa-florida-school-idUSBRE9820V020130903\n\nhttp://www.myfoxtampabay.com/story/22088542/2013/04/26/state-funds-agreed-upon-for-unmarked-grave-search\n\nhttp://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/in-marianna-dig-for-truth-encounters-desire-to-keep-past-buried/2114932\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/03/12/justice/florida-boys-graves/index.html?c=us&page=0\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/us/10dozier.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\n\nI try to sound sympathetic, but secretly the stories are music to my ears.\n\nI couldn’t sleep. I had to put your book down for a while. The cover was so scary that I had to take if off. I can’t look at dead leaves the same way. My husband dressed up like your character and scared me to death when he jumped out of the closet. (He’s a keeper!)\n\nThe great Harlan Ellison once advised me to avoid labels like the plague, and I know some readers are forced to argue my case at their book club meetings. The scariest book I’ve ever read may be Toni Morrison’s Beloved, alongside novels like Pet Sematary by Stephen King. Horror is just a label.\n\nBut I like to write scary stuff. I don’t know why. If I want to write about a woman in a difficult relationship, her lover is an immortal. If I’m reuniting a character with her grandmother, Grandma has been dead for years. I can’t help myself. Sometimes I wish I could.\n\nOften, the supernatural element is more gentle and metaphysical, but once in a while I set out to give readers nightmares.\n\nIt’s not an easy task. Novelists have to compete with real-life headlines and everyday turmoil that are far scarier than anything we can dream up. Haunted house—so what? The bank just foreclosed on your house. Your boss just laid you off. Your parent is in a nursing home.\n\nThe challenge of writing scary fiction, I think, rests with the very thing that appeals to us as readers and writers: We’re looking for an escape. No matter what else happens to us over the course of our lives, we won’t have to confront a demon that can possess us. Most of us, anyway. Horror fiction scares us in a safe context. As both a writer and a reader, I look to characters unfortunate enough to land in these books for tools about how to behave when the world caves in on us.\n\nMy favorite experiences as a writer are when I can make myself cry…or scare myself. The crying is easy—I’m a softie. I can find myself bawling as I write a scene a reader might encounter without the blink of an eye. Whatever pain I’ve pricked might be purely personal.\n\nBut if I scare myself…chances are, I’ll scare the reader too.\n\nThe scariest book I’ve written may be a novel called The Good House. It’s my only book about characters facing a force that’s Evil through and through—so evil it had to be put to sleep hundreds of years ago, and my characters accidentally woke it up.\n\nEvery writer of scary fiction has a different philosophy about how to scare the pants off of readers, but I’ll use The Good House as an example of what worked for me. (And bear in mind that many of these tools are useful in creating engaging fiction across the board.)\n\n1.) Create characters your readers believe.\n\nThis is probably the most oft-ignored rule in bad horror movies and fiction. You can create the most frightening concept imaginable, but if you don’t have real people to unleash it on, your readers will yawn. Who would read a 300-plus page novel about a dog barking outside of a Pinto unless they really cared about the mother and son trapped inside? (Cujo.) Ask Stephen King how important characterization is in creating horror fiction.\n\nWhile I was writing, I tried to make the protagonist in The Good House especially vivid by pinning up a photo of Angela Bassett, after whom my lead character was named. I tried to infuse my book’s Angela with the brittle strength Bassett conveys in so many of her movie roles. The rest was just trying to imagine how I would behave if I found myself in her horrible predicament.\n\n2.) Delve into your own fears.\n\nThis might sound like a no-brainer, but sometimes writers do everything they can to avoid touching the heart of what frightens them. The Good House was chock full of real-life horrors: A friend’s sudden loss of her teenage son. A story from a shaman about a demon gone wild. A bizarre newspaper story about a man who drowned his son in front of his playmate.\n\nMost of all, I was grappling with intense feelings of isolation during the six years I first moved away from my family, job and friends in Miami to live in the Pacific Northwest. I expressed my own sense of rootlessness in a character with similar feelings, only amplified. It’s no coincidence that I wrote my first supernatural novel, The Between, after experiencing 1992’s Hurricane Andrew. (And that hurricane later showed up in my novel The Living Blood.)\n\n3.) Create a real world.\n\nOn one level, your readers are daring you to scare them. They’ve hunkered down into a mindset that says I-know-this-isn’t-real-so-there. A short prologue that introduces your supernatural element or gives them a tastes of the horror to come is a fine hook…but after that, slow down and take your time. Ground your story in the mundane aspects of life we all know and recognize…and then slowly begin to show your supernatural hand. By the time your readers realize you’ve roped them into believing the unbelievable, it’s too late. They’re stuck on the ride.\n\nAlso, give your characters—and your readers—time to breathe. One thrill-ride after another will desensitize them for the moments you really want to count. Slow down. Add some levity. A quiet dinner. A love scene. Then…gotcha!\n\n4.) Steer clear of movie clichés.\n\nThe Good House has elements of both a traditional haunted house novel as well as an Exorcist-style demon…but I didn’t set out to imitate anything I had seen before. My challenge was to try to re-imagine familiar concepts and make them my own. In her last novel, Fledgling, Octavia E. Butler delved into vampire mythology with her own unique interpretation, drawing on her skills as a science fiction writer. In my view, far too many writers set out to write horror fiction because they’re inspired by movies rather than the route any good writer should follow—reading a lot of good literature and developing a unique voice and perspective.\n\nIf you’ve seen it a million times before, so have your readers.\n\nDon’t watch horror movies, except for fun. Read, read, read.\n\nNote for screenwriters: This applies to you too. If you want to write horror scripts, READ horror scripts. And Oscar-nominated scripts. And any quality scripts you can get your hands on.\n\nI wrote three drafts of a screenplay adaptation of The Good House for Fox Searchlight with my husband and collaborator, Steven Barnes. My creative breakthroughs as a screenwriter during that time came after reading scripts like Josh Olson’s A History of Violence, Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later and 12 Monkeys, by Chris Maker & David and Janet Peoples.\n\nWatching the films is cool too, but I learned far more from reading the screenplays before and while viewing the final product.\n\nWhere’s the movie version of The Good House? So far, still on paper. In my imagination. Like most film projects, it fizzled out, awaiting a new home.\n\nBut meanwhile, Steve and I are collaborating on our first horror novel together—a zombie novel called Devil’s Wake. (It originated as a short story, “Danger Word,” we published in an anthology called Dark Dreams, recently reprinted in The Living Dead 2.)\n\nAnd yes, it’s going to be scary.\n\n*****\n\n2015 update: The Good House is currently optioned again. My newest short story collection, Ghost Summer, is on sale now. My YA zombie series with Steven Barnes, Devil’s Wake and Domino Falls, is also available now.
