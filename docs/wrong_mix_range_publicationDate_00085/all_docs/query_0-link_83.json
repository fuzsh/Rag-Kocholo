        "text": "Daniel Carter was a London cop who just wanted to do the right thing. But during a raid on an organ-selling chop shop, he is almost torn to pieces by monsters. And no one believes him. Hurt and crippled, his career over and his life in ruins, Daniel is suddenly presented with a chance at redemption. And revenge. It seems that more than two centuries ago, the monsters of the world disappeared—into the underworld of crime. Guildlike Clans now have control over all the dark and illegal trades. Only one force stands opposed to the monster Clans: the superstrong, extremely sexy, quick-witted Hydes! Now Daniel is just one sip of Dr. Jekyll’s Elixir away from joining their company. At Jekyll & Hyde Inc.\n\nGet Jekyll & Hyde Inc. eARC here.\n\nThomas “the Great Stoner” Stone once performed miraculous surgery upon Phillip Theophrastus Gribbleflotz, the World’s Greatest Alchemist, using his bare hands, no anesthesia, producing no pain, and leaving no scar. It would have been wonderful if it was real. But Dr. Tom Stone, the face of modern medicine, has been engaging in fake treatments—bringing all modern medicine into question. Gribbleflotz, who has learned a thing or two about actual science from those up-time elopers from Grantville, West Virginia, decides to go to Padua and turn his problems into Tom Stone's problems.\n\nGet 1637: Dr. Gribbleflotz and the Soul of the Stoner eARC here.\n\nComing soon to the Baen Free Radio Hour: John Ringo, Gary Poole, Mike Massa, Jason Cordova, and Lydia Sherrer discuss Black Tide Rising anthology We Shall Rise. And Eric Flint and authors on Ring of Fire alternate history collection Grantville Gazette IX.\n\nMissed past episodes? No problem. We’ve got every episode archived for your listening pleasure. All previous episodes are also archived at Baen’s YouTube Channel, here. And check out the new optional video podcast format!\n\nListen to the Baen Free Radio Hour now."
