Founded by Orissa Healy and Eliza Wilcox, the asylum's first home was a rented house that was located on Washington Avenue in Albany, New York. By June 1830, the asylum housed seventy children and had attracted much favor among the citizens of Albany. In 1832 the asylum moved to a new home at Western Avenue and Robin Street, where it would remain for almost the next 75 years. The first name of the institution was the Society for the Relief of Orphan and Destitute Children in the City of Albany; about 1850 it became known as the Albany Orphan Asylum.\n\nRev. Timothy Fuller served as superintendent from 1866 until his death in 1879. He was succeeded by his son, Albert D. Fuller, who served as superintendent until his death in 1893. Albert D. Fuller was devoted to the Albany Orphan Asylum and its children, as can be seen in the correspondence between him and children who had left the Asylum to return to their parents or were bound out to families. It was during Mr. Fuller's tenure as superintendent that the majority of the children's records were kept, including the individual case files. In 1891, Albert Fuller was also placed in charge of the Lathrop Memorial, another home in Albany for orphaned children. After he died in 1893, his wife, Helen Fuller, who served until 1902, succeeded him.\n\nBy 1904, the facility on Western Avenue was considered to be inadequate, so the trustees began to consider building a new facility. Believing children should be housed in smaller groups in a home-like setting instead of barracks with a communal mess hall, the board of managers (trustees), adopted what is known as the \"cottage plan,\" and began building a complex of four \"homes\" at 140 New Scotland Avenue; in 1907 the facility was opened. In 1910, the board named the cottages in honor of past leaders, James D. Wasson, Archibald McIntyre, General John T. Rathbone, and the Fuller Family. Â A substantial gift in 1914 from Mrs. John D. Parsons Jr. , in memory of her late husband financed the building of Parsons Cottage. By the 1930s, it was no longer an orphan asylum, so the name was changed in 1935 to the Albany Home for Children. Â In 1959 the present facility on Academy Road was built. In 1976 the name of the institution was changed to the Parsons Child and Family Center, honoring the major benefactor, John D. Parsons, Jr.\n\nFrom its beginning, the mission of the asylum was to provide food, shelter, and attention to the physical, emotional, and educational needs of orphaned and dependent children.Â Â These children included those who, although their parents may have been living, were neglected or not well provided for by them.Â The initial charge for caring for a child was fifty cents a week if the parent or guardian could afford it.Â If a child was destitute, the asylum would accept him/her if it had the funds.Â Many of the children returned to their parent(s) when their economic situation or health improved.Â The number of children received without pay was regulated by the condition of the funds belonging to the society.Â The counties who sent children to the asylum were charged for the care of those children.Â Much of the early financial support of the asylum came from local churches, which held fairs and benefits to raise money for the institution.Â The society also accepted gifts or money and property from individuals to further its mission.\n\nAt eight or nine years of age, many children were indentured to families who needed or wanted a child to help with domestic work, farm work, or for companionship.Â Children were indentured for a specific period of time, as indicated in the contracts found in many of the case files.\n\nThe governing body of the asylum was the Board of Trustees and the superintendent. The first officers of the institution were elected June 10, 1830; James O. Wasson was the first president of the board. The earliest minutes of meetings of the Board of Trustees refer to another governing body, the \"Lady Managers. \" However, records of the Ladies Association Auxiliary to the Albany Orphan Asylum in this collection do not begin until 1904. The Board of Trustees concerned itself with the organization, property, and expenses of the asylum and documented their activities in annual reports. The Ladies Auxiliary concerned itself with promoting the welfare of the children of the asylum. They had oversight and general supervision of the internal affairs of the asylum. They made suggestions to the Board concerning such affairs, and they took upon themselves matters referred to them by the Board.\n\nSeries Description\n\nThe majority of records Parsons Child and Family Center (Albany Orphan Asylum) are organized into eleven series that document primarily administrative functions activities this institution from its founding in 1830 until early 1930s.\n\nI. Â Organizational Papers Series, 1830-1996. Boxes 1-7.\n\nThe organizational series consists of material relating to the history and formation of the Asylum, including the original stockholders book from 1848. This volume contains a manuscript copy of the Constitution of the Society for the Relief of Orphans and Destitute Children and a print copy of same, June 3, 1830. The original stockholders each paid $2 and some families became joint stock holders. As stated in the constitution, the society was to be managed by a president and a board of managers, and that board was vested with the power to make by-laws, rules, and regulations as they thought proper for carrying out the objects of the society. The account book kept by Superintendent Orissa Healy, 1831-1833, includes name of first child received on December 2, 1829, record of children at the Asylum from 1830-1839, and the name of person or family to whom children were bound out. The volume containing the Original Act of Incorporation of the Society for the Relief of Orphans and Destitute Children, March 30, 1831, also includes memoranda admitting children to the Society, 1832-1865. The minutes of meetings of the Board of Managers (Trustees), 1841-1921, excluding 1848-1857, are contained in two volumes of manuscript records with some typewritten reports of meetings. Included in the records are the names of board members present at meetings, suggestions for internal investigation of arrangements and proceedings in the asylum, recommendations made for the hiring of teachers, weekly dietary costs per child, and appointment of members to various committees in charge of fulfilling the plans and goals for the Asylum made by the Board. Annual Reports, Superintendent's Reports, and Treasurer's Reports, 1832-1996, are manuscripts, printed, or typewritten, and some are bound volumes.\n\nII. Records of Children Series, 1835-1909. Boxes 8-25.\n\nThe Records of Children series consists mostly of manuscript records of children admitted to the asylum. The two earliest volumes, 1835-1842 and 1843-1882, contain dates children were received, age, by whom sent, when discharged, and remarks about the parents, including indicating if the child was an orphan. The later volume, 1843-1882, is indexed alphabetically, and includes case numbers 2383-2483, which can be cross referenced to the Record of Children in box 9, a Monthly Record of Children volume, a Population Book, and a Records of Indentured Children volume. The later volume also contains a list of children supported at the asylum in 1876 and a list of children who were bound out to families or ran away and later either returned to the asylum or were bound out a second time.\n\nThe five Record of Children volumes, covering the years 1877 through 1903, contain detailed information of children and their parents in two columns. Memoranda in regard to the child include: date of admission, date of birth, orphan status, by whom the child was brought to the asylum, place of birth, mental condition, physical condition, when vaccinated, if the child had a contagious disease, date of discharge, by whom taken, and when indenture terminated. Memoranda in regard to parents include: place of birth, address, occupation, religion, and names of relatives and friends. These volumes include case numbers 2448-7818 of the children so that they can be cross-referenced to the Monthly Record of Children volumes, Population Books, Records of Indentured Children, and the 1843-1882 Record of Children. The Lathrop Memorial volume is similar in format to the previous four volumes, but consists of information about the children at that institution, which Albert Fuller took charge of in 1891.\n\nThe Monthly Record of Children Received and Discharged volumes, 1877-1897, consist of monthly lists of children received and discharged, and the number of children on hand during that month. These volumes contain annual lists of children supported by the Asylum and lists of children out on trial or temporarily absent. Sanitary conditions for each month are also reported. Also included are registration numbers, which can be cross-referenced to the volumes in series containing case numbers for children.\n\nPopulation Books, 1876-1909, are indexed alphabetically by the county that had jurisdiction over the care of the children. Information includes date received, date discharged, date of birth, by whom brought, and the name of the Superintendent of Poor of the county charged for children. These records also contain case numbers, so they can be cross-referenced to other volumes in series containing case numbers.\n\nRecords of Indentured Children, six volumes, indexed alphabetically, 1879-1907. Information about each child includes name, birth date, admission date, parentage, mental and physical condition, remarks, indenture date and copies of correspondence reporting children's condition. The majority of the correspondence consists of letters between indentured children and Mr. Fuller (until his death in 1893), and then Mrs. Fuller, who became Superintendent after the death of her husband. Some records include case numbers so that records can be cross-referenced to other volumes in series.\n\nIII. Admission Records Series, 1865-1908. Boxes 26-27.\n\nThis series consists of certificates and memoranda containing the name, birth date, date of admission of the child, and name of county and amount charged for care of child.
