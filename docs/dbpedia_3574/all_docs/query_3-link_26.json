There were two others of the surname at about that time, Jeremy and Henry. They were all farmers. Zachariah was a deacon of the church in Reading. His residence was on “Fitch Hill.” In a centennial poem by Eaton written in 1844 is the following:—\n\n“I further looked, and on the hill,\n\nWhere now the heirs of John Gould dwell,\n\nUpon the western slope or pitch.\n\nThere lived old Zachariah Fitch.\n\nHis name he gave to hill and lane,\n\nA name they both as yet retain.” [*1]\n\nHe d.

The author is happy to insert here a biographical sketch prepared, at his request, by Rev. Henry Fitch Jenks.\n\nJeremiah Fitch, the eldest son of Jeremiah, Jr., and Lydia (Smith) Fitch, was born in Bedford, May 14, 1778. He received the common education of a country town. His father wished him to devote himself to farming, and as an inducement offered him the paternal farm; but, being of an enterprising spirit, and not having any inclination to agricultural pursuits, nor finding any other occupation which it was possible for him to follow in the town congenial, he left Bedford, at the age of fourteen, and came to Charlestown, with a capital of twenty cents, and, unaided by any one, set himself to procure employment.\n\nHe soon secured a situation with Mr. Samuel Ruggles,\n\n* Mary Rand was born at Chelmsford, whither her mother had gone from Boston, owing to the excitement in the latter town when occupied by the British. Her physician was Dr. Danforth, and she was helped away by his son Tom, who was a Tory. She carried with her a trunk of gold. The sentinel opposed her going, but Danforth interfered in her behalf with seeming roughness of manner, and said, “Oh, let the old woman go!”\n\nand from that time relieved his father from all pecuniary responsibility for his support. By diligent attention to business, he won the confidence of his employers, and gradually rose to higher positions.\n\nAfter a time he removed from Charlestown to Boston. When he became of age he was assisted to begin business for himself, but by the failure of his patrons he was involved in embarrassments, from which it took him a long time to extricate himself. His conduct under these circumstances, however, won him friends, who offered him capital and assistance. The offers were accepted, and diligence and carefulness secured him success. Prosperity followed his efforts, and he accumulated what for those days was a respectable fortune.\n\nHe first began business under the firm name of Nolan & Fitch, in 1799. Later he continued as an importer of dry goods under his own name, or that of Jeremiah Fitch & Co. He first occupied in Boston, in 1802, what was then 27 Cornhill (now Washington Street); in 1819 he removed to 5 Market Street (now Cornhill), and later, in 1826, after the great fire, to 38 and 40 Central Street. [*7]\n\nHe was always esteemed for straightforwardness and integrity in his dealings. For nearly twenty years he was a director of the Union Bank and of the Mercantile Marine Insurance Company. For many years he was a member of the Board of Health, retiring in 1821 to become a member of the last Board of Selectmen of the town of Boston; in 1824 he was a member of the Common Council, and in 1825 an overseer of the poor of the City of Boston.\n\nHe was an attendant at the church in Brattle Square, under the ministrations of Mr. Buckminster, Mr. Palfrey, and Mr. Lothrop, and long a member of the standing committee. During his service the old cannon ball which struck the Church during the siege of Boston and then had done duty for many years as a weight on the front gate of a neighboring residence, was by his instrumentality imbedded in the front of the edifice, where it so long remained, an object of interest not merely to strangers visiting the city, but to many now living who can well remember it.\n\nHe was hospitable to a high degree. Retaining the old farm which had been his father’s, he kept to the last his interest in his native town, and always welcomed to his city home his country friends and neighbors, and gladly did whatever he could for the benefit of the town. To the old church which he habitually attended he gave a clock and a pulpit Bible; and when the separation of the churches — which he greatly deplored — took place, he gave to the newly formed society, of which his old friend Rev. Samuel Stearns remained the minister, a piece of land an which to build the meeting-house. *\n\n* Mr. Fitch’s benevolence was not of the post mortem kind, but he freely and quietly gave of his accumulating wealth during his life, his donations being frequently made by the hand of his friend and early pastor, Rev. Samuel Stearns, with whom there was a mutual understanding. The pastor’s notice was sufficient to bring relief in any case of need in the town. The spacious kitchen of the old Fitch Tavern was turned to a storehouse at the annual Thanksgiving season, and from it was dispensed that which brought cheer to many a widow’s home. When driving to his native town, Mr. Fitch often dropped packages of books at the schoolhouse door, and each pupil had a share. Souvenirs of these days, when books were rare and costly, are carefully treasured in many of the old homes of the present. Adults were not infrequently remembered. The author’s library contains a volume of the “Panoplist,” the Trinitarian organ during the religious controversy, in which is the following, written on the fly-leaf: “Presented by Jeremiah Fitch, and distributed, with a few other volumes, at his request, by Rev. Samuel\n\n[ p 12 ]\n\nThe name of Pond Lane in Boston was changed to Bedford Street in compliment to him.\n\nHe was married in Boston, May 10, 1804, by Rev. William Emerson, pastor of First Church, to Mary, daughter of Robert Rand of Boston, and took up his residence in Hanover Street. Subsequently he lived in Cornhill (Washington Street), Portland Street, and Hamilton Place.\n\nMrs. Fitch was born Dec. 14, 1776, and died March 3, 1840, four months previous to his decease, which occurred at his residence, 1 Hamilton place, July 10, 1840. They were both buried nearly opposite their old residence in a tomb in the Granary Burying Ground.\n\nAlmon,^6 son of Jeremiah,^5 m. Mar. 28, 1814, Martha Wood. He d. Nov. 23, 1820; she d.

Fitch possesses many of the commendable traits of character of her father. The same unostentatious benevolence has characterized her life. Early inventions for the relief of the bed-ridden were furnished by her, books were freely dispensed, and the Public Library is now a channel through which she scatters blessings to all ages. At the organization of the High School, in 1885, she gave one hundred volumes as a nucleus for a school library.\n\nAuthor.\n\nAbel,^7 son of David,^6 m. Oct. 6, 1835, Nancy Bacon, d. Oct. 16, 1839.

His only advantages for early education were such as could be obtained at the district schools. In 1858 he became associated with the Baptist Bethel, devoted to the interests of seamen. He has been superintendent of the Sabbath school connected with that church thirty years, and a faithful friend of the sailors. He was a member of the Board of Aldermen of Somerville in 1883-4, and is prominent in the fraternities of Free Masons and Odd Fellows. He has followed the injunction, “Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,” and been abundantly prospered. [*8]\n\nIsaac Emerson,^8 son of Nathan,^7 a carpenter, m.
