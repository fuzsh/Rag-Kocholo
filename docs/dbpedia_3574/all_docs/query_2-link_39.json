        "text": "13. Walter FITCH was born on 20 Jan 1854 in Islington, London, Middlesex, ENG. He Citizenshp on 23 May 1894 in Circuit Court of Marquette County, Marquette, MI. He had petitiioned to become a citizen 30 Sept 1876. He was elected as in 1896 in Beacon, Marquette, MI. Board of Control of the Michigan College of Mines- President of\n\nthe Board of Control. Term expires June 9, 1905 He was elected as in 1899 in Michigan College of Mines, Houghton, Marquette, MI. According to the records from the Michigan Technological\n\nUniversity (which is what the Michigan College of Mines is now\n\ncalled) Walter Fitch was on the Board of Control of the\n\nMichigan College of mines from 1899 to 1904 and then again in\n\n1907 to 1908. He Newspaper about 1900 in Beacon, Marcotte, MI. The Champion Iron Company, of which Mr. Fitch is agent and\n\nsuperintendent, is the owner of extensive mines at Beacon,\n\nMichigan. The company was organized in 1868 to operate at this\n\npoint, and the mine was then opened and actively operated until\n\nJuly, 1893, when it was closed down and remained in a state of\n\ninactivity until January 1, 1895, when operations were resumed\n\nin two shafts. The company owns 15,000 acres of land in\n\nMarquette county. The mine has nine shafts, six of which are\n\ncapable of production and the maximum depth in 1,200 feet.\n\nThey mine crystalline iron ores of magnetic and specular\n\nvarieties and the total product of the mine up to the present\n\ntime is 3,000,000 tons, the ores beings shipped to Cleveland,\n\nOhio, and other Lake Erie ports. The present officers of the\n\nChampion Iron Company are: Joseph S. Fay, Jr. of Boston,\n\nMassachusetts, president; W.E. Stone, also of Boston,\n\nvice-president; W.B. Bosson, of Boston, secretary; and W.\n\nFitch, of Beacon, Michigan, agent and superintendent. Grant S.\n\nBarber, mining engineer and chemist, who was a student in the\n\nState University ;of Ann Arbor, has been connected with the\n\ncompany for four years.\n\nThe former agent, Alfred Kidder, of Marquette, held the\n\nposition form 1874 until 1893, when he retired. It was under\n\nhis management that the mine reached its career of prosperity.\n\nBefore he assumed control the career of the mine had been a\n\ncheckered one, and at the time he took charge an indebtedness\n\nof half a million dollars hung over the company, owing largely\n\nto inefficient management in previous years; but rapidly\n\nmastering the situation he placed the business on a paying\n\nbasis, wiped out the debt and the company was started on a\n\ncareer of almost phenomenal prosperity.\n\nThe successor of Mr. Kidder,-the present manager, -Walter\n\nFitch, is a native of London, England, born in 1854, and\n\nacquired his education in the public schools of that city. The\n\nfirst twenty years of his life were passed there, when he\n\nresolved to make a home beyond the Atlantic. He sailed for\n\nAmerica in 1874, and made his way to Michigan. In 1881, he\n\nbecame agent for the Pascoe& Dalliba mines at Champion, now\n\nclosed, and in 1884, he formed a connection with the Champion\n\nIron Company in the capacity of superintendent. Since 1893, he\n\nhas served both as superintendent and agent, and though his\n\nduties are onerous and his responsibilities great, he is equal\n\nto the work, and by his able discharge of the tasks which fall\n\nto him he has won the confidence and respect of the officers of\n\nthe company and of all with whom he has been brought in\n\ncontact. All the newer improvements of the mines have been\n\nadded during his term as superintendent. When in full working\n\nforce between five and six hundred men are employed and it will\n\nthus be seen that the superintendent is no sinecure.\n\nIn the community where he resides Mr. Fitch is regarded as a\n\nleading and representative citizen. In his political\n\naffiliations he is a stalwart Republican and has served as\n\nTownship Supervisor of Champion township, while at this writing\n\nhe is president of the Board of Education of that township. He appeared on the census on 30 Jul 1900 in Champion Township, Marquette, MI.

He will take up his new duties at Calumet on April\n\n1.\n\nWalter Fitch is one of the best known mining men in the country\n\ntoday. He is particularly well known throughout upper\n\npeninsula mining circles. Mr Fitch was, for a long term,\n\nmanager of the Champion mine in the iron country and in that\n\nposition he made a most enviable record for efficient results.\n\nAbout three years ago Mr Fitch left the iron country and went\n\nto Utah where he has made his home since. He was in charge of\n\nthe Utah Consolidated property as managing director but\n\nresigned tha position some months ago.\n\nThe Calumet & hecla company is most fortunate in being able to\n\nadd to the staff of General Manager MacNaughton such a\n\nthoroughly practical mining man as Mr Fitch. The appointment\n\nwill be generally pleasing to copper people, among whom Mr\n\nFitch has a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.\n\nMr Fitch while a resident of Michigan, was a member of the\n\nboard of control of the Michigan College of Mines, retiring in\n\n1905, after serving as president of the board. He was always\n\ngreatly interested in the institution and gave it much of his\n\npersonal attention and effort. He died on 23 Apr 1937 in Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, UT.

MINE COMPANT PRESIDENT DIES\n\nWalter Fitch Victim of Heart Malady\n\nWalter Fitch, 83, who rose from mine worker to a prominent\n\nfigure in the mining industry of America died Friday at 4:05 am\n\nat the home of his daughter Mrs J Fred Johnson, 713 East South\n\nTemple Street, of a heart disease. At the time of his death he\n\nwas president of the Chief Consolidated mining company at\n\nEureka, Utah.\n\nAt the bedside when death came were his widow, Mrs Exilda\n\nMarcott Fitch; Mrs Johnson and three sons Howard, Cecil, and\n\nWalter Fitch, Jr.\n\nBorn in London, England, January 20, 1854, he was a son of\n\nAlfred and Rebecca Fitch and had the usual education of English\n\nprivate schools. First finding employment in a lawyer's\n\noffice, he later worked in the stationary and printing\n\nbusiness.\n\nBegan Mining Work\n\nHis mining career began when he was 20 years old. At that time\n\nhe became dissatisfied with his position in England and came to\n\nAmerica, where he found employment at the mines in Michigan.\n\nLater he was shipping clerk for a lake boat company at\n\nMarquette, Mich. He was made mining manager of the Daliber\n\nand Pasco Mining company and later manager of the Champion\n\nMining company at Beacon, Mich., spending 30 years in the\n\nmining industry there.\n\nHe came to Salt Lake City in 1903 as manager of the United\n\nStates Smelting , Refining and Mining company, later returning\n\nto Michigan (this is where the page ends. I don't have the rest\n\nof the paper and the story) He was buried on 26 Apr 1937 in Fitch Cemetery, Eureka, Juab, UT. He Newspaper on 25 Oct 1963 in Eureka, Juab, UT. FITCH FAMILY PROMINENT IN DEVELOPMENT OF EUREKA\n\nWalter Fitch, Sr., and experienced mine operator from Michigan,\n\ncame to Eureka in 1906 and secured control of the Little Chief\n\nmine. Mr. Fitch and some of his associates from Michigan\n\nreorganized the mine under its present name, The Chief\n\nConsolidated Mining Company, and through the years have\n\nexpanded its holdings from 20 acres to more than 16 square\n\nmiles.\n\nThe mine was the mainstay of Eureka for a number of years. At\n\none time more than 600 men were employed at the mine. It was a\n\nblow to the town when the mine closed in June of 1957. The\n\nmine had produced 50,000,000 dollars of strategic metals during\n\ntwo World wars and the Korean conflict. The reason given by\n\none of the company officials at the time of the shut-down was\n\nthe high cost of underground pumping, the low prices of metals\n\nand the high cost of labor.\n\nMr. Fitch's leasing system was one of the first to give the\n\nemployee a chance to share in the profits in the mine and many\n\nof the successful leasers shared in the profits in a big way.\n\nMr. Fitch will long be remembered for his generosity to anyone\n\nin need, and for his backing worthwhile civic projects. He\n\npreferred to keep in the background and did not seek publicity\n\nof any kind for his many charitable acts, which were known only\n\nto those in need of assistance. After his death, his sons,\n\nCecil Fitch, Sr. was elected President and General Manager of\n\nthe mine, and carried on his father's policies in mining and\n\nhis interest in the town and its people. He and his father\n\nwill always be remembered as kingly, courteous gentlemen, and\n\nfor keeping Eureka from becoming a ghost town.\n\nCecil Fitch, Sr., retired in the spring of 1956, at which time\n\nhis son, Cecil Fitch, Jr., was elected President and General\n\nManager of the Fitch holdings. For more than 50 years, the\n\nFitch family furnished employment to hundreds of men and paid\n\nthousands of dollars in taxes to Juab Co.\n\nMr. Fitch's son, Cecil Jr., and two of his daughters and their\n\nfamilies, Mrs. Harold (Adelaide) Spencer, and Mrs (Ann)\n\nQuigley, still reside in Eureka. Mrs. Maude Hilsdale, a\n\ndaughter of Walter Fitch, Sr., lives here during the summer\n\nmonths and spends the winter months in California.\n\nThe Chief Consolidated mine is engaged in new ventures in the\n\nEast Tintic area. Some of the better values encountered in the\n\nEast Tintic area is on ground controlled by Chief Consolidated\n\nMining Company. He has reference number 4 Fit 1. Walter Fitch, Sr. of Eureka, Utah and his two brothers, Ernest\n\nFitch of Detroit and Aubrey Fitch of San Diego, Calif.,\n\ndescendants of Richard Fitch of Steeple Bumpstead, Essex,\n\ntestator of 1494; came to the United States from England in\n\n1874.\n\nErnest Fitch settled first at St. Ignace, Mich., about 1880 and\n\nmarried Emily Louisa Wray of Canada, whose father was a\n\nminister of the English church, holding pulpits in many\n\nCanadian towns. Four children were born of this union, all in\n\nSt. Ignace, Mich., as follows: Commander Aubrey Wray Fitch,\n\nUSN, born 1883, now stationed at San Diego, Calif., with the US\n\nNavy Pacific fleet; Basil Francis Fitch, born 1884, in 1929 an\n\nofficer of the Paramount Aircraft Corporation of Saginaw,\n\nMich.; Nora K., born 1886; d. 1910; Lola Vera, b. 1888, married\n\nRobert K. Slaymaker of 1419 Kensington Road, Grosse Pointe\n\nPark, Detroit. Ernest Fitch moved to Detroit in 1905 and in\n\n1929 resides there at 331 Manistique Ave.\n\nAubrey Fitch, brother of Walter and Ernest, is unmarried and\n\nresides (1929) at Tintic, Utah and San Diego, Calif. All three\n\nbrothers engaged in the mining business.\n\nWalter, Ernest and Aubrey Fitch are direct descendants of\n\nRichard Fitch of Steeple Bumpstead, County Essex, England,\n\nwhose will was proved in 1494. Richard Fitch of Steeple\n\nBumpstead is acknowledged to have been a descendant of the\n\nancient Fitches of Widdingotn and Lindsell, Essex.\n\nRichard Fitch of Steeple Bumpstead was the ancestor of Sir\n\nThomas Fitch of Eltham, Kent, who was knighted by Charles II,\n\n1679, served the office of High Sheriff in Kent, and was\n\ncreated baronet Sept 7, 1688.

Mrs Ahmad states that her\n\nuncle, Frederick Fitch, Esq., of Hadleigh House, Highbury, New\n\nPark, Middlesex, submitted the following pedigree to the\n\nHeralds' College, London, and permission was granted to use the\n\nFitch coat-of-arms, with one change, that the sword in the\n\nleopard's mouth be broken in the middle to indicate a missing\n\nlink between the very old Fitch family of County Essex and the\n\nlater branch.\n\nMr. Ernest Fitch has a photograph of the Pedigree chart of his\n\nancestors prepared by the Heralds' College for his uncle on\n\npayment of the customary fee for research.\n\nThe pedigree follows:\n\n1.

Incorporated as a city in 1892,\n\nEureka became the financial center for the Tintic Mining\n\nDistrict, a wealthy gold and silver mining area in Utah and\n\nJuab counties. The district was organized in 1869 and by 1899\n\nbecame one of the top mineral producing areas in Utah. Eureka\n\nhoused the \"Big Four\" mines -- Bullion Beck and Champion,\n\nCentennial Eureka, Eureka Hill, and Gemini-and later the Chief\n\nConsolidated Mining Company. The Chief was developed by the\n\nWalter Fitch family, who not only had their own mine in Eureka,\n\nbut also the company headquarters, family residences, and\n\nfamily cemetery -- a most unique feature in any western mining\n\ntown.\n\nAs with other mining towns, Eureka developed from a camp to a\n\nsettlement then town. It benefited from competing\n\ntransportation services of the Union Pacific (1889) and the\n\nDenver and Rio Grande Western (1891) railroads. Census\n\nstatistics indicate the following population figures through\n\n1930, when the impact of the Depression changed its fortunes:\n\n1880 - 122; 1890 - 1,733; 1900 - 3,325; 1910 - 3,829; 1920 -\n\n3,908; 1930 - 3,216. That Eureka's population exhibited ebbs\n\nand flows between census years was attributed to the transitory\n\ncharacter of a mining town. By the 1980s the population fell\n\nbelow 700.\n\nEureka's role as the central financial point for the district\n\ninsured its survival. It housed business establishments,\n\nfinancial institutions, local and county governmental buildings\n\nincluding Eureka City Hall (1899) and a Juab County Courthouse\n\n(1892), various churches, and the meeting places for numerous\n\nlabor, social, and fraternal organizations. Eureka became\n\nespecially active as a successful political field for Utah's\n\nSocialist party. Mining entrepreneurs such as John Q. Packard,\n\nJohn Beck, Jesse Knight, Walter Fitch Sr., and others loomed as\n\nimportant figures in Eureka and Tintic history. A relative calm\n\nand peaceful labor environment marked Eureka's past.\n\nThe Chief Consolidated operated during the 1930s and into the\n\n1950s, helping to keep Eureka's economy afloat. Small scale\n\nmining operations have continued, but most residents work in\n\nvalley towns and for government services, such as the Tooele\n\nArmy Depot. Being located on Utah Highway 6, Eureka is on a\n\nmain trail to the Little Sahara Sand Dunes area. In 1979 Eureka\n\nwas placed in the National Register of Historic Places as part\n\nof the Tintic Mining District Multiple Resource Area,\n\nrecognizing the importance of remaining buildings and sites.\n\nSee: Beth Kay Harris, The Towns of Tintic (1961); Alice P.\n\nMcCune, History of Juab County (1947); Philip F.

He makes his home at Eureka, where he supervises the\n\nmining interests which he and his sons projected some twelve\n\nyears since. He was born in London, England, January 20, 1854,\n\na son of Alfred Fitch, a descendant of the old Fitch family of\n\nEssex and Norfolk counties, England. The son Walter was\n\nseventh in order of birth in a family of nine children. He came\n\nto the United States in 1874, going to the mining region of\n\nUpper Michigan, where he engaged in mining work, ultimately\n\nhaving charge of and becoming the manager of a number of mines\n\nthere and in Minnesota, representing prominent Boston and\n\nPittsburgh interests. After twenty odd years service with\n\nthese he was superintendent of the underground operations of\n\nthe Calumet and Hecla and afterward was general manager of the\n\nUnited States Mining & Smelting Company of Utah, giving up\n\nthese to take up like work for himself.\n\nIt was in Michigan that Mr. Fitch was married to Miss Exilda\n\nMarcotte, a native of the state of New York. Mr and Mrs\n\nFitch's three sons and two daughters were all born in Michigan.\n\nAfter living there for thirty years Mr. Fitch and his family\n\nmoved to Utah, where he and his sons have, for the last twelve\n\nyears, been engaged in building up the business of their\n\ncompany-The Chief Consolidated Mining Company. The scene of\n\ntheir operations is in the Tintic mining district and it was\n\nhere they made their search for and found the mines which now\n\nrank as the largest in the district and as silver producers are\n\namong the largest in the country. After living in Salt Lake\n\nCity for two years the family, in 1909, decided to live at the\n\nmines, and to this action Mr. Fitch believes large credit is to\n\nbe given for the successful results gained.\n\nThe eldest of the sons, Howard Fitch, is engaged in the\n\ngeological department of the work. He served during the World\n\nWar with the One Hundred Fifteenth Engineers of the Sixth Army\n\nCorps, and was with the troops for eleven months in France.\n\nCecil Fitch and Walter Fitch, Jr., both graduates of the\n\nMichigan College of Mines, were the active factors in the\n\ndevelopment and opening up of the mines of the Chief\n\nConsolidated, Cecil has been twelve years at the work and is\n\nnow the general manager, while Walter, Jr., after devoting\n\nseven years to this, took up mining work on his own account and\n\nnow has a very successful business as a contractor of mining,\n\noperating in several states. The eldest daughter, Lillian,\n\nbecame the wife of J. Fred Johnson, who holds the position of\n\nsuperintendent of the Chief Consolidated Company. He served\n\nwith the One Hundred Sixteenth Engineers of the Forty-First\n\nDivision in France. Maud, the second daughter, is well known\n\nto the people of the state and in her own town for her\n\nactivities and her benevolent and enterprising characteristics.\n\nShe served in the World War with the English, Hackett-Lowther\n\nAmbulance Unit, which operated with the Third French Army in\n\nthe Compeigne and Saint Quentin campaigns. She received the\n\ndecoration of the Croix de Guerre.\n\nThe Fitch family are communicants of the Catholic Church and\n\nare its strongest supporters in their own village. Mr. Fitch\n\nand his sons are members of the American Institute of Mining\n\nand Metallurgical Engineers and of its local chapter, and also\n\nof the Alta and University Clubs. Mr. Fitch is a member of the\n\nCommercial Club of Salt Lake City and of the Rocky Mountain\n\nClub of New York, the Mining and Metallurgical Society of\n\nAmerica, of the Houghton Club of Michigan, one of the vice\n\ngovernors of the chapter of the American Mining Congress and\n\none of the regents of the University of Utah. He is president\n\nof his own company-the Chief Consolidated. He became a citizen\n\nof this country in 1876 and has always been a republican in\n\npolitics.\n\nSOUR: @S463@\n\nPAGE: pp 8-11 Page nine has a picture of Walter Fitch, Sr.\n\nThe entrance in 1909 of the Chief Consolidated Mining Company\n\ninto the area proved of great importance to Eureka and the\n\nTintic Mining District. Walter Fitch, Sr., had entered Tintic\n\nearlier, purchasing shares of the Little Chief Mining Company.\n\nOn January 21, 1909, the company was incorporated, and by March\n\noperations launched. Fitch erected a home near the Chief\n\nsurface plant. Completed in June, the dwelling was constructed\n\nby H.C. Campbell of Eureka. In July, Fitch organized the\n\nEureka City Mining Company, with the explicit purpose of\n\nprospecting under the Eureka townsite. The owner of an acre of\n\nground was to receive 1000 shares of stock for mineral rights\n\nto the property. According to records at the Juab County\n\nRecorder's office mineral rights to most properties were indeed\n\npurchased in 1909. By July 1910 the Reporter gave notice that\n\nthe Chief Consolidated and Eureka City Mining companies were\n\nconsolidating. Fitch's ventures proved successful. A December\n\n1909 account reported that fifty men were being employed, an\n\nassay office and a six-compartment ore bin completed, and that\n\nthe company sought the building of a machine shop. In\n\naddition, at that time a new hoisting plant was to be installed\n\nin the future. Within the next decade the Chief would emerge\n\nas a giant in Tintic.\n\nAnother mining company, the Utah Mineral Concentrating Company\n\nbuilt a concentration plant of 100 tons daily capacity in the\n\nlatter months on 1914. The experimental mill, intended to\n\nconcentrate ores primarily form the Chief, was built near the\n\nPlutus property east of the Chief No. 1 shaft, about 200 feet\n\nfrom the switch leading to the Eagle and Blue Bell and Victoria\n\nmines. Henry M. Atkinson, general manager of Utah Mineral,\n\ntook charge of construction. By January 1915 the mill was\n\nreportedly doing \"very satisfactory work,\" but in 1916 the\n\nplant closed for an indefinite period due to financial\n\ndifficulties.\"\n\nThe Chief Consolidated Mining Company surged ahead in the\n\n1910's. Just southeast of the shaft the area known as\n\nFitchville developed. Walter Fitch, Sr. had built a home\n\npatterned in a Swiss chalet-type of architecture in 1909\n\n(remodeled in 1917). During 1912-16 other structures were\n\nerected, and as Fitchville evolved main dwellings were erected\n\nfor Cecil Fitch, Sr.; Howard Fitch, the Chief's geologist; J.\n\nFred Johnson, who had married Lilian Fitch and was the\n\nsuperintendent of the Chief; and Walter Fitch, Jr. (later the\n\nHilsdale home), the Chief's contractor. These dwellings were\n\ndesigned by architect Walter J. Cooper who had arrived in Utah\n\nin 1910 to work for Henry Ives Cobb, the architect who\n\ndesigned, among other buildings, the Boston and Newhouse\n\nbuildings in Salt Lake City\n\nNew buildings were erected at Homansville in 1916 where the\n\nChief maintained a lime quarry. Later in 1917 new ore bins,\n\ndesigned by Cooper, were erected at the mine, and work\n\ncommenced on a shaft by Walter Fitch, Jr. In 1918 a brick\n\nchange room east of the hoisting plant was built. A highlight\n\nof the Chief's construction efforts centered about the sinking\n\nin 1918 of a new three-compartment shaft, known as Chief No. 2,\n\nabout one-half mile east of Chief No. 1. This shaft proved\n\nunique in being a triple compartment \"concrete-lined\" shaft.\n\nWalter Fitch, Jr., contractor, sank the shaft and the concrete\n\nwork completed by the Villadsen Brothers, Salt Lake\n\ncontractors. The Chief became the first mine in Utah to try\n\nout the advantages of a concrete shaft.\n\nOther mines initiated various ventures. The Eagle and Blue\n\nBell erected a new ore house in 1912, and later in the year a\n\nsteel gallows frame glistened at the Iron Blossom No. 1 shaft.\n\nOf particular impact was the construction in 1914 of a brick\n\nsub-station by Utah Power and Light, near Fitchville, which\n\nprovided an improved source of electrical power. The year 1915\n\nwitnessed increased activity in the shipping of various dumps.\n\nShipments were made from the Sioux mill and Eureka Hill mill\n\ndumps. In addition, the Mammoth mine shipped about 4,000 tons\n\nof tailings from the old mill near the McIntyre ranch. Such\n\nactivity continued sporadically throughout the 1915-18 period.\n\nLeasing proved very successful during the same period. The\n\nsystem involved the leasing of a block of ground within a mine,\n\nnecessitating the payment of royalties to the owning company.\n\nIn 1915 hundreds of lessors were reportedly doing very well at\n\nthe Gemini, Chief, May Day, Eureka HIll, Bullion Beck, Yankee,\n\nBeck Tunnel, and Colorado mines. The Chief's system of block\n\nleasing became the first to give the miner a chance at really\n\nsharing in the mine's profits.\n\nSOUR: @S465@\n\nPAGE: The Tintic Mining District; pp. 87,104, 105 (photo page),\n\n106, 135 (another photo page of Walter Fitch, Jr.'s Company in\n\nEureka.\n\nHe was married to FITCH on 3 May 1879 in Nagaunee, Marquette, MICH.
