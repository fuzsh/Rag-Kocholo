        "text": "1066: RELATIVE OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR & HOUSE OF BOLOGNE\n\nThe Fitch family traces its first settlement in England to the era of the Norman Conquest A.D. 1066. Morant's 'History of County Essex, England,' says that 'Robert Gernon or de Gernon came from France along with William the Conqueror and that he was a relative of the Conqueror and of the House of Bologne. One of his sons took the name of de Montfitchet, or de Montifiquet - the name is written these three ways in the Doomsday Book.\n\nMANOR OF WRAYSBURY & CASTLE AT STANSTEAD-MONTFITCHET IN ESSEX\n\nIn Normandy near Bayeaux is a village, Montfiquet, and it is a section from whence came some of the Conqueror's most illustrious followers.'William the Conqueror gave the manor of Wraysbury as a special donation to his blood relative, Robert de Gernon, who held it as part of his barony of which the head was at Stanstead-Montfitchet in Essex. Here he built a castle on a hill artificially raised for the foundation; this castle he presented to his youngest son. William de Gernon, who in accordance with the custom of the time, dropped the patronymic of de Gernon and assumed the appellative, 'Montfitchet. (Gylls 'History of Wraysbury.') William de Gernon who assumed the appellative, de Montfitchet, married Margaret, daughter of Gilbert, second Lord of Clare, and had a son, Gilbert de Monfitchet, who had a son, Richard de Montfitchet.\n\n1225: BARON AT RUNNYMEDE & MAGNA CHARTA\n\nRichard de Montfitchet was one of the Barons at Runnymede A.D. 1225 who wrested the Magna Charta from King John and was one of the 25 barons appointed to rule the Realm.\n\n1236: JUSTICE OF THE ROYAL FOREST IN ESSEX\n\nIn 1236 he was made Justice of the Royal Forest in Essex.\n\n1242: HIGH SHERIFF OF ESSEX AND HERTFORDSHIRE & GOVERNOR OF HERTFORD CASTLE\n\nIn 1242, High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire and Governor of Hertford Castle.\n\nNAME CHANGE\n\nHis third son was Roger de Montfitchet of Wraysbury, who had a son, John de Montfitchet, who tired of the prefix, 'Mont,' dropped it and spelled his name, John Fitche, leaving off the 't.' He was granted Armorial bearings in the year 1263, and was of 'Fitch Castle in the North,' 1294. (unpublished Fitch Genealogy, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, NYC)\n\nCOAT OF ARMS\n\nMembers of the Fitch family bore a coat of arms through the centuries as substantiated by the ancient records of the College of Arms, London, and the British Museum.\n\nThe very ancient Fitch Coat of Arms was:\n\nGold a roundle between three crosslets fitched sable, which seems to indicate the possibility that the arms were granted for bravery in the Crusades.\n\nThe sixteenth century Fitch coat of arms was:\n\nVert a chevron between three leopard's faces gold; Crest - A leopard's face gold in his mouth a sword proper the hilt gules; Motto - Promptus et Certus (In French Prompte et Certe), used by descendants of Thomas Fitch I of Norwalk, CT, Spes Juvat, by descendants of Rev. James Fitch I of Norwich, CT and Virtus Omnia Vincit by descendants of Samuel Fitch I of Hartford, CT.\n\nCLAIM TO DESCENDANTS\n\nThe claim of the descendants of Thomas Fitch, Esq., of Bocking, Co Essex, England, father of the four Fitch brothers who settled in CT, to the use of both the ancient and sixteenth century Fitch arms is first, through long use by our ancestors, as shown by records of the Heralds' College in London, and secondly, by pedigree certified by the College of Arms. The Fitch family is one of seventy-two American families included in the New England Historic Genealogical Society's Roll of Arms.\n\nRELATION TO LORD TENNYSON\n\nLord Tennyson was a descendant of the Fitch family, and was very proud of his Fitch ancestry. His A Dream of Fair Women was illustrated with a part of Fitch Castle in the North. His mother was Elizabeth Fitch, a direct descendant of Fitch Castle in 1294. (Rhoades, p 37)\n\nThomas FitchÂ’s daughter Elizabeth married George Clayton Tennyson and had son, poet Lord Alfred Tennyson. Tennyson was born on the fifth of August in 1809 and grew up in a small village of Somersby, Lincolnshire. Throughout his childhood his father, George Clayton Tennyson, suffered from deteriorating mental health, epileptic fits, and alcoholism. Tennyson's father went to Cambridge to study for the church, eventually becoming responsible for the Somersby Rectory. Alfred and his siblings were known to play in a brook at the bottom of the Rectory garden, and it was the scene of castle-building and mock-tournaments.\n\nElizabeth Fytche Tennyson, Alfred's mother, loved poetry and often read aloud to her children James Beattie's Minstrel, James Thomson's The Seasons, or the work of Felicia Hemans. Alfred memorized much seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poetry, including the works of Milton, William Collins, and Thomson, from which he derived many of his early techniques in writing loco-descriptive poetry. Elizabeth encouraged Alfred to write, while George viewed creative writing as a needless diversion from reading the classics. Alfred had a knack for story-telling. His sister Cecilia recalls that friends and family would listen open-eared and open-mouthed to legends of knights and heroes (qtd. in Ormond 8). Before the age of fourteen, Alfred had composed a six thousand line epic in the style of Walter Scott's Marmion and at least one blank verse drama entitled The Devil and the Lady.\n\nRootsweb.com: Contact: Brett D.
