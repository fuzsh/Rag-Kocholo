        "text": "INTRODUCTORY.\n\nThis is township two of range one of the Connecticut Western Reserve, and forms the extreme northeastern corner of Mahoning county. Coitsville is thus bounded: on the north by Hubbard, Trumbull county; on the east by Pennsylvania; on the south by Poland; and on the west by Youngstown. The township contains a little village of Coitsville Center, which, however, is situated a little south of the geo-\n\n---------------\n\n*Manly from facts collected by John Shields\n\n[Page 164] -\n\ngraphic center of the township; also a portion of the little mining village known as Thorn Hill, now in a condition of decline.\n\nThe land .......................................\n\nPURCHASE AND SURVEY.\n\nPrevious to the year 1798 Daniel Coit, of the State of Connecticut, purchased from the Connecticut Land company township number two in the first range, and gave to it the name of Coitsville. It does not appear that he ever became a resident of the township, but authorized Simon Perkins, of Warren, to act as his general agent.\n\nIn 1798 Mr. Coit sent on a party to survey his land and put it in the market. John Partridge Bissel was the chief surveyor and also the subagent for the sale of the land.\n\nORGANIZATION AND FIRST ELECTION.\n\nINTERESTING TOWNSHIP RECORDS.\n\nThe records of the township for a few years following its organization show a number of interesting facts. Here is one which we copy from Towship Record Book No. 1, page 98:\n\nAt a meeting of William Huston, Joseph Jackson, and William Stewart, trustees for the township of Coitsville, at the dwelling house of Joseph Bissel of said town, on Apr. 27, 1808, ordered, that every person subject to pay a county tax, according to the act passed by the General Assembly of\n\n[Page 164] -\n\n[Page 165] -\n\nTAXES IN 1803.\n\nFrom ancient records we learn that the entire amount of taxes assessed upon Coitsville in the year 1803, was $14.95.

He was a Revolutionary soldier and served three years. He was a Revolutionary soldier and served three years. He came to Coitsville in the spring of 1798, joined the surveying party and spent the summer assisting them. In the fall he returned to his home in Chelsea, Orange county, Vermont, having purchased all the land in Coitsville situated on the south side of the MahoningÂ—a tract of four hundred and twenty-six acres, mostly level, rich, and fertile. In December, 1798, with his wife and six children, he left Chelsea for his new home. Mr. Loveland started from Vermont with two sleighs loaded with bedding, furniture, farming utensils, etc., each sleigh being drawn by two horses. They traveled in this way until they reached the Susquehanna, which they crossed on the ice at Whitestown; the snow disappearing soon after, Mr. Loveland traded his sleighs for a wagon, transferred his goods into it and continued his journey. Apr. 4, 1799, he arrived with his family upon his farm. They began housekeeping in a small log cabin which he had erected the previous year. This cabin was about eighteen feet square; it had no glass windows, and its door was made of clapboards with two sticks across, two of them being hinges fastened by wooden pins. Not a nail had been used in the construction of this dwelling. A puncheon or split log floor covered about half the ground included within the log walls. There was no upper floor, and no chimney except a stone wall built up about five feet to keep the fire from the logs. In this cabin, of course with the addition of some improvements, the family\n\nlived six years, and then erected a larger and more convenient one.\n\nDuring the first year the family depended largely upon the results of hunting for their food, with occasional supplies obtained from the few neighboring settlements. Mr. Loveland cleared up his farm and resided upon it until his death, which occurred at the age of ninety. Mrs. Love land died when ninety-three. Her maiden name was Jemima Dickerson. The Lovelands were the first family in the township, and to them were born the first male, as well as the first female child born in Coitsville. Cynthia Loveland was born in June, 1799, and died in 1815. Her brother David, born a year or two later, was the second child born in the township. He spent the whole of a long life upon the old homestead, and his heirs still own some three hundred acres of the original farm. Elizabeth Loveland, one of the daughters, became the wife of William McFarlin and the mother of six sons and six daughters. She died June 16, 1881, aged ninety years, ten months and nine days. She enjoyed the distinction of being a resident of the Western Reserve longer than any other person, having resided continuously in the Mahoning valley over eighty-two years.\n\nJOHN P. BISSEL, the surveyor of 1798, purchased a farm including the center of the township, made a clearing, and built a log-cabin. In 1800 he emigrated from his home in Lebanon, Connecticut, with his family, consisting of three\n\n[Page 166] -\n\nsons and six daughters, and settled on his purchase. The family remained in Coltsville until 1805 or 1806 when they removed to Youngstown in order that the children might have better school advantages. Mr. Bissel was the first acting justice of the peace in Coltsville. He died in 1811. His daughter Mrs. Mary\n\nKyle resided upon the old homestead from the time of his father's death until her own. She died in 1880, in the eighty-third year of her age.\n\nASA MARINER, then a single man, was one of the surveying party. In 1798 he purchased a farm a little northwest of the center of the township, upon which he settled in 1800. He married Sally Beggs and reared a numerous and respectable family. This couple lived to a good old age, honored and respected. Mr. Mariner was a member of the Disciple church, his wife of the United Presbyterian. The old farm is still in the possession of two of the sons, Major James Mariner and his brother Ira.\n\nREV. WILLIAM WICK was a pioneer of Coitsville. He was a native of Long Island, New York, but came to this county from Washington county, Pennsylvania. Sept. 1, 1799, he preached a sermon in Youngstown, said to have been the first sermon preached on the Reserve. About 1801 he purchased a farm on the State line which is now occupied by the Beggs family. Mr. Wick was ordained a preacher of the gospel by the Presbyterian church and installed pastor of the congregations of Youngstown and Hopewell, now Bedford, Pennsylvania. All the Coitsville Presbyterians of the old school attended his church. He continued in his relation as pastor until death called him home in 1815. He was a very popular preacher and was instrumental in persuading persons of moral and religious character to settle in Coitsville. During his pastorate he preached fifteen hundred and twenty-two sermons and solemnized sixty-nine marriages. He was the father of eight sons and five daughters. Of this family eleven lived to mature age. Some of his sons attained some eminence in the political world. William was Secretary of State in Indiana and James a judge of the court of common pleas in Mercer county, Pennsylvania. The family were noted for being fine singers and proficients in penmanship.\n\nBARNEY HARRIS, the first blacksmith in Coitsville township, came from Washington county, Pennsylvania, and settled on section eleven previous to 1802. He brought up ten children, three sons and seven daughters. George, the only son now living, resides with his family in Iowa. Three daughters with their families still in this vicinity. Mrs. Harris was a daughter of Andrew Poe, noted for his encounter with an Indian near Georgetown, on the Ohio river. Mr. A. B. Wilson, a grandson of Barney Harris, resides on the old Harris farm. David Wilson came from Washington county, Pennsylvania, in 1803 or 1804. He had two sons and three daughters. Of this number only one son, David, is now living--a resident of Bedford, Pennsylvania. Mr. Wilson was a wheelwright by trade. In early years the little spinning-wheel was an indispensable article in every household, and Mr. Wilson engaged in its manufacture, and for many years gave employment to several men in his shop, where he made wheels, reels, and coffins. The improvements made in spinning machinery as time progressed destroyed one branch of this business, but he continued the undertaking business for many years. Mr. Wilson erected a grist-mill to be run by ox power, but after a few years' trial it was pronounced a failure and abandoned. He erected a brick house in 1815, which is still occupied by his descendants.\n\nALEXANDER McGUFFEY and family moved from Washington county, Pennsylvania, to Coitsville in about the year 1800. His father and mother, who were natives of Scotland, also came with him. The family were zealous Presbyterians. Alexander was a farmer, and settled near Sand Hill. His son, Rev. William McGuffey, became widely known as the author of a series of school books known as McGuffey's Eclectic Readers. William was brought to Coitsville in infancy. His motherÂ—an excellent womanÂ—used to delight in recounting the hardships they endured during the first years of their residence here, and how she used to place William in a sugar trough while she assisted her husband in clearing up the farm. William received his common school education in Coitsville, the writer of these sketches being one of his school-mates. Our school-house was a cabin built of round logs, situated at the corners of the farms now occupied by Thomas Brownlee, Rev. H. S. Boyd, Al. Wilson, and Ambrose Shields. William McGuffey afterwards taught school in the same place. He\n\n[Page 167] -\n\nbegan the study of the dead languages under John McCready, who taught a select school near Pulaski, Mercer county, Pennsylvania, in 1817; completed his college course and graduated from the college at Oxford, Ohio. He was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery, but was never the settled pastor of any congregation. Instead, he devoted his life to the advancement of education. He died in his seventy-sixth year at the residence of his daughter in Dayton, Ohio. But his memory will be long perpetuated by his works. William McGuffey was a man of genial temperament, a pleasant and affable speaker.\n\nDAVID AND REBECCA (ARMSTRONG) COOPER settled in the township in 1800. Five of their children still reside in Coitsville. He was a native of Maryland; his wife of Pennsylvania.

About the same time with him John Johnson settled on Section ten.\n\nSAMPSON MOORE, about 1802, settled on section ten. He lived and died in this township, and brought up his family here. None of his sons became settlers of Coitsville.\n\nWILLIAM, JAMES, JOHN and DAVID STEWART came here at different dates. All were early settlers. David settled west of the village. William, James, and John took up farms in the northwestern quarter of the township. David Stewart, son of William, lives on his father's old place. Robert Stewart, son of William, lives on section three. John and James settled near William.

He afterwards sold this and built where Mr. McCartney lives.\n\nDANIEL AUGUSTINE, a sober, industrious, honest German, settled in the township in 1802. His family is still well represented in this township. It is related of him that he was once offered $15 for a cow which he had for sale. He refused the price; said that $13 was all that she was worth, and all he was willing to take.\n\nWILLIAM BELL was an early settler in the north east of the township, lived and died here.

The same year he married Margaret Walker. He died in 1854 aged eighty years.

He operated it for a few years, but not finding the business profitable, sold out and thenceforth devoted himself to employments more useful and beneficial. Ammi R. and Prudence (Burrows) Bissel settled a little north of the village in 1806. Their son, Partridge Bissel, born in 1803, is still a resident of the township.
