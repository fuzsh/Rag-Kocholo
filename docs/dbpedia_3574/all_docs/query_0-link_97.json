Company, released and quit-claimed to the suffering inhabitants 500,000 acres, to be taken from the western end of the Reserve. The tract so granted embraces the present counties of Huron and Erie, the Township, of Ruggles in Ashland County, and of Danbury in Ottawa County. The name \"Fire-lands\" had its origin in the fact that the lands were donated because of losses which occurred by reason of fire.\n\nFrequently did the inhabitants of the nine suffering towns appeal to the Connecticut Legislature for some material recognition of their claims for relief. The state afforded limited aid by the abatement of taxes, but no adequate compensation was provided for some years.\n\nIn 1787, at the May session, the memorialists made another and a strong appeal, asserting the justness of their claims and complaining of the neglect their previous petitions had suffered. They earnestly urged the attention of the Legislature to their prayer, which was signed for the petitioners of the several towns as follows: By Charles Chauncey, of New Haven ; Philip Burr Bradley, of Ridgefield ; Daniel Taylor, of Danbury ; Thomas Fitch, of Norwalk ; Jonathan Sturges, of Fairfield; John Mead, of Greenwich; John Deshon, of New London; and Andrew Ward, of Groton. The assembly referred this memorial to a special committee, consisting of Hon. Andrew Adams, of the upper house, and Col. Jeremiah Wadsworth, Maj. Charles Phelps, Maj. Wm. Hart, Col. Charles Burrell and Capt. Moses Cleveland, of the lower house. (See documents relating to Revolutionary war, volume XXXVI, number 351.)\n\nIn October of the same year, this committee reported that, for want of exhibits, certificates and vouchers, they were unable to present either a correct statement of the amount of losses, or of the relief already granted by the state ; that the houses, buildings and furniture destroyed by the enemy \"ought to be, by this state, paid for at their just value ; and that the only means in the power of this state at present to pay the same, is in western lands.\" (Lb., Doc. 117.)\n\n- 1 -\n\n2 - HISTORY OF ERIE COUNTY\n\nThe report, after discussion, was approved, and with this the matter rested. Further action being postponed from session to session, Thaddeus Burr and others, at the December session of 1790, presented a new petition. Thereupon a committee, consisting of Hon. John Treadwell, Ashur Miller and Capt. John Chenwood, was appointed to ascertain the amount of the losses of the memorialists and others who had under-gone similar misfortunes. This committee entered upon its work without delay. At the May session of 1791, further time was asked and given. It was not until May, 1792, that the labors of the committee were so far completed as to enable the assembly to take action, which it then did as follows:\n\n\"At a general assembly of the State of Connecticut holden at Hart- -ford on the second Thursday of May, A. D. 1792 :\n\n\"Upon the memorial of the inhabitants of the towns of Fairfield and Norwalk, shewing to this assembly that many of the inhabitants of said towns suffered great losses by the devastations of the enemy during the late war, praying a compensation therefor, and a report of a committee appointed by the assembly at this session held at Hartford in May, 1791, to ascertain from documents in the public offices the amount of the losses of the said memorialists, and others under similar circumstances, which had been estimated conformably to acts of this legislature, being such as were occasioned by excursions of the enemy during the late war, distinguishing the losses of buildings and necessary furniture from those of other articles, by said documents or otherwise, and also to ascertain the advancements which have been made to sufferers by abatement of taxes or otherwise, and to report the same, with their opinion relative to the ways and means of affording for the relief, as per memorial and report on file.\n\n\"Resolved, By this assembly, that there be and there hereby are released and quit-claimed to the sufferers hereafter named, or their legal representatives where they are dead, and to their heirs and assignees forever, five hundred thousand acres of land belonging to this State lying west of the State of Pennsylvania, and bounding northerly on the shore of Lake Erie, beginning at the west line of said lands and extending eastward to a line running northerly and southerly parallel to the east line of said tract of land belonging to this State, and extending the whole width of said lands, and easterly so far as to make said quantity of five hundred thousand acres of land exclusive of any lands within said bounds, if any be, which may have been heretofore granted to be divided to and among the said sufferers, and their legal representatives where they are dead, in proportion to the several sums annexed to their names as follows in the annexed list.\"\n\nThe total amount of losses awarded was 161,548 pounds, 11 shillings and 61/2 pence New England currency, equivalent to $538,495.26. The board of commissioners ascertained that the number of sufferers was about 1,870. The following table will show in what proportion these sufferers and their losses were distributed among the suffering towns :\n\nThe names of the sufferers are classified by towns, and the amount of loss sustained by each is given in pounds, shillings and pence.\n\nThe following list is taken from the \"Classification Record,\" an old book in the office of the recorder of Huron County, and, though far from being well arranged, the names have been copied in the order there given. Even where a cursory glance might seem to show the list alphabetical, further examination will disclose many exceptions. The largest amount awarded to any one individual was to Jeremiah Miller, of New London, in the sum of 2,535 pounds, 18 shillings and 10 pence, or $8,845.31; the smallest on the list is that of Marah Kilby, of New Haven, 2 shillings and 6 pence or 41 2/3 cents.\n\nThe names on the list are familiar ones. Many of them and their descendants settled on the Fire-lands, and their posterity are numerous here today. The family names are almost exclusively of English derivation, there being a notable absence of the Irish, Scotch, French and German names so common at the present day. But the baptismal names were peculiar, and, in this respect, time has wrought changes. Amos, Abijah, Ephraim, Ebenezer, Eleazar, Hezekiah, Joshua, Justin, Jedediah, Jotham, Obadiah, Nehemiah, Titus, Timothy and Uriah were as common as Abraham, Benjamin, John, James, Matthew, Moses and Solomon, while Eliphalet, Eliakim, Shadrach, Shubael and Zechariah and many more names now unheard of are of frequent occurrence. The names of George, Charles, Albert, Edward, William, Henry, Frederick and Richard were not altogether wanting, but were less esteemed than those taken from scripture. In the names of women, Anna, Abigail, Charity, Deliverance, Deborah, Prudence, Priscilla, Ruth, Thankful and Temperance are as easily picked out as Lucy, Mary, Jane and Sarah. It is needless to say that there were no Allies or Bessies, Jennies or Minnies.\n\nAnother feature will strike even the most casual reader, and that is the absence of the middle names—scarcely one person in a hundred is so provided—while Jr., 2nd and even 3d, are common suffixes used to distinguish those of the same family having the same name."
