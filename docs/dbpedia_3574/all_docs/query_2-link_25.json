        "text": "Return to main file\n\nMajor James Fitch (1649â1727), son of Reverend James Fitch and Abigail Whitford\n\nAlice Bradford (c. 1658/63â1745), daughter of Major William Bradford and Alice Richards\n\nJames, the son of James Fitch, was born on 2 August 1649 in Saybrook, New London, Connecticut. [1] Major James Fitch died on 10 November 1727 in Canterbury, Windham, Connecticut. He married first Elizabeth Mason in January 1676 in Norwich. [2] Elizabeth was James's stepmother's sister, the daughter of Major John Mason and Ann Peck, and the granddaughter of Reverend Robert Peck. [3] She was born in August 1654 in Saybrook. [3] She died on 8 October 1684 in Norwich, New London. [2] Captain James Fitch married second Mrs. Alice Adams on 8 May 1687 in Norwich. [2]\n\nAlice was the daughter of Major William Bradford and Alice Richards. [4] She was born about 1658/63 in Plymouth. Alice, the wife of Major James Fitch, died on 15 March 1745, age 83, in Canterbury. [1] She married first, as his second wife, Reverend William Adams on 29 March 1680. [4] William was born on 27 May 1650 in Ipswich. [5] He died on 17 August 1685 in Dedham. [4][5] He married first Mary Manning of Cambridge on 21 October 1674. [4][5] Mary, the daughter of William Manning of Cambridge, died on 24 June 1679. [5]\n\nWilliam Adams was the second minister in Dedham. [4]\n\nThe inscriptions on James's gravestone and footstone in the Cleaveland Cemetery in Canterbury say: [6]\n\nHere lies the Body of Majr James Fitch Esqr son of ye Revd Mr James Fitch Pastor first of Saybrook then of Norwich He was born at Saybrook 1647, He was very Useful in his Military & in his Magistracy to which he was chosen & Served Successively many years to ye Greate Acceptance & Advantage of His Country: being: A Gentleman of Good Parts & very forward to Promote ye Civil & Religious interests of it. He died Nov. 10 1727 Age 80 y.\n\nMaj. James Fitch Esqr, Departed this life in the 10th day of November AD 1727 in the 80th year of his age. (footstone)\n\nThe inscription on Alice's grave in the Cleveland Cemetery says: [6]\n\nIn Memory of Mrs Abee Fitch Daughter to Honble Wm. Bradford Esqr Lieut Govr of ye Colony of New plymouth Relict of ye Honorbl James Fitch Esqr Late of Canterbury. A person of Rare qualities & Excellent Indowments. An Example of Virtue & Ptrn of piety. She after an exemplary Life Fell Asleep March ye 12 A D [broken] 84 years of her age\n\nAlice's grandmother Welthian Richards left her sixty pounds, apparel and bedding in her will of 3 July 1679. This was far more than Welthian left to any of her many other grandchildren. But, she added a caveat. If Alice married without her consent or the consent of Welthian's executor, Alice was to lose all bequests.\n\nMajor James Fitch was one of those admitted to the First Congregational Church in Norwich between 1660 and 1699. Apparently, after committing some infraction, he made a confession and was restored on 9 April 1704. [7]\n\n\"His energy, self-reliance and inflexibility of purpose, with his strong sympathies with the cause of the people, would have qualified him in an eminent degree for a popular leader, had it not been for his occasional rashness and the violence of his opposition to men or measures that interfered with the accomplishment of his objects.\" [8, 3:456â7, editor's comments]\n\nThe Winthrop brothers referred to James Fitch as \"Black James\" and said that he was the leader of \"rude fellows of desperate fortune.\" In his article about Fitch, James N. Poteet calls him a \"politician, land speculator, and disturber of the established order in colonial Connecticut.\" [9]\n\nTheÂ History of Windham CountyÂ says, \"In private life, Major Fitch was genial, generous, hospitable, agreeable in manners and conversation, but somewhat over-convivial in his habits, so that he was sometimes compelled to make confessions to the Church, as well as to the State. In spite of censures and occasional suspension from communion, he retained through life his connection with the church of Norwich, though ever ready to do his part in sustaining public worship at Canterbury. The homestead at Peagscomsuck was long a noted business and social centre.\" [10, 154]\n\nOn 29 February 1675, Joshua Uncas, son of Uncas, Sachem of Moheag, made his will, leaving land to James Fitch, Jr. and Joseph Fitch. James Fitch, Assistant, entered the will on 29 April 1684. [11]\n\nMr. James Fitch of Norwich was propounded for freeman on 13 May 1675. [8]\n\nJames was a deputy for Norwich at the May and October courts from 1678 to 1680 and the October court in 1681. [8, 3: 3, 16, 26, 35, 48, 66, 86] He was chosen a commissioner for Norwich for the ensuing year at the May courts from 1678 to 1680. [8, 3: 5, 26, 49] He was nominated to stand for election for assistant at the October courts in 1678 and 1679. [8, 3: 23, 37]\n\nIn 1679 the New London court ruled that Uncas and his son Owaneco should transfer 600 acres in compensation for damage caused by their men in a drunken outbreak. In October, the General Court ruled that Jamesâthe county treasurerâshould sell the land. He sold it to John, Solomon and Daniel Tracy, and Richard Bushnell. [10]\n\nMr. James Fitch, Jr. was appointed to a committee to compensate Indians for damaged corn on 9 October 1679. The same court granted him liberty to use a 200-acre farm south of John Tracy's, given to him by Uncas and Owaneco. [8, 3: 43â44]\n\nIn May 1680, James was confirmed as the captain of the Norwich trainband. [8, 3: 60] James was confirmed Sergeant Major New London county in October 1696, a position he was formerly appointed to by the governor and the council. The four Connecticut sergeant majors were declared majors in October 1697. [8, 4: 189, 226]\n\nJames was appointed to a committee to audit colony accounts at the October 1680, May 1682, May 1683, October 1690, and October 1692 courts. [8, 3: 72, 102, 120; 4: 37, 79]\n\nIt appears that land was granted somewhat haphazardly in Connecticut, leading to frequent arguments, and many of these involved misunderstandings with the Indians. In May 1680, James was appointed to a committee to hear about differences with the Indians and between them. [8, 3: 52] In October 1680, he was on a committee to settle the boundary between New London and the Mohegans. [8, 3: 71] In May 1681, Captain James Fitch was appointed to a committee to go about with Uncas, sachem of Moheag, and ascertain what lands he thinks are his. [8, 3:81] In May 1683, he was appointed to a committee to procure land for the Pequots in Stonington; its success was reported at the October 1683 court. [8, 3: 117, 125]\n\nIn 1680 and 1684, James persuaded Owaneco, the son of Uncas, to accept him as his guardian and vest in him the title to the Quinebaug country: a swathe of land encompassing more than one million acres. Unfortunately for James, the father of the Winthrop brothersâGovernor John Winthrop, Jr.âhad also acquired a claim from a different chieftain. The long battle for control of the Quinebaug, which James ultimately lost, is described by James Poteet in his article, \"More Yankee Than Puritan: James Fitch of Connecticut.\" [9]\n\n\"The double land claim occasioned much confusion. The Fitch and Winthrop adherents were at open war with each other. Major Fitch was especially careless as to the character of his tenants and had great difficulty in collecting rents from them. The first existing records relating to the Quinebaug Plantation tell of opposition, violence, resistance to authority and other high-handed misdemeanors.\" [10, 107]\n\nCaptain James Fitch was an assistant at the May courts in 1681 to 1691 and the October courts in 1682, 1683, 1686 , 1687, 1689 and 1690. He was an assistant at both the May and October courts from 1692 to 1697 and 1700 to 1704 and at the May court in 1705 to 1708. [8, vols. 3, 4]\n\nOn 24 June 1684, James procured a deed from Owaneco (also signed by his son and heir Josiah and further confirmed by a quitclaim from some Shawtucket Indians who had lived there) to a large tract of land. The parcel was north of Norwich [Windham], joining it from the Waramanticut River to Abaquage pond. From the pond, the line ran east to the Quinebaug River. From the Waramanticut River, the line ran about 45 miles to the southwest boundary, a great pond called Misshinaps. From there, it ran north to and beyond the Massachusetts border, containing the Nipmug and Wabaquassuck countries. In May 1686, the court noted that Captain James Fitch had purchased the native right to Wabaquassett country and settlers from Roxbury wanted to settle there, which the court granted. A patent was issued to James Fitch and several others on 8 July for the new plantation in Wabaquassett country. The bounds comprise current-day Pomfret and northern Brooklyn. [8, 3: 202]\n\nOn 13 June 1689âduring Jacob Leisler's administrationâCaptain James Fitch and Major Nathan Gold were ordered to New York to meet with Leisler. They arrived on 21 June. [8, 3: 255]\n\nIn October 1690, the court granted James that his former grant of 1,000 acres should be 1,500 acres near the northeast corner of the colony line. [8, 4: 40]\n\nIn 1691 and 1692, James wrote and published two pamphlets, A Plain Short Discourse and A Little of the Much, justifying the resumption of a charter government. In 1859 they were not known to exist. James's purchase of the Waquasset and Nipmug country and other large tracts in New London and Windham County made him one of the largest landowners in the colony. It increased his interest in ousting Andros, who did not respect Indian titles and deeds. [8, 3: 456, editor's comments]\n\nOn 6 March 1692/3 the court voted that a company should join with Massachusetts in an expedition against the enemy to the east. It was decided to send 30 Indians with them and James was one of three people charged with picking a man to lead them. [8, 4: 90]\n\nOn 1 June 1693, John Tracy of Norwichâby an appeal from a court on 20 September 1692âsued Captain James Fitch of Norwalk for refusing to give him a deed for one-tenth of his land in Wabaquasett and Nipmuck contrary to an agreement of 15 February 1685. He asked for the deed and damages of 100 pounds. The previous jury had found for Fitch; this court found for Tracy and ordered Fitch to produce the deed and pay 49 shillings in costs. [12] On 12 October 1693, upon a petition by John Tracy, the general court ordered that a deed be prepared for Fitch to sign, and if he refused, he must appear before the general court in May. [8, 4: 109]\n\nThe October 1693 court said it was concerned about growing disputes over land differences between the Indians, namely Owaneco and Abimileck, differences in which [James's first wife's brother] Captain Samuel Mason and Captain James Fitch were engaged, and other disputes as well. It directed Governor Colonel John Allyn and Mr. Nathaniel Stanley to go to Norwich to ascertain the situation and report to the court. [8, 4: 108]\n\nAt the October 1696 court, Colonel Allin, Major Fitch, and Major Sellick were appointed to revise the law on the valuation of money and advise the court. Colonel Allin, Major Fitch, and the secretary were appointed to revise colony's laws. [8, 4: 189]\n\nThe May 1697 court put James and Captain Witherell in charge of repairing the fort at New London. [8, 4: 213]\n\nIn January 1697/8, James was appointed to a committee to meet with the Rhode Islanders and agree the boundary between Rhode Island and Connecticut. [8, 4: 238]\n\nIn 1697 James moved to Canterbury. By then, his fortunes were suffering; his enormous land dealings incited jealousy and lawsuits. He was charged with various maladministrations. [10]\n\n\"The social position of Major Fitch and his wide business relations, drew many people around him, and his plantation at once became a place of no small consequenceâa rendezvous for land traders, civil and military officials and hordes of idle Indians. Here courts were held, military expeditions organized, and many thousand acres of land bartered away.\" [13, 483]\n\nAt the May 1698 court, Major General Fitz John Winthrop was elected governor, and James was not elected an assistant. Captain Samuel Mason replaced James on the committee to meet with the Rhode Islanders. [8, 4: 244, 259]\n\nIn October 1699, Fitz John Winthrop, Jr. of New London, Esq. and Waitstill Winthrop of Boston, Esq. appeared in court to appeal a 19 September 1699 County Court decision. They claimed Major James Fitch of Pigscomsuck in the County of New London had illegally entered the Quinebaug on 6 April 1696, which they owned, and began occupying and improving the land. The Winthrops had claimed 500 pounds in damages, but the jury found for Fitch. The jury in the appeal found for the plaintiffs and awarded them Â£5-19-10 in damages. Fitch appealed in May 1700. [12]\n\nIn October 1699, attorneys for the country constituted by the governor and the council brought complaint against Fitch for the illegal purchase of a \"great tract\" of Owaneco's land in the Nipmug and Wabaquassett country. [8, 4: 305]\n\nOn 13 November 1699, James, Joseph Spalding, Richard Adams, Joshua Whitney, Benjamin Spalding and James Kingsbury signed a petition to incorporate Plainfield and hire a minister. [10]\n\nIn May 1700, after being left out for two years, James was elected an assistant again.\n\nIn October 1701, the deputy governor and the council ordered a writ against Fitch, ordering him to appear before the General Assembly in May to answer John Gallop's complaint of maladministration. [8, 4: 368] On 4 November 1701, James Fitch was the plaintiff in a defamation suit against Mr. John Gallup of Stonington. The court found for him, Mr. Gallup was assessed costs of Â£2-09-06. [12]\n\nIn May 1702, John Fellows, Ebenezer Harris, and John Gallup, Jr. complained that they had cleared, planted, and brought nearly to harvest crops on land in Plainfield. James had forced them off, arrested and imprisoned themâextorting a considerable amount of money for their release. The court ruled that James's conduct was \"very erroneous and illegal\" and he was liable for the complainants' losses. [8, 4: 391]\n\nOn 24 December 1702, James signed an agreement for two religious societies in Plainfield. James and Richard Adams were two of the east side signers; Joseph and Benjamin Spalding, Jacob Warren, Stephen Hall, and Joshua Whitney were some of the west side signers. [10]\n\nIn May 1703, John Winthrop launched a complaint against Fitch, accusing him of mishandling witnesses in the case of Nicholas Hollam's contesting of John Liveen's will. The court found Fitch guilty of maladministration. [8, 4: 430]\n\nIn October 1703, the Worshipful Major James Fitch and Captain Richard Bushnell were charged with leading the soldiers in Preston to a choice of officers. [8, 4: 442]\n\nWhen John Winthrop and Waitstill Winthrop sued Philip Bump for trespass on 17 November 1703, James Fitch acted as his attorney. He was an attorney for Joseph Johnson of Plainfield on 3 May 1705 in a case against the Winthrop brothers. The court found against Johnson. In May 1707, the court awarded him costs in a case where he acted as attorney for Benjamin Clarke against the Winthrop brothers. [12]\n\nThe May 1706 the court appointed a committee to mediate the differences over the land at Quinebaug between the governor and Major James Fitch. [8, 4: 535]\n\nThe October 1707 court appointed James to make an equal division of the soldiers in Stonington. [8, 5: 33]\n\nAt the October 1710 court, Major James Fitch of Canterbury, on behalf of the town, petitioned for an order settling the boundary between Canterbury and Windham. This was granted. [8, 5: 181]\n\nOn 25 June 1711, the Congregational Church in Canterbury held its first meeting at Major Fitch's house. [7]\n\n\"Major Fitch, during these years was unquestionably the leading citizen of Canterbury, though his pretensions and exactions involved him in frequent quarrels with his fellow-townsmen. In public affairs he was still very prominent, though often in collision with the government and its officials.\" [10]\n\nJames Fitch claimed the land that is now Stafford by Indian title. This was disputed by the governor and and Fitch responded with, \"As to a kind of proclamation lately come forth from the Honourable Governour and Council, in February last, I had thought to have taken it to pieces, and I think I could have done it and cut it in as many pieces as the protestant did the popish woden god. ... God save the King, and the Colony of Connecticut from self defining and self seeking men.\" Fitch was confronted in the General Assembly, and in May 1717, he made a written acknowledgment of his bad behaviour towards his Honor the Governor, asked for a pardon and promised to behave better. The Upper House wished to punish him, but he was discharged. [8, 5:586]\n\nJames retired to Canterbury, where he died.\n\nJames did not leave a will. He deeded his property to his children, apparently subject to an agreement (not known to still exist) that they would support him and his wife. His two surviving children by his first wifeâJedidiah, who moved to Nantucket, and Samuel, who moved to Jamaica, Long Islandâwere apparently not parties to this agreement. [5]\n\nChildren of Major James Fitch and Elizabeth Mason:\n\ni. James Fitch was born in January 1677 in Norwich and died there a week later. [2]\n\nii. James Fitch was born on 7 June 1679 in Norwich. [2] He apparently died young, as there is no further record. [5]\n\niii. Jedidiah Fitch was born on 17 April 1681 in Norwich. [2] He died on 20 November 1756 in Nantucket. [5] He married Abigail Coffin (Peter, Peter, Tristam) on 13 September 1701 in Nantucket. [5]\n\niv. Samuel Fitch was born on 12 July 1683 in Norwich. [2] He died in 1729 in Hopewell, New Jersey. [5] He married Mary Unknown. [5]\n\nSamuel moved to Jamaica, Long Island.\n\nChildren of Major James Fitch and Alice Bradford:\n\nv. Abigail Fitch was born on 22 February 1687/8 in Norwich. [2] She married Colonel John Dyar on 22 October 1713 in Canterbury. [1][5] John was the son of Joseph Dyar and grandson of Thomas Dyer. [5]\n\nvi. Ebenezer Fitch was born on 10 January 1689 in Norwich. in Norwich. [2] He died on 20 November 1724 in Windsor, Hartford County, Connecticut. [1] He married Bridget, the daughter of Eleazar Brown of Canterbury on 18 September 1712. [14] Bridget married second Captain John Perry of Ashford. [5] She married third Samuel Hall of Wallingford, New Haven County, Connecticut. [5]\n\nEbenezer died intestate. [5]\n\nEbenezer Fitch of Windsor petitioned the Assembly to grant and confirm his title to 650 acres in Canterbury that had been given to him by his father Major James Fitch. This was granted in October 1714. [8, 5:454]\n\nThe Assembly granted Ebenezer's father Major James Fitch 500 acres beyond New Roxbury on 9 October 1690. James had taken them up north of Killingly. This was not recorded and the land was subsequently confirmed to others. In May 1723 Ebenezer asked for 500 acres to be confirmed to him someplace else and this was granted. [8, 6: 403]\n\nOn 13 May 1731, Daniel Fitch, John Dyer and his wife Abigail, Henry Cleveland and his wife Lucy, Theophilus Fitch and Jabez Fitch, all of Canterbury; Daniel Bissel and his wife Jerusha of Windsor; and John Fitch and his wife Alice and James, Elijah, Eliezer, Medinah and Ebenezer Fitch of Ashford, Windham CountyâJames, Alice Elijah, Eleazer, Medinah and Ebenezer Fitch all being the minor children and coheirs of Ebenezer Fitch, late of Windsor deceased, who petitioned by their guardians, the said John Fitch And Daniel Bissell. They said that on 24 May 1723 John Dyer had conveyed to Ebenezer a 500 acre grant from the Assembly which had been lost and they asked it to be renewed. In addition, they also asked for the right to land in Canterbury that Major James Fitch had given Ebenezer who was apparently to divide them among himself; John Dyer, Henry Cleveland and Daniel Bissel in right of their wives; and Theo and Jabez. [5]\n\nThe John Fitch who married Ebenezer's daughter Alice was Ebenezer's first cousin, the son of John Fitch and grandson of Reverend James Fitch. [5]\n\nvii. Daniel Fitch was born in February 1692 in Norwich. [2] He married Anne Cook on 5 March 1718/9 in Canterbury. [1]\n\nviii. Jerusha Fitch was born in 1699. [15] Jerusha, the daughter of Major James Fitch, married Daniel Bissil, Jr. of Windsor on 18 March 1718. [1][5][14] Daniel, the son of Cornet Daniel and Margaret (Dewey) Bissell, was born on 31 October 1694. [15] Daniel (Daniel, John, John) died on 11 November 1770, age 76. [5]\n\nJerusha, the daughter of Major James Fitch, was admitted to the Congregational Church in Canterbury on 7 July 1717. [14]\n\nDaniel made his will on 21 October 1765; it was 29 November 1770. He named his wife Jerusha, his sons Jabez, Daniel and Fitch, and daughters Jerusha, Margaret and Lucy. [15]\n\nix. Lucy Fitch married first Henry Cleveland. [5] She had an unknown second husband. [5]\n\nLucy's half sister Elizabeth Adams said that Lucy was the daughter of James and his second wife. [5]\n\nx. Theophilus Fitch died \"awfully\" on 20 July 1751 in Canterbury. [5] He married first Mary Huntington on 15 December 1731 in Canterbury. [5] Mary was born on 4 August 1707 in Windham. [5] Mary, the daughter of Deacon Joseph and Rebecca Huntington of Windham, died on 12 March 1732, age 25. Mary was the granddaughter of Simon Huntington and granddaughter of Simon Huntington. [5] Theophilus married second Grace (Prentice) Grant on 2 October 1734 in North Stonington. [5] Grace Prentice (Samuel, Thomas, Thomas) was born on 16 January 1705 in Newton, Middlesex County Massachusetts. [5] She married first Josiah Grant. [5] Josiah (Josiah, Samuel, Matthew) died on 30 April 1723 in Stonington. [5]\n\nTheophilus's half sister Elizabeth Adams said that Theophilus was the son of James and his second wife. [5]\n\nOn 17 October 1752 Samuel Fitch, a minor son of Mr. Theophilus Fitch, chose Elijah Dyer of Canterbury to be his guardian. [5] Elijah was Samuel's first cousin, the son of Colonel John and Abigail (Fitch) Dyar. [5]\n\nThe inscription on Mary's grave in the Cleveland Cemetery says: [6]\n\nHere lies buried ye body of Mrs. Mary Fitch wife of Mr. Theophelus Fitch Daughter of Decn joseph Huntington & Mrs. Rebekah Huntington of Windham. A Vartuus & Worthy young Woman in ye Flower of har Youthful Dayes Dyed March ye 12 1732, aged 25 years.\n\nxi.
