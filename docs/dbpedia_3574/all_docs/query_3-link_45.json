        "text": "Our orthopaedic doctors and surgeons can help treat pain or injuries to bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints including:\n\nAnkle\n\nAchilles tendon\n\nBack/Neck\n\nElbow\n\nFoot\n\nHand\n\nHip\n\nKnee\n\nShoulder\n\nWrist\n\nWe also offer on-site physical therapy, chiropractic care, and amputee care and prosthetic training.\n\nIn-House Spine Injection Suite for Your Convenience\n\nIn our sterile spine injection room, spine specialists offer a wide range of injections to relieve symptoms or pain related to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine:\n\nEpidural steroid injections treat pain/symptoms from the spinal nerves due to inflammation, compression (“pinched nerve”), narrowed spinal canal or other irritations.\n\nDiagnostic block injections help pinpoint the source of your pain/symptoms using numbing medication to prepare for additional treatments.\n\nNerve block injections use a mixture of numbing medicine and steroids to treat nerve pain/symptoms.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses energy to damage specific nerves so that they no longer send pain signals to your brain.\n\nJoint injections target pain that originates within joints, like the facet, sacroiliac (SI), and hip joints.\n\nGuided by real-time, low-dose X-ray images -- called fluoroscopy -- specialized physiatrists deliver medication right to the source of your pain. Additional time slots mean you may be able to receive your injection sooner. In some cases, you might be able to see your doctor and get an injection on the same day. After a short recovery period to monitor for any complications, a staff member will personally escort you and your driver to your vehicle.\n\nCare for Before and After Surgery\n\nIf you need surgery, our orthopaedic surgeons can see you at this location for pre- and post-surgery consultations. Surgical procedures are performed at Duke Ambulatory Surgery Center Arringdon, Duke University Hospital, Duke Raleigh, Duke Regional Hospital, and Duke Ambulatory Surgery Center.\n\nDuke Health contracts with most major health insurance carriers and transplant networks, including the ones listed below. Before scheduling your appointment, we strongly recommend you contact your insurance company to verify that the Duke Health location or provider you plan to visit is included in your network. Your insurance company will also be able to inform you of any co-payments, co–insurances, or deductibles that will be your responsibility. If you proceed in scheduling an appointment and your health insurance benefits do not participate with Duke, your out of pocket liability may be higher. We will contact you regarding your coverage and patient liability. If you are uninsured, learn more about our financial assistance policy."
