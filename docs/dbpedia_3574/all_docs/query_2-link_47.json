        "text": "CHAPTER 1 African Captives Arrive in New England\n\nThe first Africans in the Connecticut colony likely arrived during the years of the Pequot War, perhaps as a result of trade in Native men who were taken prisoner and enslaved. In fact, the first known Africans in neighboring Massachusetts were bought from the proceeds of selling Pequot captives; they arrived in 1638, on a ship with cotton and tobacco. This trade continued, and in 1646, the New England Confederation codified that Native captives should “be shipped out and exchanged for Negroes.”\n\nNew Haven, home of Yale College, was an integral node in the vast world-wide network of commerce in human beings and cultural transformations.\n\nAlthough it is uncertain exactly when the first Africans arrived in Connecticut, their presence was initially recorded in 1639, when an enslaved Black boy named Louis Berbice, from Dutch Guiana, was killed by his owner in Hartford. And Africans may have been present in New Haven even earlier, likely from its founding. Lucretia, a Black woman, belonged to the colony’s founder and governor, Theophilus Eaton, and may have arrived with him.\n\nAfricans came to New England generally via British colonies in the West Indies, although some were transported directly from Africa. They hailed from the Senegambia basin of West Africa, the Grain Coast, the Windward Coast, Benin, Biafra, Dahomey, West Central Africa, and once in a while even as far east as Madagascar. But after 1700, the majority had been swept from the coastal and inland regions of modern-day Ghana, known by the eighteenth century as the Gold Coast or the “slave coast” to European slave traders.\n\nThe ghastly business of the slave trade was a three-to-four-century-long commercial enterprise in which Africa provided the one product Europeans most wanted—people—in exchange for firearms, textiles, and other manufactured goods. Its scale, methods, and consequences have defined the meaning of inhumanity, as well as forged humane mass movements against oppression, ever since the emergence of a modern world. New Haven, home of Yale College, was an integral node in the vast world-wide network of commerce in human beings and cultural transformations.\n\nIn 1700, on the eve of the creation of the Collegiate School that would soon become Yale, one in ten property inventories in the colony of Connecticut included enslaved people. The prominent property-holding families in the principal towns of New London, New Haven, Norwich, and Hartford were slaveholders. Fully half of all ministers, doctors, and public officials in the colony owned at least one or two enslaved Africans. One could not live and work in or near a Connecticut town without seeing enslaved Black people.\n\nThey were, of course, people—with identities, although too often recorded only by first names. In Farmington, an Isaac Miller owned Phebe, Cuff and their son, Peter. Cuff was sold to a Joseph Coe in 1744, and Phebe to the same slaveholder ten years later. A notation in Coe’s deed of sale demonstrates the enslaved man’s demand for a last name that he himself chose: “Cuff desires to have the Sir Name Freeman annexed to his Name.”\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nChapter 1 Yale’s Beginnings\n\nIn the fall of 1676, during the brutal and destructive conflict that came to be known as King Philip’s War, James Noyes wrote to John Allyn, a colonial military and political official, pleading for Native captives. Noyes, a Harvard-educated minister, was serving as chaplain to a company of colonial settlers. Feeling wronged and overburdened, he reminded Allyn he had “been 3 times in your war service,” and on each occasion he was cheated out of the wages and captives rightfully due him.\n\nThe Reverend James Noyes, who would become one of Yale’s founding trustees, wanted a captive to enslave who “maye be worth having.”\n\nAlready in possession of four captives—a fourteen-old girl, a five-year-old girl, their sick mother, and “a Gentleman never used to work, [who] had been sick & lame in his limbs”—Noyes wanted Allyn to send him a young, healthy captive. The minister had sent the sick man away, presumably to die, but, regrettably, he returned to him, and Noyes had been nursing him with food and medicine for three weeks.\n\nNoyes seemed well informed about the other available captives and was not interested in any of them; “I know of none I like lately come in,” he said. Still others, he knew, had been sent to Barbados—a reminder of this war’s global reverberations in the West Indies and throughout the Atlantic. Noyes was willing to keep the girl, her mother “if she live,” and the five-year-old, but he hoped to receive “a young man a fourth when I can light of one that maye be worth having.” Worth having; the Reverend Noyes wanted a laborer to own in body and perhaps soul.\n\nIn this wartime emergency as well as in more stable times, the Reverend Noyes viewed enslaved Native Americans and eventually Africans as saleable property, commodities at his disposal as a Christian Englishman in a colonial frontier society. In their ambitions, their theological certainties, and their material quests, the Puritans at war in seventeenth-century Connecticut were also the drivers of an early form of commercial expansion and conquest.\n\nAs the theologian Willie James Jennings writes, the Christian “imagination” of the English colonists in New England produced a “breathtaking hubris” demanding that “the natives, black, red or everyone not white, must be brought from chaos to faith. The land, wetlands, fields, and forests must be cleared, organized and brought into productive civilization.” In this lethal mixture of historical circumstances forged by mercantile empire, religious migration, displacement into new worlds, and war for survival and dominance, the Christian imagination, writes Jennings, fell into a “diseased form” increasingly linked to slavery and conquest, to a concept of property in man that demanded ever more creative justifications.\n\nTwenty-five years after writing his letter to Allyn, in 1701, Noyes was one of the ten trustees who established the Collegiate School, the forerunner to Yale College, in Saybrook, on the shoreline of Long Island Sound. When Noyes and his contemporaries set out to found their school, they did so within a political, cultural, and demographic landscape that had been transformed by decades of warfare—by the blood shed—between settlers and indigenous peoples. Yale’s New England origins lie in these seventeenth-century stories of destruction, migration, and enslavement, both Indigenous and African.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 2 Yale’s Founders and Slavery\n\nOn October 9, 1701, the general assembly in New Haven authorized the creation of a college and named ten clergymen as trustees of the new school. The next month, seven of these ministers, all but one trained at Harvard, gathered in Saybrook, Connecticut on the shores of the Long Island Sound, for their first meeting.\n\nEnslaved men, women, and children in the archives of Yale’s founders have remained nearly invisible for three centuries, but to a degree they have been hiding in plain sight.\n\nIn attendance were Samuel Andrew of Milford, Thomas Buckingham of Saybrook, Israel Chauncey of Stratford, James Pierpont of New Haven, Abraham Pierson of Kenilworth, Noadiah Russell of Middletown, and Joseph Webb of Fairfield. Together, what they established was essentially the idea of a college, with a few rules about how degrees were to be administered and a stipulation that its leader would be called “rector.”\n\nFledgling to say the least, this school had been authorized by the colonial assembly, which began with a grant of £120 as well as the assembly’s approval to spend an additional £500 per annum. A wealthy landowner, James Fitch, also donated a farm the college might use for rental revenue. And so instruction of a sort began, with one undergraduate degree given in 1702, along with a handful of master’s degrees.\n\nSome slaves were likely present at the first trustees’ meeting. An early twentieth-century history of Yale describes the journey to Buckingham’s house, picturing the clergymen “followed on horseback by their men-servants or slaves, into old Killingworth Street.” In early eighteenth-century Connecticut, laborers of all sorts, particularly those who served the clergy class, were frequently enslaved or indentured servants. Indeed, of the ten first trustees of what became Yale College, at least seven, and possibly others, owned one or more slaves.\n\nThe Reverend Buckingham, in his will, left to his son, Hezekia Buckingham, “my negro boy called Peter to be his Slave Servant,” and to his “son-in-law John Kirtland of Saybrook my negro boy called Philip to be his Slave Servant.” The Reverend Chauncy, in the inventory of his estate, listed “A Negro girl” valued at £40, below “An horse” and “eight sheep” and above “a Great Brass kettle.” Other founders left similar such calculations and matter-of-fact statements of human chattel property in their estates and inventories.\n\nEnslaved men, women, and children in the archives of Yale’s founders have remained nearly invisible for three centuries, but to a degree they have been hiding in plain sight. Of the founding trustees, the Reverend Woodbridge—namesake of Woodbridge Hall—was the largest slaveholder. Church records show that he and his wife owned and baptized Black individuals named Isabella, Cesar Diego, Thomas, and a thirteen-year-old boy named Thorn, whom he sold “in plain and open market.” Furthermore, Abigail Woodbridge, his wife, inherited from her first husband a man named Andrew, who eventually married Tamar, a slave owned by the Reverend Woodbridge. Tamar and Andrew had children named Lydia, Isabella, and Daniel.\n\nParents, children, and siblings were often separated, sometimes as gifts or when an estate was broken up.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 2 How Yale Got Its Name\n\nThe small Collegiate School, Yale’s precursor, conducted classes in Saybrook, Wethersfield, and other Connecticut towns until it moved permanently to New Haven in 1716. During this period the college found a major benefactor and future namesake from abroad.\n\nElihu Yale oversaw many sales, adjudications, and accountings of enslaved people for the East India Company.\n\nElihu Yale was a wealthy man, born in Boston, who had moved to England as a child and grown up as landed aristocracy in Wales. He spent many years in Madras, India, first as a clerk, then as a writer, eventually becoming governor of the East India Company in that lucrative outpost of the British empire.\n\nThe East India Company conducted enormous commerce out of Madras, on India’s southeast coast, and it sanctioned and regulated part of the Indian slave trade. Yale himself oversaw many sales, adjudications, and accountings of enslaved people for the East India Company. When he was governor, the “Consultation Books” frequently would report such decisions, as in 1687, when he and his agents, over Yale’s signature, “Order’d that ten Slaves be sent upon each of the Europe ships for St. Helena, to supply that Island.”\n\nBecause of a famine in 1687, enslaved people were frequently sold off to Indian Ocean coastal ports and islands. The governor’s office reported that year “that one hundred Slaves bee sent them … they being by the famine, extreamly cheap.” In 1689, Yale reported that the frigate Pearle returned from Vizagapatam. Part of the cargo was shackles “for well secureing the slaves.”\n\nSometimes Yale and his fellow agents dealt out enslavement as punishment for crimes, as on September 24, 1687, when “Three people were punished for a crime by being sentenced to life slavery for the company.” Dozens more of these kinds of reports exist in records of Fort St. George.\n\nPrecisely whether or how many people Yale personally may have owned is not yet discernable, nor perhaps even the key question. Some portion of Yale’s considerable fortune, amassed while British governor-president in Madras, derived from his myriad entanglements with the purchase and sale of human beings.\n\nIn an otherwise highly favorable history of Yale College’s origins, written in 1918, Franklin Bowditch Dexter leaves a remarkable statement about the governor’s character, saying he left a “record of arrogance, cruelty, sensuality, and greed,” and compares him to the biblical king Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nBetween 1713 and 1721, Yale sent hundreds of books, a portrait of King George I, and “sundry goods and merchandizes” to support the Collegiate School of Connecticut. As per Yale’s instructions, the goods were sold, and the proceeds went to the building of the college house. It was not an insignificant donation, but in the context of Yale’s enormous wealth, the college was hoping for more.\n\nIn honor of his contributions, and to entice him into additional donations, the Collegiate School constructed a building called Yale College. From that day forward, the third-oldest institution of higher learning in America would be known by that name.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 1 The Contradictions of Jonathan Edwards\n\nIn 1720, Jonathan Edwards, an extraordinarily well-read teenager, completed his baccalaureate degree in New Haven at what had become Yale College. Over the next nearly four decades he became America’s greatest theologian.\n\nEdwards, perhaps Yale’s most prominent graduate in its first century, was a willing and representative slaveholder, a famed model for so many other Yale leaders and graduates.\n\nEdwards viewed all races of people as descendants of Adam and Eve, and therefore of the same original sin and human possibility, and he saw Africans and Native Americans as equal to Europeans in their potential for godliness and evil.\n\nIn 1739, he surmised that when the millennium arrived in a few hundred years, “Negroes and Indians will be divines.” They would write “excellent books,” become “learned men, and “shall then be very knowing in religion.” Edwards contended that a slaveholder should not abuse his servant because “we are made of the same human race.”\n\nAlthough he would condemn slave trading in the Atlantic, he never opposed the ownership of enslaved Africans in his community and his household. Indeed, Edwards, perhaps Yale’s most prominent graduate in its first century, was a willing and representative slaveholder, a famed model for so many other Yale leaders and graduates.\n\nA genius with rhetoric and the most probing founder of American theological and philosophical literature, Edwards embodied multiple contradictions or “Puritan dilemmas.” Piety and oppression, deep personal religious faith and a fully hierarchical view of human society, marched together in the Puritan worldview.\n\nThe Puritans came to accept the existence of slavery, while endeavoring to control and condemn the abuses of slaveholders. They tried to infuse the inhumanity of slavery with ethical guards against the tyranny of the slave owner. Servitude was somehow natural, including chattel slavery, but the slaveholder must not abuse his terrible power, an ethically untenable proposition. Such a complex paradox in the life of Edwards informs much of the evolving early history of Yale College as well.\n\nDuring his undergraduate years at Yale, the young Edwards kept a spiritual diary, attempting to record the nature and growth of his faith. Intensely intellectual, anti-social, and constantly questing to embrace an elusive “holiness,” Edwards struggled with inner “wicked inclinations,” as “God would not suffer [him] to go on with any quietness.” And there is little surprise that Edwards’s inward “violent struggles” did not concern the fate of the Black and Native people he saw around him, free or enslaved. Their fate, though, walked within and without his life and that of Yale College.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 3 Follow the Money\n\nFrom its founding, Yale received financial and political support from some of the most influential and prominent families in Connecticut and beyond. These same families were often involved, personally and through their business interests, in slaveholding.\n\nBy the 1730s, Philip Livingston, Sr., with his own sons attending Yale, owned shares in at least four slave ships operating out of New York harbor; all told, he and his sons invested in at least fifteen slave voyages to and from Africa.\n\nAmong the wealthiest and most significant family benefactors of Yale were the Livingstons of New York, a dynasty of three generations of human traffickers and merchants. In 1690, New Yorker Robert C. Livingston first invested in a slave voyage to the west coast of Africa.\n\nRobert’s son, Philip Livingston Sr. (1686-1749), patriarch of the eighteenth-century extended family, sent four of his six sons to Yale College, including Philip Livingston, Jr., who later signed the Declaration of Independence. For the senior Livingston, an education at Yale for most of his sons represented the kind of learning as well as prestige he sought for his family’s ascendance into the world of the New York mercantile elite.\n\nBy the 1730s, Philip Livingston, Sr., with his own sons attending Yale, owned shares in at least four slave ships operating out of New York harbor; all told, he and his sons invested in at least fifteen slave voyages to and from Africa. The family’s trade routes reached all the way to Madagascar off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Livingstons imported enslaved Africans directly from the continent; records exist for at least seven ships that disembarked 549 slaves in New York. Their wealth also stemmed from a steady trade of grain, flour, and meat to the islands.\n\nMany in the family, moreover, were significant slaveholders. A Columbia University study found that, by the 1790 federal census, a tally of all branches of the family tree came to some 170 people enslaved by the Livingstons.\n\nIn 1745, Philip Livingston Sr. donated the considerable sum of £28 10s. to Yale College “as a small acknowledgment of the sence [sic] I have for the favour and Education my sons have had there.” Livingston’s gift, one of the largest in the middle of the eighteenth century, was originally intended to finance building projects. However, the ambitious president of Yale, Thomas Clap, asked that the money instead be used to create an endowment for the college’s first professorship. Combined with other funds, Livingston’s gift became the basis for the Livingstonian Professorship in Divinity in 1756, one of the most prestigious at Yale for many years. The New York clan remains well commemorated at the university: at the Memorial Quadrangle, the Livingston Gateway was dedicated in 1921.\n\nWithout such merchant families, the college would not have prospered into the leading American institution of higher learning that it became by the time of the American Revolution. The West Indian trade, rooted so deeply in slavery, was an indispensable element in Yale College’s birth, growth, and eventual prosperity.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nChapter 3 Building Connecticut Hall\n\nConstructed from 1750 to 1753, Connecticut Hall is a prized work of architecture at Yale, the oldest building on campus, and the oldest surviving brick structure in the state. Its large meeting room on the second floor, lined with portraits of Yale deans, long served as the site of Yale faculty meetings. The building is well-marked with commemorative dates on plaques, but nowhere does it record how and by whom it was constructed. Connecticut Hall was built, in part, by Black workers who were enslaved by Yale luminaries.\n\nOne can only wonder if Clap and the trustees of Yale College ever arranged any recognition of the many people, enslaved and free, Black and white, who built this new edifice.\n\nYale’s first president, the Reverend Thomas Clap, had to secure donors to pay the bills and provide the construction materials. He was remarkably assiduous in pursuing both aims. Among eight donors Clap recorded who specifically made gifts to the building of the “new college,” at least three were slaveholders. They included Reverends Jared Eliot of Killingworth, Solomon Williams of Lebanon (brother of Elisha Williams), and Jonathan Todd of East Guilford, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1748, Clap’s construction team, under the direction of Thomas Bills and Francis Letort, began to purchase and amass the materials, which included door locks, shingles, masonry of all kinds, hay, thousands of bricks, kilns, lime, stones, carts for hauling, long beams, joiners, pine boards, nails, “oyl,” “White Lead,” “41 Squares of Glass for Round Windows,” and various tools.\n\nClap was extraordinarily meticulous in his recordkeeping, assembling notes on the approximately twenty-two laborers who worked over two to three years. Some were paid, and some were not. “Jethro’s Gad,” a free person of color, and the son of Jethro Luke, worked 161 ½ days. “Mr. Noyes’s Negro” (named Jack) put in 172 ¾ days. “Theophilus Munson’s Negro” (named Dick) labored 68 days. “Mr. Bonticou’s Negro” (his name as yet unknown) spent 96 days on the job. “Mingo,” enslaved by Archibald McNeil, worked 92 ¾ days. Finally, “Mr. President’s Negro”—that is, one of the people enslaved to Clap himself, possibly George—gave 83 days of strength, sweat, and skill to the job. This record demonstrates that Black workers (almost all unpaid) worked a total of at least 672 days in building this prominent Yale structure.\n\nMany of the white workers, though perhaps not all, are named with their days of labor as well in the president’s “Account of the Cost of New College.” They include Letort and Bills, Samuel Tharp, Samuel Griffin, Daniel Sperry, Joseph Stacey, Nicolas Wood, Abel Wood, John Osborn, Daniel McConnelly, and Richard Cutler.\n\nOne can only wonder if Clap and the trustees of Yale College ever arranged any recognition of the many people, enslaved and free, Black and white, who built this edifice in the heart of the educational enterprise at the corner of Chapel and College Streets. Gad Luke worked elbow to elbow with Samuel Sharp and Joseph Stacey, and they may have spent days mixing mortar together. Mingo must have carted bricks and lifted beams with Daniel Sperry. Dick and Abel Wood likely dug the cellar or fired up a kiln on numerous mornings.\n\nOn several pages of Clap’s accounts, he describes payments for “team work,” a term with no irony in the listing of people and numbers at that time. It took a team to raise beams or install a window or large door. Some days Gad broke from the “team” on the construction site and worked “culling tobacco” personally for President Clap.\n\nThe students, rectors, teachers, and anyone who lived or worked around Yale College as it grew from the 1730s to 1760s would have known Jethro Luke and his family, and perhaps Jack, Dick, Mingo, and other enslaved workers. Do these early workers who laid the foundations of Yale also deserve the title, “founders?” How might we break the silence about their vivid visibility in the university’s archives?\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nInterlude Names of the Enslaved\n\nEnslaved people were part of New Haven and Connecticut from the beginning days of European settlement and of the extended community of Yale University from its founding as the Collegiate School in 1701. The people whose names are recorded here were enslaved by the founding and successor trustees, rectors and presidents, and major early donors in Yale’s first century.\n\nThe vast majority of the people listed here were identified as Black, but in some cases they were identified as Indigenous. Records of inheritances, sales, baptisms, and other events provide some details, such as family relationships and ages, but in many cases, their names are all that the surviving evidence provides.\n\nThis list, although it contains the names of over two hundred human beings, is incomplete. Research has focused on wills, estate papers, church records, and the federal census. Estate documents present an accounting of a household only at the time of a person’s death. Yale’s leaders, like fellow elites of church and society in Connecticut, often enslaved other people earlier in their lives whose names were not recorded in their wills (because they died, were sold, or were manumitted). For this and other reasons, further research would likely show evidence of additional enslaved people connected to Yale.\n\nThe names listed are those given, in most cases, to these people by slaveholders.

As the historian J. Franklin Jameson wrote, “the stream of revolution, once started, could not be confined within narrow banks, but spread abroad upon the land.”\n\nThe Black petitioners asserted “that LIBERTY, being founded upon the law of nature, is as necessary to the happiness of an African, as it is to the happiness of an Englishman.”\n\nIn late 1774, a “humble Petition of a Number of poor Africans,” addressed to the “Sons of Liberty in Connecticut,” declared the case boldly. Signed by Bristol Lambee on behalf of many others, the petition considered the radical Sons of Liberty the “most zealous assertors of the natural rights and liberties of mankind” and asked for help in their own “deliverance from a state of unnatural servitude and bondage.”\n\nThe petitioners further asserted “that LIBERTY, being founded upon the law of nature, is as necessary to the happiness of an African, as it is to the happiness of an Englishman.” They claimed, “in common with other men, a natural right to be free.” Their “services” could only be exerted by “voluntary compact,” they maintained, stating in clear language the doctrine of consent. They had been captured and taken to “this distant land to be enslaved… to serve like a horse in a mill,” and they established, in light of such dehumanizatioun, a right to resist in self-defense.\n\nTheir deepest sense of family, of “endearing ties,” had been sundered; they were “strangers” in their new land. They felt blocked from properly serving God because they were chattel, under “absolute controul “of a “master.” And finally, Lambee and his friends knew the religious teachings of slaveholders. “So contrary is slavery to the very genius of Christianity,” they argued, that the good men of Connecticut risked their own eternal damnation.\n\nThe Connecticut petitioners begged those with the revolutionary spirit against Great Britain to “hear our prayers.” As the revolutionaries of the colony protested those who “would subject you to slavery,” the petitioners demanded they reflect upon their own “unnatural custom” of holding property in man. All of Jefferson’s four first principles in the later Declaration of Independence are addressed in Lambee’s eloquent petition: natural rights and consent explicitly, equality and the right of revolution more implicitly.\n\nBlack people, enslaved and free, did not stop articulating their hopes that the country would make good on the promises of the Revolution. In the 1780s, a group of Black New Haveners, living not far from Yale College, produced yet another extraordinary petition for freedom. It likely found its spirit in resistance to the nature of Connecticut’s long-term gradual emancipation scheme.\n\nThe petition was crafted with verve and passion for the same natural rights and Christian religious inclusion as the earlier document. These people considered themselves “Africas Blacks,” declared themselves still in “Chaine Bondage” and “Cruil Slavirre.” They wanted their “human Bodys” recognized as such. They had “fought the grandest Battles… in this War,” the petition maintained, demanding “Rite and justes” if America was ever to become a “free contry.”\n\nThey felt the power of natural rights in their bones and their souls. The New Haveners, in the shadow of the famous college at Yale, declared their right to “Pubblick woship,” and to “larning… our C A B or to reed the holy BiBle. Simple justice, born of a revolution for human liberty, had rarely been stated so directly.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nChapter 4 Yale’s Christian Abolitionists\n\nYale-trained white ministers laid the foundations for biblically grounded abolitionism in the nineteenth century. One of the most prominent among them was Samuel Hopkins (Yale 1741).\n\n“Rouse up then my brethren and assert the Right of universal liberty,” pronounced Hopkins. “You assert your Right to be free in opposition to the Tyrant of Britain; come be honest men and assert the Right of the Africans to be free in opposition to the Tyrants of America.”\n\nBorn in Waterbury, Connecticut, the Reverend Hopkins came under the profound influence of the New Light revivalists while at Yale, especially Jonathan Edwards. But Hopkins did not merely adopt Edwards’ teachings; he undertook, according to scholars Kenneth Minkema and Harry Stout, a “major revision” of Edwards’ theology.\n\nTo Hopkins, slaveholding was a mortal personal and social sin. He was a staunch supporter of American independence but converted republican ideology into a rationale for abolitionism as well as for resistance to Britain. He became Edwards’ “most renowned intellectual heir.”\n\nIn a sermon Hopkins delivered in 1776, he appealed, as firmly as the latter-day radical abolitionists of the early nineteenth century, to the consciences of American patriots. “Rouse up then my brethren and assert the Right of universal liberty,” pronounced Hopkins. “You assert your Right to be free in opposition to the Tyrant of Britain; come be honest men and assert the Right of the Africans to be free in opposition to the Tyrants of America.”\n\nHopkins was considered dull in the pulpit, but with his pen he penetrated to the heart of the matter: “We cry up Liberty but know it the Negros have as good a Right to be free as we can pretend to.” Hopkins may rightly be said to be present at the creation of moral suasion, the appeal to the conscience and the heart in American abolitionism.\n\nAnother disciple of Edwards forged his own approach to abolitionism in these years. Jonathan Edwards Jr., the theologian’s own son, was born in 1745—a full generation younger than Hopkins, although very much his protégé. Always in the shadow of his famous father, Edwards Jr. was orphaned by age thirteen. While a boy living in Stockbridge at the Indian School, he studied Indigenous languages and was sent to live with the Iroquois near Albany, New York, in preparation for future missionary endeavors. Graduating from the College of New Jersey in 1765, Edwards Jr. eventually moved to New Haven where he pastored the White Haven Church for most of the rest of his life (1769-95). He developed many associations at Yale and delivered examinations to students, although it appears President Stiles passed him over for a professorship of divinity in 1781.\n\nIn 1773, Edwards, Jr. published a series of five articles anonymously in the Connecticut Journal and the New Haven Post-Boy, entitled “Some Observations upon the Slavery of Negroes.” The articles established a New Divinity theological basis for the antislavery cause. They challenged slavery and the slave trade as Christian hypocrisy.\n\nEdwards Jr. countered specific proslavery arguments, rejecting all biblical justifications for slavery. He noted that although God had permitted the ancient Israelites to invade Canaan and enslave the Canaanites, that did not give Europeans and Americans the right to do the same thing to Africans. He also condemned the idea that slavery benefitted Africans by making Christians out of heathens—an idea that would take generations to weaken or die—asserting that religion had nothing to do with why Africans were enslaved. By repudiating the argument that war captives were fair game for enslavement, he took on one of his father’s own weakest justifications for slavery.\n\nThese early antislavery writings would have been relatively well known around Yale College in a year of increased resistance to British authority, although the younger Edwards’ parishioners frequently found him too radical and theologically rigid.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nInterlude Gradual Emancipation in Connecticut\n\nThe name of James Hillhouse, perhaps the town’s most prominent citizen of the early republic, is inscribed across the city of New Haven, including on the city’s oldest public high school and one of its famous avenues. In 1782, Hillhouse was appointed treasurer of Yale College—a position he held until his death fifty years later.\n\nHillhouse himself recorded his ownership of two enslaved children: a girl named Hagar, born on March 17, 1786, and a boy named Jupiter, born on June 22, 1789.\n\nAn astute money manager and a builder, Hillhouse left an enduring mark on the college and the city. Among other things, he helped design Yale’s famed Old Brick Row, drained and beautified the New Haven Green, and organized Grove Street Cemetery, the first cemetery of its kind in the country. Hillhouse also became a powerful politician, serving in the state legislature (1791-96), U.S. Congress (1791-96), and U.S. Senate (1796-1810). As a U.S. Senator, he introduced amendments that would have restricted slavery, particularly in the new lands added to the United States through the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nYet in the same years that Hillhouse was building an illustrious career as a public servant, he was enslaving people. According to New Haven vital records, Hillhouse himself recorded in front of the justice of the peace his ownership of two enslaved children: a girl named Hagar, born on March 17, 1786, and a boy named Jupiter, born on June 22, 1789.\n\nThe children Hagar and Jupiter grew up in the shadow of Connecticut’s Gradual Abolition Act, which gave them only the nebulous future hope of freedom and autonomy. Passed in 1784, the act stipulated that boys born to enslaved mothers after March 1, 1784, would be free on their twenty-fifth birthday, and girls would be free on their twenty-first birthday. Another act, in 1788, required Connecticut slaveholders to register the birth of enslaved children, which explains why Hillhouse recorded his ownership of young Hagar and Jupiter when he did. The Connecticut law was the most prolonged among Northern states that passed such enactments.\n\nTragically, Hagar would not live to experience freedom. Hillhouse, a member of the First Congregational Church in New Haven, had the young girl baptized “in private” on July 21, 1794. Hagar died two days later at the age of nine, and like her biblical namesake, one of Abraham’s wives, she died a slave.\n\nThe little boy named Jupiter outlived Hagar, but only to endure other trials of slavery, separation, and hardship. In 1795, the boy’s mother, Judith Cocks, wrote to Hillhouse, bereft and confused. Cocks and Jupiter had been taken to Marietta, Ohio, by Hillhouse’s first cousin, Lucy Backus Woodbridge and her husband, Dudley Woodbridge (Yale 1766). (This fact alone suggests a disregard for the law, since it was illegal to transport enslaved people outside the state.) Cocks told Hillhouse that Mrs. Woodbridge and her sons “thump and beat [Jupiter] as if he was a Dog” and begged for clarity about Jupiter’s status.\n\nLiving in a “strange country without one friend,” Cocks asked Hillhouse to “be so kind as to write me how Long Jupiter is to remain with them.” Woodbridge had told Cocks that Jupiter “is to live with her untill he is twenty five years of age,” something she “had no idea of.” Cocks further implored Hillhouse not to sell her boy to Mrs. Woodbridge. Even more wrenching, she mentions her daughter Hagar, apparently unaware that the girl had died the year before.\n\nIn this rare document, an enslaved mother speaks directly to one of the most powerful men in the country about her fears, and in doing so, articulates the grief, frustration, and sense of powerlessness many enslaved parents felt. Unable to navigate the gradual abolition law with any certainty or genuine hope, Cocks was trying as best she could to protect her children from the violence and cruelty of slavery. In starkest terms, it dramatizes the painfully slow and extended process of abolition in Connecticut, which made children property and subject to the violence and whims of their owners through early adulthood.\n\nYoung Jupiter’s fate is unknown, but slavery continued in the Woodbridge household.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nChapter 4 ‘Tis Thou Alone Can Make Us Free’\n\nIn 1779, when the British invaded New Haven, Sarah Lloyd Hillhouse was twenty-six years old and pregnant with her first child. Her husband James Hillhouse, a Yale graduate and future college treasurer, was off commanding a company of volunteers—including many Yale students—as they attempted to defend the city.\n\nThis rare find from the depths of the Yale archives can leave one breathless at the brown paper, the slightly faded ink, and the careful writing.\n\nSarah described her ordeal to a relative: “You who have gone through a like scene can easily imagine the consternation this town must be in on the occasion,” she wrote. “However we fared much better than we feared as we expected nothing but to see the town reduced to ashes…the rest of the inhabitants were plundered & abused without regard to friend or foe.”\n\nFortunately for young Hillhouse, she was not alone: an enslaved Black man named Jupiter Hammon was with her at the time of the invasion. “I am happily reassured & have abundant reason to rejoice in the merciful protection of a kind providence—Our old faithful Jupiter happened to be here & was a great comfort to me in my flight.” In the years to come, “faithful Jupiter” would decry slavery in verse and claim his place as America’s first published Black poet.\n\nIn 1786, Hammon wrote a poem, “An Essay on Slavery”—a revelatory work of Christian devotion and moral condemnation of slavery. Hammon was a devout Christian and much of the poem reads like an expression of faith, a prayer for deliverance for all the enslaved, and a praise song for Jesus, an all-powerful and liberating God. The manuscript was a working draft, including revisions by Hammon himself.\n\nThis rare find from the depths of the Yale archives can leave one breathless at the brown paper, the slightly faded ink, and the careful writing. Here as well is tactile evidence of the paradox of slavery and freedom in the Age of the Revolution.\n\nHammon was born enslaved in 1711, the property of a wealthy family on Long Island. Yet well into his seventies, he used his considerable literary gifts to envision an end to slavery and the suffering that African and African American people had experienced at the hands of their fellow Christians. Hammon gave keen attention to his rhyme and meter; his handwriting was strong. He repeatedly references both salvation and America through the metaphor of a “distant shore” and the “Christian shore.” He names the Middle Passage with fatefulness and controlled emotion:\n\nOur forefathers came from africa\n\ntost over the raging main\n\nto a Christian shore there for to stay\n\nand not return again.\n\nExuding Christian humility and supplication in the face of the awesome power of God, Hammon demands that the enslaved and free pray together for “Liberty.” Hammon’s language is King James in style and tone; many a “thee,” “thou,” and “ye” give beauty to the verse. “Tis thou alone can make us free,” the poet declares. In stanzas 11 and 12, Hammon enters briefly the actual voice of God: “Come unto me ye humble souls… bond or free.” After freedom itself, the poem insists on human equality. As he moves the poem with refrain toward crescendo, Hammon returned to the idea of the “shore”:\n\nCome let us join with humble voice\n\nNow on the christian shore\n\nIf we will have our only choice\n\nTis slavery no more…\n\nWhen shall we hear the joyfull sound\n\nEcho the christian shore\n\nEach humble [voice with songs resound]\n\nThat Slavery is no more.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nChapter 5 Eli Whitney and the Cotton Boom\n\nIn 1792, a twenty-seven-year-old Eli Whitney arrived at the Mulberry Grove plantation, some ten miles north of the city of Savannah, Georgia, where he seemed untroubled by the large number of enslaved Black men, women, and children on the rice operation. The Yale graduate had first gone to South Carolina in search of a tutor’s position on a plantation but failed to land the job. Through connections, Catherine Greene, widow of the Revolutionary War hero Nathaniel Greene and mistress at Mulberry Grove, invited Whitney to take up residence at the bend in the Savannah River. There he would tutor and begin to study for the law.\n\nWhitney strove to control his invention as it revolutionized cotton production, the explosion of the textile manufacturing business in the North, and indeed slavery’s expansion in the South.\n\nAfter overhearing conversations among local planters lamenting that they could not grow short staple cotton to any profit because of enormous difficulty in extracting the green seeds, Whitney did what he had always done—he found some tools and wire and experimented. He constructed a small box with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions and wire teeth in the middle. It worked; after demonstrating it to the locals and showing that the seeds in the cotton could be removed mechanically, all around him he saw the potential for “ginning” the crop at ever increasing scale.\n\nWhitney returned to New Haven. With excitement and vigor, he began to make the cotton gins in his own shop and quickly tried to achieve a patent. But he was too late; his idea and model wereduplicated that same year in Georgia and soon other Southern states. He eventually obtained a patent in 1794, but the machine was out of the bag. Through some sixty or more lawsuits over several years, Whitney strove to control his invention as it revolutionized cotton production, the explosion of the textile manufacturing business in the North, and indeed slavery’s expansion in the South.\n\nIn 1790, the U.S. produced 1.5 million pounds of cotton but exported far less. In 1800, after Whitney’s invention, the U.S. produced 36.5 million pounds, and then, in 1820, 167.5 million pounds.\n\nThe number of African Americans enslaved grew in proportion with the cotton revolution. In 1790, there were approximately 700,000 people enslaved in the new United States; by 1800, 908,000; in 1810, 1.19 million; in 1820, 1.55 million; in 1830, 2.02 million; in 1840, 2.53 million; in 1850, 3.2 million people were enslaved.\n\nOn the eve of the Civil War in 1860, when the South produced its largest cotton crop ever and dominated the nation’s exports, almost 4 million people lived and labored in bondage.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nChapter 5 The Legacy of John C. Calhoun\n\nYale College produced no more influential political actor or thinker in the half century after the revolution than John C. Calhoun. He studied law for one year, and after practicing as a lawyer back in the town of his roots, Abbeville, in the South Carolina upcountry, as the cotton boom and slavery surged, he entered politics to stay by 1810. The brilliant and ambitious politician would become congressman, senator, secretary of war, secretary of state, presidential candidate, and vice-president. In his path he would leave a trail of awe, loathing, failure, and collective tragedy.\n\nCalhoun was revered and feared for his genius, but also obsessed with duty and zeal in protection of the “liberty” and the “minority rights” of slaveholders.\n\nCalhoun was revered and feared for his genius, but also obsessed with duty and zeal in protection of the “liberty” and the “minority rights” of slaveholders. He strove most of his career for the failed dream of a unified South. He believed liberty had to be earned and checked by power, and that democratic virtues were no match for the darkness of human nature. The former Yale historian David Potter once called Calhoun “the most majestic champion of error since Milton’s Satan.”\n\nAbove all, through his arguments first honed in the nullification crisis of 1828-33, Calhoun became the principal voice of the compact theory of government, an increasingly rigid states’ rights doctrine first rooted in his Jeffersonianism and with time transforming into secessionism. He advanced a theory of the natural inequality of humankind, based in the widespread claim that humans are divided by nature into laborers and property holders. Finally, and most lastingly, he defended slavery as an eternal “positive good,” rooted in part in the historical claim that African peoples had never created a civilized polity and never could do so in the Americas.\n\nIn his time, these ideas were anything but fringe constitutionalism or lonely historical theories; tragically, they served as the intellectual fuel of what many Northerners came to call the “Slave Power,” a radical proslavery persuasion satisfied only by vigorous expansion and then by withdrawal from the federal union. With singular force of mind and logic, Calhoun advanced this cluster of constitutional and moral positions to such a powerful extent that some abolitionists by the 1840s and 1850s referred to the South itself as “Calhoundom.” As his biographer Robert Elder writes, “We do not have to honor John C. Calhoun, nor should we. But he has not left us the luxury of forgetting him.”\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 6 Dashed Dreams of a Black College\n\nOnly months after a new state house opened on New Haven’s Upper Green in 1831, the city’s freemen—the white male property owners, many affiliated with Yale—gathered for an extraordinary town hall meeting that would obliterate bold hopes for the nation’s first Black college.\n\nThe white male voters of New Haven spoke with in a near-unanimous voice: seven hundred stood opposed to the college and only four in favor.\n\nThe idea had been brought to life by a coalition, both local and national, of free Black leaders and white allies. They considered New Haven a prime location in part because it was vibrant and urbane, had ties to the Caribbean, and was a noted center of higher education as home to Yale.\n\nThe September 10 meeting was held in the State House, the co-capital building that had opened earlier in the year. A contemporary account describes that intense afternoon: “So great was the interest to hear the discussion,” declared the New Haven Advertiser, “that, notwithstanding the excessive heat and the almost irrespirable atmosphere of the room, the hall was crowded throughout the afternoon.”\n\nAt question was whether New Haven would make history as home to the first college dedicated to the education and advancement of the Black race—or whether it would gain notoriety as a city where those dreams died.\n\nThe white male voters of New Haven spoke with in a near-unanimous voice: seven hundred stood opposed to the college and only four in favor. Contemporary newspapers reported that five people addressed the meeting. The speakers against it—Isaac Townsend, Ralph Ingersoll, Nathan Smith, and David Daggett—included three Yale alumni. Only the Reverend Simeon Jocelyn spoke in favor.\n\nOn the table were resolutions put forward by a committee that Mayor Kimberly had appointed. The committee included ten people, at least six of whom were Yale alumni. Opposition to the proposal stemmed from several quarters, but the committee members began by expressing their disapproval of—even horror at—the abolitionist impulses latent in the scheme to educate Black Americans.\n\nThe committee’s resolutions had two parts. The first part read: “The immediate emancipation of slaves in disregard of the civil institutions of the States in which they belong, and as auxiliary thereto the contemporaneous founding of Colleges for educating colored people, is an unwarrantable and dangerous interference with the internal concerns of other States, and ought to be discouraged.”\n\nThus the entire abolition movement, along with plans to open educational and other opportunities to free Black people, was depicted as an “unwarrantable and dangerous interference” in Southern institutions—that is, slavery. In voting to support this resolution, seven hundred to four, New Haven’s leading citizens went on record. These Northern gentlemen of standing, in opposing the college proposal, stood together in defense of the South’s proslavery regime.\n\nOther objections hit closer to home, particularly concerns about the potential damage to Yale’s reputation. The second part of the resolution stated: “Yale College, the institutions for the education of females, and the other schools already existing in this city are important to the community and the general interests of science, and as such, have been deservedly patronized by the public and the establishment of a College in the same place to educate the colored population is incompatible with the prosperity, if not the existence of the present institutions of learning, and will be destructive of the best interests of the city….we will resist the establishment of the proposed College in this place, by every lawful means.” New Haven’s white freemen, including the elites of “town and gown,” were clear: they believed a Black college would be a threat to Yale and other schools in town.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 8 Yale’s First Black Student\n\nThe Reverend James W.C. Pennington’s experience in Yale classrooms provides a marker in the university’s history, now commemorated with a portrait and a room named for him at the divinity school. But it also represents a historical moment—one that followed from the failure, in 1831, to establish a Black college in New Haven.\n\n“I beg our Anglo-Saxon brethren to accustom themselves to think that we need something more than mere kindness. We ask for justice, truth, and honour as other men do.”\n\nFrom the fall of 1834 into at least the summer of 1836, Pennington attended theology lectures by professors Nathaniel Taylor and Josiah Willard Gibbs. Both were among the four original faculty of the Yale Theological Department. Pennington later called this period his “visitorship,” since he was never officially admitted. “My voice was not to be heard in the classroom,” Pennington wrote in an 1851 article, “asking or answering a question. I could not get a book from the library and my name was never to appear on the catalogue.”\n\nHe boarded in quarters given or rented to him by [white abolitionist] Simeon Jocelyn who, though he had moved away from New Haven after its white residents had refused to allow a Black College a few years earlier, still owned property in the city. Indeed, Jocelyn smoothed Pennington’s transition to Yale and likely helped him get part-time work at the Temple Street Church, of which Jocelyn had been a founder. Pennington, who had escaped slavery as a young man, now helped pastor the African American congregants at that church while studying at Yale.\n\nPennington earned an international reputation as an abolitionist and the author of two books, including a first attempt to tell the story of Black people’s history, culture, and achievements, A Text Book of the Origin, and History, &c. &c. of the Colored People, published in 1841. But in the preface to his classic autobiography, The Fugitive Blacksmith: Or, Events in the History of James W. C. Pennington, he told a different, unforgettable story, exploiting the irony of slaveholders and their Northern defenders who repeatedly argued that many bondspeople lived and were “reared in the mildest form of slavery.”\n\n“In the month of September 1848,” wrote Pennington, “there appeared in my study, one morning, in New York City, an aged coloured man of tall and slender form.” He had “anxiety bordering on despair” on his face. The old man also hailed from Maryland, like Pennington. He laid out a batch of letters in front of the minister. The letters demonstrated that the desperate man had two daughters, age fourteen and sixteen, who were about to be sold South. Their enslaver demanded large sums of money from their father to prevent the sale.\n\nOn the following Sabbath Pennington “threw the case before my people” (his congregation). They and other churches managed to raise some $2,250 to purchase the two girls’ freedom. Pennington did not miss the opportunity to employ this story for antislavery propaganda against the “chattel principle,” the idea that there can be property in humans. He made it clear that Black people were fed up with the notion of “property vested in their persons.”\n\nBy the time he wrote his autobiography in 1849, Pennington declared on behalf of his fellow free Blacks in Connecticut that they were also fed up with a certain kind of moderate, paternalistic racism. He was grateful for his Yale educational opening in the 1830s but wrote nonetheless: “I beg our Anglo-Saxon brethren to accustom themselves to think that we need something more than mere kindness. We ask for justice, truth, and honour as other men do.”\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 8 Samuel F.B. Morse: Artist, Inventor, White Supremacist\n\nNo residential college is named for any of Yale’s antislavery advocates of the antebellum era. But there is one for Samuel F. B. Morse, the famous inventor and artist, and one of Yale’s most notorious proslavery advocates of the antebellum and Civil War eras.\n\nMorse was an aggressive white supremacist in an era when that was often no special distinction; he was doggedly anti-Catholic and anti-abolition.\n\nBorn in 1791, Samuel was the son of Yale graduate Jedidiah Morse, the famous geographer and Calvinist preacher. Jedidiah helped spread the conspiracy theory of the Illuminati at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and politically became a Federalist, suspicious of all liberal or radical legacies of the French Revolution. Samuel Morse’s rigid conservatism derives from this influence and background, but he forged his own worldview.\n\nEntering Yale College in 1805 at age fourteen, Morse cultivated his talent as an artist, painting portraits, and imbibed lectures by Benjamin Silliman on electricity and other scientific subjects. After graduating from Yale in 1810, the Anglophile studied painting in London, the first of many sojourns in Europe to forge an artistic career.\n\nReturning to America, Morse created a studio in Boston and later moved back to New Haven where he painted portraits of eminent Yale “worthies” Eli Whitney, Noah Webster, and President Jeremiah Day. Morse struggled for commercial success as a painter, but the young artist always had an eye for business ventures, especially as he entered the competitive world of scientific invention.\n\nMorse made a series of partnerships with some scientists and especially with investors, and by 1837, he managed to string ten miles of wire and test his first telegraph. Soon patent wars and legal battles began over who would take ownership of the amazing new technology.\n\nMorse was hardly the first or the only person to perfect the telegraph, but he surely knew how to take and get credit. He demonstrated the telegraph in a university studio, and then in Congress and to President Martin Van Buren at the White House. By 1840, he obtained his United States patent and was on his way to almost unparalleled fame as an inventor.\n\nSimplifying messages into a system of signals soon known as “Morse code,” the former painter was ready to cash in and transform how people passed information, did business, checked a credit rating, gambled their money, gained news of sporting events, and even fought wars. The “news” itself now spread “on the wires.”\n\nMorse and his associates had changed the world, but the inquisitive man had other keen interests, both political and ideological. His thought was a synthesis of science and religion, of Enlightenment and latter-day Calvinism. He was a technological revolutionary and an ideological counterrevolutionary.\n\nAbove all, he seems to have despised the idea of America as a pluralistic nation dedicated to any goal of equality, whether in law or in morality. He did not believe in the natural rights tradition, nor in the nod to equality in the Declaration of Independence. Morse was an aggressive white supremacist in an era when that was often no special distinction; he was doggedly anti-Catholic and anti-abolition. He changed how humans used technology but rejected most social change and the principles of democracy.\n\nMorse judged abolitionists, especially immediatists, as “demons in human shape.” A more “wretched, disgusting, hypocritical crew, have not appeared on the face of the earth,” he wrote his brother in 1847, “since the times of Robespierre.” The more he considered the slavery issue, he wrote by 1857, “the more I feel compelled to declare myself on the Southern side of the question.”\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 7 Strangers in a Strange Land\n\nThe African survivors of a rebellion aboard La Amistad, a coastal schooner from Cuba, were the talk of New Haven and of the nation in 1839-40. Hailing from the Gallinas coast and Sierra Leone region of West Africa, these people had been captured in Africa, enslaved, and transported across the Atlantic. Then, bought and sold like chattel in Cuba, they had—through an unfathomable combination of daring, courage, and luck—overthrown their captors and seized a kind of tentative, uncertain freedom. Yet in 1839, forty-three of the original captives were imprisoned and put on trial just steps from Yale’s campus.\n\n“Some people say Mendi people crazy dolts,” Kale wrote, “because we no talk American language. Americans no talk Mendi. American people crazy dolts?”\n\nTheir ordeal—years of incarceration and complex legal battles—attracted thousands of onlookers, gawkers, and what might be called slavery “tourists” from all over the northeastern United States. The famous white New York abolitionist Lewis Tappan came to New Haven to help organize the defense and publicity for the survivors, and a cast of Yale characters became involved in the unfolding legal and cultural drama. Over the next two years, the African people of the Amistad would leave their mark on the city of New Haven, on Yale, and on the American abolition movement.\n\nImmediately, numerous legal questions arose about just who and what the Amistad Africans were. Were they slaves and murderers, and the property of their Cuban owners, or were they free people exercising their natural rights to liberty and the right of revolution? Were they Spanish property, seized on the high seas by the United States in violation of Pinckney’s Treaty of 1795? Would this ship’s story and the fate of its passengers grow into an international crisis between the United States and Spain that might itself stoke the flames of the slavery issue in American politics? And as abolitionists quickly seized on the Amistad survivors’ legal case, if a Northern state like Connecticut could “free” captive Africans, what might it mean for enslaved African Americans in the South?\n\nEveryone who worked with the Amistad captives in jail and beyond, including Yale professors, graduates, and students, raved about their zeal for education, language, and human connections. They took especially to maps, almanacs, grammar books, and the Bible.\n\nCinqué, Kinna, and Fuli were often leaders of these study sessions, and the best pupils were the youngest, especially Kale. In their own letters, many of the Africans clearly felt the need not only to describe their conditions but to make appeals to be returned to their home continent, as Cinqué did on behalf of the group.\n\nThey also seemed compelled to defend themselves against the various accusations they had endured. “Mendi people,” contended Kinna, “no lie, not steal, no swear, no drink rum, no fight.” And Kale, one of the young boys, complained with a sense of humor. “Some people say Mendi people crazy dolts,” he wrote, “because we no talk American language. Americans no talk Mendi. American people crazy dolts?”\n\nThe abolitionists, the Amistad Committee, and all their allies greatly feared that neither legal logic nor moral arguments would carry the day before this proslavery U.S. Supreme Court, presided over by chief justice Roger Taney, a Maryland slaveholder. The Africans themselves, back in Westville on the edge of New Haven, waited in agony for news as they underwent considerable humiliation and bad treatment in the jail.”\n\nOn March 9, Justice Joseph Story of Massachusetts rose in the Court chamber and announced the ruling, a vote of seven to one to deny all the Spaniards’ claims, free the Amistad captives, and asserted their legal, if not their natural, rights. Story, who was antislavery but contemptuous of abolitionists, wrote for the majority that the captives were free-born, were illegally enslaved even under Spanish law, and had struck for freedom by the right of “self-defense.”\n\nMorally, as historian Howard Jones remarks, the Amistad decision was a “Pyrrhic victory,” since it clung to the notion that the slavery question only hinged on positive law, not natural law. The Supreme Court, therefore, made certain that this decision would in no way threaten American slavery where it was lawful. The abolitionists who had spent more than a year and a half fighting for the captives celebrated for the moment; they had won the Africans’ freedom and their liberty to return to Africa if they chose, but they had not won a victory over any legal underpinnings of slavery in their own country.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 8 The Anti-Abolitionist Who Bolstered the Sciences at Yale\n\nThe largest nineteenth-century donor to Yale was the fierce anti-abolitionist Joseph Earl Sheffield. Born in Southport, Connecticut in 1793, Sheffield became a wealthy cotton merchant, eventually headquartered in the port of Mobile, Alabama. He inherited some wealth and business acumen from his father, who was deeply invested in the West Indian trade, particularly sugar production and slavery in Cuba.\n\n“… although an outspoken hater of slavery as such, I was the defender of the slave holders from the foul aspersions of the abolitionists.”\n\nBy 1835, Sheffield moved his family back north to New Haven because he did not want his children to grow up in a slave society, even as he owned the people who worked in his house. He continued to spend winters in Mobile managing his lucrative trade interests. With major donations, the merchant established the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale and helped put the college on the world map for science education.\n\nSheffield purchased the old Medical Department building on College Street in 1858, added two wings, and remodeled the entire structure. With a supporting gift of $50,000 more for “the maintenance of Professorships of Engineering, Metallurgy, and Chemistry,” Sheffield made Yale a university to train scientists. He lived in a handsome house on Hillhouse Avenue, behind the school that by 1861 carried his name.\n\nIn the end, Sheffield’s financial gifts to Yale before his death in 1882 reached $1.1 million, a figure not matched by any Yale donor until well into the twentieth century.\n\nSheffield despised abolitionists. He warmly defended his many friends among Southern planters and believed the enslavement of African Americans was a benevolent practice that could never be terminated suddenly without enormous social and economic upheaval. When the Civil War erupted in 1861 and caused great disruption at Yale, Sheffield was among those Northern merchants who blamed the radicalism of abolitionists for the entire crisis.\n\nWhen the trans-continental railroads emerged as a Republican party initiative during the war, he hatched an elaborate proposal to use Black labor to build the railroads through the Pacific West. “By the employment of the emancipated slaves,” Sheffield imagined, “they may be gradually withdrawn from our midst and ultimately diffused through the fertile region of the West… now inhabited by the Indian and the Buffalo; so that in the course of time when these regions shall have been peopled by the ever moving Anglo-Saxon, we shall find the negro so mixed and amalgamated, so improved by cultivation, precept and example, so diluted as a people, that their presence will hardly be noticed or detected in the mighty nation which is to inhabit these regions.”\n\nEven though his terrible scheme never materialized, Sheffield demonstrated the extent to which cunning and racist theory could be put to material ends in the nineteenth century.\n\nSheffield’s political positions in the Civil War era provide a window into the worldviews of many others around Yale, as well as a stark contrast. In his “Personal Reminiscences,” he wrote, “Of course, then although an outspoken hater of slavery as such, I was the defender of the slave holders from the foul aspersions of the abolitionists and often predicted the results which would be precipitated if the people of the North persisted in fanning the flames.”\n\nWhen Abraham Lincoln was elected and secession exploded in the Deep South, Sheffield was “so certain of the consequences, that I sold, at great sacrifice, my remaining property in Mobile. I had always been an ardent old-line Whig of the Clay and Webster School, but when that party began to run after the abolitionists and other gods, for the sake of votes; when in fact they began to run away from their principles, I could not follow them.”\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 9 Heroic Sacrifice\n\nIn March 1862, the Yale Literary Magazine reported the first Yale death in combat. Theodore Winthrop, an 1848 graduate, had been killed in eastern Virginia at the Battle of Big Bethel, June 10, 1861, an early and humiliating Union defeat.\n\n“It was worth a life, that march,” wrote Winthrop. “Only one who passed, as we did, through that tempest of cheers, two miles long, can know the terrible enthusiasm of the occasion.”\n\nBorn in New Haven, an admired student and a poet, novelist, and travel writer, Winthrop was Yale President Theodore Dwight Woolsey’s nephew. Only a few days after the first shots of the Civil War were fired at Fort Sumter, on April 17, 1861, Winthrop told his uncle Theodore that he had enlisted in the army “for the purpose of lending my aid to the great work of attempting to get rid of slavery in this country.”\n\nAs he went to war, Winthrop wrote dispatches for the Atlantic Monthly. In his first, he described in vivid terms the spectacular march through Manhattan of the Seventh Regiment in April. “It was worth a life, that march,” he wrote. “Only one who passed, as we did, through that tempest of cheers, two miles long, can know the terrible enthusiasm of the occasion. I could hardly hear the rattle of our own gun-carriages, and only once or twice the music of our band came to me muffled and quelled by the uproar. Handkerchiefs, of course, came floating down upon us from the windows, like a snow. Pretty little gloves pelted us with love-taps.”\n\nWhen the regiment reached Washington, DC, they encamped inside the chamber of the House of Representatives in the Capitol. Winthrop exploited the irony of the moment in the Atlantic. “Our presence here was the inevitable sequel of past events,” he said. “We appeared with bayonets and bullets because of the bosh uttered on this floor; because of the bills—with treasonable stump-speeches in their bellies—passed here; because of the cowardice of the poltroons… the arrogance of the bullies, who had here cooperated to blind and corrupt the minds of the people.” These images of nearly a thousand men sleeping on their knapsacks in the House chamber would be unforgettable to his eager readers in those early months of the war, especially after they learned of the journey of his flag-draped coffin to New York City and to the honored burial in New Haven.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 9 A Meaningful Death\n\nYale student Uriah Parmelee enlisted immediately when the war commenced in April 1861. He dropped out in his junior year and joined a New York regiment of cavalry as a private because no Connecticut unit was yet available. His letters, as well as his diary, which he kept in 1864 and 1865, provide glimpses of the war’s brutality and one soldier’s effort to make sense of the suffering.\n\n“I do not intend to shirk now there is really something to fight for—I mean freedom,” Parmelee declared.\n\nParmelee had attended sermons by the famous antislavery preacher Henry Ward Beecher while a student at Yale, and he carried into the army as strong a commitment to abolitionism as one may find in such a young Union soldier. In early 1862 he declared his passion for the cause. “I am fighting for Liberty, for the slaves & for the white man alike,” he wrote to his mother.\n\nParmelee believed the constitutional questions would surely be solved by the war, “but the great heart wound, Slavery, will not be reached” without an aggressive emancipation policy enacted by the Union forces. On September 8, 1862, only a week and a half before the pivotal battle of Antietam, the young soldier lamented that this cruel struggle had not yet resulted in “universal Emancipation.”\n\nBut in the wake of President Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, and then one hundred days later with the final proclamation, Parmelee changed his tune. By March 1863, anticipating the spring and summer campaigns in Virginia, the Guilford farm boy turned intellectual soldier refused to apply for a furlough to take a break back home. “I do not intend to shirk now there is really something to fight for—I mean freedom,” he declared. “Since the First of January it has become more and more evident to my mind that the war is henceforth to be conducted upon a different basis…. So then I am willing to remain & endure whatever may fall to my share.”\n\nWith his patriotic commitment to emancipation and Union refurbished, and believing in a kind of redemption through bloodshed that became a popular Northern attitude, Parmelee nevertheless betrayed his caustic, hardened sense of what soldiering and war had done to his psyche. “We are liable to become mere machines,” he complained in that same spring of 1863, enduring endless camp life. “One can make no plans in the army, indulge no hopes in any particular direction, have no independence, no voice in anything.”\n\n“If it were not for that spark of hope which lives with nothing to feed upon,” he “would soon give up everything,” concluded the lonely son to his frightened mother. Fifty-six percent of the First Connecticut died before the war ended; he was increasingly a scribe to the bereaved back home.\n\nParmelee made the final entry in his diary on March 30, 1865, saying he “went out alone seeking intellectual clearness.” After two days of pelting rain, and with spring blossoms of red bud and dogwoods now in full bloom all over central Virginia, the last major battle of the war occurred at Five Forks on April 1. About mid-day, the First Connecticut saw Confederates at a short distance in a peach orchard in full bloom. Parmelee, as was his way, stood up and led his men in a charge as cannon opened up from the orchard. He was struck in the chest by an artillery shell and fell dead on the field.\n\nOnly eight days later, the end that everyone sought came as Lee surrendered some twenty-two thousand malnourished soldiers to Grant farther west at Appomattox Court House in one of the signal events of American history.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 9 Black Soldiers Help Turn the Tide\n\nOne of the most revolutionary aspects of the Civil War was the enlistment of Black men in the Union army and navy; before the war’s end, nearly two hundred thousand Black men, formerly enslaved in the South as well as free in the North, served in both state and federal regiments.\n\n“What we now want is a country—a free country—a country nowhere saddened by the footprints of a single slave—and nowhere cursed by the presence of a slaveholder,” Frederick Douglass declared.\n\nOfficial recruiting of Black soldiers began in the spring of 1863. Some Black men from Connecticut sought their chance in the famous Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, recruited in the Bay State by summer of that year. Not until November 1863 did the Connecticut General Assembly authorize the organization of an African American regiment; Governor William A. Buckingham thereupon called for the recruitment of the Twenty-Ninth Connecticut Volunteers.\n\nThese enactments were highly partisan in the state: Democratic Party representative William W. Eaton of Hartford called the legislation “the most disgraceful bill ever introduced” at the New Haven State House. Eaton declared he would rather “let loose the wild Camanchees [sic] than the ferocious negro.” Black soldiers would only “spread lust and rapine all over the land.”\n\nAgainst such racist perceptions, hundreds of men came forward immediately, and by early January 1864, the ranks of the Twenty-Ninth, eventually over 1,200 strong, were filled. The response was so robust that a second regiment, the Thirtieth Connecticut, was formed at the same time.\n\nSoldiers of the Twenty-Ninth Regiment came from several Northern states, but more than half hailed from Connecticut’s cities, towns, and countryside. Crowds came to watch them over the more than three months they trained and practiced; the sounds of marching feet and officers’ shouted commands, the smell of cook fires, and the sight of flags around an African American regiment were scenes that staid Connecticut had never witnessed.\n\nOn January 28, 1864, the great orator Frederick Douglass came to town for two extraordinary speaking events—one to the general public, another to the Black regiments. The Palladium advertised his first speech, “The Mission of the War,” as “Fred. Douglass To-night,” at the Music Hall in New Haven on Crown Street, at twenty-five cents per person.\n\nThe Music Hall, later known as the New Haven Opera House, was filled beyond its capacity for Douglass’s speech. In this, one of the great orations of Douglass’s life, which he delivered many times, he offered perhaps his clearest description of the war as an apocalyptic, purposeful collision in history, in which “Providence” (God, nature, or fate) entered human affairs and turned that history in a new direction. In stirring terms, Douglass declared a new day possible with a Union victory: “What we now want is a country—a free country—a country nowhere saddened by the footprints of a single slave—and nowhere cursed by the presence of a slaveholder. We want a country… which shall not brand the Declaration of Independence as a lie.”\n\nThe following day Douglass rode out to Grapevine Point and delivered a different kind of address to the assembled troops of the Twenty-Ninth and Thirtieth Connecticut. “You are pioneers of the liberty of your race,” Douglass announced. “With the United States cap on your head, the United States eagle on your belt, the United States musket on your shoulder, not all the powers of darkness can prevent you from becoming American citizens.” He left no doubt of the heavy burden on these men. “On you depends the destiny of four millions of the colored race in this country.”\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 10 Dreams Deferred\n\nOn April 10, 1871, Mary A. Goodman signed her last will and testament, leaving her entire estate, except a small annual bequest to her father, to the Yale Theological Department to “be used in aiding young men in preparing for the Gospel ministry, preference being always given to young men of color.”\n\n“Of African Descent,” it was written on Mary A. Goodman’s tombstone, “she gave the earnings of her life to educate men of her own color in Yale College for the Gospel ministry.”\n\nGoodman, a Black New Haven woman, had worked her entire life in domestic service and as a washerwoman taking in laundry. But when she died in 1872, her real and personal property was worth about $5,000. A church newspaper out of Boston, reporting on the gift, said that Goodman had been a member of the College Street Church and “felt that the time was coming, in the rapid progress of her race and people, when they would require a more highly educated ministry.”\n\nThe university had her buried in the Grove Street Cemetery, inscribing the tombstone, “Of African Descent, she gave the earnings of her life to educate men of her own color in Yale College for the Gospel ministry.”\n\nJames W. Morris became the first Black student to graduate from the Yale Theological Seminary in 1874. His contemporary Solomon M. Coles, born enslaved in Virginia, matriculated before Morris but graduated the next year; Coles was first African American student to complete the entire three-year course of study in theology.\n\nOther Black students were making inroads in the School of Medicine. Bayard Thomas Smith and George Robinson Henderson both transferred to Yale’s medical school from Lincoln University, a Black institution in Oxford, Pennsylvania, when its medical department closed. They graduated in 1875 and 1876, respectively. Between 1876 and 1903, when Cleveland Ferris graduated, at least eight Black students received medical degrees from Yale. This number, while small, exceeds all the known Black graduates of the Yale School of Medicine for the forty years after Ferris’s graduation.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, some observers believed that widening educational opportunity at Yale presaged hopeful trends in the country at large. In 1874, the Connecticut Courant reported that the U.S. Senate had passed an amended version of a civil rights bill. They noted that one of the senators, Orris S. Ferry of Connecticut, Yale Class of 1844, opposed the bill “because the wisdom, expediency, and right of such legislation were doubted.” The editors of the Courant were dismayed by Ferry’s opposition, suggesting that much of the opposition to the bill centered on school integration. But, as a counterargument, they pointed to Yale:\n\n“The battle has been fought and won in New England, and the prejudice was effectually killed here when Yale opened its doors to the colored student. If the new bill shall in the end accomplish the same good for the country at large, it will prove the best piece of legislation of any congress since slavery was abolished.”\n\nTheir optimism was premature.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 10 ‘A Good Story from Yale’\n\nA May 1871 headline in the Connecticut Courant promised “A Good Story from Yale.”\n\nThe article told of a Democratic politician from New York who was upset his son was forced to sit next to Edward Bouchet, a student in the Yale College Class of 1874. The politician wrote to the professor on his son’s behalf, asking for a new seat, “as it was for many reasons distasteful to sit so near a negro.”\n\nDespite Bouchet’s sterling academic credentials, the professional obstacles he faced throughout his adult life presaged the challenges to come for African Americans.\n\nBut according to the article, “The professor wrote back that at present the students were ranged in alphabetical order, and it was not in his power to grant the favor, but ‘next term the desired change will be brought about, for the scholarship then being the criterion, Mr. Bouchet will be in the first division, and your son in the fourth.’”\n\nEdward Bouchet’s arrival as a student at Yale was in many ways the product of decades of growth and organizing within New Haven’s African American community. Born in 1852 on Bradley Street in New Haven, Edward was the youngest of four children. His mother, Susan Cooley Bouchet, was a native of Connecticut; his father, William Francis Bouchet, may have come to New Haven in 1824 as the “body servant” of a student from South Carolina.\n\nYoung Edward, a prodigy, first attended school at his church, where children were taught by Vashti Duplex Creed, the city’s first Black schoolteacher. He later went to the Artisan Street Colored School and from there to the New Haven High School from 1866 to 1868. From 1868 to 1870, he attended the prestigious Hopkins School in New Haven. Bouchet was not the first Black student to enroll in that preparatory school, but he flourished there, graduating as valedictorian in 1870.\n\nBouchet was soon admitted to Yale College, where he excelled in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, graduating sixth in his class of 124 students, and was nominated to Phi Beta Kappa. Bouchet attracted the attention of philanthropist Alfred Cope, who encouraged him to return to Yale to pursue further study.\n\nIn 1876, just two years after finishing his bachelor’s degree, Bouchet earned his PhD in physics from Yale. He was the first African American to earn a PhD in any subject in the United States and only the sixth person of any background or race to earn a PhD in physics. His research delved into geometrical optics and refraction in glass. Yet despite his sterling academic credentials, the professional obstacles he faced throughout his adult life presaged the challenges to come for African Americans, even for those, like Bouchet, who had reached the highest tiers of educational achievement.\n\nWith a Yale doctorate in hand, Bouchet could not find a job in the universities or laboratories of Jim Crow America. Instead, he did what several of his fellow educated African Americans did in this period: he taught in segregated schools until, at the age of fifty-two, Bouchet sought a teaching position at his alma mater.\n\nHis Yale application, dated 1905, delineated his sterling qualifications—six years of Latin, six of Greek, ranked sixth in his Yale class—and described teaching as his “life work.” Bouchet listed Arthur W. Wright, professor of experimental physics at Yale, as his reference. In a confidential questionnaire attesting to Bouchet’s personality, scholarship, and “force of character and ability,” the eminent faculty member recommended Bouchet without reservation.\n\nYale did not hire Bouchet. Over the next fourteen years he lived a peripatetic life, crisscrossing the country to hold teaching jobs in Missouri, Ohio, and Virginia. He became ill and eventually returned to New Haven, where he died in 1918, in a house on the same street where he had grown up. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nInterlude A Yale Family in Slavery and Freedom\n\nDuring the Civil War, a couple named Alfred and Eliza Manning boarded a steamship off the coast of North Carolina with their young son. They found an empty steamer drum, drilled holes in it, and placed their child, John, inside. Like the mother of Moses hiding her baby in a basket of bulrushes, they covered their own boy with clothes and told him to be quiet.\n\nBeing able to raise a family, unburdened by the threat of sale or estrangement, was one of the great distinctions between slavery and freedom.\n\nThe vessel belonged to the Union navy, part of a northern blockade intended to prevent the Confederacy from transporting—and profiting from—plantation goods. Alfred and Eliza said goodbye to John and asked the Union sailors to take him to safety. The ship was bound for New Haven, Connecticut, and the Mannings, along with other family members, eventually joined the little boy there. Many years later, in 1881, John Wesley Manning graduated from Yale College. When his own wife gave birth to their first child, they christened her “Yale.”\n\nStories like this one—of separation and unification, daring and sacrifice, death and new life—played out in ways both spectacular and mundane during the Civil War. And in the years following Appomattox, the country had to reckon with the consequences of a conflict that had torn apart both families and a nation. African Americans searched for loved ones who had been sold away, sometimes many years earlier, or others who had escaped of their own volition when the timing was right. Others sought new opportunities away from those who had held them as chattel, sometimes in faraway cities like New Haven.\n\nBeing able to raise a family, unburdened by the threat of sale or estrangement, was one of the great distinctions between slavery and freedom, and the Mannings achieved it. In another turn, John Wesley Manning, his brother Henry Edward Manning, and Samuel Johnston, their family’s onetime enslaver, all came to share the same alma mater. In time, the Manning family, along with many other wartime migrants, would leave their mark on both the university and the city of New Haven.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 5 A ‘Faithful Servant’ and Abolitionist\n\nYale science professor Benjamin Silliman is honored today for establishing and promoting scientific education both at Yale and in the United States more broadly. More recently, historians have explored Silliman’s status as a slaveholder and his views on the institution of slavery. Few if any, however, have noticed his close relationship with his longtime assistant, a free Black man named Robert M. Park.\n\nSilliman accompanied his Black assistant, Robert M. Park, in a second-class car because he had been “unwilling to disturb the feelings of one who had served me so well, and contributed materially to my success.”\n\nIn the census and city directories, Park was described as a “custodian” and “sexton.” Yet Silliman’s own accounts suggest Park’s duties extended far beyond cleaning or janitorial tasks; he participated in and contributed to the professor’s scientific work. In fact, the elder Silliman came to rely on and credit Park with some of his own success.\n\nIn 1835, the celebrated professor was invited to give a series of lectures to the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge at the Masonic Temple on Tremont Street in Boston. Already well known as a scientist, textbook author, and founder of a leading scientific journal, Silliman was keen to further bolster his reputation and attract funding. The opportunity in Boston was well paying and promised to connect him with even larger audiences. Park accompanied Silliman to Boston, staying for over a month while Silliman delivered his lectures.\n\nPark’s role was not only behind the scenes but out front during the lectures. On March 9, Silliman wrote, “I am well, and all goes well—charmingly indeed,—cordiality and interest and numbers far beyond my expectations. Robert is well and does exceedingly well; he is much admired in his station, and is regarded by the audience as a sub-professor!” Perhaps the audience was able to see what Silliman could not.\n\nThe great scientist may have thought it was amusing to consider his “faithful Robert” a “sub-professor.” But he acknowledged Park’s contributions. On their return home to New Haven several weeks later, Silliman decided to sit with his assistant in the second-class car since, he wrote, “objections might be made to the admission of a colored man into the passenger cars of the first class.” Silliman continued, explaining that he accompanied him in part because he had been “unwilling to disturb the feelings of one who had served me so well, and contributed materially to my success.”\n\nDecades later, at the 1884 unveiling of Silliman’s statue on the Yale campus, Andrew Dickson White—a former Silliman student and by then president of Cornell University—told the story of his old professor choosing to sit in the second-class car. To White, an erstwhile abolitionist, the anecdote illustrated Silliman’s humanity and humility. But he also told another story that perhaps better illuminates the place of Robert M. Park—and no doubt others like him—in Yale’s history: Professor Silliman says to a student. ‘How would I test sulphuric [sic] acid?’ The student answers: ‘You would taste it.’ Silliman, indignantly, ‘Taste it, sir; it would burn my tongue out. Tell me, how would I test sulphuric acid?’ Student: ‘You would make Robert taste it.’\n\nThe joke “works” because those hearing it would have known Park and would have recognized him as a “faithful” associate who stood by Silliman’s side and did what he was asked to do—whether to further the cause of science or because his job depended upon it. Silliman had been dead twenty years when White recounted those stories, but Park was there, on hand to do a job both dignified and menial: drawing aside the veil covering the statue of his late employer.\n\nPark lived a life that went well beyond his job. In the 1820s, he was one of the four men who, with twenty-one women, founded the Temple Street Congregation in New Haven, a center of Black community and anti-slavery organizing. In 1849, he was a delegate to the Connecticut State Convention of Colored Men, held at the Temple Street Church, “to consider our Political condition, and to devise measures for our elevation and advancement.” Black suffrage and increased educational opportunities “for our children” were on the agenda. Park’s commitment to antislavery and social and political movements for Black rights paid some dividends: he lived to see one of his grandchildren graduate from Yale only months before he died.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nInterlude Black Employees at Yale\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, it was still far more likely to find African Americans cleaning rooms or selling their wares on campus than it was to see them sitting in those rooms as students. The war changed much about New Haven, but employment opportunities for Black men and women remained limited. Given these constraints, a job at Yale as a custodian or a “sweep,” as they were known, was desirable.\n\nMemoirs by Yale alumni include perhaps the most disparaging and caricatured accounts of the men who held these jobs, full of racist slurs, dialect, and stereotypes.\n\nSweeps made students’ beds, swept the dormitory rooms weekly, and were responsible for keeping campus buildings clean. For many years, there were both private sweeps, paid by individual students, and “regular sweeps” employed by the university. Lyman Hotchkiss Bagg, a member of the Class of 1869, identified a private sweep as “a negro who, besides making the beds and doing the ordinary chamber work, builds the fires, draws the water, blacks boots, buys the oil, fills and trims the lamps, and runs on miscellaneous errands.”\n\nMemoirs by Yale alumni include perhaps the most disparaging and caricatured accounts of the men who held these jobs, full of racist slurs, dialect, and stereotypes. Pontificating on the advantages of living in the dormitories as opposed to lodging in town, one alumnus wrote that in the dorm he “is his own master. His room is his castle. And if he can’t ‘wallop his own n——,’ he can at least swear at his private sweep.”\n\nIn addition to the sweeps, a cast of so-called “campus characters,” nearly all African American, were part of Yale life and lore in these years. “Apple Boy,” “Candy Sam,” “Old Clothes’ Man,” “Fine Day,” and “Free Bill” were among the itinerant salespeople, known also as “nondescript purveyors, vendors, beggars, ragamuffins, and other nuisances,” mentioned in the Yale Banner.\n\nMembers of the Class of 1868 remembered them as part of their first initiation into college life: “We made an early acquaintance with Candy Sam, who was always to be found, just before recitation, in his place leaning against the wall of the old Atheneum, and, with his dejected smile, trying to persuade us to part with our fractional currency.” “Candy Sam,” whose real name was Theodore Ferris, was blind, and he was often accompanied by his wife, whom the students called Mrs. Candy Sam. A lengthy profile of Ferris in the Yale Literary Magazine reflected students’ affection for and interest in him, declaring his “life more adventurous than many of us imagined. We hope it may long be preserved, for if the Candy Man were removed, college life would lose much of its sweetness.”\n\nAnother confectioner, George Joseph Hannibal, L.W. Silliman (known as “Hannibal”) was distinguished by his speeches, which were as long as his full name. “‘Notwithstanding, even under the most superlative temptation, to interrupt the gentlemen in their studies, I beg to ask whether they are not moved to purchase a package of my old-fashioned, home-made molasses candy,’” quoted Clarence Demming in his 1915 book Yale Yesterdays. Demming said “every graduate of Yale since the later sixties” would be able to recall this speech and remember Hannibal, whom Demming deemed the “alpha” of the “original Campus characters.” Around him others like Candy Sam and Fine Day “twinkled as minor stars.”\n\nOther observers were less generous than Demming and the alumni whose memories were steeped in nostalgia. One anonymous member of the Class of 1868 complained about the “the uninvited and usually unwelcome guests who knock at the college doors,” including Candy Sam. With a less than charitable attitude, this author remembered that freshmen would take up a collection for Ferris at Thanksgiving and that he would receive donations of old clothes from the students. He recalled his “chief rival,” Silliman (aka Hannibal), as a “crafty black man.”\n\nThe students knew little about the lives of these men. A native of New Haven, Silliman had served with the Black Twenty-Ninth Connecticut Infantry in the Civil War. When he enlisted on December 8, 1863, at the advanced age of twenty-five, he gave his occupation as “confectioner.” Silliman served for the duration of the war, mustering out on October 4, 1865, and returning to his work making and selling sweets. It is unknown whether many students knew about Silliman’s wartime service or considered his life outside campus, but it was reported in the newspapers when he died in 1907.\n\nThis excerpt has been condensed and lightly edited to fit a shorter format.\n\nCHAPTER 11 The Southern Club\n\nEstablished in 1890, the Yale Southern Club was a student organization open to “all men whose homes are or were south of the old Mason and Dixon line.” At the initial meeting, the founders decided “no party lines [would] be drawn so long as a man comes from the South and is in full sympathy with the Southern people and their best interests.”\n\nThe same year that the Yale Daily News “joked” that the Southern Club was planning to “lynch” “a n—— … on the Green,” President Hadley announced plans for a Southern tour.\n\nAlthough fledgling at first, the Southern Club came into its own only five years later. In 1895, the club occupied an entire page in the Yale Banner, the yearbook, with a long list of members and a cartoon featuring a buffoonish, stereotypical Black figure. And in 1901, the club took up two full pages and featured a new image—a white female figure as well as two cartoons of Black figures.\n\nTrends on campus aligned with the university’s broader plans for courting the South. The same year that the Yale Daily News “joked” that the Southern Club was planning to “lynch” “a n—— … on the Green,” President Hadley began announcing plans for a Southern tour. The Yale Alumni Weekly reported in 1904 that before the Civil War, about 11 percent of students “came from the Slave states,” whereas that figure stood at about 6 percent in the 1903-1904 academic year. However, the organization of alumni groups in Texas, Alabama, New Orleans, and Savannah, and soon Charleston, heralded “a revival of Yale interests at the South.”\n\nThe alumni magazine looked favorably on the president’s plans to visit “for the first time” “Yale’s far away children.” The tour of Southern Yale alumni clubs would, it was hoped, bring about a “closer union” and “the forging of fresh links of sympathy and of interest.” It was important, they believed, that Hadley was making “a definite and official expression of the fact that the University, as a national seat of learning, tolerates no sectional divisions.”\n\nHadley and his wife, Anne, visited alumni clubs in Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah, Dallas, and New Orleans. The president spoke of the university’s needs—new dormitories, a new library, and “sufficient money to help the University out of her difficulties”—but he also invoked Yale’s broader ambitions. Bringing the South back to Yale, he suggested, meant recapturing some of the honor and grandeur that Southern students had once brought to the college.\n\nWhether due to the university’s outreach campaign or for other reasons, the composition of Yale’s alumni body began to change. In 1908, the Yale Daily News rejoiced that the number of alumni living in the South Atlantic a"
