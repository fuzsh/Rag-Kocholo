After his father was disabled from preaching by a paralytic attack in 1694, he was invited to occupy his father's pulpit with a view to settlement, He preached there about a year, but declined the call to settle. He was elected Tutor and Fellow of Harvard College, and in 1703 was ordained at Ipswich as colleague of the Rev. John Rogers, but removed afterwards to Portsmouth, N. H., where he was installed about 1720. He died at Portsmouth, 22 Nov., 1746.\n\nHis children were Mary, Ann, John, Harvard, and James.\n\nHISTORY OF MONTVILLE, CONNECTICUT., Henry A Baker, Hartford, CT, 1896, p. 383\n\nSon of James Fitch & Priscilla Mason.\n\nLinks"
