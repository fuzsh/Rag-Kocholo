For more information about arrangement within each series, click to the individual series descriptions below.\n\nBiography: Lawyer Nathan Brooks (1785-1863) was a key player in the financial, commercial, political, and social life of nineteenth-century Concord, Massachusetts, and of the Middlesex County court system. Brooks established a presence in town and county before Concord's commercial self-containment was altered by the rapid spread of the railroad and its political importance was diminished by the loss of the county courts to Cambridge and Lowell. He maintained an active legal practice from the early part of the century into the Civil War years.\n\nBorn in Lincoln, Massachusetts, Nathan Brooks was the fourth son of Joshua Brooks (farmer, tanner, and veteran of the Battle of Concord) and his wife Martha. Tutored by the Rev. Charles Stearns, he entered Harvard in 1804, earned tuition money by teaching school, and graduated in 1809. He gained his knowledge of law in Concord under the tutelage of legendary lawyer Samuel Hoar and of Thomas Heald. Admitted to the Middlesex Bar in 1813, Brooks practiced in Concord first out of an office on Lexington Road, later shared a building on Main Street with Sam Hoar, and finally (in 1833) moved to the new Concord Bank building, which still stands on Main Street (the present 46/48 Main).\n\nNathan Brooks married Caroline Downes of Boston in 1819. She died in 1820, shortly after the birth of the couple’s daughter Caroline. In 1823, Brooks remarried. His second wife was Mary Merrick, daughter of Concord storekeeper Tilly Merrick. Having grown up in Concord, Tilly Merrick was involved in commerce in Amsterdam and in Charleston, South Carolina, before returning to his native town in the late 1790s, opening a general store, and marrying Sally Minot.\n\nNathan and Mary Brooks had two sons, George Merrick (1824-1893) and Charles Augustus (1832-1833). In 1840, Caroline Brooks married Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (a son of Samuel Hoar), who later served as Attorney General of the United States under Ulysses S. Grant. Following in his father's footsteps, George Merrick Brooks became a lawyer, a public official, and a probate judge.\n\nThe Brooks home stood at the intersection of Main Street and Sudbury Road, where the Concord Free Public Library is now located. It was moved to Hubbard Street in 1872, prior to the Library's construction.\n\nProbate matters (particularly estate settlement) and the collection of debts comprised much of Nathan Brooks's legal work. In the practice of his profession, he was privy to confidential information about leading businessmen and pillars of the community. The estate records among the Nathan Brooks papers include bills, receipts, accounts, estate inventories, and other clear evidence of the standard of living and financial conduct of such Concordians as Deacon Reuben Brown, storekeepers Samuel Burr, Phineas How, William Parkman, and multifaceted entrepreneurs Daniel Shattuck (who kept store on Monument Square in what is now the Colonial Inn) and Abel Moore.\n\nWhile Brooks was intimate with the affairs of the \"haves\" of Concord, he also exercised authority over the lives of the \"have nots.\" For decades, he was a master in chancery, in which capacity he presided over cases of insolvency.\n\nBrooks also held other offices at the county and state levels. He was a justice of the peace, a notary public, and an attorney of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. He also played a role in some of the most important commercial enterprises in pre-Civil War Concord. He was secretary/treasurer of the Middlesex Mutual Fire Insurance Company, a director of the Concord Bank, and president of the Middlesex Institution for Savings. Moreover, he was involved in the finances of a number of other ventures. For example, in managing Daniel Shattuck’s affairs, Brooks conducted business relating to the Concord Mill Dam Company, a real estate development corporation (incorporated 1828) of which Shattuck was treasurer. The Abel Moore estate involved him in the affairs of the short-lived Concord Steam Mill Company (incorporated 1846).\n\nNathan Brooks was politically active. He served on the County Committee for the County of Middlesex, as a representative to the Massachusetts General Court, a state senator, and a member of the governor's council. A staunch Whig, in 1838/1839 he ran (unsuccessfully) to represent the Middlesex District in the United States Congress. In the 1840s, he was treasurer for the Whig celebrations held in Concord.\n\nAs a party, the Whigs opposed the expansion of slavery into free territory. Nathan Brooks's views on slavery were both consistent with his party's stance and quietly supportive of the abolitionism of his wife, Mary Merrick Brooks, who led the Concord Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society and was an associate and friend of William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. Although her husband's prominent public position prevented his overt involvement in illegally assisting runaway slaves, he discreetly supported her efforts.\n\nAlong with Samuel Hoar, Abiel Heywood, Josiah Davis, and William Whiting, Nathan Brooks was one of the original proprietors of the Concord Academy, a private school established in 1822 in the neighborhood of the Brooks home. His daughter Caroline and son George attended the Academy.\n\nNathan Brooks was a member of the Social Circle in Concord. He belonged to Concord’s ruling class. And yet, he was liked and respected by the humble as well as the affluent. By all accounts, he was a fair-minded man, patient, pleasantly sociable, even-tempered, with a sense of humor. He was a good neighbor as well as a good lawyer. He taught Sunday school at the First Parish, was toastmaster at the annual dinner of the Middlesex Agricultural Society, and provided in his office a hospitable place for both conversation and business.\n\nScope and content: Papers, 1666-1917, documenting the professional, business, and personal life of nineteenth-century Concord lawyer Nathan Brooks, his role within the Middlesex County legal system, and his place in the social, economic, and political life of town, county, and state. The collection sheds light on the financial and legal circumstances of Brooks’s clients, particularly the real estate and financial transactions of those for whom he was estate administrator or executor. The official, commercial, and financial life of Abel Moore is particularly well-represented. (Brooks was executor for the estate of Moore, who was Middlesex County deputy sheriff and deputy jailer and a successful real estate investor and dealer in standing and cut wood.) The business, finances, and involvements in South Carolina and Concord of merchant Tilly Merrick, Brooks’s father-in-law, are documented in great depth. Aspects of the lives, financial situations, and activities of members of the extended Brooks family (including Nathan Brooks’s brother Franklin) and of various Merrick and Minot in-laws (among them Tilly Merrick’s brother Augustus and son Augustus) are also documented. The papers include material generated by Brooks’s wife Mary Merrick Brooks, his daughter Caroline (later Mrs. Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar), his son George, and George’s second wife, Mary A. Dillingham Brooks.\n\nThe papers Nathan Brooks left behind at his death paint a vivid and complex picture of the world occupied by the affluent of Concord (for example, Reuben Brown, Abel Moore, and Daniel Shattuck), those on the margins of economic life (members of the town’s black families—Garrison, Robbins, and Hutchinson—and Irish immigrants), those who endured financial reversal, and Transcendental authors Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott as well. They also reveal the transience of personal prosperity and the wide-spread prevalence of debt and insolvency during the span of Brooks’s career. Concord historian Ruth Robinson Wheeler, who preliminarily processed these papers, expressed disappointment that they contained little information about the social life of Concord or about Brooks’s personal life, but that assessment is not accurate. Both the professional and the personal components of the collection contain numerous documents that individually and collectively shed light on the details of nineteenth-century Concord social and economic history. Moreover, Brooks’s financial and personal papers provide enough information to support a full-length biography of him.\n\nThe best way to determine whether or where a particular personal name or corporate entity shows up in the collection is to use your browser’s “find in page” feature to search the entire finding aid.\n\nThe Nathan Brooks papers encompass a wide variety of material types, among them legal papers (including writs) and voluminous probate records; correspondence (business and personal); financial records (bills, receipts, accounts, and account books); deeds and property surveys; certificates of appointment and diplomas; volumes from the Brooks family library; and some few artifactual items.\n\nThe earliest dated items in the collection are transcribed copies of earlier documents. (The date spans for the collection as a whole and for its components are based upon the dates of the original documents rather than the date of transcription). Receipts throughout the collection are filed by the date payment was made rather than the date expense was incurred. Non-receipted accounts are filed by the latest date on the account. Deeds, when chronologically filed, are arranged by date witnessed rather than date recorded.\n\nThis is an extensive and content-rich collection. Although pains have been taken to provide a sufficient degree of organization and level of descriptive detail to facilitate the researcher’s work, there is no substitute for hands-on, folder-by-folder examination of those sections of the papers that may be relevant to a particular inquiry.\n\nProvenance: The Nathan Brooks papers were, according to Ruth Robinson Wheeler, “neatly filed by years and kept on shelves in his [Nathan Brooks’s] office.” They were later stored in the attic of the home of his son George Merrick Brooks (the present 1 Sudbury Road, Concord).\n\nSource of acquisition: Gift of Mary Brooks Buttrick (date of donation undetermined).\n\nNotes and comments: These papers remained unprocessed in the Concord Free Public Library for many years after they were donated. They were preliminarily processed by Ruth Robinson Wheeler and two of her granddaughters in the 1970s. In 1995 and 1996, they were further processed and described in greater detail under a grant project funded by the NHPRC. Sheri Kelley was the processing archivist for the collection during that initiative. From August 2010 to March 2011, Leslie Wilson refined the organization, arrangement, and description of the papers (processing assistance was provided by Reed Anthony, Bette Aschaffenburg, and Robert C. Hall). Finding aid completed March 3, 2011.\n\nEven though it has been worked and reworked, this is an imperfectly processed collection. Each time processing was undertaken, materials were moved and refiled, making it impossible to know how much of the original order survives. In some folders are found items with no apparent connection to the material surrounding them. But sequences of legal and other documents sometimes relate to one another without any explicit indication of their connection. In the absence of direct evidence that they belong elsewhere, it has seemed best to leave many such items where they are rather than to assume they are misfiled and move them. Moreover, even though many sequences of materials are filed by year, for the most part no attempt has been made to arrange the materials in the file for a particular year in strict day-by-day, month-by-month chronology.\n\nResearchers must consult the finding aid and request specific files prior to accessing the collection and, in preparing citations, should use identifying data for a folder and its content as it appears in the container list (below).\n\nA few items from the old Concord Free Public Library Letter File were transferred into the Nathan Brooks papers at the time of the 1995/1996 processing.\n\nClick here to access the beginning of the container list directly, or click on one of the series titles immediately following for more detailed information about a particular series.\n\nSeries I.

Estate papers, 1666-1864:\n\nExtent: 27 containers, plus material in two artifact containers and one oversized container.\n\nSeries description:\n\nPapers, 1666-1864, for some 135 estates for which Nathan Brooks was executor or administrator. Some clusters of papers treated as estates undoubtedly reflect other types of legal involvement by Brooks than estate settlement—for example, the Bascom & Cole files and the papers of Daniel Shattuck, whom Nathan Brooks predeceased by some four years. Series includes many types of documents, among them: wills; estate inventories; accounts, bills, receipts, checks, and account books; lists of creditors; power of attorney documents; writs; depositions; insurance policies; property surveys; agreements; bonds; promissory notes; divorce papers; deeds; leases; certificates of title; warrants; letters patent; correspondence. The series is arranged alphabetically by last name of estate holder. For the most part, no attempt has been made to arrange materials within individual estates.\n\nSeries I encompasses estate papers for the following: John Adams; Joseph Adams; William Baldwin; Francis Barrett; Humphrey Barrett; Humphrey Barrett, Jr.; Rebecca Barrett; Samuel Barrett; Charles Bartlett; Mary H. Bartlett; Bascom & Cole (business partnership); Henry and Ezra Batchelder; John Bates; Henry Bates; Thomas Benjamin; Heartwell Bigelow; Israel Billing/Billings; Abel Bowman; Alice Bridge; John Brigham; Asa Brooks; Isaac Brooks; Job Brooks; Joshua Brooks; Sarah Brooks; Noah Brooks; Abel Brown; Joseph Brown; Mary Brown; Reuben Brown; William Brown; John Burr; Samuel Burr; John Buttrick; John Byrnes; Lemuel Curtis; Samuel Dakin; Jonathan Davis; Josiah Davis; Mary Davis; Joseph Dole; Mary Field; John Fitch; Comfort Foster; James Griffin; Elisha Hagar; Abraham Handley; Sarah Hardy; Ephraim Hartwell; Lydia Hartwell; Shadrack Haynes; Asa Hayward; Abiel Heywood; Jonas Heywood; Silas Holden; Jesse Hosmer; Elijah Hosmer; John Hosmer; Sally and Lydia Hosmer; Oliver Houghton; Phineas How; Ebenezer Hubbard; Rebecca Hubbard; Samuel Hunt; Isaac Hurd; Isaac Hurd, Jr.; Joseph Hurd; Nathaniel Hutchinson; Stephen Jarvis; James Jones; Joshua Jones; Aaron Keyes; Sarah Lane; Samuel Cordis Lee; Margaret Mahoney; Ephraim Meriam; John Meriam; Oliver Meriam; Charles Miles; Darius Miles; Reuben Miles; Abel Minot; Stephen Minot; Timothy Minot; Abigail Minot; William Minot; Wilson Moffatt/Moffett/Moffitt; Lazzerro/Lazzero/Lazero/Lazzarro/Lazarro/Lazaro/Lazarus/Lazare Montefiore; Luther Moore; Jonas Monroe; Peter Neft/Nief/Neef/Neff/Niff/Nefft; Nathan Nurse; Cyrus Nutting; Lydia Page; Mary H.

Separate deeds and other property-related documents (plans, leases, agreements, etc.), 1786-1856:\n\nExtent: 1 container.\n\nSeries description:\n\nSeries II was apparently created during the initial processing of the papers in the 1970s by separating deeds and related documents of interest from the estate, legal, and financial papers with which they were originally filed. During the processing of 1995 and 1996, some deeds were reintegrated with materials with which they clearly belonged. However, because it was not possible to do so with any confidence for most of the segregated deeds, the series has been retained.\n\nThe deeds and related documents in this series are filed in two sequences, one for property in Concord or property both in Concord and elsewhere, 1786-1856, one for property elsewhere in Massachusetts, 1788-1860 (the latter filed alphabetically by name of town). No effort has been made to arrange deeds (either alphabetically or chronologically) beyond the folder level.\n\nThe following names are among those represented in the Concord deeds and related documents: Adams; Alcott; Barrett; Bigelow; Blood; Bond; Bowers; Britton; Brooks; Brown; Burr; Buttrick; Clark; Cogswell; Davis; Farmer; Farrar; Flint; Garfield; Hardy; Hosmer; Hubbard; Hunt; Hurd; Jarvis; Jones; Keyes; Loring; Melven; Meriam; Middlesex Institution for Savings; Minot; Munroe; Prescott; Ripley; Shattuck; Smith; Staples; Temple; Watts; White; Wood; Wright.\n\nThe following other Massachusetts towns are represented in the deeds and property documents in this series: Acton; Bedford; Boston; Boxborough; Carlisle; Charlestown; Lexington; Lincoln; Littleton; Lowell; Natick; Sudbury; Shirley; Winchendon.\n\nClick here to access the beginning of the container list for Series II, or on one of the lines in the component listing below to access the container list for a specific portion of the series.\n\nSeries components:\n\nFor property in Concord or property both in Concord and elsewhere, 1786-1856\n\nFor property elsewhere in Massachusetts, 1788-1860\n\nSeries III. Papers and records related to legal and other offices held, 1769-1863:\n\nExtent: 1+ container, plus material in one oversized container.\n\nSeries description:\n\nMaterials in this series relate to Nathan Brooks’s activities in various legal, local, and state offices and capacities: his work as a master in chancery (documents dated 1820-1855); as a justice of the peace (1819-1858); his interactions with the Middlesex County Commissioners (1835, 1839); work as an auditor (1828-1829); as notary public (1817-1863); as referee (1824-1854); as a regimental paymaster (1811-1816); his tenure as a member of the Massachusetts legislature (1825-1829) and as a state senator (1831, 1837); as an attorney of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (1815); as a pension agent for Revolutionary service (1769-1844); as presidential and vice presidential elector (1832); as a public administrator (1839); his involvement with grand jury selection (1826); his activities on behalf of the Town of Concord (1820-1858), including the First Parish (municipally supported and administered until 1856) and its Trustees of the Congregational Ministerial Fund; the formation of a citizens’ committee (non-municipal) to prevent petty larcenies (1838); and the transfer of property from Tilly Merrick and William Parkman to William Whiting, Nathan Brooks, and Cyrus Stow as trustees for the maintenance of a public schoolhouse in Concord’s Center school district (1820).\n\nSeries III includes documents relating to the cases of Loring v. Bull, Cummings v. Wright, Blodgett v. Hunnewell, Winchester v. West Cambridge, and Hobart v. Fiske, and a protest by the Massachusetts General Hospital against the Charlestown Branch Rail Road’s cutting off access to wharves in Charlestown and disrupting the operation of the McClean Asylum. Among the Revolutionary pension files are documents relating to the claims of Concord, Lexington, Lincoln, and Sudbury men, among them Ephraim Brown, John Buttrick, Isaac Goodnow/Goodenow/Goodenough, Samuel Hartwell, Isaac Hurd (letters from Henry Flagg French among the Hurd materials), Samuel Jones, Daniel Weston, James Wright, and others.\n\nItems in this series, particularly the material relating to the office of master in chancery, highlight the dire prospects—loss of property and, ultimately, jail—that debtors of the time faced.\n\nSome of the material types represented in Series III: correspondence; writs; warrants; statements and depositions; interrogatories; notarial protests; orders for payment; recognizance documents; a master in chancery record book; a petition; and certificates of appointment.\n\nSome items in Series III overlap with materials in Series IX relating to Nathan Brooks’s political activities.\n\nClick here to access the beginning of the container list for Series III, or on one of the lines in the component listing below to access the container list for a specific portion of the series.\n\nSeries components:\n\nMaster in Chancery, 1820-1855\n\nJustice of the Peace, 1819-1858\n\nMatters relating to County Commissioners, 1835, 1839\n\nAuditor, 1828-1829\n\nNotary public, 1817-1863\n\nReferee, 1824-1854\n\nRegimental paymaster (Third Regiment of Infantry, First Brigade, Third Division of Militia), 1811-1816\n\nMassachusetts legislature, 1825-1829\n\nAttorney of the Supreme Judicial Court (Massachusetts), 1815\n\nPension agent for Revolutionary service, 1769 (in transcription)-1844\n\nCapacity/office undetermined, 1825-1840\n\nElector for offices of President and Vice-President of the United States, 1832\n\nGrand Juror selection, 1826\n\nTown of Concord business, 1820-1858\n\nMassachusetts Senator, 1831, 1837\n\nPublic Administrator, 1839\n\nSeries IV.

Two folders of miscellaneous writs and other legal documents (1813-1857) relate to multiple cases (some involving debtors and creditors represented elsewhere in the Nathan Brooks papers) for which the nature of Brooks’s legal involvement is not explicit. In these two folders, some documents relate to cases in which Samuel Hoar was attorney, and one writ relates to a case involving Peter Hutchinson. (Much material in this series is similar and likely related to documents scattered throughout other series, Series I in particular.)\n\nThere are individual case files (1791-1861) involving the following: Belknap & Foster/Vermont Massachusetts Railroad (1845-1861); Alfred Brooks (1829); the Georgia Loan Office (1791-1857; including correspondence to and/or from Nathan Brooks, Samuel Hoar, Samuel C.

Alcott” is filed in Box 34, Folder 16.\n\nFor researchers seeking papers relating to people and corporate entities not named above, determining whether a name appears in this portion of the collection requires a folder-by-folder examination of materials.\n\nBills and receipts for personal expenditures document Nathan Brooks’s life in incredible detail. Items throughout this subseries reveal, for example: the opening of the tomb for the interment of the first Mrs. Brooks in 1820; the purchase of cords of walnut wood to burn in Brooks’s office; payments to Anne M. Whiting for music instruction for Caroline Brooks (1834) and to Samuel Ripley for instruction for George Brooks (1840); costs for the establishment and operation of the Concord Academy; a contribution by Nathan Brooks to the American Colonization Society (1841); fines for his absence from Concord Fire Society meetings; his purchase of fruit trees via Seth Blanchard from the Shakers in Harvard (1846); and his management of the debts of his brother Franklin.\n\nWhile there are numerous bills, receipts, and accounts for money owed by or to Abel Moore in this part of the Nathan Brooks papers, researchers interested in Moore’s activities should also consult the container list for materials in Series VI (Abel Moore papers).\n\nEntries in Nathan Brooks’s personal account book (spanning the years 1836-1863) may be correlated with the bills and receipts in this series. An 1829 account book lists by name accounts associated with the business partnership of storekeepers Samuel Burr and Moses Prichard.\n\nRecords of the Middlesex Mutual Fire Insurance Company were maintained by Nathan Brooks as secretary/treasurer of the company for 37 years, from 1826. The company’s office was located in the Concord Bank building (the present 46-48 Main Street), in which Brooks also kept his law office. Insurance company records consist primarily of the act of incorporation, correspondence, policies, assessment slips, dividend statements, notices, reports, bills, and receipts, and relate to properties all over Middlesex County. The file of mixed records includes a significant number of letters from Levi Thaxter of Watertown and Josiah Cumings of Dunstable. There are four files of extended correspondence to Nathan Brooks segregated from the run of mixed records—from agents Chester Adams of South Natick, Aaron Keyes of Townsend, Horatio N. Perkins of Charlestown, and John Walton of Pepperell.\n\nRecords of the Boston, Lexington, and Concord Accommodation Stage reflect Nathan Brooks’s responsibility for collecting debts owed to and dispersing payments owed by the company, which was run by Jonathan Buttrick of Concord in partnership with Obediah Kendall. Buttrick died August 16, 1839, and Brooks was administrator of his estate. The company’s property was sold by William Shepherd. The records in these files consist of waybills, bills, receipts, and other financial documents. The waybills list passengers on individual trips from April through October of 1839; Ralph Waldo Emerson appears on some of them.\n\nClick here to access the beginning of the container list for Series V, or on one of the lines in the component listing below to access the container list for a specific portion of the series.\n\nSeries components:\n\nProfessional correspondence (arranged chronologically), 1810-1864\n\nBills, receipts, accounts, notes, orders for payment, etc., 1796-1863\n\nAccount books, 1829-1863\n\nMiddlesex Mutual Fire Insurance Company records, 1827-1863\n\nMixed records, 1827-1863, plus undated\n\nExtended correspondence, 1833-1842\n\nBoston, Lexington, and Concord Accommodation Stage records, 1833-1839\n\nWaybills, April-October 1839\n\nKendall and Buttrick financial records (bills, receipts, etc.), 1833-1839\n\nSeries VI. Abel Moore papers, 1801-1857:\n\nExtent: 4+ containers, plus material in one oversized container.\n\nBiography:\n\nAbel Moore was a Middlesex County deputy sheriff (first appointed in 1812); deputy jailer at the Middlesex County jail in Concord, 1815-1843; a real estate investor; and—in partnerships with John Hosmer, Joel Britton, and others—a dealer in standing and cut wood. Moore was born in Sudbury, Massachusetts, in 1777. He lived in Sudbury, Stow, and Concord. He married Ruth Goodnow in 1801, moved to Stow about 1812, and to Concord in 1814. He lived in the present 343-355 Lexington Road and farmed extensively on his Concord property. Abel Moore was involved in the Middlesex Society of Husbandmen and Manufacturers, the Middlesex Institution for Savings, the Concord Mill Dam Company, and the Concord Steam Mill Company (incorporated in 1846 for the sale of shares in a sawmill behind Main Street, in the vicinity of the Concord depot). He was a member of the Social Circle in Concord. Abel Moore died in Concord on September 30, 1848. Nathan Brooks was executor of Abel Moore’s estate. John Brooks Moore took over the family farm at his father’s death.\n\nSeries description:\n\nThe Abel Moore papers in the Nathan Brooks collection document Moore’s official, commercial, and personal life. They include property-related documents (among them deeds, leases, contracts, several surveys by Cyrus Hubbard, and two woodlot surveys by Henry David Thoreau), 1805-1853, for real estate in Concord and the nearby towns of Acton, Carlisle, Lexington, Lincoln, and Sudbury and (foldered separately) for property in the mill city of Lowell, Massachusetts. (The Lowell documents also shed light on the property interests of Daniel Shattuck.) Moore’s financial papers (1803-1857) include: bills, receipts, accounts, notes, etc., 1803-1857; expenses for work on his Lexington Road home, 1835-1844; and a file of orders charged to the Concord firm of Bascom & Cole, 1828-1829. Among Moore’s business papers (1818-1854) are files reflecting his ventures in the wood business and his association with John Hosmer in this enterprise, 1827-1849; records of the case of Barrett v. LeGross, 1845-1846, in which John Shepard Keyes represented John LeGross and the heirs of Timothy Prescott in a boundary line issue; records of the Concord Steam Mill Company (Moore was a shareholder); four printed notices (1846-1847) and a manuscript note from the Female Employment Office in Boston documenting Moore’s employment of immigrant Irish domestics (Mary Murphy, Ellen Haggerty, and Winnifred Rourke among them); business and legal correspondence, 1813-1848; and legal documents relating both to business and to offices held, 1818-1847. The Abel Moore papers also hold a small quantity of Moore family papers, 1830-1842, primarily financial, some of which relate to the attendance at Harvard of Abel Moore’s son George and a stay in Cuba by George’s brother Henry; Abel Moore’s estate papers, 1848-1856; and an undated recipe for cleaning and cooking tripe (prison fare?).\n\nThe bills, receipts, accounts, etc. among Moore’s financial papers reflect Abel Moore’s personal finances, his expenses as Middlesex County deputy sheriff (for serving writs, for example) and deputy jailer (for maintaining prisoners), and his business involvements, all interfiled. Materials are filed chronologically by year (no attempt has been made more precisely to order items within each file). Receipted items are filed by the date payment was received rather than the date the expense was incurred. Unreceipted accounts are filed by the most recent entry. In addition to true financial records, this section of the collection also includes some items documenting the measurement (extent rather than dollar value) of wood resources.\n\nThese financial materials show that Moore did well for himself and his family at least in part because he knew how to exploit the sources of cheap manpower available to him—local black laborers like John Garrison and Peter Hutchinson as well as Irish immigrants, male and female, some of whom could sign their name only by making a mark. In this, they reflect the economic and social stratification of Concord in detail and sometimes poignantly. Moreover, they make clear that in his official capacity as jailer, he strived for cost-efficiency by buying in bulk (particularly from Boston merchants) to supply prisoner needs. These files document the extensive business that Moore conducted with merchants on the Long Wharf in Boston and his reliance on the Fitchburg Railroad, which came through Concord in 1844, for shipping goods to and from the town.\n\nThose who appear as creditors and/or debtors in these files include: John R.

Ralph Waldo Emerson.”\n\nDetermining whether other names appear in this portion of the collection requires a folder-by-folder examination of materials.\n\nRelated receipts for payments to Nathan Brooks as attorney, business colleague, and executor of the estate of Abel Moore are found among Nathan Brooks’s financial papers, in Series V.\n\nThe papers generated by Moore’s wood business and his partnership with John Hosmer overlap with wood-related items in the general run of Abel Moore’s bills, receipts, and accounts. This section of the collection reflects Abel Moore’s and John Hosmer’s transactions with many contacts, among them: Herman Atwill; Jacob Baker; Samuel Barrett; Silas Flint; Luther Haven; Samuel Haynes; Jonas Heywood; Cyrus Hubbard (for surveying); Joseph Richardson; John Robbins; William Shepherd; Edmund Wheeler. These files include some records quantifying wood resources.\n\nThe Concord Steam Mill Company records include an account book containing Concord Steam Mill Company entries as well as some earlier entries made for unrelated expenses (from 1842 until the maintenance of company records; not taken into account in establishing date span of this section of the collection). Steam Mill Company records also include bonds, agreements, leases, and items relating to the sale of mill machinery on failure of the company. A Peter Hutchinson receipt is filed in Box 44, Folder 2, a receipted bill (on printed letterhead) from pail manufacturer R. Warner & Co.

Tilly Merrick papers, 1780-1837:\n\nExtent: 25 containers, plus material in two oversized boxes.\n\nBiography:\n\nConcord, Massachusetts, storekeeper Tilly Merrick was the son of Tilly Merrick (1729 or 1730-1768) and Mary Minot Merrick (later Mrs. Duncan Ingraham; died 1794, at the age of 64). Tilly and Mary Minot Merrick were married in 1752. They had four sons who survived to adulthood: Tilly (born 1755; died 1836); Stephen Wilder (born 1757; died 1843); Augustus (born 1759; died 1788); and John (born 1761; died 1797). (A first child named Tilly had been born to the couple in 1753, but died in infancy.) In 1772, the widowed Mary Merrick took prosperous Boston merchant, slaveholder, and Tory sympathizer Duncan Ingraham as her second husband. Her son Tilly graduated from Harvard College in 1773, and was in Concord on April 19, 1775.\n\nAlthough he was born, raised, and died in Concord, the younger Tilly Merrick spent two decades of his life far away from the town. According to the brief biography by his grandson George M. Brooks in the Second Series of Memoirs of Members of the Social Circle in Concord (1888), during the Revolution Merrick was “connected with the embassy of John Adams to France and Holland, as an attaché, and was secretary while abroad, and in crossing the Atlantic was twice captured by the British.” In Amsterdam, Tilly Merrick was involved in the mercantile firm of Sigourney, Ingraham & Company (an enterprise in which his step-brother was a partner). Following the Revolution, Merrick moved to Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn South Carolina, Merrick formed a partnership with Isaac Course in the wholesale shipping firm of Merrick & Course. He was also involved in trade with his brother Augustus Merrick, who was established in Wilmington, North Carolina. After the dissolution of Merrick & Course in 1785, Tilly Merrick continued in business on his own. He dealt with commercial concerns in both Europe and America.\n\nTilly and Augustus Merrick adapted themselves fully to the Southern economy. They shipped tobacco, employed slave labor, to some extent brokered the sale of slaves, and owned and operated plantations. Augustus died young and unmarried in South Carolina. Tilly’s finances collapsed in the late 1790s. He returned to Concord and opened a general store, which represented a narrowing of his commercial horizons.\n\nTilly Merrick married Sarah (Sallie) Minot in 1798. They had four children: Francis John (born 1799; died 1871); Mary (born 1801; married Concord lawyer Nathan Brook 1823; died 1868); Sarah (born 1805; died 1806); Augustus (born 1810; died 1871).\n\nTilly Merrick was the executor of the estate of Dr. Timothy Minot, his father-in-law. He was a representative in the Massachusetts legislature, a shareholder in and the treasurer of the Union Turnpike Corporation, a petitioner for and proposed trustee of the never-realized Middlesex Female Academy, and a member of the Social Circle in Concord. He became a temperance advocate. His business in Concord failed to thrive and eventually declined. In the early 1820s, he sold his store and some of his inherited property to Phineas How.\n\nMary Merrick Brooks, Tilly’s daughter, embraced the antislavery cause somewhere around the time of her father’s death (1836).\n\nSeries description:\n\nThe Tilly Merrick papers, 1780-1837, consist of: account books, 1782-1825; correspondence (both letter books and loose correspondence), 1781-1836; financial papers (bills, receipts, accounts, etc.), 1780-1837; shipping records, 1780-1786; South Carolina business documents, 1785-1793; property documents, 1786-1836; legal documents, 1781-1822; Union Turnpike Corporation records, 1805-1814; records of the Middlesex Female Academy, 1806; and a travel journal containing entries for 1792 and 1794.\n\nAccount books, 1782-1825, relate to Tilly Merrick’s businesses from 1783 in Charleston, South Carolina (including dealings with brother Augustus in North Carolina and with Isaac Course in the partnership Merrick & Course), and Concord. In South Carolina, Merrick maintained business connections with Amsterdam contacts, which are also reflected in this series component. Many entries throughout the South Carolina volumes reflect the shipment of tobacco to Amsterdam and elsewhere.\n\nCorrespondence, 1781-1836, includes letter books (1781-1797) and loose correspondence (1781-1836). This series component includes original and copied letters, primarily commercial but also some personal (family) letters. Correspondence reflects Tilly Merrick’s life in Amsterdam, London (briefly), Charleston, and Concord. Merrick’s business associations with his brothers Augustus and John, Isaac Course (in the partnership Merrick & Course), Duncan Ingraham, Sigourney, Ingraham, & Company/ Sigourney & Company, and others are well-represented in the commercial correspondence as well as the account books and other financial materials. The letter books consist mainly of copied letters by Tilly Merrick, the loose correspondence largely of original and copied letters to him. Letter books include copies of invoices and accounts enclosed with original letters. Letters in the letter books overlap with original letters in the files of loose correspondence. Loose correspondence is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, and chronologically within the files for each correspondent.\n\nBusiness correspondence represents business contacts in Amsterdam, Leyden, Bordeaux, London, Glasgow, South Carolina, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Kingston (Jamaica), and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the correspondents represented in the letter books: Samuel Allyne; Abraham Baldwin; Blanchard & Lowis; Nathan Blodget; Blyths & Oldham; Amos Bond; Nathan Bond; William L.

Among these materials are bills, accounts, receipts, notes, orders to pay, shipping invoices and receipts, memoranda, lists of disbursements, certificates documenting payment of duty on a chaise, and bills of exchange. Merrick’s financial papers are organized by year, with no attempt to apply a strict chronological arrangement within the folder(s) for any year. Receipts and accounts bearing multiple dates are organized by year of receipt of payment rather than year of transaction; unreceipted accounts are filed by the year of the latest entry. A list of the names of some of the debtors and creditors represented among Merrick’s financial papers follows, but it is partial, and no attempt has been made to provide the locations within the files of financial papers of documents relating to most merchants listed. Researchers seeking names other than those listed below will need to examine the collection to determine if their subjects of interest are represented. The collection must also be examined to determine the cities and towns—both American and European—where listed merchants operated.\n\nThe location of documents relating to a few merchants has systematically been noted in the container list for the series. View the container list (or use your browser’s “find in page” feature) to locate documents relating to Boston merchant Beza Tucker, the father of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s first wife Ellen; Boston merchant Samuel May, grandfather of Abigail May Alcott—Mrs. Amos Bronson Alcott; Boston merchants Amos and Abbott Lawrence and Kirk Boott ; Concord merchant John White and his successors Hemenway & Shattuck and Daniel Shattuck & Co.; Ammi White (who is connected in Concord legend with hatcheting a wounded British soldier on April 19, 1775); and Concord merchants Burr & Prichard, Samuel Burr, and Phineas How (successor to Tilly Merrick’s Concord store). A few other names are also highlighted in the container list.\n\nAs with his account books and correspondence, Tilly Merrick’s financial papers offer evidence of his involvement with slavery while in South Carolina. Such evidence has been noted in the container list for his financial papers when observed during processing. A close reading of all documents in these areas of the collection may turn up additional related documentation.\n\nAmong the merchants, service providers, and others represented in Tilly Merrick’s financial papers from 1780 to 1798, when he established his store business in Concord: Allenby, Dawson & Co.; John Austin; Isaac Barker; Robert Barker; Ebenezer Barnard; Archibald Bleackly; Blyths & Oldham; Nathan Bond; Samuel Breck; Charles Browne; John Cahoon; William M.

Merrick and Minot family papers, 1731-1858:\n\nExtent: 6 containers, plus material in one oversized container.\n\nFamily history/biography:\n\nDr. Timothy Minot (1726-1804) descended from an early Concord family. He was a physician and property owner in the town. He and his wife Mary (Martyn/Martin) Minot had seven children: Timothy Martyn/Martin, 1757-1837; Mary, born 1759, married Ammi White in 1788; Abigail, 1761-1830; Stephen, 1763-1821; Susannah, born 1765, married Col. John Parker in 1795; James, born 1767, died in Ohio; Sarah, born 1769, married Tilly Merrick (whose papers are contained in Series VII of this collection) in 1798; John, born 1771; and Beulah, born 1773, married Professor Ebenezer Adams in 1807. Concord’s first Tilly Merrick (1729 or 1730-1768) married Mary Minot—another Minot descendant—in 1752. (His son Tilly—the one represented in Series VII—was therefore associated with the Minot family both by parentage and by marriage.) He was the descendant of a Brookfield/West Springfield, Massachusetts, family and an owner of much Concord property. (His multiple birthdates are based on genealogical information provided in a letter by his son—see Box 62, Folder 6—and on information published in George Byron Merrick’s Genealogy of the Merrick—Mirick—Myrick Family of Massachusetts, 1636-1902). His widow married Duncan Ingraham in 1772. Their four surviving sons: Tilly (1755-1836); Stephen Wilder (1757-1843); Augustus (1759-1788); and John (1761-1797). Of these, only the younger Tilly married and had children. Based in Wilmington, North Carolina, Augustus Merrick was connected with his brother Tilly in business in Charleston, South Carolina. Both participated in plantation ownership and management, with all that those occupations entailed, slave-owning included. Augustus died in South Carolina, but Tilly returned to Concord, where he soon married Dr. Timothy Minot’s daughter Mary. Their children: Francis John, 1799-1871; Mary, 1801-1868, married Concord lawyer Nathan Brooks in 1823; Sarah, 1805-1806; and Augustus, 1810-1871. The younger Augustus (namesake of his father’s brother Augustus) never married. He is described in business papers, in Concord assessors’ records, and in the federal census as a manufacturer of “pocket-books,” meaning that he produced porte-monnaies (money purses), needlebooks, and other leather items. He did business with Franklin Brooks (brother of lawyer Nathan Brooks), who was a leather dealer in Boston. Born in Concord, Augustus Merrick lived away from the town from the mid-1830s through the 1840s. Mail was sent to him at Boston and Cambridgeport addresses. By the late 1840s, he was back in Concord. He appears in the Concord assessors’ records continuously from 1849 through 1859, when he evidently left town again. Augustus Merrick was something of a ne’er-do-well. His financial papers for the late 1830s and the 1840s show mounting debt and money owed him but not paid. He declared bankruptcy in 1848, at about the time he came back to Concord. For several years after his return, he continued working as a pocketbook maker. Assessors’ records show that he owned no real estate, but in the early 1850s had stock in trade, which disappears from his valuations from 1853 on. Prone to mismanaging money and worried about the state of his health, Augustus Merrick sought through mediums to evoke the spirits of his deceased parents in the 1850s. In a footnote in the 1904 Centenary Edition volume of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s The Conduct of Life, Edward Emerson elaborated on the mid-nineteenth century invasion of Concord by spiritualism, commenting that its “chief exponent” was a “Mr. M------,” whom he described as “a humble maker of pocket-books in Concord.”\n\nSeries description:\n\nSeries holds Merrick and Minot family papers, 1731-1858. Merrick family papers consist of: documents, 1756-1766, relating to property in Concord and elsewhere held by Tilly Merrick, Sr. (1729 or 1730-1768); papers, 1768-1772, of Mary Minot Merrick Ingraham (Tilly, Sr.’s widow and Tilly, Jr.’s mother); materials, 1780-1790, relating to the business and life in South Carolina of the elder Augustus Merrick (including his ownership of slaves; see container list for more detail), consisting of correspondence, financial papers, estate papers, bills of lading, a power of attorney document, and property documents; papers, 1781-1804, of John Merrick, consisting of property documents, financial papers, estate papers, and Justice of the Peace records; papers, 1783-1797, of Stephen Wilder Merrick; a Merrick family account book, 1768-1793; papers, 1826-1858, of the younger Augustus Merrick, including correspondence, financial papers, insolvency document, spiritualism papers (letters via medium from his deceased parents and uncle), and ephemera. Minot family papers consist of: Dr. Timothy Minot estate papers, 1731-1826; Timothy M. (Martyn/Martin) Minot papers, 1799, 1805 (predominantly 1799); James Minot papers, 1805-1826; Stephen Minot papers, 1798-1824; Minot family property documents, 1736-1810. A single file of Minot and Merrick family manuscripts includes one item dated 1819 and three undated items.\n\nThe Mary Minot Merrick Ingraham papers reflect the Widow Merrick’s role as “administratrix” of her first husband’s estate (he died intestate), the estate papers of Dr. Timothy Minot Tilly Merrick’s role as executor of his father-in-law’s estate. Items in the Dr. Timothy and Stephen Minot materials overlap with material in Series I (Box 14, Folders 3-7, and Box 14a, Folders 1-4). Property documents among the papers of members of the two families relate to some significant Concord real estate, for example the Calf Pasture by the Concord River and the grist mill in the center of town. Ammi White, a son- in-law of Dr. Timothy Minot, appears in some documents relating to property transactions.\n\nThe correspondence (1782-1788) of Augustus Merrick the elder consists largely of letters to Merrick but includes a few by him. Most of the letters are business-generated; some are from or to family members. Augustus Merrick’s correspondence is arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent, and, within sequences of multiple letters from a single correspondent, by date.

Nathan Brooks and Brooks family personal papers, 1777-1917:\n\nExtent: 2 containers, plus material in one oversized container.\n\nFamily history/biography:\n\nJoshua Brooks of Lincoln, Massachusetts, and Martha Barrett of Concord announced their intention to marry in 1779. Their children: Joshua (born 1780); Humphrey (1782); William (1783); Nathan (1785); Charles (1787); Patty (1789). Martha Brooks died in 1792. Joshua took as his second wife Sarah (Sally) Davis in 1793. Their children: Isaac (1794); Sarah (1796); Hiram (1801); George (1803); Almira (1805); Franklin (baptized 1809); Susan (baptized 1809). Educated at Harvard, trained in the law in Concord and admitted to the Middlesex Bar in 1813, Nathan Brooks lived and worked in Concord until his death in 1863. His home stood at the intersection of Main Street and Sudbury Road.\n\nIn 1819, Nathan Brooks married Caroline Downes of Boston. She died March 29, 1820, less than two weeks after the couple’s daughter Caroline was born. Three years later (July 3, 1823), Brooks married Mary Merrick, daughter of Concord storekeeper Tilly Merrick. Their sons George and Charles Augustus were born in 1824 and 1832, respectively. Charles died in 1833.\n\nMary Merrick Brooks (1801-1868) was a powerful Concord advocate for the abolition of slavery, a member of the Middlesex County Antislavery Society and the Concord Ladies’ Antislavery Society, an influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson’s reform activism, and a fundraiser for and respected colleague of William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. For the story of her involvement in the cause, see Sandra Harbert Petrulionis, To Set This World Right: The Antislavery Movement in Thoreau’s Concord (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2006).\n\nCaroline Downes Brooks—Nathan Brooks’s daughter—was a girlhood companion of Henry Thoreau’s sister Sophia and, like the Thoreau children, one of Phineas Allen’s pupils at the Concord Academy. In the 1830s, she also attended school away from home, in Worcester and in Boston, where she was a student at George Barrell Emerson’s school. In 1840, she married Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (a son of Squire Samuel Hoar of Concord), who achieved prominence as a lawyer, judge, Massachusetts senator, Attorney General of the United States in the cabinet of Ulysses S. Grant, and a representative in the United States Congress. They lived on Main Street, in the neighborhood where both had been raised, and had seven children: Caroline (born 1842); Sarah Sherman (1844); Samuel (1845); Charles Emerson (1850); Clara Downes (1852); Elizabeth (1854); and Sherman (1860). Caroline Downes Brooks Hoar devoted her adult life to family and community life. She was involved in the Concord Female Charitable Society, the Women’s Parish Association of the First Parish in Concord (of which she was the first president), and as a Sunday school teacher at the First Parish.\n\nNathan and Mary Brooks’s son George was also educated at the Concord Academy (under the tutelage of Phineas Allen, William Whiting, Jr., C. C. Shackford, and John and Henry David Thoreau), and in Waltham by Samuel and Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley. He graduated from Harvard College in 1844, from Harvard Law School in 1847. He was admitted to the Middlesex Bar in 1847, and joined the Lowell, Massachusetts, firm of Hopkinson & Ames. He returned to Concord to open an office in the Concord Bank building. George Brooks was politically active as a Whig and, later, a Republican. In the late 1850s, he served as a member of the Massachusetts Legislature. In 1860, facing a crisis of health, he traveled to England and the Continent with George Frisbie Hoar—his brother-in-law E. R. Hoar’s brother, later a United States senator. Brooks was elected a representative to Congress in 1869, reelected in 1870. He became Middlesex County Judge of Probate in 1872, resigning his seat in Congress to take the position. He was chairman of the Concord selectmen, a Trustee of Town Donations, treasurer of the Concord Free Public Library Corporation, moderator of Concord town meeting, trustee/treasurer of the Hubbard Estate Improvement Company (a real estate venture) and the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery Fund, a director"
