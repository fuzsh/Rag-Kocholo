Names in bold text have had a Y-DNA descendant Y-DNA tested.\n\nFirst Generation\n\n[1] John Alden was born about 1599.[1] According to Gov. Bradford's manuscript, Of Plimoth Plantation John Alden was \"hired for a cooper, at South Hampton (England), where the ship victualed (brought on food for the voyage); and being a hopeful young man, was much desired, but left to his own liking to go or stay when he came here; but he stayed and married here.\" John married Priscilla Mullins. It is believed they were married prior to the 1623 land division (as Priscilla was not named and other single women were named in this division)[2] The Alden family was one of the original settlers who moved away from the core Plymouth settlement, settling at Green's Harbor (now Duxbury) before it was established as its own town in 1637. He died at Duxbury on 12 Sep 1687[3] and was presumably buried at the Miles Standish Burying Ground in Duxbury.[4]\n\nJohn and Priscilla had ten children (order of children uncertain. Dates estimated): Elizabeth (c1624), John (c1626), Joseph (c1627), Priscilla (c1630, never marr.), Jonathan (c1632), Sarah (c1634), Ruth (c1637), Rebecca (c1643), David (c1645) and Mary (c1648, never marr.).\n\nSecond Generation\n\nCapt. John Alden was likely born in 1626 in New Plimoth[5] and died Boston 14 Mar 1701/2, ae 75.[6] He married[7] Elizabeth PHILLIPS Everill and they had fourteen children (born Boston): Mary (1659-1667), John (1660-1663), Elizabeth (1662-1662), William (1663-1664), John (1663), Elizabeth (1665-1736), William (1666-1669), Zachariah (1667-1672), Nathaniel (1668-1701 m. Hepzibah Mountjoy; neither son ever married), William (1669-1728 m. Mary Drury; none of his sons ever married), Zachariah (1672-1709 m. Mary Viall, only son (Zachariah) only had one son (Zachariah) who likely never marr.) Sarah (1675-1691), Nathan (1677-b1701 unm.) and Sarah (1681-b1701). Capt. John Alden's line eventually daughtered out, so there is no surviving Y-DNA line from him.\n\nJoseph Alden was born in 1627 at New Plimoth[8] and died Bridgewater 8 Feb 1696/7.[9] He married Mary Simmons and they had seven children: Sarah (1663-1738), Isaac (1666), Joseph (1667), Hopestill (1668-1753), Mercy (1670-1727), Elizabeth (1673-1705) and John (1675)\n\nCapt.

He married Middleborough 1691 Hannah White[11] and they had twelve children (born Middleborough): David (1702 m Judith Paddleford), Priscilla (1703/4), Thankful (1706), Hannah (1708/9), Lydia (1710), Mary (1712), Abigail (1714), Joseph (1716 m Hannah Hall & Deborah Redding), John (1718 m Lydia Lazell & Rebecca Weston), Ebenezer (1720 m Ann Whitaker & Rebecca Smith), Nathan (1723 no further record) and Noah (1725 m Joanna Vaughn)\n\nJohn Alden was born Duxbury abt 1682 and died there 24 Jul 1739. He married Scituate 12 Jan 1709/10 Hannah Briggs and they had seven children (born Duxbury): John (1710-1712), (Capt.) Samuel (1712 no ch.), Judah (1714-1740 m Abigail Roe, no ch.), Anna (1716), Deborah (1721), Briggs (1723 m Mercy Wadsworth) and Abigail (1727).\n\nAndrew Alden was born Duxbury abt 1684 and died there abt 1775.

He married twice, first Marshfield 17 Jan 1717/8 Elizabeth ARNOLD Waterman[12] and second, Elizabeth Allen (no children). By his first wife, Jonathan had five children (born Marshfield): Jonathan (1718-1718/9), Anthony (1720 no further record), Seth (1721/2 m Lydia Alden), Josiah (1724 no further record) and Austin (1729 m Hannah Ranger & Salome Lombard).\n\nBenjamin Alden was born Duxbury abt 1690 and died there 14 Apr 1741.

He married Duxbury 26 Feb 1727/8 Sarah Sprague and they had eight children (born Duxbury): Rebecca (1730), Sarah (1731), John (1733/4 unm.), Alice (1735), Samuel (1737 m Abigail Sylvester), Ichabod (1739 m Mary Wakefield), Alethea (1734) and Abigail (1750). Capt. Samuel Alden's line eventually daughtered out so there are no living Y-DNA descendants.\n\n↑ Deposed 6 Jul 1682, aged 83 and \"lived 88 years\" (died 12 Sep 1687). If both are accurate, then he was born between Jul-Sep 1599.\n\n↑ Some sources state they were married 12 May 1622 but the source for this date is not known.\n\n↑ MD 2:64, 3:110, 9:129\n\n↑ This was the only town cemetery at this time. It is remotely possible John & Priscilla may have been buried on their family farm. The Alden Kindred of America erected a memorial marker for him at the cemetery which bears the following inscription: \"Near here lyes ye body of Mr. John Alden who died in Duxbury Sept ye 12, 1687 Aged Near 88 years; erected by the Alden Kindred of America 1930, being one of the last surviving Mayflower Passengers.\"\n\n↑ He was named at the bottom of his family grouping in the May 1627 land division, so he was likely born shortly before this date. His gravestone states he died \"Aged 75 Years (on) March (broken) 1701/2. This would make him born about 1626.\n\n↑ MD 6:193\n\n↑ Mayflower Increasings:2 states John married twice, first Elizabeth ____ who had one child (Mary) and second, Boston 1 Apr 1660 Elizabeth Phillips (MD 34:176) who was the mother of the rest of John's children.\n\n↑ He was not named in the cattle division dated 22 May 1627, but was named in the 1643 Able to Bear Arms list, so he was then at least 16 years old. Also, the Alden family was granted 100 acres in Jan 1627/8, with 20 acres per family member. Alden Kindred website\n\n↑ MD 6:71, 73\n\n↑ His gravestone states he died \"February ye 14th 1697[/8] in ye 66th year of his age\" (that is to say age 65).\n\n↑ Descended from Thomas White of Weymouth, and not known to be related to Mayflower Passenger William White.\n\n↑ Elizabeth was widow of Anthony Waterman.\n\nDNA Results R1b-FTC62332\n\nPrevious testing\n\nThe Mayflower DNA Project contains three patrilineal (all male line) descendants of John Alden. FTDNA has only predicted where the family falls under the R-M269 Haplogroup. Plugging in the 67 Y-STRs in the Nevgen Y-DNA Haplogroup Predictor gives a result of either U152 or DF-27.[1] The three individuals tested have a number of STR marker differences between them. The number of mutations are to the point where they are not consistently showing up as a DNA match using the STR markers (12/25/37/67/111). It is only through the confirmation of the haplogroup assignment from the Big Y testing where we can validate these individuals descend from John Alden.\n\nNext Generation Sequence testing\n\nTwo of the three individuals have upgraded their Y-DNA tests to the Big Y-700. The tests determined the family falls under R-P312>>U152>L2>DF103>FGC8158>FT21550>Y48952>FTC62332. Additional testing of Y-DNA descendants may discover subclades for descendants of John Alden.\n\n↑ Both Haplogroups fall under the STR based clade of Z38841.\n\nRelated Families\n\nThe following families married daughters of John Alden.[1]\n\nWilliam Pabodie[2] married Elizabeth Alden\n\nJohn Bass married Ruth Alden\n\nThomas Delano married Rebecca Alden\n\n↑ Each of these individuals had brothers who also lived in Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies.\n\n↑ surname later morphed into Peabody\n\nReferences and External Resources\n\nWoodworth-Barnes, Esther Littleford, edited by Alicia Crane Williams, Mayflower Families Through Five Generations, vol. 16 Alden General Society of Mayflower Descendants, Plymouth, MA.
