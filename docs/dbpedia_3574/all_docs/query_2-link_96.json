He resided in Sussex County, New Jersey during the greater part of his life. He owned a farm but lived mainly by his trade which was that of a silversmith. This is from an 1873 book entitled \"The Symmes Memorial\" by John Vinton Adams who a was member for life of the New England Genealogical Society, corresponding member of the Maine Historical Society, of the Buffalo Historical Society, and of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.\n\n[This message has been edited by bascall (edited 06-04-2008).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nwev\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 4121\n\nRegistered: Apr 99\n\nposted 06-04-2008 12:05 PM Please bear in mind that many, if not most of these family histories from the 19th and early 20th century contain a large portion of fantasy mixed in with the facts. They seldom allowed reality to stand in the way of romantic speculation. Reviving such notions without review or research only serves to muddy the waters and we already have an ocean full thanks to the Kovels.\n\nAside from this single unsubstantiated claim, there is no indication that Timothy Symmes was ever engaged in silver work. He was a prosperous farmer and served various terms as judge of Sussex County NY, before joining his brother and fellow judge, John, in Ohio. The evidence for his son, Celedon's trade is only a shade better -- a spoon mold, supposedly his, given to the Cincinnati Historical Society by a descendant.\n\nI would be very interested to hear of anything more substantial that documents his career.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nbascall\n\nPosts: 1629\n\nRegistered: Nov 99\n\nposted 06-04-2008 01:02 PM Your point will be kept in mind. As a rule even authors of genealogical works do point out family myths, but there is no question that these stories do get blown out of proportion and may be riddled with errors. Histories written one hundred years or so after the fact are bound to be difficult. On the plus side for nineteenth century historians, there may at times still be people with first hand knowledge of some of the information that gets recorded.\n\nVinton mentions Daniel Symmes brother William also being trained by his father and becoming a silversmith for a time. It's just a point of discussion and maybe at times there is other information to corroborate such statements.\n\nVinton traces his own family to Braintree, Massachusetts and Josiah Vinton a silversmith who married Anne Adams of the Quincy Adamses. Also only mentioned for discussion sake.\n\n[This message has been edited by bascall (edited 06-04-2008).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nbascall\n\nPosts: 1629\n\nRegistered: Nov 99\n\nposted 09-28-2009 02:02 AM\n\nquote: Originally posted by wev:\n\nOne of the secondary delights in my research into American silversmiths is the rich invention when it came to names in the 18th and 19th century.

Fitch of course had been in the Norfolk area and Welch Mount Pleasant which is now part of West Virginia.\n\nIn 1870 the pair was in New Haven,Connecticut. Each in\n\nhis own household as was an eighty-five year old Benedict Burwell without Dolly but with a daughter named Carolyn. There was also an eighty-two year Huldah Welch in Benedict's household at this time.\n\nClearly, Fitch and Welch's father did not die in 1863. More likely their mother did though, and Benedict was the one who died in 1874.\n\n[This message has been edited by bascall (edited 10-02-2009).]\n\nIP: Logged"
