        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 18 Aug 2023 | Created 27 Jan 2011\n\nThis page has been accessed 5,257 times.\n\nBiography\n\nJames Fitch (Jr.) was born on 2 Aug 1649 at Saybrook, Connecticut. His parents were James Fitch and Abigail Whitfield. He passed away on November 10, 1727 at Cantebury, Connecticut.\n\nHis first marriage, which was to Elizabeth Mason, ocurred in January 1676. He married second Alice Bradford on May 8, 1687 in Norwich, Connecticut.\n\nSome of the children born to the second marriage were Abigail, Ebenezer, Daniel, and Lucy Fitch. There were eight in all.\n\nHe was dubbed \"Black Jack\" by some, and, according to contemporary quotations, was the author of \"open and scandalous villanies\" and \"a great land pirate.\" In 1680 and again in 1684, he persuaded Owaneco, son of Uncas and a sachem of the Mohegans, to accept him as guardian and to vest title of Quinebaug County -- some one million acres -- in himself. In 1686, he sold 15,100 acres of this land for 30 lbs. to form the town of Pomfret, Windham Co., CT. In 1687 he received more land from Owaneco, comprising parts of Plainfield and Canterbury (both Windham Co., CT), the latter being a town he founded and to which he removed in 1697. As one of Joshua's legatees (Joshua was the Christian name of Attawanhood, brother of Owaneco), James obtained 5000 acres in Windham and Willimantic in Windham Co., and Mansfield in Tolland Co. By 1698, when his enemy, Major Fitz John Winthrop, became governor, James Jr. lost his seat on the Council, to which he had been elected in 1680. Because of the questionable validity of all the Indian grants, he was accused of being \"exceedingly busy selling the lands of this colony.\"\n\nOn 9 April 1704, \"Maj. James Fitch being guilty of drunkenness made public confession thereof and was reconciled to ye Church.\" In 1717, the Council issued a warrant for his arrest. In response he wrote \"I do freely confess that I have acted very indiscreetly and disrespectfully to his honor the Governor (and) am heartily sorry and condemn myself therefore.\" He then retired to his home in Canterbury, where he died ten years later.\n\nOn the credit side of the ledger, James was an early patron of Yale College, to which he gave the glass and nails for its first edifice and in 1701 gave an endowment of 637 acres of land, which ensured its permanent establishment. He is memorialized in an archway there (Fitch Gateway in the Harkness Quadrangle). He served in the army, rising during the King Philip's War to the rank of Major. He was also, at one time, a magistrate in New London, CT, though even in that role, not without controversy (one time he apparently fined three men on the basis of a grand jury indictment, without bothering to wait for a trial).\n\nHis gravestone reads: \"Here lies the body of Majr. James Fitch, Esqr, son of ye Revd. Mr. James Fitch Pastor first of Saybrook then of Norwch. He was born at Saybrook 1647 He was very useful in his Military & in his Magistracy to which he was chosen & served successively many years to ye Great Acceptance & advantage of his Country being a Gentleman of Good Parts & very forward to Promote ye Civil and Religious interest of it. He died Novr 10 1727 Aged 80.\"\n\nSources\n\nVital Records of Saybrook, 1647-1834 (Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford, 1952) Page 4\n\nDescendants of the Rev. James Fitch, Vol. 1, by John T.
