        "text": "The notes that follow document various individuals named Du Gu, Dugu, Dugue, and Duque who have been recorded in the Charleston, SC, and Kingston, Jamaica, areas by 1750. There is substantial evidence that most constitute a single family. The Dugus were Huguenots, and are documented in the St. Julien and Gaillard lists.\n\nResearch on this family has produced documentation of a family history with an unusual twist. Normally the women of a family are the most difficult to trace. In this case, the women of the Dugu family married individuals who were prominent in South Carolina, and their descendants have been amply documented for many years. In contrast, the two sons of Jacques Dugu who survived to have sons of their own, Pierre (Peter) and Isaac, lived for many years in Jamaica, where they seem to have encountered serious difficulties, especially in the catastrophic year 1722. When sons of Isaac and perhaps Peter as well returned to South Carolina, shortly after the death of Isaac Dugue, most of them (but not all) did so under the spelling Duke rather than Dugue.\n\nThere are a few individuals identified as ÒDukeÓ in the early South Carolina lowcountry who are hard to place. They might or might not be from the Dugu family. However, for at least five individuals (Joseph Duke of Orangeburg, James Dugue of Charleston, Thomas Goodman Duke of St. Thomas and St. Denis Parish, William Duke of Christ Church Parish, and Benjamin Duke of Prince Frederick Parish) the evidence is strong. One author has been found who had already recognized that the early Duke family of South Carolina was of Huguenot descent, in an inventory of South Carolina grants to Huguenots.\n\nThe following summary documents the early years of this family, beginning with a review of existing published summaries and continuing with new research in primary documents. Continuing associations between the Dugus (under their various spellings) and other families from the Charleston area are important in tracing the continuity in this family as they spread out in the 1730Õs through 1750Õs.\n\nThe following listings were found on Geneanet for the Dugue family in Buzancais, 36, Dept. Indre, Region Centre:\n\n1. Claude Dugue & 1668 Germain PHELIPPES (submitted by Francois.louzeau@free.fr)\n\nThe following family record was found on Geneanet (http://gw.geneanet.org/msauvegrain). The location is in Centre, and thus near Besance (Buzanais, Dept. Indre Region Centre), the point of origin of the South Carolina family, and the names Jacques and Pierre are held in common:\n\nJacques Dugu\n\n¥ N avant 1694\n\n¥ Dcd\n\nParents\n\n◦ Pierre Dugu /1643-/1722\n\n¥ Marie Maslard ca 1694-1771\n\nMariages et enfants\n\n¥ Mari le 19 avril 1715, Sceaux-du-Gtinais, 45490,Loiret,Centre,FRANCE,, avec Marie Harlault ca 1696-1730, dont\n\n¥ Hlne ca 1719-1772\n\nThere is also:\n\nThomasse Dugu\n\n¥ Ne vers 1590 - Beaune-la-Rolande,45340,Loiret,Centre,FRANCE,\n\n¥ Dcde aprs 1644 - Juranville,45340,Loiret,Centre,FRANCE,\n\nMariages et enfants\n\n◦ Marie avant 1606, Beaune-la-Rolande,45340,Loiret,Centre,FRANCE,, avec Jean Penot /1587-1624/1639, dont\n\n¥ Antoine 1611-1666\n\n◦ Marie le 31 juillet 1639, Beaune-la-Rolande,45340,Loiret,Centre,FRANCE,, avec Sbastien Henry /1590-1650/\n\nThe database includes:\n\n1.\n\no Barbe ca 1590-1661 &ca 1610 Jacques Miguet ca 1585-1644/1661\n\n2.\n\no Eloy /1580 &/1601 Margueritte Colinet /1584\n\no Charles /1602 &1623 Jeanne Courreau /1601\n\no Toussine /1638 &1655 Jean Gouron /1634\n\n3.\n\no Franois /1603-1634/1639 &1623 Marie Pesty 1606-1672\n\n4.\n\no Jeanne /1575-1609 &/1592 Michel Mestier /1571-1616\n\n5.\n\no Jeanne ca 1593-1673 &/1621 Marc Gommier /1600-1673/\n\n6.\n\no Louise /1658 &1677 Pierre Gagnon /1656-/1699\n\n7.\n\no Marie /1687-1734/1777 &1700/1707 Franois Morillon 1682-1716\n\no Marie /1687-1734/1777 &1716/ Antoine Legroux /1696-1734/\n\n8.\n\no Marie Jeanne 1665-1704 &1683 Jean Pesty 1654-1713\n\n9.\n\no Martine /1576-1637/ &/1593 Jean Rapine /1572-/1637\n\n10.\n\no Pierre /1643-/1722 &1718 Marie Maslard ca 1694-1771\n\no Jacques /1694 &1715 Marie Harlault ca 1696-1730\n\no Hlne ca 1719-1772 &1740 Joseph Cossat 1708-1774\n\n11.\n\no Thomasse ca 1590-1644/ &/1606 Jean Penot /1587-1624/1639\n\no Thomasse ca 1590-1644/ &1639 Sbastien Henry /1590-1650/\n\nThe Dugu family arrived in South Carolina in 1685, following revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Members of the Dugu family appear in both the St. Julien and Gaillard lists of Huguenot settlers in South Carolina.\n\nThe St. Julien List:\n\n15. PIERRE DUGU, Isaac Dugue, son frre, et lizabeth Dugu, leur s¾ur, nz  Bsance en Bery, enfans de Jacques Dugu et d'lizabet Dupuy.\n\nÒBesanceÓ appears as ÒBuzancoisÓ on the Cassini maps of historic France, immediately south of St. Etienne on the Indres River.\n\nPreviously Published Dugu Family Summaries\n\nSeveral very brief summaries of the Dugu family history in South Carolina have been published.\n\nSt. Julien Childs\n\nThe Dugu family and its connections are discussed by St. Julien Childs in his history of the Petit-Gurard Colony, which immigrated in 1679/80. Childs reports that Jacques Dugu and his families emigrated later, in 1685, but were associated with the Fleury family in the earlier Petit-Gurard group. Jacques Dugu first married Judith Soupzmain, Soubmain, or Soumin, and second Elizabeth de Puy. His son, James, married Marianne Fleury de la Plaine, born in Paris and daughter of Abraham Fleury de la Plaine. They were among the settlers on the Richmond. By 17 Jan 1695/96 Marianne Dugu was a widow with one child born in South Carolina, Jacques Dugu II having died. She remarried to Peter Bacot, and her daughter Marianne married Tobias Fitch.\n\nRev. Paul Trapier\n\nA 1953 article by the Rev. Paul Trapier expands upon and clarifies some of these relationships. According to Trapier, Jacques Dugu escaped to England by 17 Apr 1685, when he purchased 500 acres of land in South Carolina. He was there at his land on New Town (Newtown) Creek in the same year. His wife, Elizabeth Du Puy Dugu, is said to have been a fugitive and was concealed in a hogshead marked ÒPoterieÓ and then conveyed on board the vessel in which she reached America. Trapier identifies the oldest children – Jacques (who predeceased him), Judith, and Marie, as childen of DuguÕs first wife, Judith Soumin. The others – Pierre, Isaac, and Elizabeth – he identifies as children of Elizabeth Du Puy Dugu. Trapier confirms that Elizabeth married Paul Trapier, Judith married Samuel DuBourdieu, and Mary married James Du Bosc (Dubose). The five oldest children were born in Bsance in Berri, France.\n\nExcerpts from Rev. TrapierÕs diary indicate that Paul Trapier, son of Paul Trapier and Elizabeth Dugu, married Magdalen Horry. Their son Paul married Elizabeth Foissin.\n\nVirginia Gourdin\n\nGourdin gives another brief survey of the Dugu family in her history of the Chardon family. She states that Jacques DuguÕs first land was on James Island, but he was soon acquiring town lots in Charleston. He paid for a 500-acre tract on the northwest side of New Town Creek on James Island on 31 Mar 1683, but the warrant is dated 14 Apr 1685. Gourdin proposes that Judith Soumin was the mother of Judith and probably of Jacques, Jr., and Marie, while Elizabeth Dupuy was the mother of Pierre, Isaac and Elizabeth. She also states that his son James may have gone to Goose Creek after marrying Marianne Fleury (but see the later discussion of questions about James Dugu of Goose Creek). A James Dugu witnessed the will of Anthoine Prudhomme, dated July 1695, along with ÒPrioleau, de la Plaine, Boisseau, I. Fleury, Eli Horry, and Porcher.Ó She notes that his daughter Marianne married Pierre Bacot Jr., of Goose Creek.\n\nGourdin observes that ÒSome are unhappy about not finding the two Jacques Dugus in the St. Julien Liste,Ó which is a list of migrs recorded as requesting naturalization about 1694 or 1695 or 1696. She states that by 1696 the two Jacques Dugus had Òsailed here, settled here, been buried here, and no longer cared about this worldÕs laws.Ó She discusses the well-documented settlement of the Jacques Dugu I estate and its record of the disposition of his Charleston town lots as evidence of the children of Jacques Dugu Sr. She also indicates that Isaac and Peter were Òlater shipwrights in Jamaica.Ó No citation is provided for this information, but recent research in Jamaican parish registers has now established the outlines of the history of the family there as well.\n\nThe Documentary Evidence for the Dugue Family\n\nJacques (James) Dugu\n\nDugu appears in some records as Jacques and in some as the Anglicized version, James.\n\nThe family of Jacques Dugu appears in the records of lÕEglise de Threadneedle Street, London, where they presented their tmoignages, or certificates verifying that they were genuine Huguenots, with the names of the congregation or individual from whom the tmoignage came. The Dugu entries are as follows:\n\náDu Gue, Jean. T. Charenton, 4 Feb 1782\n\náJaques. T. Mr Amonnet, 5 Sep 1683\n\náJaques: sa fem.: Jaques, son fils, & Judith Soumin. T. Wansworth. 26 Nov 1684.\n\nThe Jean Dugu above is not known to have traveled to South Carolina, but Jacques and his son Jacques were in South Carolina by 1685. The Threadneedle St. record indicates that Judith Soumin was the mother of the oldest boy, Jacques, Jr. ÒSa femÓ at this time was presumably Elizabeth Dupuy Dugu.\n\nIt was recorded that Ò . . . On April 14, 1685, James Dugue bought 500 acres in London for £25.38 A day later Isaac Lejay and Magdalen Fleury (alias Lejay) his wife, bought 500 acres, at the same price.Ó (By 1757 a portion of this property was sold by Thomas Rivers, Jr. of St. Andrews Parish to George Sheed, after passing through several conveyances since the original grant to Jacques Dugu. )\n\nThe Newtown Creek, James Island, property was to remain at least partially in Dugu family hands through at least 1733. Some of the Newtown Creek landowners are especially significant in Dugue/Duke history, are documented in this summary and in the file of ÒAssociated Families, Charleston.Ó Briefly, they include the Davis, Tucker, Ash, Maverick, and Hearn families. All of these families were closely associated with the Dugu and Duke families in the Charleston area and in Orangeburg.\n\nOn 15 Oct 1686 ____ Dugue swore allegiance to King James. Others who swore allegiance on the same day were Jod. Oldys, William Popell, ____ Bacon, and Anthoin Poilivint.\n\nIn 1688 James Dugu purchased another 200 acres on Newtown Creek, James Island, to add to those acquired while he was in London:\n\nSeries Number: S213019\n\nVolume: 0038\n\nPage: 00209\n\nItem:01\n\nDate: 1688/01/05\n\nDescription: DRAYTON, THOMAS, TO JAMES DUQUE, CONVEYANCE FOR 200 ACRES ON TOWN CREEK.\n\nNames Indexed: DUQUE, JAMES/DRAYTON, THOMAS/\n\nLocations: TOWN CREEK/\n\nType: CONVEYANCE/\n\nRegarding town lots, there are discrepancies between the South Carolina Department of Archives and History listings and SmithÕs review of early Charleston settlers.\n\nSeries: S213019 Volume - 0038 Page - 00254 Item - 01\n\nDate: 1694/03/13\n\nDescription: DUQUE, JAMES SR., ABSTRACT OF LAND GRANT FOR 1 TOWN LOT IN CHARLES TOWN.\n\nSeries: S213019 Volume - 0038 Page - 00256 Item - 03\n\nDate: 1694/03/28\n\nDescription: DUEQUE, JAMES SR., ABSTRACT OF LAND GRANT FOR 1 TOWN LOT IN CHARLES TOWN.\n\nSeries: S213019 Volume - 0038 Page - 00256 Item - 04\n\nDate: 1694/03/28\n\nDescription: DUEQUE, JAMES SR., ABSTRACT OF LAND GRANT FOR 1 TOWN LOT IN CHARLES TOWN.\n\nThe town lots granted to the Dugu family according to SmithÕs article on the earliest settlers of Charleston were:[11]\n\nNo. 98 James Dugue 13 Mar 1693/4\n\nNo. 165 Isaac Dugue 28 Mar 1694\n\nNo. 186 I. Dugue 25 Mar 1694\n\nSince both lots #165 and #186 were included in the settlement of the estate of Jacques Dugu I, it is clear that it is the SCDAH record that is correct with respect to the original grants. However, the list was made in 1725, and it is possible that lots 165 and 186 had been transferred to Isaac Dugue by that time, although both lots had been inherited by Peter Dugue in 1696.\n\nJames Dugue was also granted Charleston Lot #93 in Mar 1693/4, according to Hicks. The SCHM Charleston lot list shows #92 and #93 on 14 Nov 1701 as the French Church (Charleston Deed AA:317). The lots were given to Henry LeNoble and Peter Burtell, bounding west on King St., in 1701 for the use of the French Protestants. Hicks goes on to trace both lots as having been bequeathed in the will of Henry LeNoble in 1715 to his wife, who in turn bequeathed equally to her daughters Susannah Ravenel and Catherine LeNoble Taylor in 1725. The current French Church is located at 44 Church St., across from the Dock St. Theater.\n\nHicks also indicates that Lot #165 was granted to Jacques Dugue and Alexander T. Chastagner in 1694. It was inherited by Peter Dugu in 1696. Hicks indicates that #165 was bequeathed by Peter Buretell in his 1701 will. This property was allotted to Nathaniel and Charlotte Henrietta Broughton through his estate. Adjacent lot #166 was bequeathed by Peter Burtell by will 1701 to Paul and Catherine Mazyck. Lot #167 belonged to Charlotte Henrietta Broughton as granddaughter of Peter Burtell in his 1701 will. It was sold by Thomas Broughton in 1747. Hicks may be confusing #165 with #93, which was granted for the benefit of the French church but became part of BurtellÕs estate.\n\nThere seem to have been several occasions on which oaths of allegiance were signed. Among those signing the oath of allegiance on 6 Oct 1685 were J. Dugu, P. Bacot, and Anthony Poitevin. Chardon observes that some records give a date of 1686 for this. PotevinÕs daughters married the Snows, one of them marring John Snow whose will Thomas Goodman Duke witnessed.\n\nOn 20 Jan 1688 a Dugu, presumably Jacques, and four others swore allegiance to the English government and the Lords Proprietors and their colonial government. Others listed on the same day include ÒJos. OldysÓ of Connecticut, whose daughter Margaret married Isaac Brunson, Sr., uncle of Jacob Brunson, who was the first husband of Barbara Fuster Brunson Lammons Dukes of Orangeburgh. ÒAnthoin PiolivintÓ also is listed. This is surely Anthony Poitevin. There was also ___ Bacon and William Popell. The same series of oath-takers includes several additional Huguenots over a period of several years, but most of those listed taking this oath at this time are of English origin.\n\nIn 1692 a Dugu, possibly Jacques but possibly Samuel, was among those attempting to get political rights for the Huguenots:\n\nThe French, as far as we know, made no demonstrative fight for their rights before 1692-3 . . . In this their first significant effort to secure their rights they chose seven leading Huguenots to champion their cause and plead their case before the proprietors. They were the Rev. Francis Trouillard, Minister of the Charles Town Huguenot church, MM. Buretal, Serrurier and Couran, Elders in the same church and MM. DeVervant, DeLisle, Cramahâ and Duguâ prominent Huguenot business men and planters in and about Charles Town.\n\nIn 1694 James ÒDugayÓ (whether the older or younger isnÕt known) had 10 pipes of wine consigned to him on the Mary and Elizabeth, out of Madiera. According to Wikipedia, a pipe of Madeira was 92 gallons or 348 liters, or about 2 hogsheads. (The unit varied by type of wine.) Clearly James Dugu was a wine merchant.\n\nIn 1703 William Carlisle, tanner, recorded the various sales of a 100 acre grant originally made to John Ellis and later owned by James Dugue, merchant. The property is described as follows:\n\nÒPart of a tract of 500 acres situate on S side Newtown Creek bounding N on said creek, S on land not laid out, E on land of Thomas Drayton, W on William Hatten which 100 acres was granted to John Ellis, planter, by Lords Proprs. As appears on grant dated 5 Oct. 1681, said land conveyed by Ellis to Peter and Mary Dumoulin, then conveyed to James Green and by said Green to Lydia Green his wife and by her sold to James Varin, by said Varin to Susan his wife and by her to Jacob Varin, his eldest son, by him to James Dugue, by Dugue to William Carlisle, all conveyances may appear by several deeds . . . Signed: Wm. Carlile, Wit: Joseph Elicott, Jno. Ward. D: 23 July 1703.\n\nNo record of the purchase by Jacques Dugu has been found.\n\nBy the end of 1696 both Jacques Dugu I and II were dead.\n\nThe provisions of the settlement of the estate of Jacques Dugu document his surviving family:\n\nOctober 27, 1696, Peter Dugu, son and sole executor of the last will and testament of James Dugue, Sr., deceased, Samuel DuBourdieu and Judith, his wife, James DuBose and Mary, his wife, and Marianna Dugu, widow and relict of James Dugu, Jr., on behalf of her daughter, Marianna Dugu, arranged a dvision of the property of James Dugu, Sr., reciting that the said James Dugu, Sr., by his will, made May 28, 1696, bequethed to his five children therein named and to his granddaughter, Marianna Dugue, all of his real and personal estate to be equally divided among them; that all of the said property that had come to the knowledge of said legatees had been divided into six parts, whereof Peter Dugu, in his own right and also as trustee in right of his brother, Isaac, and sister, Elizabeth; Samuel DuBourdien and James DuBose, in right of their wives, and Marianna Dugu, widow, in right of her daughter, Marianna Dugu, severally took their several parts of the same, Peter Dugue taking the plantation upon New Town Creek, JamesÕs Island, two town lots in Charles Town, numbered 165 and 186, a negro boy and £2.5.10 sterling; Peter taking for Isaac and Elizabeth part of a town lot in Charles Town, on Broad Street, which James Dugu purchased of James DeBourdeaux, blacksmith, together with the buildings thereon, and £4. 12. 4; James and Mary DuBose taking a negro man, a negro woman, a negro boy; James and Mary DuBose receiving the use of two lots in Charles Town, numbers 70 and 98, for two years and six months; then delivering possession of them up to Marianna Dugu for the use of her daughter, Marianna; Marianna Dugu taking for her daughter the use of lots in Charles Town for two years and six months, one of the lots being on Church Street, numbered 70, granted to Arthur Middleton, and having been purchased by James Dugu from Robert Skelton, cordwinder, the other granted to James Dugu, and numbered 98, the said lots to become the property, at the expiration of the time, of the younger Marianna Dugu; Samuel and Judith DuBordieu also to receive £54. 8 6 in goods of said estate. Witness: Antoine Couran, Isaac Callabeuf, Jonathon Amory and Anthony Cordes. Signature of Marianna Dugu witnessed by Boisseau, John Marriner and John Filbein. Proved before James Moore, November 9, 1696, and before James LeBas, January 22, 1696-7. Witness: Charles Odinsells, Dep. Sec. (Pages 286 and 247).\n\nThe Broad St. lot that was purchased from James DuBourdeaux was a subdivided part of Charleston Lot #28. The 500 acres in Berkeley County that was granted to James Dugu in 1692 does not appear here, but could have been transferred to one of the children before his death.\n\nThe following also details disposition of the estate\n\nIndenture: between Peter Dugue, son, sole exor. Of estate of James Dugu, Sr., dec., of 1st part and Samuel Du Bourdieu, Esq., and Judith his wife, James DuBose and Mary his wife and Marynna Dugu, widow and relict of James Dugue, Jr., on behalf of her dau. Marry Anna Dugu, on the other part. Whereas said James Dugu, Sr., the 28th of May 1696 made his will and did bequeath to his 5 children and his granddau. Mary Anna DuyGue, all his estate equally divided. And Whereas estate of said Dugu, Sr., has been valued at £403 18s 10 p by inventory as annexed, is divided into 7 parts where said Peter Dugu, on his right and as trustee in right of his brother Isaac and sister Elizabeth Dugu, Samuel Du Bourdieu and James DuBose in right of their wives and Maryanna Dugu, widow in right of her dau. Mary Anna Dugu, do acknowledge receipts and possession of signing these presents. Now this indenture witnesseth that Peter Dugu that the plantation lands and houses which belonged to his father on New Town Creek, James Island, 2 lots in Charles Town #165 and #186, 1 Negro boy, and for the use of his brother Isaac and sister Elizabeth Dugu purchased of James De Bourdeaux, blacksmith, with houses and buildings and £4 12s 4 p for their part of estate, and James and Mary DuBose shall keep 1 Negro man and woman, 1 boy valued at £70 and 2 town lots in Charles Town #70 and #98 for term of 2 years and 7 mos., and keeping houses and fences in good repair, and at expiration of said time deliver to Maryanna Dugu, widow, possession . . . p. 270\n\nJames Dugue II\n\nJames Dugue Jr. emigrated with his family and married Marianne Fleury de la Plaine, daughter of Abraham Fleury de la Plaine of Goose Creek. She was born in Paris. JamesÕ estate settlement papers document his death before that of his father.\n\nThe listing of Abraham Fleury de la Plaine from the St. Julien List:\n\n7. ABRAHAM FLEURY, De la Pleine, n  Tours, fils de Charles Fleury, et de Madeleine Soupzmain. Marianne Fleury, sa fille, veuve de Jacques Dugu, ne  Paris, et Marianne Dugu, fille du dfunct Jacques Dugu, et du dit Marianne Fleury, ne en Caroline.\n\nThis family immigrated with the Petit-Gurard Colony. (The Faur or Fouri family was also among the settlers in this group, and is later associated with the Duke family of Orangeburg County, SC.)\n\nIin 1692 James Dugu acquired land 500 acres of land at an unspecified location in Berkeley County:\n\nSeries: S213019 Volume - 0038 Page - 00227 Item - 04\n\nDate: 1692/03/31\n\nDescription: DUQUE, JAMES, LAND GRANT FOR 500 ACRES IN BERKLEY COUNTY.\n\nThis land may have been on James Island, which was in Berkeley County at this time. If the grant actually was made to James Dugu, Jr. rather than to his father, Goose Creek would have been especially likely, since it has been suggested that he lived there after his marriage to Marianne Fleury, and after his death his widow remarried to Peter Bacot of that community.\n\nIn settling JamesÕ estate, John Lebert [Lebas] of Charles Towne, merchant, moved to be granted Letters of Admin. Of estate of James Dugue as principal creditor; Mrs. Dugay and James Dugue agreed 17 Jan 1696/7.\n\nRecords show the following regarding the estate of James Dugue:\n\nJanuary 18, 1695-6, John Lebas, Henry Le Noble and Peter Guerard executed their bond to Governor Archdale for LebasÕs faithful performance of his trust as administrator of the estate of James Dugue, late of Charles Town, deceased. Witness: Charles Odingsells (Page 231).\n\nVirginia Gourdin has suggested that Lebas (Lebert or LeBas) might have been a business partner of Jacques Dugu. This is probably true. Aside from his role as administrator of the estate of Jacques Dugu, he witnessed legal documents while in Jamaica relating to the estate of Susanna Barker, suggesting that he too was involved in Jamaican trade. (When lands opened up in Amelia Township in the 1730Õs, James Le Bas was among those acquiring grants, in close proximity to Peter Faur, Joseph Barker, and others from Charleston and the surrounding area.)\n\nSettlement of the estate of James Dugu Jr. involved dealing with the estate of James Dugu, Sr.:\n\nJudgment: that the said Mary Anna Du Gue, widow, for use of her sister [daughter] Mary Anna Du Gue by her husband James Du Gue, Jr., to keep in her possession the expiration of 2 years 7 mos. From date here of 2 town lots in Charles Towne in st. that leads from French Church to White Point, one of which #70 was purchased by James Dugu, Sr., from Robert Skelton, cordwainer, the other lot was granted to said Du Gue and known by #98, which 2 lots with buildings thereon belonging to Mary Anna Dugu, dau. Of said James Du Gue, Jr., is to hold her share of real estate, and her mother Mary Ann Du Gue, widow, paying to Samuel Du Bourdien £5 2s 10 p stg., and that the said Samuel and Judith Du Bourdien shall receive of said Du Bose £5 3s 10p stg., . . . . Estate of James Du Gue, Sr., as in aforementioned will, in witness whereof the parties have set their hands and seals. Signed, Jacques Dubose, Marie Dubose, S.

D: 9 Nov. 1696.\n\nPersonally: appeared before me James Lebass, one of his MajestyÕs Justices of Peace for Berkeley County, Anthony Bouran, Anthony Cordes and Isaac Cailabeuf and made oath that they did see Mrs. Judith Dubourdien, Mr. Samuel Dubourdien, James Dubose and Marie Dubose sign within act in Charles Towne. Wit: James Le Bars. D: 23 Nov. 1696. R: 22 Mar 1696/7. P. 231.\n\nThe witnesses above suggest where Marianne Dugue was when she signed the document. John Maverick, one of the witnesses of Mrs. DugueÕs signature, was one of the first settlers on Newtown Creek (site of Jacques Dugu's first grant). However, John Maverick also owned land at Goose Creek, below the confluence of the Cooper and the Back River, near Nathaniel SnowÕs Red Bank plantation. (The Mavericks later reappear in the will of Joan Watkins Duke of Christ Church Parish, widow of William Duke.) In 1696 J. Boisseau owned property at the head of Yeamans Creek adjacent Abraham Fleury de la Plane, and had not yet received his much larger grant near Summerville. John Filbein owned a tract south of Yeamans Hall.\n\nAfter his death the widow of James Dugue II remarried, to Peter Bacot, Jr. The listing for the Bacot family in the St. Julien List is as follows:\n\n22. PIERRE BACOT, n  Tours, fils de Pierre Bacot et de Jeanne Moreau. Jacquine Mercier, sa femme. Pierre et Daniel Bacot, frres, leurs fils, nz en France, et lizabeth Bacot, leur fille, ne en Caroline.\n\nBacot lived in the St. James Goose Creek Parish, as did Abraham Fleury de la Plaine, father of Marianne Dugu. His earliest acquisition there was part of the original Boisseau tract and he also purchased land from Charles Franchomme.\n\nThe will of Peter Bacot of Berekeley County, SC, in the next generation (b. 15 Nov 1671 d. 1730, Charleston), mentions his wife Mary [Perroneau] Bacot, sons Samuel and Peter, daughters Mary and Elizabeth, friend Tobias Fitch, sister-in-law Elizabeth Peronneau. He named Gideon Faucharode and Tobias Fitch executors and wife Mary Bacot executrix Òduring her widowhood and no longer.Ó Tobias Fitch married Marianne, daughter of James Dugue II and Marianne Fleury de la Plane Dugue.\n\nMarianne Dugu, daughter of James Dugu, Jr., and Tobias Fitch\n\nMarianne Dugu married Tobias Fitch (originally Fitz), who was from one of the early Quaker families that settled in the lowcountry, particularly in lower Colleton County. He was a son of Jonathan and Susanna Fitch, and was a member of the Assembly in 1726. Jonathan Fitch lived at Goose Creek but had very substantial land grants at Spoons Savannah, This was also the location of substantial Pendarvis family land holdings; the Pendarvis family was later in Orangeburgh District.\n\nJonathan Fitch was involved in Indian affairs. Jonathan Fitch and Thomas Rose of Accabee built the St. Andrews Parish church. Tobias Fitch lived, owned his most extensive properties (at least some if which were inherited by his wife Marianne Dugu from her grandfather Abraham Fleury de la Plaine) in St. James, Goose Creek, where he was listed as petit and grand juror.\n\nThe Colonial Writs of Partition document that James Fitch married Ann Rose, daughter of that Thomas Rose, and also show that the Fitch family owned land on the Ashley River adjacent lands owned by the Pendarvis family, as they did at Spoons.\n\nIn 1718/19 Tobias Fitch provided bond for the estate of Daniel Dean, along with estate administrator Nathaniel Snow, brother of John Snow whose will Thomas Goodman Duke of St. Thomas and St. Denis witnessed thirty years later. James Dubose, husband of Marie Dugue, is also mentioned in an estate settlement with Nathaniel Snow.\n\nIn July 1720 ÒTobias Fitch, planter, & Marianne, his wife, daughter of James Dugue, Jr.. & of Dame Marian Henry his wife & granddaughter of James Dugue, Sr.Ó sold to Andrew Dupuy of Charleston the southern half of Lot #70 in Charleston.\n\nThis Andrew Dupuy may be related to the Dugus, through Elizabeth Dupuy Dugu. The will of Andr Dupuy, dated 4 Jan 1721/2 and probated 11 Oct 1722, listed wife Jane as executrix. Also listed were a son, Andr, and daughters Marianne and Esther. Witnesses were Pierre Manigault and Jean Delaune. This son, Andr, is probably the Andrew Dupuy to whom half of lot #70 was sold.\n\nIn 1721 Tobias Fitch had a town lot adjacent Peter Manigault, Richard Beresford (previously Jackson) and others.\n\nIn 1722 Jonathan and Tobias Fitch were involved in several land transactions that were witnessed by Garratt Vanvelsin. Gurard or Garrett Vanvelsin was a witness for the wedding of Robert Duke a little more than a decade later (see Assoc. Families, Charleston, file). In 1723 John Laurens witnessed a Tobias Fitch land transaction.\n\nIn 1725 Tobias Fitch was Agent to the Creeks.\n\nThe will of Susannah Fitch, widow of Jonathan Fitch, enumerates her grandchildren as Jonathan, Thomas and Steven, sons of Jonathan Fitch; Steven, Tobias, and John, sons of Tobias Fitch; Williamson, son of Joseph Fitch. Granddaughters were Susannah, daughter of Joseph Fitch; Mary and Ann, daughters of Tobias Fitch. Her daughters-in-law were Mary Ann Fitch and Constant Fitch. The executor of her estate was Roger Sanders [Saunders]. Witnesses were Thomas Smith Jr. and George Smith.\n\nRoger Saunders owned land at Wassamassaw but was an Indian trader rather than a planter. His bond was dated 24 Nov 1714. He was also executor for Thomas Smith, Jr.\n\nMary Fitch, daughter of Tobias and Marianne Fitch, married Thomas Livingston in 1747.\n\nThe Giessendanner Book of Record for the parish centered in Orangeburgh shows that John Fitch married Ann Holmes 16 Jan 1748/49 in Orangeburgh County. William Clement and Samuel Pickings were listed as witnesses (the best translation is found in the Orangeburgh Book of Record at http://www.xs4all.nl/~sail/orange/17490116.html). SCDAH records show that a Clement family was from St. Thomas and St. Denis Parish. The Mills Atlas of South Carolina of 1825 shows Clement family holdings near Willtown on the Edisto, and therefore near the Fitch family lands at Spoons and near the Ash family lands.\n\nOne candidate for Ann Holmes is a daughter of Isaac Holmes who was mentioned in the will of her uncle William Holmes. Isaac Holmes owned land adjacent John Simmons, whose granddaughter Ann married James Vanvelsen.Francis Holmes was a Charleston merchant, and with Ebenezer Simmons was executor of the will of Garret Vanvelsen. William Holmes was the son-in-law of Garret Vanvelsen. However, it is more likely that the Holmes family in the New Windsor area was her origin; that family also intermarried with the Zubly and Galphin families.\n\nTobias Fitch was an active businessman:\n\nSeries Number: S372001\n\nVolume: 00A0\n\nPage: 00005\n\nItem:00\n\nDate: 1719-1721\n\nDescription: FITCH, TOBIAS TO WILLIAM LIVINGSTON, MORTGAGE OF 12 NEGROES AS FURTHUR SECURITY OF A BOND FOR 47,000 WEIGHT RICE.\n\nNames Indexed: FITCH, TOBIAS/LIVINGSTON, WILLIAM/\n\nLocations: /\n\nType: MORTGAGE/\n\nTopics: SLAVE MORTGAGES/RICE\n\nIn 1732 Tobias Fitch was involved in a land transaction for the benefit of the Peter Bacot family.

(Alexander Goodbe married Rebecca Hasfort, daughter of Joseph Hasfort. )\n\nTobias Fitch was associated with the Tucker family, which was later at Cattle Creek in Orangeburgh District with the family of Joseph Dukes. John Tucker witnessed a land transaction between Jonathan and Tobias Fitch in 1715:\n\nI, Jonathan Fitch of Berkeley County, Carolina, planter, agree to and with Tobias Fitch; I, Jonathan Fitch, for £2,000 c.m. paid to me by Tobias Fitch of said county do sell to Tobias Fitch that tract or tracts of land where my father Jonathan Fitch, last lived being on N side Ashley River as shown on plats to which is annexed the Lords.

In 1735 Judith ÒDeaberduÓ had a plat surveyed for 600 acres of land in St. HelenaÕs Parish, Granville County. This was granted on 14 April 1736. This property was in the hands of John Wragg in 1762.\n\nThe DuBourdieu family continued their concern for marriage contracts in the next generation:\n\nBook Ba, p. 29 29 July 1720. Judith Dubourdieu, widow, of Berkeley Co., SC, in consideration of marriage contract between James Colleton and her daughtere Judith Dubourdieu granted 1/3 part of land in her possession to James Colleton Òand also the third part of the Negroes wch is already sheared and as soon as the howing time is over the same James Colleton shall be put in possession both of the land and Negroes by the provisoe; tha the hand of the said James Colleton shall help to put in the crop that is now upon the ground and also to clean the rice fit for market; because the said rice is designed to pay the debts of the plantation or in part of which the said Colleton is to pay the third part as well as to have the third of the said cropt debts paid; and I Samuel DuBourdieu do agree and consent conjointly with my mother to this above gift and agreement.Ó Witnesses: Major Percivel Pawley, Paul Peter Lebas. Before Benjamin Whitaker, Robert Yonge, Register, 19 Sept. 1720 6 Negroes delivered to James Colleton and Judith (daughter) as part of daughterÕs fortune. Witnesses: Henry Simmons, Paul Trapier.\n\nMarie Dugue Dubose and James Dubose\n\nMarie Dugue married James Dubose. He was the son of Andrea Dubose and Marie de Stoade. This is the St. Julien List summary of some of the immigrants from this family:\n\n72. ISAAC DUBOSC, fils de Louis Dubosc et d'Anne Dubosc, de Dieppe en Normandie, Susane Dubosc, sa femme, fille de Pierre Couillandeau, et de Susane Couillandeau, native de la Tramblade en Xaintonge.\n\nBy 1706 James Dubose was dead, and Dr. John Thomas (Jean Thomas), a ÒchirugeonÓ became her second husband. (John Thomas was a witness to the will of Joseph Pendarvis I. )\n\nA daughter of James Dubose and Marie Dugue, Judith, married Joseph Wragg, to whom Peter Dugue gave power-of-attorney to collect debts in South Carolina in 1718.\n\nThe Wraggs and Job Rothmahler had a legal dispute with Jonathan Fitch regarding collection of a debt:\n\nSeries Number: S136002\n\nBox: 013A\n\nItem: 0109A\n\nignore: 00\n\nDate: 1719\n\nDescription: WRAGG, SAMUELL, JOSEPH WRAGG AND JOB ROTHMAHLER VS JONATHAN FITCH, JUDGMENT ROLL.\n\nNames Indexed: WRAGG, SAMUELL//WRAGG, JOSEPH//ROTHMAHLER, JOB/FITCH, JONATHAN/\n\nType: JUDGMENT-ROLL//\n\nJames Dubose was owed money by Robert Wetherick of New England at the time of WetherickÕs death in the house of surgeon Nathaniel Snow in September 1700. Nathaniel Snow was the brother of John Snow, whose will later was witnessed by Thomas Goodman Duke of St. Thomas and St. Denis Parish. Both John and Nathaniel Snow married Poitevans, thus linking themselves to the Huguenot community, specifically to parts of it with connections to the Dugue family. On 20 Dec 1699 Anthony Poitvin, Lewis Pasquereau and James DuBose were bound for the estate of James De Bourdeaux, administered by Anthony Poitvin.\n\nJoseph Wragg is also mentioned as an adjacent landowner in a 1733 land title that refers to Peter Dugue (see below in the discussion of Peter Dugu). Wragg acquired many land grants throughout South Carolina, which are documented in the records of the South Carolina Department of Archives and History.\n\nIn 1741 Joseph Wragg and Richard Lambton sued John Hearn. The cause appears to be a routine debt. Hearn was from James Island, and was the earliest settler at Orangeburg Township, arriving several years before establishment of the township as a Swiss settlement.\n\nThe children and grandchildren of this couple were:\n\n1. Marie (Mary), born in Carolina, and married Hon. Samuel Wragg. Their children\n\nwere:\n\nA. William Wragg (m. 1st. Mary Wood; m. 2nd. Henrietta).\n\nB. Samuel Wragg.\n\nC. Judith Wragg.\n\nD. Mary Wragg.\n\n2. Judith Dubose, m. 1717 Joseph Wragg. They lived in Charles Town, where he was\n\na merchant. Her Will is recorded in Will Bk. 1767-71, p. 388, Charleston, S.

In this will she mentions sisters and a brother and Wragg\n\nnephews along with nephews John Poague, Gabrill Manigault, and Joseph Smith, and\n\nalso nieces Ann Ferguson, Judith Ladson, Mary Smith, Anne Manigault, Henrietta\n\nManigault, along with Wragg Nieces, and makes her brother John Wragg, nephews\n\nJoseph Wragg and Gabrill Manigault and Major James Ladson as Executors of her\n\nWill.\n\n3. Ann Dubose, married Job Rothmahler, Esq. They lived in the Georgetown area.\n\nChildren were:\n\nA. Job Rothmahler, married Esther Billing.\n\nB. Erasmus Rothmahler.\n\nC. Mary Rothmahler, married John Andrews.\n\nD. Judith Rothmahler, married Samuel Wragg.\n\nE. Elizabeth Rothmahler, married John Waties.\n\nF. Ann Rothmahler, died in Georgetown 1770, not married.\n\nG. Charlotte Rothmahler, M. Joseph Allston of Waccamaw.\n\nJob Rothmahler had many business interests with the Wraggs, some affecting the backcountry. In 1743 the South Carolina Commons House of Assembly investigated reports of a silver mine in Cherokee country, with the potential to disrupt the colonyÕs relations with the tribes and with the French. Thomas Murray testified that he had traveled throughout the area in question with Mr. Rothmahler in search of mines. It was determined that Childermas Croft was among the several parties involved in the enterprise. Michael Christopher Rowe of Orangeburg testified that a public advertisement had been posted in the township to solicit workers for the mine, and that Òto the best of his recollection Mr. Wragg was to pay the money.Ó Those responding were to meet Mr. Maxwell at Mrs. RussellÕs house. (The Audley Maxwell family had come from the PA/VA border with Moses Russell and his family to settle in Amelia Township.) Rowe testified that Bernard Snell was one of those involved in the work, and that Peter Crim was overseer of the mine. The Council was unanimous in condemning the enterprise as likely to enrich the individual participants at great danger to the colony. The Wraggs and Rothmahler were also large-scale slave traders. Many of CharlestonÕs historic mansions were built on foundations like these.\n\nPeter Dugu\n\nPeter Dugu, son of Jacques Dugu and his first wife Judith Soumin, was documented in the St. Julien List of Huguenots seeking naturalization in South Carolina in about 1696:\n\n15. PIERRE DUGU, Isaac Dugue, son frre, et lizabeth Dugu, leur s¾ur, nz  Bsance en Bery, enfans de Jacques Dugu et d'lizabet Dupuy.\n\nPeter Dugue was the second oldest son of Jacques Dugu, an adult in 1696 and administrator of his fatherÕs estate following the death of his older brother, James. Since he was an adult in 1696, he was born no later than 1675. PeterÕs share of his fatherÕs estate was the plantation (Jacques DugusÕ original 500 acre grant) on New Town Creek, JamesÕs Island, SC; two town lots in Charles Town, SC, numbered 165 and 186; a negro boy and £2.5.10 sterling.\n\nPeter quickly moved to increase his land holdings in South Carolina. He had a warrant from the SecretaryÕs office for 500 acres in Berkeley County, dated 18 Sep 1697.\n\nÒMr. DuqueÓ is found in the following record; related documents place the time as about 1695:\n\nParticulars: of goods and sums of money Mr. Girard has assigned to Mr. Edmund Medlicott for stock of £400 put in hands of said Girard to trade and merchandise within partnership. Mr. Edmond Dundon, Mrs. Dundon his wife, Mr. William Nowell, Mr. Noble, Mr. Duque and others, 1/8 part brigantine that Mr. Turquett and Mr. Marian are building. Mr. Medlicott, Mr. John Reeves, Capt. James Moore, Mr. Hatchman, Mr. Froman [Amounting to £400 7s 1 ½.]\n\nThis evidence of Dugu involvement in CharlestonÕs lively shipping trade dates marks the beginning of a multi-generational involvement in shipping. The individual listed is probably Peter Dugue, although he could be Jacques Dugu I immediately before his death. Isaac Dugu was a minor in 1696 and could not have been a member of this group of ship owners.\n\nPeter moved to Jamaica sometime during or before 1706. References to his family there are found primarily in the register of St. AndrewÕs Parish, Jamaica, which includes the town and port of Kingston.\n\nVolume I, Register of St. AndrewsÕs Parish, Jamaica:\n\np. 272 burial of Walter ÒDugouÓ 4 Nov 1706\n\np. 195 marriage of Peter Dugue and Dorothy Struyse, 23 Sep 1707\n\np. 47 baptism of Judith, daughter of Peter and Dorothy Dugue, 25 Aug 1708\n\np. 48 baptism of Peter, son of Peter and Dorothy Dugue, 2 Apr 1710\n\np. 50 baptism of Isaac, son of Peter and Dorothy Dugue, 6 Apr 1713\n\np. 51 baptism of Dorothy, daughter of Peter and Dorothy Dugue, Feb 1715\n\np. 53 baptism of James, son of Peter and Dorothy Dugue, 15 Mar 1720\n\np. 279 burial of Judith Dugue, 16 Dec 1720\n\np. 296 burial of Dorothy Dugue, spinster 23 Nov 1760\n\nThe name Struyse is rare, but it is probably not a mistake. It is a Dutch name, spelled in the Netherlands Struys, Struijs, and Struyse. Some of this family were famous mariners. Van Meurs of Amsterdam published a German translation of Jan Janszoon StruysÕ voyages in 1678. Jan Struys was a middle-aged husband and father when he left to serve the Czar in the late 1660s. His book was later published in English, and is often cited, sometimes for peculiar descriptions of natural phenomena. He also produced an especially good map of the Caspian Sea. There are also references to Òvan der Struijs.Ó\n\nThe parish register documents children Judith, Peter, Isaac, Dorothy, and James. The will of James Dugue, son of Peter and Dorothy, documents another daughter of Peter Dugue, Mary, who married Andrew Burnside of Jamaica. There are therefore at least six children of Peter Dugu.\n\nWalter ÒDugouÓ (listed as Dugue in the register index) who died in St. Andrews in 1706 was possibly a child of Peter Dugu. This suggests that Peter had married and had children before his marriage to Dorothy Struyse in St. AndrewÕs Parish, Jamaica, in 1706. To have been an adult at the time that his father Jacques DuguÕs estate was settled in 1696, Peter was at least 31 years old in 1706, and could easily have married earlier and had children with a first wife; it is likely that he did so. His brother Isaac Dugue, on the other hand, was a minor in 1696, a bit older than his sister born in about 1685, and was probably no more than about 22-25 years old in 1706, young to have an existing family. On the other hand, all of the names that one would expect in a son of PeterÕs (Peter, Isaac, James) are found in the sons of the Struyse marriage; the origin of ÒWalterÓ in this family is entirely unknown.\n\nThe following references from the Kingston Parish, Jamaica, Register document the death of three Dugu sons:\n\nVol. I:\n\np. 3 Dugay, James, buried 3 Nov 1722\n\np. 7 Dugue, Thomas, buried 1 Jan 1723\n\np. 8 Dugue, William, buried 22 Jan 1723\n\nPeter and his brother Isaac were both in Jamaica at this time and in theory either could have been father of these children. However, it will be seen that James Dugu who died in Jamaica in 1766 was the son of Peter and Dorothy Dugu; the James Dugu who died in 1722 was probably a son of Isaac Dugu. This rapid succession of deaths may be attributable to the hurricane of 28 Aug 1722, one of the worst ever to hit Jamaica, with terrible loss of both life and property, and the earthquake the same year, which caused additional damage. Such events are often followed by the rapid spread of infectious disease, malnutrition, and other threats to human life, especially that of children. There was also a slave rebellion in Jamaica in 1722. It was not a healthy environment.\n\nThe listing of the burials in the Kingston Parish (the narrow slip of land extending partially across the harbor at Kingston, defined as a separate parish in 1693), which was not the usual family parish, suggests that the family may have lost their home as a consequence of the storm. As shipbuilders, it is also very likely that Peter and Isaac lost everything in their businesses, unless they had a ship at sea out of harmÕs way at the time of the storm.\n\nPeter continued business interests in South Carolina long after he established his family in Jamaica. In 1718 Peter provided his power of attorney to Joseph Wragg of South Carolina to recover debts owed to him in South Carolina:\n\nSeries Number: S72001\n\nVolume: 00A0\n\nPage: 00109\n\nItem: 00\n\nDate: 1719-1721\n\nDescription: DUGUE, PETER TO JOSEPH WRAGG, POWER OF ATTORNEY TO RECOVER DEBTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\n\nNames Indexed: DUGUE, PETER/WRAGG, JOSEPH/\n\nType: POWER OF ATTORNEY/\n\nTopics: DEBT/\n\nThis power of attorney was witnessed in Jamaica by John Marten and Capt. Michal Durouzeaux. The Martens who were in Jamaica at this time were Jewish residents of Spanish Town, Jamaica. However Michael Durouzeaux appears to be a South Carolina connection of DuguÕs, a fellow Huguenot in the maritime trades. The members of the Durouzeaux family originally from Saintonge, France. In 1699 ÒM DuroutzeÓ witnessed a document for John Royer of Charles Town, mariner. Royer was the son of Judith Royer, who after the death of Noah Royer married Peter Manigault.[83]\n\nBond for the administration of the estate of Daniell Durouzeaux, Sr., family founder in South Carolina, was provided in 1700 by Jean Prioleau, Peter Girard, and James Dubose (whose wife was Marie Dugu). The warrant of appraisement for his estate was directed to Peter de St. Julien, James Le Lerurier, Lewis Pasquereau, Elias Foissin, and Henry Perroneau.\n\nMichael Durazeau provided bond, with Henry Broneau, for Henry Bruneau as administrator of the estate of Paul Brunean in 1711. The Bruneaus were of a noble French family. Bruneau owned land in St. James Santee Parish. In 1733 Henry Bruneau owned land on the Santee adjacent Jacob Bond, founder of the Bond shipyards at Hobcaw Point and father-in-law of Clement Lempriere and others.\n\nMichaelÕs brother, Daniel Durouzeaux, Jr., and Elizabeth Faucheraud married and were parents of Daniel Durouzeaux, III and Peter Durouzeaux. With the death of Daniel and Elizabeth, ElizabethÕs mother Anna Faucheraud (widow of Charles Faucheraud) was given custody of the minor children. Daniel Durouzeaux III was married by Rev. John Giessendanner to Olivia Wood in 1747:\n\n93. Daniel Decuraseux March 14th To Olivet Wood.\n\nIn Georgia the Durouzeaux became very involved in Creek affairs, and intermarried with the Creeks. Stephen James Durouzeaux became the principal interpreter for the Creek Nation. Tobias Fitch, who married Peter DuguÕs niece Marianne Dugu, was Creek agent in the mid-1720s. Later their son John Fitch was active in Creek affairs, and settled in the Augusta area. John Fitch married Ann Holmes, whose family also intermarried with that of George Galphin (see Fitch and Holmes, Assoc. Families Charleston file). The will of Daniel Durouzeaux of Georgia listed George Galphin as an executor. Galphin was the principal trader to the Lower Creek Nation, and Creek agent for Georgia governor Sir James Wright.\n\nAmong the business interests that Peter Dugu may have retained in South Carolina, requiring appointment of his kinsman Joseph Wragg as attorney to represent him, was the property that he inherited from his father in Charleston and on James Island. On 27 and 28 Feb 1726 a deed by Richard Grimston for lot #229 in Charleston lists N on Mr. Dugue, E on John Hill, W on Thomas Rose. This suggests that in 1726 Peter Dugue retained ownership of Lot #186, on King Street between Broad and Tradd, which he had inherited from his father in 1696. However, delays in filing deeds often produced out-of-date lists of adjacent landowners.\n\nA memorial for Lawrence Dennis dated 1733 for property on the south side of Newtown Creek on James Island in South Carolina identifies Peter Dugue as an adjacent landowner on the east side in that year. The original document has been examined by the author and a staff archivist at the South Carolina Department of Archives` and History and seems to refer to him as a contemporary, not a past, landowner. This was land that Peter inherited from his father in 1696, near the Hearn, Davis, Tucker and Watkins families.\n\nSeries Number: S111001\n\nVolume: 0003\n\nPage: 00248\n\nItem: 01\n\nDate: 1733/05/08\n\nDescription: DENNIS, LAWRENCE, MEMORIAL FOR TWO TRACTS CONTAINING 633 ACRES ON JAMES ISLAND, BERKLEY COUNTY.\n\nNames Indexed: DENNIS, LAWRENCE/CLARK, HANNAH/CLARK/GEORGE, ROBERT/WILLISON, EDWARD/WITTER, JAMES/CHAPLIN, JOHN/HATTER/HOUSHAW/HEARNE, PETER/DRAYTON, THOMAS/DUGEE, PETER/LORIDGE/PETERSON, RICHARD\n\nLocations: JAMES ISLAND/BERKELEY COUNTY/STONO RIVER/NEWTOWN CREEK\n\nType: MEMORIAL/\n\nIt has been shown that part of the original 500 acre Du Gu grant was sold to Samuel Du Bourdieu and by him to Peterson.

In 1754 Richard Reader owned land in St. AndrewÕs (20 acres) and St. GeorgeÕs (880 acres) parishes. In 1749 John Grey bought land from James Dukes (Liber 138 1749 Folio 91).\n\nA John Gray is listed in St. GeorgeÕs Parish and in Kingston:\n\nGRAY, JOHN M.A. St. George 1745, '47.\n\nGRAY, JOHN (Gray & Hunter ) M.D. Kingston 1768.\n\nA William Gray was buried in St. CatherineÕs Parish in 1755. In 1672 a William Grey sold land in St. CatherineÕs Parish to Sir Thomas Lynch (Lib 4 fol' 84). William Gray was listed as a landowner with 720 acres in St. CatherineÕs in 1670. In 1768 a William Gray was Provost Marshall of Jamaica. A Henry Grey was a planter in Vere Parish in 1726 (Liber 17, Folio 90).\n\nAbel Castlefrank was a landowner in St. James Parish in 1754, having 696 acres. He sold land to James Dugue in 1750 (Liber 140 1750 Folio 54).\n\nJames Irving of St. James Parish, Jamaica, (northwest Jamaica) was sold land by James Dugue in 1754 (Liber 166 1757 Folio 79). Irving had South Carolina associations:\n\nMONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS. 105\n\n115.\n\nTHE HONBLE. JAMES IRVING, ESQ. LATE CUSTOS OF TRELAWNY, DIED 21st NOVEMBER, 1798, AGED 49 YEARS.\n\nTHE Irvings, owners of Ironshore and Hartfield, in St. James' parish. James, eldest son of Dr. James Irving, obtained Ironshore, from John Lawrence, in exchange for an estate in South Carolina. James Irving, the younger, was Custos of Trelawny, and represented that parish, in the Assemblies of 1774, 1781, 1787, 1790, and 1796. This was a branch of the family of Irving of Robgill Tower, Dumfriesshire, represented by Sir Paulus Aemelius Irving, Bart.\n\nIn 1774 James Irving was recorded as owning the sugar plantation Ironshore in St. James Parish, with 12 men bearing arms, 4 women and children, 254 slaves, 20 stock, 190 Hhds. and 0 TRCS. Ironshore is still extant, and is beautifully situated overlooking the sea east of Montego Bay Point.\n\nAccording to SCDAH records in 1755 a James Irving sold Goose Creek, SC, land to Richard Dunn Lawrence (also indexed by SCDAH as Richard DunnLaurens):\n\nSeries Number: S372001\n\nVolume: 02Q0\n\nPage: 00168\n\nItem:00\n\nDate: 1755-1756\n\nDescription: IRVING, JAMES AND WIFE TO LAURENCE RICHARD DUNN, ENFEOFFMMENT FOR 1,452.5 ACRES OF LAND IN ST.

The Dunns were a Montego Bay, St. JamesÕ Parish, Jamaica, family, descended from Richard Dunn. The Dunns of St. James married into the Lawrence family several times. The first Lawrence-Dunn connection was quite early; the relict of Richard Dunn married the first John Lawrence of Jamaica. The South Carolina family may or may not be connected to that of Jamaica.\n\nThe daughter of John Lawrence II and Susanna Petgrave Lawrence, Rachael, married Jeremiah Downer. James Dugue also had business dealings with George Downer of St. James Parish. In 1750 John Lawrence owned 5620 acres of land in Jamaica (the published list does not include owners of fewer than 5000 acres).\n\nThe first listing for a James Irving in the SCDAH records:\n\nSeries Number:S213003\n\nVolume: 002E\n\nPage: 00374\n\nItem:00\n\nDate: 1740/03/20\n\nDescription: IRVING, JAMES, OF CHARLES TOWN TO MAJOR WILLIAM STEWART, OF NEW PROVIDENCE, BAHAMAS, BOND OF 420 POUNDS STERLING TO PAY STEWART TWO HUNDRED TEN POUNDS STERLING FOR OBTAINING FOR IRVING THE POSITION OF SURGEON TO THE NEW PROVIDENCE INDEPENDENT COMPANY OF FOOT FORMERLY HELD BY STEWART.

Arthur Hall was heavily involved in Jamaican merchant activities, as was William Stewart.\n\nGeorge Bonner had real estate transactions with James Dukes in 1750 and 1753 (FA Deed for James Dukes to George Bonner Liber 151 1753 Folio 29; BA Deed for George Bonner to James Dukes Liber 141 1750 Folio 184.). Bonner was a landowner in St. DorothyÕs Parish (Caribbeana Vol. II).\n\nGeorge Bonner and others in his family held land in both St. DorothyÕs and St. AnnÕs parishes during the 18th century. Freeman Bonner was listed as owner of 88 acres in St. DorothyÕs Parish in 1754. George Bonner of Kingston, carpenter, married Mary Ward in Kingston on 21 Dec 1754. John Bonner was in St. CatherineÕs Parish by 1670. George Bonner was a JP in St. CatherineÕs in 1751.\n\nJohn Turner purchased land from James Dukes in 1753 (FA Deed for James Dukes to John Turner Liber 154 1753 Folio 111). Turners appear in the early marriage indexes of St. CatherineÕs Parish. A John Turner owned land in Santa Cruz, Jamaica, in the 1740Õs. There was also a John Turner in Charleston with interesting connections: The Pallas, a 200 ton ship, John Turner, master, was registered in 1774 in Charleston to owners that included the James Laurens of the Laurens family of South Carolina, and also Peter Bacot.\n\nGeorge Downer was a Jamaican landowner in 1754 in the St. James (northwest Jamaica) and Vere (adjacent St. DorothyÕs) parishes. In 1759 he sold land to James Dugue (BA Deed for George Downer to James Dugue Liber 176 1759 Folio 74). As noted above, Jeremiah Downer married a daughter of John Lawrence II.\n\nJames DugueÕs will (Jamaica Liber 36, Folio 239) is dated 1766, and identifies him as a resident of St. Andrews Jamaica:\n\nWill for James Dugue Liber 36 1766 Folio 239\n\nWill of James Dugue Liber 36 1766 Folio 129\n\nThe text is as follows:\n\nDugue James Proved 2 Octob. 1766\n\nJamaica\n\nIn the Name of God Amen I James Dugue of the Parish of St. Andrews in the County of Surry in the said Island Gentleman being weak in body but of sound and disposing mind and memory Do make and Ordain this my last will and Testament first and principally I recommend my Soul into the hands of Almighty God who gave it me and my Body I commit to the Earth to be Decently Interred at the Discretion of my Executrix and Executor hereinafter named and as touching the Disposition of all such Worldly Estate as it hath pleased almighty God to bestow upon me I give and Dispose thereof as followeth First I will and direct that all my just Debts and funeral Expenses be paid and Discharged by my Executrix and Executor hereinafter named and after payment thereof I give Devise and Bequeath unto my loving Sister Mary Burnside all that piece or parcel of Land Situate lying and being in the said parish of Saint Andrew Containing by Estimation four acres and a half or thereabouts, be the same more or less, Formerly the property of my Dear mother Dorothy Roycroft and late the Property of my loving Sister Dorothy Dugue to hold the said piece or parcel of Land and Premises with the Appurtenances unto my said Sister Mary Burnside for and during the Term of her Natural life and from and after her Decease I give Devise and bequeath the said Piece or parcel of land and Premises with the appurtenances unto my loving kinswoman Mary Ann Brown and to her heirs and assigns To the only use and behoof of the said Mary Ann Brown her heirs and assigns of ever and to and for no other use intent or purpose whatsoever also I give Devise and bequeath unto my said Kinswoman Mary Ann Brown my negro Woman Slave named Monimia To hold to my said Kinswoman for and during the term of her natural life and from and after her Decease it is my will and I do hereby manumize and for ever set free my said negro Woman Slave named Monimia from all manner of Slavery and Servitude for ever and all the rest residue and remainder of my Estate both real and personal I give Devise and bequeath unto my loving niece Elizabeth Brown of the said Parish of Saint Andrew Widow to hold the same and every part and parcel thereof unto my said niece Elizabeth Brown for and during the term of her natural life and from and after her Decease I give Devise and bequeath the same and every part and parcel thereof unto my nephew Thomas Burnside of the said parish of Saint Andrew Esquire and Joseph Pope of the Parish of Kingston in the said Island Esq. and to their heirs To the only use and behalf of the said Thomas Burnside and Joseph Pope their heirs and assigns for ever In Trust Nevertheless and to and for the only use and behalf of my loving kinsman Andrew Brown son of my said Niece Elizabeth Brown until he shall arrive to the age of Twenty one years, and upon his arriving to the age of Twenty one years then I give Devise and bequeath the said residuum of my Estate unto the said Andrew Brown his Heirs and assigns for ever and in case my said Kinsman Andrew Brown shall happen to die before he arrives to his said age of Twenty one years then and in such case I give Devise and bequeath the same and every part thereof unto my two Kinswomen Sarah Groves Brown and Dorothy Francis Brown Daughters of my said niece Elizabeth Brown and to their Heirs for ever and to and for no other use intent or purpose whatsoever and Lastly I do hereby nominate and appoint my said Niece Elizabeth Brown and the said Joseph Pope the Executrix and Executor of this my last will and testament hereby revoking and making void all former and other wills by me at any time heretofore made IN Witness whereof I have to this my last will and Testament consisting of Two Sheets of Paper to the first Sheet set my hand to the last set my hand and affixed my Seal this Twenty ninth day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand Seven hundred and Sixty four -- Jas.

Dorothy Roycroft owned four acres of land in St. DorothyÕs Parish in 1754. In 1737 she sold or gave land to James Dugue (Liber 101 1737 Folio 31). She was identified in his will as his mother, and can therefore be identified as Dorothy Struyse Dugu, widow of Peter Dugu. The 1737 deed from Dorothy Roycroft to James Dugue places the death of Peter Dugu before that year, when Dorothy had remarried, to an unknown Roycroft.\n\nThe James Dugu also will demonstrates that Dorothy Dugu, sister of this James Dugu, never married. Mary Dugu, daughter of Peter and Dorothy, married a Burnside. The other Jamaican wills that reference the Dugus show that she married Andrew Burnside. The Burnside family appears to be centered in St.AndrewÕs Parish. In 1753 Andrew Burnside owned 480 acres in St. AndrewÕs. DorothyÕs baptismal record is preserved in the parish records; that of Mary is not.\n\nThe James Dugue will shows that Andrew and Mary Burnside had a son, Thomas Burnside. Niece Elizabeth Brown is listed with her children, and may be a daughter of the Burnsides, a speculation supported by her naming a son Andrew. Sarah Groves Brown and Dorothy Francis Brown were also children of niece Elizabeth Brown. The will of Mary Burnside, dated 23 Mar 1769, establishes the death of Mary Dugu Burnside, daughter of Peter and Dorothy Dugu (Jamaica Wills Liber 38 Folio 58).\n\nIsaac Dugue\n\nIsaac Dugue is first documented by the St. Julien List;\n\n15. PIERRE DUGU, Isaac Dugue, son frre, et lizabeth Dugu, leur s¾ur, nz  Bsance en Bery, enfans de Jacques Dugu et d'lizabet Dupuy.\n\nIsaac Dugue was the youngest son, a minor at the time his fatherÕs estate was settled in 1696. He was the son of Elizabeth DuPuy Dugu, and was presumably born not too long before his sister Elizabeth, who was born in South Carolina after the familyÕs immigration in 1685. Thus it is reasonable to suppose that Isaac was born in about 1682-4.\n\nIn the settlement of Jacques DuguÕs estate in 1696, Isaac received, with his sister Elizabeth who later married Paul Trapier, Òpart of a town lot in Charles Town, on Broad Street, which James Dugu purchased of James DeBourdeaux, blacksmith, together with the buildings thereon, and £4. 12. 4.Ó\n\nJamaica parish records on IsaacÕs family are incomplete. There is no marriage record. The documentation begins with the christening of a child in 1709:\n\nClarendon Parish Register, Vol. I:\n\np. 27 Elizabeth, daughter of Isaac and Mary Dugue, baptized 27 Dec 1709\n\nThere is then a substantial gap. The next reference is 14 years later, in an adjacent parish:\n\nSt. DorothyÕs Parish Register, Vol. I:\n\np. 3 baptized Grace, daughter of Isaac and Mary Dugue, 5 Apr 1723\n\np. 4 buried Isaac Dugue, 1731\n\np. 7 baptized unnamed daughter of Eleanor Rogers by Hugh Dugue, 24 Oct 1739\n\np. 8 buried Hugh Dugue, 5 Feb 1741\n\np. 13 Grace Dugue married John Skinner 13 Jan 1749\n\np. 14 buried Mary Dugue, widow, age 67, 29 Sep 1749\n\nSt. DorothyÕs Parish was separated from Clarendon Parish in 1696, so the shift in IsaacÕs parishes over the years is not the result of St. DorothyÕs separation from Clarendon Parish. It is possible that loss of records in St. DorothyÕs parish, probably in the hurricane of 1722, led to the gap in recorded baptisms.\n\nWith an interval of 14 years between the documented children, Isaac could easily have had seven or even more children in addition to those shown in the registers. The St. DorothyÕs Parish references to Hugh Dugue confirm the existence of additional children besides those christened in the two parishes.\n\nThe following references from the Kingston Parish, Jamaica, Register document the death of three Dugu sons:\n\nVol. I:\n\np. 3 Dugay, James, buried 3 Nov 1722\n\np. 7 Dugue, Thomas, buried 1 Jan 1723\n\np. 8 Dugue, William, buried 22 Jan 1723\n\nSince James Dugu who died in Jamaica in 1766 was the son of Peter and Dorothy Dugu; the James Dugu who died in 1722 was apparently a son of Isaac Dugu. Thomas and William might have belonged to either brother. It has previously been noted that these deaths probably arose as a consequence of the terrible events of 1722 in Jamaica.\n\nThe following reference shows that in 1724 Isaac sold his interest in property in Charleston to Paul Trapier, who had married his younger sister Elizabeth:\n\nBook D, p. 92, 6 Aug 1724, Deed of Sale. Isaac Dugue, shipwright, to his brother-in-law, Paul Trapier, planter, for £250 SC money, ½ of ¼ of a half town lot in Charleston. Whereas James Dugue Sr., father of Isaac, by will dated 28 May 1686 gave his 5 children, Isaac, Peter, Mary, Judith & Elizabeth, and his granddaughter Mariane Dugue all his real and personal estate, share & share alike; and whereas the estate was duly divided on 27 Oct 1696, among other things allowing Isaac Dugue & his sister Elizabeth (in equal halves) a certain part of a lot in Charleston being ¼ of ½ of 1 town lot fronting to the Broad Street, bounding S on the Broad Street, E on Dr. John Deleaure, W & N on Elizabeth Burtell, which part of a lot their father James had purchased from James Dubourdeaux, blacksmith, on 31 Oct 1687; and whereas Paul Trapier by marrying Elizabeth Dugue became heir to ½ of the ¼ part of the ½ town lot & half the buildings; now Isaac Dugue sells his half to Trapier. Witnesses: James Searon, Peter Herman, Anthony Bonneau, Jr., Before Thomas Hepworth. Jacob Motte, Registrar.\n\nIsaacÕs ownership of the Charleston property in 1724 suggests that he had continuing interests there. However, it is not hard to understand his sale of his interest in 1724. He doubtless needed the money, and a shared interest in Charleston property might have helped his economic recovery. He was apparently present in Charleston for the sale, since he acted on his own behalf. It is likely that there were many visits to Charleston over the years.\n\nAnthony Bonneau, Jr., who was a witness to this 1724 sale of property interest by Isaac Dugu to Paul Trapier, later reappears among the witnesses to the will of John Snow in St. Thomas and St. Denis Parish, along with Thomas Goodman Duke. Bonneau owned land in both St. Johns and St. Thomas and St. Denis parishes, and lived on the Wando River in St. Thomas and St. Denis. This is one of many specific family connections shared by the people named Dugue and Duke in the Charleston area. In 1766, Henry Simons married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Goodman Duke and his wife Susanna. HenryÕs parents were Samuel Dupre Simons and Elizabeth Bonneau, daughter of Anthony Bonneau Sr. and Jeanne Elizabeth Videau. Later, Frances Bonneau of Charleston was a surety for the estate of David Watts, administered by Benjamin Duke, son of Thomas Goodman Duke.\n\nPaul Trapier I did not remain in possession of the Broad St. property very long. In his will dated 15 Jan 1726/27 and probated 10 Nov 1727 he left the property to hi son Paul, a minor at that time. His plantation La Grande Fontaine he left to sons Isaac and Benjamin.\n\nIn 1740 Mary ÒWrightwrickÓ sold land to Mary Dugue: BA Deed for Mary Wrightwrick to Mary Dugue Liber 109 1740 Folio 24. No other Wrightwrick references have been found. LDS has no listings for this name or any close equivalents. However, Wightwick does produce a listing:\n\nJOHNSON, JOHN\n\nSt. Catherine, Planter.\n\nIn 1746 a private act was passed to entitle his reputed daughter Anne and her son Thomas Wightwick to the same rights &c., with English subjects.\n\nA Jacob Johnson married the daughter of John Lawrence of Ironshore. Ironshore was traded to James Irving for land in South Carolina.\n\nIn 1731 there is a deed Mary Dugue to John Jones (Liber 89 Folio 160).\n\nIn 1749 Mary Dugue sold land to James Davidson: FA Deed for Mary Dugue to James Davidson Liber 133 1748 Folio 73.\n\nNo information has been found on a Davidson of the correct time period. A William Davison owned land in St. AndrewÕs Parish in 1670. The estate of a James Davidson was inventoried in St. AnnÕs Parish (1B/11/3/115 Folio 125).\n\nThe will of Mary Dugue identifies her as a widow of St. DorothyÕs Parish. The will was written 14 Jun 1749 and was recorded on 8 Feb 1776 (Liber 43 1776 Folio 22). It mentions daughter Grace wife of John Skinner mariner, who parish records show she married in 1749.\n\nMary also mentions grandsons John Philip Boist and Robert Boist. She also mentions daughter Margaret wife of George Shells Mariner. The Boists may be children of daughter Margaret from a previous marriage. They do not belong to Grace, who married John Skinner as a Dugue and was therefore not previously married.\n\nThe will text is as follows:\n\nDugue, Mary Proved 8th Febry. 1776.1\n\nJamaica Is.\n\nIn the Name of God, Amen. I Mary Dugue of Old Harbour in the parish of St. Dorothy Widow being sick in Body but of sound Mind and Memory do make this my last Will and Testament in Manner and form following.

Both Jacques Dugu and his son James were deceased in 1696. The only later James Dugue who might have had an active real estate interest in Charleston is James, son of Peter and Dorothy Dugue of Jamaica.\n\nTracing the history of the lots in question is greatly complicated by changes in Charleston lot numbers over time, but most later references can be traced to 17th century properties owned by Jacques/James Dugue. On the whole, the references point to the Dugu family (not an 18th century resident named James Dugu, but heirs of the original immigrant Jacques Dugu) retaining property in Charleston through at least the mid-1720Õs, and disposing of most of that property by the mid-1740Õs. So long as the property remained in the family, there seems to have been little effort to update the registered deeds for these properties. The references therefore do not establish that another individual named James Dugue was present in Charleston, but that the family of Peter and Isaac Dugu maintained property in Charleston for decades after their departure for Jamaica.\n\nLot #70/78, Charleston\n\nThe following archival reference states that James Dugue filed a memorial for Lot #70 in Charleston in 1732:\n\nSeries No.: S111001\n\nVolume: 0001\n\nPage: 00156\n\nItem:00\n\nDate: 1732\n\nDescription: DUGUE, JAMES, MEMORIAL FOR A TOWN LOT IN CHARLES TOWN, EXHIBITING A CONVEYANCE DATED APR. 19, 1692 FROM ROBERT SKELTON TO JAMES DUGUE.\n\nNames Indexed: SKELTON, ROBERT/DUGUE, JAMES/\n\nLocations: CHARLESTON/\n\nType: MEMORIAL/CONVEYANCE\n\nThe actual document is the original deed transferring the lot from Skelton to James Dugue. Skelton is identified as a cordwainer. The document bears a date of 1692. It refers to Lot #78 rather than #70. Lot #78 was originally granted to Bernard Schingkingh. The memorial was witnessed by F. Gurard, Wm. White, ?,? and Is. ?. There is no document asserting that the memorial itself was filed in 1732 by anyone named James Dugue, although the archivist indexed the item under that name.\n\nThis is property that was disposed of in Jacque DuguÕs estate settlement in 1696. Lot #70 was inherited by Marianne Dugu, daughter of the then-deceased James Dugue (II) and his wife Marianne Fleury de la Plane Dugu. Marianne Dugu later married Tobias Fitch.\n\nIn 1720 Tobias and Marianne Fitch sold the northern half of #70 to Andrew Dupuy. Dupuy was probably a relative; Jacques DuguÕs second wife was Elizabeth Dupuy.\n\nBook E, p. 136. 11 & as July 1720. Tobias Fitch, planer, & Marianne, his wife, daughter of James Dugue, Mr. & of Dame Marian Henry his wife & granddaughter of James Dugue, Sr., to Andrew Dupuy, merchant, of Charleston, for £200 SC money, the northern half of lot #70 in Charleston, divided in middle of E & W lines, bounding N on Barnard Schenckingh; S on other half; E on west side of a street parallel with Cooper River. Whereas James Dugue, Sr., possessing a good estate & half of lot #70 in Charleston, by will dated 28 May 1696 gave his granddaughter Marianne 1/6 of his real & personal estate ordaining, that should any of his children, under age, should want a division made to obtain his part, the same should proceed by the advice of the majority, the others not to appeal, appointing his son Peter Dugue sole executor; & whereas on 27 Oct. 1696 Peter Dugue, executor, agreed with Samuel Dubondieu, Esq., & Judith his wife, James Dubose and Mary his wife, & Marianne, widow of James Dugue, Jr., on behalf o her daughter Marianne, wife of Tobias Fitch, that Marianne (wife of James Dugue, Jr.,) for her daughter Marianne should take & keep as her share at the expiration of 1-1/2 years, town lot #70; now Fitch sells Dupuy half of lot #70. Witnesses: Robert Hume, William Harvey, John Royer. Before John Croft, M.C. Jacob Motte, Register.\n\nIn this 1720 document, Fitch cites Barnard Schenckingh as adjacent landowner on the north side of the lot in question. Schenckingh was the recipient of the original grant for Lot #78, which seems to have been the earlier designation for this same property. Schenckingh was deceased at this time; there was apparently a tendency not to record deeds showing changes in ownership that arose through inheritance, so that individuals citing adjacent landowners were sometimes decades out of date, the neighboring land having passed through several hands in the same family during the interim. For example, a 1743 deed by Sarah Trott Rhett for Lot #113, located near Lot #70 on the SW corner of Church and Queen streets, identifies Bernard Schenckingh as the owner of the property bounding south on hers (Charleston Deeds Book &, page 506). Not only was Schenckingh deceased at this time, but the will of his son and heir, Benjamin Schenckingh, had been probated in 1733. In contrast, RhettÕs deed identifies her neighbor on the west as ÒRichard Beresford (formerly Bernard Schenckingh). In that case, there was a sale outside the family, and a new deed was registered. This practice recurs many times in reviewing Charleston properties belonging to the Dugu family.\n\nThe location of Lot #70 is pertinent to interpreting some later references. Two transactions in 1766 place James Dugue adjacent Charleston Lot #31:.\n\nÒBook E-3, p. 773. 16 & 17 June 1766 Daniel Ravenel, planter, of St. JohnÕs Parish, & Charlotte, his wife, 1 of the daughters of Paul Mazyck of Charleston; to Benjamin Mazyck, Esq. of Charleston, for £1000 SC money, half of lot #31 in Charleston, bounding S 53 ft. on Broad Street; N on James Dugue; E n Peter de St. Julien; W on other half formerly belonging to Edward Rawlins; which lot #31 Paul Mazyck had purchased from Isaac Mazyck, of Charleston . . . Ò\n\nAnd also,\n\nBook F-3, p. 19. 17 & 18 July 1766 Benjamin Mazyck of Charleston, to Daniel Ravenel, planter, of St. Johns Parish, for £1000 currency, half of lot #31 in Charleston, bounding N on James Dugue, S 53 ft. on Broad Street; E on Peter de St. Julien; W on other half belonging to Edward Rawlings; which lot #31 was purchased by Paul Mazyck from Isaac Mazyck, . . .Ó\n\nIt can be shown that the location referenced by the name James Dugue in this document is Lot #70, inherited by the Fitches from Jacques Dugu.\n\nThe early plan of Charleston shows two lots #30. One fronts on Broad St. just below Lot #28 at the corner of Broad and Church streets. This Lot #30 has a Lot #31 immediately to the north. The other Lot #30 fronts on Broad St. a block farther west, east of an open market area that is a continuation of Meeting St. and also east of the SW corner of property labelled ÒMrs. Cross 3 Lots.Ó It has been found that the Lot #31 to which Mazyck and Ravenel refer above is in fact the one shown as Lot # 30 adjacent the market area and Mrs. CrossÕ three lots. This Lot #30 was originally granted to Edward Rawlings. His widow, Susannah Rawlings Wigginton, sold the western part of this lot to Royer in 1742:\n\nSeries Number: S372001\n\nVolume: 00X0\n\nPage: 00230\n\nItem: 00\n\nDate: 1742\n\nDescription: WIGGINTON, SUSAN AND OTHERS TO JOHN ROYERS, LEASE AND RELEASE FOR PART OF LOT NO. 30 IN CHARLESTOWN.\n\nNames Indexed: WIGGINTON, SUSAN/ROYERS, JOHN/HEPWORTH, THOMAS/HEPWORTH, ANNE/BLAMYER, MARY/RAWLINGS, EDWARD/\n\nLocations: CHARLESTON/\n\nType: LEASE AND RELEASE/\n\nTopics: TOWN LOT SALES/\n\nThe following are some other transactions relevant to establishing the property in this location:\n\nOn 15 and 16 Sep 1719, Book X, page 230, ÒSusannah Wigginton, (formerly wife of Edward Rawlings) of 1st part; Thomas Hepworth, Esq., and & Anne his wife, Mary Blamyer, widow; & Edward Rawlings, joiner; Anne, Mary & Edward being children of Edward Rawlings, Sr., of 2nd part; John Royer, cordwainer, of 3rd part; all of Charleston. Whereas Edward Rawlings, Sr., by will dated 24 Sept. 1699 bequested to his loving wife Susannah all his real & personal estate for her natural life, with power to dispose of the estate for her maintenance & the bringing up of their children; & whereas she has agreed to sell John Royer half of lot #30 for £160 currency towards her maintenance . . . now Susannah Wigginton sells to Royer, for £160 currency, half of lot #30, fronting S 53 ft. on Broad Street, bounding E 187 ft. on Isaac Mazyck; W on vacant land laid out for a market.Ó\n\nOn 7 and 8 Mar 1721, Charleston Deeds Book Bb, p. 11, Edward Rawlings and his wife Mary sold to Robert Hume 1/3 part of 3 lots in Charleston willed by Mary Cross to William Bailey, Susannah Rawlings & Mary Basden Òfronting N on a street leading E from Cooper River by Messrs. Gibbon & Allen (Queen St.) 2/3 parts of the whole front of said 3 lots on said street; S on Peter Manigault Òas now fenct inÓ & on Tobias Fitch; W on other parts said 3 lots; E on Richard Beresford Esq. (formerly Mr. Jackson).Ó\n\nOn 11 Jan 1723 Susannah Rawlings Wiginton sold to Robert Hume part of 3 lots Òfronting N 100 ft. on a street running from Cooper River by the lots of Gibbon & Allen [Queen]; the depths back from N to S the whole depth of the 3 lots from N to S except 201 feet fenced in by Peter Manigault; bounding E on other part of the 3 lots belong to Susannah Wigonton; W on a street parallel with Cooper River toward the Presbyterian Meeting house.Ó\n\nOn 23 and 24 Jul 1725, Book D, page 313, Peter and Anne Manigault sold to John Laurens Ò1/2 part of 3 lots near the market place in Charleston which were devised by Mary Cross . . . Òbounding S on market place; W on the street per fortifications; N on remaining part of the 3 lots now in possession of Edward Rollings; E on lots #30 & #69 & formerly known by #59 in model & records of Charleston.Ó\n\nOn 16 and 17 Dec 1731, Book I, page 600, Susannah Wigington (formerly Susannah Rawlings, widow of Edward Rawlings, vintner) to Robert Hume, gentleman, . . . 1/6 part of 3 lots in Charleston, given by Mary Cross . . . fronting N 50 ft. on a street leading from Cooper River b y lots formerly belonging to Messrs. Gibbon & Allen, now to Mssrs. Tonnerville, Ellery, Cooper, & Capt. Warden; bounding S on land formerly belonging to Peter Manigault, now to Laurens or Bonneau & on Dupey [Dupuy] (formerly Tobias Fitch).Ó\n\nOn 13 and 14 Apr 1737, Book S, page 57, John Beresford sold to John Bee the W part of lot #90, fronting 32 ft 7 in on S side of Queen St, running the whole depth of the lot; also lot #70 lying S of the above lot, the 2 parts of lots making 2 long square 32 ft 6 in and from Queen St. running S to lot of Mrs. Dupuy; bounding E on John Beresford, W on John Bee.\n\nAfter a recitation of the history of the three lots willed to Mary Cross, Book C-C, page 204, Alexander Hume on 23 and 24 Oct 1746 conveyed to Benjamin DÕHarriette the N half of the three lots of Mary Cross.\n\nOn 10 and 11 Oct 1753, Book O-O, page 640, Benjamin de St. Julien, gentleman. . . to Elizabeth de St. Julien . . . Òthe E half of lot #56 in Charleston, bounding S 47 ½ ft. on Broad Street; N & W on Isaac MazyckÕs lots; E on estate of Joseph de St. Julien. Whereas the Lords Propres. On 24 Apr. 1683 granted John Palmer, Jr., lot #56 on N side of Broad St, & whereas the E half of the lot by various mesne conveyances became the property of Peter de St. Julien; . . .Ó\n\nThen, in 1756 Gabriel Manigault, Alexander Broughton, & Peter Manigault, executors of the will of Benjamin DÕHarriette, sold to Walter Izard the N division of 3 lots in Charleston, bounding N 150 ft. on Queen Street; W on John Bee; S on 197 ft. on a private alley (formerly Anthony Bonneau).Ó\n\nAltogether, these references place the lot attributed to James Dugue in 1766 east of the three lots granted to Mrs. Cross, north of Isaac Mazyck, west of land earlier in the possession of Edward Rawlings (and later others such as Robert Hume, Peter Manigault, and John Laurens), and NW of Peter St. Julien, who was in Lot #56. It also places this property in the approximate location of Lot #70, which Marianne Dugue Fitch and her husband Tobias Fitch inherited from Jacques [James] Dugue, and indicates that the property was between Broad and Church streets, and east of Meeting St.\n\nThe portion of Lot #70 sold by Beresford to John Bee in 1731, bounding south on Mrs. Dupuy, would have been the northernmost part of the portion of the lot that was purchased by Jacques Dugu, which was previously sold by Fitch to Andrew Dupuy. Mrs. Dupuy (or her heirs) apparently retained the remainder of the northern part of #70.\n\nThe original bill of sale between Skelton and Dugu, preserved as the memorial filed in 1733, appears to refer to transfer of the whole of Lot #78 to Dugu. The papers related to the disposition of the estate of Jacques Dugu refer to the property only as Lot #70, without evidence of partition. The documentation of the sale between Fitch and Dupuy similarly implies that a northern portion of the property was retained by Fitch. However, later evidence of Fitch ownership of that property has not yet been found in the available records.\n\nEastern Broad Street Area: Lot #28\n\nThere was on 14 Jun 1739 a lease and release transaction (Charleton Deeds Book T, p. 77) involving a parcel on the north side of Broad Street owned by Margaret Nicholl Ramsey, widow of John Ramsey. She was transferring her dower interest in the property to her son-in-law, John Crockatt. The lot became CrockattÕs residence. The document asserts that ÒWhereas John Ramsay owned part of a lot in Charleston fronting 26-1/2 ft. on the N side of Broad Street, bounding W 102 ft. on Mr. Dugue; E on Timothy Bellamy; N on Mrs. Brutell ; . .Ó\n\nThe neighbor mentioned in this first transaction, ÒMrs. BrutellÓ, was Elizabeth (Mrs. Peter) Burtell. An adjacent lot to the north, No. 29, had been granted to Peter Burtell on 9 May 1694. In 1687 Burtell also purchased the northern half of Lot No. 28 at the corner of Broad and Church streets, which was originally granted to Joseph West. WestÕs portion was later at least in part held by Timothy Bellamy (WestÕs wife was a Bellamy) and was subdivided a number of times.\n\nPeter Burtell was an elder of the Huguenot Church who, along with one of the Dugus, protested to the Lords Proprietors regarding discrimination against Huguenots by the locals in South Carolina. In 1701 Peter Burtell died and his estate devolved to his heirs, including his wife Elizabeth and daughter Marie Elizabeth, who married Alexander Thesee de Chastaiger. The Chastaiger children, Alexander Thesee (who married Susanna Elizabeth LeNoble), Magdalene Elizabeth (who married Henry Izard), and Henrietta Charlotte (who married Nathaniel Broughton), were involved in subsequent transactions regarding the property.\n\nProperty within the southern half of #28, not purchased by Burtell, appeared in the 1725 will of Timothy Bellamy; Joseph WestÕs wife was Mary Bellamy.\n\nHicks summarized the early history of lots #28 and #29:\n\nÒ28. 1682. Joseph West. Joseph West #28. Will of Timothy Bellamy. [Note: the widow, Mary Bellamy, md. Miles Brewton.] In 1687, Joseph West deeded ½ of lot 28 to Peter Burtell. Peter Burtell by will 1601 bequeathed the estate (after the death of his wife Elizabeth) to be divided equally among his 3 grandchildren, Alexander Chastaigner (father of Catharine wife of Paul Mazyck), Magdalain Elizabeth Chastaigner (wife of Ralph Izard), & Charlotte Henrietta Chastaigner (wife of Nathanial Broughton).\n\n29. 1694. Peter Buretell/Burtell/Bruttell. In 1735 Ralph Izard and Magdalaine Elizabeth his wife, one of the grandda. & devisees of Peter Burtell, merchant; Nathanial Broughton and Charlotta Henrietta his wife, another granddau. & devisee of Peter Burtell; Paul Mazyck & Catharina his wife, gr granddau. Of Peter Burtell & only dau. & heir at law of Alexander Chastainger, grandson of one of the devisees of Peter Burtell – sold to Paul Jenys ½ of lot 28 and all of lot 29 [Charleston Deed Q:146].Ó\n\nA 1745 transaction by Mary Bellamy clarifies the partitioning of Lot #28 to some extent:\n\nBook B-B, p. 386, 5 Mar 1745 Feoffment. Mary Brewton, widow of Miles Brewton, gentleman, of Charleston (lately Mary Bellamy), to Mathew Roche, merchant of Charleston, for £2000 SC money, & other considerations, all her claim to that part of lot #28 with the tenement thereon, adjoining the dwelling house where Timothy Bellamy, her late husband, lived, bounding E 100 Ft. on said dwelling house now owned by Mathew Roche; W on John CrockattÕs house (formerly Mrs. Catherine Leporter, then of Dr. John Delaune); N on the heirs of Mr. Jenys (formerly Madam Bretell); S 34 ft. on Broad St. Whereas Timothy Bellamy, merchant of Charleston, by will dated 25 Feb 1725 devised to his wife, Mary during her natural life, that part of lot #28 adjoining his dwelling house, with the tenement then to be built on the lot, & after her death to his daughter Ann Bellamy, now wife of Mathew Roche; now she releases her claim to Roche. Witnesses: John Rattray, James Grindlay. Witnesses to livery & seizing: Alexander Livie, John Rattray, James Grindlay. Before Jacob Motte, J.P. James Home, Publ Reg.\n\nSo, the 1739 Ramsey document shows John Crockatt becoming the owner of a lot bounding west on a portion of Lot#28 that belonged to James Dugue. The Crockatt residence was bounded north on Madam Brutell and later on Mr. Jenys and east on Timothy Bellamy. The 1745 Mary Bellamy Brewton document indicates that John CrockettÕs house was previously the property of Mrs. Catherine Leporter (LaPostre) and then of Dr. John Delaune before Crockett. She doesnÕt mention the Ramseys as earlier owners.\n\nIn Charleston Dee"
