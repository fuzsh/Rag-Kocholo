        "text": "Jonathan Botros, a native Lubbockite and two-time graduate of Texas Tech University, was named Deputy Athletics Director in June 2023 where he oversees the day-to-day operations of the athletics department as the second in command to Director of Athletics Kirby Hocutt.\n\nIn his role, Botros is the department’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) and has helped oversee the development of Texas Tech’s facility projects, namely the $240 million south end zone and Dustin R. Womble Football Center addition to Jones AT&T Stadium. He also serves as the sport supervisor for both the Red Raider football and men’s basketball programs.\n\nBotros was elevated to his new role after joining the athletics department in May 2016 as Senior Associate Athletics Director and chief financial officer. During that time, Botros helped Texas Tech navigate one of the largest periods of budgetary growth in its history with its budget rising to more than $128 million for the 2024-25 academic year, the highest in school history.\n\nA major point of emphasis for Botros has been the strategic management of Texas Tech's facilities debt as he helped decrease $115 million in debt upon his arrival in 2016 down to $50 million in only five years. That plan has been carried out simultaneously with the development of capital projects to construct more than $300 million dollars in new athletics facilities, namely the Sports Performance Center, the Dustin R. Womble Basketball Center, the Cash Family Sports Nutrition Center, a new baseball team clubhouse at Rip Griffin Park and now the south end zone and Dustin R. Womble Football Center.\n\nAs part of his CFO duties, Botros had oversight over the department’s accounts receivable, purchasing and procurement, contracting, human resources, financial reporting and travel. He was also responsible for the development and monitoring of all capital project funding plans and served as the liaison to Texas Tech’s Office of General Counsel, Office of Audit Services and the University’s Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance.\n\nIn addition to his role as CFO, Botros oversaw the departments of information technology, facilities and game operations as well as equipment operations and the athletics department’s relationship with The Rawls Course. He also served a lengthy tenure as the sport administrator for a Texas Tech track and field program that captured multiple Big 12 titles and won the 2019 NCAA Men’s Outdoor National Championship.\n\nBotros moved to the athletics department after previously serving as the managing director for administration and finance information systems management for Texas Tech University. In this role, Botros also served as a business management analyst for Texas Tech University's Chief Financial Officer, Noel Sloan.\n\nBotros earned a bachelor’s of business administration in marketing from Texas Tech University in 2004. He added a master’s of business administration in finance in 2010.\n\nBotros, a lifelong supporter of Texas Tech Athletics, resides in Lubbock with his wife, Danna, and their two sons, Kannan and Lincoln."
