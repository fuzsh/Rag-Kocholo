        "text": "The Church on the Hill (1676-1715)\n\nFrom 1660 to 1675 the members of Rev. Fitch’s congregation met in a building at the southeast corner of the Norwichtown Green, near the residences of Rev. Fitch and Major John Mason. “This was probably a plain, rough, barn-like structure without steeple, porch, or gallery. In 1668, a rate was collected to pay Samuel Lathrop, for repairing and heightening it.” .\n\nIn 1673 the town contracted with John Elderkin and Samuel Lathrop to build a new house of worship. The site chosen was on the hill, overlooking the greater part of the community. The hill’s steep, rocky ledge is known today as “Meeting House Rocks”. The present-day First Congregational Church, dedicated into service on June 18, 1801, is located at the base of the Meeting House Rocks.\n\nAt this time, just before King Philip’s War, when Indian attacks were constantly expected, it is believed that the townspeople thought this lofty site, commanding an extensive outlook, might serve as a watch tower, garrison post, and as a house of worship. So great was the dread of Indian invasions that, that the settlers carried their muskets to church and stacked them outside. A guard was set to watch and the militia sat near the door to be ready in case of alarm.\n\nThe “Church On the Hill” was completed in 1675. Its estimated cost was 428 pounds sterling ($101,500 in today’s dollars). However, upon completion of the project John Elderkin claimed that the building expenses had much exceeded this sum. The town gave him a grant of land to compensate him for the cost overrun.\n\nIn the winter time, when the winds howled and whistled around this church in its exposed position, hot cold and cheerless it must have been, and how little could have availed the foot-muffs and heated stones to keep the congregation warm.\n\nRev. Fitch’s congregation was seated in pews according to Rank. There were eight classes of “dignity”.\n\nIn 1689 a lean-to was added to the building and several new pews were added. Later in 1705 new clapboards and shingles were added and in 1708 a bell was suspended from a scaffolding on the ridge west of the meeting house. In 1709-1710 it was voted to build a new meeting house. The new meeting house, also built on the hill, was completed in 1713 and the old “Church on the Hill” was sold in 1714-1715 to Nathaniel Rudd of West Farms (present-day Franklin, CT).\n\n(Info Source 2)"
