        "text": "Jedidiah Fitch was born on 17 Apr 1681, Norwich, New London Co., CT [882,1506,1507] and died on 20 Nov 1756, Nantucket, Nantucket Cty, MA [882,1507]\n\nParents: Maj. James Fitch (1649-1727) and Elizabeth Mason (1654-1684)\n\nJedediah Fitch moved to Nantucket about 1706 and married Abigail Coffin, the daughter of Peter Coffin and Elizabeth Starbuck. Through her, their descendants are related in some fashion to virtually everyone of importance in early Nantucket history.\n\nMarried:\n\non 13 Sep 1701, Newbury, Essex Co., MA [882,1507,878] to Abigail Coffin (1683-1736) [882], daughter of Peter Coffin (1660-1699) and Elizabeth Starbuck (1665-)\n\nChildren\n\nPeter Fitch was born in 1706. He married Rachel Chase on February 18, 1731/32. Rachel was a daughter of James and Rachel Chase. He died January 21, 1793 and she died March 23, 1801. Their children were: Peter who married Anna Gardner, Rachel who married Joseph Glazier, Seth who died as a child, Benjamin who married Anna Osborne, Abigail who married Thomas Gwinn, Ebenezer who married Abigail Gardner, Sally who married Samuel Palmer and later Samuel Osborn and Latham Barker, James who married Judith Bunker and Coffin who was single and died at sea.\n\nMary Fitch was born on August 22, 1708. She married Thomas Bailey on June 5, 1729. She died April 21, 1794.\n\nElizabeth Fitch was born in 1703. She was married to Ebenezer Calfe (Calif) on June 8, 1722 and she died on July 22, 1777.\n\nBeriah Fitch was born on Nantucket on October 30, 1713. He married Deborah Gorham on December 11, 1735 and died on May 4, 1785.\n\nthe most troublesome of the family to figure out\n\nJedidiah Fitch was the eldest surviving son of Major James Fitch and Elizabeth Mason Fitch. He is the most troublesome of the family to figure out. All his brothers were soldiers fighting Indians and such. As a young teenager, Jed moved to the north shore of Massachusetts and settled in Newbury, and then later went to Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts. Nantucket was a Quaker colony at the time and in 1701 he married into an established Quaker family. His father had been quite friendly with the local Indians, the Mohegans and Pequots, yet fought against other tribes. Perhaps Jedediah became a pacifist and wanted no part of fighting the Indians he grew up with and so left for Nantucket. Perhaps he\n\nsimply wanted to go to sea. (Pullman)\n\nNotes for Jedidiah Fitch\n\nHe was said to \"res. Canterbury, Windham Co., CT, rem. abt. 1706-7, Nantucket, Nantucket Co., MA; res.

His on Beriah's marks were the same except for the addition of a half penny over the right ear as well.
