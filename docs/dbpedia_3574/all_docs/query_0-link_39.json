Our Beloved Franky ? ? 67 Unknowns\n\nPossible Error in Peter Parsons data:\n\nThe information above: Peter Parsons under Congregational Cemetery Maplestreet/Institute st Town of Franklin.\n\nThe transcription states Age 31 Died 12 Sept 1844.\n\nMy family Records list a Peter Parsons, Son (and 7th child) of Moses Parsons and Hannah Stebbins\n\nBorn 8 Feb 1752 at Enfield Ct. Died 12 Sept 1814 at Franklin, Delaware County New York.\n\nI have searched extensively through the Delaware county cemetery records and there is only one Peter Parsons listed. The town, county, day and month match up. The year and age however are a discrepancy. I tend to believe the 1844 date is in error and should be 1814.\n\nBest Regards, Don Parsons\n\nCorrections received from Vernon W. Becvar\n\nHUSTED, Joseph died in 1839, aged 73.\n\nVARNEY, Lovina died in 1834, aged 63.\n\nThey have a monument in Long Flats Cemetery and I have a snapshot of it.\n\nCorrections received from Marsha Clark, September 25, 1998 for the Brisack Cemetery"
