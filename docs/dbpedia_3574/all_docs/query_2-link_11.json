        "text": "A Comparative Analysis of the John and Barbara Fitch Family Records:A Case Study in the Reconciliaton of Conflicting Data, by Charles Ward\n\nJohn Fitch was born about the year 1760 in New Jersey the son of Samuel Fitch (b.1719) and his wife, Jane Johnson.Samuel Fitch left New Jersey and established himself in Berkeley Co., VA (now WV) by the 1770s.Samuel Fitch was the son of Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1685) who had left Connecticut for New Jersey as a young man where he married Sarah (Hull) Carle, a young widow and a granddaughter of The Reverend Joseph Hull.Daniel Fitch was the illegitimate son of Captain Daniel Fitch, not to be confused with his legitimate son of that name.Captain Daniel Fitch (1665-1711) was the son of The Reverend James Fitch (1622-1702) and his second wife, Priscilla Mason, daughter of Major John Mason.The Rev. James Fitch left England and settled in the colony of Connecticut in 1638.\n\nJohn Fitch served in the Revolutionary War and settled in what is now Sullivan Co., TN before Tennessee became a state.He married Barbara Waddell 11 Aug 1795 and had a large family.They resided on land adjacent to Reedy Creek (Sullivan Co., TN Deed Bk 11, p. 322).John Fitch died 11 Apr 1840 in Sullivan County.\n\nTwo separate family records exist which provide accounts of the family of John Fitch (c1760-1840) and his wife, Barbara (Waddell) Fitch, of Sullivan County, Tennessee.\n\nThe family record preserved by the descendants of their grandson, Isaac Fitch (1828-1879), of Roane County, Tennessee dates from the early nineteenth century.All entries appear to have been entered in the same hand, at the same time, the last date being the birth of Peter Fitch on 6 Apr 1812.It is written on a single page with entries given on both sides of the page and was damaged in a fire around 1917.There may have been additional pages that accompanied it which are now lost.Photocopies of the family record were obtained by the author from Mrs. Maggie (Ward) Webster, of Meigs County, Tennesee, a great-granddaughter of Isaac Fitch (1828-1879) and previously had been owned by her sister, Nancy Ward.The original family record may have passed to their sister, Mrs. Edna (Ward) Heird, of Maryville, Tennessee, now deceased, who is also said to have inherited a trunk containing family papers and other items relating to the Fitch family. The present whereabouts of this family record are unknown.\n\nhttp://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/fitch/2055/"
