FITCH Family: Willingales Doe and Spain

I am seeking any info on the baptism/birth place of Samuel FITCH (born about 1750-55) in Essex. He was living in Willingale Spain when he married Mary SKINGLEY (sometimes SKINGLE) in Writtle in 1775. Mary (born Roxwell 1757) was a resident of Writtle at the time of marriage. Samuel and Mary lived in Willingale Spain. Their children were all baptised there: Mary - 1775, George - 1777, Samuel 1780-1789, William 1782 (died in early childhood but burial place not known), Jane - 1783, William (2) - 1786, Elizabeth 1788-1789. Samuel and his children Samuel and Elizabeth died in 1789 in Willingale Spain and were buried as paupers. Wife Mary remarried (to Daniel SKINGLEY - possibly related) in 1791. Samuel's social situation (agricultural labourer) and circumstances of burial suggest that he is not related to the wealthy FITCH family of nearby Blackmore (a couple of Samuels baptised there were candidates). I have also ruled out Samuel born Foulness in the 1750s. Samuel FITCH born Marks Tey, and another born Sible Headingham, in the 1750s are possibilities. I would be grateful if anyone has any info which could shed some light on 'my' Samuel. Doe

I have just uncovered some Doe relatives from Willingale, on some census returns they name it as Willingale Doe,I was wondering who was named after who? I would be interested in any feedback. Also where does the Spain come from? PERRY family

I have PERRY ancestors from Willingale, but as this seems to be a common name on the census, cannot find which ones they are! My rellie was ELIZABETH PERRY born c.1823 Willingale Doe, daughter, LOUISA born 1843, but I cannot find a father for Louisa. Chipperfield

After leaving Good Easter and Roxwell,John and Emma (Prentice) CHIPPERFIELD moved to Willingale Spain in 1884, and their daughter Mary Ann May ( b. 1891) , and sons Edward George (b. 1884) and Ernest Henry (1886-1894) were born there. Emma died there in 1897, and by 1901 John was living in Stratford with is oldest daughter Elizabeth Rust,and another couple of his many children, but no sign of Edward George who would have been about 17 on census night.Is anybody tracing this family?
