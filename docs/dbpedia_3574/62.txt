DEATH OF MRS. SAM FITCH.

Mrs. Samuel {Elizabeth} Fitch died at her home in West Salt Creek Monday, May 14, and was buried May 15. She was laid to rest in Bethel cemetery, where one of her children is buried. Mrs. Fitch was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. G. Meyers, her father having preceded her in death by only four months. She was 32 years of age and had lived in Leavenworth county all her life.

Mrs. Fitch had suffered from inflammation of the bowels since last Thursday, and it was only on Sunday that fatal results were feared.

She leaves her husband and six children: Bottie, Ralph, Anna, Mabel, Elmer and Dorothy; her mother; two sisters; and five brothers besides other relatives; and a large circle of friends to mourn her loss.

Mrs. Fitch was a true Christian woman, a true wife, and a good mother. And the only consolation we can have is that we hope to meet in that home where no tears are shed. The family has the heartfelt sympathy of the entire community.
