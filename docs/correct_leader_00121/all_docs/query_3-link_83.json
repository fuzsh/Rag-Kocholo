        "text": "By far, the greatest and startling religious news of this century from East Africa has been the unravelling of the complicated process towards canonization and possible papal declaration of Julius Nyerere, a Catholic saint. Both the political and religious worlds have joined ranks to make sure that the former president of Tanzania is beatified, an intriguing event surrounded by controversy. This paper reports in detail the core values and contribution to Tanzania’s nation building efforts of this exceptional African statesman but questions his proposed candidacy for sainthood.\n\nThere are a number of positive ideals about Mwalimu Julius Nyerere in the literatures. His ideals includes among others his devotion for peace, security, unity and democracy. However, the ideals do not limit the visibility of his negative traits. This paper specially examines the criticisms against Nyerere. The paper looks at the portrayal of Nyerere in number literatures from his critics. It examines the literatures against Nyerere in number of issues including his role in the decolonization struggle, the situation of democracy and individual freedom during his reign and his position towards Islamic religion and Zanzibar revolution. The paper establishes that most of criticisms against Nyerere are not refuted because supporters and critics talk about different things. Whereas his supporters put forward his role in building the nation, critics focus his in his economic failure and deprivation of individual freedom in Tanzania.\n\nSince the 2000s, Tanzania has witnessed the return in the public sphere of a reconfigured version of Ujamaa as a set of moral principles embodied in the figure of the first president of Tanzania, Julius Kambarage Nyerere. The persisting traces of Nyerere and Ujamaa are not so evident in actual political practices or economic policies, but rather in collective debates about politics and morality—in short, in contemporary imaginaries of the nation. Contributing to a long-standing discussion of the moral stature of Tanzania’s “father of the nation,” the article explores how and why a shared historical memory of Nyerere is being built or contested to define, mediate, and construct Tanzanian conceptions of morality, belonging, and citizenship in the polis today.\n\nThe postcolonial media system of Tanzania initially operated under the literally monopoly structure of government and party. The Single party ordination was concocted into a democratic and revolutionary platform to concentrate the nation building scheme over ethnic division in Tanzania. In the new era of African independence states, the Western-model of capitalist scenery was reasoned unconducive over emerging self-governing African countries. As a point of departure, Tanzania embarked to African Socialism (Ujamaa) ethos to appeal all peripheral communities vis-à-vis the conception of nation building. This Afrocentric modality entailed centrally planned economic transition in which the media regulation evolved keen on the dominant one-party political philosophy to streamline the communal life in accordance with the precolonial African values living in cooperation, collectivism, egalitarianism and obligation to work, tracing the rural development paradigm meant for villagesation. Ujamaa government Tanzania-ize and Socialize the media system through distinctive content regulations, nationalization, centralization and de facto media policies in respect of propagating the socialist ideology across the natives. The utilization of national language Kiswahili was ideal to crackdown the colonial mass communication systems in preference to Afrocentric media typology to generate the common culture and identity. Thus far, the prevailing command economy couldn't let the private media ownership flourish, until 1980s when the market economic system in proportion of the IMF/WB structural programs spurred the national financial adjustment across the social institutions including media sector. Along with 1990s, state transformation to multiparty politics commonly nurtured the media structure in the hands of multi privately ownership suppressing the government monopoly.\n\nThe paper attempted to study the Current Trends of Education Reform in Tanzania. The purpose of the study was to find out the current trends and reform of Education in Tanzania. The problem statement is about the current trends of education reform in Tanzania. Since the Ujamaa Philosophy, and its pertinent Education for Self Reliance Policy impacted so much in all aspects of development; political, economic, social, health, education etc for half a century, the hypothesis is: The historical background of education in Tanzania is strongly based on the legacy of Mwalimu Nyerere's philosophy of education and policy, are the current trends in education reform in Tanzania still standing on this foundation? The significance of the study is that, it will draw the attention of readers, especially educational policy makers and planners, educators and stake holders to apply and maintain the values of Nyerere's education philosophy. The review of related literature was done using internet journal articles and electronic book research. Most of the sources reviewed are current with details difficult to find in hard copies in the Library. The study employed Internet Research Methodology using journal articles and electronic books as tools and sources at the same time. Supported by these sources, the study found out that quality education now is for the rich few; and currently Tanzania is drifting to the right and embracing Capitalism – the reason behind mushrooming of expensive private schools that only children of the rich few can afford."
