        "text": "Dean Deborah Prothrow-Stith\n\nDean Barry Bloom\n\nDr. Julius Richmond\n\nAmbassador Mustafa Nyanga’anyi -Tanzanian Ambassador to the U.S.A.\n\nSheila Violet Makate Sisulu – Ambassador to the United States\n\nIt’s a pleasure and honor for me to be present at the Julius Richmond Award Dinner when Julius Nyerere is the man to whom we are paying special homage.\n\nOur host, Julius Richmond, is the man I personally chose to be the first Director of “Head Start”. Most people today know that “Head Start” has become a multi-billion dollar successful, national program here in the U.S.A. But what they don’t know is the fact that Julius Richmond said “yes” to my invitation to help me create “Head Start” when the total budget was about $15 million dollars. Sure, I was able to add increments of ten to twenty million dollars, almost weekly, to our original budget. So, the final budget in the first year of “Head Start” was about $70 million dollars. I loved it and so did Julius Richmond because it worked fabulously well and we ran it nation-wide before Congress ever approved or financed it!!\n\nToday, no one could get away with such shenanigans, but Julius Richmond and I, along with scores of Volunteers, did exactly that. We ran a Federal Government program costing about $70 million before Congress ever approved it!\n\nThose were the good old days!\n\nOver in Africa, Julius Nyerere did just about the same things – courageously, imaginatively, and successfully.\n\nIt was an unforgettable joy to work with him and for him! He was one of the first foreign leaders to endorse “The Peace Corps”. I’ll never forget meeting with him in Dar-Es-Salaam. He didn’t know me and I didn’t know him!! But I truthfully report that it took about fifteen minutes for us to agree that Peace Corps Volunteers would be extremely helpful to Tanganyika (that was the name of Tanzania back in 1961!). Within days a Peace Corps Expert was sent by us with President Nyerere’s approval to work out the details. The net result was direct and simple: -- 50 Peace Corps Volunteers were selected, trained and sent to Tanganyika by early September 1961... Again before our U.S. Congress ever approved the Program, legally or financially!\n\nWell, yes, those were “the good old days”! But they were good almost exclusively because heroic and visionary leaders like Julius Nyerere instantaneously recognized the originality and usefulness of the Peace Corps to them and to their countrymen.\n\nAnother anecdote about Nyerere will suffice, I believe, to reveal his spirit.\n\nLate in the 1960’s, about 1965 or 1966, I had the good fortune to visit Tanganyika again, when it had become Tanzania. Nyerere asked me to visit the newest addition to his country, the island of Zanzibar. I did so, returned to Nyerere’s Headquarters and gave him my report. He was pleased, I believe, by what I told him. Two days later, when I was still in Tanzania, I visited their new Art Gallery. I loved their sculptures. I tried to buy one which I thought was truly beautiful. I got nowhere. The Gallery Officials, calmly and emphatically, told me that none of the objects in their Museum were for sale at any price. I apologized for my mistake in seeking to buy the sculpture I liked so much.\n\nTwo days later I was packing to leave Tanzania when a government official came to my hotel. He told me that the President had ordered him to come and oversee, so to speak, my transportation to the airport, my dealings with the officials, and all other matters involved with my departure. I thanked him profusely for his presence and assistance packed my belongings and went downstairs to take a car to the airport.\n\nTo my surprise there was a Tanzanian Government car waiting to take me to the airport. I gratefully thanked the Government official and jumped in the car to make the trip to the airport. When we got there and I unloaded my baggage, the Government official handed me a huge carton, a present, he told me, from President Nyerere. I thanked him, of course, and then he said: --\n\n“Mr. Shriver, in this carton is the big sculpture you liked so much yesterday in our National Museum. President Nyerere gives it to you in thanks for all the good things you have done for our country, -- Tanzania!!”\n\nI nearly dropped dead. But I was overjoyed. That sculpture has been in the living room of my home ever since. I often explain that it epitomizes the generosity of the best African leaders and reveals the extraordinary talents of their people, -- both at the same time! Generosity, coupled with creative talent! That’s the heart of Tanzania! That was the unique competence of Julius Nyerere. Would that every nation, rich or poor, had leaders equal to Julius Nyerere! Then we would all be safer, happier, and wealthier. What a World that would be!!!!\n\nTwenty-six years later, President Nyerere stepped forward again and embraced the ideals of the new Special Olympics Movement. He clearly had the vision that Special Olympics would have a favorable impact upon countless families and would improve the lives of Tanzania’s citizens with mental handicap.\n\nAs usual, he was correct, and as always he was ready and able to organize a new initiative.\n\nIn 1984, a young scholar by the name of N’nyapule Madai was presented a JPK scholarship to study in the U.S. – Julius Nyerere gave him that scholarship. Madai successfully completed two years of study at the University of Minnesota and returned home to establish a Special Olympics Coordinating committee. The first Tanzanian National Special Olympics Games were held in 1987, qualifying four Tanzanian athletes to compete at the 1987 World Summer Game.\n\nUnder Madai’s leadership, the Special Olympics Tanzania Program has been extended to all regions of the country – reaching more than 2200 athletes today. National Games are held every two years, with regional competitions being held in between.\n\nSpecial Olympics Tanzania has taken a leadership role in educating family members about the health and well being of persons with mental retardation. The first ever, “Families Outreach Seminar” was hosted by Special Olympics Tanzania and resulted in highly successful families programs.\n\nIn 1996, in honor of its 10th Anniversary, Special Olympics Tanzania hosted a regional training, seminar in long-distance running. Eight countries sent Special Olympics athletes to the 10th Anniversary National Games! My son and CEO of Special Olympics, Timothy Shriver, had the honor of attending these Games and were very moved by the spirit of friendship and of people working together.\n\nMohammed Issa highlighted the success of the long- distance running program by winning a gold medal in the half-marathon competition at the 19999 World Summer Games held in North Carolina. He exemplifies the ideals of Special Olympics proving that persons with mental handicap can achieve remarkable success in athletics. He is an outstanding role model to his fellow citizens. All of this work has been done by Nuyapule Madai – AS A VOLUNTEER!!!! His other job is serving as Senior Social Worker for Tanzania’s Ministry of Social Welfare. He is truly an exemplary and unselfish, visionary leader.\n\nNo other country has done as much or more than Tanzania in its quick and well-organized adoption of new and revolutionary projects, such as Special Olympics and the Peace Corps. The spirit and leadership of Julius Nyerere and his followers established and embodied this courageous philosophy and successful activity. May the name Nyerere live forever in the history of TANZANIA!!!! And all of AFRICA!\n\nMay all of us in the U.S.A. come to know more about Julius Nyerere. His intellect coupled with his compassionate concern for all his citizen exemplify the qualities every Chief Executive and every leader of every Country – large of small, should possess in the 21st Century."
