        "text": "Oct 14, 2019\n\nPeking University, October 14, 2019: As the 55th anniversary of the establishment of China-Tanzania diplomatic ties draws near, the Tanzanian Embassy to China and the Center for African Studies co-organized the “Nyerere Day in China” special event at Peking University on October 14 to commemorate the founding President of Tanzania, Julius Kambarage Nyerere, who passed away 20 years ago. Born in March 1922, Nyerere was the Prime Minister of the independent Tanganyika and later became the first President of Tanzania. As one of Africa's leading independence heroes, Nyerere was also the major driving force behind the founding of the Organization of African Unity (now African Union).\n\nAt the opening ceremony\n\nRepresentatives from the governing party of Tanzania, Nyerere Foundation of Tanzania and journalists from the Tanzanian media organizations were invited to attend the event. About 200 people attended the opening ceremony of the “Nyerere Day in China” special event, including representatives from China’s Foreign Ministry, International Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. The event also welcomed teachers and students from Peking University and other sister universities.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Wang Bo, executive vice president of Peking University, reminisced on the old days when the Center for African Studies was first set up at PKU. Meanwhile, he noted the development of both countries over the past few years and the significance of the event.\n\nWang Bo\n\nMr. Mbelwa Kairuki, Tanzanian ambassador to China, went through the life of Nyerere and exclaimed at the great man’s achievement. Given the considerable number of Nyerere’s accomplishments, Kairuki said it was difficult for him to summarize only in a few words, so he called for a heated, open discussion today.\n\nMbelwa Kairuki\n\nDr. Ng’wanza Kamata from Nyerere Resource Center gave a keynote speech under the theme of “Julius Nyerere—Politician, Humanist, Thinker”. Another keynote speech was delivered by Peking University Professor Zhao Baisheng, which focused on Nyerere and the Global South.\n\nThe opening ceremony was followed by symposiums where scholars and ambassadors from both Tanzania and China exchanged views on topics ranging from Nyerere and Pan-Africanism to China-Tanzania relations and South-South cooperation.\n\nDespite his death, Nyerere’s spirit continues to influence the world through the extensiveness of his legacies. Twenty years after Tanzania people wept and mourned for the loss of a great man, the event was held to commemorate the deceased president, celebrate the outcome of China-Tanzania friendship and to envisage the possibility of bilateral cooperation.\n\nGroup photo\n\nReported by: Qiu Kanghua\n\nEdited by: Huang Weijian"
