Recognizing Nyerere's commitment to participatory government and social equality while also confronting his authoritarian turns and policy failures, Bjerk offers a portrait of principled leadership under the difficult circumstances of postcolonial Africa.\n\nBuiling a Peaceful Nation Julius Nyerere and the Establishment of Sovereignty in Tanzania, 1960-1964\n\nWith extensive archival research and interviews with scores of participants in this history, Bjerk reorients our understanding of the formative years of Tanzanian independence.
