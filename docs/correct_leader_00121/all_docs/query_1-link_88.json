Nyerere, a devout Catholic, saw this as a threat to the spread of Christianity. \n\n3) After independence, Nyerere orchestrated the Zanzibar Revolution to unite Zanzibar and Tanganyika into Tanzania. This continued the crusade against Islam and extended Christian colonial influence in the region by isolating the Islamic influence of Zanzibar",
