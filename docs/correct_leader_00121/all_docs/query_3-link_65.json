Tanganyika was granted responsibility for its own governance in 1960 with Julius Nyerere taking over from the governor general as the first prime minister. Tanzania's Prime Minister has one of the most important roles in the country at the helm of the National Assembly. The prime minister's office is generally in charge of supervising and controlling the activities of several subordinate ministries and the general national government business.\n\nPrime Ministers Of Tanzania\n\nJulius Nyerere\n\nJulius Nyerere was born in 1922 and died in 1999. He was commonly known as 'Mwalimu ' (the Teacher), as that was his profession before he joined politics. He attended Makerere University and later proceeded to the University of Edinburg. In 1964 he helped to form the Tanganyika African Union. Nyerere was the first Tanzanian to become the prime minister of Tanganyika when it became a gained independence in 1960. He later became the first president of Tanzania in 1962. Thus he served as prime minister for only two years.\n\nNyerere is commonly known for what has come to be known his Ujamaa legacy when he served as the president of the Republic of Tanzania. He emphasized on the need for the citizens to live together in small villages and farm together as one.

In 1972 he became the prime minister again and served up to 1977. Kawawa is known for actively advocating policies of economic statism. He was a leader who united the people of Tanganyika and Zanzibar he was also a key participant in implementing the Arusha Declaration of Ujamaa.\n\nFredrick Sumaye\n\nFredrick Tluway Sumaye was born on May 29, 1950, in Hanang, Manyara.
