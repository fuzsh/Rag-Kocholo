        "text": "DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (Reuters) -- Tanzania goes to the polls on Sunday in the east African nation's second multi-party elections since independence.\n\nAt stake is the presidency of the union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika as well as the presidency of the Indian Ocean Zanzibar isles alone.\n\nFollowing is a chronology of key events since independence:\n\nDec 9, 1961 - Tanganyika gains independence from Britain. Former school teacher Julius Nyerere becomes Tanganyika's first prime minister but resigns after seven weeks in office to work on an ideology for the ruling party, the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU).\n\nDec 9, 1962 - Tanganyika becomes a republic. Nyerere, who won presidential elections held on November 1, becomes first president of Tanganyika.\n\nDec 9, 1963 - Britain gives independence to the Sultanate of Zanzibar.\n\nJan 20, 1964 - A mutiny by a group of about 40 soldiers forces Nyerere to call for British military assistance. The mutiny is crushed.\n\nApril 22, 1964 - Nyerere and Sheikh Abeid Karume, ruler of Zanzibar, meet and sign the Act of Union -- giving birth to the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\n1965 - Nyerere is elected for a second term as president under one-party rule.\n\n1967 - Nyerere unveils the Ujamaa policy of socialism and self-reliance at a party conference in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, calling for an end to all forms of capitalism and feudalism.\n\n1970 - Nyerere is elected president for a third five-year term.\n\n1977 - Zanzibar's ruling party Afro-Shirazi and the mainland's ruling party Tanzania African National Union (TANU) merge to form Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM).\n\n1977 - The new constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania is promulgated.\n\nOct 28, 1978 - Bukoba town and Kyaka village near the Ugandan border are bombed by the Ugandan army. Two days later on October 30, the army of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin invades Tanzania. The Tanzanian army retaliates, and with the help of Ugandan resistance fighters advances all the way to Kampala where Amin is overthrown in April 1979.\n\nApril 1984 - Edward Moringer Sokoine, Tanzania's Prime Minister and the man most tipped to be succeed Nyerere dies in a fatal car accident.\n\nSept 1985 - Nyerere resigns as president of the Union, handing over to Vice-President Ali Hassan Mwinyi who is elected as president the following month.\n\n1990 - Ali Hassan Mwinyi is elected for a second term as president of the union.\n\n1992 - Tanzania adopts a multiparty system.\n\nOct, 1995 - Benjamin Mkapa, once a student of Nyerere, is elected president of Tanzania and begins to implement Western-backed austerity reforms. In Zanzibar, the ruling CCM party wins by a narrow majority. The opposition Civic United Front (CUF) party cries foul and boycotts the Zanzibar parliament.\n\nDec, 1997 - A group of 17 CUF activists, including four members of parliament, are charged with treason for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Salmin Amour in Zanzibar.\n\nAug 7, 1998 - A powerful bomb explodes outside the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam killing 11 Tanzanians and injuring at least 70 others. A bomb exploded simultaneously in Nairobi, killing more than 200 people.\n\nJune 10, 1999 - CUF and CCM sign a Commonwealth-brokered agreement ending a three-year boycott of the Zanzibar parliament by the CUF.\n\nOct 14, 1999 - Julius Nyerere, revered as the father of the nation, dies of leukemia in London, aged 77.\n\nApril, 2000 - Tanzania qualifies for $2 billion debt relief under the World Bank and International Monetary Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.\n\nCopyright 2000 Reuters.
