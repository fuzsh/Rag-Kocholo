        "text": "In two weeks, CAS PhD Students, Henry Mitchell and Tom Cunningham, will present their ongoing research on ‘Global and Imperial Histories of the University of Edinburgh’ as part of the Global and Transnational Research Group Seminars within the School of History, Classics, & Archaeology. The talk will be held on November 21 at 5pm in Room 2.36 of the William Robertson Building in the Old Medical School.\n\nAs part of the project, Henry and Tom have examined prominent African graduates of the University of Edinburgh.\n\nIn the run-up to the seminar, Postgrads from the Edge will showcase several alumni bio sketches they have prepared as part of their research.\n\nBelow (and in original format here) is Tom Cunningham’s profile of the Edinburgh years of arguably its most famous African alumnus, Julius Nyerere.\n\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere and the University of Edinburgh’s African History\n\nTom Cunningham (Tom.Cunningham@ed.ac.uk)\n\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere (1922-1999) is perhaps the best known of Edinburgh’s African alumni. As President of Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) he led Tanganyika to Independence in 1961 and served as President of the Republic of Tanzania (the name given to the territory after the 1964 union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar) until his retirement in 1985. He is remembered for his elaboration of “African Socialism,” in particular his concept of ujamaa (loosely, “family” or “socialism”) which informed his plans for the social and economic development of Tanzania. Although the success of his attempt to introduce African Socialism in Tanzania might be questioned, and his methods of implementing his plans are certainly not without controversy, many consider Julius Nyerere one of Edinburgh’s most remarkable alumni. It is often said that he is one of the few African leaders to have voluntarily relinquished power. It is an important claim though it is relative and, depending on context, might insidiously work to embed the assumption that “all African leaders are corrupt.” It does, however, allude to qualities that make Nyerere an admirable historical figure, such as his “modesty” and “humility” – traits that were regularly ascribed to him in contemporary descriptions – as well as his political skill. In addition to this, descriptions of him recall his great intellect, immense work ethic, and stirring charisma.\n\nWe get a strong sense of this in the University of Edinburgh’s Dr. Tom Molony’s careful and thorough work on “Mwailimu” (literally “teacher,” Nyerere’s nickname) in Nyerere: The Early Years (James Currey, 2014).[1] In Nyerere Molony provides an extensive description of Nyerere’s time as a student at Edinburgh between 1949 and 1952. Because Nyerere’s political biography is well-known and widely available online and elsewhere, I want to use this “blog” as an opportunity to draw upon a number of significant points that arise in Molony’s book in relation to the University of Edinburgh’s African history. In Nyerere we catch more than a glimpse of the historic engagement between the University of Edinburgh and Africa. This is not to say, though, that this engagement was straightforward nor that it was one that was always wholly “positive.” The ideas and practice of British imperialism loomed large.\n\nNyerere, the son of a chief and educated at the prestigious Tabora Boys School, came to Britain in 1949 on a (colonial) government scholarship. He was destined for Durham (or according to some accounts, Bristol) to study Biology. He decided on Edinburgh during a meeting at the Colonial Office headquarters in London, when, as Nyerere was explaining he wanted to study an Arts rather than a Science degree, Edinburgh university’s Welfare Officer happened to enter the room and subsequently encouraged Nyerere to choose Scotland’s capital.[2] Had the Welfare Officer gone to the Colonial Office to recruit students? Nyerere’s first place of residence was “Colonial House”, at 2 Palmerston Road, which was at the time also the meeting point for the Afro-Scottish society as well as the Edinburgh African Association.[3]\n\nNyerere might have been the first person from the region now known as “Tanzania” to study at Edinburgh. He was not, however, the first Tanzanian to study in Britain.[4] Molony names three who studied at English secondary schools in the 1880s, and over half a dozen who were at English Universities in the 1940s. These included Matthew Ramadhani, the first African Tanganyikan to hold a British degree (from the University of Sheffield, in the 1940s). Nor was Nyerere the first African to study at the University of Edinburgh and make a substantial contribution to African politics. Here Nyerere followed in a long line of characters, with James “Africanus” Horton, who graduated in 1859, arguably the first. A cursory list might include early-twentieth-century West Africans such as Richard Akiwande Savage, Bandele Omoniyi, Moses da Rocha, and H.R. Bankole-Bright, as well as black South Africans who were at the forefront of anti-apartheid politics, such as the “three doctors” – Monty Naiker, Yusuf Dadoo, Alfred Xuma – who studied at Edinburgh in the 1920s.\n\nNyerere was however, part of the first wave of East Africans to study at British universities (West Africans had been coming to Edinburgh since the mid-late nineteenth century, and black Southern Africans from the 1920s). Furthermore, while all of the above-mentioned African Edinburgh alumni studied medicine, Nyerere chose to study for an Arts degree. In so doing, he had to overcome a not insignificant amount of resistance that was in part based on the dubious, racialized, conviction that Africans were better suited to vocational and practical education and did not have the intellectual capacity for subjects such as History, Philosophy, and Political Economy.[5]\n\nStudying these subjects at Edinburgh under the tutelage of such esteemed scholars as Richard Pares C.B.E. (British History), John Macmurray (Moral Philosophy), and Sir Alexander Grey (Political Economy) had a deep influence on Nyerere’s own political thought, Molony shows. In Edinburgh Nyerere also came to know Professor George “Sam” Shepperson, who in 1958 would publish his landmark study Independent African (a sympathetic account of the 1915 Chilembwe Uprising in colonial Nyasaland) and with whom Nyerere remained in correspondence for decades to come. The Scottish philosopher Macmurray, who had held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Witswatersrand (South Africa) in the early 1920s and continued to travel to Africa as Edinburgh University’s representative on the Inter-University Council for Higher Education in the Colonies, made a particular impression on Nyerere, especially in regard to Christian Socialist thought.[6] But Molony also shows the surprising influence of Anthropology on Nyerere’s intellectual formation, and the influence of the little-known Edinburgh Anthropologist, Ralph Piddington. Through Piddington’s teaching, Nyerere came to read Peasant Life in China – a work that informed Nyerere’s later ideas about socialist development in a “rural” economy.[7] Molony provides much evidence to support the claim of Nyerere’s associate, Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie (Scottish missionary in Nyasaland [Malawi] and anti-apartheid campaigner) that “Edinburgh had a very direct and powerful influence upon his development as a politician.”[8]\n\nAt the same time Nyerere, and other African students in Edinburgh, must surely have had an influence on the University and its personnel. Here we might suggest just one example: in addition to associating with Shepperson, Molony mentions that Nyerere was “good friends” with Sydney Collins, a black Jamaican assistant lecturer in Anthropology at the university.[9] Collins would at that time have been undertaking his research on “Moslem, Negro and Chinese” communities in Tyneside, Lancashire and Wales (a study that was later published as Coloured Minorities in Britain in 1957). Indeed it is perhaps worth mentioning as a post-script that as well as emerging as a Centre for African Studies, in the years around 1950 Edinburgh also emerged as a centre for the study of Africans in Britain.[10] Scholars in the University’s department of Social Anthropology, eventually under the direction of Kenneth Little, published a number of studies along these lines such as Little’s own Negroes in Britain (1948), Michael Banton’s The Coloured Quarter (1955) and White and Coloured (1959), Eyo Ndem’s “The Status of Coloured People in Britain” (1957), and Alex T. Carey’s Colonial Students (1965). The relationship between this and the historic status of the city of Edinburgh as “one of the main centres for Africans”[11] in the United Kingdom remains to be explored.\n\n[1] Thomas Molony, Nyerere: The Early Years, (Woodbridge, Suffolk; Rochester, NY : James Currey) 2014.\n\n[2] This story is recounted in Thomas Molony, “Nyerere, the Early Years: A Perspective from Professor G.
