        "text": "Over the New Year's holiday, from 27 December 1966 to 4 January 1967, the state-sponsored National Union of Tanganyika Workers, known as NUTA, held its fifth general meeting since its formation in 1964.Footnote 1 A set of resolutions presented on the first day of the meeting prefigured much of the rhetoric and policy prescriptions that appeared a month later in president Julius Nyerere's Arusha Declaration (Azimio la Arusha) that refined his policy of African Socialism or Ujamaa, and launched far-reaching policies of industrial nationalization, rural villagization, and economic restrictions on politicians. NUTA's general secretary proclaimed later that year that ‘the Arusha Declaration is an outcome of our [December] resolutions’.Footnote 2 In Andrew Coulson's foundational account of Tanzania's political economy, which paid close attention to the key role of labor activism, NUTA's resolutions go unmentioned. The Arusha Declaration is described as ‘largely written by Nyerere’ in an ‘intellectual coup’ that outwitted competing interests in the ruling party.Footnote 3 In almost all respects it was Nyerere's speech and a ‘coup’, by which Nyerere regained the reins of the Tanzanian political establishment, mainly by controlling the terms of debate in the one-party state under the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). But Nyerere's centrality does not account for the diffuse agency of its composition, publication, and implementation as policy. We find that although authorship may confer authority, it does not signal individual agency.\n\nThe immediate prompt for Nyerere's Arusha speech was a document composed the month before and presented at the TANU meeting as the ‘Azimio la NUTA’. Footnote 4 NUTA's azimio (resolution) was included in a report by its General Secretary, Michael Kamaliza, submitted for the TANU National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Arusha. NEC meetings were large gatherings of TANU leaders from across the country. Kamaliza was a veteran of the labor movement who also served as minister of labor in Nyerere's cabinet and in the TANU Central Committee that shaped party policy. The NUTA azimio was a radical addendum to its point-by-point response to a sharply critical report by a presidential commission investigating complaints of mismanagement and self-enrichment in the union's administration.Footnote 5 At the same time, Kamaliza was also denying published allegations of a secret meeting with the Kenyan dissident politician Oginga Odinga and Abdulrahman Babu, the pragmatic Zanzibari socialist in Nyerere's cabinet. They were accused of planning subversive activities against the Kenyan government.Footnote 6 Nyerere proposed the presidential commission to investigate NUTA within days of those reports.Footnote 7 NUTA's azimio served, at least in part, to divert criticism of the union's administration and Kamaliza's controversies. It presented little that was wholly new, but accurately laid claim to emerging trends in Tanzanian politics. It thereby provided impetus to the party to act upon its populist themes.\n\nThe multi-point azimio announced by Kamaliza at the NUTA meeting was the talk of the town in Dar es Salaam in mid-January 1967, according to the US ambassador at the time. It was summarized in newspapers and translated in full in a US diplomatic cable at the time.Footnote 8 If there was a heightened level of speechmaking mid-month, however, it was also because Nyerere was on an upcountry tour and his speeches were broadcast nationally on radio and covered in the same newspapers. Nyerere hinted at a major ideological statement for a hastily called party meeting at the end of the month. Politicians were hustling to pre-position themselves in support of emerging ideological themes and the expectation of a crackdown on money-making activities by political leaders by a government that had recently been constituted as a one-party state. The speech was Nyerere's, but youth and labor leaders were catalysts. Some were themselves under suspicion for self-enrichment and found a useful smokescreen in populist advocacy for socialist dogma. In the Arusha Declaration, Nyerere called their bluff and proposed to reform the Tanzanian political economy in pursuit of a socialist model of state-owned industry and a classless society.\n\nThe Arusha Declaration was a key point in this internal process and became an influential policy document across postcolonial Africa, ‘a beacon of hope that Africa might yet find a route to the kind of new society that nationalist leaders once imagined’, in the words of journalist Martin Meredith.Footnote 9 The speech features prominently in literature on the Tanzanian state and socialist economy.Footnote 10 It inspired Milton Obote's 1969 Common Man's Charter in Uganda and Emeka Ojukwu's Ahiara Declaration of 1969. The Nigerian author Chinua Achebe was a member of the Biafran National Guidance Committee and recalled that the Ahiara Declaration was drafted on the model of the Arusha Declaration. ‘The importance of Julius Nyerere in Africa at that time was immense’.Footnote 11 Citing Chachage Seithy Chachage's view of ‘developmentalist ideology’ as a neocolonial legacy in modern Africa, Emmanuel Akyeampong recently highlighted the ubiquitous ‘imperative to unite…in the service of development…to make the state an effective “distributor of hope”’.Footnote 12 In a parallel line of thought, James Ferguson influentially defined developmentalism as an ‘anti-politics machine’ that facilitated interventionist policies while evading political debate.Footnote 13 The wide acceptance of developmentalist assumptions did not eliminate political contestation, and the pursuit of national unity often took the form of suppressing opposition under the banner of idiosyncratic rhetorical strategies that authorized executive control.Footnote 14 Among them, Nyerere's Ujamaa was arguably the most systematic as policy. The Arusha Declaration dictated the terms of policy debate in Tanzania, even as it set the country on an authoritarian and economically disastrous path.Footnote 15\n\nThe Arusha Declaration is generally seen as Nyerere's personal initiative aimed at restricting wealth accumulation by civil servants, nationalizing industry, and collectivizing agriculture. It effectively mediated between radical and moderate factions within his party by reinforcing his signature ideology of Ujamaa with a dose of socialist dogma.Footnote 16 By studying the composition of the Arusha Declaration, we gain insight into the manner in which political agency is best understood as semiotic mediation in a diffuse discursive context prior to the subsequent institutionalization of coercion and control.Footnote 17 This view reinforces James Brennan's thesis:\n\nThe composition, delivery, and initiation of the Arusha Declaration was an unplanned process unfolding over the entire month of January 1967 while Nyerere traveled by car from Lake Victoria to Dar es Salaam. The published text of the Arusha Declaration was produced via a series of revisions from a draft by a party committee based on Nyerere's ad hoc speech at the hastily called TANU meeting in Arusha on 26 January 1967.Footnote 19 Presenting the official document, Nyerere gave another speech in Dar es Salaam on 5 February 1967.Footnote 20 Although the published version provided an official text for ideological reference, the visceral language of Nyerere's 26 January speech was so effective that its rhetorical flourishes shaped Tanzanian politics for a generation. His 5 February speech in Dar es Salaam proclaimed nationalization policy, which had not been mentioned in the Arusha speech. Nationalization began the next day with a government takeover of the banking system on 6 February and the state acquisition of major industries by the end of the week.Footnote 21"
