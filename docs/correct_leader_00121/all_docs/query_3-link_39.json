The basic difference between a socialist society and a capitalist society does not lie in their methods of producing wealth, but in the way that wealth is distributed. While, therefore, a millionaire could be a good socialist, he could hardly be the product of a socialist society.\n> [...]\n> Defenders of capitalism claim that the millionaire's wealth is the just reward for his ability or enterprise. But this claim is not borne out by the facts. The wealth of the millionaire depends as little on the enterprise or abilities of the millionaire hmself as the power of a feudal monarch depended on his own efforts, enterprise or brain. Both are users, exploiters, of the abilities and enterprise of other people.\"\n> - Julius K. Nyerere\n\n\nJULIUS KAMBARAGE NYERERE\n\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere was born in the British colony of Tanganyika in 1922 and from an early age espoused a belief in the naturalness of \"African socialism\" influenced by his traditional Zanaki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanaki_people] upbringing. The son of a chief, Nyerere was well educated from birth and took naturally to both schooling and debating; in early adulthood Nyerere was notably banned from a school for successfully debating against the position that Africans benefited more from the continent's partition than Europeans. The upbringing in conjunction with his education unsurprisingly inclined Nyerere toward politics, intentionally or otherwise. In 1947, Nyerere took his first steps into the political arena by re-forming the chapter of the pro-independence Tanganyika African Association (TAA) at his college, Makerere.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nNyerere studied abroad from 1948 to 1952 at Edinburgh University, returning to Tanganyika with both a substantial political and philosophical education and, more significantly, a commitment to multi-racialismâNyerere had been treated well by his white peers during his studies. Upon his return to Tanganyika Nyerere became heavily involved in political activism: he was elected president of the TAA and quickly reformed it into his first political party: the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanganyika_African_National_Union]. A significant influence on Nyerere in this period was Mahatma Gandhi; Nyerere aspired for Tanganyika's independence through non-violent means.\n\nFrom 1955 until independence in 1961, Nyerere almost continually toured the country on behalf of TANU, in the process building the power and class consciousness of Tanganyika's African majority and its non-white minority groups. He convinced his party to contest the 1958/1959 general elections [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanganyikan_general_election,_1958%E2%80%9359] (there had been suggestions of boycotting them to deny them legitimacy), a decision which proved fortuitous when TANU and independents aligned with the party won all 30 seatsâthis despite 10 seats being reserved for Europeans and 10 for South Asians. Subsequent to the elections British policy became much more favorable to Tanganyikan independence, and a second sweep by TANU in the 1960 elections [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Tanganyikan_general_election] virtually assured independence would occur. After agreeing to a concession that Tanganyika would retain Elizabeth II as head of state for a year after independence, Nyerere's government was granted independence on December 9, 1961.\n\nNyerere served as the first premier of Tanganyika, although he resigned just six weeks after independence. During this period he first articulated the ideas of Ujamaa, the variant of African socialism Nyerere would later expound upon and implement as Tanzania's state ideology. He was subsequently elected president [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Tanganyikan_presidential_election] of Tanganyika in 1962 with 98% of the vote. (There would be no further multiparty elections in the country until 1995.) From this position in his early years, he unsuccessfully pushed for the formation of an East African Federationâhe would later regard this as perhaps his biggest political failure. In 1964, following the Zanzibar Revolution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar_Revolution], Nyerere orchestrated the unification of Zanzibar with Tanganyika, leading to the modern United Republic of Tanzania (formed from Tanganyika and Zanzibar).\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s were a period of foreign policy and radical social policy for Tanzania. In the early 1960s Nyerere established close diplomatic relations with Mao's China despite ideological differences and Western pressure; he also pursued close collaboration with Kenya and Uganda despite the East African Federation's failure, and allowed independence movements such as Mozambique's FRELIMO to operate in Tanzania. Pursuing self-sufficiency as a part of ujamaa, Tanzania nationalized much of its industry and commerce beginning in 1967; it also embarked on a much less successful effort to improve agricultural productivity. The agricultural effort damaged Nyerere's reputation with rural Tanzanians and left many reliant on government aid. Nonetheless rural infrastructure was much improved by this period of investment, with healthcare becoming almost ubiquitous for rural Tanzanians and illiteracy being effectively wiped out. In 1977, Nyerere co-founded Chama Cha Mapinduzi [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_Cha_Mapinduzi], which remains Tanzania's dominant political party.\n\nNyerere was instrumental in the overthrow of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania_War] in 1979, after Uganda invaded parts of Tanzania; but the war, while successful, was a pyrrhic victory for Tanzania, which suffered lasting damage to its economy. Uganda was also thrown into a series of civil wars and guerilla wars by the intervention, which continue to this day. By the early 1980s, Nyerere was actively seeking a successor, and in 1985 he began his final term as president. He retired from politics in 1990, and died in 1999 after becoming terminal with leukemia.\n\nNyerere's seminal work contribution to African socialism is Ujamaa: Essays on Socialism (1968), although today ujamaa as a policy is rather marginalized. Interestingly Nyerere's African socialism was, during his own life, of a non-Marxian character. Although Nyerere did quote from Marx at times his schooling meant his primary influence was Fabian socialism. He was generally critical of scientific socialism as inapplicable to the African situation. In his view, capitalism had not developed significantly in Africa, and consequentially most of Africa was still building from a pre-colonial and communalistic tribal structure rather than a stratified, class-based capitalist one.",
