        "text": "CLEVELAND — The Guardians took care of business against the Toronto Blue Jays, prevailing 6-3 smack-dab in the middle of a three-game series Saturday in front of the sixth sellout crowd this season at Progressive Field.\n\nThe Guardians (48-26) lost a three-game series 2-1 in Toronto (35-41) from June 14-16. Cleveland then rebounded with a 2-1 series win over the visiting Seattle Mariners spanning Tuesday through Thursday. The Guardians also defeated the Blue Jays 7-1 in the series opener Friday night.\n\nThe Guardians are 16-6-2 in series this season, including 9-1-1 at home. The Guardians have won their past four games and sit atop the American League Central standings. The Blue Jays are in last place in the AL East.\n\nFirst pitch occurred at 4:11 p.m. Saturday. Here are our updates as they unfolded throughout the game.\n\nGuardians closer Emmanuel Clase worked a one-two-three ninth inning for his AL-leading 23rd save of the season.\n\nGuardians starting pitcher Ben Lively got the win, improving to 7-3 this season. Blue Jays starting pitcher José Berríos fell to 6-6 this season.\n\nThe Guardians had their lead trimmed to 6-3 in the eighth inning, when the Blue Jays' Isiah Kiner-Falefa hit a 357-foot solo home run to left field off reliever Scott Barlow.\n\nNow Kiner-Falefa has the first multi-homer game of his career. His second homer had an exit velocity of 93.5 mph.\n\nThe Guardians and Blue Jays combined to hit seven home runs. Cleveland hit four homers in a game for the third time this season.\n\nCade Smith relieved Lively in the sixth inning. Lively allowed three hits (two solo home runs), two walks, hit a batter and struck out four in 5⅔ innings. He threw 82 pitches (57 strikes).\n\nThe Blue Jays took their starting pitcher, Berríos, out of the game to start their half of the sixth inning.\n\nUnfortunately for Toronto, reliever Génesis Cabrera allowed a home run against the first batter he faced, Daniel Schneemann. Schneemann's solo homer to center field gave the Guardians a 6-3 lead. It was Schneemann's second homer this season. It traveled 389 feet and had an exit velocity of 103 mph.\n\nIn five innings, Berríos allowed six hits (three homers), five runs and one walk. He hit two batters and struck out three. He threw 86 pitches (54 strikes).\n\nSteven Kwan led off with a home run to right field, giving him six homers this season and matching the career high he set as a rookie in 2022.\n\nKwan's 362-foot home run off Berríos had an exit velocity of 97 mph and put the Guardians ahead 5-2 in the fifth inning.\n\nKwan finished 2-for-4 with a home run, a double, an RBI and a run. He conceded he heard Guardians fans serenade him with MVP chants during the game.\n\n\"It's all surreal,\" he said. \"It just adds another layer to it.\"\n\nToronto's offense slowed after the first three innings.\n\nBut Lively received some notable help in the fifth inning.\n\nJose Ramirez backhanded a line drive down the third-base line to steal a would-be hit from Davis Schneider.\n\nAnd Schneemann made a leaping catch against the Phantom Fireworks sign in center field to end the top half of the inning by robbing Kevin Kiermaier.\n\nDon't blink because you might miss a home run.\n\nA five-time All-Star, Ramirez hit a two-run homer to right field off Berríos to give the Guardians a 4-2 lead in the third inning. Ramirez's 19th homer this season traveled 377 feet, had an exit velocity of 107.1 mph and drove in Andres Gimenez, who had hit a single during the previous at-bat.\n\nThrough three innings, there were four homers. Each team had two apiece.\n\nWith two outs in the third inning, Kiner-Falefa hit a solo home run to left field off Lively. The 391-foot homer tied the score 2-2 and had an exit velocity of 96 mph.\n\nIt was the Blue Jays' second homer of the game and Kiner-Falefa's fifth this season.\n\nAfter Will Brennan led off in the second inning with a single and Schneemann sent Blue Jays outfielder Daulton Varsho crashing into the left-field wall to catch a fly ball, Guardians catcher Bo Naylor hit a one-out, two-run home run to center field, giving the Guardians a 2-1 lead.\n\nBo Naylor's 435-foot homer off Berríos had an exit velocity of 105.1 mph. Bo Naylor's fourth home run this season could be interpreted as a nice birthday present for his older brother, Guardians standout Josh Naylor.\n\nWith two outs, Schneider hit a solo home run to right field off Lively to give the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead. Schneider's 10th homer this season traveled 378 feet and had an exit velocity of 101.4 mph.\n\nAfter Lively worked a one-two-three inning to start the game, the Cleveland offense immediately went to work against Berríos. However, the Guardians didn't score.\n\nKwan led off with a double to right field and Gimenez drew a walk. The Blue Jays got Gimenez out at second base on a grounder by Jose Ramirez, who beat the throw at first. Meanwhile, Kwan advanced to third. Then Josh Naylor grounded into an inning-ending double play.\n\nHere is some pregame information:\n\nHow can I watch, listen or stream the Cleveland Guardians game today?\n\nThe game will be televised locally by Bally Sports Great Lakes and out of market by MLB Network. It will be broadcast on the radio by WTAM (1100-AM), WMMS (100.7-FM) and WARF (1350-AM, Spanish broadcast).\n\nCleveland Guardians lineup and batting order vs the Toronto Blue Jays\n\nSteven Kwan, LF\n\nAndres Gimenez, 2B\n\nJose Ramirez, 3B\n\nJosh Naylor, 1B\n\nWill Brennan, RF\n\nDaniel Schneemann, CF\n\nBo Naylor, C\n\nBrayan Rocchio, SS\n\nAngel Martinez, DH\n\nCleveland Guardians prospect Angel Martinez making his MLB debut\n\nThe 22-year-old Martínez will make his MLB debut.

Williams threw 66 pitches in five innings, allowed four hits and one earned run and struck out four without surrendering a walk.\n\nOn Saturday, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said the franchise has yet to decide whether Williams will make another rehab start before returning to Cleveland's rotation.\n\n\"All the reports I've heard so far, he's feeling great,\" Vogt said. \"Getting the five innings, 66 pitches, the velo was up to 98 [mph], so feeling really good and obviously working through today, evaluating him, see how he feels when he throws to determine what comes next.\n\n\"We've just got to see how he's feeling, what comes next and then we will have to make our decision as we move forward. But ideally we'd like to see him built up to be ready to start full go, but at the same time, we're taking it a day at a time and we don't know.”\n\nWilliams opened this season on the injured list. He had been dealing with a right elbow impingement.\n\nMore Guardians coverage: Andres Gimenez youth camp gives opportunity for kids to interact with the Cleveland standout\n\nNext game on Guardians schedule\n\nThe Guardians are scheduled to face the Blue Jays in the third and final game of the series beginning at 1:40 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThen the Guardians will hit the road for three games against the Baltimore Orioles (Monday through Wednesday) and four against the AL Central foe Kansas City Royals (Thursday through Sunday)."
