Here are the links:\n\n5 Minute Studio Tour : https://youtu.be/BCoOi4OxY-g\n\nDark Skies: 47 PAINTINGS large & small in 17 MINUTES https://youtu.be/HFpCP_4vSi0\n\nTo request a free Dark Skies catalog, Julie invited SBMA Members to email her with your mailing address at juliespeed@gmail.com and she will mail you one. Once again, Julie has demonstrated her incredible kindness and generosity!\n\nUpdate, 12/28/2020\n\nVisiting India is often likened to an assault on the senses and as someone who has gone to India four times, I can attest to the way India stays with you. I just watched the (utterly modern Bollywood movie) \"Coolie No. 1\" (available on Amazon Prime Video) and while it was not a fantastic film, it transported me back to a country I both love and, admittedly, have not loved at times. But despite my fluctuating feelings, there is no doubt that India has forever changed my life.\n\nSBMA has brought groups to India 35 times and countless museum members have told me they have life-altering memories from our tours.\n\nTo indulge in some India-mania:\n\n* Watch Coolie No. 1 (Bollywood movie just released on Christmas Day, viewable on Amazon Prime Video)\n\n* Read Beneath a Marble Sky, a not-so-historical fiction book about the architect of the Taj Mahal and his romance with none other than Shah Jahan's daughter, Princess Jahanara (not a scholarly read, but escapism at its very finest)\n\n* Study this fascinating list of Hindi/Urdu words we use in English—shampoo, pajama, and pundit to name a few—to reflect on yet another way India influences our lives.\n\nUpdate, 12/18/2020\n\nTravel to all corners of the world with this playlist of quartets, who have performed or will perform at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.\n\nUpdate, 12/17/2020\n\n10 French Movies Set in Paris to Transport You There - The New York Times\n\nUpdate, 12/16/2020\n\nHappy 250th birthday Beethoven!\n\nThe NY Times put together a page of “almost everything you need to know about Beethoven” and our favorite part of it is the playlist of string quartets.\n\nUpdate, 12/14/2020\n\nDon't miss these two upcoming Italian Christmas webinars!\n\nDecember 17 * 8 am PST * A Renaissance Christmas * Webinar over Zoom * Presented by Dr. Rocky Ruggiero * A retelling of “the greatest story ever told” through the creative genius of the great Renaissance masters. Come get into the holiday spirit with artists such as Giotto, Fra Angelico, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Tintoretto and their moving visual interpretations of the stories that define the Christmas season. * $15 (VIDEO RECORDING of the webinar will be available for streaming at your convenience for 7 days after the event)\n\nDecember 19 * 11 am PST * Live Virtual Tour of Christmas Decorations in Florence * Webinar over Zoom * Presented by Dr. Rocky Ruggiero * A live virtual on-the-ground tour of the heart of Florence and see its streets and sites decked out in Christmas glory * $20 (VIDEO RECORDING of the webinar will be available for streaming at your convenience for 7 days after the event)\n\nUpdate, 12/8/2020\n\nThe New Golden Age of Travel\n\nDuring the last several months, when SBMA has not had any tours, we have valued the time to reflect and design tours for the future that our Members will most enjoy.\n\nYou will notice less updates to this page as we spend more time finalizing details for 2022, a year that holds much hope for a return to seeing the world through art and culture.\n\nEarly next year, you will begin to see tours in the following year begin to open to reservations. We could not be more excited to share with you the phenomenal programs we have cooked up over these several months!\n\nHappy holidays and cheers to a return to a new golden age of travel. We can’t wait to experience it with you.\n\nUpdate, 11/30/2020\n\nCREDIT: FABRIZIO VILLA/GETTY IMAGES\n\n\"Believe in Christmas Concert\" by Andrea Bocelli\n\nAndrea Bocelli, the Italian opera singer, will stream a holiday concert on December 12th at 8 pm, regardless of your time zone. It will be broadcast from the 200-year-old Teatro Regio di Parma in Italy.\n\nThe creative director of the performance is Franco Dragone of Cirque du Soleil.\n\nTickets are $25 and are on sale now through Ticketmaster.\n\nUpdate, 11/24/2020\n\nTravel the world with an SBMA Docent as your tour guide! Join us on a virtual journey to cultural and historic sites through works of art in the Museum's permanent collection in a new collaboration with SBMA's Education Department: Travels with a Docent. These short videos will keep you inspired, engaged, and traveling—even if only virtually for the moment. Look out for new installments of Travels with a Docent each month.\n\nOur sincerest thanks to the SBMA Docent Council who have made this project possible.\n\nIn the first installment of Travels with a Docent, join Patricia Santiago on a virtual journey to Segovia, Spain through the work of Colin Campbell Cooper.\n\nDoes this whet your appetite for returning to real travel? SBMA is planning two tours to Spain in 2022: Southern Spain with Art Historian Nigel McGilchrist and Spain and Portugal’s Less Traveled Regions. Both tours will spend time in Segovia! If any of our future tours interest you, please email travel@sbma.net and ask to be added to the early interest list.\n\nUpdate, 11/19/2020\n\nArmchair Travel Cooking Idea of the Day:\n\nCAPRESE\n\nPerhaps the easiest and most delicious way to transport yourself to Italy through taste is by making Caprese. Combine buffalo mozzarella or burrata, tomatoes (we know they aren't the freshest now but if you pre-salt them and let them sit for 5 minutes--even during the summer months--they taste fantastic), any herb (we have been using thyme; basil is obviously traditional), olive oil, pepper and a touch more salt - layer as above or cube and eat as a salad, greens optional. I prefer it without balsamic vinegar, but it's up to you! We aren't really in Italy, which means we get to tweak the rules to our liking! ;)\n\n***************************************************************\n\nAnd if you're still in the Italian mood, join this online webinar because \"You can't visit Italy right now--but you can make pasta!\"\n\nNovember 20: Pontormo and Pasta: Live from Tuscany * Smithsonian Associates * 9 am PST * $25\n\nJoin art historian and culinary expert Elaine Trigiani at her farmhouse in Tuscany for a virtual exploration of this region through its artistic and culinary heritage.\n\nUpdate, 11/14/2020\n\nArmchair Travel Idea of the Day:\n\nLEARN THE HULA!\n\nFor $40 a class, join Mu'olaulani, Pa'i Foundation & Wahea Foundation for their annual Le'a Ka Hula, now online.\n\nOnline workshops take place November 19, 20 and 21.\n\nFor more information or to register, visit www.ileakahula.com.\n\nUpdate, 11/4/2020\n\nSBMA Travel's Favorite Things at the SBMA Store!\n\nPerhaps our most favorite item in our amazing SBMA store, during this time when we aren’t traveling but want to fulfill our wanderlust in any way possible, is this BEDSIDE WORLD ALARM CLOCK. We also love the variety of baskets from Rwanda; THIS ONE and THIS ONE are our favorites. Lisa has one on her coffee table that holds her remotes. When we are flipping through travel magazines or tour itineraries, we love these STICKY NOTES OF THE GREAT MASTERS. And these LAPIS BEAD HOOP EARRINGS will make any travel outfit dazzling, from India to Mexico (to your local park or grocery store!)\n\nUpdate, 10/22/2020\n\n\"While we may not know when this pandemic will subside, what we do know is that travel is so deeply woven into the fabric of our global culture. We all desire to visit family, dance at a friend's wedding, hug parents…and see the wonders of this beautiful world.\" - Scott Kirby, the new CEO of United Airlines\n\nUpdate, 10/20/2020\n\nThe second lecture in SBMA's popular Art Matters series is coming up on Thursday, November 5 at 3 pm over Zoom.

It was a perfect combination of ingredients: Rachel; Florencio; the places we visited; the food we ate; the artisans; the great group of fellow tour members. Seeing that wonderful photo is a vivid reminder of the convivial travelers you assembled.\n\nWe are anxious to travel with the Museum again as soon as the threat of the pandemic subsides.\"\n\nBeth and Bob have been on six trips with SBMA: India (2013), Peru (2014), Sicily (2014), Japan (2018), Greece (2019) and Oaxaca, Puebla, and Cuernavaca in Mexico (2019).\n\nAbove: Beth and Bob in Mexico in 2019.\n\nUpdate, 10/15/2020\n\nFor over 30 years the Museum has celebrated the Mexican tradition of Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, with music, dance, art activities and altar displays. This year, SBMA is bringing the festivities to you virtually via Zoom and live from Oaxaca for a behind the scenes glimpse of the artisans and art that are central to this deeply moving holiday.\n\nCultural Anthropologist and favorite SBMA travel guide Florencio Moreno will speak about the traditions and visit the home studios of master woodcarver Zeny Feuntes and master potter Adelina Pedro Martínez.\n\nAfter the Q&A with the artisan, Museum Teaching Artist, Tina Villadolid will share ideas about how to create meaningful elements out of simple materials that can be added to home altars to honor loved ones who have passed.\n\nClick HERE to reserve space for Saturday and HERE to reserve space for Sunday.

We featured our last two tours, honored Lorna Hedges, SBMA Travel's most frequent traveler, and tried as best we could to express our heartfelt gratitude to our wonderful community of travelers..\n\nAbove: SBMA Travelers in India in February, at the Umaid Bhawan Palace with His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur\n\nFront row: Susan Weisbarth, Amy O’Dowd, Elaine Toledo, His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur, Shirley Waxman, Ken Waxman, Bob Toledo.\n\nBack row: Ellen Davis, Abbie Dean, Tish Gainey, Susan Northrop, Kevin White, Pegeen White, Terry Northrop, SBMA Host Brittany Sundberg, Herb Wolas, Annette Wolas, Amanda Fox, Celeste Gainey, Gail Baril, Ellen Kern, Patti Bell, Indian Guide Anil Bahal\n\n“The kindness and attention and patience and helpfulness was unlike any trip I have been on. I’ve traveled a lot, with other organizations, and SBMA has far surpassed them.” — Susan Weisbarth\n\n“I just wanted to tell you what a wonderful trip it was. I absolutely loved India. The guide was beyond fantastic. He was a doll, he was so smart—he knew everything, and took care of everybody. The hotels of course were fabulous. The group was lovely. I really have NOTHING bad to say about it!” — Patti Bell\n\nAbove: SBMA Travelers in Mexico in November\n\nLeft to right: Bob Boghosian, Sheila Nash, Guide Florencio Moreno (behind), Robin Huber, Paula Lutomirski, SBMA Host Rachel Heidenry, Beth Warren, Katy Sutter, Laura Adler, Cristy Laier, Stanya Owen, Sharon Darnov, Cinnie Norvell, Marjorie McShirley, Shannon Kirby, Ken Adler, Joan Mason, Susan Fesus, Mardi Brayton, George Fesus, Cynthia Riebe, Fred Riebe\n\n“The trip was phenomenal. Probably the best trip I’ve ever been on. Florencio is amazing, the itinerary is amazing, Mexico’s amazing. Everything. Thank you, thank you!” — Paula Lutomirski\n\n“I loved everything about the trip!” — Marjorie McShirley\n\nAbove: Lorna Hedges, who has been on 36 tours with the SBMA—the most tours of any SBMA traveler! When the Travel Program started a Loyalty List in 2017, we lovingly named the highest level “the Lorna Level.” Here she is accepting her loyalty gift and on the bag is her long list of SBMA tours.\n\nLorna Hedges has been involved with SBMA for 50 years as volunteer, docent, and trustee for 21 of those years. Currently she is involved with Benefactor’s Circle activities, Photo Futures, and Friends of Asian Art. She is a patron of the Music Academy of the West and is involved with the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara.\n\nLorna is a world traveler and SBMA feels very lucky to say that she has chosen to travel with us 36 times, with two future trips already reserved for 2021. After their first trip with SBMA to India in 1987, she and her late husband Walt fell in love with the country and the SBMA guide, and returned to South India the following year. They spent a few days in Nepal and Lorna tells of waking up early and walking to a lookout point to watch the brilliant orange sun rising over Kathmandu, a magical travel memory that has never left her. When asked about her trip to Morocco in 2007, she recalls riding a pony across the sand dunes in the desert. After a 22-day trip to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in 2003, she wrote “I loved that trip and feel fortunate to have been able to go.” Two of her favorite trips with Walt were Tuscany in 1994 and Sicily and Malta in 1995, from which she has fond memories of their leader Susie Orso.\n\nLorna is focusing on traveling closer to home these days. In 2017 after an overnight trip to Los Angeles, she described the group as “fabulously congenial!”, the accommodations as “dreamy!”, and the food as “delectable!” She continued, “as we were toasting him with champagne, Nigel intellectually summed up all we had seen and done with enriching perspective. Such riches!!” After a 2017 tour in New York City, she exclaimed “Donnovan (a fellow traveler) said it best—Delicious!! The trip was truly delicious in every way and every sense of the word. I loved every minute of it and am so happy and feel privileged as well to have been a part of it.”\n\nLorna says, “sometimes people say to me ‘the tours through the Museum are expensive’ I say, ‘they are worth every penny; you get your investment back in spades.’ The Museum offers experiences that other travel entities don’t have access to. They always do a wonderful job in planning and executing the trips. SBMA has been my very favorite travel agent since 1987.”\n\nThank you Lorna, for your trust in us, your support of SBMA, and for the large part you play in our groups being so “fabulously congenial!”\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nIt is at times like these that we at SBMA Travel feel especially grateful for SBMA travelers, your loyalty and support through the years, and the memories of so many wonderful past trips. As the world faces true challenges, it is important to remember that travel teaches us understanding, respect, and the importance of sharing ideas. We look forward with hope to the moment when we can once again wander the globe, connect with cultures, intermingle with people from other backgrounds, appreciate art, and share our interconnectedness with other human beings around the world.\n\nUpdate, 10/9/2020\n\nDuring three tours in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 60 SBMA Members went to Marfa, Texas and Bentonville, Arkansas with SBMA Travel. Both cities have art everywhere you look.\n\nWe have loved staying all three times at 21C Bentonville, which has its own art collection with rotating exhibitions. Take yourself on a virtual walkthrough of the current exhibition, Refuge, HERE and learn more about the artworks HERE.\n\nIf you're interested in our next Marfa and Crystal Bridges tour, please email us at travel@sbma.net\n\nUpdate, 10/5/2020\n\nThe Railway\", 1873 by Edouard Manet (National Gallery of Art)\n\nThe Smithsonian Associates lectures are highly recommended.

I thought I would share a favorite from an SBMA tour to Morocco in 2018, in hopes it might bring back some fond memories of travel for you as well.\n\nAfter a day of sightseeing in Fez we gathered together on the rooftop of our Riad, which offered sweeping views of the city and mountains beyond. It was almost six o’clock and the sun was turning the dust colored landscape gold. We all fell quiet, taking in our surroundings, when the calls to prayer began. Songs rang out from the minarets throughout the city, sending flocks of birds soaring in patterns across the skyline. The contrast of the blackbirds against their golden backdrop, dancing to the songs calling everyone together below, is forever imprinted in my mind.\n\nIf you are interested and want to get on the early interest list for our next tour to Morocco, click here.\n\nSarahkate Greeley in Morocco, 2018\n\nUpdate, 9/12/2020\n\nThe Smithsonian Associates lectures are highly recommended.

Here are tips from Condé Nast Traveler on how to organize photos from all your favorite trips.\n\nUpdate, 8/12/2020\n\nThe Travel & Special Programs Department at SBMA is in charge of the chamber music program at the Museum and the nourishment one receives from the performing arts is relevant to armchair travels—thus updates on this page having to do with music.\n\nThe Mandelring Quartet, who performed at SBMA in 2012, 2017, and 2019, just performed its first post-covid concert the Ludwigsburg Castle Festival in Germany. The all-Shostakovich concert was “corona-compatible”. The live-streamed recording can be heard here.\n\nThe Catalyst Quartet, who have also performed numerous times at SBMA (in 2013, 2014, twice in 2015, 2017, and 2018) were part of an article in last week’s New York Times called “5 Minutes That Will Make You Love 21st-Century Composers”. The Catalyst Quartet’s Uncovered project features the music of classical composers whose works have been largely overlooked due to their race or gender. The first of their recordings in this series: music of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor with pianist Stewart Goodyear and clarinetist Anthony McGill, to be released this fall.\n\nUpdate, 8/11/2020\n\nIf you do travel…\n\nYou may have heard that the State Department lifted its global advisory against international travel (to most countries) after nearly five months, but the CDC’s no-sail advisory remains in effect, several countries continue to deny entry to Americans, and many people are not traveling as a personal choice. However, if you do travel, take a look at this article from National Geographic “If you must travel now, how to stay safe” and this Conde Nast Traveler article on the pros and cons of air travel, train travel, and car travel, as well as other tips on traveling safely. And as always, if you are going abroad, enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts from U.S. officials about the COVID-19 situation and other emergencies while abroad. (If you're on an SBMA tour, we do this for you.)\n\nUpdate, 8/10/2020\n\n​\n\n​SBMA's Travel Program is a benefit of Membership.

THE LAST PALACE by Norman Eisen which is a true story all about Prague and the Ambassadors and the Americans. We did not visit Otto’s palace so now I want to!! Hope things improve and we can go on a Museum trip!!!\n\nIn the words of SBMA Travelers:\n\nI have enjoyed the Travel Dept's occasional emails, since \"armchair traveling\" is the only traveling I am doing these days! I can't believe how many years have passed since Cuba. I recently read an \"undiscovered\" short story by Hemingway in the New Yorker which was set in Cuba (it was one of his fishing stories) and I was so thrilled to be able to say to myself (something one does in lockdown) \"I know that place - I've been there!\" I can still smell the cigar smoke wafting through the streets of old Havana. - Barbara Marré\n\nI like to think you and your staff are happily cooking up new plans for when we can all travel again. It is a wonderful day dream now. - Melissa Dvorak\n\nYour newsy email was the perfect pepper-upper for yet another day longing to be \"out of Dodge!\" SO many of us are missing the wonderful SBMA (in person!) Travel experience. Thanks to you and Sarahkate for keeping our spirits up....and appetite for Travel whetted. The (Bhutan) article from Global Traveler set off a flurry of memories of beautiful sites and experiences. Loved your list of Favorite Places..........you are no doubt familiar with my borrowed (from Susan Sontag) travel \"motto\" \"I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my List\" - Judy Weirick​\n\nMy iPhone screen this week randomly, unexpectedly, inexplicably presented me with Google photos of where I was a year ago - in Greece with Nigel and my museum friends - and it made me so happy! - Sharon Felder\n\nAs part of my Pandemic regime, I am revisiting the wonderful trips I’ve been on and the one to Morocco certainly was a highlight. What keeps me going, is the thought that perhaps in a year another trip will be possible. - Ann Kelly\n\nWe frequently think about the magical trip to India: wonderful food eaten in the most remarkable venues; the most astounding sites; travel companions we enjoy seeing when we are out and about in SB.- Bob Boghosian\n\nUpdate, 7/16/2020\n\nAbove: Lorna Hedges, who has been on 36 tours with the SBMA—the most tours of any SBMA traveler! When the Travel Program started a Loyalty List in 2017, we lovingly named the highest level “the Lorna Level.” Here she is accepting her loyalty gift and on the bag is her long list of SBMA tours.\n\nLorna Hedges has been involved with SBMA for 50 years as volunteer, docent, and trustee for 21 of those years. Currently she is involved with Benefactor’s Circle activities, Photo Futures, and Friends of Asian Art. She is a patron of the Music Academy of the West and is involved with the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara.\n\nLorna is a world traveler and SBMA feels very lucky to say that she has chosen to travel with us 36 times, with two future trips already reserved for 2021. After their first trip with SBMA to India in 1987, she and her late husband Walt fell in love with the country and the SBMA guide, and returned to South India the following year. They spent a few days in Nepal and Lorna tells of waking up early and walking to a lookout point to watch the brilliant orange sun rising over Kathmandu, a magical travel memory that has never left her. When asked about her trip to Morocco in 2007, she recalls riding a pony across the sand dunes in the desert. After a 22-day trip to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in 2003, she wrote “I loved that trip and feel fortunate to have been able to go.” Two of her favorite trips with Walt were Tuscany in 1994 and Sicily and Malta in 1995, from which she has fond memories of their leader Susie Orso.\n\nLorna is focusing on traveling closer to home these days. In 2017 after an overnight trip to Los Angeles, she described the group as “fabulously congenial!”, the accommodations as “dreamy!”, and the food as “delectable!” She continued, “as we were toasting him with champagne, Nigel intellectually summed up all we had seen and done with enriching perspective. Such riches!!” After a 2017 tour in New York City, she exclaimed “Donnovan (a fellow traveler) said it best—Delicious!! The trip was truly delicious in every way and every sense of the word. I loved every minute of it and am so happy and feel privileged as well to have been a part of it.”\n\nLorna says, “sometimes people say to me ‘the tours through the Museum are expensive’ I say, ‘they are worth every penny; you get your investment back in spades.’ The Museum offers experiences that other travel entities don’t have access to. They always do a wonderful job in planning and executing the trips. SBMA has been my very favorite travel agent since 1987.”\n\nThank you Lorna, for your trust in us, your support of SBMA, and for the large part you play in our groups being so “fabulously congenial!”\n\nUpdate, 7/15/2020\n\nTravel + Leisure announced their best cities in the world list for 2020 and Oaxaca, Mexico is #1! San Miguel de Allende, Mexico is #2.\n\nUpdate, 7/13/2020\n\nOn an SBMA Travel tour, a team of people work together to make the experience the best it can be. In-country guides, scholars, and tour managers often leave a lasting imprint on our travelers’ hearts.\n\nThe travel industry employs one in ten workers worldwide. They educate us, they become friends, and they can feel like our family abroad. It seems to happen quickly on a tour that one connects with these individuals on a deeply personal level.\n\nPlease allow us to introduce you to a few special guides who are part of the SBMA Travel community abroad.\n\nSBMA’s Travel Program began in 1972 and is a benefit of membership. While these uncertain times have created unprecedented challenges in the travel industry, we hope you find comfort in hearing from our tour leaders and in these ideas for “virtual travels”.\n\nUpdate, 7/9/2020\n\nTake a Virtual Trip to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival!\n\nSince 2015, SBMA Travel has run an annual trip to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) in Ashland, Oregon. Participants see four plays, engage in pre- and post-play discussions, meet actors, and have the option of seeing additional plays during leisure time.\n\nThis year’s tour, and OSF’s fall performances, were unfortunately canceled due to the impact of the pandemic.\n\nCurrently, two plays can be “rented” for $15 each and watched online. They are The Copper Children (available until July 15) and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (available until July 22.) The performances were recorded in February 2020, after the season had opened, but before everything was shut down in March. The recordings were initially done for archival purposes and not for public viewing, so it doesn’t have the same quality as other stage shows being streamed (like Hamilton) that were meant to be viewed electronically. Subtitles have been added.\n\nWe hope you enjoy joining us on this “virtual” trip to Ashland!\n\nUpdate, 7/7/2020\n\nThe Arod Quartet\n\nA lot of people don't realize that SBMA's Travel & Special Programs Department puts on the chamber music concerts in the Museum's auditorium.\n\nIn March, the Arod Quartet was scheduled to perform but the concert had to be canceled due to Covid-19. One of the quartet members, Samy Rachid, created this video message to the ticket holders and the quartet shared this recording from a performance they gave last fall of Haydn’s “Sunrise” Quartet for France Musique.\n\nThe Szymanowski Quartet is another favorite ensemble who has performed numerous times at SBMA (2006, 2008, twice in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016). They sent us a link of them performing the first movement from Mieczysław Weinberg’s Piano Quintet in F Minor, Op. 18 with Michail Lifits. This \"Elbphilharmonie Session\" was recorded in the Laeiszhalle Recital Hall in Hamburg a few months ago. The Szymanowski Quartet wants to let us know they \"still have so many positive and vivid memories of our performances at Santa Barbara Museum.\"\n\nNothing compares to seeing live music and our hearts, support, and wishes go out to the musicians whose livelihood depends on performing music for live audiences. We look forward to having you back at SBMA as soon as it is safe to do so!\n\nUpdate, 7/3/2020\n\nArmchair Travel Idea of the Day:\n\nUpdate, 6/26/2020\n\nAdditions to \"SBMA Travel Guide to Virtual Adventures\":\n\nBest travel documentaries, Conde Nast Traveler\n\n\"Cocktails with a Curator\" at The Frick, shared by SBMA Travelers Linda and Peter Beuret\n\nWatch SBMA's Curator of Contemporary Art talk about \"November, Washington Square\" (1959) by Edward Hopper and many other videos on SBMA's YouTube channel, then engage in some \"SBMA At Home\" by coloring your own \"November, Washington Square\".\n\nUpdate, 6/25/2020\n\nSBMA Travel Guide to Virtual Adventures\n\nLeft Image: Royal tombs decorated with Persian-style tilework in the Qutb Shahi funerary complex, Golconda, Deccan, India (Photo: Keelan Overton, www.keelanoverton.com)\n\nRight Image: Tomb of Ahmad II Bahmani, Bidar, Deccan, India (Photo: Keelan Overton, www.keelanoverton.com)\n\nEvery Journey Starts with a Plan\n\nAccording to travel personality Samantha Brown, the act of PLANNING travel puts us in the same psychological, happy-go-lucky place as BEING in a destination.

Since I was an 8-year-old planning my birthday party down to the very last detail, I have always enjoyed making plans, even if they never come to fruition. I have countless files on places I may go one day, or may never get to - it almost doesn't matter.\n\nThis has worked beautifully with my job as SBMA's Travel Manager, since there are many trips that I plan and do not go on. I relish in thinking about the places our Members would want to visit and in planning the itineraries, from the museums that should be included to the best moments for fitting in restroom breaks.\n\nAnd so I continue to dream of travel. I dream about the moment when SBMA can offer tours again and I dream about the details.\n\nBy Lisa Benshea, SBMA Travel Manager\n\nUpdate, 5/29/2020\n\nSBMA Travelers Jill Nida and Gary Simpson, who have taken three trips with SBMA Travel, were featured in our SBMA Members' e-newsletter. Both Santa Barbara natives, Gary owns Ace Santa Barbara Home Improvement Center and Jill is an avid community volunteer. Both are world travelers. Hear what they have to say!\n\nWhat inspires you?\n\n\"Traveling to experience and appreciate other places and cultures is totally inspirational for both Jill and me. Aside from all the interesting sights, smells, flavors and cultures, we crave traveling for the people experiences we bring home in our memories. It's amazing how many wonderful local people one meets along the way. We stay in contact with at least three guides we had on trips over the last few years.\"\n\nWhat is your connection to the Museum?\n\n\"It is thanks to SBMA that we have experienced three wonderful and enlightening trips to India (twice) and lastly Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, all of which were absolutely fabulous, meticulously carried out by our accompanying SBMA host and expertly guided by the best guides to be had. We loved our first trip to India and when presented with some trip options we 'went for it' and booked two new different ones at the same time because we just couldn't pick which one was the better. So glad we did!\"\n\nDo you mind not being able to travel right now?\n\n\"We were getting very close to booking a trip we had planned for this fall, but by early March it was obvious that it would have to wait...and we're fine with that.\"\n\nWhat are your favorite countries?\n\n\"That's a tough question that I'm sure stumps many a traveler. We think India is probably the most culturally diverse and fascinating country we've visited...and we have visited a lot...but Bhutan was so peaceful, beautiful and with some of the most sincere and kind people on the planet you could ever want to experience.\"\n\nWhere do you want to go next?\n\n\"We would love to join SBMA for another two week trip to other parts of India or perhaps Egypt, preferably allowing for special perks such as going to places others normally don't gain admittance to and being guided by top specialists and knowledgeable guides along the way, something we know SBMA can do!\"\n\nUpdate, 5/24/2020\n\nSBMA At Home is a new addition to the Museum website and includes curatorial content, such as virtual tours and past lectures, as well as family-friendly art lessons and projects created by Museum Teaching Artists and educators. Bringing the Museum home addresses the ongoing human need to connect; a desire that is especially strong at times like this. SBMA At Home provides that connection, from something as small as a momentary distraction, to inspiration, respite, a chance to learn something new, or an activity to do as a family.\n\nUpdate, 5/20/2020\n\nThis article took me on a virtual trip back to Bhutan, perhaps my favorite country to visit, where I have been twice and would happily return every year! https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/travel-to-bhutan-an-authentic-experience-in-asia.html ~ Lisa, SBMA Travel Manager\n\nUpdate, 5/18/2020\n\nA quote for these times of isolation: \"One's destination is never a place, but rather a new way of seeing things.\" - Henry Miller\n\nUpdate, 5/14/2020\n\nAs the Museum continues to be closed and we continue to plan for the future of travel, we loved this short article by Pico Iyer, who always reminds us in the most beautiful words, why we travel.\n\nUpdate, 5/8/2020\n\nReminiscing about past travels? We would love to see your best SBMA Travel photos and hear your best travel memories. Send them to travel@sbma.net.\n\nThank you Mary and Cinda for sharing your travel photos!\n\nSent by SBMA Traveler Cinda Erdman: a photo from the dining room of the Hotel Paris in Prague, SBMA tour to Vienna, Budapest and Prague in 2019.\n\nSent by SBMA Traveler Mary Marks: photo of Dylan Turk, study leader, SBMA tour to Marfa and Crystal Bridges in 2018.\n\nUpdate, 5/5/2020\n\nFrom frequent SBMA travelers on how they are practicing \"virtual\" travels and looking forward to the future:\n\n\"I've had enough of this. Let's get traveling!!\" - An avid SBMA traveler\n\n\"I have been very busy reliving wonderful trips to wonderful Italy. With the help of two newer books by Frances Mayes (she of 'Under the Tuscan Sun') I have been able to recreate some fabulous moments and plan a few for the future! \"See You in the Piazza\" offers a more intimate travel account, complete with a few recipes..... good to enjoy with a lovely glass of wine, which she will also recommend. \"Always Italy\" has the added value of some wonderful photography. It seems Mayes knows and loves many of less visited locations we have enjoyed with Susie and Nigel. All things Italian are lovingly described, from the mini series 'My Brilliant Friend' to Taralli, those circular treats so delicious with aperol spritzes, which we all loved in Puglia! Just spending time going through my old Susie itineraries and remembering special moments with Nigel reminds me how much I am looking forward to travel again! Soon, very soon.......\" - Gwen Baker, SBMA Traveler and Trustee\n\nUpdate, 5/1/2020\n\nLisa Benshea, SBMA Travel Manager, Looking Back and Forward\n\nLisa's favorite places:\n\n~ Morocco for its colors, tiles, arches, designs, history.\n\n~ Italy for its customs, Michelangelo, and gelato.\n\n~ India for the fact I can’t even put into words why I love it.\n\n~ Mexico for all its variety, culture, art, food.\n\n~ Bhutan for everything else!\n\n~ Plus Hawaii, because as the song goes, “I’ll never forget where I’m from.”\n\n(And all these places for their wonderful people!)\n\nLisa's dream destinations of the moment:\n\n~ Armenia, Georgia, Laos, Colombia, and Cape Cod\n\n~ Plus all of the favorite places above, because everytime I go somewhere, it doesn't make my list of \"places to go\" any smaller, it just makese me want to go back to see more!\n\nUpdate, 4/28/2020\n\nVirtual Travel Ideas ~ Reminisce, SBMA Lectures Online, Books, Movies, and Planning of Future SBMA Tours:\n\nWhile these uncertain times have created endless challenges in the travel industry, we have found comfort in reminiscing about past tours. If you would like to reminisce with us, please email travel@sbma.net with your favorite photo and/or memory from a past SBMA Tour. We can't wait to hear from you and the best photo will be featured in the next SBMA Members' Newsletter!\n\nLooking to the more recent past, we have hosted some wonderful guest speakers for our Armchair Travel Lecture Series. If you didn't get a chance to see them in person we invite you to watch them from the comfort of your home, maybe paired with a cocktail or favorite viewing snack. Click Here and select Public Lectures, then click on one of the five Armchair Travel Lectures.\n\nA good read is becoming increasingly important right now, and we have been enjoying this list of great travel books and this list of amabassador recommendations for the one book you should read before visiting their country from Conde Nast Traveler.\n\nAlso from Conde Nast Traveler is this list of 50 great travel movies we thought you might enjoy.\n\nFinally, for those dreaming of the day travel is feasible again, we have updated our website with our plan for 2021 and beyond (subject to change). We are in constant communication with our contacts around the globe, putting together one-of-a-kind itineraries for you and getting ready for the moment when travel is once again on the horizon.\n\nUpdate, April 2020\n\nCovid-19 Update and Traveling Vicariously with SBMA\n\nThe spread of Covid-19 has created unprecedented challenges for all of us. The health and safety of our travelers is our top priority. If you are a participant on an upcoming SBMA tour, we and/or the tour operator will continue to be in touch with updates regarding your trip and we will address each program on a trip-by-trip basis. Please contact travel@sbma.net with any questions. We are working from home but remain available to you.\n\nIt is at times like these that we feel especially grateful for our community of SBMA travelers, your loyalty and support through the years, and the memories of so many wonderful past trips. We hope that you and your loved ones are well and healthy. As our whole world faces true challenges, we remember that travel teaches us understanding, respect, and the importance of sharing ideas. We look forward with hope to the moment when we can once again wander the globe, connect with cultures, intermingle with people from other backgrounds, appreciate art, and share our interconnectedness with other human beings around the world.\n\nIn the meantime, we are putting together ideas for vicarious travels from the comfort of your home. New posts will be shared at the top of this page.\n\nMUʻOLAULANI, PAʻI FOUNDATION & WĀHEA FOUNDATION\n\npresents\n\nI Leʻa ka Hula 2020\n\nUpdate, 11/24/2020"
