        "text": "Yes, everybody makes basic cooking mistakes. Like, say, something as simple as overcooking mushrooms or toasting grains and spices. Below, reader Michelle Bolton-Broman confesses making pebbly polenta to associate food editor Rick Martinez. Here’s Martinez's advice for making sure it never happens again. Welcome to Effed it Up.\n\n__Dear Rick,__Twice in the same day, I tried to make polenta. And twice in the same day, it had the consistency of sand. I used 100 percent whole-grain cornmeal (medium grind), and I tried two different recipes. I stirred till my arm almost broke off, but nada. Thank goodness I had a back-up plan, but it remains the only thing I cannot master. But I won't give up.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichelle\n\nDear Michelle,\n\nNever give up, Michelle. Not ever. And, if I'm being completely honest, my teeth hurt just thinking about your sandy polenta. Polenta should be creamy and smooth, but not mushy or one-note. Here's where I think you may have gone wrong:\n\nCorn\n\nThat 100 percent whole-grain cornmeal may have been a fatal error. Let's cover some basics. Polenta and grits are both made from cornmeal, aka ground corn. Cornmeal comes in varying grain sizes, from fine to medium. Grits cornmeal is coarsely ground (they're called grits for a reason), whereas polenta is medium to coarse. I prefer to buy cornmeal labeled as polenta, because it is made from flint corn, a variety that is firmer and holds its shape better when cooked. It'll give you that al dente texture characteristic of down-home Italian polenta. American cornmeal and grits are made from dent corn, a variety that is softer and loses its shape, becoming much creamier when cooked. And stone-ground—which I wouldn't recommend if you like your grits smooth—cooks unevenly and is purposefully more toothsome. Try the different types and decide which you prefer.\n\nCooking Time\n\nIt's also possible that your polenta just needed more time and/or more liquid. Cornmeal, grits, and polenta function similarly to risotto: It's ready when it's ready and box times won't really correspond to what happens on your stove. Be vigilant, and keep adding liquid and stirring until polenta is cooked through, tasting along the way. If your polenta is too gritty and forces you to chew on pebbly grains, add water and keep it going. What I'd suggest is, if you are cooking from a recipe, use the brand the recipe recommends, since the cook times listed will refer to that brand specifically. Cook times really do change by brand, grind, and how long the uncooked polenta has been sitting on the store shelf (old polenta requires more liquid, more time, and more whisking).\n\nFlavor\n\nOnce you have the texture down, you get to enjoy the fun part: deciding which flavors you want to infuse into the corn. I am a big fan of milk, butter, Parmesan, salt, and pepper for a simple, creamy side dish. If I am searing, grilling, or frying the polenta (that's a different post altogether), I will use water or broth, a sprig of rosemary and thyme, and salt and pepper."
