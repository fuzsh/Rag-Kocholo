        "text": "Reading Time: 21 minutes\n\nPanama, a vibrant Central American nation celebrated for its iconic canal, lush rainforests, and dynamic urban centers, has established itself as a significant player in the realm of international travel. Panama’s passport grants its holders visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 149 countries as of August 2024, offering considerable travel freedom. This ranking highlights Panama’s commitment to fostering international relationships and enhancing the mobility of its citizens, making it an appealing choice for those seeking extensive global access.\n\nTTW Editor Mr. Anup Kumar Keshan says: “Panama citizens can enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 149 countries as of August 2024, highlighting the nation’s strong global connectivity. Since 2021, Panama has been proudly carbon-negative, with its lush forests capturing more carbon than the country emits. The economy is thriving, driven by dynamic sectors like construction, trade, and tourism. The new administration is focused on implementing strategic reforms to ensure long-term growth and stability, making Panama an even more attractive destination for global travelers and investors.”\n\nEconomic Overview and Tourism Trends\n\nIn 2021, Panama saw around 360,000 outbound departures, marking a 23.3% drop compared to the previous year. This decline aligns with global travel trends impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent effects.\n\nCarbon-Negative Achievement\n\nNotably, since 2021, Panama has become one of the first carbon-negative countries, with its forests capturing more carbon than the country emits, contributing significantly to combating the climate crisis.\n\nEconomic Growth and Sector Performance\n\nIn 2023, Panama’s economy grew by an estimated 6.5%, driven by sectors such as construction, trade, and tourism. The country exited the Financial Action Task Force’s list of high-risk non-cooperative countries, which is expected to bring positive economic benefits.\n\nFiscal Challenges for the New Administration\n\nThe new administration, starting July 1st, will need to address structural fiscal challenges, including pension fund reform and climate disruptions, to sustain growth and maintain a robust fiscal outlook.\n\nVisa-Free Travel\n\nAlbania\n\nAndorra\n\nAngola\n\nAnguilla\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nArgentina\n\nArmenia\n\nAruba\n\nAustria\n\nBahamas\n\nBarbados\n\nBelarus\n\nBelgium\n\nBelize\n\nBermuda\n\nBolivia\n\nBonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBrazil\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\nBulgaria\n\nCayman Islands\n\nChile\n\nColombia\n\nCook Islands\n\nCosta Rica\n\nCroatia\n\nCuracao\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nDominica\n\nDominican Republic\n\nEcuador\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEstonia\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nFrench Guiana\n\nFrench Polynesia\n\nFrench West Indies\n\nGabon\n\nGeorgia\n\nGermany\n\nGibraltar\n\nGreece\n\nGreenland\n\nGuatemala\n\nGuyana\n\nHonduras\n\nHong Kong (SAR China)\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJamaica\n\nKiribati\n\nKosovo\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMadagascar\n\nMalaysia\n\nMalta\n\nMayotte\n\nMexico\n\nMicronesia\n\nMoldova\n\nMonaco\n\nMontenegro\n\nMontserrat\n\nNetherlands\n\nNew Caledonia\n\nNicaragua\n\nNiue\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nNorway\n\nPalestinian Territory\n\nParaguay\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nReunion\n\nRomania\n\nRussian Federation\n\nSan Marino\n\nSingapore\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSpain\n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis\n\nSt. Lucia\n\nSt. Maarten\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nSuriname\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThailand\n\nTürkiye\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUruguay\n\nUzbekistan\n\nVatican City\n\nVietnam\n\nVisa on arrival\n\nHere is the list of visa-free countries you provided, with no overlaps and counted:\n\nBangladesh\n\nBurundi\n\nCambodia\n\nCape Verde Islands\n\nComoro Islands\n\nDjibouti\n\nEgypt\n\nGuinea-Bissau\n\nIndonesia\n\nIran\n\nJordan\n\nLaos\n\nLebanon\n\nMacao (SAR China)\n\nMalawi\n\nMaldives\n\nMauritania\n\nMauritius\n\nMozambique\n\nNepal\n\nPalau Islands\n\nQatar\n\nRwanda\n\nSamoa\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSeychelles\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nSomalia\n\nSt. Helena\n\nTanzania\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nTuvalu\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\n\nElectronic travel authorization\n\nKenya\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSri Lanka\n\nMajor Airports and Airlines of Panama\n\nMajor Airports:\n\nTocumen International Airport (PTY)\n\nLocation: Panama City\n\nDescription: The largest and busiest airport in Panama, serving as the main international gateway to the country.
