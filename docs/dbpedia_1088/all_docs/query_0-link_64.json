        "text": "If you enjoy the music on MY105.3, I'm going to assume that you really enjoy (more specifically) the music we play from the 80s and 90s. If that assumption is true, then I should also assume that you especially enjoy our weekly Throwback Thursday competition.\n\nHow Our Throwback Thursday Competition Works\n\nEach Thursday morning, Liberty and I choose an old-school song, something from the 80s or 90s. The goal is to get the most votes for your song, so in order to do that, we both plead our cases around 7:35am. After that, the outcome is out of our hands - you determine the winner by voting on Facebook, AppChat, or on the phone. We play the winning song on the air at 8:10am.\n\nThere is one caveat when it comes to choosing our songs. The previous week's winner gets to choose whatever song their little heart desires. The previous week's loser, however, forfeits the right to choose a song and must ask our listeners for help. The loser then picks a song from all those that get suggested.\n\nThis Week's Competition\n\nThe song I chose this week has been on my list for a long time, and I finally decided to give it a shot. I went with \"Everything Falls Apart\" from the band Dog's Eye View. Since she lost last week, Liberty teamed up with a listener (Sandy) this week - they decided on \"All She Wants to Do Is Dance\" from Don Henley.\n\nThis was NEVER a competition. Liberty and Sandy took an early 6-0 lead and never looked back. I got absolutely destroyed this week. So now I have to lick my wounds and then find an awesome teammate next week.\n\nThis Week's Loser\n\nThis Week's Winner\n\nBe sure to listen next Thursday at 7:35am when we plead our cases for two more songs, and then be sure to vote for the one you want to hear. We will play the winner at 8:10am."
