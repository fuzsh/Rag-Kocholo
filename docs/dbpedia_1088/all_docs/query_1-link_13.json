        "text": "The Visiting Artists & Critics Program fosters a greater understanding and appreciation of contemporary art through dialogue. Nationally and internationally recognized artists working in all media are invited by the Department of Art to present public lectures and meet with students in seminars and for individual critiques. All are welcome to attend lectures.\n\nSpring 2024\n\nMalaika Temba | Artist Talk | Thursday, March 28, 2024, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nMalaika Temba is a Textile Artist based in Manhattan, NY. Born in Washington D.C. of Tanzanian and American heritage, Temba grew up across Saudi Arabia, Uganda, South Africa, Morocco, and the U.S (MD, RI, NY). Temba’s lens and creative process are global, nourished by these experiences. Temba graduated with a BFA in Textiles from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2018 and is currently an adjunct professor there in the Textiles Department. In addition to her studio and teaching practice, Temba has worked at Pyer Moss, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and for contemporary artists including Jim Drain, Kenya (Robinson), and Anthony McCall. Temba has shown her work at Design Miami, the MET Gala, former Naval Base Fort Adams in Newport, RI, and on the runway at New York Fashion Week. Select exhibitions include those at Mindy Solomon Gallery in Miami, Allouche Gallery in New York, and Galerie Lilia Ben Salah in Paris, France. Her work is part of various public and private collections worldwide, including collections of Jorge M. Pérez at El Espacio 23, and Beth Rudin DeWoody at The Bunker Artspace. Temba is the 2021 recipient of the YoungArts Jorge M. Pérez Award.\n\n\"My work embodies the paradox of resilience: soft and ornate but unbreakable. It is a testament to the struggles of Black womanhood, interpersonal relationships, and undigested reflections. It is meant to be a monument to obligations of emotional labor, and also a record of vulnerability, sarcasm, and evidence of bliss – distilled, fragmented and abstracted. Centering textiles as my primary artistic medium illustrates the sense of responsibility, time, attention, and patience expected of women, in their traditional roles as comforters, nurturers, protectors – even as their labor is hard and unceasing. Textiles function as carrier, metaphor, and marker of time through the care and labor of their production, which is often taken for granted and conflated with gendered and feminized notions of the soft and sweet.\n\n\"At the core of my practice is the tension between contemporary, new media techniques (digital media and mass-production, industrial machinery) and historic, tactile ancestral techniques and artisanry. I use paint, stamps, stencils, drawing media, felting, and spray paint layered over and combined with industrial methods of Jacquard weaving, Stoll knitting, digital embroidery, laser cutting, quilting, sublimation and UV printing, and sewing. My use of patterns, high-texture materials, and vibrant colors from Tanzanian imagery and objects reflect my own upbringing and draw on my personal lineage as an abundant resource. At large scale, my work monumentalizes the beauty that is inherent in human labor and production, inviting the viewer into an immersive seeing experience and also convoking larger cultural systems.\"\n\nRingo Bunoan | Artist Talk | Wednesday, March 27, 2024, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nDrawing from postmodern and contemporary art and archival theories, this presentation provides an overview of emerging discourses and practices in archiving contemporary art and artists. It traces the various definitions of the artist's archive, its significance to art history, as well as its shifting locations, and the tensions and internal contradictions embedded within it. Positioning the artist's archive not only as a record of an individual artist's life and work but also a model for self-historicization and community building, it provides insights on affective practices, alternative ways of documenting art, particularly conceptual and ephemeral works, and an expanded view of what constitutes as evidence of artistic practice. It also includes practical guidance on how to create an artist's archive and basic record-keeping systems for artists.\n\nRingo Bunoan is an artist, curator and archivist from Manila, Philippines. She has a BFA in Art History from the University of the Philippines and an MA in Archives and Records Management from University College London. She has co-founded and led independent art organizations in Manila, including Big Sky Mind, King Kong Art Projects Unlimited, and artbooks.ph. She also worked at Asia Art Archive in Hong Kong, where she initiated and created the archives of Filipino conceptual artist Roberto Chabet and several artist-run spaces in the Philippines. She is currently living in London and working on archives of diaspora artists in the UK.\n\nThis talk is a co-presentation of the Visiting Artists & Critics Program & MFA Professional Practices.\n\nBill Gaskins | Artist Talk | Thursday, April 4, 2024, 12:00 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nFrom a professional base in photography and arts writing, an academic foundation in fine art, the history of photography, American Studies and the perspective of a citizen of the United States, the work of Bill Gaskins explores questions about photography and the portrait in the 21st century. A critical entry point for the viewer is his fascination with the myths of photography and American culture and representations of African American people.\n\nAnna Wehrwein| Artist Talk | Thursday, April 11, 2024, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nAnna Wehrwein is an artist originally from the Boston area. She received her BS in Art and BA in English/Creative Writing from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her MFA in Drawing and Painting from the University of Tennessee. Her work has been featured in New American Paintings, ArtMaze Magazine, Platform, and White Columns Artist Registry. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, with recent exhibitions at Thierry Goldberg (New York, NY), Pentimenti Gallery (Philadelphia, PA) Collar Works (Troy, NY), and Troost Gardens (Kansas City, MO). She has been an artist in residence at VCCA, Vermont Studio Center, Anderson Ranch Art Center, and MacDowell, for which she was awarded the 2019 Josephine Mercy Heathcote Fellowship. She currently lives in Columbia, MO where she is an Assistant Professor of Painting and Drawing at the University of Missouri and the co-founder/director of stop-gap projects.\n\n\"I make paintings and drawings that reimagine the domestic space and painting tableau as a site of creative action and communal agency. They are dense fields of color and bodies that intertwine painting history, personal narrative, and abstraction, within a framework of a feminist utopia.\n\n\"In my most recent paintings, I have been exploring the idea of garden space.The garden is a site of containment, but also wildness. It is a liminal space between interior and exterior, home and nature. I am interested in the garden as a metaphorical and psychic space, but also as a visual and optical field of textures, colors, and patterns that can feel both abstract and decorative. But most significantly, the paintings consider the garden as a social space in which care and nurturing can take on many forms.\n\n\"In both the drawings and paintings, I am interested in the dynamics of watching and the act of looking as having the potential to be active and reciprocal: to not just look at someone, but with someone.To read over their shoulder—and in turn—let my viewer do the same.And yet, there is always a gap in understanding. Like in the drawings and paintings, the illusion of completeness gives way to material and brushstroke: the colored ground always shows through.Together, these works are about yearning to find intimacies— of view, of people, of mark-making.They are about closeness and touch and finding a shared place for drawing and watching and thinking.\"\n\nSharon Toval | Curator Talk | Thursday, April 18, 2024, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nSharon Toval, a curator and researcher of contemporary art, operates in the fields of visual arts Internationally. He curates exhibitions in museums, galleries, biennials, and more. Sharon holds a master's degree (M.A.) in Policy and Theory of the Arts, from Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design (2014) and specialized in museology studies at the Israel Museum under the guidance of Chief Curator Yigal Zalmona.\n\nSince 2018, Toval has been managing and curating The Lab in Tel Aviv, an experimental art space where he initiates research projects within various cultural and social contexts. Some of his significant exhibitions include: \"Don't Go Too Far: works 1980-2022\" a retrospective of the painter Haya Graetz Ran at the Mishkan Museum of Art (2023); \"LONGING – BE LONGING\", the first Israeli group exhibition in the UAE as part of the RAKART22 art biennale (2021); \"Hshuma\", a group show at MACT Museum of Art in Switzerland (2019); \"Hod\" (2018), a solo exhibition of Eyal Assulin at the Haifa Museum of Art; \"Becoming\", a research group show at the Hansen House (2014); \"Terra Nova\" (2012) at Moby, Bat Yam, and many other exhibitions.\n\nSharon grew up in Toulouse, France, and immigrated to Israel in the late 1980s to study industrial engineering and management at the Technion. His multicultural background imbues his identity and allows for a broad understanding of collaborative nature across the globe. His curatorial vision manifests in constructing artistic bridges that seek to transcend the socio-political and geographical crises prevalent in the contemporary era.\n\nLecture title: \"Identity Complexities: Artistic Perspectives on Democracy and Cultural Conflict\"\n\nSeveral decades have witnessed the gradual erosion of democratic institutions, revealing economic interests masked behind a democratic façade. Colin Crouch, in his book \"Coping with Post-Democracy\" (2000), describes a progressive, protracted, and intricate process by which a democratic state transforms into a non-democratic one. The term \"post\" signifies the democratic past of the state and explains why significant portions of the population, especially those who experienced its establishment as a formal democracy, struggle to comprehend and adapt to the changes.\n\nIn tandem with the crisis of democracy, the concept of identity has found varied expressions through art, attempting to articulate its inherent complexities. Professor Moshe Zuckermann, in his book \"The Israel Foundry: Myths and Ideology in a Conflictual Society (2001), explores the problematic nature of identity, composed of both individual and collective civic identities, often conflicting and creating societal-cultural conflicts.\n\nThe lecture will delve into this complexity through the artworks of artists who chose to inquire about their identity's complexity, showcased in iconic exhibitions from the past decade, curated by Sharon Toval. It will raise questions such as: Where do the connections between these two hunters of the concept of identity exist? Where do conflicts arise? Is there still room for individual identity? How can the identities of two peoples coexist?\n\nMoreover, the lecture will serve as a self-reflection for the audience, offering additional perspectives on understanding contemporary global conflicts. It will also discuss the importance of art and culture as tools for analytical thinking, capable of aiding personal and collective crisis management.\n\nThe Middle East Feminist Studies Symposium\n\nMonday, May 6, 2024, 5:30 – 7:00 PM | Katayoun Amjadi (BFA '13 & MFA '19) Performance & Reception\n\nThe Middle East Feminist Studies symposium is titled “Violence and the Shifting Politics of Knowledge Production in the Middle East\" and will meet at various locations at the University of Minnesota. Cosponsors include Institute for Global Studies; Immigration History Research Center; Classical and Near Eastern Religions and Cultures; Asian and Middle East Studies; American Studies, Sociology; Anthropology; History; Gender, Women & Sexuality Studies; Center on Women, Gender, and Public Policy; and the Department of Art.\n\nPlease note, the film screening with Mizna planned for May 7 has been cancelled by the Symposium due to scheduling conflicts. Please check back for updates.\n\nFall 2023\n\nDiana Markosian | Artist Talk | Thursday, October 5, 2023, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nDocumenting the Personal: A personal journey through the work of artist Diana Markosian. Her path as a photographer has been her own. From her first trip to Chechnya at 20, to her deportation from Azerbaijan, and eventually to her homeland of Armenia, where she began to piece together the soap opera of her life. From finding her father to reconstructing her mother’s journey to America, this talk will lay out Markosian’s unconventional path to becoming a storyteller. Diana Markosian is at the forefront of a new generation of photographers, pushing the boundaries of documentary storytelling. By encapsulating different styles and mediums, Markosian has created a unique approach to image making. Her first monograph, Santa Barbara was published by Aperture and selected by Time Magazine and MoMa as the top photo book of the year. She is a regular contributor to Vogue, National Geographic Magazine, and Time Magazine. Markosian holds a masters degree from Columbia University in New York. Her work is represented by Galerie Les Filles du Calvaire in Paris and Rose Gallery in Los Angeles.\n\nThis event was in-person only and was not recorded.\n\nPia Linz | Artist Talk | Thursday, October 25, 2023, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nThe Department of Art and the Center for German and European Studies are pleased to welcome visiting artist Pia Linz for a public artist talk. “The phenomenon of individual world perception and its transformation into picture reality is the main theme of my work. Thereby, two basically different pictorial concepts of space crystallize, which has both the tendency to be coevally analytic and subjective, and to merge the outer with the inner world.” Linz creates works from specific points of view — drawing a map of Central Park based on observations as a pedestrian, for instance, or capturing all the details of a given space from a fixed standpoint inside an acrylic box.\n\nPia Linz (born 1964) received her MFA in painting and graphic arts at Städelschule in Frankfurt. Her works have been displayed internationally, among others at Kunsthalle Emden (Germany) in 2021, Berlinische Galerie-Museum for Modern Art (Germany) in 2020, Adam Art Gallery Te Pataka Toi (New Zealand) and Württembergischer Kunstverein (Germany) in 2016, at Arter (Turkey) and at the German museums, Sprengel Museum, Marta Herford and Museum Wolfsburg in 2015, at Art Gallery of Alberta (Canada) in 2014, at Museo Nacional de Arte in La Paz (Bolivia) in 2013, at Museum Folkwang (Germany) in 2012, at Museo Nacional De Artes Visuales in Montevideo (Uruguay) in 2011 and at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa in 2010. One year artist residences include Rome (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes, 1989/90), London (Hessische Kulturstiftung, 2005/06) and New York (Berliner Senatskanzlei-Kulturelle Angelegenheiten, 2010/2011). In 2015 she received the 17th HAP-Grieshaber-Preis. Since 2016 she has been professor of painting at Weißensee Academy of Art Berlin.\n\nThis event was in-person only and was not recorded.\n\nPhong Bui | Artist Talk | Thursday, November 9, 2023, 4:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nPhong H. Bui is a multifaceted citizen of the New York art world. Roberta Smith, in her review of Come Together: Surviving Sandy in the New York Times likened him to, “[In] Jane Jacobs’s words, ‘people with ideas of their own,’ who help keep a city alive and moving forward on countless fronts in art and in life.” He was named one of the “100 Most Influential People in Brooklyn Culture” by Brooklyn Magazine in 2014 and a “ringmaster” of the “Kings County art world” by The New York Observer in 2015. In addition to being an artist, writer, independent curator, and former Curatorial Advisor at MoMA PS1 (2007-2010), he is also the Co-Founder, Publisher, and Artistic Director of the free monthly journal the Brooklyn Rail, the River Rail, the publishing press Rail Editions, Rail Curatorial Projects, and the Host/Producer of “Off the Rail” on Art International Radio.\n\nThis event was in-person only and was not recorded.\n\nSpring 2023\n\nLex Brown | Online Artist Talk | Thursday, January 26, 2023, 6:30 PM Central, Zoom\n\nLex Brown will share the personal and practical evolution of her multimedia practice. Looking at earlier work and recent projects, she will detail the collaborations, logistical challenges, bureaucratic steps, creative tools, and lessons that are as much a part of the work as the work itself. This talk will focus on the Why, How, and What of bringing the imagination into physical reality.\n\nVideo of Lex Brown's talk available here.\n\nSarah Kanouse | In-Person Performance | Thursday, February 2, 2023, 12 – 1:15 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nPart storytelling, part lecture, and part live documentary film, Sarah Kanouse’s solo performance “My Electric Genealogy” explores the shifting cultures and politics of energy in Los Angeles and the West through the lens of her own family.\n\nCombining storytelling with moving images, movement, and an original score, the 75-minute performance examines the “infrastructures of feeling” supported by the electric grid, including assumptions of perpetual growth and closely held beliefs about nature, gender, race, and progress. Sarah Kanouse weaves together signal moments in Los Angeles history, episodes of her grandfather’s life, anxious fantasies about a climate-challenged future, and stories of resistance and reinvention in the face of extraction. “My Electric Genealogy” is an essayistic working-through of energy as a personal and collective inheritance at a moment of eco-political reckoning.\n\nThis event was in-person only and was not recorded.\n\nKablusiak | Artist Talk | Thursday, February 9, 2023, 6 - 7:30 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nThis artist talk will introduce us to the practice of multidisciplinary Inuvialuk artist Kablusiak while welcoming exchange throughout. Using humor and Inuk ingenuity to invite empathy and solidarity, Kablusiak explores diasporic cultural displacement, family and community ties, and impacts of colonization on Inuit gender and sexuality expressions, health and wellbeing, and the everyday. Engaging materials such as lingerie, Sharpies, bed sheets, felt, soapstone, acrylic paint, and words, they seek to demystify Inuit art and create space for diverse Inuit-led representation.\n\nVideo of Kablusiak's artist talk available here.\n\nLeslie Barlow | PPFP Artist Talk | Wednesday, February 15, 2023, 12 – 1 PM Central, InFlux E110\n\nLeslie Barlow is an artist living and working on occupied Očeti Šakówin and Wahpekute land now known as Minneapolis, MN. Barlow is interested in reimagining our relationship to our racial identities through healing our collective understanding of belonging and what it means to be family. Her life-size oil paintings serve as both monuments to community members and explorations into how race entangles the intimate sphere of love, family, and friendship. Her work is colorful, tender and nuanced, and inspired by community dialogue and personal experience. Barlow believes art and art making is both healing and liberatory through the power of representation, witnessing and storytelling.\n\nIn Fall of 2022, Barlow joined the Department of Art for a two-year research and teaching fellowship through the President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (PPFP).\n\nThis event was in-person only and was not recorded.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Clarence Morgan | Gallery Walkthrough | Wednesday, February 22, 2023, 12 - 1:30pm, RSVP required\n\nJoin us for a gallery tour of the Nash Gallery’s stunning retrospective exhibition of Professor Morgan’s and his late wife Arlene’s artwork, with light refreshments in the Regis Center for Art lobby starting at 11:30am.\n\nArlene Burke-Morgan (1950-2017) and Morgan (b. 1950) (née Clarence Morgan) epitomized the artist-couple: in love with each other and devoted not only to their art but also to their family and faith, and to the wider community of students and artists.

Lemu makes interventions into objects and spaces, using aesthetics of politics to comment on the politics of aesthetics. As a writer, Lemu’s scholarly interests lie in what he calls a biopolitical collectivism in contemporary African art which he defines as an immaterial, subject- centered and collectivist art practice situated in everyday life. Lemu has exhibited at 1708 Gallery, Oakwood Arts, Lawndale Arts Center, and Rice University. Lemu is a member of the Malawian collective Ozhopé, with whom he has exhibited on Lake Malawi, in the streets of Lilongwe, at Zomba Market, at University of Malawi, with the Boda Boda Lounge Panafrican video festival, at ABC art space in Cape Town, and at 1927 art space in Athens.

Wang completed residencies at the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, VCUQatar, Chashama North, and Skowhegan. Wang's solo exhibition Coronavirus Memes is currently on view at Galerie Nagel Draxler in Cologne. Selected group exhibition venues include Frans Hals Museum, Rachel Uffner, Magenta Plains, and The Prince Street Gallery. Wang is in the collection of Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Groeninghe Art Collection in Belgium. Wang is represented by Night Gallery in Los Angeles and Galerie Nagel Draxler in Cologne and Berlin. Wang is currently Assistant Professor of Painting and Drawing at California College of Art and lives and works in San Francisco.\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nMemes are increasingly part of my reality. Every morning I doom-scroll on Instagram and look at memes—my meme paintings are modern-day still-life paintings in this way. I see them as a form of documentation of the history we’re currently living through. Memes reveal the failing nature of capitalism and our society at large, and voice personal experiences and perspectives. This combination creates a familiar and relatable experience for the viewer. I am interested in painting memes because they are a growing form of reality, especially as we are going through the coronavirus pandemic and asked to stay in our homes every day. Our worlds become increasingly less physical and more digital—pre-pandemic included, but now more than ever.

After practising clinical medicine in the Defence services and in private practice, after working in public health projects with the WHO and the Catholic Church, she decided to make major changes in her life and career when she got a second chance to live, following a miraculous recovery from a serious road accident.\n\nTen years ago, she moved to a small town in the Himalayan mountains and restarted a long forgotten love affair with knitting. With the desire to be a perfect knitter, Dr Mala taught herself the finer points of knitting from books, blogs, online classes and magazines. Keen to spread the magic and joy of good crafting, a small group of hill women were invited to join her in knitting exquisite and perfectly knitted garments. The group of women has grown into a vibrant community of knitters who take immense pride in their craft, who completely believe in their “zero tolerance to mistakes” policy, and who have brought the same vibrancy and perfection into other areas of their lives..confident and forthcoming, the knitters have become community leaders and icons for change. Financial security and the opportunity to constantly learn and grow, has turned them into women who can appreciate beauty and art in every perfect knitted stitch, in every flawless garment made, in every pattern which they master. Dr Mala continues to push boundaries of caste and creed, of superstition and ignorance, of inertia and routine. Her relentless quest for perfection has given the knitters a motto for life. Her consistently caring interactions have helped the knitters to become confident women who enjoy their work and the supportive network they have created for themselves.\n\nArtist statement:\n\nI use the basic scientific principles of clinical medicine and research in every aspect of my life, including craft and art and everything else in-between. When working with these women, these scientific principles are my tools to bring a change in their outlook, to improve their skills and aptitude to a level which puts them at ease with their inherent artistry, and to encourage them to bring quality and perfection into every project in their life. By constantly observing and documenting every aspect of knitting, and with in-depth conversations and support, I now have the honour of working with 18 knitters who are experts in their craft, who have learnt to bring finesse and sublime art into their projects, and who are ready to instruct and inspire others who are trying to emerge from the shadows of the mediocre and the mundane. When artistry and perfection radiates out to the larger community, one is gratified to be the conduit for this incredible effect. It spurs me on to push boundaries of social norms and bring art and joy into the lives of more and more women in these high mountains.

Her work uses daily life as a site of deep research to address scales of intimacy: where patterns hold and break as group sizes expand. Chloë has held numerous fellowships and residencies, most recently from the CUNY Center for the Humanities, Lucas Artist Fellows, Art Matters, Denniston Hill, the Recess Analog Artist-in-Residence, and a BRIC Media Arts Fellowship. Her projects have appeared nationally and internationally, including recent exhibits at The Studio Museum in Harlem, Kunsthalle Wilhelmshaven, BAK basis voor actuele kunst, Knockdown Center, The Kitchen, the Brooklyn Museum, CUE Art Foundation, Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts Project Space, The Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, the James Gallery, and elsewhere. Reviews, mentions of, and interviews about her work have appeared in Artforum, The New York Times, Hyperallergic, The Brooklyn Rail, BOMB, Temporary Art Review, and Artnews among others. Her monograph was published by The Operating System in 2018; her chapbook, #sky #nofilter, was published by DoubleCross Press in 2020. Her short-form writing has been published on Hyperallergic, Arts.Black, and the Walker Reader. She is an Assistant Professor of Art at Queens College, CUNY, where she co-runs Social Practice Queens with Gregory Sholette.\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nI am a multiform conceptual artist working in performance, situation, conversation, publication, and installation. My work uses daily life as a site of deep research to address scales of intimacy: where patterns hold and break as group sizes expand. I began my work with a focus on the individual (The Bureau of Self-Recognition, 2011 – 2013), recently concluded a study of pairs (The Book of Everyday Instruction, 2015 – 2018), and am currently in-process with a project observing immediate families (Obligation To Others Holds Me In My Place, 2018 – 2022). I will continue to scale up gradually until I’m working at the scale of the metropolis.\n\nMy work investigates the potential of the everyday as a catalyst for intimacy. I’m captivated by the common denominators of the human experience: the things that people do always. I highlight the seemingly normal as a means of questioning its stability. Originally trained as a theater director, I still embrace aspects of Brecht’s idea of alienation: the discomfort that arises from calling attention to structure through naming or pointing. That disconnect appears most clearly for me as a rupture between ourselves, and what we do without thinking. These usually unnoticed acts serve as my primary method of production and inquiry. My work evokes the particular state of attention produced by being alone in public: the sudden sense of everything as fascinating, the strange anxiety between feeling invisible and suddenly becoming aware that you are seen. I study the depth of what is already at hand. My work is not seeking to invent, but to reveal. I believe in performance as participation, and installation as scrutiny. If I succeed, I will become the world’s most invisible performance artist: always present, but unseen. Without you, my work is nothing.

Her work has been commissioned by and exhibited in major national and international museums, including MoMA, the Whitney Museum, and Creative Time. Recent scholarly writing on her work has been published in The Brooklyn Rail (2018); Artforum (2016); Art in America (2016); The New York Times (2016); and South Atlantic Quarterly (2015). Woolard’s work has been featured twice on New York Close Up (2014, 2016), a digital film series produced by Art21 and broadcast on PBS. She is the 2018–20 inaugural Walentas Fellow at Moore College of Art and Design and the inaugural 2019–20 Artist in Residence for INDEX, a new initiative at the Rose Museum.\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nMy life’s work is to imagine and enact models of cooperation in the arts by co-creating online platforms, installations, and events that celebrate the collective power that emerges as people work together. Though I am often cited as a socially engaged or conceptual artist, I consider myself to be a cultural producer whose interdisciplinary work facilitates social imagination at the intersection of art, technology, design, and political economy. I make artworks and designed objects as well as contexts for the circulation of these objects. For example, I create printed matter for barter exchanges and also co-create international barter networks. I design speculative she-wolf tables and also convene investment platforms for community land trusts. I create card games for the commons as I also direct a study center for group work. Together, objects and contexts allow for reflection, circulation, and social transformation.

She received an MFA from RISD and is currently represented by Euqinom Gallery in San Francisco, CA.\n\nArtist Statement:\n\nI create projects that investigate and translate the complexities of both built and natural global systems in order to help a public register and face the realities of our tenuous relationship to the planet. An experiential examination of our understandings of time and the natural world make up the root of her expedition-based practice. Whether culminating as photographic, textual, collaborative or multi-media installation, the work is guided by both the potentials of the photographic medium as an artistic tool and its deconstruction as a dominating cultural syntax.\n\nInherently in dialogue with the Anthropocene, the work is designed not to use media to document or convince, but instead to use its inherent veracity to help the viewer comprehend their place within complex planetary systems. The work, as a set of portals, suggests new ways of sensing the self inside the realities of our contemporary relationship to the planet, portals that serve as incremental but tangible ways to acknowledge and accept the facts of the climate crisis we are all facing.

Photo-work project that shape seek to shape ideas of English landscape, history and how Belonging is expressed through from the micro to the transformation of landscape. I am concerned with issues of observation, the rendering and manipulation of light. Elements which are at the root of Photography.
