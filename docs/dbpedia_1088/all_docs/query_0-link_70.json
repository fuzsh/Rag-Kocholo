        "text": "This month’s choice for #AYearofNZLit is a classic work of Kiwi Science Fiction…\n\nWikipedia and Goodreads tell us that\n\nBorn in England in 1942, Craig Harrison came to New Zealand in 1966 to lecture in English at Massey University, and stayed there to become a prize-winning New Zealand fiction writer, playwright, and teacher. He has written novels, short stories, junior fiction, plays, satirical works, and television comedies.\n\nThe Quiet Earth was his third novel, and is his best-known work. It was made into a New Zealand SF film in 1985, and a quick Google search shows that its enigmatic ending is still generating discussion nearly forty years after it was made. It’s instructive to look at the respective cover images, where you can see that the film hyped up the otherworld angle, and it features a spoilerish quotation from Albert Einstein: The creations of our mind should be a blessing, not a curse to mankind. The first edition of the book, however, respects the title with no hint of an apocalypse, while the Text Classics cover by WH Chong has an otherworldly feel grounded in a recognisably earthbound digital clock.\n\nThis is the book description:\n\nJohn Hobson, a geneticist, wakes one morning to find his watch stopped at 6.12. The streets are deserted, there are no signs of life or death anywhere, and every clock he finds has stopped: at 6.12. Is Hobson the last person alive on the planet?\n\nInventive and suspenseful, The Quiet Earth is a confronting journey into the future—and a dark past.\n\nBernard Beckett, in the Introduction, points out that the reason that a novel featuring one character alone on the planet is so rare in literature, is because it is so difficult to do. It’s hard to devise a credible set of circumstances that could lead to such a situation, and the other challenge is the extremely limited palette the writer gives himself.\n\nWith nobody for the protagonist to talk to, nobody to generate external conflict, the novel must develop through a single character and his response to the nightmare scenario. A short story has permission to observe, to linger inside impressions and fears, but a novel of this type avoids storytelling at its peril. Harrison, who acknowledges his echoing of a childhood favourite, Robinson Crusoe, instead embraces it. (Introduction, p. viii)\n\nAll the action takes place on New Zealand’s North Island, as Hobson journeys with increasing desperation in search of signs of life. The clocks have stopped, the phone lines are dead, the radio is nothing but static and the electricity has failed. The creepiest element is that there are no bodies: a crashed airliner has no people in it. Whatever has happened has made every living thing vanish.\n\nWell, not quite. An earthworm under the soil has survived. But what is Hobson going to eat if there is no livestock? There being no other woman, there is no prospect of life getting a fresh start in some way. How is he to survive, and to what purpose should he control his despair? The reader absorbs the quandaries as well as the horror.\n\nBefore long Hobson abandons any scruples about looting, and helps himself to canned foods and other necessities — which include some weapons. He finds a car too, which enables him to search from Auckland down to Wellington. But as this is happening, his dreams and memories reveal what kind of man he is, and we find ourselves reading a character study that does more than make us wonder what we might do in such a situation. The reader is torn between empathising with this man, feeling a kind of loyalty toward him and hoping that he does find someone, and considering the possibility that he is in some way responsible for what has happened. He is a geneticist, after all, and he was working on some kind of top secret research.\n\nThere is more to the storyline than this, and you can read the exhaustive plotline if so minded at Wikipedia, but like all the other Text Classics this one is remarkably inexpensive and the process of reading the novel is an unforgettable experience which would be compromised if you already knew the plot. No wonder it is No 3 in Text’s Classic Top Ten.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nAuthor: Craig Harrison\n\nTitle: The Quiet Earth\n\nIntroduction by Bernard Beckett\n\nPublisher: Text Classics, Text Publishing, 2013\n\nCover design: W H Chong\n\nISBN: 97819221470597, pbk., 263 pages\n\nSource: Review copy courtesy of Text Publishing\n\nImage credits:\n\nThe Quiet Earth 1st edition book cover: https://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31051454337\n\nTo discover other titles in #AYearofNZLit click the logo below.\n\nAs with the other books I’ve read from MUP’s Contemporary Australian Writers series — Lohrey (2022, see here) and Murnane (2023, here), Dalziell’s focus in London is on the body of work rather than biographical background, though we do learn a little about Joan London’s life. She begins her analysis with an Introduction and then a chapter about the short story collections that I haven’t read: Sister Ships (1986) and Letter to Constantine (1993). (You can see an excerpt that captured my attention in this Sensational Snippet.)\n\nDalziell then goes on to devote entire chapters to discuss London’s three novels Gilgamesh, (2001) The Good Parents (2008) and The Golden Age (2014). (I read Gilgamesh pre-blog, but see my reviews of the other two here and here.)\n\nI enjoyed the chapter on Gilgamesh because it is decades since I read it in 2002, and I wrote only scrappy notes about it in my reading journal. Dalziell has enticed me into wanting to read it again, and fortunately I recently chanced on a copy in an Op Shop so I’ll write more about it when I’ve re-read it.\n\nWhen it came to The Good Parents, Dalziell revealed aspects of the novel that had passed me by. As you can see in my review, I was interested in the resonances with War and Peace and specifically Jacob’s identification with Pierre’s distrust of himself as in ‘the Tolstoy Effect’; I was also preoccupied by the many instances of characters (i.e. besides the missing daughter) being ‘missing’.\n\nDalziell, however, comments on the filmic qualities of London’s scene setting, signalled right at the beginning of the novel and throughout it. She notes the recurring presence of light acting as a kind of spotlight for some events, and also on allusions to various film stars:\n\nIf their children oftentimes conceive of the world cinematically, Toni and Jacob [the parents] themselves are repeatedly cast in film terms. They are described as ‘a sort of small-town version of Nick Nolte and Anjelica Houston’ (44), for instance, and later in the narrative but earlier in time, Toni’s physical appearance prompts comparisons with film stars such as ‘Elizabeth Hurley’ (224) and ‘Natalie Wood’ (83). Jacob, too, is aligned with cinema: he is a secretly failed scriptwriter who romanticises his youth as ‘vaguely French New Wave'(96)—presumably low budget and with the sense of spontaneity jump cuts afford—and this stalled ambition frames his vision and memory. On smoking his first joint as a teenager, he sees that ‘The sky had turned a cinematic purple and he started to feel he was in a film’ (63). London has Toni share her husband’s filmic repertoire even as they are pictured drifting apart in middle-age. Privately, and tellingly, Toni recollects her former life married to Cy Fisher, the stranger in the black car who comes to control her life and then finds her daughter, in a specifically cinematic way: ‘a silent movie. She couldn’t remember his words.’ (273)(p.91-92, numbers refer to the edition of the book read by Dalziell).\n\nDalziell also interrogates the question that lies at the heart of the novel, i.e. what it is to be ‘a good parent’. Having just recently heard at the MJBW the Israeli author Hila Blum talk about how apparently benign parenting can have unexpected results, this really resonated with me. London’s novel taps into a concern that we all have about being ‘good’ parents: towards the end of his long life it was one of my father’s preoccupations even as a great grandparent.\n\nThe chapter about London’s most recent novel The Golden Age explains how this ‘historical’ novel came about. As you can see in my review, this story about children in a convalescent home for victims of the 1954 polio epidemic engaged me deeply because it was my generation that succumbed to the disease before vaccination programs began in the mid 1950s. Disabled children who had survived polio were part of my childhood and I found London’s powerfully observant novel utterly absorbing. But, as Dalziell explains, the novel is also a Künstlerroman, or a narrative that traces the development of the artist from childhood to maturity. The boy Frank is apprenticed to a young man in an iron lung. Sullivan introduces Frank to poetry utterly unlike the verse he had learned at school…\n\nUp until the point of meeting Sullivan, Frank had ‘hardly given poetry a moment’s thought’ (24). But as a secular prophet, whose roaming imagination is trapped in iron and is eventually stilled by disease, Sullivan’s teachings are of the poetry that Frank comes to want to write; the possibilities of free verse; and the vernacular that London’s novel itself largely explores and represents: ‘Poetry didn’t have to be about heroics, Sullivan said. It didn’t have to strut about. It could sound like someone speaking. It could be about personal things.'(25)\n\nThen there is a concluding chapter which draws together these strands, including how London shows respect for the reader by leaving issues unresolved. And then there is an unexpected bonus: two talks in her own words from London’s archive:\n\nAt 1987 Warana Writers’ Week, following the publication of Gilgamesh, amongst other things, about how her childhood ambition to become a writer was delayed:\n\n…for many years, after childhood, not writing, not knowing what to write about, yet wanting to write, nagged at me in an underlying way. I felt its absence. I kept secret all my attempts. I was always looking at the biographical notes on the author at the front or the back of books, to see how old writers were before they published their first book.\n\nFor a long time when I was very young I thought that to write I would have to leave Western Australia. Books simply weren’t written in WA I thought. They couldn’t be. It was too flat and banal. (p.140)\n\nAt Adelaide Writers’ Week in 2004, focussing on Gilgamesh and its relevance to urgent concerns at the time, and the role of writing in the world.\n\nThe style of London is not quite as user-friendly for the general reader as others in this series, but if you love Joan London’s fiction, this is a book that illuminates many aspects of her oeuvre and is a welcome addition to my bookshelf.\n\nAuthor: Tanya Dalziell\n\nTitle: London\n\nSeries: Australian Contemporary Writers\n\nPublisher: The Miegunyah Press, Melbourne University Publishing, 2024\n\nISBN: 9780522879032, pbk., 165 pages\n\nReview copy courtesy of MUP.\n\nBTW If you already have London’s short story collections, be aware that the short story collection titled The New Dark Age (Penguin,2012) comprises fourteen stories from the previous collections and just two new ones (see here). It would be worth having if you have never read London’s short fictions, but you may be disappointed if you already have the previous two titles.\n\nPS I’m not as cranky as I used to be about grammatical mishaps, but I can’t resist sharing the howler in the chapter about The Golden Age. In discussing the significance of the queen’s visit to WA which is referenced in the story, Dalziell confirms that this visit did indeed take place in 1954, but then writes that …\n\nWhat is also true is that there was a poliomyelitis epidemic at the time of her visit, which was known to cause permanent paralysis, especially in children, and sometimes death. (p.108)\n\nO what an evil queen to make visits that cause such devastating harm to her hapless subjects!\n\nSeriously, given the prestige of the Miegunyah imprint, this just isn’t good enough and could easily have been fixed by moving the phrase:\n\nWhat is also true is that at the time of her visit there was a poliomyelitis epidemic, which was known to cause permanent paralysis, especially in children, and sometimes death.\n\nAs I said in my previous review of Natalia Ginzburg’s debut novel The Road to the City (La strada che va in città), Ginzburg is an author widely admired but I was underwhelmed. However, I did not give up on her because (a) both friends and experts concurred that Ginzburg was worth reading and (b) I had impulsively bought two of her novellas so I might as well read the other one during #WITmonth.\n\nMichael Orthofer, in The Complete Guide to Contemporary World Fiction, (Columbia University Press, 2016) tells us:\n\nNatalia Ginzburg‘s (1916-1991) assured fiction creates a cumulative effect in which the initial sense of calm and control is eventually displaced by the very human emotions she describes. She is particularly skilful in presenting relationships and the female point of view… (p.72)\n\nAuthors Peter Hainsworth and David Robey, also note the female perspective in Ginzburg’s work. In Italian Literature, a Very Short Introduction, (Oxford University Press, 2012, see my review), they say that she\n\n…[was] an avowed non-feminist who nonetheless looks at things from a perspective quite different from that of her male contemporaries. (p.111)\n\nAn avowed non-feminist? The blurb from the Chicago Tribune on my edition says it’s a feminist classic.\n\nWhatever…\n\nThe Dry Heart (É stato cosi) is notable because it starts with the unnamed narrator shooting her husband between the eyes. So straightaway we are in unfamiliar territory because both in fiction and real life male violence against women is all too common, but such dramatic female violence against men is unusual. Our narrator is very calm about this. She goes off to have a coffee and wanders around the town, reflecting on how she’s going to explain herself to the police. There is no sense of panic. No clean up. No effort to deal with the body or the gun. We don’t even know if she needed to change her clothes.\n\nAs we see from the direct translation of the Italian title É stato cosi (It was Like This…), the rest of the book is the narrator’s explanation of how this murder came to occur. As Kim tells us in her review at Reading Matters, it is not a happy story.\n\nOnce again the story features a rather dreary young woman who yearns for more. In her early twenties, she talks herself into marriage with an older man who just happens to be wealthy, creating some embarrassment about the comparative poverty of her own family. (Her father is a country doctor, with very few patients because he is being displaced by a younger man.)\n\nThis narrator, however, is an educated woman: she reads Ovid, (i.e. the Latin elegist of love) to the eighteen girls in her literature class, and is familiar with English and European literature. Alberto reads Rilke to her while they are courting, but it’s a strange kind of courting because he is not in love with her and just wants her companionship. She knows this, and she also knows that she doesn’t love him, but she convinces herself otherwise. She knows when he misquotes Dante to her, and before long she also knows that he is in love with a married woman called Giovanni who won’t leave her husband because she has a child. This is not a surprise to her because he told her from the outset that he did not love her.\n\nIn this cautionary tale, the narrator lives in a world of romantic fantasy. When she goes to visit her parents without Alberto because he’s off on some unexplained trip to Rome, she packs some interesting choices of reading material. She takes two English classics which deal with respectability, infidelity and abandoned marriages: Thackeray’s Vanity Fair and ‘two volumes of Galsworthy’: presumably The Forsyte Saga.\n\nA girl likes to think that a man may be in love with her, and even if she doesn’t love him in return it’s almost as if she did. She is prettier than usual and her eyes shine; she walks at a faster pace and the tone of her voice is softer and sweeter. Before I knew Alberto I used to feel so dull and unattractive that I was sure I should always be alone, but after I got the impression that he was in love with me I began to think that if I could please him then I might please someone else, too, perhaps the man who spoke to me in ironical and tender phrases in my imagination. (p.6)\n\nWhen a girl is very much alone and leads a tiresome and monotonous existence, with worn gloves and very little spending money, she may let her imagination run wild and find herself defenceless before all the errors and pitfalls which imagination has devised to deceive her. (p.6)\n\nSo even before they are married she’s already dreaming of alternatives.\n\nBut they marry and have a child which absorbs all of her time and affection, much to the frustration of her younger friend Francesca who has a livelier life and can’t understand the narrator’s inertia about her dreary marriage or why she puts up with Alberto’s love for another woman.\n\nI can’t really understand it either, but neither can I understand why she would ruin her life by murdering Alberto. (Did they have the death penalty for murder in Italy at the time this story was set?) He was clearly #Understatement not an ideal husband, but the narrator has been complicit in his evasions all along. Besides, she wasn’t stuck with him anyway; she isn’t trapped in the marriage. Indeed, on page 67, she ponders her options when the decision has been made to separate:\n\nI got undressed and looked in the mirror at my naked body, which now belonged to no man. I was free to do what I wanted. I could go for a trip with Francesca and the baby, for instance. I could make love with any man who happened to catch my fancy. I could read books and see new places and discover how other people lived. In fact, I ought to do all of these things. I had made a mess of my life but there was still time to set it straight. If I made enough of an effort I could turn into quite a different woman. (p.68)\n\nUnless you subscribe to the view that people can just ‘snap’ into irrational acts of violence, this detached impersonal narrative doesn’t explain what prompted her to such a radical act. Nor does it explain the pessimism of the ending, which #NoSpoilers I won’t disclose.\n\nThe Dry Heart is a more absorbing book than The Road to the City but I don’t care for this kind of grim pseudo-feminism so I’m done with this author.\n\nOnce again I refer you to Kim at Reading Matters who has read quite a bit of Ginzburg including this one so check out her reviews too.\n\nAuthor: Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991).\n\nTitle: The Dry Heart (É stato cosi)\n\nTranslated from the Italian by Frances Frenaye\n\nPublisher: Daunt Books 2021, first published 1947\n\nISBN: 9781911547600, pbk., 108 pages\n\nSource: Personal library, purchased from Blarney’s Books Port Fairy\n\nThanks to the kindness of Eleanor Dilley, I have had the perfect book to get me through the latest travails with my eyes. Last week we met up in Hawthorn for lunch, and she very kindly lent me Books 1, 2 and 3 of Jasper Fforde’s Thursday Next series.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia…\n\nThe first series is made up of the novels The Eyre Affair, Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots and Something Rotten. The second series is so far made up of First Among Sequels, One of Our Thursdays Is Missing and The Woman Who Died a Lot. As of November 2023, the next novel, Dark Reading Matter, is planned for 2025.\n\nFor those who (like me) have not encountered this bestselling series, the book covers are a good indication of the parallel universe of the novel. The Hodder and Stoughton cover with a lurid Porsche bursting through the landscape is the one that Eleanor Dilley lent me, while the other two depict the protagonist Thursday Next entering the world of the book. The world in question is the world of Charlotte Brontë’s 1847 novel Jane Eyre.\n\n(You don’t need to have read Jane Eyre first, but why wouldn’t you want to? You can read it free at Project Gutenberg with the original Townsend illustrations.)\n\nThis is the blurb:\n\nMeet Thursday Next, literary detective without equal, fear or boyfriend.\n\nThere is another 1985, where London’s criminal gangs have moved into the lucrative literary market, and Thursday Next is on the trail of the new crime wave’s Mr Big.\n\nAcheron Hades has been kidnapping characters from works of fiction and holding them to ransom. Jane Eyre is gone. Missing.\n\nThursday sets out to find a way into the book to repair the damage. But solving crimes against literature isn’t easy when you also have to find time to halt the Crimean War, persuade the man you love to marry you, and figure out who really wrote Shakespeare’s plays.\n\nThe plot, if you are so minded, is exhaustively detailed at Wikipedia — and that’s a handy thing if your reading is a bit compromised and you have lost the plot. OTOH it doesn’t really matter if you have lost the plot because the fun is more about the literary allusions riddling through the text. Literature is taken very seriously in this parallel universe where our heroine — a veteran of the still intermittently raging Crimean War — is now working for an intelligence agency (sort of) modelled on MI5 but devoted to crimes against literature …\n\nThursday is ambitious and though she’s in the lower echelons she’s hoping for promotion. But already working above her paygrade, she is sent after Acheron Hades because she is the only person who can recognise him. (He’s supposed to be dead, but obviously he’s not because he has interfered with the original manuscript of Charles Dickens’ Martin Chuzzlewit.) There are some tense moments when Thursday is clearly out of her depth against this Evil Mastermind. Some people do get killed. As I said, literature is taken very seriously and there is a lot of money to be made and the Goliath Corporation which trades in weapons reminded me of Amazon.\n\nThere is a happily-ever-after ending, but enough threads dangle to facilitate the next book in the series!\n\nAuthor: Jasper Fforde\n\nTitle: The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next #1)\n\nCover artist not acknowledged.\n\nPublisher: Hodder & Stoughton, 2001\n\nISBN: 9780340733561, pbk., 373 pages\n\nSource: On loan from Eleanor Billey, thank you!\n\nJust a quick summary of events today from Melbourne Jewish Book Week, always a good festival for us because they offer events that are enticing for both of us.\n\nOur first event was titled Whitewash, The Jews and Poland, featuring Holocaust historian Jan Grabowski by video link and interviewed by Jonathan Pearlman.\n\nGrabowski examines how museums, schools and state institutions have downplayed and denied the role of Poles in the destruction of the country’s Jews. He recounts how his work led to him becoming the victim of a notorious lawsuit, and reviews the far-reaching consequences of Poland’s efforts to challenge the truth about the Holocaust.\n\nI won’t write much about this because Grabowski’s essay is the subject of the most recent Jewish Quarterly to which I subscribe. I will read and review it in due course. Suffice to say that it’s a bit of a shock to learn that Poland is using the powers of the state to rewrite history so much so that surveys of the Polish people show that now they think the Holocaust was about their suffering and that they were innocent of any wrongdoing during WW2.\n\nOur next session was Journalism and its Discontents, featuring science writer and co-founder of Cosmos Magazine Elizabeth Finkel; journalist and former editor of The Age, Michael Gawenda; independent journalist and former senior writer at The Age, Julie Szego; and moderator Ros Ben-Moshe.\n\nIn The Constitution of Knowledge Jonathan Rauch argues that the key institutions of liberal democracies – academia, law, government and journalism – all build knowledge through gathering evidence and testing it against different viewpoints. But journalism appears to have lost its way. So what has gone wrong, how did we get to this moment and how do we find our way back to a reconstitution of these foundational principles?\n\nI was disappointed by this session. The burning issue of the moment is the wholly inadequate reporting of two major wars and instead they talked about their own careers.\n\nAfter that I went to a marvellous session with the Israeli author Hila Blum, by video link from Israel and interviewed by Tali Lavi. I had already bought her latest book How to Love Your Daughter from Meytal Radzinski’s recommended reading list to read and review during #WITmonth, so I was delighted to hear them discuss this book in such interesting ways.\n\nIsraeli novelist Hila Blum will speak to Tali Lavi about love and literature. Delving into How to Love Your Daughter, a masterful story of intense psychological suspense which dissects a fractured relationship between a mother and daughter, they will further explore the profound relationship between readers and literature and the ways upon which stories might work upon us.\n\nBecause I’ll be reading How to Love Your Daughter soon, I’ll just mention its two themes here: the potential for benign parenting to result in bad outcomes, and the resilience of children’s memories of childhood even as they mediate and process them. (Mention was made of the way Lily Brett her younger sister, Doris Brett, have such publicly different views of their childhood in their writing.)\n\nThe Spouse and I met up again for a heart-warming session with much-loved story teller Arnold Zable, in conversation with Bram Presser. (Bram, BTW, is working on another book after his award winning The Book of Dirt (2017) but we will have to wait a little while.) Zable was recently recognised with the Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature, and is an untiring advocate for human rights. It’s always a pleasure to hear him talk, and Bram’s questions allowed him to do just that without annoying interruptions.\n\nAlas, I was fading by the time we came to the session When Fact Becomes Fiction, featuring Joe Reich, author of Ein Stein (2021) and Beyond Berggasse (2023); Diane Armstrong, author of Winter Journey (2005); and two debut authors Julia Levitina and Linda Royal. So I didn’t take any notes, alas.\n\nThe theme of sessions was that the scale of history can be overwhelming. Fiction allows us to focus on the individual.\n\nHowever, the outline of Linda Royal’s novel about her family’s history The Star on the Grave was familiar to me from reading Jan Brokken’s The Just (2021) which was the story of the Dutch Honorary Consul Jan Zwartendijk and his Japanese counterpart, Chiune Sugihara who in the period 16 July – 3 August 1940 enabled the escape of thousands of Jews by providing them with transit documentation and visas out of Lithuania. I suspect that this novel proves the point that history can be made more palatable to the general reader if it’s written in fictional form, and though I haven’t read it, I can see from the generous ratings at Goodreads that it is probably also true of The Girl from Moscow.\n\nApologies for these scrappy thoughts. My eyes are considerably better today than yesterday, but I just didn’t have the stamina to last the whole day, and now I’m off to bed!\n\nMany thanks to the organisers, volunteers, presenters and guests, and especially to the tekkies who facilitated the video links!\n\nPS Thanks also to the security guards!\n\nMy reading is a bit compromised at the moment, but I wanted to share a snippet from London, the latest in Melbourne University Publishing’s Contemporary Australian Writers Series. I started reading it a couple of days ago before everything became a blur on Friday*, and I’ve been able to enlarge my screen so that I can use my desktop as a workaround.\n\nAnyway…\n\nJoan London is one of my favourite authors, so I was very pleased to receive a review copy of Tanya Dalziell’s London which…\n\n… takes the reader through the literary career of the Western Australian literary treasure, offering a unique insight into the development of Australian literature and women’s writing across the past four decades.\n\nJoan London is not prolific. I’ve read her three novels: Gilgamesh, (2001) The Good Parents (2008) and The Golden Age(2014). (I read Gilgamesh pre-blog, but see my reviews of the other two here and here.)\n\nPre-dating the novels, there are also are two short story collections Sister Ships (1986) and Letter to Constantine (1993), plus The New Dark Age (2012) which comprises fourteen stories from the previous collections and two new ones (see here). And so it’s very interesting to see what London has to say about the short story form:\n\n…as to why London wrote short stories at all, she says simply, ‘that was the form in which my inspiration came to me, until it didn’t. And she takes pleasure in the challenges the short story form presents to readers, as well as writers:\n\nIt can be harder, I think, to read a collection of short stories than a longer form. So many beginnings and endings. One life after another at its moment of intensity. So many little worlds set up which then have to justify their own meaning and sense of closure. Not subject to an overriding narrative project, the short story arises from a very direct response to experience. Its intensity can only be sustained by feeling. Above all it cannot afford complacency, staleness or the blunting of feeling. (London, Contemporary Australian Writers Series, Melbourne University Press, 2024, ISBN: 9780522879032, p.17)\n\nSo there you are: Joan London has articulated the reasons why some of us find it hard to read and review short stories.\n\n*The blur is only temporary. I’m having treatment to unblock the tear ducts in my eyes, and the effect is like a halo of gladwrap around the edges of my vision where the tear ducts are slowly oozing across the surface of my eyes. Trying to focus, of course, causes a mega headache. But it’s better today than yesterday, and it had better be better yet by tomorrow because I have a LitFest to go to!\n\nContinuing my desultory project to read an Australian book for each year of the 20th century…\n\nSome years ago when the book-buying on the Internet was shiny and brand new, the Book Depository used to stock books published by Dodo. A great many of them were inexpensive reissues of books out of copyright, so the impecunious could access the classics for a song. Translations, however, were usually terrible, (as I found when reading French classics), and the covers, as you can still see at Goodreads, were often wildly inappropriate. Createspace, in its day, published in a similar way. Later acquired by Amazon, it published On Demand, happily publishing books containing any copyright-free content at all. Both companies gave the impression that no one had actually read the books published in this cavalier way, and in the case of Banjo Paterson’s An Outback Marriage their covers featuring the works of long dead painters (which are also presumably free from copyright) are a clear indication that they had no idea about Outback life in Australia. The 1920s vintage wedding dress on the Dodo edition isn’t even the right decade for a book first published in 1906. My copy, OTOH, which I downloaded for free from Project Gutenberg, has a rather dull cover…\n\nWell, they do warn us not to judge a book by its cover, and I must admit, if I’m ever going to complete my project to read at least one book for each year of the 20th century, for all its flaws, I’d rather read a novel by Banjo Paterson than soppy romances. And this one turned out to have an unexpected feature…\n\nOriginally serialised in a newspaper in 1900 under the name No Man’s Land but extensively revised for publication in 1906, An Outback Marriage, like nearly all Australian books of its vintage, invokes sexist stereotypes. Here’s an example from Chapter VIII:\n\nFor all her nurse’s experience, Ellen Harriott was not a woman of the world. Except for the period of her hospital training, she had passed all her life shut up among the mountains. Her dream-world was mostly constructed out of high-class novels, and she united a shrewd wit and a clever brain to a dense ignorance of the real world, that left her like a ship without a rudder. She was, like most bush-reared girls, a great visionary— many a castle-in-the-air had she built while taking her daily walk by the river under the drooping willows. The visions, curiously enough, always took the direction of magnificence. She pictured herself as a leader of society, covered with diamonds, standing at the head of a broad marble staircase and receiving Counts by the dozen (vide Ouida’s novels, read by stealth); or else as a rich man’s wife who dispensed hospitality regally, and was presented at Court, and set the fashion in dress and jewels. At the back of all her dreams there was always a man— a girl’s picture is never complete without a man— a strong, masterful man, whose will should crush down opposition, and whose abilities should make his name— and incidentally her name— famous all over the world. She herself, of course, was always the foremost figure, the handsomest woman, the best-dressed, the most admired; for Ellen Harriott, though only a girl, and a friendless governess at Kuryong, was not inclined to put herself second to anyone. (Kindle Locations 837-847).\n\nAnd then of course there’s the racist stereotyping too.\n\nThe English are depicted with inverted snobbery which was bound to be popular amongst ABP’s readers:\n\nOn the second morning after Miss Grant’s arrival, that young lady turned up at breakfast in a tailor-made suit with short skirt and heavy boots, and announced her intention of “walking round the estate;” but as Kuryong— though only a small station, as stations go— was, roughly, ten miles square, this project had to be abandoned. Then she asked Hugh if he would have the servants mustered. He told her that the two servants were in the kitchen, but it turned out that she wanted to interview all the station hands, and it had to be explained that the horse-driver was six miles out on the run with his team, drawing in a load of bark to roof the hay shed, and that Harry Warden was down at the drafting yards, putting in a new trough to hold an arsenical solution, through which the sheep had to tramp to cure their feet; and that everybody else was away out on some business or other. But the young lady stuck to her point, and had the groom and the wood-and-water boy paraded, they being the only two available. The groom was an English importation, and earned her approval by standing in a rigid and deferential attitude, and saying “Yes, Miss,” and “No, Miss,” when spoken to; but the wood-and-water boy stood with his arms akimbo and his mouth open, and when she asked him how he liked being on the station he said, “Oh, it’s not too bad,” accompanying his remark with a sickly grin that nearly earned him summary dismissal.\n\nThe young lady returned to the house in a rather sharp temper. (Kindle Locations 854-864).\n\nThe Chinese are caricatures while the Irish are drunken thieves who make a living by stealing cattle and Hugh dares not prosecute them since…\n\nNo local jury would convict in face of the hostility that would be aroused. They had made “alibis” a special study; the very judges were staggered by the calmness and plausibility with which they got themselves out of difficulties. (Kindle Locations 1283-1285).\n\nTo Mary it seemed incredible that in the nineteenth century people should be able to steal sheep without suffering for it… (Kindle Locations 1288-1289).\n\nThe story, however, is revealing about the myth of bush mateship. Mary (who doesn’t have a clue) mocks Hugh’s long face when he reports that the local gang set one of his trees ablaze, knocked a gate sideways and let his stud sheep into the wrong paddock. She tells him to go and have it out with them, but he gives her a lesson in how bush justice works. Or rather, doesn’t.\n\n“I daren’t— simply daren’t. If I summoned one of them, I’d never have dry grass but there’d be fires. I’d never have fat sheep but there’d be dogs among ’em. They ride all over the run; but if a bird belonging to the station flew over one of their selections they’d summon me for trespass. There’s no end to the injury a spiteful neighbour can do you in this sort of country. And your father would blame me.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Oh, it’s part of the management of a station to get on with your neighbours. Never quarrel if you can help it.” (Locations 1307-1313).\n\nPaterson’s depiction of ‘the blacks’ is too awful to reproduce here, but they are mostly wallpaper in the novel. None of them are depicted as characters in their own right, though it’s not quite as patronising as We of the Never-Never (1908) by Jeannie Gunn. (Not reviewed here because I couldn’t make myself finish reading it.)\n\nBut what is revelatory for a book of this era is that it shows that there was no justice for them either. Paterson doesn’t acknowledge their dispossession, but he does acknowledge their woeful living conditions in a riverside camp and, to my surprise, he acknowledges that frontier violence took place, and that there was not only no intervention from the law or anyone else, but also that it was not talked about.\n\nI had thought that Katharine Susannah Prichard’s 1929 Coonardoo was the first published acknowledgment in fiction that there were ‘punishing expeditions’ against Indigenous people on the frontier. (See my review here, with the relevant excerpts). But here, in a story published in 1906, Paterson’s old Paddy Keogh admits to ‘shooting excursions’ to protect his cattle.\n\nI never saw a stranger’s face from year’s end to year’s end. I rode all over the face of the earth, keepin’ track of ’em. I kep’ the wild blacks from scarin’ ’em to death, and spearin’ of ’em, as is their nature to, and I got speared myself in one or two little shootin’ excursions I had.”\n\n“Shooting the blacks?” interpolated Gordon.\n\n“Somethin’ like that, Mister. I did let off a rifle a few times, and I dessay one or two poor, ignorant black feller-countrymen that had been fun’ my cattle as full of spears as so many hedgehogs— I dessay they got in the road of a bullet or two. They’re always gettin’ in the road of things. But we don’t talk of shootin’ blacks nowadays. These parts is too civilised — it’s risky. (Locations 1659-1665).\n\nWikipedia’s article about this novel includes excerpts from contemporary reviewers at the Daily Telegraph and The Age. Neither excerpt refers to this fictional admission about frontier warfare. Was this because the critics didn’t mention it?\n\nAnd yet, though Paterson’s story moves on without anyone remonstrating with Paddy, this brief passage in a novel that is otherwise of no particular significance, is noteworthy. Paterson was well-known and read throughout the country. It would be interesting to know if this passage was included in the original serialised version in The Leader newspaper in Melbourne as In No Man’s Land. But whatever about that, Paterson’s Australian publishers, Angus and Robertson, didn’t edit this admission out of An Outback Marriage in 1906. It shows that there were people in the early 20th century who were facing up to hard truths about settler conflicts with Indigenous people and were willing to use popular fiction to spread the message that the pioneers were not blameless heroes.\n\nFor all the flaws in this silly novel, not the least of which is its racism, for me, it puts Paterson in a new light.\n\nAuthor: A B (Banjo) Paterson\n\nTitle: An Outback Marriage, first serialised as No Man’s Land in 1900, but revised so extensively as An Outback Marriage that it is considered a new story.\n\nPublisher: Project Gutenberg, first published in 1906 by Angus & Robertson.\n\nSource: downloaded from Project Gutenberg\n\nImage credits:\n\nDodo cover: Vintage wedding dress 1920: https://vintagedancer.com/1920s/1920s-wedding-dress-history-bridesmaids-mothers/\n\nCreatespace cover : Fete entre artistes a Skagen, 1888\n\nThere’s a lot of love out there for the work of Natalia Ginzburg but I haven’t felt it myself for her debut novel The Road to the City (La strada che va in città) which I read for #WITmonth. Indeed, I was so underwhelmed that I did a little research to find out why my edition quotes the New York Times on the cover, describing her ‘One of the great Italian writers of the twentieth century.’\n\nMichael Orthofer, in The Complete Guide to Contemporary World Fiction, (Columbia University Press, 2016) devotes nine pages to a Chapter on Italy, and — in company with great Italian authors already reviewed on this blog (Alberto Moravia, Italo Calvino, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, Umberto Eco and not reviewed, but mentioned often, Primo Levi) — Natalia Ginzburg merits a paragraph:\n\nNatalia Ginzburg‘s (1916-1991) assured fiction creates a cumulative effect in which the initial sense of calm and control is eventually displaced by the very human emotions she describes. She is particularly skilful in presenting relationships and the female point of view in the novel All Our Yesterdays (1952, English 1956, originally Dead Yesterdays) in Great Britain and A Light for Fools in the United States, set during World War II, as well as the epistolary No Way (published in Great Britain as Dear Michael; 1973, English 1974) and The City and the House (1984; English 1987), in which the letter form accentuates how every character is, in a way, an island. (p.72)\n\nIn Italian Literature, a Very Short Introduction, (Oxford University Press, 2012, see my review) authors Peter Hainsworth and David Robey, Ginzburg is mentioned in passing — along with Italo Calvino and Cesare Pavese — as making their employer Einaudi the most exciting publisher in Italy; and also as one of a number of secularised Jewish writers along with Alberto Moravia, Georgio Bassani And Primo Levi whose writing is striking for its continued pessimism.\n\n(Yes, The Road to The City is certainly pessimistic.)\n\nHainsworth and Robey go on in more detail to say:\n\nOne of the authors who best articulates crucial moments of change in Italian society from the 1940s through to the 1970s is Natalia Ginzburg, an avowed non-feminist who nonetheless looks at things from a perspective quite different from that of her male contemporaries.\n\n[…]\n\nLike many other modern novelists, male and female, Ginzburg looks more to other European writers than to the Italian tradition when creating a voice for herself. From Proust, she takes a fascination with the techniques of memory; her most popular book, Lessico famigliarre (Family sayings, 1963) is an affectionate memoir of growing up in a middle-class Jewish family in Turin in the 1930s, with fascism changing from something her father can dismiss as an absurd charade into a threat to their very existences. The book’s force and often unexpected comedy come from relying on ostensibly insignificant details to bring back a whole world of the past, much as Proust does. The manner, though, owes more to the eccentrically flat style of the English novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett, whose work Ginzburg got to know when her second husband went to work at the Italian Institute in London in 1947. The result in Italian is a stylisation which many (male) critics deemed a non-style, especially in its earlier realisation, though it gradually became more relaxed, proving an ideal medium for distanced by sympathetic depictions of often deeply painful experiences. (p.110-111)\n\nPerhaps it wasn’t best to start with Ginzburg’s earliest novel. It is basically the story of a rather dreary young seventeen-year-old who yearns to escape to the city and lead the same kind of life as her sister Azalea who married at seventeen. What appeals most to Delia is that Azalea has a lover and a maid, and spends most of her days in idleness. Her only worry is that her husband might find out about her duplicity. Delia snares the son of a local doctor by getting pregnant, and although his family tries hard to prevent the marriage, the fear of scandal is greater than their ambitions for their son who is studying to be a lawyer.\n\nThe only character in the novella who loves anybody else is Delia’s cousin Nini, a man who loves to read and wants to better himself by working hard in a factory. But Delia rejects his love in favour of wealth and comfort.\n\nThe Road to the City is a novel which perhaps was ground-breaking in depicting the limited opportunities for girls and women, but it’s hard to feel much empathy with someone so lazy and selfish and shallow as Delia.\n\nA few days later I left the hospital for my new apartment. This was the beginning of a different life. Nini was dead and there was no use thinking about him. Now I had Guilio and the baby, a houseful of new furniture and bright lights and my mother-in-law in person. The maid took care of the baby and I slept late every morning in the big double bed with the orange velvet cover. There was a bell beside me if I wanted to be waited on and a rug to put my feet on when I was ready to get up. I would walk around the apartment in my wrapper, admiring the wallpaper and the furnishings, running a brush slowly through my hair and drinking a cup of coffee. […] I looked at myself in the mirror half the day and thought no other woman had ever been so beautiful. (pp.95-6)\n\nSo much for Nini!\n\nJacqui at Jacquiwine reviewed it too and Kim at Reading Matters has read quite a bit of Ginzburg so check out her reviews too.\n\nAuthor: Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991).\n\nTitle: The Road to the City (La strada che va in città)\n\nTranslated from the Italian by Frances Frenaye\n\nPublisher: Daunt Books 2021, first published 1942 under the name Alessandra Tornimparte\n\nISBN: 9780517138137, pbk., 99 pages\n\nSource: Personal library, purchased from Blarney’s Books Port Fairy\n\nRecently inducted into the WA Writers Hall of Fame, John Kinsella is an award-winning prolific poet, novelist, critic and essayist. I’ve read some of his poetry (but not reviewed it), and also his novel Hollow Earth (2019, see my review), and his verse novel Cellnight, (2023, see my review). Beam of Light is my first foray into his short fiction. This is the book description:\n\nShifts in tone, setting and narration create a sense of the uncanny in Beam of Light, Kinsella’s haunting collection of stories.\n\nA man is disturbed by the sight of a familiar dining table and chairs atop an impending bonfire of bulldozed trees, a girl finds a fox skeleton and feels compelled to protect its spirit by dispersing its bones over the valley, a couple are invited to dinner by Christians new to town – an occasion that quickly turns heavy and strange, two men awkwardly meet again when their daughters attend the same ballet class, and a man and woman struggle to balance the threats of addiction and poverty with the joys and hopes of a new baby.\n\nStories range in location from Ireland to Germany to Greece to the Australian countryside – threatened by catastrophic heat, land clearing, housing estates and strip malls – and Kinsella’s characters, so often on the edge, sear the consciousness.\n\nAddiction features in more than one story. ‘Beam of Light’ is the first story in the collection, and though Kinsella isn’t judging the characters, for me, it shines a light on the precariousness of life for babies born into such a family.\n\nUnder the overhangs of The Hills’ forests and blue metal quarries, where the couple had moved with their baby to start over, the red-brick house with its Spanish arches held them uneasy, restless. He was being treated for his addictions, though that wasn’t going so well, and she was taking an interest in continuing her education — if not going back to school, which she couldn’t stand, finding another way towards something other than what she had.\n\nHe would leave the house during the day to go nowhere, though maybe talking with the old orchardist living in his tin shed down along the thin river among his groves of citrus trees was going somewhere. They would lean against the antique tractor and talk about aphids and the baby. One morning he went to have a chat, and the old man was gone. There had been mention of a son who wanted his father to sell the orchard, which would be filled with suburb, but the old man resisted, My son, said the orchardist, is a businessman, and he will have me put in a home and take all this over and sell it to developers. (p.1)\n\nIt ends with these parents doing a bunk to make another ‘fresh start’. Depressing.\n\n‘The Couch’ was more hopeful. Again, this story features a couple and when Teddy the addict lost control wasted on meth, booze and pot, he takes it out on Ilse by taking away her favourite couch. In a way it’s almost funny because he’s too wasted to hitch up the trailer without falling over and cutting himself, but then it’s not, because it reminds the reader of other, more extreme cases, of an angry man taking away something that his wife or partner loves.\n\nShe stood with arms crossed, shaking her head, and said, To you, all I am worth is a couch — and you’re jealous of that couch because I enjoy sitting there, having a cuppa, reading, watching the goggle-box, even when you’re away. (p.26)\n\nAgain there is black humour when Teddy decided not to dump the couch, realising that he had made her life miserable… He recognises that he thought himself a real snag, a real catch and the forest collapsed down on him and the birds were laughing. The trailer jackknifes when he tries to turn it around and the couch rolls off the trailer. The mental image of this pathetic man wrestling first with the trailer and then with the couch, morphing into a Road to Damascus moment when he realises his own awfulness, is juxtaposed with his eventual return home… to be confronted by Ilse’s absence and less faded part of the carpet where the couch had been like a damnation of his putrid behaviour.\n\n‘The Couch’ left me hoping that Ilse wouldn’t be disappointed in him again.\n\nMy favourite story was ‘Entertaining the Admiral’. Two children are bewildered by the reaction of their Leftie Aunt Sally to their mother’s night out with an American admiral. Sally thinks he’s a soldier for capitalism and world domination and a war-mongering imperialist…but he turns out just to be an ordinary shallow man with attitudes out of the ark. Suzie came back from her night out that she’d hoped wouldn’t cause problems because he’d soon be gone, but she wasn’t best pleased to discover that she was just being used as a favour to the US-Australia alliance.\n\n… he behaved as if I had to be humoured and kept going on about my needing a man about the house, to raise the boy like a man and not a girl, while making it clear it wasn’t going to be him. I just got to dress up and be seen on the arm of, as far as he was concerned… I was part of his social relations duty. (p.39)\n\nI liked the Australian stories best because Kinsella is a genius at rendering the landscape and environment.\n\nThis is a generous collection: there are 29 stories altogether, all short enough to be read in under 15 minutes. Perfect for me at the moment because I’m having some fancy treatment for my eyes plus steroid eye drops so short bursts of reading suits me best for the time being.\n\nAuthor: John Kinsella\n\nTitle: Beam of Light\n\nPublisher: Transit Lounge, 2024\n\nCover design by Josh Durham\n\nISBN: 9781923023161, pbk., 272 pages\n\nReview copy courtesy of Transit Lounge\n\nLast week, in response to Pam’s comment that she needed a break from sad and serious books, I undertook a hunt for a comic novel to read and review. I’ve read quite a few though the most recent laugh-out-loud Australian one was a while ago in May last year when I read Naked Ambition (2023) by Robert Gott. It’s about a politician who commissions a full length portrait of himself in his birthday suit, and the artist wants to enter it in the Archibald Portrait Prize.\n\nIt turned out to be surprisingly difficult to find something to fit the bill. I checked bookstore websites, and Goodreads lists, and Wikipedia, but there seemed to be very little available. Publishing is going through a morbid phase…\n\nEventually I came across a parody of a recently published royal memoir. It rejoices in the title Spare Us! A Harrody… This is the book description:\n\n‘All I had ever wanted was privacy. In order to get it, it seemed that an exceptionally detailed 500,000-word book was in order…’\n\nHe was born into an ancient powerful dynasty and, through no fault of his own, became one of the most recognisable men on the planet.\n\nHis life was a constant barrage of press intrusion and manipulation. Until finally, he demanded that it stop. In order to get the privacy he so craved, he has written a warts-and-all book that goes deep inside the castle walls and exposes every shouting match, fist-fight, betrayal, teddy bear, awkward hug and tear-stained wedding rehearsal for the world to feast their eyes on. All for privacy!\n\nThis is his story.\n\nAlas, the title and the book description seem to have exhausted the author’s capacity for humour. I’m sorry, Pam, Spare Us! is spectacularly unfunny with pitifully weak one-liners that fall flat in chapter after chapter.\n\nChapter 47\n\nShe was even more ravishing in person than she had seemed from her pictures. I couldn’t believe my eyes.\n\nWhat was best about her was that she couldn’t care twopence that I was a royal. It was perfect.\n\n‘I hear that you are in the hit US TV drama Suits, I said.\n\n‘It’s a seemingly never-ending soap opera about tiresome, privileged people bitching, manipulating and betraying each other for power,’ she replied.\n\n‘Let’s not talk about my family,’ I said. ‘Tell me about Suits.’ (p.75)\n\n*Yawn*\n\nTo be fair, maybe I was missing something because I haven’t read anything about the royals since I was about twelve. My mother had a small collection of Pitkin Pictorials commemorating various royal events. I remember reading the one that commemorated Princess Margaret’s ill fated marriage: I had a mild interest in fashion at that age and enjoyed the contrast between the elegant simplicity of Princess Margaret’s dress and the fussiness of her sister’s. I have favoured simple unfussy clothes ever since so I therefore can’t say that I escaped royal influence altogether. In time I emulated that simplicity (at considerably less expense) for my own wedding dress… though I haven’t worn a dress since then.\n\nBut I did not watch That Funeral or the other ones, or any of Those Weddings, or the Coronation. The birth of more royal parasites has passed me by. All I know about The Spare is that his mother died in a car crash when he was a little boy, that he went to the usual British public schools, that he wore a Nazi uniform to a party, was in the army for a while, and that he married an American. I most certainly did not read the memoir which the author is trying to spoof in Spare Us!\n\nWould it have amused me if I had read the original? I doubt it.\n\nBruno Vincent is the author of the Enid Blyton for Grown-ups Series, and now I suspect that the titles are possibly also the funniest elements in those books too:\n\nFive Give Up the Booze\n\nFive Go Absolutely Nowhere\n\nFive Get Beach Body Ready\n\nOver to you, dear readers… what comic novels can you recommend for Pam?\n\nAuthor: Bruno Vincent\n\nTitle: Spare Us!

I have the complete series on DVD, and I’m currently watching it again because I can’t read much at night after some bothersome eye treatment.\n\nFor those who haven’t seen it, Wikipedia tells us that…\n\nFoyle’s War is a British detective drama television series set during and shortly after the Second World War, created by Midsomer Murders screenwriter and author Anthony Horowitz and commissioned by ITV after the long-running series Inspector Morse ended in 2000. It began broadcasting on ITV in October 2002. ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps cancelled Foyle’s War in 2007, but Peter Fincham (Shaps’ replacement) revived the programme after good ratings for 2008’s fifth series. The final episode was broadcast on 18 January 2015, after eight series.\n\n[…]\n\nThe series is also notable for its attention to historical detail, and the drama is frequently moved along by historical events of the Second World War. Horowitz considered that to honour the veterans of the war it was important to get the details correct\n\nMy father, who hardly ever watched TV, really enjoyed Foyle’s War, and if I’d known of its existence back in the day, I would have bought him a copy of Rod Green’s TV tie-in The Real History Behind Foyle’s War (2006). With a Foreword by the screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, it’s a terrific book, meticulously researched to show just how realistic the series is.\n\nWhile the commonly-held perception of our nation at war is that of the people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the face of adversity, the activities of those who lurked in the shadows of the blackout touched the lives of almost everyone. (p.12)\n\nThe police had a massive role to play in WW2. With an acute manpower shortage due to enlistments even though it was a reserved occupation, hastily trained young recruits and officers brought out of retirement had to deal with a huge workload. Beside all the usual criminal activities, there was widespread looting, racketeering and black marketing. Scams and organised gangs operated just as in the series, targeting victims when they were at their most vulnerable, and because of the greater availability of guns, there was a 22% increase in the murder rate, while the overall crime rate rose by 57%. There was more violent crime too: Army-issue revolvers bought from Canadian soldiers were known to cost as little as £7 but more sophisticated weaponry could be purloined if you knew where to find it.\n\nSometimes weapons were stolen from poorly secured Home Guard stores:\n\n[There was a case of] four teenagers who, armed with sten sub-machine guns and a rifle acquired from a Home Guard Store, robbed the Ambassador cinema in Hayes. Two youths, escaping from a remand home, went on the run with a Tommy gun and 400 rounds of ammunition they stole from a Home Guard depot at Upper Norwood. (p.51)\n\nAnd yes, in real life, British police officers patrolled unarmed, and they mostly still don’t carry guns. (They were unarmed here in Australia until the 1970s and they weren’t routinely openly armed until the mid 1980s.)\n\nThe episode that shows Foyle tracking down the theft of fuel in commercial quantities is authentic, as is the episode that shows farmers hiding their livestock from the authorities. So is the episode involving sheep infected by germ warfare testing on Gruinard Island.\n\nHastings, which really was on the front line and at risk from German invasion, suffered 85 enemy air-raids.\n\nThe Luftwaffe dropped over 750 incendiaries as well as 550 high explosive bombs, and 15 VI flying bombs fell on the area. More than 700 people were injured and 154 killed. The death of Sam’s friend when their lodgings are bombed in the episode ‘Fifty Ships’ or the destruction of the local pub and the death of a barmaid in ‘The German Woman’ sadly reflect actual events. In Hastings almost 450 houses were demolished either by direct hits or because bomb damage had left them too dangerously unstable to be allowed to remain standing. Almost half the inhabitants were evacuated from the town, the pre-war population of 65,000 dropping to just 34,000 during hostilities. The evacuations were not only to keep people safe from the bombing but were deemed necessary because Hastings was expected to become one of the focal points of the imminent German invasion. (p.8)\n\nIt was fascinating to read about the German spies who actually did land on the beach and make their way inland, only to be captured. It seems they really were as badly-prepared and poorly briefed as the spy in the episode ‘Fifty Ships’.\n\nReal spies made the same sort of error, blundering into military patrols near the coast while wearing wet clothing, asking for directions in an accent that aroused suspicion, or, in the case of Carl Meier, walking into a pub in Lydd one morning after landing at Dungeness (not far from Hastings) and asking the landlady for a pint of cider outside of normal licensing hours. (p12)\n\nPostwar research with German documentation shows that all 115 German spies were detected and either ‘turned’ to the British cause or were sent to the gallows.\n\nThis book offers a surprising insight into law and order on the Home Front.

He pushed on through mist and darkness and clutched the blanket tight under his neck with his bony fist. Nothing in the darkness could scare him. He was darkness itself.\n\nMissing in every sense of the word, a man walks into the landscape and doesn’t stop. In all weather and across all kinds of terrain, Ingvar walks until he can go no further, then gets up and does it again the following day, week after week, month after month. For three years he doesn’t know why he keeps going, or whether he is walking towards something or away from it.\n\nUntil he comes to a remote tropical valley harbouring secrets and misfits. There a recently widowed woman, Hilda, allows Ingvar to live in a shed on her property. He hasn’t spoken for three years and Hilda chats frequently with her dead husband, but somehow they tolerate each other as they both struggle with the haunting impact of their pasts and grief that won’t let them go.\n\nAs it says on his website, Cameron Stewart is interested in flawed characters trying to do their best. His flawed character in Why Do Horses Run? is Ingvar — who walks out of his own life and tramps like a modern-day swaggie for three years in the solitude of the Australian bush, rendered in exquisite detail by an author who knows it intimately.\n\nIngvar sleeps rough, and he speaks to no one, but carries a notepad to briefly communicate his needs when necessary. Refusing all engagement with other people, he keeps a journal which gradually reveals his pain and guilt to the reader, and his daughter Lotte ‘speaks to him’ from the afterlife.\n\nIngvar’s wanderings halt when he encounters the widow Hilda, who is not yet ready to cast off the remnants of the life she had with a philandering husband, and there are intimations that some kind of healing could begin. He encounters both kindness and cruelty in the local community, but he’s not ready for friendship and he rejects any kind of solace.\n\nMayor, a wise old Bunjalung man, finds Ingvar drunk down at the river, and tries to give Ingvar a sense of perspective. He knows that the books can’t ever be balanced, and he recognises the self-inflicted harm:\n\n‘Youve done a number on yourself, young fella. Driven yourself into a ditch. Come over to my place. I’ll get some food into you.’ (p.217)\n\nBut Ingvar blunders off into the bush with his tequila. He has to get away from humans and their words.\n\nNo reader could be indifferent to this man’s profound grief as he punishes himself for what he has done. And yet…\n\n… I kept thinking of the character who is offstage and has no voice for the entire novel: Lotte’s mother Isobel who has lost both her daughter and her husband. She is doubly bereaved. When a local copper joins the dots on the Missing Person’s Register and suggests to Ingvar that he could at least let his wife know, Ingvar refuses.\n\nYou know those stories that surface in the media from time to time? Single mothers bearing the burden of multiple births or profoundly disabled children or some catastrophic event like the loss of everything in a natural disaster, alone because their husbands couldn’t cope? Though there were two of them doing the parenting, the husband can’t cope, so he shoots through. Leaving one parent to carry the burden that is too heavy for two — alone. In the copper’s gentle suggestion that Ingvar be registered as ‘found’, Stewart’s novel gives us a glimpse of those left behind. A woman suffering the torment of not knowing where Ingvar is or even if he is alive.\n\nWhy Do Horses Run? shows us a man in despair, and as Chris Gordon writes in her review it at Readings, it’s a novel that reminds us not to judge. But there are two people in this tragedy and one of them has been abandoned.\n\nGrief is different for everyone, and people deal with it in different ways. But in the quest for absolution, Ingvar has left wreckage behind him. This novel raises some profound questions for book groups to mull over.\n\nJennifer at Tasmanian Bibliophile at Large reviewed it too.\n\nAuthor: Cameron Stewart\n\nTitle: Why Do Horses Run?\n\nPublisher: Allen & Unwin, 2024\n\nISBN: 9781761069659, pbk., 314 pages\n\nSource: review copy courtesy of Allen & Unwin, via the author\n\nDuring the month of April, Stu from Winston’s Dad was featured as a guest curator at GLLI (Global Literature in Libraries), and amongst other books that he featured was this one, Stone in a Landslide by Catalan author Maria Barbal, translated by Laura McGloughlin and Paul Mitchell. First published in 1985, it wasn’t published in English until 2010 by Peirene Press, and was, after Beside the Sea (2001) by Veronique Olmi, (translated by Adriana Hunter) second in their translations series featuring ‘the female voice’.\n\nBut it is also listed at Goodreads first in the series Cicle del Pallars #1, and with the help of Google Translate, I have learned that the cycle is completed by three more books, as yet untranslated…\n\nPedra de Tartera (Stone in a Landslide)\n\nMel i metzines (1990, Honey and Honeydew);\n\nCàmfora (1992, Camphor) and\n\nPaís íntim (2005, Intimate Country).\n\nThey are all set in Maria Barbal’s native Pallars, linked by the life maturation process of their characters. The tetralogy is described as written in a precise, sober prose, stripped of any narrative artifice.\n\nBarbal’s achievement in Stone in a Landslide is to render an illiterate peasant woman’s narrative convincing. Conxa has had only a rudimentary education, three winters, and she was lucky to get it because unless you had older sisters to do all the work at home, you didn’t go to school if you were a girl. But since her lessons were all delivered in Spanish, not her native Catalan, she didn’t understand most of it and soon forgot it all.\n\nAs she tells us later in her narrative, in her world it is women who do most of the work. It is her duty to her family to accept the decisions of others and not to complain. Reading between the lines, we see how Barbal shows us where women and girls are in the social order. When Conxa was uprooted from all that was familiar and sent to live (and work) with her childless aunt and uncle — while his wife does the farm work at home — her uncle who comes to collect her, rides a donkey, while Conxa walks all the way in her sister’s shoes that don’t fit.\n\nAnyone could see that there were a lot of us at home. Someone had to go. I was the fifth of six children – Mother used to say I was there because God had wanted me to be there and you have to take what He sends you. The eldest was Maria, who, more than Mother, ran the house. Josep was the son and heir and Joan was going into the church. We three youngest were told a hundred times that we were more of a burden than a blessing. These weren’t years of plenty, there were a lot of mouths to feed and not much land, which of course left a hole. So it was decided that I, who was level-headed and even-tempered, would be sent to help my mother’s sister, Tia. She’d given up hope of having children but wasn’t short of work. She had married a man much older than her who owned land, at least half a dozen cows, poultry and rabbits, as well as a vegetable garden. They got by well enough, but they could do with an extra pair of hands and with the company because they were starting to feel their age. I was thirteen when, with a bundle of clothes in my arms, my father on my left and Maria on my right, I left my family, home, village and mountain. It was just a few kilometres between Ermita and Pallarès, but it meant a day’s walk and losing sight of home. At the time, this hurt me more than anything else. As I walked away, I left the only world I had ever known behind. (p. 6)\n\nLooking back over her long and hard life, Conxa remembers that these years with her aunt and uncle turned out to be the best of her life. As heir to their small farm, she gradually becomes accepted in their village and eventually marries Jaume, a good, kind and loving man. He is accepted as a suitor because he agrees that they will live with Aunt Tia and her husband, that Conxa will continue to work on the farm, and that he will hand over what money he earns elsewhere to the family. They have three children, Elvira, Angeleta and the longed-for boy.\n\nBut in the winters he goes away to work at his trade, and fatally, he comes in contact with supporters of Spain’s short-lived Republic.\n\nAs history tells us, disaster strikes the Republic. Conxa is buffeted about by events which she does not understand and over which she has no control. In prison with her girls, Conxa feels like a stone after a landslide.\n\nIf someone or something stirs it, I’ll come tumbling down with the others. If nothing comes near, I’ll be here, still, for days and days…\n\nAngeleta doesn’t move either, clinging to my skirts. All of us are women and children. At least fifteen. What we have in common is that someone close to us has been taken. For a while no one says anything. Then, timidly, someone begins to talk.\n\nOur side of the river had already been taken by the nationalists, the Blackshirts. The other side was still in the hands of the Reds. There were families who wanted to cross to the Red side, which you did by the Algorri bridge. After the guard there was killed last night, the way over was clear. They say that they spoke to all the rich families in the valley. A priest gave some names too. That’s how they knew who to take. (pp. 59-60).\n\nIn her economical way, Barbal thus shows the role of the Catholic Church in helping the wealthy to sabotage the democratically elected Republic. And over the course of this narrative she shows the melancholy history of the mostly anonymous victims of the Civil War.\n\nFiction about the Spanish Civil War began to emerge from Spain with the death of the dictator Franco in 1975. Prior to that there were famous titles written from outside of Spain, such as For Whom The Bell Tolls (1940), by Ernest Hemingway and George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia, (1938). From exile in France in 1962, Mercé Roderedo wrote La plaça del diamant (In Diamond Square, also translated as The Time of the Doves, (see my review). In the Night of Time (2009), by Antonio Muñoz Moline, translated by Edith Grossman came to prominence when it was nominated for the 2014 BTBA Best Translated Book Award for Fiction longlist and the European Book Prize for Fiction (2012). But to the best of my knowledge, Maria Barbal is the first to write about the Civil War from the perspective of peasants living a subsistence lifestyle in rural Spain.\n\nBack in April Stu wasn’t focussing on #WITmonth which takes place in August, but he featured these women writers in translation, which you can add to your reading list!

This is why it is crucial to discuss it with family and make sure that they understand your wishes.\n\nI’ll Leave You With This is valuable in this context because it so clearly depicts differences of opinion within the family. The plot revolves around the idea of tracing the recipients of a transplant, i.e. not about the original decision to donate a brother’s organs, but it depicts how different values within the same family could so easily have derailed the donation in the first place.\n\nThis is the blurb:\n\nI’ll Leave You With This is a heartbreaking, funny, thought-provoking and honest novel about a brother’s legacy and the tangled bonds of sisterhood.\n\nThe O’Shea sisters couldn’t be more different.\n\nAllison, an obstetrician, has always put others before herself and is torn between her job and young family.\n\nPrizewinning film director Bridie hasn’t had work in over a decade, though her actor husband is on the brink of stardom.\n\nClare, desperate for a baby, is bereft when her wife leaves her after their latest IVF failure.\n\nAnd Emma, the youngest, has turned to God to fill the aching loneliness in her life.\n\nWhen their only brother Daniel is killed the four women drift even further apart…\n\nThen, on the third anniversary of Daniel’s death, Clare proposes an idea: they should trace the many recipients saved by his donated organs. Perhaps their brother’s gift of life can bring them back together again?\n\nThe novel ‘about organ donation’ is really a novel about sisters, which is why Kylie Ladd — who is a practising a neuro-psychologist — has included a quotation from her research at the beginning of the book:\n\nCerney (1993) argues that to understand the response of the donor family to specific aspects of their bereavement, one should understand their previous functioning.\n\nI’ll Leave You With This is published by Michael Joseph, an imprint of Penguin Random House, 2022, ISBN 9780143778950.\n\nPS One other snippet from the talk: Kylie’s fifth novel, The Way Back, is being made into a movie. They have a cast, and a script, and have shot the opening scene… now all that’s needed is the funding.

And for once I have read it… you can see my review here.\n\nThe obvious connection is to another book with ‘museum’ in the title. Death in the Museum of Modern Art (2014), by Alma Lazarevska, translated by Celia Hawkesworth, is a collection of short stories from a survivor of the siege of Sarajevo. (See my review here.)\n\nIt’s a good choice for #WITmonth, because (apart from being a book written by a woman in translation) it leads me to another book about a siege that I have just bought to read for #WITmonth… Recommended by Meytal who initiated #WITmonth and has collated reading lists on her website, it’s called Living Pictures, by Polina Barskova, translated by Catherine Ciepiela. I read the book description at Goodreads: an innovative, kaleidoscopic literary work about the Siege of Leningrad and its aftermath by one of Russia’s most acclaimed contemporary writers — and I wanted to read it because I will never forget my experience of visiting the memorial to the Siege of Leningrad in 2012. We had been swanning about doing touristy things in St Petersburg, museums and palaces and a canal cruise and so on, and all the while there was no mention anywhere of the million people who died in the city during the Nazi blockade of 1941-44. But on our last day, en route to Catherine’s Palace at Pushkin, our guide stopped at the Victory Monument, and reminded us to be respectful at the memorial because almost everyone in St Petersburg had lost someone in the war. And I realised that among the old people that I occasionally saw in the streets, there would have been survivors of that horror. It was chastening.\n\nLiving Pictures and the siege it commemorates brings me back to art, with The Madonnas of Leningrad (2006), by Debra Dean. As I said in my review I was expecting it to be a disappointment, and so would you if you could see the awful cover design of the edition I read, scroll to the bottom of my review to see it. But I found instead that it was …\n\n… an authentic portrayal of a family coming to terms with a parent ageing with Alzheimer’s; it brings to life the spirit of the people during the 1941-44 (872 days) German Siege of Leningrad during WWII, and it is a magical evocation of the Hermitage artwork which was stored for safety during the bombardment.\n\nPerhaps it’s because there is greater awareness of dementia these days, because more people live long enough to succumb to it, there are more stories that remind us to be more empathetic. One of the best of these is Ashley Hay’s tender and respectful portrait of Elsie in A Hundred Small Lessons (2017, see my review.) Elsie is an old lady who used to live in Lucy and Ben’s house, but now lives in an aged care home, and — lost in the past — she ‘escapes’ from time to time and goes ‘home’. The novel is also a love song to the river that threads through Brisbane…\n\nAnd that reminds me of Simon Cleary’s debut novel The Comfort of Figs (2008, see my review). It’s a fine story which links the dangers inherent in the building of Brisbane’s Story Bridge over that same river with present day violence and trauma.\n\nSimon has since written other fine novels, see here, and now has a new book out which is called Everything is Water. It’s a memoir of his pilgrimage along the Brisbane river from the source to the mouth. He walked the 344 kilometres of the banks of the river for four weeks, and you can read more about the book at his website.\n\nAnd that brings me finally to the book I’ve just read. Cameron Stewart’s debut novel Why Do Horses Run? is about a man mired in grief who abandons his old life and simply walks into being a missing person. He walks for three years, living off the land and not speaking to a soul. This is part of the book description from the back of the book.\n\nMissing in every sense of the word, a man walks into the landscape and doesn’t stop. In all weather and across all kinds of terrain, Ingvar walks until he can go no further, then gets up and does it again the following day, week after week, month after month. For three years he doesn’t know why he keeps going, or whether he is walking towards something or away from it.\n\nFrom a novel that’s about the more extreme of art forms to a story of losing one’s way in life, that’s my #6Degrees for this month!\n\nNext month (September, 2024), the starter book is After Story by Larissa Behrendt of the Eualeyai/Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay people, and (this makes two months in a row!) I’ve read it."
