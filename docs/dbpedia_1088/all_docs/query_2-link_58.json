It has a wide range of applications in shallow tunneling projects all over the world. In this study, numerical modeling of the third-line Metro tunnel in Tehran, which is designed and stabilized by the NATM, is under discussion. The foregoing tunnel is excavated manually with a one-meter advancing step. In this project, the constructors use a lattice girder and spray concrete with 31 cm thickness as the initial lining. A suitable numerical software for this modeling is PLAXIS 3D Tunnel, which allows high-resolution finite element modeling (FEM) of the studied object. The performance of this method is investigated and compared with that of other NATMs. The numerical modeling yielded a value of 30.01 mm for earth subsidence in the most damaged area of the settlement, which was confirmed with a dramatically low difference by earth surface monitoring. Moreover, this tunnel was drilled and excavated using various methods, among which the least settlement was obtained by the proposed method. The results are promising, and they indicate that tunneling with this method should continue to be used to expand the subway line in the city.

This study introduces an innovative approach to predicting ICU mortality by seamlessly integrating electronic health record (EHR) data with a BERTopic-based hybrid machine-learning methodology. The MIMIC-III database serves as the primary data source, encompassing structured and unstructured data from 6606 ICU-admitted heart-failure patients. Unstructured data are processed using BERTopic, complemented by machine-learning algorithms for prediction and performance evaluation. The results indicate that the inclusion of unstructured data significantly enhances the model’s predictive accuracy regarding patient mortality. The amalgamation of structured and unstructured data effectively identifies key variables, enhancing the precision of the predictive model. The developed model demonstrates potential in improving healthcare decision-making, elevating patient outcomes, and optimizing resource allocation within the ICU setting. The handling and application of unstructured data emphasize the utilization of clinical narrative records by healthcare professionals, elevating this research beyond the traditional structured data predictive tools. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse in critical care and predictive modeling, offering valuable insights into the potential of integrating unstructured data into healthcare analytics.

In real-world applications, it is critical to accurately estimate the path loss parameter in communication channels due to the variable and complex propagation environments often encountered in inter-vehicle communication scenarios. This paper presents a study on various machine learning methods to improve path loss estimation in V2V communication using a dataset (192,000 observations) obtained from field measurements of highway environments in the Trabzon and Gümüşhane provinces in Türkiye. For this purpose, path loss estimation was carried out with different machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, and AdaBoost by using various environmental and system features. Then, performance comparisons were conducted between machine learning methods and traditional empirical approaches such as log-distance, two-ray, and log-ray. Examining the outputs reveals that machine learning methods outperform traditional methods and yield results quickly. As a result, the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting methods demonstrated the highest prediction performances, with R2 values of 0.97 and 0.96, MAE values of 0.0557 and 0.0701, and RMSE values of 0.0774 and 0.0964, respectively, outperforming both empirical methods, other machine learning techniques, and the existing studies based on V2V. Overall, our study provides significant contributions to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive parameter set for highway environments, examining the path loss prediction performance of machine learning models with different capabilities, and comparing them with traditional methods. This study not only fills a critical gap in the existing literature but also highlights the necessity, efficiency, and originality of machine learning approaches for improving reliable V2V communication systems.

The advent of AI technology has made comprehensive and in-depth teaching evaluation possible, serving as a significant driving force for efficient and precise teaching. There were few empirical studies on the application of high-quality precision teaching models in the field of compulsory education, and the learning difficulty of technology and the teaching burden on teachers have become significant factors hindering the use of technology to support education. This study analyzed teaching models from the perspectives of teachers’ teaching burdens and students’ learning obstacles, and was committed to relying on intelligent technology to construct a new precision teaching model, an educational diagnosis–feedback–intervention path that covered the entire teaching process, from the dimensions of teacher behavior, student behavior, and parent behavior, aiming to assist teachers in efficient teaching and students in personalized learning. This study was conducted with nine science classes, including about 540 people in the second year of high school at a Middle School in China; six classes were the intervention groups while the last three classes were control groups, and a survey of 19 teachers from the intervention classes was carried out. The results showed that this model can significantly improve students’ academic performance in science subjects, especially in mathematics and chemistry. It has increased the proportion of high-achieving students, reduced the proportion of low-achieving students, stimulated students’ self-directed learning ability, cultivated a positive attitude towards science learning, and explained the key points of using a precision teaching model in different disciplines. It has achieved a deep integration of education and technology, helping to increase the efficiency and reduce the burden of teaching.

For large-scale problems, the BEM system is solved iteratively by speeding up matrix-to-vector multiplications by applying a kernel-independent fast multipole method. Multiplication starts with source-to-multipole (S2M) translations, whose accuracy predefines the overall accuracy. We aim to increase the accuracy of these translations. The intensities of sources are assembled into clusters by an algorithm suggested. Each of them is characterized by its representative source, whose intensity equals the sum of the intensities of cluster sources. Thus, with growing distance, its field tends toward the field of the cluster. The accuracy of S2M translations is increased by subtracting from and adding to the far field of the cluster the far field of its representative source, and by using the proposed modified kernel to evaluate the difference of the fields, which decreases faster than the field of the cluster itself. Numerical results for typical kernels show a notable increase in the accuracy provided by the modified S2M translations. Keeping in them merely the added field is acceptable for many practical applications. This simplifies the modified S2M translations by avoiding calculation and storing matrices specific to each of the clusters. The improved translations may be also used for multipole-to-multipole translations, performed on next, after leaves, levels in upward running a hierarchical tree.

The flexibility of these elegant bridges poses great challenges for designers to minimize their deformability under asymmetrical operational loads. Due to the small initial sag, such load-bearing structures also cause significant tensile forces, which requires them to have large cross-sections and massive anchor foundations. This paper analyzes an innovative suspension steel bridge structure combined with a string and a cable. More attention is paid to asymmetric loading as this is more relevant for suspension structures. The new structure is studied numerically and experimentally. It is established that the string stabilizes the displacements of the bridge under asymmetric loading. The stabilization efficiency is proportional to the value of the pre-tension force of the string. The obtained results reveal the behavior of the structure and enable an evaluation of the accuracy of the numerical results, as well as the applied modeling. In addition, the experimentally obtained results allow the evaluation of more aspects of the behavior of the new bridge, which will be useful in further studies of this type of structures.

In order to create a healthy and benign online environment, it is necessary to recognize and detect these sensitive images. Current techniques for detecting pornographic content are still in an immature stage, with the key issue being low detection accuracy. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for detecting pornographic content based on an improved YOLOv8 model. Firstly, InceptionNeXt is introduced into the backbone network to enhance the model’s adaptability to images of different scales and complexities by optimizing feature extraction through parallel branches and deep convolution. Simultaneously, the SPPF module is simplified into the SimCSPSPPF module, which further enhances the effectiveness and diversity of features through improved spatial pyramid pooling and cross-layer feature fusion. Secondly, switchable dilated convolutions are incorporated to improve the adaptability of the C2f enhancement model and enhance the model’s detection capability. Finally, SEAattention is introduced to enhance the model’s ability to capture spatial details. The experiments demonstrate that the model achieves an [email protected] of 79.7% on our self-made sensitive image dataset, which is a significant improvement of 5.9% compared to the previous YOLOv8n network. The proposed method excels in handling complex backgrounds, targets of varying scales, and resource-constrained scenarios, while simultaneously improving the model’s computational efficiency without compromising detection accuracy, making it more advantageous for practical applications.

The experimental results obtained from the hygroscopic behavior analysis were used to create a primary dataset to train and test Decision Tree Regression (DTR) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) models. The created primary dataset comprised 294 observations, from which 80% were used to train the models, and the remaining 20% were used for the testing of the two models. The models exhibited high accuracy, easy interpretability on the small-size dataset, and flexibility with regards to the nature of the relationship between the input and output variable. Both models successfully predicted the hygroscopic behavior with the Gradient Boosting Regressor outperforming Decision Tree Regression by indicating values of 0.012, 0.109, 0.059, and 0.999 for MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2, respectively, during the desorption of the BNF, and values of 0.012, 0.109, 0.059, and 0.999 for MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2, respectively, during the desorption of the BNF. This suggests that the Gradient Boosting Regressor illustrated the maximum accuracy. The outcomes can be utilized to provide an alternative for traditional methods, which can often be costly and time-consuming by improving the engineering properties of BNF. The models can be used in the construction sector to lower costs as they are able to pinpoint elements influencing the characteristics for specific applications to grasp its various properties through the prediction of its hygroscopic properties.

Therefore, this study develops a framework for assessing population-urbanization–ecological environment interactions by combining the coupling coordination degree model and the decoupling index. Firstly, the proposed framework establishes an indicator system of population, economy, society, space, environmental pressure, ecological governance, ecological status, and ecological services based on two sets of national census data; secondly, this study combines the coupling coordination degree model and decoupling index to comprehensively understand the coupling coordination relationship and the decoupling relationship of the population–urbanization–ecological environment across time and space. Overall, this study contributes to a deepened understanding of coupled population–urbanization–ecological environment interactions and provides a scientific basis for effective guidance on urban–rural management and the balance between human development and environmental protection.

Unlike traditional database systems such as relational databases, KV stores manage data in key–value pairs and do not support relationships between the data. This simplicity enables KV stores to offer higher performance. To further improve the performance of KV stores, high-performance storage devices such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and non-volatile memory express (NVMe) SSDs have been widely adopted. These devices are intended to expedite data processing and storage. However, our studies indicate that, due to a lack of multi-thread-oriented programming, the performance of KV stores is far below the raw performance of high-performance storage devices. In this paper, we analyze the performance of existing KV stores utilizing high-performance storage devices. Our analysis reveals that the actual performance of KV stores is below the potential performance that these storage devices could offer. According to the profiling results, we argue that this performance gap is due to the coarse-grained locking mechanisms of existing KV stores. To alleviate this issue, we propose a multi-threaded compaction operation that leverages idle threads to participate in I/O operations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can improve the performance of KV stores by up to 16% by increasing the number of threads involved in I/O operations.

To respond to new consumption trends, research in winemaking focuses on optimizing the technological process to increase quality while preserving the traditional character and typicality of the product. Lately, winemakers are implementing a range of physical non-thermal (ultrasound technology and cold plasma technology) and thermal (microwave treatment) processes to streamline and optimize winemaking technologies, reduce costs, speed up production, and improve sustainability. This study examines the existing literature regarding the effects of various physical approaches on the quality of wines. Scientific articles are concentrating on enhancing the extraction of phenolic compounds and other active compounds—especially those that contribute positively to wine quality. The reviewed literature only offers a limited amount of information on this subject; further investigation is required to determine the significance, applicability, and efficacy of thermal and non-thermal procedures in the wine industry.

To enhance their independence, we propose a robotic system that facilitates greater autonomy. Our approach involves a functional assistive robotic implementation for picking, placing, and delivering containers using the TIAGo mobile manipulator robot. We developed software and routines for detecting containers marked with an ArUco code and manipulating them using the MoveIt library. Subsequently, the robot navigates to specific points of interest within a room to deliver the container to the user or another designated location. This assistance task is commanded through a user interface based on a web application that can be accessed from the personal phones of patients. The functionality of the system was validated through testing. Additionally, a series of user trials were conducted, yielding positive feedback on the performance and the demonstration. Insights gained from user feedback will be incorporated into future improvements to the system.

The extraction efficiency of the bioactive compounds by ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was also evaluated. Extraction with 80% ethanol achieved the highest extraction yields, and the optimal conditions for the extraction of TSC were 60 min, 57 °C and an 80 mL/g solvent-to-material ratio. The optimal conditions for the recovery of TPC were 178 min, 45 °C and a solvent-to-material ratio of 68 mL/g. The highest antioxidant activity of the extracts from Curculigo orchioides Gaertn rhizomes was obtained with the optimal conditions of 180 min, 40 °C and an 80 mL/g solvent-to-material ratio. The actual extraction yields obtained from the optimal conditions were 11.33 mg aescin equivalents (AE)/g dry weight (DW) for TSC, 23.58 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g DW for TPC and DPPH antioxidant activity of 133.45 µM Trolox equivalents (TE)/g DW. UAE using the same type and amount of solvent for only 10 min could result in comparable extraction yields of TSC, TPC and DPPH antioxidant activity to the 180 min conventional extraction process. These promising results suggest the potential for the development of effective extraction processes to recover bioactive compounds from Curculigo orchioides Gaertn rhizomes in practical production.

It is essential for the flow of inputs and outputs, and for certain Amazon cities, boat access is the only option. Fuel consumption accounts for over 25% of a vessel’s total operational costs. Shipping companies are therefore seeking procedures and technologies to reduce energy consumption. This research aimed to develop a fuel consumption prediction model for vessels operating in the Amazon region. Machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Tree, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost can be used for this purpose. The input variables were based on the main design characteristics of the vessels, such as length and draft. Through metrics like mean, median, and coefficient of determination (R2), six different algorithms were assessed. CatBoost was identified as the model with the best performance and suitability for the data. Indeed, it achieved an R2 value higher than 91% in predicting and optimizing fuel consumption for vessels operating in the Amazon and similar regions.

We analyzed 5 years of measurement data (2016–2020) for cleaning workers across various industries in Korea, and conducted an exposure survey and health risk assessment for the two most frequently measured substances (i.e., 2-butoxyethanol and sodium hydroxide) and representative substances generated by their combined use (i.e., chlorine and chloroform). The findings indicate that when chlorine was generated by mixing hypochlorite-based disinfectants (e.g., bleach) with acidic cleaners containing substances such as nitric, hydrochloric, or citric acid, the risk index for chlorine gas (based on the 95th percentile exposure values) was 5.65 in the facility management cleaning industry, exceeding the acceptable threshold of 1. Because of the high usage and exposure frequency of cleaning and disinfecting agents and the common practice of mixing multiple products to enhance cleaning efficacy, it is necessary to manage hazardous risk factors by providing education on appropriate working methods, supplying personal protective equipment, and installing ventilation systems for these workers. Further research on the health risk assessment of combined chemical use is needed.

Previous research has mainly focused on individual additives in clay soils. In contrast, this study investigates soil improvement with two different types of waste materials simultaneously. The improvement of soil properties by hybrid waste materials was evaluated using several laboratory tests, including the standard Proctor test, the unconfined compressive strength test, the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test, and cyclic triaxial tests. The aim of this research is to identify key parameters for the design and construction of road pavements and to demonstrate that improving the subgrade with hybrid waste materials contributes significantly to the sustainability of road construction. The mechanical and physical properties were evaluated in detail to determine the optimal mixtures. The results show that the most effective mixture for the combination of waste glass powder and rubber tires contains 20% glass powder and 3% rubber tires, based on the dry weight of the soil. For the combination of waste glass powder and lignin, the optimum mixture consists of 15% glass powder and 15% lignin, based on the dry weight of the soil. These results provide valuable insights into the sustainable use of waste materials for soil stabilization in road construction projects.

This study focuses on an MLCP with a surface area of 3311 m2 and a height of 12 m, considering design constraints such as a floor load capacity of 5 kN/m2 and the requirement for a consistent energy discharge over a 12 h period. The research identifies a Turgo turbine as the optimal choice, providing a power output of 2.9 kW at a flow rate of 0.03 m3/s with an efficiency of 85%. This system, capable of storing 1655.5 m3 of water, can supply power to 289 light bulbs (each consuming 10 W) for 15.3 h, thus having the capacity to support up to three MLCPs. These results underscore the environmental advantages of PHES over conventional batteries, highlighting its potential for integration with solar panels to decrease carbon emissions. This approach not only aligns with Singapore’s green initiatives but also promotes the development of a more sustainable energy infrastructure.

The AM process for ceramic components, known as Ultraviolet Laser Stereolithography (SLA), enables the fabrication of unique parts or small batches without substantial investments in molds and dies, and avoids the problems associated with traditional manufacturing, which involves multiple stages and final machining for precision. This study addresses the need to produce reference elements or targets for metrological applications, including verification, adjustment, or calibration of 3D scanners and mid- to high-range optical sensors. Precision spheres are a primary geometry in this context due to their straightforward mathematical definition, facilitating rapid and accurate error detection in equipment. Our objective is to exploit this novel SLA process along with the advantageous optical properties of technical ceramics (such as being white, matte, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant) to materialize these reference objects. Specifically, this work involves the fabrication of alumina hemispheres using SLA. The manufacturing process incorporates four design variables (wall thickness, support shape, fill type, and orientation) and one manufacturing variable (the arrangement of spheres on the printing tray). To evaluate the impact of the design variables, dimensional and geometric parameters (GD&T), including diameters, form errors, and their distribution on the surface of the sphere, have been characterized. These measurements are conducted with high accuracy using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The study also examines the influence of these variables in the dimensional and geometric accuracy of the spheres. Correlations between various parameters were identified, specifically highlighting critical factors affecting process precision, such as the position of the piece on the print tray and the wall thickness value. The smallest diameter errors were recorded at the outermost positions of the tray (rear and front), while the smallest shape errors were found at the central position, in both cases with errors in the range of tens of micrometers. In any case, the smallest deformations were observed with the highest wall thickness (2 mm).
