        "text": "* The Blue Jays fielded a replacement team in the spring of 1995 some 20 years ago before a judge ruled April 7 that the owners bargained in bad faith. Meanwhile, World Series MVP Paul Molitor, above, was on the labour committee for the Player's Association in talks with management. ....\n\n2014 Canadians in Minors … All-Canadians … Influential Canadians 2015 Canadian draft list …. Canadians in College 2016 Canadian draft list Letters of Intent\n\nBy Bob Elliott\n\nIt was the worst of times ...\n\nAnd it was the ...\n\nAh ... it the worst of times.\n\nIt was 20 years ago when the Who Jays gathered at Grant Field.\n\nThey were replacement players, part of former commissioner Bud Selig’s legacy, along with inter-league play and huge TV deals.\n\nWhen the Players Association went on strike in August of 1994 using the leverage it had and fearing a lockout the next spring, Selig cancelled October play and the World Series.\n\nAnd so 27 teams gathered in Arizona and Florida to get ready for the 1995 season pretending it was business as usual ... like this spring, without the injuries.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles did not field a team as owner Peter Angelos declined to employ scabs.\n\nThe manager’s office in Lakeland was empty as future Hall of Fame manager Sparky Anderson stayed home on unpaid leave.\n\nAnd it was different in not so delightfully different Dunedin too: Joe Carter, John Olerud, Paul Molitor, Devon White, Juan Guzman and Duane Ward could not be found.\n\nManager Cito Gaston and his coaches were at the minor league complex working with the Blue Jays minor leaguers.\n\nMeanwhile, either at Countryside high -- after being booted out for insurance purposes -- and a park on Tampa Road in Oldsmar, regular major-league Blue Jays Pat Hentgen, Pat Borders, Randy Knorr, Mike Timlin, Darnell Coles and Paul Spoljaric worked out in front of the media, some of whom were brave enough to help out duirng batting practice.\n\nDoug Smith, then of Canadian Press made some impressive catches in the outfield.\n\nHad he been at Grant Field he might have been signed.\n\nIt was not going to be Your Toronto Blue Jays in 1995 ... since Ontario Labor laws refused to allow replacement players to earn and work in the province.\n\nIf the season opened with replacement players Dunedin’s Grant Field would be home for Jays’ Wannabees’ and they would have beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as the first to play a regular-season game in Florida by three years.\n\nAnd so the Dunedin Who Jays, each paid $5,000 US, gathered under manager Bob Didier.\n\n* * * “It was the worst spring ever, it wasn’t any fun,” _ Gord Ash, recalling his first year as general manager. Now in his 31st spring Ash was speaking from Arizona where he is an assistant GM with the Milwaukee Brewers. * * *\n\n* * * The tryout: The Jays had an open call Jan. 21 for anyone wanting to try out. A total of 225 wannabes showed 27 days before the start of spring training.\n\nRight-hander Clint West, 24, said it was his 131st camp. Alex Perez wore an official-looking Montreal Expos uniform, after driving from Miami where he was bartending and asked “think the uniform will hurt?” Also showing were pitcher Mike Taylor, an interior decorator, Daryl Stetson, a recreational player, who lived a block from the complex and John Harper, the fine New York Daily News columnist.\n\nThey came from far: Michigan, Kansas, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York and that hotbed of Cologne, Germany. One wore an Olive Garden jersey.\n\nCatcher Bradley Gay, infielder Brandon Markiewicz, a third-round pick of the Angels as a pitcher, outfielder Trevor Penn and right-hander Joshua Spring were signed out of the Dunedin camp.\n\nThe same weekend Tim Wilken ran a camp in California. But he recalls few details.\n\n“Another faded away buzz from my younger years,” said Wilken, now a Cubs scout.\n\n* * * “I wouldn’t have wished that on anyone, it was a bit of side show ... you’d hear ‘hey scab’ or ‘get this joke shop off the field,’ once in a while, but most fans were civil and supportive.” _ Etobicoke’s Warren Sawkiw, the only Canadian in camp since he had dual citizenship. * * *\n\nThe reluctant staff: Richie Hebner, Hector Torres, Reggie Cleveland and Steve Miller were coaches on Didier’s Replace Jays staff.\n\n“I didn’t want any part of it, it sucked,” said Hebner, now the hitting coach at triple-A Buffalo. “None of us wanted any part of it, but what am I going to do? I didn’t mope. I tried to be professional.\n\n“I did it for Paul Beeston, Pat Gillick and Cito Gaston. I don’t know what would have happened if I had put my foot down. Probably they would have told me to back to digging graves for a living.”\n\nBob Nelson, administrator of player personnel, addressed the 31 Replace Jays after they’d been given their physicals.\n\nThe Jays had won the 1992-93 World Series, there wasn’t one in 1994.\n\nYet, there was zero talk of a Three-Peat.\n\nIt was not a scene you imagine when you think of the Montreal Canadiens locker room: “From these failing hands to you we pass the torch ...”\n\n* * * “This is normally my favorite column of the winter. It’s the annual tour of spring training camps in Florida and Arizona. During the past 18 years, I’ve been in and out of every ball park in the Sunshine State. I’m in Florida, but spring training doesn’t have that special lure. As I write this, no one knows if the big-leaguers are coming.” _ Prior Smith. * * *\n\nThey came: From the independent Northern and Texas-Louisiana leagues, proud alumni of the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks, Winnipeg Goldeyes, Rio Grande Valley White Wings and the Tyler Wildcaters.\n\nOutfielder Dave Bingham was from a league of his own wearing a T-shirt which read: “Co-Ed Naked Baseball League, If you’re in scoring position ...”\n\nTrevor Penn wore Olerud’s No. 9.\n\nIn all, 11 didn’t play the year before.\n\nTim Rodgers was an electronics technician, while Wes Clements sold insurance.\n\n“Half my friends agree that this is a chance to get something out of the game,” said Clements that spring. “The other half don’t agree with what I’m doing.”\n\n* * * “Managers come into spring and the first thing they say is all positions are open. Guys look around and see Joe Carter or Roberto Alomar and think, `ya, sure.’ Well, this year every position really is open.” _ Didier. * * *\n\nFirst BP: During an hour-plus of batting practice, 322 pitches in all, there was not a lot of noise from bat meeting ball ... 41% of the pitches didn’t leave the cage.\n\nTrevor Penn hit a high fly off the top of the fence in centre. It bounced over for the only homer of that portion of BP. One ball hit the wall in the air and three others reached on a bounce.\n\nOne player took nine cuts and got the ball out of the cage once. Miss, foul ball, miss, foul, miss, foul. Get the idea?\n\nThe Replace Jays connected on only 66 of the 152 pitches from pitchers, only 19 (a .125 batting average, for those of you scoring alone at home) for hits.\n\nThe Replace Jays managed 14 dongs off the coaching staff, four by Penn and three by Victor Rojas.\n\n“That camp was a circus,” said Hebner, “still, we took it serious, I mean it wasn’t like an American Legion game.”\n\n* * * “Let’s try to get our cleats all the same color.” _ Didier. * * *\n\nThe serious skipper: In Didier’s opening day lineup he hit his pitcher in the No. 7 hole. Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa used to bat his pitcher eighth as studies showed it led to more base runners. Didier went La Russa one better.\n\n“It might have been replacement ball, but Bob was going to make his mark, win every game,” said Ash. “He was a terrific in-game manager.”\n\nYou know how managers bring in the lefty to face a left-handed hitter?\n\nDidier did it ... in the fifth.\n\n“Didier was different, but I loved Hebner,” said Sawkiw.\n\n* * * “I don’t want to hand a team over to Cito that’s five, 10, 25 games out of first.” _ Didier, after the commissioner’s office said games with replacement players would count in the final standings. * * *\n\nYou CAN’T look it up: In the spring of 1995 Sean Forman was a math prof at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. Writers lugged around four media guides on a three-city road trip and never were without the guide of the team they covered.\n\nThis was five years before Forman launched Baseball-Reference.com, a boon to everyone.\n\nThere weren’t any media guide for this bunch.\n\nWes Clements told us he had 30 homers the year before.\n\nReally?\n\nMaybe it was 25.\n\nIn those days there was no way of knowing. He said he’d played at triple-A Tuscon, a Houston Astros affiliate.\n\nSure enough he hit 20 we found out after phoning Houston ... in 1983.\n\nHe had not played since 1990 with the Yucatan Leones in Mexico.\n\n“I think I have 150 career homers, 500 RBIs in the minors. I’m may be light on the homers,” said Clements. He had 132 homers and 525 RBIs (according to Baseball-Reference) ... but three seasons of numbers from Mexico with Union Laguna Algodoneros and Yucatan were missing.\n\nMaybe he was right.\n\n* * * “What a play by No. 32. Write that number down, folks. There’s a number you might see in the future.” _ How St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Buck envisioned a typical replacement-game call. * * *\n\nIntra-squad: Lefty Dennis (Speedboat) Jones was on the mound, protecting a 2-1 lead. Bases loaded, two out in the sixth and final inning. Jones looked in, wheeled and threw to third. Oops.\n\nSpeedboat had flooded the engine.\n\nBalk! Tie game.\n\nA lefty throwing to third, especially with two out, is high risk. To do it improperly is worse.\n\nJones’ grandma nicknamed him Speedboat. His brother Mike Jones was nicknamed Motorboat. Jays coaches thought Jones was a slow boat on the mound.\n\nOne walk later - Jones’ fourth of the inning - Didier called the game.\n\nIt was discovered later that base ump Patrick Beauchamp was a softball ump.\n\nWhen NHL refs went on strike were they replaced by ringette officials?\n\n* * * “The problem with the law in Canada, is that the law is the law.” _ Chuck O’Connor, general counsel for the players relations committee. * * *\n\nIt’s home: Some 1,421 miles from SkyDome to Dunedin and Grant Field was going to be home. Even if Ken Carson had erected a roof.\n\nDick Wagner led a Dunedin delegation from the commissioner’s office to flush toilets, check the lights and the outfield walls. Also on the Royal Walkabout were Derek Irwin, AL director of finance, and Marty Springstead, head of the umpires.\n\nWas the park acceptable for a “major-league season?”\n\n“I don’t think they’re looking at it as a major-league season,” Springstead answered. “It’s not major-league players.”\n\nWhat about the cost of $40,000 to pad the outfield walls?\n\nSaid Springstead: “I can’t see Don Fehr worrying about padding.’’\n\n* * * “I don’t want make any headlines, but (union leader) Don Fehr reminds me of cult leader Jim Jones.” _ White Sox co-owner Jerry Reinsdorf. * * *\n\nMisplaced idol: Catcher Julio Osuna, 24, from Puerto Rico, listed his favorite player as former second baseman Tony Bernazard. The feeling wasn’t mutual. Bernazard, the ex-White Sox infielder, was the player liaison for the union.\n\n* * * “When that settlement comes, we want everybody who comes into the clubhouse on Day 1 to start from square one. We don’t want to spend a month trying to sort out who did what to who,.” _ Ash. * * *\n\nHome opener: In 1977, Doug Ault was the hero.\n\nOn this day, DH Bobby Llanos went 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles and two RBIs as the Jays Wannabees beat the Pirate Pretenders 7-5. Llanos spent almost nine months at his home in Puerto Rico after being released by the Seattle Mariners last spring.\n\nOnly 15 of 25 staff members ushers, ticket sellers, etc. worked the game.\n\nThe bleachers were closed.\n\n* * * “It happened last weekend for the first time. In fact, I saw it happen twice in an hour. I saw people trying to give away Jays spring training game tickets in Dunedin, and they couldn’t find any takers. The coldest ticket in town had a Blue Jays logo on it.” _ Prior Smith. * * *\n\nRoar of the crowd: The Pretend Jays drew so few fans ...\n\nHow few did they draw?\n\n“It was so bad fans were throwing foul balls back onto the field in the third inning,” said Hebner, jokingly we think. “There are only so many you can take home. A good idea would have been to come to the game in a trench coat with lots of pockets.\n\n“That spring? I think most smart ball fans went to the beach.”\n\nGrant Field had sold out its 6,218 seats for every spring game but one since 1991.\n\nKen Rosenthal, then of the Baltimore Sun, wrote: “Of course, it would be just like the dastardly Blue Jays to claim they’re now a small-market team, and demand relief from the new revenue-sharing plan.”\n\nThey sold 1,697 tickets for the Who Jays debut (2,004 counting complimentary tickets).\n\nTwo home dates later they drew 969 fans.\n\n* * * “I don’t know any one of those guys out there, I’m here because I love baseball and I support management 100%. Players are getting way too much money. This is a nice opportunity for the young kids.” _ Doug Anderson, vacationing Scarboro native, * * *\n\nIs this a way to start?: Ash took a labor relations course in 1989 at Queen’s University, but handling replacement players was not on the course calendar.\n\n“The kicker was playing in Dunedin,” Ash said, “that wouldn’t have been a good situation. It was an awkward. Our scouts couldn’t scout and our coaches couldn’t coach.\n\n“The only good thing was that we were one of the few teams that kept our major-league staff away from the replacement players.”\n\nThe Jays didn’t force minor leaguers to play and there appeared to be little pressure applied to the major leaguers under contract.\n\n“If they don’t want to play, fine,” Ash said that spring. “We’re prepared to live with that. We’re leaving it up to the individual.”\n\nThe class-A St. Petersburg Cardinals an independent team in the class-A Florida State League wanted payment for the Jays infringing on their territorial rights.\n\nAsh recalled an overnight trip the Who Jays took to Fort Myers, one day they played the Minnesota Twins, the next day the Boston Red Sox with Pork Chop Pough, Pookie Bernstein, Richard (Big Ragu) Licursi and Erik Lovdahl. Or was it Red Sox and then the Twins. It was 20 year ago.\n\n“We were like The Castaways,” he said.\n\n* * * “Under normal circumstances guys would be a little nervous. These guys have been reading the papers and watching TV like everyone else. They know what people are saying about them,” _ Didier. * * *\n\nLone Canuck: The only Canadian on the roster was Sawkiw, eligible since was married to an American, lived in Lakeland, Fla. and at the time held dual citizenship.\n\nSawkiw was born in Tottenham, grew up in Etobicoke cheering for the Jays playing up to peewee for his father, Eugene Sawkiw, who had him switch hitting at age three or four. Then he played for the Etobicoke Rangers and coach Bobby Smyth, attended Wake Forest, was drafted by the Detroit Tigers, spent three years in the Tiger system and two in the Northern League with Winnipeg and Thunder Bay.\n\n“It was the hardest decision of my life, I didn’t want to go against the baseball fraternity, but they were offering money,” said Sawkiw, who dressed in Olerud’s locker. “It was a chance to play in front of another organization. I wouldn’t have played as long I did if I hadn’t gone to Dunedin that spring.”\n\nAny lasting friendships from that spring 20 years ago?\n\n“I have more friendships from my days in the minors with the Tigers and the Jays,” said Sawkiw.\n\n* * * “I’m not pleased about having to play games in Dunedin, I won’t be pleased until the regular players are back playing at the SkyDome.” _ Jays president Paul Beeston. * * *\n\nEnd of strike: The Who Jays beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-3 on March 28.\n\nThe same day players voted to return to work if a U.S. District Court judge supported the National Labor Relations Board’s unfair labor practices complaint against the owners.\n\nThree days later the strike ended when judge Sonia Sotomayor, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, issued a preliminary injunction against the owners.\n\nAnd on April 2, the day before the season was scheduled to start with the replacement players, the strike came to an end.\n\nTeams would have an abbreviated spring training and play a 144-game season.\n\nAsh recalls teams starting with a 28-man roster.\n\n“That was a good idea,” Ash said. “The union doesn’t want to lose jobs, but if you shorten spring training -- only starting pitchers need six weeks -- add three pitchers for April and cap the September call ups at 30, it might work.”\n\n* * * “The court told us to go back to work and owners might not let us? How do they sell that? I’m trying to give owners the benefit of the doubt. Given the sweeping affect of the ruling it has to be a major disappointment.” _ Paul Molitor, in New York. * * *\n\nThe Survivors: Six players went from being Who Jays to minor-league Blue Jays.\n\nRighthander Pat Tilmon, infielders Robert Montalvo, Edgar Diaz and Sawkiw were assigned to triple-A Syracuse. Righthander Joshua Spring headed for Dunedin, while infielder Bobby Llanos went to class-A Hagerstown Suns.\n\n“They’re were trying to take advantage of their situation,” said Travis Baptist of the Syracuse Chiefs said after the strike was settled. “If they come and take my job, I’m going to be real bitter.”\n\nThe rest were told to go home.\n\nAll six had short stays. None played more than one season in the Jays system. Llanos played 106 games, Sawkiw 55, Spring 37, Diaz 15, Montalvo 11 and Tilmon four.\n\nWhile Didier compared the calibre of replacement ball to double-A, Sawkiw said “it was maybe low class-A ... independent ball might have been better.”\n\n“There was no comparison between that (replacement) team and our team in Knoxville,” Sawkiw said. “We had Shannon Stewart, Mike Coolbaugh, Sandy Martinez, Rich Butler, Chris Carpenter and Jose Pett.”\n\n* * * “I felt a couple of cold shoulders from guys (at minor-league camp) who had been in the union. I was never in the union -- minor leaguers were never protected.” _ Sawkiw. * * *\n\nReal life, real drama: The Jays rights were held by TSN 20 years ago so the best TV broadcast band ever -- Dan Shulman and Buck Martinez -- were in Dunedin.\n\n“Howie Starkman remembered me being interviewed from that spring,” said Sawkiw which led to an interview with producer Rick Briggs-Jude and working eight Montreal Expos TSN games in 2001. Next came a Canada Games gig in London, Ont. with CBC’s Vic Rauter, which led to a Sportsnet job as a studio analyst with Jamie Campbell for the 2003-06 post seasons and he joined Jerry Howarth as an analyst on radio broadcasts taking over for Tom Cheek before Alan Ashby replaced Sawkiw in 2007.\n\nSawkiw said “None of that happens unless I go to Dunedin and Howie remembers me.”\n\n* * * “We’re like any union. When scabs cross your line to take advantage of your situation for personal gains, it’s your right to know who they are. We went on strike for things we believe and they tried to break our union. Softball players took advantage of us to satisfy their egos.” _ Cubs reliever Randy Myers. * * *\n\nNot enough: Five days after Judge Sotomayor’s gavel hit the wooden desk Starkman gathered the media at Grant Field the place of so many glum faces throughout the spring.\n\nThe media filed in ... Ash took the podim.\n\nThe Jays were placing someone on the disabled list. Big whoop.\n\nSomeone else had been sent to minor-league camp ... a double-A player. Another big whoop.\n\n“And oh by the way,” Ash said pausing for effect, “we have re-acquired David Cone.”\n\nCone, a Jays World Series hero from 1992, had been added to join Pat Hentgen, Al Leiter, Juan Guzman and Danny Darwin in the rotation. Chris Stynes, plus Tony Medrano and David Sinnes went to the Kansas City Royals.\n\n“We thought it was a good deal, but it didn’t work out,” said Ash.\n\nCone had made 17 starts and the Jays were 35-47 on July 28 when he was sent to the New York Yankees for Marty Janzen, Mike Gordon and Jason Jarvis.\n\nThe Jays finished 56-88, a .389 winning mark, their fifth worst in club history better than only one of their first five seasons.\n\nIt was the worst of times.\n\n* * * Opening Day Lineup Three months before, the catcher was peddling booze, the right fielder delivered bottled water and the first baseman sold insurance.
