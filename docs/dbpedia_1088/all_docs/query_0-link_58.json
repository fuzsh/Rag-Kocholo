        "text": "When Steven Bochco cast Teddy Sears in the role of Richard Patrick Woolsley IV in TNT's hit series Raising the Bar (2008), he had no way of knowing the parallels between the actor's life and the character's. Of course with his training, talent and experience, Sears didn't need to be at all like his character, but there is a nice connection between Woolsley, the scion of a wealthy legal dynasty who turns renegade to become a legal defender, and Sears, literally the descendant of Plymouth Rock pilgrims, who left the business world to become an actor.\n\nGrowing up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, Teddy Sears was a great student and an even better athlete. Great-grandson of a 1912 Olympic gold-medalist (shooting) and nephew of an aunt who brought home a bronze in the 100 meter butterfly from the 1956 Melbourne games, he followed that tradition of excellence with state and national recognition in high school football and swimming and played varsity football for the University of Maryland. He graduated from the University of Virginia with a degree in business management before discovering his true calling and following its voice to New York and the beginning of his acting career. There he studied with acclaimed coach William Esper, worked tirelessly in the crucible of daytime drama, and landed guest-star roles in series like Law & Order (1990).\n\nHe showed his comedy chops in bits on The David Letterman Show (1980) and Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993), and then moved to Los Angeles, where he worked steadily in film and as a guest star in both television drama and comedy prior to joining the cast of Steven Bochco's Raising the Bar (2008) which enjoyed a two year run on TNT. He can also be seen in the recently released feature A Single Man (2009), starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore. Sears now makes his home in a beach community south of Los Angeles, where he uses his few spare hours surfing and training for triathlons.\n\nA native of the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, D.W. Moffett never gave a thought to acting until after he graduated from Stanford University with a degree in International Relations. While he went to work at Chicago's Continental Bank, he also enrolled in an acting class to broaden his artistic horizon and, more importantly, to meet girls. He found a social life - and his life's work.\n\nMoving along his new career path, Moffett became a founding member of Chicago's Remains Theatre Ensemble, where he starred in, directed and/or produced over 40 productions. He first came to national attention starring in Larry Kramer's landmark AIDS drama \"The Normal Heart\" at New York's Public Theatre. Subsequently, he appeared on Broadway in \"The Boys of Winter\" and \"The Real Thing,\" as well as a Los Angeles production of Jon Robin Baitz's \"The End of the Day.\" In his most recent return to the stage, D. W. was invited to play opposite Kevin Spacey in the critically acclaimed production of \"The Philadelphia Story\" at the Old Vic in London in 2005.\n\nSince making the move to Hollywood, Moffett has divided his time between film and television. Favorite movie roles include appearances in \"Stealing Beauty\", directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, \"Thirteen\", directed by Catherine Hardwicke, \"Twisted\", directed by Phillip Kaufman, and Steven Soderbergh's \"Traffic\", for which he won a Screen Actor's Guild Award.\n\nMoffett's television credits include the ground-breaking TV movie, \"An Early Frost\" as well as series regular roles in \"The Oldest Rookie\", \"Hidden Palms\", 'Skin\", \"For Your Love\", \"Chicago Sons\" and \"Life is Wild\" . Recently, Moffett appeared as the memorable and reviled Joe McCoy on the iconic series \"Friday Night Lights\" as well as Fran Drescher's ne'er-do-well boyfriend on \"Happily Divorced\". D.W. recently concluded production on the Peabody Award-winning ABC Family show, \"Switched at Birth\", in which he appeared as series-regular John Kennish for all 5 Seasons.\n\nD.W. also recently returned to the director's chair, helming an episode of the above-referenced Fran Drescher show as well as 3 episodes of Switched at Birth. Additionally, D.W. has begun directing children's programming, having directed the penultimate episode of the popular Disney Channel show \"Austin and Ally\".\n\nIn the Fall of 2016, D.W. joined the faculty of The Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in both Performing Arts as well as Film and Television. In December of 2016, D.W. was named Chair of the Film and Television Department at SCAD. D.W. is extremely excited at the challenge of leading the department and tapping his 35 years of experience to benefit his students.\n\nElizabeth Ann Perkins was born on November 18, 1960, in the borough of Queens, New York, and was raised in Vermont. Her mother, Jo Williams, was a concert pianist and drug treatment counselor, and her father, James Perkins, was a businessman, farmer, and writer. She is of Greek and English descent. Perkins studied acting at Chicago's Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University for three years, then launched her professional career with a co-starring gig in the touring company of Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs (1986). Seasoned, she returned to New York in the spring of 1984 to make her Broadway debut as a replacement in the Simon play. As a stage actress, she has trod the boards with Playwrights Horizon, the Ensemble Studio, The New York Shakespeare Festival, and, back in Chicago, with the Steppenwolf Theater. Elizabeth Perkins was listed as one of the 12 \"Promising New Actors of 1986\" in John Willis' Screen World, and has since landed numerous film roles. Perkins made her film debut in 1986 in Edward Zwick's About Last Night... with Rob Lowe, Demi Moore and Jim Belushi, and had a career breakthrough co-starring with Tom Hanks in Big. She received critical acclaim for her performance in Barry Levinson's Avalon,[9] and was a standout opposite William Hurt in The Doctor (1991), receiving critical acclaim for her performance as a terminal cancer patient.[5] .[10] She subsequently starred in the Alan Rudolph film Love at Large and Sweethearts Dance with Susan Sarandon and Jeff Daniels. Since, she has appeared in Miracle on 34th Street with Sir Richard Attenborough, 28 Days opposite Sandra Bullock, the suspense thriller, The Ring Two, opposite Naomi Watts, Indian Summer with Diane Lane and Bill Paxton, Moonlight and Valentino with Gwyneth Paltrow, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathleen Turner and Jon Bon Jovi, the Antonio Banderas directed Crazy in Alabama opposite Melanie Griffith, Jiminy Glick in LaLaWood with Martin Short, Wilma Flintstone opposite John Goodman in the 1994 live-action comedy The Flintstones, The Thing About My Folks with Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, He Said, She Said with Kevin Bacon and Sharon Stone and Must Love Dogs with John Cusack, Diane Lane, Christopher Plummer, Dermot Mulroney and Stockard Channing. From 2005 to 2009, Perkins played Celia Hodes, an alcoholic and image-obsessed parent-teacher association (PTA) mother, alongside Mary-Louise Parker, Kevin Nealon and Justin Kirk on the Showtime series Weeds. Perkins received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series, Miniseries or Made for TV Motion Picture (in 2006 and 2007).[5] and was also nominated three times for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Weeds.[5] At a screening of Weeds at the Museum of TV and Radio on October 25, 2006, Perkins said that she considers Celia Hodes her favorite role in her career.[5] On May 6, 2010, she announced that the fifth season of Weeds was her last despite the cliffhanger her character had in the season finale.[11] Perkins appeared in the television projects My Sisters Keeper with Kathy Bates, If These Walls Could Talk with Vanessa Redgrave and Paul Giamatti and Rescuers: Stories of Courage: Two Women directed by Peter Bogdonavich. Perkins starred in the ABC comedy series How to Live with Your Parents (For the Rest of Your Life).[12] with Brad Garrett, played Birdie in the Netflix original series GLOW with Alison Brie, starred as Marilyn Lovell in HBO's epic From The Earth to the Moon, played opposite Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson in HBO's Sharp Objects directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, starred with Octavia Spencer, Aaron Paul and Lizzie Caplan in AppleTV's Truth Be Told, was featured on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm and is currently starring in Season 2 of the Fox comedy The Moodys opposite Denis Leary and Jay Baruchel. She plays the role of Mandy Moores mother on the hit series This Is Us. (Perkins also had a role in the 2003 film Finding Nemo, voicing Coral, the wife of Marlin and mother of Nemo, and who was killed and eaten by the barracuda in the beginning of the film.)\n\nThis Queens-born actor has certainly proven himself adept at everything from quirky comedy to flat-out melodrama earning TV stardom in the early 1990s and maintaining a strong foothold on stage, film and TV in its aftermath.\n\nSteven Robert Weber was born on March 4, 1961, to Fran (Frankel), a nightclub singer, and Stuart Weber, a nightclub performer, and Borscht Belt comic and manager. He was already appearing in television commercials by elementary school age. He later studied at the High School of the Performing Arts in New York and graduated from New York State University. The fair-haired, fair-skinned actor worked a series of menial jobs during his salad days as a struggling thespian (custodian, elevator operator, singing waiter) until earning his break on TV in a presentation of one of Mark Twain's stories. Quickly making his film debut in the popular comedy Flamingo Kid (1984), he nabbed a running role on the soap opera Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) a year later. On the set he met first wife Finn Carter, another co-star on the daytime drama. Steven stayed put for a year then went on to gain recognition in more offbeat and/or prestigious productions on film and prime-time TV. He played a rock star in the thoroughly offbeat foreign-made film Los ángeles (1990) and showed real command as John F. Kennedy in the epic miniseries The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990).\n\nThat same year TV stardom came his way with the sitcom Überflieger (1990). Co-starring with Tim Daly as Brian Hackett, the looser, goofier more aimless half of the brotherly team who co-owned a one-plane, Nantucket-based airline, the actors' chemistry, not to mention a terrifically eclectic supporting cast, kept the show on a steady course for seven seasons. Easily typed now as a genial, lovable loser type, Weber faced the prospect of severe pigeon-holing. So during the show's off season, he started showing up in more serious roles. He suffered at the hands of the deranged Jennifer Jason Leigh in Weiblich, ledig, jung sucht... (1992); appeared in a second chiller with Die Aushilfe (1993); and made a cameo in the highly depressing, award-winning Leaving Las Vegas: Liebe bis in den Tod (1995). His flair for comedy shone in is straight-man role as Johathan Harker in the critically acclaimed horror spoof, Dracula - Tot aber glücklich (1995) He truly impressed both critics and audiences alike as the complex title character in Jeffrey (1995), a gay romantic film comedy, and then completely defied all odds by starring in an epic TV-movie version of Stephen King's horror classic The Shining (1997), seizing the role inherited from Jack Nicholson and brilliantly making it his own while earning a Saturn award for his chilling efforts.\n\nBy the time \"Wings\" came to an end in 1997, Weber had divorced his actress/wife Finn Carter (they had no children) and married actress/TV executive Juliette Hohnen on July 9, 1995. They have two children, Jack and Alfie. He and Laura Linney were selected to play the TV-movie leads in the popular A.R. Gurney theater piece Hoffnungslos verliebt (1999). While other TV series comebacks have fared less well, including the short runs of The Weber Show (2000) (which he produced), The D.A. (2004), Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006), Happy Town (2010) and Chasing Life (2014).\n\nSteven bounced around solidly in other venues. In 2002, he joined the cast of the smash Broadway musical \"The Producers,\" taking over the nebbish Matthew Broderick role. In 2004, he went to London to appear on stage with Kevin Spacey and Mary Stuart Masterson in \"National Anthems.\" Other plays over the years have included \"Throwing Your Voice,\" \"Something in the Air\" and \"Design for Living.\"\n\nSteven has remained quite productive into the millennium with recent film outings in Sexual Life (2004), Dirty Movie (2005), Inside Out (2005), the title role in Choose Connor (2007), Cabin Massacre (2008), My One and Only - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Right (2009), Kein Mittel gegen Liebe (2011), Son of Morning (2011), the comedy Being Bin Laden (2011) in which he played Osama Bin Laden, Crawlspace (2012), Kiss Me (2014), Amateur Night (2016), A Thousand Junkies (2017), The Perfection (2018) and Allan the Dog (2020). Seen even more prolifically on TV, he has graced such popular shows as \"The D.A.,\" \"Will & Grace\" (as Will's brother Sam), \"Monk,\" \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"Hot in Cleveland,\" \"Parenthood,\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"This Close.\"\n\nThe actor continues to play a stream of comedic and dramatic recurring roles on such TV programs as Without a Trace - Spurlos verschwunden (2002), Brothers & Sisters (2006), Dallas (2012) (the New Generation), Murder in the First (2014), Helix (2014), iZombie (2015), House of Lies (2012), Navy CIS: New Orleans (2014), Ballers (2015) and Schnappt Shorty (2017) and more recently appeared as a regular on the mystery series Tote Mädchen lügen nicht (2017) and comedy series Indebted (2020). In addition, he has given voice to a few animated programs including Der ultimative Spider-Man (2012), Avengers - Gemeinsam unbesiegbar (2012) The Bravest Knight (2019) and Welpen Freunde (2017).\n\nBenito Martinez (actor/producer)\n\nBenito has been busy in front of and behind the camera.\n\nHe is currently working as Executive Producer on the Amazon Prime feature A MILLION MILES AWAY starring Michael Peña as \"José Hernandez.\" The film is based on the inspirational true story of an immigrant farm worker who became an astronaut for NASA.

Originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Benito got his start on stage playing the vihuela in his father's mariachi at the age of eight. The next year, he also started participating in theatrical productions at La Compania de Teatro de Albuquerque, a bilingual theater company, co-founded by his mother, Margarita Martinez. After many years of doing both, acting won out.\n\nAward-winning actor Esai Morales is a graduate of New York's High School for the Performing Arts. He was born in Brooklyn, to Puerto Rican parents, and began his acting career on the stage, first appearing in El Hermano at the Ensemble Theatre Studio and at New York's Shakespeare Festival In The Park in The Tempest. He had his feature film debut in Bad Boys and his breakthrough role as Bob Morales in La Bamba made him a star, contributing to making the film the most commercially successful Latino-themed Rock biopic of all time.\n\nIn 1997 Esai Morales co-founded the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, created to advance the presence of Latinos in the media, telecommunications and entertainment industries. The NHFA has provided scholarships to hundreds of Hispanic students in excess of 1 million dollars.

His character Alex on The Expanse\" became an instant fan favorite and one of the most quoted characters of the show. In spring 2020, he wrapped shooting his fifth and final season of the hit Amazon Prime series and, hours later, Cas was cast opposite Viola Davis on \"How to Get Away With Murder\" in the lauded series' final season. Cas played the boyfriend to Viola's character; he delivered and got invited back for five episodes, immediately catapulting him as a viable contender as best Guest Actor in a Drama Series at the 2020 Emmy Awards.\n\nHe just wrapped a guest appearance on Dick Wolf's \"FBI: International\" airing on Prime Video. In 2020, Anvar appeared in two high profile feature films which garnered substantial audiences on Amazon Prime. He co-starred in celebrated filmmaker Veena Sud's most recent motion picture, \"The Lie\" (Blumhouse) opposite Peter Sarsgaard, Mireille Enos and Joey King which premiered at TIFF 2019 last year and in \"Draupadi Unleashed\" (Passion River Films), a 16th century Indian period piece which previewed at Cannes.

He splits his time between Toronto and Los Angeles.\n\nMarcia Gay Harden was born on August 14, 1959, in La Jolla, California, the third of five children. Her mother, Beverly (Bushfield), was a homemaker, and her father, Thad Harold Harden, was in the military. The family relocated often -- she first became interested in the theatre when the family was living in Greece, and she had attended plays in Athens. Harden began her college education at American universities in Europe and returned to the US to complete her studies at the University of Texas in 1983; went on to earn an MFA at NYU, and, thereafter, embarked on her acting career.\n\nAlthough she had acted in a movie as early as 1986, in the little-known The Image-Maker (1986), her first mainstream role, coming alongside some TV movie work, was as a sultry femme fatale in the Coen Brothers' cleverly offbeat homage to the gangster movie, Miller's Crossing (1990). Harden received good reviews for her sultry performance as Verna, a seductive, trouble-making moll. Harden thereafter worked steadily in supporting roles, including the portrayal of Ava Gardner in Frank Sinatra - Der Weg an die Spitze (1992), a television biopic about Frank Sinatra. Harden also worked in the theater and, in 1993, was part of the Broadway cast of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America\", playing Harper, the alienated wife of a closeted gay man. It was a demanding dramatic role, and Harden won acclaim for her work, including a Tony award nomination. She returned to movie making in the mid-1990s, continuing to turn in superb supporting performances in films and television.\n\nHarden's road to success was a long one, her work generally being overlooked because the productions were either critically panned or ignored by audiences. However, it was just a matter of time before Harden got a chance to truly show her quality on-screen, and that time came in 2000, with Ed Harris's Pollock (2000), in which she played Lee Krasner, artist and long-suffering wife of Jackson Pollock. Harden's performance was deeply moving and unforgettable and earned her the Oscar and New York Film Critic's Circle awards for best supporting actress. Continuing to work prolifically in features and television, she earned another Oscar nomination in 2003 for her supporting role in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), Harden having earlier worked with Eastwood in 2000's Space Cowboys (2000).\n\nHarden's work often makes otherwise mediocre productions worth watching, fully inhabiting any character she portrays. She was married to Thaddaeus Scheel, with whom she worked on Die Geschichte vom Spitfire Grill (1996), from 1996 to 2012. The couple have three children, a daughter Eulala Scheel, and twins Julitta and Hudson."
