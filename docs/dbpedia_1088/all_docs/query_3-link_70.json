        "text": "He couldn't possibly throw that hard, or be that nasty, with that diminutive frame. That was the common perception of a young Pedro Martinez upon first sight.\n\nOh, but Martinez was filthy all right, one of the preeminent pitchers of his time, and he carried himself with a swagger that belied his size.\n\nMartinez, 5-11 and about 150 pounds in his early years, established his credentials as an elite pitcher with the Montreal Expos, claiming his first Cy Young Award in 1997. But it was with the Boston Red Sox that he became a legend, twice winning the top pitching prize in the American League as part of a stretch of seven seasons when he held an unparalleled mastery over hitters.\n\nFrom 1997-2003, in the heart of the steroid era, Martinez finished in the top three in the Cy Young voting six out of seven times, going 118-36 with a 2.20 ERA, averaging 5.6 strikeouts per walk and posting an 0.94 WHIP. By comparison, in his six-year spell of brilliance from 1961-66, Sandy Koufax went 129-47 with a 2.19 ERA, 4.16 strikeouts per walk and a 0.97 WHIP.\n\nMartinez shined despite pitching his home games most of those years at cozy Fenway Park and repeatedly facing top competition in the American League East. When Martinez was on, it didn't matter where he was or who opposed him.\n\nThe case for: Martinez's winning percentage of .687 – he had a 219-100 record – would rank second among Hall of Famers who pitched in the modern era, behind only Whitey Ford's .690 mark.\n\nHis arrival in Boston, where each of his starts became must-see theater, helped propel the Red Sox back to prominence, as they made the playoffs in four of his seven seasons there, capped by the 2004 World Series championship that ended an 86-year drought. Martinez's bravado also added fire to the Red Sox-New York Yankees rivalry.\n\nMartinez's career ERA of 2.93 is certainly Hall-worthy, but it's his stunning stretch of supremacy – when his ERA climbed above 2.30 in only two of seven years – that really makes his case. He led his league in ERA and fewest hits allowed five times and in strikeouts thrice in that spell.\n\nMartinez's 1999 season, when he won the pitching Triple Crown while going 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts against 37 walks in 213 1/3 innings, has been cited as one of the greatest since the inception of the DH. Then again, the next season he lowered his ERA to 1.74 and had an unheard-of WAR of 11.7, along with a WHIP of 0.737. He finished second and fifth, respectively, in the AL MVP race those seasons.\n\nThe case against: Martinez's victory total is pedestrian by Hall of Fame standards, as arm woes hampered him late in his career. Then again, Koufax won 165 games and his Hall worthiness was never in doubt. Perhaps not surprisingly given his size, Martinez reached the 200-inning mark only seven times, the last one at age 33. In the final four of his 17 full seasons, Martinez totaled just 314 1/3 innings.\n\nLookalikes: Martinez was Tim Lincecum before the Freak burst on the scene, but his pitching savvy and command of three pitches allowed him to succeed even as his velocity diminished. Among his contemporaries, Martinez stacks up well when compared to the likes of Roy Halladay and former teammate Curt Schilling, solid Hall of Fame candidates themselves.\n\nX Factors: At the height of his Pedro-ness, Martinez started the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway and electrified the crowd by becoming the first pitcher to strike out the first four batters he faced – Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, the latter two coming off their famed home run-record chase. Martinez closed out his second scoreless inning by fanning Jeff Bagwell in a performance that evoked memories of Carl Hubbell in the 1934 All-Star Game, when he struck out five future Hall of Famers in a row.\n\nConsensus: There's little doubt Martinez will become the second Dominican native in the Hall of Fame, joining Juan Marichal. Chances are Martinez will come in second to Randy Johnson in the voting, but likely with plenty of votes for election in his first year of eligibility. They were at opposite ends in size, but should walk into the pantheon of greats side-by-side."
