        "text": "Last season with Texas Julio Pablo Martínez from Guantanamo, Cuba became the 387th Cuban to debut in the Major Leagues. According to Baseball Reference. Ronnie Mustelier and Luis Miguel Romero have also been called up to MLB, but they did not make their debuts and were sent back down to the minors.\n\nIn addition to that he was the 27th Cuban to play in the big show last year and the fourth to make his debut, Víctor Mederos, Daysbel Hernández and Óscar Colas were the others. This morning the Texas Rangers sent JP Martínez to the Atlanta Braves for right-handed pitcher Tyler Owens, who is not on the 40-man roster, creating a spot on their 40-man roster for their recent acquisition, David Robertson.\n\nLast season he played in 17 games with Texas and in 44 plate appearances he slashed of .225/.250/.325, with nine hits, a double, a home run and four RBIs. Martínez last season was named to the MiLB.com All-Star team after hitting .297 (303 AB; 90 H) with 41 extra-base hits (23 2B, 4 3B and 14 HR) and an OPS of .963 at three different levels (A+, AA and AAA).\n\nOriginally signed by Texas as an international free agent in 2018, the Baracoa native has a batting average of .257 (1686 AB; 434 H) in the minor leagues, with 82 doubles, 27 triples, 58 home runs, 220 RBIs and 145 stolen bases. Martínez figures to be the fourth outfielder for the Braves this upcoming season. The Cuban will be in the mix this spring in an outfield that includes Ronald Acuña, Marcell Ozuna and Michael Harris."
