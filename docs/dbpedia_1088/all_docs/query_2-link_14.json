        "text": "The Cleveland Guardians will be without Gabriel Arias, who has been placed on the family medical emergency list. In a corresponding move, the club will recall infielder Angel Martínez from Triple-A Columbus, who will make his major league debut as soon as he gets into a game. Martinez is Cleveland’s No. 9 overall prospect by MLB.com. This season at Triple-A Columbus, Martínez is batting .333 with three home runs and 11 RBI in 17 games. Martínez originally signed with Cleveland for $500,000 in 2018.\n\nHe is the son of former Major League catcher Sandy Martínez , who spent time with the Guardians and Pittsburgh Pirates organizations.\n\nGuardians’ Angel Martínez Set for First MLB Stint\n\nMartínez’s high baseball IQ led to a series of aggressive assignments, allowing him to reach Triple-A last year at age 21. The Guardians added him to the 40-man roster following the 2022 season to prevent another team from taking him in the Rule 5 draft. He had a down year in 2023, hitting .251/.321/.394 between Double-A and Triple-A. This season, he got off to a rocky start, beginning the year on the injured list with a foot injury and then a left hamate fracture. He was reinstated from the injured list at the end of May.\n\nMartínez’s Prospect Profile\n\nScouting grades: Hit: 50| Power: 45| Run: 55| Arm: 55| Field: 55| Overall: 45\n\nMartínez has posted mediocre numbers in the upper levels of the minors, partly because he got there so quickly but also because he has gotten more aggressive and pull-happy. A switch-hitter, Martínez is at his best when he works counts and uses the entire field. He has a handy swing from both sides of the plate and should focus on making contact and getting on base.\n\nWhen he entered pro ball, there were some questions about Martínez’s speed and arm strength. However, he continues to improve and is now solid in both regards. He’s a great defender with quick, reliable hands that allow him to play second, third, or shortstop. He also had a brief showing in center field this season.\n\nMartínez will likely stick to one position despite being versatile. The Guardians have José Ramírez, Andrés Giménez, and Brayan Rocchio getting playing time at those infield spots. Daniel Schneemann has bounced around to multiple spots, and Tyler Freeman is getting semi-work in center."
