        "text": "Tim Kelly\n\nEvery MLB Team's Best-Case Scenario for Rest of 2024 Regular Season\n\n0 of 30\n\nNew York Yankees/Getty Images\n\nMajor League Baseball's trade deadline is gone, and two-thirds of the teams in the sport probably still have realistic playoff aspirations.\n\nEven the clubs that aren't competing for playoff spots can use the final two months of the season to evaluate the futures of their top executives, manager, coaching staff and players.\n\nWith all that in mind, here's the best-case scenario for all 30 teams during the remainder of the 2024 regular season.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks: Get Pitching on Track Before Postseason\n\n1 of 30\n\nAdam Hunger/Getty Images\n\nThe Diamondbacks were 41-43 after the first three months of the season, making them one of the most disappointing teams in baseball. But since the calendar flipped to July, the reigning NL Champions have been one of the hottest teams, going 20-9 and looking like a club that could be dangerous in October.\n\nFor manager Torey Lovullo's squad to be at their peak in the postseason—whether they arrive as a wild-card team or storm back to win the NL West—they need some combination of four pitchers to get right.\n\nLHP Jordan Montgomery: He was a playoff hero for the Texas Rangers last year, but he has a 6.37 ERA over 16 starts this year. This one is pretty cut and dry.\n\nLHP Eduardo Rodríguez: The 31-year-old lefty will make his season debut this week after inking a four-year, $80 million deal to join the Snakes in the offseason. A shoulder strain has held him out to this point, but he had a 3.30 ERA over 26 starts a season ago for the Detroit Tigers and was part of the 2018 World Series-winning Boston Red Sox, so he could be a boost for the Diamondbacks.\n\nRHP Merrill Kelly: The veteran right-hander has been out since April with a teres major strain in his right shoulder. He's going to make a rehab appearance for High-A Hillsboro on Tuesday, so he may not be far off from returning as well.\n\nReliever Paul Sewald: The Diamondbacks removed Sewald from the closer role in early August after he blew four saves and posted a 10.80 ERA in July. He's responded with two scoreless outings to open August, so perhaps he can get back to pitching the ninth inning before the postseason rolls around.\n\nAtlanta Braves: Have Big Bats Catch Fire\n\n2 of 30\n\nTodd Kirkland/Getty Images\n\nFor a team that has lost Ronald Acuña Jr. and Spencer Strider for the remainder of the season and is without Ozzie Albies (left wrist fracture) and Michael Harris II (left hamstring) for an extended period, just staying healthy for the remainder of the campaign is a good goal.\n\nHowever, for the Atlanta Braves to be able to do damage in the postseason, their remaining big bats need to get going.\n\nMatt Olson led baseball with 54 home runs and 139 RBI last season while posting a .993 OPS. He has 18 home runs, 53 RBI and a .719 OPS in 2024.\n\nAustin Riley homered 37 times, drove in 97 runs and posted an .861 OPS in 2023. In 2024, he has 15 home runs, 47 RBI and a .783 OPS.\n\nAs the Braves try to hold onto the top wild-card spot in the NL—and even challenge the Philadelphia Phillies for the NL East title—catcher Sean Murphy, shortstop Orlando Arcia and the recently reacquired Jorge Soler are other pieces manager Brian Snitker would love to see go on a hot streak before the playoffs start.\n\nBaltimore Orioles: Figure Out Which Bullpen Arms Can Be Trusted\n\n3 of 30\n\nMegan Briggs/Getty Images\n\nThe good news for the Orioles is that general manager Mike Elias has acquired a slew of late-inning relievers over the last year to give manager Brandon Hyde more options in the bullpen.\n\nThe bad news for the Orioles is that Elias has partially reconstructed the Phillies bullpen that ran out of gas in the NLCS a year ago, signing Craig Kimbrel in the offseason and acquiring both Seranthony Domínguez and Gregory Soto before the trade deadline.\n\nKimbrel is one of the greatest closers of all time, but the 36-year-old has a 4.50 ERA career postseason ERA. Domínguez and Soto both have closer stuff, but the Phillies were willing to trade them because they haven't demonstrated enough control this season to be trusted in high-leverage situations.\n\nBaltimore does also have Jacob Webb, Yennier Cano and Cionel Pérez available in the bullpen, but it's unclear if it has the options to nail a game down.\n\nThe Orioles clearly miss Félix Bautista, last year's Mariano Rivera AL Reliever of the Year, who is out for the season with Tommy John surgery.\n\nBoston Red Sox: Sneak Into Postseason\n\n4 of 30\n\nDanielle Parhizkaran/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nJust about every outlet predicted before the season that the Red Sox—on the heels of what felt like an underwhelming offseason—would finish in last place in the crowded AL East for the third consecutive campaign.\n\nInstead, they have played well enough that chief baseball officer Craig Breslow made some minor additions at the trade deadline, acquiring catcher Danny Jansen, LHP James Paxton and reliever Luis García to bolster manager Alex Cora's squad.\n\nObviously, third baseman Rafael Devers remains the straw that stirs the drink in Boston, but the Red Sox have also seen impressive growth this year from RHP Tanner Houck, right fielder Wilyer Abreu and center fielder Jarren Duran, among others.\n\nB/R's Joel Reuter ranked Boston's farm system as the eighth-best in baseball in his most recent update. If the Red Sox make the playoffs ahead of schedule in 2024, they would have a pretty bright outlook knowing they have some potential impact pieces on the farm.\n\nChicago Cubs: Reach Conclusions on Perceived Core Players\n\n5 of 30\n\nCharles Brock/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThe Cubs are in a weird purgatory. They have enough talent that it didn't make sense to do a full teardown before the July 30 trade deadline (they actually completed one of the biggest deals to acquire third baseman Isaac Paredes from the Tampa Bay Rays), yet they are still near the bottom of what's one of the more winnable divisions in baseball.\n\nAs Chicago tries to plan for the future, President of Baseball Operations Jed Hoyer needs to use the remainder of the campaign to make honest assessments of if, and to what extent, the following players fit into the Cubs' future plans.\n\nSecond Baseman Nico Hoerner: The former first-round pick won a Gold Glove Award a season ago and has seven outs above average again this year. But after hitting .283 with a .729 OPS last season, the 27-year-old has taken a step back offensively, hitting .256 with a .672 OPS in 2024. He would be an interesting trade candidate if the Cubs want to use him to upgrade another part of their roster, like the bullpen, and then sign someone else to play second who could provide more at the plate.\n\nShortstop Dansby Swanson: Considering he's in the second season of a seven-year, $177 million deal and has a full no-trade clause, Swanson isn't going anywhere. But did the Cubs overestimate how much of a core piece he could be for them? He is a tremendous defender, with 13 outs above average, but the 30-year-old is hitting just .223 with a .644 OPS.\n\nOF/IF Cody Bellinger: To a degree, this is out of Chicago's control. Bellinger returned to the Cubs on a three-year, $80 million deal last offseason that includes player opt-outs after 2024 and 2025. If he opts in, he'll be a Cub again next year. But such wide variances in his offensive production—he has a .756 OPS this year, after posting an .881 OPS in 2023 and a .654 OPS in 2022—make it hard to plan for him. Perhaps if he gets hot and opts out after the season, the Cubs should let him walk.\n\nChicago White Sox: Keep Garrett Crochet and Luis Robert Healthy\n\n6 of 30\n\nQuinn Harris/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps a more immediate goal for the White Sox is to finish with more wins than the 2003 Detroit Tigers, who currently own the worst 162-game record in MLB history at 43-119.\n\nRight now, it looks like the 2024 White Sox are in danger of going down as the worst team in MLB history.\n\nBut general manager Chris Getz didn't trade LHP Garrett Crochet or center fielder Luis Robert Jr. before the trade deadline, which puts continued injury risk on the White Sox as they try to protect two players they will almost certainly deal at some point.\n\nThere's a fairly simple solution for Crochet, which involves shutting him down for the year probably before September. While he leads the AL in strikeouts (162) and FIP (2.63), he has already logged 118.1 innings this season.\n\nAs he worked his way back from Tommy John surgery, Crochet threw a grand total of 12.2 innings at the MLB level last year. Pushing him much further risks him getting hurt again, which would destroy his trade value and potentially his career. In a season that's been lost since April, there shouldn't be any debate about shutting him down in the near future.\n\nAs for Robert, he already missed close to two months with a right hip flexor strain. Even if he plays every game for the remainder of the season, he will finish the season with under 110 games played this year. He played 145 games a season ago, but has never played more than 98 in another season. His trade value is going to be hurt by his injury history, that's just the reality of the situation.\n\nWith that said, if Roberts is able to play well over the final two months, he'll remind teams why he's such an intriguing player at a position that has so few impact players, despite his injury history.\n\nIf the White Sox manage things the right way—which shouldn't be assumed—both Crochet and Robert could be traded in the offseason, helping to further set Chicago up for a future that can't possibly be worse than the present.\n\nColorado Rockies: Get Good Results From Cal Quantrill\n\n7 of 30\n\nDylan Buell/Getty Images\n\nAdmittedly, the bar is pretty low here.\n\nMaybe it's time to cycle out manager Bud Black, but it would be naive to think he's anywhere near the biggest problem for the Rockies, who are headed for their sixth consecutive losing season.\n\nOne small victory they could get over the final two months of the season could be if RHP Cal Quantrill gets back on track after posting a 7.54 ERA in July. He had a 3.78 ERA at the end of June, which is a good mark for someone who pitches their home games at Coors Field.\n\nIf the 29-year-old finishes the season on a high note, the Rockies could consider trade offers for him this winter given he has one more year remaining of arbitration eligibility.\n\nBased on their recent history, it's more likely that the Rockies don't capitalize on any of their pieces having trade value and Quantrill is the Opening Day starter in 2025.\n\nEither scenario is more likely if Quantrill doesn't turn back into a pumpkin over the final two months of the season.\n\nCincinnati Reds: Evaluate Manager David Bell's Future\n\n8 of 30\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThe offseason signing of RHP Frankie Montas—since traded to the Milwaukee Brewers—didn't work out, and the Reds have been without promising infielder Matt McLain for the whole season as he recovers from left shoulder surgery.\n\nThings haven't gone perfectly for the Reds in 2024.\n\nWith that said, they were a trendy pick to win the NL Central before the season. At the time of writing, they are in fourth place in a division that doesn't have a team that's going to approach 100 wins. Some bad luck and underperformances have contributed to that, but President of Baseball Operations Nick Krall would be within his rights to think this team has underperformed, even with its flaws.\n\nThe Reds are currently 54-58. The Pythagorean theorem suggests that because the Reds have a plus-41 run differential, they should have a 60-52 record. When there's that drastic a difference between the projected record and actual record, it usually doesn't reflect well on the manager.\n\nWith Elly De La Cruz and a slew of other young talent, the Reds would be an attractive opening if they decide that they should move on from manager David Bell.\n\nCleveland Guardians: Earn Postseason Bye\n\n9 of 30\n\nBrandon Sloter/Image Of Sport/Getty Images\n\nFirst-year manager Stephen Vogt's squad currently has the best record in baseball, with Emmanuel Clase leading the most dominant bullpen in the sport and perennial AL MVP candidate José Ramírez at the forefront of a lineup that's been far better than anticipated.\n\nAre there still legitimate questions to be asked about whether a starting rotation led by Tanner Bibee and Ben Lively has enough pitching to compete in October? You bet.\n\nThe best way to overcome that would be to shorten the postseason slate and assure you have as many games at Progressive Field as possible. The path to doing that involves finishing with the AL's best record, which would come with a first-round bye and home-field advantage in the postseason.\n\nLeft fielder Steven Kwan, first baseman Josh Naylor, DH David Fry, reliever Hunter Gaddis, reliever Tim Herrin, reliever Cade Smith and Lively are all having career years for the Guardians.\n\nThere's a special vibe in Cleveland this year. Is that enough to carry it to a World Series title? We'll see, but earning the No. 1 seed in the AL playoff picture would be a nice place to start.\n\nDetroit Tigers: Tarik Skubal Wins AL Cy Young Award\n\n10 of 30\n\nJason Miller/Getty Images\n\nAs recently as 2017, the Tigers had a top-five payroll in baseball. They opened this season with the 22nd payroll in baseball. It's great to aspire to draft and development cheap talent. But there's a reality here that Detroit CEO Christopher Ilitch needs to recommit to spending the way his late father, Mike, did.\n\nIn the meantime, the Tigers are headed for their eighth consecutive losing season. The only real thing to look forward to over the final two months of the season is LHP Tarik Skubal's quest for the AL Cy Young Award. He's tied for the AL lead with 162 strikeouts and in the top five among junior circuit starters in terms of innings pitched (136.1), ERA (2.57), FIP (2.64) and WAR (4.0).\n\nThe 27-year-old lefty has a real chance to become the first Detroit pitcher to win the honor since Max Scherzer in 2013. Perhaps if he does that, it will compel the Tigers to spend money on surrounding the ace with a competitive team.\n\nHouston Astros: Get Healthy, Win AL West Title\n\n11 of 30\n\nLeslie Plaza Johnson/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThe Astros have managed to stay in the race in the underwhelming AL West, despite a season where injuries have hit Houston hard.\n\nJosé Urquidy, Cristian Javier and Lance McCullers Jr. have all been lost for the season, which makes it imperative that Justin Verlander—on the injured list with neck discomfort since mid-June—returns and is effective.\n\nEven at age 41, Verlander has been effective when pitching this season, with a 3.99 ERA over 10 starts.\n\nWhile Aaron Judge and Bobby Witt Jr. might have made it impossible for Kyle Tucker to make a serious run at the AL MVP, Houston's right fielder was playing at that type of level before getting hurt.\n\nPrior to going down with a right shin contusion in early June, he had 19 home runs, 40 RBI and a .979 OPS. The three-time All-Star continues to struggle in his attempt to return from the injury.\n\nIt kind of feels like this year might the last opportunity for this Astros core, particularly since Alex Bregman and Verlander can become a free agents after the season. Getting healthy will be crucial if they are to make one more run.\n\nKansas City Royals: Snap 8-Year Postseason Drought\n\n12 of 30\n\nNic Antaya/Getty Images\n\nBobby Witt Jr. has a staggering 7.6 WAR with two months of the season left, which would normally make him the favorite to win the AL MVP.\n\nBut Aaron Judge leads the sport in almost all offensive categories and might hit 60-plus home runs this year, which could mean Witt has to settle for a runner-up spot.\n\nWitt's great season will hardly be lost, though, particularly if he helps the Royals reach the postseason for the first time since they won the 2015 World Series. Kansas City is currently in control of the final wild-card spot in the AL, which represents an incredible turnaround given that they won just 56 games last season.\n\nBut while Witt and Cole Ragans figure to be in Kansas City for the foreseeable future, the Royals' two other All-Stars—Salvador Pérez and Seth Lugo—are 34. This is as good of a team as any for them to return to the postseason.\n\nLos Angeles Angels: Figure Out Long-Term Plan For Mike Trout\n\n13 of 30\n\nRic Tapia/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nMike Trout is out for the season with a tear in his left meniscus, which means that the three-time AL MVP will finish with less than 120 games played for the fourth consecutive season, with fewer than 85 games played in three of those four campaigns.\n\nTrout will turn 33 on Wednesday, and his recent injury history makes it clear he can't continue to play center field. Frankly, it's fair to wonder if he should play anywhere in the outfield at all.\n\nCould he make a Bryce Harper-esque transition to first base? It seems unlikely given the presence of 22-year-old Nolan Schanuel at first base.\n\nAt this point, there's a strong argument to be made for Trout just being a full-time DH. Given he hasn't even moved off of center field yet, it's probably unlikely. But having him focus primarily on hitting for the remainder of his career might be the best way to assure he stays in the lineup for the Angels.\n\nAlso, let's be clear on Trout's future: It's almost certainly with the Angels. He's due $222 million between 2025 and 2030. He has a full no-trade clause and has shown no indication he wants to leave.\n\nAnd if you're the Angels, why would you want to move him at this point? You missed the opportunity to get a great return for him, even if you pay down some of his deal. Just keep him and have him spend his entire career with the Halos, which would include him hitting his milestone home runs in an Angels uniform.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers: Earn No. 1 Seed Behind Healthy Pitching\n\n14 of 30\n\nBrandon Sloter/Getty Images\n\nGranted, the Dodgers haven't fared well after earning first-round byes in the postseason in each of the past two seasons.\n\nStill, no team is going to try to not win the division and set itself up to play an additional postseason series, particularly one that has struggled to keep its pitching healthy.\n\nThere are some questions about the bottom of manager Dave Roberts' lineup, but come October, he'll be penciling in Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith and Teoscar Hernández every night. It's hard to argue with that.\n\nWhere there are serious questions with the Dodgers are in the pitching staff. Does 36-year-old Clayton Kershaw have anything left? Can Walker Buehler and Bobby Miller bounce back? Will Tyler Glasnow, Jack Flaherty and Yoshinobu Yamamoto be healthy when the playoffs roll around? Is 25-year-old Gavin Stone ready to be a key figure during a World Series run?\n\nEarning the No. 1 seed with healthy pitching down the stretch would give the Dodgers some real momentum heading into the playoffs, where they'll almost certainly be the odds-on favorites to win the World Series.\n\nMiami Marlins: Get Jesús Luzardo Back Healthy\n\n15 of 30\n\nRich Storry/Getty Images\n\nPresident of baseball operations Peter Bendix just completed a mass sell-off before the trade deadline, which will make the Marlins in August and September one of the most nondescript teams in MLB history.\n\nWhat's crazy is that the Fish traded so many players without moving Jesús Luzardo, who would have been one of the most coveted arms on the market had he been healthy. But he has been sidelined since mid-June with a lumbar stress reaction, which comes after he missed time earlier in the season with left elbow tightness.\n\nAssuming the Marlins still want Luzardo to pitch again this season and don't just elect to shut him down in the coming weeks, his return to the mound and a handful of strong starts before the end of the season would be a welcome sign in an otherwise lost campaign.\n\nWhether it's because the Marlins want to shop him in the offseason or envision him in their 2025 rotation with Sandy Alcántara and Eury Pérez when they return from Tommy John surgery, it would be nice to see Luzardo get back on the mound this year.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers: Get Christian Yelich Back, Win NL Central\n\n16 of 30\n\nMichael Owens/Getty Images\n\nWilliam Contreras, Willy Adames, Jackson Chourio and Rhys Hoskins may be able to provide enough offense for the Brewers to hold on and win the NL Central, but there's no question that they need to get former NL MVP Christian Yelich back to have a chance at a run in October.\n\nYelich is currently attempting a rest-and-rehab approach to deal with his lower back inflammation. If that doesn't work, he'll likely need season-ending surgery, which could put a fork in the Brewers' chances of making a deep postseason run.\n\nWhile he may never top the level of production he put up between 2018 and 2019, Yelich was in the midst of his best season since then, as he was hitting .315 with a .909 OPS and 21 stolen bases. He is, without question, the best hitter in manager Pat Murphy's lineup.\n\nEven if Yelich comes back, there are questions about whether the Brewers have enough starting pitching to compete in October. But he would give Milwaukee a formidable lineup, and if its bullpen is fully healthy, that might be the best unit in the Senior Circuit.\n\nMinnesota Twins: Win AL Central Title\n\n17 of 30\n\nBrace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images\n\nFor as great of a season as the Guardians are having, the Twins are still within striking distance in the AL Central. They may ultimately have to settle for a wild-card spot, but Rocco Baldelli's squad should be aiming to win their division.\n\nHere are three players to watch for the Twins as they try to usurp the Guardians.\n\n3B/DH Royce Lewis: When he's been available, Lewis has been electric for the Twins. The 2017 No. 1 overall pick is healthy right now, and he has 13 home runs and a 1.057 OPS in just 33 games this season.\n\nCF Byron Buxton: Right knee inflammation did cause Buxton to miss some time in May, but he's been about as healthy this year as any since he played 140 games in 2017. He remains an excellent defender in center field with three defensive runs saved, which he pairs with an .853 OPS. It's just a matter of the 30-year-old staying on the field.\n\n- Pablo López: A year after he was an All-Star and finished seventh in AL Cy Young Award voting, López has a disappointing 4.65 ERA in 22 starts this season. However, his 3.44 expected ERA and 3.75 FIP have suggested he's been unlucky, which might mean some positive regression is on the way.\n\nNew York Mets: Sneak Into Playoffs As Wild-Card Representative\n\n18 of 30\n\nRich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThere were various points early this year when it felt like the Mets' season was on the ropes. But first-year skipper Carlos Mendoza has steadied the ship, and New York is currently the first team out in the wild-card race.\n\nFrancisco Lindor is having an MVP-caliber season, but to overcome a relative lack of starting pitching, the Mets need a big stretch from Pete Alonso.\n\nThe slugging first baseman was an All-Star this season, but considering he posted an .846 OPS and averaged 43 home runs between 2022 and 2023, his .790 OPS and 23 home runs this year feel a bit underwhelming by his high standards.\n\nIf Alonso is able to go on a power tear over the final two months of the season, not only will it help the Mets to win a wild-card spot, but it will also leave them with an interesting decision as he hits free agency this offseason.\n\nNew York Yankees: Aaron Judge Breaks Own HR Record\n\n19 of 30\n\nAdam Hunger/Getty Images\n\nObviously, the Yankees have World Series aspirations as a team in 2024. But the power run Aaron Judge has been on over the past three seasons is historic, and will probably be the No. 1 thing to watch in baseball over the remainder of the regular season.\n\nOf course, the six-time All-Star set a new AL record with 62 home runs in 2022. He hit 37 in 2023, a staggering amount considering he played in only 106 games. And in 2024, he has 42 home runs already, putting him at least within striking distance of his own record if he has a monster finish to the regular season.\n\nIf Judge is able to even come close to breaking his own record, it would mean a few things.\n\nFirst of all, he stayed healthy for the full season, which is the only real question about him. Secondly, he would win his second AL MVP in three years. And thirdly, the Yankees would probably win the AL East and potentially capture top spot in the AL.\n\nOakland Athletics: Keep Mason Miller Healthy\n\n20 of 30\n\nDavid Berding/Getty Images\n\nBy all accounts, the Athletics never came close to trading All-Star closer Mason Miller before the trade deadline.\n\nFor a franchise that's done everything to dismantle itself in recent years, there's something encouraging about that.\n\nAt the same time, the A's likely could have fetched quite the trade return for the 25-year-old, who has a 2.21 ERA and 1.72 FIP over 34 games this season.\n\nIf he ends up with some sort of arm injury, there will be a lot of second-guessing of the decision for a non-competitive team to keep someone who missed a good chunk of time last year with right forearm tightness and averages 100.9 mph on his fastball.\n\nMiller is currently on the injured list with a broken left hand, but he should return this year. The A's can't just put him on ice for the rest of the year, but they would be wise to limit the amount of back-to-back appearances he has in the final two months of the campaign.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies: Win NL East, Claim No. 1 Seed\n\n21 of 30\n\nMitchell Leff/Getty Images\n\nFor as much success as the Phillies have had in October the last two years, they've made both runs as wild-card representatives. They haven't won the NL East since 2011, when they posted a franchise-record 102 wins.\n\nNot long ago, Philadelphia seemed to have a real shot to challenge that record, but an ice-cold start to the second half of the season from Bryce Harper and company makes that less likely. Still, it has a comfortable lead over the Braves and Mets, and it should be able to capture its first division title in 13 years.\n\nAdditionally, the Phillies have a chance to earn a first-round bye as one of the top two seeds in the NL, and home-field advantage throughout the postseason if they finish with the best record in the senior circuit.\n\nPittsburgh Pirates: Snap 8-Year Postseason Drought\n\n22 of 30\n\nTim Warner/Getty Images\n\nGiven how frequently power pitchers get hurt, it's encouraging to see that the Pirates realize what they have in star rookie Paul Skenes and are trying to make the best with him while he's pitching at a Cy Young level.\n\nPittsburgh general manager Ben Cherington made some nice minor additions prior to the deadline, adding powerful outfielder Bryan De La Cruz and super-utility man Isiah Kiner-Falefa. They will help the upgrade a lineup that doesn't have a ton of consistent contributors outside of left fielder Bryan Reynolds and shortstop Oneil Cruz, although catcher Joey Bart has been a pleasant surprise.\n\nAssuming RHP Jared Jones returns from a right lat strain, the Pirates have a starting rotation that could be scary in a short postseason series with him, Skenes and Mitch Keller.\n\nThe Pirates, of course, have to get there first. If they are successful in that quest, it would mark the first time they have reached the playoffs since 2015.\n\nSan Diego Padres: Secure Postseason Berth\n\n23 of 30\n\nBrandon Sloter/Getty Images\n\nIt's unclear if president of baseball operations A.J. Preller is actually on the hot seat or not, but the Padres reaching the postseason would silence any questions about his future as the top baseball executive in San Diego.\n\nSince adding RHP Dylan Cease late in spring training, Preller has acquired two-time batting champion Luis Arráez and a pair of excellent relievers in Jason Adam and Tanner Scott.\n\nIt's fair to wonder how some of these trades will look in the long run, but this is a playoff-caliber roster.\n\nHeck, with Manny Machado off to a tremendous start in the second half of the season, don't rule out the Padres pushing both the Dodgers and Diamondbacks for the NL West title.\n\nSan Francisco Giants: Decide Fate of Farhan Zaidi\n\n24 of 30\n\nDaniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nSpeaking of executives who may have uncertain futures, San Francisco president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi is probably at the top of the list.\n\nA year ago, manager Gabe Kapler was fired. The Giants remain a team without a true long-term core outside of ace Logan Webb, which reflects poorly on Zaidi.\n\nIn his defense, the Giants have made serious runs at Harper and Judge, among others, and ultimately finished runner-up by most accounts. They had signed Carlos Correa before backing out of the deal because of medical concerns.\n\nUnder Zaidi, the Giants have tried to woo some superstars. And for as beautiful as Oracle Park is, it's fair to say its reputation as a pitcher's paradise might be hurting them as they try to land position players in free agency.\n\nThe reality, though, is that this is Zaidi's sixth year on the job. Outside of a magical 2021 season when they won a franchise record 107 games, he doesn't have a ton to show.\n\nSeattle Mariners: Win AL West Title\n\n25 of 30\n\nSteph Chambers/Getty Images\n\nWill the additions of Randy Arozarena and Justin Turner—coupled with the eventual returns of Julio Rodríguez and J.P. Crawford—be enough for the Mariners to turn around what's been one of the league's worst offenses? It's fair to be skeptical.\n\nIf the Mariners get into the postseason, though, they are going to be scary. They have five pitchers you would trust to start in the playoffs in Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, Luis Castillo, Bryan Woo and Bryce Miller. They also have an All-Star closer in Andrés Muñoz.\n\nNow, if they can just score enough runs...\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals: Get Nolan Arenado, Paul Goldschmidt Back on Track\n\n26 of 30\n\nJoe Sargent/Getty Images\n\nIt's actually amazing that the Cardinals have been able to rebound from an 18-25 start when their two Hall of Fame-caliber bats—Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt—haven't performed like Hall of Fame-caliber bats.\n\nHowever, despite each having the worst offensive seasons of their illustrious careers, the Cardinals are in the thick of both the NL Central and wild-card races. If one or both of them heats up at the plate, there's a real chance St. Louis will reach the postseason in some form.\n\nIs there a day of reckoning coming for president of baseball operations John Mozeliak? Probably.\n\nGoldschmidt, 36, can become a free agent after this season. When 37-year-old Lance Lynn returns from an IL stint caused by right knee inflammation, the recently-acquired Erick Fedde, 31, will be the youngest starter in a rotation that also includes Kyle Gibson (36), Miles Mikolas (35) and Sonny Gray (34).\n\nSomething will have to give soon in St. Louis, but maybe it can come after Arenado and Goldschmidt help this era of Cardinals reach the playoffs one more time.\n\nTampa Bay Rays: See Signs of Growth From Christopher Morel\n\n27 of 30\n\nDouglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images\n\nThe Rays are still on the outskirts of the AL wild-card race, but president of baseball operations Erik Neander was so aggressive in selling before the July 30 trade deadline that it's fair to say Tampa Bay isn't expecting to reach the postseason.\n\nOne of the major trades the Rays made was sending third baseman Isaac Paredes to the Chicago Cubs, despite the 25-year-old being under team control for three more seasons after 2024.\n\nThat puts quite a bit of pressure on the return that the Rays received—slugger Christopher Morel, RHP Hunter Bigge and RHP Ty Johnson—to be a a big hit.\n\nBigge is currently at the MLB level, while Johnson is at High-A. But the best way to tell which way this deal is trending for the remainder of this season will be to watch what Morel does.\n\nStill only 25, he has 40-plus home run power at least. But he has a lot of swing and miss and no clear position defensively.\n\nThe best plan of action for the Rays might be to just have him serve as their primary DH moving forward, though he does have experience all over the diamond defensively.\n\nUltimately, this will come down to his bat. If Morel can become someone who hits .240 and homers 40-ish times per year, he'll have success hitting in the middle of manager Kevin Cash's order for the foreseeable future.\n\nTexas Rangers: Win AL West Title\n\n28 of 30\n\nScott Taetsch/Getty Images\n\nThere's definitely been something of a World Series hangover for the Rangers, but the defending champs are still within striking distance of the top of the AL West.\n\nUnlike last season, they are probably going to need to win the division to get into the postseason. But some reinforcements could be on the way.\n\n- Tyler Mahle' made his first start of the season on Tuesday after completing his comeback from Tommy John surgery.\n\n- Also potentially looming is two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom, who is working his way back from the same procedure and could be a weapon down the stretch if he continues to progress, perhaps even as a reliever.\n\n- Max Scherzer is currently on the 10-day IL with shoulder fatigue, but it's not expected to be an extended absence for the three-time Cy Young winner.\n\n- Lower back tightness probably means September is a more realistic target for left fielder Evan Carter, but he remains a possibility.\n\nInternally, second baseman Marcus Semien (.722 OPS), José Leclerc (4.08 ERA) and right fielder Adolis García (.660 OPS) are all candidates to get better results than they did in the first four months of the season.\n\nManager Bruce Bochy's team has a path to the postseason, but there are a lot of \"ifs\" that have to fall the Rangers' way for it to be realized.\n\nToronto Blue Jays: Sign Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to Extension\n\n29 of 30\n\nCole Burston/Getty Images\n\nMaybe we're giving them too much credit, but the Blue Jays didn't just hold onto both first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and shortstop Bo Bichette because they are hopeful to contend in 2025, right?\n\nBichette, in particular, seemed like someone worth cashing in considering he can become a free agent after the 2025 season and his camp has not-so-subtly hinted he might not mind a change of scenery.\n\nIn that case, Guerrero should probably be the focus. Like Bichette, he can become a free agent after next season. He may never match his 2021 campaign when he finished runner-up in AL MVP voting, but he is having his finest season since then, with a .316 batting average, 22 home runs, 72 RBI and a .925 OPS.\n\nPerhaps reaching an extension with Guerrero before the season isn't realistic, but it doesn't hurt to place a legitimate offer in front of him and his representatives at Magnus Sports.\n\nPerhaps it will give them some momentum toward a deal heading into the offseason. Or it will show general manager Ross Atkins that the Blue Jays and the 25-year-old first baseman are far apart on an extension, which may force them to consider trading the four-time All-Star.\n\nWashington Nationals: See Growth From James Wood\n\n30 of 30\n\nMitchell Layton/Getty Images\n\nThe fact that president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo decided to hold onto All-Star reliever Kyle Finnegan, who has one more remaining year of arbitration eligibility, suggests that the Nationals think they can be competitive in 2025.\n\nThat might require some external additions in the offseason and a recommitment to spending from ownership. Internally, though, there's arguably not a bigger piece to watch than left fielder James Wood.\n\nThe 6'7\", 234-pound rookie has 20 RBI in around a month at the MLB level, but he has graded out poorly in the field, with minus-3 defensive runs saved and minus-4 outs above average.\n\nIt would be a welcome sign for the future of the Nationals if Wood—acquired from the Padres in the Juan Soto trade in July 2022—starts to settle and finishes his rookie campaign on a high note at the plate. That might give the Nationals some confidence to spend in the offseason to put a team around the 21-year-old.\n\nAlso, enjoy the final months of the Nationals' cherry blossom City Connect uniforms. They are being taken out of our lives far too soon.\n\nX"
