        "text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., March 15 - Manager Willie Randolph likes to say his mood can be measured by how long Ray Ramirez, the head trainer, spends in his office every morning.\n\nA few weeks ago, when Pedro Martínez's troublesome toe represented the Mets' only major injury concern, Ramirez could drop off a report and be in and out in less than a minute. Recently, however, the duration of his visits has increased to the point that he may consider eating breakfast in Randolph's office. Carlos Delgado revealed his elbow tendinitis, Cliff Floyd disclosed a potential kidney problem and Juan Padilla had season-ending ligament-replacement surgery on his right elbow.\n\nBut within a 90-minute span Wednesday, Martínez and Floyd each had good news regarding their health. Martínez forged ahead in his recovery, throwing batting practice for the first time this season. Afterward he said that he felt great and that he intended to throw another session before pitching in a game toward the end of next week.\n\nFloyd returned from a consultation with a kidney specialist, who told him his kidneys were functioning at 65 percent efficiency -- an improvement of nearly 20 percent since the Mets' initial physical in mid-February, but still not an ideal number. The specialist also told him that his creatinine and blood-urea-nitrogen levels had returned to normal. In other words, Floyd said, he is no longer in danger of kidney failure, as was previously feared.\n\n\"When she walked in, the first thing she said was that she had good news,\" Floyd said. \"I thought that was sweet. Now, it's over and I can get back to playing ball.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old Floyd, who has a family history of kidney problems, was told a week ago that his kidneys were functioning at 48 percent efficiency. He had several tests, including an ultrasound, last Thursday to assess his condition. Dr. Barbara Murphy, chief of the division of nephrology at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that it was not unusual for kidney function to improve that drastically in a few weeks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
