        "text": "The Chicago Cubs selected Martinez in the January phase of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft.[4][5] After he signed, he played for the Geneva Cubs of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League[6] and the Quad Cities Cubs of the Class A Midwest League.[7] He began the 1984 season with Quad Cities,[8] and in 1985, he received a promotion to the Winston-Salem Spirits of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League.[9] Martinez led the Carolina League with a .342 batting average; the second-place finishers, Keith Miller and John Wilson, batted .302.[10] Martinez began the 1986 season with the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA American Association.[11]\n\nThe Cubs promoted Martinez to the major leagues for the first time on June 15, 1986,[12] and he served as an injury replacement for Bob Dernier.[13] He had a .119 batting average (8-for-67) before he was optioned back to the minor leagues in August.[14] Martinez made the Cubs major league roster in 1987,[15] splitting time in center field with Dernier.[16] He batted .292 in 142 games.[17] Martinez struggled in the 1988 season, batting .230 in mid-June.[18] On July 14, 1988, Martinez was traded to the Montreal Expos in exchange for Mitch Webster.[19][20] He finished 1988 with a .255 batting average and 23 stolen bases.[21]\n\nMartinez was pegged as a platoon player in Montreal, as he batted against right-handed pitchers and sat against left-handed pitchers. The Expos also had outfielders Otis Nixon, Marquis Grissom, and Larry Walker on their roster.[2] He played 126 games in 1989, hitting .274.[21] In 1990, Martinez lost the competition for the center field job to Grissom. However, Grissom was injured,[22] and Martinez platooned with Nixon in center field. Martinez batted .279 with 11 home runs in 118 games in 1990.[23] He batted .295 in 1991.[24] After the 1991 season, the Expos traded Martinez with Willie Greene and Scott Ruskin to the Cincinnati Reds for Bill Risley and John Wetteland. He was sought out as a replacement for Eric Davis for the Reds.[24] He competed with Reggie Sanders for the starting job during spring training.[25][26]\n\nMartinez played for Cincinnati in 1992, but as Sanders established himself as the Reds' starting center fielder, Martinez declared for free agency after the season. He signed with the San Francisco Giants on a two-year contract for the 1993 and 1994 seasons. He suffered a torn hamstring in 1993[27] and was limited to 91 games. He hit .241, his lowest average in several seasons.[21] The Giants waived Martinez in October 1994 after he was held to a .247 average, four home runs and 27 runs batted in (RBIs).[28]\n\nMartinez signed a one-year, $500,000 contract with the Chicago White Sox for the 1995 season. He received limited playing time under manager Gene Lamont. When Lamont was replaced by Terry Bevington, Martinez saw an increase in playing time.[29] He signed a two-year $1.425 million contract for the 1996 and 1997 seasons.[30] He spent the 1996 season as a backup behind Darren Lewis, Tony Phillips, and Danny Tartabull, along with fellow backup Lyle Mouton.[31]\n\nIn 1997, Martinez batted, .286 and set career highs with 12 home runs and 55 RBIs. He then signed a two-year contract with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays worth $3.5 million with an option for a third season at $1.75 million.[32][33][34] In addition his desire to play in Florida, he was enticed by the Rays' additions of Fred McGriff, Wilson Álvarez, and Roberto Hernández.[2] In 1998, he recorded the first hit in Tampa history.[5] His contract option for the 2000 season vested when he recorded his 500th at bat of the 1999 season.[35]\n\nAfter batting .260 in his first 29 games of the 2000 season, the Devil Rays, who needed to improve their pitching staff, traded Martinez to the Cubs for Mark Guthrie and cash.[36] On June 9, 2000, the Cubs traded Martinez to the Texas Rangers in a three team trade that sent Chuck Smith from the Florida Marlins to the Rangers and Brant Brown from the Marlins to the Cubs.[37] On August 4, 2000, the Rangers traded Martinez to the Toronto Blue Jays for a player to be named later.[38][39] The Blue Jays sent Peter Munro to the Rangers to complete the trade.[40] By playing for four MLB teams in one season, Martinez tied the record. Since 1901, the previous players to play for four MLB teams in a season were Frank Huelsman (1904), Willis Hudlin (1940), Paul Lehner (1951), Wes Covington (1961), Mike Kilkenny (1972), and Dave Kingman (1977). Dan Miceli (2003) and José Bautista (2004) later achieved the feat.[41] With Toronto, he filled in for the injured Raúl Mondesí as the Blue Jays contended for the American League wild card.[42] Between the four teams, he had a .274 batting average, five home runs, and 47 runs batted in (RBIs) in 132 games.[43] He is one of the few players to play for both major league Canadian teams, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos.[44]"
