        "text": "Golshifteh started her acting career in theater at the age of 6 and has always kept a strong link with theater, but it was at the age of 14 that she acted in her first film Derakhte Golabi (1998), for which she won the prize for the Best Actress from the international section of the Fajr film festival, immediately making her one of the stars of Iranian cinema. Since then she has played in more than 15 films, many of which have been screened or awarded at international festivals. Amongst her latest films are Bahman Ghobadi's Half Moon (2006) (winner of the Golden Seashell at the San Sebastián film festival 2006), Dariush Mehrjui's controversial Santouri (2007), still banned in Iran, and the late Rasool Mollagholi Poor's Mim mesle madar (2006), which after a huge success in Iran was chosen to represent Iran for the Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards in 2008. After playing in Der Mann, der niemals lebte (2008) by Ridley Scott, Golshifteh became the first Iranian star to act in a major Hollywood production. Subsequently she was banned from her country. Her last film in Iran Alles über Elly (2009) won a Silver Bear in Berlin and the Best Narrative Feature at Tribeca (2009). Golshifteh graduated from music school, she sings and plays the piano amongst other instruments. She is also fluent in French and English and lives in Paris now.\n\nMatthias Schoenaerts was born on December 8, 1977 in Antwerp, Belgium. His mother, Dominique Wiche, was a costume designer, translator, and French teacher, and his father was actor Julien Schoenaerts. He made his film debut at the age of 13 alongside his father in the Belgian film Priester der Entrechteten (1992), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Schoenaerts enrolled in film school but was expelled for poor attendance in his second year. By age 21, he was enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Antwerp and was acting professionally in small roles on Belgian television and in Belgian film. By the time he graduated in 2003, Schoenaerts was already named one of \"Europe's Shooting Stars\" by the influential marketing organization, European Film Promotion.\n\nIn 2002, he starred in Dorothée Van Den Berghe's directorial debut Meisje (2002), which was also his first feature film since Daens. With his role in Tom Barman's Any Way the Wind Blows (2003), he proved he was Flanders' young actor to watch.\n\nIn 2004, Schoenaerts produced and starred in the short film A Message from Outer Space (2004). He also appeared in Ellen Calling - Nachricht vom Schicksal (2004) alongside his father.\n\nIn 2006, he had a small role as a member of the Dutch Resistance in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book (2006), and landed his first starring role in the Belgian film Dennis van Rita (2006), playing Dennis, a mentally-challenged man learning to adjust to life after a prison sentence for a rape he may not have committed.\n\nThough Schoenaerts garnered critical praise for his role in \"Love Belongs to Everyone\", the film that would make him a star in his homeland came in 2008, in Erik Van Looy's Loft - Tödliche Affären (2008), Schoenaerts played Filip, one of a group of married friends who share the rent on a downtown loft as a place to meet their respective mistresses. The dramatic thriller was a smash hit, becoming the top-grossing Flemish film of all time. In the same year, he also starred in the horror film Linkeroever (2008).\n\nIn 2009, he worked once again with director Dorothée Van Den Berghe, playing the hippie Raven in My Queen Karo (2009). In 2010, he played the lead role in Alex Stockman's techno-thriller Pulsar (2010).\n\nIn 2011, Schoenaerts starred in Michaël R. Roskam's Bullhead (2011), playing Jacky Vanmarsenille, a cattle farmer who becomes entangled with the underworld of bovine hormones and steroids. Impressed by the script, Schoenaerts committed to star in the film in 2005, and over the five years that it took first-time director Roskam to secure financing, the actor transformed his naturally thin body into that of a steroid-abusing brute. His powerful performance in the tragic role won awards at numerous film festivals and propelled \"Bullhead\" to an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Schoenaerts got the lead role opposite Marion Cotillard in Jacques Audiard's Der Geschmack von Rost und Knochen (2012); in the film he played Ali, an ex-boxer who falls in love with Cotillard's character. Like Audiard's previous films, \"Rust and Bone\" received a breathless reception at the Cannes Film Festival with a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening and was a critical and box office hit in France. Schoenaerts' performance in the film earned him a César Award for Most Promising Actor in 2013.\n\nSchoenaerts also starred in the Belgian short film Dood van een Schaduw (2012), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 2013 and won the European Film Award for Best European Short.\n\nIn 2013, he starred in Blood Ties (2013) after being recommended for the film by his co-star in \"Rust and Bone\", Marion Cotillard. Following his breakthrough in \"Rust and Bone\", Matthias started a career in Hollywood and landed roles in American and British productions like Saul Dibb's Suite Française - Melodie der Liebe (2014), Alan Rickman's Die Gärtnerin von Versailles (2014), Michaël R. Roskam's The Drop - Bargeld (2014), and Thomas Vinterberg's Am grünen Rand der Welt (2015).\n\nIn 2015, Schoenaerts returned to French cinema in Alice Winocour's Der Bodyguard - Sein Letzter Auftrag (2015), in which he plays an ex-soldier with PTSD. He also played one of the leads of Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), opposite Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes, and played the art-dealer Hans Axgil in Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl (2015).\n\nHe will reteam with Michaël R. Roskam in Racer and the Jailbird (2017) and also with Thomas Vinterberg in Kursk (2018), in which Schoenaerts will play the captain of a Russian submarine.\n\nKyle Gallner was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He started his career by following his sister along to one of her auditions.\n\nPerhaps best know for his role as Cassidy \"Beaver\" Casablancas on the CW's lone hit series, Veronica Mars (2004), actor Kyle Gallner had been appearing in films and on television since his early adolescence. Born on Oct. 22, 1986 and originally from Philadelphia, PA, Gallner made his first screen appearance on an episode of Third Watch: Einsatz am Limit (1999).

He next appeared in the series finale of The District - Einsatz in Washington (2000) before playing his first recognizable role - that of Bart Allen (a.k.a. \"The Flash\") on Smallville (2001) during the 2004-05 season.\n\nIn 2005, Gallner joined the cast of Veronica Mars (2004) for the last three episodes of the first season, giving him the opportunity to carry over his role of Beaver into the next season. During his run on \"Veronica Mars,\" Gallner continued making guest spots, appearing in episodes of Jack & Bobby (2004), Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003), CSI: New York (2004) and Bones: Die Knochenjägerin (2005). Gallner began a recurring role as a devout Mormon in the controversial HBO series Big Love (2006).

Her grandfather owned a casino, Karl's Silver Club, in Reno. She was raised by her mother and her mother's partner. Beginning as a child actress, and then stepping up to roles as a young adult, Malone's career path has been compared to that of Jodie Foster, herself a former child actress and who has co-starred with Malone in two movies. Jena is often described as having a maturity beyond her years and, in her career thus far, she has often tackled roles that are difficult and are not standard fare for actors her age.\n\nMalone's first claim to fame was in performing the title role in Schutzlos - Schatten über Carolina (1996) for which she won the Young Artist Award, and which she filmed when she was merely ten years old. This movie dealt with issues of child abuse, violence and sex. Jena has said in later interviews that this movie and her participation in it continue to influence her life substantially.\n\nShowing self-assurance and a clear vision of personal goals from an early age, Jena, at age 14, was encouraged to try out for Air Force One (1997), a movie that was virtually guaranteed to be a success since box-office king Harrison Ford was cast in the lead, but Jena said she'd prefer to seek other roles that were of more interest to her.\n\nIn the following years, Malone appeared in several made-for-TV movies for which she won or was nominated for many awards. In 1997, she lucked in to being cast in the blockbuster Contact (1997) where she portrayed the child version of Jodie Foster's lead character. Foster stated that she built her character by mimicking Jena. And, in 1998, Jena was cast in the major film Seite an Seite (1998) where she co-starred with Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris. Jena was given what was likely the best line in that movie where her character, bitter over her parents' divorce, confronts her father who has returned home briefly; at a moment of crisis, her dad tells her \"You do NOT run out on your mother\", and the rueful Malone exclaims \"No -- that's YOUR job\".\n\nAlso, in 1998, Malone appeared in a two-part episode of the critically acclaimed TV series Homicide (1993). Contrary to what might usually be expected of a teenage actress, in this episode, Jena played the complex role of the perpetrator of a crime, which she portrayed with subtlety.\n\nAt age 15, Jena was legally emancipated and thus took direct control of her finances and her career. Malone began getting more attention and acclaim in her next set of films: the artistic cult film Donnie Darko (2001); the teenage journey Lost Heaven (2002) where she again co-starred with Jodie Foster; and the satirical Saved! - Die Highschool-Missionarinnen (2004) which debuted Jena as the lead in a movie.\n\nJena has expressed an interest in directing some day, and so she is preparing for roles behind the camera as well as in front. In 2002, she co-produced American Girl (2002) while also starring in it. And, in 2003, she undertook a formal study of photography.\n\nIn early 2006, Malone debuted on the Broadway stage in the play \"Doubt\". A review by Broadway.com characterized her performance as \"astonishing\".\n\nMany people in Hollywood have jobs as actors. Watch for Jena Malone. She is an artist."
