        "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. — Zach Neto drove in a career-high four runs, including three with a go-ahead home run in the seventh inning, and the Los Angeles Angels rallied for a 5-4 victory over the New York Mets on Saturday night despite J.D. Martinez's second grand slam in eight games.\n\nNeto connected on a cutter from Huascar Brazobán (1-3) and put it in the Mets' bullpen in left field to put the Halos back on top.\n\nMichael Stefanic started the rally with a two-out base hit and Nolan Schanuel drew a walk to set the table for Neto's team-leading 17th homer of the season. It came on the eighth pitch of the at-bat and after the Angels' shortstop had fouled off three straight pitches.\n\n\"To finally be able to get a good pitch and drive it and be a big time hero for us, it was big time,\" said Neto, who also had an RBI single in the fifth inning as the Angels snapped a three-game losing streak.\n\nMatt Moore (5-2) got the win and Ben Joyce retired all four hitters he faced in 1 1/3 innings for his first big league save. The hard-throwing right-hander struck out Martinez for the final out on a 104.7 mile per hour fastball, the fastest pitch in the majors this season. According to Sportradar, it is tied for the sixth-fastest pitch since 2009.\n\nJoyce has a 23 inning scoreless streak and has not allowed a run in 18 straight outings since June 14.\n\n\"It was a different level there. It was an 0-2 pitch. Just try to let it eat and and ended up getting a good result,\" Joyce said.\n\nMartinez said \"I'm going to be all over Instagram striking out\" when he heard it was the fastest pitch this season.\n\nThe Angels led 2-0 going into the seventh after starter José Soriano tossed six shutout innings and Kevin Pillar made a pair of great defensive plays. But the Mets loaded the bases with one out and Martinez drove a low and inside sinker from Hunter Strickland over the wall in center.\n\nIt was Martinez's 10th career grand slam. He also hit one on July 26 against Atlanta.\n\nThe Mets' designated hitter is batting .324 (12 for 37) with 11 RBIs in his last 10 games.\n\n\"Anytime we get the lead late in the game there's faith in the bullpen but it happens,\" Martinez said. \"We had a chance there to tie it in the eighth and then they (the Angels' bullpen) held us down.\"\n\nSoriano struck out six and allowed five hits with two walks. The right-hander has a 2.98 ERA in his last eight starts, with the Angels going 6-2 in those games.\n\nPillar made an impact on the game's opening play with a diving catch at the warning track in center on Francisco Lindor's line drive. In the fourth inning, Pillar threw out Jeff McNeil at second base when he tried to stretch a single.\n\nPillar also came through with his offense. He lined a base hit to left with two outs in the first to drive in Neto.\n\n\"He runs great roles and he's aware of everything that's going on in the game,\" Angels manager Ron Washington said. \"I'm not surprised. I'm just glad he caught it, because you never know what it would have turned that first inning into.\"\n\nTrainer's room\n\nAngels: IF Luis Rengifo was placed on the injured list for the second time this season due to right wrist inflammation.\n\nFarm report\n\nMets' pitching prospect Brandon Sproat is expected to be promoted to Triple-A Syracuse after a dominant outing for Double-A Binghamton on Friday night. The right-hander — a second-round pick in the 2023 amateur draft — struck out the last 11 batters he faced in five innings against New Hampshire. Sproat allowed two hits and struck out 13 overall.\n\nUp next\n\nMets LHP Jose Quintana (6-6, 3.89 ERA) has won both of his starts since the All-Star break. Angels RHP Griffin Canning (3-10, 5.25 ERA) is 0-2 in his last six outings."
