It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood.\n\nGoals:\n\n(1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.\n\nMethods:\n\nTopic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention.\n\nEnvironmental Findings:\n\nPollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources – coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths.\n\nEcosystem Findings:\n\nOcean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks.\n\nHuman Health Findings:\n\nMethylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children’s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals – phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste – can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South – environmental injustice on a planetary scale.\n\nConclusions:\n\nOcean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth’s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.\n\nOcean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.\n\nPrevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nWorld leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.\n\nPrevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.\n\nFurther interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.\n\nDesignation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe oceans are vast. They cover more than 70% of the earth’s surface, hold 97% of the world’s water, host some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems, and support economies in countries around the world [1,2]. Microscopic organisms in the seas are a major source of atmospheric oxygen [3,4,5,6]. By absorbing more than 90% of the excess heat released into the earth’s environment and nearly one-third of carbon dioxide emissions, the oceans slow planetary warming and stabilize the global climate [7].\n\nThe oceans are essential to human health and well-being [8,9,10,11,12,13]. They provide food to billions, livelihoods for millions and are the source of multiple essential medicines [14]. They have traditional cultural value and are a source of joy, beauty, peace, and recreation [15,16]. The oceans are particularly important to the health and well-being of people in small island nations [17], the high Arctic, and coastal communities, especially those in the Global South [1]. The very survival of these vulnerable populations depends on the health of the seas [10,12].\n\nDespite their vast size, the oceans are under threat, and human activity is the main source of the threat [1,2]. Climate change and other environmental disruptions of human origin have caused sea surface temperatures to rise, glaciers to melt, and harmful algal species and pathogenic bacteria to migrate into waters that were previously uncontaminated. Rising seas and increasingly violent coastal storms endanger the 600 million people worldwide who live within 10 m of sea level [1]. Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have caused acidification of the oceans, which in turn destroys coral reefs, impairs development of oysters and other shellfish, and dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the food web [1,18,19]. The oceans are losing oxygen [1]. Fish stocks are declining [20,21,22]. Dredging, mechanized trawling, oil exploration, and planned deep undersea metal mining threaten the seabeds [23].\n\nPollution – unwanted, often hazardous waste material released into the environment by human activity – is one of the existential challenges of the present age [24]. Like climate change, biodiversity loss, and depletion of the world’s fresh water supply, pollution endangers the stability of the earth’s support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies [8].\n\nPollution is also a great and growing threat to human health. It is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today, responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths per year [24]. It causes enormous economic losses, undermines national trajectories of economic development, and impedes attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [22].\n\nPollution has until recently been overlooked in international development planning and largely neglected in the global health agenda [25]. For too long, pollution has been regarded as the unavoidable price of economic progress [25], a view that arose out of the experience of the 19th and 20th centuries when combustion of fossil fuels – coal in particular – was the engine of economic growth and pollution was seen as unavoidable. Today, however, the claim that pollution is inevitable and that pollution control costs jobs and stifles economies is no longer tenable. It has been disproven by the experience of the many countries that have more than doubled their GDPs in the past half century while greatly reducing pollution [24,25,26]. It has become irrelevant with the increasing availability of low-cost, renewable sources of energy and advances in green chemistry.\n\nOcean pollution is a critically important but underrecognized component of global pollution [26,27]. It has multiple direct and indirect impacts on human health [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. The nature and magnitude of these effects are only beginning to be understood.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to examine the impacts of ocean pollution on human health and well-being, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer scientifically based guidance for effective interventions. Information presented in this review will guide attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, SDG 14, which calls for prevention and significant reduction of all marine pollution, and SDG 3, which calls for improvement of human health and well-being.\n\nThe ultimate aim of this report is to increase awareness of ocean pollution among policy makers, elected leaders, civil society and the public and to catalyze global action to monitor, control, and prevent pollution of the seas.\n\nBy focusing our analysis on human impacts, we underscore the fact that pollution of the oceans poses a clear and present danger to human health. It is causing disease, disability, and premature death in countries around the world today.\n\nOn the positive side, pollution of the oceans is not inevitable. It is a problem of human origin, and the successes in pollution control that have been achieved in many countries show that it can be controlled and prevented.\n\nWorld leaders who recognize the great magnitude of ocean pollution, acknowledge its grave dangers to human health, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action will be key to stop ocean pollution at its source and safeguarding human health.\n\nMethods\n\nThis report consists of a series of topic-focused reviews that critically examine current knowledge of each ocean pollutant – its sources, magnitude, geographic extent, populations at greatest risk, and its known and potential effects on human health. We examine the strength of the evidence linking pollutants to health effects [29].\n\nTo the extent possible, we consider health effects not only of individual pollutants, but also of the complex mixtures of chemical pollutants and biological contaminants found in the seas today. We examine interactions and synergies among pollution, climate change and ocean acidification. Because the effects of pollution are disproportionately concentrated in low-income countries in the Global South, small island nations, and indigenous populations in the far north [12], we specifically examine ocean pollution’s impacts on these vulnerable populations. Finally, we consider the prospects for prevention and control of ocean pollution and present case studies of success in pollution control.\n\nFindings\n\nThe Current State of Ocean Pollution\n\nPollution of the oceans is widespread, it is worsening, and its geographic extent is expanding [26,27,30]. Ocean pollution is a complex and ever-changing mixture of chemicals and biological materials that includes plastic waste, petroleum-based pollutants, toxic metals, manufactured chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and a noxious stew of nitrogen, phosphorus, fertilizer, and sewage (Figure ).\n\nSome ocean pollutants are “legacy” pollutants, materials deposited in the seas decades ago, while others are new. The relative concentrations of pollutants vary in different regions of the oceans and at different seasons of the year. Plastic pollution is the most visible component of ocean pollution. It is growing rapidly, but it is only the obvious tip of a much larger problem.\n\nLand-based sources account for approximately 80% of ocean pollution, while discharges from marine shipping, offshore industrial operations, and waste disposal at sea account for the remaining 20% [26]. Pollution is most severe along coastlines and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where wastewater discharges, industrial releases, agricultural runoff, and riverine pollution cause massive in-shore contamination. Some of the world’s worst ocean pollution is seen along the coasts of rapidly developing countries in the Global South [26].\n\nThe European Environment Agency (EEA) reports that pollution by toxic metals, industrial chemicals and plastic wastes is at problem levels in 96% of the Baltic Sea, in 91% of the Black Sea, in 87% of the Mediterranean Sea, and in 75% of the North-East Atlantic Ocean [27]. Pollution by plastic waste has become a global threat [31].\n\nThe drivers of ocean pollution are rapid industrialization; continuing increases in the manufacture and release into the environment of chemicals and plastics; expansion of chemically intensive agriculture; massive releases of liquid and solid waste into rivers, harbors, and estuaries; and insufficient re-use and recycling of feedstock materials [16,32]. Specific sources of ocean pollution are:\n\nCoal combustion and gold-mining are the two main sources of marine mercury pollution [33].\n\nExponential growth in chemical production coupled with inadequate controls on chemical releases are the main drivers of pollution of the oceans by manufactured chemicals [34].\n\nMarine pollution by plastic waste reflects massive global growth in plastic production, which now exceeds 420 million tons per year [35].\n\nUncontrolled economic development and rapid population growth along the world’s coasts has led to pollution of in-shore waters by industrial releases, agricultural runoff and sewage [36,37,38,39]. Many populated coastal areas are now covered by buildings and impervious surfaces, which increases runoff. This runoff as well as discharges of wastewater and storm water, much of it inadequately treated, further increases pollution. The consequences are increasing abundance of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites [40], eutrophication, and increased frequency and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) – “red tides”, “brown tides”, and “green tides” – some of which produce potent disease-causing toxins.\n\nDespite the great magnitude of ocean pollution and growing recognition of its effects on human and ecosystem health, great gaps remain in knowledge about pollution sources, levels of pollution in many areas of the seas, the sizes of high-risk populations, the extent of human exposure, and the magnitude of health effects. Because of these gaps, the impacts of ocean pollution on human health and well-being are underestimated, and it is not yet possible to fully quantify the contribution of ocean pollution to the global burden of disease [41].\n\nClimate Change, Global Warming, Ocean Acidification, and Pollution\n\nSince the 1970s, the oceans have warmed steadily in concert with global climate change [42]. They have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat released into the climate system [1]. Mean sea surface temperature is rising by 0.13°C per decade [43]. The frequency of marine heatwaves has more than doubled [1].\n\nFurther impacts of climate change on the oceans are increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy rainstorms, and major hurricanes, and changes in large-scale planetary phenomena such as El Niño events [44] and the Indian Ocean Dipole [1,45,46].\n\nOcean acidification is another consequence of climate change. The oceans absorb nearly one-third of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere, and the amount of CO2 absorbed by the seas has increased in recent decades as CO2 emissions of human origin have increased. Ocean acidification is the result [7]. Since the late 1980s, the surface pH of the open ocean has declined by about 0.1 pH units relative to preindustrial time (i.e., a 26% increase in acidity [hydrogen ion concentration]), and the rate of increase is 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade [1].\n\nOcean acidification threatens the integrity of coral reefs. It impairs the development of oysters and other commercially important shellfish, thus impacting commercial fisheries. It endangers the survival of calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web [1,47]. Ocean acidification may also increase the toxicity of certain heavy metals and organic pollutants [1,48].\n\nGlobal warming liberates legacy pollutants from ice and permafrost, alters the geographic distribution of chemical pollutants in the oceans, and increases exposures of previously unexposed populations. All of these effects have potential to magnify the ocean pollution’s impacts on human health [49].\n\nRising sea surface temperatures and increasing ocean pollution result in greater abundance and expanded geographic ranges of naturally occurring marine pathogens, such as Vibrio species, among them Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera [50,51] (Figure ). The likely consequences will be increases in the frequency of Vibrio-associated illnesses and spread of these infections to new, previously unaffected areas. Risk is especially high in low-income countries where coastal development is intense and sanitation systems are dysfunctional due to civil unrest, conflict, sea level rise, coastal over-development, and natural disasters [52].\n\nIn a similar manner, climate change, sea surface warming, and ocean pollution appear to be increasing the frequency, severity, and global geographic extent of harmful algal blooms (HABs) [53,54]. Some dangerous algal species are moving poleward in response to the warming of coastal waters [54,55], changes in ocean stratification, alteration of currents, changes in nutrient upwelling, and changes in land runoff and micronutrient availability [56,57]. The likely consequences will be the occurrence of HABs in previously unaffected areas and exposures of previously unexposed populations in the circumpolar regions to HAB toxins.\n\nImpacts of Ocean Pollution on Human Health\n\nChemical Pollutants\n\nToxic Metal Pollutants\n\nReleases of toxic metals to the environment began millennia ago with the inception of mining and smelting. These releases have increased since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and risen especially in the past two centuries [58,59,60].\n\nMercury is the metal pollutant in the oceans of greatest concern for human health [34]. Over the past 500 years, human activities have increased total environmental mercury loading by about 450% above natural background. About 70% of the mercury circulating in the environment today consists of mercury emitted from human sources in the past, termed legacy mercury [61] (Figure ). The presence of large quantities of legacy mercury in the global environment and the potential for climate change to remobilize this mercury complicate projections of future exposures and health impacts.\n\nCurrent Sources of Mercury Pollution\n\nAn estimated 2,220 tons of mercury are currently emitted to the environment each year as the direct result of human activity. These emissions account for about 30% of current mercury emissions. Another 60% of current mercury emissions result from environmental recycling of anthropogenic mercury previously deposited in soils and water. The remaining 10% comes from natural sources such as volcanoes.\n\nCombustion of coal and artisanal/small-scale gold-mining (ASGM) are the two principal human sources of current mercury emissions. All coal contains mercury and when coal is burned, mercury is released into the atmosphere where it can travel for long distances until ultimately it precipitates into rivers, and lakes and the oceans.\n\nIn ASGM, mercury is used to form an amalgam to separate gold from rock. The amalgam is heated to boil off the mercury leaving the gold behind. ASGM operations release mercury to the environment through vaporization and through runoff of spilled mercury into waterways [34]. Metal mining and oil and gas exploration can be additional sources of mercury release. In rivers, lakes and the oceans, the metallic, inorganic mercury released to the environment from these sources is converted by marine microorganisms into methylmercury, an organic form of mercury that is a potent neurotoxicant.\n\nThe largest fraction of global mercury emissions – about 49% – originate today in East and South-East Asia. Coal combustion and industrial releases are the major sources there. South America accounts for 18% of global mercury emissions and Sub-Saharan Africa for 16%. In both of these regions, ASGM is the major source of mercury releases.\n\nMethylmercury is a persistent pollutant in the marine environment. It bioconcentrates as it moves up the food web, so that top predator species such as tuna, striped bass and bluefish as well as marine mammals can accumulate concentrations of methylmercury in their tissues that are 10 million or more times greater than those in surrounding waters [34].\n\nMercury levels vary substantially in different regions of the ocean. This variation is seen in a recent survey of methylmercury concentrations in yellowfin tuna, in which levels differed by 26-fold around the world. Highest levels were found in tuna from the North Pacific Ocean (Figure ), and these high concentrations reflect mercury releases from coal-fired power plants and steel mills in Asia that are carried northeastward across the Pacific on the prevailing winds [62,63].\n\nHuman exposure to methylmercury occurs primarily through consumption of contaminated fish and marine mammals [34,64] Populations in the circumpolar region are heavily exposed to mercury in their diets – principally in the form of methylmercury – as a consequence of their traditional consumption of a diet rich in fish and marine mammals. Most of the mercury to which these populations are exposed originates from sources far away.\n\nNeurobehavioral Toxicity of Methylmercury\n\nThe brain is the organ in the human body most vulnerable to methylmercury. This vulnerability is greatest during periods of rapid brain growth – the nine months of pregnancy and the first years of postnatal life [65].\n\nThere appears to be no safe level of methylmercury exposure in early human development.\n\nProspective epidemiological cohort studies undertaken in the Faroe Islands demonstrate that children exposed to methylmercury in utero exhibit decreased motor function, shortened attention span, reduced verbal abilities, diminished memory and reductions in other mental functions. Follow-up of these children to age 22 years indicates that these deficits persist and appear to be permanent [66].\n\nA similar study conducted in Nunavik of child development at age 11 years showed that methylmercury exposure in early life is associated with slowed processing of visual information, decreased IQ, diminished comprehension and perceptual reasoning, impaired memory, shortened attention span, and increased risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [67,68]. Other prospective studies have also reported neurobehavioral deficits in children with elevated prenatal exposure to methylmercury [69].\n\nMercury exposure later in childhood and also in adolescence can also cause damage because the human brain continues to develop throughout this time [70]. Genetic factors may increase vulnerability to methylmercury in some individuals [71].\n\nAccelerated Loss of Neurocognitive Function in Adults Exposed to Methylmercury\n\nRecent studies have shown that adult exposures to methylmercury can also have negative effects on brain function [72]. Thus, in a cross-sectional study of 129 men and women living in six villages on the Cuiaba River in Brazil, elevations in hair mercury concentrations were associated with reductions in motor speed, manual dexterity, and concentration [73]. Some aspects of verbal learning and memory were also impaired. The magnitude of these effects increased with increasing concentrations of mercury in hair. The brain functions disrupted in adults by methylmercury – attention span, fine-motor function, and verbal memory – are similar to those previously reported in children with prenatal exposures but appear to occur at substantially higher levels of exposure.\n\nCardiovascular Effects of Methylmercury Pollution\n\nElevated concentrations of methylmercury in blood and tissue samples are associated with increased risk for acute coronary events, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease [74]. The US National Research Council concluded in 2000 that methylmercury accumulation in the heart leads to blood pressure alterations and abnormal cardiac function [75].\n\nSubsequent research has strengthened these findings. An expert panel convened by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2011 concluded that methylmercury is directly linked to acute myocardial infarction and to increases in cardiovascular risk factors such as oxidative stress, atherosclerosis, decreased heart rate variability, and to a certain degree, hypertension [76]. Likewise, a 2017 systematic review found that methylmercury enhances production of free radicals resulting in a long-lasting range of effects on cardiac parasympathetic activity that increase risk for hypertension, myocardial infarction, and death [77]. Further research has confirmed these findings [78,79].\n\nThe Contribution of Marine Mercury Pollution to the Global Burden of Disease\n\nEfforts have begun to estimate the contribution of mercury pollution of the oceans to the global burden of disease (GBD). A recent estimate finds that between 317,000 and 637,000 babies are born in the United States each year with losses of cognitive function that are the consequence of prenatal exposures to methylmercury resulting from consumption of mercury-contaminated fish by their mothers during pregnancy. These losses range in magnitude from 0.2 to 5.13 IQ points depending on the severity of exposure. These authors found additionally that population-wide downward shifts in IQ caused by widespread exposure to methylmercury are associated with excess cases of mental retardation (IQ below 70), amounting to 3.2% (range: 0.2–5.4%) of all cases of mental retardation in the United States [80].\n\nImpacts of Ocean Acidification on Metals Toxicity\n\nThe alterations of carbonate chemistry in the seas – i.e. decrease in pH, decrease in [CO32–] and increase in [HCO3–]) – that are the consequences of increasing CO2 absorption induce changes in the speciation of metals that alter their solubility and bioavailability and therefore their toxicity [48,81].\n\nFor example, by 2100, the projected pH of the oceans will be approximately 7.7, resulting in a 115% increase in the mean free ionic form of copper (Cu2+) in certain estuaries [82]. Consequently, the biotoxicity of copper to invertebrates [83] and to plankton photosynthesis and productivity will be enhanced. At the same time, however, ocean acidification will increase the concentration of dissolved iron, which could partially alleviate the inhibitory effect of copper on photosynthesis [84]. Ocean acidification appears in some instances to mitigate [85] or even reduce [86] the toxicity of mercury. As metals may play a role in the biodegradation of organic pollutants, changes in metal speciation could slow these processes and therefore potentiate the toxicity of some organic pollutants [87].\n\nPrevention of Mercury Pollution\n\nEvidence has shown that two actions will be key to preventing further addition of mercury to the oceans. These are a cessation of coal combustion and reduction of mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). Cessation of coal combustion will not only slow the pace of climate change and reduce particulate air pollution, but will also greatly reduce atmospheric emissions of mercury and thus reduce additional deposition of mercury into the oceans. ASGM is a major source of mercury pollution of the oceans in the Global South. Actions underway under the aegis of the Minamata Convention are seeking to identify and control major sources of mercury pollution from ASGM [34].\n\nPlastic Pollution of the Oceans\n\nPlastic waste represents approximately 80% of all marine litter [88]. An estimated 10 million metric tons of plastics – range of estimate, 4.8 to 12.7 million – are released to the oceans each year [89]. The total amount of plastic waste circulating in the world’s oceans is projected to be 150 million tons by 2025 [89,90]. Marine plastic waste ranges in size from floating barrels, plastic bottles and plastic sheets down to sub-microscopic particles and fibers.\n\nRecent increases in marine plastic pollution reflect massive growth in plastic production (Figure ), which now exceeds 420 million tons per year. Much of this plastic goes into consumer products, and over 40% is used in products that are discarded within one year of purchase – often after only a single use [91]. The consequence is massive global accumulation of plastic waste [92].\n\nPlastics are produced by the polymerization of highly reactive and often toxic chemical monomers, 98% of them derived from fossil fuels. They are designed to be stable, durable and resistant to degradation [93]. Because of these properties, discarded plastic that reaches the marine environment can persist for decades and travel long distances. Plastic waste is now ubiquitous in surface waters, on the coasts, in estuaries, on the high seas, and even in the deepest and most remote parts of the ocean [94,95,96,97,98,99,100].\n\nSources of Plastic Pollution\n\nThe United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) [101] estimates that land-based sources account for up to 80% of the world’s marine pollution with 60–95% of this waste comprised plastic debris.\n\nRivers are a major source of plastic waste in the oceans, and riverine input is estimated to be between 1.15 and 2.41 metric tons per year, corresponding to between 9 and 50% of all plastic transported to the oceans. Rivers draining densely populated, rapidly developing coastal regions with weak waste collection systems are particularly important sources [102], and it is estimated that between 88–95% of marine plastic comes from only 10 rivers [103]. Largest inputs, accounting for approximately 86% of the plastic waste entering the marine environment, are from the coasts of Asia, mainly China [89,104]. Additional sources include aquaculture, fishing and shipping [27].\n\nPlastic wastes are gathered by oceanic currents and collect in five large, mid-ocean gyres located in the North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The North Pacific gyre is a relatively stationary area twice the size of France that has waste from across the North Pacific Ocean, including material from the coastal waters of North America and from Japan.\n\nMarine Pollution by Plastic Microparticles\n\nWeathering, mechanical abrasion, and photodegradation break plastic waste in the oceans down into smaller particles termed microplastics (<5 mm in diameter) and still smaller particles termed nanoplastics (<1μm in diameter; defined as <100 nm by some authors) [105,106,107]. The size distribution of ocean microplastics is highly skewed, with increasing numbers of particles at smaller particle sizes [108,109]. Microplastic particles can sink downward through the water column and accumulate on the ocean floor. In contrast to microplastics, which have been measured widely in the marine environment (e.g., Text Box 1) and in marine organisms, concentrations of nanoplastics are poorly defined [110,111,112,113,114,115].\n\nTEXT BOX 1: Microplastic contamination in Massachusetts beaches and blue mussels, Mytilus edulis.\n\nBackground. Microplastic particles have been increasing in prevalence in the oceans since the late 1900s and are found today on beaches across the world [101,182]. The majority are produced through weathering and fragmentation of larger macroplastics. Toxic and endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A may be incorporated into plastics during manufacture, and microplastics can also absorb toxic chemicals from seawater. Because of their small size, microplastics are easily absorbed by microscopic marine organisms and thus can enter the food chain where they bioconcentrate [101]. Current studies are examining the possible effects of microplastics on ecosystem dynamics and also on the health of humans who consume fish and shellfish.\n\nGoal. The two goals of this study were to examine (1) the physical characteristics, spatial distribution and abundance of microplastics on Massachusetts beaches, and (2) the characteristics of microplastics in wild blue mussels harvested in Massachusetts.\n\nMethods. Six Massachusetts beaches were targeted – beaches in and around Boston (high urban density) and in more remote areas (Provincetown, Cape Cod, low population density). Sediment samples were collected from representative beaches and microplastics were prepared by density separation [183]. Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) samples were collected from Provincetown. Samples were prepared following tissue digestion with concentrated KOH [184]. All samples were visualized by standard light microscopy and select samples were further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy.\n\nFindings. Microplastics were found in all beach samples examined and in most mussels screened. Microplastics in select blue mussel samples showed Raman spectra similar in appearance to those associated with polycarbonate plastics.\n\nConclusion. This study demonstrates that microplastics are ubiquitous on Massachusetts beaches and that they can enter the human food chain through consumption of blue mussels.\n\nFurther studies. Future studies are targeting additional beaches (including freshwater beaches) and examining species higher on the food chain (crustaceans and fish). Laboratory-based weathering studies are underway to examine the processes involved in microplastic generation. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster are examining the effects of off-the-shelf and laboratory-generated microplastic exposure via feeding on behavior, phenotype and gene expression.\n\nMicroplastics are also manufactured. They are produced in the form of microplastic beads – polystyrene spheres 0.5 to 500 μm in diameter. These beads are used in industrial processes such as 3D printing. They also have multiple applications in human and veterinary medical products to enhance drug delivery to tissues, and in cosmetics such as toothpaste, abrasive scrubbers and sunscreen. Manufactured microplastic beads are released to the environment from these products. They enter the oceans by way of urban runoff, sewage discharge, and direct wash-off of cosmetics and sunscreens from the skin of swimmers and surfers.\n\nMicroplastics degrade in the marine environment at varying rates depending on the core material and weathering conditions. Some petroleum-based plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade, although under some circumstances photochemical degradation can be significant [97,116,117].\n\nMicroplastic particles contain substantial quantities of toxic chemicals. Toxic chemical additives are incorporated into plastics during their manufacture to convey specific properties such as flexibility, UV protection, water repellence, or color [118,119,120,121,122]. These additives can comprise as much as 60% of the total weight of plastic products. They include plasticizers such as phthalates, brominated flame retardants, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, and pigments [106,123]. Due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, microplastic particles can also adsorb toxic chemical pollutants from the marine environment – polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, DDT, and toxic metals [106].\n\nSome plastic additives such as synthetic dyes, are classified as mutagens and carcinogens [124,125,126]. Others such as bisphenol A and phthalates are endocrine disruptors – chemicals that can mimic, block, or alter the actions of normal hormones. Perfluorinated additives, widely used in plastic to make them water-repellent, are deleterious to human reproduction. Still other plastic additives can reduce male fertility and damage the developing human brain [127,128]. Also of concern are residual unreacted monomers and toxic chemical catalysts that may be trapped in plastic during its manufacture.\n\nChemical additives and adsorbed chemicals can leach out of microplastic and nanoplastic particles. They can enter the tissues of marine organisms that ingest these particles, including species consumed by humans as seafood. Concentrations of some chemical additives have been found to be orders of magnitude higher in microplastic particles than in surrounding seawater [129].\n\nMarine Pollution by Plastic Microfibers and Tire-Wear Particles\n\nMicrofibers and tire-wear particles are distinct sub-categories of microplastics. Microfibers originate mainly from the clothing and textile industries [130,131,132]. Tire-wear particles are formed by the abrasion of car and truck tires. These materials reach surface waters and ultimately the oceans through runoff from roadways [133,134,135].\n\nPlastic microfibers are distributed globally in both water and air [129,136,137,138]. They have become ubiquitous in all ecosystems. They are found in seafood [139,140]. Humans can be exposed to microfibers through consumption of contaminated fish or shellfish. Inhalation of airborne microfibers may represent an even greater source of human exposure [141,142].\n\nEffects of Plastic Pollution on Marine Species\n\nElucidation of the toxicological impacts of microplastics, including microfibers, is challenging because of their heterogeneity and great complexity [106]. Microplastics span a wide range of sizes and shapes, they are comprised of various polymer materials, and as noted above they contain myriad chemical additives, the identity of which may be proprietary and therefore not generally known. Once in the marine environment, plastics undergo weathering and adsorb additional contaminants, further enhancing their complexity. Finally, marine species exhibit a range of sensitivity to microplastics [143]. All of these factors complicate assessments of toxicity and health hazard [144,145].\n\nAlthough there is evidence for transfer of additives and adsorbed chemicals from plastics to organisms, the relative contribution of plastics to total chemical exposure by all pathways is thought in most situations to be minor [146,147,148,149,150,151,152]. Likewise, although some additives and sorbed contaminants are able to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in aquatic food webs, there is not yet strong evidence that plastic particles themselves are able to undergo biomagnification [153].\n\nMicroplastics have potential to harm living organisms through several mechanisms:\n\nPhysical toxicity. Macroscopic plastic wastes, such as bottle caps, small bottles, and food packaging, can be ingested by fish, seabirds, and marine mammals that mistake them for food. Undigested plastic accumulates in these animals’ gastrointestinal tracts where it can cause obstruction that leads to malnutrition, reproductive impairment and death [129,154,155,156,157,158,159,160]. Marine species can also be harmed and killed by becoming entangled in abandoned fishing gear, plastic nets and plastic rings that are caught on reefs or drifting in the water column. An estimated 5.7% of all fishing nets, 8.6% of all traps, and 29% of all lines are lost each year [161,162].\n\nPlastic pollution is a threat to coral reefs [163]. Large plastic debris such as plastic bags and sheeting can smother coral colonies by preventing light from reaching the phototrophic organisms that build reefs and can also cause physical damage.\n\nParticle effects. Microplastics can harm living organisms by virtue of their ability to damage cells, injure tissues, and cause inflammation [164]. While microplastics cannot easily pass through cell membranes, nanoplastic particles can cross the gut lining and accumulate in tissues [165,166,167] where they may have the potential to cause deleterious effects [168]. Leachates containing tire-wear particles have been associated with storm water-associated mortality in salmon [169].\n\nChemical Toxicity. The toxic chemical additives and the sorbed pollutants in and on microplastics and nanoplastics can leach from plastic particles and enter the tissues of marine organisms [123,170,171,172]. Although plastic particles may not be a major source of chemical exposure [146,147,148,149,150,151,152], there is evidence that in some instances they can be significant contributors to chemical body burden [173].\n\nThe challenges associated with assessing the impacts of microplastics on marine organisms are evident in the divergent results of studies reported to date. A recent meta-analysis and review of published research on the effects of microplastics and macroplastics found similar numbers of positive and negative results [174]. A major conclusion from this and other reviews is that most of the experimental work to date has been done using concentrations of microplastics that are not environmentally relevant [144,174,175]. Future research should be conducted under more environmentally relevant conditions [174].\n\nMicroplastics as Vectors for Microbial Pathogens\n\nAn additional hazard of microplastic particles and fibers in the marine environment is that they can transport and shelter hazardous microorganisms, including vectors for human disease [176]. Pathogenic bacteria have been detected on sub-surface microplastics comprised of polyethylene fibers, in plastic-containing sea surface films, and in polypropylene fragments sampled in a coastal area of the Baltic Sea [177]. Similarly, E. coli and other potentially pathogenic species have been found on plastics in coastal waters [178] and on public beaches [179]. Algal species involved in HABs [180] and ciliates implicated in coral diseases [181] have also been found attached to marine microplastics.\n\nThese findings suggest that harmful microbes and algae that colonize plastics in the marine environment may use microplastic particles to expand their geographical range (‘hitch-hiking’). Adhesion to marine plastic may also enable pathogens to increase their anti-microbial resistance thus facilitating their spread to new areas where they may cause disease and death in previously unexposed populations [177].\n\nHuman Exposure to Plastic Pollution in the Oceans\n\nConsumption of contaminated fish and shellfish is a major route of human exposure to marine microplastics and their chemical contaminants [140,184,185]. Microplastic and nanoplastic particles are ingested by filter-feeders such as oysters and mussels that are then consumed by humans. Microplastic particles are found also in finfish that have consumed smaller organisms below them in the food web whose tissues are contaminated by microplastics and nanoplastics [123]. Greatest risks of human exposure are associated with consumption of small fish such as sardines that are eaten whole, including the gut [186]. The risk of microplastic ingestion may be especially great in fishing communities and in indigenous populations who rely heavily on seafood and marine mammals for their diet.\n\nA recent study based on assessment of commonly consumed food items estimates that an average person consumes between 74,000 and 121,000 microplastic particles per year [161]. Particle consumption varies by age, sex and diet. Microplastic particles have been detected in human stool samples with about 20 particles detected per 10g of stool, indicating that these particles can reach the human gut [187]. Ingestion of contaminated drinking water and inhalation of airborne microplastic fibers are additional sources of human exposure, and inhalation may be an especially important source [138,141].\n\nHuman Health Effects of Plastic Pollution in the Oceans\n\nThe risks that marine microplastics may pose to human health are not yet well understood and uncertainty about their potential hazard is high [125,186,188,189]. A recent review by SAPEA, an arm of the European Academies of Science, concluded that at present there is “no evidence of widespread risk to human health” of marine plastic pollution [124]. This report goes on to state, however, that as disposal of plastic waste into the oceans continues to increase and more knowledge becomes available, the assessment could change [125,126,128].\n\nProtection of human health against the potential hazards of marine plastic requires a precautionary approach. While current knowledge of health hazards is incomplete, there is sufficient information to justify urgent action to prevent the continuing discharge of plastic waste into the oceans [190,191].\n\nPollution of the Oceans by Manufactured Chemicals\n\nMore than 140,000 new chemicals have been invented and manufactured in the past 75 years. These synthetic chemicals are largely produced from fossil fuels – coal, oil, and increasingly, gas. Some are used in the manufacture of plastics. Others are incorporated into millions of consumer goods and industrial products ranging from foods and food packaging to clothing, building materials, motor fuels, cleaning compounds, pesticides, cosmetics, toys, and baby bottles [37].\n\nGlobal chemical manufacture is increasing by about 3.5% per year and is on track to double by 2045 (Figure ). More than 60% of current chemical production is in low- and middle-income countries [192], where health and environmental protections are often scant and waste disposal not well controlled.\n\nManufactured chemicals have become widely disseminated in the environment and are found today in the most remote reaches of the planet [193]. Humans are exposed to these chemicals. In national surveys conducted across the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measurable quantities of more than 200 manufactured chemicals are routinely detected in human tissues [194].\n\nThe majority of manufactured chemicals have never been tested for safety or toxicity. Their potential to damage ecosystems or harm human health is therefore not known. In most countries, manufactured chemicals are allowed to enter markets with little scrutiny. Some are found belatedly – sometimes only after years or even decades of use – to have caused damage to planetary support systems (Text Box 2), or injury to health. Examples include DDT, asbestos, tetraethyl lead, and the chlorofluorocarbons. Even less is known about the possible combined effects of exposures to mixtures of manufactured chemicals [1,2,34,195].\n\nThe thousands of manufactured chemicals that pollute the world’s oceans are variously classified by source (e.g. industrial), chemical structure (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]), intended use (e.g. pesticides; flame-retardants; pharmaceuticals), and environmental and biological properties (e.g., persistent, bioaccumulative), and by mode of toxicity (e.g., endocrine disruptors) [196]. Many are “legacy” pollutants, deposited in the seas over decades, while others are newly recognized.\n\nMajor Classes of Marine Chemical Pollutants\n\nHalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs): This group includes most of the chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The best-known members of the group are the polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls (PCBs and PBBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine (OC) pesticides such dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). These and other POPs are the focus of international efforts to restrict their production and use, such as the Stockholm Convention [199].\n\nPCBs are mixtures of related chemicals that are resistant to extreme temperature and pressure. In the past, PCBs were used widely in electrical capacitors and transformers, in hydraulic fluids, as heat transfer fluids, lubricants, and as plasticizers. Although production has been banned since the 1970s and 1980s, massive quantities are still present in electrical generators and capacitors and still larger amounts persist in the environment as legacy pollutants. PBBs and PBDEs have been used as flame retardants.\n\nDioxins, including the highly toxic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and furans are by-products formed in the synthesis of chlorinated industrial chemicals and formed also in the incineration of PCBs, polyvinyl plastics, and other manufactured chemicals containing halogens.\n\nAlthough the HAHs of greatest concern are manufactured chemicals, the marine environment is also a rich source of naturally occurring HAHs, including hydroxylated PBDEs, halogenated bipyrroles, and halogenated indoles [200].\n\nPerfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): This group contains hundreds of related compounds, all containing fluorine atoms on a carbon backbone. They are used in manufacture of a wide range of products, including non-stick cookware, stain-repellant carpets and furniture, water-repellent clothing, and firefighting foam. PFAS chemicals are highly persistent in the environment. They have caused extensive contamination of surface waters and groundwater, especially near airports and military bases where large quantities were used in firefighting foams. PFAS compounds have entered the oceans in substantial quantities and like other persistent chemicals have been incorporated into the marine food chain.\n\nOrganophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs): As the persistence and toxicity of first-generation flame retardants such as PBBs and then PBDEs became known, manufacturers turned to OPFRs, which have now also come to be contaminants in marine ecosystems.\n\nPolynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): These are multi-ring compounds that occur naturally in petroleum and oil products and also are generated as soot during incomplete combustion of organic material. Alkylated PAHs are common in petroleum.\n\nPesticides: The term ‘pesticides’ encompasses insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. These are a large and diverse group of manufactured chemicals designed to be toxic to target organisms (“pests”). Common classes of insecticides are organochlorines (e.g., DDT, and its metabolite DDE), organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids. Herbicides include phenoxyacetic acids (2,4-D and 2,4,5-T), atrazine, and glyphosate.\n\nOrganometals: Alkylated tin products, especially phenyltin compounds, were commonly used as antifouling agents added to marine paints used on the hulls of ships to prevent growth of barnacles.\n\nSpatial and Temporal Distribution of Marine Chemical Pollutants\n\nThe oceans are the ultimate sink for chemical pollutants, and persistent pollutants that enter the seas from land-based sources will stay in the oceans for years and even centuries [201].\n\nConcentrations of contaminants vary in different parts of the oceans. Therefore, tracking the levels, fate and geographic distribution of chemical pollutants is a fundamental prerequisite to predicting patterns of exposure, evaluating health effects, and designing evidence-based strategies for pollution control and disease prevention.\n\nWith the exception of crude oil, almost all of the chemical contaminants considered in this report originate on land and are transported to the ocean through atmospheric transport, river deposition, runoff, and direct discharges to the seas. In the oceans, pollutant concentrations are influenced by proximity to source, global transport patterns, and marine ecology. Highest concentrations tend to occur near population centers, industrial areas, and centers of industrialized agriculture such as concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFOs). Large-scale changes in ocean temperature and circulation induced by global climate change appear to be important drivers of pollutant distribution [202].\n\nAtmospheric transport is a major factor governing the movement of certain manufactured chemicals from land-based sources to the sea [203]. For example, several classes of persistent organohalogen compounds, such as PCBs and fluorinated compounds volatilize at equatorial and temporal latitudes, move poleward in the atmosphere, and then precipitate to land and in water in the cool air of the polar regions, a phenomenon termed “atmospheric distillation” [204,205]. The consequences are high concentrations of persistent pollutants in marine microorganisms in the circumpolar regions as well as in top predator fish species and marine mammals. Indigenous peoples in the far north who rely heavily on marine species for food are therefore placed at high risk of exposure to POPs.\n\nDirect dumping of industrial wastes into the sea is another source of pollution by toxic chemicals. For example, an estimated 336,000–504,000 barrels of acid sludge waste generated in the production of DDT have been dumped into the Southern California Bight [206]. The disposal process was sloppy and the contents of the barrels readily leaked leading to localized contamination. Once they are in the seas, chemical wastes can be further mobilized through natural or human-caused disturbances. For example, PCBs [207] in the Southern California Bight [206] have been mobilized by dredging of contaminated sediments from San Diego Bay.\n\nLeaching from plastic waste is another route by which toxic chemical pollutants can enter the seas. As was described in the preceding section of this report, a wide range of toxic chemicals can leach out of the 10 million tons of plastic waste deposited in the oceans each year. These manufactured chemicals can enter the marine food chain, thus potentially resulting in ecosystem effects and human exposure.\n\nGlobal efforts to reduce or eliminate pollution have resulted in some successes in control of ocean pollution, for example in reductions in PCBs and mercury in the seas surrounding Europe (EEA) [27,208]. In general, however, halogenated organic compounds, such as those governed by the Stockholm Convention, are highly resistant to degradation in the marine environment, and these persistent legacy pollutants remain widespread in marine environments.\n\nHuman Exposure to Marine Chemical Pollutants\n\nAn estimated 1–3 billion people depend on seafood as their principal source of dietary protein. Thus, contaminated seafood is the major route of human exposure to marine pollutants. The chemical pollutants most often identified in seafood are methylmercury, PCBs, dioxins, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated substances, and pesticides.\n\nFactors that influence concentrations of chemical pollutants in fish include geographic origin, fish age, fish size, and species. Geographic origin is a highly important determinant of pollutant load [209,210,211] and often outweighs the influence of other factors (Figure ). Thus, fish that live and are caught near cities and major points of pollutant discharge typically contain highly elevated concentrations of POPs and other chemicals [193].\n\nPredator fish species at the top of the food web generally accumulate higher concentrations of chemical pollutants than fish at lower trophic levels. Therefore, fish consumption advisories typically focus on limiting consumption of predator species. However, given the vast scale of the oceans and wide geographic variation in pollutant concentrations, it is perhaps not surprising that that these advisories do not always adequately protect consumers. For instance, one survey found that sardines, a species relatively low on the marine food web, can have higher concentrations of PCBs than cod or salmon [212].\n\nHuman Health Consequences of Marine Chemical Pollutants\n\nToxic chemical pollutants in the oceans have been shown capable of causing a wide range of diseases in humans. Toxicological and epidemiological studies document that toxic metals, POPs, dioxins [213], plastics chemicals, and pesticides can cause cardiovascular effects, developmental and neurobehavioral disorders, metabolic disease, endocrine disruption, and cancer (detailed references are provided in the following paragraphs). Effects in humans and laboratory animals are generally similar. Independent, systematic reviews undertaken by the US National Academy of Medicine and the International Agency for Research on Cancer confirm and validate these findings [214,215].\n\nAppendix Table in the Supplementary Appendix to this report summarizes the known links between exposures to toxic chemicals in the oceans and a range of human health outcomes. Key associations are the following:\n\nTable 1\n\nSpillYearDescriptionVLCC Metula Oil Spill, Chile1974A very large crude carrier hit a shoal in the Straits of Magellan and released nearly 200,000 tons of light Arabian crude oil.Amoco Cadiz Oil Spill, France1978A very large crude carrier clipped shallow rocks off the coast of Brittany. The resulting oil slick polluted 200 miles of the French coast and significantly harmed wildlife (mollusks, crustaceans, birds).Atlantic Empress Oil Spill, Trinidad1979Occurred 10 miles off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. An estimated 90 million gallons of oil were released into the Atlantic Ocean.Ixtoc Oil Spill, Mexico1979Spill occurred as a result of an explosion. 140 million gallons of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico.Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, Alaska, USA1989Released 37,000 metric tons of crude oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. Considered the worst oil spill worldwide in terms of environmental damage.Persian Gulf War Oil Spill1991Between 252 and 336 million gallons of oil were released into the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War.Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, Texas, USA2010134 million gallons of crude oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico following an explosion and fire on a drilling platform.Guarello Island, Patagonia, Chile201940,000 liters of diesel fuel released into the Straits of Magellan from a mining operation.\n\nCardiovascular disease. Multiple toxicological and epidemiologic studies indicate that PCBs, dioxins, PBDEs, OPs, OCs, PAHs and petroleum pollutants, can increase cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and atherosclerosis [216,217,218,219], and increase prevalence of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and heart failure. Powerful prospective cohort studies, such as the Nurses’ Health Study II and the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study [220] provide compelling evidence that POPs exposures in humans are associated with a broad range of cardiovascular conditions.\n\nDevelopmental defects: The core concept of developmental toxicity is that that exposures to extremely low doses of toxic chemicals during windows of exquisite vulnerability in early development can have devastating, potentially lifelong effects on health [221]. Genetic imprinting appears to be a mechanism by which toxic exposures during vulnerable periods injure health and increase risk of disease [222,223]. The Developmental Origin of Human Adult Diseases (DOHAD) hypothesis encapsulates this concept [224], and DOHAD is now recognized to be a widespread phenomenon that explains the toxicity of many manufactured chemicals [225,226]. Some developmental toxicants act by disrupting endocrine function while others directly damage developing organs such as the lungs and the brain.\n\nThe first well-described example of the unique susceptibility of infants and children to toxic chemicals in the environment was in the Minamata disaster in post-war Japan. In Minamata, prenatal exposures of human infants in utero to high concentrations of methylmercury in contaminated fish consumed by their mothers during pregnancy caused profound neurological impairment. The mothers, by contrast, sustained little or no physical toxicity [227].\n\nManufactured chemicals now recognized to be developmental toxicants include:\n\nPCBs and dioxins, which have been linked to neurological, behavioral, and metabolic effects [228,229] and also to reduced fetal growth and low birth weight [230].\n\nPBDEs, which have been linked to cognitive impairment in children [231].\n\nPhthalates, which are linked to reduced birth weight [232], behavioral abnormalities resembling attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), reproductive abnormalities in baby boys and decreased male fertility [233,234].\n\nBisphenol A, which is linked to behavioral disturbances in childhood [235].\n\nOrganophosphate compounds, which are associated with reduced head circumference at birth (a measure of delayed brain development), developmental delays, cognitive impairments, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [236,237,238].\n\nPerfluorinated compounds, such as PFOA and PFOS, which have been linked to decreased fetal growth [239,240], decreased birth weight, reduced head circumference in newborn infants and increased risk of ADHD [241]. Exposures to PFAS compounds are associated additionally with hepatic toxicity, increases in serum lipid levels, increased risk of thyroid disease, suppression of immune function [242], and decreased fertility [239,240,243].\n\np, p’-DDE, the principal metabolite of the insecticide, DDT, which affects birth weight [232].\n\nOrganotin compounds, used extensively in anti-fouling marine paints, have been linked to neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and renal toxicity as well as to ecosystem harm [244].\n\nDevelopmental neurotoxicity: The developing human brain is extremely sensitive to chemical toxicity. Damage done to the brain early in development can become evident at any point in infancy, in childhood, or later in life [245,246,247]. Systematic reviews have now linked early life exposures to several POPs and pesticides (e.g., OP pesticides) [248] to cognitive deficits, ADHD, and autism. Ongoing prospective cohort studies continue to identify new, previously unsuspected chemical causes of developmental neurotoxicity.\n\nAnalysis of NHANES data suggests that PBDE exposure in early life is a major contributor to the burden of intellectual disability in children, resulting in loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability [249] in the United States each year.\n\nPrenatal and adult exposures to PCBs are linked to a series of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes related to cognition – IQ loss and deficits in language, memory and learning – as well as to problems in attention, behavior, executive function, and social behavior. Early-life exposures to PCBs have been associated also with increased risk for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [215].\n\nThe consequences of developmental neurotoxicity in early life appear to persist across childhood and adolescence and even into adult life [250]. Thus, the association between prenatal PBDE exposure and attention problems persists at least to age seven years [251]. Likewise, early exposures to PCB 153, DDE, β-HCH, and PFOS are associated with hyperactivity up to at least age 13 years [241,252]. Postnatal exposures may also contribute to these effects and post-natal exposure to PCBs are linked to deficits in fine motor function in Inuit children at age 11 years [253].\n\nEndocrine disruption: An endocrine disruptor is defined as “an exogenous substance that causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, secondary to changes in endocrine function” [254]. A number of manufactured chemicals have been found capable of damaging human and ecosystem health through disruption of endocrine function. Chemicals or chemical mixtures can interfere with natural hormones by blocking, mimicking, or disrupting their actions in development, in maintenance of homeostasis and in physiologic function [128].\n\nMany POPs are EDCs. Because they are environmentally persistent, these chemicals can continue cause damage to living organisms for years or even decades after their release to the environment [255]. Two examples are DDE, the stable metabolite of DDT and PCBs. Both DDT and PCBs have been banned for several decades, but both are still identified in most human blood, milk, and adipose tissues as well as in top predator fish species and marine mammals.\n\nImmune toxicity: Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular dioxin and dioxin-like compounds have long been known to have harmful effects on the immune system in animals and humans, especially in the embryonic/developing stages [256,257,258]. Evidence suggests that these effects may persist into adolescence and adult life [259]. Some of the less highly persistent PAHs may also have immune effects [260]. Recent evidence indicates that PBDEs and PFAS also have negative effects on human immune function [261,262]. Thus, deficient vaccine antibody responses at age five years were associated with PFAS exposures prenatally and during early infancy [242]. Susceptibility to infectious diseases may also be increased.\n\nIncreased Risks of Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes: Consistent associations have been reported between several POPs and increased risk for diabetes and the metabolic disorder [263]. Altered lipid metabolism is another outcome linked to several POPs. A review of health effects linked to PFAS exposure identified dyslipidemia as the strongest metabolic outcome [262]. PCBs have been identified as possibly diabetogenic in the Nurses’ Health Study II [264]. A study in young adults examined changes in metabolism over a 23-year follow-up from exposure [265]. The findings suggest that PCBs and OCPs effects on glucose homeostasis may worsen after decades of exposure to background environmental levels.\n\nCarcinogenesis: Numerous toxicological and epidemiological studies have established that many PAHs are carcinogenic, and these studies have also elucidated many of the underlying biochemical mechanisms [266,267]. PAHs are proven human carcinogens and are linked to multiple human cancers, including lung cancer, skin cancer, and bladder cancer [268]. Rodent bioassays conducted by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) have concluded that PCBs and dioxins are carcinogenic. Occupational and military exposures to these compounds are linked to increased incidence rates of lymphatic cancers, especially Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), and also to diabetes [269]. Meta-analysis of results from the Yusho and Yu-Cheng cohorts report elevated lung, liver, and all cancers 30 to 40 years after prenatal poisoning by PCBs, chlorinated dioxins, and furans [270].\n\nMortality: Studies in the PIVUS cohort suggest that mortality due to CVD is associated with higher body burdens of POPs [220]. In the US NHANES survey, some organochlorine pesticides have been found to be associated with increased all-cause mortality and others with increased non-cancer, non-cardiovascular mortality [271]. Higher concentrations of POPs in plasma are associated with decreased survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [272]. Kim et al. found that an interaction between POPs concentrations and total body fat mass affected risk of mortality from chronic diseases [273]. Massive exposures in early life to PCBs, dioxins, and furans in the Yusho and Yu-Cheng episodes in Japan and Taiwan have been linked to increased risk of mortality from chronic diseases [273] and to elevated all-cause mortality [234,270].\n\nOcean Pollution by Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs)\n\nMore than 10,000 chemicals are used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). These products include therapeutic drugs with both medical and veterinary applications, cosmetics, and cleaning products. They are a subset of the manufactured chemicals discussed in the preceding section. Like pesticides, pharmaceuticals are specifically designed to have biological effects, and thus even low-dose exposures can affect living organisms, including humans.\n\nWith increasing manufacture and use of pharmaceuticals by a growing global population, pharmaceutical wastes have entered ecosystems in increasing quantities. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic manufacturing plants, hospitals, nursing homes, confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and aquaculture can all release PPCPs into wastewater systems, rivers, and eventually the oceans. Environmentally persistent pharmaceutical pollutants (EPPPs) have been recognized as a “new and emerging issue” under the United Nations’ Strategic Approach to the International Management of Chemicals (SAICM) since 2015.\n\nTherapeutic drugs commonly found in measurable quantities in urban wastewater and coastal waters include ibuprofen and other painkillers, anti-depressants, steroids, caffeine, estrogens and other hormone-containing products, anti-epileptics, cancer drugs, antimicrobials such as triclosan, and antibiotics [274,275,276,277]. Many pharmaceutical and cosmetic products in current use contain manufactured plastic nanoparticles [278].\n\nSome PPCPs have potential to accumulate in fish and shellfish species consumed by humans and thus have potential to affect human health [279]. Concern is growing that pharmaceutical chemicals and their metabolites can damage marine species through a range of toxicological mechanisms, including endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity. A recent case study suggests that the widely used sunscreen chemical, oxybenzone (benzophenone-3) may have toxic effects on the larval forms of several coral species [280]. The study reports that these effects include transformation of coral larvae from a motile state to a deformed, sessile condition; increased coral bleaching; leading to deformed skeleton formation; and DNA lesions.\n\nHazards of Combined Exposures to Multiple Chemical Pollutants\n\nManufactured chemicals are rarely present in the environment in isolation, but instead are found in complex mixtures. This complicates assessment of health impacts, because toxicological tests most often are conducted on one chemical at a time, thus potentially missing additive, antagonistic, or synergistic actions that could result from simultaneous exposures to mixtures of POPs and other manufactured chemicals that occur together in the oceans as “chemical cocktails” [281,282]. Future public health studies should pay additional attention to complex mixtures and cumulative risk assessment. The possibility of interaction among multiple POPs raises the question as to whether any one chemical that shows an association with disease is really acting a “proxy” for the combined effect of all the chemicals [283,284].\n\nConsideration of the susceptibility of exposed populations is also important. The safe limit for exposure at sensitive life stages of development, in utero or in nursing infants, will be lower than for adults. And in the adult population, underlying disease may modify risk. Finally, “safe” levels for one pollutant may not pertain to the combined risk from simultaneous exposure to the many pollutants to which a person may be exposed.\n\nBalancing Risks and Benefits of Exposure to Chemical Pollutants in the Oceans\n\nBecause of widespread pollution of the oceans by toxic metals and POPs and contamination by HAB toxins (discussed in the next section of this report), it is necessary to balance the risks of chemical pollutants in seafood against the benefits derived from nutrients unique to fish and shellfish. Thus, the benefits of essential fatty acids (EPA and DHA) in farmed and wild fish must be balanced against the risks for adverse health outcomes from chemical contaminants in those same fish [285,286].\n\nTo assess whether the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids in seafood may mitigate the adverse effects of methylmercury on brain development, IQ was measured in 282 school-age Inuit children in Arctic Québec whose umbilical cord blood samples had been analysed for mercury and DHA [287,288]. The investigators found that prenatal mercury exposure was associated with lower IQ after adjustment for potential confounding variables. Incorporation of DHA into the model significantly strengthened the association with mercury, supporting the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of DHA intake can at least partially offset the harmful effects of mercury [65].\n\nSimilarly, some studies have noted that the beneficial effect of fish consumption on the cardiovascular system appears to be reduced by co-exposure to PCBs [289]. The risk differential between wild and farmed salmon is a prime example of these concerns. While the abundance of omega-3 as well as omega-6 fatty acids differ between wild and farmed fish, both contain high levels of these beneficial compounds. However, farmed fish tend to have higher levels of PCBs and other contaminants than wild fish, and contaminant burdens differ between fish farmed in different parts of world. Determining risk of those contaminants depends in part on which outcome is considered, and whether the risk is from one or many chemicals.\n\nStudies comparing relative risk of cancer and other health outcomes associated with dioxin-like compounds in salmon concluded that consumption of farmed salmon would need to be limited to many fewer meals per month than for wild salmon, to reduce cancer risk to a level near the WHO “tolerable daily intake” for dioxin-like compounds [290,291].\n\nA review examining the health risks and benefits of seafood consumption and the impact of fish consumption on sustainability of fish stocks concluded that “few, if any, fish consumption patterns optimize all domains”, but called for development of “comprehensive advice … to describe the multiple impacts of fish consumption” [292]. Several groups have disseminated such guidance [293,294,295].\n\nChemical Pollutants in the Oceans and the Global Burden of Disease\n\nDespite extensive knowledge of the toxicology of many ocean pollutants, the contribution of chemical pollutants in the marine environment to the global burden of disease (GBD) is, with the exception of mercury [296,297], largely unknown. A major impediment to developing these estimates is that detailed, population-level studies of human exposures to ocean pollutants have not been conducted, although it is unarguable that fish and other seafood are a major source of human exposure. Moreover, POPs and other toxic chemicals that are found in terrestrial meat sources can in fact originate in the oceans, because fish meal, containing POPs, is often used in animal feeds [298].\n\nOil Spills\n\nCrude oil and petroleum products are complex mixtures of light and heavy hydrocarbons, toxic metals, and other chemicals. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a particularly hazardous component. When oil spills and leaks release these toxic chemicals into the marine environment, they can bioaccumulate in the food web; kill fish, birds and marine mammals; destroy commercial fisheries, aquaculture operations, and shellfish beds; release toxic volatile toxic chemicals such as benzene to the atmosphere; and foul shorelines.\n\nOil spills range in magnitude and visibility from massive releases such as the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico or the Amoco Cadiz Oil Spill off the coast of France down to chronic, slow leaks from pipelines and aging tankers. Petroleum in the marine environment can be either fresh or highly weathered, meaning that it has undergone a variety of chemical and photochemical processes that change its composition and toxicity.\n\nOil spills have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years as the result of growing global demand for petroleum. These spills have resulted in direct release of millions of tons of crude oil and other petroleum products into the oceans (Table , Figure ).\n\nEcosystem effects of oil spills include disruption of food sources, destruction of fragile habitats such as estuaries and coral reefs, and fouling of beaches [300]. Marine and coastal wildlife, including birds and mammals, can be exposed to petroleum-based pollutants through ingestion, absorption, and inhalation. Ingestion of these materials can lead to digestive problems, ulcers, and bleeding; kidney and liver damage; reproductive failure; and anemia. Inhalation can lead to lung problems [301] that appear to persist long after initial exposures [302]. Effects on immune systems of fish predispose them to infections [303]. PAHs contained in oil spills have been shown to cause DNA damage in marine species and have been associated with hepatic, pulmonary and cardiac lesions in Arctic seals [304,305,306,307].\n\nHuman health and well-being also can be seriously affected by oil spills. Heaviest exposures and the most severe health consequences occur among occupationally exposed populations such as oil industry workers and workers involved in cleanup efforts. Cohort studies suggest that respiratory effects may persist for 2+ years post spill in some responders [308]. DNA damage has been documented in cleanup workers [309,310]. Community residents can be exposed through consumption of contaminated seafood and inhalation of volatile petrochemicals. Some studies have suggested little long-term health risk for consumption of fish or shellfish after the Deep Water Horizon spill. However, assessments of the possible health hazards of abundant alkylated PAHs have not been included in such studies [311].\n\nIn addition to their effects on physical health, major oil spills, like other disasters, can have serious impacts on mental health. Populations in areas with lower income are often at heightened vulnerability to such effects [312]. There is need for cohort studies on resilience to disasters as well as on chemical stressors [312,313].\n\nBiological Contamination of the Oceans\n\nMany toxin-producing algae, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa are native to marine and estuarine environments. Other species can be introduced to the oceans as the result of human activity.\n\nMarine Algae and Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)\n\nAlgae, microscopic and macroscopic, are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They are the invaluable primary producers of fixed carbon, a vital nutrient that supports aquatic ecosystems, and of oxygen. Free-living planktonic algal species dominate the world’s oceans, and a small number of species account for the great majority of the global algal biomass. In coastal and estuarine systems, cyanobacteria, as well as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and cryptophytes emerge seasonally and are vital components of these ecosystems. Floating tropical beds of brown macroalgae (e.g., Sargassum) serve as habitats and nurseries for many marine species. They also sequester CO2 and thus mitigate global warming and ocean acidification [316,317].\n\nMarine microalgae are of great importance to human health and well-being not only because they support the marine food web upon which all commercial fisheries depend, but also because they provide food for aquaculture, produce a range of pharmaceutical compounds [14], and are potentially a source of renewable biofuels [318].\n\nOn the negative side, some algal species are noxious [319] and produce powerful toxins have potential to cause great harm [320]. When high densities of these species accumulate in an area of the ocean, they can form harmful algal blooms (HABs) – described as “red tides”, “green tides”, or “brown tides”. In these blooms, the great masses of algae that have accumulated in an area of the sea exhaust inorganic nutrients in the water column allowing bacteria move in and decompose the senescing organic material. The consequences are reduced dissolved oxygen in the ocean, dead zones, fish kills, and a broad range of adverse ecological impacts [321,322,323] (Figure ).\n\nHABs directly harm human health by producing toxins, potent natural compounds that can cause disease and death, most commonly through consumption of contaminated seafood [32,323,324,325,326].\n\nCauses and Drivers of HAB Events\n\nHABs are not a new phenomenon and some occur naturally. However, the frequency and magnitude of HAB events appears to be increasing [328]. These increases have been linked to three factors:\n\nIncreasing pollution of the oceans, and especially of coastal waters by nitrogen and phosphorus which leads to eutrophication. Sources of nitrogen include agricultural runoff, septic tank leachate and effluent from municipal deep injection wells [329,330,331];\n\nSea surface warming; and\n\nOcean acidification.\n\nIncreases in frequency and severity of HAB events have been linked to increasing coastal pollution in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan in the mid-1970s [332] and in the northwestern Black Sea in the 1970s and 1980s [333]. Both of these situations have subsequently been remediated, and case studies describing these and other successful remediation efforts are presented in the section of this report on Successes in Prevention and Control of Ocean Pollution [334].\n\nA current example of the effect of increasing coastal pollution on HAB frequency is seen at the mouth of the Changjiang River in China, where nitrate concentrations have increased four-fold in the past 40 years and phosphate concentrations have increased by 30%. The main drivers are increases in population size and agricultural production. Significant increases in algal biomass and a change in the composition of the phytoplankton community have resulted. The frequency of local HABs has increased dramatically [335].\n\nClimate Change and HABs\n\nIncreases in the frequency and severity of HABs have been linked to changing weather patterns such as major warming events, increased runoff, and changes in ocean currents (Figure ). Examples include recent Alexandrium blooms in the northeastern United States [336] and massive blooms of Pseudonitzschia on the US west coast associated with a mesoscale warm-water anomaly termed “the blob” [337]. These events presage projected future climate scenarios [54,338,339].\n\nSea surface warming leads to range extensions of HAB species and to the appearance of algal toxins in previously unaffected areas [53,55,340,341,342,342]. An example is seen in the recent, first ever detection of HAB toxins in Arctic waters [343]. The movement of harmful algae into the Arctic coupled with northern indigenous peoples’ lack of experience with HAB toxins put these populations at high risk of exposure and disease. This risk is compounded by lack of knowledge about uptake of HAB toxins by species such as whales, walruses, seals, and seabirds used by northern indigenous people as food sources.\n\nAnother example of climate-driven change in HAB range that has already occurred is poleward extension in the geographic ranges of the benthic dinoflagellates responsible for ciguatera poisoning into warm-temperate habitats, for example from the Caribbean Sea northward into the Gulf of Mexico [55,342,344]. This range extension appears to be associated with warming sea surface temperatures and higher storm frequencies, and destruction of coral reefs [345,346,347,348,349]. It is reflected in increased numbers of calls about ciguatera poisoning to poison control centers in the United States.\n\nAn impact on HAB biology that appears to reflect synergy between global climate change and ocean acidification is the observation that HAB toxins can become more potent at higher temperatures or under more acidic conditions [350,351]. This change may reflect temperature-induced shifts in the relative abundance of dinoflagellate species [340,352,353].\n\nPathways of Human Exposure to HAB Toxins\n\nConsumption of fish and shellfish that have ingested toxic algae is a major route of human exposure to HAB toxins. Filter-feeding shellfish such as oysters and mussels pose an especially high risk because these species ingest toxic algae and then accumulate algal toxins to high concentrations that can cause acute disease and sudden death in shellfish eaters. The poisoning syndromes caused by HABs in shellfish include paralytic, neurotoxic, amnesic, diarrhetic, and other gastrointestinal poisoning [354,355]. Consumption of finfish and shellfish containing ciguatera toxin may also result in ciguatera poisoning.\n\nHuman exposure to HAB toxins can also occur through skin or respiratory contact via swimming or visiting beaches during algal blooms. People have reported skin rashes, respiratory irritation such as sneezing, and a burning or itching in the nose or throat while swimming, visiting, or working at the beach during Karenia brevis red tide events [356,357]. People with asthma appear to be at particular risk [358]. Karenia brevis blooms are associated additionally with increases in emergency room admissions for respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic illnesses [359,360,361]. There is evidence that people experience adverse effects also during Sargassum blooms [362] and from exposures to algal-derived palytoxins [363].\n\nMacroalgal blooms, can harm human health by causing massive accumulations of algae in bays and on beaches. When these piles of algae decompose, they can release foul-smelling and hazardous gases, including hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptans, and dimethyl sulfide [364]. Coastal populations exposed to decomposing algal mats have reported eye and respiratory tract irritation.\n\nSyndromes Associated with HAB Toxins\n\nHABs cause a variety of human diseases, some of them extremely serious (Text Box 3). HAB-related illnesses are for the most part acute, and acute reference doses (ARfD) have been derived to protect the public against these acute exposure events (See Appendix Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Little research has been done to evaluate chronic illness after either acute or chronic exposures to HAB toxins, and information on long-term health effects is still insufficient to allow determination of tolerable long-term daily intakes (EFSA opinions or FAO/WHO/IOC ad hoc expert consultation).\n\nTEXT BOX 2: Chemical Pollution of the Oceans and Reduced Generation of Oxygen.\n\nA novel mechanism by which petrochemical pollutants in the oceans may endanger human and ecosystem health is through reducing production of oxygen [197]. Beneficial marine microorganisms such as cyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus are major producers of oxygen. Through photosynthesis, the billions of these organisms in the earth’s oceans remove CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it to oxygen.\n\nRecent experimental findings from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans have found that mixtures of POPs and aromatic hydrocarbons in seawater at concentrations only two times above usual background levels can reduce expression of photosynthetic genes in Prochlorococcus and thus impede oxygen generation [6,198]. The photosynthetic toxicity of pollutant mixtures exceeds that of single chemicals by as much as three orders of magnitude [5].\n\nTEXT BOX 3: A Primer on Poisonings by HAB Toxins.\n\nConsumption of contaminated seafood is the major route of human exposure to HAB toxins. Many thousands of poisoning episodes occur worldwide each year.\n\nParalytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) is caused by saxitoxins (STX), potent neurotoxins that act on voltage-gated sodium channels as well on other nervous system receptors [366,367]. PSP typically begins with tingling sensations or numbness of face, neck, fingers, and toes. These symptoms progress within 30 minutes to weakness, limb incoordination, and respiratory difficulty. In severe cases, respiratory paralysis, cardiovascular shock, and death may ensue. There is no antidote to PSP, and the only available treatment consists of artificial respiration by ventilator [368,369] and removal of non-absorbed toxins from the gut with activated charcoal. STX is listed as a Schedule 1 chemical intoxicant by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) [370]. The lethal oral dose is 1–4 mg [371].\n\nAmnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is caused by domoic acid (DA), a potent toxin produced by planktonic diatoms that targets glutamate receptors in the central nervous system [372,373]. After initial gastrointestinal symptoms, affected persons develop confusion, lethargy, disorientation, and short-term memory loss. Severe cases evolve to coma. Deaths have occurred [368,369]. A persistent toxicity syndrome has been defined consisting of episodic seizures and permanent loss of spatial memory [374].\n\nDiarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is associated with exposures to okadaic acid and dinophysis toxins. The syndrome presents with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Symptoms may be confused with infectious intestinal diseases"
