Contact our Tijuana practice today.\n\n(619) 484-9903\n\nRoux-en-Y is a laparoscopic surgical technique named after César Roux, the surgeon who first presented it. Dr. Edward Mason and Dr. Chikashi completed the first bariatric surgery using the Roux-en-Y method, a gastric bypass. During a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, your bariatric surgeon will create a small stomach pouch from the top portion of your stomach. The small stomach pouch will be connected to a portion of your small intestine called the \"Roux limb\". This Roux limb bypasses the remaining larger stomach portion and much of your small intestine, allowing this surgery to be restrictive and mal-absorptive.\n\nGastric sleeve surgery is a restrictive weight loss surgery. During gastric sleeve surgery, your surgeon will separate your stomach into two portions; one large and one small. The large portion will be removed and you will be left with a stomach a fraction of the size. This allows you to eat less and still feel full.\n\nIf you've been thinking about bariatric surgery, we invite you to reach out to our wonderful team. Dr. Sandy Martinez is welcoming patients from the United States, Canada, and beyond to her practice in Tijuana, Mexico.
