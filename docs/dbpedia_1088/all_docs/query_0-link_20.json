        "text": "By JOE McFARLAND\n\nWe can’t put our fingers on the reason why, but apparently banana yellow was the “in” colour for baseball cards in 1991.\n\nThe sheer mention of yellow baseball cards conjures up many emotions for junk wax collectors, as they think back to the infamous 1991 Fleer set. But they weren’t the only ones to get in on the action.\n\nProCards created over 4,300 minor league cards that year, all with the same design in mind. The front features a player’s photo on top of a yellow notepad graphic and a green block with the player’s name, position and team. The backs of the cards have more of that yellow, with biographical information, limited statistics and, in the case of the Blue Jays, a sponsor logo for Monarch Cable TV.\n\nHey The team itself didn’t have the best season on the field or at the turnstiles. They mustered a 24-45 record, finishing last in the Pioneer League’s North Division, just a couple of wins out of being in the league basement. And their attendance mark of 14,722 ranked them last in that department.\n\nA handful of players featured in this card set made it to the big leagues, including 1990 third round pick Felipe Crespo. And while none hit superstar status, a couple inadvertently had a major impact on the parent Blue Jays squad heading into the next couple of seasons.\n\nHere now is a our latest In The Cards feature and some of the stories of the 1991 Medicine Hat Blue Jays.\n\nAs always, thanks so much for flipping through these collectibles! We hope you’re enjoying this series and would love to hear about some of your stories and memories of the cards or the players. Leave us a comment below.\n\nWe are continuing to work on an online digital archive of Alberta baseball card sets with our In The Cards series. If you have any cards you’d like to share with us, email AlbertaDugoutStories@gmail.com with more information!\n\nprint\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
