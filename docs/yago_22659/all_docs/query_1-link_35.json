        "text": "Adeline Horsey Recollections. The Count had no choice but to accept my decision, and one day Lord Stradbroke, Lord Combermere, and Don Francisco Merry came to interview me about my broken engagement. They brought with them a document, in which I definitely resigned all idea of marrying the Count de Montemolin (age 29), which they asked me to sign in their presence. I did so, and at the same time I gave them all my Royal admirer's love-letters, except those now published for the first time to prove the truth of what might otherwise be deemed a romantic fabrication.\n\nSo ended what I may term a very interesting episode. After I had signed the important document which is now deposited in the Royal Archives of Spain, the Count Montemolin (age 29) passed completely out of my life; he married a Royal Princess in the early 'fifties, and in 1854 the miserable King Consort of Isabella, Francisco, entered into negotiations with Montemolin (age 29) for a reconciliation, in order that the united family might overthrow the Liberal Ministry that then ruled Spain. This extraordinary intrigue of Isabella (age 17) and her husband to overthrow their own government was based upon their abdication, the recognition of Montemolin (age 29) as King, and the marriage of the son of the latter (if he had one) to the only child of the Queen, the Infanta Isabella, who still lives. The intrigue was delayed by the clever management of the old Queen Christina, Isabella's mother, and the rise of the Conservative party to power in 1856 made Isabella (age 17) and her husband less anxious for it; but still a close understanding was kept up, and Montemolin (age 29) was for a time as powerful in Spain as the Queen herself. The strange conduct and bad morals of Isabella greatly strengthened Montemolin's party, and he soon began to think that he could get the throne on his own account without any understanding with the Queen and her husband. After long plotting with his adherents, and gaining the support of several generals in command of troops, Montemolin (age 29) determined to strike his blow in 1859. (Isabella (age 17) had a son now which quite altered the position.) In April 1859, Montemolin (age 29) and his brother Fernando, with some adherents, landed near Valencia, supported by an army of 3600 men under the Governor of Majorca, General Ortega. The affair missed fire, the troops had no love for Carlism and refused to follow. Ortega fled, was captured and shot, whilst Montemolin (age 29) and his brother, after hiding for some days, were driven by hunger to surrender. Their lives were spared, but they were to swear to renounce for ever their claims to the throne. As soon as this was known, the other brother, Don Juan (age 25), who lived in London, issued a manifesto asserting his rights, and to some extent accepting Liberalism. Montemolin (age 29), as soon as he arrived at Trieste, where he lived, withdrew his renunciation and repudiated his brother's claims. This caused a split in the party that only ended with the death of Montemolin (age 29) and his brother in the following year.\n\nI remember Lord Cardigan telling me that their deaths were attributed to poison, but as fever was given out as being the cause, the real solution of the mystery will never be known.\n\nAdeline Horsey Recollections. The following announcement which appeared in the Morning Post caused, needless to say, something of a stir in Society. Some people thought I was a very fortunate girl to secure so great a parti, and others - who were jealous - prophesied disaster \"through vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself\".\n\nWe are enabled to state that a marriage of more than common interest even from a political point of view has been agreed upon between a fair countrywoman of our own and one of the Royal personages who have had occasion to seek refuge in Great Britain. The Count de Montemolin (age 29) has offered his hand to Miss de Horsey (age 23), the accomplished daughter of Spencer de Horsey (age 58), Esq, and the marriage will shortly be solemnised in this country. It is understood that a negotiation has been opened by the Prince with the government of the Queen of Spain (age 17), which has consented to make an adequate provision for his Royal Highness and his bride, in consideration of the renunciation of the claims to the throne, of the male line of which the Count de Montemolin is the representative.\n\nI was introduced to all my future husband's relations who were in England, and I was very charmed with the Archduchess Beatrix, and the Princess Beatrix of Modena, who had married the Count's younger brother, Don Juan (age 25). They lived in Bayswater at the time, and I remember going with my father to see her, and greatly admiring her lovely black-eyed baby boy, who in after-life was to be known as Don Carlos.\n\nThe Count's letter inviting me to visit his sister-in-law is interesting, as it shows how completely our engagement was sanctioned by his family.\n\nBeloved of my soul, - I told Beatrice yesterday that you will go to-morrow at half-past two to see her. She told me that she would have much pleasure, but that probably the Duchess of Parma would be there, but that there would be no obstacle if you have no objection. In any case, answer me, because if by chance you do not wish to go to-morrow I should like to know it, so that in that case to have the pleasure of going to see you at your house, for I cannot endure to be so lone a time deprived of the pleasant sight of you, for this is my only consolation. Good-bye, beloved of my life and of my soul. Do not doubt for a single instant my constant love.\n\nCarlos Luis Maria de Borbon.\n\nAdeline Horsey Recollections. On September 28, 1858, my marriage took place at the Military Chapel Gibraltar, and I was the first Countess of Cardigan to be married on foreign soil, I wore a white silk gown draped with a blue scarf, and a large hat adorned with many feathers; Lord Cardigan's (age 60) friends, Stuart Paget, Mrs, Paget and the Misses Paget, were present, and we gave a ball on the yacht in the evening. We spent a very gay week at Gibraltar, and then left for Cádiz, touching at Malacca and Alicante; then we took rail to Madrid, where we arrived on October 16 in time to witness a review of 30,000 troops on Queen Isabella's (age 27) birthday. After a short stay at Madrid we rejoined the Airedale at Barcelona, and went 500 miles by sea to Leghorn. We experienced bad weather and many storms, and every one on board was ill except myself. The cook was a great sufferer, and his absence was naturally felt by those who were able to look at food without aversion.\n\nFrom Leghorn we went to Elba, when I saw the place Napoleon embarked from after the \"hundred days\". We left the Airedale at Civiti Vecchia and started for Rome in our travelling-carriage with six horses, escorted by some of the Papal Guard sent by the Pope to protect us. I met many of my friends in the Eternal City; I saw everything worth seeing during my delightful sojourn there, and before we left Lord Cardigan and I were blessed by the Pope at an audience we had with his Holiness. As I wished to go to Genoa by sea, we returned to Civita Vecchia and set out in the yacht for Genoa, where we landed; we went from there to Turin, and on by rail by the Mont Cenis route to Paris [Map].\n\nParis was then a city of delight, revelling in the palmy days of the Second Empire, and I greatly enjoyed my visit there. One night I went to the Opera with Cardigan and we saw Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Trelawney in a box. Mrs. Trelawney was the famous Miss Howard, once the English mistress of Louis Napoleon (age 50), who paid her £250,000 when he renounced her to marry Eugenie de Montijo (age 32). Mrs. Trelawney annoyed the Emperor (age 50) and Empress (age 32) as much as she dared by sitting opposite the Royal box at the Opera, and driving almost immediately behind the Empress's (age 32) carriage in the Bois de Boulogne. She was a very fat woman, and her embonpoint increased to such an extent that the doors of her carriage had to be enlarged to allow her to get in and out with comfort.\n\nClarence Trelawney was a friend of mine, and the poor fellow came to a sad end. After his wife's death he married an American lady, but unfortunately he got into debt. He appealed to his relations, who were very wealthy but apparently equally mean, for they refused to lend him the £400 he asked for, and driven desperate by worry he blew out his brains.\n\nFrom Paris we came to London and stayed at Lord Cardigan's town-house in Portman Square Marylebone; then we went to Deene [Map] on December 14, where we met with a royal reception, six hundred tenants on horseback escorting our carriage from the station to the house."
