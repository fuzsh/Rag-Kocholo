        "text": "15 Feb.\n\nS. E. C. d. C. L. 1. & 2. 163. 165. 80. Christopher Columbus to the Escribano De Racion, Of The Islands In The Indies. (fn. 1)\n\nPraises God for the signal triumph he has vouchsafed to him in his great enterprise. Has discovered numerous islands inhabited by people without number. Has taken possession of them all, with sound of trumpet, and the Royal banners displayed, without any opposition.\n\nGave the first island the name of San Salvador, in commemoration of the mighty Lord who has bestowed all this, according to His wondrous working. The Indians call this island Guanabam. Galled the second island Santa Maria de Concepcion ; the third, Ferdinanda ; the fourth, Isabella ; the fifth, Juana, &c. Coasted along the island Juana towards the west. It was so large that he imagined it to be the main land of Cathay. Did not find cities and towns near the coast, but only small hamlets, with the inhabitants of which he could have no intercourse, for they fled as soon as he approached. Continued his voyage, thinking he would not miss large towns. At last, after he had sailed a great number of leagues, found that the coast trended to the north. Did not wish to go towards the north, because winter was at hand. Moreover, the wind was contrary. Turned, therefore, again towards the south, and proceeded to a certain point where he sent two men ashore in order to find out whether there was a king or any great towns there. They made a three days' journey, and found an indescribable number of hamlets, and multitudes of people, but no government. They therefore returned. Heard very soon from Indians, whom he had already taken, that the land before him was an island.\n\nCoasted now one hundred and seven leagues towards the east.\n\nEighteen leagues distant from the former island there was another island lying east, and which he called Hispañiola. Coasted along that island, towards the north, one hundred and seventy-eight leagues in a direct line.\n\nThis and the other islands are all very large, and have a great number of harbours, which are better than any other harbours with which he is acquainted in Christendom. There are such good and large rivers that it is a wonder to see them. The land is high, and there are many mountains and high mountain ranges, all veiy beautiful, and of a thousand different forms, all accessible, and covered with trees of innumerable different kinds. The trees are so high that they seem to reach the sky, and it is said that they never lose their leaves. Believes it is the fact, because he found them as fresh and green and beautiful as they are during the month of May in Spain. Some were in flower, some bearing fruit, and some again in bud, others bearing fruit, as yet unripe, according to their nature. The nightingale and a thousand other species of birds were singing in the middle of November. There are palm trees of six or eight kinds, which are admirable in their beautiful deformity. There are also pine forests. There were very large open fields. There are beasts and large birds. There are fruits and vegetables. There are mines of metals. The island of Hispañiola, with its mountains and plains and fields, is perfectly beautiful. The soil is rich, and well adapted for fruit and vegetables. The timber is excellent for building houses and towns, and the ports are on such a magnificent scale as is difficult to believe without seeing them. There are many rivers of excellent water ; gold is carried down by most of them. The trees and vegetable and plants are very different from those on the island of Juana. There are many rich mines of gold and other metals.\n\nThe people of this island, and of all the others which he has seen and heard of, walk about naked, just as when they were born. Some of them cover themselves a little with leaves, or with some cotton. They do not possess any iron or steel, or any arms ; nor are they well calculated for the use of arms. Nob that they are badly formed ; on the contrary, they have fine figures ; but they are very timid. The only weapons they have are reeds, which are cut when the seed is ripe. They insert into the end of them a small piece of sharp wood. But they do not dare to use even these weapons. Has often sent two or three men to a hamlet, in order to speak to the inhabitants, who cams out in great multitudes, but fled in such a way that neither father nor son took heed of one another, as soon as they saw the white men approaching. They had not been ill treated ; on the contrary, had given those whom he could get near, all kinds of things which he had, clothing as well as other things, without asking any equivalent from them. They are timid by nature. It is true that they lose their timorousness as soon as they become accustomed to the white men. They are not false, and are very liberal. When asked for anything which they have, they never say, No ; on the contrary, they offer all they have, and show so much love that they would willingly give their hearts. Whether it be a thing of great value or nothing worth which is given them, they are equally contented. Had forbidden his men to give them vile things, such, for instance, as pieces of broken glass, broken needles, and so on. It is true, if they could get them they would think they had obtained possession of the finest jewels in the world. One sailor got gold of the weight of two castillanos and a half for one needle. Others had given things of even less worth, and had received in return great quantities of fruit. For the smallest coin, if it were only new and shining, they gave all they had, even great quantities of gold. For broken iron hoops of casks they gave all their property, cattle, and whatever they possessed. Thought it was wrong to cheat them. Gave them a hundred different nice things in order that they might be the more easily disposed to become good Christians and devoted subjects of the King and Queen of Spain, and that they might love the whole Castilian nation. Had done this also that they might give him all that was necessary for the voyage.\n\nThey do not profess any kind of idolatry. They only believe that \"the good, the power, and the might is in Heaven.\" They were firmly persuaded that Columbus and the ships had come from Heaven. Was received as a messenger from Heaven in all places where they had had any intercourse with the natives. The reason of their belief was not because they are stupid ; on the contrary, they are very subtle ; they navigate all the adjacent seas, and the information they give is wonderfully exact. The reason of their belief was simply because they had never before beheld men who wore clothing. Moreover, they had never seen ships. Directly after his arrival in the Indies he took some Indians by force, in order that their fear of them might be dispelled, and that they might give him information about the islands. They very soon became able to make themselves understood, and to understand the Spaniards, by means of words and of signs. They had been of great advantage to him. Is still carrying them about with him, and they still believe that the Spaniards have come from Heaven, in spite of all the conversations he has had with them. When he arrived at a new place, the Indians immediately told the natives that the men from Heaven were there. As soon as that was known, the people ran from house to house to announce the news, and they all came skipping and jumping from all sides to see the men from Heaven. Neither small nor great remained at home. Every one of them brought presents of something to eat, and gave them with wonderful love.\n\nThey have, all of them, a great number of canoes, like the Spanish fustas ; some are larger, and Rome smaller. The largest are quite equal in size to fustas of eighteen benches. They would be even larger if they were not all made out of one piece of timber. They go much quicker than the Spanish fustas. Has seen canoes with sixty and eighty oarsmen.\n\nHas not observed any great difference in the appearance and the customs of the natives on the various islands. They all understand one another ; a circumstance which is very favourable for their conversion to the Holy Faith, to which they are much inclined.\n\nThe island of Juana seems to be larger than England and Scotland put together. Has sailed along the coast for sixty leagues, and yet there remained two large provinces, which he has not seen, which cannot contain less than fifty or sixty leagues in length. One of the provinces is called Cavan. Men having tails are born there. Hispañiola, according to the reports of the Indians, is larger than the whole of Spain from Coluga to Fuentarabia. Believes it, because he coasted along the island for an extent of one hundred and thirty-eight leagues. It is so beautiful that it is much to be desired, and, when once seen, never to be left.\n\nHas taken possession of all the islands in the name of Ferdinand and Isabella, who can dispose of them as absolutely as of the kingdom of Castile.\n\nHas taken possession of a place in the island of Hispañiola, which is very well situated for commerce with the continent, and with the Grand Khan. Has baptized the town Navidad. Has fortified it. The fortification is being finished at the present moment. Has left a garrison there, artillery, and provisions for more than a year, and a boat with sailors. Has made the King his best friend, so that he is very proud of the settlement. But even should the natives change their minds, they would be unable to do any harm to the garrison. The King and his people walk about naked, and have no arms. The garrison would suffice to destroy the whole island. It seems as if all the men were contented with one wife, but they allow their King to have as many as twenty wives. The women appear to work more than the men. It seems that they have no property of their own. What one possesses they all possess, especially with respect to eatables.\n\nHas not found monstrosities among the men, as many have reported there were ; on the contrary, they are all very handsome. They are not negroes, as in Guinea ; nothing but their hair is black. During the daytime they shut themselves up, and are not brought up in places exposed to the rays of the sun, which are here immensely powerful. That the sun is so powerful is not to be wondered at, as these islands are only twenty-six degrees distant from the line. In such islands as have high mountains the winter is rather severe, but the natives are accustomed to it.\n\nThe natives of the second island are believed by the others to be very ferocious. They eat raw flesh. They possess a great number of canoes, in which they go to all the other islands in order to rob and steal whatever they can get. They are not monsters in appearance ; they only wear long hair like the women. They use bows and arrows of reeds, with a little stick inserted in the head. They are both ferocious and mean when they have to deal with the other Indians. Thinks no higher of their courage than he does of that of the others. They contract matrimony with the women of the first island, in which there is not a single man. These women do not work, but they use bows and arrows. They cover themselves with wire [one word unintelligible] of which they have a great number.\n\nThere is another island larger than Hispañiola. The inhabitants are said to have no hair. There is gold in immense quantities. Brings some Indians from there, and from other islands, in order to bear witness.\n\nTo judge only from what he has seen in this expedition, made in great haste, it is clear that he is able to give to the King and Queen of Spain as much gold as they want, provided he receives a little assistance, and as much as the ships can contain of cotton and spice and mastics. Mastics have hitherto been found only in Greece, in the island of Chios. The seignoria have sold it at their own prices. Moreover, there are fine qualities of timber, and in great quantities. Slaves might be exported to any extent which might be wanted ; that is to say, from amongst the idolators. Thinks he has also found rhubarb and cinnamon, and would have found other valuable things if he had had more time. Had remained nowhere when the wind was favourable for sailing. Would have done much more if the ships had been better.\n\nGod gives victory to all those who walk in His paths, as is clear in this case. Has now found and seen the islands of which so many fables have been told. Next to God, he is most indebted to the King and Queen of Spain. The discovery is so great that the whole of Christendom ought to keep festival and praise the Holy Trinity.\n\nAn immense number of people will be converted to the Christian Faith. Moreover, great material gains will be obtained.\n\nOn the 2nd, they had frost and hail storms in the Canary Islands.—Calavera, on the Canary Islands, 15th February.\n\nP.S.—Encountered such a storm on the Spanish seas that he was obliged to lighten the ships by throwing the cargo overboard. Had been fortunate enough to gain the port of Lisbon. Will write to the King and Queen of Castile.— 14th March.\n\nIndorsed : \"This letter was sent by Columbus to the Escribano de Racion, of the Indies. Another letter came for the King and the Queen.\"\n\nSpanish. Contemporaneous copy. pp. 22.\n\n[This letter was discovered by Don Thomas Gonsales in the attics of the archives of Simancas, on the 12th of September 1818, when he was occupied in putting in order the documents returned from France.]"
