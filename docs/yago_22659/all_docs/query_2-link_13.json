        "text": "So, after posting on the Kings of France and England, here's a list of the Kings and Queens of Spain which, it has to be said, is a pretty complicated and tumultuous list.\n\nTHE HOUSE OF TRASTAMARA AND THE ORIGINS OF THE SPANISH KINGDOM\n\nSpain was first unified by the marriage of FERDINAND AND ISABELLA, who pursued the military unification of Spain after their marriage in 1474. However, it was not until 1556 that Spain truly came to be ruled as a single monarchy and between 1474 and 1556, it technically remained a dual monarchy, with power being shared between whichever members of the royal house inherited power in Aragon and Castile, the two kingdoms first united by Ferdinand and Isabella.\n\nFERDINAND II, sometimes known as Ferdinand the Catholic, was Ferdinand V in Castile. He was King of Aragon, Sicily, the Naples and Sardinia. He was styled King Ferdinand V of Castile jure uxoris between 1474 and 1503. He ruled as his wife's partner from 1474 to 1479 and then they co-ruled Spain together between 1479 and 1503. He was married to ISABELLA I, sometimes known as Isabella the Catholic. She ruled from 1474 to 1503. After her death, Ferdinand technically shared power in a royal triumvirate with his daughter, Juana, and her husband, Philip.\n\nJUANA, sometimes known as Juana la loca or Joanna the Mad, was married to Philip the Handsome, Archduke of Austria, who shared power with her in Castile as King PHILIP I. Philip I co-ruled with Juana and de facto with his father-in-law, Ferdinand II, from 1504 to 1506. After his death, Juana's technical co-ruler was her son, Charles. (See below.) However, in reality all power was shared between her son and father, since Juana was subsequently incarcerated on grounds of her allegedly unstable mental health. She continued to rule as Queen of Castile, in name only, until her death in 1555.\n\nTHE HOUSE OF HAPSBURG\n\n(1516 - 1700)\n\nCARLOS I, more often known by his Austrian regnal name, Charles V (1516 - 1556.) He was also Holy Roman Emperor and inherited Spain through his mother, Juana, and grandfather, Ferdinand. He was nicknamed the Universal Emperor from the power he inherited from the Austrian and Spanish sides of his family. He was married to the Infanta Maria-Isabella of Portugal. He abdicated in 1556, in favour of his brother in Austria and his son in Spain.\n\nPHILIP II (1556 - 1598.) Best known in British classrooms for launching the Spanish Armada against Elizabeth I, like her Philip's reign was called \"a Golden Age\" by nationalist historians in his own country. He was married four times. Firstly to the Infanta Maria-Manuela of Portugal and, after her death, to Queen Mary I, sovereign of England and Ireland. After Queen Mary's death, King Philip married Elisabeth de Valois, Princess of France and after her death, he married Archduchess Anna of Austria. He assumed the crown of Portugal in 1580.\n\nPHILIP III, sometimes known as Philip the Pious (1598 - 1621.) He was married to Archduchess Margareta of Austria.\n\nPHILIP IV (1621 - 1665.) It was under Philip IV's reign that Portugal declared independence from Spain. He was married to Princess Elisabeth of France and, after her death, to Archduchess Mariana of Austria.\n\nCARLOS II (1665 - 1700.) He was married twice - firstly to Marie-Louise of Orleans and after her death, to the Countess Palatine, Maria-Anna von Neuberg. Both marriages were childless and his death led to the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the French monarchy was ultimately triumphant in placing a French prince, the grandson of Louis XIV, on the Spanish throne. They did this by virtue of the fact that both Louis XIII and Louis XIV had married daughters of the Spanish kings, which in France was taken to mean their blood-claim had devolved to their French descendants once the legitimate Spanish male line (Carlos II) died out.\n\nTHE HOUSE OF BOURBON\n\n(1700 - 1808, 1813 - 1870, 1874 - 1931, 1975 - today)\n\nPHILIP V (1700 - 1724, 1724 - 1746.) He was placed on the Spanish throne by his grandfather's armies and he was married twice. His first wife was Maria-Luisa of Savoy and after her death, he married Elisabeth Farnese, the heiress to the duchy of Parma. Philip V abdicated in favour of his son, Luis I, in Janaury 1724 but was forced to resume his royal duties when King Luis died of natural causes later that same year.\n\nLUIS I (January - September 1724.) He was married to Louise-Elisabeth of Orleans.\n\nFERDINAND VI, sometimes called Ferdinand the Learned (1746 - 1759.) He was married to the Infanta Maria-Barbara of Portugal.\n\nCARLOS III (1759 - 1788.) He had previously been Duke of Parma and Piacenza and also King of the Naples and Sicily. He was married to Maria-Amalia of Saxony and was part of the 'enlightened despotism' movement.\n\nCARLOS IV (1788 - 1808.) He was married to Maria-Luisa of Parma and he was forced to abdicated in 1808 in favour of his son, Ferdinand.\n\nFERDINAND VII (March - May 1808, 1813 - 1833.) He was deposed after two months on the throne by the French invasion of Spain and restored following the retreat of Bonapartism. He was married four times. Firstly to Princess Maria-Antoinetta of the Naples, after her death he married Infanta Maria-Isabella of Portugal. Following Queen Maria-Isabella's death, King Ferdinand married Princess Maria-Josepha of Saxony and after her death, he married Princess Maria-Cristina of the Two Sicilies.\n\nTHE BONAPARTE INVASION\n\n(1808 - 1813)"
