Gelardi for granting me permission to use in this book a similar format to her own, Born to Rule. Writing a single narrative of five individuals is no easy task, and can often have parallels or similar styles to other written works. Julia’s contributions to and guidance on this project cannot be overstated. I am most grate-ful to her for taking the time to review the manuscript at various points in its lifespan and offering insights on how to make it better.

I also want to say thank you to Gillian Dias, Susan Hay, Sabaina Malik, Todd Gannon, Suzanne Hanvey, Rosanna Brydon, Susie Weir, Kim Rochon, Nikki Pacsuta, Jenna DiNardo, Laura Toito, Nida Malik, Jennifer Stratemeyer, and Dave Trimmer.\n\nI thank my friend and research assistant, Tony La Vella. I am also grateful to my translator, Vanessa Rundle, who was more than gracious in helping me understand pages and pages of French text, both historic and colloquial.\n\nThe one individual who has supported me and been beside me since my first days writing is my editor and very dear friend, Cherylyn Donaldson. I cannot count the hours, days, and weeks she has spent with me on In Destiny’s Hands. She took an interest in every detail, from the storyline itself to the format of my endnotes. There are not words to describe the heartfelt gratitude I feel for all she has done.\n\nI am deeply grateful to the staff at iUniverse and the wonderful job they have done designing, formatting, and ultimately publishing and distributing the book. I am especially grateful to my publishing consultant, Michelle Poletti.

The night’s deepening cold had slowly given way to an agreeable, misty morning in Paris. Since before dawn, the streets had gradually been filling with excited, bloodthirsty onlookers. In the silence between the hourly bell tolls, chants from the promenades along the Seine could be heard resounding in the morning air. The government was so overwhelmed by the public response that 30,000 troops were brought in to ensure the peace. As incredible as the crowds along the Seine seemed, even more were assembling at the Place de la Révolution to witness the day’s crowning event. Shortly before ten o’clock that morning, the procession began amid shouts of make way for the Austrian woman and long live the Republic!1\n\nEscorted in an open cart like a common criminal, a calm, almost peaceful woman dressed in a white linen gown was moving closer and closer to her ultimate fate. As she awaited her arrival at the scaffold, the thirty-seven-year-old prisoner was utterly alone. Cruel fate had robbed her not only of the man she called her husband for twenty years, but her children too. Her last surviving child, a little girl, had been coldly ripped from her mother’s arms and locked away in a dungeon with her aunt while they waited for their fates to be decided. Who was this woman, and how did she come to know such a life? She was none other than the once innocent and beautiful Queen Marie Antoinette of France, the youngest daughter of the Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nMarie Antoinette was one of the most famous queens in history, but she was also the youngest of a very special group of Maria Theresa’s children. The Empress had sixteen children throughout the course of her life, but only five of them were born to rule. Most of her children did not live extraordinary lives. In fact, most did not live until adulthood. But destiny had a very specific plan, because five of them would be thrust into the spotlight of an entire continent. These Habsburg children would collectively rule over more than half of Europe at the height of their power and would become the most controversial leaders of the eighteenth century, shaping the course of history for generations to come.\n\nThese five siblings were the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II (1741–1790); Amalia, Duchess of Parma (1746–1804); Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany (who later became the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II) (1747–1792); Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily (1752–1814); and Queen Marie Antoinette of France (1755–1793). This book follows the course of their lives from their childhoods in Austria to the five countries they were destined to rule. They all shared the same experience of becoming a monarch, but they were bound even closer by their mother, one of the most famous women rulers in history, Empress Maria Theresa. Everything from the finer points of their childhood educations to their conduct as rulers was scrutinized by their mother’s watchful eye. This would dramatically shape the people they were destined to become.\n\nFate would also play a vital role in placing these five special siblings on a throne in Europe. Each of them would come to their role by accident, but guided by their mother’s powerful hand; even though Joseph was expected to become emperor, he did so in such an irregular fashion that his fellow kings did not know what to make of his accession. Joseph, Amalia, Leopold (Poldy), Maria Carolina (Charlotte), and Marie Antoinette (Antoine) would grow up reflecting the different facets of their mother’s personality, but no one individual would inherit all of her traits. Between the five of them, they would be known as despotic, scandalous, cold, ambitious, and naïve.\n\nTheir lives were not only defined by their mother, but also by the tragic circumstances that overtook them. Within the rarified circle of royalty in Europe, trials and tribulations were hallmarks. But these five siblings each met with tragic, often heartbreaking, events that earned them pity, sympathy, and sometimes even scorn. Two of them were considered to have been the victims of fate, but the other three have been criticized for bringing misfortune upon themselves.\n\nTheir stories are set against the backdrop of such historically significant events as the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars. France’s descent into revolution was a flashpoint that helped bring down the happiness of all five of Maria Theresa’s special children. The death of Queen Maria Carolina in 1814 also marked the end of the European order that was known up until that point. The continent—its reigning houses, its politics, and its prejudices—would be nearly unrecognizable after Napoleon engulfed it in the flames of war. And as we will see, these five imperial siblings played no small part in that reformation that forged the world as we know it today.\n\nSpecial attention should also be paid to the differences in rank between these five siblings. Marie Antoinette and Maria Carolina were queens; Joseph was an emperor; Amalia was a duchess; and for most of his life, Leopold was a grand duke. As divergent as these titles sound from one another, they meant relatively the same thing. Amalia’s title as Duchess of Parma was relative to the way her country was ruled. In this case, it was by her husband Don Ferdinand, Duke of Parma. This term in no way diminished her role as a reigning consort. Even until the early twentieth century, Europe possessed many duchies that were considered just as sovereign and independent as any kingdom or empire.\n\nAt its core, this book follows the personal lives of Joseph, Amalia, Poldy, Charlotte, and Antoine. As such, it has not been written as an historical account of their reigns. These are the stories of an imperial mother, her five reigning children, and the tragic fates they met, all as a result of their quests for glory. Their lives were also intimately connected with the political events of the day; no one can deny or overstate the importance of the French Revolution in Marie Antoinette’s destiny. As much as these five siblings shaped their own lives, so too did the tumultuous events that surrounded them. To that end, a certain degree of leeway has been taken in writing about the relevant political circumstances surrounding their lives. Austria, the Habsburg dominions, and the Holy Roman Empire are particularly important.\n\nUltimately, the central figure that links these five individuals is their mother, Maria Theresa. She was the most powerful female ruler in the first half of the eighteenth century, and reigned during some of its most turbulent years. By the time Joseph was born in 1741, Maria Theresa was the reigning Queen of Hungary and Bohemia,[1] a title she inherited from her father. These thrones made up the backbone of what was known as the Habsburg monarchy, a swath of territories, kingdoms, and other states personally owned by Maria Theresa’s family. Added to this later was her election as the Holy Roman Empress. These roles that Maria Theresa filled during her lifetime had a dramatic impact on the lives of her children. Some time, therefore, has been given to discussing her character and the circumstances surrounding her reign.\n\nReaders are about to see the erratic course these five lives will follow. Each of them was born into spectacular prestige, wealth, and splendor, but some of them would know the lowest poverty and the cruelest humiliation. Some would die in exile; others would die forgotten and alone. Each of them would have the distinction of playing prominent roles, not only in the royal families they married into, but also in the fates of their countries.\n\nAlmost all of them would die to mixed reactions, remembered first and foremost by their contemporaries as the Children of Maria Theresa. But it is up to each individual person to judge for themselves whether or not what history has said about these monarchs is true, or whether they were merely pawns in their mother’s game to fulfill her own dynastic ambitions. Did destiny truly have a part in their tumultuous lives, or were they solely responsible for the circumstances they experienced in their respective courts of Vienna, Parma, Florence, Naples, and Versailles?\n\nPart I:\n\nDestined to Reign\n\n(1741—1765)\n\nChapter 1: Queen, Empress, Mother\n\nThe winter of 1741 was an especially hard one for the people of Austria. Bone-chilling cold and food shortages devastated the unfortunate population. The government was disorganized, and social services had virtually fallen apart. Unrest and panic were rampant and threatened to destabilize the entire country. It is in the midst of this chaos that the story of Maria Theresa’s five special children begins, with the birth of the eldest of the group, the future Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. As the firstborn son of Maria Theresa, Queen of Bohemia and Hungary, and her husband, Grand Duke Francis Stephen of Tuscany, Joseph would one day hold the most vaunted position in Catholic Europe. Like his four special siblings, he came to the throne in a most unexpected way, and at the relatively young age of twenty-four. Joseph was born (weighing a staggering sixteen pounds) on March 13, 1741 at the Schönbrunn, his parents’ majestic palace in Vienna. When he was born, he joined an older sister, Archduchess Maria Anna (Marianne, b. 1738).\n\nWhen he was baptized that evening in the marble chapel at Schönbrunn with the names Joseph Benedikt August Johann Anton Michael Adam, Vienna was truly en fête over the birth of an heir. The British statesman Horace Walpole, who was in Vienna at the time, reported back to his superiors in London of the festive atmosphere in the city: On Sunday came the news of the Queen of Hungary being brought to bed of a son; on which occasion there will be great triumphs, operas and masquerades.1 At the time of Joseph’s baptism, Austria was engulfed in what became known as the War of the Austrian Succession of 1740–1748, a conflict that had great ramifications for Joseph and the House of Habsburg.\n\nAustria was faring badly in the war, the causes of which stretched back for decades into the reign of Maria Theresa’s father, Charles VI. As the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles reigned over an empire that stretched from France to Poland, and from the Adriatic to the Baltic and North seas. As the head of the House of Habsburg, Charles also personally owned one of the most impressive collections of territories in history. His dominions included present-day Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, as well as parts of Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Poland, and Germany.\n\nWhen Charles VI died in October 1740, his vast empire faced a crisis. The Habsburg monarchy lacked a political identity: it was a collection of duchies and kingdoms, each with its own historical tradition, constitutional structure, economic framework and ethnic peculiarity.2 And since Charles had no sons to succeed him, he left this disparate dominion to his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa. Many believed that, as a woman, Maria Theresa would be unable to rule such a far-flung inheritance. To help shore up support for his daughter, the Emperor drafted the Pragmatic Sanction, in which the other major European powers agreed to allow Maria Theresa to succeed her father in exchange for lands and territories. But within a matter of weeks of the emperor’s death, the monarchical powers all but tore up the Pragmatic Sanction in an undignified scramble to gain a piece of Maria Theresa’s inheritance for themselves.\n\nFour months before Joseph was born, in December 1740, a militarily powerful league made up of France, Spain, Bavaria, Saxony, and their allies launched a massive assault on the Habsburg lands. At the same time, Maria Theresa (who rightfully inherited the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary) was faced with a crisis of imperial proportions. The Holy Roman throne upon which her father had sat was an elected position, not a hereditary one. Each emperor was chosen by the rulers of the largest member states, who were known as the Electors. To make matters worse, women were forbidden from ruling because of an ancient German tradition known as Salic Law. This meant that if Maria Theresa wanted to become empress, she would need to have her husband Francis Stephen elected emperor. And since Bavaria and Saxony—who were both powerful electorates—sided against Queen Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen, their hopes of obtaining the election were dashed.\n\nDuring these turbulent first years of Archduke Joseph’s life, the situation for his parents only got worse. Maria Theresa was humiliated when the Elector of Bavaria, Charles Albert, declared himself emperor with the help of his allies. The final straw for the Queen came when she was publicly betrayed by one of the Holy Roman Empire’s most influential figures, King Frederick II of Prussia, more famously remembered as Frederick the Great. Since the day Emperor Charles VI died, Frederick placated Maria Theresa with promises of friendship and alliance, so much so that Francis Stephen commented to the Prussian ambassador in early 1741, Really the King is behaving like a father to the Queen and myself and we shall never be able to repay our obligations to him.3\n\nWith the wool pulled tightly over Maria Theresa’s eyes, Frederick II joined the alliance against Austria and marched his army straight into the richest, most valuable province in the Habsburg realm, Silesia. He glibly boasted that his actions \"prevented their occupation by any other power.\"4 The Queen would never reconquer Silesia, nor would she ever forgive Frederick for his treachery and deception. They would remain archenemies until the day Maria Theresa died. The Queen vowed to never take her eyes off defeating the armies of Frederick the Great.\n\nFor nearly four years, the War of the Austrian Succession raged across Europe and spelled trouble for Austria. A joint army from France, Bavaria, and Saxony managed to conquer Bohemia for a brief period and seized its capital, Prague. When the city fell, Maria Theresa penned an emotional letter to her governor in Bohemia: Prague is lost…this is the moment to save your country and your Queen; otherwise I shall be poor indeed.5 At one point, Bavarian forces managed to capture Linz, putting them only a mere hundred miles from Vienna. A diversion of troops from Upper Austria to Bohemia was the only thing that saved Vienna.\n\nThe tide finally turned in 1745 when Charles Albert of Bavaria, the self-proclaimed Holy Roman emperor, died. With her enemies confused and the electors unsure of their next move, Maria Theresa swung into action and struck a deal. In exchange for allowing Frederick the Great to keep Silesia, the Prussian king would support the election of Francis Stephen as the next Holy Roman emperor.\n\nThe coronation was held in the ancient city of Frankfurt in 1745. After kneeling on a velvet cushion before the electoral archbishops, Joseph’s father (now Emperor Francis I) bequeathed his title as Grand Duke of Tuscany in favor of his children. Cries of Long live the Emperor Francis I.! rang throughout the streets of Frankfurt.6 Maria Theresa would later describe it as the happiest day of her life.7\n\nMaria Theresa’s new position as queen-empress thrust her into the European spotlight. She was now the most powerful woman on the continent, wielding power like no other matriarch. The new role of Joseph’s parents meant a dramatic change in the archduke’s life. Maria Theresa was determined to see her son elected King of the Romans, the title given to the imperial heir. Having Joseph crowned king in Frankfurt would pave the way for him to take over the reins of one of the largest empires Europe had ever known.\n\nSKU-000171945_TEXT.pdf\n\nIn the tumultuous years before she ascended the imperial throne, Maria Theresa continued to give birth to a succession of children: Maria Christina (Mimi) in 1742, Maria Elizabeth in 1743, and Charles in 1745. On February 26, 1746, another girl—Maria Amalia Josepha Joanna Antonia—was born. Despite her long names, this archduchess would always be known as Amalia.\n\nThe use of the prefix Maria was a tradition for all Habsburg women since the 1600s. It was a way for the family to show their veneration of the Virgin [Mary], the magna mater Austriae, as she was spoken of in a singular blend of reverence and familial claim.8\n\nLess than a year after Amalia’s birth, another child was born that would join the rarified group of Maria Theresa’s special reigning children. On May 5, 1747, the Empress prepared to give birth at Schönbrunn. Like with her other children, the Empress was forced to deliver her baby practically in public thanks to the strict Austrian court etiquette to which she herself was a slave. Next to her apartments, in the ornate Mirror Room, were hundreds of aristocrats who held the Rights of Entry. For centuries, individuals with these rights were actually permitted to be in the room with the birthing mother. When Maria Theresa came to the throne she abolished this practice, and banished the courtiers to an adjacent room.\n\nNow those same courtiers, wearing the traditional Spanish dress Charles VI had adopted, complete with red stockings, black shoes, plumed hats, and lace-trimmed jackets, anxiously awaited the birth of the empress’s next child. Eventually, the gold-trimmed double doors flew open. Emperor Francis I, beaming with a wide grin on his round face, stepped through and proudly announced the birth of a son. The courtiers congratulated him, but were forbidden by tradition from kissing the hand of the Empress for another four days.\n\nAt his baptism, the baby was given the names Peter Leopold Joseph. Peter was for Peter the Great, father of the baby’s godmother Tsarina Elizabeth; Leopold was for his maternal great-grandfather, Emperor Leopold I; and Joseph was for his maternal great-uncle, Emperor Joseph I. This new addition to the Habsburg henhouse came to be known as Poldy, the German diminutive of Leopold.\n\nOfficially, the little boy was referred to as the Archduke Leopold. Each of his three names had illustrious forbearers, and were appropriate for this future grand duke and emperor since they were the names of three emperors, two of the Holy Roman Empire and one of Russia. The choice of Peter as the infant’s first name was not an obvious one, and came as the result of the friendship between Maria Theresa and Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia. These two women shared a close friendship as well as a unique bond; they both ruled the only two empires in Europe at the same time; Elizabeth became empress only a few months after Maria Theresa ascended the throne. Leopold’s mother considered the tsarina her dearly beloved friend and sister.9\n\nSKU-000171945_TEXT.pdf\n\nThe environment that the young Archduchess Amalia grew up in was less restricted and regimented than the one her brother, Joseph, was forced to endure. His position as heir meant he was kept on the tightest of leashes, but Amalia was given much more latitude in her early years.\n\nThat did not mean her family life was perfect, nor was her parents’ marriage an entirely blissful one. For all her beauty, wealth, and power, Empress Maria Theresa found herself unable to keep her husband’s attention. The Empress was forced to tolerate an endless stream of women who shared her husband’s affections; his relationship with the Princess von Auersperg, a lady of the court, was no secret to anyone. A visitor in Vienna admitted that the Emperor makes no secret of his passion for her. Even the imperial children knew about their father’s love for women. The Emperor is a very good-hearted father, said Archduchess Maria Christina, one can always rely upon him as a friend, and we must do what we can to protect him from his weaknesses. I am referring to his conduct with Princess Auersperg.10\n\nIn spite of Francis’s unfaithfulness, he and Maria Theresa had a marriage that seemed to work. They were passionately in love, and managed to overlook this one area for the good of their relationship. The mistresses that paraded in and out of Francis’s bedroom actually helped showcase one of Maria Theresa’s greatest traits: her devotion to the Roman Catholic faith. Nathaniel Wraxall, a frequent visitor to Vienna, observed that the empress’s faith made her very virtuous in her conduct, true to her marriage vows, and never has an impure thought, has but little patience with the indiscretions of others.11\n\nThe Empress willingly forgave her husband’s infidelities because she passionately believed in being an inscrutable Christian role model for her children, especially her daughters. She felt so strongly about the role of women in marriage that she once told her daughters that they are born to obey and must learn to do so in good time.12 Her devotion to God was one of the defining characteristics of Maria Theresa’s life, one that she worked diligently to leave as a legacy to her children.\n\nMaria Theresa was not without her own faults. There was a marked difference in the way she treated her children. Her favorites—Charles and Mimi—received lavish affection, but the others were often criticized and compared to their older siblings. The Empress believed that by making her children keenly aware of their own faults, it would help improve them as future rulers. As Maria Theresa would one day discover, this type of parenting rarely worked.\n\nFor Amalia, life with her brothers and sisters in the 1740s was a whirlwind of family activities amidst a variety of fairytale-like homes. In winter, the imperial family ensconced themselves in the forbidding Romanesque palace known as the Hofburg. Located in Vienna, the Hofburg was the most lavish of all the imperial residences. Built by an ancient German dynasty in the thirteenth century, it looked a bit like a medieval fortress.13 It boasted eighteen different wings and contained no less than 2,600 rooms. At any one time, several thousand servants waited on Maria Theresa and her family at the Hofburg.\n\nIn the summer, the family ventured to the less imposing but equally majestic Schönbrunn Palace on the outskirts of the city. There, Maria Theresa was able to indulge her love of decorating. Rooms were done in the Rococo style with lacquer mirrors, vellum miniatures and tapestries. The empress also relished in decorating parts of the palace in the Far Eastern style. She once declared that all the diamonds in the world could not compare to what comes from the Indies.14 The famous Habsburg historian Gordon Brook-Shepherd believed the Schönbrunn was truly unique: Unlike its great architectural and political rivals, Versailles or Potsdam, it remained also a home.15 The children also loved playing in Schönbrunn’s unusual menagerie, which included a camel, a rhinoceros, a puma, red squirrels, and a variety of parrots.\n\nSKU-000171945_TEXT.pdf\n\nThe close of the 1740s saw a rapid change of fortunes for Francis I and Maria Theresa. The War of the Austrian Succession was ended after eight long years. In the last weeks of April 1748, a continental congress was held in the Imperial Free City of Aix-la-Chapelle. There, surrounded by princes, politicians, and diplomats, Francis I and Maria Theresa were hailed as the undisputed rulers of the Holy Roman Empire. This recognition by their enemies cemented the Habsburgs’ place as one of the preeminent powers in Europe.\n\nOnce the war ended, the Emperor and Empress continued to expand their family with the arrivals of Maria Carolina (b. 1748), Maria Johanna (b. 1750), and Maria Josepha (b. 1751). Sadly, Carolina died shortly after being born. One courtier recalled the tragic scene that took place: On Tuesday, towards night, Her Majesty gave birth to an Archduchess who died a few minutes afterwards, baptized, however, by a lady among the assistants.16 But by December 1751 the Empress was enceinte again. This time, a beautiful baby girl was born on August 13, 1752. Delivered at the Schönbrunn, the baby was given the names Maria Carolina Louise Josepha Joanna Antonia.\n\nThis archduchess’s regal names were fitting for this daughter of an empress and a future queen. Maria was for the Virgin Mary; Carolina was for her maternal grandfather, Emperor Charles VI; Louise was for the baby’s godfather, King Louis XV of France; Joseph was for none other than her older brother; Joanna was for St. John the Apostle; and Antonia was for St. Anthony of Padua. This bright-eyed baby would be known to her intimates all her life as Charlotte, a name the Empress always cherished but never chose for any of her daughters. The rest of the world would remember her as the famous Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily.\n\nThe choice of Louis XV for the baby’s godfather was a bold move, especially since France had sided against Austria during the War of the Austrian Succession. But the decision also made sense because, like all of her siblings, Charlotte was half French.\n\nBefore her parents got married in 1737, her father was known as François Stefan, Duke of Lorraine. When Charles VI brought François Stefan to Vienna in 1723 as Maria Theresa’s future husband, King Louis XV became anxious that a marriage between a Habsburg archduchess and the Duke of Lorraine would spell trouble for France. Louis XV wanted to prevent Lorraine from allying itself to the Habsburgs, so he did what all rulers seemed to do, he struck a deal. Louis XV ordered his minister, Cardinal Fleury, to inform Emperor Charles VI that since Lorraine was a French principality, if François Stefan wanted to marry Maria Theresa he would have to renounce his claim to the duchy. To further entice Charles VI, Fleury offered French support for the Pragmatic Sanction if he could convince François Stefan to renounce Lorraine."
