        "text": "When King Ferdinand VII of Spain died on September 29th, 1833, he left behind two little daughters under the age of four. The eldest was proclaimed Queen, and thus began the disputed reign of Isabella II of Spain, the child sovereign. Although raised by her mother to be dignified and steadfast, Isabella was willful, fun-loving and spoiled, despite having been thrust into politics and intrigue for as long as she could remember. At the age of 16, Isabella was married to her double-first cousin Francis, Duke of Cádiz. Francis was “an effeminate man, whom [she] abhorred” and the Queen made no attempt to hide her contempt for him. She is famously quoted as saying: “What can I say about a man who, on our wedding night, was wearing more lace than I was?”\n\nHistory likes to paint Isabella as the nymphomaniac queen whose “voracious sexual appetite” began at the age of 13; her promiscuity became so alarming that she was hurriedly married off to the “weak and inoffensive” Francis, for fear she might become pregnant. Contemporary accounts highlight Francis’ unwillingness to have sex with his wife, poking fun at his supposed impotence or physically deformity that prevented him from completing the act. Whatever it was, the unhappy royal couple did manage to have children - nine in fact - and none of which are believed fathered by Francis, who instead carried on a “discreet, lasting relationship” with a male courtier, achieving some much needed emotional stability. Meanwhile, the Queen busied herself with a string of lovers and numerous bastard babies.\n\nThe rumors about Isabella’s infidelity (true or not) eventually caught up to her, and the Queen formally abdicated in 1870 following the Glorious Revolution of 1868. Her eldest surviving son succeed the throne four years later following a military coup, but even that did not stop Spain’s problems: Alfonso was still believed to be a bastard child, and he was not accepted as the true ruler - at least at first. Isabella and Francis left Spain and the couple ended up in France where they amicably separated and, in time, became good friends. Isabella spent the remainder of her life in Paris, where she died aged 73."
