The idea of developing a coherent, complete presentation of an entire field of science in a series of closely related textbooks is not a new one. Many older physicists remember with real pleasure their sense of adventure and discovery as they worked their ways through the classic series by Sommerfeld, by Planck and by Landau and Lifshitz. From the students’ viewpoint, there are a great many obvious advantages to be gained through use of consistent notation, logical ordering of topics and coherence of presentation; beyond this, the complete coverage of the science provides a unique opportunity for the author to convey his personal enthusiasm and love for his subject. The present five-volume set, Theoretical Physics, is in fact only that part of the complete set of textbooks developed by Greiner and his students that presents the quantum theory. I have long urged him to make the remaining volumes on classical mechanics and dynamics, on electromagnetism, on nuclear and particle physics, and on special topics available to an English-speaking audience as well, and we can hope for these companion volumes covering all of theoretical physics some time in the future. What makes Greiner’s volumes of particular value to the student and professor alike is their completeness. Greiner avoids the all too common “it follows that . . . ” which conceals several pages of mathematical manipulation and confounds the student. He does not hesitate to include experimental data to illuminate or illustrate a theoretical point and these data, like the theoretical content, have been kept up to date and topical through frequent revision and expansion of the lecture notes upon which these volumes are based. Moreover, Greiner greatly increases the value of his presentation by including something like one hundred completely worked examples in each volume. Nothing is of greater importance to the student than seeing, in detail, how the theoretical concepts and tools under study are applied to actual problems of interest to a working physicist. And, finally, Greiner adds brief biographical sketches to each chapter covering the people responsible for the development of the theoretical ideas and/or the experimental data presented. It was Auguste Comte (1798–1857) in his Positive Philosophy who noted, “To understand a science it is necessary to know its history”. This is all too often forgotten in modern physics teaching and the bridges that Greiner builds to the pioneering figures of our science upon whose work we build are welcome ones. Greiner’s lectures, which underlie these volumes, are internationally noted for their clarity, their completeness and for the effort that he has devoted to making physics an V\n\nVI\n\nForeword to Earlier Series Editions\n\nintegral whole; his enthusiasm for his science is contagious and shines through almost every page. These volumes represent only a part of a unique and Herculean effort to make all of theoretical physics accessible to the interested student. Beyond that, they are of enormous value to the professional physicist and to all others working with quantum phenomena. Again and again the reader will find that, after dipping into a particular volume to review a specific topic, he will end up browsing, caught up by often fascinating new insights and developments with which he had not previously been familiar. Having used a number of Greiner’s volumes in their original German in my teaching and research at Yale, I welcome these new and revised English translations and would recommend them enthusiastically to anyone searching for a coherent overview of physics. Yale University New Haven, CT, USA 1989\n\nD. Allan Bromley Henry Ford II Professor of Physics\n\nPreface to the Fourth Edition\n\nWe are pleased by the positive resonance of our book which now necessitates a fourth edition. We have used this opportunity to implement corrections of misprints and amendments at several places, and to extend and improve the discussion of many of the exercises and examples. We hope that our presentation of the method of equivalent photons (Example 3.17), the form factor of the electron (Example 5.7), the infrared catastrophe (Example 5.8) and the energy shift of atomic levels (Example 5.9) are now even better to understand. The new Exercise 5.10 shows in detail how to arrive at the non-relativistic limit for the calculation of form factors. Moreover, we have brought up-to-date the Biographical Notes about physicists who have contributed to the development of quantum electrodynamics, and references to experimental tests of the theory. For example, there has been recent progress in the determination of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton (discussed in Exercise 3.5 on the Rosenbluth formula) and the Lamb shift of high-Z atoms (discussed in Example 5.9 on the energy shift of atomic levels), while the experimental verification of the birefringence of the QED vacuum in a strong magnetic field (Example 7.8) remains unsettled and is a topic of active ongoing research. Again, we thank all colleagues and readers for their comments and information about misprints in the book, and are grateful to the team at Springer-Verlag and especially to Dr. Stefan Scherer for smoothly handling the preparation of this fourth edition. Frankfurt am Main, October 2008\n\nWalter Greiner Joachim Reinhardt\n\nVII\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nSince the need for a third edition of this book has arisen, we have endeavoured to improve and extend it in several ways. At many places small changes were made, misprints have been corrected, and references have been added. In Chap. 5 new theoretical and experimental results on the Lamb shift in heavy atoms and on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are reported. We have also added a number of new topics in Chaps. 3, 5, and 7 in the form of examples and exercises. Example 3.19 contains a detailed treatment of electron–positron pair production in the collision of a high-energy photon with a laser beam. This is supplemented by Exercise 3.20 where a closed solution of the Dirac equation in the field of a plane wave is derived. Furthermore, Example 5.3 on the running coupling constant in QED and Example 7.5 on the supercritial point charge problem have been added. Finally, Example 7.8 treats the birefringence of the QED vacuum in a strong magnetic field. We thank all colleagues and readers who have informed us about misprints in the book and are grateful to the team at Springer-Verlag for expertly handling the preparation of this new edition. Frankfurt am Main, August 2002\n\nWalter Greiner Joachim Reinhardt\n\nVIII\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\n\nThe need for a second edition of our text on Quantum Electrodynamics has given us the opportunity to implement some corrections and amendments. We have corrected a number of misprints and minor errors and have supplied additional explanatory remarks at various places. Furthermore some new material has been included on the magnetic moment of the muon (in Example 5.7) and on the Lamb shift (in Example 5.9). Finally, we have added the new Example 3.17 which explains the equivalent photon method. We thank several colleagues for helpful comments and also are grateful to Dr. R. Mattiello who has supervised the preparation of the second edition of the book. Furthermore we acknowledge the agreeable collaboration with Dr. H.J. Kölsch and his team at Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg. Frankfurt am Main, July 1994\n\nWalter Greiner Joachim Reinhardt\n\nIX\n\nPreface to the First Edition\n\nTheoretical physics has become a many-faceted science. For the young student it is difficult enough to cope with the overwhelming amount of new scientific material that has to be learnt, let alone obtain an overview of the entire field, which ranges from mechanics through electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, field theory, nuclear and heavy-ion science, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and solid-state theory to elementary-particle physics. And this knowledge should be acquired in just 8–10 semesters, during which, in addition, a Diploma or Master’s thesis has to be worked on or examinations prepared for. All this can be achieved only if the university teachers help to introduce the student to the new disciplines as early on as possible, in order to create interest and excitement that in turn set free essential new energy. Naturally, all inessential material must simply be eliminated. At the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt we therefore confront the student with theoretical physics immediately, in the first semester. Theoretical Mechanics I and II, Electrodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics I – An Introduction are the basic courses during the first two years. These lectures are supplemented with many mathematical explanations and much support material. After the fourth semester of studies, graduate work begins, and Quantum Mechanics II – Symmetries, Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Electrodynamics, the Gauge Theory of Weak Interactions, and Quantum Chromodynamics are obligatory. Apart from these a number of supplementary courses on special topics are offered, such as Hydrodynamics, Classical Field Theory, Special and General Relativity, Many-Body Theories, Nuclear Models, Models of Elementary Particles, and Solid-State Theory. Some of them, for example the two-semester courses Theoretical Nuclear Physics or Theoretical Solid-State Physics, are also obligatory. This volume of lectures deals with the subject of Quantum Electrodynamics. We have tried to present the subject in a manner which is both interesting to the student and easily accessible. The main text is therefore accompanied by many exercises and examples which have been worked out in great detail. This should make the book useful also for students wishing to study the subject on their own. When lecturing on the topic of quantum electrodynamics, one has to choose between two approaches which are quite distinct. The first is based on the general methods of quantum field theory. Using classical Lagrangian field theory as a starting point one introduces noncommuting field operators, builds up the Fock space to describe systems of particles, and introduces techniques to construct and evaluate the scattering matrix and other physical observables. This program can be realized either by the method of canonical quantization or by the use of path integrals. The theory of quantum electrodynamics in this context emerges just as a particular example of the general X\n\nPreface to the First Edition\n\nformalism. In the present volume, however, we do not follow this general but lengthy path; rather we use a “short cut” which arrives at the same results with less effort, and which has the advantage of great intuitive appeal. This is the propagator formalism, which was introduced by R.P. Feynman (and, less well known, by E.C.G. Stückelberg) and makes heavy use of Green’s functions to describe the propagation of electrons and photons in space–time. It is clear that the student of physics has to be familiar with both approaches to quantum electrodynamics. (In the German edition of these lectures a special volume is dedicated to the subject of field quantization.) However, to gain quick access to the fascinating properties and processes of quantum electrodynamics and to its calculational techniques the use of the propagator formalism is ideal. The first chapter of this volume contains an introduction to nonrelativistic propagator theory and the use of Green’s functions in physics. In the second chapter this is generalized to the relativistic case, introducing the Stückelberg–Feynman propagator for electrons and positrons. This is the basic tool used to develop perturbative QED. The third chapter, which constitutes the largest part of the book, contains applications of the relativistic propagator formalism. These range from simple Coulomb scattering of electrons, scattering off extended nuclei (Rosenbluth’s formula) to electron– electron (Møller) and electron–positron (Bhabha) scattering. Also, processes involving the emission or absorption of photons are treated, for instance, Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and electron–positron pair annihilation. The brief fourth chapter gives a summary of the Feynman rules, together with some notes on units of measurement in electrodynamics and the choice of gauges. Chapter 5 contains an elementary discussion of renormalization, exemplified by the calculation of the lowest-order loop graphs of vacuum polarization, self-energy, and the vertex correction. This leads to a calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and of the Lamb shift. In Chap. 6 the Bethe–Salpeter equation is introduced, which describes the relativistic two-particle system. Chapter 7 should make the reader familiar with the subject of quantum electrodynamics of strong fields, which has received much interest in the last two decades. The subject of supercritical electron states and the decay of the neutral vacuum is treated in some detail, addressing both the mathematical description and the physical implications. Finally, in the last chapter, the theory of perturbative quantum electrodynamics is extended to the treatment of spinless charged bosons. An appendix contains some guides to the literature, giving references both to books which contain more details on quantum electrodynamics and to modern treatises on quantum field theory which supplement our presentation. We should mention that in preparing the first chapters of our lectures we have relied heavily on the textbook Relativistic Quantum Mechanics by J.D. Bjorken and S.D. Drell (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1964). We enjoyed the help of several students and collaborators, in particular Jürgen Augustin, Volker Blum, Christian Borchert, Snježana Butorac, Christian Derreth, Bruno Ehrnsperger, Klaus Geiger, Mathias Grabiak, Oliver Graf, Carsten Greiner, Kordt Griepenkerl, Christoph Hartnack, Cesar Ionescu, André Jahns, Jens Konopka, Georg Peilert, Jochen Rau, Wolfgang Renner, Dirk-Hermann Rischke, Jürgen Schaffner, Alexander Scherdin, Dietmar Schnabel, Thomas Schönfeld, Stefan Schramm, Eckart Stein, Mario Vidovic, and Luke Winckelmann.\n\nXI\n\nXII\n\nPreface to the First Edition\n\nWe are also grateful to Prof. A.

QED is the quantum field theory of electrons and positrons (the electron–positron field) and photons (the electromagnetic or radiation field). The theory also applies to the known heavy leptons (μ and τ ) and, in general, can be used to describe the electromagnetic interaction of other charged elementary particles. However, these particles are also subject to nonelectromagnetic forces, i.e. the strong and the weak interactions. Strongly interacting particles (hadrons) are found to be composed of other particles, the quarks, so that new degrees of freedom become important (colour, flavour). It is believed that on this level the strong and weak interactions can be described by “non-Abelian” gauge theories modelled on QED, which is the prototype of an “Abelian” gauge theory. These are the theories of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for the strong interaction and quantum flavourdynamics for the weak interaction. In this course we will concentrate purely on the theory of QED in its original form. Quantum electrodynamics not only is the archetype for all modern field theories, but it also is of great importance in its own right since it provides the theoretical foundation for atomic physics. There are two approaches to QED. The more formal one relies on a general apparatus for the quantization of wave fields; the other, more illustrative, way originates from Stückelberg and Feynman, and uses the propagator formalism. Nowadays a student of physics has to know both, but it is better, both in terms of the physics and teaching, if it is obvious at an early stage why a formalism was developed and to what it can be applied. Almost everyone is keen to see as early as possible how different processes are actually calculated. Feynman’s propagator formalism is the best way to achieve this. Consequently, it will be central to these lectures. References to the less intuitive but more systematic treatment of QED based on the formalism of quantum field theory are given in the appendix. For the moment we turn to a more general discussion of scattering processes. The aim here is to calculate transition probabilities and scattering cross sections in the framework of Dirac’s theory of electrons and positrons. These calculations will be exact in principle; practically, however, they will be carried out using perturbation theory, that is an expansion in terms of small interaction parameters. Because we have to describe the creation and annihilation processes of electron–positron pairs, the formalism has to be relativistic from the beginning. In Feynman’s propagator method, scattering processes are described by means of integral equations. The guiding idea is, that positrons are to be interpreted as electrons with negative energy which move in the reverse time direction. This idea was W. Greiner, J. Reinhardt, Quantum Electrodynamics, © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nfirst formulated by E.C.G. Stückelberg and was used extensively by R. Feynman.1 Feynman was rewarded with the Nobel price for his formulation of quantum electrodynamics, together with J. Schwinger and S. Tomonaga in 1965. The latter gave alternative formulations of QED, that are mutually equivalent. In the following we want to convince ourselves of the power of Feynman’s formulation of the theory. The more or less heuristic rules obtained in this way fully agree with the results that can be obtained with much more effort using the method of quantum field theory.\n\n1.2 The Nonrelativistic Propagator First it is useful to remember the definition of Green’s functions in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The concepts and methods to be acquired here are then easily transferred to relativistic quantum mechanics. Fig. 1.1. Schematic representation of an experimental arrangement to measure a scattering process. Collimators D ensure that, at the position of the detector no interference occurs between incoming and scattered waves\n\nWe shall mainly consider quantum-mechanical scattering processes in three dimensions, where one particle collides with a fixed force field or with another particle. A scattering process develops according to the scheme outlined in Fig. 1.1. In practice, one arranges by means of collimators D that the incoming particles are focussed in a well-defined beam. Such a collimated beam is in general not a wave, which extends to infinity, e.g. of the form exp(ikz), but a superposition of many plane waves with adjacent wave vectors k, i.e. a wave packet. Nevertheless, in the stationary formulation of scattering theory for simplicity one often represents the incoming wave packet by a plane wave. Then one has only to ensure that interference between the incoming wave packet and the scattered wave is impossible at the position of the detector which is far removed from the scattering center. If plane waves are used in calculations, therefore one has to exclude this interference explicitly.2 In scattering processes we consider wave packets, which develop in time from initial conditions, which were fixed in the distant past. So in general, one does not consider stationary eigenstates of energy (i.e. stationary waves). A typical question for a scattering problem is then: What happens to a wave packet that represents a particle in the distant past and approaches a center of scattering (a potential or another particle)? What does this wave look like in the distant future? Here the generalized Huygens’ principle helps us to answer these questions. If a wave function ψ(x, t) is known at a certain time t, then its shape at a later time t ′ 1 2\n\nSee for example R.P. Feynman: Phys. Rev. 76, 749 (1949).\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the wave-packet description see for example M.L. Goldberger and K.M. Watson: Collision Theory (Wiley, New York, 1964), Chap. 3, or R.G. Newton: Scattering Theory of Waves and Particles (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1966), Chap. 6.\n\n1.3\n\nGreen’s Function and Propagator\n\ncan be deduced by regarding every spatial point x at time t as a source of a spherical wave that emerges from x. It is plausible to assume that the intensity of the wave, which emerges from x and arrives at x ′ at time t ′ , is proportional to the initial exciting wave amplitude ψ(x, t). Let us call the constant of proportionality iG(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe factor i is convention. The generalized Huygens’ principle can thus be expressed in the following terms: ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = i d3 x G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t) , t ′ > t . (1.2) Here ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) is the wave that arrives at x ′ at time t ′ . The quantity G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) is known as the Green’s function or propagator. It describes the effect of the wave ψ(x, t), which was at point x in the past (at time t < t ′ ), on the wave ψ(x ′ , t ′ ), which is at point x ′ at the later time t ′ . If the Green’s function G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) is known, the final physical state ψ(x ′ , t ′ ), which develops from a given initial state ψ(x, t), can be calculated using (1.2). Knowing G therefore solves the complete scattering problem. Or, in other words: Knowing G is equivalent to the complete solution of Schrödinger’s equation. First, however, we want to gain some mathematical insight and discuss the various ways of defining Green’s functions.\n\n1.3 Green’s Function and Propagator To explain the mathematical concepts it is best to start with Schrödinger’s equation, i\n\n∂ψ(x, t) = Hˆ ψ(x, t) = Hˆ 0 + V (x, t) ψ(x, t) , ∂t 2\n\nHˆ 0 = − ∇2 , 2m\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich describes the interaction of a particle of mass m with a potential source fixed in space. If we replace m by the reduced mass μ = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ), (1.3) remains valid for the (nonrelativistic) two-body problem. The differential equation (1.3) is of first order in time, i.e., there are no higher-order time derivatives. Therefore, the first derivative with respect to time, ∂ψ(x, t)/∂t, can always be expressed by ψ(x, t), which is obviously the meaning of (1.3). From this, in turn, it follows that, if the value of ψ(x, t) is known at one certain time (e.g. t0 ) and at all spatial points x, i.e. if ψ(x, t0 ) is known, one can calculate the wave function ψ(x, t) at any point and any times (at earlier times (t < t0 ) as well as at later times (t > t0 )). Furthermore, since Schrödinger’s equation is linear in ψ, the superposition principle is valid, i.e. solutions can be linearly superposed and the relation between wave functions at different times (ψ(x, t) and ψ(x, t0 )) has to be linear. This means that ψ(x, t) has to satisfy a linear homogeneous integral equation of the form ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = i d3 x G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t) , (1.4) where the integration extends over the whole space. This relation also defines the function G, which is called the Green’s function corresponding to the Hamiltonian Hˆ . It\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nis important to note that relation (1.4) – in contrast to (1.2) – makes no difference between a propagation of ψ forward in time (t ′ > t) or backward in time (t ′ < t). However, in most cases it is desirable to distinguish clearly between these two cases. For forward propagation one therefore defines the retarded Green’s function or propagator by G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) for t ′ > t + ′ ′ G (x , t ; x, t) = . (1.5) 0 for t ′ < t It is now useful to introduce the step function Θ(τ ) (Fig. 1.2): 1 for τ > 0 . Θ(τ ) = 0 for τ < 0 Fig. 1.2. The unit step function\n\n(1.6)\n\nWith this the causal evolution of ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) from ψ(x, t), with t ′ > t, can be formulated as follows: ′ ′ ′ Θ(t − t)ψ(x , t ) = i d3 x G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t) . (1.7) For t ′ < t this relation is trivial because of (1.5) and (1.6), which together give 0 = 0, and for t ′ > t it is identical with (1.4). Equation (1.7) ensures that the original wave packet ψ(x, t) develops into a later ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) with t ′ > t. Hence there exists a causal connection between ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) and ψ(x, t). We will return to this question in Sect. 1.6 and Exercise 1.1. If one wants to describe the evolution backwards in time, it is useful to introduce the advanced Green’s function G− : −G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) for t ′ < t − ′ ′ . (1.8) G (x , t ; x, t) = 0 for t ′ > t Then the determination of the former wave packet ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) from the present one ψ(x, t), with t ′ < t, proceeds according to the relation Θ(t − t ′ )ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = −i d3 x G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t) , (1.9) which is again trivial for t ′ > t because of (1.6) and (1.8) and is identical with (1.4) for t ′ < t.\n\nEXERCISE 1.1 Properties of G Problem. Show the validity of the following relations: a) if t ′ > t1 > t: G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = i d3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )G+ (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) ,\n\n1.3\n\nGreen’s Function and Propagator\n\nb) if t ′ < t1 < t:\n\nExercise 1.1\n\nG− (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = −i\n\nd3 x1 G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )G− (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) ,\n\nc) if t > t1 : δ 3 (x − x ′ ) =\n\nd3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )G− (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) ,\n\nd3 x1 G− (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )G+ (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) .\n\nd) if t < t1 : ′\n\n3\n\nδ (x − x ) =\n\nSolution. a) The first two assertions (a) and (b) are readily understood because of relations (1.7) and (1.9), respectively. If we consider the propagation of an arbitrary wave packet ψ(x, t) into the future, we are able to conclude that ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = i\n\nd3 x G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\n(1)\n\nif t ′ > t. ψ(x, t) can be chosen at any arbitrary time t. Thus we can also insert an intermediate step: ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = i =i =i\n\nd3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )ψ(x 1 , t1 ) d3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )i 3\n\nd xi\n\nd3 x G+ (x 1 , t1 ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\nd3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )G+ (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) ψ(x, t) .\n\n(2)\n\nIf we compare relations (1) and (2), assertion (a) follows. b) The proof of case (b) proceeds along similar lines: ′\n\n′\n\nψ(x , t ) = −i\n\nd3 x G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\n(3)\n\nif t ′ < t. Again we insert an intermediate step: ′\n\n5\n\n′\n\nψ(x , t ) = −i = −i = −i\n\nd3 x1 G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )ψ(x 1 , t1 ) d3 x1 G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )(−i) d3 x (−i)\n\nd3 x G− (x 1 , t1 ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\nd3 x1 G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )G− (x 1 , t1 ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\nif t ′ < t1 < t. Comparing relations (3) and (4) assertion (b) follows.\n\n(4)\n\n6\n\nExercise 1.1\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nc) The proof of relations (c) and (d) proceeds similarly. We first write ′ ψ(x , t) = i d3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )ψ(x 1 , t1 ) =i =\n\nd3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )(−i) d3 x\n\nd3 x G− (x 1 , t1 ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\nd3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )G− (x 1 , t1 ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\n(5)\n\nif t > t1 . For a constant time t, ψ(x, t) can be expressed with the help of the δ function as (6) ψ(x ′ , t) = d3 xδ(x − x ′ )ψ(x, t) . The comparison of relations (5) and (6) yields assertion (c). d) The proof of (c) can be exactly copied ψ(x ′ , t) = −i d3 x1 G− (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )ψ(x 1 , t1 ) =\n\n3\n\nd x\n\nd3 x1 G− (x ′ , t; x 1 , t1 )G+ (x 1 , t1 ; x, t)ψ(x, t)\n\n(7)\n\nif t < t1 . Comparing (7) with the integral representation (6) proves (d).\n\n1.4 An Integral Equation for ψ Now we aim for a formal definition of the Green’s function. To this end we still want to proceed in a physical, illustrative manner to ensure that the propagator method is understood. Since the motion of a free particle is completely known, the free Green’s function G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) can be explicitly constructed (see Example 1.3). However, if we switch on a potential V (x, t), then G0 is modified to G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) and the question arises how the Green’s function G (including the interaction) is calculated from the free Green’s function G0 . To answer this we assume that the interaction potential V (x, t) acts at time t1 for a short time interval t1 . The potential during this interval is then V (x 1 , t1 ). For times preceding t1 the wave function is that of a free particle, i.e. for t < t1 the particle propagates according to the free propagator G0 . At t = t1 , V (x 1 , t1 ) acts, and a scattered wave is created, which can be calculated from Schrödinger’s equation ∂ − Hˆ 0 ψ(x 1 , t1 ) = V (x 1 , t1 )ψ(x 1 , t1 ) . (1.10) i ∂t1 As already mentioned, V (x 1 , t1 ) acts only during the time interval t1 . We denote the resulting wave with the help of the free wave φ as ψ(x 1 , t1 ) = φ(x 1 , t1 ) + ψ(x 1 , t1 ) ,\n\n(1.11)\n\n1.4\n\nAn Integral Equation for ψ\n\nwhere φ solves the free Schrödinger equation\n\ni\n\n∂ − Hˆ 0 φ(x 1 , t1 ) = 0 ∂t1\n\n(1.12)\n\nand where the scattered wave ψ(x 1 , t1 ) is zero for t < t1 . Note that ψ(x, t) means an increment of the function ψ(x, t); here, is not the Laplacian. Inserting (1.11) into (1.10) and taking into account (1.12), we find\n\n∂ ˆ i − H0 ψ(x 1 , t1 ) = V (x 1 , t1 ) (φ(x 1 , t1 ) + ψ(x 1 , t1 )) ∂t1\n\n(1.13)\n\nand, neglecting the small term V ψ on the right-hand side,\n\ni\n\n∂ − Hˆ 0 ψ(x 1 , t1 ) = V (x 1 , t1 )φ(x 1 , t1 ) . ∂t1\n\n(1.14)\n\nThis differential equation can be integrated in the time interval t1 to t1 + t1 . Taking into account that ψ(x 1 , t1 ) = 0 we get iψ(x 1 , t1 + t1 ) =\n\nt1 +t1 t1\n\ndt ′ Hˆ 0 ψ(x 1 , t ′ ) + V (x 1 , t ′ )φ(x 1 , t ′ ) .\n\n(1.15)\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side is of second order with respect to the small quantities ψ and t1 . Then in first-order accuracy the scattered wave is given by ψ(x 1 , t1 + t1 ) =\n\n−i V (x 1 , t1 )φ(x 1 , t1 )t1 .\n\n(1.16)\n\nSince the potential V (x 1 , t1 ) is assumed to vanish after the time interval t1 , the scattered wave propagates according to the free propagator G0 too, and we obtain at the later time t ′ > t1 ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = i =\n\nd3 x1 G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )ψ(x 1 , t1 ) 1 d3 x1 G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 ) V (x 1 , t1 )φ(x 1 , t1 )t1 .\n\n(1.17)\n\nHere we have replaced t1 + t1 by t1 which is justified in the limit of infinitesimal time intervals. Note that φ(x 1 , t1 ) is the wave that arrives at space–time point (x 1 , t1 ) before it is scattered at the potential V (x 1 , t1 ). Then the potential V (x 1 , t1 ) acts for a short time period t1 . It modifies the incoming wave to 1/V (x 1 , t1 )φ(x 1 , t1 )t1 and this “perturbed” wave propagates freely, described by the propagator G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 ) from (x 1 , t1 ) to (x ′ , t ′ ). The total wave ψ(x ′ , t ′ ), which originates from an arbitrary wave packet φ in the distant past by scattering\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nonce at the potential V (x 1 , t1 ) during the time period t1 , is then given by ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = φ(x ′ , t ′ ) + ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) 1 ′ ′ = φ(x , t ) + d3 x1 G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 ) V (x 1 , t1 )φ(x 1 , t1 )t1 = i d3 x G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) +\n\n1 d3 x1 t1 G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 ) V (x 1 , t1 )G0 (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) φ(x, t) . (1.18)\n\nComparing this with (1.2) or (1.4) we can identify the expression in brackets as the propagator G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t): G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) 1 + d3 x1 t1 G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 ) V (x 1 , t1 )G0 (x 1 , t1 ; x, t) . (1.19)\n\nFig. 1.3. Graphs illustrating scattering processes. (a) describes the free motion (propagation) of a particle from space–time point (x, t) to (x ′ , t ′ ). In (b) the particle moves from (x, t) to (x ′ , t ′ ) too, but is scattered once at the intermediate point by potential V (x 1 , t1 ). Graph (c) shows the same as graph (b), but the scattering now takes place at (x 2 , t2 ) instead of (x 1 , t1 ). Finally, (d) represents a double scattering event at (x 1 , t1 ) and (x 2 , t2 )\n\nNow we have achieved our goal of calculating the propagator G from the free propagator G0 – at least for the simple case of an interaction V (x 1 , t1 ), which is turned on only during the short time interval t1 . The various terms in (1.19) can be illustrated in space–time diagrams, as in Fig. 1.3. The first term of (1.19) corresponds to the free propagation of the wave packet from space–time point (x, t) to (x ′ , t ′ ). This is represented Fig. 1.3a. The second term in (1.19) describes the free propagation from space–time point (x, t) to (x 1 , t1 ). Here the particle is scattered at the potential V (x 1 , t1 ) during the time interval t1 . Afterwards it propagates again freely to space–time point (x ′ , t ′ ). This process is illustrated in Fig. 1.3b. If we switch on a second potential (x 2 , t2 ) at time t2 > t1 for a time interval t2 , then an additional scattering wave is created, whose contribution ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) to the total wave ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) at time t ′ > t2 can immediately be written down according to (1.17): ψ(x ′ ) = d3 x2 G0 (x ′ ; x2 )V (x2 )ψ(x2 )t2 =i\n\nd3 x d3 x2 t2 G0 (x ′ ; x2 )V (x2 )\n\n× G0 (x2 ; x) + d3 x1 t1 G0 (x2 ; x1 )V (x1 )G0 (x1 ; x) φ(x) . (1.20) From (1.18) we have substituted the scattering wave ψ(2), which arrives at space–time point (x 2 , t2 ). In addition we have introduced the obvious abbreviations (x, t) = x , 1 V (x i , ti ) = V (xi ) .\n\n(1.21)\n\nNote that we have absorbed the factor 1/ in the potential, since the two always appear together according to (1.16). The first term in (1.20), which is proportional\n\n1.4\n\nAn Integral Equation for ψ\n\nto G0 (x ′ ; x2 )V (x2 )G0 (x2 ; x)φ(x), represents a single scattering event at space–time point 2 and is illustrated in Fig. 1.3c. The second term in (1.20) is proportional to G0 (x ′ ; x2 )V (x2 )G0 (x2 ; x1 )V (x1 )G0 (x1 ; x)φ(x) and represents a double scattering event at the potential at space–time points x1 and x2 . This process is illustrated in Fig. 1.3d. Now the total wave, which arrives at space–time point (x ′ , t ′ ) after free propagation and single plus double scattering, is simply the sum of the partial waves (1.18) (this is the wave originating from free propagation and single scattering at (x 1 , t1 )) and (1.20) (this is the wave originating from single scattering at (x 2 , t2 ) as well as double scattering at (x 1 , t1 ) and (x 2 , t2 )).

However it is possible to get rid of the constraints for the multiple sums if we introduce the retarded Green’s function G+ (x ′ ; x) (see (1.5)), which fulfills 0 for t ′ < t + ′ ′ G0 (x , t ; x, t) = , G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) for t ′ > t 0 for t ′ < t + ′ ′ G (x , t ; x, t) = .

This leads to the following series expansion for the retarded interacting Green’s function + ′ ′ G+ (x ′ ; x) = G+ (x ; x) + d4 x1 G+ 0 0 (x ; x1 )V (x1 )G0 (x1 ; x) +\n\n+ + ′ d4 x1 d4 x2 G+ 0 (x ; x1 )V (x1 )G0 (x1 ; x2 )V (x2 )G0 (x2 ; x)\n\n+ ... ,\n\n(1.28)\n\n1.4\n\nAn Integral Equation for ψ\n\nwhere we used the abbreviation d4 x = d3 x dt = d3 x dx0 .\n\n(1.29)\n\nIn (1.28) the Green’s function G with interaction is expanded as a series of multiple scattering events, where the propagation between single scattering events is determined by the free Green’s function G0 . This multiple scattering series will be assumed to converge. We have also ignored complications arising from the possibility of bound states in the potential V . It is possible to write down a closed expression for the interacting Green’s function. This is achieved by formally summing the series (1.28) which leads to ′ G+ (x ′ ; x) = G+ 0 (x ; x) +\n\n′ + d4 x1 G+ 0 (x ; x1 )V (x1 )G (x1 ; x) .\n\n(1.30)\n\nThis is an integral equation for G+ . It is often called the Lippmann–Schwinger equation. As can be seen immediately, the multiple scattering series (1.28) can be generated by iterating the integral equation (1.30). Similarly the series (1.25) for the wave function ψ(x ′ ) can be summed, resulting in ′\n\nψ(x ) = lim i t→−∞\n\nd3 x G+ (x ′ ; x)φ(x)\n\n+ ′ ′ 4 + (x ; x) + d x G (x , x )V (x )G (x ; x) φ(x) = lim i d3 x G+ 1 0 1 1 1 0 t→−∞ ′\n\n= φ(x ) + lim = φ(x ′ ) +\n\nt→−∞\n\nd\n\n4\n\n′ x1 G+ 0 (x , x1 )V (x1 ) i\n\n′ d4 x1 G+ 0 (x , x1 )V (x1 )ψ(x1 ) .\n\nd3 x G+ (x1 ; x)φ(x) (1.31)\n\nscattered wave\n\nThis is an integral equation for ψ(x ′ ). One should realize that up to now nothing is solved, since one has to integrate over a still-unknown wave function ψ. However, in some sense the integral equations (1.30, 1.31) are more useful than the original differential equation (1.3). They allow a systematic approximation in the case of weak perturbations (that is a small perturbation potential V ). Moreover, one can easily impose the correct boundary conditions (cf. the discussion in Sect. 1.5). ′ ′ + ′ It should be noted that not only G+ 0 (x ; x) vanishes for t < t, but also G (x ; x). This property of the retarded Green’s functions expresses the principle of causality in an elementary way through (1.31) and (1.25). For example, the expansion (1.26) means that an interaction with the potential V at time tk can influence additional scattering interactions only if these occur later in time (tk < ti , tj ). Let us return to the scattering expansion (1.28). If the infinite series is truncated after a finite number of terms (1.28) allows us to calculate G+ as a functional of V and G0 . Given G+ one can immediately solve the initial value problem. The wave function ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) is obtained by a simple integration according to (1.31) if it is known at some former point in time.\n\n11\n\n12\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\n1.5 Application to Scattering Problems Let us consider a scattering problem. We know the incoming wave packet φ(x, t); it describes a particle in the distant past moving towards the scattering center. We want to construct the wave that originates from the interaction with the potential V (x, t), as it looks in the distant future. We idealize the scattering problem by assuming that no interaction is present at the initial time, i.e. V (x, t) → 0\n\nfor t → −∞ ,\n\nthe initial wave φ is therefore a solution of the Schrödinger equation for free particles, which fulfills certain initial conditions.3 The exact wave ψ(x, t) then approaches the incoming wave φ(x, t) in the limit t → −∞: lim ψ(x, t) = φ(x, t) .\n\n(1.32)\n\nt→−∞\n\nIn the distant future the exact wave ψ (+) is, according to (1.25, 1.31) given by (+) ′ ′ ψ (x , t ) = lim i d3 x G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)φ(x, t) t→−∞\n\n= φ(x ′ ) +\n\n′ (+) d4 x1 G+ (x1 ) . 0 (x ; x1 )V (x1 )ψ\n\n(1.33)\n\nscattered wave\n\nThe ψ (+) (x1 ) appearing in this equation is the exact wave that originates from the initial wave packets (1.32). The superscript (+) over ψ is meant to express the fact that we are dealing with a wave which propagates into the future. As has already been mentioned the second term in (1.33) represents the scattered wave. It includes all single and multiple scattering events. Now we assume that the potential V (x, t) vanishes after a certain time, i.e. lim V (x ′ , t ′ ) = 0 .\n\nt ′ →∞\n\nFig. 1.4. The scattering of two particles: the interaction increases as they approach each other and decreases as they depart\n\n(1.34)\n\nIf the interaction potential has a short range this condition will be met: Consider for example the mutual scattering of two particles, where the interaction increases from zero during their approach and decreases to zero when they depart (Fig. 1.4). If this condition is not fulfilled one may take recourse to the prescription ofadiabatic switch3\n\nThe so-defined adiabatic approximation assumes that the solutions of Schrödinger’s equation can be approximated by the stationary eigenfunctions of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, so that a certain eigenfunction at time t1 transforms continuously into the corresponding eigenfunction at a later time. If we can solve the equation H (t)φn (t) = En (t)φn (t) at any time, then we expect that a system that assumes a discrete nondegenerate state φm (t) with energy Em (0) at time t = 0 will be in the state φm (t) with energy Em (t) at time t , provided that H (t) varies slowly with time. However, this means that switching on or off H (t) cannot cause excitations to other states φk (t)(k = m)! The validity of the adiabatic approximation can be readily checked: if the typical excitation energies of a system are given by E ≈ Em − Ek , then the corresponding time scale is of the order t ≈ /E. The switch-on time must be large compared to t !\n\n1.5\n\nApplication to Scattering Problems\n\ning. This means that the potential is forced to vanish asymptotically, e.g. by replacing e−λ|t| V (x, t) .\n\n→\n\nV (x, t)\n\nThe cutoff parameter λ has to be chosen small enough that the switching does not introduce spurious transient excitations. We are now able to consider the exact wave ψ (+) (x ′ , t ′ ) in the distant future, i.e. in the limit t ′ → ∞. All information about the scattered wave can be summarized in the probability amplitudes. Their squares express the probability that a particle from a given, free, initial state φi will be scattered into various final states φf in the limit t ′ → +∞. Since the potential is assumed to vanish for t → −∞ as well as for t → +∞, we can consider the φ’s as plane waves. 1 exp i k f · x ′ − ωf t ′ . φf (x ′ , t ′ ) = 3 (2π)\n\n(1.35)\n\nThe plane wave (1.35) is subjected to the continuum normalization (or δ-function normalization).

The second term represents single scattering, the third term double scattering, etc. Some of these contributions to the S matrix are illustrated in Fig. 1.3: they are coherently summed to give the total S matrix element. One can obtain alternative expressions for the S matrix if one starts in a simi− lar way to the above procedure, from the advanced Green’s functions G− 0 and G , cf. (1.8) and (1.9). For example, the state φf (x, t) corresponds to that wave function (−) ψf (x, t), which becomes φf (x, t) in the distant future (t → ∞) after the interaction V (x, t) has vanished (−)\n\nlim ψf (x, t) = φf (x, t) .\n\nt→∞\n\n(1.39)\n\nStarting from (1.9) we can formulate this boundary condition precisely (now the primed (x ′ , t ′ ) and unprimed (x, t) are exchanged): (−) ψf (x, t) =\n\nlim −i\n\nt ′ →∞\n\nd3 x ′ G− (x, t; x ′ , t ′ )φf (x ′ , t ′ ) .\n\n(1.40)\n\nWe expect the S-matrix element for the transition i → f , i.e. Sf i , to be given by the (−) scalar products of ψf (x, t) and φi (x, t), calculated at a time t in the distant past lim : t→−∞\n\n(−) ψf (x, t) φi (x, t) t→−∞ = lim ′lim i d3 xd3 x ′ G−∗ (x, t; x ′ , t ′ )φf∗ (x ′ , t ′ )φi (x, t) .\n\nSf i = lim\n\nt→−∞ t →∞\n\n(1.41)\n\n1.5\n\nApplication to Scattering Problems\n\nThe equivalence with the previous definition of the S matrix is indeed immediately proved by means of the relation G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = G−∗ (x, t; x ′ , t ′ )\n\n(1.42)\n\n(see Exercise 1.2), since then (1.41) becomes Sf i = lim ′lim i d3 xd3 x ′ G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)φf∗ (x ′ , t ′ )φi (x, t) t→−∞ t →∞\n\n= ′lim φf (x ′ , t ′ ) ψi(+) (x ′ , t ′ ) ,\n\n(1.43)\n\nt →∞\n\nwhich agrees with the first line of (1.37). Here it is of crucial importance that the potential is real, which was used in the derivation of Exercise 1.2. The fact that (1.41) does not equal (1.37) for a complex potential V is easily understood physically, since an absorptive potential (having a negative imaginary part of V (x, t)) causes a reduction in (+) the probability of finding the particle in a certain state. This means that |ψi (x ′ , t ′ )|2 for t ′ → ∞ is in general smaller than |φi (x, t)|2 for t → −∞, where φi is the state (+) (−) from which ψi originates. On the other hand, |ψf (x, t)|2 for t → −∞ is in gen(−) ′ ′ 2 ′ eral larger than |φf (x , t )| for t → ∞. Here φf is the state into which ψi (x, t) changes for t → ∞. Hence we expect that for absorptive potentials (1.41) is larger than (1.37). Let us finally remark that the S matrix instead of using (1.37) or (1.43) can also be expressed in the following symmetrical way (+) (−) Sf i = ψf (x, t) ψi (x, t) . (1.44) (+)\n\nSf i thus represents the overlap between the solutions ψi satisfying the incoming (−) and ψf satisfying the outgoing boundary condition. The result is independent of the moment in time t at which the overlap is evaluated.\n\nEXERCISE 1.2 Relation Between G+ and G− Problem. a) Show the validity of the relation G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = G−∗ (x, t; x ′ , t ′ ) . b) Prove the validity of (1.44). Solution. a) We start from the integral equation (1.30) for G+ . In complete analogy to its derivation from Schrödinger’s equation (cf. (1.10–1.19)) and considering the definition of G− in (1.8) and (1.9), we find the integral equation for G− which corresponds to (1.30), namely ′ ′ ′ − G− (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = G− (x , t ; x, t) + d4 x1 G− (1) 0 0 (x ; x1 )V (x1 )G (x1 , x) .\n\n15\n\n16\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nExercise 1.2\n\n− − Here the Green’s functions G+ and G+ 0 have obviously been replaced by G and G0 , respectively, in contrast to (1.30).

As above, we denote the free Green’s function by G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) and remark that, according to the defining relation (1.2), arbitrary wave packets ψ(x, t) develop in space and time corresponding to force free quantum-mechanical motion: ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = i d3 x G0 (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)ψ(x, t) . (1) Initially we want to derive a general expression for the Green’s function G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) in the case of an arbitrary time-independent potential V (x). Let us consider the complete and orthonormal set (UE (x ′ )) of eigensolutions of the stationary Schrödinger equation 2 ′ 2 − ∇ + V (x ′ ) UE (x ′ ) = EUE (x ′ ) . (2) 2m If the potential V (x ′ ) is time-independent, and provided that we know the solution of the following time-dependent Schrödinger equation ∂ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) 2 ′ 2 ′ i ∇ = − + V (x ) ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) (3) ∂t ′ 2m at a certain time t, we can write down a formal expression for the solution ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) at any time t ′ . To this end we expand ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) at time t ′ in terms of the basis of energy eigenfunctions UE (x ′ ), using the closure relation AE (t ′ )UE (x ′ ) , (4a) ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = E\n\nAE (t ′ ) =\n\nd3 x ′ UE∗ (x ′ )ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) .\n\n(4b)\n\nOf course, the expansion coefficients AE (t ′ ) are time dependent.

We obtain ψ(x ′ , t ′ ) = AE (t ′ )UE (x ′ ) E\n\n=\n\n=\n\nE\n\nAE (t) exp −iE(t ′ − t)/ UE (x ′ )\n\nd3 x\n\nE\n\nUE∗ (x)UE (x ′ ) exp −iE(t ′ − t)/ ψ(x, t) .\n\n(6)\n\nComparing (6) with (1) yields the eigenmode expansion of the Green’s function G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) = −i UE∗ (x)UE (x ′ ) exp −iE(t ′ − t)/ .\n\n(7)\n\nE\n\nt′\n\nFor = t the right-hand side becomes −iδ 3 (x ′ − x) according to the completeness relation for the states UE . Note that we derived the full Green’s function G and not just G0 , since the above expression is valid if any time-independent potential V (x) is present. As a special case for V = 0 we get the free Green’s function G0 if we insert the free stationary solutions (i.e. plane waves for UE (x).

The retarded and advanced Green’s functions are readily derived from (14) as follows: ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ G+ 0 (x , t ; x, t) = +G0 (x , t ; x, t)Θ(t − t) 3/2 im|x ′ − x|2 m exp Θ(t ′ − t) = −i 2πi(t ′ − t) 2(t ′ − t)\n\n(15)\n\nand ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ G− 0 (x , t ; x, t) = −G0 (x , t ; x, t)Θ(t − t ) 3/2 im|x ′ − x|2 m Θ(t − t ′ ) . = +i exp 2πi(t ′ − t) 2(t ′ − t)\n\n(16)\n\nThe relation −∗ ′ ′ ′ ′ G+ 0 (x , t ; x, t) = G0 (x, t; x , t )\n\n(17)\n\nfollows directly from (15) and (16). By the way, the result of Exercise 1.2 for the full Green’s functions follows straight from the expansion (7). In Example 1.5 we will get acquainted with the Green’s function for diffusion and notice that this function is equivalent to the above Green’s function (14) for the free motion of a quantum particle if we substitute t ′ → −it ′ , t → −it. This result is quite plausible because of the similarity between the diffusion equation and Schrödinger’s equation.\n\n20\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\n1.6 The Unitarity of the S Matrix An important property of the S matrix is its unitarity, provided that the Hamiltonian operator is hermitian. To prove this we have to show that Sˆ Sˆ † = 1 = Sˆ † Sˆ ,\n\n(1.45)\n\nwhere Sˆ = {Sik } denotes the full S matrix. We may use any of the above-discussed ˆ for the S matrix. In particular, we could base the proof on forms of Sf i = f |S|i (1.41), which was established with the advanced Green’s function G− . However, we + will use the form (1.37), where the retarded Green’s\n\nfunction G appears. An arbitrary † ˆ ˆ matrix element of S S then reads, inserting 1 = γ |γ γ | β Sˆ Sˆ † α = β Sˆ γ γ Sˆ † α γ\n\n∗ = β Sˆ γ α Sˆ γ γ\n\n= ′lim\n\nlim\n\nt →∞ t→−∞\n\n×\n\nγ\n\nd3 xd3 x ′ φβ ∗ (x ′ , t ′ )G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)φγ (x, t)\n\nd3 x ′′ d3 x ′′′ φα (x ′′ , t ′ )G+∗ (x ′′ , t ′ ; x ′′′ , t)φγ∗ (x ′′′ , t) .\n\nWe used S † = (S T )∗ , where T denotes transposition, and therefore γ |S † |α =\n\nα|S|γ ∗ . Furthermore, it is advantageous to use the same time arguments t ′ and t in the matrix elements of both Sˆ and Sˆ † , respectively. As previously mentioned, S matrix elements do not depend on these times in the limit t ′ → +∞, t → −∞, since the potential is assumed to decrease sufficiently fast. Since the φγ form a complete set of states, φγ (x, t)φγ∗ (x ′′′ , t) = δ 3 (x − x ′′′ ) , (1.46) γ\n\n(1.45) transforms into β Sˆ Sˆ † α = ′ lim\n\nlim\n\nt →+∞ t→−∞\n\nd3 xd3 x ′ d3 x ′′\n\n× φβ ∗ (x ′ , t ′ )G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t)G− (x, t; x ′′ , t ′ )φα (x ′′ , t ′ ) .\n\n(1.47)\n\nHere we have exploited (1.42). Since d3 x1 G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x 1 , t1 )G− (x 1 , t1 ; x ′′ , t ′ ) = δ 3 (x ′ − x ′′ ) (see Exercise 1.1), it follows that β Sˆ Sˆ † α = ′ lim d3 x ′ d3 x ′′ φβ ∗ (x ′ , t ′ )δ 3 (x ′ − x ′′ )φα (x ′′ , t ′ ) t →+∞\n\n= ′ lim\n\nt →+∞\n\n= δβα .\n\nd3 x ′ φβ ∗ (x ′ , t ′ )φα (x ′ , t ′ )\n\n(1.48)\n\n1.7\n\nSymmetry Properties of the S Matrix\n\nSimilarly one can show Sˆ † Sˆ = 1, which proves the unitarity of the S matrix.5 Of course, S † S = 1 can be deduced directly from SS † = 1, because S −1 SS † = S −1 and thus S † = S −1 , and in turn S −1 S = 1 = S † S.\n\n1.7 Symmetry Properties of the S Matrix The S matrix possesses symmetries that reflect the symmetries of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator. In this context we refer to the detailed discussion in Quantum Mechanics – Symmetries, 2nd rev. ed., by W. Greiner, B. Müller (Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1994). We recognized there that symmetry operations can be represented by unitary operators Uˆ which act on the states of the Hilbert space. Let Uˆ be such an operator, which transforms the state of a free particle φβ (x, t) into another state φβ ′ (x, t) = Uˆ φβ (x, t) .\n\n(1.49)\n\nThen φβ ′ has to describe a possible free motion of the particles in the system, too, since Uˆ commutes with Hˆ 0 . Moreover, if Uˆ also commutes with Hˆ , then the state ψα (+) is transformed into ψα ′ (+) by means of Uˆ : ψα ′ (+) (x, t) = Uˆ ψα (+) (x, t) ,\n\n(1.50)\n\nwhere ψα ′ (+) is also a possible state of the system including the interaction V (x, t). Indeed from ∂ i ψ (+) = Hˆ 0 + V ψ (+) ∂t\n\nfollows i\n\n∂ ˆ (+) = Uˆ Hˆ 0 + V ψ (+) = Hˆ 0 + V Uˆ ψ (+) , Uψ ∂t\n\nand therefore, Uˆ ψ (+) is also a possible state of the system. The plus sign (+) characterises the development of the state into the future. We now obtain for the S matrix element between such transformed states, according to (1.37): β ′ Sˆ α ′ = φβ ′ ψα ′ (+) = Uˆ φβ Uˆ ψα (+) = φβ Uˆ † Uˆ ψα (+) = φβ ψα (+) = β Sˆ α .\n\n(1.51)\n\n5 This proof of the unitarity of the S matrix rests on the assumption that the potential V (x) is switched on in the distant past and switched off in the distant future. The situation becomes more complicated if V (x) is completely constant in time. In this case one has to work with wave packets. The switching on or off of the potential is caused by the fact that the wave packet is beyond the range of influence of the potential, when it is in the distant past and distant future. Further complications arise because the Hamiltonian might possess bound states. In this case one can show that the wave packets are orthogonal to these bound states and the set of wave packets is not closed. However, one can nevertheless demonstrate the unitarity of the S matrix for real potentials V , since bound states cannot be occupied because of energy conservation (therefore they are also called “closed channels”). These problems are discussed in texts on the formal theory of scattering, see e.g. M.L. Goldberger and K.M. Watson: Scattering Theory of Waves and Particles (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1966).\n\n21\n\n22\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nThe limit t ′ → ∞ is implied for all these matrix elements. This equation means that the scattering amplitude between an arbitrary pair of states φα , φβ and caused by, e.g., a spherically symmetric potential is numerically identical with the scattering amplitude between the “rotated” states φα ′ = Uˆ φα and φβ ′ = Uˆ φβ . It is self-evident that both states have to be rotated by the same amount. If we explicitly insert the rotated states on the left-hand side of (1.51), we get (1.52) β Sˆ α = Uˆ φβ Sˆ Uˆ φα = β Uˆ † Sˆ Uˆ α = β Sˆ α , i.e.\n\nUˆ † Sˆ Uˆ = Sˆ\n\nor\n\n[ Uˆ , Sˆ ]− = 0\n\n(1.53)\n\nhas to be valid. We therefore have the important statement: if the symmetry transformation operator Uˆ commutes with Hˆ , then Uˆ also commutes with the Sˆ operator. For the anti-unitary operation of time-reversal6 Tˆ the situation is more complicated. The time-reversal operator Tˆ can be written as Tˆ = Uˆ Kˆ where Uˆ is a unitary operator and Kˆ stands for complex conjugation. Tˆ transforms a free state φβ (x, t) into another free state with reversed momentum and reversed angular momentum. The time-reversed state will be symbolically denoted by φ−β . However, one still has to pay attention to the fact that the operator Tˆ reverses the direction of time too, i.e. instead of (1.49) the transformation reads Tˆ φβ (x, t) = φ−β (x, −t) .\n\n(1.54)\n\nIf, for example, φβ (x, t) = N exp i(k β · x − ωβ t)\n\nis a plane wave for a spin-0 particle, then the state φ−β (x, t), according to (1.54), is given by φ−β (x, t) = N ∗ exp i(−k β · x − ωβ t) .\n\nNote that φ−β (x, t) = Tˆ φβ (x, t), but rather φ−β (x, t) = Tˆ φβ (x, −t). This follows immediately from (1.54). Now let us consider the case of the time-reversal operator commuting with the Hamiltonian operator, i.e. [ Tˆ , Hˆ ]− = 0 .\n\nFig. 1.5. A potential essentially constant in time, which is switched on and off at times ±t0\n\n(1.55)\n\nThen we speak of a time-reversal-invariant system. A simple example is a potential V (x) that is constant in time but is switched on and off at times −t0 and t0 , respectively, in a manner symmetrical in time (cf. Fig. 1.5). The time-reversal operator Tˆ then transforms the state ψα (+) (x, t) into another state that is also a possible state of motion of the system (because of its time-reversal invariance). This state will have reversed momentum and reversed angular momentum compared to ψα (+) . In the distant future it converges towards φ−α (x, −t), in contrast to ψα (+) (x, t), which originated from φα (x, t) in the distant past. We therefore call this time-reversed state 6\n\nSee W. Greiner, B. Müller: Quantum Mechanics – Symmetries, 2nd ed. (Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1994), Chap. 11 and W. Greiner: Relativistic Quantum Mechanics – Wave Equations, 3rd ed.

For a system invariant under time reversal and having a hermitian Hamiltonian, from (1.41): −α Sˆ − β = lim ψ−α (−) (x, t) φ−β (x, t) t→−∞\n\n= lim\n\nt→+∞\n\nψ−α (−) (x, −t) φ−β (x, −t)\n\n= lim Tˆ ψα (+) (x, t) Tˆ φβ (x, t) , t→∞\n\nbecause of (1.54) and (1.56), and using Tˆ = Uˆ Kˆ ˆ β (x, t) ˆ α (+) (x, t) Uˆ Kφ −α Sˆ − β = lim Uˆ Kψ t→∞\n\nˆ α (+) (x, t) Kφ ˆ β (x, t) = lim Kψ t→∞\n\n= lim φβ (x, t) ψα (+) (x, t) = β Sˆ α . t→∞\n\n(1.57)\n\nEquation (1.57) states that the scattering amplitude Sβα from an initial state |α into a final state |β is numerically equal to the scattering amplitude from state | − β (with momentum reversed compared to |β) into the state | − α (with momentum reversed as compared to |α). This is, of course, only valid if the system is invariant under time reversal, since only then are the states Tˆ ψα possible states of the system. The interesting relationship (1.57) is called the reciprocity theorem. One can even show its validity for complex potentials V (x, t).7\n\n1.8 The Green’s Function in Momentum Representation and Its Properties Until now we have emphasized the physical uses of the Green’s functions. Now we want to develop the mathematical apparatus for practical calculations. We aim first at a differential equation for the Green’s function and begin our discussion with the defining relation (1.7): (1.58) Θ(t ′ − t)ψ(x ′ ) = i d3 x G+ (x ′ ; x)ψ(x) , where x = {x0 , x} abbreviates the position 4-vector, and Θ(t ′ − t) is the step function introduced in (1.6). For further analysis it is useful to know the following integral 7\n\nCf., for example, L. Schiff: Quantum Mechanics, 3rd ed. (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1968), Chap. 20.\n\n23\n\n24\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nrepresentation of the step function: 1 Θ(τ ) = − lim 2πi ε→0\n\n∞\n\ndω\n\n−∞\n\ne−iωτ , ω + iε\n\n(1.59)\n\nwhich we prove in Exercise 1.4.\n\nEXERCISE 1.4 An Integral Representation for the Step Function Problem. Show that 1 Θ(τ ) = − lim 2πi ε→0\n\n∞\n\n−∞\n\ndω\n\ne−iωτ ω + iε\n\n(1)\n\nis an integral representation of Heaviside’s step function. Solution. We perform the ω-integral as a contour integral in the complex ω plane (Fig. 1.6). There is a pole of first order at ω = −iε. For τ < 0 we close the contour in the upper half plane, since the contribution from the upper, infinitely distant half circle vanishes in this case. With ω = ̺eiφ the integrand reads f (̺, φ) = Fig. 1.6. Integration contours for τ < 0 and τ > 0\n\n+̺τ sin φ e−iωτ e−i̺τ (cos φ+i sin φ) −i̺τ cos φ e = = e . ω ̺eiφ ̺eiφ\n\nFor τ < 0 the contribution from the upper half circle to the integral becomes smaller than π̺|f (̺, φ)| =\n\nπ̺e−̺τ sin φ →0 ̺\n\n(̺ → ∞) .\n\nAccording to Cauchy’s integral theorem the complete integral over the contour closed in the upper half plane thus vanishes, since the pole lies outside the region enclosed by the integration boundaries. In the case τ > 0 for similar reasons one can close the contour by means of an infinitely large half circle below the real axis. Then Cauchy’s integral theorem states that the residue of the integrand at the pole determines the value of the integral. The clockwise direction of integration leads to a minus sign. Therefore, we obtain −iωτ 1 e Θ(τ > 0) = − = e−iωτ |ω=0 = 1 . (2) (−1)2πi lim Res ε→0 2πi ω + iε ω=−iε\n\n1.8\n\nThe Green’s Function in Momentum Representation\n\nFrom this we get directly, by differentiating, dΘ(τ ) 1 =− lim dτ 2πi ε→0\n\n∞\n\n−∞\n\n=\n\n1 2π\n\n∞\n\n−∞\n\nd e−iωτ 1 dω = − lim dτ ω + iε 2πi ε→0\n\n∞\n\n−∞\n\n−iω −iωτ dω e ω + iε\n\ne−iωτ dω = δ(τ ) .\n\n(1.60)\n\nSo the derivative of the step function yields Dirac’s δ function. With the help of this relation one can specify a differential equation for the retarded Green’s function G+ (x ′ ; x) from (1.58) and deduce some of its other formal properties. We know that ψ(x ′ ) fulfills Schrödinger’s equation ∂ ′ ˆ (1.61) i ′ − H (x ) ψ(x ′ ) = 0 . ∂t Therefore, we apply the operator i(∂/∂t ′ ) − Hˆ (x ′ ) to (1.58) from the left and get ∂ i ′ − Hˆ (x ′ ) Θ(t ′ − t)ψ(x ′ ) ∂t ∂ 3 ′ ˆ = i d x i ′ − H (x ) G+ (x ′ ; x)ψ(x) . (1.62) ∂t The left-hand side is expanded to yield ∂ ∂ i ′ Θ(t ′ − t) ψ(x ′ ) + Θ(t ′ − t) i ′ − Hˆ (x ′ ) ψ(x ′ ) ∂t ∂t ∂ = i ′ Θ(t ′ − t) ψ(x ′ ) = iδ(t ′ − t)ψ(x ′ ) ∂t\n\n(1.63)\n\nso that (1.62) becomes ∂ ′ + ′ 3 ′ ′ 3 ˆ i d x i ′ − H (x ) G (x ; x) − δ (x − x)δ(t − t) ψ(x) = 0 . ∂t Since this equation has to be satisfied for arbitrary solutions ψ(x), the term in square brackets must vanish, i.e. ∂ ′ ˆ i ′ − H (x ) G+ (x ′ ; x) = δ 4 (x ′ − x) , (1.64) ∂t where we have replaced δ 3 (x ′ − x)δ(t ′ − t) by the four-dimensional δ function, δ 4 (x ′ − x). This differential equation determines, together with the boundary condition for propagation forward in time, the retarded Green’s function G+ (x ′ ; x): G+ (x ′ ; x) = 0 for\n\nt′ < t .\n\n(1.65)\n\nObviously the Green’s function is exactly the wave emitted from a point-like space– time source of strength δ 4 (x ′ − x) = δ 3 (x ′ − x)δ(t ′ − t) .\n\n25\n\n26\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nEquation (1.64) clearly illustrates how the Green’s function technique can be used to solve an inhomogeneous linear differential equation. Given the Schrödinger equation ∂ i − Hˆ (x) ψ(x) = ̺(x) , (1.66) ∂t with the source term ̺(x), we can immediately write down a solution 1 ψ(x) = ψ0 (x) + d4 x ′ G+ (x, x ′ )̺(x ′ ) for t > t ′ .\n\n(1.67)\n\nHere ψ0 (x) is a solution of the homogeneous differential equation. Let us now calculate once more the propagator for free particles, but this time with the help of the differential equation (1.64) and the boundary condition (1.65). For free, nonrelativistic particles the Hamiltonian is 2\n\nHˆ 0 (x ′ ) = − ∇ ′2 . 2m\n\n(1.68)\n\nIn addition we note that G0 + (x ′ ; x) will depend only on the difference of the coordinates, x ′ − x = {x ′ , t ′ } − {x, t}. This is because a wave emitted from the source at x at time t and arriving at x ′ at time t ′ depends only on the distance {x ′ − x, t ′ − t}. The Green’s function, however, is precisely such a wave. Thus we are able to write G0 + (x ′ ; x) = G0 + (x ′ − x) .\n\n(1.69)\n\nMathematically one readily appreciates this fact, since one can easily rewrite the differential equation analogous to (1.64) for the free propagator in a differential equation involving relative coordinates z = x ′ − x = {x ′ − x, t ′ − t}, because the Hamiltonian operator Hˆ 0 is homogeneous in spatial and time coordinates. To proceed with the solution of (1.64) for free particles we consider the Fourier representation G0 + (x ′ − x) =\n\nd3 p dE i ′ p · (x − x) exp (2π)4 i ′ × exp − E(t − t) G0 + (p; E)\n\n(1.70)\n\nand determine with (1.68) and (1.64) the relation for the Fourier transform G0 + (p; E):\n\n∂ 2 ′2 i ′ + ∇ G0 + (x ′ − x) ∂t 2m 3 p2 i i d pdE ′ ′ + G E − (p; E) exp − = exp − t) − x) E(t p · (x 0 2m (2π)4 3 d p dE i i ! (1.71) = exp − E(t ′ − t) exp p · (x ′ − x) . 4 (2π)\n\nThe last term is the right-hand side of (1.64), i.e. δ 4 (x ′ − x) in energy–momentum representation. Obviously one can immediately give the solution of the differential\n\n1.8\n\nThe Green’s Function in Momentum Representation\n\n27\n\nequation (1.64) in Fourier representation. For E = p 2 /2m one obtains G0 + (p; E) =\n\nE−\n\np2 2m\n\n(1.72)\n\n.\n\nThis expression is still incomplete, since the treatment of the singularity at E = p2 /2m has not yet been determined. This is done using the retardation condition (1.65). We proceed as in Exercise 1.4 with the Fourier representation of the step function and add an infinitesimal, positive imaginary part iε to the denominator of (1.72) and perform first of all the E integration in (1.70). As illustrated in Fig. 1.7 the singularity then lies below the real E axis. We obtain d3 p i ′ p · (x − x) exp G0 + (x ′ − x) = (2π)3 ×\n\n∞\n\n−∞\n\n% $ i ′ − t) E(t exp − dE . 2π E − p 2 /2m + iε\n\n(1.73)\n\nWith the substitution E ′ = E − p 2 /2m the last integral changes into $ % i ′ + p 2 /2m)(t ′ − t) ∞ ′ exp − (E dE 2π E ′ + iε −∞\n\n% $ i ′ ′ ∞ i p2 ′ dE ′ exp − E (t − t) = exp − (t − t) 2m E ′ + iε −∞ 2π\n\n′ t −t i p2 ′ i (t − t) − Θ = exp − 2m i p2 ′ i (t − t) Θ(t ′ − t) . = − exp − 2m In the last two steps we have exploited (1.59) and the property of the step function that Θ(αx) = Θ(x) for positive α. Now (1.73) transforms into d3 p p2 ′ i + ′ ′ (t − t) Θ(t ′ − t) G0 (x − x) = −i p · (x − x) − exp 2m (2π)3 = −iΘ(t ′ − t)\n\nd3 p φp (x ′ , t ′ )φp ∗ (x, t) .\n\n(1.74)\n\nHere we have denoted the eigenfunctions of the free Hamiltonian Hˆ 0 , i.e. the plane waves, by p2 1 i p·x − t φp (x, t) = exp 2m (2π)3 =\n\n1\n\n(2π)3\n\nexp i(k · x − ωt) , ω = p 2 /2m , k = p .\n\n(1.75)\n\nFig. 1.7. The position of the singularity of G+ (p; E) and the integration contour along the E axis\n\n28\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nEquation (1.74) is identical with the result of Example 1.3, (9) and (15). Further evaluation of the integral (1.74) proceeds then as above. From this example we realize how useful it is to express the Green’s function as a sum over a complete set of eigenfunctions of the corresponding Schrödinger equation. For such a set of functions ψn (x, t) the closure relation reads ψn (x ′ , t)ψn∗ (x, t) = δ 3 (x ′ − x) . (1.76) n\n\nNote that the same time t appears in ψn (x ′ , t) and in ψn∗ (x, t). Now one can easily verify that (1.64) together with boundary condition (1.65) is solved by G+ (x ′ ; x) = −iΘ(t ′ − t)\n\nψn∗ (x)ψn (x ′ ) ,\n\n(1.77)\n\nn\n\nsince ∂ ′ ˆ i ′ − H (x ) G+ (x ′ ; x) = δ(t ′ − t) ψn (x ′ , t)ψn∗ (x, t) ∂t n − iΘ(t ′ − t)\n\nn\n\ni\n\n= δ(t ′ − t)δ 3 (x ′ − x)\n\n∂ ˆ (x ′ ) ψn (x ′ ) ψn∗ (x) − H ∂t ′\n\n=0\n\n= δ 4 (x ′ − x) .\n\n(1.78)\n\nNext, we point out another important relationship: the same Green’s function G+ (x ′ ; x) that describes the evolution of a solution ψn (x, t) of Schrödinger’s equation forward in time also describes the propagation of the complex-conjugate solution ψn∗ (x, t) backward in time. From (1.77) we obtain on the one hand 3 + ′ ′ ′ ∗ ψm (x ) d3 xψm (x)ψn (x) i d x G (x ; x)ψn (x) = Θ(t − t)\n\nm δnm\n\n= Θ(t ′ − t)ψn (x ′ )\n\n(1.79a)\n\nand on the other hand ∗ 3 ′ ∗ ′ + ′ ′ (x) i d x ψn (x )G (x ; x) = Θ(t − t) d3 x ′ ψm (x ′ )ψn∗ (x ′ ) ψm\n\nm δnm\n\n= Θ(t ′ − t)ψn∗ (x) .\n\n(1.79b)\n\nAs stated above, (1.79a) expresses the propagation of ψn (x) forward in time and (1.79b) the corresponding backward propagation of ψn∗ (x ′ ). The latter results may also be obtained by complex conjugating (1.9) and using Exercise 1.2. Conversely, starting from (1.9) and (1.79b) one easily proves the relations between G+ and G−\n\n1.9\n\nAnother Look at the Green’s Function\n\noutlined in Exercise 1.2. The following steps verify this statement: (1.79b) can be written as Θ(t ′ − t)ψn∗ (x) = i d3 x ′ G+ (x ′ ; x)ψn∗ (x ′ ) . Complex conjugation yields Θ(t ′ − t)ψn (x) = −i d3 x ′ G+∗ (x ′ ; x)ψn (x ′ ) ≡ −i d3 x ′ G− (x; x ′ )ψn (x ′ ) , and therefore, G− (x; x ′ ) = G+∗ (x ′ ; x).\n\n(1.79c)\n\n1.9 Another Look at the Green’s Function for Interacting Particles Here we want to reconsider the iteration method for the Green’s function G+ (x ′ ; x) (cf. (1.28)) from a slightly different point of view. The starting point of our present discussion is the differential equation (1.64) for G+ (x ′ ; x), which can be formulated with Hˆ = Hˆ 0 + V : ∂ ′ ˆ i ′ − H0 (x ) G+ (x ′ ; x) = δ 4 (x ′ − x) + V (x ′ )G+ (x ′ ; x) . (1.80) ∂t The right-hand side can be interpreted as the source term in an inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation as in (1.66): ∂ ′ ˆ (1.81) i ′ − H0 (x ) ψ(x ′ ) = ̺(x ′ ) . ∂t Using the free Green’s function G0 the solution of (1.81) is given by 1 ′ ′ ψ(x ) = d4 x1 G+ 0 (x ; x1 )̺(x1 ) .\n\n(1.82)\n\nReplacing ψ(x ′ ) by G+ (x ′ , x) this leads immediately to the following integral equation for the interacting Green’s function ′ 4 + G+ (x ′ ; x) = d4 x1 G+ (x ; x ) δ (x − x) + V (x )G (x ; x) 1 1 1 1 0 ′ = G+ 0 (x ; x) +\n\n′ + d4 x1 G+ 0 (x ; x1 )V (x1 )G (x1 ; x) .\n\n(1.83)\n\nHere we again replaced V (x)/ → V (x) as in (1.21). Equation (1.83) is identical with our earlier result (1.30); it is the Lippmann–Schwinger equation. The iteration of (1.83) leads to the multiple scattering expansion (1.28) for the Green’s function. This can be used to construct the S matrix (1.37) Sf i = lim ′ lim i d3 x ′ d3 xφf∗ (x ′ )G+ (x ′ ; x)φi (x) .

For example, a fluid of density ̺(x, t) tends to flow from a point, where the density is high, towards a region of low density. The current J is therefore assumed to be proportional to the gradient of the density: J = −D∇̺ ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the constant D is called the diffusion constant. If we combine (1) with the continuity equation ∂̺ = −∇ · J , ∂t\n\n(2)\n\nwe obtain the diffusion equation ∂̺ = D∇ 2 ̺ . ∂t\n\n(3)\n\nIn the case of heat conduction, ̺ is the “heat contents” per unit volume and is proportional to the temperature: ̺ = CT . The constant C is the specific heat capacity of the material. For later considerations we note that the transformation t → −it changes the diffusion equation (3) into a differential equation of Schrödinger type.\n\n1.9\n\nAnother Look at the Green’s Function\n\n31\n\nNow we want to construct explicitly the Green’s function G+ (x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) of the diffusion in an infinite three-dimensional region. Again we start with the defining differential equation\n\nExample 1.5\n\n∇ ′2 G − a 2\n\n∂G = −4π δ 3 (x ′ − x) δ(t ′ − t) , ∂t ′\n\n(4)\n\nwith the constants a 2 = 1/D. The factor 4π on the right-hand side (instead of as in (1.64)) is a matter of convention. This changes the Green’s function only by a factor of 4π/. Since the Green’s function depends only on the time difference t ′ − t and the spatial difference x ′ − x, we introduce the following abbreviations: τ = t′ − t ,\n\nR = x′ − x .\n\n(5)\n\nAs an ansatz for the Green’s function we write down the Fourier transform 1 ′ ′ ′ G(x , t ; x, t) = d3 p eip·(x −x) g(p, τ ) , (2π)3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the function g(p, τ ) is not yet known. We insert (6) into the defining equation (4) and once again use the following three-dimensional Fourier representation of the δ function: 1 δ 3 (R) = (7) d3 p eip·R . (2π)3 The left-hand side of (4) becomes 1 ∂G 2 2 ∂g 3 ip·R ∇ ′2 G − a 2 −p . = g − a d p e ∂τ ∂τ (2π)3\n\n(8)\n\nThis results in a differential equation in time for g: a2\n\n∂g + p 2 g = 4π δ(τ ) . ∂τ\n\n(9)\n\nThis differential equation has the following causal solution: g=\n\n4π −(p2 τ/a 2 ) e Θ(τ ) . a2\n\n(10)\n\nTo prove this we insert solution (10) into (9) and use the relation dΘ(τ ) = δ(τ ) dτ\n\n(11)\n\nbetween the step function Θ and the δ function: a2\n\n4π a2\n\n+ p2\n\n−p 2 a2\n\ne−(p\n\n2 τ/a 2 )\n\nΘ(τ ) + a 2\n\n4π −(p2 τ/a 2 ) dΘ e dτ a2\n\n4π −(p2 τ/a 2 ) e Θ(τ ) = 4πδ(τ ) . a2\n\n(12)\n\n32\n\n1.\n\nPropagators and Scattering Theory\n\nExample 1.5\n\nSummarizing, we get G(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) =\n\np2 τ 4π 3 Θ(τ ) d p exp(ip · R) exp − (2π)3 a 2 a2\n\n(13)\n\nor explicitly in Cartesian coordinates ′\n\n′\n\nG(x , t ; x, t) =\n\n∞ 4π ′ 2 2 dpx eipx (x −x) e−(px /a )τ Θ(τ ) (2π)3 a 2\n\n−∞\n\n×\n\n∞\n\ndpy e\n\nipy (y ′ −y) −(py2 /a 2 )τ\n\ne\n\n∞\n\n′\n\n2\n\ndpz eipz (z −z) e−(pz /a\n\n2 )τ\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\n−∞\n\n−∞\n\nLet us consider the exponent in the first integral: ipx Rx −\n\npx2 px √ iaRx 2 a 2 Rx2 τ = − τ − − √ 2 a 4τ a 2 τ =−\n\nτ 2 a 2 Rx2 , ξ − 2 4τ a\n\n(15)\n\nwith ξ = px −\n\nia 2 Rx . 2τ\n\n(16)\n\nWith this transformation the first integral in (14) can be rewritten as ∞\n\n−∞\n\n2 2 ∞ τ ξ 2 a 2 Rx2 a Rx τξ2 dpx = exp − dpx exp − 2 − dξ exp − 2 4τ 4τ a a −∞\n\n= exp −\n\na 2 Rx2 4τ\n\na\n\nπ . τ\n\n(17)\n\nIn the derivation for the result (17) we have exploited the following elementary Gaussian integration formula: ∞\n\n−∞\n\n√ π . dx exp(−p x ) = p 2 2\n\n(18)\n\nAfter performing all three integrals of (14) we obtain the Green’s function for diffusion 3\n\n2 2 a R exp − 4τ 2 2 a a R Θ(τ ) . = 3/2 √ exp − 4τ 2τ π\n\nG(x ′ , t ′ ; x, t) =\n\n1 Θ(τ ) 2π 2 a 2\n\na\n\nπ τ\n\n(19)\n\nRemember: τ = t ′ −t according to (5).

The Green’s function for diffusion has a Gaussian shape with a maximum at R = 0. The width of the distribution grows with increasing τ . The quantity 4τ/a 2 is a measure of this width. For τ = 0 the width is still zero. In the case of heat conduction this means that all the heat is focussed at a point. As soon as τ becomes larger than zero, the temperature increases at R > 0 while it decreases continuously at R = 0. Eventually (for τ → ∞) the heat is uniformly distributed over the whole space.\n\nExercise 1.6\n\nEXAMPLE 1.6 Kirchhoff’s Integral as an Example of Huygens’ Principle in Electrodynamics We start our examination with the solution of the wave equation in classical electrodynamics and the derivation of the corresponding Green’s function.

To solve (8) it is useful to introduce the Green’s function G for the wave equation which is defined by 1 ∂2 2 ∇ x − 2 2 G(x, t; x ′ , t ′ ) = −4πδ 3 (x − x ′ )δ(t − t ′ ) . (9) c ∂t The Green’s function depends only on the difference of the coordinates (x − x ′ ) and times (t − t ′ ). In further calculations we use the δ function in the Fourier representation: 1 ′ ′ 3 3 ′ ′ δ (x − x )δ(t − t ) = d k dω eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t ) . (10) (2π)4 First, we introduce the Fourier transform ′ ′ G(x, t; x ′ , t ′ ) = d3 k dω g(k, ω) eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t )\n\n(11)\n\nas an ansatz for G, where g(k, ω) is not yet known. We insert the transform (11) into the defining equation (9) to obtain 1 ∂2 ′ ′ 2 ∇x − 2 2 d3 k dω g(k, ω) eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t ) c ∂t 1 ′ ′ 3 = −4π d k dω eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t ) . (12) (2π)4 Application of the differential operators yields ω2 ′ ′ 3 2 − d k dω k − 2 g(k, ω) eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t ) c 1 ′ ′ = − 3 d3 k dω eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t ) . 4π\n\n(13)\n\nHence, g(k, ω) is determined as g(k, ω) =\n\n1 1 , 4π 3 k 2 − ω2 /c2 − iε\n\nand we can express the Green’s function as 1 1 ′ ′ ′ ′ 3 G(x, t; x , t ) = d k dω 3 2 eik·(x−x ) e−iω(t−t ) . 2 2 4π k − ω /c − iε\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nUsing Cauchy’s theorem the integrals can be solved in closed form with the result G(x, t; x ′ , t ′ ) =\n\nδ(t ′ − t + |x − x ′ |/c) . |x − x ′ |\n\n(16)\n\nThis is the retarded Green’s function which describes the propagation of a wave on the light cone |x ′ − x| = c(t ′ − t) forward in time, t > t ′ . Causality was enforced by intro-\n\n1.9\n\nAnother Look at the Green’s Function\n\n35\n\nducing the negative imaginary part −iε in (14). The solution of the wave equation (8) can now be written as Ψ (x, t) = d3 x ′ dt ′ G(x, t; x ′ , t ′ ) f (x ′ , t ′ ) .
