This document provides an analysis of Jun Ishiwara's 1915 paper \"The universal meaning of the quantum of action\". It begins with a brief biography of Ishiwara, noting that he was educated at Tokyo Imperial University and became an assistant professor at Sendai University in 1911. The document then discusses the context around the \"old quantum theory\" and contributions from Planck, Bohr, Wilson, Sommerfeld, and Ishiwara regarding phase space quantization. It aims to make Ishiwara's originally German paper accessible and analyze his approach in comparison to his contemporaries.",
