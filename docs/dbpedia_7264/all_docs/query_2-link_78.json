        "text": "Early Years\n\nPaul Dirac was born at his parents' home in Bristol, England, on 8 August 1902. His father, Charles A. Dirac, a French teacher, was an immigrant from Saint-Maurice, Switzerland. His mother, Florence Hannah Dirac, née Holten, the daughter of a ship's captain from Cornwall, England. Paul had a younger sister Betty, and an older brother, Charles \"Felix\" who committed suicide in March, 1925. The family were officially Swiss nationals until they became naturalised in 1919. Dirac's father was strict and authoritarian and Paul had a strained relationship with him. Charles forced his children to speak to him only in French, in order that they learn the language. When Dirac found that he could not express what he wanted to say in French, he chose to remain silent.\n\nEducation\n\nPaul Dirac was educated first at Bishop Road Primary School and then at the all-boys Merchant Venturers' Technical College. Dirac studied electrical engineering at the University of Bristol. He later attended Cambridge Univerity's St John's College where he pursued his interests in the theory of general relativity and quantum physics, under the supervision of Ralph Fowler. He completed his PhD in June 1926 with the first thesis on quantum mechanics to be submitted anywhere. He then continued his research in Copenhagen and Göttingen.\n\nCareer\n\nDirac's first step into quantum theory was taken late in September 1925 as a graduate student where he developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to a more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics. For this work, published in 1926, he received a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. In 1928, building on 2×2 spin matrices he proposed the Dirac equation as a relativistic equation of motion for the wave function of the electron. This work led Dirac to predict the existence of the positron, the electron's antiparticle. Later the positron was observed by Carl Anderson in 1932. Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of quantum spin as a relativistic phenomenon. Dirac is regarded as the founder of quantum electrodynamics, being the first to use that term. He also introduced the idea of vacuum polarisation in the early 1930s. This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, and in particular Schwinger, Feynman, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Dyson in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics. In 1933, following his 1931 paper on magnetic monopoles, Dirac showed that the existence of a single magnetic monopole in the universe would suffice to explain the observed quantization of electrical charge. Most of his career was as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge from 1932 to 1969. After retiring from Cambridge University he moved to Florida where he spent the last fourteen years of his life at the University of Miami in Coral Gables and Florida State University in Tallahassee.\n\nDirac's book Principles of Quantum Mechanics, published in 1930, is a landmark in the history of science. During World War II, he conducted important theoretical and experimental research on uranium enrichment by gas centrifuge. Dirac had traveled extensively and studied at various foreign universities, including Copenhagen, Göttingen, Leyden, University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, and Princeton University.\n\nAccomplishments\n\n-- Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Electrodynamics, Quantum Field Theory, Dirac Equation, Antimatter, Magnetic Monopoles --\n\n.Paul Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in quantum mechanics. He established the most general theory of quantum mechanics and discovered the relativistic equation for the electron, which now bears his name. The remarkable notion of an antiparticle to each fermion particle  e.g. the positron as antiparticle to the electron  stems from his equation. He was the first to develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or \"elementary\" particles today, work that is fundamental to our understanding of the forces of nature. He proposed and investigated the concept of a magnetic monopole, an object not yet known empirically, as a means of bringing even greater symmetry to James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. He quantized the gravitational field, and developed a general theory of quantum field theories with dynamical constraints, which forms the basis of the gauge theories and superstring theories of today. The influence and importance of his work has increased with the decades, and physicists daily use the concepts and equations that he developed."
