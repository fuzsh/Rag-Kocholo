        "text": "\"Every second of every day, nuclear weapons endanger everyone we love and everything we hold dear.\" Setsuko Thurlow (pictured) was just 13 when the atomic bomb was dropped on her home town of Hiroshima. She survived the blast but many others didn't. Today she campaigns against nuclear weapons, and in 2017 she jointly accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), who were awarded the prize for campaigning for a nuclear weapon-free world. See Thurlow's Nobel Peace Prize speech: https://lnkd.in/eXmmgf9 #InternationalDayagainstNuclearTests\n\nOne of the most striking differences between immunotherapy and other cancer treatments is that it offers patients the potential of permanent protection against a cancer taking hold again thanks to the ability of memory T cells to “remember” the cancer’s identity long after the disease has been eliminated. Learn more about the science behind immunotherapy; a fourth pillar of cancer treatment invented by medicine laureates James Allison and Tasuku Honjo that is used alongside radiation, chemotherapy and surgery: https://lnkd.in/gv9rBfzg\n\n“My mother suffered from diabetes from a very early age. As a child, she was told that she could not have children, would become blind, and eventually be amputated. Although she suffered from the consequences of this life-long disease, none of the predictions came true, thanks to progress in science and medicine. This left me with a strong belief in the power of research and science.” – Anne L’Huillier. L'Huillier was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 2023 for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.

In a science laboratory 2km underground in a mine outside Sudbury, Ontario, in Canada, McDonald was able to show that the ghostly neutrino particles have mass. The facility, called SNOLAB specialised in neutrino and dark matter physics. The photo depicts Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) solar neutrino experiment, a detector facility using 1000 tonnes of heavy water situated at SNOLAB. Here physicists studied neutrinos created in nuclear reactions in the sun. In 2000, measurements showed deviations, which were explained by the neutrinos switching between the different types. This meant that neutrinos must have mass. McDonald shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics with physicist Takaaki Kajita for discovering that neutrinos have mass.

Cassin helped draw up the UN Charter in the wake of World War II and became involved in the struggle for human rights, serving as a member of the first UN Commission on Human Rights, established in 1946, which was headed by Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His outstanding legal expertise enabled him to play a major role in the drafting of the Declaration. Read more about his work: https://lnkd.in/g7Z_gA6j\n\nWhy is there a Nobel Prize? It’s all because of Alfred Nobel. The Nobel Prize was set up when businessman and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel died and left most of his fortune to the establishment of prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. His will stated that the prizes should be awarded to “those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.” Find out more about the establishment of the Nobel Prizes: https://bit.ly/2o3eoxy #NobelPrize\n\n\"I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\". #OnThisDay, 28 August 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke these immortal words to a crowd of over 200,000 people who gathered for the now historic March on Washington to demand an end to racial segregation in the USA and equality in jobs and civil rights. King began his speech by referencing the Emancipation Proclamation, which had declared millions of enslaved African Americans free 100 years prior. Originally, King had only prepared a short speech. Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text and partly improvised the most well-known part of his speech, where he dreams of freedom and equality.

He quickly became intrigued by what machines could accomplish and be used for. During the 1960s, Hounsfield developed an apparatus in which clusters of X-ray beams are sent through the body from different angles and registered when they have passed the body. Through advanced computer calculations based on the measurement data, three-dimensional images of different cross-sections of the body are created. The CT or CAT scan was born. The first CT scan of a live patient took place on 1 October 1971, and commercially available CT scanners appeared in 1972. By 1980, CT scans were widely available. In 2020, it was estimated that hundreds of millions of CT scans occur each year. Godfrey Hounsfield shared the 1979 medicine prize with Allan Cormack \"for the development of computer assisted tomography (CAT).\" Read more: https://bit.ly/2LIOvMW\n\n”This country is on fire - they are celebrating from the President even down to the children in the rural areas. Everybody feels very honored. It is not my own prize. I am told that even the whole of Africa is celebrating.” Twenty years ago Wangari Maathai was in Nairobi, Kenya, when she spoke to us shortly after hearing the news of her Nobel Peace Prize. Even though it was a very bad phone line, her happiness after the announcement could be heard! Maathai spoke about how those involved in her work would be encouraged by the recognition and know what they were doing was extremely important not only in Africa but throughout the world. She told us how she had received congratulations from practically all over the world. Who will be getting the call this year? Stay tuned! #NobelPeacePrize\n\n\"As a child, I wanted to be a physicist. I begged my mother to let me go to Tokyo to study physics. I promised I would win the Nobel Prize in Physics. So, 50 years later, I returned to my village and said to my mother, 'See, I have kept my promise. I won the Nobel Prize.' 'No,' said my mother, who has a very fine sense of humour, 'You promised it would be in physics!'\" - Kenzaburō Ōe, awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature. On Thursday 10 October we will find out who has been awarded the 2024 literature prize, which writer(s) do you think will receive the award this year?
