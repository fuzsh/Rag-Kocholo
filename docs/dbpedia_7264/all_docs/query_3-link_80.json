Please note that conferences under Category C only receive IUPAP endorsement without financial sponsorship. If you have not already done so, you are kindly requested to submit to the IUPAP secretariat a list of women who will be participating in your conference both in the organizing committees and as invited speakers at conference sessions. The submitted list should also include the total number of invited conference speakers. Please note that submission of such statistics is necessary in order for us to do a global assessment of the participation of women at events supported by the IUPAP. You will in due course receive formal correspondence from the IUPAP administrator Ms Williamina Lazaro (Williamina.Lazaro@iop.org). We wish you in advance a successful conference event. With kindest regards Rudzani Nemutudi (Associate Secretary General: IUPAP) Female ratio: > 20% This is true for ARIS when IUPAP sponsorship was requested."
