        "text": "Historical start dates of nuclear projects:\n\nManhattan Project: 1939\n\nTube Alloys: 1940 (when the Paris Group moved to Britain)\n\nNi-Go: 1939\n\nPerveya Molniya: 1940\n\nUranverein: 1939\n\nTimeline of nuclear fission development up to realization of weapons potential\n\n1913: Bohr model of the atom\n\n1932: Neutron discovered\n\n1933: Nuclear chain reaction idea proposed\n\n1934: Uranium bombarded with neutrons, barium found in results\n\n1938: Results of neutron bombardment interpreted as nuclear fission\n\n1939: Experimental confirmation of nuclear fission and chain reaction potential, Einstein-Szilard letter written\n\nIs it really impossible for a few of these discoveries to be pushed back a year or two, leading to experimental confirmation of fission and the start of research by the 30s? The Ames process was discovered in 1942, which allowed production of pure uranium, and that didn't exactly involve any process more technologically advanced then a really tough steel casing. Plus, as I mentioned, there's the millions of young men who WW1 claimed, a dozen of which could easily live and become physicists.\n\nIt's not that the science can't be pushed up; it's that not ALL of the major powers are going to be right at that stage of the project at the same time. If you want front-runners, I could see the UK and Germany having advanced projects and the US being in a position to catch up quickly when they pay attention, as IOTL. German and British projects would be slowed by mutual bombing attacks on the generation capacity needed to keep running major nuclear projects, so the US would have a chance to get to parity or even ahead. The Soviets and the Japanese simply aren't going to have advanced nuclear programs at this stage; without interference, Japan IOTL may have detonated a device in a decade, maybe more, while the Soviets (sans espionage) wouldn't have had one until at least 1952-53, if then. There's going to be a similar margin of superiority IOTL unless your POD is to make on of their leaders pay special attention to nuclear research. If you're just accelerating the early days of research to see what happens, the USSR and Japan will still be drastically behind.\n\nIt's not that the science can't be pushed up; it's that not ALL of the major powers are going to be right at that stage of the project at the same time.

Regarding your point of power generation, I'm positing that development begins in the early 1930s, which gives us 6-7 years of peace to work with. Given that, do British and German bombs by the Fall of France and an American bomb by Barbarossa sound plausible?\n\nMy thoughts are that the Soviet Union, out of simple paranoia of the capitalists with these new-fangled weapons, Five-Year Plans it and after a couple of unfortunate accidents has a working device by Stalingrad, while Japan hears about this \"kamikaze in a can\" and is determined to wield it, developing a usable weapon by late 1941 (I just want a mushroom cloud over Battleship Row ). IOTL, the Soviet program really kicked into gear by 1942, and they had a bomb seven years later, which does show that the People's Bomb is possible within a decade. How's that?\n\nFair enough, and I agree with your assessments of nuclear potential.

IOTL, the Soviet program really kicked into gear by 1942, and they had a bomb seven years later, which does show that the People's Bomb is possible within a decade. How's that?\n\nStill pretty borderline, if you ask me. For starters, you'd better have a very good butterfly net if you want WWII to unfold in the same way; if every power knows the others are working on nuclear weapons, they'll either refrain from war or declare war to try to keep the other side from getting the bomb in the first place.\n\nAnyway, for a timeline that assumes war breaks out as IOTL... it's hard to know exactly what level of effort each project would have attracted; the Manhattan Project was an all-out wartime effort; anything it wanted, it did get, almost without fail, and it pursued every avenue of research that was discovered. Not even the United States will do this in peacetime, and I doubt that Germany or the UK can even afford to. So we can assume that any bomb programs will focus on a uranium gun-type device out of necessity.\n\nIf we say that the UK starts its program in, say, 1933, at the same level as Tube Alloy started IOTL, and gradually throw more and more funding towards them as Europe accelerates towards war, then I think a decent estimate for their arriving at a bomb is 1940. This is, again, a rough guess. I couldn't see Germany beginning a program until the occupation of the Rhineland, so call it 1936. If they manage to take advantage of their physicists and push it hard, they could get one in 1942, maybe 1941 (probably not). This assumes that they don't do what they did IOTL and politicize the entire project. The United States won't start a program until they notice that the other two have done so or the British give them a good, thorough kick in the pants. Call it 1936, just after the German program begins. If they start one at all, they'll kick it into high gear quickly, given that it offers a huge advantage over Japan. I'd say that a decent estimate is sometime after the British bomb, but before a German one. They have resources and are collecting scientists as quickly as the Germans kick them out.\n\nAs for the Soviets, I cannot see them being able to devote major effort to a bomb before 1940... if you choose to butterfly the Purges to some degree, you can probably get a half-hearted effort in 1938. The saving grace for them is that the NKVD and the KGB are good. Very good. They can probably, as IOTL, steal secrets from the Americans, the British, and the Germans to speed things up. A date isn't something I would care to guess at, but I suspect the British would help things along after Barbarossa kicks off. Japan... I doubt they get a bomb before the 1940's are through. They lack the manpower, the scientific or research base, the electrical generation, in short, they have NOTHING that they can use to design and build a bomb without outside assistance and a lot of it.\n\nNow, again, you have to remember... this involves a major butterfly-netting expedition. There is almost NO way, in reality, that WWII would start in the same way. I suspect that one of two things would happen: Either no war occurs as all sides hold one another's major cities hostage, or Britain and France bite the bullet, declare war over the Sudetenland because they know Germany cannot possibly have a bomb yet and they're not far away, and crush them utterly. As for the Pacific, Japan would have no choice but to sit down and shut up, with both the Americans and the British sitting on superbombs. There's almost no chance that WWII occurs in recognizable form if you push this research this far up.\n\n'49, '48, more or less the same.\n\nLol. From what I've read, they got a few key advances from us that pushed up their bomb from, as I said, the early 50's, to '49. Could be wrong, of course.\n\nWell, the prevailing attitude of the 1940s and 50s towards nuclear bombs was a \"big bomb\" sort of deal, rather like the world's reaction to HMS Dreadnought, so I don't see MAD stopping WW2. Besides, both sides already had two sides of the WMD triangle, and if being able to depopulate Berlin or London with toxins wasn't going to stop the train, being able to blow them to kingdom come probably wouldn't have either. Our attitudes towards the bomb are forged from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Without those warnings, we'd be a lot more cavalier with atomics, just as we were so flagrant with chemical weapons in WW1.\n\nYour points re. British - agreed, is cooperation between them and France likely?\n\nGermany - I had a thought. What if Hitler starts getting his hourly glucose shots and whatnot from that crazy hack earlier and starts going off on the Wunderwaffe angle as soon as he's elected, with a nuclear program by 1934-35? After all, there's no treaty saying Germany can't have atomic bombs. Further posit that as he's less and less capable of leading the Third Reich, a under-the-table power struggle breaks out, with more pragmatic elements taking control. This tones down the persecution of Jews, which advances the German bomb at the same time as delaying the American one. German loyalty holds firm through the crises of OTL, until the Fuhrer dies of a heart attack (considering that the cocktail he was taking made Jagerbombs look like a drink for old ladies, I'm surprised he didn't keel over of one OTL) around, say...the Battle of Moscow. That'll let him get Germany well and stuck in with everybody, and now the Heer has to get about its business. Would that give the Luftwaffe a bomb by Barbarossa?\n\nUnited States - the American public, I think, could be sold on the bomb as a further extension of isolationism, just like battleships and bombers. \"Millions for defense, not a cent for tribute\" is an American quote, and the bomb's publicity could be as the ultimate guarantor of American safety. Call its start point a few months after Germany starts its - 1935.\n\nSoviet Union - if we take OTL's seven years, tack on an extra for political issues, and set the bomb date as 1943, we get a 1935 start date. I'm thinking that the KGB gets a hold of information suggesting the start of British, German, and American nuclear projects one after the other, making Stalin very nervous. Given that historically Stalin did recognize exactly what was needed (his letter to the Shturmovnik factory), this doesn't seem too ASB.\n\nJapan - but I just want a nuclear Pearl Harbour is it plausible for the Germans to start sending them research after the formation of the Axis, and get them a bomb diagram by early 1941? There's uranium in Liaoning Province in China, so if the IJA doesn't push south as hard, they could secure the mine well enough.\n\nJapan - but I just want a nuclear Pearl Harbour is it plausible for the Germans to start sending them research after the formation of the Axis, and get them a bomb diagram by early 1941? There's uranium in Liaoning Province in China, so if the IJA doesn't push south as hard, they could secure the mine well enough.\n\nThe rest of this is a stretch, but IMO not entirely ASB. So go for it. There is no way in hell, however, that Germany would give Japan the bomb. It was an alliance of convenience and nothing more. IOTL, the Germans only tried handing the Japanese real weapons plans as a spoiler against the Americans when it was clear they were going down for real. They're more likely to give the plans for the bomb to the ITALIANS than they are the Japanese. I doubt the Axis would even be founded ITTL, for a number of reasons. Even if you handwave that, I don't think there's enough electricity generation in the whole country in the 1930's to allow it to refine enough uranium for a bomb before the US starts blowing up generation capacity. If the bomb research gets pushed up, I think one general theme is going to be that the Axis is the side getting hurt the most. WWII will likely occur earlier, when the Allies are much better armed and prepared relative to a newly-rearming Germany and a Japan stuck balls-deep in China. (forgive the imagery, it was too good to pass up ) Everyone will be less prepared, but the Germans and Japanese will be more less prepared, if you follow my (nearly incomprehensible) meaning.\n\nWarning--Very Long Post Ahead\n\nThey lack the electricity. They also lack the expertise, and it really could not be found for them; what reason does a physicist have to move there?\n\nI can think of no non-ASB way to get Japan a bomb before 1945, even if you push the entire field up 5 or 6 years.\n\nYou make Japan sound like a land without scientists. I don't disagree that Japan would have the fewest industrial, and even monetary, resources for competing in a nuclear weapons race, but they had some able talent. Just picking from people involved in the two historic Japanese atomic weapons projects, you have: (borrowing liberally from Wikipedia)\n\nYoshio Nishina-- He studied at some of the most prestigious European universities and institutions, including Cavendish Laboratory, Georg August University of Göttingen, and University of Copenhagen. He personally mentored two Japanese future winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. He is also described as a \"good friend\" of Niels Bohr and a \"close associate\" of Albert Einstein. Nishina built a 26 inch cyclotron in 1936, another 60 inch 220 ton cyclotron in 1937, and then in 1938 purchased a cyclotron from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nBunsaku Arakatsu--Also studied at Cavendish Laboratory (Cambridge University), and at Berlin University with Einstein. By 1945, he had managed to complete a design for an ultracentrifuge, despite the incredible strain on Japanese society caused by the war and allied bombing.\n\nHideki Yukawa--First Japanese citizen to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1949. In 1935 he published his theory of mesons, which explained the interaction between protons and neutrons, and was a major influence on research into elementary particles.\n\nSin-Itiro Tomonaga--Did not technically work on the Japanese atomic bomb projects. However, he returned to Japan during the outbreak of the war, and remained there during the duration of the conflict. From 1937 until war broke out, he studied and preformed research in Leizpig under Werner Heisenberg.\n\nJapan may not have been the powerhouse of science research that Germany was before the war, but they had more than their fair share of important early particle physicists. Furthermore, I see no reason why Japan could not make use of at least some foreign talent. As early as 1931, Nishina invited some Western scholars to study in Japan, including Heisenberg, Dirac and Bohr. If studying with Nishina and other scientists of his ilk was not incentive enough to bring them to Japan, then Japan could've brought them over the same it way it brought over German airplane design talent in the early '30s--by paying top dollar for it.\n\nThe way I see it, Japan had one big problem that prevented it from making progress: the Japanese government was slow to get interested in the project. Nishina was worried about the US developing these weapons and using them on Japan as early as 1939, but work didn't begin in earnest until April 1941. After that, you still have the problems of two competing projects, underfunding, and the rest. The US was the only power that was wealthy enough (and geographically isolated enough) to spend whatever amount was needed to develop the bomb. For any other power, funding this project at the level it needs to be funded means a lot less of everything else--less tanks, less ships, maybe fewer divisions. It's a very big gamble to make.\n\nI don't think it's impossible, though. The Empire of Japan in the 1930's had just one foreign policy goal--to make herself strong enough that no nation could challenge her in East Asia. This was seen as the only route to long-term security. If you could somehow convince the Japanese High Command of the true potential of these weapons, they will see that nuclear bombs are the only thing in existence that might have actually get them to their goal. It doesn't fit in with your \"just a really big bomb\" idea, and I don't think it's too likely, either. But if you can make it happen in your timeline, I think the Japanese government would be willing to pay the price if it could.\n\nJapan already had electrical grids. Japan already had, as of 1926, a heavy water production plant that could rival Norway's. She had access to uranium. She had the academic talent, too. If you can convince the Japanese government that it's worth the price--worth insane amounts of money, worth less military spending, worth hiring expensive foreign researchers who are probably subversive, even worth cutting off half the nation's electricity for half the day every day to give it to the lab--I think they can get there. Will the Empire of Japan be the first nation to get a bomb? No--but they WILL get one."
