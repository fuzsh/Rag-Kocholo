His contributions are as important, and as pervasive, as those of Richard Feynman, with whom (and with Sin-itiro Tomonaga) he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize for Physics. Yet, while Feynman is universally recognized as a cultural icon, Schwinger is little known even to many within the physics community. This biography aims to describe Schwinger's life and research contributions to a wider audience.\" \"This biography describes the many strands of his research life, while tracing the personal life of this private and gentle genius.\"--Jacket"
