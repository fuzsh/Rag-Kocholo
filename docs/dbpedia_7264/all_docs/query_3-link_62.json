(1) It is shown that a considerable simplification can be attained in writing down matrix elements for complex processes in electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is available which permits them to be written down directly for any specific problem. Being simply a restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however, the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2) Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements are now finite, with the exception of those relating to problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe, which gives finite results for these matrices also. The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could not be directly observed. Phenomena directly observable, are insensitive to the details of the modification used (except at extreme energies). For such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of the modification goes to zero. The results then agree with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and presumably consistent, method is therefore available for the calculation of all processes involving electrons and photons.\\par The simplification in writing the expressions results from an emphasis on the over-all space--time view resulting from a study of the solution of the equations of electrodynamics. The relation of this to the more conventional Hamiltonian point of view is discussed. It would be very difficult to make the modification which is proposed if one insisted on having the equations in Hamiltonian form. The methods apply as well to charges obeying the Klein--Gordon equation, and to the various meson theories of nuclear forces. Illustrative examples are given. Although a modification like that used in electrodynamics can make all matrices finite for all of the meson theories, for some of the theories it is no longer true that all directly observable phenomena are insensitive to the details of the modification used.

Experimentally, such a wave corresponds to a positron approaching the potential and annihilating the electron. A particle moving forward in time (electron) in a potential may be scattered forward in time (ordinary scattering) or backward (pair annihilation). When moving backward (positron) it may be scattered backward in time (positron scattering) or forward (pair production). For such a particle the amplitude for transition from an initial to a final state is analyzed to any order in the potential by considering it to undergo a sequence of such scatterings.\\par The amplitude for a process involving many such particles is the product of the transition amplitudes for each particle. The exclusion principle requires that antisymmetric combinations of amplitudes be chosen for those complete processes which differ only by exchange of particles. It seems that a consistent interpretation is only possible if the exclusion principle is adopted. The exclusion principle need not be taken into account in intermediate states.

It is next argued that the motion of one atom through the others is not opposed by a potential barrier because the others may move out of the way. This just increases the effective inertia of the moving atom. This permits a simpler form to be written for the partition function. A rough analysis of this form shows the existence of a transition, but of the third order.

In the variational principle this trial function minimizes the energy if $ f(r) = \\exp (i k \\cdot r) $, the energy value being $ E(k) = \\hbar^2 k^2 / 2 m S(k) $, where $ S(k) $ is the structure factor of the liquid for neutron scattering. For small $k$, $E$ rises linearly (phonons). For larger $k$, $ S(k) $ has a maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum in the $ E(k) $ vs $k$ curve. Near the minimum, $ E(k) $ behaves as $ \\Delta + \\hbar^2 (k - k_0)^2 / 2 \\mu $, which form Landau found agrees with the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $ \\Delta $ is twice too high, however, indicating need of a better trial function.\\par Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view is not adequate to deal with the details of the $ \\lambda $ transition and with problems of critical flow velocity.\\par In a dilute solution of He$^3$ atoms in He$^4$, the He$^3$ should move essentially as free particles but of higher effective mass.

It is equivalent to equal amounts of vector and axial vector coupling with two-component neutrinos and conservation of leptons. (The relative sign is not determined theoretically.) It is taken to be ``universal''; the lifetime of the $ \\mu $ agrees to within the experimental errors of 2\\%. The vector part of the coupling is, by analogy with electric charge, assumed to be not renormalized by virtual mesons. This requires, for example, that pions are also ``charged'' in the sense that there is a direct interaction in which, say, a $ \\pi^0 $ goes to $ \\pi^- $ and an electron goes to a neutrino. The weak decays of strange particles will result qualitatively if the universality is extended to include a coupling involving a $ \\Lambda $ or $ \\Sigma $ fermion. Parity is then not conserved even for those decays like $ K \\to 2 \\pi $ or $ 3 \\pi $ which involve no neutrinos. The theory is at variance with the measured angular correlation of electron and neutrino in He$^6$, and with the fact that fewer than $ 10^{-4} $ pion decay into electron and neutrino.\", acknowledgement = ack-nhfb, fjournal = \"Physical Review (2)\", journal-URL = \"http://prola.aps.org/browse/PR\", } @Misc{Feynman:1959:PRBa, author = \"Richard P.

The starting point for the calculation is the quantum mechanical expression for the expected current. The phonon coordinates are eliminated from this expression by well-known field-theory techniques. The resulting exact ``influence functional'' is then approximated by a corresponding quadratic ``influence functional' which, it is hoped, imitates the real polaron. Correction terms are computed to account for the difference between the approximate impedance and the exact polaron impedance in a manner closely analogous to Feynman's treatment of the polaron self-energy. In fact, the analytic evaluation of the expression for the impedance obtained here is carried out using the approximate ``influence functional'' that was successfully employed in minimizing the binding (and free) energy of the polaron in earlier calculations. However, the accuracy obtained using this approximation, for the impedance calculation, is less satisfactory and its limitations are discussed. Nevertheless, beginning at intermediate coupling strengths, the approximate impedance produces a level structure of increasing complexity and narrowing resonances as the coupling strengthens. This suggests that further refinements may be fruitful. Methods for finding a better quadratic influence functional for use in our impedance expression as well as ways of improving the expression further are suggested. A comparison of our results with those of the Boltzmann equation points up interesting differences which arise from reversing the order of taking limits of zero frequency and coupling.\", acknowledgement = ack-nhfb, fjournal = \"Physical Review\", journal-URL = \"http://prola.aps.org/browse/PR\", } @Misc{Feynman:1962:QELa, author = \"Richard P.

So there isn't any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work although there has been in these days some interest in this kind of thing. Since winning the prize is a personal thing, I thought I could be excused in this particular situation if I were to talk personally about my relationship to quantum electrodynamics, rather than to discuss the subject itself in a refined and finished fashion. Furthermore, since there are three people who have won the prize in physics, if they are all going to be talking about quantum electrodynamics itself, one might become bored with the subject. So what I would like to tell you about today is the sequence of events, really the sequence of ideas, which occurred, and by which I finally came out the other end with an unsolved problem for which I ultimately received a prize\", acknowledgement = ack-nhfb, fjournal = \"Physics Today\", journal-URL = \"http://www.physicstoday.org/\", } @Article{Feynman:1966:DSTc, author = \"Richard P.
