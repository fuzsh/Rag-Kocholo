        "text": "This article gives an overview of the constitution, physical conditions, and observables of dust in the interstellar medium of nearby galaxies. We first review the macroscopic, spatial distribution of dust in these objects and its consequences for our ability to study grain physics. We also discuss the possibility of using dust tracers as diagnostic tools. We then survey the current understanding of the microscopic, intrinsic properties of dust in different environments, derived from different observables: emission, extinction, polarization, and depletions, over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Finally, we summarize the clues about grain evolution, evidenced either on local scales or over cosmic time. We put in perspective the different evolution scenarios. We attempt a comprehensive presentation of the main observational constraints, analysis methods, and modeling frameworks of the distinct processes. We discuss neither the dust properties of the Milky Way and distant galaxies, ...\n\nWe review the development of dust science from the first ground-based astronomical observations of dust in space to compositional analysis of individual dust particles and their source objects. A multitude of observational techniques is available for the scientific study of space dust: from meteors and interplanetary dust particles collected in the upper atmosphere to dust analyzed in situ or returned to Earth. In situ dust detectors have been developed from simple dust impact detectors determining the dust hazard in Earth orbit to dust telescopes capable of providing compositional analysis and accurate trajectory determination of individual dust particles in space. The concept of Dust Astronomy has been developed, recognizing that dust particles, like photons, carry information from remote sites in space and time. From knowledge of the dust particlesâ€™ birthplace and their bulk properties, we learn about the remote environment out of which the particles were formed. Dust Observatory..."
