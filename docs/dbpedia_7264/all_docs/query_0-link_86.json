I focus on the crafting of theoretical tools, techniques, and practices—the everyday labor of theory— to complement the usual treatments in intellectual and conceptual histories. At stake are our assumptions about how theorists have spent their time and structured their activities. Have their primary concerns centered narrowly on the construction and selection of theories, or have they had other goals in mind when taking pencil and paper in hand? How should historians account for their work? If we assume (as usual) that the quest for distinct scientiﬁc theories— delimited by the philosophers’ anemic labels T1 , T2 , T3 —and the selection of one best theory have dominated theorists’ work, then we might be inclined to organize our historical analyses around the birth and death of particular theories. Indeed, today we have huge literatures charting the development of Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics, Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity, Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics, Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics, their union in a theory of quantum mechanics, and so on. Yet as the best of these historical studies have shown, the objects of study in such cases—“special relativity,” say, or “quantum mechanics”—are rarely single or unitary objects at all. Scientiﬁc theories are always open to divergent interpretations and uses, even decades after their construction and selection have supposedly been settled. Moreover, theoretical physicists have had much more on their plates than just theories. Theirs has been a world littered with calculations—calculations performed with an ever-changing toolbox of techniques.\n\nxii\n\np re face a n d ac k n ow l e d g m e n ts\n\nThese tools and techniques never apply themselves. Apprentice physicists must rehearse using theoretical tools until such calculational skills become second nature. These skills are rarely transmitted by formal, written instructions alone. Therefore, we must interrogate the wide range of pedagogical means by which students have become working theorists, eventually wielding the tools of theory with ease. Few tools have meant more to theoretical physicists during the past half century than Feynman diagrams, named for the American theorist Richard Feynman. Feynman diagrams provide a rich map for charting larger transformations in the training of theoretical physicists during the decades after World War II. Even when drawing their diagrams in a similar fashion, members of different research groups gave them meaning and put them to work in distinct ways. Physicists carved out a wide variety of uses for the diagrams between the late 1940s and late 1960s. Historians may add one more: the diagrams demarcate the boundaries between research groups and chart their pedagogical reproduction over time. Much like the diagrams it describes, this book is meant to contribute to constructive discussions among heterogeneous communities—historians, sociologists, philosophers, and physicists. With these diverse groups in mind, my goal has been to supply specialists with sufﬁcient technical detail to demonstrate my arguments without overwhelming readers from broader backgrounds. Toward this end, the ﬁrst and last sections of the book are meant to be broadly accessible, while most of the technical details appear in chapters 5, 6, and 8. Even in these chapters, I have attempted to provide guideposts for readers who last saw an integral sign in high school (and didn’t like it then). * * * I have incurred a great many debts while working on this study. This book grew out of my doctoral dissertation in the Department of the History of Science at Harvard University, and it is a pleasure to thank my advisers, Peter Galison, Silvan S. Schweber, and Mario Biagioli, for untiring advice, encouragement, and friendship. Kathryn Olesko and Andrew Warwick functioned as de facto advisers every step of the way, and the book is better because of their engagement. While at Harvard I also completed doctoral work in theoretical physics; my thanks to Alan Guth, Robert Brandenberger, and Sidney Coleman for all their aid on my physics dissertation. Many physicists who were active in the period I describe have graciously shared their memories, correspondence, and lecture notes with me, and I am\n\np re face a n d ac k n ow l e d g m e n ts\n\nxiii\n\ndeeply grateful to them: Stephen Adler, the late Louis Bal`azs, Michel Baranger, E. E. Bergmann, James Bjorken, John Bronzan, Laurie Brown, Kenneth Case, Denyse Chew, Geoffrey Chew, Roy Chisholm, Carleton DeTar, Freeman Dyson, Gordon Feldman, Jerry Finkelstein, William Frazer, Marvin Goldberger, the late A. Carl Helmholtz, Macalaster Hull, C. Angas Hurst, the late Morton Kaplon, Tom Kinoshita, Abraham Klein, Norman Kroll, Andrew Lenard, Joseph Levinger, Peter Lindenfeld, Francis Low, Stanley Mandelstam, Gordon Moorhouse, Yoichiro Nambu, Roger Phillips, Silvan S. Schweber, Andrew Sessler, Howard Shugart, Henry Stapp, M. K. Sundaresan, Chung-I Tan, Kip Thorne, and Eyvind Wichmann. I have also beneﬁted from the comments of many people who read part or all of this book in manuscript: Ron Anderson, James Bjorken, Alexander Brown, Laurie Brown, Cathryn Carson, Patrick Catt, Deborah Coen, Denyse Chew, Geoffrey Chew, Roy Chisholm, the late James Cushing, Carleton DeTar, Joe Dumit, Freeman Dyson, James Elkins, Guy Emery, Peter Galison, JeanFranc¸ois Gauvin, Tracy Gleason, Michael Gordin, Stephen Gordon, Loren Graham, Karl Hall, Kristen Haring, Kenji Ito, Robert Jaffe, Matthew Jones, Tom Kinoshita, Robert Kohler, Alexei Kojevnikov, Michael Lynch, Shawn Mullet, Yoichiro Nambu, Mary Jo Nye, Kathryn Olesko, Naomi Oreskes, Elizabeth Paris, Silvan S. Schweber, Sameer Shah, Peter Shulman, Robert Silbey, Susan Silbey, Rebecca Slayton, Chung-I Tan, Will Thomas, Jessica Wang, Andrew Warwick, Lambert Williams, Rosalind Williams, and Chen-Pang Yeang. Though we might not agree on all points, the book is incomparably better because of their generous input. This study became feasible only with the aid of several research assistants, who tirelessly tracked down published articles, biographical information, secondary literature, and sundry other details. I am grateful to the following for all their help: Alexander Brown, Shane Hamilton, Rachel Prentice, Sameer Shah, and Peter Shulman. Sameer Shah in particular rose above the call of duty time and time again over the course of three years; Sameer, my thanks. My friends and colleagues Kenji Ito and Karl Hall also proved invaluable, especially for their help with sources in Japanese and Russian, respectively. Without working closely with Kenji and Karl, I could never have extended my original study (which had focused only upon the United States) to include the crucial international comparisons. Archivists at the following institutions proved tremendously helpful: the Niels Bohr Library of the American Institute of Physics, in College Park, Maryland; the Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley (especially David Farrell); the Rare and Manuscript Collections in Kroch Library\n\nxiv\n\np re face a n d ac k n ow l e d g m e n ts\n\nat Cornell University; the Harvard University Archives in Pusey Library at Harvard University; the Institute for Advanced Study Archives in Princeton, New Jersey (especially Lisa Coats); the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library at Princeton University; the Physics-Optics-Astronomy Library at the University of Rochester (especially Patricia Souloff); and the Syracuse University Archives in Bird Library at Syracuse University. Professor Freeman Dyson graciously shared with me his voluminous private correspondence, which is housed in his ofﬁce at the Institute for Advanced Study. The Program in Science, Technology, and Society at MIT has been a wonderful setting in which to expand my dissertation into this book. My heartfelt thanks to my colleagues and students. The many months I spent as a visitor in the Ofﬁce for the History of Science and Technology at Berkeley during 1998 were made both productive and happy by the warm welcome extended by Cathryn Carson, Diana Wear, Roger Hahn, Sonja Amadae, Christopher Ritter, Paula DeVos, and Peter Westwick. More recently, this project has beneﬁted from the kind hospitality of MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics; I would like to thank Robert Jaffe for making me an afﬁliate of the CTP, and Scott Morley and Joyce Berggren for their assistance. My physics collaborators over the years have helped me keep critical skills sharp; I have learned many things from working with Bruce Bassett, Joanne Cohn, Alan Guth, Roy Maartens, Philip Mannheim, and Ali Nayeri. Research grants from the National Science Foundation (SES-0135615) and the Spencer Foundation (grant 200200081) are gratefully acknowledged, as are the funds provided by the Levitan Prize in the Humanities at MIT and the Leo Marx Career Development Assistant Professorship at MIT. I would also like to thank Christie Henry, Jennifer Howard, and Erik Carlson at the University of Chicago Press for all their help along the way.

His star rose early. Following undergraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduate study at Princeton, Feynman served as the youngest subgroup leader in wartime Los Alamos— he was only twenty-ﬁve—leading a band of fellow physicists in the sprawling effort to build atomic bombs. As the war ground closer to a conclusion, physics departments throughout the United States jockeyed to hire Feynman, as word of his creativity and sheer calculating power began to spread. His boss at Los Alamos, Hans Bethe, managed to lure Feynman to Cornell, where he taught for ﬁve years before the California Institute of Technology enticed him away from Ithaca’s winters to the golden groves of Southern California. At Caltech, Feynman’s renown as an animated teacher grew to match that of his physics prowess. An invitation to teach Caltech’s large introductory physics class during the late 1950s led to the famous Feynman Lectures on Physics—a three-volume set still known simply as “the red books” by admiring physicists the world over.2 In later years, Feynman made a habit of giving informal lectures on 1. Galen, On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato (1978), 113 (bk. 2, 3:17). 2. Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, Feynman Lectures on Physics (1965). The phrase “red books” refers to the original cover design, which featured a bold, red background. Never mind that the “experiment” of teaching the class was a ﬂop: even Feynman came to admit within a few years that his approach was too difﬁcult for the entering undergraduates, though it resonated with the grateful graduate students, postdoctoral students, and faculty who made a habit of sneaking into Feynman’s lectures.

All the while he made lasting contributions to physicists’ understanding of electrodynamics, nuclear forces, solid-state physics, and gravitation, many of which still bear his name. The Nobel Prize that Feynman shared with two fellow physicists in 1965 piqued the wider public’s interest; by the mid-1980s, he had became a folk hero well beyond the world’s clique of theoretical physicists. A visible role in the 1986 investigation of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger—dunking a piece of O-ring rubber in a glass of ice water in the midst of a televised press conference—capped a decades-long process of becoming a household name. One year after his death, the American Physical Society, American Association of Physics Teachers, and American Association for the Advancement of Science jointly organized a daylong memorial. Since then, four biographical portraits and at least ﬁve collections of friends’ and colleagues’ reminiscences have been published, supplementing the two best-selling compilations of his own anecdotes and aphorisms that were published near the end of his life.3 A book of his artwork and a compact disk of his celebrated bongo drumming were each on sale during the 1990s.4 Television specials have supplemented his popular accounts of modern physics and of his own life story. During the late 1990s, the Apple Computer Company selected various portraits of Feynman, along with portraits of other iconic ﬁgures such as Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, and Charlie Chaplin, for their “Think different” advertising campaign. (See ﬁg. 1.1.) More recently, no less an actor than Alan Alda depicted Feynman in a solo performance at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York City’s Lincoln Center. The show sold out so quickly upon its opening in November 2001 that the producers brought it back for an even longer run the following spring. As 3. On the jointly sponsored memorial event on 18 Jan 1989 in San Francisco, see Lubkin, “Special issue: Richard Feynman” (1989), 23. Biographies include Gleick, Genius (1992); Schweber, QED (1994), esp. chap. 8; Mehra, Beat of a Different Drum (1994); and Gribbin and Gribbin, Richard Feynman (1997). Interviews and reminiscences include the Feb 1989 issue of PT; Ralph Leighton, Tuva or Bust! (1991); Brown and Rigden, Most of the Good Stuff (1993); Sykes, No Ordinary Genius (1994); and Mlodinow, Feynman’s Rainbow (2003). Feynman’s own anecdotes were published as Feynman with Leighton, Surely You’re Joking (1985); and Feynman with Leighton, What Do You Care (1988). Both of these books were soon reissued, with wider circulation, in the New Age Books imprint series from Bantam. On the Feynman publishing industry, see also Goodstein, “Feynmaniacs should read this review” (1998). 4. M. Feynman, Art of Richard P. Feynman (1995); examples of his artwork appear in “Richard Feynman, Artist,” PT 42 (Feb 1989): 86–87.

When the journal Physics Today dedicated a special memorial issue to Feynman in February 1989, the editor faced the difﬁcult task of summing up Feynman’s many contributions. She selected a simple graphic theme to unify the volume. “The diagram you see scattered throughout this issue is a reminder of the legacy Richard Feynman left us,” the editor explained.6 A simple line drawing, known to physicists as a “Feynman diagram,” appeared atop each article in the issue, its white lines set against a dark ﬁeld of mourning.

Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics since the middle of the twentieth century. Feynman ﬁrst introduced his diagrams in the late 1940s as a bookkeeping device for simplifying lengthy calculations in one area of physics—quantum electrodynamics, physicists’ quantum-mechanical description of electromagnetic forces. Soon the diagrams gained adherents throughout the ﬁelds of nuclear and particle physics. Not long thereafter, other theorists adopted—and subtly adapted—Feynman diagrams for manybody applications in solid-state theory. By the end of the 1960s, some physicists even wielded the line drawings for calculations in gravitational physics. With the diagrams’ aid, entire new calculational vistas opened for physicists; theorists learned to calculate things that many had barely dreamed possible before World War II. With the list of diagrammatic applications growing ever longer, Feynman diagrams helped to transform the way physicists saw the world, and their place within it. Today physicists all over the world scribble down the diagrams when studying everything from the mundane to the bizarre. Whether calculating the properties of materials that will form electronic computer chips, the levitation of magnets above superconductors, the behavior of particles near black holes, or the origin of matter itself just fractions of a second after the big bang, physicists begin by drawing Feynman diagrams. Everything about using the diagrams has become routine. Particle physicists can now download computer programs that will both draw the standardized diagrams and evaluate the associated mathematical terms: the diagrams’ lines and their mathematical content have become both algorithmic and automatic. As one physicist wrote in a recent preprint detailing the new automated diagram tools, “Explaining the necessity of [diagrammatic] one-loop calculations in the light of modern-day colliders is like carrying owls to Athens”—the centrality of Feynman diagrams\n\nPedagogy and Theory\n\n5\n\nto everyday practice, and the need to evaluate large numbers of them quickly, simply goes without saying.7 The latest programs can generate and evaluate one thousand simple diagrams in about ﬁve minutes on an ordinary desktop computer. Yet it hasn’t always been this way. A generation of theoretical physicists earned doctorates for performing far less grandiose tasks just a few short decades ago. Evaluating a few Feynman diagrams by hand was a publishable feat in the early 1950s, and the stuff of which scores of dissertations were made. More important, both aspects of the diagrams’ use and interpretation—how to draw them and how to calculate with them, that is, what they meant— became contested and shifting during the two decades after their introduction in the late 1940s. Today’s automated computational utopia hides a rich history of competing appropriations and theoretical foundations for these bare line drawings. During the 1950s and 1960s, Feynman diagrams did not compel, by themselves, a unique meaning or interpretation. They were drawn differently and mustered in different fashions to varying calculational, and ultimately ontological, ends. Despite the diagrams’ centrality today, and despite all the attention lavished on Feynman himself—his quirky genius, his lasting contributions to physics, his now-famous eccentricities—no attention has been paid to how his simple-looking diagrams actually came to be embraced by so many physicists for so many distinct applications. Indeed, more has been written about the hunt for Feynman’s celebrated passenger van, bedecked in larger-than-life Feynman diagrams, than about how scores of physicists—and soon hundreds and thousands—came to trafﬁc in the diagrams in the ﬁrst place.8 Several physicists and historians have scrutinized various roots within Feynman’s thinking for what became Feynman diagrams.9 My project concerns instead what happened to the diagrams once they made the leap out of Feynman’s head. How did the diagrams spread so quickly? What kinds of applications did physicists forge for the line drawings? Why did the diagrams remain central to physicists’ work even as related methods of calculation came and 7. Hahn, “FeynArts, FormCalc, and LoopTools” (1999), 1.

Feynman’s protracted and largely private struggles to work out a consistent calculational scheme for quantum electrodynamics paled in comparison with the efforts required to equip other physicists with the new diagrammatic tool. Long after Feynman himself had grown accustomed to thinking and working with his diagrams, they remained neither obvious nor automatic for others. In fact, Feynman’s particular ideas about the diagrams provided only one—and by no means the most important one—of several contrasting factors in determining how other physicists would treat them. Rather than dwell on the isolated thoughts of a few Nobel laureates, therefore, I focus in this book on the pedagogical work involved in training large numbers of researchers to approach physical questions in similar ways. Unlike previous historical treatments of modern physics, this study follows neither the grand march of particular theories nor the lumbering progress of ever-growing experiments. Instead, I follow Feynman diagrams around, focusing on how physicists fashioned—and constantly refashioned—the diagrams into a calculational tool, a theoretical practice. My goal is to unpack the history of postwar theoretical physics from the ground up, as a story ultimately about crafting, deploying, and stabilizing the tools that undergird everyday calculations. Research tools such as Feynman diagrams never apply themselves; physicists have to be trained to use them, and to interpret and evaluate the results in certain ways. Stabilizing the new tool went hand in hand with training a new generation of theoretical physicists after World War II. The story of Feynman diagrams’ spread thus illuminates larger transformations in what “theoretical physics” would be and how young physicists would become “theorists” after the war. By following how physicists learned about and used Feynman diagrams from the late 1940s through the late 1960s, we bring broader changes in the infrastructure and intellectual development of postwar physics into focus. Everything about physicists’ patterns of work came in for reevaluation after the war, from the methods of training young theorists, to the means of communicating new results and techniques, to decisions about what topics merited study and by what means. The diagrams likewise reveal the ﬁssures and politics of becoming a young theorist after the war—from the international politics of the cold war, which shaped how physicists could communicate with colleagues in other countries; to the cold war’s domestic doppelg¨anger, McCarthyism, and its effects on physicists’ civil liberties and patterns of thought; to the generational politics between mentors and students, and the microsocial politics between competing research groups. In all these ways, following Feynman diagrams around helps us make sense of theoretical physicists’ changing world.\n\nPedagogy and Theory\n\n7\n\nThis account of the dispersion of Feynman diagrams draws on several general themes, which I discuss in this introductory chapter and elaborate upon in the chapters that follow. Before turning to these issues in more detail, I should pause and discuss the book’s title, Drawing Theories Apart. Two senses of the phrase are likely to be recognizable already: ﬁrst, an emphasis upon drawing and similar pencil-and-paper work within theoretical physics; and second, the need to rethink the roles of theories versus tools in our accounts of modern physics. A third reference might not be as obvious for all readers: an inverted analogy with Bruno Latour’s 1986 article “Drawing Things Together.” As scholars in science studies will no doubt recognize in the chapters that follow, this book draws on several quintessentially Latourian themes: the building of networks, the importance of inscriptions, the work of translation and enrollment, and so on. Indeed, the very idea of following a nonhuman scientiﬁc object around as an organizing principle bears a certain Latourian signature.10 Yet I follow a different line when it comes to the question of “immutable mobiles,” a notion that Latour introduced in his 1986 article. Whereas Latour emphasizes “optical consistency” (even “immutability”) as an essential feature of why diagrams and other scientiﬁc inscriptions carry so much force among scientists, I focus instead on unfolding variations within their work—on the production and magniﬁcation of local differences, and the work required to transcend these differences when comparing results from different places.11 Hence the “apart” of my title, in place of Latour’s “together.”\n\npaper tools and t he practice of t heory Despite their centrality, the crafting and use of theoretical tools such as Feynman diagrams has not found an easy place within historians’ and philosophers’ traditional accounts of modern physics. Most studies have followed in the spirit of a joke that the wisecracking theorist George Gamow was fond of making. Gamow used to explain to his students what he liked most about 10.

See also Latour and Woolgar, Laboratory Life (1986 [1979]); Latour, Pasteurization (1988 [1984]); Latour, Science in Action (1987); and Latour, Aramis (1996). 11. This move parallels recent work by historians of early modern printing: rather than focus on the purported “ﬁxity” of printed (rather than manuscript) texts, recent historians have highlighted the mutability of printed texts themselves and of the varied readings they could inspire. Cf. Eisenstein, Printing Press (1979); with Johns, Nature of the Book (1998); Eisenstein, “Unacknowledged revolution revisited” (2002); and Johns, “How to acknowledge a revolution” (2002).

Theories, worldviews, or paradigms seemed to be the appropriate units of analysis, and the challenge became charting the birth and conceptual development of particular ideas. In these traditional accounts, the skilled manipulation of tools played little role: theorists were assumed to write papers whose content other theorists could understand, at least in principle, anywhere in the world. Ideas, embodied in texts, traveled easily from theorist to theorist in these accounts, shorn of the material constraints that might make bubble chambers or electron microscopes (along with the skills required for their use) difﬁcult to carry from place to place. The age-old trope of minds versus hands has been at play: a purely cognitive realm of ideas has been pitted against a manual realm of action. In short, more “night thoughts” than desk work, more Weltbild than Fingerspitzengef¨uhl. During the past decade, a rival vision of how to analyze work in theoretical sciences has begun to take shape.13 Building upon these studies, this book begins with a simple premise: since at least the middle of the twentieth century— and, arguably, during earlier periods as well—most theorists have not spent their days (or, indeed, their nights) in some philosopher’s dreamworld, weighing one cluster of disembodied concepts against another, picking and choosing among so many theories or paradigms. Rather, their main task has been to calculate. Theorists have tinkered with models and estimated effects, always trying to reduce the inchoate confusion of “out there”—an “out there” increasingly percolated through factory-sized apparatus and computer-triggered detectors—into tractable representations. They have accomplished these translations by fashioning theoretical tools and performing calculations. Theorists have used calculational tools, in other words, to mediate between various 12. Geoffrey Chew, who studied under Gamow as an undergraduate at George Washington University during the early 1940s, repeated Gamow’s joke in a May 1997 interview with Stephen Gordon, as quoted in Gordon, Strong Interactions (1998), 15n10. 13.

These tools have provided the currency of everyday work. Focusing on theorists’ tools cuts orthogonally across conceptual histories of theoretical physics, since physicists often improvise with calculational techniques across a wide range of distinct topics or ﬁelds of inquiry. Feynman himself explained near the end of his life that he chose various topics to work on—from the scattering of electrons to the superﬂuid behavior of liquid helium, from vortex rings and polarization waves in crystals to superconductivity, from the scattering of constituents inside protons to the scattering of gravity waves off of planets—because such problems all fell “in the range of my tools.”14 Concentrating on the separate theory domains with which such problems are usually associated—electrodynamics, solid-state physics, nuclear and particle physics, or gravitation—obscures deeper continuities in daily practice and calculational approach. Historians Andrew Warwick and Ursula Klein have given useful names to such calculational techniques, each drawing on an analogy to instruments: Warwick introduced the term “theoretical technology,” and Klein the phrase “paper tools.”15 Since the late 1940s, generations of physicists have turned more and more often to Feynman diagrams as their paper tool of choice. In order to build an account of theorists’ uses of paper tools, we must understand how tools have functioned in historians’ and sociologists’ studies of the laboratory and ﬁeld sciences. Central to many of these studies is the notion of skill. Students rarely look through a microscope the ﬁrst time and see what they are supposed to see. The point becomes all the more obvious with the gargantuan apparatus of postwar “big science”: there is nothing obvious or natural (at ﬁrst) about pumping high-pressure liquid hydrogen into a bubble chamber, or searching for identiﬁable patterns in the meandering tracks of the millions of resulting photographs. With practice and over time, however, using scientiﬁc instruments eventually becomes obvious or even second nature for accomplished practitioners. As the eighteenth-century chemist Joseph 14.

It is known to all persons who are conversant in experimental philosophy, that there are many little attentions and precautions necessary to be observed in the conducting of experiments, which cannot well be described in words, but which it is needless to describe, since practice will necessarily suggest them; though, like all other arts in which the hands and ﬁngers are made use of, it is only much practice that can enable a person to go through complex experiments, of this or any other kind, with ease and readiness.16\n\nAs Priestley admonished, and as a number of historians and sociologists have concurred more recently, experimentalists must work hard to hone something like artisanal knowledge or craft skill in addition to an understanding of general principles. No amount of formal written instructions will sufﬁce for producing this feel for the instrument—no student jumps from reading a manual to using an instrument correctly the ﬁrst time. Michael Polanyi gave a name to those skills that Priestley argued “cannot well be described in words”: tacit knowledge.17 Historians and sociologists have argued that tacit knowledge plays a central role when it comes to replicating someone else’s instruments, even when the would-be replicator is already an expert experimentalist or instrument maker. In cases ranging from the design of modern-day lasers, to the use of early modern air pumps and glass prisms, to the establishment of electrical standards during the height of Britain’s imperial rule, no amount of written instructions, supplied at a distance from the original site, proved sufﬁcient for successful replication. Certain features of the instruments’ design and use, according to these studies, remained literally ineffable—the rules required for actual use remained impossible to specify fully, even in principle, via textual instructions alone. The key to successful replication in each of these cases—the one way to transmit the tacit knowledge required to build and use these tools—was through extended personal contact. Only those scientists who worked face to 16. Priestley, Experiments and Observations (1775), 2:6–7, as quoted in Levere, “Measuring gases” (2000), 111; emphasis in original. 17.

See also Lave, Cognition in Practice (1988).\n\nPedagogy and Theory\n\n11\n\nface with those already “in the know” could develop the skills and master the practices necessary to build and use these instruments.18 Craftlike skill, local practices, and material culture might now seem appropriate categories for analyzing laboratory and ﬁeld sciences, but what about theoretical sciences? Getting the “feel” in one’s ﬁngers for how to turn a dial or solder an electrical connection is one thing, but isn’t theoretical work all about manipulating representations on paper—that is, isn’t it all about texts? Once we shift from a view of theoretical work as selecting between preformed theories, however, to theoretical work as the crafting and use of paper tools, tacit knowledge and craft skill need not seem so foreign. Thomas Kuhn raised a similar point with his discussion of “exemplars.” Kuhn wrote that science students must work to master exemplars, or model problems, before they can tackle research problems on their own. The rules for solving such model problems and generalizing their application are almost never adequately conveyed via appeals to overarching general principles, and rarely appear in sufﬁcient form within published textbooks.19 To put the matter in a more mundane way: theoretical physicists do not enter the ﬁeld on the basis of correspondence courses, sending and receiving written instructions in the absence of any face-to-face training interactions. If the point has been underappreciated by scholars in science studies, it was by no means lost on theoretical physicists themselves. Hans Bethe, for example, lobbied hard in 1950 with the American consul general in Genoa to gain a visitor’s visa for an Italian physicist, Antonio Borsellino. “Professor Borsellino has made theoretical studies about matters which are directly connected with the experimental investigations” then underway at Cornell, Bethe explained. Despite Borsellino’s publications, Bethe continued, he and his colleagues had been “unable . . . to obtain enough information on Professor Borsellino’s theory to enable us to use it, and his personal presence here would therefore be of great value.”20 Nor was the matter restricted to theorists who worked an ocean 18.

Bethe and Coccioni had difﬁculty gaining the visitor’s visa for Borsellino because of the recently enacted McCarran Act, which blocked visas to former members of such groups as the Fascist Party\n\n12\n\nchapter one\n\napart and who were not well acquainted personally. A few years earlier, in the summer of 1947, Enrico Fermi had complained that he was unable to make sense of one of Bethe’s own recent papers, and hence could not reproduce and extend Bethe’s calculation. Fermi and Bethe were both experts in the ﬁeld in question, and they had worked closely together throughout the war years; they knew the territory and they knew each other quite well. All the same, however, only after Fermi and Bethe met together again that summer, where they could talk face to face about Bethe’s work, could Fermi follow all the ins and outs of the calculation and carry it forward.21 In both of these examples, senior theorists had difﬁculty making adequate sense of each other’s work to build on it without informal personal communication. As we will see throughout part 1 (chaps. 2–4), the issue was magniﬁed greatly when it came to younger theorists, still in the midst of their training. Something like tacit knowledge—or at least extended personal contact over and above the exchange of formal written instructions—proved crucial for spreading Feynman diagrams around. Note that I wrote “something like tacit knowledge”: Priestley and Polanyi notwithstanding, the category of tacit knowledge has not been without its detractors, and important cautions must be acknowledged before we import the category into studies of theoretical sciences. Myles Jackson, for example, raises the important point that items of scientiﬁc practice may remain “tacit” for many different reasons: trade secrecy and designs to protect priority are hardly the same as an in-principle inability to express all the nuances of experimental protocols. Stephen Turner asks how, if tacit knowledge is truly tacit, historians, philosophers, and sociologists can ever analyze it, let alone prove that it was the causal agent behind a scientist’s work. Kathryn Olesko notes that much of what has formerly been classiﬁed as tacit knowledge— such as a scientist’s judgments about how to analyze and reduce data—was in fact subject to explicit codiﬁcation. And Peter Galison cautions against reifying skill: many aspects of laboratory life, Galison ﬁnds, were easily replicable at a distance, while others remained more stubbornly rooted to time and place.22 in Italy. Bethe explained that Borsellino had never been a party member and so was eager to head off potential State Department opposition from the start. We will examine similar problems that other physicists encountered regarding visas and passports during this period in chap. 9. 21.

Jackson, Spectrum of Belief (2000), 10–13; Turner, Social Theory of Practices (1994), esp. chaps. 4, 6; Olesko, “Tacit knowledge” (1993); and Galison, Image and Logic (1997), 52–54.\n\nPedagogy and Theory\n\n13\n\nEven with these well-placed cautions and caveats, I ﬁnd tacit knowledge helpful as a phenomenological description of how Feynman diagrams spread. Exceedingly few physicists picked up the diagrams and applied them in research based only on reading articles about the new techniques. In almost every case, some form of informal personal communication—usually of an explicitly pedagogical kind, such as an adviser mentoring graduate students, or postdocs working closely together—can be traced behind the scenes of physicists’ uses of Feynman diagrams. Looking at the work that physicists performed before and after they interacted with members of the growing diagram-using network quickly reveals a stark pattern: even years after the diagrams had been described at length in print, individuals—and even whole departments—that were not in personal contact with members of the diagrammatic network did not make any use of the diagrams, whereas those people who interacted regularly with other diagram users made frequent use of the diagrams. Without reifying “skill” or trafﬁcking in inscrutable or mystical know-how, the concept of tacit knowledge remains useful because of its emphasis upon these nontextual means of transmission.23 Yet in one important example that we will consider in chapter 4—a small group of physicists working in the Soviet Union during the early years of the cold war—some theorists did pick up the diagrams and make use of them without any discernible personal contact with other diagram users. Clearly something about the diagrams could travel via texts alone. The question thus becomes not whether they could travel in principle, but rather what exactly traveled via these published sources? The handful of physicists who learned about the diagrams only from texts developed an adequate facility with one way to calculate with the diagrams. What seems not to have been transmitted via texts was a sense for how else the diagrams could be applied as useful tools. That is, some form of understanding could be packaged and transmitted via texts, but not the more improvisational uses developed by those groups of physicists who shared informal contacts. Inﬁnite epistemic barriers—the “all or nothing” lurking behind most analyses of tacit knowledge—did not separate those who learned about the diagrams in person from the small minority who learned about them only from publications. Nor will we be aided by Kuhn’s notion of “incommensurability”: the gap between diagram users and the rest was not a hopeless conceptual mismatch so much as differences in physicists’ preferences for one type of tool over another. A spectrum emerged, as physicists in various 23. A similar point is made in Trevor Pinch’s review of Turner’s Social Theory of Practices: Pinch, “Old habits die hard” (1997).\n\n14\n\nchapter one\n\nlocal settings made choices about what to work on, how best to deploy their hard-won tools, and what kinds of calculations their students should practice and master. Few aspects of these choices are captured by talk of “knowledge,” “information,” or “conceptual understanding.” Rather, the idiom is one of skills and tools.\n\npedagogy and postwar ph ysics Central to the argument of this book is that once we begin to examine the tools of theory, we must also consider the tool users—and thereby we enter the realm of pedagogy and training. Rather than construe “pedagogy” in the narrow sense of classroom teaching techniques—though these are certainly important —I interpret “pedagogy” more broadly. I am interested in the institutions of training by means of which young physicists became working theorists during the decades after World War II. Much of this training and apprenticeship took place outside the classroom. Thomas Kuhn raised similar themes with his discussion of exemplars in the theoretical sciences, though his prescient analysis left many questions open. In particular, he did not explore in any historical detail how such exemplars emerged, how students in various generations actually learned to solve exemplars and build upon them in their research, or whether students at different training centers learned about and leaned upon exemplars in distinct ways.24 Kathryn Olesko and Andrew Warwick have begun to ﬁll in Kuhn’s picture. In their studies of nineteenth-century K¨onigsberg and Cambridge (respectively), they have demonstrated that the transfer of theoretical skills was tied directly to new pedagogical instruments, such as new types of seminars, problem sets, paper-based examinations, and private coaching. As these new teaching techniques emerged over the course of the nineteenth century, so too did a distinct specialty called “theoretical physics,” along with a critical mass of young physicists who now considered it their own.25 These detailed historical studies point to institutional and pedagogical reforms and their bearing on the form and content of knowledge. We learn from their accounts how new skills were inculcated in a particular setting and how these techniques became second nature to students in training there.26 To understand physicists’ incorporation of Feynman diagrams during the middle 24.

In particular, the diagrams’ rapid dispersion raises the question of how theoretical skills—honed in local settings, subject to all the contingencies of time and place—became shared across so many distinct locations and research groups. That is, how did local practices take on the trappings of universal methods? Sustained pedagogical work proved crucial, connecting physicists at Cornell, Princeton, Berkeley, Cambridge, Tokyo, and a half dozen other sites in between. To understand these mechanisms of transfer, we must throw our historical net wide, tracing developments in each of these far-ﬂung places; no single site will do. During the 1940s and 1950s, the diagrams were adopted quickest and to the widest extent by physicists working in the United States—and thus it is crucial to understand the broader American setting within which Feynman diagrams began to disperse. The early postwar years presented unprecedented challenges to American physicists: following the dramatic (and well-publicized) wartime efforts of physicists on radar and the atomic bomb, and with the aid of such measures as the G.I. Bill, enrollments in physics graduate programs grew at nearly twice the rate of all other ﬁelds combined. Just four years after ﬁghting had ended, the nation’s physics departments were granting three times as many doctorates per year as the prewar highs—a number that would soon climb by another factor of three after the surprise launch of Sputnik. From the late 1940s through the end of the 1960s, the tremendous and rapid growth in American physics departments was felt viscerally in small, medium, and large departments alike. No aspect of daily life remained untouched, from the lack of ofﬁce space and overcrowded laboratory conditions, to the proliferation of formal bureaucratic procedures where informal precedents had once held sway, to widespread feelings of “facelessness” and a perilous loss of “intimacy” amid the overﬂowing lecture halls. Even routine social events, such as the Berkeley physics department’s annual picnics, became logistically exhausting affairs.27 At the same time, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission began to construct a coast-to-coast series of national laboratories, in part to keep the nation’s physicists “on tap” and at the ready in case of the next outbreak of ﬁghting.28 The ever-growing cyclotrons at the new laboratories quickly ﬂooded\n\nGeisen and Holmes, Research Schools (1993); Kohler, Lords of the Fly (1994); Rudolph, Scientists in the Classroom (2002); and Kaiser, Pedagogy and the Practice of Science (2005). 27.

Institutionally, their responses centered on revamped postdoctoral training, refurbished summer schools, and new series of informal and inexpensive textbooks. Intellectually, most theorists interested in nuclear and high-energy phenomena redoubled their efforts to develop phenomenological models of use to their experimentalist colleagues. To many of these theorists, Feynman diagrams seemed to offer the ideal pedagogical resource for their newfound challenges: tailor made (or, rather, tailorable) for efﬁcient, repeatable—and hence trainable—calculations, they gave theorists and their students a way to “get the numbers out” with greater efﬁciency than ever before. The oft-discussed pragmatic character of American science, and of postwar American theoretical physics in particular, must be understood in terms of these changes in physicists’ infrastructure.30 As we will see in chapters 4, 6, and 8, physicists working in other parts of the world faced different challenges after the war: not fables of abundance but rigors of reconstruction. Working within their own institutional constraints, when physicists outside the United States picked up Feynman diagrams and put them to work, they often did so in ways distinct from those of their American colleagues. Neither of the large-number pressures—student enrollments or new experimental data—affected physicists outside the United States in the same ways. These differences were inscribed in the calculations they undertook and the diagrams they drew.\n\nov erview: t he two meanings of dispersion Physicists’ uses of Feynman diagrams from the late 1940s through the late 1960s present a series of puzzles. Practically no physicists could understand 29.

Seemingly standard rules for drawing and calculating with the diagrams were in place by early 1949, yet differences in the diagrams’ pictorial form, calculational use, and theoretical interpretation quickly multiplied. In fact, the main purpose for which the diagrams had been fashioned seemed entirely hopeless for tackling the pressing problems of the early and mid-1950s, yet physicists clung to their diagrams, tweaking them here and there, even as they discarded other elements of their calculational instrumentarium. These puzzles point to three main questions, around which this book is organized. Chapters 2–4 address the question, how did the diagrams spread so quickly? Chapters 5–9 ask, for what did physicists actually use the diagrams during the two decades after their introduction? Given the great variety of uses and interpretations, chapter 10 examines the question, why did the diagrams “stick,” even as related techniques came and went? In order to make sense of the themes of transmission and differentiation, I draw upon the term “dispersion.” One cluster of meanings is especially pertinent to the book’s ﬁrst question, regarding how the diagrams spread: “To distribute from a main source or centre . . . ; to put into circulation.” A second meaning of “dispersion” points to the ever-expanding circle of competing uses forged for the diagrams: “To cause to separate in different directions . . . ; to spread in scattered order.”31 “Dispersion” captures at once the work required to make paper tools travel and the plasticity of those tools once they do travel; both meanings are essential. Here, in outline, are some of the main contours of the diagrams’ dispersion: How did the diagrams spread? If the tools of theory were not (or not only) conveyed as disembodied textual information, but rather involved something closer to craft skill and artisanal knowledge, then what mechanisms did physicists draw upon to put the tools into circulation? As we will see in chapters 2–4, Feynman diagrams spread by means of several new institutional arrangements, each taking form in the years after World War II. Most important within the United States was the rise of postdoctoral education for theoretical physicists. Although postdoctoral training had been introduced in the sciences during the early decades of the twentieth century, it became a standard element of 31.

Jordan and Lynch, “Plasmid prep” (1992).\n\n18\n\nchapter one\n\nAmerican theoretical physicists’ training only after the war. Its champions custom-designed postdoctoral training for the cultivation of craftlike skill. Equally important, postdocs were seen as the best way to circulate new tools: after completing their graduate work, physicists almost always moved to a new site for their postdoctoral training before moving to a third site to begin teaching. Leading science policy makers engineered postdoctoral training to feature precisely these design specs: skill acquisition and circulation. Similar, though by no means identical, pedagogical mechanisms of circulation took form within other countries, such as Japan, just at the time that Feynman diagrams were introduced. Ancillary pedagogical materials rose up at the same time, further aiding the diagrams’ spread: preprints (another prewar invention, put on a ﬁrmer foundation after the war), widely circulating (though unpublished) lecture notes, and soon new series of textbooks and reprint volumes. The new trafﬁc in pedagogical texts reinforced, though rarely replaced, the primary circulation of students and postdocs. What did physicists use the diagrams to do? As anthropologists such as Claude L´evi-Strauss have long emphasized, tools almost always prove malleable and multivalent. “Primitive peoples,” explained L´evi-Strauss, constantly engage in bricolage—making do with the tools at hand. As he emphasized, a bricoleur’s set of tools is not tied to a speciﬁc task or program; rather, the tools are accumulated over time and deployed on a case-by-case basis. The tool user’s ﬁrst move, in L´evi-Strauss’s account, is thus retrospective: What tools do I already have? How have I used them in the past? What rearrangement might work now?32 L´evi-Strauss clearly intended his account to apply to modern scientists and engineers as well; over the past twenty years, historians and sociologists have obliged, producing dozens of detailed descriptions of how experimental scientists tinker and improvise with tools, extending them piecewise for new investigations.33 Theoretical physicists proved no less proliﬁc at refashioning the tools at hand. Consider the examples in ﬁgure 1.3, each of which appeared with the label “Feynman diagram” between 1949 and 1954. As we will see throughout chapters 5–9, theorists tinkered with the new 32.

Instead, order may be brought to this scattershot display by focusing on theorists’ training. Art historians have long been accustomed to classifying painters according to their training, using descriptive phrases such as “follower of van Eyk,” or “from the school of Titian.” Historians of science stand to make similar gains by considering the pedagogical links between young instructors and their students as these played out in various departments. In each local setting, physicists adapted features of the diagrams to better bring out aspects deemed most important for new kinds of calculations. More often than not, theorists trained their students to practice using the diagrams the way they used them. The diagrams drawn by young physicists at Cornell thus began to look different—and to be used in ways subtly distinct—from those drawn by their peers at Rochester, the University of Illinois, or Cambridge. (With practice, one can actually “predict” where a physicist was trained based on the diagrams he or she drew and the kinds of calculations in which the diagrams were enrolled.) Consider the examples in ﬁgure 1.4: in each pair, the diagram on the left comes from an adviser in one of the major training centers, and the example on the right from someone the adviser trained.35 As we will see in chapters 5 and 6, mentors and students crafted the diagrams in locally varying ways, in pursuit of distinct types of calculations. More than this, physicists in various places differed on what their diagrams purported to show. To some, the diagrams functioned as pictures of 34. Physicists developed several closely associated (and genealogically related) diagrams during the 1950s and 1960s, such as L´evy diagrams, diagrams for use with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, Goldstone, Landau, and Cutkosky diagrams, and so on. Most of these stood in for classes of Feynman diagrams, such as all those with two particles in the intermediate state. These “Feynman-like” diagrams are also included in this study: where some physicists spoke of “L´evy diagrams,” for example, others continued to label them simply “Feynman diagrams.” Moreover, physicists routinely talked about relations between these types of diagrams. The label “Feynman diagram” did not extend inﬁnitely, however: as we will see in chap. 10, there were other types of diagrams in play at the time, such as “dual diagrams,” that physicists treated quite differently from Feynman diagrams and were often at pains to distinguish; they had little trouble telling them apart. 35. The examples from Cornell, Columbia, and Rochester all involve advisers and their graduate students. The cases of Chicago and the University of Illinois involve older theorists who learned about the diagrams from their colleagues. In the ﬁnal example, from Oxford and Cambridge, the putative “advisee,” John Ward, had already made use of Feynman diagrams for different types of analyses and talked extensively with his colleague, Abdus Salam, about how to use the diagrams for the types of calculations Salam had been working on; the diagrams Ward began to draw shifted accordingly.\n\nPedagogy and Theory\n\nCornell\n\nColumbia\n\nChicago\n\n21\n\nRochester\n\nUrbana\n\nOxbridge\n\nFigure 1.4. “Family Resemblances.” Mentors and students crafted diagrams for different purposes.

To others, the diagrams were no more than helpful mnemonic aids for wading through long strings of complicated mathematical expressions—they were not to be confused with the stuff of the real world. Still others developed the diagrams as tools for a new kind of diagrammatic reasoning—the diagrams’ structural or topological features prompted and enabled the investigation of various symmetries that their associated mathematical expressions should obey. Most often, these distinct roles blurred together in practice. Feynman diagrams thus functioned as many other inﬂuential scientiﬁc diagrams have done—ranging from stratigraphic\n\n22\n\nchapter one\n\ncolumns, to chemical formulas and atomic orbitals, to pictures of immunological antibodies—subject to the same slippage between realistic depiction, convenient calculational device, and heuristic guide to further research.36 Chapters 7–9 push the theme of the diagrams’ many functions further, following physicists’ efforts from the mid-1950s through the 1960s to pull together a new framework for studying nuclear particles’ interactions. The Berkeley theorist Geoffrey Chew’s “S-matrix program” grew out of the piecewise adaptation of Feynman diagrams, together with new rules (or, most often, rules of thumb) for their use. Chew and his students and collaborators came to read content in the diagrams’ unadorned lines that ran counter to much of the diagrammatic machinery that had come before. Indeed, they argued that their new program, borne on the backs of reinterpreted Feynman diagrams— and which always seemed to be just around the corner, never quite at hand in ﬁnal form—augured the death of quantum ﬁeld theory itself, from which the diagrams’ original rules had been derived. Chew’s creative appropriation of the diagrams, which grew to dominate studies of the strong nuclear force during the 1960s, drew upon a mixed bag of conceptual resources. As he struggled to make sense of the strong force, Chew engaged in several other struggles as well, from political strife in the age of McCarthyism to unusual ideas about how to train large cadres of graduate students at a time when physics enrollments were booming. In pulling his particular package of diagrammatic techniques together—centered on what he called “nuclear democracy”—Chew drew metaphorically upon his earlier, intense efforts to forge “democracy” in other corners of his life. Physicists always appropriated Feynman’s diagrams against a backdrop of local motivations and resources, forged by prior training and experience; Chew’s fascinating work highlights the range of interpretations that physicists fashioned for Feynman diagrams. Why did the diagrams stick? The challenge that Chew and his Berkeley group mounted to the prevailing framework for studying particles’ interactions highlights a ﬁnal question: why did physicists cling to Feynman diagrams, even as so many other elements of their toolkit came and went? Why, moreover, did physicists cling stubbornly to their Feynman diagrams when working on problems far beyond the domain for which the diagrams’ effectiveness and efﬁciency had been demonstrated? In answering this ﬁnal question, we must look beyond the myriad local differences and variations charted in earlier chapters and ask about more broadly shared features of physicists’ training. 36. See esp. Rudwick, “Visual language” (1976); U. Klein, Experiments, Models, Paper Tools (2003); Park, “Quantum chemistry” (2005); and Cambrosio, Jacobi, and Keating, “Ehrlich’s ‘beautiful pictures’” (1993).\n\nPedagogy and Theory\n\n23\n\nArt historians have long pondered such questions as why certain pictorial styles persist. Surveying the grand sweep of representational styles that have dominated at one time or another throughout world history, the resolution of this question can hardly be, “because that’s just how the world looks.” Likewise with Feynman diagrams, physicists always had choices about what tools to use and what problems to study. Many times during the postwar decades, physicists chose to work with Feynman diagrams even for those problems that—on the face of it—were least well-suited to diagrammatic treatment. No “natural ﬁt” argument will do. Feynman diagrams owed their persistence to broadly shared elements of physicists’ training, which had become standard across the many local groups scattered throughout the world. Most physicists after the war came to draw and teach their Feynman diagrams according to much older pictorial conventions for depicting objects’ paths through space and time. The visual connections with these older techniques, which had become standard fare for physics undergraduates by the early postwar years, help explain why Feynman diagrams stuck: they could be taught in ways that borrowed from more elementary skills that had already become second nature for most young physicists. On top of this, physicists often worked with their Feynman diagrams much the way they worked with other visual representations of particles’ scattering, including the millions of bubble-chamber photographs that ﬂooded the work of the postwar generation of nuclear and particle physicists. Issues of realism and reiﬁcation, overlaid upon questions of pedagogical inculcation, help explain why physicists chose Feynman diagrams so consistently as their tool of choice. * * * Feynman diagrams are clearly artifactual. In this sense, we may speak of them as “constructions,” or even as “social constructions.” Yet to halt the investigation here would mean stopping short: it would do no more to clarify theorists’ treatment of the diagrams than would equating all forms of written expression, from Romantic poetry to the federal tax code, as “social constructions.” Our next task within postconstructivist science studies is to distinguish between kinds of constructions; the means by which constructions make sense for certain scientists in particular times and places; how they spread among large and heterogeneous communities; and how scientists put these constructions to work, generating new ideas or providing a heuristic scaffolding for others. Paper tools and pedagogy offer powerful means with which to tackle these questions.\n\n•\n\n2\n\n•\n\nAn Introduction in the Poconos [Feynman’s method] contains more arbitrary assumptions than Schwinger’s which, however, do not affect the result; moreover, it is rather simpler than Schwinger’s . . . and seems to lead to the same ﬁnal results. hans bethe, 19481\n\nFeynman introduced his diagrams in the spring of 1948 as an aid for tackling difﬁculties that had challenged theoretical physicists for decades. Following a brief review of these earlier efforts, this chapter turns to the diagrams’ early dispersion, charting the diagrams’ rising popularity between 1948 and 1954. During this brief period, the number of adherents of Feynman’s new diagrammatic techniques grew from a lone user (Feynman himself) to include over one hundred diagram enthusiasts. All the more striking, this broad community grew without the aid of textbooks: the ﬁrst English-language textbooks on the new methods were published only in 1955, after this ﬁrst wave of conversion.2 The diagrams’ rapid dispersion depended much more strongly on personal contact and particular pedagogical relationships than on published texts. The task ahead (taken up in this chapter along with chaps. 3 and 4) thus turns on prosopography: who used the new diagrams, and how did they come to use them?3 1. Hans Bethe, “Electromagnetic shift” (1948), 13. 2. Two textbooks were published in 1953 that treated some of the new diagrammatic developments (one in Japanese and the other in Russian), although these books had no impact on the main community of diagram users centered in the United States until they were translated into English in 1956 and 1957, respectively. See Umezawa, Quantum Field Theory (1956); and Akhiezer and Berestetskii, “Quantum electrodynamics” (1957). 3. Cf.

Yet as American and European-´emigr´e physicists gathered for their wartime service in the early 1940s, they could recount with evident pride the accomplishments within physics from those same troubled decades: ﬁrst Einstein’s special and general relativity, and soon thereafter the Continental birth of quantum mechanics. Physicists, and especially the new specialists, theoretical physicists, had achieved unexpected insights into the worlds of the lightning fast, the cosmologically large, and the subatomically small. Even as the world around them seemed to lumber on with its troubles, physicists could recall heroic and revolutionary times.4 Still, as these same physicists knew well by the early 1940s, the riches of relativity and quantum mechanics resisted combination. Soon after Paul Dirac introduced his now-famous quantum-mechanical treatment of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and his relativistic treatment of the electron in 1927–28, physicists in Europe, along with a string of young Americans on European postdoctoral visits, began to discover a sickness in quantum electrodynamics (QED), their new quantum-mechanical description of electromagnetic forces: straightforward calculation of nearly any process produced unphysical inﬁnities, rather than ﬁnite numbers. The simplest approximation to the problem of electrons scattering off electrons, or of light scattering off electrons, produced results in good agreement with experimental data, but as soon as theorists tried to nudge their approximation another step or reﬁne their calculation with additional correction terms, they invariably hit the troublesome inﬁnities. When applied separately to problems of macroscopic motion or atomic dynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics fared exceedingly well. For questions involving both the very fast and the very small, however, theorists had more or less crawled to a standstill during the 1930s.5 4. For reviews, see esp.

Jordan began the process in the midst of his work on Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics, composing a long and difﬁcult section of the famed Dreim¨annerarbeit, or “three-man paper” by Heisenberg, Jordan, and Max Born of 1926, on suggestive ways to quantize vibrating strings (seen as a ﬁrst step toward treating waves and ﬁelds). The following year, Paul Dirac demonstrated that the electromagnetic ﬁeld’s inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom could be decomposed as a sum over quasi-particulate oscillators, each corresponding to a speciﬁc frequency or energy—a representation, soon dubbed “second quantization,” that Jordan quickly extended to matter ﬁelds as well. By 1927, Jordan had become convinced that all physical quantities—everything from the electrons and protons of ordinary matter to the electromagnetic ﬁelds that bound them together into atoms—arose ultimately from quantum ﬁelds. Although resisting some of Jordan’s maneuvers at ﬁrst, other theorists, including Heisenberg and Pauli, soon came to share Jordan’s view.6 That same year, while still working out some consequences of his matrix mechanics, Heisenberg introduced his uncertainty principle. In its usual formulation, the uncertainty principle stipulates that a system’s simultaneous position and momentum cannot be determined with arbitrarily high accuracy. A quickly derived variant held that the energy associated with a given process and the time over which that process takes place similarly cannot be determined with arbitrary accuracy: E t ∼ h, where h is Planck’s constant, and E and t represent the uncertainty in energy and time, respectively. The science writer Isaac Asimov once described this energy-time uncertainty relation with a telling metaphor: a naughty schoolchild could break the classroom rules for short periods of time and avoid getting caught so long as the teacher’s Inward Bound (1986), chaps. 15–18; Kragh, Dirac (1990), chaps. 6–10; Miller, “Frame-setting essay” (1994); and Cao, Conceptual Developments (1997), pt. 2. An excellent concise summary may be found in Weinberg, Quantum Theory of Fields (1995), 1:1–48. 6.

A simple infraction (with a correspondingly small E ), such as sticking out his tongue, could be done over a relatively long period of time (large t), whereas a more outrageous stunt (a large E ), such as standing on his desk, would have to be wrapped up much more quickly (small t) so as to avoid getting caught before the teacher turned around again.7 As with elementary schoolchildren, so with elementary particles: when Heisenberg and his colleagues began to ply his uncertainty principle in the context of quantized ﬁelds, they realized that the exact state of a quantum ﬁeld could never be speciﬁed with absolute certainty at a given time. Like the schoolchildren’s pranks, small ﬂuctuations in the ﬁeld would occur all the time, over small enough time intervals (as set by Heisenberg’s energy-time relation).8 Given Dirac’s and Jordan’s second-quantized representation of ﬁelds as collections of quanta, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle meant that quanta of a ﬁeld could be created spontaneously (with some amount of energy, E ) as long as they were destroyed or reabsorbed within a correspondingly short time, t, so as to maintain E t ∼ h. These short-lived excitations, soon dubbed “virtual particles,” would pop into and out of existence all the time, “borrowing” energy and momentum and then paying them back again some time later. By 1932 two young theorists, Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, had put virtual particles to work: in their scheme, virtual particles served as the carriers of forces between other particles. The electrostatic repulsion between like charges, for example, arose in their scenario by the exchange of virtual photons, the quanta of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. One charged particle, such as an electron, could emit a virtual photon, which would carry some energy and momentum; the virtual photon, in turn, would be absorbed by a second electron, transferring its energy and momentum. Forces thus arose from direct, local interactions—the emission and absorption of virtual particles—rather than acting at a distance. Over the course of the 1930s, theorists elevated this simple mechanism into the heart of quantum ﬁeld theories: all interactions arose from the exchange of virtual particles. The Japanese theorist Yukawa Hideki demonstrated that this scheme could work for forces beyond electrodynamics. As he showed in 1935, the attractive force between neutrons and protons, which kept 7. Asimov, Asimov on Physics (1976), 181. Heisenberg introduced his uncertainty principle in ¨ Heisenberg, “Uber den anschaulichen Inhalt” (1927). 8. The question of how accurately various components of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld may be measured at a given spacetime point, in the light of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, became hotly contested during the early 1930s. See Landau and Peierls, “Erweiterung des Unbestimmtheitsprinzips” (1931); Bohr and Rosenfeld, “Measurability of electromagnetic ﬁeld quantities” (1979 [1933]); Schweber, QED (1994), 111–12; and Hall, Purely Practical Revolutionaries (1999), 249–83.\n\nIntroduction in the Poconos\n\n31\n\nFigure 2.1. Self-energy. An electron traveling in its own electromagnetic ﬁeld, much like a ball traveling in an incompressible ﬂuid, will behave as if its total mass were different from its ordinary, mechanical mass outside the ﬂuid.\n\nthem bound tightly within an atomic nucleus despite the protons’ electrostatic repulsion, could be mediated by the exchange of virtual quanta from a new quantum ﬁeld. If the mass of this new ﬁeld’s quanta were tuned just so, to lie between the mass of electrons and protons, then the range over which they could be exchanged while still obeying Heisenberg’s energy-time uncertainty relation would correspond roughly to nuclear distances. Although no such “mesotrons”—named for their intermediate mass—had as yet been discovered, Yukawa’s scheme at least showed that nuclear forces might be amenable to a quantum-ﬁeld-theoretic treatment.9 Virtual particles thus offered theorists a new tool with which to model subatomic interactions, but not without a price. Nearly as soon as theorists began to study the behavior of virtual particles, they realized that the ghostlike states would give rise to corrections to electrodynamic quantities and processes. For example, an electron could spontaneously emit a virtual photon and reabsorb it a short time later; this would correspond to the electron’s interacting with its own electromagnetic ﬁeld. The energy and momentum carried by the virtual photon during its brief existence would affect the electron’s overall energy and momentum; the “self-energy” interaction would change the effective mass that the electron would appear to have.10 (See ﬁg. 2.1.) Heisenberg and Pauli turned to the question of an electron’s self-energy in 1929–30, calculating the effect of virtual photons on the electron’s mass. They realized that the electron’s effective mass (meff )—that is, the mass that physicists would measure in experiments—would be a compound, made up of two parts. Being 9.

Mathematical physicists had treated analogous problems—such as the motion of bodies in incompressible ﬂuids and electric charges in electromagnetic ﬁelds—during the late nineteenth century. See Dresden, “Renormalization” (1993).\n\n32\n\nchap ter t wo\n\ninherently quantum mechanical in origin, the virtual particles’ contribution to the electron’s mass (δm), the theorists assumed, would be relatively small compared with the electron’s ordinary mechanical mass (m0 ): meff = m0 + δm, with |δm| m0 . Instead, they immediately found that the self-energy contribution diverged to inﬁnity: δm ∼ ∞. Thanks to Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, the virtual photon could be emitted with any energy and momentum whatsoever—including inﬁnite energy and momentum—so long as it “paid it back” sufﬁciently quickly. Theorists such as Heisenberg, Pauli, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf knew they had to include all possibilities within their calculations—even the case of arbitrarily high energy and momentum—and thus, their self-energy calculations always returned inﬁnity rather than a ﬁnite correction to the electron’s effective mass.11 The same problem occurred when they considered corrections to a photon’s energy: a photon could spontaneously emit and then reabsorb a virtual electron-positron pair, and these, too, could carry any energy and momentum whatsoever.12 Hence, the photon’s self-energy diverged to inﬁnity just as surely as the electron’s did. Theorists’ ﬁrst attempts to stanch the self-energy divergences during the late 1920s involved cutting off the relevant integrals at a high, but not inﬁnite, value for the “borrowed” energy and momentum that the virtual particles could carry. By integrating to some large but ﬁnite constant, instead of to inﬁnity, integrals for the electron’s and photon’s self-energies could be made to converge. This procedure, however, created problems of its own, the most important being that such arbitrarily cut-off integrals violated the symmetries of special relativity—the resulting expressions would no longer be relativistically invariant, rendering any ﬁnite answers ambiguous.13 Theorists faced similar problems during the 1930s when they tried to study other “radiative corrections,” or corrections to basic electrodynamic quantities arising from virtual particles. Most important was vacuum polarization: 11. See Schweber, QED (1994), 86, 119–28; and Miller, “Frame-setting essay” (1994), 33–35, 58–69. 12. Dirac postulated that electrons should have antimatter cousins, with the same mass but opposite electric charge, based on the form of his relativistic equation for electrons. These antimatter partners were soon dubbed “positrons.” See Dirac, “Quantum theory of the electron” (1928); Dirac, “Theory of electrons and protons” (1930); Dirac, “Theory of the positron” (1994 [1934]); Kragh, “Dirac’s relativistic theory” (1981); Cassidy, “Cosmic ray showers” (1981); De Maria and Russo, “Discovery of the positron” (1985); Pais, Inward Bound (1986), 346–52; Galison, How Experiments End (1987), chap. 3; Kragh, Dirac (1990), 108–14; and Schweber, QED (1994), 56–69. Interestingly, the idea of pair production actually predated Dirac’s equation: Bromberg, “Concept of particle creation” (1976). 13. Hans Bethe emphasized these difﬁculties with noncovariant formalisms in “Electromagnetic shift” (1948).

A cloud of virtual electron-positron pairs surrounds an electron. The virtual pairs screen the original electron’s charge, so that an observer would measure only the combined charge of the original electron plus the cloud.\n\nthe electric charge observed on an electron would be different from its “bare” charge. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, virtual electron-positron pairs would constantly be created out of the vacuum, so an electron would always be surrounded by a “cloud” of these virtual particles. The virtual pairs would align themselves so that the virtual positrons were closer to the original electron (opposite charges attract) and the virtual electrons further from the original electron (like charges repel). Therefore, any observer would measure the original electron’s charge only as ﬁltered or screened by this cloud of virtual pairs. (See ﬁg. 2.2). Just as the electron had an effective mass different from its mechanical mass, therefore, an electron would carry an effective charge (e eff ) different from its bare charge (e 0 ): e eff = e 0 + δe. Once again, theorists such as Edwin Uehling and Victor Weisskopf assumed that the change in the electron’s charge stemming from vacuum polarization, δe, being inherently quantum mechanical in origin, would be a small correction, with |δe| e 0 ; once again, they found instead that the vacuum polarization effects produced unphysical inﬁnities instead of ﬁnite answers. The reason for the divergences was basically the same as for those in the self-energy calculations: the virtual particles could carry unlimited energy and momentum, and any effort to cut off the integrals by hand at some ﬁnite momentum would destroy the calculation’s relativistic invariance.14 Beyond these troublesome inﬁnites, a second problem plagued interwar efforts in QED: the formalism was notoriously cumbersome for performing calculations. Keeping track of the various ways that virtual particles could behave quickly became an algebraic nightmare. Electrons, for example, could 14.

In principle, they could shoot any number of virtual photons back and forth: they could exchange only one photon, two or three photons, sixty-seven thousand photons, three billion photons, and so on. The more photons in the fray, the more complicated the corresponding equations; and yet the full quantum-mechanical calculation depended on tracking each possible scenario and adding up all the contributions. All hope was not lost, at least at ﬁrst: Heisenberg, Pauli, Jordan, and the rest knew they could approximate this inﬁnitely complicated calculation 1 because the measured charge of the electron, e, is so small: e 2 ∼ 137 , in appropriate units. The electrons’ charge governed how strong their interactions would be with the force-carrying photons: every time the electrons traded one more photon back and forth, the equations describing the exchange picked up one more factor of this small number, e 2 . So a scenario in which the electrons traded only one photon would “weigh in” to the full calculation with the factor e 2 , whereas electrons trading two photons would carry the much smaller number e 4 —the latter term would contribute to the full calculation over one hundred times less"
